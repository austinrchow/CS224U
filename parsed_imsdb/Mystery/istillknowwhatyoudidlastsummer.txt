-    - The setting sun backlights a series of abstract colored images
Holy images of   and lead
across the marble floor
- little older, a little wiser, yet still very pretty, no doubt
But she's all alone in the house of the Lord
And those doleful eyes of hers clearly telegraph a very heavy burden still rests upon her soul
She reluctantly walks past the rows of empty pews toward a curtained 2
- Julie slides the drapes shut behind her as she enters, kneeling before the
beat -- and the

Julie looks down, crosses herself, and begins
Bless me, Father, for  have sinned
(a beat) It's been a year since my last confession
Julie swallows hard
This is difficult for her
(cont'd) 've never told anyone this
Not my mom, not the poice, not even my friends -- except for the ones who were there and they
well they're not around anymore
You see
Yes
killed a man
Well,  thought had
then
She balks at the memory of it
The priest bows his head in the shadows of the other side
(cont'd) (emotional) You've got to understand
It was all an accident
terrible accident
It's been a whole year
've tried to get past this, but  just can't
Go on
have these dreams
horrible dreams
And this man is always there with me

You see, he was a killer
He murdered Helen and Barry, and he would have killed me too, if hadn't
gotten away with it

to finally say his name
Ben Willis
His name was Ben Willis
The confession is cathartic for Julie
She looks relieved until, know
Julie stops
Looks through the screen
chill shoots through her body
You know
But how could you
Clouds of icy steam shoot through the partition
Julie moves closer to the screen, trying to get a better look

- Still screaming -- Julie jumps back, seemingly knocked out of her chair
She fights the unseen demon
Sitting beside her, Julie's friend   reacts
He's a good- looking kid in a shy, humble kind of way
And he tries to help her, but she's too busy turning ten shades of red
The  lowers his glasses, makes it even worse
Nice to see you find Political Science so stimulating -- The lecture hall erupts with laughter
'm sorry -- Julie grabs her stuff and bolts
: 4
- Julie explodes out of the building
Hurries down a sidewalk
Will finally catches up
Julie
Wait
You okay
'm fine
You sure
'm fine
You don't seem fine
Julie realizes this is true
had another dream, Will
Will takes this seriously
The shower again
It was in a church
it was so real
mean,  could feel his breath on me
(caring) 'm sorry
thought  was over the dreams for good
really did
hadn't had one for months
It just takes time, Julie
It's gonna get better
It can't get worse
mean, it's not like this was the first time freaked out in class
hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, 'm this close from being thrown out of school
Julie jumps out of her skin
It's just letting off  as they fly past on bicycles
Will and Julie are now thinking the same thing
(cont'd) It was one year ago
It's
the anniversary
That's what's going on
Take it easy on yourself
(weary) 'm trying
really am
Sometimes don't even know why  came up here in the first place
(cheering her up) To get out of Southport
(softens) Right
Now  remember
He smiles at her
She smiles back
They stop in front of her apartment building
(cont'd) Are you getting out of town on the fourth
Nah
'll probably just be here studying for finals
The joys of summer school
(beat) Are you okay
'm okay
Are you sure
She touches his face affectionately
Thanks for the talk, Will
You're good to me
Will stands there akwardly -- Um
Okay
Bye
Will walks away
Julie watches him a beat, then turns down her walk -- steps out of the shadows
Julie practically faints
Oh, my god, Ray
You scared me
Recovering, she hugs Ray, genuinely glad to see him
He's a bit cold
got in early
was excited
(re: the receding Will) Who was that guy
Oh, that's Will
He's a friend
You'd like him
Yeah
Ray, we're just friend
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first
Why are you being like this
It should be obvious Ray feels insecure in the college environs, but they're miscommunicating
Hey, 'm sorry
You're right
Are you ready to go
've got the old truck
You know the drill
Crab boil at Ollie's
Croaker Queen Pageant
It's only small-town fun, but it's still nice
People really miss you
miss you
She looks at Ray, his compassionate demeanor
This is hard to say -- (softly, but resolved) Ray,  can't
Can't what
just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back
Like some critical piece is missing
Please understand
Ray is cold
This is what he's expected all along
understand something
It's not like that
It's not you
It's me
My head
want to go back
want to be with you
want to be fine
want everything to be like it used to be
(beat) It just isn't
Ray is hurt and confused
(cont'd) Hey, why don't you stay up here
They have fireworks over the river
And
there's a million things to do
have to work, Julie
My boat's in Southport, remember
But,  get it
You need your space from Craokerland
And maybe from me, too
Ray starts walking away
(cont'd) You know where to find me
Ray
Ray
At least come up for a while
Ray keeps on walking
It's okay
'm just gonna go
Julie follows him out to the road
group of   block her way
Ray, 'm sorry
didn't mean
(to herself) 'm just scared
that's all
But Ray is already gone
Julie stares after him a beat, then turns quickly to her door
She clearly feels uncomfortable, exposed on the walk alone
She nervously pulls her keys
can of mace dangles from the keychain
: 5
'  - Students throw  in the street
Ray walks to his old truck, which is wedged between a new Sport Utility and a
He clambers into the front seat
He thinks
Then, digs into his pocket and pulls out the unmistakable shape of an
He throws it in the glove box, starts the truck and drives away
: 6
'   - Julie opens the door and steps inside
She locks three deadbolts
She stands there, alone, listening to the
She doesn't even have a cat
faucet  in the kitchen
6A
'  - The faucet
Julie turns the handle
No success
She checks the lock on each window
She stands for a moment
She picks up a bag of chips and eats a handful
She opens the fridge and takes out a can of nacho cheese sauce
She grabs a soft drink and a jar of bread-and-butter pickles
She gets some cookies from a shelf
She thinks
Opens the freezer, pulls out some fat-free sorbet
She takes the whole mess toward her bedroom
6B
'  - She hits the light switch
bedside light goes on
It's a sparsely furnished room
The bed is pilled high with pillows
She checks the windows, then climbs into bed with the food
On the bedside table are pictures of family and friends
She looks at one of Helen and Barry
She looks around the room
It's depressing
Outside we hear young people having fun, slamming car doors, going places
She picks at the food, then puts it on the table
She turns off the bedside light and enjoys the golden late afternoon glow in the room
: 6C
'  - Julie, sound asleep, is curled into fetal position on the bed
There's a  in the front hall
And
Julie's eyes shoot open
She listens
Another , almost like the front door being
Her arm reaches for the bedside light
She hits the switch
The bulb (whispers) Okay
Okay
Face your fears
She gets off the bed and stands still
(cont'd) (whisper) There's nothing
There's another  down the hall
(cont'd) (whisper) Quiet
Julie silently scoots out of her bedroom toward the kitchen
6D
'  - She gets a large
She listens
It sounds like somone's in the living room
She steps through the kitchen door
As she moves we see a shadow pass the other way down the hallway toward her bedroom
6E
'   - There's   there
(cont'd) Okay, calm down, imagination
She relaxes until she sees that her front door is slightly , light from the hallway slanting through
(cont'd) can't take this anymore
can't
Holding the knife in front of her, she tiptoes to the hallway
There's a soft  coning from her bedroom
She gets a flashlight out of a drawer and starts down the hallway
(cont'd) (fatalistic) Let's just do it
She moves faster toward her bedroom
she listens outside the doorway
It sounds like someone's in the closet
She moves into the room
6F
'  - There's a noise in the darkened closet
Julie moves into position
She turns the flashlight  and lunges for the closet
, 19, all grace and attitude, is on tiptoes reaching for a box of shoes
She
Julie
They both  together
Julie drops the knife and flashlight
thought you were out of town
What are you doing in my closet
They hug, jumping up and down with relief
thought you were out of town
What are you doing in my closet
i just wanted your black pants, but 'm not ready to die for them
Julie turns on the light in the hallway
Karla has her shoes in her hand and black pants draped over her arm
That was heart attack time, Karla
No
When  put these skinny pants on my body
Now, that's heart attack time
Karla looks down and sees the knife
She picks it up with two fingers -- (cont'd) And we're going to put away the utensils and you're coming with me
Julie flops down on her bed
'm not going anywhere
'm fat, ugly, and depressed
Yeah, right -- whatever
think  just really hurt Ray's feelings
(keeping it upbeat) Listen to me, Julie
Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so
Ray
mean, he lives in Southport
Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street
Karla picks up the flashlight and goes into the closet
There's nothing between Will and me
(
) Yet
Nothing yet
She emerges with clothes for Julie
Holds up one outfit
(cont'd) What we gotta do is keep moving
No time to mope
'm working at the club tonight
And you, dancing queen, are coming with me
No 'm not
Karla holds up another dress for Julie -- strapless, sexy, the one
Fine, then be fat, ugly, and depressed
Karla is dancing around
Julie laughs at her friend and takes the dress when Karla hands it to her
: 7
- It's a hopping college joint: crowded, loud , a dance floor, and rivers of cheap booze
Julie sits next to Karla as she waits for her drink order
handsome young man slides in front of them
This is  , 23, handsome, no pretention, a little dangerous, with a killer smile
You know what  want to do to you right now, don't you
There's gotta be somewhere we can be alone
(playful) don't think so
It's pretty crowded
Just for a minute, baby
got something  wanna tell you
He's looking for a dark corner or a storeroom or something
(teasing) If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then  don't wanna hear it
'll talk real slow
He's kissing her ear
She starts to giggle
The bartender sets down drinks on Karla's tray
(re: Julie) Ask her to dance
Tyrell hesitates
(cont'd) Go on
Karla cuts away through the crowd, delivering drinks
Tyrell turns to Julie
You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature
That's right
It's how the species survives
You'll never convince me otherwise
(beat) Wanna dance
Karla passes by -- Say yes
No
No means yes
Tyrell,  appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance
We make the mouth face, we move the fingers -- (heading for the floor) Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me
Come on, 'll take a break and we'll all dance
7A
-   - is packed and thumping
Karla is dancing her way through the crowd
Tyrell and Julie follow behind her
Karla sees Will
He's dressed up and nervous
She smiles
(cont'd) Whaddayou know
Will Benson lookin' fine
(suspicious, but having fun) Karla
Did you tell him 'd be here
Nope
told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight
And then he came anyway
(shy to a fault) This was not my idea
What
said, this
Do you want a drink
Will looks down at his feet
He and Julie stand there not quite knowing what to do
Where  come from, you want to snatch the goodies, you got to at least talk to them first
Tyrell and Karla go for it on the dance floor, leaving Will and Julie alone
They look at each other
They look at everyone dancing
How about a drink
Will is a few steps ahead as they move for the bar
Julie seems to be relaxing, having a good time
Then, she looks up into the balcony and sees, in a strobe light's  -- watching her intently
She squints for a better look, but he's gone
(yelling over the din) You okay
She's chalk white and crestfallen
Her whole affect is "Will  ever have a normal time
" She drifts amay toward the stairs to the balcony
(cont'd) Hey Julie
Will catches Karla and Tyrell's eyes
They're worried
7B
-  - Julie catches another glimps of
She pushes her way through the crowd up the stairs
7C
-  - Julie looks all around -- finally spotting the     from behind, making his way to the other side
He slices through a crowd of students, and Julie keeps following
He turns down a service corridor
Julie follows, frightened, but unable to resist
She catches him at the end of the corridor
She reaches out and grabs the stranger's arm
Ben
The stranger turns around
It's only a club kid in a tacky vinyl raincoat and hat
She's shaken
Hye, baby
You following me up here
(a come-on) Well, all right
Julie turns away and hurries down the hallway
Todd follows, but his figure quickly fades
: 8
'  - With morning sun filtering through her blinds, Julie wakes up to the strange sound of
She gets out of bed and slowly exits the room
8A
'    - The noise gets louder as she heads down the hall
The noise is at its loudest -- Julie reaches for a doorknob -- and yanks open the door
rocking and banging inside the closet
Julie frowns
Julie spins, once again startled by Karla, who crosses to the dryer, flipping open the lid and then jumping back to catch the shoes as they pop out on the fly
(still sleepy) That could break the machine
Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers
It's a fact
The phone
Karla looks at her watch
(cont'd) It's Tyrell
(resigned) The number's unlisted
Would you relax
We've been dating three months
He ain't stalking your butt
Okay, okay
You're right
know it, and it feels good

Julie hits the   and Karla hangs up
The 's voice echos through the appartment
(
) Good, then  hope you remember your geography, Karla, because all you have to do to win is tell me the capital of Brazil
Karla's smile abruptly fades
(into phone) Brazil
Um
She looks to Julie, whose face is as blank as hers
(cont'd) You don't know
You have to know
You know everything
'mon, Karla, one easy question, one great getaway
(shrugs) South America

) Karla, we need an answer

So what's your favorite radio station

Julie hangs up and joins Karla dancing on the couch

There's Tyrell, that's one
And, there's my parents And  got some cousins

That means you gotta get yourself a date
Julie thinks, she seems torn

- is  -- wiggling and suffocating its way across the deck of a fishing boat
it's  who's just done the dumping coworker, , friendly, playful, and down-to-earth, calls out from the dock -- Hey, Ray
phone
Ray takes the phone
Hi
Ray is happy to hear her voice, but cautious
(beat) Hey
'm really glad you called
'm sorry
(compassoinate) No, you don't have to be sorry
'm the one -- No,  shouldn't have left so fast
was just
It's okay
Dave holds up two wriggling snappers
He dances them toward each other in a puppetlike mating ritual, making   and narrating -- (as the fish) Julie,  love you
know 'm only a humble fish, but if you really look at it, you're a fish, too
(girl voice) Oh, Ray, you're right
Do me like a snapper
(mashing the fish together) Hey, something smells like fish
Ray waves him away, concentrating on his call
Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas
An island called Tower Bay
And she wants us to come with her
What
The Bahamas
You're kidding
Dave's interest is piqued
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and
(sexy) You know
This weekend
Dave is watching Ray closely
Ray's expression hardens
(hurt) You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me
Idiot
Idiot
Idiot
Karla is watching Julie
It's not you, it's Southport
And it's the Bahamas
And it's free
Karla is watching Julie
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas
Ray, come on
want us to be together
Ray thinks
Dave looks at him like he's crazy
(can't give in) Julie, we're working a big run up here
It's been crazy
We probably have to go out again tonight don't think  can do it
Will you try
for me, please
Dave moves one of the fish like it's been shot through the heart
Okay, 'll try
But, listen
(martyrlike) If  don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time
Ray
please try
really miss you
(beat) Okay
Bye
She hangs up and Karla sits next to her
That boy has got fish on the brain
(sensitive) Hey, cheer up, Charlie
(singing a rumba) We're going to the Bahamas
Bahama Mama, yeah

- Ray is staring unhappily at the little pile of snapper
Dave is staring at him in disbelief
Man, what is your problem
We haven't caught anything for days
Pull the big ugly stick out of your butt
She asked you to go to the Bahamas
Man, you gotta go
We'll both drive up
got friends can see up there
Ray realizes how right he is
Stupid
Stupid
Stupid
What were you thinkng
Ray looks at Dave a contemplative beat, then walks over to his truck
He leans in the passenger side and pulls out the engagement ring box
Dave walks over
You wanna see what 've been thinking
He holds up the box and slowly opens it
Dave is stunned
Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb
should go up there
should call her back, tell her 'm coming
No way, man
Surprise her
She'll be psyched
Ray is excited by the plan and Dave's right there with him
: 11
- We stare out at a rain-soaked stretch of road
past, cruising along with its  loud and windows rolled down
12
'  - The music's even  in here
The mood is high
Two buddies going to propose to a girl
Dave adjusts the radio to another  station -- Man,  love  radio
You got right-wing conspiracy, tips for pregnant womem, Single- baseball games, and real country music
None of that new crap
He adjusts the dial again, tuning in a country song, ", ' ," by Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson
Dave starts singing along, extra  and out of tune
(cont'd) (singing) "
Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys, don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
" Ray looks at his goofy friend singing and starts to get a little happy himself
Then, Ray sees something in the road ahead
He turns down the radio
They both stare -- ' : its  blinking
Ray slows and creeps past the car
The driver's door is open
It appears
is sprawled out in the road away from the car
Ray pulls over to the shoulder and stops
(nervous) don't know, man
Maybe we should keep going, find a phone -- No
The guy looks dead
Ray has seen this before -- Maybe not
He throws open his door
12A
- Ray steps from his truck
Looks back at the empty car, then turns toward the body
(nervous) Hey
Buddy, what's up
The body doesn't move
and behind Dave, in the other car, a     sits up in the back seat and gets out of the car
Ray continues toward the body
- --
Ray moves closer to the all to familiar image
moves toward the unsuspecting Dave
12B
'  - Dave watches Ray in the road
He leans across the seat and rolls up Ray's window
Behind him, the   gets closer, moving to the passenger side of the truck
12C
- Ray nears the body
He kneels down
Hey, can you hear me
Ray reaches toward the body
12D
'  - Something    -
12E
- Ray turns over the body
Something isn't right
Ray jumps back -- - Its eerie smile mocking Ray who turns for the truck
12F
- Dave hears something
He turns to late jams his hook through Dave's jaw and skull and Dave
There's no answer from dead Dave
Ray tries to see around the headlights
He moves slowly toward the truck
The  and  come on, blinding Ray
The truck's engine
The truck rolls a few inches, adjusting a bead on Ray
Then, tires spinning, the truck launches straight at Ray
Ray runs at the truck
, he ducks behind the parked car
goes  past
Ray backs around the car -- - goes barreling by in the other direction
Ray dives out of the way
Ray is exposed
He sees his truck closing fast
He's got nowhere to go
Then, at the very last second, jumps off the edge of the road
His Ray falls through the air
Lands hard on his leg
Tumbles down the hill, finally stopping with a crash
He lies motionless at the bottom of a ravine
: 13
'  - Karla exits the building
She watches Julie sitting on the curb
truck turns onto the street
Julie looks hopeful, but -- it's not Ray
Karla approaches her friend
Girl, it's gettin' down to the wire
Julie turns
He's not coming
thought he was just
Julie, you left four messages
Four
But, he said he'd try
He said he'd try
Try is like maybe
Try is nothing
(appoligizing for him) He does work hard
Work hard, huh
He's breaking your heart just because he can
(hesitant) And  don't want to have to say told you so
Then, don't
Jeep Cherokee stops, and an ebullient Tyrell steps out wearing shorts and a Hawaiian shirt
Hey, baby, we gonna get tropical or we gonna get tropical
The passenger door opens and Will Benson steps hesitantly around the Jeep
Oh
(re: Will) Hey, sorry
(quick, playing it off) He's my friend, too
And that ticket is not going to waste
Will reads Julie's expression
Julie, is everything cool
Karla said
said we start having fun
And that means now
Julie takes a last look up the street
She stands
Is there a problem here
Where there's a Will, there's a way
Come on
(deciding) You know what
This rocks
We're going to the Bahamas
Will is relieved
(getting into the spirit) We goin' Bahamas, 'm Ty's Bahama Mama
We goin' Bahamas
She bops over to Tyrell
: 14
- wide-body jet  through the clouds
15
- nearly empty jet
Karla has her head on Tyrell's shoulder
Julie is reading a book
Will's knuckles are white from gripping the armrests in fear, and his eyes are clenched shut
Julie looks on with concern
Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood
What if  don't have anything happy from childhood
Sorry,  can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute
(calculating) Which is over seven hundred feet a second
Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second
Deep breaths -- (no deep breaths) Fumes build up in the fuel tanks
You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet
Planes use -rings
which freeze in tap water
Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning
Right
Planes get hit by lightning
They get hit by meteors
They hit other planes
Tyrell shakes his head
(exasperated) Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining
(sypathetic) Honey, some folks just can't fly
Will doesn't move, frozen with fear of flying, but more closely bonded with the concerned Julie

Board of Tourism kind of shot

Green islands
Golden sun
Puffy clouds

- More of a small tub than a ferry
Julie, Karla, Will, and Tyrell are the only passengers
At the bow, Julie and Karla laugh and play "King of the World
" Julie in the prow, Karla behind her
(deadpan) 'm the King of the World
(deadpan) No, 'm the King of the World
They switch places
They look at each other and crack up laughing
Karla takes in the surroundings, the salt spray, the day -- Remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin'  do for a weekend once every ten years
(sharing the moment) will, and you remind me of the same thing
They throws their arms around each other and stare into the horizon
Will talks to a very green Tyrell
You just gotta breathe
Tyrell is trying to keep from puking -- Can't talk right now
(slightly malicious) See, it's not a macho thing
It's about equilibrium in your inner ear
You could've used a patch, but it's too late now
Get used to it
(then) Some folks just can't sail
, the  , overhears as he passes -- That's too bad, too, because it's the only way on or off the island
(slightly ominous) Unless you have an accident
And then they call the Coast Guard
Julie and Karla have rejoined the men
It's pretty remote here
(smiles) Yep
That's what the tourists pay for -- sun, sea, and solitude
Are we there yet
Few more minutes
We move off the boat and  the island
The intrepid vacationers excitedly take in the island

- Establishing
An isolated tropical paradise with jungle growing to the beach

- The ferry pulls in to a canopied dock
white-sand beach stretches in every direction
Beautiful tourists stroll about without a care in the world
Tyrell stamps his feet on the dock

dockhand, , glides past him toward the ladies
That way for a complimentary Planter's Punch to get you readjusted
(mile-wide smile) can get used to this
Derrick reaches for Julie's hand, clearly checking her out in the process
Welcome, Fair Princess, to Tower Bay
(a wink) 'm Derrick
At your service for the duration of your stay
Julie smiles politely
Will gently nudges her on
They walk away
(to Derrick, mocking) 'm at your service, Princess

So  gotta work fast
If Marine Radio's right about the weather, you're already out of time
He hangs a  at the end of the gangplank
It reads: --
Our guys are already at the end of the dock

- Establishing
An opulent, Carribean-style hacienda resort with all the accoutrements
The main building is two stories high with a tiled roof
bell tower rises from one side
And, of course, it is surounded on all sides by suffocating fooliage
Julie and Karla take in the beauty of the resort
Check it out

Yes, ma'am
Karla  him on the back of the head, but they're all having fun
The path widens
The trees part
It's even nicer up close
They walk across a tiled plaza
Behind them,    carry their  piggyback, racing each other toward the departure dock
Our two arriving couples move on toward the entrace, passing a on the left
-   straight ahead
And, on the right, with a built-in  in the shallow end
An outdoor stands nearby -- and just beyonk it, a small guy's unintelligible   calls out -- Anybudorsomethin'
They turn to see , white guy, dreads, full-Rasta demeanor
He's a phony, but sincere about it
Titus approaches Tyrell -- My brother, can  interest you in the islands finest ganja
(teasing) Hey, Tyrell, we found you brother
(wry) Not possible
(undetered) Who be wantin' the kind, the uber- sticky, the Bwana, The depth-charge, the Up-All-Night-Laughing-With-Your- Friends
Who wants it
'Cause Titus got it
No, thanks
Come on, man
Everybody wants something
Will and Tyrell walk on
Undetered, Titus goes up to Karla and Julie
(cont'd) How 'bout you, ladies
Lovely ladies
Titus moves his hips
(cont'd) (lascivious) Something  can do for you
Karla looks him up and down, wrinkles her nose -- Take a bath, maybe
That's cold, but if that's how you want it
The group moves on
Titus watches them go -- (cont'd) (yelling after them) Anybudorsomethin' you come and see me

Julie smiles at an old  helping the departing guests with their bags
He doesn't smile back

And in the other,    is visible -- surrounded by four walls of  and
In a dark corner of the room, a uniformed  named  dusts off a massive
Julie smiles at the woman on their way through the lobby, but Olga shyly looks away
Arriving at the  , the four of them find it deserted
They wait patiently, then impatiently
as Karla slaps it with her palm
The bell  for a long time then fades into
Hello
Hello
Where is everyone
'll ask -- Julie turns to consult the maid
The big ball is spinning
But Olga is no longer in sight
Tyrell heads toward a  beside the counter with a sign which reads: 'll scare somebody up
He grabs the knob and pulls the door open to
-- its toothy maw snapping shut about a half inch from his nose
(cont'd) Whoa
Julie and Karla laugh
Karla goes to hit the bell once more -- Karla gasps
Pulls away
We see the hand belongs to the hotel manager -- , balding, 40s, talks slowly, and seems to have secrets he won't share with guests
What can  do for you
Checking in
Karla Wilson
Will saunters away to look at the books in the lobby
(condescending) Ah, yes
Roll out the red carpet
Our contest winners are here at last
He scans a sheet as Tyrell stares at the pit bull
Nice dog
Not really
've found peices of guys like you in his stool
Tyrell is put off by this aggressive comment
What's your problem, buddy
(innocent) don't have a problem in the world
(covering) It sure is a beautiful old hotel
(proud) Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan
The tile work was imported from Spain
lot of history in these walls
Judy Garland stayed here
Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock -- Okay, we get it
It's old
It'll outlive you, 'm sure
Creepy thing to say
Slides a registration form
(cont'd) Wilson comma Karla
(sees something on the form) Oh -- Oh, what
Brooks covers -- You're in 201 and 202
(expecting this) Is that bad
(lying) Not at all
Those are our honeymoon suites
Tyrell wraps his arms around Karla
Julie looks uncomfortably towards Will
Your what
Honeymoon suites
take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet
We haven't exchanged anything
Julie, we're talkin' suites
(excited) That'll be just fine with us
And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need
Wait
Did you say off-season
July fourth weekend
Storm season starts today
The clouds roll in like clockwork
Storm season
It's our version of winter
(hands over the keys) 201 and 202
There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby
Enjoy
And Brooks turns away through the office door
They walk toward their rooms
Will catches up with them
: 24
- They walk down the hallway
Karla seems annoyed
Ain't nothin' free in this world
Everybody says it, and it's true
(dissapointed) wanted you all to have a good trip
We will, baby
All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves
And it's been blue skies all day
It might be perfect all weekend
It beets being on the mainland
Oooh, the mainland -- Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby
Tropical
The mood is improving
interupts
has appeared behind them
And , 60s, the weary Haitian porter, steps from behind it
(a Carribean accent) 201 and 202
Who put you in
(hesitant) Don't use these much -- (suspicious) Why's that
He sees their happy, expectant faces and changes the subject
No real reason
(then) Pretty fancy rooms for kids your age
We won a competition
Oh, yeah
What you have to do
Guess the capital of Brazil -- Rio, baby
Ahh, good for you, girl
(waiting for a cue) And, where would you like me to put the bags
beat as Julie and Karla exchange a look
Then, Karla tosses one of the keys to Julie
(to Estes) Their stuff in there
(grabbing Tyrell) and ours in here
Karla
You promised
(looking at Tyrell) also promised Tyrell
Promised me what, baby
(joking around) made all my promises to William
Tyrell makes fake goo-goo eyes at Will
Estes looks away
(cont'd) Sweetie, you brought your nightie, didn't you
Forward
girl needs time to make up his mind
(to Julie, thoughtful) Julie, look, if it's cool, 'll sleep on the couch and they can have their own room to practice for that real honeymoon
But Tyrell grabs Karla and drags her into the room
We here
'll take those
No, 've been doing this since before you were a dream in your father's eye
Estes grabs the bags and takes them into the room
Julie and Will are left staring at each other
You sure it's okay with you
(noting his sweetness) Sure
It's fine
As long as you don't snore
You can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand
She laughs and they go into the room

Although he's asleep, we can tell he's bruised and generally beaten up

He's beaten up pretty bad -- Yes, but he seemed certain his friend was killed out on the highway by somebody named Ben Willis

He said he was driving a

He's listening

There's no body

She folds it away
Suddenly, the monitoring equpment goes  with a series of (already moving) That's your number twelve -- The doctor, nurse, and country cop hurry back toward Ray's room

- resort bar on the beach
Ocean breezes and surf  come through the window
It's tiki galore, complete with a bamboo bar and fishing gear hanging from decorative nets from the ceiling
There's a   in the corner
Will and Tyrell enter and head straight to the bar
bored bar tender, , looks just like Jennifer Esposito, doesn't look up from her paperback
You guys lost
(re: the emptiness) Tell me this ain't the bar scene
Wanna drink
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing
Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai
How about some
They freeze
(cont'd) Kidding
They nod
The guy at the desk said the place would be quiet, not dead
Didn't anyone tell you this is -- The last day of the season
Yeah, we heard
So why are you still here
That's none of your business
Tyrell sizes her up quickly
What's the matter, boy trouble
Not anymore
He leave you
No
shot him
Will and Tyrell exchange a danger-Will-Robinson glance
(cont'd) What you want is a Dark and Stormy: Vernon's rum, ginger beer, and a touch of Tabasco
Sailors drink it for luck in the hurricane season, trust me
Karla and Julie walk in talking quietly to one another
Am  bad
mean, he's really great, and he's cute -- He's cute
And he's got a crush on you
(off Julie's look) But
(appologetic) miss Ray
tried to call him
Karla looks at her
She's sincere, but firm
Ray made up his own mind
so, you're free to make up yours
Joining the men, but continuing her thought -- (cont'd) For the next foury-eight hours
(joking) Your smile is a frown
turned upside down
She illustrates with her own big smile
Pretty cool bar
They all start to look the same once you've worked in one
(to Nancy) Am  right, sister
Nancy reaches out a hand and they touch just the tips of their fingers
(to Nancy) 'm Julie
This is Karla
Nancy
(sarcastic) Welcome to Tower Bay's most happenin' hotspot
Nancy continues making their cocktails
backs into something, turns and gasps -- it's a statue of an , complete with ,  , and
She doesn't let Karla see that it upset her
Nancy puts their drinks down in front of them
Four Dark and Stormies
They all pick up their drinks
(toasting) To a great weekend -- Yeah, a great weekend
Forget the weather
& 'll drink to that
They drink and toast again
(to Nancy) So what do you do around here for fun
Nancy looks straight at Will -- Make fun of tourists mainly
(beat) Or let them make fun of themselves
She flips a switch that lights the Karaoke stage
Karaoke -- perfect
Don't even think about it
Okay,  won't
She's already heading for the stage
Go baby
Go
the karaoke machine
Karla flips through a binder full of songs
Oh, this ain't for me, baby, this is for somebody who really needs it
(finds one) Ah-hah
One single with extra cheese
(it's true) Everyone thinks their a singer
No way
Yes
No
Yes
Not me
no way
Come on, it'll be fun
Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James
But there will be no mercy
, , & (chanting in unison) Ju-lie
Ju-lie
Ju-lie
Reluctantly she goes to the song book
She sees something particularily awful
You asked for it
(to Tyrell) Song number thirty-nine
Tyrell nods and punches a few buttons
Julie takes the stage as sappy strings begin to swell
She looks at the , then melodramatically at the crowd, and begins to sing -- no,  -- Gloria Gaynor's "
" (cont'd) (singing) First  was afraid
was petrified
(continues singing under) Will stands, clapping
Tyrell pounds his chest
Karla flips up her , swaying like a hard-core fan
And Julie continues, crooning out the chorus as the beat kicks in and the gang begins to dance
(cont'd) (singing) will survive
will survive
The schmaltzy lyrics keep scrolling by -- white against black
But then
in the middle of the song
the color changes
\ (cont'd) (singing -- then trailing off) And  still know
what you did
last summer
Her voice trails
Her smile abruptly fades
falls to the floor
The room echoes with an electronic
Everyone stops dancing, confused
- trembling, shaking, a mess
Will jumps onstage
Julie
What's wrong
It's
him
What do you mean, Julie
He did something to the screen
it, it, said
Julie loos at the screen -- the normal lyrics are still scrolling
She suddenly feels their eyes upon her
They're looking at her like she's having a nervous breakdown
(cont'd) Nothing
Nothing, 'm sorry
Stung, she rushes off the stage
Julie
But it's to late
She's bolted from the bar
: 28
- '  - Julie steps into her room
Closes the door behind her
She falls back against it, trying to calm herself down
There's no way
just stop it right now
She looks around the cozy room
(cont'd) Closet
Bed
Bathroom
No need to panic
Julie starts to undress, get ready for bed, the day of travel finally catching up with her
She grabs something to sleep in
Tosses it on the bed
And that's when she sees it, - propped on the pillows
Her name written across
She is frozen momentarily
Almost against her will, she moves toward the envelope
She reaches down and picks it up
She hesitates, then opens the envelope
She pulls out a In bold print it reads:
appears over Julie's shoulder
Julie can feel the presence
She spins, scaring -- who  and drops the flowers and champagne he was holding
The bottle bursts and covers them with spray
(realizing) Oh, Will
'm sorry
It's my fault
shouldn't have didn't think
She grabs a  off the bathroom door, trying to help him clean up the mess
No, no, no
This was really sweet
scared you --  crossed the line -- No -- it's not that
It's
'm just a little on edge
'm really sorry
Hey, you don't have to appologize to me
'm the one
understand
(covering the awkwardness) 'm going to take a walk and dry off
Are you sure
really appreciate it
He picks up a rose
Most of its petals on the floor
just really like you and  want you to feel good about everything
You know want you to be happy
He hands the rose to her
There's a moment between them
He reluctantly heads for the door
: 28A
- Will looks down at his wet pants
(soto) Dork
Passing Karla and Tyrell's room on his way down the hall, Will spots the
He hears an   from inside
He shakes his head and mopes down the hall

-   '  - Karla bounces playfully on their big bed as Tyrell crosses toward the windows
Tha's it
(bounce) 've decided
(bounce) 'm changing my major to finance
(bounce) And going to Wall Street
Why
'Cause that's the only way 'm ever gonna be able to afford a big bed like this
She falls back against the plush comforter, looking up at herself in a long
Tyrell loves this and quickly moves beside her in the bed
She lets him get real close, then she jumps up -- (cont'd) Jacuzzi
Tyrell reaches for her, but she bounces off the bed
Ah, baby, let's stay right here
Karla pulls her suit out of a bag and models it seductively and flirtatiously for Tyrell
spent a hundred bucks on it
even if it's just so you can pull it off
Tyrell gets off the bed -- like the sound of this
: 30
- Derrick, the dockhand, whistles in the darkness as he coils the bow rope of a service boat around a cleat on the dock
Ominous shadows play all along the dock
Out on the water there's a big
The dockhand rises, looking out at the water with a sigh
Damn
should've brought my pole
He turns away
As he does, we see where a sinister   stands perfectly still, silhouetted by moonlight
Derrick paces down the dock the other way past a handfull of other tied-off staff and service boats
He picks up a hose and begins spraying down the hull of a Sunfish sailboat
He turns the hose off and begins coiling it, backing toward an Suddenly, a  touches him on the back
He jumps and turns to see -- standing there smoking a spliff
Get lost, you scared me
Fish are all over the water
Come on, let us take a boat out
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain
That's why you'll come with Titus, mon
Derrick throws the hose in its place
There's a storm comin', Titus
No boats are going out
Storm is what makes it interesting
Thass why all the fish are up
Less hook us a couple big ones
Derrick is now ignoring Titus
got work to do
Take the bake elsewhere
Up-tighteous and self-righteous
Titus glides away into the dark
Derrick watches him go
There's another  in the water near the dock
Derrick walks to where the splash was
He kneels down by the edge -- watching   from the dark water below
(to the fish) Hello, little sea bass
You're lucky 'm busy or 'd hook you myself

Derrick hears   -- and just in time for

And enjoying its warmth, Karla and Tyrell are liplocked in the churning tub
plays on the boombox beside them
The tempurature rises and Ty's hands begin to wander
Still clad in her cute bikini, Karla pulls away -- You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie
(rubbing his bald head) Hello
Okay,  just didn't wanna get my hair wet
Baby,  finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and  don't wanna be discussin' hair care
She splashes him
Don't you get feisty
Tyrell moves in for the kill
He won't take no for an answer
Too late for that
We're miles from anywhere, baby
No one's gonna hear you scream
He goes in for a serious kiss
Things start to heat up -- used to be a lifeguard
'd hate to have to blow my whistle
(playful) 'd hate for you to have to blow
your whistle
Tyrell is done talking
He pulls her over to him and the moment becomes more passionate
Karla opens her eyes in time to see -- surface in the pool next to them
Karla
And not just because it was a surprise
Titus looks even uglier when he's wet
Titus opens his mouth, reveals a smoking   on the end of his tounge
No water sports after midnight
Hotel policy
Titus eyes Karla in the Jacuzzi
Tyrell moves protectively in front of her
What's the policy on burnin' herb
We got one for that, too
It's don't try until you buy
(beat) You don't buy any, you don't get any
Titus blows a cloud of smoke on them both, rolls the joint back into his mouth, and swims off
Tyrell is angry, but Karla pulls him back
dejected Will appears in his bathing suit, a towel over his arm
Tyrell sees him coming
There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us
(getting in) How's the water
Crowded
Ty
Will slips into the water ignoring Tyrell's look
Ahh, that feels great
(considerate) How's Julie
Alone
In the room
(to Karla) Got any advise
(annoyed) Yeah
Find another Jacuzzi
Karla shoots Tyrell a look
(to Will) Your not out yet, slugger
You gotta just get back up there and keep swingin'

Eyes closed, Julie stands with her face right under the showerhead, trying to relax
Something softly goes
Julie opens her eyes
Turns off the shower
Stands there, frozen, listening
(calling out) Will
No reply
In a robe with a towel on her head, Julie peeks into her room
Nobody there
She sighs, and crosses back to the bathroom sink
Julie looks to a spot where her toothbrush should be
She frowns
Looks around
Some of her things are missing
She peers into the fogged-up bathroom mirror
She whips the  off her head and     , Ready to spit, she looks down

She hears it again
Then, the sound
But standing at the door -- she realizes that's not where it came from
Her eyes immediately go to
Damn
That's where it came from
She slowy pads across the room in her slippers toward the door
Trembling

She touches a finger to it

She looks up

He's dying before our eyes
Blood bubbling from his mouth
His body twitching
Julie stares at the body
She's almost catatonic

She blinks again
Suddenly, in  , his arms fly toward her -- She  -- : 33
-  - Karla and Tyrell are drying off beside Will as their hysterical friend comes racing across the pool plaza
It's happening again
There's a body
Will cathes her in his arms and she sobs uncontrollably
What
What are you talking about
Where
It's in my room
They can see she's not fooling around
: 34
- '  - Everyone is gathered in the center of Julie's room
Julie is held tight by Will
Brooks, the hotel manager, conducts the investigation
Brooks approaches the closet door
Julie holds her breath
He throws it open
long beat
don't find this at all funny
Julie steps in -- stares into the empty closet
She can't believe her eyes
She searches their faces, looking for someone to believe her
There was a body
swear it
(delicately) Julie, you said you were tired
Waybe you were dreaming
(sharp) wasn't dreaming
knew you people were goining to be trouble
knew from the first time laid eyes on you
Julie grabs Brooks by his robe
Listen to me
He's here
Who
Who is here
She doesn't know where to start
Nancy pokes her head around the door
What's going on
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet
Cool
The rest of us see bathrobes
(sharp) am not crazy, Tyrell
He was right there
(not taking it seriously) Fine
Show me the body
Will wanders over to the closet and checks it out
Think about this, Julie
What did you actually see
The dockhand guy
Hanging by his neck from up there
(case closed) In the morning we'll talk to Derrick, the "dockhand guy," and put the whole thing to rest
(looks to Nancy) Now, let's slow down on the Dark and Stormies and get some sleep
Don't look at me -- want off this island
(tired) Not possible, 'm afraid
The last ferry left hours ago
And we got a storm coming
There won't be another one for days
There's a storm coming
'Tis the season, like  told you
It's a big one
Julie goes for the phone
Then 'll call the mainland for a charter
Phones went down a few minutes ago
She picks up the phone, listens, then dangles it from her hand
It's dead
An exasperated Brooks heads for the door
Duh
The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it
What about a radio
Sorry
Emergencies only
What the hell would you call this
'd call this four spoiled city kids who wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up their butts
(beat) All we can do now is batten down and ride it out
If things get really bad, there's a storm shelter
And Brooks is gone
Outside the window, it starts to rain

candle burns, and lighning flashes illuminate the haggard face of Estes, the porter
: 36
- It's a claustrophobic room
Estes turns away from the window, shirtless in his uniform pants
beaded cord hangs around his neck, small fishhook dangling from it
Beside the candle, he picks up a leather bag and dumps out a handful of voodoo icons: roots, coins, sea glass, chicken's foot
He sets them on a divination tray
He opens vials and sprinkles powder and assorted liquids into a small wooden bowl
He opens a drawer and extracts a toothbrush
He dips the brush in the bowl -- covering its bristles with a sticky goo
He holds the brush over the candle's flame
The old man watches it
picks up and impales it on his fishhook necklace
His eyes roll back in his head
He enters a trance
: 37
- Olga, the maid, pushes her laundry cart toward the end of a long, dimly lit hall
She sees a pile of dirty linens outside of a room -- 228
She stops, perplexed
There's nobody staying in this room
She picks them up and stuff them in her cart
Then she knocks on the door
Housekeeping
(beat) Housekeeping
She knocks again and notices her hand leaving bloody marks on the door
She looks at her other hand
Her arms and hands are covered in blood
She turns back to the linens
Something bloody is wrapped inside of them
She paws at the sheets, trying to unravel the mystery -- The door the Room 228 slowly cracks open
reaches out and slices into her apron
It tugs
She turns, and she starts to , she is yanked into the room

The pawn shop owner, , cowboy hat, knows his job, holds it up to the viewing loop next to his eye
Jeez, that's a full carat -- How much
Well, there's some flaws in her
How much
Mac looks around his shop at the usual jumble of crap: vacuum cleaners, golf clubs, guitar amps
Don't really have the market for something like this

Make it three hundred
And throw that in, too

Mac pulls out some forms
(cont'd) Fill these out
Leave the dates blank
Ray starts writing
Mac is overcome by a moment of humanity
(cont'd) Buddy, are you sure this is the way you want to go
Ray gives him a steely stare -- Is it loaded
Mac shakes his head

Off Mac's sadness at young people today

-   '  - We move into the hotel room and gradually reveal     at the end of one bed
They are crammed into a king-size bed together
Julie is awake
She gets out of bed and moves toward the window
It's raining outside
The wind is blowing
The storm has arrived
Karla pulls a sleeping hand off her chest
The hand belongs to Will
She pinches the hand
Will starts
Tyrell kicks his feet around, trying to get some room
This ain't the romantic weekend had in mind
Karla kisses Tyrell on the cheek
(to Julie) You get any sleep at all
Some
Tyrell glares at Julie by the window
Sees the incredible rain
Oh, look
Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director
Miss Psychotic Episode
Hey -- (calling to Julie) See any dead bodies out there
Any fresh kill
How 'bout Freddy, Jason
Julie ignores him, staring out the window
Leave her alone
Angry at her boyfriend, Karla gets out of bed and joins Julie
'm just saying what all of you are thinking
It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time
You don't have to be a jerk
Karla pulls Julie close in a show of support for her friend whose mind everyone believes has been inventing dead bodies
It's okay
He doesn't believe me
That's his right
'm starting to think 'm crazy, too
Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there
What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress
Julie doesn't look to enthusiastic
: 41
- Karla and Julie enter the gym
It has Nautilus machines, treadmills, Life-cycles, free weights, tanning beds, speed and heavy bags
Karla walks over and does a full roundhouse -- spinning and planting her foot dead center of the heavy bag
Nice move
'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it
Julie smiles at her friend bravado
She steps over to a stairmaster and starts her workout
: 42
- Will and Tyrell step out of the room into the long, empty corridor
They cross to a balcony overlooking the lobby
The whole place seems deserted
Where is everybody
(gallows humor) They're all dead
Dead,  tell you
(ghostly) Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd
Tyrellll, joinnnn usss
Will's voice echoes across the lobby
Tyrell is maybe a little nervous, but hiding it
Shut up
They walk down the steps to the lobby
43
- They cross the lobby
(calling out) Hello
(worried) There's nobody here, Tyrell
Tyrell's already out the front entrance
44
- Will and Tyrell exit the hotel and make their way down the steps outside and go splashing across the flooded grounds
Debris from the storm is scattered all around them
They're around
They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners

Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something
(nervous) You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression -- Hey -- shut up, okay
Tyrell keeps walking
Will looks around at the wind-and-water-swept vista
Not much of a day for activities
(sotto) don't like to fish
Tyrell moves across the grounds
He looks back
Will is stopped in his tracks, looking up at -- -- , staring down at them
(calling to Will) You coming
Will trots after him, but he takes a glance back at the window
Estes is gone
: 45
- Julie has finished on the stairmaster
Both she and Karla are sweaty after a good workout
Their moods have improved
Come on, Vampira
got just the thing for you
Karla leads Julie over to the tanning beds
Cancer in a box
No, this is the safe sun
(joking) It's better than a day at the beach
Julie is reluctant
(cont'd) Come on, a little photosynthesis and you'll feel like a new -- Houseplant
Karla opens the canopy of the tanning bed
Exactly
Julie peels off her sweats
Lies down in her underwear
Straps on a small pair of
Karla lowers the canopy over Julie
Karla sets the

Karla
Just kidding
- come to life -- Julie is bathed in purple light
: 46
- Tyrell looks across the grounds and sees, at the far end of the tennis court, ' half-obscured by the heavy fooliage surrounding the court
Tyrell walks away from Will toward the cart
He hears the jam-box on the cart playing " " by Bob Marley
"One good thing about music
when it hits you feel no pain
" 46A
- The open door of the entrance  against the fence in the wind
Tyrell decides to cut through the court to the far entrance and the cart
46B
- Tyrell walks across the court to the sagging net
There is a  in the foliage around the court
moving fast and quietly
(calling out) Hey, Bong Marley
Come here
The door  shut behind him
Tyrell looks back at the door
The latch seems to have stuck and it's no longer swinging
Tyrell turns back toward the other door and sees The standing in the doorway
Tyrell stares at the dog
The dog  at Tyrell, low and menacing
'm gonna kill you, Bong Boy
Simultaneously, Tyrell turns and the dog lunges forward
Tyrell sprints to the door -- it's  by a length of metal slipped into the coupling
He turns to see the dog bounding at him -- Tyrell leaps up the fence just as the pit bull lunges for him
The dog catches his pant leg
Tyrell kicks him away and frantically scrambles up
The dog relentlessly barks and snaps as Tyrell climbs the fence
looks in at the dog angrily charging the chain-link
He looks up at Tyrell
Come on
Jump
've got you
He reaches out to try and catch Tyrell
Tyrell finally looses his grip and falls back, landing on top of Will
He rolls quickly to his feet
Thanks
(furious) gotta find me a pool boy
: 47
- Karla hammers the bag with a series of quick punches
She finally stops to catch her breath and hears a  from the other room
48
- Karla sticks her head out the door to the gym, listening
At the end of the hall is visible, a single   lighting the room
Karla moves curiously toward it
49
- Karla slowly sticks her head around the corner just as the She reacts -- in a small laundry room
Karla relaxes
(doing Julie) Gee, Karla
That'll break the machine
She approaches the , which is rocking with the noise
(cont'd) Damn
How many pairs you got in there
She opens the dryer door and jumps back
flies out and into her arms
She looks down a beat, and  bloody murder
hot spray of blood gushes from the machine
- ' tumbling inside the dryer
Karla  again
Then she hears the of heavy boots coming down the hall
She runs to the door and locks it
She's trapped in a bloody basement cell
Suddenly somebody  on the door
Karla
She runs across the room, shoving a folding table toward a row of The door is hit again and again
Somebody is throwing their shoulder against it
Karla bangs hysterically on the windows, leaving bloody handprints on the panes
: 50
- Julie's eyes suddenly open through the
She thumbs off her You say something
Nothing
And just as Julie lies down again, Karla's frantic echo down the hall
Julie goes to push open the canopy
As she does, the   is shoots through the handles
Julie is locked on the grill
(cont'd) Karla
Somebody
Hey, this isn't funny
Suddenly the lights go off
Julie thrashes around, trying to free herself
'  - She sees someone walking around in the room
The person steps closer
Julie could almost reach out and touch him
She begins to
51
- Tyrell angrily makes his way past the outdoor pool bar as Will follows
Tyrell spots a tray of empty bottles
He picks one up and smashes it in half on the ground
He holds out the jagged bottle to Will
Take this
And do what with it
Tyrell breaks another bottle in half
Julienne of pool boy
They move toward the nearby
52
- Tyrell and Will stop outside the door
There's  from inside
More Bob Marley -- "Lively Up Yourself
" (cont'd) 'm gonna throw the door
Get ready
Tyrell opens the door and charges in
Will's right behind him
53
- They spill into the room
light fog hangs in the air
The two of them begin to  and
Titus sits on the floor facing away from them, facing a window through which gray light pierces the gloom
Titus doesn't move
He's too still
In front of him is a large that still
Hey, pool boy
Tyrell closes the distance and kicks Titus in the back
Titus falls over like a block of wood, rictus already setting in
His hands are bound behind him
The cord is tied off to some pipes against the wall
into the floor, scrabbling for the window and fresh air
Will points out two empty one-gallon
One is labeled , the other
Will pulls Tyrell from the pool house
54
- The two of them collapse,  and
What the --
Will splashes a puddle of rainwater on his face -- That's chlorine and muriatic acid
Put the two together and you get cyanide
Tyrell rolls over on his back next to Will, practically coughing up a lung
Cyanide
Like poison gas
(reality dawning) You mean, somebody really killed him
Omigod
Think
Think
Suddenly, they both hear
They sprint for the main building
: 55
- Tyrell and Will follow Karla's  to a narrow srip of basement window which runs along the side of the hotel
Her palms have bloodied one of the windows
Get back -- 56
- Karla ducks down on the table just as the window  inward
Tyrell kicks in the pane and looks in
(cont'd) Give me your hand
She reaches for him
He pulls her up and out through the window
57
- Karla tumbles to the ground with only one thing to say
(screaming) Julie
: 58
- Tyrell and Will suddenly burst through the door
Where Julie is just visible, her fingers madly groping for a way out
Oh, God, get me out
Get me out
Will struggles to open the bed, but the chain holds strong
Tyrell grabs a nearby dumbbell
Hang on
Tyrell slams the barbell down, shattering the fiberglass handles
few of the ultraviolet tubes  as Will yanks up on the cover
They help Julie up, her eyes adjusting to non-purple light
(almost relieved) 'm not crazy
'm not crazy
He's here
(already moving for the door) We've got to get to the radio and call for help
think we can classify this as an emergency situation
They head for the manager's office
: 59
- '  - They burst into the middle of the room before seeing that Brooks's head has a machete sticking out of it
Yo, Brooks, listen up -- (reacting) Whoa -- Tyrell, Will, and Karla look at the radio, which is smashed on the floor next to Brooks
Julie stares in shock at the reverse wall, at with the words "  " written on it in blood
Karla  -- Somebody
is a sick, fingerpainting psycho
We gotta get out of here
Now
and the hotel plunges into darkness
Julie  and runs from the hotel
Julie
60
- Julie runs down the steps and cuts through the blowing palms
: 61
- Julie is at the end of the dock
Tears are streaming down her face, her chest heaving
The others catch up with her
Karla realizes the boats are gone
Everyone is freaking out
There were boats here
Refresh my memory, there were boats
Tyrell picks up the end of a cut mooring line -- They were cut loose
Julie
Wanna tell us what is going on here
They look at Julie
Their escape is cut off by water
They're scared
(freaking out) We're all going to die
He's going to kill us one by one
Who
Ben Willis
(not this again) Oh, stop it
He's dead
You killed him
Now, get over it
We gotta think here
They never found the body
Her voice is low and urgent, an impromptu confessional
(cont'd) Two summers ago
We lied to the authorities
We hit Ben Willis with our car
Ray, me, Barry, and Helen We threw the body in the water to cover it up -- Julie
Only he wasn't dead
He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth
Tyrell begins backing away from Julie
He picks up a piece of driftwood from the dock
(cont'd) thought Ray and  killed him on the boat, but we didn't and now he's back to finish up the job
Tyrell holds up the log as a weapon
He's angry and afraid -- We're on an island, miles from anywhere
don't give a crap about you're fisherman
There's dead bodies pilling up everywhere and there's one guy missing -- Will moves closer to Tyrell -- The porter
what's his name
Old Asbestos -- Estes
That's exactly who it is
That old guy knows something
We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first
Tyrell turns and heads down the dock
Will goes with him
Karla takes a few hesitant steps after them, then turns back toward Julie, who hasn't moved
Julie, we have to do something
Julie sees her friend caught in the middle, sees her suffering
She reluctantly starts for Karla -- (sotto) It's not him
: 62
- Standard bus folks: old people in Panama hats, buzz-cut military geeks on holiday
Ray sits in a seat
He's in pain and does not look good
He pops a handful of pills into his mouth and washes them down with an Orange Crush -- dignified   has been watching him -- People live healthy in Miami
(sincere, but unsettling) It's the future down there every day of the week
The future
Ray slumps back, waiting for the pills to work
'll keep that in mind
: 63
- The door to Estes's room  inward
Tyrell, Will, Karla, and Julie charge into the room
Yo, Freak Boy -- The cluttered room is empty
He's not here
Tyrell and Will begin roughly searching through Estes's possessions
We're gonna find some weird crap in here
In the corner there is a curtain used as a partition
Julie pulls the curtain back and discovers , sitting in the corner
It seems to glow from inside while casting an evil pall over the room
Julie moves toward it and hesitates before opening the doors
Inside -- is a small voodoo shrine
candle has burned low before it
Hanging before the altar is impaled on a fishhook
Voodoo
told you
Julie looks closer
She sees her toothbrush, a hair tie, assorted other knickknacks belonging to her friends
(to Karla) Missing a hair tie
Karla looks in
Tyrell snatches the straw man up
We found our guy
rumbles across the sky like the judgement of God
: 64
- Julie, Karla, Tyrell, and Will walk quickly down the corridor
They have grabbed some of their things
We gotta find flashlights, torches, guns if they got 'em, anything that'll help
Will and Tyrell eye the stairs leading down to the lobby
Wait
Maybe he's down there collecting the body parts
Will and Tyrell exchange a glance, an "are you man enough
" kind of glance
Let's go
65
- The men head into the kitchen and bar area
We'll only be a second, okay
Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place
Karla is terrified and waits by the stairs, but something catches Julie's eye
She walks across the lobby
Julie, where are you going
Julie keeps walking
She sees historical pictures of the hotel: work crews during construction; the first limbo contest; fishermen standing next to sailfish and marlin
Near the pictures, Julie sees the globe
It's spinning slowly
Julie hesitates, then walks toward the globe
It stops spinning
She looks down at it
- and Julie's hand finding Brazil
We see the capital is not Rio, but Brazilia
This is dawning on Julie when we hear -- (v
o
) Brasilia
She jumps out of her skin
Estes was standing right there in the shadows
(cont'd) That's the capital of Brazil, not Rio
Karla
Tyrell comes flying across the lobby past Karla
He dives on Estes, tackling him to the floor
Will is right behind him
// Let go
got him
That's me
It's him
We got you
Leave him alone
Tyrell holds up battered Estes -- Here's youre killer -- No -- We found your voodoo crap -- No -- They shake Estes, finally giving him a chance to speak
(cont'd) found the bodies this morning tried to use the radio, but he already destroyed it
Let him go
believe him
Come on, Julie
You saw his room
haven't hurt anyone
stole those things to help you
To protect you
He's telling the truth
He could've easily killed me
He didn't
(beat while this sinks in) Look, we didn't even answer the radio question right
This whole thing was a setup
What do you mean
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil
It was the wrong answer
Sorry, we lose
(starting to lose it) You've got all these theories but where is he
Where
Where's your fisherman killer
don't know
(losing it) You never do
The guy at the nightclub, the body in your room last night
Little notes that only mean something to you
How do we even know you're not the one behind this -- Estes steps forward -- (to Tyrell) How do we know you're not
(to Julie) know who you're talking about
He used to work here at the hotel
(beat) And 've seen him around again
Out in the woods by the orchard
They look at Estes
Is he telling the truth
can't remeber his name, but don't forget a face
(beseeching) can show you
They stare a beat -- How do we know you're not setting us up
Where else you gonna go, son
They look to the office, the gym
The sense of death surrounding them
know  don't want to stay in here
We'll be better off in the open
If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good
Show us
They begin moving for the door
: 66
- Establish
The rain pounds a fleet of fishing boats
The boats are securely battened down in the weather
Ray limps past, heading for a small building at the end of the dock
Its sign reads: Island Ferry, Jack Paulsen -- proprieter
: 67
'   - gear-strewn office
Paulsen watches an episode of Party of Five
There is a loud  at the door
What the
Paulsen slowly gets up
He cracks the door open
Ray stands silhouetted against the rain
need to get to Tower Bay Island
Paulsen senses something isn't right
We're closed
Ray pushes his way in -- need to get there, now
Paulsen looks at him standing there drenched
Did you happen to notice what's going on outside
Ray pulls out the gun and points it at Paulsen -- 'm not looking for a weather report, 'm looking for a boat
So which one's yours
: 68
- Estes, Will, Tyrell, Julie, and Karla walk along a trail through the heart of the island
The storm has abated for a few minutes
It's windy, dark, and spooky
The kind of place you'd take people if you wanted to scare them with a classic ghost story
That is just what Estes is doing
He worked here for many years
He had a nice family
pretty wife and two little ones
boy and a girl
They'd be about your age, now
They continue along the path
Estes looks at them in the dark, slowing for just a second
(cont'd) One day his wife went missing
Maid found blood all over the honeymoon suite -- Room 201
There are strange  out in the woods
(cont'd) Eventually, they found her body
Pieces
leg in the swamp
An arm washed up on Three Mile Beach
(beat) And the head they found much later
huge branch is blown from a tree and comes crashing down through the underbrush, scaring them
Estes calmly steps around it
(cont'd) Careful -- (softly) Did he do it
People say she was running around on him
People say he caught her in bed with other men
People say a lot of things
(beat) He disappeared, taking the two small ones with him
At least they were never found
The winding path leads to a small orchard
They hang on his every word
(cont'd) We're here
In the center of the orchard is a cemetery
They move off the path into the safety of the woods
There seems to be activity around the place
It's silent and eerie
Julie stares, fascinated
She is slowly drawn toward the house
Karla grabs for her arm
Be careful, Julie
've got to see
She leads, they follow, circling the house
Julie rounds a corner of the shack and stops
She sees -- The first stone reads:   (birth/death) The second stone reads:   (birth/death) Beyond them and the group moves slowly toward it
The headstone, partially obscured by the mound of dirt, comes into view
The third headstone reads: born September 6, 1979 died July 4, 1998 " Lying Whore" " Lying Whore" is scratched with a knife
(realizing) Today's July fourth
Will goes to comfort Julie -- 'm not dying on this island, Will
(louder) Do you hear me
Julie shouts into the darkness
(cont'd) You want me, Ben Willis
Come and get me
'm right here
She kicks over her headstone -- (cont'd) My grave stays empty
She looks defiantly down the path
Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down
There's no way off this place
Then, we fight -- Will looks around
Estes is gone
Where'd Estes go
What is up with that weirdo
'll go find him
Why
He can't help us
He's probably the only one who can help us
'll come with you
Are you crazy
We're not staying here on our own
It's okay
He couldn't have gone far
'll catch up with you later
Will disappears into the darkness
Maybe we should just wait here
Hide in a tree
'm not hiding up no tree
(to Julie) 'm with her
Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt
: 69
- They move cautiously into the kitchen
Blue emergency lights flicker above them
It's a big room with plenty of nooks and crannies for somebody to be hiding in
Tyrell picks up a couple of different knives
He hefts them in his hand
What  need is a gun
Not a steak knife
Karla grabs a paring knife -- (cont'd) You gonna clean vegetables
You gonna stir-fry
You need something that'll get his attention
He picks up a huge butcher's knife and cuts the air with it
He then roughly empties other drawers looking for more weapons
Karla looks to Julie, something on her mind
Julie catches the look
(hurt) 'm your best friend
You could have told me the truth about what happened
would've understood
(sad) Karla,  just wanted the whole thing to be over
didn't want to involve anybody else
It's too late for that
Julie steps over to Karla
'm so sorry
brought this on everyone
It's my fault
Tyrell picks up on the mood swing
He moves closer to them
He's sympathetic
Forget that
You didn't do nothing
This fisherman's a piece of scum
(hard for him to admit) should've been listening to you
'm sorry
Julie smiles for a second
(cont'd) Now, let's take a look at the pantry
You think that's a good place to hide
don't know, but 'm starving
: 70
- Will runs from the trees and finds himself by an old house
He sees Estes by the ocean, near a boat
Hey Estes
(beat) Estes
Where'd you go
Estes doesn't answer right away -- he keeps his back to Will
(cont'd) You abandoning us
How come you didn't tell us you had a boat
Estes picks up the boat's oar
He speaks low, almost inaudibly
This has to end
Now
What --
Estes swings the oar, cracking Will's head hard
: 71
- Tyrell, Julie, and Karla approach the pantry -- a huge steel door
72
- Tyrell steps inside
Steel door
Food
Perfect
He starts looking for something to eat -- There's a soft  from somewhere in the room
Everyone freezes, staring into the darkness
Tyrell puts a finger to his lips, then creeps down an aisle, listening
There's nothing but
He moves toward the first aisle
He jumps out
The aisle is empty
move down an aisle behind him
Tyrell ducks around to the second aisle
He slices the air, ready to pounce
This aisle is empty
nervously move another aisle down
Tyrell moves stealthily toward the third aisle
This is it
He lunges forward into the row
Empty, also
There's a small
scampers off under the shelves
Tyrell turns and smiles at Karla and Julie -- It's just a -- bashes him on the back of the head
Tyrell hits the floor, unconscious
Ty
jumps down from the shelves
Tyrell puts his arms up -- (yelling for mercy) Don't kill me -- Wait, it's Nancy -- Nancy, the bartender steps out of the shadows brandishing her rolling pin
: 73
- Tyrell stands at the sink, where Karla holds a towel full of ice to his head
Nancy, the bartender, looks on apologetically
'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this -- And so could you -- crazy fool
You stumbled into my hiding place
Must have missed the sign
Excuse me, but this island didn't have a murder rate until you people showed up
(chilled) 've never seen a dead body before
Get used to it
Who's doing this
(friendly) Don't even get her started
It's a long, long story and you probably wouldn't believe a word of it
Tyrell moves as he talks, fed up and exhasted
He crosses past the stove and under a huge hanging rack of pots and pans
(cont'd) mean, all  know for sure is this is the worst vacation of my life
'm tired, and 'm hungry, and personally haven't seen one damn psycho killer
sinks deep into the base of Tyrell's shaved skull, a look of abject surprise on his face
The women freeze as Tyrell dances like a marionette before being hoisted up and hung on the rack like a used saucepan
is in the vent above the stove
He stares out at them from the hood of his slicker
Ben jumps from the range onto the floor
Karla is in shock
Julie yanks her and they flee
As she goes, Julie picks up and hides it in her back pocket
: 74
- Ray pilots the boat through the dark, choppy water
He's navigating by compass, maps spread before him
He sees something off the bow -- drifting on the fast sea
The words "Tower Bay" are painted on the side
Ray pulls alongside and discovers the boat is empty
He reaches for the radio
(into radio) Come in
This is Summer Breeze requesting emergency assistance for Tower Bay island
repeat
This is Summer Breeze
Ray guns the boat away
: 75
- Julie, Karla, and Nancy run into the lobby
The storm is outside the front doors
They pause for a second
Behind them we hear the rapid -- of Ben's boots
Nancy goes straight to a desk and pulls out a flashlight
She points to the main staircase
know where we can hide
76
- The women run up the stairs
Behind them, we hear Ben's echoing
77
- On the top floor, they race toward the end of a dark hallway
At the far end of the hall, Nancy illuminates a section of the ceiling
Give me a boost up -- Julie helps Nancy reach a pull cord in the ceiling
pulls down
Nancy quickly climbs up
enters the hallway and continues toward them
Karla slips, nearly knocking Julie to the floor
They both scramble upwards -- Ben hits the ladder -- Just as Julie reaches the top rung she  -- '
Nancy appears in the opening and throws a brick down at Ben
It hits him in the chest and knocks him back
Julie makes it into the attic
They pull the ladder up behind them like a drawbridge
78
- Julie, Karla, and Nancy surround the hatch they've just shut
They fumble with it -- There's no way to lock it
What do we do
From below comes
There's a tug on the hatch, cracking it open
The girls pull it back shut, but it's hard to get a grip
There's more tugging, the hatch bending down; they can see Ben
Then, the rope
The hatch slams shut
There's no way to grip this thing
Suddenly the   of the  pokes through the crack
It wriggles around
Turning
And begins to pull the hatch down
They try to hold it
But it's no use
They let go and jump away
The attic is lit by a cathedral window
It's crosshatched with wooden beams and pink insulation
Watch your step
Karla's foot goes through a gap between two beams
: 79
-   '  - ' dangles through the ceiling
: 80
- Julie helps Karla back up onto a beam
(cont'd) Stay on the beams
Karla and Julie follow her precarious progress
Ben climbs off the ladder to a beam
He watches them leap from beam to beam
His hook glints in the light
Julie, Karla, and Nancy move toward the cathedral window
They turn
They are cut off
They spread out against the wall looking for an opening to get back to the hatch
Ben feints toward Nancy then swipes at Julie -- He misses
She leaps away
She looks down
Instead of insulation, she sees a She sees her bed through a one-way mirror
Julie stares, momentarily transfixed
Karla is edging her way around the side of Ben
(re: the mirror) You'd be amazed by what you'd see
My wife with every man on the island, for example
(to Julie) And you, sexy
loved watching you
You sick freak
Ben suddenly whirls and lunges at Karla
He grabs her, but they both lose their balance, teetering for a moment on one of the beams, before falling -- They  through the mirror -- 81
-   '  - Karla and Ben hit the bed in a rain of glass
Karla bounces to her feet and dives out of the way as Ben swings his hook
82
- Karla backs onto the porch
She backs up against the railing
: 83
- Julie and Nancy reach the
They open it and look out
84
- '  - and Ben advancing toward Karla, whose back is against the railing
Karla looks behind her, sees which doesn't look nealy strong enough to suppor her
Ben advances, swining the hook
Karla leaps over the railing and onto the glass
85
- Karla keeps a wary eye on Ben as she gingerly backs up on the glass
The  begins , subtle crack lines splintering out from her footsteps
Ben lunges and swipes at her with his hook
Karla leans away from the attack and loses her balance, slipping onto her back on the glass
She lifts her head
Starts to move
The glass is fracuring beneath her
She looks through the glass
'  - She tries to slide toward a support
The glass  and  as she moves across the room
(to herself) Oh, god, no -- She's almost to the support when taking Karla down into the orchid house
86
- The roof shatters in an explosion of flying glass
Karla land on her back
She's unconsious -- : 87
- Julie and Nancy look at the empty space which once was a roof supporting Karla -- (screaming) Karla
Ben turns and looks up at Nancy and Julie
Then, he sprints from the balcony
Julie and Nancy duck back into the attic
: 88
- Julie and Nancy climb down into the hallway
They are cautious, expecting Ben at every turn
89
- They hurry across the lobby
: 90
- sprawling, steam-filled room, dense with vegetation of all sorts and shelf after shelf of beautiful orchids
Karla lies unconscious
Slowly, she opens her eyes
There's a rustling in the flowers
She tries to get up, but can't yet
She waits in terror as fly up and out of the hole she's made in the roof
Karla tries to stand and her leg gives way
She tests her knee -- Oww
Karla starts hobbling
She reaches the door -- it's locked from the other side
There is a thick glass window set in the middle of the door
The cranes startle again, something upsetting them
Karla spins to look
Nothing
: 91
/  - Julie and Nancy arrive at the door
Karla pounds on the other side -- points to the lock
It's locked
Nancy sees a   by the door
It's gotta be one of these
Nancy tries the first of many keys
Something catches Julie's eye
She moves in for a closer look
Her eyes go wide -- - ' powerful    cracks
Fills the room with a pulse of bright light
' (terrified) He's inside
Karla spins
Sees him
Her terrified scream blends with the cranes, now
Please
Hurry
92
/  - Nancy fumbles with the keys
Drops them
Julie tries to keep calm
Come on
93
/  - Ben closes fast, slicing the tops off orchids as he goes
He skewers a bud on the tip of his hook
Karla pounds on the door
(frantic) Hurry
Nancy fumbles for the right key but the lock is old
Nancy
(crying) It's jammed
The key is stuck
(through glass) Come on
She's running out of time
Julie sees a   encased in the glass safety box
(determined) No way
Julie smashes the glass with her elbow
Grabs the axe
(to Nancy) Move
Julie hammers the door with the axe
Wood splinters
Glass cracks
Ben is almost on top of Karla now
Julie swings
The axe breaks the glass, pulls the frame out
Julie drops the axe
They grab Karla
Pull her through
Ben swings
The hook rips Karla's shoe, but Julie and Nancy pull her through
Julie and Ben are face to face
Julie has the axe in her hands
She stares him down
Come on, gimme a shot -- Ben rips off his hook, eyeing Julie
(shouting) Julie, come on
They flee
Ben tries the door, realizes it had locked behind him
He can't fit through the circular window
He throws his shoulder against the door
And again
And again
The door frame starts to give -- : 94
- Julie, Karla, and Nancy approach the iron door to the underground storm cellar
Julie carries the axe
It's over there
They struggle together to open the heavy door
95
- Stairs lead down into darkness
Karla hesitates -- don't know
Come on, you can make it
Julie gets in, pulling Karla in behind her
They pull the door closed behind them
There's a light somewhere
96
- The darkness is complete
We hear
Julie
'm right here
Grab my hand
This place has emergency power
Just ease you way down the stairs and 'll find the light
Okay
'm at the bottom
Karla, just get my hand
'm holding your hand
No, you're not
Nancy
Nancy pulls the chain on an overhead bulb
The lights go on, illuminating of Brooks, Derrick, Olga, and Titus -- whose hand Karla is holding
The women
They muddle together, trying to collect themselves
Suddenly, there is a  on the iron door
They
Then, Julie remembers the axe
She motions the others to stay back -- All right -- The iron hatch is slowly opening
Julie gets the axe into possition -- pokes his head through
He's clutching a piece of wood as a weapon
It's you guys, thank god
Is everyone okay
They are ecstatic to see him
They bound up the concrete stairs -- Help's here
Help's here
97
- Will is already on the move toward the hotel
Come on
We're gonna be okay
Did you get help
Will shakes his head
He's walking woozily
(cont'd) What happened
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook
He's in it with Willis
guess so
Julie points out that his chest and stomach are covered in blood, too
Your stomach, you're hurt -- Will looks down, clutches himself, and keeps moving
When  was coming back  saw your slicker friend looking for you guys down by the water
(beat) Let's hurry and get inside
: 98
- Ray guns the boat straight up onto the beach
He leaps from the boat
: 99
- Will slumps down on the bar floor
He's floating in and out of consciousness
Julie leans over him, concerned
Oh, my god, you're bleeding to death
She looks back towards Nancy -- (cont'd) We need a first-aid kit
(already moving) saw one in the lobby
Karla starts, then hesitates
Will moans, looks at her
(cont'd) 'll come with you
You'll be okay
It's over
Karla and Nancy rush from the bar
Julie looks tenderly at Will
He looks back at her
She pulls some hair off his forehead
He smiles weakly
Will, just hold on
We'll get you fixed up
: 100
- Karla and Nancy go to the area near the check-in and behind the desk
Look up there
'll look over here
Karla looks behind the desk
Nancy is searching the shelves
: 101
- Julie tenderly searches the area around Will's stomach
She's fussing with the clothes, looking for the wound
You've got blood everywhere, but can't find the wound
Will takes her head in his hands, looks her in the eye
That's because it's not my blood
The slow change in Julie as she realizes
She starts to run
Will roughly grabs her
(cont'd) It's time you woke up, Julie
His voice switches to that of a familiar radio disk jockey
(cont'd) (as Mark in the Morning) He drags her out of the bar
: 102
- Nancy sees a white metal box sitting on a shelf
She reaches for it
It's a first aid kit
reaches over and lands on top of her hand
She jumps and sees Estes right behind her
Karla
Will
He's in on it
He's -- Suddenly Estes's expression changes to surprise, and appears in the front of his chest
Nancy screams and looks over Estes's shoulder to see standing there holding a spear gun
Estes topples over on top of Nancy, pinning her underneath his dying, convulsing body
Nancy struggles to get loose
Help me
Karla rushes to Nancy
She tugs on her arm, trying to pull her free
The fisherman strides toward them
He raises his hook
He swings at Karla's head
on a beam
Karla struggle with Nancy
Come on, come on
Ben tries to free his hook hand
Karla looks up at him
He calmly puts his foot onto Estes's back and steps down with all of his weight, driving deep into Nancy who expires with a sigh
(cont'd) Damn you
Karla, blind with rage, attacks the fisherman
He kicks out with a boot and sends Karla fying onto in the lobby area
The table explodes
Karla is finished
The fisherman works his hook free from the post
Karla is unmoving and looks quite dead
: 103
- Will pulls Julie along a muddy path in the rain
He's got her by the hair
She's slipping and falling
Look at the bright side, Jules
We finally get to spend some quality time together
Julie's trying to get to the knife she's stashed in her back pocket
Why are you doing this to me
Me, me, me
It's always about you
'm having bad dreams
can't sleep
'm not doing well in school
'm having trouble with my boyfriend
trusted you
We had a connection, didn't we can tell you one thing, though
Ray didn't trust me
He was right
He's dead, but he was right
They come into the orchard
They are covered in mud
Julie stumbles again
Goes to her knees
Works the knife free and slashes up at Will
She slices him across the face
He steps back, feels the blood
(cont'd) What'd you have to do that for
There is a creepy pause
Will stares at his own blood
She catches her breath
Then suddenly, Will knocks the knife from her hand
He lifts her by the hair
Enraged, he puches her in the face
She goes down
: 104
- Will has Julie in a choke hold
He drags her toward the open graves
Julie is losing energy, slowly giving up
Why
Why
Come on, Julie
Think
You'll get it
Will Benson -- Ben's son
He shoves her
She falls backward into the arms of Ben Willis
(cont'd) Hi, Dad
Julie , struggling wildly in Ben's grasp
-- That's my boy
Ben holds her back to look at her
He throws back the hood of his slicker
We see his face clearly for the first time
No, no, no -- Ben pulls off his hook and strokes Julie's cheek with his stump
Shush, now
No more screaming
No more running
Time to die
(v
o
) Let go of her
Now
Ben and Will spin to see like the hero from a western, step out from behind a tree
Ben starts to laugh
Will joins him
You gotta be kiddin' me
What're you gonna do, boy
Call us names
Let her go
Now
Ray raises the
38 caliber handgun
He  the hammer
Ben doesn't let go of Julie
Lightning fast, he slaps his hook back on and gets the point to Julie's neck
Think about it, boy
You're no killer
(beat) That's my job
Ray hesitates, his finger on the trigger
He does look scared
Ben takes a step toward Ray
Then another, pushing Julie in front of him
Will moves closer, too
Stop right there
Ray's finger squeezing down the trigger
You don't have it in you
Suddenly, Will dives for Ray
Ray gets a shot off, tagging Ben in the shoulder
The gun goes flying
Julie spins and hits Ben in the face
He knocks her into her own grave
Mud begins to slide in on her
She tries to scramble out
Will and Ray wrestle, punching each other repeatedly in the face
Will has Ray down and his hands around his kneck
He looks him in the eye
We haven't missed you down here, Ray boy
got to know Julie real well
Will gets the better of Ray
He's stronger
He yanks him up -- choking him
Ray is begging to check out
(cont'd) Think of all the things 'm gonna do to her
(beat) Dad, finish him
Ben charges toward Ray's back
He pulls back the hook for a roundhouse slashing -- At the last second, Ray dips, elbows Will
goes straight into Will's chest
The fisherman has hooked his own son
Father and son make final eye contact, the son's eyes go blank
Ben stares in shock as Will expires, falling back into the mud
Ben  in rage
Ray is tired
Ben begins beating Ray
He puches him
He straight-arms him with the hook
He knocks him again and again and Ray is beaten, giving up
Ben has Ray against a tombstone
The hook slowly inches toward his eye
Gonna blind you first
The hook is touching the eyelid -- rings out
look of wonder crosses Ben's face
He slowly turns away from Ray
stands behind him holding the gun
Just
Die
She empties the gun into Ben, who flies backward into Julie's grave
As he tumbles, Ben releases the dirt stacked beside the grave
slowly covers Ben up
Ben's face is covering over
His mouth starting to fill with dirt -- You can't kill me
His face is completely covered
His mouth still moving
(cont'd) 'll always be with you
The dirt covers him
It continues to fill, until just the waves futilely out of the dirt
Then, is stops wiggling
Julie goes to Ray
: 105
- Ray and Julie limp across the grounds of the hotel
They are moving past some shrubbery when jumps out
Julie yells
She and Ray jump back
stops in the middle of her kamikaze attack, knife held out
Oh, god, it's you -- You're okay
Thank god
Is he
They nod
They go to her -- jubilant group hug time
They compose themselves
(cont'd) You know, it's true what they say about package vacations
You get what you pay for
(beat) Now, how about we get off this piece of crap island
The first rays of the morning sun appear
Ray looks adoringly at Julie as the beautific light catches her face
Ray kisses her
She kisses him back
They are silhouetted against a beautiful orange sunrise
(smiling) We don't have to tell anyone it rained the whole time
It can just be our little secret
The three of them throw their arms around each other's shoulders and they start walking for the beach as
rises into view
: 106
- Establish
The sun setting over a quaint street in a college town
: Julie pedals her bicycle down the street
She has a book bag over her shoulder
It feels like one of the first days of school
She rides the bike up to a small house on the perfect street
She rolls the bike right up to the front door
: 107
- Julie lets herself into the house
She leans her bike against another bike in the hallway
It's a perfect day
Birds
in the willows
There's another
from inside her house
She goes perfectly still
And listens
Behind her, by the kitchen, the shadow of a  moves
She whirls
She creeps down the hallway toward her kitchen
She pauses -- The dark figure almost knocks into her
She
It's Ray
He's holding a disemboweled toaster
Ray
what are you doing
(toaster) Oh
it's not working right
You're home early
(sees she's shaken) Did  scare you
Never do that again
(tender) Hey --  didn't know you were here
It's okay
(beat) We got the refrigerator in
Come see
She sees the love in his eyes
She hugs him
love it here
It's gonna be great
: 107A
- Julie climbs to the top of the stairs
She passes Ray in the bathroom
She pauses in the doorway -- 107B
- Ray is at the sink in boxer shorts
He's using an electric Waterpic devicice that has just been opened, a gift from the party
It makes a low  sound
(seeing her) Checking the locks again
You know me to well
Julie smile and walks to the bedroom
: 107C
- Julie climbs into bed with a book
The bedroom is clean and orderly
The windows are closed
The closet door is shut
The room is decorated simply: a high antique bed; unopened boxes; a highboy; an antique mirror leaning against the wall
stuffed bear sits in a chair
There is a  from another room
Julie freezes
She waits
She hears it again
She climbs out of bed
: 107D
- Julie walks into the dark spare bedroom
The   comes from the open window
The wind is blowing the blinds
Julie relaxes
She shuts the window
As she leaves the room, we notice the dirty imprint of a boot below the window
107E
- Julie passes Ray who is still absorbed with the new toy
Behind him, the door softly closes
The lock twists
Ray is oblivious, happy being the dental-hygene pacesetter of the household
107F
- Julie enters the room
She looks at the closet door
It is open a crack
She hesitates, trying to remember if it was open before -- it wasn't
Julie approaches the closet
She catches her refelction in the mirror next to the closet
She peers into the crack of the closet
She can't see anything
She throws open the closet door
She looks around the room
What is my problem
She sits down on the bed
We see her bare feet from under the bed
She smiles, relaxes
She looks in the mirror leaning against the wall
Something has caught her eye
She freezes
She turns slowly back to the reflection in the mirror
She sees the glint of steel -- --     -- Julie turns too late -- The fisherman lunges out and grabs her legs
Julie screams
She goes down -- Her nails scrape into the wooden floor as she is dragged under the bed
