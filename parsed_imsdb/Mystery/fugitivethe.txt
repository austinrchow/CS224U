- The Man hands his coat to coat check woman and thanks her
When he turns we get our first view of
, a tall, athletic man, with a trim beard
He moves from the outer lobby into a fabulously decorated ballroom where a fashion show is taking place as a medical fundraiser
Doctors and their spouses, hospital brass and sponsors mingle
Women sit near the runway watching the models
Men talk by the bar
The room is packed
banner over the rostrum says: "' " Kimble is handed a glass of champagne, which he promptly sets on another waiter's passing tray
(
) Richard
, a large surgeon, pulls Kimble over to a group of surgeons gathered around a bar
Smoking cigars
Cancun
Nat just talked everybody into it
hospital equipment rep, , is buying drinks
So, what's the deal
If the hospital buys ten new - No, no, no, no strings attached, Dr
Kimble
Industrial Hospital Supply has no ulterior motives
On the house, huh
(to bartender) Tonic water with lime
Everyone agrees
Never get me to sell my soul for one of those trips
His tone silences the group
Kimble takes his drink
(to Nat) But if you get any more Bulls tickets, Nat, give me a call
The group laughs, Kimble extracts himself and - : Moving through the crowd
: Nearly gets hit in the follow-through of an imaginary golf swing
You're slicing, Dave
Don't turn your hip
He keeps moving
Thanks, Richard
: - - , totally out of her element amid the formal elegance around her
She wears a leather jacket over -shirt and stares at the action on the fashion runway
(dripping sarcasm) 'm so glad you talked me into coming, Richard
can pick my cruise wardrobe
It's for a good cause, Kath
Besides you need to get out of the lab more
Your electron microscope is starting to give you a tan
She smiles
He moves on
- Kimble continues down the bar when he spots a friend
Hey, Jim
turns, smiles
Mid-40s, head of the University Hospital
He is a fit contemporary
Richard,  just saw someone who wanted to meet you
Just then Kimble spots an attractive , late thirties, wearing a drop-dead, simple black gown
She's surrounded by a group of men hanging on her every word
She and Kimble catch a look and hold it
(
) Richard Kimble
Alex Lentz
Alex is working on the RDU90 trials for Devlin-Macgregor
Kimble turns to meet
, late 30s, tan, smiling
Lentz extends his hand
Dr
Kimble
Sorry, we've been trading phone calls last few days something about a biopsy report returned to you
(suddenly attentive) Yeah
Three
Livers appeared hepatetic to me
'll be in my office in the morning and 'll pull up the samples
Is that a good time for you
Sure
(holds Kimble's look, then to Nichols) See you, Jim
Lentz moves on
Kimble looks after him a beat, then focuses on relocating the Woman he just saw
She's gone
He and Nichols move together through the party
(digs in his pocket) Before  forget,  went by the garage this afternoon and picket up the Ferrari
Thanks for the loaner again
He hands Kimble a valet ticket
They fix it this time
We'll see
They reach the Woman Kimble saw, his wife,
Kimble kisses her
You look fabulous, Helen
He kisses Helen
() Hello, Jim
(to Kimble) We've got a court tomorrow at three
Nichols leaves
Kimble looks at his wife
Well, 've seen everyone, can we leave
That would be a little abrupt, don't you think
: - '  - table for ten
Kimble and Helen introduce themselves to others at table ant sit across from each other
Kimble sits between two doctors' wives
One,   , mid-thirties, bedecked in jewels and loud dress, the other Helen sits between their husbands who are trying to impress her with the details of their boring studies as the fashion, catches of dialog and course changes, Kimble and Helen demonstrate an oft-used exchange of glances: Kimble, while gracious to his dinner partners, catches Helen's eye and makes smiling, subtle movements to his watch or a look to the door to indicate he's clearly ready to leave
On the receiving end, Helen, the gatekeeper of their social propriety, indicates with equal subtlety: "not yet
" As we   the table we hear: "Where's your husband on staff
" "My husband's an orthopod at Northwestern
" "'m working on a new technique
" "That's fascinating
" "That's quite a marvelous dress you're wearing
" "Do you like it
My husband says it's a 'four-fracture number
"' "Honey
" ( look from her husband
) Kimble shares a look with Helen
He subtly motions to his watch: time go to, and mouths the word: "now
" She shakes her head
(to table) told my husband that he was going to kill us if he didn't stop operating
What with this  thing, he's putting us all at risk
Helen and Kimble absorb this comment without reaction, share a look
Helen mouths the word: "Now
" (to her dinner partners) 'm sorry,  have to get my husband home
They say their good-byes and pass Nichols' table
Nichols shakes his friend's hand in passing
From across the room we see Lentz watching
'  - Kimble and Helen driving home
She runs her fingers through his hair as he drives
You looked handsome tonight
Thank you
He smiles to himself, seems to enjoy the compliment too much for Helen
Her smile becomes playful, mischievous
Uh, huh
most men in a tuxedo look like waiters
But me
You looked more like
a band director
He stops at red light, leans over and kisses her
Light changes and neither notice
Slowly their kiss breaks
Are we home yet
: '  - Kimble pulls up in front of his house
Suddenly both his and    at the same time
(to phone) Dr
Kimble (suddenly attentive) When
Okay, tell them 'll be there in ten minutes
He hangs up
Tim's got a problem
Helen kisses him again, opens the door
Call me on your way home
as we - : -  /   - Kimble, wearing scrubs but without head gear, moves down stairs to the  hall
He sticks his head into the operating room
Cavalry's here
Two harried surgeons look up, glad to see him
Kimble begins scrubbing as the  comes out to bring him up to speed
Patient is a male, forty-three
We pulled his gall bladder and the bleeding started
What's his pro time
(concerned) He's at 36 seconds
We got a major bleeder in here
You talk to the family
None
He's off the street
: -   - Operation in progress
Top medical facility filled with trained professionals and state of the art equipment
Kimble is assisted across the table by the chief Resident
Both working so intently they never look at each other as they talk

Can he tolerate it
He's a very sick guy
Do we have a choice
Go for it
Marie, give me a clamp
, the scrub nurse, passes him the instrument and Kimble and the other  continue to work with the Resident assisting
(never looking up) Your husband know you're here tonight, Marie
What about this liver
History's sketchy
Could be an alcoholic
Who referred him
He's on a drug protocol
RDU90
Kimble looks up and shares a look with the chief Resident over their masks, then back to work
The wave of the future
Marie, you told Frank yet
Frank is so jealous of this late night thing we've got going here
This should hold him
Bleeding's stopped
Let's get a biopsy
(to circulating nurse) Send it downstairs and make sure you get Kath her slice
You staying for the closing, Rich
Kimble moves away and sheds his gloves and gown
No

- Kimble throws away his hat and mask
The door opens behind him; it is the other Surgeon
Hey, Richard
Kimble turns
Thanks
: '  - Kimble driving through empty Chicago streets toward home
He is on phone, waits for answer
Hi
'm five minutes away
: '  - Helen on the phone, downstairs
She is still in her gown with an afghan around her shoulders
She's been reading
'm glad it went well
'll see you in a minute
Helen hangs up phone, turns out the light and starts up the stairs
: - Kimble driving
-  -   - Helen moves down the hall toward the dressing room/closet
Opens the door to large closet dressing room and turns on the light
Nothing
She starts to leave and decides to close one of the interior closet doors
She starts to slide the door closed when - wham
hand reaches out and clutches her by the neck
Helen claws and scratches to get free and in her struggle her string of pearls bursts
and a single pearl bounces out of the bedroom
rolls across the landing to the stairs, stopping three steps from the top
: '  - Snow swirls around the street as Kimble's car pulls into the driveway
On the third floor, we see a bedroom light still on
'  - softly
Kimble tosses his keys on the entry table, picks up a stack of mail on the table and calls up the stairs

It's quiet
Too quiet
He notices a lampshade on the floor
- Kimble moves slowly to the opened doorway
And just before he enters he sees a large form in the crack behind the door
Adrenal surge
Kimble slams the door back on the figure knocking the gun free
Before Kimble can move to it a forearm flattens him
The attacker immediately goes for the gun
Kimble grabs a leg and twists him down, the man's fingers hit the gun, sending it skittering across the hardwood floor of the landing and over the edge - three flights to the entry hall below
can be heard
Distant but
The man kicks free and tries to flee
This time Kimble catches an arm and twists it at an unnatural angle
To his shock, the limb detaches between the shoulder and elbow
Kimble looks at the arm in his hands - it's hollow
Electrodes are visible inside - then to the man's unreadable face
The  are
Before Kimble can recover, the One-Armed Man knocks Kimble down and grabs back his arm
He runs down the stairs
Kimble pulls himself up and starts to follow but is stopped by a  behind him in the bedroom

Sees the necklace of bruises where she was held down and choked
And then a bullet wound in her leg
She's already going into shock
Her speech turns thick
Hang on, babe
going to be all right
Her fingernails dig into Kimble's arm, trying to hold on
My head

Her eyes slip away from his
He peels away the hand on her head - and sees raw pummeled brain staring back and realizes she won't be all right

Kimble watches him write something down, he slides it to Kelly
-  ""    ' (
) Your wife was loaded wasn't she

Kimble looks up at the two cops
For the first time he seems to sense something aggressive in their questioning
They no longer seem on the same team
What's going on here
This guy was trying to rob us
The two cops stare at Kimble
You guys have got to be out of your minds

It's powerful taken out of context
Dr
Nichols
You are aware that Richard Kimble was the only beneficiary of Helen Kimble's estate
12 million dollars roughly
was aware of that
The money meant nothing to him
Yet in your presence, Richard Kimble once said that 'if he had Helen's money he could find plenty of uses
' Did he not
We were talking about - Yes or no
Nichols' look tells us everything
Yes
: On the stand
The wound to the head caused a massive hemorrhage to the brain

And  was holding her when the officers came in
Gutherie returns to his seat
The Prosecutor moves to the jury
He begins slowly but his questions pick up strength
How tall was this man, Dr
Kimble
can't be sure
We were, mostly on the floor, fighting
couldn't - Did that fight cause the scratches on your face and arms
No
As  explained - And how did this man enter your house
don't know - And you probably don't know why your wife told the emergency operator You were her attacker
She didn't - Your name is Richard, isn't it
Your gun is a
38, isn't it
Your prints were on the gun, the bullets, the lamp, her neck, weren't they
Look
Weren't they
: - Richard Kimble sits behind the desk, but already he's a shadow of the man we knew before, stares ahead passively as Judge Bennett delivers the sentencing to hushed courtroom
After careful and studied review of all evidence presented during each phase of this proceeding, and because aggravated circumstances, detailed at length, were present the night of January 20th
Kimble is silent, stunned, but all around him the sentence shockwaves through the courtroom
Reporters push out rear doors
Prosecutors share a look - with a hangman's satisfaction
Nichols, watching behind Kimble's table, lowers his head
Disbelief
He remains silent
Kimble is pulled gently to his feet by bailiff
Gutherie whispers an "'m sorry
" Kimble doesn't hear it
(
) Therefore, it is the decision of this court
Looks over his shoulder to the emptying courtroom
Faces stare back

Inside, a profusion of chrome and nickel plating

Feedin' time
Old Guard yawns to his feet, unhooks a key-ring from his belt
Young Guard stows his shotgun in the weapons locker
#2 looks at Kimble
Kimble stirs awake
watches the cage door open, Young Guard moving back
And across the aisle
#3, a big man named , wags his head between his knees
Something slides out of his shirt and to the dimpled steel floor
It's a razor sharp plastic shank
Heart quickening, Kimble looks forward
Young Guard is handing a petrified sandwich to Prisoner #1
Kimble snaps a look back to Copeland, who palms the shank
Breathe, and you're first
Old Guard watches from the open cage door, shotgun carelessly ready
Young Guard reaches Kimble and extends a sandwich
Kimble doesn't respond
Suit yourself
He offers the sandwich to Copeland
In the exchange, sandwich drops
Copeland leans down for it
Up front, Old Guard yawns again just as
Look out
Too late
Jackknifing up, Copeland drives the shank into Young Guard's gut
Prisoner #2 dives for Young Guard's holster
As the gun comes out, Young Guard gets a hand on it
Jolting Old Guard
He chambers his shotgun
Kimble hits the floor
The Old Guard jams a key into the cage door and surges inside, but

Copeland drops down behind a seat
Old Guard jams his  under the seat
But just as the Old Guard pulls the trigger the bus jerks
The  goes off target as

up the slope and  down on its side - sliding to a stop at the bottom of a small ravine
- Dusty silence
We don't know up from down
On his knees, Old Guard makes his way to the driver
Finds him dead
Now a
Old Guard whips his shotgun around at
Kimble
Rising between the seats

Old Guard might kill him just to finish things off
But a  turns Old Guard's head
Young Guard, trying to hold his guts in
Old Guart turns to find Kimble

You're a doctor

He slides to the Young Guard as the Old Guard scrounges up a medical kit, shoves Kimble down on Young Guard
Do something
Kimble looks at his cuffs
"In these

Kimble opens medical kit
It's been ransacked - just Band-Aids now
Kimble looks into the wound
He isn't going to make it unless he gets to a hospital
Fast
In this delicate moment a  runs through the bus
Is it just settling
With other things to worry about, Kimble tries to stop Young Guard's bleeding
We see Copeland, alive
The crash has ripped the bars from a back window and shattered the glass
He works to get out the opening
second  ripples through the bus, stronger
Kimble retracts his hands to touch a metal panel - and feels a growing vibration
Just where the hell are we
The Old Guard feels it too
He gets down on his knees and looks out one of the shattered, barred windows
Oh, shit
- The bus lies across railroad tracks
not-too-distant bend grows bright by the light of an approaching train
- Kimble sees: Old Guard fights the cage door
Kimble lunges to his side
It's locked
Where're your keys
- Downtrack, one Cyclops light appears
- Kimble spots keys
Pitches them to Old Guard
Drags Young Guard to the front for a quick exit
But Old Guard fumbles the key-ring, his hands shaking as much as the bus
The train light spider-webs across cracked windows
Kimble snatches the keys away from the Guard's trembling hands
Which one
This
This one
Old Guard gulps a nod
Kimble jams a key in the lock
Throws the door open
Grabs Young Guard
Help me get him - But Old Guard climbs right over Kimble's back and climbs out the shattered windshield
Copeland escapes through the hole in the back
- and hits the ground running the other way
The locomotive's headlight reveals the toppled bus
- Train light grows
nanosecond of uncertainty: Should Kimble leave the wounded man
Kimble and the Young Guard hold a look
- As the   and
- Kimble struggles out of the bus - pulling the Young Guard behind him
He slings the man clear
death, the   closer
For one heartbeat, Kimble remains perched atop the bus
The train light -rays him
Kimble leaps
Lands
Rolls
Gains his feet
Tries to sprint away but can't: His feet are still chained
He gets off a dozen mincing steps before
:  hundred tons of   into the bus, splitting it open
Shrapnel rips through Kimble's thigh, but he stays on his feet, still running feverish half-steps
An  envelops the train
Flames stream down its flanks
The train burns past the wounded Guard
Kimble looks back, expecting to see the catastrophe behind him
But he gets the shock of his life - of any man's life: Still on its wheels, the locomotive is derailing - and coming after him
It's the stuff of nightmares: One little man being chased by a fire-breathing locomotive
The train burrows to a stop
Kimble is suddenly five feet taller, standing on an upheaval of earth, staring eyeball-to-eyeball with the train that nearly devoured him
He pants
Coughs on smoke
Then notices something in his hand
It's the key-ring
- Kimble sits and searches the key-ring for manacle key
Suddenly a hand reaches down and snatches the key-ring away
(
) Give me that
Kimble watches as Copeland quickly unlocks both sets of his own chains
You listen to me
don't give a damn which way you go, just don't follow me
Kimble takes the key as Copeland wraps his chains around his arm and runs
Kimble unlocks his leg irons and runs in the other direction - crossing a hilltop in the moonlight
: ( ) - News and sheriff's department choppers circle billowing smoke
to reveal the derailed train
Fire engines hose down the blackened locomotive

From the second car steps
He takes in the media spectacle
Good lord
What is this
a circus
As a group they begin moving along the service road above the crash site
Derailed train cars are accortianed below them
They take in the elements of the crash and as they walk each begins to reveal their
Marshal's credentials
Biggs spots something
Point of impact
and branches off
Biggs, your turn to babysit Newman
Shit
(to Newman) Come on
They drop down to the crash site
Poole ant Renfro remain with Gerard
state  steps into their path, but falls away when he sees Gerard's Marshall star
How ya doing
Who's in charge
Sheriff Rollins
Just follow the lights - Gerard follows his point to where  lights illuminate the scene
He shakes his head - it doesn't please him
Renfro and Poole share a look, they seem to know what's about to happen
- Seated near a tree
space blanket draped over his shoulders
He is surrounded by  personnel, and a , clearly basking in the event
Television remote news crews are kept only slight back
Gerard appears in the b
g
, listening
train was bearin' down on us, fast
don't know how - it's still kind of hazy - but  grabbed him and pushed him out of the bus
You coulda both been killed
know, but hell, he's my partner
Woulda done the same for me
The young Sheriff in charge nods, buying the story
Gerard eases forward, displays his badge, interrupts
Excuse me, Sheriff Rollins
Deputy Marshal Samuel Gerard
(annoyed) 'll be with you in a minute
The television lights widen to illuminate Gerard
He shields his eyes
The Sheriff opens a file and produces fax-photos of all four prisoners
(to Old Guard) For the record
These three dead
And this one
He switches to a photo of Kimble
Well, everything happened so fast
(bites lip, decides) Huh-uh
Don't think he made it
Sheriff eyes the wreckage that could entomb a hundred prisoners, then files Kimble's fax-photo with the others
You get some rest
He pats the Guard on the shoulder and approaches Gerard
Looks like you came a long way for nothing
My men've already done a thorough search from point of impact and found nothing
: - Biggs and Newman stop by the muddy culvert
Biggs sees something
He orders Newman into the muck after it
Aware of media, proceeds patiently with the young Sheriff
With all due respect, may  suggest check-points starting at a 15-mile radius on -57, -24, Route 13 east of - Whoa, whoa, whoa
For what
Prisoners are all dead
The only thing check-points will do is get a lot of good people out here frantic and flood my office with calls
Gerard finally touches eyeballs with the young Sheriff and we get our first taste of Gerard at close range
(beat) Well, shit, Sheriff, 'd hate for that to happen
So, 'll be taking over the investigation
On whose authority
By authority of the Governor of the State of Illinois and the office of the United States Marshal, 5th District Northern Illinois
Poole produces State and Federal authorization documents from one of her pockets and hands it to the young Sheriff
(back-down beat) Okay
You want jurisdiction over this mess, you got it
(to assistants) Shut it down
Wyatt Earp is here to mop up for us
He slaps the file of fax-photos at Gerard on his way out
Just as Biggs, spotless, eases ino the group with Kimble's manacles
Behind Biggs we see Newman, covered in mud
Seeing the leg irons, the Sheriff and his deputies pile to a stop
Now Gerard takes his run at Old Guard
Please, ladies and gentlemen, step back and give this poor man some room
Like an obedient dog the press backs off, they sense a change of story and command
Gerard kneels down with Poole and Renfro in front of the Old Guard
The Sheriff hovers near
(friendly, to Old Guard) Always an interesting thing when we find leg irons and no legs in them who held the keys, sir
Uh, me
Would you be so kind as to show them to me, sir
Gerard's large hand extends palm up at the Old Guard
The Old Guard pats his pockets, comes up empty
He eyes the press hovering just out of earshot
Second chance
Poole reopens the file of photos in front of the man
The Old Guard can't take it - points to Kimble's photo
(cracking) He mighta got out
Thank you
What the hell is this
minute ago you tell me he's part of the wreckage, now you're - Renfro - Take that bus apart
want an accurate body count
Poole - Set up operations right here
He stops and looks into the  lights and starts moving downtrack
The media and State Police move with him like Israelites behind Moses
Ladies and gentlemen
our fugitive's been on the run for ninety minutes
Average foot speed over uneven ground - barring injury is approximately four miles an hour, giving us a radius of six miles want a hard-target search of any residence, gas station, farmhouse, henhouse, doghouse and outhouse in that area
Check-points go up at 15 miles
(to media) You got that
Good
Now, turn those damn things off and get out of our way
- just above the treetops
Helicopter speeds up a dark river
Its tracking beam illuminates the river bank
- Flashing lights
Two highway patrol cars set up roadblocks
The  of police  breaks the rural quiet
moment later a   overhead
- Kimble moves down train tracks
His jumpsuit is wet with blood from the gash
He pauses and checks the wound
He's going to need stitches
Far down the tracks he sees glow of town lights
He keeps moving
- Kimble crosses a tressel, keeps running toward the direction of the lights
junk yard by railroad tracks and a road
Signs along the road show we're on the edge of town
One says: Hospital-1/2 mile
- Kimble runs from a streak up to the railroad tracks
As he nears the junk yard and road he sees the hospital sign
He's close but he can't go into the hospital in his prison jumpsuit
He leans against a wrecked car and catches his breath
Just then a tow truck pulling a car on its hook, turns off the road and parks next to the tracks
Kimble ducks for cover behind the wrecked car
The driver climbs out, dumps his coveralls in the front seat and closes the door
He moves toward a house across the tracks, then forgets something and returns to the cab
He throws open the door and grabs lunch box off the seat - and we notice the coveralls missing from the seat
As the driver returns to the house we   the opposite side of the car to find Kimble, ducked beneath the window, clutching the coveralls
- crude headquarters is set up beneath a tent, near the crash site
Maps are laid out on tables
Power and phone lines are pulled down from the lines running along the tracks
Renfro supervises the electronics
Poole handles phones, takes a report from the field and relays it to Gerard
Blood trail found
Two miles southwest
(to Biggs) Type it and match it against all four prisoners
(to Renfro) Renfro, get an
fax on Kimble to every local hospital
(to Newman) Newman
Newman appears
Yes, sir
need some coffee
As Newman steps off, everyone turns at sound of from the train crash
- shouts up to others
Hey, one's alive
-   - Loading dock outside the
stacks boxes of food outside kitchen entrance
Kimble, in the tow truck operator's coveralls, picks up a box and carries it inside
Once inside he branches off down a hallway
-  - door opens on a long hallway
,  with a bandaged hand, and a  leave a room and walk  us
Behind them, Kimble moves down the hall and stops in front of the doorway
'  - : -    - Kimble closes the door and locks it
Hanging on the back of the door we see a doctor's white coat
: - An Illinois State Trooper's car pulls up outside
: - On it we see:  packaged sterilized bandage, an opened antiseptic wash, an opened topical anesthetic, and an empty syringe
We   to find: His wound bathed in orange antiseptic wash, three stitches already in
With pair of forceps he picks up the needle as he sutures himself
: -   () - At far end of the hall we see a   chatting with a at a nurses' station
: '  - Kimble, his bandage already in place, gives himself a shot of antibiotics
: - '  - man, tube in nose, on two
s, lays in bed with eyes closed
Kimble comes   near his face
Can you hear me, sir
No response
The man is out of it
Kimble backtracks to the patient's closet and opens it
Hanging inside we see his clothes
He removes them and notices the man's untouched breakfast tray
: - '   - The Duty Nurse and State Trooper chat when a fax begins coming through on
There's your fax
: '  - Kimble dressing in the man's clothes
He eats a piece of toast - part of the man's breakfast - as he buttons up his shirt
- His arm slowly reaches out and presses his nurses call button
: '  - fax photograph of Richard Kimble slowly comes off the duty station
Next to the machine the patient's call light comes on
The Duty Nurse, standing with the Highway Trooper, sees the patient's light come on and starts down the hall toward the patient's room
: '  - Kimble shaving when we hear the    the patient's room
He moves
(
) Mr
Patterson, do you need some more water
- ' The Duty Nurse looks from the tray to the man, impressed
Oh, you did a good job on this
She takes his empty plastic pitcher and
pushes open the bathroom door - no sign of Kimble - and refills the pitcher from the sink
(over her shoulder, to patient) It does get dry in here, doesn't it
She doesn't expect an answer, turns  the , and goes into the main room
As the door closes we see Kimble behind it
: -  - Kimble, clean-shaven, and wearing the patient's glasses and a doctor's white coat, moves down the hall to the emergency room exit
Suddenly the State Trooper steps back from the admissions desk with his newly received fax, and starts down the corridor toward Kimble
The Trooper looks up as the two men pass
'Scuse me, Doc
Kimble turns but continues slowly backing toward the
doors behind him
Don't know if you heard or not but we're looking for an escaped prisoner from that bus train wreck 'couple hours ago
Thought he might show up here if he was hurt
What's he look like
The Trooper looks down at his fact sheet as we see a slow trickle of blood from a shaving nick begin winding down Kimble's cheek
(from fax sheet) Approximately six one, 180 pounds, brown hair, brown eyes and beard
At the last second Kimble feels the drop of blood and wipes it clean as the Trooper looks up
Seen anyone that fits that description
Every time  look in the mirror
but without the beard
They laugh
Excuse me
Sure
Kimble moves through the
doors as an ambulance parks outside
-    - Two  try to take out a patient on a gurney
The lead wheels are stuck
Here
Kimble helps clear the wheels so the collapsible gurney comes free
#2 Thanks, Doc, we had to dig him out from under a train
As the gurney comes out, Kimble looks right into the face of the Young Guard
The Guard's eyes suddenly open wide
It's him
It's - Kimble claps the portable oxygen mask back over the Young Guard's mouth and keeps his hand there
How is he
The Paramedics move him toward the ramp
#1 He's pretty bad off
Broken leg, ribs
Concussion
As Kimble moves away
Tell the
doctor he's also got a perforated spleen
He's gone
The two Paramedics share a look as they whisk the Young Guard inside
#2 (impressed) Jesus, how could he tell that from looking at his face
- Kimble climbs behind the wheel
/   - full communications link is in place
Deputy marshals answer phones, work faxes, add information to a situation board
Troopers bring in information
Poole calls Gerard
Background just came in from Chicago
Hit me
Renfro and Poole lay out the details
The download of information comes clear and fast
Richard David Kimble
Vascular Surgeon
Convicted of first-degree murder in the killing of his wife
Pleaded innocent
Claimed a one-armed - Let's not retry the case
Priors and accomplices
Gerard steps up the hillside out of sight of the investigation to take a leak
Followed by Renfro and Poole
None
No previous arrests
Poole takes up a position discreetly behind tree as Gerard unzips his fly and relieves himself
Sealed juvie record
Poole calls out from behind tree
Nothing
Total cherry
Relatives
Children
No relatives
One child
son
Died in drowning accident three years ago
Girl friends
Ex-wives
Friends
Combinations of the above
Lot of friends
Doctors
Hospital staff
Gerard zips up
Start there
Authorize taps
Cover his lawyer first
Never get it
Bet me
Renfro won't take it
Have Stevens go to Judge Rubin, he'll sign 'em
Biggs charges up the hillside
DeLange Hospital
Wounded guard swears to High Holy he saw Kimble right there in the hallway
Ambulance, missing too
- Gerard moves quickly to the map
Give me a time
-nine-thirty
Twenty minutes ago
Gerard redraws the circle of units
No longer are we covering a fifty-mile radius
The circle is redrawn, tightened, with the hospital as its center
The triangulation is set
: - The ambulance follows three cars toward a rural railroad crossing
(
) We're waiting up here in Canton
Wondering if you heard anything on this Kimble chase - - Kimble behind the wheel as he approaches the railroad crossing
The biocom monitors police chatter: (
) Two-twelve-, be advised that all discussion on this matter is to be conducted on a tactical frequency - either Channel  or
Over
Frequency goes dead
Kimble looks  the windshield: An arrow points toward Canton, two miles
The cars in front slow as the railroad crossing signal suddenly activates and the bars begin to drop
Kimble pops the  and hurriedly snakes through the crossing and heads in the opposite direction
but his maneuver gets attention
- Truck driver watches Kimble cut through the crossing and reaches for his
radio
- Poole hangs up phone
Ambulance just spotted two miles west of Doverville
Heading north on State road 53
Renfro turns to the map and marks it
The circle is much smaller
Running outta map, Sam
The crash site and hospital are already marked
Gerard is ready to move
Just the way we want it
Okay, people, let's button up
They move off to waiting State Trooper cars and helicopter
- Kimble driving down a rural road
He flips down visor and eyeballs folded roadmap
() - The ambulance crests a hill
In the distance we see the Grosvner Viaduct and the Barkley Dam
() - Blowing other traffic off the road,   and -cars stream south through the rugged rural terrain of Southern Illinois
Overtaking them all, a overhead
Heading into hilly terrain
Down below we see the ambulance
Inside the helicopter Gerard eyes the terrain
(into radio) We've got a visual
(to Gerard) He's heading toward the viaduct
Seal it up
- The two-lane road disappears into long tunnel
Three hundred feet below the road tumbles the Tennessee River
The Barkley Dam rises ahead
Kimble's   into the tunnel
Suddenly sees the helicopter setting down ahead of him at the mouth of the tunnel
Kimble slams on brakes and turns to retreat
-     ( ) Illinois Highway Patrol cars pull to a stop at the far entrance
Light flares
Set out road blocks
Gerard steps out followed by Renfro and Poole
' Comes to a stop, blocking traffic in both directions
Immediately  begin
- Trooper pulls up
Biggs and Newman behind Kimble blocking the other end
Troopers with guns drawn block the exits
The
from a State patrol car blares: (
) Please remain in your vehicles and lock your doors
Repeat, please remain in - Poole and Renfro materialize already decked out in Kevlar
They're jacked up and ready to rock
Renfro hands Gerard a vest
Got him
Gerard unholsters a 40 caliber, Glock model 22
Okay, ladies and gentlemen hard part's over
He starts into the tunnel
(to radio) We're movin' in
- Weapons drawn, but held discreetly at their sides, three silhouettes enter
Drivers who hadn't heeded the Troopers' warnings take one look at Gerard and quickly climb back inside and lock their doors
Biggs, Renfro and Poole fan out to the sides and give the middle to Gerard
The tunnel is quickly quiet
Kimble huddles at mid-tunnel
He's trapped
Drops to the ground beneath the truck
His heart pounding, brain clicking, fighting panic
Suddenly he realizes he's in water
Running water
They reach the mid-tunnel area
No Kimble
Biggs looks around, beneath vehicles
Gerard listens
Poole looks confused
Where'd he go
Gerard spots the trickle of water
He backtracks it until he finds a loose grate in the pavement
Man-size
Biggs, Renfro with me
-   - Kimble splashes blindly through ankle-deep sluice
He slows at forking tunnels to catch his breath and pick a direction
comes from somewhere - from everywhere
He whips off his jacket and slings it down a tunnel, then continues straight ahead
Somewhere behind, lights probe splash-patterns on the conduit wall - telltale signs of Kimble's passing
The lights belong to
Gerard, Biggs and Renfro
They push on, soon reaching the forking tunnels
Renfro finds the jacket ant splash signs
Channel Three
They conform their radios
Splitting up, Biggs and Renfro go left
Gerard - straight ahead
- Kimble
Bracing with all four limbs
Negotiating a mossy downslope
- Biggs and Renfro
Sweeping his light as he advances
Searching for splash-patterns
(into shoulder-mike) Nothing yet
- Gerard
Probing a branch-off tunnel with his light
About to pass, he notices scrapings on the mossy walls of the branch-off tunnel
Hand marks
(into radio) Got a possible here
Stand by
He stows his light but hangs onto the Glock
Bracing with three limbs - Gerard begins the tricky descent
Slips once
Recovers
Slips again
and tumbles out of control
and
Scrabbling for purchase, he finally snags An overhead pipe
Gerard stabilizes
Sweeps his light to locate his Glock, lying down-tunnel
He eases toward it
But another hand gets there first
It's Kimble
Face dark and desperate
Dangerous
Hand flexing on the pistol
They lock eyes for a beat
didn't kill my wife
So, you didn't kill your wife
Not my problem
An adrenal beat
For a moment they hold a look
Then the silence is broken by Gerard's radio
(
) Gerard
You there
Gerard looks for his radio, then back at Kimble - he's gone
Instantly Gerard reaches for his ankle - and pulls a back-up piece
- As Renfro hears   his way
Gerard charges down the tunnel
From a side tunnel, Renfro appears, almost colliding
Biggs follows
Straight ahead
- Kimble sticks Gerard's gun into his waist band to balance in the tunnel
He spills around a corner and stops
Ahead lies an orb of light
The tunnel ends
The  is incredible
Kimble moves to the end of the tunnel and stops
' Water pours from the tunnel into the spillway of Barkley dam disappearing into a veil of mist below - a great cauldron of mists
No rocks
None visible at least
He hears the  behind him -
- Gerard and Renfro turn the corner
Renfro drops into a shooting stance
Turn around, hands over your head
And get down on the ground
For a moment Kimble eyes Gerard
Your choice, Kimble
Kimble turns his back on the Marshals, stares again at the water
Slowly he puts his hands over his head
Gerard puts up his gun and pulls his handcuffs
He moves through the water toward Kimble
Get down on your knees
Kimble bends slowly, stares down into the falls, hears the footsteps get closer, then does the unthinkable
He jumps
- Biggs moving to the top of the massive dam sees Kimble leap into the sheet of water spilling over dam and disappear into the mists below
He can't believe his eyes
- Renfro lowers his gun
(amazed) Son of a bitch
It's the most amazing thing he's ever seen
He stands at the mouth of the tunnel staring down
He stares down into the mists
Impressed
It has told him something invaluable about this fugitive
- Gerard scrambles out of the tunnels to the top of the dam near Biggs, just as squad cars, troopers and the search helicopter converge on the site
- Far downriver a figure fights through a snag in the bend
The snag - a tree branch - breaks away and heads down stream
Hanging onto the branch we see Kimble
-   - Below the dam and spillway
Troopers in waders search the shallows, deputies beat bushes along the shore
Farther out we see a dredge boat slowly working the waters
Gerard watches the dredge cage come up again
As if with the next pass it will prove him the victor
The approaches
Running out of daylight, Inspector
Lights and generators are coming, Captain
Look,  don't mean to tell you your job, but maybe one person in a million could've survived that fall
The guy's fish food
Gerard turns and brings his look to bear on the Captain
Then find me the fish that ate him
He turns and heads to a waiting helicopter
- Kimble runs through the woods
He staggers, his arm hooks a sapling which spins him to the ground
He lays motionless, exhausted
'  -
'  - Helen in bed
Kimble's hand comes   and touches her shoulder
She turns toward Kimble as he moves and kisses her
: Helen tosses her head back
She wears white silk pajamas and smiles down  us
hand reaches up and unbuttons the top two buttons of her top
Then Kimble moves up as we - : - Helen running down beach  us
Embraces Kimble as we - : - Helen's head comes up out of a pool
Hair tossed back, she smiles as we - : '  - Helen exiting Kimble's car the night of the murder
She looks back at Kimble, framed by the door frame, ant smiles
Good-bye
love you
Again
Then again
then: : - Kimble comes out of his sleep with a start
Shivering
He remembers where he is
His breathing returns to normal
-  - Kimble moves across a river trestle and disappears into tunnel
- Kimble on pay phone in the rear of the store waits for party to answer
An old lady and her mother shop
Across the store a pharmacist watches Kimble
- Kimbles watches the boys as he waits for answer
We hear , then a receptionist answers: (
) The law offices of Gutherie, Morgan and Wainwright
Walter Gutherie please
(
) 'm sorry, Mr
Gutherie has left for the day, would you like his voice mail
Kimble hangs up and moves down an aisle, stopping in front of the hair color
He takes a box of black hair dye off the shelf and looks at the instructions
When he looks up he sees the pharmacist looking at him
'  - roadside diner
Kimble, his hair now black, and wearing a new pair of Wranglers, hooded sweatshirt and a duffle coat, moves down the road to the diner
'  - Kimble enters
He sits at the counter and a sparky , late, mid-forties, with strong good looks and tough smile fills his coffee cup before he even asks
Need to look at the menu
Some soup, please
Good choice
She marks her pad and leaves
Sights ant sounds around Kimble begins to occupy his attention: dishwasher buses a tub of dishes back to the kitchen
He stares at him
farmer sitting at a table stares at Kimble, Kimble looks away
man at the pay phone seems to be staring at him
Is he calling the police
Everyone seems to be looking at him
Someone stops in front of him
young waitress serves him his soup
Where's the first waitress
Takes a few sips of soup
Out of the corner of his eye he sees: The Older Waitress putting on her coat to leave
Is she going to report him
He fights the paranoia
on the  gets his attention
- report on the escape
television reporter describes the chase for Kimble; his jump at the dam and his presumed death from the fall
Kimble decides it's time to leave
He drops some money on the counter and exits
- Kimble moves across the parking lot trying not to run until he's out of sight of the diner
Once free of the lights of the diner he starts running and disappears into the night
- Kimble running down the road
Fields stretch out on both sides of the highway
Open land
From behind him we suddenly hear the sound of
For a moment Kimble moves faster, then as the   , his sprint drops to a jog
to a walk, until finally he stops and waits for the inevitable
But the flashing lights suddenly rip past him chasing a speeder
They weren't after him after all
Kimble looks at himself
He's shaking
moment later he is lit by headlights
car pulls up next to him, passenger window rolls down
Need a ride
Kimble stares at her
Which way are you going
She smiles and points in the direction her car is traveling
They hold a look as we hear: (
) We feel confident about the
: - quiet house on a quiet street out from town
homeless woman picks through garbage
garbage truck moves slowly down the street
plumbing truck parked along a curb
Just early morning traffic
We see Renfro and Newman watch the house from across the street, behind a deserted house
Gerard joins them
We see that Biggs is in the plumbing truck
Poole is the homeless woman picking through the garbage
Newman hands Gerard a radio
Local officials were about to wet their pants to move in
bet they were
(to radio) Where's the woman
: In the plumbing truck
He triggers his mike
(into radio) Same room
(into radio) Okay
'll take front
Biggs and Renfro, rear
Poole, handle support
don't want anyone hurt
Stay outside unless called
Radios on three
The deputies prepare their weapons
Newman checks his service issue
38, stares at Gerard's Glock
Uh, just want me to wait here, sir
Hell, no
You're with me, Newman
Let's go
- open, splintering the deadbolt right out of the door
Marshals
Down
Down
- Textbook perfect, Gerard and Newman rush into front room
Down the hall a man's figure streaks across a doorway woman in the rear of the house
Motions Newman to the left to check the door off the living room while he moves down the main hall into the back bedroom
-   / Clearly unnerved by the screaming woman, Newman opens door off the living room
The door opens into a smaller bedroom
He steps into - It's empty
Gerard appears at the other (hallway) door to the bedroom
Gerard motions Newman on to the door to the bathroom and continues down the hall into the back bedroom where the woman continues
He ignores her
His feet move silently, heel-to-toe
He checks the bathroom as Newman opens his connecting door - empty - then moves on toward the doorway to the kitchen
Gerard moves to the kitchen doorway
Running out of house
He braces himself swings into the kitchen - it too is empty
Suddenly Gerard gets the bad feeling he's passed his prey
: Newman looks around, suddenly scared
The only place he didn't search was behind the bedroom door
He turns just as: Surges out, knocks Newman's gun from his hand
In a flash, Copeland yanks Newman's arm behind his back and presses a knife against the deputy's neck and moves him out of the room
We
: He hears Copeland moving somewhere in the front of the house
(
) got your man
Now  want outta here
Gerard moves back through the bedroom past the woman
He locks in on the voice and sound of the moving fugitive
Copeland listens but gets no response from Gerard
He backs through the second bedroom door, pulling Newman into the - Newman's eyes are pure terror - the blade pressed against his throat
(to Gerard) You hear me
said,  want out or 'll cut your man's throat
Keeps moving down the hallway, through first bedroom, pauses at door to the second bedroom and chooses his course
Copeland positions himself between the bedroom door and the hallway opening
He's troubled he can't hear Gerard
Suddenly he hears a  behind him at the bedroom door He whips Newman around and we see: shoe hits the floor
Copeland realizes his mistake too late
He turns back to the hallway and there is Gerard
He never blinks
once killing Copeland instantly
The knife falls to the floor
Newman clutches his head, stunned but unhurt
Gerard now turns to the screaming woman behind him in the bedroom doorway
Shut up
She does
Immediately
- As coroners and tactical police mop up
Gerard moves across the yard, sips coffee from Styrofoam cup
He stops at a sheriff's car, Newman sits on back seat, shaken, nearly hysterical, clutching his ear
My ear
can't hear a thing out of it
can't believe you did that
You think  should have bargained with him, don't you
Yes
You could've missed
You could've killed me
Yeah, you're absolutely right could've
They hold a look
How bad's your ear
Terrible
probably have permanent hearing damage
Let me see it
Newman leans toward him
Gerard speaks into his ear
don't bargain
Gerard leaves
Newman watches him - realizing what a truly unsettling man Gerard is
- Kimble makes call
While he waits for phone to be answered and  in the b
g
An
The of Chicago River
Walter
It's Richard
: ,    - Walter Gutherie answers phone from his office overlooking Lake Michigan
Richard
Jesus, why did you run
Running only makes you look guilty
wasn't worrying about appearances, Walter
Tell me where you are
'll come meet you so you can turn yourself in
'm not turning myself in
need money
Gutherie is silent
When he speaks again his speech takes on the lawyerly tone of a man who's covering his own bases
Richard
You're asking me to harbor and aid a convicted felon
can't help you that way
My advice - both as a friend and as your legal counsel - is for you to give yourself up
Now tell me
where are you
Kimble picks up the change in his attorney's tone
(beat) St
Louis
Give me an address
'll be - Gutherie hears the
Kimble's gone
- Kimble stands in the doorway with cup of coffee
He considers his next move
Then seeing bank clock flash the time: 9:30 - he knows what that move is
- An upscale mid-town tennis club
Behind glass windows of the entryway we see tennis courts
From the courts comes Dr
Charles Nichols still dressed in his warmups, carrying his tennis bag
friendly   Sharon) smiles as he goes by
See you tomorrow, Dr
Nichols
Creature of habit, Sharon
- Dr
Nichols leaves the club
He tosses his gym bag into the back of his car and drives off
/
'  - As he pulls up to the first stoplight, a homeless man moves toward the driver's side and begins washing his windshield
Nichols waves the man off
Not today, please
The man shuffles off
Just then a second man appears at his passenger window
He leans down to wave him away No
Not - then stops - the face at his passenger window is Richard Kimble's
(stunned) Oh, my God
Richard
Nichols rolls down the passenger window
How're you doing, Charlie
You're alive
Yeah
And  need your help
Anything
need some money
Whatever you've got on you
Of course
Nichols reaches into his gym bag in the backseat and digs for his wallet
Tell me where you're staying
'll get you more money
Some clothes
Just give me an address
'll call you
Kimble glances around, the area is still clear
He looks back into the car and doesn't see the police car turn the corner and come up the street behind them
Nichols finds his wallet ant hands all the cash he's got to Kimble, who quickly pockets it
know why you came back - to find him
If  can help, call me
Call me
They hold a look
The stoplight changes to green but they don't see it
Thanks, Charlie
Here, Richard, take my coat
He reaches into the back for his coat, suddenly police car behind him  its
Nichols looks into his rearview mirror
Sees a  lean out his window
(to Nichols) Hey, buddy - green light
Let's go
Nichols looks back at Kimble
He's gone
'  () -     - The media room - just what it sounds like - banks of audio/video equipment and a sound board
Renfro rewinds the tape
Gerard, Biggs, Poole and Newman
We've alerted St
Louis Call them back
Tell them you've made a mistake
What
(to Renfro) Stop it there
Renfro hits play
Kimble's  is heard again: Drop the voices
Renfro removes the two voices
What comes up are the ( , , )
Everyone becomes focused to the sounds now
(he's heard something) Listen
Trains
Traffic
More
there's a voice in the background
At first the sound is unrecognizable Then a
on the tape: "Next stop Merchandise Mart
" That's an El announcement
And there's no E1 in St
Louis
Ladies and gentlemen, Richard Kimble is in Chicago
Poole, get his artwork out to local police and have check the shelters
Biggs, bring in the detectives that handled his case
Instantly the room is in movement
'll prepare the press release
No
Stevens stops
They don't know he's alive and as far as Kimble knows we don't either
want to keep it that way as long as we can
Are we clear
The whole group sense Gerard's intensity in regard to Kimble
(for the group) Perfectly
Gerard reflects on a moment of personal satisfaction
Noah
go to my office and let's officially take Dr
Kimble out of purgatory
: 11TH   - Morning roll call
Kimble's photo distributed to cops by Detectives Kelly and Rosetti
(
) As of this morning Chicago
was alerted to the reappearance of Richard Kimble
- Newman and Poole check train station
Looking for Kimble
They show his photo to homeless people
No help
- Holding a handkerchief to his face, Kimble moves through arriving patients and enters Cook County Hospital
- Renfro and Biggs check shelters for Kimble
They show his to administrator
Look around
'  - The place is humming now
Detectives Kelly and Rosetti sit in front of Gerard
Gerard studies Kimble's file
Renfro sits in
Police units have also increased patrols around homeless shelters and mass transit stations in the city
- Police patrol the platform looking for Kimble
-  - Kimble moves past security, then pockets the handkerchief and turns up a hallway, blending in with the indigents and poor
: '  - , a woman about 45, attractive, smart, loyal
Poole and Gerard talk to her in an examination room
ran his office for twelve years
Yes, we were very close
But he wouldn't come to me for help
-  - Busy with doctors, orderlies and street people
Kimble moves down hallway and enters
-   - He moves into the room and takes a new patient form, looks around
the office area of the clinic
It could be any hospital clinic from this view
But as Kimble turns to leave we see a  waiting to be called
On his lap we see a prosthetic arm
Kimble looks up from the arm to the man
Good morning
Good morning
As he turns to leave we hear: (
) Don't underestimate this guy
: - '   - Dr
Roberts from the party, talks to Biggs and Gerard as he takes off scrubs to get into shower
's one smart, cold sonofabitch
He did her, no question
: -  - Kimble moves down the hallway containing the janitor's locker room
Janitors move in and out the door
'   - Gerard walks through Kimble's house
The art and most of the furniture is gone
Books are in boxes and shopping bags around the room
Plastic covers the remaining pieces of furniture
Gerard stares at the empty walls
Shadows on the walls show where the art once hung
Gerard pauses, tries to absorb the place
He takes a book from one of the bags and looks at it
- '  - Kimble moves past the lockers, racks and boxes of cleaning supplies, stops at a board listing work schedules, vacation leaves, locker numbers
Behind him a
As a janitor moves off to the showers we see his locker did not close but remains slightly ajar from the impact
'   -    - Door opens revealing the janitor's clip on
hanging from a green shirt
Kimble steals it
'  - Gerard looks at the two detectives
Gentlemen,  appreciate the cooperation of the Chicago police
He moves toward them
: - stands on ladder looking through pants sizes
Did you say, 38/34
No
34/34
folded pair of green janitor's pants drops onto the counter in front of Kimble
He already has the green shirt to the uniform
-   -     - Photographed
- Kimble takes the finished photos from the delivery tray
: '  - Was there anything in your initial investigation that would make you think Kimble would come back to Chicago
The man definitely has friends here
What about lady friends
Not that we found
: -     - card on a community bulletin board advertises a basement apartment for rent
(
) What about the man he claimed attacked his wife
Kimble pulls the notice from the board as we - : '  - Kelly and Rossetti share a look, a smile
Right
You ever been downwind of a stockyard when the breeze is blowing
That's where we were sitting when Richard Kimble told that one
: '  - Kimble knocks at door
It is opened to reveal a  , 18-20
He calls to someone
: '  - light comes on and an   , her stockings rolled down her shins, leads the way down the basement stairs
The Punk Kid stands at the top of the stairs, watches Kimble
(
) We found nothing
The Polish woman shows him a spare but sufficient bed and nightstand set up
She points to door leading up to the street
: '  - Kimble also at work at the bedside table
He carefully cuts out his do-it-yourself photograph and places it over the existing photograph on the hospital
The name on the says: Desmondo Jose Ruiz
Then he places a thin piece of lamination plastic and trims the edges
Kimble defaces the plastic to give it rough look, then examines the finished product not bad
'  - (
) If this guy existed believe me someone would've found him
He raises an eyebrow
: '  -     - Of medical residents
Two photographs next to each other young Richard Kimble and Charles Nichols
(
) Richard Kimble
saw him two days ago
to see: Gerard studying the photos
Renfro looks up like someone's bitten him
He, Biggs and Gerard are in Nichols' administrative office
Gleaming
Filled with awards and photos of Nichols and influential people
Nichols hangs up his lab coat and slips back into his suitcoat
He shows no sign of nervousness
He stopped me in my car
gave him some money
Where was this
Outside our tennis - (correcting himself) - my tennis club
Gerard moves around Nichols' office taking in the details
Did he ask you for help
volunteered
He wouldn't accept it
Why do you think he came back to Chicago
He didn't tell me
didn't ask you that, sir
'm sure he was trying to protect you from having to lie for him
Gerard continues to move around the room, study prints, books, drawings, awards and photos
If you're really his friend, you'll help us bring him in unharmed
Why, so he can go back to prison
If you want help, gentlemen, you've come to the wrong man
Gerard finds a photo of Nichols and a gleaming Ferrari
Dr
Nichols, last year the
Marshals' office closed out 11,003 warrants
10,975 of those were captured
The twenty-eight others thought they were smarter than us
Now they're dead
(re: the photo) Nice car
Gerard puts the photo down
'  - Gerard and his deputies leave Nichols' outer office
Gerard clearly feels he's come to the right man
Stay on him
- Kimble mopping the trauma room hallway
The hallway elbows around a corner and Kimble stands less than ten feet from a door that is marked: " " He watches a technician leave the clinic and mops closer to the doorway, and fails to see an attractive with white coat and stethoscope draped around her neck turn the corner behind him ant step on the freshly mopped section
Head down, she is completely absorbed in a file and doesn't see the wet floor until she slips slightly, looks up but keeps walking
Where's Rudy
They said he's sick
Didn't they tell you to put up the sign
Uhhh
No they didn't
Put up the 'wet floor' sign before someone gets hurt
She keeps going
(mumbles) Asshole
She looks back at Kimble
What did you say
Nothing
Anne keeps moving off toward trauma hall
He watches her turn the corner to the trauma hallway
- Kimble enters the dimly lit prosthetics lab
He moves silently among the casts and prosthetics of arms, hands, legs hanging from the ceiling
Cables and electronic equipment are on the counters
He leaves the lab and moves into the office section of the Prosthetic Clinic
He passes a computer room and finally reaches the office
He is about to enter when a woman's voice stops him
(
) Hey, Ricky
Weren't you just in here
Kimble turns to see a
large woman with glasses
She stands with a partially finished prosthetic arm
-
'   - The one-armed man's arm coming off in the fight
(  ) Sorry,  thought you were Ricky
(stumbling) No
've got to clean the blinds in the office
Want me to wait till you're finished
Naw
'm going to be here all night
You won't bother me
She slips on a pair of headphones and goes back to work
: - Kimble cleaning the blinds, keeps an eye on the Technician who is listening to music on her Walkman
She is carefully painting a section of the arm
Not watching Kimble
: Opened
Nimble looks over his shoulder
The Technician doesn't see him
Prosthetic Clinic Operations Manual is removed from shelf
Photographs of prosthetic arms
Kimble shifts the materials into his clothes, closes his coat and suddenly he stops
: -    - Kimble waits for the elevator
The folders in his uniform shift and he tries to rearrange them
When he turns back we see Anne Eastman beside him
Her
says: " "
She sees him doing the rearranging
The elevator arrives
They step into: - Anne moves to the back
Kimble on the other side
( ) Hey, how're you doing
Fine
You find that sign
Yes,  did
You called me an asshole
Excuse me
was having a bad shift
They laugh
They reach ground level and step out together
You worked at other hospitals
Lots of them over the years
Here, long ago
Hasn't changed much
bet it hasn't
See you
They part ways
Kimble continues out the door
Anne stops and watches him leave
- Kimble sits on the night train going home
He begins looking at his information
'   - Afternoon light comes in Kimble's basement windows
Sheets of Prosthetic Clinic patient material are spread over Kimble's bed, floor
Kimble searches through the documents, making notes
He studies photos of attachments
Cable attachments
Joints
Electronics
Pins
straps
looking for a key to the identity of the one-armed man
Finally he stops
He finds the flyer in his pocket, puts it on the bedside table and moves to sink
He wets a towel and covers his face
Draws a cool damp breath
Lays back on bed amid the Prosthetic Clinic material
- Kimble pulls the arm
It separates in the one-armed man's sleeve
Wrenches
Dis-articulates
- - Reacts in pain
Again
(: We sense Kimble's mind returning to something
Getting closer to the key
) - - Escaping the bedroom
We hear his   the a
again
Another  , but this time the sound is distinctly different
a
'   (  ) Kimble yanks the wet rag from his face, his senses alert
Listening, he hears:  are real, just outside and him
: - car door slams
We see unmarked police cars pulling up in front of the apartment
Cops are moving toward the house
- Kimble turns off his light, moves from the bed to the window
Carefully looks out: ' Unmarked police cars in front of the house, looking, moving his way
Kimble moves instinctively to the back door
He starts to open it but through the dirty window, he sees the back courtyard covered by more cops
Kimble moves back toward the front
Unsure of his next move, he's sweating, preparing for the worst
He watches the  team charge the house but instead of charging through the basement door they move up the front steps and into the house overhead
Overhead he hears the  from the arresting cops
'  - Kimble  the Punk Kid try to escape out the back
He runs, sees cops and runs toward Kimble's basement door, actually reaching it before he is caught by the cops and pulled away
Moves toward the front window and watches cops lead the Punk Kid out to the car
call the other cops to stand down
Kimble moves slowly to his front door
Looks out
' Cops put the young man into an unmarked police car
His grandmother, the Polish woman, follows them, crying
Kimble leans against the wall, exhausted
-   - Kimble carries his cleaning tray down busy hallway just outside of the Prosthetic Clinic and stops
' Two cops talk outside the Prosthetic Clinic
Kimble backs to a safe place in the trauma hallway to wait for them to leave
: 11TH     -   - The Punk Kid is handcuffed to a bench as a cop works on a report
Suddenly the Kid notices something that gets his attention
' wanted poster of Kimble over the cop's head
The Kid sees - Wanted for Murder - realizes who it is
(to cop) Hey
Hey
know that guy
The cop looks up, sees Kimble's poster and then back at the Kid
: - Kimble moves toward prosthetic clinic
In passing through the trauma hallway he becomes aware of a crisis developing
major accident has happened, victims are being brought in
The
for doctors
Elevator doors open as orderlies bring in new patients
Some walk, some are helped by family and police
Nurses direct traffic
Orders fly
Medicines are called
Family members yell for doctors
Ask for the injured
Anne picks up the pace with an  wheeling a gurney carrying a young patient, a
What happened
bus flipped off the overpass
Got at least twenty more coming in
What about this one here
Fractured sternum
-ray's coming up
Anne checks the boy's chart
Okay, we've got to get some room in this hallway, people
Orderlies quickly move the non-life-threatening patients out of the hall
Still more help is needed
Anne spots Kimble
Hey, take this one up the hall to Critical Care
Kimble nods
Anne moves to another patient
Kimble grabs the kid's gurney and begins wheeling it up the hall
As he pushes he looks at the kid's -rays
Anne looks up, barks another order, then suddenly sees Kimble pushing the gurney and looking at the film
Tries to negotiate through the incoming patients to get a better look, but Kimble is gone
She goes back to work
He wheels the Boy's gurney into an elevator
The doors close
-
- Kimble wheels the gurney down the hall and stops the Boy on the scrub threshold to the
and stops a
Hey
Hey
Surgeon pauses and eyes Kimble's janitor suit and the gurney
They just sent this one up
He takes a look at the Boy's chart and grabs the -rays and yells to
nurse
Bob
Get this one into room four, stat
He looks up, Kimble is gone
-   - Kimble enters the Prosthetic Clinic computer room
The Technician from the day before is listening to her Walkman, sees Kimble and waves
Kimble waves back and turns into the glass-walled computer room and closes the door
He closes the blinds and turns on the computer
: - The crisis has wound down
Anne moves into the room and begins checking patients
She stops a unit nurse,
Gladys, where's the boy  sent down with the janitor
What boy
The one with the fractured sternum
He never came in here
-   - Kimble scans  files, each an eight-letter enigma
Finds one with promise and loads it up
Wrong
He backs up and tries another file
"    : , , , ,
" Kimble knows he's got it
-   -    - Kimble keys in these responses: ": " : 35-50 : : :   :  " - Anne comes out of the stairwell and stops the Surgeon we saw with Kimble
Dave, did you see a janitor come up here earlier
Yeah, he brought a kid up
(handing her the chart) Anne, did you write the orders couldn't make out the signature
saw - (in a hurry now) Whoever did knew what the hell he was doing
Kid's a hair away from a ruptured aorta
He heads to the operating room, leaving her stunned
She stares at the scrawled orders
: -   -    - " " message appears on the screen
We hear the , searching, narrowing
The screen flashes: "   : 75 " Seventy-five
Hell, yes
Kimble types in another defining characteristic
Residence: Illinois
Again he waits
Rattles the blinds to make it seem like he's cleaning
The list shortens
"   : 21" What else
-
- Prosecutor stands before the jury
murdering Helen Wills Kimble the night of January 20
-   -    - Kimble types in: "Candidates having adjustment appointments between January 21, and February 1, 1993
" Kimble waits
Sixty-five names come up
Again too many
Kimble's reached a dead end
Kimble thinks
-
'  - The fight with the One-Armed Man
- Something has clicked in his memory
: -    - Kimble stands beneath the hanging artificial limbs
He takes down an arm, works the joint
-
'  - Kimble fights the One-Armed Man
He wrenches the man's prosthetic arm
-    - He moves it again
Harder, at an awkward angle
-
'  -   - ' - Kimble wrenches the arm
- The joint strains
-
'  -   - ' Kimble wrenches it and it
: -     - detailed diagram of arm construction
Kimble makes notes
: - Anne rides the elevator back to trauma
She's thinking
: -     - Joint repair list between January 21-April 21
Five names come up with Greater Chicago addresses
Kimble hits print
The  begins
Kimble looks up at the Prosthetic Clinic Technician - she is listening to her headphones, can't hear the printer
He continues to shake the blinds
/  - Kimble leaves Prosthetic Clinic and starts down the hall for the exit when a voice stops him
(
) Do you have a particular interest in our patients' x-rays
Kimble turns to see Anne coming toward him
What do you mean
saw you looking at that boy's chest film
She moves in on him
He eyes the exit
It's a hobby of mine - What other hobbies do you have
Brain surgery
What do you want
She reaches him
want to know how that kid ended up in surgery
'm a janitor
did what  was told
Bullshit
Who changed those orders
They hold a look
She knows
He takes a step back and she pulls his
You stand right here
'm calling security
Kimble runs
Anne turns to call security but doesn't
She stares after Kimble
: '  - Kimble's room being searched by the marshals
Gerard finds the flyer Kimble was handed on his way out the door
On it we see:
: -   '
- Anne and Gerard stand in the hallway
Gerard studies the
man posing as a janitor orders an emergency operation and all you do is pull his
(firmly) little boy's alive today because he did something
Gerard watches her eyes carefully
So, you weren't aware that when he escaped he was being transported to Menard State Prison to begin a term of life imprisonment
For what
For murdering his wife
Clearly this is news to Anne
Gerard almost smiles at her surprise
Thank you for your help, Doctor
He moves to the position Anne saw Kimble with the kid's gurney
Trying to imagine what Kimble was doing at that place
Renfro and the other deputies converge
What  can't figure is, if you were Kimble, why'd you take a major league chance of hanging around a trauma ward
Gerard considers this as a Man passes him
Gerard notices something
The place would be crawling with cops
Slowly Gerard separates from the group of deputies and follows the Man down the hall
The Man Gerard is following turns the corner to the Prosthetic hallway and realizing Gerard is following him, holds the hallway door open for Gerard
Can  help you find something
Thank you, sir,  think you already have
We see the Man has a prosthetic arm and that they are outside the door marked: " " - Restaurant deserted at this hour
Kimble makes calls
Yes
This is Dr
Elway at Cook County

(
) Hello
looking for your brother, Clive
This is Ted Riley with the high school reunion committee
Believe it or not, 25 years is just around the corner, and Clive's on our list of lost souls
Information gave me a number, but when  tried it
to reveal Kimble on the pay phone
The scrap of paper is his list-of-five
No kidding
Armed robbery
(forced laughter) He's where
: - Gerard looks at the screen
The number drops to 20
It could take us a week to track down every one of those names
Gerard picks up phone and dials a number
(into phone) Stevens
've got a list of names want searched for criminal history
: - Kimble stands on a sidewalk, staring at the imposing edifice across the street
After a here-we-go breath, he starts through traffic
-  - Kimble waits for an elevator
It opens to reveal a pack of staring
(catching door) Comin' or not
Forcing his feet to move, Kimble boards
-  - and pivots quickly
Elevator rises
Floor-indicator moves deathly slow
Kimble feels the breath of a dozen  on his neck
And just when his floor is mercifully about to arrive
Overhead lights flicker, and the elevator jars to a stop between floors
Aw, shit
Not now
Anybody bring a deck of cards
Abruptly they're moving again
Kimble's heart restarts with the elevator
-   - (to visitor) Booth Three
No hands on the glass
Five minutes maximum
Be advised that under a Federal court ruling your conversation can be recorded
Next
"Next" is Kimble
He steps to the counter

The Clearing Officer spins his clipboard around

You can wait in the hall
-   - Gerard and Biggs cross the lobby and stop in front of the desk; flash their
Marshal's
(to clerk) We need to see a prisoner
Fifth floor
Gerard and Biggs head for the bank of elevators
It's hinky
Man risks everything to find a man his own investigators say doesn't exist
Something's really hinky about this thing
Gerard looks at Biggs as they reach the elevators
hate that word
He hits the up button
: -   - Clearing Officer looks down the hall
Visitor for Driscoll
Kimble is on his feet
Booth seven
No hands on the glass
Be advised
The Clearing Officer, head down, drones on - doesn't notice Kimble is already gone
Kimble strides down the row of chairs, rounds the last partition to reach booth seven - and to stare at the one-armed man, , who waits there
So who are you
: -   ' : Driscoll's face is different
Driscoll is a black man
Sorry
made a mistake
Shit, that's okay
Stick around a few minutes, talk about whatever you want
But Kimble is gone
Driscoll calls after him
They're not exactly wired for cable downstairs, y'know
-  - Kimble exits the visitor's area
He sees another crowd of around the elevator again, opts for the door marked: "" -  - Biggs and Gerard wait for the elevator
Finally Gerard's had enough
Where're the damn stairs
It's five flights
Then you wait
He finds the door and starts up
-  - Kimble descending
Doors open and close throughout the stairwell but the traffic is light
: Climbing the stairs
He reaches a landing - and skims shoulders with Kimble, who pivots past on his way down
Amazingly, neither man reacts
Not yet
One flight above, Gerard's subconscious taps him on the shoulder and brings him to a dead stop
He leans over the stairwell railing to spy
Kimble spiraling downward
From this vantage, it could be any dark-haired man
But still
(a quick probe) Kimble
Others look up out of curiosity
but not Kimble
Two landings below, he falters a step, then tries to regain his step, keeps moving
But Gerard is pulling his Glock: The hitch in Kimble's stride told him everything
Kimble
Kimble blitzes down the stairs
Gerard moves after him
-  - Kimble throws open a fire door and starts across the lobby
Sees two cops, quickly approaches
Officers - there's a man in the stairwell waving a gun and screaming
The two cops rush to stairs and Kimble immediately moves toward the doors, fast but not running
Hoping to cloak himself in civilians
Biggs' elevator has finally arrived and emptied
He lets a woman on in front of him, oblivious to
Kimble moving
The revolving exit doors loom nearer ant nearer
- The two cops see Gerard
Gerard holds up his badge
Marshal
Get on the phone, call your commander, tell him there's a top-fifteen warrant in the building
Go
He shoves the cops out of the way and pounds downstairs
- Kimble closing in on the door when suddenly a sounds
People stop in confusion
Automatically, the exit doors begin closing
Biggs pushes his way off the elevator
Kimble breaks into a sprint for the door
Bursts out the stairwell door after Kimble
Kimble
Stop
But there's only one way of stopping Kimble
Enters the revolving doors as a big man enters from the outside
The big man sizes up the situation, realizes Kimble is fleeing and just before Kimble exits - yanks on the door - trapping him partially inside the revolving door
Other doors seal electronically
Biggs charges back, sees Gerard
Kimble fights the heavy glass door
The big man resists - but slowly the crack widens
Gerard bulls through the crowd, shoves a man out of his line of fire
Down
down
everybody down
With adrenal effort, Kimble wrings his body through the opening
- and makes it outside - except for his foot - caught like in a bear trap, as the door locks down
Harrowed, Kimble looks back over his shoulder at
Gerard
Charging the glass doors
Civilians suck marble and clear out of Gerard's line of fire on Kimble
Gerard takes aim
Kimble
Stop
It's Kimble's nightmare coming true
If he could chew off his leg right now, he would
He pulls at his foot just as - Gerard  seven times in two seconds
Kimble goes down
and   around the lobby long beat, then Gerard rises
studded with bullet holes, he sees
Kimble rising
staring back
Equally astounded that he's alive
He runs free
Open the doors
Gerard pounds against the doors
Sees cratering in the glass - and then sees flattened slugs all over the floor
It's bullet-proof glass
the glass he sees Kimble rush across the street and disappear into the parade
Doors open and Gerard and his men follow
But Kimble has disappeared into the parade celebrations outside
Blending in with the marchers
: - Kimble leaves a cheap hotel early the next morning
He wears a new set of clothes - jeans, sport coat and tie - than the day before, and the black hair coloring has been rinsed from his hair
He moves down the street
- Kimble uses a pay phone and stares through the window
'  - Across the street
'  - Inside the apartment the
No one is home
- The   nine, ten times
As Kimble waits he looks down at his list of five
The only name remaining is Fredrick Sykes
He looks down the street - it seems clear - then his focus shifts to a man carrying two coffees
He approaches a car parked along the curb
The passenger - a woman - leans across the seat and opens the door for him
He hands her a cup of coffee and as he starts to climb in, he shifts something on his hip - we see the butt of a handgun
Kimble hangs up and leaves through the back door
'  - Kimble moves across the roof and drops to fire escape behind Sykes' apartment
He looks in the window, steps back to see if anyone is looking, then pulls his fist back into his sleeve and with one swift pop,  the
'  -  - No sound
Slowly he moves into
Moving first toward the living room
The apartment is modest
He stops by a photograph of a teenage girl
Another is a boy in football uniform
The next one is a man in a police uniform
Kimble freezes
-
'  - Kimble struggles with the one-armed man
'  -  () Kimble struggles to recall the man's face
It could be him
: - Kimble searching for clues to Sykes' identity
He opens closets, wardrobe, bureau
reopens a drawer
There, in the bottom he finds an old prosthetic arm
: - Kimble looking through Sykes' desk drawers finds a package of photographs
He opens them and quickly flips through
- group of men on a business/vacation junket stand around a large sportfish hung from the dock
Kimble keeps flipping through, suddenly stops and backs up and we see what stopped him: The smiling face of Dr
Alexander Lentz
-
- Nichols introduces Kimble to Lentz
Richard
Alex Lentz
-  () There are three photos of Lentz
Kimble slowly pulls one out of the pack
As he slides it out we see a fish and on the other side we see
Sykes, wearing a prosthetic arm
-
'  - Kimble struggles with intruder
This time we see his face clearly
It is Sykes
-  () Kimble flips back to the earlier group photos and we see a Devlin-MacGregor banner over the group shot
Looks up
He's found the man he's looking for but also a new possibility - that the murder wasn't just a random act of violence
Kimble digs through Sykes' top desk drawer
His mind reeling
He stops: The Devlin-MacGregor Pharmaceutical logo in the top right corner
Payroll level four: Security
: '  - answers it
Marshal's office
Her expression changes to shock
: '   - Gerard is moving down the hall with a cup of coffee when the Secretary appears at a door
It' 9 Kimble on line three
Gerard moves quickly down the hall, mobilizing his troops as he runs
Renfro, Biggs
They follow him into
- Gerard moves to phone as  gives him nod he's ready
Gerard answers the phone and the trace begins
Renfro supervises
This is Gerard
(
) (beat) Do you remember what  told you in the tunnel
You told me, you didn't kill your wife
: '  -    - Remember what you said to me
- Gerard is calm
remember you were pointing my gun at me

) You said, ' don't care
' The numbers rush down
Technician reads the first set to Renfro
(a whisper) He's on the southside
That's right, Kimble
'm not trying to solve a puzzle here
'm just the poor working man that's paid to hunt you down
The room is filling up with deputies
Poole, Biggs, Stevens, Newman
Gerard watches the numbers as the second digit locks in
(low) He's in Pullman area
Fifteen seconds for location
'  -    - Well,  am trying to solve the puzzle, Gerard and  just found a piece
Kimble takes the phone and bangs it down onto a table and we realize he is in Sykes' kitchen
- The sound startles Gerard
Three seconds
'  - (
) Kimble
Kimble leaves the phone on the table and walks out
- (into phone) You can't control this thing, Kimble
Kimble
He thinks he hears  over the phone, realizes Kimble has not hung up
What's Kimble doing
(to Renfro) Where is he
Renfro looks up from the address to Gerard, stunned
(incredulous) Holy shit
We've got a car there right now
He picks up a phone
'  -  -   - The two cops receive a radio report about Kimble and quickly exit their car
They rush toward Sykes' building

The Forensic Tech sits at desk
Kimble's prints are all over the apartment, but the concentration is here
The Tech takes out the check stubs, some papers; the pack of photos
- The Tech flips through the pack, stops on the Lentz/Sykes photos
He flips through the pack but paused here
He hands the Lentz/Sykes photo
Let me see the negatives
The Tech hands him the strip of negative film
Gerard holds it up to the light

Gerard stares at the photo as his

) (on radio) Here he comes
: '  -  - Fredrick Sykes, the one-armed man, comes down the side walk
He passes a car and hears the door open behind him
Biggs climbs out of the car and falls into step behind him
Sykes hears the footsteps but moves on up the stoop and starts to enter his apartment, notices the front door already open
Cops and Marshals in his house
Processing a crime scene

Gerard stares at Sykes
You had a break-in, Mr
Sykes
You a cop

Sykes is caught off guard
This morning a fugitive named Richard Kimble made a call from your apartment
Sykes is dumbfounded
Richard Kimble

He claimed the killer had a prosthetic limb
You telling me he's coming after me
Would he have a reason to

Gerard holds his look
Look, a year ago some people came to see me
They asked me questions about the night of the murder and 'll tell you the same thing  told them
wasn't even in town then
was on a business trip
Gerard continues moving around the apartment
What kind of business are you in, Mr
Sykes
Security
Independent
No,  work for a pharmaceutical company
handle security for its top executives
Gerard holds up one of the fishing photographs with Lentz
Any idea why Kimble would be interested in these
No
Just some doctors on a company junket
Gerard puts the photos down with the one of Lentz on top
Sykes eyes it
(annoyed) Look, you mind if  talk to the cops to see if anything's missing
By all means
Sykes moves off and Gerard pockets the Lentz/Sykes photo
: '  - Gerard crosses the street with Renfro and Biggs
He's pulling our chain, Sam
If this was the guy Kimble was looking for, why call us
Kimble said he's putting together a puzzle
We don't need to put it together too, we just need to be there when he gets to the next piece
Gerard stops and looks back at Sykes' apartment
Keep somebody on him
If he moves want to know
: - Kimble moves through large medical library and turns into area marked:
: Pages turn as we get  on headings: " " Experimental and commercial names us
and at the end of the list we find: " (RDU90) Developed by Devlin-MacGregor Pharmaceuticals"
- Kimble opens to article entitled: "- " "Pharmaceutical company plans to go public on introduction of new drug, Provasic (
90)
" Kimble looks up
Now he knows why someone tried to kill him
He gathers more Devlin-Macgregor information including a prospectus, and leaves
: '   - An  answers a call
(into phone) 'm sorry sir, Dr
Nichols is at a medical conference at the Hilton
: -   - It's very important  reach him
- meeting is underway around a board room table
An moves around the table and gives Nichols a message with a number and "" written on it
'm sorry, sir, they said it was an emergency
Nichols excuses himself from the table
- Kimble answers a pay  when it
(urgent) Can you talk
: - Nichols on phone at the other end of the suite
The meeting continues behind him
As soon as he hears Kimble's voice, Nichols reacts
(low) Richard
Yes
'm on a hotel phone
What's going on
He eyes the group in the other room, moves around the corner for more privacy
As he does we notice several of the men watching
They exchange glances
found him, Charlie
found the guy that killed Helen
(shocked) What
It's all about a drug, Charlie
They tried to kill me because of a drug
Who
Devlin-MacGregor and Lentz
Lentz was supervising the
90 protocol
He knew 'd found out the drug had problems
It's Lentz
Richard, Lentz is dead
He died in an auto accident last summer
Kimble is stunned
Can you prove this about the drug
need your help
Call Mr
Roosevelt and tell him 'm coming in
: '  - The group of deputies and Gerard assemble around Gerard's information board
They've come armed with facts and theories
Gerard orchestrates the information
If you were Richard Kimble
Why would you hunt for a one-armed man you think killed your wife; find hint then leave him and call us
To throw us off his trail
Unless
What if you were a well respected surgeon and wanted to kill your wife
How would you do it
'd hire a pro
Sight unseen
Set it up to look like a robbery gone bad
How would you find him
Look in the phone book
Through a connection
Maybe through a company you did some business with
Like a pharmaceutical company
Someone in security
On the night of his wife's murder, Kimble attended a hospital benefit sponsored by Devlin-Macgregor Pharmaceutical - Sykes' company
Gerard places a Devlin-Macgregor card onto his board
But Sykes claims he was out of town
And company records support that he was on a business trip
That's an easy fix
So let's say he was in town
Did the job
Everything goes as planned with one problem
Instead of looking like a robbery gone bad, Kimble ends up being the one accused
tried, convicted
and the hit man gets away clean
So Kimble returns to hunt for and find the hit man
Why
To share the blame
He'd still go to prison
Gerard moves to the board
He takes down a card
You're underestimating the power of the good doctor
It would be his word against
Sykes'
Who would you believe
So what does Kimble do next
Get help
Gerard pins the card to the board and looks at Renfro
It says: "" Stevens, check phone records for Sykes and Kimble
Gerard moves to the door and Renfro follows
As he's leaving he hands the photo of Lentz and Sykes to Biggs
Find out who this guy is
He leaves
Biggs hands the photo to Newman
(deadpan) Why do  get all the great jobs
-   - Kimble enters the hospital through the loading dock
-  - , an ancient research assistant, opens the door to Kimble
It sure is good to see you again, Dr
Kimble
You too, Roosevelt
Been a long time
Roosevelt closes the door behind them
- Roosevelt brings Kimble a file marked: "
90" This is the
90 file and samples
Dr
Nichols said you needed
Thanks, Roosevelt
: - cop stares up at Sykes' house from across the street
'  - Sykes watches the cops in the car outside
He moves to the phone and dials number
(
) Emergency operator
want to report a fire; No, it's not my place, it's a couple doors down
: /
'  - Kimble moves down hall and quietly enters a small research lab in the university
Dr
Wahlund sits behind her microscope and doesn't see him until he touches her on the shoulder
(startled) Oh, my God
Richard
loaned you something once, Kath, and  need them back
: '  - Sykes, dressed in coat and tie, prepares to leave apartment
Somewhere in the distance we hear:
'  - The cop stares at Sykes' window when suddenly we hear , and a pair of fire trucks turn onto the street and pull up across the street from the unmarked car -blocking the view of Sykes' house
Firemen climb down and move to a nearby building
The street begins to fill up with people
The cop stares at the commotion directly behind him
He becomes so engrossed in the action like everyone else that he fails to see Sykes, using the distraction, exit his apartment and walk calmly away from the scene
'  - Newman studies the photograph of Lentz and Sykes under a magnifying glass
- We see the logo on Lentz' shirt says: "  " -   - Sykes stands at a phone booth, finishes a call, then moves up the stairs to board an el train
- conference breaks up and Nichols moves down hallway
He slows when he sees Gerard and Renfro waiting for him
Mr
Gerard
Doctor
Could  have a minute
He opens the door to an empty meeting room
- Gerard, Nichols and Renfro
Nichols stares at a photo copy of the Sykes and Lentz fishing photo
He's a security specialist at Devlin-Macgregor Pharmaceuticals
Kimble broke into his apartment
don't know him
You're getting pretty desperate aren't you, Mr
Gerard
told you, you wouldn't find Richard
(beat) Dr
Kimble hasn't come back to you for help, has he
No
And it seems like we've been over this ground before
Now if you'll excuse me
Nichols moves to the door
Gerard looks again at the photo, then stops him
Dr
Nichols
Do you know the other man in the photograph
Nichols stops, looks at Lentz and lies
never saw him before
He leaves
Gerard watches him
Renfro looks down and sees flyer which says Nichols is slated to talk that evening in the grand ballroom
(reads) "Advances in Nuclear Tissue and Pathology Research," by Dr
Charles Nichols
(to Gerard) bet they line up to hear that one
: - Newman and Biggs enter the hospital
-
'  - : Cell structure
She works the fluorescent stains
Makes notes
Kimble helps load the next sample
Half the people in the study were indigents
No follow-up, no baseline on them
Who could say they didn't come into the study with bad livers
The one on the right is one of the samples you sent me
It shows a lot of perriportal inflammation loaded with eosinophils
When you see that with the accumulation of bile it's a classic for - - drug induced hepatitis
'm impressed
Now look at this
She positions a second slide
According to the study, this is a slice from the same liver
Kimble studies the slide
The tissue difference is markedly different, clearer
Cold normal
Clearly not from the same tissue
In fact
She yields the microscope to Kimble
See this small area of bile duct proliferation
Von Meyenberg's Complex
Occurs in only 2% of the population
But it's in every one of your five samples
Kimble looks up
That's statistically impossible
That's because they're all from the same liver
She smiles at Kimble
: - Newman shows the photo to a 40s clerk,
She looks at the photo
His name's Lentz
pathologist only remember him because he died last summer
Biggs and Newman exchange a look
Anybody down in pathology who might know something about the guy
Betty looks at the clock, it's after 6 p
m
Dicey
It's kinda late to catch anyone, but you might go by the morgue
There's an old guy down there who's been around forever
: - Sykes steps off an elevator at Chicago Memorial Hospital
And starts down a hall
: - Newman and Biggs move down the empty hallway
this long shot has never felt longer
They find the morgue
Just what  want to do before dinner
- Roosevelt working near the autopsy tables when the two marshals enter
Are you Mr
Roosevelt
Yes
We're United States Marshals
We're trying to find out some information about a pathologist, named Lentz
He used to be on staff here
Roosevelt suddenly goes on the defensive
He's dead
Yeah, we heard
We wanted to know if he knew or had any contact with Dr
Richard Kimble
On the mention of Kimble, Roosevelt becomes visibly nervous
haven't seen Dr
Kimble
Biggs and Newman exchange a look
(a probe) That's not what  asked, sir
just wanted to know if Dr
Kimble and Dr
Lentz knew each other
don't know
Excuse me,  got to go
He moves away from the autopsy table
Biggs stops him
think you're lying to us
Roosevelt looks from one marshal to the other as we: : -
'  - As Kathy packs up evidence, Kimble looks through the reports
They'd be home free if  hadn't been leaning on them to account for the livers  was seeing
And  wouldn't have seen the livers if  hadn't told the guys on my service to call me when they had cases that were bleeding excessively in surgery
Big bucks
One schmuck standing in the way
Easy, get rid of him and his wife
But why Lentz
Why not
He's one of the original patent holders
Toss the samples sent, replace them with healthy samples, issue the path report on the healthy stuff-piece of cake
Kimble notices something in the report
When did Lentz die
Oh, last summer sometime
August
Why
Kimble looks up from the protocol report
Because a good third of the samples Lentz approved were signed after he died
Kathy comes to look at the report
Lentz's signature is on reports dated October, November, December
Someone else used Lentz's name
pathologist at Devlin-Macgregor
They wouldn't have had the access
They would have needed someone at the hospital
Kimble opens the Devlin-Macgregor prospectus he took from the medical library and opens it to the beginning
photo gets his attention
He takes the bag and starts for the door
Where are you going
To see an old friend
: '  - Gerard at his board
The cards form a triangle: Sykes Devlin-Macgregor - Lentz with Kimble at the apex
He stares at the board
Poole comes to the door
It's Newman
Line two
-  - Kimble slips down corridor
We see someone following him
It is Sykes
- Newman on portable phone
Behind him Biggs questions Mr
Roosevelt
The old guy didn't know where he was going
But he picked up some tissue samples
Tissue samples
Gerard goes to his board
Renfro listens on the speakerphone
From a drug study
And signed for by Dr
Charles Nichols
Renfro and Gerard exchange a look
Nichols also knew Lentz
He was a pathologist
He was covering for Kimble
(to Renfro) Get  to bring in Sykes
Gerard stares at the board
: - Kimble moves through steam tunnel beneath the hospital
It is lined with old furniture and supplies
few moments later we see Sykes following
: - cordial  steps up to the microphone
The room is filled with doctors seated at tables around the room
It is the end of a dinner symposium
Tonight to close our conference, we're honored to hear a report from one of the most respected men in his field
: - Kimble exits the hospital and moves toward Hospital E1 Station
- As the Host continues his introduction of the keynote speaker we  the  of distinguished medical men and women
He is the
Jude Robinson Fellow and Administrative Chief of Pathology at Chicago Memorial Hospital
and just recently has been appointed member of the board of directors for Devlin-Macgregor Pharmaceuticals
Please welcome
and   Charles Nichols
Dr
Charles Nichols
Nichols rises to applause and moves to the podium
- Kimble starts up the stairs to the station just as a train is coming in
Kimble moves down the platform and boards the downtown train
Just before the doors close Sykes steps onto the last car
The train moves out
: '  - Gerard stares at his board
Stevens comes to the door
checked Sykes' calls for the last two years against Kimble's like you asked and found nothing
All right
It was a thought
He goes back to the board but Stevens isn't finished
But when  cross-checked Kimble's phone records
one came up
Gerard looks up
Kimble called Sykes
(calling) Renfro
Get
to bring in Sykes
Night of his wife's murder - seven-thirty in the evening from his car
Gerard stares at the deputy, thinking - something doesn't click
Stevens sees the empty stare, then Gerard looks back at his board
have the phone record right here
(calling) Poole
Bring me Kimble's arrest report, now
(to Stevens) No, Stevens
believe you
Poole enters with Kimble's arrest transcript
Gerard takes the transcript as Renfro appears at the door
Sam,
just checked Sykes' apartment
He's not there
As Gerard looks up, we - : -   - Sits in the front car
There are very few other riders
man with newspaper sits across the car reading
The headlines facing Kimble say: "  "
Kimble's booking photo stares back at him
Kimble reacts to the headline, looks away as the man turns the pages
The man looks over the newspaper at Kimble, then goes back to reading
moment later he folds the paper back to the front page
The man looks up from the paper and looks at Kimble again, then down
Coolly the man folds the paper, tucks it under his arm, stands, looks through the car, then moves into one of the rear cars
Kimble looks out the window - hoping desperately for his car to reach the station
He keeps his head turned until the man is gone
-     - From the center of Kimble's car we see the man with the newspaper move up to a
They begin talking
Kimble stands, coming  the
We see him watching the discussion
Suddenly a man, sitting in the rear of the car, stands and blocks Kimble's view of the Cop
It's Sykes
His gun is drawn
Back up
Move to the door, Doc
: -  '  - Transit Cop moves past the man with the newspaper toward Kimble's car
(to radio) This is transit unit, 23
have a possible sighting of Richard Kimble
Northbound coming into the Balbo station
Request immediate back-up at the station
He moves toward the connecting door to Kimble's car
: '  - The train is not yet to the station
He has no escape
Sykes moves toward him
This is my stop, Doc
Kimble stares hard at Sykes
He steps toward the side exit
Good, it's my stop, too
Suddenly the door behind Sykes opens and the Transit Cop enters
Kimble
(to Sykes) Sir, move away from him
Sykes - the gun tucked next to his side - turns
The Cop sees Sykes' gun, reacts
But Sykes  first, shoots the cop
As the Cop falls, Sykes turns quickly to finish Kimble
But Kimble pulls the emergency brake over the door
- The brakes lock
The
- Passengers are thrown off their feet
Bags and briefcases go flying
'  - Sykes is thrown forward toward Kimble who holds onto a bar for balance
- The train stops just short of the station
Only the first two windows of the front car are over the platform
'  - Sykes is thrown to the floor - the gun slips from his grasp
Kimble moves for the gun as Sykes comes up, catches Kimble in the stomach, knocks him back
The fight carries on throughout the car
Kimble reaches the gun first, lifts it in his left hand and aims at Sykes
Sykes sees the gun in Kimble's hand and almost smiles
Go ahead
You don't have it in you
For a moment Kimble almost fires, but instead he takes the gun in his right hand and whips it across Sykes' face
Then hits Sykes again and again with the butt of the gun, driving him down the length of the car, knocking him almost unconscious
Kimble tucks the gun in his belt and moves to the Transit Cop
He checks for a pulse - there is none
The Cop is dead
Kimble takes the handcuffs and keys from the case on the Cop's belt
He reaches for Sykes' wrist, drags him to the Cop and cuffs Sykes to the dead Cop
He pockets the keys and grabs Sykes' hair, pulls his face off the floor
Not as easy as Helen, was it
(slams Sykes' head down, leaves) You missed your stop
He moves to the front of the car with Sykes' and the Transit Cop's guns out
People back out of his way
He moves to where the first two windows extend over the platform, kicks out the front window and
-  - drops to the station platform
Kimble lowers his head and moves down the uncrowded platform to the station
'  - The report comes off the scanner

) units in the vicinity of Balbo Street station

Gerard, Renfro and Poole trade looks
Gerard moves toward the door
Balbo station
That's - (cutting him off) Poole, get Biggs and Newman
They're gone as we - : - Police cruisers pull outside the station

(quietly to himself) Damn
-   /  - Kimble moves up escalators from the underground station into the Hilton
- Disheveled and driven, he moves from the escalators to the lobby - checks the list of hospitality suites and sees board which indicates Nichols speech in the rooftop ballroom
He moves on to the main elevators
: - Nichols speaking
As he talks we
Listening - the same men we saw in the hospitality suite when Nichols talked to Kimble
As we    one of the men, we notice his name tag says: Board of Directors
Devlin-MacGregor Pharmaceuticals
- Kimble rides alone to the rooftop ballroom
: - Gerard's car pulls up in front of the hotel
Police are controlling pedestrians
Newman and Biggs, already decked out in Kevlar, meet him
just reported - heard
Was it Kimble
Conflicting reports, but the cops are considering him a shooter
Heavily-armed  units pull up
Gerard stares at the police presence
He starts toward the hotel where Kelly is conferring with Kevlar-decked police captain
Witnesses say he entered hotel from the subway
Okay
want it locked down
Start on the lower levels
The captain moves off
Gerard intercepts the cop
That's my man in there, Kelly
Not since he took down one of ours, Gerard
This is a police matter, now
Stay, the hell, out of it
Kelly moves off
Gerard watches him a moment then he looks up to the roof
Newman hands Gerard his belt with his backup piece

man tries to stop him at the doors, Kimble simply moves him out of the way and opens the doors to: : - Nichols moves to the last of his speech as Kimble enters at the rear And  especially would like to thank my researchers who helped me
Nichols stops his speech - stunned to see Kimble
Richard
What's wrong, Charlie
Surprised
Kimble begins moving down the aisle past the tables of doctors toward the podium
We see the faces of Kimble's colleagues and friends from the ballroom sequence earlier
At first no one notices Kimble but as he makes his way toward the dais, the applause fades and then room quiets
Whispers of: It's Richard
It's Kimble
Stunned expressions
Kimble continues to the front, talking to Nichols as if the room were empty
After Lentz died, you were the only one that had access to the pathology reports
Nichols remains calm
Reports
What are you
You switched the samples and falsified the reports so
90 could get approval
Richard,  don't know what you're talking about
have a set of the original samples
Nichols stares at Kimble and for the first time we see a flicker of concern
You almost pulled it off, Charlie
But  know all about it now, and can prove it
Nichols and Kimble hold a look
Nichols turns to the audience
Ladies and gentlemen
My friend, as you can see, is obviously not well
Richard, if you want to talk - didn't come here to talk Nichols leaves the dais and heads toward the exit
Kimble tracks along with him - moving through the tables - passing the table with the Devlin-MacGregor board of directors
They are disturbed by this situation
Moves through a door and exits into
Kimble follows moving through the tables and people to reach the door
As soon as he's gone there are calls for "security

and is immediately smashed with a chair by Nichols
Kimble goes flying, stunned
Nichols locks the door
Your best quality, Richard, is that you don't give up - Nichols pulls Kimble to his feet
even when it's clearly in your best interest to
He hits him again, drives him back into the library
Kimble tries to recover as Nichols relentlessly stays on him
He pulls him up, slams him against the fire escape doors
always knew that 'd have to kill you
He drives a blow into Kimble's stomach
Now,  must thank you for giving me 200 witnesses tonight who will support me
when  tell them it was self-defense
He shoves Kimble through the door out into
- and almost over the railing
Kimble grabs the rail to keep from dropping to the street
Nichols closes on him, but Kimble rolls away at the last minute and knocks Nichols back against the other side of fire escape
You missed your chance, Charlie
Nichols charges Kimble, but Kimble drives him back with two crushing blows that send Nichols down the stairs
Kimble moves down the stairs after him - passing under a security camera

Two security personnel sit in front of their console

The elevator doors open to a flood of confused and disoriented doctors trying to escape
The marshals wade through, meet up with two hotel security guards
This way

They are silhouetted by the lights of the city skyline
want to know, Charlie
was it worth it
This thing is bigger than even you think, Richard
You can't stop it
He hits Nichols again with tremendous force, knocking him against the parapet
Nichols stares over the edge - the street appears far below
- Gerard and his deputies work their way into the ballroom
The deputies move to separate areas
Several doctors point them in the direction Kimble and Nichols fled

- He is almost to the end of the roof when Kimble tackles him
The two men crash against sloped glass roof of an elevator housing

Hits the emergency stop and the doors open
He disappears into
- a huge industrial laundry room
Steam rises from the giant machines
/ - Kimble drops from the ceiling into the car and moves carefully into the laundry
like an industrial jungle
Dimly lit, filled with Five hundred pound bags of laundry move from a network of ceiling tracks to a pair of heavyduty conveyor belts and two thirty-foot long washers
At the other end of the washers, hydraulic presses stamp out three-foot diameter "cakes" which are moved by conveyor and dollies to automated dryers
The  is
- Gerard comes down back stairwell
Followed by Renfro
(to radio) Where did the elevator stop
: Newman checks the computer board for the elevator position
(to radio) Level five
- Nichols pushes through the hanging laundry bags toward an exit, tries the door
It is secured with a collapsible grating with a padlock
He looks up, keeps moving
Notices the swinging bags, follows Nichols' trail
He stops to get his bearings, sees shadow at the far end of the room between the two washers
Kimble closes in, moving between the large conveyors
- Gerard enters sorting room with Renfro
He sees two sorters standing by a small conveyor as he enters
Get out of here
He and Renfro move around the corner where a laundry worker is hooking a 500 lb bag of lines onto the overhead rail
hydraulic lift, operated by a hanging on/off switch raises the bag on a yellow steel -beam
The worker takes one look at Gerard and abandons his station
Gerard, Biggs and Renfro move to the closed doors of the main room
(to Renfro) We're going in
Give me five minutes
Keep
out
He draws his Glock, opens the door and enters the main room
-   - He moves to end of washers, using the machines as cover
He sees the shadow again takes a pole leaning against the dryer as a weapon, turns the corner and is about to belt him when he realizes it's not Nichols, but a laundry worker
Kimble moves away from the terrified man, when he hears a voice from the other end of the laundry
(
) (above the din) Kimble
Kimble reacts to Gerard's voice, moves away
Moving behind machinery, sees light at far end of the room where Gerard enters
The door closes automatically behind Gerard and Renfro
They enter the noisy main room and separate
Renfro moves up the far side of the room, Gerard up the center
Both move slowly through the maze of bags, carts, automated equipment
There is no way out of here
The building is locked down
: Moves instinctively back into the machinery and carts near the conveyor belts
(
) Kimble
know about Nichols know about Sykes
Kimble stops
Nichols borrowed your car the night of the murder and called Sykes from it
Separated from Gerard
He hears a  behind him - a bag comes down the track at break-neck speed, Renfro spins, dodges it, gets his bearings and continues
Listening
He watches the movement of bags as he did with Nichols
Moving through the forest of massive bags
That's why there was no forced entry at your house
He'd used your keys
Realizing what Gerard knows
Considering his next move
Also listening
He realizes Gerard now knows he's the killer
He moves behind the water softener tanks and chemicals - and spots Renfro - and something else -the hanging control for the -beam
Moves carefully
Another bag comes down the track
He dodges it and steps into an open track
From here he can see straight back toward the washers
Kimble
Come meet me out here
He steps out and then back as a bag shoots by
He ducks under the bag - into the next track and suddenly hears a sound behind him
Renfro turns as an -beam comes rushing down the open track and knocks him to the floor, opening a gash across the side of his head
He lays still
Steps out of the shadows, turns him over exposing his empty shoulder harness and takes the gun from Renfro's hand
Nichols moves toward Gerard with the gun
Oblivious to this action, moves on, passes the conveyor belts
He makes one last appeal
It's time to quit running
if you don't, you know 'll stop you
He listens, there is no answer
Starts to move out to meet Gerard, sees Renfro down
His shoulder harness is empty
He knows Nichols is armed
Moves into the alley between the two giant washers
He pauses, looks back, then continues, when he turns his back on us
Steps   behind him and slowly takes aim
Just before he fires however he hears
(
) Hey, Chuckles
Nichols turns toward the voice as Kimble swings the stick and clocks him - sending the gun skittering on the floor behind Gerard
Turns on the sound and finds his gun trained on Kimble with Nichols at his feet, unconscious
He realizes instantly that Kimble saved his life and lowers his gun
Kimble, exhausted, leans against the washer
They hold a look as deputies and police flood into the room surrounding Kimble and handcuffing him

-  () Chicago Police hold back crowds of onlookers on Michigan Avenue
Police cars and vans, television news trucks vie for space in front of the Hilton Towers
Dr
Charles Nichols, on a stretcher, loaded into an ambulance
The doors close
and television cameramen line the sidewalk giving reports and interviewing doctors from the ballroom
We   pieces of their reports as we   them the entrance
As we reported a few minutes ago, the saga of once-prominent Chicago surgeon, Dr
Richard Kimble, who escaped from an Illinois Corrections bus, took a strange twist this evening when Dr
Kimble was captured at the Chicago Hilton
continues: there are unconfirmed reports from police of new evidence which may exonerate Kimble while implicating some of the biggest names in medicine
The doors to the police van close amid a flurry of photographs
third reporter interviews a   from the ballroom: He just walked in
We didn't know what he was going to do
My wife was very frightened
The next thing  knew cops were charging in and
: - Kimble, in handcuffs, is escorted by Biggs, Newman, Poole and Gerard, out of the hotel into the waiting chaos
Renfro, his head bandaged, is helped by paramedics
/
- As soon as the group exits the hotel
Television lights flood the scene
Kimble lowers his head
Reporters crowd forward, yelling questions
Dr
Kimble, is it true you can prove your innocence
Gerard wants the crowd controlled
(to police) Get them back
The marshals ant cops clear a line for Kimble to get into a waiting car away from the media
Biggs opens the back door and helps Kimble inside
Watch your head, Dr
Kimble
Newman climbs in behind the wheel
Gerard in the back next to Kimble
He leans out the window and motions to Poole
(to Poole) Poole, you got that thing
(to Kimble) Give me your hands
Kimble pauses, then holds up his wrists and Gerard unlocks Kimble's handcuffs
Poole hands an ice-pack over the seat
Gerard places the pack on Kimble' 9 bruised and battered hands
Take care of those hands, Doc, you're going to need them again soon
thought you told me 'you didn't care
' Yeah, well, don't spread it around
They share a look of mutual respect as the car pulls away
The car carrying Kimble pulls onto Michigan Avenue heading back downtown
As we   we see Kimble's car - at first alone on the great avenue - then gradually joined by other cars until finally becoming integrated in the traffic, movement and lights of the city
