href <b>// --> </b> Citizen Kane By Herman
Mankiewicz Orson Welles : -   - 1940 () Window, very small in the distance, illuminated
All around this is an almost totally black screen
Now, as the camera moves slowly towards the window which is almost a postage stamp in the frame, other forms appear; barbed wire, cyclone fencing, and now, looming up against an early morning sky, enormous iron grille work
Camera travels up what is now shown to be a gateway of gigantic proportions and holds on the top of it - a huge initial "" showing darker and darker against the dawn sky
Through this and beyond we see the fairy-tale mountaintop of Xanadu, the great castle a sillhouette as its summit, the little window a distant accent in the darkness
: -,      , : The literally incredible domain of
Its right flank resting for nearly forty miles on the Gulf Coast, it truly extends in all directions farther than the eye can see
Designed by nature to be almost completely bare and flat - it was, as will develop, practically all marshland when Kane acquired and changed its face - it is now pleasantly uneven, with its fair share of rolling hills and one very good- sized mountain, all man-made
Almost all the land is improved, either through cultivation for farming purposes of through careful landscaping, in the shape of parks and lakes
The castle dominates itself, an enormous pile, compounded of several genuine castles, of European origin, of varying architecture - dominates the scene, from the very peak of the mountain
: () Past which we move
The greens are straggly and overgrown, the fairways wild with tropical weeds, the links unused and not seriously tended for a long time
: : -  () Of the Hagenbeck type
All that now remains, with one exception, are the individual plots, surrounded by moats, on which the animals are kept, free and yet safe from each other and the landscape at large
(Signs on several of the plots indicate that here there were once tigers, lions, girrafes
) : () In the foreground, a great obscene ape is outlined against the dawn murk
He is scratching himself slowly, thoughtfully, looking out across the estates of Charles Foster Kane, to the distant light glowing in the castle on the hill
: () The idiot pile of sleepy dragons
Reflected in the muddy water - the lighted window
() The boat landing sags
An old newspaper floats on the surface of the water - a copy of the New York Enquirer
"  As it moves across the frame, it discloses again the reflection of the window in the castle, closer than before
() It is empty
newspaper blows across the cracked floor of the tank
: () In the shadows, literally the shadows, of the castle
As we move by, we see that their doors and windows are boarded up and locked, with heavy bars as further protection and sealing
: : () Over a wide moat, now stagnant and choked with weeds
We move across it and through a huge solid gateway into a formal garden, perhaps thirty yards wide and one hundred yards deep, which extends right up to the very wall of the castle
The landscaping surrounding it has been sloppy and causal for a long time, but this particular garden has been kept up in perfect shape
As the camera makes its way through it, towards the lighted window of the castle, there are revealed rare and exotic blooms of all kinds
The dominating note is one of almost exaggerated tropical lushness, hanging limp and despairing
Moss, moss, moss
Ankor Wat, the night the last King died
: () Camera moves in until the frame of the window fills the frame of the screen
Suddenly, the light within goes out
This stops the action of the camera and cuts the music which has been accompanying the sequence
In the glass panes of the window, we see reflected the ripe, dreary landscape of Mr
Kane's estate behind and the dawn sky
: '  -   - very long shot of Kane's enormous bed, silhouetted against the enormous window
: '  -   -
An incredible one
Big, impossible flakes of snow, a too picturesque farmhouse and a snow man
The jingling of sleigh bells in the musical score now makes an ironic reference to Indian Temple bells - the music freezes - ' Rosebud
The camera pulls back, showing the whole scene to be contained in one of those glass balls which are sold in novelty stores all over the world
hand - Kane's hand, which has been holding the ball, relaxes
The ball falls out of his hand and bounds down two carpeted steps leading to the bed, the camera following
The ball falls off the last step onto the marble floor where it breaks, the fragments glittering in the first rays of the morning sun
This ray cuts an angular pattern across the floor, suddenly crossed with a thousand bars of light as the blinds are pulled across the window
The foot of Kane's bed
The camera very close
Outlined against the shuttered window, we can see a form - the form of a nurse, as she pulls the sheet up over his head
The camera follows this action up the length of the bed and arrives at the face after the sheet has covered it
: : On the screen as the camera moves in are the words: " " Stirring, brassy music is heard on the soundtrack (which, of course, sounds more like a soundtrack than ours
) The screen in the projection room fills our screen as the second title appears: "" :  Here follows a typical news digest short, one of the regular monthly or bi-monthly features, based on public events or personalities
These are distinguished from ordinary newsreels and short subjects in that they have a fully developed editorial or storyline
Some of the more obvious characteristics of the "March of Time," for example, as well as other documentary shorts, will be combined to give an authentic impression of this now familiar type of short subject
As is the accepted procedure in these short subjects, a narrator is used as well as explanatory titles
: Legendary was the Xanadu where Kubla Kahn decreed his stately pleasure dome - (with quotes in his voice) "Where twice five miles of fertile ground, with walls and towers were girdled 'round
" (  ) Today, almost as legendary is Florida's  - world's largest private pleasure ground
Here, on the deserts of the Gulf Coast, a private mountain was commissioned, successfully built for its landlord
Here in a private valley, as in the Coleridge poem, "blossoms many an incense-bearing tree
"  Verily, "a miracle of rare device
" Opening shot of great desolate expanse of Florida coastline (1940 - ) : Series of shots showing various aspects of Xanadu, all as they might be photographed by an ordinary newsreel cameraman - nicely photographed, but not atmospheric to the extreme extent of the Prologue (1940)
(dropping the quotes) Here, for Xanadu's landlord, will be held 1940's biggest, strangest funeral; here this week is laid to rest a potent figure of our Century - America's Kubla Kahn - Charles Foster Kane
In journalism's history, other names are honored more than Charles Foster Kane's, more justly revered
Among publishers, second only to James Gordon Bennet the First: his dashing, expatriate son; England's Northcliffe and Beaverbrook; Chicago's Patterson and McCormick; : -
, ,   , Shot of a huge, screen-filling picture of Kane
Pull back to show that it is a picture on the front page of the "Enquirer," surrounded by the reversed rules of mourning, with masthead and headlines
(1940) : great number of headlines, set in different types and different styles, obviously from different papers, all announcing Kane's death, all appearing over photographs of Kane himself (perhaps a fifth of the headlines are in foreign languages)
An important item in connection with the headlines is that many of them - positively not all - reveal passionately conflicting opinions about Kane
Thus, they contain variously the words "patriot," "democrat," "pacifist," "war-monger," "traitor," "idealist," "American," etc
: 1895  1940 -      , Newsreel shots of San Francisco during and after the fire, followed by shots of special trains with large streamers: "Kane Relief Organization
"  Over these shots superimpose the date - 1906
Artist's painting of Foch's railroad car and peace negotiators, if actual newsreel shot unavailable
Over this shot sumperimpose the date - 1918
Denver's Bonfils and Sommes; New York's late, great Joseph Pulitzer; America's emperor of the news syndicate, another editorialist and landlord, the still mighty and once mightier Hearst
Great names all of them - but none of them so loved, hated, feared, so often spoken - as Charles Foster Kane
The San Francisco earthquake
First with the news were the Kane papers
First with Relief of the Sufferers, First with the news of their Relief of the Sufferers
Kane papers scoop the world on the Armistice - publish, eight hours before competitors, complete details of the Armistice teams granted the Germans by Marshall Foch from his railroad car in the Forest of Compeigne
For forty years appeared in Kane newsprint no public issue on which Kane papers took no stand
No public man whom Kane himself did not support or denounce - often support, then denounce
Its humble beginnings, a dying dailey - Shots with the date - 1898 (to be supplied) Shots with the date - 1910 (to be supplied) Shots with the date - 1922 (to be supplied) Headlines, cartoons, contemporary newreels or stills of the following: 1 The celebrated newsreel shot of about 1914
2 Breaking up of a speakeasy and such
3
4 Brief clips of old newreel shots of William Jennings Bryan, Theodore Roosevelt, Stalin, Walter
Thatcher, Al Smith, McKinley, Landon, Franklin
Roosevelt and such
Also, recent newsreels of the elderly Kane with such Nazis as Hitler and Goering; and England's Chamberlain and Churchill
Shot of a ramshackle building with old-fashioned presses showing through plate glass windows and the name "Enquirer" in old- fashioned gold letters
(1892) : Kane's empire, in its glory, held dominion over thirty-seven newpapers, thirteen magazines, a radio network
An empire upon an empire
The first of grocery stores, paper mills, apartment buildings, factories, forests, ocean-liners - An empire through which for fifty years flowed, in an unending stream, the wealth of the earth's third richest gold mine
Famed in American legend is the origin of the Kane fortune
How, to boarding housekeeper Mary Kane, by a defaulting boarder, in 1868 was left the supposedly worthless deed to an abandoned mine shaft: The Colorado Lode
The magnificent Enquirer Building of today
1891-1911 - a map of the , covering the entire screen, which in animated diagram shows the Kane publications spreading from city to city
Starting from New York, minature newboys speed madly to Chicago, Detroit, St
Louis, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, Atlanta, El Paso, etc
, screaming "Wuxtry, Kane Papers, Wuxtry
" Shot of a large mine going full blast, chimneys belching smoke, trains moving in and out, etc
large sign reads "Colorado Lode Mining Co
" (1940)  Sign reading; "Little Salem,  - 25 " : An old still shot of Little Salem as it was 70 years ago (identified by copper-plate caption beneath the still)
(1870) Shot of early tintype stills of Thomas Foster Kane and his wife, Mary, on their wedding day
similar picture of Mary Kane some four or five years later with her little boy, Charles Foster Kane
Fifty-seven years later, before a Congressional Investigation, Walter Thatcher, grand old man of Wall Street, for years chief target of Kane papers' attack on "trusts," recalls a journey he made as a youth
Shot of Capitol, in Washington
Shot of Congressional Investigating Committee (reproduction of existing
Morgan newsreel)
This runs silent under narration
Walter
Thatcher is on the stand
He is flanked by his son, Walter
Thatcher Jr
, and other partners
He is being questioned by some Merry Andrew congressmen
At this moment, a baby alligator has just been placed in his lap, causing considerable confusion and embarrassment
Newsreel close-up of Thatcher, the soundtrack of which now fades in
because of that trivial incident
It is a fact, however, is it not, that in 1870, you did go to Colorado
did
In connection with the Kane affairs
Yes
My firm had been appointed trustees by Mrs
Kane for the fortune, which she had recently acquired
It was her wish that should take charge of this boy, Charles Foster Kane
That same month in Union Square - Is it not a fact that on that occasion, the boy personally attacked you after striking you in the stomach with a sled
Loud laughter and confusion
Mr
Chairman,  will read to this committee a prepared statement have brought with me - and  will then refuse to answer any further questions
Mr
Johnson, please
young assistant hands him a sheet of paper from a briefcase
(reading it) "With full awareness of the meaning of my words and the responsibility of what  am about to say, it is my considered belief that Mr
Charles Foster Kane, in every essence of his social beliefs and by the dangerous manner in which he has persistently attacked the American traditions of private property, initiative and opportunity for advancement, is - in fact - nothing more or less than a Communist
" Newsreel of Union Square meeting, section of crowd carrying banners urging the boycott of Kane papers
speaker is on the platform above the crowd
(fading in on soundtrack) - till the words "Charles Foster Kane" are a menace to every working man in this land
He is today what he has always been and always will be -
And yet another opinion - Kane's own
Silent newsreel on a windy platform, flag-draped, in front of the magnificent Enquirer building
On platform, in full ceremonial dress, is Charles Foster Kane
He orates silently
: " ,  ,       -
" Same locale, Kane shaking hands out of frame
Another newsreel shot, much later, very brief, showing Kane, older and much fatter, very tired-looking, seated with his second wife in a nightclub
He looks lonely and unhappy in the midst of the gaiety
Twice married, twice divorced - first to a president's niece, Emily Norton - today, by her second marriage, chatelaine of the oldest of England's stately homes
Sixteen years after that - two weeks after his divorce from Emily Norton - Kane married Susan Alexander, singer, at the Town Hall in Trenton, New Jersey
: Period still of Emily Norton (1900)
: Reconstructed silent newsreel
Kane, Susan, and Bernstein emerging from side doorway of City Hall into a ring of press photographers, reporters, etc
Kane looks startled, recoils for an instance, then charges down upon the photographers, laying about him with his stick, smashing whatever he can hit
For wife two, one-time opera singing Susan Alexander, Kane built Chicago's Municipal Opera House
Cost: three million dollars
Conceived for Susan Alexander Kane, half-finished before she divorced him, the still unfinished Xanadu
Cost: no man can say
Still of architect's sketch with typically glorified "rendering" of the Chicago Municipal Opera House
: glamorous shot of the almost-finished Xanadu, a magnificent fairy-tale estate built on a mountain
(1920) Then shots of its preparation
(1917) Shots of truck after truck, train after train, flashing by with tremendous noise
Shots of vast dredges, steamshovels
Shot of ship standing offshore unloading its lighters
In quick succession, shots follow each other, some reconstructed, some in miniature, some real shots (maybe from the dam projects) of building, digging, pouring concrete, etc
One hundred thousand trees, twenty thousand tons of marble, are the ingredients of Xanadu's mountain
Xanadu's livestock: the fowl of the air, the fish of the sea, the beast of the field and jungle - two of each; the biggest private zoo since Noah
Contents of Kane's palace: paintings, pictures, statues, the very stones of many another palace, shipped to Florida from every corner of the earth, from other Kane houses, warehouses, where they mouldered for years
Enough for ten museums - the loot of the world
More shots as before, only this time we see (in miniature) a large mountain - at different periods in its development - rising out of the sands
Shots of elephants, apes, zebras, etc
being herded, unloaded, shipped, etc
in various ways
Shots of packing cases being unloaded from ships, from trains, from trucks, with various kinds of lettering on them (Italian, Arabian, Chinese, etc
) but all consigned to Charles Foster Kane, Xanadu, Florida
reconstructed still of Xanadu - the main terrace
group of persons in clothes of the period of 1917
In their midst, clearly recognizable, are Kane and Susan
Kane urged his country's entry into one war, opposed participation in another
Swung the election to one American President at least, was called another's assassin
Thus, Kane's papers might never have survived - had not the President
: ,    - , , Shots of various authentically worded headlines of American papers since 1895
Spanish-American War shots
(1898) graveyard in France of the World War and hundreds of crosses
(1919) Old newsreels of a political campaign
Insert of a particularly virulent headline and/or cartoon
: " " Kane, molder of mass opinion though he was, in all his life was never granted elective office by the voters of his country
Few
news publishers have been
Few, like one-time Congressman Hearst, have ever run for any office - most know better - conclude with other political observers that one man's press has power enough for himself
But Kane papers were once strong indeed, and once the prize seemed almost his
In 1910, as Independent Candidate for governor, the best elements of the state behind him - the White House seemingly the next easy step in a lightning political career - , ,    - (1910) : : -   , Newsreel shots of great crowds streaming into a building - Madison Square Garden - then shots inside the vast auditorium, at one end of which is a huge picture of Kane
(1910) Shot of box containing the first Mrs
Kane and young Howard Kane, age five
They are acknowledging the cheers of the crowd
(Silent Shot)  (1910) Newreel shot of dignitaries on platform, with Kane, alongside of speaker's table, beaming, hand upraised to silence the crowd
(Silent Shot)  (1910) Then, suddenly - less than one week before election - defeat
Shameful, ignominious - defeat that set back for twenty years the cause of reform in the
, forever cancelled political chances for Charles Foster Kane
Then, in the third year of the Great Depression
As to all publishers, it sometimes must - to Bennett, to Munsey and Hearst it did - a paper closes
For Kane, in four short years: collapse
Eleven Kane papers, four Kane magazines merged, more sold, scrapped - Newreel shot - closeup of Kane delivering a speech
(1910) The front page of a contemporary paper - a screaming headline
Twin phots of Kane and Susan
(1910) Printed title about Depression
Once more repeat the map of the  1932-1939
Suddenly, the cartoon goes into reverse, the empire begins to shrink, illustrating the narrator's words
The door of a newspaper office with the signs: "Closed
" Then four long years more - alone in his never-finished, already decaying, pleasure palace, aloof, seldom visited, never photographed, Charles Foster Kane continued to direct his falling empire
vainly attempting to sway, as he once did, the destinies of a nation that has ceased to listen to him ceased to trust him
(1940) Series of shots, entirely modern, but rather jumpy and obviously bootlegged, showing Kane in a bath chair, swathed in summer rugs, being perambulated through his rose garden, a desolate figure in the sunshine
(1935) Last week, death came to sit upon the throne of America's Kubla Khan - last week, as it must to all men, death came to Charles Foster Kane
: Cabinent Photograph (Full Screen) of Kane as an old, old man
This image remains constant on the screen (as camera pulls back, taking in the interior of a dark projection room
-  - fairly large one, with a long throw to the screen
It is dark
The image of Kane as an old man remains constant on the screen as camera pulls back, slowly taking in and registering Projection Room
This action occurs, however, only after the first few lines of encuring dialogue have been spoken
The shadows of the men speaking appear as they rise from their chairs - black against the image of Kane's face on the screen
:  These are the editors of a "News Digest" short, and of the Rawlston magazines
All his enterprises are represented in the projection room, and Rawlston himself, that great man, is present also and will shortly speak up
During the entire course of this scene, nobody's face is really seen
Sections of their bodies are picked out by a table light, a silhouette is thrown on the screen, and their faces and bodies are themselves thrown into silhouette against the brilliant slanting rays of light from the projection room
Third Man is on the telephone
We see a corner of his head and the phone
(at phone) Stand by
'll tell you if we want to run it again
(hangs up) ' Well
short pause
' It's a tough thing to do in a newsreel
Seventy years of a man's life - Murmur of highly salaried assent at this
Rawlston walks toward camera and out of the picture
Others are rising
Camera during all of this, apparently does its best to follow action and pick up faces, but fails
Actually, all set-ups are to be planned very carefully to exclude the element of personality from this scene; which is expressed entirely by voices, shadows, sillhouettes and the big, bright image of Kane himself on the screen
See what Arthur Ellis wrote about him in the American review
read it
(its owner is already leaning across the table, holding a piece of paper under the desk light and reading from it) Listen:  Kane is dead
He contributed to the journalism of his day - the talent of a mountebank, the morals of a bootlegger, and the manners of a pasha
He and his kind have almost succeeded in transforming a once noble profession into a seven percent security - no longer secure
That's what Arthur Ellis is writing now
Thirty years ago, when Kane gave him his chance to clean up Detroit and Chicago and St
Louis, Kane was the greatest guy in the world
If you ask me - Charles Foster Kane was a
Then observations are made almost simultaneous
' Just a minute
Camera moves to take in his bulk outlined against the glow from the projection room
What were Kane's last words
silence greets this
What were the last words he said on earth
Thompson, you've made us a good short, but it needs character - ' Motivation - That's it - motivation
What made Kane what he was
And, for that matter, what was he
What we've just seen are the outlines of a career - what's behind the career
What's the man
Was he good or bad
Strong or foolish
Tragic or silly
Why did he do all those things
What was he after
(then, appreciating his point) Maybe he told us on his death bed
Yes, and maybe he didn't
Ask the question anyway, Thompson
Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it
know, but - (riding over him like any other producer) All we saw on that screen was a big American - One of the biggest
(without pausing for this) But how is he different from Ford
Or Hearst for that matter
Or Rockefeller - or John Doe
know people worked for Kane will tell you - not only in the newspaper business - look how he raised salaries
You don't want to forget - You take his labor record alone, they ought to hang him up like a dog
tell you, Thompson - a man's dying words - ' What were they
Silence
' (hesitant) Yes, Mr
Rawlston, what were Kane's dying words
(with disgust) Rosebud
little ripple of laughter at this, which is promptly silenced by Rawlston
That's right
Tough guy, huh
(derisively) Dies calling for Rosebud
Here's a man who might have been President
He's been loved and hated and talked about as much as any man in our time - but when he comes to die, he's got something on his mind called "Rosebud
" What does that mean
racehorse he bet on once, probably, that didn't come in - Rosebud
All right
But what was the race
There is a short silence
Thompson
Yes, sir
Hold this thing up for a week
Two weeks if you have to
(feebly) But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days it might be better than if - (decisively) Nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick
Go after the people that knew Kane well
That manager of his - the little guy, Bernstein, those two wives, all the people who knew him, had worked for him, who loved him, who hated his guts - (pauses) don't mean go through the City Directory, of course - The Third Man gives a hearty "yes-man" laugh
'll get to it right away, Mr
Rawlston
(rising) Good
The camera from behind him, outlines his back against Kane's picture on the screen
' It'll probably turn out to be a very simple thing
: :  Now begins the story proper - the seach by Thompson for the facts about Kane - his researches
his interviews with the people who knew Kane
It is important to remember always that only at the very end of the story is Thompson himself a personality
Until then, throughout the picture, we photograph only Thompson's back, shoulders, or his shadow - sometimes we only record his voice
He is not until the final scene a "character"
He is the personification of the search for the truth about Charles Foster Kane
He is the investigator
: - " " -   -  - 1940 () - The first image to register is a sign: " " These words, spelled out in neon, glow out of the darkness at the end of the fade out
Then there is lightning which reveals a squalid roof-top on which the sign stands
Thunder again, and faintly the sound of music from within
light glows from a skylight
The camera moves to this and closes in
Through the splashes of rain, we see through the skylight down into the interior of the cabaret
Directly below us at a table sits the lone figure of a woman, drinking by herself
: " "  -  - Medium shot of the same woman as before, finishing the drink she started to take above
It is Susie
The music, of course, is now very loud
Thompson, his back to the camera, moves into the picture in the close foreground
Captain appears behind Susie, speaking across her to Thompson
(a Greek) This is Mr
Thompson, Miss Alexander
Susan looks up into Thompson's face
She is fifty, trying to look much younger, cheaply blonded, in a cheap, enormously generous evening dress
Blinking up into Thompson's face, she throws a crink into ther mouth
Her eyes, which she thinks is keeping commandingly on his, are bleared and watery
(to the Captain) want another drink, John
Low thunder from outside
(seeing his chance) Right away
Will you have something, Mr
Thompson
(staring to sit down) 'll have a highball
(so insistently as to make Thompson change his mind and stand up again) Who told you you could sit down here
Oh
thought maybe we could have a drink together
Think again
There is an awkward pause as Thompson looks from her to the Captain
Why don't you people let me alone
'm minding my own business
You mind yours
If you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander
All  want to ask you
Get out of here
(almost hysterical) Get out
Get out
Thompson looks at the Captain, who shrugs his shoulders
'm sorry
Maybe some other time - If he thought he would get a response from Susan, who thinks she is looking at him steelily, he realizes his error
He nods and walks off, following the Captain out the door
She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr
Thompson
'm not from a newspaper exactly, - They have come upon a waiter standing in front of a booth
(to the waiter) Get her another highball
Another double
(after a moment, pityingly) Yes
They walk to the door
She's plastered, isn't she
She'll snap out of it
Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr
Kane as about anybody
Sooner
'll come down in a week or so and see her again
Say, you might be able to help me
When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud
Rosebud
Thompson has just handed him a bill
The Captain pockets it
Thank you, sir
As a matter of fact, yesterday afternoon, when it was in all the papers -  asked her
She never heard of Rosebud
: : -  - An excruciatingly noble interpretation of Mr
Thatcher himself executed in expensive marble
He is shown seated on one of those improbable Edwin Booth chairs and is looking down, his stone eyes fixed on the camera
We move down off of this, showing the impressive pedestal on which the monument is founded
The words, "Walter Parks Thatcher" are prominently and elegantly engraved thereon
Immediately below the inscription we encounter, in a medium shot, the person of Bertha Anderson, an elderly, manish spinnster, seated behind her desk
Thompson, his hat in his hand, is standing before her
Bertha is on the phone
(into phone) Yes
'll take him in now
(hangs up and looks at Thompson) The directors of the Thatcher Library have asked me to remind you again of the condition under which you may inspect certain portions of Mr
Thatcher's unpublished memoirs
Under no circumstances are direct quotations from his manuscript to be used by you
That's all right
You may come with me
Without watching whether he is following her or not, she rises and starts towards a distant and imposingly framed door
Thompson, with a bit of a sigh, follows
: : -    -  - room with all the warmth and charm of Napolean's tomb
As we dissolve in, the door opens in and we see past Thompson's shoulders the length of the room
Everything very plain, very much made out of marble and very gloomy
Illumination from a skylight above adds to the general air of expensive and classical despair
The floor is marble, and there is a gigantic, mahogany table in the center of everything
Beyond this is to be seen, sunk in the marble wall at the far end of the room, the safe from which a guard, in a khaki uniform, with a revolver holster at his hip, is extracting the journal of Walter
Thatcher
He brings it to Bertha as if he were the guardian of a bullion shipment
During this, Bertha has been speaking
(to the guard) Pages eighty-three to one hundred and forty-two, Jennings
Yes, Miss Anderson
(to Thompson) You will confine yourself, it is our understanding, to the chapter dealing with Mr
Kane
That's all 'm interested in
The guard has, by this time, delivered the precious journal
Bertha places it reverently on the table before Thompson
You will be required to leave this room at four-thirty promptly
She leaves
Thompson starts to light a cigarette
The guard shakes his head
With a sigh, Thompson bends over to read the manuscript
Camera moves down over his shoulder onto page of manuscript
Manuscript, neatly and precisely written: " ,     , , , , 1870
" The camera has not held on the entire page
It has been following the words with the same action that the eye does the reading
On the last words, the white page of the paper : '  -  - The white of a great field of snow, seen from the angle of a parlor window
In the same position of the last word in above Insert, appears the tiny figure of Charles Foster Kane, aged five (almost like an animated cartoon)
He is in the act of throwing a snowball at the camera
It sails toward us and over our heads, out of scene
Reverse angle - on the house featuring a large sign reading: ' Charles Kane's snowball hits the sign
-
'  -  - Camera is angling through the window, but the window-frame is not cut into scene
We see only the field of snow again, same angle as in previous scene
Charles is manufacturing another snowball
Now - Camera pulls back, the frame of the window appearing, and we are inside the parlor of the boardinghouse
Mrs
Kane, aged about 28, is looking out towards her son
Just as we take her in she speaks: (calling out) Be careful, Charles
' Mrs
Kane - (Calling out the window almost on top of this) Pull your muffler around your neck, Charles - But Charles, deliriously happy in the snow, is oblivious to this and is running away
Mrs
Kane turns into camera and we see her face - a strong face, worn and kind
' think we'll have to tell him now - Camera now pulls back further, showing Thatcher standing before a table on which is his stove-pipe hat and an imposing multiplicity of official-looking documents
He is 26 and, as might be expected, a very stuffy young man, already very expensive and conservative looking, even in Colorado
'll sign those papers - You people seem to forget that 'm the boy's father
At the sound of Kane Sr
's voice, both have turned to him and the camera pulls back still further, taking him in
Kane Sr
, who is the assistant curator in a livery stable, has been groomed as elegantly as is likely for this meeting ever since daybreak
From outside the window can be heard faintly the wild and cheerful cries of the boy, blissfully cavorting in the snow
It's going to be done exactly the way 've told Mr
Thatcher - If  want to,  can go to court
father has a right to - (annoyed) Mr
Kane, the certificates that Mr
Graves left here are made out to Mrs
Kane, in her name
Hers to do with as she pleases - Well,  don't hold with signing my boy away to any bank as guardian just because - (quietly) want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim
The Bank's decision in all matters concerning his education, his place of residence and similar subjects will be final
(clears his throat) The idea of a bank being the guardian - Mrs
Kane has met his eye
Her triumph over him finds expression in his failure to finish his sentence
(even more quietly) want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim
We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs
Kane, are the sole owner
Kane Sr
opens his mouth once or twice, as if to say something, but chokes down his opinion
(has been reading past Thatcher's shoulder as he talked) Where do  sign, Mr
Thatcher
Right here, Mrs
Kane
(sulkily) Don't say  didn't warn you
Mrs
Kane lifts the quill pen
Mary, 'm asking you for the last time - anyon'd think  hadn't been a good husband and a - Mrs
Kane looks at him slowly
He stops his speech
The sum of fifty thousand dollars a year is to be paid to yourself and Mr
Kane as long as you both live, and thereafter the survivor - Mrs
Kane puts pen to the paper and signs
Well, let's hope it's all for the best
It is
Go on, Mr
Thatcher - Mrs
Kane, listening to Thatcher, of course has had her other ear bent in the direction of the boy's voice
Thatcher is aware both of the boy's voice, which is counter to his own, and of Mrs
Kane's divided attention
As he pauses, Kane Sr
genteelly walks over to close the window
'  -  - Kane Jr
, seen from Kane Sr
's position at the window
He is advancing on the snowman, snowballs in his hands, dropping to one knee the better to confound his adversary
If the rebels want a fight boys, let's give it to 'em
He throws two snowballs, missing widely, and gets up and advances another five feet before getting on his knees again
The terms are underconditional surrender
Up and at 'em
The Union forever
-
'  -  - Kane Sr
closes the window
(over the boy's voice) Everything else - the principal as well as all monies earned - is to be administered by the bank in trust for your son, Charles Foster Kane, until his twenty-fifth birthday, at which time he is to come into complete possession
Mrs
Kane rises and goes to the window
Go on, Mr
Thatcher
Thatcher continues as she opens the window
His voice, as before, is heard with overtones of the boy's
'  -  - Kane Jr
, seen from Mrs
Kane's position at the window
He is now within ten feet of the snowman, with one snowball left which he is holding back in his right hand
You can't lick Andy Jackson
Old Hickory, that's me
He fires his snowball, well wide of the mark and falls flat on his stomach, starting to crawl carefully toward the snowman
' It's nearly five, Mrs
Kane, don't you think 'd better meet the boy - -
'  -  - Mrs
Kane at the window
Thatcher is now standing at her side
've got his trunk all packed - (she chokes a little) 've it packed for a couple of weeks - She can't say anymore
She starts for the hall day
Kane Sr
, ill at ease, has no idea of how to comfort her
've arranged for a tutor to meet us in Chicago
'd have brought him along with me, but you were so anxious to keep everything secret - He stops as he realizes that Mrs
Kane has paid no attention to him and, having opened the door, is already well into the hall that leads to the side door of the house
He takes a look at Kane Sr
, tightens his lips and follows Mrs
Kane
Kane, shoulders thrown back like one who bears defeat bravely, follows him
'  -  - Kane, in the snow-covered field
With the snowman between him and the house, he is holding the sled in his hand, just about to make the little run that prefaces a belly-flop
The Kane house, in the background, is a dilapidated, shabby, two-story frame building, with a wooden outhouse
Kane looks up as he sees the single file procession, Mrs
Kane at its head, coming toward him
'ya, Mom
Mrs
Kane smiles
(gesturing at the snowman) See, Mom
took the pipe out of his mouth
If it keeps on snowin', maybe 'll make some teeth and - You better come inside, son
You and  have got to get you all ready for - for - Charles, my name is Mr
Thatcher - This is Mr
Thatcher, Charles
How do you do, Charles
He comes from the east
Hello
Hello, Pop
Hello, Charlie
Mr
Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles
You'll be leaving on Number Ten
That's the train with all the lights
You goin', Mom
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles - Where'm  going
You're going to see Chicago and New York - and Washington, maybe
Isn't he, Mr
Thatcher
(heartily) He certainly is
wish  were a little boy and going to make a trip like that for the first time
Why aren't you comin' with us, Mom
We have to stay here, Charles
You're going to live with Mr
Thatcher from now on, Charlie
You're going to be rich
Your Ma figures - that is, re - she and have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in
You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to - You won't be lonely, Charles
We're going to have a lot of good times together, Charles
Really we are
Kane stares at him
Come on, Charles
Let's shake hands
(extends his hand
Charles continues to look at him) Now, now
'm not as frightening as all that
Let's shake, what do you say
He reaches out for Charles's hand
Without a word, Charles hits him in the stomach with the sled
Thatcher stumbles back a few feet, gasping
(with a sickly grin) You almost hurt me, Charles
(moves towards him) Sleds aren't to hit people with
Sleds are to - to sleigh on
When we get to New York, Charles, we'll get you a sled that will - He's near enough to try to put a hand on Kane's shoulder
As he does, Kane kicks him in the ankle
Charles
He throws himself on her, his arms around her
Slowly Mrs
Kane puts her arms around him
(frightened) Mom
Mom
It's all right, Charles, it's all right
Thatcher is looking on indignantly, occasionally bending over to rub his ankle
Sorry, Mr
Thatcher
What the kid needs is a good thrashing
That's what you think, is it, Jim
Yes
Mrs
Kane looks slowly at Mr
Kane
(slowly) That's why he's going to be brought up where you can't get at him
: 1870 -  (  ) Old-fashioned railroad wheels underneath a sleeper, spinning along the track
: - -   -  - Thatcher, with a look of mingled exasperation, annoyance, sympathy and inability to handle the situation, is standing alongside a berth, looking at Kane
Kane, his face in the pillow, is crying with heartbreaking sobs
Mom
Mom
: The white page of the Thatcher manuscript
We pick up the words: " ,  ,   , , , " The words are followed by printed headline on "Enquirer" copy (as in following scene)
-  - Close-up on printed headline which reads: "    " Camera pulls back to reveal Thatcher holding the "Enquirer" copy, on which we read the headline
He is standing near the editorial round table around which a section of the staff, including Reilly, Leland and Kane are eating lunch
(coldly) Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper
don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr
Thatcher
just try everything can think of
(reading headline of paper he is still holding) "Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast
" You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast
Can you prove it isn't
Bernstein has come into the picture
He has a cable in his hand
He stops when he sees Thatcher
Mr
Bernstein, Mr
Thatcher - How are you, Mr
Thatcher
How do you do
- We just had a wire from Cuba, Mr
Kane - (stops, embarrassed) That's all right
We have no secrets from our readers
Mr
Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr
Bernstein
He knows what's wrong with every issue since 've taken charge
What's the cable
(reading) The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler
You see
There hasn't been a true word - think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr
Bernstein
Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not
Let me see - (snaps his fingers) Mike
(a fairly tough customer prepares to take dictation, his mouth still full of food) Go ahead, Mr
Kane
Dear Wheeler - (pauses a moment) You provide the prose poems - 'll provide the war
Laughter from the boys and girls at the table
That's fine, Mr
Kane
rather like it myself
Send it right away
Right away
Right away
Mike and Bernstein leave
Kane looks up, grinning at Thatcher, who is bursting with indignation but controls himself
After a moment of indecision, he decides to make one last try
came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company
Won't you step into my office, Mr
Thatcher
They cross the City Room together
think  should remind you, Charles, of a fact you seem to have forgotten
You are yourself one of the largest individual stockholders
'  -  - Kane holds the door open for Thatcher
They come in together
Mr
Thatcher, isn't everything 've been saying in the Enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true
(angrily) They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket
They're - The trouble is, Mr
Thatcher, you don't realize you're talking to two people
Kane moves around behind his desk
Thatcher doesn't understand, looks at him
As Charles Foster Kane, who has eighty-two thousand, six hundred and thirty-one shares of Metropolitan Transfer - you see, do have a rough idea of my holdings - sympathize with you
Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him
You may, if you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars
(angrily) Charles, my time is too valuable for me - On the other hand - (his manner becomes serious) am the publisher of the Enquirer
As such, it is my duty - 'll let you in on a little secret, it is also my pleasure - to see to it that decent, hard-working people of this city are not robbed blind by a group of money - mad pirates because, God help them, they have no one to look after their interests
'll let you in on another little secret, Mr
Thatcher
think 'm the man to do it
You see,  have money and property - Thatcher doesn't understand him
If  don't defend the interests of the underprivileged, somebody else will - maybe somebody without any money or any property and that would be too bad
Thatcher glares at him, unable to answer
Kane starts to dance
Do you know how to tap, Mr
Thatcher
You ought to learn - (humming quietly, he continues to dance) Thatcher puts on his hat
happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday, Charles
Could  not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise - (sneeringly) this Enquirer - that is costing you one million dollars a year
You're right
We did lose a million dollars last year
Thatcher thinks maybe the point has registered
We expect to lost a million next year, too
You know, Mr
Thatcher - (starts tapping quietly) at the rate of a million a year - we'll have to close this place in sixty years
: -    - Thompson - at the desk
With a gesture of annoyance, he is closing the manuscript
Camera arcs quickly around from over his shoulder to hold on door behind him, missing his face as he rises and turns to confront Miss Anderson, who has come into the room to shoo him out
Very prominent on this wall is an over-sized oil painting of Thatcher in the best Union League Club renaissance style
You have enjoyed a very rare privilege, young man
Did you find what you were looking for
No
Tell me something, Miss Anderson
You're not Rosebud, are you
What
didn't think you were
Well, thanks for the use of the hall
He puts his hat on his head and starts out, lighting a cigarette as he goes
Miss Anderson, scandalized, watches him
: : '  -   -  - Closeup of a still of Kane, aged about sixty-five
Camera pulls back, showing it is a framed photograph on the wall
Over the picture are crossed American flags
Under it sits Bernstein, back of his desk
Bernstein, always an undersized Jew, now seems even smaller than in his youth
He is bald as an egg, spry, with remarkably intense eyes
As camera continues to travel back, the back of Thompson's head and his shoulders come into the picture
(wryly) Who's a busy man
Me
'm Chairman of the Board
got nothing but time
What do you want to know
(still explaining) Well, Mr
Bernstein, you were with Mr
Kane from the very beginning - From before the beginning, young fellow
And now it's after the end
(turns to Thompson) Anything you want to know about him - about the paper - -  We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying - That Rosebud
Maybe some girl
There were a lot of them back in the early days, and - Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed - You're pretty young, Mr
- (remembers the name) Mr
Thompson
fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember
You take me
One day, back in 1896,  was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in - (slowly) - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off
white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and  only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but 'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that haven't thought of that girl
(triumphantly) See what  mean
(smiles) Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr
Thompson
'm calling on people who knew Mr
Kane
'm calling on you
Who else you been to see
Well,  went down to Atlantic City - Susie
called her myself the day after he died
thought maybe somebody ought to
(sadly) She couldn't even come to the 'phone
You know why
She was so - Sure, sure
'm going back there
Who else did you see
Nobody else, but 've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's
That journal of his - Thatcher
That man was the biggest darn fool  ever met - He made an awful lot of money
It's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money
(his eyes get reflective) Thatcher
Bernstein looks out of the window and keeps on looking, seeming to see something as he talks
He never knew there was anything in the world but money
That kind of fellow you can fool every day in the week - and twice on Sundays
(reflectively) The time he came to Rome for Mr
Kane's twenty-fifth birthday
You know, when Mr
Kane got control of his own money
Such a fool like Thatcher - tell you, nobody's business
: : '  -  - Bernstein speaking to Thompson
He knew what he wanted, Mr
Kane did, and he got it
Thatcher never did figure him out
He was hard to figure sometimes, even for me
Mr
Kane was a genius like he said
He had that funny sense of humor
Sometimes even  didn't get the joke
Like that night the opera house of his opened in Chicago
You know, the opera house he built for Susie, she should be an opera singer
(indicates with a little wave of his hand what he thinks of that; sighing) That was years later, of course - 1914 it was
Mrs
Kane took the leading part in the opera, and she was terrible
But nobody had the nerve to say so - not even the critics
Mr
Kane was a big man in those days
But this one fellow, this friend of his, Branford Leland - He leaves the sentence up in the air, as we : -   -  - It is late
The room is almost empty
Nobody is at work at the desks
Bernstein, fifty, is waiting anxiously with a little group of Kane's hirelings, most of them in evening dress with overcoats and hats
Eveybody is tense and expectant
(turns to a young hireling; quietly) What about Branford Leland
Has he got in his copy
Not yet
Go in and ask him to hurry
Well, why don't you, Mr
Bernstein
You know Mr
Leland
(looks at him for a moment; then slowly) might make him nervous
(after a pause) You and Leland and Mr
Kane - you were great friends back in the old days,  understand
(with a smile) That's right
They called us the "Three Musketeers
" Somebody behind Bernstein has trouble concealing his laughter
The City Editor speaks quickly to cover the situation
He's a great guy - Leland
(another little pause) Why'd he ever leave New York
(he isn't saying) That's a long story
(a tactless one) Wasn't there some sort of quarrel between - (quickly) had nothing to do with it
(then, somberly) It was Leland and Mr
Kane, and you couldn't call it a quarrel exactly
Better we should forget such things - (turning to City Editor) Leland is writing it up from the dramatic angle
Yes
thought it was a good idea
We've covered it from the news end, of course
And the social
How about the music notice
You got that in
Oh, yes, it's already made up
Our Mr
Mervin wrote a small review
Enthusiastic
Yes, very
(quietly) Naturally
Well, well - isn't that nice
' Mr
Bernstein - Bernstein turns
Medium long shot of Kane, now forty-nine, already quite stout
He is in white tie, wearing his overcoat and carrying a folded opera hat
Hello, Mr
Kane
The Hirelings rush, with Bernstein, to Kane's side
Widespread, half-suppressed sensation
Mr
Kane, this is a surprise
We've got a nice plant here
Everybody falls silent
There isn't anything to say
Was the show covered by every department
Exactly according to your instructions, Mr
Kane
We've got two spreads of pictures
(very, very casually) And the notice
Yes - Mr
Kane
(quietly) Is it good
Yes, Mr
kane
Kane looks at him for a minute
But there's another one still to come - the dramatic notice
(sharply) It isn't finished
No, Mr
Kane
That's Leland, isn't it
Yes, Mr
Kane
Has he said when he'll finish
We haven't heard from him
He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr
Bernstein
He sure did, Mr
Kane
Where is he
Right in there, Mr
Kane
The Hireling indicates the closed glass door of a little office at the other end of the City Room
Kane takes it in
(helpless, but very concerned) - That's all right, Mr
Bernstein
Kane crosses the length of the long City Room to the glass door indicated before by the Hireling
The City Editor looks at Bernstein
Kane opens the door and goes into the office, closing the door behind him
Leland and Mr
Kane - they haven't spoke together for ten years
(long pause; finally) Excuse me
(starts toward the door) '  -   -  - Bernstein comes in
An empty bottle is standing on Leland's desk
He has fallen over his typewriter, his face on the keys
sheet of paper is in the machine
paragraph has been typed
Kane is standing at the other side of the desk looking down on him
This is the first time we see murder in Kane's face
Bernstein looks at Kane, then crosses to Leland
He shakes him
Hey, Brad
Brad
(he straightens, looks at Kane; pause) He ain't been drinking before, Mr
Kane
Never
We would have heard
(finally; after a pause) What does it say there
Bernstein stares at him
What's he written
Bernstein looks over nearsightedly, painfully reading the paragraph written on the page
(reading) "Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur - (he waits for a minute to catch his breath; he doesn't like it) - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -" (looks up miserably) can't pronounce that name, Mr
Kane
Thais
Bernstein looks at Kane for a moment, then looks back, tortured
(reading again) "Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to
" (he continues to stare at the page) (after a short silence) Go on
(without looking up) That's all there is
Kane snatches the paper from the roller and reads it for himself
Slowly, a queer look comes over his face
Then he speaks, very quietly
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low
(then sharply) Have you got that, Mr
Bernstein
In the opinion of this reviewer - (miserably) didn't see that
It isn't here, Mr
Bernstein
'm dictating it
(looks at him) can't take shorthand
Get me a typewriter
'll finish the notice
Bernstein retreats from the room
: : '  -   -  - Long shot of Kane in his shirt sleeves, illuminated by a desk light, typing furiously
As the camera starts to pull even farther away from this, and as Bernstein - as narrator - begins to speak - : '  -  - Bernstein speaking to Thompson
He finished it
He wrote the worst notice  ever read about the girl he loved
We ran it in every paper
(after a pause) guess Mr
Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway
(looks at him very soberly) He thought she was great, Mr
Thompson
He really believed that
He put all his ambition on that girl
After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to
Oh,  don't blame Susie - Well, then, how could he write that roast
The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her
Oh, yes
He saw to that
tell you, Mr
Thompson, he was a hard man to figure out
He had that funny sense of humor
And then, too, maybe he thought by finishing that piece he could show Leland he was an honest man
You see, Leland didn't think so
guess he showed him all right
He's a nice fellow, but he's a dreamer
They were always together in those early days when we just started the Enquirer
On these last words, we : -   -  - The front half of the second floor constitutes one large City Room
Despite the brilliant sunshine outside, very little of it is actually getting into the room because the windows are small and narrow
There are about a dozen tables and desks, of the old-fashioned type, not flat, available for reporters
Two tables, on a raised platform at the end of the room, obviously serve the city room executives
To the left of the platform is an open door which leads into the Sanctrum
As Kane and Leland enter the room, an elderly, stout gent on the raised platform, strikes a bell and the other eight occupants of the room - all men - rise and face the new arrivals
Carter, the elderly gent, in formal clothes, rises and starts toward them
Welcome, Mr
Kane, to the "Enquirer
"   am Herbert Carter
Thank you, Mr Carter
This is Mr
Leland
(bowing) How do you do, Mr
Leland
(pointing to the standing reporters) Are they standing for me
thought it would be a nice gesture the new publisher - (grinning) Ask them to sit down
You may resume your work, gentlemen
(to Kane) didn't know your plans and so was unable to make any preparations
don't my plans myself
They are following Carter to his raised platform
As a matter of fact,  haven't got any
Except to get out a newspaper
There is a terrific crash at the doorway
They all turn to see Bernstein sprawled at the entrance
roll of bedding, a suitcase, and two framed pictures were too much for him
Oh, Mr
Bernstein
Bernstein looks up
If you would come here a moment, please, Mr
Bernstein
Bernstein rises and comes over, tidying himself as he comes
Mr
Carter, this is Mr
Bernstein
Mr
Bernstein is my general manager
(frigidly) How do you do, Mr
Bernstein
You've got a private office here, haven't you
The delivery wagon driver has now appeared in the entrance with parts of the bedstead and other furniture
He is looking about, a bit bewildered
(indicating open door to left of platform) My little sanctum is at your disposal
But  don't think understand - 'm going to live right here
(reflectively) As long as  have to
But a morning newspaper, Mr
Kane
After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices - That's one of the things  think must be changed, Mr
Carter
The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day
: '  -   - Kane, in his shirt sleeves, at a roll-top desk in the Sanctum, is working feverishly on copy and eating a very sizeable meal at the same time
Carter, still formally coated, is seated alongside him
Leland, seated in a corner, is looking on, detached, amused
The furniture has been pushed around and Kane's effects are somewhat in place
On a corner of the desk, Bernstein is writing down figures
No one pays any attention to him
'm not criticizing, Mr
Carter, but here's what  mean
There's a front page story in the "Chronicle," (points to it) and a picture - of a woman in Brooklyn who is missing
Probably murdered
(looks to make sure of the name) Mrs
Harry Silverstone
Why didn't the "Enquirer" have that this morning
(stiffly) Because we're running a newspaper, Mr
Kane, not a scandal sheet
Kane has finished eating
He pushes away his plates
'm still hungry, Brad
Let's go to Rector's and get something decent
(pointing to the "Chronicle" before him) The "Chronicle" has a two-column headline, Mr
Carter
Why haven't we
There is no news big enough
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough
The murder of Mrs
Harry Silverstone - (hotly) As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon
(triumphantly) Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter
And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead
(smiling a bit) The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr
Carter
It says the neighbors are getting suspicious
(stiffly) It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives
If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr
Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily - (gently) That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr
Carter
Right now,  wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr
Silverstone
Have him tell Mr
Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested
(he gets an idea) Have him tell Mr
Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office
If Mr
Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr
Silverstone an anarchist
Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear
Really, Mr
Kane,  can't see the function of a respectable newspaper - Kane isn't listening to him
Oh, Mr
Bernstein
Bernstein looks up from his figures
've just made a shocking discovery
The "Enquirer" is without a telephone
Have two installed at once
ordered six already this morning
Got a discount
Kane looks at Leland with a fond nod of his head at Bernstein
Leland grins back
Mr
Carter, meantime, has risen stiffly
But, Mr
Kane - That'll be all today, Mr
Carter
You've been most understanding
Good day, Mr
Carter
Carter, with a look that runs just short of apoplexy, leaves the room, closing the door behind him
Poor Mr
Carter
(shakes his head) What makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid, something inflexible, that people are supposed to pay two cents for - (without looking up) Three cents
(calmly) Two cents
Bernstein lifts his head and looks at Kane
Kane gazes back at him
(tapping on the paper) This is all figured at three cents a copy
Re-figure it, Mr
Bernstein, at two cents
(sighs and puts papers in his pocket) All right, but 'll keep these figures, too, just in case
Ready for dinner, Brad
Mr
Leland, if Mr
Kane, he should decide to drop the price to one cent, or maybe even he should make up his mind to give the paper away with a half-pound of tea - you'll just hold him until  get back, won't you
'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr
Bernstein
You people work too fast for me
Talk about new brooms
Who said anything about brooms
It's a saying, Mr
Bernstein new broom sweeps clean
Oh
: -    - - The ground floor witht he windows on the street - of the "Enquirer
"  It is almost midnight by an old-fashioned clock on the wall
Grouped around a large table, on which are several locked forms of type, very old-fashioned of course, but true to the period - are Kane and Leland in elegant evening clothes, Bernstein, unchanged from the afternoon, and Smathers, the composing room foreman, nervous and harassed
But it's impossible, Mr
Kane
We can't remake these pages
These pages aren't made up as want them, Mr
Smathers
We go to press in five minutes
(about to crack up) The "Enquirer" has an old and honored tradition, Mr
Kane
The "Enquirer" is not in competition with those other rags
We should be publishing such rags, that's all  wish
Why, the "Enquirer" -  wouldn't wrap up the liver for the cat in the "Enquirer" - (enraged) Mr
Kane,  must ask you to see to it that this - this person learns to control his tongue
Kane looks up
've been a newspaperman my whole life and  don't intend - (he starts to sputter) - if it's your intention that should continue to be harassed by this - this - (he's really sore) warn you, Mr
Kane, it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted
It is accepted, Mr
Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard
But Mr
Kane,  meant - Kane turns his back on him, speaks again to the composing room foreman
(quietly) Let's remake these pages, Mr
Smathers
We'll have to publish a half hour late, that's all
(as though Kane were talking Greek) We can't remake them, Mr
Kane
We go to press in five minutes
Kane sighs, unperturbed, as he reaches out his hand and shoves the forms off the table onto the floor, where they scatter into hundreds of bits
You can remake them now, can't you, Mr
Smathers
Smather's mouth opens wider and wider
Bradford and Bernstein are grinning
After the types 've been reset and the pages have been remade according to the way  told you before, Mr
Smathers, kindly have proofs pulled and bring them to me
Then, if can't find any way to improve them again - (almost as if reluctantly) -  suppose we'll have to go to press
He starts out of the room, followed by Leland
(to Smathers) In case you don't understand, Mr
Smathers - he's a new broom
: : -    - The picture is mainly occupied by a large building, on the roof of which the lights spell out the word "Enquirer" against the sunrise
We do not see the street or the first few stories of this building, the windows of which would be certainly illuminated
What we do see is the floor on which is located the City Room
Over this scene, newboys are heard selling the Chronicle, their voices growing in volume
As the dissolve complete itself, camera moves toward the one lighted window - the window of the Sanctrum
: '  -    - The newsboys are still heard from the street below - fainter but very insistent
Kane's office is gas-lit, of course, as is the rest of the Enquirer building
Kane, in his shirt sleeves, stands at the open window looking out
The bed is already made up
On it is seated Bernstein, smoking the end of a cigar
Leland is in a chair
' ' - -
Kane, taking a deep breath of the morning air, closes the window and turns to the others
The voices of the newsboys, naturally, are very much fainter after this
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes
(looking at his watch) It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it - Leland rises from the chair, stretching painfully
Tired
It's been a tough day
wasted day
(looking up) Wasted
(incredulously) Charlie
You just made the paper over four times today, Mr
Kane
That's all - 've changed the front page a little, Mr
Bernstein
That's not enough - There's something 've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print -  've got to make the "New York Enquirer" as important to New York as the gas in that light
(quietly) What're you going to do, Charlie
Kane looks at him for a minute with a queer smile of happy concentration
My Declaration of Principles - (he says it with quotes around it) Don't smile, Brad - (getting the idea) Take dictation, Mr
Bernstein - Can't take shorthand, Mr
Kane - 'll write it myself
Kane grabs a piece of rough paper and a grease crayon
Sitting down on the bed next to Bernstein, he starts to write
(looking over his shoulder) You don't wanta make any promises, Mr
Kane, you don't wanta keep
(as he writes) These'll be kept
(stops for a minute and reads what he has written; reading) 'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly
(starts to write again; reading as he writes) will also provide them - That's the second sentence you've started with "" - (looking up) People are going to know who's responsible
And they're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly
(he speaks with real conviction) And no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news
He looks at Leland for a minute and goes back to his writing, reading as he writes
Bernstein has risen and crossed to one side of Kane
They both stand looking out
Leland joins him on the other side
Their three heads are silhouetted against the sky
Leland's head is seen to turn slightly as he looks into Kane's face - camera very close on this - Kane turns to him and we know their eyes have met, although their faces are almost in sillhouette
Bernstein is still smoking a cigar
: Front page of the "Enquirer" shows big boxed editorial with heading: - Camera continues pulling back and shows newspaper to be on the top of a pile of newspapers
As we draw further back, we see four piles, and as camera contines to pull back, we see six piles and go on back until we see a big field of "Enquirers" - piles of "Enquirers" - all 26,000 copies ready for distribution
wagon with a huge sign on its side reading " -  26,000" passes through foreground, and we wipe to: pile of "Enquirers" for sale on a broken down wooden box on a street corner, obviously a poor district
couple of coins fall on the pile
The stoop of a period door with old-fashioned enamel milk can and a bag of rolls
Across the sidewalk before this, moves the shadow of an old-fashioned bicycle with an enormous front wheel
copy of the "Enquirer" is tossed on the stoop
breakfast table - beautiful linen and beautiful silver - everything very expensive, gleaming in the sunshine
Into a silver newspaper rack there is slipped a copy of the "Enquirer"
Here, as before, the boxed editorial reading   - , is very prominent on the front page
The wooden floor of a railroad station, flashing light and dark as a train behind the camera rushes by
On the floor, there is tossed a bound bundle of the "New York Enquirer" - the Declaration of Principles still prominent
Rural Delivery - a copy of the "Enquirer"s being put into bins, showing state distribution
The railroad platform again
We stay here for four images
On each image, the speed of the train is faster and the piles of the "Enquirer" are larger
On the first image, we move in to hold on the words " - 31,000
"  We are this close for the next pile which reads 40,000; the next one which reads 55,000, and the last which is 62,000
In each instance, the bundles of newspapers are thicker and the speed of the moving train behind the camera is increased
The entire montage above indicated is accompanied by a descriptive complement of sound - the traffic noises of New York in the 1890's; wheels on cobblestones and horses' hooves; bicycle bells; the mooning of cattle and the crowing of roosters (in the  shot), and in all cases where the railroad platform is used - the mounting sound of the railroad train
The last figure "62,000" opposite the word "" on the "Enquirer" masthead changes to: -  - Angle up to wall of building - a painter on a cradle is putting the last zero to the figure "62,000" on an enormous sign advertising the "Enquirer
"  It reads: '    62,000 Camera travels down side of building - takes in another building on which there is a sign which reads: '    62,000 Camera continues to travel down to sidewalk in front of the Chronicle office
The Chronicle office has a plateglass window in which is reflected traffic moving up and down the street, also the figures of Kane, Leland and Bernstein, who are munching peanuts
Inside the window, almost filling it, is a large photograph of the "Chronicle" staff, with Reilly prominently seated in the center
sign over the photo reads: sign beneath it reads: The sign also includes the "Chronicle" circulation figure
There are nine men in the photo
(looking up at the sign - happily) Sixty-two thousand - That looks pretty nice
(indicating the Chronicle Building) Let's hope they like it there
From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough
(pointing to the sign over the photograph in the window) Look at that
The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper
It's a good idea for a newspaper
(reading the figures) Four hundred sixy thousand
Say, with them fellows - (referring to the photo) - it's no trick to get circulation
You're right, Mr
Bernstein
(sighs) You know how long it took the "Chronicle" to get that staff together
Twenty years
know
Kane, smiling, lights a cigarette, at the same time looking into the window
Camera moves in to hold on the photograph of nine men, still holding the reflection of Kane's smiling face
: -   -  - Nine men, arrayed as in the photograph, but with Kane beaming in the center of the first row
The men, variously with mustaches, beards, bald heads, etc
are easily identified as being the same men, Reilly prominent amongst them
As camera pulls back, it is revealed that they are being photographed - by an old-type professional photographer, big box, black hood and all - in a corner of the room
It is 1:30 at night
Desks, etc
have been pushed against the wall
Running down the center of the room is a long banquet table, at which twenty diners have finished their meals
The eleven remaining at their seats - these include Bernstein and Leland - are amusedly watching the photographic ceremonies
That's all
Thank you
The photographic subjects rise
(a sudden thought) Make up an extra copy and mail it to the "Chronicle
" Chuckling and beaming, he makes his way to his place at the head of the table
The others have already sat down
Kane gets his guests' attention by rapping on the table with a knife
Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"
This has,  think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists - (indicates the eight men) Mr
Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks
It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark
Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven
General applause
All of you - new and old -  You're all getting the best salaries in town
Not one of you has been hired because of his loyalty
It's your talent 'm interested in
That talent that's going to make the "Enquirer" the kind of paper  want - the best newspaper in the world
Applause
However,  think you'll agree we've heard enough about newspapers and the newspaper business for one night
There are other subjects in the world
He puts his two fingers in his mouth and lets out a shrill whistle
This is a signal
band strikes up a lively ditty of the period and enters in advance a regiment of very magnificent maidens, as daringly arrayed as possible in the chorus costumes of the day
The rest of this episode will be planned and staged later
Its essence is that Kane is just a healthy and happy young man having a wonderful time
As some of the girls are detached from the line and made into partners for individual dancing - : : "" :     ' 274,321 Dissolve just completes itself - the image of Kane dancing with a girl on each arm just disappears as camera pans down off the Temple Bldg
in the same action as the previous street scene
There is a new sign on the side of the building below
It reads: Camera continues panning as we : montage of various scenes, between the years 1891-1900
The scenes indicate the growth of the "Enquirer" under the impulse of Kane's personal drive
Kane is shown, thus, at various activities: Move down from the sign: to street in front of saloon with parade passing (boys going off to the Spanish-American War)-   torchlight parade with the torches reflected in the glass window of the saloon - the sound of brass band playing "It's a Hot Time
" In the window of the saloon is a large sign or poster " " :  Remington drawing of American boys, similar to the parade above, in which "Our Boys" in the expeditionary hats are seen marching off to war
Back of observation car
Shot of Kane congratulating Teddy Roosevelt (the same shot as in the News Digest - without flickering)
The wooden floor of the railroad platform again - a bundle of "Enquirers" - this time an enormous bundle - is thrown down, and the moving shadows of the train behind the camera indicate that it is going like a bat out of hell
reproduction of Kane and Teddy shaking hands as above is very prominent in the frame and almost hogs the entire front page
The headline indicates the surrender of Cuba
Cartoon, highly dramatic and very involved as to content - lousy with captions, labels, and symbolic figures, the most gruesome and recognizable - "Capitalistic Greed
"  This cartoon is almost finished and is on a drawing board before which stand Kane and the artist himself
Kane is grinning over some suggestion he has made
: The cartoon finished and reproduced on the editorial page of the "Enquirer" - in quite close, with an editorial and several faces of caps shown underneath
The entire newspaper is crushed with an angry gesture and thrown down into an expensive-looking wastebasket (which is primarily for ticker tape) tape is pouring
Cartoonist and Kane working on comic strip of "Johnny the Monk
" : Floor of room -  Two kids on floor, with newspaper spread out, looking at the same comic strip
Kane's photographic gallery with photographers, stooges, and Kane himself in attendance on a very hot-looking item of the period
sob sister is interviewing this hot number and Kane is arranging her dress to look more seductive
: : The hot number reproduced and prominently displayed and covering almost half a page of the "Enquirer
"  It is being read in a barber shop and is seen in an over-shoulder shot of the man who is reading it
He is getting a shine, a manicure, and a haircut
The sob-sister caption over the photograph reveals: " '     , "  An oval photograph of the gun is included in the lay- out of the pretty lady with a headline which says: "
" - Shot of Kane, in evening clothes, in obvious position of danger, grabbing camera from photographer
Before him rages a terrific tenement fire
: :  Headline about inadequacy of present fire equipment
: Final shot of a new horse-drawn steam engine roaring around a street corner (Stock)
: black pattern of iron bars
We are in a prison cell
The door is opened and a condemned man, with priest, warden and the usual attendants, moves into foreground and starts up the hall past a group which includes phtographers, Kane's sob- sister, and Kane
The photographers take pictures with a mighty flash of old-fashioned flash powder
The condemned man in the foreground (in silhouette) is startled by this
: copy of the "Enquirer" spread out on a table
big lay-out of the execution story includes the killer as photographed by Kane's photographers, and nearby on the other page there is a large picture of the new steam fire engine (made from the stock shot) with a headline indicating that the "Enquirer" has won its campaign for better equipment
cup of coffee and a doughnut are on the newspaper, and a servant girl - over whose shoulder we see the paper - is stirring the coffee
The Beaux Art Ball
number of elderly swells are jammed into a hallway
Servants suddenly divest them of their furs, overcoats and wraps, revealing them to be in fancy dress costume, pink fleshings, etc
, the effect to be very surprising, very lavish and very very ridiculous
We see, among others, Mr
Thatcher himself (as Ben Hur) ribbon around, his bald head and all
At the conclusion of this tableau, the image freezes and we pull back to show it reproduced on the society page of the "New York Enquirer
" Over the "Enquirer"'s pictorial version of the Beaux Art Ball is thrown a huge fish - then coffee grounds - altogether a pretty repulsive sight
The whole thing is bundled up and thrown into a garbage can
Extreme close-up of the words: " -
" Camera pulls back to show passport open to the photograph page which shows Kane, registering birth, race, and nationality
Passport cover is closed, showing it to be an American passport
-      -  - As camera pulls back over shoulder of official, taking in Kane, Leland, and Bernstein, we see the bustle and noise of departing ocean liner
Behind the principles can be seen an enormous plain sign which reads: "
"  From offstage can be heard the steward's cry, indispensable in any Mercury production, the old familiar cry, "All Ashore That's Going Ashore
" - gongs, also blasts of the great whistle and all the rest of it
There you are, Mr
Kane
Everything in order
Thank you
Kane and Leland and Bernstein start up the gangplank
(calling) Have a good rest, Mr
Kane
Thanks
But please, Mr
Kane, don't buy any more paintings
Nine Venuses already we got, twenty-six Virgins - two whole warehouses full of stuff - promise not to bring any more Venuses and not to worry - and not to try to get in touch with any of the papers - ' All ashore
- and to forget about the new feature sections - and not to try to think up and ideas for comic sections
' All ashore that's going ashore
Kane leaves Leland and Bernstein midway up gangplank, as he rushes up to it, calling back with a wave: Goodbye, gents
(at the top of the gangplank, he turns and calls down) Hey
(calling down to them) You don't expect me to keep any of those promises, do you
band on deck strikes up "Auld Lang Syne
"  Bernstein and Leland turn to each other
Do you, Mr
Leland
(smiling) Certainly not
They start down the gangplank together
: - The pattern of telegraph wires, dripping with rain, through which we see the same old building but now rendered fairly remarkable by tremendous outline sign in gold which reads " "   couple of lights show in the building
We start toward the window where the lights show, as we - : '  - The light in the window in the former shot was showing behind the letter "" of the Enquirer sign
Now the letter "" is even larger than the frame of the camera
Rain drips disconsolately off the middle part of the figure
We see through this and through the drizzle of the window to Bernstein's desk where he sits working under a blue shaded light
: : Same setup as before except that it is now late afternoon and late in the winter of the year
The outline "" is hung with icicles which are melting, dripping despairingly between us and Mr
Bernstein, still seated at his desk - still working
: Same setup as before except that it is spring
Instead of the sad sounds of dripping rain or dripping icicles, we hear the melancholy cry of a hurdy-gurdy in the street below
It is spring and through the letter "" we can see Bernstein working at his desk
Pigeons are gathering on the "" and on the sill
Bernstein looks up and sees them
He takes some crumbs from his little homemade lunch which is spread out on the desk before him, carries them to the windows and feeds the pigeons, looking moodily out on the prospect of spring on Park Row
The birds eat the crumbs - the hurdy-gurdy continues to play
: The same setup again, it is now summer
The window was half- open before
now it's open all the way and Bernstein has gone so far as to take off his coat
His shirt and his celluloid collar are wringing wet
Camera moves toward the window to tighten on Bernstein and to take in the City Room behind him, which is absolutely deserted
It is clear that there is almost nothing more for Bernstein to do
The hurdy- gurdy in the street is playing as before, but a new tune
: beach on Coney Island
Bernstein in a rented period bathing suit sits alone in the sand, reading a copy of the "Enquirer
" : : -   -  - The whole floor is now a City Room
It is twice its former size, yet not too large for all the desks and the people using them
The windows have been enlarged, providing a good deal more light and air
wall calendar says September 9th
Kane and Bernstein enter and stand in the entrance a moment
Kane, who really did look a bit peaked before, is now clear- eyed and tanned
He is wearing new English clothes
As they come into the room, Bernstein practically walking sideways, is doing nothing but beaming and admiring Kane, quelling like a mother at the Carnegie Hall debut of her son
Seeing and recognizing Kane, the entire staff rises to its feet
(referring to the staff; with a smile) Ask them to sit down, Mr
Bernstein
Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake
The order is immediately obeyed, everybody going into business of feverish activity
So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh
Especially the new papers - We certainly do
Vacation's over - starting right after dinner
But right now - that lady over there - (he indicates a woman at the desk) - that's the new society editor, take it
You think  could interrupt her a moment, Mr
Bernstein
Huh
Oh,  forgot - you've been away so long  forgot about your joking - He trails after Kane as he approaches the Society Editor's desk
The Society Editor, a middle-aged spinster, sees him approaching and starts to quake all over, but tries to pretend she isn't aware of him
An envelope in her hand shakes violently
Kane and Bernstein stop at her desk
Miss Townsend - Miss Townsend looks up and is so surprised to see Bernstein with a stranger
Good afternoon, Mr
Bernstein
This is Mr
Kane, Miss Townsend
Miss Townsend can't stick to her plan
She starts to rise, but her legs are none too good under her
She knocks over a tray of copy paper as she rises, and bends to pick it up
(very hesitatingly and very softly) Miss Townsend - At the sound of his voice, she straightens up
She is very close to death from excitement
've been away for several months, and  don't know exactly how these things are handled now
But one thing  wanted to be sure of is that you won't treat this little announcement any differently than you would any other similar announcement
He hands her an envelope
She has difficulty in holding on to it
(gently) Read it, Miss Townsend
And remember - just the regular treatment
See you at nine o'clock, Mr
Bernstein
Kane leaves
Bernstein looks after him, then at the paper
Miss Townsend finally manages to open the envelope
piece of flimsy paper, with a few written lines, is her reward
(reading) Mr
and Mrs
Thomas Moore Norton announce the engagement of their daughter, Emily Monroe Norton, to Mr
Charles Foster Kane
(starts to read it) Mr
and Mrs
Thomas Moore Norton announce - (fluttering - on top of him) She's - she's the niece of - of the President of the United States - (nodding proudly) know
Come on, Miss Townsend - From the window, maybe we can get a look
He takes her by the hand and leads her off
Angle toward open window
Bernstein and Miss Townsend, backs to camera, rushing to the window
-  - High angle downward - what Bernstein and Miss Townsend see from the window
Kane is just stepping into an elegant barouch, drawn up at the curb, in which sits Miss Emily Norton
He kisses her full on the lips before he sits down
She acts a bit taken aback, because of the public nature of the scene, but she isn't really annoyed
As the barouche starts off, she is looking at him adoringly
He, however, has turned his head and is looking adoringly at the "Enquirer
"  He apparently sees Bernstein and Miss Townsed and waves his hand
-  -  - Bernstein and Miss Townsend at window
girl like that, believe me, she's lucky
Presiden't niece, huh
Say, before he's through, she'll be a Presiden't wife
Miss Townsend is now dewey-eyed
She looks at Bernstein, who has turned away, gazing down at the departing couple
: Front page of the "Enquirer
"  Large picture of the young couple - Kane and Emily - occupying four columns - very happy
: '  -  -  - Bernstein and Thompson
As the dissolve comes, Bernstein's voice is heard
The way things turned out,  don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud
It didn't end very well, did it
(shaking his head) It ended - (a slight pause) Then there was Susie - that ended, too
(shrugs, a pause; then looking up into Thompson's eyes) guess he didn't make her very happy - ( ) You know,  was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about - Yes - Maybe that was something he lost
Mr
Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had - (a pause) You ought to talk to Bradford Leland
He could tell you a lot
wish  could tell you where Leland is, but  don't know myself
He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead
In case you'd like to know, Mr
Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street
You don't say
Why  had no idea - Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me
Just - (controls himself) Just old age
(smiles sadly) It's the only disease, Mr
Thompson, you don't look forward to being cured of
(pauses) You ought to see Mr
Leland
There's a whole lot of things he could tell you - if he wanted to
: : -  - Close shot - Thompson
He is tilted back in a chair which seems to be, and is, leaning against a chimney
Leland's voice is heard for a few moments before Leland is seen
' When you get to my age, young man, you don't miss anything
Unless maybe it's a good drink of bourbon
Even that doesn't make much difference, if you remember there hasn't been any good bourbon in this country for twenty years
Camera has pulled back, during above speech, revealing that Leland, wrapped in a blanket, is in a wheel chair, talking to Thompson
They are on the flat roof of a hospital
Other people in wheel chairs can be seen in the background, along with a nurse or two
They are all sunning themselves
Mr
Leland, you were - You don't happen to have a cigar, do you
've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks 'm going to stop smoking
changed the subject, didn't
Dear, dear
What a disagreeable old man 've become
You want to know what  think of Charlie Kane
Well -  suppose he has some private sort of greatness
But he kept it to himself
(grinning) He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away
He just - left you a tip
He had a generous mind
don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions
That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane
He never had a conviction in his life
guess he died without one - That must have been pretty unpleasant
Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death
But we do know what we're leaving
we believe in something
(looks sharply at Thompson) You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar
Sorry, Mr
Leland
Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he
Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then
He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth
Maybe you could remember something that - can remember everything
That's my curse, young man
It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race
Memory - was his oldest friend
(slowly) As far as  was concerned, he behaved like swine
Maybe  wasnt' his friend
If  wasn't, he never had one
Maybe  was what nowadays you call a stooge - : : -   -  - The party (previously shown in the Bernstein sequence)
We start this sequence toward the end of the former one, but from a fresh angle, holding on Leland, who is at the end of the table
Kane is heard off, making a speech
' Not one of you has been hired because of his loyalty
It's your talent 'm interested in
That talent that's going to make the "Enquirer" the kind of paper want - the best newspaper in the world
Applause
During above, Bernstein has come to Leland's side
Isn't it wonderful
Such a party
Yes
His tone causes Bernstein to look at him
' However,  think you'll agree we've heard enough about newspapers and the newspaper business for one night
The above speeches are heard under the following dialogue
(to Leland) What's the matter
Mr
Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper
Sure
They're like anybody else
They got work to do
They do it
(proudly) Only they happen to be the best men in the business
(finishing his speech) There are other subjects in the world - Kane whistles
The band and the chorus girls enter and hell breaks loose all around Leland and Bernstein
(after a minute) Do we stand for the same things that the "Chronicle" stands for, Mr
Bernstein
(indignantly) Certainly not
So what's that got to do with it
Mr
Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week
Probably
There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr
Kane - without his knowing it
Kane has come up to Leland and Bernstein
He sits down next to them, lighting a cigarette
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war
Our readers are, anyway,  don't know about the rest of the country
(enthusiastically) It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad
We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social
The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes - (gets excited) tell you, Brad,  envy you
(quoting) By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front
'm almost tempted - But there is no Front, Charlie
There's a very doubtful civil war
Besides,  don't want the job
All right, Brad, all right - you don't have to be a war correspondent unless you want to - 'd want to
(looking up) Hello, Georgie
Georgie, a very handsome madam has walked into the picture, stands behind him
She leans over and speaks quietly in his ear
Is everything the way you want it, dear
(looking around) If everybody's having fun, that's the way  want it
've got some other little girls coming over - (interrupting) Charles,  tell you there is no war
There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a - (seriously) How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it
They do it only because you do
(grins) And  do it because they do it, and they do it - it's a vicious circle, isn't it
(rises) 'm going over to Georgie's, Brad - you know, Georgie, don't you
Leland nods
(over Kane's next lines) Glad to meet you, Brad
Leland shudders
told you about Brad, Georgie
He needs to relax
Brad doesn't answer
Some ships with wonderful wines have managed to slip through the enemy fleet that's blockading New York harbor - (grins) Georgie knows a young lady whom 'm sure you'd adore - wouldn't he, Georgie
Why only the other evening  said to myself, if Brad were only here to adore this young lady - this - (snaps his fingers) What's her name again
: : '  -  - Georgie is introducing a young lady to Branford Leland
On sound track we hear piano music
(right on cue from preceding scene) Ethel - this gentlemen has been very anxious to meet you -  This is Ethel
Hello, Mr
Leland
Camera pans to include Kane, seated at piano, with girls gathered around him
Charlie
Play the song about you
Is there a song about Charlie
Kane has broken into "Oh, Mr
Kane
" and Charlie and the girls start to sing
Ethel leads the unhappy Leland over to the group
Kane, seeing Leland and taking his eye, motions to the professor who has been standing next to him to take over
The professor does so
The singing continues
Kane rises and crosses to Leland
Say, Brad
(draws him slightly aside) 've got an idea
Yes
mean 've got a job for you
Good
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic
(sincerely, but not gushing; seriously) 'd like that
Kane starts quietly to dance in time to the music
Leland smiles at him
You start tomorrow night
Richard Carl in "The Spring Chicken
" (or supply show) 'll get us some girls
You get tickets
drama critic gets them free, you know
(grins) Rector's at seven
Charlie - Yes
(still smiling) It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough - (has stopped dancing) You're wrong
It does make a difference to you -  Rector's, Brad
(starts to dance again) Come to think of it,  don't blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent
You won't miss anything
It isn't much of a war
Besides, they tell me there isn't a decent restaurant on the whole island
: : ' -  - Leland, Kane, two young ladies at Rector's
Popular music is heard over the soundtrack
Everybody is laughing very, very hard at something Kane has said
The girls are hysterical
Kane can hardly breathe
As Leland's laughter becomes more and more hearty, it only increases the laughter of the others
: -      -  - As told by Bernstein
Kane is calling down to Leland and Bernstein (as before)
You don't expect me to keep any of those promises, do you
band on deck strikes up "Auld Lang Syne" and further ship-to- shore conversation is rendered unfeasible
Bernstein and Leland on deck
(turns to Leland) Do you, Mr
Leland
(smiling) Certainly not
Slight pause
They continue on their way
Mr
Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him
He wanted you to
He said to me just yesterday - wanted him to have fun - and with me along - This stops Bernstein
Bernstein looks at him
Mr
Bernstein,  wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully
Don't  always
Most of the time
Mr
Bernstein, am  a stuffed shirt
Am  a horse-faced hypocrite
Am a New England school-marm
Yes
Leland is surprised
If you thought 'd answer different from what Mr
Kane tells you - well,  wouldn't
(good naturedly) You're in a conspiracy against me, you two
You always have been
Against me there should be such a conspiracy some time
He pauses
"Auld Lang Syne" can still be heard from the deck of the department steamer
(with a hopeful look in his eyes) Well, he'll be coming back in September
The Majestic
got the reservations
It gets in on the ninth
September the ninth
Leland puts his hand in his pocket, pulls out a pencil and small engagement book, opens the book and starts to write
Leland's pencil writing on a page in the engagement book open to September 9: "Rector's - 8:30 p
m
" : Front page "Enquirer
"  Large picture of the young couple - Kane and Emily - occupying four columns - very happy
-  - Leland and Thompson
Leland is speaking as we dissolve
used to go to dancing school with her
Thompson had handed Leland a paper
What's this
It's a letter from her lawyers
(reading aloud from the letter) David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - (looks up) Rawlston is my boss
Oh, yes
know about Mr
Rawlston
He knows the first Mrs
Kane socially -  That's the answer we got
(reading) am in receipt of your favor of yesterday
beg you to do me the courtesy of accepting my assurance that Mrs
Whitehall cannot be induced to contribute any more information on the career of Charles Foster Kane
She has authorized me to state on previous occasions that she regards their brief marriage as a distateful episode in her life that she prefers to forget
With assurances of the highest esteem - Leland hands the paper back to Thompson
Brief marriage
Ten years
(sighs) Was he in love
He married for love - (a little laugh) That's why he did everything
That's why he went into politics
It seems we weren't enough
He wanted all the voters to love him, too
All he really wanted out of life was love
That's Charlie's story - it's the story of how he lost it
You see, he just didn't have any to give
He loved Charlie Kane, of course, very dearly - and his mother,  guess he always loved her
As for Emily - well, all can tell you is Emily's story as she told it to me, which probably isn't fair - there's supposed to be two sides to every story - and guess there are
guess there's more than two sides - : : Newspaper - Kane's marriage to Emily with still of group on White House lawn, same setup as early newsreel in News Digest
: Screaming headline:
: Headline reading: : Big headline on "Enquirer" front page which reads: Under this, one of those big box signed editorials, typical of Kane, illustrated, on subject of the power of the president, expressed in about nine different cases of type, and illustrated by a cartoon of the White House, on which camera tightens, as we - : : -  '   -  - This scene is shot so as never to show the President - or at least never his face
There is present the President's Secretary, sitting on one side of the desk, intently taking notes
Kane is on his feet, in front of the desk, tense and glaring
It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which  concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people
(pauses) You are not,  hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical
'm not suggesting anything, Mr
President
've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high- pressure crooks
(calmly) must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr
Kane
(screaming) It's the only vein  know
tell the facts the way  see them
And any man that knows that facts - know the facts, Mr
Kane
And happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean
(pause) You're a man of great talents, Mr
Kane
Thanks
understand that you have political ambitions
Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own - (building to a frenzy) 'm much obliged, Mr
President, for your concern about me
However, happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and  say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of - (interrupting) You've made your point perfectly clear, Mr
Kane
Good day
The Secretary rises
Kane, with every bit of will power remotely at his disposal to control what might become an hysterical outburst, manages to bow
Mr
President
He starts out of the office
: -  -  - Kane, Reilly, Leland and a composing room Foreman, in working clothes, bending over a table with several forms of type
They are looking, at this moment, at a made-up headline - but Kane's back is in the way
so we can't read it
How about it, Mr
Kane
Reilly glances at his wrist watch and makes a face
Kane smiles as he notices this
All right
Let her slide
He turns away, and we can now read the headline
Insert of the headline, which reads: " " : Here follows a quick montage (presently to be worked out) of no more than four or five images in which the President, by means of cartoons, editorials, headlines (all faithfully reproduced from period yellow journalism) is violently attacked
The montage ends on the word
The music cuts
hand reaches in a side pocket which contains a newspaper - recognizably the "Enquirer
"  The hand removes a gun
The gun is shot
Many arms seize the hand which is pulled up - gun still firing
As the arm is raised in the air, we see that the other arms holding the arm and struggling with it are uniformed, and we see the White House beyond
: News ticker which is spelling out the words: " 7:45
" :  Under the following - a down shot, below the "Enquirer," shows a crowd forming, looking angrily up toward the camera
Crowd noises on the soundtrack under music
hand snatches the ticker tape away and as the image of the crowd dissolves out, we pull back to show: '  -  - The ticker tape is in Reilly's hand
Reilly has a phone to his ear
Looks bad for us, Mr
Kane
How shall we handle it
: : '  - Kane in shirtsleeves at phone
It's a news story
Get it on the street
: Headline under "Enquirer" masthead which reads: " " Newsboy is crying the headline at the same time
We pull back to show him and - : - The camera is in tight on a box which contains Emily and distinguished elderly ladies and gentlemen, obviously family and friends
On the soundtrack, very limpid opera music
Another elderly gent, in white tie but still wearing an overcoat, comes into the box and whispers to Emily
He has a copy of the "Enquirer" in his hand
Emily rises
He shows the paper to her
: -  - An angry crowd seen from the window of Kane's office
They make a deep threatening sound which is audible during the following scene
Across the heads of the crowd are two great squares of light from the windows above them
One of these disappears as the blind is pulled
As the dissolve completes itself, the second square of light commences to reduce in size, and then the entire street is cut off by a blind which Leland pulls down, covering the entire frame
'  -  -  - The staff standing around, worried to death, in their shirtsleeves
(to Reilly) Take dictation -  Front page editorial -  "This afternoon a great man was assassinated
He was the President of the United States -" Charlie - Yes
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man
Why not
Why not
Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead
(quickly) Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition
(still looking at Leland) What do you mean by that
(quietly) Competition
He may recover - (still holding on Leland) What do you mean by that
(steadily) Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor
What do you think that crowd is doing down there
They think you murdered him
Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket
- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed
said treason was a capital offense punishable by death - You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months
They're true
Everything  said
Witholding that veto was treason
(interrupting) Charlie
(riding over him) Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because - Look out that window
Kane stops - looks at him
There are the people of the United States, and they are blaming you - Oh,  know it doesn't make any sense, but at least you can learn a lesson from it
(snarling) What lesson
Not to expose fraud when  see it
Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property
(he turns to Reilly) Run it the way  said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -" Charlie
Now you're not making sense
(sharply) don't have to
run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast
can't help that
Besides, they all know 'm married to his niece
've got to think of her
What
've got to think of Emily - (after a silence) 'd like to talk to you about that
Go ahead
Leland looks back at Kane, is conscious of the boys standing around
Finish your editorial
Leland walks out in to the City Room
More staff members in shirt sleeves in a state of panic
Leland goes to his desk, takes out a bottle, pours himself a very stiff drink
door opens
Policeman enters with Bernstein
Bernstein is badly battered
The boys crowd around
(worried) What's happened
(smiling) 'm all right, Mr
Leland
Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me
learned 'em
Didn't , officer
(grinning) You sure did -  Say, the Commissioner said  was to stand by and protect Mr
Kane until further orders, no matter how he felt about it
Where is he
(finishing his drink) In there
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, 'd have killed them fellows
(pouring himself another drink) Go and get yourself washed up, Mr
Bernstein
(he looks his face over thoroughly) There doesn't seem to be an serious injury
Not to me
But you will let that cop go home with Mr
Kane, won't you
Yes, Mr
Bernstein
Bernstein leaves the picture with sympathetic attendance
Leland finishes his second drink
: '  -  - The bottle is finished
The door in the Sanctrum opens
Reilly and the others leave
(as they go) Goodnight, Mr
Kane
Kane stands in the door, waiting for Leland
Leland gets up and moves toward the office - goes in, sits down across from Kane at the desk
An uncomfortable pause
Then Kane smiles ingratiatingly
Leland tries to cope with this
First of all - (he can't go on) (not cruelly - genuinely kind) What's wrong, Brad
'm drunk
'll get you some coffee
He rises and goes to the door
First of all,  will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer
" (gently - opening the door) That's just a little promotion scheme
Nobody expects you - (calling) Mike, will you try and get Mr
Leland some coffee
' Sure thing, Mr
Kane
Kane turns back to Leland
Leland doesn't look up at him
Charlie, it's just no go
We can't agree anymore
wish you'd let me go to Chicago
Why, Brad
want to be transferred to the new paper
You've been saying yourself you wish you had somebody to - (he is heartsick, inarticulate) That's not what  wanted to talk about
Kane goes around behind the desk and sits down
'll tell you what 'll do, Brad - 'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help
No, that won't help
Besides, you never get drunk
wanted to talk about you and Emily
Kane looks at Leland sharply before he speaks
(quietly) All right
(without looking at him) She's going to leave you - don't think so, Brad
We've just had word that the President is out of danger
(ruefully) It seems  didn't kill him after all
(takes his eye) She was going to leave you anyway - Kane takes this in
Emily's going south next week with the child
As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday
When they get back - (sharply) Brad, you are drunk
Sure  am
She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens
If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes
can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong - Why is she leaving me
(it's very hard for him to say all this) She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you
Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases
(hesitating) You might have made the whole thing less personal
No answer from Kane
It isn't just that the President was her uncle - everyone she knows, all the people she's been brought up with, everything she's ever been taught to believe is important - Still no answer from Kane
There's no reason why this - this savage personal note - The personal note is all there is to it
It's all there ever is to it
It's all there every is to anything
Stupidity in our government, complacency and self- satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally
They're not impersonal crimes against people
They're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the American people to own their own country is not an academic issue, Brad, that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers
You almost convince me
(rising) 'm just drunk enough to tell you the truth
have to be a little drunk for that because 'm a coward
You know that
That's why you keep me around
(smiles) You only associate with your inferiors, Charlie
guess that's why you ran away from Emily
Because you can't stand the company of your equals
You don't like to admit they exist - the other big people in your world are dead
told you that
Kane looks at Leland, but Leland can't be stopped now
He speaks very quietly - no poison in his voice - no personal indignation - as though he were explaining the nature of a disease
You talk about the people of the United States as though they belonged to you
When you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest
You talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty
Remember the working man
You used to defend him quite a good deal
Well, he's turning into something called organized labor and you don't like that at all
And listen, when your precious underprivileged really get together - that's going to add up to something bigger than - than your privilege and then  don't know what you'll do - sail away to a desert island, probably, and lord it over the monkeys
Are you finished
Yes
(looking down) Now, will you let me go to Chicago
(with a little smile) You're not going to like it in Chicago
They wind comes howling in from the lake
And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg - That's all right
(he won't be charmed out of his duty) What are you going to do about Emily
(his face hardning a little) Nothing - if she dosen't love me - Leland has risen
He speaks as he turns away, starting towards the door
You want love on your own terms, don't you, Charlie - (he stops - his back turned to Kane) Love according to your own rules
And if anything goes wrong and you're hurt - then the game stops, and you've got to be soothed and nursed, no matter what else is happening - and no matter who else is hurt
It's simpler than that, Brad society girl can't stand the gaff, that's all
Other things are important to her - social position, what they're saying on the front porches at Southampton, is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner - Leland has turned, taking his eye again
Now Kane stops and smiles
She can leave me
As a matter of fact, 've already left her
Don't worry, Brad - 'll live
know you will
(with all his charm) Hey, Brad
've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy
Leland shakes his head
Kane lifts his glass
To love on my terms
Those are the only terms anybody knows
his own
: -  - Kane, Leland, and a couple of policemen make their way out of the front toward a hansom cab
You moiderer
rock is thrown
It hits Leland on the face
little blood flows
Kane doesn't see it at first
Then when he's in the hansom cab, he turns and notices it
Are you hurt
Leland has a handkerchief to his face
No
wish you'd go home to Emily
She'll be pretty upset by all this - She still loves you - The crowd, pushed by the cops, retreats in the background, but still hard by
You still want to be transferred to the other paper
Yes
(leaning out of the hansom cab) Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York
It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth
(almost as a question) (with handkerchief still attached to his face) couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie
We'll let the salary stay where it is
The hansom cab starts up
We hold on Leland's face as we : : '    - '  -   - Emily is in bed, a damp cloth over her temples
Kane is standing at the foot of the bed
The baby's bed is in a corner of the room
The baby's nurse is standing near the crib, a nurse for Emily is near her
Kane is looking fixedly on Emily, who is staring tiredly at the ceiling
(to the nurse) Excuse us a moment, please
The nurse looks at Emily
(peremptorily) said, excuse us a moment
The nurse, unwilling, leaves
've been talking to Leland
Emily - You can't leave me now - not now - Silence
It isn't what it would do to my changes in politics, Emily -  That isn't it -  They were talking of running me for governor, but now, of course, we'll have to wait - It isn't that, Emily -  It's just - the president is your uncle and they're saying  killed him
Still silence
That story about the murderer having a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket - the "Chronicle" made that up out of whole cloth -  Emily, please - He's going to be all right, you know, he's going to recover - (bitterly) If it will make you any happier, we had nine pages of advertising cancelled in the first mail this morning
Bernstein is afraid to open any more letters
He - He stops
He sees that he's getting no place with Emily
(exasperated) What do you expect me to do
What in the world - (weakly) Charles
He waits for her to continue
Do you really think - (she can't continue) Those threatening letters, can they really - She sits up and looks at the crib
She almost continues to look at the crib, with almost unseeing eyes
(uncomfortably) They won't do anything to Junior, darling
(contemptuously) Anonymous letter writers -   've got guards in front of the house, and 'm going to arrange - (turning her face toward him) Please don't talk any more, Charles
Kane is about to say something, but bites his lips instead
Emily keeps staring at him
Have they heard from father yet
Has he seen - 've tried to tell you, Emily
The President's going to be all right
He had a comfortable night
There's no danger of any kind
Emily nods several times
There is an uncomforable silence
Suddenly there is a cry from the crib
Emily leaps from the bed and rushes to him
She bends over the crib
(murmuring) Here  am, darling
Darling
Darling, it's all right
Mother's here
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me
They won't hurt you, darling
Mother's with you
Mother's looking after you
Kane, unwanted, ignored, looks on
Tightening his lips, he walks out
: : '  - By the desk light, Kane is seen working with his usual intensity,  Reilly standing beside him at the desk
We'll withdraw support completely
Anything else
Mr
Leland sent back that check
What check
You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago
Oh, yes, the bonus
It was for twenty-five thousand dollars
Kane is perplexed and worried, but we can see in a moment his mind will be on something else
He sent it back torn up - all torn up into little bits, and he enclosed something else -   can't make it out
Kane doesn't answer
Reilly goes on
He has brought out a piece of paper and is reading it
It says here, " Declaration of Principles" - (he still reads) " will provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly" - Kane has looked up sharply
Reilly, sensing his look, stops reading and meets his eye
Slowly, Kane reaches out his hand
Reilly hands him the piece of paper
Without reading it, Kane tears it up, throws it into the wastebasket at his side
: -  - The evening of the final great rally
These shots remind us of and are identical with and supplementary to the "News Digest" scenes earlier
The vast auditorium with a huge picture of Kane, cheering crowds, etc
Emily and Junior are to be seen in the front of a box
Emily is tired and wears a forced smile on her face
Junior, now aged nine and a half, is eager, bright- eyed and excited
Kane is just finishing his speech
It is no secret that  entered upon this campaign with no thought that  could be elected Governor of this state
It is now no secret that every straw vote, every independent pole, shows that will be elected
And  repeat to you - my first official act as Governor will be to appoint a special District Attorney to arrange for the indictment, prosecution and conviction of Boss Edward
Rogers
Terrific screaming and cheering from the audience
: -  - The Speaker's Platform
Numerous officials and civic leaders are crowding around Kane
Cameramen take flash photographs with old-fashioined flash powder
Great speech, Mr
Kane
(pompous) One of the most notable public utterances ever made by a candidate in this state - Thank you, gentlemen
Thank you
He looks up and notices that the box in which Emily and the boy were sitting is now empty
He starts toward the rear of the platform, through the press of people, Reilly approaches him
wonderful speech, Mr
Kane
Kane pats him on the shoulder as he walks along
just got word from Buffalo, Mr
Kane
They're going to throw you the organization vote - and take a chance maybe you'll give them a break - This is said almost inquiringly, as if he were hoping that Kane would give him some assurance that McDonald is not making a mistake
There is no answer from Kane
On an independent ticket there's never been anything like it
If the election were held today, you'd be elected by a hundred thousand votes - and every day between now and November 7th is just going to add to your majority
Kane is very pleased
He continues with Reilly slowly through the crowd - a band playing off
Bernstein joins him
It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr
Bernstein
Rogers isn't even pretending
He isn't just scared anymore
He's sick
Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years
think it's beginning to dawn on Mr
Rogers that  mean what  say
With Mr
Rogers out of the way, Reilly,  think we may really begin to hope for a good government in this state
(stopping) Well, Mr
Bernstein
(clearly not meaning it) It's wonderful, Mr
Kane
Wonderful
Wonderful
You don't really think so
do
do
mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -   think it's wonderful you're going to be elected
Only - (interrupts himself) -  Can  say something
Please, Mr
Bernstein
Well, the way  look at it - (comes out with it) -  You want to know what  really think would be wonderful
Kane indicates he is to proceed
Well, you're running for Governor and going to be elected - my idea is how wonderful it would be if you don't run at all and don't get elected
: -    -  - Emily and Junior are standing, waiting for Kane
Is Pop Governor yet, Mom
Just then, Kane appears, with Reilly and several other men
Kane rushes toward Emily and Junior, as the men politely greet Emily
Hello, Butch
Did you like your old man's speech
Hello, Pop
was in a box could hear every word
saw you
(he has his arm around Junior's shoulder) Good night, gentlemen
There are good nights
Kane's car is at the curb and he starts to walk toward it with Junior and Emily
'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver - But 'd arranged to go home with you myself
There's a call  want you to make with me, Charles
It can wait
No, it can't
(she bends down and kisses Junior) Good night, darling
Good night, Mom
The driver is holding the rear door open as Emily guides Junior in
(as car starts to drive off) What's this all about, Emily
've had a very tiring day and - It may not be about anything at all
cab has pulled up
Cab
Emily nods to him
intend to find out
insist on being told exactly what you have in mind
'm going to - (she looks at a slip of paper in her hand) - 185 West 74th Street
Kane's reaction indicates that the address definitely means something to him
If you wish, you can come with me
Kane nods
'll go with you
He opens the door and she enters the cab
He follows her
: -  - Kane and Emily
He looks at her, in search of some kind of enlightenment
Her face is set and impassive
: -  - Kane and Emily, in front of an apartment door
Emily is pressing the bell
had no idea you had this flair for melodrama, Emiliy
Emily does not answer
The door is opened by a maid, who recognizes Kane
Come in, Mr
Kane, come in
They enter, Emily first
'  -  - There is first a tiny reception room, through which an open door shows the living room
Kane and Emily enter from the hallway and cross to the living room
As they enter, Susan rises from a chair
The other person  in the room - a big, heavyset man, a little past middle age - stays where he is, leaning back in his chair, regarding Kane intently
It wasn't my fault, Charlie
He made me send your wife a note
He said 'd - oh, he's been saying the most terrible things,  didn't know what to do
- (she catches sight of Emily) Good evening, Mr
Kane
(he rises) don't suppose anybody would introduce us
Mrs
Kane,  am Edward Rogers
How do you do
(pauses) came here - and  made Mr
Kane come with me
(she consults the note in her hand without reading it again) because  recieved this note - made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note
She was a little unwilling at first - (he smiles grimly) but she did it
can't tell you the things he said, Charlie
You haven't got any idea - (turning on Rogers) Rogers,  don't think  will postpone doing something about you until 'm elected
(he starts toward him) To start with, 'll break your neck
(not giving way an inch) Maybe you can do it and maybe you can't, Mr
Kane
Charles
(he stops to look at her) Your - your breaking this man's neck - (she is clearly disgusted) would scarcely explain this note - (glancing at the note) Serious consequences for Mr
Kane - (slowly) for myself, and for my son
What does this note mean, Miss - (stiffly) 'm Susan Alexander
(pauses) know what you think, Mrs
Kane, but - (ignoring this) What does this note mean, Miss Alexander
She doesn't know, Mrs
Kane
She just sent it - because  made her see it wouldn't be smart for her not to send it
In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman - (he puts a world of scorn into the word) is - 'm not a gentleman, Mrs
Kane, and your husband is just trying to be funny calling me one
don't even know what a gentleman is
(tensely, with all the hatred and venom in the world) You see, my idea of a gentleman, Mrs
Kane - well, if  owned a newspaper and if  didn't like the way somebody else was doing things - some politican, say - 'd fight them with everything  had
Only wouldn't show him in a convict suit, with stripes - so his children could see the picture in the paper
Or his mother
(he has to control himself from hurling himself at Kane) It's pretty clear - 'm not a gentleman
Oh
You're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother - Anything you say, Mr
Kane
Only we're talking now about what you are
That's what the note is about, Mrs
Kane
Now 'm going to lay all my cards on the table
'm fighting for my life
Not just my political life
My life
If your husband is elected governor - 'm going to be elected governor
And the first thing 'm going to do - Let him finish, Charles
'm protecting myself every way know how, Mrs
Kane
This last week,  finally found out how can stop your husband from being elected
If the people of this state learn what  found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher
Well, what 'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected don't care whether they know what know about him
Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral - (he stresses the world) Champeen of the people
Just as long as - think  understand, Mr
Rogers, but wonder if - (she leaves her sentence unfinished) You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't - (excitedly) Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name - That's the chance 'm willing to give you, Mr
Kane
More of a chance than you'd give me
Unless you make up your mind by tomorrow that you're so sick that you've got to go away for a year or two - Monday morning every paper in this State will carry the story 'm going to give them
Kane starts to stare at him intently
What story, Mr
Rogers
The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs
Kane
Emily looks at Kane
There is no story
It's all lies
Mr
Kane is just - (to Susan) Shut up
(to Kane) 've had a dozen men doing nothing but run this thing down - we've got evidence enough to - well, the evidence would stand up in any court of law
You want me to give you the evidence, Mr
Kane
You do anything you want to do
The people of this state can decide which one of us to trust
If you want to know, they've already decided
The election Tuesday'll be only - Mrs
Kane, 'm not asking you to believe me
'd like to show you - You don't have to show me anything, Mr
Rogers
believe you
'd rather Mr
Kane withdrew without having to get the story published
Not that  care about him
But 'd be better off that way - (he pauses) - and so would you, Mrs
Kane
What about me
(to Kane) He said my name'd be dragged through the mud
He said everywhere 'd go from now on - There seems to be only one decision you can make, Charles
'd say that it has been made for you
(pauses) suppose the details can be arranged tomorrow, Mr
Rogers
About the statements by the doctors - Have you gone completely mad, Emily
Emily looks at him
You don't think 'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you
don't see what else you can do, Charles
If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has - Oh, they'll publish it all right
But that's not going to stop me - Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you
'll be in it, too, won't
(quickly) And Junior
(squirming a bit) suppose so, but - 'm not afraid of the story
You can't tell me that the voters of this state - 'm not interested in the voters of this state right now
am interested in - well, Junior, for one thing
Charlie
If they publish this story - They won't
Goodnight, Mr
Rogers
(she starts out) There's nothing more to be said, Charles
Oh yes, there is
don't think so
Are you coming, Charles
No
She looks at him
He starts to work himself into a rage
There's only one person in the world to decide what 'm going to do - and that's me
And if you think - if any of you think - You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago
(she looks at Susan) You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened
(she sighs) Come on, Charles
Go on
Get out
can fight this thing all alone
You're making a bigger fool of yourself than  thought you would, Mr
Kane
You're licked
Why don't you - (turning on him) Get out
've got nothing to talk to you about
If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter
see
(he starts toward the door) (starting to cry) Charlie, you're just excited
You don't realize - know exactly what 'm doing
(he is screaming) Get out
(quietly) Charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late - Too late for what
Too late for you and this - (he can't find the adjective) this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me
Well, you won't do it, tell you
You won't do it
Charlie, there are other things to think of
(a sly look comes into her eyes) Your son - you don't want him to read in the papers - It is too late now, Charles
(rushes to the door and opens it) Get out, both of you
(rushes to him) Charlie, please don't - What are you waiting here for
Why don't you go
Goodnight, Charles
She walks out
Rogers stops as he gets directly in front of Kane
You're the greatest fool 've ever known, Kane
If it was anybody else, 'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you
Only you're going to need more than one lesson
And you're going to get more than one lesson
(he walks past Kane) Don't you worry about me
'm Charles Foster Kane
'm no cheap, crooked politician, trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes - -  - Camera angling toward Kane from other end of the hall
Rogers and Emily are already down the hall, moving toward foreground
Kane in apartment doorway background
(screams louder) 'm going to send you to Sing Sing, Rogers
Sing Sing
Kane is trembling with rage as he shakes his fist at Rogers's back
Susan, quieter now, has snuggled into the hollow of his shoulder as they stand in the doorway
: The "Chronicle" front page with photograph (as in the "News Digest") revealing Kane's relations with Susan
: : Front page of "Chronicle" - Headline which reads: : Front page of "Enquirer" - Headline which reads: : -  - Emily is opening the door for Leland
Hello, Brad - Emily - He pauses
Leland comes in
Emily closes the door
'm sorry  sent for you, Brad - didn't - Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours - She doesn't have anything to say
'm glad to see you
She smiles at him and we know that there isn't anybody else in the world for her to smile at
She's too grateful to talk
Are all the returns in
Leland puts his hat unconsciously on his coat by the newspaper
Let me see it
Leland takes the newspaper out of his pocket and hands it to her
She takes it
We see the headline, not an insert, but it registers
It reads: "Fraud at Polls
"  Emily is looking at the paper with unseeing eyes, and a little smile
(after a pause) Almost two to one - 'm surprised he got the votes he did
Emily
Why should anyone vote for him
He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them
Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him
And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars
Emily, you're being - a little unfair -  You know what  think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives - There aren't any personal lives for people like us
He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If 'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, 'd have left him then - know that, Emily - (on top of Leland) Maybe  should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was
(on the cue "dog") Emily, you - Brad, 'm -  'm not an old woman yet - It's - all over - He stops himself
(after a pause) Know it is, Brad - He's paying for it, Emily
Those returns tonight - he's finished
Politically - (he thinks) - socially, everywhere,  guess
don't know about the papers, but - If you're asking me to sympathize with him, Brad, you're wasting your time
(pauses) There's only one person 'm sorry for, as a matter of fact
That - that shabby little girl
'm really sorry for her, Brad
: Front page Chicago "Enquirer," with photograph proclaiming that Susan Alexander opens at new Chicago Opera House in "Thais," as in "News Digest
" On soundtrack during above we hear the big, expectant murmur of an opening night audience and the noodling of the orchestra
: -  -   "" - The camera is just inside the curtain, angling upstage
We see the set for "Thais" - the principals in place - stage managers, stage hands, etc
, and in the center of all this, in an elaborate costume, looking very small and very lost, is Susan
She is almost hysterical with fright
Maids, singing teacher, and the rest are in attendance
Her throat is sprayed
Applause is heard at the opening of the shot, and now the orchestra starts thunderously
The curtain starts to rise - the camera with it - the blinding glare of the foots moves up Susan's body and hits her face
She squints and starts to sing
Camera continues on up with the curtain, up past Susan, up the full height of the proscenium arch and then on up into the gridiron into a world of ropes, brick walls and hanging canvas - Susan's voice still heard - but faintly
The camera stops at the top of the gridiron as the curtain stops
Two typical stage hands fill the frame
They are looking down on the stage below
Some of the reflected light gleams on their faces
They look at each other
One of them puts his hand to his nose
: : '  -   -  - Leland, as in the same scene in the Bernstein sequence, is sprawled across his typewriter, his head on the keys
The paper is gone from the roller
Leland stirs and looks up drunkenly, his eyes encountering Bernstein, who stands beside him (also as in the previous scene)
Hello, Mr
Leland
Hello, Bernstein
Leland makes a terrific effort to pull himself together
He straightens and reaches for the keys - then sees the paper is gone from the machine
Where is it - where's my notice
've got to finish it
(quietly) Mr
Kane is finishing it
Kane
Charlie
(painfully, he rises to his feet) Where is he
During all this, the sound of a typewriter has been heard off - a busy typewriter
Leland's eyes follow the sound
Slowly he registers Kane in the City Room beyond
This is almost the same shot as in the previous Bernstein story
-   -  - Kane, in white tie and shirt sleeves, is typing away at a machine, his fingers working briskly and efficiently, his face, seen by the desk light before him, set in a strange half-smile
Leland stands in the door of his office, staring across at him
suppose he's fixing it up - know 'd never get that through
(moving to his side) Mr
Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it
Leland turns incredulously to Bernstein
He's writing a roast like you wanted it to be - (then suddnely - with a kind of quiet passion rather than a triumph) -  guess that'll show you
Leland picks his way across the City Room to Kane's side
Kane goes on typing, without looking up
After a pause, Kane speaks
Hello, Brad
Hello, Charlie - ( ) didn't know we were speaking
Kane stops typing, but doesn't turn
Sure, we're speaking, Brad - you're fired
He starts typing again, the expression on his face doesn't change
: : -  - Thompson and Leland on the roof, which is now deserted
It is getting late
The sun has just about gone down
Well, that's about all there is - and 'm getting chills
Hey, nurse
(pause) Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South - (as if trying to think) - you know
Shangri-la
El Dorado
(pauses) Sloppy Joe's
What's the name of that place
You know
All right
Xanadu
knew what it was all the time
You caught on, didn't you
Yes
guess maybe 'm not as hard to see through as  think
Anyway, never even answered his letter
Maybe  should have
guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years
He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything
Of course, he built it for her - That must have been love
don't know
He was disappointed in the world
So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy - It was something bigger than an opera house anyway - (calls) Nurse
(lowers his voice) Say, 'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow
Sure
On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars
Sure, Mr
Leland
'll be glad to
Hey, Nurse
Nurse appears
Hello, Mr
Leland
'm ready to go in now
You know when  was a young man, there was an impression around that nurses were pretty
It was no truer then than it is now
Here, let me take your arm, Mr
Leland
(testily) All right, all right
(he has begun to move forward on the Nurse's arm; turning to Thompson) You won't forget, will you, about the cigars
And tell them to wrap them up to look like toothpaste, or something, or they'll stop them at the desk
That young doctor was telling you about, he's got an idea he wants to keep me alive
: " "     -   - : " " glows on the dark screen as in the previous sequence earlier in the script
Behind the lights and through them, we see a nasty early morning
Camera as before, moves through the lights of the sign and down on the skylight, through which is seen Susan at her regular table,  Thompson seated across from her
Very faintly during this, idle piano music playing
: " "  -   - Susan and Thompson are facing each other
The place is almost deserted
Susan is sober
On the other side of the room, somebody is playing a piano
How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions
'd rather you just talked
Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr
Kane
You wouldn't want to hear a lot of what comes into my mind about myself and Mr
Charlie Kane
Susan is thinking
How did you meet him
had a toothache
Thompson looks at her
That was thiry years ago - and still remember that toothache
Boy
That toothache was just driving me crazy
: : - - Susan, aged twenty, neatly but cheaply dressed in the style of the period, is leaving the drug store
It's about 8 o'clock at night
With a large, man-sized handkerchief pressed to her cheek, she is in considerable pain
The street is wet - after a recent rain
She walks a few steps towards the middle of the block, and can stand it no longer
She stops, opens a bottle of Oil of Cloves that she has in her hand, applies some to her finger, and rubs her gums
She walks on, the pain only a bit better
Four or five houses farther along, she comes to what is clearly her own doorway - a shabby, old four-story apartment house
She turns toward the doorway, which is up a tiny stoop, about three steps
As she does so, Kane, coming from the opposite direction, almost bumps into her and turns to his left to avoid her
His shoulder bumps hers and she turns
As she does so, Kane, forced to change his course, steps on the loose end of a plank which covers a puddle in the bad sidewalk
The plank rises up and cracks him on the knee, also covering him with mud
(hopping up and down and rubbing his knee) Ow
Susan, taking her handkerchief from her jaw, roars with laughter
It's not funny
He bites his lip and rubs his knee again
Susan tries to control her laughter, but not very successfully
Kane glares at her
'm sorry, mister - but you do look awful funny
Suddenly, the pain returns and she claps her hand to her jaw
Ow
What's the matter with you
Toothache
Hmm
He has been rubbing his clothes with his handkerchief
You've got some on your face
If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter - Susan starts to laugh again
What's funny now
You are
You look like you've been making mud pies
In the middle of her smile, the pain returns
Oh
You're no Venus de Milo
(points to the downstair window) If you want to come in and wash your face -   can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers - Thanks
Susan starts, with Kane following her
: '  -  - It's in moderate disorder
The Mansbach gas lights are on
It's not really a classy room, but it's exactly what you're entitled to in 1910, for $5
00 a week including breakfast
There is a bed, a couple of chairs, a chiffonier, and a few personal belongings on the chiffonier
These include a photograph of a gent and lady, obviously Susan's parents, and a few objets d'art
One, "At the Japanese Rolling Ball Game at Coney Island," and - perhaps this is part of the Japanese loot - the glass globe with the snow scene Kane was holding in his hand in the first sequence
Susan comes into the room, carrying a basin, with towels over her arm
Kane is waiting for her
She doesn't close the door
(by way of explanation) My landlady prefers me to keep this door open when  have a gentleman caller
(starts to put the basin down) She's a very decent woman
(making a face) Ow
Kane rushes to take the basin from her, putting it on the chiffonier
To do this, he has to shove the photograph to one side of the basin
Susan grabs the photograph as it is about to fall over
Hey, you should be more careful
That's my ma and pa
'm sorry
They live here, too
No
They've passed on
Again she puts her hand to her jaw
Where's the soap
In the water
Kane fishes the soap out of the water
It is slippery, however, and slips out of his hand, hitting him in the chest before it falls to the floor
Susan laughs as he bends over
(starting to wash his hands) You're very easily amused
always like to see the funny side of things
No sense crying when you don't have to
And you're so funny
Looking at you,  forget all about my toothache
Her face distorts in pain again
Oh
can't stay here all night chasing your pain away
(laughs) know
But you do look so silly
Kane, with soaped hands, has rubbed his face and now cannot open his eyes, for fear of getting soap in them
Where's the towel
On the chiffonier
Here
(rubs his face dry) Thanks
(on her way to closet) 've got a brush in the closet
As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off
'll get these streets fixed, if it's the last thing  do
Susan comes out of the closet
She holds out the brush with her left hand, her right hand to her jaw in real distress
(takes the brush) You are in pain, aren't you, you poor kid
Susan can't stand it anymore and sits down in a chair, bent over, whimpering a bit
(brushing himself) Wish there was something  could - He stops and thinks
Susan, her face averted, is still trying hard not to cry
've got an idea, young lady
(there is no response) Turn around and look at me
(there is still no response) said, turn around and look at me, young lady
Slowly, Susan turns
Did you ever see anybody wiggle both his ears at the same time
It takes a second for Susan to adapt herself to this
Watch closely
(he wiggles his ears) It took me two solid years at the finest boys' school in the world to learn that trick
The fellow who taught me is President of Venezuela now
He's still wiggling his ears as Susan starts to smile
That's it
Smile
Susan smiles, very broadly
: '  -  - Closeup of a duck, camera pulls back showing it to be a shadowgraph on the wall, made by Kane, who is now in his shirt sleeves
It is about an hour later than preceding sequence
(hesitatingly) chicken
No
But you're close
rooster
You're getting farther away all the time
It's a duck
Excuse me, Mr
Kane
know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you
mean - 'm pretty ignorant, guess you caught on to that - (looks squarely at her) You really don't know who  am
No
That is,  bet it turns out 've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is - But you like me, don't you
Even though you don't know who  am
You've been wonderful
can't tell you how glad  am you're here, don't know many people and - (she stops) And  know too many people
Obviously, we're both lonely
(he smiles) Would you like to know where  was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes
didn't run into you and  bet they're not your Sunday clothes
You've probably got a lot of clothes
(as if defending himself from a terrible onslaught) was only joking
(pauses) This evening  was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouses - in search of my youth
Susan is bewildered
You see, my mother died, too - a long time ago
Her things were put into storage out west because had no place to put them then
still haven't
But now 've sent for them just the same
And tonight 'd planned to make a sort of sentimental journey - (slowly) - to the scenes of my youth - my childhood,  suppose - to look again at - (he changes mood slightly) and now - Kane doesn't finish
He looks at Susan
Silence
Who am
Well, let's see
Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six - (he stops on the word "sixty" - obviously a little embarrassed) run a couple of newspapers
How about you
Oh, me - How old did you say you were
(very bright) didn't say
didn't think you did
If you had,  wouldn't have asked you again, because 'd have remembered
How old
Pretty old
'll be twenty-two in August
(looks at her silently for a moment) That's a ripe old age -  What do you do
work at Seligman's
Is that what you want to do
want to be a singer
(she thinks for a moment) mean,  didn't
Mother did for me
(sympathetically) What happened to the singing
You're not in a show, are you
Oh, no
Nothing like that
Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me
Imagine
An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like
sudden look comes over Kane's face
Yes - As a matter of fact,  do sing a little
(points to the piano) Would you sing for me
(bashful) Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing
Yes,  would
That's why  asked
Well,  - Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again
Oh, no, that's all gone
Then you have no alibi at all
Please sing
Susan, with a tiny ladylike hesitancy, goes to the piano and sings a polite song
Sweetly, nicely, she sings with a small, untrained voice
Kane listens
He is relaxed, at ease with the world
: " "  -   - Susan tosses down a drink, then goes on with her story
did a lot of singing after that
sang for Charlie -   sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, didn't - What did you get
(glares at him balefully) What do you mean
Thompson doesn't answer
didn't get a thing
Just the music lessons
That's all there was to it
He married you, didn't he
He was in love with me
But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him
What about that apartment
He wanted me to be comfortable - Oh, why should  bother
You don't believe me, but it's true
It just happens to be true
He was really interested in my voice
(sharply) What are you smiling for
What do you think he built that opera house for
didn't want it
didn't want to sing
It was his idea - everything was his idea - except my leaving him
: '     -  - Susan is singing
Matisti, her voice teacher, is playing the piano
Kane is seated nearby
Matisti stops
Impossible
Impossible
Your job isn't to give Mrs
Kane your opinion of her talents
You're supposed to train her voice
Nothing more
(sweating) But, it is impossible
will be the laughingstock of the musical world
People will say - If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti,  may be able to enlighten you a bit
The newspapers, for instance
'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because  own eight of them between here and San Francisco
It's all right, dear
Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason
Aren't you, maestro
(he looks him square in the eyes) Mr
Kane, how can  persuade you - You can't
There is a silence
Matisti rises
knew you'd see it my way
: -  - It is the same opening night - it is the same moment as before - except taht the camera is now upstage angling toward the audience
The curtain is down
We see the same tableau as before - the terrified and trembling Susan, the apprehensive principals, the maids and singing teachers, the stage hands
As the dissolve commences, there is the sound of applause (exactly as before) and now as the dissolve completes itself, the orchestra breaks frighteningly into opening chords of the music - the stage is cleared - Susan is left alone, terribly alone
The curtain rises
The glare of the footlights jump into the image
The curtain is now out of the picture and Susan starts to sing
Beyond her, we see the prompter's box, containing the anxious face of the prompter
Beyond that, out in the darkness - an apprehensive conductor struggles with his task of coordinating an orchestra and an incompetent singer
Beyond that - dimly white shirt fronts and glistening bosoms for a couple of rows, and then deep and terrible darkness
Closeup of Kane's face - seated in the audience - listening
Sudden but perfectly correct lull in the music reveals a voice from the audience - a few words from a sentence - the kind of thing that often happens in a theatre - - really pathetic
Music crashes in and drowns out the rest of the sentence, but hundreds of people around the voice have heard it (as well as Kane) and there are titters which grow in volume
Closeup of Susan's face - singing
Closeup of Kane's face - listening
There is the ghastly sound of three thousand people applauding as little as possible
Kane still looks
Then, near the camera, there is the sound of about a dozen people applauding very, very loudly
Camera moves back, revealing Bernstein and Reilly and other Kane stooges, seated around him, beating their palms together
The curtain is falling - as we can see by the light which shutters down off their faces
The stage from Kane's angle
The curtain is down - the lights glowing on it
Still, the polite applause dying fast
Nobody comes out for a bow
Closeup of Kane - breathing heavily
Suddenly he starts to applaud furiously
The stage from the audience again
Susan appears for her bow
She can hardly walk
There is a little polite crescendo of applause, but it is sickly
Closeup of Kane - still applauding very, very hard, his eyes on Susan
The stage again
Susan, finishing her bow, goes out through the curtains
The light on the curtain goes out and the houselights go on
Closeup of Kane - still applauding very, very hard
: - '    -  - Some weeks later
Susan, in a negligee, is at the window
There are the remains of her breakfast tray on a little table
You don't propose to have yourself made ridiculous
What about me
'm the one that has to do the singing
'm the one that gets the razzberries
(pauses) Last week, when  was shopping, one of the salesgirls did an imitation of me for another girl
She thought  didn't see her, but - Charlie, you might as well make up your mind to it
This is one thing you're not going to have your own way about
can't sing and you know it -  Why can't you just - Kane rises and walks toward her
There is cold menace in his walk
Susan shrinks a little as he draws closer to her
My reasons satisfy me, Susan
You seem unable to understand them will not tell them to you again
(he is very close to her) You will continue with your singing
His eyes are relentlessly upon her
She sees something in them that frightens her
She nods her head slowly, indicating surrender
: : Front page of the "San Francisco Enquirer" containing a large portrait of Susan as Thais (as before)
It is announced that Susan will open an independent season in San Francisco in "Thais
"  The picture remains constant but the names of the papers change from New York to St
Louis, to Los Angeles to Cleveland, to Denver to Philadelphia - all "Enquirers
" During all this, on the soundtrack, Susan's voice is heard singing her aria very faintly and far away, her voice cracking a little
At the conclusion of this above, Susan has finished her song, and there is the same mild applause as before - over the sound of this, one man loudly applauding
This fades out as we - : '  - '    -   - The camera angles across the bed and Susan's form towards the door, from the other side of which voices can be heard
' Let's have your keys, Raymond
' Yes, sir
' The key must be in the other side
(pause) We'll knock the door down, Raymond
' (calling) Mrs
Kane - ' Do what  say
The door crashes open, light floods in the room, revealing Susan, fully dressed, stretched out on the bed, one arm dangling over the side
Kane rushes to her
Get Dr
Corey
Yes, sir
He rushes out
Susan is breathing, but heavily
Kane loosens the lace collar at her throat
: '  -   - little later
All the lights are lit
Susan, in a nightgown, is in bed, asleep
Raymond and a nurse are just leaving the room, Raymond closing the door quietly behind him
Dr
Corey rises
She'll be perfectly all right in a day or two, Mr
Kane
Kane nods
He has a small bottle in his hand
The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time,  should be only too glad -   shall be here in the morning
Thank you
can't imagine how Mrs
Kane came to make such a silly mistake
The sedative Dr
Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -   suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her
'm sure that's it
(he starts out) There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there
Not at all
'd like the nurse to be here, too
Of course
Dr
Corey leaves
Kane settles himself in a chair next to the bed, looking at Susan
In a moment, the nurse enters, goes to a chair in the corner of the room, and sits down
: '  -  - Susan, utterly spent, is lying flat on her back in her bed
Kane is in the chair beside her
The nurse is out of the room
(in a voice that comes from far away) couldn't make you see how  felt, Charlie
just couldn't - couldn't go threw with singing again
You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you
That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you
Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know
They don't want you
They just - (angrily) That's when you've got to fight them
That's when you've got to make them
That's - Susan's head turns and she looks at him silently with pathetic eyes
'm sorry
(he leans over to pat her hand) You won't have to fight them anymore
(he smiles a little) It's their loss
Gratefully, Susan, with difficulty, brings her other hand over to cover his
: - - Closeup of an enormous jigsaw puzzle
hand is putting in the last piece
Camera moves back to reveal jigsaw puzzle spread out on the floor
Susan is on the floor before her jigsaw puzzle
Kane is in an easy chair
Behind them towers the massive Renaissance fireplace
It is night and Baroque candelabra illuminates the scene
(with a sigh) What time is it
There is no answer
Charlie
said, what time is it
(looks up - consults his watch) Half past eleven
mean in New York
Half past eleven
At night
Yes
The bulldog's just gone to press
(sarcastically) Hurray for the bulldog
(sighs) Half past eleven
The shows have just let out
People are going to night clubs and restaurants
Of course, we're different
We live in a palace - at the end of the world
You always said you wanted to live in a palace
Can't we go back, Charlie
Kane looks at her smilingly and turns back to his work
Charlie - There is no answer
If  promise to be a good girl
Not to drink - and to entertain all the governors and the senators with dignity - (she puts a slur into the word) Charlie - There is still no answer
: : Another picture puzzle - Susan's hands fitting in a missing piece
: Another picture puzzle - Susan's hands fitting in a missing piece
: -   -  - Another picture puzzle
Camera pulls back to show Kane and Susan in much the same positions as before, except that they are older
One thing 've never been able to understand, Susan
How do you know you haven't done them before
Susan shoots him an angry glance
She isn't amused
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses
You may be right -   sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit - (snapping) It's not a habit
do it because like it
was referring to myself
(pauses) thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight
Invite everybody to go to the Everglades - (throws down a piece of the jigsaw puzzle and rises) Invite everybody
Order everybody, you mean, and make them sleep in tents
Who wants to sleep in tents when they have a nice room of their own - with their own bath, where they know where everything is
Kane has looked at her steadily, not hostilely
thought we might invite everybody to go on a picnic tomorrow
Stay at Everglades overnight
(he pats her lightly on the shoulder) Please see that the arrangements are made, Susan
Kane turns away - to Bernstein
You remember my son, Mr
Bernstein
On the soundtrack we hear the following lines of dialogue: ' (embarrased) Oh, yes
How do you do, Mr
Kane
' Hello
During this, camera holds on closeup of Susan's face
She is very angry
: -  - Long shot - of a number of classy tents
: : -   -  - Two real beds have been set up on each side of the tent rather classy dressing table is in the rear, at which Susan is preparing for bed
Kane, in his shirt-sleeves, is in an easy chair, reading
Susan is very sullen
'm not going to put up with it
Kane turns to look at her
mean it
(she catches a slight flicker on Kane's face) Oh,  know  always say  mean it, and then  don't - or you get me so don't do what  say 'm going to - but - (interrupting) You're in a tent, darling
You're not at home
And  can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice
'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think - (in a rage) - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business
You've got no right - (quickly) 've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan
Oh, 'm sick and tired of you telling me what  must and what musn't do
(gently) You're my wife, Susan, and - 'm not just your wife, 'm a person all by myself - or  ought to be
was once
Sometimes you get me to believing  never was
We can discuss all this some other time, Susan
Right now - 'll discuss what's on my mind when  want to
You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it
As far as you're concerned, Susan, 've never wanted anything - don't want anything now - except what you want
What you want me to want, you mean
What you've decided  ought to have - what you'd want if you were me
But you've never given me anything that - Susan,  really think - Oh,  don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you
What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at
It's only money
It doesn't mean anything
You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about
(he has risen) Susan,  want you to stop this
And right now
Well, 'm not going to stop it
'm going to say exactly what think
(she screams) You've never given me anything
You've tried to buy me into giving you something
You're - (a sudden notion) - it's like you were bribing me
That's what it's been from the first moment  met you
No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known
Tried to bribe them
Susan
She looks at him, with no lessening of her passion
You're talking an incredible amount of nonsense, Susan
(quietly) Whatever  do -   do - because love you
Love
You don't love anybody
Me or anybody else
You want to be loved - that's all you want
'm Charles Foster Kane
Whatever you want - just name it and it's yours
Only love me
Don't expect me to love you - Without a word, Kane slaps her across the face
They look at each other
You - you hit me
Kane continues to look at her
You'll never have another chance to hit me again
(pauses) Never knew till this minute - Susan, it seems to me - Don't tell me you're sorry
'm not sorry
'm going to leave you
No, you're not
(nods) Yes
They look at each other, fixedly, but she doesn't give way
In fact, the camera on Kane's face shows the beginning of a startled look, as of one who sees something unfamiliar and unbelievable
: '  -  -  - Kane is a the window looking out
He turns as he hears Raymond enter
Mrs
Kane would like to see you, Mr
Kane
All right
Raymond waits as Kane hesitates
Is Mrs
Kane - (he can't finish) Marie has been packing since morning, Mr
Kane
Kane impetuously walks past him out of the room
'  -  -  - Packed suitcases are on the floor, Susan is completely dressed for travelling
Kane bursts into the room
Tell Arnold 'm ready, Marie
He can get the bags
Yes, Mrs
Kane
She leaves
Kane closes the door behind her
Have you gone completely crazy
Susan looks at him
Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this
That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and - - And left
Of course they'll hear
'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but  never imagined that people wouldn't know
Kane is standing against the door as if physically barring her way
won't let you go
You can't stop me
Kane keeps looking at her
Susan reaches out her hand
Goodbye, Charlie
(suddenly) Don't go, Susan
Let's not start all over again, Charlie
We've said everything that can be said
Susan, don't go
Susan, please
He has lost all pride
Susan stops
She is affected by this
You mustn't go, Susan
Everything'll be exactly the way you want it
Not the way  think you want it - by your way
Please, Susan - Susan
She is staring at him
She might weaken
Don't go, Susan
You mustn't go
(almost blubbering) You - you can't do this to me, Susan - It's as if he had thrown ice water into her face
She freezes
see - it's you that this is being done to
It's not me at all
Not how  feel
Not what it means to me
(she laughs) can't do this to you
(she looks at him) Oh, yes  can
She walks out, past Kane, who turns to watch her go, like a very tired old man
: : " "  -  - Susan and Thompson at a table
There is silence between them for a moment
In case you've never heard of how lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me - The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people
They haven't been tough on me just lost my money
But when compare these last ten years with the twenty  spent with him - feel kind of sorry for him, all the same - (harshly) Don't you think  do
(pause) You say you're going down to Xanadu
Monday, with some of the boys from the office
Mr
Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff
We run a picture magazine, you know - know
If you're smart, you'll talk to Raymond
That's the butler
You can learn a lot from him
He knows where the bodies are buried
She shivers
The dawn light from the skylight above has grown brighter, making the artificial light in the night club look particularly ghastly, revealing mercilessly every year of Susan's age
Well, what do you know
It's morning already
(looks at him) You must come around and tell me the story of your life sometime
: : -  -  - An open door shows the pantry, which is dark
Thompson and Raymond are at a table
There is a pitcher of beer and a plate of sandwiches before them
Raymond drinks a glass of beer and settles back
Yes, sir - yes, sir,  knew how to handle the old man
He was kind of queer, but  knew how to handle him
Queer
Yeah
guess he wasn't very happy those last years - he didn't have much reason to be - : -  -  - Raymond walking rapidly along corridor
He pushes open a door
At a desk in a fairly elaborate telegraph office sits a wireless operator named Fred
Near him at a telephone switchboard sits a female operator named Katherine (not that it matters)
(reading) Mr
Charles Foster Kane announced today that Mrs
Charles Foster Kane has left Xanadu, his Florida home, under the terms of a peaceful and friendly agreement with the intention of filing suit for divorce at an early date
Mrs
Kane said that she does not intend to return to the operatic career which she gave up a few years after her marriage, at Mr
Kane's request
Signed, Charles Foster Kane
Fred finishes typing and then looks up
Exclusive for immediate transmission
Urgent priority all Kane papers
Okay
There is the sound of the buzzer on the switchboard
Katherine puts in a plug and answers the call
Yes
yes
Mrs
Tinsdall - Very well
(turns to Raymond) It's the housekeeper
Yes
She says there's some sort of disturbance up in Mrs
Alexander's room
She's afraid to go in
: '  -  -  - The housekeeper, Mrs
Tinsdall, and a couple of maids are near the door but are too afraid to be in front of it
From inside can be heard a terrible banging and crashing
Raymond hurries into scene, opens the door and goes in
'  -  - Kane, in a truly terrible and absolutely silent rage, is literally breaking up the room - yanking pictures, hooks and all off the wall, smashing them to bits - ugly, gaudy pictures - Susie's pictures in Susie's bad taste
Off of occasional tables, bureaus, he sweeps Susie's whorish accumulation of bric-a-brac
Raymond stands in the doorway watching him
Kane says nothing
He continues with tremendous speed and surprising strength, still wordlessly, tearing the room to bits
The curtains (too frilly - overly pretty) are pulled off the windows in a single gesture, and from the bookshelves he pulls down double armloads of cheap novels - discovers a half-empty bottle of liquor and dashes it across the room
Finally he stops
Susie's cozy little chamber is an incredible shambles all around him
He stands for a minute breathing heavily, and his eye lights on a hanging what-not in a corner which had escaped his notice
Prominent on its center shelf is the little glass ball with the snowstorm in it
He yanks it down
Something made of china breaks, but not the glass ball
It bounces on the carpet and rolls to his feet, the snow in a flurry
His eye follows it
He stoops to pick it up - can't make it
Raymond picks it up for him; hands it to him
Kane takes it sheepishly - looks at it - moves painfully out of the room into the corridor
'  -  - Kane comes out of the door
Mrs
Tinsdall has been joined now by a fairly sizable turnout of servants
They move back away from Kane, staring at him
Raymond is in the doorway behind Kane
Kane looks at the glass ball
(without turning) Close the door, Raymond
Yes, sir
(he closes it) Lock it - and keep it locked
Raymond locks the door and comes to his side
There is a long pause - servants staring in silence
Kane gives the glass ball a gentle shake and starts another snowstorm
Raymond - (he is almost in a trance) Yes, sir - One of the younger servants giggles and is hushed up
Kane shakes the ball again
Another flurry of snow
He watches the flakes settle - then looks up
Finally, taking in the pack of servants and something of the situations, he puts the glass ball in his coat pocket
He speaks very quietly to Raymond, so quietly it only seems he's talking to himself
Keep it locked
He slowly walks off down the corridor, the servants giving way to let him pass, and watching him as he goes
He is an old, old man
: '  -  -   - As the dissolve completes itself, camera is travellling across the floor of the chapel past the crypts of Kane's father and mother - (marked: James Kane - 18-  19-; Mary Kane - 18- 19-;) - past a blank crypt, and then holding on the burial of Kane's son
group of ordinary workmen in ordinary clothes are lowering a very expensive-looking coffin into its crypt
Kane stands nearby with Raymond, looking on
The men strain and grunt as the coffin bangs on the stone floor
The men now place over it a long marble slab on which is cut the words: 1907 - 1938 Sorry, Mr
Kane, we won't be able to cement it till tommorrow
We - Kane looks right through him
Raymond cuts him short
Okay
The men tip their hats and shuffle out of the chapel
Kane raises his head, looks at the inscription on the wall
It is a little to one side of Junior's grave, directly over the blank place which will be occupied by Kane himself
Do you like poetry, Raymond
Can't say, sir
Mrs
Kane liked poetry - Raymond is now convinced that the old master is very far gone indeed - not to say off his trolley
Yes, Mr
Kane
Not my wife - not either of them
He looks at the grave next to his son's - the grave marked "
" (catching on) Oh, yes, sir
(looking back up at the wall) Do you know what that is
(more his keeper than his butler now) It's a wall you bought in China, Mr
Kane
Persia
It belonged to a king
How did you get him to part with it, Mr
Kane
He was dead
That's a poem
Do you know what it means
No,  don't, Mr
Kane
didn't used to be afraid of it
short pause
His eyes still on the wall, but looking through it, Kane quotes the translation
The drunkeness of youth has passed like a fever, And yet  saw many things, Seeing my glory in the days of my glory,  thought my power eternal And the days of my life Fixed surely in the years But a whisper came to me From Him who dies not
called my tributary kings together And those who were proud rulers under me,  opened the boxes of my treasure to them, saying: "Take hills of gold, moutains of silver, And give me only one more day upon the earth
" But they stood silent, Looking upon the ground; So that  died And Death came to sit upon my throne
sons of men You see a stranger upon the road, You call to him and he does not step
He is your life Walking towards time, Hurrying to meet the kings of India and China
(quoting) sons of men You are caught in the web of the world And the spider Nothing waits behind it
Where are the men with towering hopes
They have changed places with owls, Owls who have lived in tombs And now inhabit a palace
Kane still stares at the wall, through it, and way beyond it
Raymond looks at him
: : -  -  - Thompson and Raymond
Raymond has finished his beer
(callously) That's the whole works, right up to date
Sentimental fellow, aren't you
Yes and no
(getting to his feet) Well, thanks a lot
See what  mean
He was a little gone in the head - the last couple of years, anyway - but  knew how to handle him
(rises) That "Rosebud" - that don't mean anything
heard him say it
He just said "Rosebud" and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor
He didn't say anything about that, so  knew he was dead - He said all kind of things  couldn't make out
But knew how to take care of him
Thompson doesn't answer
You can go on asking questions if you want to
(coldly) We're leaving tonight
As soon as they're through photographing the stuff - Thompson has risen
Raymond gets to his feet and goes to the door, opening it for him
Allow yourself plenty of time
The train stops at the Junction On signal - but they don't like to wait
Not now
can remember when they'd wait all day
if Mr
Kane said so
Raymond ushes Thompson into -  -  - The magnificent tapestries, candelabra, etc
, are still there, but now several large packing cases are piled against the walls, some broken open, some shut and a number of objects, great and small, are piled pell mell all over the place
Furniture, statues, paintings, bric-a-brac - things of obviously enormous value are standing beside a kitchen stove, an old rocking chair and other junk, among which is also an old sled, the self-same story
Somewhere in the back, one of the vast Gothic windows of the hall is open and a light wind blows through the scene, rustling the papers
In the center of the hall, a Photographer and his Assistant are busy photographing the sundry objects
The floor is littered with burnt-out flash bulbs
They continue their work throughout the early part of the scene so that now and then a flash bulb goes off
In addition to the Photographer and his Assistant, there are a Girl and Two Newspaperment - the Second and Third Men of the projection room scene - also Thompson and Raymond
The Girl and the Second Man, who wears a hat, are dancing somewhere in the back of the hall to the music of a phonograph
flash bulb goes off
The Photographer has just photographed a picture, obviously of great value, an Italian primitive
The Assistant consults a label on the back of it
9182 The Third Newspaperman starts to jot this information down
"Nativity" - attributed to Donatello, acquired Florence 1921, cost 45,000 lira
Got that
Yeah
All right
Next
Better get that statue over there
Okay
The Photographer and his Assitant start to move off with their equipment towards a large sculpture in another part of the hall
What do you think all that is worth, Mr
Thompson
Millions - if anybody wants it
The banks are out of luck, eh
Oh,  don't know
They'll clear all right
"Venus," Fourth Century
Acquired 1911
Cost twenty-three thousand
Got it
Okay
(patting the statue on the fanny) That's a lot of money to pay for a dame without a head
(reading a label) No
483
One desk from the estate of Mary Kane, Little Salem, Colorado
Value $6
00
Okay
flashlight bulb goes off
We're all set to get everything
The junk as well as the art
Thompson has opened a box and is idly playing with a handful of little pieces of cardboard
What's that
It's a jigsaw puzzle
We got a lot of those
There's a Burmese Temple and three Spanish ceilings down the hall
Raymond laughs
Yeah, all in crates
There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it
wonder how they put all those pieces together
(reading a label) Iron stove
Estate of Mary Kane
Value $2
00
Put it over by that statue
It'll make a good setup
(calling out) Who is she anyway
Venus
She always is
He sure liked to collect things, didn't he
He went right on buying - right up to the end
Anything and everything - he was a regular crow
wonder -  You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell
Thompson has turned around
He is facing the camera for the first time
Charles Foster Kane
Another flash bulb goes off
The Photographer turns to Thompson with a grin
Or Rosebud
How about it, Jerry
(to the dancers) Turn that thing off, will you
It's driving me nuts
What's Rosebud
Kane's last words, aren't they, Jerry
(to the Third Newspaperman) That was Jerry's angle, wasn't it, Jerry
Did you ever find out what it means, Jerry
No,  didn't
The music has stopped
The dancers have come over to Thompson
Say, what did you find out about him, anyway, Jerry
Not much
Well, what have you been doing
Playing with a jigsaw puzzle - talked to a lot of people who knew him
What do they say
Well - it's become a very clear picture
He was the most honest man who ever lived, with a streak of crookedness a yard wide
He was a liberal and a reactionary; he was tolerant - "Live and Let Live" - that was his motto
But he had no use for anybody who disagreed with him on any point, no matter how small it was
He was a loving husband and a good father - and both his wives left him and his son got himself killed about as shabbily as you can do it
He had a gift for friendship such as few men have - he broke his oldest friend's heart like you'd throw away a cigarette you were through with
Outside of that - Okay, okay
What about Rosebud
Don't you think that explains anything
No,  don't
Not much anway
Charles Foster Kane was a man who got everything he wanted, and then lost it
Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get or lost
No,  don't think it explains anything
don't think any word explains a man's life
No - guess Rosebud is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle - a missing piece
He drops the jigsaw pieces back into the box, looking at his watch
We'd better get along
We'll miss the train
He picks up his overcoat - it has been resting on a little sled - the little sled young Charles Foster Kane hit Thatcher with at the opening of the picture
Camera doesn't close in on this
It just registers the sled as the newspaper people, picking up their clothes and equipment, move out of the great hall
: -  -  - large furnace, with an open door, dominates the scene
Two laborers, with shovels, are shovelling things into the furnace
Raymond is about ten feet away
Throw that junk in, too
Camera travels to the pile that he has indicated
It is mostly bits of broken packing cases, excelsior, etc
The sled is on top of the pile
As camera comes close, it shows the faded rosebud and, though the letters are faded, unmistakably the word "" across it
The laborer drops his shovel, takes the sled in his hand and throws it into the furnace
The flames start to devour it
-  - No lights are to be seen
Smoke is coming from a chimney
Camera reverses the path it took at the beginning of the picture, perhaps omitting some of the stages
It moves finally through the gates, which close behind it
As camera pauses for a moment, the letter "" is prominent in the moonlight
Just before we fade out, there comes again into the picture the pattern of barbed wire and cyclone fencing
