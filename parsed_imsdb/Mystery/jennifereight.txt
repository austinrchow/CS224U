"    - -
" That's a notice on a wall
Here's another notice "
" Everyone is smok- ing
This is an  meeting
There's a lot of Faces to look at
don't know when we'll get to the one that's talking, but when we do it's like this
Eyes like glue
50 years old with a face the color of a snuff-users hanky
He says this: after my third recovery my wife made me swear 'd never bring another bottle into the house
And  never did
bur- ied it under the lawn
Cut out a turf & stood it upright with a piece of tin- foil instead of a cork
So here we are out in the yard, and she's happy because 'm getting healthy in a pair of swim- ing shorts & no way near no booze
She decides to prune the roses
Meanwhile, 'm laying there with a straw stuck in- to the fucken lawn doing a quart of red
Curious thing about drunks
Their disease often amuses them
That's how crazy  was -  was sick for half a life till  finally found my san- ity again in these rooms
Don't take that drink - And for the one or two new faces see here,  say this: just do it by the day
You gotta do it by the day - Don't take that drink
And keep coming to these meetings
Because here is where it works
Thank you, Benny
We have a few more minutes
Anyone else like to share
Ash into an ashtray and now a face
He's around 40 years old
Intense eyes & dark hair
Probably good looking when the ang- le's right
But this is a bad angle
His name is
My name's John
and 'm an alcoholic
Hi, John
didn't intend to speak today
Matter of fact,  wasn't gonna come to the meeting
But  wanna say a couple of things  hope may be of use, particularly as Benny says, to the new faces here
first came into this fellowship ten months ago
came to a meeting  was convinced was gonna be my last - how could a buncha drunks help me
- Then someone got up,  think it was Micky, and described himself as "the shit around which the universe revolved
"  don't know if that was original to him - it doesn't matter, it was the first time 'd heard it, and  still can't think of a better way to describe how  felt - We all have our own place in the darkness, and  was in such a mess  could hardly fucken see - 'd lost someone very dear to me - she hadn't died - had -  don't know whether she left coza the drinking, or whether  drank coz  knew she was gonna leave - either way, the booze won -  replaced her with alcohol & anger - was angry with her, myself, everyone and everything - Where  was  wanted to be someplace else - any place but here - any moment but now - But here  am, and it is now, and there's a big change about to hap- pen in my life - and 'm going for it coz this time  know 'm not running away - 'm actually two miles into a 600 mile journey, and  feel good about myself going there - So  stopped off to share that with you - and to thank everyone of you, and everyone in this fellowship for letting me walk out of here, free
2:
High above the Golden Gate
Too high for specifics
But there is something down there of interest to the Camera
Descending with the Music it seems to isolate a particular car
Too many and too distant to know which it is
But the Camera is follow- ing and already a mile up the 101 Interstate travelling north
Maybe via a dissolve
And maybe not
But red and white either way as the headlights are coming on
The Camera is closing on the highway
And a car has definitely been selected
There is nothing much of interest about it
It's a blue Mercedes sedan
Mussorgsky will choreograph the pace of these cuts
The first puts the frame directly in front of the car
In a few moments its brights snap up
And Titles continue in a dazzle of light
3:
101
Nobody in the car except
And a lot of cigarette smoke
Just time to wedge in a
There's an intersection coming up
He hits the indicators and crosses lanes winding his wind- ow down
Takes a last hit at his cigarette and exits the butt
4:
An instant of red as the cigarette shatters up the highway heavy sky of red and black cloud
The Mercedes turns off head- ing east
This time the Camera doesn't follow
Remains static over the intersection until the tail lights finally disappear
5:
Bare wooden boards and the sound of singing birds
This house hasn't been lived in for years
No furniture other than a new mattress in the middle of the floor
Still in polythene wraps
just about awake on top of it
Ten seconds of disorien- tation while he puts this together
stone fireplace
Stairs leading to what's got to be a tiny room above
With enough ef- fort this place could be charming
But right now it's a wreck
6:
This kitchen was out of date by 1963
huge china sink and a fat fridge
But the cooker works and a battered old kettle is already on the gas
-shirt and instant coffee
checks cupboards out
Crockery includes a cup and that'll do for now
His lips articulate a silent expletive
The gas has just gone out
Tries to relight it without success
On hands & knees he explores a rubber supply pipe that snakes under the back door
7:
In the garage he finds the gas cylinder
Empty and so is the bastard with it
He drags fingers through hair in frustration
Looks around at the heaps of crap that need clearing out
The view beyond he hardly cares to look at
But if he does it is as follows
Clouds massing on the horizon
Fields getting re- ady for rain
His nearest neighbor is around 200 yards away
His nearest Cow about 50
This house is remote and rural look- ing with a veranda out back
But  has no inclination for sight-seeing
As he walks away a dreary female Voice seeps in
8:
/
The Voice comes via a police scanner
Most of this dialogue's bullshit
Illegally parked autos and a few drunks still about
sits on the mattress eating a breakfast of chewing gum and milk
He unwraps another Juicy Fruit and regrets it
Goes round his mouth like a shoe in a washing machine
reluctant decision is taken
Spits gum at the sink as he arrives in the kitchen
Starts unloading his leather bag
flotsam of stuff is excavated including a 9mm Beretta and a pack of cigarettes
He lights up and takes a cruel hit full of nicotine and guilt
Wouldn't need a clairvoyant to realize he's trying to give up
Something on the scanner interests him and he wanders back to the living room
There's a call going out for "David 72 Sam 3
" David 72 acknowledges and  clearly recognizes the voice
"We have a 927D/ Springfield Street/ City Dump
" But David 72 is already hired
"'m outside Emersons/  wanna be the first horrible face of her day
"  exhales through a smile
The Controller needs an
for the 927
David 72 doesn't know
Advises her to roll a couple of cars and "Secure the location
" 9:
Chevrolet zig-zags up a shabby canyon
It's the road to the city dump
Its final bend reveals a line of bellowing garbage trucks
Everything is backed up
Nothing moves except the car
The cause of the hold-up is explained at the top
Sheriff's car blocks the road
Uniform moves to wave the Chevrolet in
10:
//
The car parks at a weigh-house and a man in his 50's gets out
Looks like he hasn't slept in a while
And got the mood to go with it
Sports jacket and cowboy boots
lot of laugh lines around the eyes
But you wouldn't want to get arrested by him
And especially not this morning
His name is
You can drive down there, Sir
'm already walking
Where is it
One of those walking with him is a 10-year-old Kid with a Dog
looks almost too young to own his struggling moustache
On the infill
The guy from 's just gone down there
He has
What's he doing here
He was waiting for you, Sir
Wait- ed a good while
Said he'd go down and take a look
hope that's
The track sinks through a valley of a million discarded tires
Damn , it's
With a bit of luck 'm goin home
What we got
derelict
They cut his throat
The information comes from freckles and a missing front tooth
Who are you
Trimble
He wears glasses and wields a rusty
22 pump-action Remington
Where do you fit in, Trimble
His father's the manager, Sir
The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body
Get ready for it, coz 'm tell- ing ya, you're in for a shock
speaks with some enthusiasm
looks back with none
They slit him from "ear to ear
" Ya want me to make a statement
Not right now
No
Thank you
11:
series of terraces have been created as the canyon fills up
Black smoke drifts from a distance at will of the wind
Gulls and bulldozers
Plus a stinking ten foot cliff of human filth
Several cars parked here including the blue Mercedes
Several On Lookers behind yellow police tape
negotiates it look- ing pissed off
Looks up and somewhere in the smoke is
Did you bring it with you
hope 'm not intruding
Be my guest
What you got
Old guy, offed himself with a knife
can't find the knife
And the next thing  is looking at is a death in the trash
massive dozer in the background
Everything else is garbage
They cut his throat
Would you get outside the tape
And tell your dad to put that fire out
that ain't legal
Another face here is so familiar  hasn't bothered to ackn- owledge it
is a 32 year old local newspaper reporter
Little is visible of the body except a blood-stained raincoat
wonder what would make him do a thing like that
Don't annoy me, Travis
No, Sir
Truck horns wail in the distance
On the horizon it's thunder
So where's the knife
wears surgical gloves
Removes film from a small camera
dunno
Guess the dozer musta shifted him
You need some hands up here to look
You heard
Look for the knife
Swatting smoke  directs anger at a fat cop called
You, too
Move that ass
hands the film to  as he gets into identical gloves
You done the pockets
No, Sir
haven't started till Monday
'm a "tourist
" "Welcome to Eureka
" By now  is crouched next to the Corpse examining the wound
How long's he been feeling like this
Week or two
Musta been on the ker- osene
Stinks like a diesel engine
Fucken noddle's hanging off
Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper
You sure it's a suicide
Uh huh
He's well rehearsed
What does that mean, Sergeant
Cut your own throat, you're ner- vous about it, tend to hesitate
He's got three trial cuts, lower left side of the neck, before he works up courage for the big one
looks vaguely impressed
begins searching pockets
You think Popeye would know that
don't think Popeye would be here
(
) Dead dog over here, Sir
Find the knife
And Venab- les, is the coroner called
Yes, Sir
He's delayed
Alright, gentlemen, 'm gonna leave you
got a couple of questions for the paper, Serg- eant
Mind if  swing by later, wring out a tea-bag with you
My pleasure
Who's Popeye
Your predecessor
He did- n't like to get outta bed
Catch you later, Freddy
Off he fucks under an ailing sky
lands a friendly grin
So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing
Watch my lips, coz you're not gonna believe this - this is a rare occurrence
We haven't had a body in eighteen months
He finds keys and change and a sandwich in the Wino's raincoat
How does anyone dead as this lose a knife
What about that kid, Ross
Oh, shit
Of course
The kid
(Stands to shout) Travis
Find that kid and get the knife off him
He's gonna lie to you - but he's got it - so get it
Well, go on, get on with it
Whatta you staring at
stares up like he just stuck his dick in a light socket
think  found some- thing horrible, Sir Whatta you mean, "horrible
" think 've found a hand
12:
crouches in garbage
Peers into a trash sack with assist- ance of a flashlight
"You're right
It's a fucken hand
" Pas- ses the light to
His turn to examine the ruptured bag
Looks like a woman's hand
finally stands
Offs the flashlight
And hands it back
What do you think
think you're here all day
13:
Pissing with rain and unspeakably miserable
The 'grid-search' is in progress and 50 square yards of the dump have been ripp- ed to pieces
Intermittent voices from police radios
More veh- icles down below including an ambulance with hazards revolving
Up here half a dozen arc-lights scald off vapor
search- es under a busted umbrella
Looks up and runs into 's eyes
How much longer we here
We're not gonna find nothing else
He wears a rubber cape & looks like a huge pissed-off Napoleon
We give it one more hour
Did the photographer do the dogs
The dogs
Two dogs
He should do the dogs
And both turn towards a Voice shouting from deep in the gloom
Sergeant - we got a brassiere over here
Looks like it could be blood
Oh, shit
Alright, 'm coming
Another intrusion from the radio
repeats the question
The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict
Ask him
Yeah, he can go
Think 'll lay down with him
Only way 'll get outta here
Did someone say something funny
Does  just about smile
It's good to be with you, Ross
And this is probably the only time  will look happy today
Glad you finally made it, Bro
14:
The Mercedes descends an incline and parks
Brown Chevys and black & white patrol cars
Dismal lights and raining like it doesn't end
gets out and unloads the trunk (aquarium & insulated picnic box)
Slams the trunk and reveals
You want some umbrella
Proffers a big yellow one plus assistance carrying equipment
Is this normal
Average rainfall, 48 inches
Pisses down, October to June
Raining hard enough to hurt
brisk intimacy across the lot
Better in the summer
You get to fucka few tourists
He hits a security code at the door
Obviously familiar with the station
Dialogue continues as they step into a corridor
15:
/
[] Not married are you, Sergeant
[No
] That's good, you get to fuck a few more
So how long you known Freddy
Freddy
Forever - he was my serg- eant when  was a kid - don't get to see a lot of each other - but we been buddies two hundred years
Did he get you the job
think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough -  think he may have bribed the old guy to retire
Popeye wasn't old
Younger than you
They push through doors into the biggest room in the building
dozen desks back to back and all the clutter and clatter of typewriters and paperwork and Secretaries swapping the gossip
Too many cops to describe and no time to remember them anyway
But here's one making introductions
About 60 years old
Face a mix of brick and fat
The Chief of Eureka Police is
Sergeants Serato, and Taylor
Any handshakes and greetings that fit in around the equipment
Mr Travis,  think you know
Do me a favor, Travis
Bring in the resta the stuff from my car
tosses his parasol "Don't lose it" and follows
Did you find the knife, Sergeant
No
But we have a theory
Kid told me he didn't take it
Maybe he's lying to you
By now they're in an  shaped room with wood benches and bull- etin board all over the walls
Bullshit everywhere in packing cases
Dusty Playboy spreads amongst other junk on the boards
Is it true you found a hand
And he benches the aquarium as  loses the insulated box
Is that it
(
) Interview over, Blattis
'mon, Chief, if it's sensitive, tell me
'm not taking notes
Right now the box contains camera equipment which is unpacked
we got a body part
We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out
Now you know as much as we do
Grateful for your candor, Sir
Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours
Till we do  don't want no one worrying about
Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant
Come on, Michael, outta here, the guys trying to move in
told you what we know, something else, you- 'll be the first to hear about it
Woman's face around the door
"Los Angeles for Sergeant Ber- lin
" And goodbye  as Berlin reaches for the telephone
Why did he ask if it was frozen
That,  couldn't tell you
And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone
splits as  picks up "Hey, Ronzo, good of you to call
"  long phone lead and he continues to unpack equipment
(Phone) Listen, my time isn't good - but two things - really important - the bras- siere  sent you
-  need to know if those stains are human blood - and if they are, do they match the blood in the sample
- 'mon, gimme a break, don't know anyone up here, it would take two weeks - 'mon, Ronny, 'm ask- ing nice
really need to know wheth- er 'm interested in that brassiere
cut-out of Popeye The Sailor with fist round a camera on the wall
Telephone resistance is collapsing and he breaks a smile
You're my favourite man - raining - gotta go - Ronny -  gotta go - got a house fulla removal men and a date at the morgue - And, Ron, Con- gratulations - you're my first call
16:
has a Vic inhaler up his nostril
An inadequate defense
sudden stink slams into his neck muscles
Head and inhaler travel rearward
He shifts eyes to  who scans the Bum's autopsy reports
comments on his handiwork into a microphone hanging from the ceiling
"Except as previously noted, the liver is not remarkable
"  doesn't believe it
if the knife hadn't killed him, the booze would
nev- er seen such a bad cirrhosis
You say the cut's left to right
(He does) Isn't that unusual
He's left handed
He picks up a nicotine-stained left hand
Simultaneously a wants  to sign in exchange for the picnic box
guess he was so drunk, he did- n't know which hand he was using
(Re box) What are you gonna do with it
Depends how healthy it is
If it's any good, 'll try and get a print
He hands the clip-board back and remembers a question for
Oh, Ross, that newspaper guy at the station, asked me if the hand was "frozen
" Why would he ask me that
Frozen
've no idea
Another fast fix on the Vic and  chews fresh gum
need- le on a weighing machine quivers
"The liver weighs 1420 grams
" few beers wouldn't do that to you, would they
No, Freddy
Not a few
17:
An explosion of hugs in the kitchen
Everything happens at once
is slim and dark and still looking "twice as pretty
" She's got compliments for  too if they can get out of each- other's arms "You're looking wonderful, John
" But greetings are better performed than described, so 'm leaving it to the actors
You do a rush on three pizzas
He emerges from the refrigerator wielding a bottle of champagne
'm not giving him Pizza haven't seem him for a year
'm gonna cook him a dinner
Dinner's another night, darlin
This is a drive-by
got an hour
He detours via the kitchen door to shout upstairs
"Hey
Bobby
" Bobby's out
What's the hurry
Friday night at City Hall
Got a great chance to frighten the fat
Freddy's new obsession
Who is who
professional, whining, con-person bitch with an ass the size of Africa
fights a difficult cork "You wanna get some glasses, Honey
" She's an accounts-manager, very pal- ly with our mayor, up to her elbows in fraud, and  just can't prove it
So tonight she confesses
Tonight 'm feeling lucky
The cork explodes and he goes for glasses but one isn't willing
Not for me
What d'you mean,  just opened it for you
This is French champagne
No it isn't
It's Californian
Even better
Not today
'm on a diet to- day
'll take a diet soda
Since when did you drink diet soda
Stop nagging him
If he doesn't want it, he doesn't want it
You- 're quacking like an old duck
And she's already at the fridge and popping a can of diet cola
Here you go, Honey
You're looking wonderful, John can't believe we got you here
How's the new residence
What does that mean
Not too good in daylight
'mon, just shut your eyes until it's painted
You're gonna love it
This is "God's Country," John
18:
This in huge close-up
Focus hardens on a finger tip
shock of light
The focus adjusts and a flash bulb fires again
- moves away from the view-finder
Chewing gum stuck to the side of the camera returns to his mouth
He activates an auto- matic rewind
It fills the silence while he heads for a phone
lot of paraphernalia and technical type of shit
The bullet- in board is filling up
Photographs chronicle the hours spent on the dump
He dials with eyes on the pictures
dozen cata- logue discovery of the bra
"This is Mike Blattis/ can't take your call right now/ If you have a message/You know the sound
" 19:
//
reel to reel tape recorder the size of a refrigerator domin- ates the room
black board details day/night/weekend shifts
security monitors
rack of night-sticks
And of course paperwork
crouches over a desk filling something in
Would you drop these off for me
Sure he will and six rolls of film are handed across
"Are you winning, Sir
"  smiles and  follows him out into the corridor
couple of Coppers on their way in
One big and morose looking called
The other we've already met
Tay- lor is a tall balding guy with hazy reddish hair "How you doin
" responds a happy "
" with eyes returning to
You know something strange about that hand
think it was frozen
Frozen
Yeah
What does that mean to you
Apparently little
They arrive in the big room
It's deserted
'mon, Venables, you're a policeman
And policemen always have an answer
Well, Sir
Well, what
Well, we had a very bad murder here, coupla years ago
Not act- ually in our county, but south of here
Girl with no head, no hands
You didn't read about it
(He didn't) It was big shit
They had forty, fifty detective working it
Nev- er identified her
Never found the head, never found the hands
vacuum cleaner starts somewhere but  isn't hearing it
So it could be that some crazy's stored her hand in a freezer, and only now decided to get rid of it
Where do  find the file on that
In there if we got anything believe the code was "Jennifer
" is already looking
last question as  leaves
Was it really frozen, Sergeant
No
Been dead two weeks
20:
The atrophied Hand is emersed in some kind of fluid
Index and second fingers bound with wire just below the upper joint
- reaches for steel pliers
His face remains in close-up for a nasty "snap" as he cuts a finger off
He's filling a syringe with the same fluid when  walks in
"Jesus, you still here
" What time is it
Seven thirty-five
Here, "Town Gets Top Cop
"  was gonna pin it to your wall
newspaper featuring a small photograph and article on Berlin
Holding the Finger he carefully inserts a hypodermic needle un- der the wire
Gently shoots in fluid to inflate the finger pad
Why so coy about the word "frozen"
Because, don't get into it
There's nothing in the files
Watch my lips
Don't get into it
The Finger pad is sufficiently restored to try and get a print
It wasn't our case, wasn't our coun- ty, and got nothing to do with that
21:
slide projector does its stuff on a sheet of card pinned to the door
Close-up of the Hand and off screen voice of
"Notice anything weird about it
" The answer from  is "No
" pen moves into frame and  points to marks on the Hand
Look - 1 - 2 - 3/4 - 5 - 6  - 7
The machine shunts up another slide
Now the back of the Hand
count eleven scars on this hand, and four that might be
Now count em on my hand
Five
'm 42 years old
This girl's about 18
How come she's got so many scars
He walks out of the projection beam and neon light flutters on
So tell me about "Jennifer
" Reaches for a pack of cigarettes and perches on a nearby stool
You know 'm gonna find out
counts out cigarettes
And destroys them in an ashtray
It's an "unsolved
" They spent 500 thousand dollars & bought emselves a dead end - You might wanna check it with Taylor, he worked the case
already did
What's his problem
reaches for the paper & thumb-tacks it to the wall "That
" He thinks you stole his promotion
(Re cigarettes) What exactly you doin there, John
It's a method for quitting smoking
Zippo opens (sports
insignia) and  lights up
He takes a punishing hit and exhales a lungful across the lab
That's an interesting method
Must help beat the withdrawal
Back on his feet  is about to begin more work on the Hand
It's a technique  read about
If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59
Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58
Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none
Because it's a ritual you gotta go through with
'm down to 10
Daftest thing Ross ever heard
is poised to make a print
You want my advice
Maybe
Find yourself a farmer's daughter with nice big fucking tits, and shake that "bye-bye
" Send it to Sacramento, John
sniff grief

&  are opposite ends of a bed jammed on the stairs
"Bastards
gave em a 20 buck tip
" Various navigational sug- gestions from  win them another stair
Plus advice from a 12 year old called
"You gotta go left, Dad
"  knows he's gotta go left
Both heave as  walks out the kitchen
You're all done except the floor
The house is a zoo of furniture
Bullshit piled up everywhere
You're a saint, Margie, thanks
By now she's got the apron off and her coat on
"'mon, Bobby
" Don't forget the wagon, Darlin
And off they go via a slammed door as the phone starts to ring
23:
In they stagger
The bed goes down
And  sprawls on top of it
Devastated for oxygen
"Alright
That's it
'm fucked
" You gotta stop smoking
am stopping smoking
don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking,  mean stop
was exactly like you are
used to wake in the night - heart going so hard coulda made love with my left tit
If  can stop, you can
How'd you do it, old man
Someone bet me a dollar
dollar
Not worth giving up for a dollar

Reaches for the Ansa Phone
Alright
'll bet you fifty

Fifty dollars
You got a bet
During these proceedings the machine has moved to another call

()/
And here's part of the "exhumation
"  stares at a tele- type machine waiting for transmission on Jennifer to complete
Approximate date of birth/Approximate date of death/ Identity Unknown
Visible misgivings as he hauls it out and reads
One or two chairs already on desks
still at his pawing over documents with a detective called
Cigarette smoke and shirt sleeves
looks up and catches  as he passes
Chief,  gotta talk to ya about this fat lady
What about her
She's making my life a misery
wanna give her a lie-detector test
continues up the carpet
"Alright, we'll talk about it
" 25:
florescent glow from a
monitor supplies the only light
vacillates interest between the scanner and the screen
(
) What is that
Laser enhancement of the finger- tip
it's really bothering me
See these striations right here
(Green on the screen) It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger
Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something
But  isn't interested in finger nails
He's staring at a polystyrene torso of a faceless girl
She wears a brassiere stuffed with newspaper and a black wig
(Welcome Jennifer Two) She's almost identical to Jennifer
Slim - White - same age - bra size is even the same
Nicely made lady
stares at the Dummy like he's gonna ask it a question
How do you know her hair's black
Hair on her hand
Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair
What is all this Jennifer stuff
He waves a handful of teletype before dumping it on a bench
These cases aren't connected, John
Yes, Sir,  think they maybe
think "Jennifer," and this lady got hit by the same guy
don't see that at all
On the board is a super-imposed picture of a hand over a wrist
got four points of posit- ive comparison on the cut
Yeah, that's all very inter- esting, but where's the body
question he doesn't need because he hasn't an answer has an eye on further photographs relevant to the Jennifer case
don't know nothing about this "Jenn- ifer" girl, cept what some of the guys told me - but principal feature of the case was a gruesome displayal of the body
He wanted it found
So if this is the same guy, why's he hidden this one
Another question he can't answer - and this time he doesn't get a chance -  walks in with an apology for the interruption
Got a face like Humphrey Bogart's mother fucked a different guy
Just wondered if you had time to get around to my pharmacy stuff
You'll have it in the morning
Alright, 'll try again tomorrow
Bisley has gone but his tension stays
unwraps fresh gum
Probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall
He worked a lotta time on this
thought it was Taylor's case
Sucked in officers from all over the county
And it was the worst six months this station ever had
This is 's shop and  isn't gonna row it with him
What do you want me to do, Chief
'm not telling you what to do
What  will say, is right now, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this
He refers to a little bicycle
Vouchered and obviously stolen
By now  is at the hinges
pause before he disappears
Why don't you give it a minute, & stop by my office
We should talk
26:
Melted neon in the streets
wet mid-town night
Nothing but sound of windshield wipers and click of a Zippo lighter rides stoic passenger while  drives with festering eyes
what does he think it is
[] Everything it isn't [make a left]
He even tried a "self-inflicted
" It's possible
'mon, Ross, the bra and hand were in different bags a 100 feet apart
They stop at a light and a beeper goes as warning to the blind
What's she gonna do
Dump her bra in one bag, her hand in the other, and wander off whistling Hey Jude
It's the garage on the far corner
is worrying at his fingertip on the wheel of the Zippo
You can't stop it, can you
What do you mean
Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles
What do you mean, Ross
The lights change and off they go and  waits for a turn
Why don't you dump it
Mail it off
Give the fucking
a present
Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady
" Because  dislike her too much
and 'm not in love with this fukker
That's how  feel about him
No you don't
That's how you think you feel about him
That's how you feel about yourself
You won't give yourself one-fucking-minute for you
And by now they've arrived and pulled up on the garage forecourt
It's indicative of their friendship that  can talk like this
Wait for me
It might not be ready
He quits the car and  watches him scurry towards a service shop
Rain beats on the roof and  looks stubbed out
lot of cuts coming up and here are some of them
Runs a hand through his hair in unconscious frustration
finger constantly bothers the Zippo
Eyes towards  who silhouettes in florescent light
Somewhere in the background the lights change to red
Once again the beeping sound of traffic-lights speaking to the blind
Maybe he looks across but that doesn't matter
Something just happens inside his head he isn't yet quite aware of
Everything in close up
Big on the Zippo
Big on
And he leaps out of the car
sprints through the weather
station wagon is still in the air at the end of an hydraulic jack
Surprise from  and a as  arrives
Fuck the fanbelt and listen to this
just had this insane idea - if 'm wrong, 'll take a week off and redecorate your entire house
Rain beats at the roof and the jack sinks the wagon behind them
She's blind, Ross - that's why all the scars - hear that traffic light
That noise is to help blind people - that's why the marks on her finger- tips
- this lady reads in Braille

sits at a desk at the end of the room
Nothing here but a legal pad and a phone
The pad is covered in names & numbers
Right now he's into a call and this is sounding promising
"How old
" And he writes 26
"How long
" About 6 weeks ago
Hope in his eyes as he looks across to a woman called
She's doing what he's doing on a different line "Wait a minute,  specific- ally said  was looking for a girl
" And all hope over because Lesley is a boy
But here comes  & this might be something
Shasta-Trinity Institute
Line one
Sticks a sheet of notes on his desk and he junks the last call
(New call) Hello
Yes
This is Sergeant Berlin
Yes, that's right believe my assistant explained
How long ago was that
Uh-huh
Who is who
Whass his name
Goodridge
'll hold
in transit grinning from ear to ear
interested in little but his notes and  in nothing but obvious good news

Mussorgsky is back on a shock cut
Big music and a shattering landscape
Juniper woods and mountains
Sunlight on fresh fal- len snow
Somewhere a long way off a car crawls up the valley
Ross's car bursts into frame and as quickly the bend snatches it away
An unexpected building in the distance
Victorian at a glance but probably later
clock tower and fifty lifeless windows
The Chevy disappears towards its somber architecture

What ex- actly is your interest in Amber
'm afraid  can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge
As  ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for
Then what are you hoping 'm gon- na do
Dissuade, or persuade you
was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is
Then you could have saved yourself a lot of driving, Sergeant
What said on the phone's the same as 'm saying now
got no idea where Amb- er is, or who it was took her there
He doesn't like them but not as much as  doesn't like him
blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with
You find something curious in that
Yeah,  guess  do
Then let me put your mind at ease
Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left
And you got no idea with who
No, Sergeant,  got no idea with who
And  might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their Christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name -won't-know-either
could sock him in the crop but the phone rings and he ex- cuses himself to answer it
Whatever he hears he isn't liking
You have an appointment with Miss Robertson
Yes, Sir
As she's a member of my staff, may  ask what this is about
Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with
see
Well, she's teaching an- other class at four
'd apprec- iate it if you don't detain her

Looking back down a deserted corridor
Someone tried to put sun- shine on the walls with yellow paint
Somewhere a long way away there is a sound like children singing
loathes this joint
Loathes its silence
Eyes back to  as he rings a doorbell
Where is everyone
dunno
guess this is staff side of the building
Here come footsteps and the door is opened by
Early 20's and blonde and not immediately beautiful
But delic- ate features than need no make up and big dark eyes
They look away for introductions as though she's shy
&  grab glances as they follow in
Neither expected  to be blind

Claustrophobia evaporates instantly
Great views down the val- ley from every window
Plus a bizarre jumble of furniture and colors
But no pictures on the walls
No friendly photographs
Nor any lights
Although the afternoon is shutting down there isn't a light in the room
elects to stay at the windows
takes an offered chair
sits nervously opposite
What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross
'm Mr Berlin
Mr Ross is right here
And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's
(She nods) 'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left
Take your time, and nothing's too trivial,
Well,  think  told you on the phone
went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things
What kind of friend
Was he a boy friend
An old friend
New friend
Lots of headshake
And lots of silences
" really don't know
" That's
Can you give me any idea what this fellow was like
(Headshake) Well, d'you know how old he was
(Headshake) Alright, let me put it this way
How old d'you think  am
Twenty- six
Thirty-nine
Or fifty-three
Fifty-three
Possibly the only grin  is going to get out of this place
You must have some idea about him
When we spoke on the phone, did you know  was blonde
No
Why not
You heard my voice
good point
And a point taken
And  might even say so
We don't have some kind of sixth-sense, you know
Ex- cept in ridiculous novels
Now another silence overtaken by a low whistle in another room
He used a breath freshener
sardonic headshake from
Well that solves the case then
And  think his name was John
John
You never said that on the phone
What makes you think his name was John
don't know
guess she must have called him John
'm mak- ing tea
Would you like some
would but  wouldn't
She leaves and whispers begin
This looks promising think this one could be it
Thank Christ we got a witness
Let me just keep going a while

Watches one or two cars driving away
Watches a bird sitting outside on the fire-escape
's voice can just about be heard off screen "You said he spoke
Can you re- member what he said
"  saunters back into 's answer
Well, he just said, come on, hurry up, will you, because it's starting to snow again
Empty teacups and empty notebook
sits opposite
And  remember, he was a lit- tle breathless from carrying the cases because the elevat- or had gone out that weekend
The elevator wasn't working
No, it has a mind of its own
clock strikes four somewhere
And  knows he's lost it
Can  see your hands
My hands
He takes her hands and  immediately looks uncomfortable
He examines scars and she stares at him with her useless eyes

Is there anything else you can tell me
Anything about him or her
Doesn't matter how small
No

Yes

No, you didn't
Alright,  didn't, but  nearly did, and if  had 'd have been right

Maybe not

If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it
Pay me, and  shut up

Then give me that Zippo
Why

don't want excuses,  want that weird-looking stuff called "cash
" Snaps fingers "Gimme the lighter

'm gonna do you a big favor
Forget the 50 and 'll keep this
What do you want it for
To throw out of the window
Does it as he says it
Bye-bye Zippo
can't believe it
What are you doing, Ross
've had that 15 years
It's not your friend
It keeps you sucking
Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs
remember the old bastard's liver
don't believe you did that
had a great sent- imental attachment to that
You want me to stop the car
An academic question considering the Zippo went down a ravine
No
Get me to that garbage dump
'm gonna find that fucking dog

Gloom congeals around flashlights
winter mist falling down

He wants to see the victim

Sand dunes and an infinite stretch of beach
Behind the sea-break is a lagoon and a tiny harbor
Berlin's Mercedes descends the coast road towards it

Shining brass and varnish
But like him it's getting on and often grumpy

How come the
don't put anya this together
They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months
They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity
Identity of whom
You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense
She's untraceable, John
You need fifty detectives on this
That's what 'm here for
want you to come and see Citrine with me
He's not gonna here it from me but  know he'd listen to you
Listen to me saying what
wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces
Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years
For a dead dog
We've fused into a major series, Ross
This girl isn't the second victim
This is "Jennifer Eight
" And this is the second time they stop and stare at each other
That old Wino on the heap wasn't a suicide
He stumbled into some- thing, saw something, and whoever took him out knew how to fake it
That isn't what you said before
was wrong
Says it with remarkable humility considering he's the "expert
" 'm going in to see Citrine this afternoon
Will you come with me
You're not
He's in hospital
He was trying out a new pair of skis in his hallway
The phone rings, and he goes for it, and falls off
He must be the only skier in Northern California to break a leg in his living room
They arrive at the Chandler's with  in no mood to smile
You believe me, don't you
What does it matter what  bel- ieve
What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes
But he doesn't really believe it
And doesn't enjoy saying no
But  can't help you with this
We can't go through the door with two contentious issues, you with a mass murderer, and me with the Mayor's best friend
Do that, we lose both

Sunlight streams in staining the air red

Perhaps not

Realizes just how beautiful she is
And  realiz- es someone is there
Before she can ask he identifies himself
Have you been here long
No, just a minute or two knocked on your door - no one home, so  followed the music
'm sorry
'll get my things
No problem
'm not in a hurry
But she's already fussing about stuffing sheet music in a bag
Matter of fact,  saw a little restaurant place down the road
Looked kinda pretty
thought maybe we could have some lunch
No answer but the answer is no

Alright, whatever
Was some- one in here with you
When came in the door was flapping

) Well, some cars sound fat and some cars sound thin, and this kind of car sounded "hollow"
Any moment now they turn a corner of the stairs into close-up
Maybe it was a foreign car
Our kinda cars sound "fat

Of course  would
His smile deteriorates as he realizes she's "staring" at him
What are you staring at, Hel- ena

That's alright
You suddenly reminded me of him
He was standing right where you are, kind of breathless, like you
Nothing happening except the wind
Then a smile as she leaves

And he begins an exploration
Musty bathroom with old-fashion- ed fixtures
tap leaking behind shower curtains
Nothing in the cabinet
Nothing under the sink
Six steps and he is in a kitchen
Finally finds something worth looking for
Tears the sack out of a vacuum cleaner
Discovers a knot of hair from a black dog
Simultaneously the door slams
Shock powers him in- to the sitting room in time to hear a key turning in the lock
Hits the door and shouts
Hears footsteps moving rapidly away

It was probably the wind
Hellava wind that turns a key

Takes the book while she gets into her coat
She's obviously made an ef- fort
change of clothes and her hair pinned up

There's no one "looking at you"
There's hardly anyone in here
The only person looking at you, is me
And he likes what he's looking at
And maybe  senses it
Are you married

But  don't like to talk about it
You just asked me to ask you questions
know, but you pick on the one time in my life  like not to remember was in the bad lands
Really not well
It's something that happens to a lota cops
We don't wanna talk about that
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears
" Yeah, that'll do
Is that "Hamlet

Do you like poetry
His attention is temporarily elsewhere

It's like you want me to say stop
You must know that's the way this is going, John
There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been
Then where's the body
Where's the body, and why's he hidden it
He hasn't hidden it
He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast
She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow
Have you got a match on the bullet
No
Have you got a print from the hand
No, Sir
It could be anyone's hand
Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris
It's her hand
Her scars
Her dog
Her dog's shot
And she's missing
She's not "missing
" Did she shout
Did she scream
Did he coerce her
No
She left of her own free will
And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing
You got no case, John
If you're not gonna hear me, Chief
have heard you
You just don't like hearing me
You got this whole damned thing outta proportion
don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but  don't believe there's a Police Chief, in this country, would put a task force together for a body part

dunno,  daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff
We should be out chasing major violators
wish he'd tell that to Citrine
He almost does the whiskey but reaches for chewing gum instead
He thinks the kid shot the dog
He looks at  like what-are-you-looking-at-me-like-that-for
He didn't
Did  say he did
You looked like you did
No,  think you'll find  looked like he could have
By accident even
He's up here spraying the scenery all day
He didn't shoot it, Ross
And no way by accident

This room and the interrogation room are linked with a one-way mirror

But something about her ex- pression expects apology
paces the place chain-smoking
listens devastated as the  explains his lousy chart
This is the important one
She gets a dead straight line, and that's an exceptional reading
this is the stupidest thing we ever done
Fucking Citrine's gonna fire one of us for this
can't believe it
just know she someway busted it
This is an honest girl
She couldn't lie if she tried
Is she lying, Ross
For a moment there is an intense trust between  and
Yes
Alright fuck it
Let's go for broke
grabs the read out
Fueled on residual anger he vanishes out the door
is fir- st at the mirror to see him reappear in the interrogation room

The polygraph machine looks like state of the art
table and two chairs
takes one and sits opposite
She at- tempts a smile but he kills it with the intensity of his stare
My name's Sergeant John Berlin
And the time is his
He knows what he's doing
And she doesn't

What d'ya mean, Sergeant
Well, look at it
Look at this line
That's the important one
Dead straight down the page
No- body gets a dead straight down the page
Even our expert says a dead straight's "exceptional
" All he's doing is telling her truth
Up to her to interpret it
Thought you might wanna comment
tongue slides through the lipstick like something being born
wasn't actually lying, Officer
And suddenly the only thing holding her chops up is Max Factor
He's got her on the roll now and all it needs is one more push
You busted the box, lady
You flunk- ed it
You lied about things you didn't need to lie about
The only truthful statement you made's your name
Your name is Carol Emerson
The quivering lip and flooding eyes amalgamate into a horrible sort of groan
She's bellied up and anxious to spill her beans
better get through the door fast because he might laugh
You tell one more lie, you're go- ing in a cell
Sergeant Ross is coming in to take your statement

Such a shame
She's a really sweet kid
She's a doll

Bobby, what happened to that beer
Rule one, is you don't diddle around with a witness
He's happy, darlin
'm sure he is

She's in Europe
Working
Clearly a sensitive subject and  decides the truth is best
She married some English prick
He's not that bad of a guy
Got a handshake like a partially excited penis

Her loss, darlin

Darkness in about an hour
Wide over the car park
Sand dunes surround it
Practically deserted of cars
Headlights snap on focusing attention on a station wagon exchange of good-byes

You don't ask what 'm like

What did he say

And you have a nervous tick
He said that
What else did he say
Just your age
Which is what

They arrive at the car and his suggestion is met with an appropriate response from
You wanna drive
'mon we're in a car park, miles from any- where
There's nothing arou- nd but nothing and sand dunes
" can't drive a car

But he's not hearing
'mon it'll be fun
You can drive me around in circles
No lady ever had a driving lesson like this before

Arm on the back of it
Hand on the wheel

The Mercedes straightens and heads through the dunes

Headlights behind them approach quickly
Disappear and reappear as they follow the geography of the dunes

Her anxiety is misinterpreted
He takes the wheel
No problem
Let him pass
The vehicle is right up behind them

And still scared even though  has stopped the car

painting of Ronald Reagan fills the screen
So awful it's al- most impressive
Next to it is a formal photograph of the City Mayor (Mr Heineman)

"It's not great art, but  change the col- ors

Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman
Don't underestimate me
the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute
Three or four
'm talking, outside the girl
Once
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy
Says, you're upsetting his students
That's bullshit, He says, you freaked one of em out
(Reading the letter) "Asking a newly blind kid if he can 'see,' is both cruel, and dangerous"
He floats the letter across the desk and hears the explanation
never asked if he could "see
" just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything
And did they
No
rubs his forehead in preparation to change the subject, 'm not a nasty man, John, 'm a nice man

The guy you replaced was something you- 're not - a lazy sonovabitch - but the reality is,  was getting a faster ser- vice outta Popeye than  am outta you
can't allow this to continue, John
If there was any argument to be had  would be arguing it
don't want you up at that institute again
and 'm flat-out about that
'm sorry,  know it means something to you - you can go tell your witness if you feel you must - but as far as you're concerned, the case is closed

Colored lights strung across the street
Symptoms of Christmas everywhere
Store windows full of trashy decorations and every- thing soluable in mist
and  develop out of it like Polaroids
Their destination is a dingy looking downstairs bar

No God, Brother
If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking

This is the local Copper's bar

Laughter & sugar music

How come he's suddenly so forth- coming

If he'd discussed it with me,  mighta gotten somewhere
Stop it

For what

Remember me
Up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes
If there's a body under the snow, fuck it
Let somebody else worry about it
You gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this
Just makes to so God damned mad
You're a fucking great policeman, but give yourself a break
You're here 5 minutes, you find yourself a fucking homicide
Not many people could do that in a place like this
And you gotta admit, there's a lot of shaky areas in this case
mean, stop me if 'm going up the wrong nostril
Waving his empty at the bar  communicates need for another
How d'you know this girl isn't lying to you
Not lying as such, but mak- ing up stuff to keep you coming back
She wasn't lying about the van
Alright, she wasn't lying about the van
But it could have been any van
Any little foreign diesel
She's blind, Bro
It's sad
She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around

Very late and the only light comes from coloured bulbs pulsing on a Christmas tree

One is just about important enough to get a close-up

Tears it out and seals it in an envelope
Shirt sleeves and yawns
He slumps in the chair & stares at "Jennifer 8

He's had enough of it
Grabs several envelopes and turns out the lights

emerges from one office and heads for another
Tay- lor on the door
Delivers the envelope and an his way out when something detains him
Lights on the tree strobe through venit- ian blinds
Illuminate bits and pieces of rattan
Plus a board covered in Christmas cards and a pair of steel filing cabinets
Maybe motivated by the booze
But a desk drawer is open almost before he realizes it and he searches for a key
Nothing but a bunch of business cards and family snaps
Taylor with his Moth- er Taylor with his Sister (red hair like him) and Taylor with his Dog
The drawer slams and one underneath opens
Same flot- sam of personal junk
Scotch Tape and paper clips and more bus- iness cards
bottle of tablets and salad of loose ammo
Fuck all else and he closes the drawer
But what's this
cane let- ter rack at the rear of the desk where he finds a pair of keys
Excitement lasts as long as it takes to try them
Don't fit ei- ther lock
Now he's staring at the shadows with nothing moving but thoughts
few moments more and he's heading for the door
68:
Massive close-up of the lock
weird looking tool goes in and another follows it
This bastard ain't easy even for an expert
The frame widens to reveal
He shuffles picks in a wall- et on top of the cabinet
Was that a noise somewhere
He stops to listen
wipes cold sweat away
Only thieves and foxes about
final twist and the lock delivers
Several dozen manilla col- ored files from which to choose
pair of folders titled Jenn- ifer travel to the desk
The first is full of press-cuttings & some gruesome looking snaps
Next file and this one looks more interesting
notebook full of random questions/answers/comm- ents
list of ships and sailing times
"   " Underlined twice
"'
" Also under- lined
Lists of numbers
Street numbers
Vehicle numbers
What- ever they might be is history because the neon just flashed on
stands in the doorway
The surprise is mutual
The play one-sided
This is already 's game
Smokes his cigarette
is up to elbows in the jam jar and up to him to explain
feel like 'm getting close to this guy
and all the time, feel like 'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load
'm sorry, King
What are you looking for
Vehicle references
Wrong cabinet
He gestures to the right one
feels about 2 inches tall
'm gonna get some coffee
When you finish in here, maybe you'll let me know
got a report to type up
As he exits he tosses a bunch of keys
They crash uselessly on- to the desk
looks like he couldn't get a fuck with mud

The mood is low as it goes
And so is the angle
Ultra low beh- ind the car
Just road and a blur of tires

Brake lights on as it descends the hill

Christmas vacations and the building sounds deserted
's foot steps might be the only sound in the place
They stop and a bell rings
Ho tries to assemble sox* kind of appropriate ex- pression
But as soon as she opens the door it's obsolete
- looks pretty as flowers & delighted he's here
She reaches for his hands
And every new second makes it a tougher goodbye
72:
Oh Jesus look at this
She prepared him a surprise dinner
And she looks so happy about it
pathetic little table with cand- les and Forget-Me-Nots and can of Diet Coke by his plate
He's barely through the door and goodbye is already in deep trouble
wanted it to be a surprise

Why did she have to do this
And why didn't he tell her over the phone

Candles low and the atmos- phere junk

You know
How do you know
Coz you hardly said a word since you got here
But you been thinking pretty loud
She stands and collects the cups and gets halfway with a smile
'll make some more coffee

hiss of running water
Close on the kettle
Close on the tap
She knows what he's going to say
And now she's alone her face doesn't mask her feelings
She's missing him already
But does- n't know why
Simply knows she doesn't want him to say goodbye
She reaches high into a cupboard
Her shirt stretches over her breasts
Christ this girl has a great figure
Carting hair out of her eyes she returns to the sink
For an instant she's star- ing out of the window and right into somebody's face
Tall and weird looking
But just a glimpse before he moves rapidly away
75:
has moved to the sofa
shaft of dead sunlight crosses the apartment
comes in making a brave face of it
Does- n't realize he's moved
"'m here, Helena
" And she smiles and changes direction
Puts the coffee tray on a table in front of him
No music now and all sounds in close-up
Close on the lip of the coffee pot as she pours
Close on the cup she gives him
Everything close in Helena's world or her world wouldn't exist

Not a lot to look at but the man is looking in
From his
he's fortunate
sits facing him but  has his back to the window
This sort of surveillance is always ominous and here is no exception
's explanation comes with occasion- al use of hands
suddenly smiles so it can't be all bad
They stand and  reaches for his coat
crosses the room
Finds her Forget-Me-Nots and now they're his at the door
As he takes them he takes her hand
Kisses her finger tips and can't avoid embracing her
They kiss like awkward kids bumping noses
Finally part and disappear into the dark of the hallway

is already in the elevator
Resists doors determined to separate them
They shunt in and out perpetually informing him he's on the 4th floor
"'ll call,
" She nods and releases his hand
He watches her walk all the way back up the corridor
78:
Headlights follow the meandering road
Another bend and lights in the distance
In seconds he's passing the Diner
Still open with cars out front including the white Volkswagen that nearly busted his fender
He's not gonna stop
Then decides to
Makes a  and pulls in
Parks a couple of vehicles away from the van

finishes the dishes
Stacks a last plate and closes the cupboard
Heads back into the living room
Something about the apartment doesn't sound right
She follows the noise through a door into a bedroom
Curtains dance in the darkness and behind them she finds a half open window
Curious because she doesn't remember leaving it open
Secures it and silences the icy wind

checks the driver's door
Locked and he explores with a pencil-flashlight
Moves to a slide door at the side
Simultan- eously the door to the Diner opens releasing a quartet of midd- le-aged Drunks
He dissolves while they bullshit around

Spots something red
cigarette butt caked in lip- stick
But what's this white stuff
Some kind of powder spills from a capsule crushed in the door rails
He picks it up for a look and gets a bad one from behind
"Whatta you doing, Mister
" finds himself facing an irate looking Woman in her 20's
lot of red hair and freckles
But definitely more frightened than angry
His Police Department badge is an instant sedative
Gives her some crap about thefts from vehicles round here
She should keep her doors locked
She smiles and thought they were

She hands it across and he inspects it coz that's what cops do

You up there a lot
Oh, it was you that nearly ran into me
No, it was you that nearly ran into me
You up there a lot

If there's moonlight that's the only light
Nothing to see but a pair of large taps
Nothing to hear but a bath filling
Then something starts bleeping
It's a liquid-level-indicator activ- ated by rising water
hand searches for taps
Shuts them off and silences the indicator
The frame expands to reveal
She moves to a hand basin
Finds a brush and fixes hair
Finds a clip and pins it up
Close as she kicks off shoes
Pantyhose descend on top of them
Walks into the living room unbuttoning her shirt
Vanishes into the bedroom and the Camera waits
Ret- urns with towels and the Camera follows back into the bathroom
creaking hinge as she closes the door
dressing gown hangs on a hook
She reaches for it and turns and virtually bumps in- to the Sonovabitch
Dressed in black and stealthy as a cat
He retreats a pace deeper into the darkness
Just enough light to see he wears glasses
And just enough light to see her undress
unzips her skirt
Slides it down her lags
Drapes it on a chair
Removes her shirt and hangs it on the back
She wears a white brassiere and panties
And no apologies for repetition
This is a fantastic body
She checks water temperature
Either too hot or too cold
Either way a tap goes on
Now she reaches behind her back
Unclips her bra
Gets hit with dazzling light
The Intruder is taking photographs
And if this is his turn-on he's in paradise
She stands in front of him in total oblivion
Her panties join clothes on the chair
Nov she's naked and now another picture
Again the bathroom detonates with white light
His face is concealed by the camera
But this bastard is about to run out of luck
Moves in as she silences the tap
Suddenly a lot of silence about
twists in panic
She just heard something
Didn't she just hear something
Is somebody in here
Fear kills her scream
She hits at the darkness
But he's gone

Big close on telephone ringing
No one home except the machine and Camera
The former answers on behalf of Berlin [John, it's me
please call me
left two messages at the police stat- ion

The camera moves on
Breakfast remains on the table
Newspaper still in its wraps
Out the window a bonfire rages in the yard

clears rubbish from the garage
Grime and sweat and the effort's got him breathless
Heaves another armful on the fire
The phone starts ringing again
This time he decides to answer

in a hurry to get there
Footsteps tell the story
Fast up a corridor and through a door
Faces look as he crosses the department
and  and
But only one face of interest
turns halfway through lighting a cigarette
"Are you outta your fucken mind
"  says nothing
"If any- thing happens to that girl, 'm gonna break your fucking back
" Just easy on the words you're putting in my face, Sergeant
Whass going on here
question practically every expression in the place is asking
His blind friend got "attacked
" Angelo went up there, and some- how, it got itself in the paper
You put it in there
may have said some- thing
don't recall
Don't lie, Taylor
just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case
Alright,  gave him the case
So the case is closed, so what
His indifference inflames
Smashes the newspaper at him
So read it
You just hung a target around her neck
Bullshit
Don't you know nothing about this guy
He reads the newspapers
Col- lects the cuttings
When are they gonna find her
Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness
You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried
Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert
Just walk away from me, Taylor
Now the volume is going up
Now the whole department is silent
You think you're the only guy ever worked a homicide
was a big-city cop too
And  bust- ed the clock on fucken Jennifer
know more about this man than you'll over know - and that's how  know it ain't him - you- 're investigating a soap-opera
Alright, guys
We stop this now
He tells her, "bye-bye," and she gets "attacked
" Well, give me a fucking break
There is no "Ser- ial Killer

Shut up, King Jay
No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over
You know what everyone thinks
They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass
And no one's blaming you for it,  hear she's worth the flowers
But don't come in here get- ting holy over us
Sure  put it in the paper
Coz  wanted to stop this bullshit
don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain
it's pissing me, & everyone off
You don't know what you done, Taylor
If, your friend from San Diego was up here, and thought for one out of two fucken seconds, she was a danger to him, he'da taken her out weeks ago
His cigarette is already stubbed and he's already walking away
Why don't you get yourself a dict- ionary
Look up the word "witness

Well, her, it ain't

big mistake Mister Taylor
Mister Berlin suddenly turns into Harrison Ford
slams into filing cabinets right next to the Christmas tree
Gets 's forearm under his throat and fucking lucky not to get the knuckles in his gut
Both men are heaving
No volume necessary in this room of paralyzed silence
'm gonna do something you never did, Taylor
'm gonna catch this bastard
And when  do, he's gon- na find out just how good a "wit- ness" she is
Meanwhile, you be aware of me - coz  wish you ill
moves away and the silence is brutal
Nothing happening but bad vibes
and  exchange glances, And this shit is really bad
vanishes into his lab and the door slams
86:
and his Dummy wearing a bra and his photographs and his rage are all alone
And that's how they wanna be
But the door opens and here is
Have to be a friend to survive in here
Nothing you gotta say do  wanna hear right now
So save yourself saying it
'm not in here to apologize, John
told you what was gonna happen & it's happened
"Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked
That's a tough one to swallow, Bro
'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion
You don't really believe this
One hundred fucking per cent
And you know why
Coz  never told her good-bye
Is that good enough for the "committee
" And as long as you like evaporates before  can speak again
Well
didn't know that
No
You didn't know that
is drinking whisky
Sticks another slug in the cup
Now realizes whose bottle this is
Slams it somewhere on the bench
Here
You left your booze in here
Who d'you think it was
Ross gets the kind of smile a smart guy wouldn't give an idiot
You think it was him
That's a very stupid question, Ross
'm asking it
How the hell do  know who
Some jerk-off
Some peeping-tom prick
His hand has found the switch-blade
nasty click as it opens
but definitely not him
This guy's in the trade
He's not gon- na stand there looking at her ass, if he's in the room, she's dead
puts the knife in his Dummy
If she's alive
She's dead
Ease off, John
'm sick of this toy town shit
Everything you say sounds reason- able
But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite
Don't give me that
Not another word
When you had the Fat Lady in there, and  asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said yes
So as far as  was concerned, she's ly- ing
And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different,  wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because you told me
This atmosphere would stretch any friendship to breaking point
And now 'm telling you
'm looking you right in the eyes and telling ya, there's a "bad man" out there, and don't know if he's in the next room, or the next state: and  don't know what his trigger is
But if he reads her name in the newspaper,  believe he'll be inclined to do something ab- out it
've got a bad feeling
And been doing this too long to be wrong
There are tough eyes to look into
And  finally looks away
dunno what  can do to help you
dunno what 'd do with your help
've gotta take her out of there
What about Citrine
Screw Citrine
He can fire me
87:
Wide over the countryside
The car is a long way off
pretty magic looking dawn
Cows on hills and mist in the hollows
The Mercedes finally arrives
Up the track and into the (refurbish- ed) garage
Engine off and little but a sound of singing birds
88:
'
sits on the sofa
She's a lousy liar and having a tough time with the phone "
my aunt called twice
well, soon, hope so
right now, 'm scared to be there
who
just a second
just a second
Goodridge wants the number
" She seeks decision from  who doesn't want him to have it
(Phone) Mr Goodridge
can't find it
No
there's no one here to read it right now
Well, yes,  know
of course  will
yes, promise
'll get it and call you tomorrow
And that's it except for "Goodbyes
" He takes the phone and re- places it
Her expression is a toss up between guilt & anxiety
feel really bad about it, coz they invited me for Christmas
Has he got your aunt's address
don't think so
He said the police had been calling
want- ed to ask me some more questions
Who
(She doesn't know) Probably Angelo
'll take care of it
Don't worry, we- 're gonna find this guy, and everything'll be
Only thing he fails to mention is which guy he's talking about
Anyway the subject is already changed
He notices tapes in her bag
"Would you like me to put your music on
" No, she doesn't want music
He's gonna light the fire and make them lunch
99:
'
is splitting logs and  is sitting an a step "watch- ing" him
She's looking almost happy with only worry in the way
You're looking worried again, Helena
No 'm not
You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"
Alright, 'm worried about Christmas
wish  hadn't told him 'd be back
log tangents off
retrieves it
Tosses it in a barrow
He'll get over it
'll roast us a chicken,
With cand- les around it
How about that
distant owl hoots
She knows he's smiling
She's smiling too
Wouldn't it be better if  cook it
You said, you can only boil
90:
The Music is Puccini
Part one/Act two/The Humming Chorus from Madam Butterfly
Giant close of the spinning cassette
The Cam- era remains close as it explores the room
Candle light & fire- light
Along a mantlepiece
Eleven thirty-five on a clock
Two Christmas cards
Several photographs from the happy years
One a picture of Ross & Berlin in uniform
Another features Berlin with his arm around a beautiful young lady with long dark hair
For a moment it could be Helena
But the Camera's already gone
cuddles knees in the corner of a sofa
Looks considerab- ly more relaxed
But there's a tension here and both are aware of it
Stifled yawns
She stares at him and  stares back
billion people in love have been through this
It's bed-time
[ suggestion of Berlin's bed to be is heaped in pillows/blank- ets at the end of the couch
] "Come on, 'll take you up there
" She finds his hand and stands
The Music follows them upstairs
91:
Moonlight through the windows
They are silhouettes
They want to embrace but in a situation like this a bedroom is the worst place to be
No sound except the Music
And what's anyone supp- osed to say
This atmosphere is about kissing and nothing more
Christ hear this Music
sweet pulse of Puccini
Big close of lips meeting in moonlight
Now in each other's arms
They kiss
And then they're kissing
And nothing else is happening in the whole fucking universe except a telephone just started to ring
Still ringing
Still kissing
Somebody has got to give in
The phone finally gets answered
The voice at the end isn't expect- ed
But  sounds pleased to hear it
It seems one problem got solved
" gotta tell you, Margie
You are Mrs Santa Claus
" 92:  /

'
Is Ross throwing a party or opening a bar
Crates of booze and stack upon stack of beer
bit of "where do you want it
" act- ing from  as he staggers in with a delivery of Bud makes room on a table
Rips a beer out the plastic and pops it
Can't thank you enough, Ross
Don't thank me
Thank Margie
Swallowing beer  exits the back door with  following
It's her invitation
And as far as Citrine in concerned, better we keep it like that
The wagon waits outside with a few crates left to unload, - heads for his Mercedes with  calling after him
"John
Here
" Pulls a six pack from his supplies and throws it across
There's an old desperado in one of the cells
Why don't you give him this, and tell him happy Christmas from me
93:
The Girls prepare for festivity
They got a full length mirror
wardrobe of dresses
menu of shoes, What they do with them in this scene is their affair
Right now 's holding some blue number in front of
"It's blue silk
You like blue
" Not "you" blue
This isn't you
She slings the dress on the bed
It joins a pile of rehearsals
Moves deeper into her dresses and  appears in the mirror
When did John divorce
Two or three years ago
What was she like
Suzanne
Very pretty
She was a semi- professional model
But a policeman's wife she wasn't
So one day, she just packed it and left
And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet
What does that mean
You know, he crashed
He just couldn't come to terms with it
John hates to lose, and he hated losing her
Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back
you just don't believe the amount he drank
She pirouettes with black sequins
"What do you think of black
" Evidently not much and  is getting short of alternatives
Wait a minute,  just had the most brilliant idea
You think he still loves her
Think he still thinks about her
But not like then
Then was an obsession
She emerges from the wardrobe with red satin high heeled shoes
Here
try these
if these fit, we got the perfect dress
haven't worn heels since  was 16
don't think  could walk in these
Sure you can
Anyway, parties are all about standing still
is excited to try them out
The experiment is a success
'll go get the dress
It's kinda sultry
only wore it once, coz in reality,  can't get away with it
You think John would like it
think John, would love it
94:
The Ross residence looks like an ad for &
Warm yellow light from the windows
Holly wreath on the front door
The Mercedes pulls up and  gets out with his bag and suit on a hanger
hard wind around the house
He walks inside without knocking
95:
The den looks like a little museum
Walls decorated with Civil War memorabilia
One wall occupied by a cabinet of modern guns
looks like Roy Rogers trying to look like Fred Astaire powder blue evening suit
Ho dumps ice in a barrel full of Bud- wieser and  produces a couple of presents
"This is from Helena
And this is from me
" The first obviously a music tape
holds it to his ear
"Sounds like Frank Sinatra
" And the second a bottle of (Ross tears the wrappings off) Chivas Regal
Let's do one of these right now, then we'll hide the sonovabitch
But he's already lost 's attention
walks in with Jesus what have you done to her
Bright red lipstick & jet black mascara and dress made of blood red sequins
Sexy it is but her it isn't
She looks like one of those big tit dopes from Tennessee
She also looks like 37 million dollars
Christ that smile works with paint
An appraisal comes from  "Wow
" 96:
The whole house is going around in a haze of booze and colored lights and laughter
Buddy Holly supplies the music "True Love Ways" and  is a victim of the nostalgia
Dances close with Among the kaleidoscope of passing couples are  & Eyes closed and oblivious of everything but each other
But someone is staring at them
About forty years old with big hands
Too old for acne but the skin is bad
Got a scar on his cheek like a ladder in a stocking
He continues to stare until the dancers separate
Music ends and he's already in the crowd
arrives with a whisper for  and next thing is on her arm heading for the stairs
Obviously a "ladies room" run
Everly Brothers next record up and  appears through the crush
Spots  who wants to know "What happened to you
" Duty Sergeant fucked up
can you believe it, 'm on tonight
"How long have you got
" "One big drink
" And they head for it
Did you get my message
No
left a message on your machine
It wasn't me calling
Sam around
This last question to  who delivers a typically large shot
Yeah
guess she's in the kit- chen
We got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey
Are you sure you didn't call
spoke to old whass-his-name a couple of times
But not to her, and  never asked for her
Her who
Someone's calling the institute to talk to Helena
Says he wants to ask her some more questions
Not guilty
And he pushes off to see his wife
looks around worried
You got a quiet phone somewhere
Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight
It may well have been the local cops
That's just what  wanna find out
97:
fixes 's lips
Big on the lipstick
Another layer of magenta is going on "Are you sure  look
" Her question interrupts the Revlon "You're the prettiest girl here by about two hundred per cent
"  moves in again for the lower lip
How you doing on those shoes
Don't mix very well with beer
Perhaps she is a tiny bit tipsy
smiles and says "Press
" Girl like you should be drinking chill white wine
Press
All done
knock on the door
"Come in" and  sticks his head inside
That woman in the kitchen says if she doesn't get help within 10 seconds, she's gonna resign
That woman is a disaster
She turns to the mirror in exasperation and mends her own face
Alright, tell her 'm coming
No, wait a minute, honey
Take Helena for me, and find John
And don't let go of her hand until you do
/
pause in the Music amplifies conversation
Bullshit and beer and everyone talking about nothing
leads  through the row
Can't find Berlin and now they're in the den
The ser- ious Guzzlers have made it base
Everyone talking and everyone lying but no Berlin and  is about to make a major mistake
'll just go see if he's in the kitchen
you stay right here
Her protest is absorbed in sound
And anyway he's already gone
At once she is vulnerable
Doesn't know if she's staring at the back of a head or straight into someone's face
"Didn't we meet somewhere
" The question comes from the man with the scar
He's drunk as a dog and already got a tattooed hand around her waist
Hey, Popeye
Hey, Fat Guy
Gimme 2 minutes
'm about to ask this lady for a dance
Trash aftershave and lousy breath and clearly the answer is no
If  told you 'd driven all the way from Oakland would you dance with me
Willy Nelson starts to sing
And  attempts to break away
What's so special about the other guy
You like cops, don't you
'm a cop
finds the top of a couch
Holds it like a raft of secur- ity
But where ever she goes this frightful mouth is following
let me ask you a question
How do you know the difference between one guy and another
Maybe you don't
Maybe you only know the "difference" when you're dancing
(he laughs) If you knew what  looked like, you'd dance with me
look like John Wayne
know what you look like
Excuse me
She navigates the back of the sofa
Collides with somebody and apologizes
"'m sorry
Is anyone sitting there
" Enough ambiv- alence in the question for the guy not to know she's blind
No
No one sitting there
Simultaneously a pair of middle-age crew cuts occupy the sofa
second later  sits bang into one of the laps
Spilt drinks and surprise all round
Pleasant sur- prise for the victim
He's a lecherous looking old bastard and Helena's dress rides up for a damned good view of the lingerie
Happy Christmas, Max
normally get socks
Every humiliation there is
However  gets out of this is however she achieves it
But by the time she does she's crying
99:
/
calm spot between kitchen & stairs
In the background Guests raid the kitchen for food
looks like he should be smok- ing a cigarette
At last  comes downstairs with the news
She wants to go back to the institute
already arrived
looks desolate
She can't go back
You better go talk to her
watches him walk upstairs
His eyes an assessment of this absurd relationship
"All sorts of people fall in love, Darlin
" know
ain't it a shame
100:
wedge of light as  walks in
Then moonlight again
- sits at the edge of a single bed
Hair a wreck and mascara streaks down her face
He sits identifying himself with an emb- race
Clears the hair from her eyes and kisses where the tears were
"It was an accident
everyone has accidents
" Whatever he said would be the wrong thing to say
Because he doesn't un- derstand
And her only explanation of this misery is new tears
can't walk in these shoes
Gently he reaches down and takes off her shoos "You don't have to dress like this for me
" And suddenly the mood is different
He is amongst her tears
Kissing her mouth
Already undressing her
Her dress glides up
Silk stockings
He unclips them
She feels his hands drift down her legs
Hears the zip opening her dress
She returns his desire and helps him with her brassiere
He kisses her breasts and by now the Camera's too close to see
101:
asleep in 's arms
Just the worry of the wind
He kisses her and slips out of bed and everything slams into - - 9 is fully dressed
Geared up for work
Black leather glo- ves and black leather jacket
Shoves the Beretta into his belt
From somewhere a very soft sound of Christmas carols drifts in
102:
/ /
This is deep past midnight, The house is quiet and gone to bed
Fallout from the party everywhere
Still that distant sound of carols
dumps his bag and walks into the den
Just dark- ness and the forgotten tape machine
Flips on a lamp and tries to open the gun cabinet
Still trying when startled by a voice
(
) You can't get in there
That's "Comanche Proof
" swings round in surprise
is half asleep on a sofa
Jesus
What are you doin
spose 'm drinking myself to sleep
It's Helena's Christmas songs
they're really pretty
"Silent Night
Holy Night" and about two inches of Chivas left
Have you got any Glasers
(Ross does) Twenty fives
sticks a foot on a table
Pulls a
25 Walther automatic from an ankle holster
Ejects the mag and clicks out the slugs
What exactly you doing, John
'm going up to the institute
Now
This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas
unlocks a cabinet and  is about to load the Glasers
checked with the locals and our station, no one's called
Whoever it is, isn't the police
think this bastard's getting worried ab- out something
and  think the- re's just a chance he'll turn up
Well, let's hope he does
selects a 12 gauge Winchester and rams the mechanism open
And if he does, 'm gonna drop a bomb on the fukker
Listen, you don't havta come
Hey
is stuffing solid lead "car killers" into the pump action
Watch my lips
'm your partner
103:
-
This is probably a crane shot
gale works up the valley
The institute is in total darkness
Not a vehicle out front
Not a sound except the marauding wind
Ross's Chevrolet is concealed amongst trees
Been here long enough to allow slow flurries to accumulate
It stares towards the building maybe 75 yards away
104:
wears a black wool hat
a big black overcoat
Both got shit frozen out of them
bottle available and anyone who wants a slug better help himself
Plus sleet on the windshield and a lot of stale time
asks what time it is
And takes a heave on the booze and waits for about a week to go by
Where's your watch
guess by the bed
It's twenty of three
Yawns do a circuit
flops in his seat and the angle chang- es
The view from the rear covers windscreen and back of heads
little young for you, Bro
(Gets his eyes) You think if she could see, she'd be hanging around with an old dog like you
You got a stomach growing around to meet itself behind your back
Bull shit
'm in my prime
Bits
What d'you mean, "bits
" star-light on the windshield
Distant and nobody seen it yet
Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates
Look at me
Gut in its fifties
Balls in their six- ties
And feet in their eighties
Hit those wipers, Ross
Urgency snaps him into close-up
Big noise as wipers clear the screen
" thought  saw a light
"  stares at the instit- ute through small binoculars
"There
Flashlight went right ac- ross those windows
" Instant excitement as the adrenalin pumps in
"Fourth floor
See it
He's fucken in there
" And suddenly everything including super-sinister Music is happening at once
105:
Pines singing as the gale tears into them
Clutching his Winch- ester  opens the trunk
dim light and a fluster of equip- ment
sorts out a pair of radios
Selects a channel and whispers "What are you on
" ("local Tac
") Here come huge 12 cell flashlights and the intense whispers continue
"Local
" What if we need a back up
We're not here
don't want the desk to hear us
it's channel 4 and copy
And they're already on their way
106:
The storm bullies its way around the building
Lights approach quickly
But one of them is already fading
It belongs to
This fucker's got about 5 minutes in it
And whatever the plan was it just got changed
looks around in apprehension - going in there alone ain't no joy - his flashlight ascends the fire escape
And there it is 2 floors up
half opened window
Alright
'll start at the top, and work down
You ain't going in alone
That's a liability, Ross don't want you hanging on to my shirt
Anyone but me comes down these stairs, take em out but try and keep him alive want this bastard living
Takes off up the stairs
watches him vanish
(Waiting out here ain't so tasty either
) The wind rages in nearby trees door slams repeatedly somewhere a long way away
[Ross
] "10/2" ['m going in
] Big on  and the radio
"You take care, Bro
" 107:
climbs through the window
Drops down and waits to orien- tate himself
He's on a small landing midway between flights of stairs
Different kinds of noises in here
One hundred per cent more sinister
"Ross
Ross
You hearing me
" [10/2]
"'m going upstairs
" Snaps the safety-catch on his Beretta
And it sounds ominous
Every shadow in this place is animated with foreboding
108:
/
Looking down the stairwell
The light comes up
arrives on another floor
Hard to sweat in here but he's doing it
His progress is distinctly cautious
harsh wind rockets down the stairs flapping a pair of owing doors
eases through in- to the corridor
At its far end is the elevator
He travels to- wards it in an eerie piston of light
[John
What's happening
] 109:
has moved into the shelter of a wall
Sleet passes almost horizontally
His flashlight is over
The color of a tangerine
[] ['m on Helena's floor
'm just gonna take a look at her apartment
You
] Fucken flashlight's kaput
[Door's locked
shit] What's happen- ing, Brother
[ can hear some- thing
Something upstairs
] 110:
NlGHT
stares up at the coiling " can hear footsteps
right up above
" They disappear into the gale
Doors beat at the end of the corridor
He moves towards them and pushes out onto the stairway
Nothing but the wind
He's about to climb when an al- arming voice shocks him rigid
"
" is already running
Light swinging wildly as he sprints back up the corridor
Fifteen yards to elevator/stairs
Breath- less as hell he hits the radio
"Fucker's in the elevator
" Al- most jumps stairs in haste
Bursts out onto the 3rd floor
Ham- mer back on the Beretta
Just in time to see the doors closing
"Get ready, Ross
He maybe coming down
" But he isn't
He's go- ing up
By the time he's recovered breath the Voice is back in business
Whoever rides the elevator is now on the fifth floor
111:
Totally breathless now
Eyes ascend faster than feet
Whine of a swinging door
rounds the stairwell
The door's still busy
Top of the building here and the ceilings are closing in
'
as he heads for that door
Closer
Three steps to go
Closer
Two steps more
One step
Reaches for it
Whamm
The door smashes into him like it hates him
So fast it hardly happened
He staggers back
His flashlight clatters downstairs
Banisters capsize as the light passes
Every shadow goes crazy
The flashlight arrives at a lower level
Rolls away and stops
Wastes power into a corner
Can't see Berlin and can't see his radio
But Ross cuts into the silence with increasing disquiet
[John
John
Are you al- right
Come in, John
] 112:
/
savaged by the gale
In considerable anxiety
Less than a volt in his batteries
His failure to contact Berlin accelerat- es his concern by the moment
Calls repeatedly "You hearing me
" Big close on the radio
Fingers switch channels
Tries calling on five/six
Still nothing and goes to channel eight
"Come in, John
" Alright fuck it
Light or no light
He's going up there
Still calling he barges at the wind making for the fire escape
[You hear me
Just be care- ful now, coz 'm coming up] Stares up into the gloom of the iron stairs
Hardly got a foot on the first before a Figure rushes down
Dressed in black and very breathless
powerful flashlight floods on dazzling
Is that you, John
Ans- wer
Or  blow this fucken staircase to pieces
[
] Me, Freddy
Thank Jesus the anxiety's over
The 12 gauge drops to his side
What the hell's going on up there, Brother
been calling 10 minutes
The light remains steady and blinding and straight in his face
Hey, c'mon, John
Talk to me
Just the sound of breathlessness
Plus a
25 Walther automatic
Jesus Christ
What are you doing
It glints at the peripheries of his vision and  is alarmed
What the fuck are you doing
- It's me - Holy shit
- John - John - Not you - Don't shoot you crazy bastard
Two deathly flashes in quick succession
The first practically taken Ross's hand off
The second slams into his guts and he's down
The Glaser is unequalled in ferocity by any other bullet
113:
( )
The   looks down
Five floors below a man lays on his back
His shotgun discharges uselessly into trees
Another man leans over him
Illuminates his agonized face with a flash- light
Shoots him again point-blank in the upper body
The - isn't staying for more
Hurries back along the fire escape
114:
Wind breaks on the roof like waves
An utterly dismal room lit by a starving light bulb
The  arrives from the fire esc- ape
Huge eyes behind those orb-like glasses
Picks up a phone and dials
Piles and piles of old newspapers
Hundreds of fuck magazines
In the kitchen section a mass of photographic equip- ment includes an enlarger on the table a flash camera
On the wall behind him a collage of snaps of half dressed girls
Plus a special enlargement of Helena standing naked in her bathroom
Gimme the police
Quickly
115:
Close on a bulb in a flashlight
The merest glimmer of energy
Barely the light to see the blood
It seeps into a long-frozen footprint in the ice
Fills it fast and expands over the sides
Somebody say this can't be happening
crumples to knees in the snow
Dumps his light gasping for breath
Oblique light creating desperate silhouettes
howls like a dog
Howls into his radio
"Nine - Nine - Nine
" Blood all over his hands
"This is a Nine - Nine - Nine - officer down
"  is heaving like an old bull elephant
On the verge of unconsciousness
He tries to speak
Got hit in the throat
fights off tears
"Don't talk old man
" Repeats the emergency code but this time he can't be heard
Almost imperceptibly a Carol filters in (In The Bleak Mid Winter) and the Camera moves slowly away cradles 's tragic head and the song drowns the raging wind
This beautiful Christmas carol will articulate rhythm of these cuts
And there will be no other sound until the sequence ends
116:
blue emergency light
Revolving in slow motion
Like a dream
The city streets are a blur
The light accelerates into sudden reality
Ambulance plus police convoy speed to a city hospital
117:
Close-up of  kissing her husband's lips for the last time
Tears spill down his cheeks from her eyes
is dead
118:
Outside in the corridor
Looking in at
He sits head in hands on a bench
This is somebody's point of view
The camera travels up the windows
Waits at a distance as  arrives
Pajamas under his clothes
He walks with assistance of a stick
Neither say anything because both know what this is about
- stands and hands over his badge
Exits the mag and now his Beretta
brief word from  and he turns and walks away
119:
'
little house in winter meadows
Kind of pretty now it's pain- ted
Just the first tint of pink on its roof
The Carol dissol- ves into birdsong
Here comes the sun for a fine Christmas day
120:
All new paint and all new things in expectation of happy times
barbecue still in polythene wraps
Price tag and unconnected gas pipe shift gently in the breeze
brand now swinging seat
sits in it with shock wearing on
Expressionless of sor- row
Though he suffers every sorrow and guilt and regret there is
Sunlight reaches the veranda and colors the end of it red
silent and motionless he watches the lousiest dawn of his life
121:  /
Lights glow on the Christmas tree
Unopened presents still und- erneath
sits smoking in silence
Listens to a sound of plates getting stacked in another room
He looks up but not in surprise
He just wasn't aware  had arrived in the house
Where's Margie
Stunned and stubbled and full of grief
And that's just
Taken Bobby to her sister's
This atmosphere is unbearable and even these whispers seem laud
They were going there anyway
Does he know
shakes his head
Loses his cigarette
And  appears
Thinks his dad's in hospital
is 30 and pretty
She continues collecting plates
Why'd you go up there, John
Knows he's not going to get a reply and doesn't bother to wait for it
materializes from the den like a shadow
Sallow for want of sleep and glad to have 's hand to hang on to
want you to go to your Aunt's
suggestion that surprises
And clearly doesn't appeal
Why can't  stay with you
It's not possible right now
Why
Please don't ask no quest- ions now
Not right now
If silence can intensify it's now
Sound of the front door and then footsteps
freezes as  appears
Wracked with grief
Dead sickness of tears
Like she cried bones out of her face
But no weeping now
Maybe shock
Maybe brave
Maybe both
Is that Margie
'm here, honey
'm right here
The strongest face in the house
And now  is in her arms
Don't cry darlin
he was a big old cop and he didn't like tears
Dead echos of plates in the kitchen
And song of birds outside
Feels like every second in my life, was just the moment leading to this
Margie
Don't
Raises her hand to silence him and this is silence Margie owns
Don't
Christ this is just awful
crying and  on the way
What's gonna happen now, John
She has an aunt, in Vermont
'll take her there tonight
'm going back to the institute
No
not now
Helena can stay here if she'd like to
'd like her to
'll look after her
and she can look after me
'm tired now
must sleep
Footsteps again as she walks out and silence again like before

The Camera will slowly crane down on
Fully dressed but wiped out he lays an the bad
Last thing he needs is booze
He is clearly full of it
Drifting in and out of consciousness nightmare either side of the line
He relives that night again
And Ross is alive again as guilt and regret demand to be heard
() You want me to make a predict- ion
This guy ain't turning up
() Maybe not
What time is it
() Twenty-six minutes past two
() You shouldn't have come, Ross
() Don't worry
You take your time

Head in hands
Wants the pain to go aw- ay
But anguish is stronger than alcohol

The Mercedes descends onto a low-loader courtesy of a car lift- ing truck

Close on a pair of dancing needles
They react to voice-levels on a twin spool tape recorder
But no sound of yakking in here
St Anne's  sucks a pencil
Busy with a cross-word puz- zle

It moves away to discover head phones
And moves closer to hear St

change of chairs
wood chair for the subject
Mobile chair for the man
Castors give him considerable freedom
Enable him to back off or move in with the intimacy of an ophthalmologist
St You fish, John
have done
side table features several pin sharp pencils
Sony pocket recorder
Two packets of Pall Mall reds
Two yellow legal pads
The chair moves into reverse and he breaks a puke colored file
St Alright, let's not beat about the bush, what ever that may mean, and get down on it
You were specific- ally instructed by your chief, not to go anywhere near the blind inst- itute
So why did you go up there
Because of a feeling
had a bad feeling this man was gonna turn up
St Which man is that
The man  detail in my report, Sir
The report that's in his hands
(St Anne knows well which man
) Is this an interview, or an interrogation
St It's an enquiry
'm not prepared to be interrog- ated
'll be interviewed as an officer, who may be expected to cooperate with the investigator
St Well, that's fine by me, John
And 'm sure that's fine by your Chief
He smiles the non-smile
Tosses his pencil down
And sits back
So you thought your man might show
Yes
St Bit of a long-shot, wasn't it
It was the only shot  had
St So the one night you decide to go up there, he goes up there
That's right
Except 'd decid- ed to go up there every night
St Despite the wishes of your Chief
Yes
St You were prepared to fal- sify your reports to him
had very good reasons for do
St Just a second, John
knew there was something missing
St  cuts him off to pick up the phone
Obviously something vital is needed
"Could you bring an an ashtray in here
Got a coupla guys who smoke in here
" And attention back to the file
You don't mind if  jump around a little this morning, do you
Just while 'm easing my way into this
You're asking the questions, Sir
St You had an argument with Ross
Ass- aulted one of the officers, right
wouldn't use the word "assault
" St You got a "racy temper," Sergeant
Not especially
St Just something they did, on this occasion, made you lose your rag
Not they
He
Taylor put a piece in the newspaper, which in my op- inion put my witness in jeopardy
St From whom
From the man  detail in my rep- ort
crazy man, who to my cert- ain knowledge has killed at least eight girls
Six in San Diego, one someplace else, and one up here
St Not a lotta support for that "scenario" though, is there
Not a lot
St Not even from Ross
No
St Is that why you lost your temper with him
Frustration
No one believing you
His  brings the ashtray
And St  smiles gratitude
So what can you tell me about you man
What do you mean, Sir
St mean, who is he
don't know who he is
Who's "Jack The Ripper
" He's Jack The Ripper with an automobile
St You didn't run a profile
No, Sir
didn't have the res- ources, and it isn't my expertise
St This crazy man
What makes you think he wants to eliminate Miss Robertson
You read my report, Sir
St 'm asking a question
Because he reads 'm investigating the disappearance of her friend, & Miss Robertson becomes the focus of his anxiety
How good of a "witness" is she
He's crazy, but not stupid, he's intelligent
Got a flexible
, and he doesn't wanna get caught
St Just like "Jack The Ripper
" This is meant to humiliate and meant to annoy and it does both
Alright, we'll have plenty of time to discuss your "Mystery Man," and his "flexibility" later, Right now, 'd like to talk about the "event

Immediately you get up
128:
realized the flashlight was at the bottom of the stairs St Did you check your weapon
Maybe
It would have been instinctive
All  know was was in possession of it
St You didn't check it
Not that  specifically remember
St Why not
don't know
wasn't think- ing about it
was dazed
St You were woozy
Confused
was unconscious 10 seconds ago
St understand
Then
Then  picked up the flashlight, tried to get Ross on the radio
Nothing
Static
got blood on my hand, realized my eye was cut
St Could you see out of it
Yeah,  could see
Then  ran
Climbed out of the window, ran down the fire escape, and right at the bottom,  found Ross
St Were you breathless
Sure  was breathless
St When did you realize you were no longer in possession of the
25
Not until  was in the hospital
St You figure you lost it in the hospital
Or on the way there
No,  thought it must have fallen down the stairwell
St  [] Like the flashlight
[Yeah] Had you been drinking that night
It was Christmas Eve
St That wasn't my question
Yes
St  [] How about Ross
[Sure] Were you drinking in the car
[
] There was a bottle in the car
think Ross had a mouthful
St But not you
may have had a nip
St To keep out the cold
Very cold that night, very windy, wasn't it
St  motors off & refers to notes without looking at
Which hand was the flashlight in
My left hand
St And the Walther was in your right
The Beretta was in my right hand
St You said you didn't check it
So how d'you know which gun you're holding
The chair moves back in and its pilot has an icicle up his ass
You said you figured it had fallen down the stairs with the flashlight
You said you were confused
You pick up the flashlight in confusion, how d'you know you didn't pick up the 25
Let's not start playing games, Mr St Anne
St Games
told you, 'd lost the Walther
St You told me you didn't know you'd lost it until you were in the hos- pital
So, if you didn't know till then, it coulda been either weapon
The gun in my hand was a Beretta
And for the record,  want that note corrected
Now, please, Sir
The dead smile and rubber in action
St  changes his notes
St 'm corrected
'm sorry,  made a mistake
With respect, Sir, you didn't make a mistake
know who you are, and you're far too experienced for mis- takes
Now if you have doubts over the content, or veracity of my rep- ort,  wanna be made aware of them
St Sure
wanna be made aware of them now
St Do you want a lawyer, Sergeant
There you go again
"Do  want a lawyer, Sergeant
" It's a game question
What do  want a law- yer for
got nothing to hide
St You don't
You know  don't
So let's quit the bullshit and get down to it
What's your "angle," Mr St Anne
For the first time St  moves his chair into 's space
St Where's the little gun, Sergeant
've no idea
St You don't
If it isn't in the institute, the man who shot Ross took it
St The man who shot Ross, used it
Implications are ganging up quicker than  can focus them
And you don't know where that little twenty-five calibre Walther's gone
confirms it
Looking very concerned
The wheels retreat
St  shakes out a cigarette and takes his time with matches
Sergeant, here it is
intend to produce evidence, that will prove you shot Frederick Ross with malice afore- thought
My angle therefore, is to pre- pare a case on behalf of your Chief, to prosecute you for first degree murder
129:
The lights on the Christmas tree are off
That just about sums it up
The word's out and it talks in barren silence as appears
and  in conference at a desk
The former looks
The latter turns away
walks the room into close- up

" Seems like  is the only benev- olent face around
She gets a lost smile & bewildered shake of his head
Disappears into his room And quietly closes the door

picture of Ross fills the frame
Snapped the day they search- ed the dump
Blasted with rain
waterproof cape and a finger raised in defiance
shifts eyes from the bulletin board
Pours a last inch of whisky and drinks
Eyes back to the board for a last photographic/panoramic record of his time in Eureka
The photo of Ross again before his eyes sweep quickly on

Two dead dogs on a refuse dump
And now the dead face of a Dummy
stares till someone knocks on the door
St  comes in smoking a cigarette and eating a ham sandwich
St You go home, John, get some sleep
don't wanna talk any more today
Aren't you gonna arrest me
St You know better than that
He will exit when he stops speaking
Before he does he wanders the lab showing particular interest in the Dummy of Jennifer 8
arrest you, you'll get bail, and be walking outta here anyway - and 'll have no one to talk to - Your Chief said he'd make you available to me
If you go to the store, call in, and let your duty officer know

gale of tears
Fits his words between them
His Mom does her best to cope with his grief and her own

Why did she have to come here

Fingers search out and identify phone numbers
Dial for inform- ation and  whispers " need the number for a cab, please

The Camera's getting closer and so is St
And today there is a definite change of mood
Still very measured
Still a pro- fessional demeanor
But a bad sense of shit about to come down
St there was a gale that night
all the doors are swinging
so this door swings back and clips you
and down you go
within 35 seconds of uncon- sciousness, you're back on the fire es- cape, and you're confused, really con- fused
you don't know if Tuesdays come in two's or happen once a week
Bit of a cold coming on and near enough for  to catch it
You see a figure coming up the stairs
Ross ain't meant to be on the stairs
He challenges you
and this ain't a piece of wood with a nail through it
this guy's got a 12 gauge Winchester up your nose
and he's drunk
and you're dizzy
and your eye's fulla blood
you ain't thinking good, and you're seeing worse
Wow
it just went off
You just put him down
and you get hit by a Glaser, you stay down
But he ain't dead
Now, you realize you shot your partner
"Oh, Suzanna, how do  get outta this
" know
The "Serial Killer" shot him
And here comes the malice, John
17 seconds later, you put another one in his throat
Isn't that what happened
No
St Tell us what happened, then
already told you what happened
You're looking for an inconsisten- cy, and you're not gonna find one, because 'm telling you the truth
St Tell me the truth again

yellow cab splashes through puddles and pulls up in front of the house
gets out and pays
No she doesn't need assis- tance
Picks up her suitcase and the cab vanishes into drizzle

'
Back door opens and  walks in
First thing she senses is cold
This place smells like it hasn't been lived in since she was last here
And last time she was here she was happy
Dumps her case and heads for the living room
Can't see it but feels the overwhelming gloom
Finds a couch and now she sits to wait
The silence is almost total
But something disturbs it looks around
Back on her feet she tries to discover source of the sound
Finally arrives at a table lamp
She feels the bulb and it's hot
large moth beats itself crazy inside the shade
Reaches in and turns it off & the house is in virtual darkness
136:
St  lights a cigarette
Attention with his notes
Sniffing a fair bit
He's acquired a toilet roll to deal with it
Occas- ionally will tear a sheet or two off to blow his nose
Glances at  "You want a cigarette
" No he doesn't "'ve given up
" St You have
How about the booze
How does St  know
Perhaps he doesn't
Sounds like he does
Too much booze can be very dangerous
memory black outs
stuff like that
His attention still with notes like a quack about to prescribe
"The Man Takes a Drink, Then the Drink Takes a Drink, Then the Drink Takes the Man
"
Something like that, isn't it
Anyway
why did you give up
guess  was drinking too much
St was talking about "cigarettes
" (Score: 10 outta 10) Find yourself getting breathless
Sure
St Specially if you're running
Which floor did the elevator run up to
Five
St You ran up to the fifth
You must have been real breathless by then
doesn't know where this is going but he doesn't like it
Eyes to  now and his smile looks real for the first time
We're gonna get our "observer" in here this afternoon
Keep an eye on us
(He smiles) Notorious for withholding information, the
St  makes a note
Junks the pencil
Sits back in his chair
Were you aware there was a janit- or in the institute that night
No
St You didn't check
There wasn't time
St That wasn't my question
No, Sir,  didn't check
St  breaks off to blow his nose
looks very worried
St 'm really catching cold up here
Must be all this fog
What's the relevance of the janitor
St The janitor
Let me just ask you a question - before  forget - do you take any medication for that
For what
St Breathlessness
No
St Alright, let me answer your question
"What's the relevance of the janitor
" Hits the cigarette like this is the one that caused the cancer
Why don't  take you through it, from where 'm sitting
At some time bet- ween 2 & 2:30 a
m
the janitor thought he heard a vehicle approaching through the woods
He looks out, and sees noth- ing, no lights, nothing
Figures it must be hunters
Some time later, he thought he heard something else, like a door, or a window slam
He gets up, and between half past two and a quarter of three, he makes a search - with a flashlight - of the top 3 floors
Finds nothing untoward, & goes back to his apartment in the roof
looks grey as sick
Knows what's coming
And here it is
The flashlight you saw, was his
The "footsteps" you heard, were his
The elevator you were chasing up and down after was empty, and is prone to such activity, due to an electrical fault
Apparently it happens frequently dur- ing gales
The gale that was swinging the door
That knocked you down
That confused you so much
And here we are, back to where 'm sitting
You wanna tell me what really went on that night
It seems St  has effectively destroyed the "Serial Killer" scenario
Stubs his cigarette and waits for 's response
Two people know  didn't kill him, Mr St Anne
One's me, and the other's the man that did
St What man
St  is winning
And they both know it
And he almost grins
We just dealt with "the man
" How d'you know the Jan- itor didn't shoot him
If St  can raise an eyebrow he does
By implication  is ditching his "Killer
" During this St  rewinds his Sony
You're telling me it's his flashlight  saw,
, he sees my flashlight
And 'm coming up the stairs with a Beretta in my hand
And he's frightened
He hits the door on me
Picks up my gun
He's running
He runs into Ross, and in panic, he shoots him
The little Sony snaps to a stop and St  looks at his watch
St Not unless he had a gun in one hand, and a phone in the other, he didn't
Ross was shot at ex- actly two fifty-seven a
m
The janitor put a call through to the local police, at 2:57 a
m
You obviously realize how  can get so accurate with my timing
St  backs off and carefully replaces the Sony on the table
Ross switched into channel 8, & we got a recording of the whole incident
was gonna play it to you, but  got a meeting, we'll have to do it after lunch
It's one, let's make it back by three

is curled up under blankets
Maybe day-dreaming but not asleep
She's maybe here to keep warm as much as anything else
Sound of a vehicle approaching and she sits to listen
The car pulls up and its engine silences
is already out of bed
138:
//
Silhouette of a figure outside the front door
Someone rattles the handle but it's locked
And by the time  reaches the door the visitor has gone
Thinking it's Berlin she twists the key and steps onto the porch
stale winter fog settling down
Hardly a sound except her own voice
"John
Is that you
" Just the rattle of local Crows and a Bull heaving somewhere in some distant field
"John
" She cautiously descends wood stairs and walks two or three paces before bumping into a brown Chevrolet
Exploration of the car establishes nil
More confused than con- cerned she listens
Country sound and not a sound out of place Then suddenly she is alert
Something clatters somewhere
Like cans kicked in the garage
Was it the garage
"John, is it you
" 139:

locks the front door
Moves into the kitchen
Locks the back door
Glum silence in the house
Nothing but an old alarm clock ticking
Then a sound like something moving
Like a door creaking open
Was it in the garage
The living room
Upstairs
She returns to the living room
Curtains drawn and almost dark
The endless silence is interrupted by a rush of water in pipes
If anybody's here they're upstairs
moves to the bottom of them "John, are you up there
It's me, darling
got a cab
" The only reply is more silence
She begins to climb the stairs
One hand on the wall
She ascends slowly
Her helplessness giv- ing way to suspicion with each new step
At the top she pushes into the bedroom "John, are you here
Darling
Are you alright
" Apparently no one is here
Certainly no one in the bed
And no one in the bathroom
She reappears with an expression suppress- ing anxiety
Feels her way past an antique wardrobe
Curiously its door is open
full length mirror inside
Shuts it as she passes and for a split-instant the Man in the room is revealed
Almost simultaneously fingers in black leather clasp her wrist
in speechless with shock
Both she and the  are breathing hard
The only other sound is the wardrobe door whin- ing open again under its weight
Manifests a reflection of his back
Totally in black
Black wool hat
Leather jacket
Gloves
Got really fucken lucky, didn't ya
He backs her to the bed and sits her before releasing his grip
The frame remains static and staring into the mirror and still on the 's back
stares unseeing at her own face
was getting kinda concerned about you Jenny
Like, how blind are you
Blind as your friend
Or less blind
Coz she could see, you know
Had a view outta one of em
But you don't see nothing do you
Nothing at all
He reaches into his jeans and produces a stainless steel knife
Even closed this thing is 10 inches long
leather loop attat- ched at one and
He teases the metal in front of 's eyes
Can you see this, blind girl
Not a switch-blade but by snapping it like a whip it locks out
Gimme your hand
Too terrified to obey and her inability momentarily angers him
Gimme your fucken hand
lifts her hand and he takes it
He runs the edge of the blade over her palm
Then closes her fingers around the handle
You like it
She is paralyzed except for the tears spilling down her cheeks
cut your friend's head off with that
Words come out she can barely hear herself
"You are a coward
" You say something, Jenny
In this terrible silence she hears a double hiss of an aerosol
'd like to cut you
'd like to cut you so bad
But ain't life strange
You're my little buddy now
guess we all got lucky

Fog and dusk in that order
Headlights descend the slope
Park and  plus cane get out
As he crosses the lot a Uniform fires up a Harley
Next face is  heading for his car
He accosts the Chief with a piece of paper
It is read with escal- ating incredulity
This would be comic if it wasn't so serious
She's in love with him, Chief, and try anything
Are you going up there
No,  just sent Travis
've got a call to make
What about the man
Has he seen this
[No he hasn't]
Alright, make your call, and get up there
Bullshit or not,  wanna proper statement

And  looks over unhappy

He don't wanna do it either
'll toss a coin for you
But one of you is going in today

shoves him the mess~ age

single light in a downstairs room
The house is stifled with fog
brown police Chevy parked out front
Here comes another to join it
As  gets out  appears on the porch
He descends stairs with the impartial expression of a working cop
need a friend, Angelo
keeps it dispassionate
Ignores 's desperate eyes
You got one
Puts a thumb towards the house and already heading for his oar
She's a bad witness, John
But a fucking lousy alibi
143:
This isn't a good place to be
dismal lamp supplies light close-up Of  on the sofa
Hears a sound of booze getting poured
But nothing else in the house except for a harsh voice
(
) know why you did it darlin, but you're not helping me
Every- thing they're hearing they think is a lie
Now here comes the man 'm desperate to prove exists, & whadda-ya-know, he turns up at my house, and has a "chat" with you
By now  and his glass of anaesthetic are well into frame
No one in the State of California is gonna believe that
They got the man in there - an /1
inter- rogator, and he's taking me to pie- ces - doesn't believe a word comes outta my head - not a word - no one believes me -  don't believe me
Don't say that
Don't you dare say that
believe you
know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand
Then explain it to me
got enough darkness, don't
He doesn't want to
But now he's got to
And so here it comes
The man who killed Amber is a psychopath
He was up at the in- stitute to kill you - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to kill you - that's the truth - and  didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason want you to stay at Margie's - coz  can't protect you here
Why does he want to kill me
Coz he thinks you're a witness
can't identify him
He don't know that
didn't
Then why didn't he kill me
Back at the booze and he's almost inaudible "Stop it, will you
" Why didn't he kill me, John
Something snaps in  and he throws his glass at the grate
Will you fucken stop it
'm not Serato
He didn't kill you coz he wasn't here
he isn't in the room with you, and lets you live
And just as suddenly he's full of remorse
Takes  in his arms with a lot of sorrys
But she isn't interested in apology
There's a passion in her face
And fire even in her blind eyes
Kiss me, John
Kiss me [he does] love you, kiss me again [he does] love you
Are my lips lying to you
Kiss my mouth [he does] Is my mouth lying to you
He
Was
Here

Music slams in on the cut
Berlin is about to take this garage to pieces
He searches cans and boxes and stacked timber
What ever it is his eyes are looking
The Camera looks down from ab- ove
Bits & pieces all over the floor but he discovers nothing

/
Close on a hand searching underside of the bath
Pipes and cob- webs
He reaches toward the taps
His hand is literally inches from the Walther (taped to the end of the tub)
Fingers almost touch it
Just a fingernail away when  interrupts "John
" (
) just remembered something
And  rolls out and stares up like a mechanic under a car
He used a breath freshener
"breath freshener
" stands in the doorway and  is already on his feet
heard it hiss, twice
wipes a thought through his hair with fingers
" don't know what that means

Everything taken apart
Every drawer open and the bed heaped with clothes
he's either here to take something
or leave some- thing

Looks totally snuffed out
He and  sit on the same sofa but the atmosphere puts them a mile apart
yellow pad on the table covered in notes swallows scotch and reads to himself " guess we all got lucky

Another mouthful of scotch & she hears the glass hit the table
He's glad you're drinking

In front of a bunch of secret- aries
Well, that would piss any- one off
That would piss me off
'd be real mad if a guy did that to me, & called himself a friend
Coz that ain't a friendly thing to do
You side with "friends"
You don't go bitchin on them behind their back
And he suddenly switches gear
And whispers like it's a secret
He wasn't much of a "friend" at all
Ross was my best friend
St Did you shoot your "best friend
" No
St The next time  ask you that quest- ion, you're gonna tell me the truth
St  shunts back in his chair
Expands the frame as he goes
Sergeant  sits on a chair with his back to the wall
Cig- arettes and ashtray on the table next to his
St  lights a Pall Mall and as if it's an after-thought he snaps the Sony on
[] "Just be careful now, coz 'm coming up
"
[Footsteps on cast iron stairs] "Is that you, John
Answer
Now
or  blow this fucken staircase to pie- ces
" [Sound of someone breathing hard] already looks devastated
He's about to got annihilated
"Me, Freddy
"
[Just the gale] "What the hell's going on up there, Brother
been calling ton minutes
"
[Lungs heave for air) "Hey, c'mon, John, talk to me
" [Just the sound of breathless- ness] "Jesus Christ
What are you do- ing
What the fuck are you doing
It's me - Holy shit - John - John - Not you - Don't shoot you crazy bastard
[2 shots] St  clicks the Sony off &  is too stunned to breathe
St That's second degree - you wanna stop at that
Will you give me that, John
gives him nothing but silence
knock on the door "Come in
" And the  hands St  a note
Reads it and excus- es himself
Leaves the silence for
But  breaks it
He's offerin you a deal
Why don't you take it
He ain't offerin me shit
lights a cigarette and exhales
Something of a real red- headed fuck about him
And  would like to break his neck
You're letting it show, King Jay
don't like you
But don't kid yourself
don't take no ple- asure sitting in on another cop
He rolls ash off his cigarette and pushes it round the ashtray
Your an alcoholic, aren't you
( stares) It's written in your file
The phone rings and  answers
Puts his red eyes at
They want you to look in the mirror
has to find every strength for this one
Humiliation com- pounds
Gets up and stares at his own haunted face in the glass
148:
/
The  peers into 's face
St  stands close with his toilet roll
Light refracts in the 's lenses " seen him up there quite a lot
" St  blows his nose "Is that the man you saw that night
" He stares again at the tormented face
Well
dunno
it could be
St Alright, thank you, Mr Dawson
He's escorted to the door and his space is occupied by
What's all this "deal" business
St  on his way to the door now
He pauses for the question
St can have him out of here on a sec- ond degree this afternoon
own him, and he knows it
And, Chief, 'm still waiting for that warrant on his house
149:
waits on a bench in the empty room
Maybe a few scruffy magazines
But nothing of use to her in here except she's near Berlin
He arrives like every hope got abandoned and sits next to her
They clasp one another's hands before she embraces him
You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart
wanna be near you
Something difficult to tell her and doesn't know how to say it
think they're gonna arrest me
don't want them to arrest you
It's not as bad as it sounds
They can't refuse me bail
Raise bail of my own cognizance & find the best damned lawyer there is
Her tears are close to his face
No one but him could hear her
Oh, John, 'd do anything, anything, to get you free
150:
If the waiting room felt bad try sitting in here
Both St and  are smoking and the Sony playing again
This is the final part of the tape
No speech but a lot of labored breath- ing
Ross groaning and now the sound of his shotgun
More desp- erate inhalations and now sound of the last shot into his neck
St and that one's with malice
that one's first degree
why don't you stop lying to me
(Clicks Sony off) 'mon, John,  can help you
Why don't you tell me the truth
've told you the truth
It isn't me
've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life
've heard you call him Freddy
You haven't
And you got no voice in here, Taylor, so keep it shut
St Tell a lotta lies, don't you
Some- thing that comes naturally to you
don't lie
St Prepared to lie to your Chief
Under exceptional circumstances
St What were the circumstances that caused you to lie to Freddy Ross
never lied to Ross
St You didn't
Shakes his head in confirmation
And St  finds a notebook
Well, he thought you did
Wrote it down in his book
"John Berlin is a liar
" Right here, underlined
stares at the book & can barely credit what he's seeing
Dated the day you got your first "break" with your "Mystery Man
" You don't know why he wrote that
(He doesn't) Maybe he thought there was no "Myst- ery Man
" That the investigation was bullshit
That you were making it up
And during the next attack St  will work himself into rage
Coz you wanted to be "Top Cop
" Isn't that why you went running up that gar- bage dump, so everyone could stand in awe of the "Top Cop
" Isn't that why you came up here
Coz you couldn't make it in
Get yourself a pissy lit- tle degree, come up here, and be "Top Guy
" But Ross was "Top Guy", wasn't he
Always would be Top Guy
And you know what
He did it without even trying
Everybody loved him
He had everything you wanted, didn't he
- Great woman - Great kid
- Everything you couldn't have
- And you wanted it to go away
Coz your life was lousy, wasn't it
- lousy life, with a lousy wife, who was fucking everyone, wasn't she
Is that why you pick on a little Blind Girl
- coz you can control her
- Is that it
- Control who she's fucking
Tears of grief and tears of rage
can't restrain either
You wanna lose your temper with me
'mon, John, lose your fucken temper
You're good at losing your temper
No way, Mr St Anne
St Lost your temper with Ross, didn't you
'mon, tell me the truth
Is that what happened
You had an arg- ument in the car
Lost your temper with him
Stood over him, blew his fucking larynx out with a Glaser
- Where were you aiming, John
Going for his face
Blow his fucking face away, because you hated him so much
is a wreck of despair
But somehow he keeps his dignity
loved that guy
& the hard- est thing to take in here
is knowing he thought  killed him
St Well, that he did
And that do , Sergeant Berlin
And at last he looks pleased
Because he's got this man busted
What do you take for that breathlessness, Sergeant
Can't take anymore questions
Answers with a shake of his head
How about Aminophylline
don't know what that is
St You don't
It's ant anti-asthma medic- ation, prescribed for breathlessness
Produces a capsule in a plastic bag and throws it on the table
Came out of the ashtray of your car
Every cell in 's body freezes
Misinterpreted by St
But you "don't know" what it is
But he does know what it is
The pill he found in the
van
You don't know how it got there
stares a rock drill and St  stares something similar
You don't use it for breathlessness
focuses a fragment of hope
But no sign of hope in here
'm running outta questions, John, and you're running out of lies
'm offer- ing you one last chance, and you better take it, or the
Attorney is gonna put you in the God-damned gas chamber
need
some time
to think Sir
St Alright
Think about it
But don't you make a fool of me
You come in here with one more lie, and  bull- shit you not, 'm gonna press for the maximum penalty there is
And that's the death penalty, Sergeant
151:
hurries in and grabs 's hand
Instantly transmits the adrenalin
They head for the door with him whispering hard
We got a break - isn't much, but it's a break
the man that murdered Ross gets asthma - it's not a breath fresh- ner, darling - it's an asthma inhaler
152:
/ couldn't have been in the house longer than it's taken to call Los Angeles
infected with the excitement although as yet she hardly knows what's going on
paces the tiles on a long phone lead
Eyes to  while they wait
This capsule came out of a
van - didn't even think about it - stuck it in the ashtray - if 'd been smok- ing, ita been thrown away weeks ago
(Phone) No, Amanda - it's definitely Amanda
Another excruciating wait plus further explanations for

(Phone) - Dan - Hearing - Are you sure
- Would you try Frisco for me
- 'll try and get a second name
Dumps the phone and stokes anxiety in  and 's eyes
No Amanda with a white Volkswagen
You don't have a Yellow Pages for Oakland, do you
(She don't)  got- ta get down there, find that store
Everything happens in a hurry
He embraces
She'll pray for him
Already out the back door with  in tow
black & white parked in the drive with  stuffed inside
Plus a grim wind tearing trees
pauses as he reaches his car
You be careful
This man's close
Catches her eyes
Can barely look at them
They're full of hate
If you find him, John
want you to call me
wanna know his name
153:
Wide over the bay area
Wind swept and rain swept
City lights beginning to come on
In the distance the docks and far beyond the ocean
Somewhere here is a solitary phone booth
"'m look- ing for a special type of rattan
friend of mine recommended you, said  should ask for someone called Amanda
You don't
Thank you
" Followed by sound of a phone slamming down
154:
stack of coins and a pair of ripped out Yellow Pages crosses off another number
Running out of craft shops and run- ning out of quarters
new number hears the same old bullshit
But this one is answering good
Fights to keep his voice light
(Phone) She's not there
- Let me just make sure  got the right Amanda - lotta freckles, right
Right
That's right, that's her
Well, eh, what time d'you expect her
'll eh, try and pop over this afternoon
And he comes out of there running
The Chevy roars up the hill
155:
The kind of store heads open in abandoned warehouses
jungle of jewelry and cane furniture and ethnic junk
Many chairs of the ilk Berlin saw in the Volkswagen van
And now he's staring at its driver
His
through windows
He watches as a red headed Girl clears the till in preparation to close up
within moments the lights are dead and  is heading for her door
156:
/
Plenty of rain to hurry in
drives a red Datsun
She ex- its the car park with a man in a brown Chevrolet following her
157:  /
/
The Chevy tails the Datsun through city streets
lot of rush hour traffic
Music to go with it and it's probably Mussorgsky
final cut and headlights are navigating the hills
Disappear and reappear as they ascend
Steep inclines and the houses are middle class
Too dark to see much now but lamp posts and rain
Still climbing the Datsun takes a side street
keeps 50 yards behind
She turns off and parks in a sloping driveway white Volkswagen van at the top of it
has already pull- ed over
Kills his lights and watches her hurry into the house
158:
just rang the doorbell
Imposes an impartial expression
But this is his last chance and he knows it
The front door is opened & secured on a safety-chain
carries a white Cat
'm sorry to trouble you, but eh
Wait a minute, don't  know you
And she stares like he does not
Before she stares like he does
You're Amanda
Remember, you near- ly ran into me
Way up in Trinity
His smile disarms the securities
And she opens the front door
As  said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into me
What's the problem
'm afraid it's the "van" again
The van
Is it your vehicle
No, my mother's
You better stop in
'm just here to feed the cat
159:
So far so good
Inside without showing an
he doesn't have
This is a gloomy place
She shuts the door
Shuts out the gale
'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white
van
You guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check
Could you tell me who's driven it recently
Only me and Mom
How about any guys on your staff
We only got one
He doesn't drive
[] Would he have lent it to anyone
[No] How bout your Dad
Husband
Boyfriend
He is my boyfriend
My fath- er's dead, and 'm divorced
see
His hopes are collapsing by the moment and nothing else is left
Would you mind if  took a look at it
thought this was "routine
" The Cat cries for its food and  begins to look suspicious
The only man that has driven it in the last 6 months is my uncle
And no way is he involved in a robbery
Could  have his name
Just so can officially eliminate him
Maybe too much charge in his head and she doesn't like the vibe
Could  see your badge again
Sure she can and he searches for it
"Must have left it at home
" Then you better go and get it feel uncomfortable without an

The emerging Music is full of threat
Like it's part of the dark- ness
Too dark to see much of anything here
sound of somebody hammering at a door
light outside and the Camera moves closer
Creeps towards the door as though it's going to answer
Suddenly glass shatters
The door flies open
Flashlights and Men rush in

stares towards the house
Music and rain and a downstairs light just wont out
Headlights go on and the Datsun drives away

'
flashlight searches cobwebs and soot
Descends the chimney and emerges from a long-sealed-off fireplace
Blinks dirt out of his eyes and moves back into the bedroom
Upended bed against the wall and everything upsidedown
The search looks like it has been thorough
St  appears at the door and  looks over
We're not gonna find nothin here

searches the bedroom
Anxiety and antiques
Does a vanity and now a wardrobe
Nothing much in either
But finds a shoe box full of letters in the latter
Postcards/birthday cards etcetera

Half the floorboards already up

Almost too close to see what's happening
But a gloved hand just found a pistol under the bath
Out it comes with  shouting
And St  and  arrive
"Got a little Walther
It's a 25

looks at the floor and listens
looks at the
and listens
Big close on the screen
This scene will intercut between the television and those in front of it as appropriate
[1]  An exterior shot of Berlin's house
Sheriff's cars parked out front
Various people come and go
One of them is Sergeant Taylor
Perpetual wind on the sound track interrupted by a

He pauses briefly an the steps with the wind savaging his hair
(
) Jim unable to say anything right now, except, this is a very sad and tragic day

/
The cell window is reinforced glass
smashes on it like an insane man
(apparently on cell duty) has never seen nothing like this before
doesn't want to see any more
'll sign anything you want
Please
Bring here her
want Helena here
You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down
am calm
am calm
But he isn't and  moves off
cracks blood out of knuckles on the glass
Hollers up the corridor after the Chief
Get St Anne
want St Anne
169:
Gale still making a mass of the trees
police Chevy pulls up and  gets out
Puts a knuckle on the window of a black & white
Uniform wakes and  interrupts his apologies "Go
" And the young Cop does the drive as  heads for the house

/
descends the stairs with her luggage
She's towards the bottom when  appears via the kitchen
Lights momentarily stall as the gale sucks their electricity
Ignorant of his pre- sence she loses her bags and disappears into the den
He moves after her and startles the shit out of  as she comes out
Jesus
What are you doing here
Been trying to call, your line's down
just wanna let you know we're taking the guard off today
heads for a table and unloads a strong-box of documents
Is she going somewhere
'm taking her back to the Instit- ute
Her new term starts tomorrow
He watches her select various papers aware of what she's about
Not gonna try and bail him are you
really wouldn't bother, Margie
reappears wearing a coat and  is in generous mood
You want me to drive her
'm through with my shift
No
'll drive her
171:
Here's a classic twenty-two
is consumed with anxiety & rage
But get mad in here and get nothing
No shoe strings and no wrist watch
But a wrist-band like something medical summar- izing his charge
St  sits impassive as  walks floor
'll sign anything you like - you write it, 'll sign it
But  want her and Margie here
want an opp- ortunity to talk to them - that's all 'm asking
- That's my deal
St 'll put it to your Chief
Well, you'd better put it to him pretty dammed quick, Mr St Anne, because if you don't, she's dead
St Didn't push her down stairs on their previous meeting, did he
He was up there to plant the gun
St Did Taylor plant this, too
Produces a Zippo in a plastic sack and 's senses capsize
Is it yours
question for which St  expects no answer and he is right
We found "Jennifer Eight
" At least, we've found a headless and handless girl
couple of hunters found her
Maybe  asks him "Where" or maybe his expression's enough
About 4 miles south of the institute, less than 50 feet from the road
This was less than 100 feet from the body
can't believe it and knows St  wouldn't believe him
Is it yours
- (no answer) -  know it's yours
- You know it's yours
The only prints on it are Freddy's
You wanna tell me how it got there
wouldn't believe it either
Door open and  enters
Margie Ross put up your bond, Sir
St  and  look surprised
And  looks at St
Are you getting in the way of it
St  examines the bail/bond paper and raises eyes to
St don't make the law

Music on the cut and this is a crane shot high above the house
car tears up the drive with the Camera descending to meet it
out and into the house
And still the gale howls around
173:
Darkness and silence
Where the hell is everyone
He quicks it to the den, Cartoons on
but no one watching
With escalat- ing concern he hits the kitchen and now he's shouting upstairs
"Margie
Margie
" About to climb when  appears at the top
There's no one here
Where are they
Mom took her back to the institute
freezes
He maybe says "What
" He definitely says "When
" dunno
How come they let you out
Is Margie with her
Is she with her
No, she came back and went out ag- ain
gone to see Auntie Charles
has already grabbed a telephone
Aware it's dead before tells him "They're all out around here
" He wanders down- stairs in apparent oblivion to 's distress
races back to the den and new problems
Desperate to get at the guns but all cabinets locked "Where's the keys, Bobby
need a gun
" They're my Dad's guns
Come on, Bobby, for God's sake wanna get the man that killed him
stares at  as though he's staring at that very man
hate you
really hate you
He turns away into the darkness
looks frantic and with- out options
Smashes the cabinets with a chair
Grabs a 44 rev- olver plus a 12 gauge Remington and the slugs that go with it
174:
Wide over an intersection
Berlin's Chevy crosses a bridge and descends into lights
Music travels with him but the Camera re- mains static
Watches tail lights dissolve into a river of red
175:
Tracking back with the car
As yet 100 yards away
Moving fast and getting closer
As it approaches a remote sound of a phone drifts in
And headlights so near now they wipe out everything
176:
Starting to sleet and windshield wipers on
The phone is still ringing like it's at the end of Berlin's brain
Like it's part of his thoughts mixed up with the nightmare he's hearing again
(
) Go take a look in his office
It's fulla rattan - that's the connect- ion, that's the "link" - that's why they never got an
- He kills blind girls - put their picture in the newspaper, and 99 percent of the people who know them are blind
Intercutting 's fearful eyes with his
of the road
St  (
) Havta be a real dope to kill her now, wouldn't he
mean, we're talking real, full-blown, insane
(
) He is insane
His fucken brain's upside down
But he's also very cunning
He's not going after her with a "Pearl Handled Colt," he- 'll just push her down the stairs
Just the sound of tho phone and the road dissolving into black
177:
-
miserable corridor with the merest of lights
phone rings somewhere at its end
is on her way up the corridor and the ringing is louder
Finds keys and walks into her apartment
178:
-
Phone in close-up and the frame widens as  heads towards it
Reaches out and is maybe a second away before it rings off
179:  /
This is a little country stop some place an the peripheries of the snow-line
slams the phone down and runs to his car
Screeches out onto the highway and the Camera begins to ascend
The Camera climbs higher revealing somber mountains
Plus mile upon mile of road he has yet to travel
Still it ascends until the Chevrolet is reduced to an insignificance by the landscape
180:
-
panoramic over the institute wide enough to include surround- ing forest
Headlights approach down a wooded track and go out
Just possible to see a tiny Figure moving towards the building
181:
High on the fire escape looking down
flashlight arrives bel- ow
Eerie fragmentation of light as the Figure begins to climb
182:
/
The highway is winding and narrowed with snow
Couldn't find a lousier road on which to overtake
is right up behind a forty ton truck and he's trying to overtake
Hits the horn and tries again
Halfway past the trailer when a bend suddenly rel- eases headlights
An angry claxon and he's forced to pull back
183:
Although curtains are open the room is in darkness
Someone on the fire escape looking in
flashlight snaps on and a circle of light explores the room
Creeps across the floor and pauses at the bed
Climbs slowly to illuminate 's sleeping face
144:
Close-up sound and close-up picture
glass-cutter scores the window
nasty noise but you'd have to be wide awake and list- ening to hear it
gloved fist punches the section out
Falls to the floor and shatters
And a hand reaches in for the catch
145:
/
is wide awake and listening
Hurrying into her dressing gown with a similar urgency to get out
She arrives in the liv- ing room as the  is clambering through the window
Panic as she blunders for the front door
Tears it open and vanishes into the corridor
He crosses the room and follows her outside
186:
/
knows the building and moves faster than he may have ex- pected
Green dressing gown and bare feet
White nightgown and blonde hair
The man in black hurries after her
She's already at the swing doors and he's virtually running to stay with her
She bursts through the doors and rushes downstairs
He follows only seconds behind
The wind groans down as they descend
- turns a corner of the stairwell and momentarily disappears
For a moment he loses her
Which way did she go
Downstairs or along the corridor
His anxiety is immediately assuaged
Spots what already looks like a ghost fleeing into shadows
He takes off along the corridor
Getting breathless
But getting closer
Near enough now to sense her fear
Near enough now to grab her
Say night, night, dead girl
As he reaches for her she turns
wears a green dressing gown and a blonde wig and has a very big fucking pistol in her hand
can't believe what he's looking at
And for an in- stant neither does
Their surprise is mutually stunning
How can it be him
How can it be her
's still trying to work out how they made the switch when the first bullet smacks into his chest
Gets another as he goes down
He crumples in a deadly heap and revenge is completed with two more in the back
187:
/
barges through the doors
The  Janitor is halfway up adjacent stairs peering down
No time for introductions and no time for explanations
"Call the Police
Do it
Now
" Shout- ing up at him she's already descending
"Tell em the gymnasium
" 188:
patrols plate glass windows
Where are the fucking cops
She's shocked and looks strange indeed
Wig off but hair grips all over her head
An overcoat and shoes but still wearing the nightgown underneath
couple of dreary lights in the ceiling
sits numb under one of them all but hidden in a blanket
can't stand waiting any longer
"'m gonna call them my- self
"  nods and sure she's
to stay here
The doors settle and she is alone
Headlights cross the windows shifting the shadows of everything
Swooping the walls they move attent- ion back to the door
stares in and then pushes through
Worse for wear but very much alive
Discarded his leather jack- et revealing the bullet proof vest
Blood all over his -shirt
Looks like he caught one in the shoulder
bad burn and blood runs from his left hand
In his right hand he clasps the knife
He cracks it open like a whip
hears it and stands
Ter- ror as the footsteps approach
"Margie
Margie
" But Margie is- n't around
He's less than 30 feet away
She tries to back off but is hindered by the blanket
Tries to scream but is stifled with fear
Maybe six seconds to live but this refers to Taylor
"Taylor" He swings around but this time he doesn't get time to look surprised
blows the fucker across the room
Solid load slugs weighing an ounce each crash into him
keeps pumping the Remington and doesn't stop firing until the magaz- ine is over
No conjecture now
This bastard is very much dead
throws the 12 gauge aside
And maybe it means something
Maybe at last he accepts he's stopped living in that world and ready to give himself a chance in this
in his arms and this is his new world
Flashing lights and headlights flood in- to the darkness
Their embrace goes on
And this story is told
