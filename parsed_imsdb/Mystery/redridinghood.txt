My life would likely be no different from yours, were it not for the most uncommon events that occurred during the winter of the Year of Our Lord Thirteen Hundred and Twenty-five learned many things that winter
About people
About love
But mainly,  learned about loss

) To this day,  am the only person that  know to be living who knows the whole truth about that horrible time
This is my tale

Their armor is in disarray, adorned with souvenirs from the Middle East
They're camped in a clearing, their cart pulled to a nearby roadside

One of them, a   who looks like his sword might weigh more than he does, hitches a nervous  to a tree
He strokes the horse's neck, calming
Then:    in the distance
The Boy suddenly looks nervous, too
He quickly joins the others at the campfire -- a   (30s) and an
Did you hear that
Hear what
The wolf
The Boy shivers, fearful
The innkeeper told me -- () 2
: know what he told you
He told you about the Wolf
The Beast of Villiers la CroisAe
(off Boy's look) The people of that village have been spreading that nonsense since before you were a tickle in your daddy's prick
'd give you a whipping for believing it if thought it would do any good
The Old Knight stares into the fire, then speaks
used to travel these woods
They told the same stories then that they do now
Only  heard them from a man who actually saw the beast with his own eyes
Half the people in these parts claim to have seen it
This man claimed it was the last thing he ever saw
The Wolf took his eyes
And half his face
(off their looks) saw his scars and empty eye sockets
His skin looked like it was on inside-out
It didn't seem to me like the kind of thing a man would make up a story about
He shrugs
His companions exchange an unnerved look
-  () It's raining now
The Knights sleep underneath the cart for shelter
Lightning
Then, from

Did he imagine it
He reluctantly decides to venture out to investigate
The Boy hurries over to where he tied the horse
but all he finds is the empty rope blowing in the wind
In a of lightning, he sees that the horse is gone
Then he hears something
strange  sound
and
He slowly turns
() 3
: Not far away, he makes out a shape in the darkness
The horse is on its side,  helplessly
And there's something crouched next to it
We can't make out what it is, only a - , shrouded in shadow
Whatever it is, it's eating the horse alive
The Boy steps away in horror, then hurriedly stumbles back to his companions and frantically shakes them awake
What the devil are you --
Wait, wait
Be quiet
He raises a hand
He's heard something
They listen
Approaching through the mud
The Boy's hand clutches a dagger, but the Fat Knight reaches out and stays him, terrified
The Boy follows his look
We never get a good look at   walking toward them
But what the men see scares them shitless
It stops near the cart
The men huddle together, watching as it slowly starts to walk around the cart -- -- then suddenly jumps atop it
The Figure is now above them
With each step it takes, the boards of the wooden cart  and bend under its weight
long beat
Then the Figure jumps down again, landing behind the men, startling them
It pauses
The men cower, shivering
Suddenly, the cart is flipped over as if it weighed nothing, revealing the terrified Knights beneath it
Lightning
shadow falls over them
The men scramble to their feet, but the Old Knight slips in the mud
The Boy stops to help him, but then the Old Knight starts screaming, something , and the Boy stops short at what he sees
The Fat Knight runs
Wait
We have to help him
The Fat Knight ignores him
The Old Knight shrieks
We hear the same  and  that this thing made while eating the horse
The Boy quickly looks around
sees a curved Arabian scimitar lying in the mud, fallen from the overturned wagon
He grabs it and as the Fat Knight runs, the Boy stands his ground
He hefts the blade
He's young, but he has used this before
lot
Rain beats down on his face and lightning  as he confronts the thing that is devouring the Old Knight
() 4
: (2) The Fat Knight runs through the forest without looking back
He hears a loud  behind him and runs faster
Then he hears the Boy  and blind panic sets in, his head filled with the sounds of his and   in the mud and crashing
He's running so fast he nearly falls into the that crosses his path
He quickly looks for a way to cross
The river is gorged and the water is moving fast
Then, in a flash of lightning, he spots it -- fallen tree spans the river
The Knight hurries to it
The bark is smooth and slick from the rain
He can't stand on it
He has to crawl
He edges out on his hands and knees, his eyes flicking nervously at the waters surging underneath him
He has almost made it across
when he hears a
He freezes
Looks back
Lightning
The Figure, still obscured to us, stands on the riverbank behind the Knight
It
The Knight tries to crawl away, but slips and nearly falls in the river
Then suddenly, the tree beneath him begins to move
He hangs on for his life and looks back
The Figure is on the tree behind him, slowly closing in
He starts to crawl, slips again
No way he can get away
He looks down into the racing river waters
Then back at the Figure closing in
The choice is clear
The Fat Knight dives headfirst off the tree -- -- but he never hits the water
Something grabs him by the legs and stops him short
He cries out and looks up at the thing that is dangling him helplessly above the water
He weeps
Then, abruptly -- -- he is yanked up out of sight
- quickly and expertly cuts the throat of a pig that has been hung upside down by its hind legs
It kicks and squirms as it bleeds out into a pan

Dogs run and
locked up in the stockade
's hammer
On the surface, a typical medieval village
But something is wrong here
pall hangs over the place
The people are subdued, beaten
comes up: 1324 () 5
: There's a  in the village green
Hanging from it is a wood plank with a crude drawing of a moon on it, three- quarters full
The moon has a vaguely sinister face
'   -  - tiny spider spins its web
to a pretty 17-year-old  gazing up at it
Her name is She scoops the spider up, watches it crawl around on her hand, fascinated
'   - The home of a medieval peasant
Isabelle's mother, (late 30s), and sister,  (18, plain- looking), work in the garden
They look up as Isabelle emerges from the cottage, daintily carrying the spider
Honestly, Isabelle
Just kill it
can't
It's the fifth commandment
Thou shalt not kill
Lucie rolls her eyes
Isabelle crouches, letting the spider crawl off her hand
She watches it skitter away, then calls to Suzette, feigning nonchalance: 'm going to take Father some water
All right
Don't be long
Isabelle smiles, grabs a bucket and ladle, and anxiously heads toward the village
Lucie watches her go, dubious
- Isabelle struggles to draw water from a well
Even toiling and sweaty, Isabelle's beauty stands in stark contrast to her squalid surroundings
building a timber-framed structure notices his    (late teens) casting distracted glances in her direction
He calls out to her, smiling
Hey, there
Let one of these young lads get that for you
() 6
: can do it myself
The Carpenter smiles
Of course she can
- The village  are chopping down trees and hauling away the lumber
of them are in the midst of what looks like a serious conversation
Isabelle approaches them with the bucket of water
One of them turns and sees Isabelle
His name is (handsome, 40s)
He hides his dour expression and gives Isabelle a big smile
She smiles back
Mother thought you might be thirsty
That was very thoughtful of her
He gives her a knowing look as he ladles a drink from the bucket
Isabelle's gaze drifts from him to another woodcutter, working off by himself
His name is (21, darkly handsome, almost dangerous-looking)
He makes eye contact with Isabelle for a moment, then wipes his brow and calls out to the
'm taking a break
break
Does that mean you're going to start working
The other Woodcutters
Peter walks away
Isabelle's gaze lingers on him too long
Cesaire notices, not entirely comfortable with what he sees
-  - Not far from where the Woodcutters work, Peter waits, impatient
Soon Isabelle approaches, smiling
He takes her in his arms, kissing her
She holds him tight
was afraid you weren't coming
You should know better than that
() 7
: He kisses her again, nibbling her neck
Isabelle opens her eyes, smiles up at him
Touches his face
think my sister's starting to suspect something
Do you think she'll tell your father
don't care
wish she would tell him
want everyone to know
Besides, my father likes you
Of course he does
Right up until the point where he figures out what 'm doing with his daughter
Peter glances back and Isabelle follows his look
Through the trees, she sees her father and the group of grim Woodcutters, still in serious conversation
What's going on
You haven't heard
(off her look) Three men
They found them this morning just off the Center Road
At least they think it was three men
There wasn't enough left to piece them back together
long beat as Isabelle takes this in
Then: Was it the Wolf
Could it have been anything else
Isabelle shudders
No, it couldn't have been
We should have killed that monster a long time ago
know
You say that every month
() 8
: (2) He gives her a grim smile, then kisses her
She kisses him back, then tries to stop kissing him
It's not easy
'd better go
Same time tomorrow
Don't get used to this
start my sewing lessons next week
You really think you can go all day without seeing me
'll manage somehow
Pride is a cardinal sin, by the way
can think of worse sins  could be committing
She gives a cautioning look, then leaves with a smile
-  - The   is changing the plank on the moon sign
He replaces the picture of the three-quarters moon with a picture of a half moon, its face indifferent
Half full
Half full
'   -   - Suzette is putting bread and cheese into a basket
Isabelle pulls on a drab hooded cloak
You mind your grandmother, understand
You're her student now, the same as the other girls
Yes, Mother
Suzette hands her the basket with a proud look
My last baby has grown up

-  - Isabelle watches a   perform simple sleight of hand magic tricks
His name is  (14)
She applauds his performance and hands him a coin
He makes it 'disappear,' then smiles big and runs away
crazy old woman, , shoots Isabelle a look
You're only encouraging him
know
(ages 16-18) approach:  (round-faced, cheery and instantly likable),  (practical, serious), and  (pretty, arrogant, flirtatious)
playful  tags along
Prudence and Rosemaria look tired, but Roxanne greets Isabelle with a big smile
You look happy
Aren't you excited
It's too early to be excited
'm just trying to look on the bright side
Well, stop it before somebody hurts you
The girls have a laugh at Roxanne's expense
-  - The girls leave the village on a trail that leads through the dark forest
The puppy stops at the edge of the forest
Then it  and refuses to follow
-  - The trail stretches out in front of the girls as far as they can see
Rosemaria walks with Roxanne
Prudence hangs back with Isabelle, brimming with juicy gossip
() 10
: Did you hear about her and the Darley brothers
Oh, no
Which one
Both
On the same night
Isabelle gives an incredulous look and Prudence tries to contain her laughter
Rosemaria hears and looks back at them
She scowls at Isabelle
Why does your grandmother have to live so far away
What's the matter, Rosemaria
Having trouble walking
Prudence laughs
Roxanne frowns, disapproving
Rosemaria shoots Isabelle a dirty look
'  - The girls cross a little wooden bridge that spans a brook and follow the trail to a large cottage, well past its prime
Chickens  and peck around it
An   opens the door and waves to them
She's stooped and withered, but her eyes are bright and beautiful
She wears a blue belted gown and a necklace with a crucifix on it
This is Isabelle's
Well, stop dawdling
Come on, come on
The girls hurry inside, but Grandmother stops Isabelle
Your mother has warned you not to expect any special treatment from me
Yes, ma'am
Grandmother eyes her a moment longer, then breaks into a smile and surreptitiously hands her a bright red apple
() 11
: Well, then your mother doesn't know me very well, does she
Isabelle smiles as Grandmother ushers her inside
'  - Grandmother works a pair of knitting needles, casting loops of red wool yarn onto one of them, a resting on her lap
Her bedchamber is hidden by a beautiful veil embroidered with palms and pomegranates
The girls sit facing her, watching as she knits
Then: There
This is going to be my foundation
Everything  do now will build off of this
She shows the row of stitches to Roxanne
Roxanne, is this a good foundation
don't know
Why not
Well
you haven't told us what you're making
There's something else  haven't told you
haven't told you why 'm making it
Before you begin any task, you must first always ask yourself why
Why
The girls laugh
Grandmother gives her a patient smile
Because understanding why you are doing something is the key to doing it successfully
So, before we begin today, let's be certain that we have a good foundation
Who can tell me why you are here
() 12
: To become seamstresses
To learn how to sew and mend clothes
That's what you are doing
But why are you doing it
Blank looks
None of them have ever considered this
Isabelle, your sister studied with me last winter
What does she do now
She works with the women
Why don't you work with them
don't know how to yet
And how does that make you feel
Isabelle thinks for a moment, then has an insight
Like a child
Grandmother gives her a smile, then continues
You will be coming here every day for the next three months
During that time,  will teach you everything you need to know to be productive members of our community
But there is something far more important that will also be happening here
All the girls are paying close attention now, but Grandmother seems to be speaking directly to Isabelle
You will be proving your worth and learning your place in the world
And  promise you, when you leave here for the last time, you will never feel like a child again
13
-  - The four girls return to the village along the forest path
Waiting for them is Peter
Isabelle pretends to not notice him
As they pass, he calls out to her: need to talk to you
Isabelle turns to face him, trying to stay nonchalant
What about
Peter just looks at her for a beat
Isabelle turns and sees that the other girls have stopped to watch
Isabelle shoots them a look
The girls take the hint and leave
When they've gone, Peter walks up to Isabelle
When were you planning on telling me
Telling you what
That you're engaged to be married to Henri Smith
Isabelle gapes at him, stunned and confused
Henri Smith
Is this a joke
Look at me
Just look at me and tell me you didn't know
She looks at him and sees it in his eyes
He's serious
Who told you this
Your father
Off Isabelle's look
'   -   - The family is gathered around the table
Isabelle and Lucie listen to their parents in stunned silence
() 14
: It's all been arranged
Your marriage to Henri will settle our debt to his father
Isabelle nods, shaken
Cesaire sees that she's upset
We know that you and Peter have become friends
But you have adult responsibilities now
That means putting your family's interests ahead of your own
So Henri Smith is in the family's interest and Peter is not
Peter is a fine young man
But what
He's poor
He's an orphan
He's not one of us
His parents were outsiders
Why
Because they hadn't lived here since Noah built the ark
You mind your tongue
Isabelle is about to respond, when she notices something
Lucie is crying
beat
Lucie looks up at her parents
Do you realize how this makes me look
'm older than her by more than a year
If anyone should be getting married in the spring, it's me
Everyone is taken aback
Lucie storms out of the cottage, angrily wiping tears
Isabelle watches her go
'   -   - Cesaire smokes his pipe, troubled
Suzette sits nearby
() 15
: This was your idea
Now  have both of them hating me
In the loft, Isabelle and Lucie are in bed
but Isabelle only pretends to be asleep so she can eavesdrop
We knew Isabelle was going to be stubborn
It wouldn't be like her to simply do as she's told
She's too much like her grandmother
That she is
What about Lucie
She's a good girl, but she's still a child
Talk to her
You're her father
She'll listen to you
Isabelle glances over at Lucie
and sees that she's been eavesdropping, too
Lucie turns away, embarrassed
Isabelle gives her a sad look
'   - There's a knock at the door
Isabelle answers, revealing (18)
He's tall and good-looking, but still awkward in his body
Isabelle eyes him, a little aloof
Hello, Isabelle
Hello, Henri
-  - Isabelle and Henri walk in awkward silence
Then: So  suppose you've heard
Yes
My parents are very pleased
And you
Are you pleased
It's a very generous arrangement
() 16
: Not the answer he was hoping for
Another awkward beat
Do you have any other feelings about it
About me
'm not sure
We've never really talked that much
know
That's why  asked you to walk with me
wanted to talk
What for
Well
because we're going to be husband and wife soon
Not until the spring festival
That's months away
lot can happen in a few months
Henri seems disappointed
She sees this and reconsiders
All right
What would you like to talk about
'm not really sure
brought you this
He reaches into his pocket and offers Isabelle a flower
She takes it, suddenly blushing
But just then, she sees Peter walking toward them with another
Well, 'm glad we had this conversation
Isabelle abruptly turns and walks away, leaving Henri surprised and a little hurt
She passes Peter, her eyes averted
He glances back at her as she and walks away
'   - Isabelle is helping Suzette prepare dinner, but she's purposefully ignoring her mother
Suzette notices
() 17
: You know,  had a sweetheart when was your age, too
Isabelle looks up, intrigued in spite of herself
Suzette smiles slyly at her reaction
What happened
Nothing happened
My parents arranged for me to marry your father and that was the end of that
Didn't you want to marry your sweetheart
Of course,  did
But there's more to marriage than being in love
Love doesn't always last and it certainly doesn't fill your children's bellies in the winter
You've never wished you could have married that other boy
Not even once
Isabelle eyes her, still uncertain
- Isabelle prays in front of an altar with prayer candles on it
Peter kneels next to her and lights one of them
We need to talk
- Isabelle and Peter stand behind the church, out of sight
Peter looks off toward the woods, his back to Isabelle
You have to go through with it
You have to marry Henri
() 18
: Isabelle takes a step toward him
She hesitates, gathering her nerve to speak
Then: don't care what my parents want
They don't own me
love you
That doesn't matter
It does to me
Doesn't it matter to you
It's not our decision to make
You sound like my mother
Then maybe you should start listening to your mother
(off her look) It's over
They had to find out eventually
Don't turn this into something that it's not
We had our fun, but that's all it ever was
Isabelle looks up at him, shocked and confused
don't believe you
Go home, Isabelle
Go home and grow up
Isabelle gapes at him
Peter walks away
don't believe you
He doesn't look back
She watches him go, heartbroken
- Cesaire bathes in a cold stream
The sun is just barely rising, rays of light shining through the trees
He smiles
It looks like the start of a beautiful day
19
-  - The village is bustling with activity, but there's a palpable tension
The picture on the moon sign is of a three-quarters moon
but then the Herald changes it to a picture of a   with a cruel, malevolent face
Full moon
Full moon
Full moon
'   - Isabelle emerges from the cottage
Roxanne, Prudence, and Rosemaria are outside waiting on her
They all start toward the village, but then Isabelle sees something
In the shadows next to the cottage, Cesaire is giving Lucie a stern lecture
Lucie turns and sees Isabelle
Her face is ashen and there are tears in her eyes
Isabelle starts toward them, but Cesaire stops her
This doesn't concern you, Isabelle
Yes, Father
Isabelle reluctantly turns and walks away
The girls follow her
Roxanne gives Lucie a concerned look
- The girls walk through the village
Isabelle is lost in thought, stung by her father's brusk dismissal
What's wrong with Lucie
How would you feel if you were in love with your sister's fiancAe
Isabelle stops short and gives Rosemaria a sharp look
Lucie is not in love with my fiancAe
Really
So she's just had a crush on him since she was ten
() 20
: As if she would really tell you something like that
She didn't
She told my sister
(off Isabelle's look) Did you honestly not know
Isabelle clearly had no idea, but tries to hide it
Just then, they walk by the blacksmith's shop where Henri works with his father,
Henri smiles at Isabelle
Come on
We're going to be late
She turns away
Rosemaria gives her a smug look
-  - The girls are walking down the path to Grandmother's cottage
Rosemaria lags behind, tired and grumpy
There's a fork in the path and Rosemaria stops at it branches off into the forest, overgrown and narrow
Rosemaria looks at it for a beat
Roxanne suddenly notices that Rosemaria isn't with them
She looks back and sees her start down the other path
Rosemaria
The other girls stop and hurry back to the fork, dismayed to find Rosemaria headed down the overgrown path
What are you doing
What does it look like
You can't go that way
You have to stay on the path
This way is faster
But it's not safe
My brother says the bridge is rotten
() 21
: don't care
It's bad enough working all day in that smelly cottage
It's not reasonable for them to expect us to walk that far every day on top of that
She walks away, defiant
The girls look nervous
Then: If you get lost, nobody will come looking for you
Not tonight
This last part gives Rosemaria pause
She looks down the narrow path
It suddenly seems a little ominous
Grudgingly, she returns to the group
The other girls exchange quiet looks of relief
They continue on
The wind blows leaves across the abandoned path
'  - The girls are busy with sewing and knitting projects
Grandmother helps Roxanne at the spinning wheel
Then: Everyone finish what you're working on
Your parents will be worried if you're not home before it starts to get dark
The girls begin packing up their work
Prudence sighs
wish someone would just kill that stupid wolf
You can't just kill it
It's not an ordinary wolf
It's a devil- wolf
servant of Satan himself
Prudence rolls her eyes
Whatever
Who cares what it is
It's only one night a month
You stay inside, lock up the animals, and you don't go into the forest
It's never killed anyone from the village and as long as we leave it alone, it never will
() 22
: My goodness
had no idea our young people were so woefully uneducated these days
(off their looks) Our village was not always like this
When  was young, this was a very special place
Traders and merchants came here from lands 'd never heard of selling things had never seen
King Philip the Bold even visited here once
But that, of course, was before the Wolf came
The girls listen attentively
Your parents fear the Wolf because they remember when it did kill people from the village
Break down doors in the middle of the night and snatch children right out of their beds
Rumors began to spread that we were cursed
That was when our village began to die
And that was why my husband led a group of men into the woods to kill the Wolf
But instead, it killed him
Isabelle reacts
She has never heard this story before
After that, people here didn't have much stomach to go hunting for it anymore
But something had changed
The Wolf stopped killing in the village
Even our livestock were usually safe as long as they were brought inside
So we decided it was safer to compromise
We gave the Wolf its one night a month, the night of the full moon, and it has left us alone ever since
People still die
Yes, but nobody we know
() 23
: (2) Everyone knows what should be done
But it's not always easy to do what you know is right
Sometimes it's easier to settle for being safe
Isabelle frowns, unsatisfied
-  - Villagers hurriedly bring their sheep and pigs into their homes
Doors are shut and barricaded
Cesaire is outside the family cottage, nailing the shutters closed
'   -   - Isabelle's family sits at the dinner table in silence
Cesaire sets mugs of beer out for everyone
Lucie numbly picks at her food, doesn't touch her beer
Isabelle works up her nerve to say something and turns to Suzette: You were right
About Peter was being childish
() But 'm not going to marry Henri
Cesaire and Suzette stop eating
Suzette levels a cold look at Isabelle
You'll do as you're told
It's all been arranged
The family gains the same no matter which one of us marries him
And  don't love Henri
Lucie does
Lucie looks up, surprised to be dragged into this
She's right
It's not fair will gladly trade places with her
beat
Then, without looking up, Lucie whispers: Shut up
Isabelle is stung, the smile wiped from her face
() 24
: 'm sorry
Please
Just shut up and mind your own business
tense beat
Isabelle looks away, hurt and confused
'   -  - Isabelle is fast asleep
Next to her, Lucie looks over at her
She's wide awake
She sneaks out of bed
'   - Lucie carefully sneaks down from the loft and quietly puts on a
She accidently kicks a pan on the floor and puts a hand down to silence it
She listens to hear if anyone has awakened
Nothing
-  - Lucie slips out of the house
She shivers in the cold, pulls the riding hood around her
in the sky
The village looks deserted, a ghost town
Eerie, still, dark
The moon-sign swings in the breeze,  on its rusty hooks
Lucie hurries away toward the woods
- Lucie nervously walks along the road leading away from the village
She startles at every sound
She looks up
The full moon is visible in the sky above her through the skeletal branches of the dark trees
She comes to the overgrown path that the girls stopped at earlier
Lucie takes a deep breath and starts down it
- Lucie reaches an
It spans a deep gully and a fast-moving river strewn with jagged rocks
Lucie gives the bridge a nervous look and starts across it
The boards  loudly under her feet
The bridge sways in the wind
She carefully makes her way across, only breathing when she is safely on the other side
25
-  - Lucie comes to a grassy meadow bathed with moonlight
She stands in the middle of it, next to a large rock, and looks all around
She's alone, cold and afraid
Then
she takes off her riding hood, folds it, and places it on the rock
She begins to disrobe, folding her dress and her undergarments and stacking them in a neat pile
Soon she's standing naked, her arms clutched around her breasts, shivering with cold
And fear
from this lonely naked figure until the dark branches of the trees obscure her from view
Then, somewhere, a   in the night
'   -  - Isabelle wakes up, groggy
Lucie's bed is empty
- Children are playing, a  chasing several giggling , growling and waving his hands like claws
'm the Wolf
'm going to eat you up
-  - One of the Girls runs into the meadow and sees something that makes her stop short
The other Children gather behind her, all frozen by what they see
are picking at a bloody carcass
All we can see of it is a human hand
crow gnaws on one of the fingers
'  - The girls are at their lessons
Suddenly, there's an urgent  at the door
Everyone stops, surprised
Grandmother answers it
It's a  , sweaty and out of breath from running
What on earth --
The Young Man glances at Isabelle
Something about the look in his eyes makes Isabelle go pale
26
-  - Isabelle hurries into the clearing with Roxanne, Prudence, and Rosemaria trailing behind her
crowd has gathered
She pushes through it, then stop short
Lucie is dead
We don't see what's been done to her, but Roxanne turns away and vomits
Cesaire and Suzette are already here
He holds her as she cries on his shoulder
Isabelle just stares at Lucie's body, shattered
'   -  - Isabelle is curled in a fetal ball on the bed, clutching Lucie's cloak to her chest
She's cried her eyes out
Grandmother sets down a cup of tea
As Isabelle watches, Grandmother sprinkles a pinch of dark herbs in the tea
It's my little secret
pinch will help you rest
little more and you'll sleep through the end of the world
Grandmother smiles
Isabelle smiles back, weak
think 'd like that
- Two men, the Merchant and the , gossip by the well
She had it coming, if you ask me
What the hell was she doing out there
Then they notice that Isabelle is right behind them, drawing a water from the well
Both men shift uncomfortably, but she pretends she didn't hear
'   - Lucie's body lies on the table
Isabelle watches as Suzette and Grandmother bathe the body
Suddenly, Grandmother stops
She's found something clutched in Lucie's hand
troubled look comes over her
What is it
() 27
: Nothing
Grandmother curtly wraps what she's found in a washcloth
- Lucie's funeral
Cesaire and Suzette sit with Isabelle, who holds Grandmother's hand
The other girls are here, too
Roxanne sits with her mother, , and Claude, the deaf boy we saw performing magic
The priest,  , conducts the service
Wherefore each man and woman that is wise, make him ready thereto; for we all shall die, and we know not how soon
- Villagers leave the church
Claude is playing in the cemetery
Father Auguste frowns, disapproving
Marguerite sees this and angrily pulls Roxanne aside
Take your brother home
Embarrassed, Roxanne quickly grabs Claude and drags him away, but he fights her, crying and kicking
Isabelle's family is met by Henri and his father, Adrien
She was a good girl
We all loved her
He's looking at Cesaire and shakes his hand, but he briefly glances at Suzette
Isabelle notices the look, but then she spots Peter leaving the church
She makes brief eye contact with him before Henri interrupts
'm here for you, too
But her gaze follows Peter as he walks away
-   - , the town bailiff, presides over a gathering of the Villagers
Isabelle, Suzette, and Grandmother sit with Cesaire, who is angrily addressing the crowded room
() 28
: line has been crossed
The beast must be destroyed
Your daughter crossed the line
She went into the woods
She was taken
She must have been
So the Wolf broke into your home and stole your daughter without waking anyone or leaving any sign at all
It's been almost thirty years since someone here was killed by the Wolf
We've left it alone
Why would it suddenly come and take one of us now
Grandmother gathers her nerve and stands up
know something
Cesaire and Suzette give Grandmother surprised looks
She walks up to the table and hands Attewater the wadded up washcloth we saw her with earlier
found this
believe it must belong to her attacker
Attewater unfolds the washcloth
There are a few strands of hair inside
He gives her a sharp look
This is not animal hair
No, it isn't
It's human
stunned silence comes over the room
No man could have done the things that were done to your granddaughter
It must have been the Wolf
() 29
: (2) Yet she was holding a man's hair in her hand when she died
What are you suggesting
That the man and the Wolf may be one and the same
low  works its way through the crowd
werewolf
It would explain much
The Pope himself has declared that such creatures exist
The thought gives everyone pause
Even if you're right, it doesn't help us
The woods are filled with hermits and strangers
If there's a werewolf among them, how will we find it
There are experts in these matters
Men who find and try witches and werewolves
We could request the Church to send someone
Grandmother gives him a sharp look
Not someone
You're talking about Father Solomon
This sends a ripple of comment through the room
He is the Church's most successful werewolf hunter
But what of his methods
The man once burned down an entire village just to root out one witch
() 30
: (3) Unsubstantiated rumors
The Church has appointed him the Witchfinder General of all Christendom
That is also unsubstantiated
Attewater eyes him, but Father Auguste stands his ground
have the utmost confidence in the ability of the Witchfinder General to determine the nature of the beast and put an end to it will dispatch a messenger in the morning
Even if Father Solomon agrees to help us, it will take weeks for him to get here
That means another full moon
Maybe two
We must defend ourselves
long, silent beat
Then, Henri stands
He's right
The beast broke the peace, not us
( ) will help you kill it
Henri's father gives him a surprised look
But after another long beat, the Reeve stands up, too
As will
We all will
Henri is nervous, but tries to appear brave for Isabelle
'   -   - Isabelle is about to leave when she sees Lucie's red riding hood
She gives it a solemn look
-  - light snow has fallen
The girls are walking to Grandmother's house, but Isabelle sadly lags behind, lost in thought
She's wearing Lucie's red riding hood
() 31
: Roxanne waits for Isabelle and offers her hand
Isabelle smiles sadly and takes it
Prudence and Rosemaria let them catch up, then they continue on together
'   - Isabelle returns home
Suzette is making dinner, but stops short when she sees Isabelle in Lucie's red cloak
Who gave you permission to wear that
Nobody
just -- Your Grandmother made that for Lucie
Take it off
Isabelle hesitates, then does as she's told
Suzette snatches the cloak away from her
beat
It was folded when they found her
Her clothes, too
Did you notice that
Someone must have folded them
beat
Isabelle is reluctant to voice her thoughts
She was so unhappy
Suzette turns, her eyes narrowing dangerously
What are you saying
Maybe she went into the woods on purpose
Maybe she wanted to die
Suddenly: Suzette slaps her across the face
Hard
Lucie's soul is at peace with God
Don't you ever again suggest otherwise
Suzette turns away in tears
Isabelle is stunned speechless
32
'  - Isabelle trudges through the mud toward a ramshackle cottage
If there had been train tracks in the fourteenth century, this place would have been on the wrong side of them
Isabelle gathers her nerve and knocks on the door long beat
The door opens
It's Peter
He gives her a surprised look
She looks up at him, choking back tears
Are you all right
'm sorry
just need to talk to someone
Can  come in
Peter balks
Just then, a figure appears
Isabelle can't believe her eyes
It's Rosemaria
She's standing behind Peter, but it's clear that she's naked
No
You can't
She wraps an arm around Peter's waist
Isabelle gives him a stricken look and runs away
Peter watches her go
'  - Lessons are over
The girls are ready to leave except for Isabelle, who sits alone by the fire
Rosemaria gives her a sly look as she leaves
When the girls have gone, Grandmother sits down next to Isabelle
hate the cold
Why can't we have lessons in the summer
suppose that would be easier
But then that would defeat the purpose
People only change when things are difficult
Isabelle gives her a look, understanding, then turns away
Grandmother puts a hand on her shoulder and then leaves her alone
Isabelle stares into the fire
'   - Roxanne comes home to a shocking scene: her mother, Marguerite, half-naked and wrapped in a blanket, () 33
: viciously beating Claude with a switch
Roxanne hurriedly pulls her off of him and he runs away
caught the little bastard watching us
Watching what
Just then, the Merchant enters from the bedroom, adjusting his clothes
He hesitates when he sees Roxanne, then drops a handful of coins on the table and leaves
Marguerite puts the coins in a leather purse
Roxanne glares at her
It's money, isn't it
You could make twice this your first time
They pay more for virgins
Roxanne recoils in disgust and storms out in tears
- The full moon sign swings in the wind, a few flakes of snow whipping through the air around it
'  - Adrien picks up a hammer and a pickaxe
He hands the hammer to Henri, fixing him with a serious look
Don't do this for Isabelle
She can't marry you if you're dead
() 'm not doing it for her
Your mother would be proud to see the man you've become
Henri is moved
He nods, at a loss for words
- Not so much a tavern as the home of someone who decided to brew some beer and sell it
Cesaire stands before a group of men
They've all had too much to drink
() 34
: My father died trying to kill the Wolf
For forty years, we have lived in fear of it
But no more
And never again
We don't need a Witchfinder General to rid of us this hell-hated beast
Because by God and all that is holy, the Beast of Villiers la CroisAe shall die tonight
The men
- Cesaire leads the drunken group through the streets
The rest of the Villagers line the streets, watching them go
Claude tries to join the hunters, thinking it's a game, but Roxanne quickly catches him
Peter shakes his head at the dubious spectacle
Henri sees him
You're not coming with us
Are you joking
These fools are as likely to kill each other as they are anything else
Henri shoots him an angry look before moving on
Isabelle and Suzette say goodbye to Cesaire
Isabelle sees Peter through the crowd and quickly looks away
Just then, Henri and Adrien pass by
On impulse, Isabelle runs up and kisses Henri on the mouth
When she's sure that Peter has seen this, she quickly walks away
Henri gives Peter a gloating look
Peter scowls
- The Men have taken up positions just inside the treeline, one of them every twenty feet, surrounding the village
They each have lit torches
Henri crouched in the brush
Cesaire walks along the line of men
Get that torch out
Henri douses his torch
35
- The full moon is high in the night sky
Snow is falling
over the anxious face of the hunters
Adrien, clutching his pickaxe
The Reeve
The Merchant
The Carpenter
Shivering from cold and jangled nerves, staring wide-eyed into the dark and silent woods
'   - Isabelle lies in bed, but still awake
Suddenly
a wolf  outside
Her eyes widen
- The Reeve hears it
He clutches an old sword
Nearby, the Merchant cowers in the brush
Adrien listens as the wolf  over and over, louder each time
The Carpenter nervously peers out from his cover
'   -  - The  is getting closer
Isabelle goes to the window, opens the shutter, cautiously peers out
and is startled by a   in the distance
- The Carpenter hears the , too
He runs toward it and finds an extinguished torch on the ground
There are footprints in the snow
And blood
The brush around him and he jumps to his feet, axe held at the ready -- -- but it's just the other Men, led by the Reeve
Who was that screaming
don't know
Look
He's gone pale
The others follow his look
There's a in the snow
The Men stare at it
Suddenly, the same  pierces the night, this time coming from deeper in the woods
The Men exchange a wary look, but then start after it
() 36
: They run into a still clearing where the snow-covered brush is as high as their waists
They pause and listen
Only silence
They carefully make their way in the direction of the screams, quiet
Frost-brittle leaves under their feet
Suddenly -- something is moving in the brush
All they can see is the snowy brush violently shaking as it darts off, almost faster than it can be followed with the eye
It races right by the Merchant, knocking him on his ass, but it's gone before he can get a look at it
He startles as the Reeve pulls him to his feet
Which way did it go
The Merchant points a trembling finger
The Reeve plunges into the brush after it and the Men follow
-  - The Reeve leads the Men to the foot of a steep and rocky hill
It's a dead end
But then they hear the again
The Men look up at the hillside
The caves
It's in the caves
- The Men stand in the mouth of a wide cave, relighting their torches
The  echoes from inside
The Carpenter raises his torch
The cave is as deep and dark as a monster's throat
The Men crowd start inside
The  continues, unnerving the Men as they approach
Then they come to a fork in the tunnel
The bounce off the stone walls
Impossible to tell where it's coming from
Split up
Two groups
Half the Men take one fork, half the other
We follow the Reeve's group down a narrowing passageway
The Men crowd together, hunched low
The  seem to be getting louder
The Reeve stops, listening
He turns toward a low crack in the cave wall
The are coming from inside
He shines his torch inside, lowers his head, and walks toward it
The cave () 37
: floor takes a steep dip
He has to keep one hand on the wall to keep from falling
Then suddenly, his feet skid on a patch of loose pebbles and he loses his footing
He slides down the steep floor, drops his torch, hands flailing, unable to stop himself, and then -- -- he finds himself falling off a low cliff into the darkness
He tumbles head over heels down a rocky slope and splashes hard in a shallow underground river
The torch rolls off the ledge above and falls on the shore amidst a shower of grit and pebbles
The Reeve gets up, grimacing in pain, grabs the torch
He shines it around
and sees Adrien
He's leaning against a rock, the ground beneath him wet with blood spreading from a dark wound between his legs
Reeve rushes to his side and crosses himself when he sees the wound
Then: a low, menacing,
He turns
There's a huge,    behind him
Adrien's pickaxe juts from between its shoulder blades
Reeve freezes, suddenly realizing that he's dropped his sword
He splashes around in the river, blindly feeling for it in the water
The wounded animal growls, blood bubbling from between its teeth
Reeve finds the sword -- -- just as the wolf attacks
-  - Silence
The sun is starting to light the sky, revealing a peacefully glistening blanket of snow on the village
The Men are returning from the woods
Isabelle and Suzette are among the Villagers breathlessly awaiting them
No way of telling whether they met with success or failure
But as they near
we can see Reeve leading the group, carrying a pike with the wolf's severed head on it
The Villagers , but the Men are weary and subdued
Suzette and Isabelle find Cesaire
He hugs them tight
Suddenly, a woman
Then they see: the Men are carrying Adrien's body on a travois
Suzette chokes back her reaction
Henri walks with the body, eyes red and cried out
He passes Isabelle without looking at her
38
'  - Henri hammers at a red-hot iron horseshoe
Isabelle enters
Henri doesn't seem to notice
hesitant beat
heard your father wounded the beast
He was a brave man
Did you hear what it did to him
It chewed off his private parts
Isabelle had not heard this
Henri doesn't stop working
And  did nothing
was too scared
couldn't move
just let my father be eaten alive
She moves toward him, but he shrugs her away
No
don't want you here
Isabelle gives him a sad look, then leaves
Henri just keeps hammering away on the anvil
- coffin is lowered into a grave
Father Auguste blesses it
Henri stands at his side
Isabelle is here with Roxanne
Lucrece eyes Isabelle, then whispers to her: thought your mother would be here
They used to be quite close
Isabelle gives her a sharp look, but Lucrece says nothing more
Isabelle looks down at the coffin with a sudden realization
'   - Suzette is soaking clothes in a bucket of lye, crying as she works
Isabelle approaches
Suzette quickly wipes her eyes
beat
Isabelle gathers her nerve, then: You told me you had a sweetheart before you were married
It was Henri's father, wasn't it
() 39
: Suzette freezes
She faces Isabelle, but doesn't answer
Lucie was in love with Henri
She could have married him
(off Suzette's look) Couldn't she have
We arranged for you to marry him
But you gained the same no matter which one of us married him
So why did it have to be me
think you know the answer to that question
No
You say it
Suzette's eyes well up
Then: Lucie was Henri's half-sister
She was not your father's daughter
Isabelle suddenly looks ill
Reluctant, she asks: Am
Do you even know
Yes
was already pregnant when your father and  married
Does he know
No
And he must never know
Tears spill down Isabelle's cheeks
She walks away
Isabelle
() Promise me you won't tell him
Isabelle gives her a look that doesn't promise much
She leaves without answering
40
'  - Grandmother ladles soup into a bowl and brings it to Isabelle
Isabelle's eyes are red from crying
've found that there's no burden that doesn't at least seem a little lighter on a full stomach
don't know what to do
She wants me to pretend like  don't know
How am  supposed to go on living in that house
You have a right to be angry with her
But try not to hate her
Too much hate will eat you alive
Isabelle nods and rests her head on Grandmother's shoulder
- As Isabelle enters the village, she hears  and Every cottage in the village is dark
Except one
Isabelle gathers her nerve and turns toward it
- Isabelle tentatively enters
There aren't many people here, just Marguerite and a few   making a lot of noise
Isabelle instantly sees what she's here for: Cesaire is slumped in a corner, drunk and passed out
'   -  - Isabelle steers Cesaire through the doorway and drops him into the bed next to Suzette
He's already half-asleep
Suzette gives Isabelle a silent look, then turns away
Isabelle sighs
She sits next to Cesaire and kisses his forehead
As she stands, he clumsily takes her hand
You're a good girl
Isabelle allows a sad smile, places his hand back on his chest, and leaves
41
-  - The wolf's head has been placed atop a stake
Children throw rocks at it
Isabelle watches with Roxanne and Prudence
heard there's going to be a festival on the night of the next full moon
To celebrate
festival
've never been to one
My father says he hasn't seen one since he was a boy
It's strange, isn't it
You think because things have been a certain way your whole life that they'll always be the same
Then overnight everything just changes
But Isabelle is distracted
Amidst the morning bustle, she sees Rosemaria laughing with Peter
Roxanne notices
Just then, they hear  approaching
lot of them
Everyone stops what they're doing, listening, suddenly apprehensive
The girls turn toward the sound and see
in identical armor, silver helmets gleaming in the sun, riding into the square atop armored steeds
The Villagers gape at them in awe
The Soldiers ride escort to a   with a red cross on it, drawn by two horses: one white, one black
rides inside, cloaked in darkness
Isabelle gives it an uneasy look
Leading the Soldiers is the    , his helmet adorned with a blood-red plume
He brings the caravan to a halt in front of the Merchant's shop
This is Villiers la CroisAe
Yes, my lord
Summon your bailiff
My master would speak with him at once
() 42
: Of course, my lord
May  ask to what does he owe this honor
He requested the services of His Eminence, the Witchfinder General
You may tell him that he has arrived
All eyes turn to the figure in the coach
Only a bejeweled hand is visible, resting on the coach's window
-  -  () Soldier places a wooden step next to the coach and another opens the door
The whole village has turned out, but they're keeping their distance
Even Attewater, standing front and center, seems uneasy
The figure emerges from the coach
grizzled man with penetrating eyes and a black beard, wearing a strange amalgam of priestly white robes and decidedly un-priestly battle armor
broadsword hangs from his hip, the hilt depicting Christ on the cross
With the sword sheathed, the cross is upside-down
This is
This is indeed an honor, Your Eminence
Solomon makes no response
His eyes are on the severed wolf's head on display
Attewater smiles proudly
As you can see, our werewolf problem has been dealt with
That is no werewolf
Surprise and outrage ripple through the crowd
Isabelle and Roxanne exchange a shocked look
When a werewolf dies, it returns to its human form
If what you killed was a werewolf, then you would have a human head skewered atop that pole
And  suppose you've seen this wolf turning into a man
() 43
: Solomon levels a look at the Reeve and slowly walks toward him
The Reeve is taller, but Solomon is, without doubt, the bigger man
The Reeve's eyes flick nervously to the armored Soldiers and their swords
beat
My wife's name was PAnAlope
She was very pretty
And we were very happy
The Reeve tries to keep the confusion off his face
Attewater and Father Auguste exchange uncertain looks
We lived in a village not unlike this place
And not unlike this place, our village was plagued by a werewolf
went out with some men to hunt it
It never even occurred to me that we might actually find it
But we did
He has everyone's attention now
All eyes are on him
It attacked me
All  saw were yellow teeth
hacked at it with an axe and suddenly it was gone
There was blood on my axe
had cut off one of its paws
picked it up and put it in my sack
() When  returned home in the morning,  found my wife with a bloody rag tied around her left wrist
And when  opened my sack, the werewolf's paw was gone
This is what  found in its place
Solomon takes an old leather sack from his belt, reaches inside
and pulls out a '   wearing a wedding ring
There are gasps from the crowd
Her name was PAnAlope
She was very pretty
And we were very happy
Until the day  killed her
Solomon turns and gives Attewater a hard look
Your werewolf is still alive
And promise you, it will kill again
44
-   - Soldiers stand at every door
Solomon and Attewater sit in front of the gathered Villagers
Solomon's Captain stands behind him
Isabelle nervously notes that the Captain wears a spiked flail
The black iron ball is shaped like a skull with spikes coming out of it
have examined the body of your blacksmith
There were bruises on his neck from where the beast held him in its jaws, squeezing his throat so that he could not scream
But he did scream
We all heard him
Only when it wanted you to
It used him as bait to lure you into the bit of theater it had prepared
Theater
My father is not playacting
He is dead
And  killed the beast that did it
That's what it wants you to think
It did kill your blacksmith
But the animal that you killed was not the werewolf
There was blood dripping from its teeth
The blood was its own
The werewolf most likely wounded it earlier in the evening and left it in the cave for you to find and kill
'Most likely,' he says
Have you ever heard anything more unlikely in your lives
() 45
: The Villagers laugh
Lucrece eyes them, disapproving
Your Eminence, if what you say is true, that we were somehow fooled by this thing, it could not have done so without foreknowledge of our plan to hunt it
That's correct
The werewolf does not live in the forest as you have rather naA vely assumed
It lives here in the village
Among you
There is a moment of shocked silence
Then mounting anger
Cesaire stands up and gestures to Henri
You come here and tell us that this boy's father died for nothing
You accuse us and call us fools
Well,  believe what can see with my own eyes
That wolf is dead
And  know it's dead because  was with the brave men who killed it
And what of the festival
The festival was to celebrate the death of the Wolf
And we say that it's dead
We've spent every full moon for the past forty years cowering in our homes
We've earned a celebration
And paid for it in blood
Attewater gives Solomon a nervous look
Solomon shrugs
Have your festival
will stay on here until then to ensure that you have the celebration you all so richly deserve
The Villagers seem appeased, especially the smug Merchant
look passes between Solomon and his Captain
Isabelle catches it
and finds it unsettling

-  - The moon sign displays the angry full moon, but it has been decorated with ribbons and mistletoe
Despite the cold, the mood in the village is happy and excited
- Solomon is anointing each of his Soldiers with holy water from a basin held by Father Auguste
Gloria Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto
Sicut erat in principio, et nunc, et sempter, et in saecula saeculorum
Amen
'   -   - Isabelle wears her best dress, her hair decorated with ribbons
Cesaire is asleep, a flask in his hand
Suzette knits

She doesn't look up from her knitting

He kisses the image of Christ on the hilt of his sword

The children chase him with sticks and he comically runs away
Isabelle watches their antics with Roxanne and Prudence
Claude is laughing and chasing the man in the wolf costume, but an   purposefully trips him
Another  steals his cap and teases him
Marguerite is too busy carousing to notice
Roxanne frowns
'm sorry

: She hurries to help Claude
Isabelle and Prudence watch
She acts more like a mother to him than a sister
Someone has to look after him

But who looks after her
Isabelle gives Roxanne a sad look
-  - The Captain of Solomon's guard stands watch
The sounds of the  can be heard in the distance
-  - Men play  and couples dance
Roxanne dances with Claude, Prudence with an
but Isabelle sits alone, watching Peter dance with Rosemaria
Just then, Henri stumbles toward Isabelle with a beer, clearly the latest of many
He follows her look and sees that she's watching Peter
Henri glares at him
then abruptly pushes his way toward Peter and grabs him roughly by the shoulder, spinning him around
Peter is surprised, but ready to laugh it off
Take it easy, friend
You didn't come with us
The night my father died
Peter's smile fades
Isabelle rushes to pull Henri away
You stayed here and let real men do the work you didn't have the belly for
Please, don't do this -- Henri brushes her aside, but too hard and she stumbles
Peter instantly grabs hold of Henri's wrist
Henri () 48
: overreacts and punches Peter in the eye
Peter falls on his ass, but the Villagers just laugh
Peter slowly stands, staring Henri down
He could easily lay Henri out
but decides against it
He leaves
Rosemaria reaches out to him, but he ignores her
Isabelle shoots Henri a look of contempt, then hurries off after Peter
Henri watches her go, ashamed
-  - Peter storms off
Isabelle runs after him
Peter
Wait
Why
So you can hit me, too
just want to make sure you're all right
Peter stops
He whirls on Isabelle, incredulous
Why can't you just leave me alone
You're bleeding
So what
What's the matter with you
What do  have to do to make you stop caring about me
Isabelle is taken aback
beat
You think  want to feel like this
You think  enjoy feeling like a fool every day because can't stop loving you
Peter's bravado falters
He can't completely hide what her words do to him
She looks up at him, realizing
Why are you with Rosemaria
You hate Rosemaria
don't have to like her to get what  want from her
() 49
: You're a terrible liar
Isabelle takes a step closer and presses the palm of her hand against his chest
beat
There
You're heart is starting to beat faster
And the little black circles in the middle of your eyes still get bigger when touch you
She gazes up at him
He tries not to look in her eyes, but can't stop himself
You can tell me you don't love me, but  know what you're really feeling
can feel it with my hand and see it with my eyes
Peter hesitates, then covers her hand with his own
thought being with Rosemaria would be the one thing you would never be able to forgive wanted you to hate me
(off her look) Isabelle, you are the best thing that could ever happen to me
And am the worst thing that could ever happen to you
How could you think that
wasn't born here
You and both know what that means
will always be a stranger to these people
Your parents will never let us be together
That means less to me now than ever
We can leave here
We can go someplace where we'll both be strangers
can't let you do that
You have something here that  will never have
You have a place
You have () () 50
: (2) (') a family
With Henri you have a future
'm not going to let you ruin that over me
The only life  want is with you
Isabelle
'm wrong for you
know you are
just don't care
She kisses him on the mouth, then quickly steps back, as if she did it before she could change her mind
Then he takes her in his arms and they kiss, long and hard
- door opens and Peter and Isabelle enter, still kissing
He closes the door, pushes her against it with his body
He lowers her to pile of straw in an empty stall
She looks up at him, surprised, then pulls him tightly to her, kissing him hard
She grabs his hand and guides it to her breast
Now Peter looks surprised
He hesitates
don't want to wait
But not like this
( ) want to marry you
She searches his face and sees that he's serious
can pack the cart tonight and we can leave in the morning
(off her look) Is that too soon
It's not soon enough
She pulls him to her and kisses him
- Peter looks outside
The coast is clear
He and Isabelle slip out and close the door behind them
() 51
: You'd better get back before someone misses you
She gives him a lingering kiss
When she pulls away from him, he sees that she's crying
What's wrong
This feels like a dream
'm afraid if  leave you  might wake up
He kisses her and holds her tight
Neither of them notice Henri, angrily watching from the shadows
-  - Isabelle returns to the festival
She sits next to Roxanne, who notices a piece of straw in Isabelle's hair
Isabelle quickly brushes it away, embarrassed
Isabelle's eyes go to the sky
The sun has finally set
The moon has risen, silver and full
Isabelle gazes up at it, transfixed
Roxanne looks over at her, curious
've never seen it full before
Suddenly -- the   start to ring
Everyone falls silent
Confused looks all around
Then, somewhere in the dark
a
The Villagers gasp
screams
People start to panic
Claude is knocked down
Claude
Then something massive pushes its way through the surging crowd, bursting from the darkness
It's
The Villagers gape in horror
It makes the wolf that they killed look like a chihuahua
But there's something about its face that isn't canine at all, but ghoulishly human as it  at the moon
Suddenly, a group of Villagers throw off their cloaks, revealing themselves to be Solomon's armored Soldiers
Each of them draws a gleaming sword and points it at the Wolf
They've been lying in wait and now they have it surrounded
The Wolf  at them
() 52
: moment later, Father Solomon gallops into the square on his armored steed, wearing a helmet adorned with a golden eagle
He tugs the reins and his horse rears back
Get to the church, you fools
The Wolf  up at him
Solomon gives a battle cry: ,
' The Wolf
Solomon and his men charge toward it
The Villagers caught between them trample one another to get away
gets knocked into the bonfire
Flaming logs fall off the pyre and set a cottage
The Wolf swipes Solomon's Soldiers aside like rag dolls
They bravely press the attack, but they're no match for the beast
It swats one of them right through the wall of a nearby cottage
The ambush has backfired
The Carpenter sees Claude on the ground and picks him up, trying to help
Claude fights and screams, but the Carpenter carries him away
Roxanne starts toward him -- -- and is bowled over by Solomon's horse
Solomon grabs the stake with the wolf's head atop it and charges at the Wolf, wielding the stake like a lance
The Wolf catches the stake in its jaws, throwing Solomon off his horse
Just as the Wolf is about to pounce on him, but more Soldiers join the fight
The Wolf sees them coming
It attacks Solomon's horse, biting its neck and dragging it to the ground
As the Soldiers close in -- -- the Wolf spins around, hurling the injured horse at them, knocking them down like bowling pins
Another Soldier tries to attack the Wolf from behind, but it smacks him aside with its tail and then smashes him to the ground with one enormous paw
Isabelle hurriedly helps Roxanne to her feet and drags her away from the ongoing battle
Where's Claude
Where is he
-  - The Carpenter runs away with Claude in his arms, but Claude bites his hand and wriggles free
Claude falls to the ground and dashes back toward the square
53
-  - Roxanne runs through town like a rat in a maze, jostled by the fleeing Villagers
Isabelle races after her
Claude
Claude
Roxanne spots Rosemaria and grabs her, begging for help
Have you seen my brother
Please
But Rosemaria just pushes her aside, panicked
An instant later -- the Wolf appears out of nowhere, jumping on Rosemaria
She screams, then --
The screams stop
Isabelle and Roxanne gape in horror, then run
-  - The Captain  the church bell
People are fleeing the village and running toward the church
-  - The few Villagers left hurry into their homes and bolt the doors behind them
search the nearly empty streets for the Wolf, swords drawn
Soldier #1 looks down
and sees bloody paw prints in the snow
He points them out to Solider #2
They follow the tracks to a corner, carefully peer around it
The Wolf is about ten feet away, loudly tearing meat from Rosemaria's body
Soldier #1 gestures for his companion to approach from the other side
They split up
Soldier #1 peers out at the Wolf
but it's gone
The street is empty
Only Rosemaria's body lying in the bloodstained snow
He ducks back around the corner
and we see that the Wolf is now right behind him
Meanwhile, Soldier #2 is stealthily making his way into position
when he suddenly hears Soldier #1
Soldier #2 quickly ducks inside a nearby cottage
- and peers out the window
He sees Soldier #1 painfully crawling through the snow, clutching a mangled and bloody wound on his shoulder
() 54
: #1 Help
Help me
Soldier #2 ducks back from the window
No way
He's not going out there
Then:
There's a shadow visible under the crack of the cottage door
And a big black snout pressed up against it, out its prey
Soldier #2 readies his sword
but then the Wolf moves away
long beat
The Soldier edges toward the door
The shadow does not return
He slowly reaches out a hand to open the door
Suddenly, the door is blasted off its hinges and the Wolf bursts inside
It stands on top of the door, pinning the Soldier beneath it
The Soldier tries to raise his sword, but can't
The Wolf  down at him, drooling
-  - The Wolf is dragging Soldier #2's body out of the cottage by the ankles when its ears suddenly prick up
It's heard something
It's being watched
It looks up
and sees Claude standing at the end of the street, paralyzed with fear
The Wolf , blood dripping from its chin
Claude runs
The Wolf leaps after him
Claude turns a corner, looks back, sees the Wolf headed right for him
Claude ducks into an alley and the Wolf follows him
/
- only to find Claude has disappeared
The Wolf follows Claude's tracks in the snow to the door of a barn and peers inside
The barn appears to be empty
but Claude is hiding in a hayloft
The Wolf the air
Pushes the door open with its nose and pads inside
Looks around
Claude shivers
But just then: (
) Claude
Claude
The Wolf cocks its ears toward the voice, listening
-  - Isabelle and Roxanne are the last stragglers, Roxanne looking for Claude, Isabelle trying to stop her
() 55
: Claude
Where are you
Isabelle drags her to the ground and covers her mouth
You have to stop it
He can't hear you and you are going to get us killed
Do you understand me
Roxanne nods, crying
Isabelle helps her up -- and finds herself face-to-face with the Wolf
Roxanne screams
They run back the way they came, turn another corner -- -  - -- but the narrow alley is blocked by a high stone wall
Come on
Isabelle climbs the wall, but Roxanne's not going to make it
Isabelle jumps down to help her
just as the Wolf's shadow falls over the alley
The girls watch helplessly as the Wolf slowly walks toward them,  and glaring at them with its strange, near- human eyes
Then, inexplicably
the Wolf speaks
Well, well
You look very pretty this evening, my dear
Good enough to eat
The Wolf's voice is sonorous, seductive
The Devil's voice
Isabelle stammers, unable to believe her senses
It's considered polite to thank someone when they pay you a compliment
Are you being impolite, Isabelle
How do you know me
Who are you
Isabelle
The Wolf , cutting her off, and turns back to Isabelle
It moves closer
Isabelle looks into its eyes
They suddenly seem very big and deep, almost hypnotizing
She seems to fall into them
() 56
: What big eyes you have
The better to see you with, my dear
Are you going to kill us
Kill you
Why would  kill you
Then what do you want
want you, Isabelle
Isabelle gapes, dumbstruck and dismayed
We are the same, you and
We are both wild things
You show one face to the world, but there is another face that you hide fire burning inside you, waiting to be released
The Wolf sniffs her, starting at her feet and working its way up
It  with satisfaction, savoring her scent
Yes
can smell it on you even now
Suddenly, the Wolf jumps onto its hind legs, puts its forepaws on the wall on either side of Isabelle, its muzzle only inches from her face
She recoils
Leave with me tonight
Run with me
The only shackles binding you are of your own making
Slip them and  can show you the world and every pleasure in it
Isabelle hesitates, then finds the strength to speak: don't know who you are, but we are not the same
would rather die than go with you
() 57
: (2) What about your fat friend here
Do you think she would rather die
(off Isabelle's look) Come away with me
Or  will kill her
And  will keep killing until you agree to leave with me
Suddenly, the sound of
The Wolf leans in, Isabelle turns away from its foul breath
Choose now
Quickly
Isabelle trembles
She looks down at Roxanne's terrified face, torn
Isabelle closes her eyes
She can't do it
Your silence has doomed them all
Just then, Solomon and two Soldiers turn the corner
The Wolf leaps atop the wall and growls down at Isabelle: Come the next full moon, their blood will be on your hands
Then it jumps over the wall
Solomon scrabbles up after it, but the Wolf is already too far away
It looks back at him
silent challenge passes between them
And then the Wolf is gone
- Solomon and his Soldiers bring Isabelle and Roxanne inside
crowd of panicked Villagers swarms to Solomon
We are safe here
God protects his own house and those within it
Isabelle finds Prudence
Is Peter here
Peter
don't think so
What about Claude
Or my parents
haven't seen any of them
() 58
: Would you look for them
Please
Prudence nods and rushes off
Roxanne slumps in a corner, a dazed look on her face
beat
You talked to it
It talked to us
chill runs down Roxanne's spine
long beat
No
It only growled
(off Isabelle's look) You heard it talk to you
Isabelle doesn't know what to say
She glances around to see if anyone has overheard
Then: Do not speak of this to anyone
Roxanne nods, but eyes Isabelle warily
Isabelle turns away, afraid and confused
- Silence
The door  open and the Merchant peers out
blanket of new snow covers the village
It's as if the massacre of the night before never happened
'   -   - Isabelle hurries inside
Embers burn in the fire pit chair has been overturned
The room is empty
Mother
Father
'   -  - Isabelle bursts in to find Suzette lying in bed and Cesaire leaning over her, crying
Isabelle stops short
Is she dead
No, thank God
() 59
: He sits up, revealing Suzette's face, which has been horribly slashed from scalp to chin
Isabelle recoils
-  - The Villagers slowly gather
Dead bodies litter the snow
Roxanne clutches Prudence's arm
Henri joins them
Father Auguste crouches next to Soldier #1
This man is alive
( ) Bring me water
Hurry
Henri nods and quickly turns -- but is stopped cold by Solomon's iron grip on his arm
Solomon and his Captain go to Soldier #1
Solomon kneels at his side
Are you bitten
Shivering, the Soldier nods
The Captain closes his eyes
Solomon stands and turns to Father Auguste
Step back
Confused, Father Auguste does as he's told
Then, before anyone can react, Solomon draws his sword and plunges it into the Soldier's heart
Everyone startles
The werewolf's bite is the same as death to a man
Stunned silence
Solomon turns to the Villagers
The dark days have returned to your village
Your homes are no longer safe
The Wolf will return
Again and again
And it will not stop until it has sucked the marrow from all your bones
Unless you stop it
() But to kill a monster, you must become one yourself
wolf caught in a trap will chew off its own leg to save itself
Will you do the same
What sacrifice will you make to save your families and your way of life
Will you do whatever it takes
Or will you () () 60
: (') cower in your beds and die like sheep
long beat
The Villagers shiver and not just from the cold
But no one speaks
Solomon turns to Attewater
It appears my expertise is not as appreciated as  was led to believe
He turns to leave
Suddenly, Attewater steps forward
Wait
Attewater drops to one knee
Solomon stops and gives him an appraising look
Then Solomon turns to the Villagers
After a moment, the Reeve drops to his knee
One by one, the Villagers kneel to Solomon
Henri and Father Auguste are among the last, but they reluctantly kneel as well
We will do what must be done
beat
Then Solomon offers his hand
Attewater kisses Solomon's ring
Henri and Roxanne exchange uneasy looks
'  - There's an urgent knock at the door
Peter quickly opens it
It's Isabelle
He ushers her inside
As soon as the door is shut, he takes her in his arms
She gives him a concerned look
He looks tired, drawn and pale
was up all night worrying about you
Thank God you're safe
But something about her expression gives him pause
She looks up at him, struggling with what she has to say
Peter
My mother's hurt can't leave
Not now
thought you didn't want to wait
don't have any choice
It's not just my mother
Something else happened last night
(off his look) () () 61
: (') can't tell you about it
just have to stay
Peter nods, but his face darkens
long, tense beat
meant everything  said
This isn't what  wanted
Of course not
You'd better go home and see to your mother
She gives him a sad nod, then turns to go
She pauses at the door, but he doesn't look at her
She leaves
-   - Solomon places his silver sword on the table in front of Attewater and Father Auguste
Silver
This is our most potent weapon
One blow will kill it
() That sword has tasted the blood of many such creatures
But never one as powerful as this
If it's that powerful, how can we possibly hope to stop it
We must find it in its human form
Who among you do you suspect
Attewater and Father Auguste trade uncomfortable looks
Neither of them wants to speak up first
It has not survived this long by being obvious
The signs will be subtle
Insomnia
Restlessness
Strange behavior
Strange smells
(off their looks) Well, none of them smell good, but we must start somewhere
What about the hair Madame Ordeville found on Lucie's body
It was dark
The person we are looking for must have dark hair
() 62
: Perhaps
Unless it planted the hair to make us think that
Yes, it's trying to trick us again
This has been happening for forty years
It must be an old man by now
The hair should have been gray
Not necessarily
It may be the child or grandchild of the werewolf that first struck here
The curse is hereditary
It is
But it effects men and women differently
man can inherit the curse
Or he can be turned simply by being bitten
Solomon turns toward the fire and stares into it
But women are immune to the werewolf's bite
In order for a woman to be turned, she must inherit the curse
But even then it will lie dormant unless she eats human flesh
Only then will the bite of a male werewolf change her
Only then can she become a werewolf and capable of passing the curse on to her own children
But it could be a woman
Of course
It could be any one of you
Attewater and Father Auguste exchange a wary look
-  - The mood of the village is grim
Isabelle meets Roxanne at the crossroads
Roxanne eyes her warily
beat
() 63
: Has Claude come home
No
Nobody has seen him
He's run away before
He'll be all right
Roxanne nods, unconvinced
Prudence joins them
They all exchange a sad look
Well
suppose this is all of us
The three of them turn and start toward the woods
'  - Isabelle and Grandmother sit by the fire
It talked to you
And you understood it
As clearly as  do you now
Grandmother fixes her with a serious look
beat
Word of this cannot be allowed to spread
Do you understand me
Roxanne will never speak of it
She won't even talk to me about it
long beat
Isabelle is working up her nerve
Then: have to do what it wants
(off her look) have communed with an unholy beast
What does that make me if not cursed
don't know
But  won't allow you to go with this devil and live as its concubine
() 64
: But if it comes back for me and don't go with it, then it will kill again
If  have the power to save even one life, aren't compelled to do so
This is why it chose you
You're a good girl with a gentle heart
It's using that against you
But how could it
Unless it really does know me
Isabelle and Grandmother exchange an anxious look
'   - Isabelle is walking home through the snow
Henri is waiting for her
beat
Then: spoke with your father
broke off our engagement
(off her look) saw you with Peter
Don't worry,  didn't tell anyone
Isabelle can't hide her shock
She shifts anxiously
What about my family's debt
have no interest in ruining your family
will have you out of love or not at all
Isabelle is dumbfounded
Henri turns and walks away
'   -   - Isabelle is cooking, lost in thought
Suddenly, there's a  at the door
Isabelle opens it
It's Prudence
They've caught the werewolf
65
-  - Prudence leads Isabelle and Cesaire through the village
There are   up ahead
He's been hiding in a hayloft
They caught him trying to steal food
But who is it
An angry crowd has gathered
Solomon's Soldiers are all that's stopping it from turning into a lynch mob
Isabelle finds Roxanne in tears, trying to force her way through the crowd
What's wrong
What's happening
Roxanne doesn't answer, just plunges into the crowd
Isabelle goes in after her
Cesaire tries to stop her
Isabelle
Get away from there
She follows Roxanne to the front of the crowd, just as two Soldiers haul a figure out of a barn -- it's Claude
Claude
It's not him
It can't be
If he's not the werewolf, then why was he hiding
What's he afraid of
The Soldiers carry Claude off and Roxanne stumbles after them
Isabelle tries to follow, but Cesaire stops her
She can only watch helplessly as Claude is dragged away
- Villagers are gathering
The whole town must be here
As Attewater approaches the entrance: (
) Salus populi suprema est lex
() 66
: He turns and sees Grandmother walking toward him
She nods to the inscription above the entrance
' ' The good of the people is the chief law
You read Latin
And write
was studying to be a nun when  met my husband
He must have been some man
He was a priest
She grins
Is she being serious
Attewater bristles
You know the boy is innocent
He's being tried because he's different
Because Father Solomon knows he can turn us against him
Father Solomon is here to protect us
wolf hunting sheep picks off the weakest ones first
(off his look) This is just the beginning
She enters the manor hall
Attewater watches her go
-   - The room is crammed with Villagers
Isabelle sits with Cesaire and Grandmother
Attewater sits behind the table
Claude is shackled and guarded by Soldiers
He looks afraid, confused
Solomon questions Lucrece records the proceedings
You say you saw the accused perform magic
() 67
: In broad daylight with my own eyes
Everyone here has seen it
So it was common knowledge that the accused was a conjurer
Yes, Your Eminence
saw it for the Devil's work, but they laughed at me and paid him money
Isabelle and Grandmother exchange a concerned look
Through a   , more witnesses are questioned: shifts uncomfortably as Solomon interrogates him
Are you aware that it is the custom of witches and devil worshippers to hold their black sabbaths in cemeteries
Yes, Your Eminence
And do you know of their practice of dancing with invisible devils during these rituals
have heard it said so, yes
Is there one here today who you have seen dancing in your cemetery
(hesitant; a beat) Yes
But  don't believe he meant anything by it
It was in jest
So you consider the black mass to be a jest
There are suspicious  among the Villagers
Father Auguste eyes them nervously
beat
() 68
: No, of course not
Then point him out
Father Auguste reluctantly points to Claude
Roxanne weeps as her mother testifies against Claude
What is your relationship to the accused
am his mother
And where is his father
don't know, sir
Well, what is his name
She pauses
The crowd eyes her, disapproving
beat
never learned his name, sir
You say a man whose name you cannot recall is the father of your child
What can you tell us about him
Not much, sir
She lowers her eyes, ashamed
Solomon considers her
Almost as if it were a dream
(off her look) Certain devils called incubi can collect human semen and then transfer it to women as they sleep
woman who unwittingly conceives in this manner would not be a whore
She would be blameless in the eyes of God
() 69
: Marguerite's eyes spark, suddenly hopeful
You remember almost nothing of the man who impregnated you
Is it not possible that there was no man
That the accused is not the product of your own sin, but the foul offspring of a werewolf whose semen was placed in you by an incubus while you slept
Yes
Yes,  remember now
He came to me in my sleep
It wasn't my fault
God save me, it wasn't my fault
Roxanne buries her face in her hands
-   -  () Solomon addresses the gathered Villagers
We have proven here today that behind this veil of feigned idiocy is the fiend that has plagued your village
However, in order for the sentence of death to be carried out, the Church requires either a confession or the testimony of a witness who has seen the accused in his transformed state
Since the accused has refused to confess, this court calls upon its final witness
Isabelle Ordeville
Isabelle is stunned
All eyes turn toward her
-   -  () Isabelle stands before Solomon
Claude waves
She ignores him
On the night of the last full moon, you were attacked by the Wolf
You looked it in the eye
And the one thing a werewolf can never change is its eyes
() 70
: He gestures to the Soldiers
They grab Claude and force him to look at her
Look into his eyes, my child
Do you see the beast in them
Isabelle gives Claude a pitying look
Solomon watches, expectant
Then: It isn't him
It can't be
He was with us when the Wolf attacked
Solomon is taken aback
Surprised  in the room
Is this true
Is there another here who can speak to this
can
It's true
saw him
She's his sister
She'll say anything
The suspicious Villagers agree
Roxanne gives Isabelle a desperate look
Then Isabelle spots the Carpenter
He was there
He carried Claude away
He saved his life
Suddenly, all eyes are on the Carpenter
He shrinks back
He glances at his
She stares at him
Hard
She is mistaken
did no such thing
Isabelle is shocked
She looks to the other Villagers, but no one will speak up
Solomon frowns
Very well
Since no one here can bear witness, we must extort a confession
This court shall reconvene tomorrow at dawn
Solomon leaves
Claude is dragged out of the room by Soldiers
Isabelle gives Grandmother a helpless look
71
'   -   - Isabelle and Grandmother sit at the table
Cesaire is in the other room feeding Suzette
Why wouldn't Father Solomon listen to me
Doesn't he care that Claude isn't guilty
He'd rather let an innocent boy die than risk letting the Wolf go free
But the Wolf is free
And the moon will be full in two days
The full weight of this hits home
Grandmother leans close, lowers her voice
We both know it will be coming for you
You must leave here tomorrow and never return
long beat
Isabelle reluctantly shakes her head
cannot leave
You have no choice
The alternative is unthinkable
What is unthinkable is that should be responsible for the deaths of everyone that  love
'd rather spend a lifetime of misery than let that happen
The Wolf's sins are on its own twice-damned soul, not yours
But what if it was you it wanted
Would you go with it to save me
Or would you leave me to die
Grandmother doesn't have a fast answer for that
Suddenly, a ,   echoes in the night
Isabelle and Grandmother exchange a grave look
72
'   - Grandmother and Isabelle step outside, followed by Cesaire
The  can be heard more clearly
Father Solomon
Extorting his confession
Claude's screams sending chills down their spines
You should have condemned him today
At least it would have been quick
Cesaire turns and goes back inside
Isabelle and Grandmother continue to listen
'   - Roxanne weeps with her hands clamped around her ears, trying to block out the
Her mother sits by the fire as if nothing unusual is going on
How can you just sit there and listen to this
Marguerite ignores her
Furious, Roxanne stands up and grabs Marguerite's coin purse
Where are you going with that
Roxanne doesn't answer, just pulls on her cloak
Marguerite grabs her, but Roxanne turns and shoves her to the ground
Marguerite starts to get up, but Roxanne snatches a knife from off the table and points it at her
Don't you touch me again
Ever
Roxanne angrily throws the knife aside and leaves
-  - fire burns underneath a 'Brazen Bull,' a hollow, life- size bull made of brass
The fire heats the metal to almost red-hot
Claude's screams come from inside it
Solomon glowers, frustrated
Attewater looks sick
() 73
: Enough of this
Let's eat
He gestures to the Scribe, who hands Attewater a document
What is this
statement declaring that you heard the boy confess
All it requires is your signature
Or your mark, if you cannot write
But he has not confessed
How could he have
Solomon studies Attewater
beat
Solomon shrugs
Very well
Listen more carefully this time
He gestures for the Soldiers to throw more wood on the fire
The  leap higher
Attewater goes pale
All he hears are screams
Solomon stands next to the bull
The flames gleam off the brass, casting him in hellfire
Listen to how he sings of his love of Satan
How he despairs that he will never again copulate with the dead or sink his teeth into the flesh of pregnant women and eat their unborn children
Attewater gives Solomon a horrified look, suddenly realizing
Father Solomon is insane
Stop this
No
You stop it
(off his look) We both know he is guilty
But cannot legally execute him without a witness or a confession
Sign this and we have a confession
Attewater glares at Solomon, then angrily signs the document
Solomon gestures to his Soldiers, who open the bull and pull Claude out
Attewater has to look away
() 74
: (2) Suddenly, Solomon grabs Attewater by his collar, drags him across the room, and forces him to look at Claude
Thankfully, we do not see him, except in deep f
g
His naked flesh is actually smoking
Attewater cringes
This is the business of werewolf hunting and you had best develop a stomach for it
Because where there is one werewolf, there are two
And where there are two, there are more
() This is only the beginning
Solomon throws him to the floor and leaves
Attewater trembles helplessly as Claude is dragged out of the room
-   - Solomon is eating dinner
The Captain enters
girl to see you
Well, 've yet to come across a girl  wouldn't at least look at
The Captain ushers Roxanne inside
She meekly steps forward
beat
assume you came here with a purpose
She hurriedly empties Marguerite's purse on the table in front of Solomon
mere handful of coins
would like to bargain for the release of my brother
Your brother has just confessed
What
That's not possible
It has been witnessed and notarized
He will hang in the morning
() 75
: Roxanne stands frozen, gathering her courage for what she is about to say
Realizing that she has no choice
have more than money to offer you
She raises a trembling hand and starts to open her bodice, but Solomon interrupts
What do you think you are doing
(off her look) Do you have any idea who  am am the Witchfinder General have fought in the Holy Land have waded hip deep in blood and resisted all the temptations of the infidels
And you seek to stay the hand of justice with such a tawdry bribe
Leave here, girl, before  have you whipped
Solomon gestures for the Soldiers and they forcibly drag her away
Roxanne struggles against them
Wait
have something else know the name of a witch
Solomon looks up sharply
The Soldiers stop
Solomon crosses the room and stands glaring down at Roxanne
She cringes
This is the hardest decision of her life
Spare my brother and  will tell you her name
'   -  - Isabelle and her parents are jolted from their sleep by Soldiers barging into their home
One of them climbs into the loft and yanks Isabelle out of bed
Cesaire leaps to his feet, but is viciously beaten down
Suzette screams
The Soldiers drag Isabelle away
-   - Isabelle is thrown to the floor, the door  behind her
She huddles against the wall, shivering
() 76
: Then:  low  in the dark
Isabelle startles
She looks up, her eyes going wide in disgust and horror
It's Claude
He's locked in a man-shaped cage, his body covered with hideous burns
He moans again
Isabelle chokes back her disgust and goes to him
She lightly takes his hand, shaken to her soul at the sight of him
-   - The chamber is full again
Cesaire, Grandmother, Prudence, and Henri are here
Peter sits in the last row
Isabelle is in the seat of the accused
Roxanne stands witness
She's trying not to look at Isabelle
How are you acquainted with the accused
We were friends
And how long did this friendship last
All my life
And in this time, have you ever known the accused to converse with devils
Yes, Your Eminence
On the night of the last full moon, she talked to the werewolf
And later she told me that it also talked to her
Isabelle gives Grandmother a frightened look
Cesaire clenches his fist
Solomon turns to Isabelle
What of this
Do you deny having conversed with a werewolf
She looks to Roxanne, who trembles with emotion
Then: No
do not deny it
The crowd
Solomon quiets them with a look
() 77
: Describe this encounter
It spoke, just as a man speaks
And what was the nature of your conversation with it
Isabelle hesitates
Grandmother holds her breath
It told me
It promised to leave here and never return
But only if  leave with it
Roxanne gives her a stunned look
heavy silence falls over the room
Even Solomon is surprised
Then: But who is it
Make her tell us who the werewolf is
don't know
swear  don't know
It doesn't matter who it is anymore
It wants her, not us
Let's just give it what it wants
long, tense beat
Heavy silence
Nobody speaks
We should not allow ourselves to even consider this
think we already are
What's the matter with you
You know her
You all know her
Do we
Did we know she could talk to werewolves
She could have run away
She could saved herself, but she stayed here because she cares more about you than she does herself
() 78
: (2) Peter reacts
He and Isabelle exchange a look
Now he understands
If she stayed, she did so because she is in league with it
Let this be her punishment
The crowd loudly
Solomon considers
Grandmother gives Attewater a dark look
Then: Very well
Isabelle Ordeville, in light of your willing confession, it is the decision of this court that on the night of the next full moon, you be left to the mercy of the werewolf
Cesaire silently buries his face in his hands
No
Henri bursts to his feet, turning heads
Isabelle is led away
Roxanne can only watch, helpless and ashamed
-  - Lucrece has drawn a small crowd around the well
Prudence pauses to hear what she's saying
The first victim was her sister
The second was her fiancAe's father
Then Rosemaria, who everyone knows she hated
And don't forget her mother, with half her face missing
All this death around one girl
Prudence has heard enough
She turns away
- Roxanne approaches
The Captain eyes her, questioning
'm here for my brother
He gestures
Roxanne turns
and sees Claude's body dangling from a makeshift gallows
He's been hanged
() 79
: Roxanne falls to her knees
The rope around Claude's neck  as his body sways in the wind
-   - Isabelle stands at the barred door
Grandmother is on the other side
They speak in furtive whispers
'm not going to let these worthless shits sacrifice you to save themselves
We have to find the real werewolf before tomorrow night
That's impossible
Even Father Solomon doesn't have the first clue
Father Solomon doesn't know the things that  know
(off Isabelle's look) am the oldest person in this village who was here when the Wolf first came
remember the old days
And what is happening now is much worse
What was it like in the old days
The Wolf never used to attack in the open like it did at the festival
It's a coward at heart
It would kill whole families in their homes, but it always stayed in the shadows
It never would have shown itself in the old days
It's grown bold
Or perhaps it made a mistake
() You're at the center of this
At least two of the victims can be tied to you
What if it had to kill so many at the festival to hide the fact that the first two killings weren't random
() 80
: Isabelle considers this
beat as she realizes
But who would want to kill Lucie
Your parents said that the Wolf broke into the house and took Lucie
We both know that's not true
What really happened
Isabelle hesitates, reluctant
My mother made me swear  would never speak of it
() Lucie went to the Wolf willingly
Grandmother reacts, horrified
Why would you think such a thing
She was in love with Henri
She took her own life over a boy
What other explanation is there
Grandmother thinks
The pieces are fitting together
- Grandmother knocks on a door
Henri answers
Hello, Henri
- Henri is in the midst of shoeing a horse
Grandmother stands by the door, watching him
You spoke up very loudly in Isabelle's defense today
That was very brave

: just said what  felt
You're under no obligation to stand in her defense
You broke off your engagement to her
never stopped caring about her
would do anything for Isabelle
As her sister would have done anything for you
(off his look) Lucie was in love with you
But you knew that, didn't you
had no control over the way she felt
She kept it secret from almost everyone
Even Isabelle didn't know
Did you tell anyone
Never
Not even your father
didn't have to tell him
So he knew your secrets, did he
Henri picks up a hammer and goes back to work
Angrily nailing a shoe to the horse's foot
You were the only one who could have lured Lucie out on the Wolf's night
And none of the men who went hunting for the Wolf remember seeing you after the sun set on the night your father died
Henri faces her, clutching the hammer
Why are you doing this
() 82
: (2) Because  want you to confess
You killed Lucie
And your father
And God only knows how many others
And if you won't admit it, then  will tell Father Solomon and we will lock you up until the moon rises tomorrow night and you can no longer hide your guilt
As she says this, a slow look of dawning realization comes over him
Realization and horror
It's you
Henri steps closer to her, menacing
Grandmother steps back and finds herself bumping against the closed door
My God, it's you
You're the Wolf
can smell it on you now
Smell what
What are you talking about
The night my father died
saw the Wolf pass by, dragging him by the neck
was so terrified couldn't move or make a sound remember every detail of that moment
The way the moonlight gleamed off the Wolf's coat
The soundless way it moved
even remember the way it smelled thick, greasy, musky stink
() And  can smell it on you right now
beat
They stand frozen
Glaring at one another
You accuse me and 'll bring you down with me
All they can do is take my life
You have more to lose
But who do you think they'll believe
'm the blacksmith
() () 83
: (3) (') They know me
You're the crazy old woman who lives in the woods
Then 'll have to prove it
Unless you can, you'd best keep your mouth shut
Another beat
stand-off
Grandmother's hand finds the door handle
She turns it, stumbling outside -- - -- and practically runs right into Cesaire
She startles, gives him a surprised, flustered look
Are you ready for me to take you home
She looks back
Henri stands in the doorway, still holding the hammer
She eyes him, measuring, suddenly hesitant
Cesaire gives them both an uncertain look
-  - Cesaire and Grandmother ride in a horse-drawn cart
The moon is almost full
Up ahead, Grandmother sees Prudence with a group of Villagers listening to Lucrece
Stop the cart
Cesaire pulls the reins
Grandmother calls out: Prudence, come with me
have some blankets  want you to mend for Father Auguste
Prudence sighs and climbs up into the cart
'  - The cart stops out front
Grandmother turns to Prudence
You take these blankets to Father Auguste the moment you're finished
Understand
() 84
: All right
Cesaire helps Grandmother out of the cart
'  - Grandmother hands Cesaire a stack of knitted blankets
He has tears in his eyes
Will you want a ride into town tomorrow
To say goodbye to her
Yes
First thing in the morning
He nods shakily and leaves
She closes the door behind him and lets the faAade of calm fall from her face
She puts a trembling hand to her mouth, mind racing
-  - The Villagers go about their daily activities, but nobody speaks
The Herald hangs the full moon sign
Full moon
Full moon
Full moon
'  - Morning sunlight glints off the frozen brook
flock of are startled from their roosts and take flight
'  - Grandmother sits at the table, writing a letter in Latin with a quill
She doesn't notice the veil that separates her bedchamber rippling, as if in a gentle breeze
Suddenly, she hears
She looks up
The veil is still
She stands and pokes the ashes of the fire with her cane, her back to the veil
and changes her grip on the cane
To wield it as a weapon
Glancing back, she sees the veil move again
Suddenly, she whirls around and swings her cane at the veil, sweeping through it three times without hitting anything
beat
() 85
: Show yourself
Coward
Another beat
The veil settles and is still
Then: lunges out of the veil with its arms reaching out at us
It grabs Grandmother's throat in one hand and wrestles the cane from her grip with the other
She struggles, but she's far too weak for her attacker
The Figure whips out a knife
Grandmother sees it, but can do nothing
The knife flashes
Fat drops of blood splash on the floor
Then the Figure drops Grandmother and she crumples, lifeless
pool of blood slowly spreads out from underneath her
The Figure steps over the widening pool and picks up the letter Grandmother was writing
He quickly scans it and angrily tosses it in the fire
Then he hears something
, crunching through the snow
He hurries to the window and peers out
It's Roxanne and Prudence
Roxanne looks like hell, but here for lessons as usual
The Figure ducks out of sight
moment later, they're  on the door
Their feet are visible under the crack
The Figure sidles alongside the door,  heavily
Another
On the floor inside, the pool of blood is expanding toward the door
The Figure sees it
He puts a hand on the hilt of his knife
then whispers to the girls through the door, disguising his voice with a dry, old woman's rasp: Go away
Outside, Roxanne and Prudence exchange a curious look
Are you all right
'm sick
You can't come in
You sound awful
Would you like us to make you something
No
You mustn't come in
Go home, now
want to sleep
() 86
: (2) The blood is flowing right toward the door
In about thirty seconds, the girls will be standing in it
Outside, Prudence and Roxanne exchange a look
then turn and walk away
The Figure breathes a sigh of relief and takes his hand away from the knife
But then Roxanne stops
And looks back
The Figure secretly watches from the window
Roxanne walks back to the cottage
The blood is about to run under the door
The Figure grabs the door handle and readies the knife
Roxanne stands on the doorstep
Are you sure you don't want us to bring you something
No, my dear
Come back tomorrow
The blood is seconds away from hitting her feet
The Figure stands poised to throw open the door
but at the last instant, Roxanne turns and walks away
She doesn't see the blood pour outside under the door behind her
-   - Isabelle has fallen asleep on the bed of straw
She's startled awake by the sound of her   opening
It's Father Auguste
've come to hear your final confession
Isabelle nods shakily and sits up
He enters
Has there been any word from my grandmother
None that  have heard
Why
Isabelle doesn't answer
She turns away, troubled
- Peter anxiously waits outside, half-hidden in a copse of trees
runs up to him from the house
() 87
: She's still in the dungeon
They're going to move her at sunset
Peter tosses the Boy a coin
The Boy runs off
Peter looks at the stone house, his eyes hard and determined
-  - Attewater walks with Father Solomon
We've hanged the werewolf
Why not let the girl go free
told you, Bailiff
Where there is one werewolf, there are more
And the girl is the bait for our trap
Father Solomon strides off
Attewater watches him go
-  - Villagers are already gathering
The Merchant looks up at the sun
It's now dipping beneath the rooftops
'  - Peter knocks on the door
Henri opens it
He eyes Peter dubiously
need your help
Off Henri's look
- Attewater hurriedly enters and looks around
Nobody here except the  and Cesaire slumped in a chair, a jug of beer in his hand
Attewater goes to Cesaire
Where is your mother
don't know
went to pick her up this morning and she was gone
() 88
: Attewater reacts, concerned
Cesaire takes another drink
Attewater angrily knocks it out of his hand
Stop pouring that swill down your gullet listen to me
Cesaire emerges from his drunken fog and shoots him a dangerous look, but Attewater doesn't shy from it
She was trying to find the werewolf
If she figured out who it is,  need to know now
Suddenly, the door bursts open and the Captain enters, flanked by Soldiers
They drag Cesaire to his feet
Wait
What has he done
It's just a precaution
Father Solomon doesn't want the girl's family interfering
Suddenly, Cesaire pulls a club out of his boot and hits the Captain across the back, knocking him to his knees
Cesaire hits him again, then he's wrestled to the ground
The Captain kicks Cesaire in the face and knocks him out
The Soldiers drag him away
Attewater watches them go
-   - Soldiers haul Cesaire's unconscious body downstairs
Isabelle watches as they throw him in another cell
What have you done to him
Then: Isabelle's cell is opened
The Captain is holding iron manacles
Isabelle looks at them, horrified
The Soldiers clap her in irons
This is really happening
(
) Isabelle
He's coming to
Isabelle breaks away from the Soldiers, runs to his cell, and holds his hands through the bars
love you so much
Tell Mama and Grandmother that  love them
() 89
: love you, my angel
You don't know how much
The Soldiers pull Isabelle away and lead her up the stairs
Cesaire shakes his cell door with impotent rage
Bastards
- Isabelle is chained to the back of Solomon's coach
The Captain approaches with a 'humiliation mask': an iron mask that locks in place over the head with only tiny holes to see out of
This one is shaped to look like a wolf's head
Isabelle goes pale at the sight of it
then the Captain puts it over her head
Inside the mask: almost total darkness
The Captain locks it on
-  - Solomon's coach lurches through the snow and slush
Isabelle trudges along behind it
The Villagers line the road to watch as she is dragged stumbling through the streets in her horrific iron wolf mask
Lucrece sneers
Not so pretty now, is she
The Villagers do not answer
Henri is here, silently fuming
Prudence stands next to him
She looks around
Where's Peter
haven't seen him
-  - Solomon, Attewater, and Father Auguste stand next to the stocks
As a crowd of anxious Villagers watches, Isabelle is placed in the stocks with the mask still on
We, Bailiff Attewater, Father Auguste, and Father Solomon of Avignon, having in mind that you, Isabelle Ordeville of Villiers la CroisAe in the Diocese of Saint- () () 90
: (') Flour, by your own confession, have committed acts of vulgar heresy, convict you of the sins of witches and condemn you to the mercy of werewolf
This is the sentence given
Solomon walks away and Attewater reluctantly follows
Through the holes in the mask, Isabelle sees Father Auguste make the sign of the cross and sadly turn away
Help
Father Auguste stops
The Villagers shift uncomfortably as her helpless voice calls out from inside the mask
Help me
Please
Help me
The Villagers start to leave, ashamed
Isabelle sees them going
and suddenly
' The Villagers startle
She  again, struggling against the stocks
But no one comes to her aid
'   -  - Isabelle's  can be heard from here
Roxanne lies in her bed, sobbing her heart out
-  -  () Almost everyone has left
Isabelle slumps in the stocks, silent and exhausted
Father Auguste sadly walks away, leaving only Prudence
She nervously approaches
Isabelle
Can you hear me
can hear you
Roxanne wanted you to know how sorry she is
She only said those things to save her brother
() 91
: know
Will you tell her that forgive her
Of course
() wanted to say
don't know what to say
You don't have to say anything
want to
() want you to know that you may have fooled Roxanne, but you don't fool me
Not anymore
You were always too good
Too pretty
Nobody could be as perfect as you
You tricked us
And now you're going to get what you deserve
beat
Isabelle responds, surprisingly gentle: think you'd better go now
Prudence looks up
The sun has almost set
Yes
It won't be long now
The Captain crouches in the shadows of a nearby barn
He watches Prudence leave
Solomon and Attewater join him
No one shoots until  give the order
Attewater glances outside and sees Soldiers armed with longbows hidden all around the square
The Captain draws an arrow from his quiver
It's tip is made of silver
-  - The streets are empty
The   has risen
92
-  -  - Isabelle is now alone
The streets are empty
Around the square, Soldiers stand in tense silence, ready with arrows strung on their bows
Attewater shifts nervously
Suddenly: a long, ululating
Isabelle gasps
The Soldiers ready their bows
Attewater shrinks back
Another
Closer now
Isabelle tries to pull her hands out of the stocks
Then: Solomon spots something
There
The Captain and Attewater follow his look is stealing through the shadows toward Isabelle
Hold your fire
Isabelle frantically tries to free herself, her wrists torn and bleeding, but it's no use
Then, suddenly -- -- something  into the stocks
She can't see what it is
The stocks are hit again
Isabelle screams
Suddenly, the Shape moves into her field of view: (
) Hey
Stop it
It's me
Isabelle's eyes go wide
The Black Shape crouches and looks in at Isabelle through the eyeholes
It's Henri
Get away from me
'm not the Wolf
The moon is out
Look,  haven't turned
Isabelle realizes
He's right
It couldn't be him
'm trying to get you out of this
Yes
Yes, please hurry
Solomon and his men watch as Henri uses a hammer and chisel to break open the stocks
He's going to free her
Then: another
Almost on top of them
() 93
: Patience
It's close now
Henri brings the hammer down again and again and --
The lock is cleaved in two
Henri throws the stock open and helps Isabelle out of the mask
She looks like hell
Can you stand
Isabelle nods
In the loft: Kill him
Attewater gives Solomon a horrified look
The Captain strings an arrow and draws it back, taking aim
Suddenly, Attewater pushes him aside, spoiling the shot
The arrow whizzes by Henri's head
Attewater calls out: Isabelle and Henri see him -- just as Solomon plunges a dagger into his back
Henri drags Isabelle to her feet and they run away, arrows  all around them
Solomon scowls as he watches them escape
-  - Henri leads Isabelle as they run through the village
We have to get to the stable
Peter left his cart for us
Peter
Where is he --
It doesn't matter
Come on
- The Captain and his Soldiers have picked up a few followers
They're raising the alarm
is forming
The witch has escaped
The witch has escaped
94
- Henri leads Isabelle around the back and helps her into a cart that is waiting for them and unhitches the horse
-  - Henri and Isabelle take off through the village in the cart
but then they hear a  behind them
They look back
The Wolf emerges from the darkness, chasing after them
Henri whips the horse, urging it to go faster
They start to pull away from the Wolf, but then it veers off into the village and disappears
It's gone
don't think so
Just then, they pass by the Reeve and a group of Villagers
The Villagers start to give chase, but Isabelle and Henri quickly leave them behind
Meanwhile, the Wolf is shortcutting through the village, racing after the cart
It comes to a sheep pen and smashes through it
It comes to a large barn and leaps onto its roof, then leaps off again -- -- and lands within striking distance of the cart
Henri drives the horse, but it's no use
The Wolf lunges, wrestling the horse to the ground
The horse cries out, its body twisting as it falls, sending the cart flying
Isabelle falls out and lands hard
Henri lies on his side, clutching his wrist
Isabelle pulls herself together and goes to him
She looks at his arm
It's visibly broken
She helps him to his feet -- -- just as the overturned cart is  apart
The Wolf bursts through it, breaking it to pieces
It glares at them with bloodthirsty eyes
Isabelle and Henri back away from it, but their escape is blocked -- the Villagers have caught up
They freeze at the sight of the Wolf, but stand their ground
Isabelle and Henri are trapped
The Reeve shouts: Take her
Take her and leave us in peace
The Wolf  at him and turns to Isabelle
() 95
: You can't outrun me, my dear
And there is no place you can hide that  cannot smell you out
() So what is your decision
Will you take your place with me
My place will never be with you
Where do you belong then
Here
With the cowards who so gladly sacrificed you to save themselves
They're still good people
They are sheep
We are not like them
Let me show you what you are
The Wolf steps closer
but suddenly, Henri pushes Isabelle aside, pulls his hammer from his belt, and raises it to hit the Wolf
Get away from her
The Reeve quickly grabs him
Henri struggles futilely, but Isabelle seizes the distraction
She snatches a Villager's torch and jabs it into the Wolf's side
The Wolf leaps back with an eerily human  of pain
Before it can react, Isabelle waves the torch at the Villagers, grabs Henri and they run away
The mob chases after them
Three Soldiers appear and join the mob
Figures silhouetted against the snow, angry faces lit by torchlight
It's like a nightmare
Suddenly, a cottage in front of the mob  into pieces and the Wolf bursts out of it
It turns on the Villagers and Soldiers
It picks up a fallen roof beam in its powerful jaws, clenches them, trembling with rage, and snaps the wooden beam in half like a twig
The Villagers run away in fear, but the Soldiers stand their ground and the Wolf attacks
Meanwhile, Isabelle and Henri escape
but there are more Soldiers up ahead
Isabelle and Henri quickly hide
() 96
: (2) need to tell you something
In case  die
(off Isabelle's look) Your grandmother is the Wolf
Isabelle recoils in disbelief
She shakes her head
The Wolf is a man
It told me
You believe it
Isabelle hesitates
He has a point
Henri peers out
The Soldiers are closing in on them
They're coming
Follow me
She takes his hand and leads him away
'   - Isabelle knocks at the door
Roxanne answers
She gives Isabelle a stunned look
We need to come inside
Quickly
'   - Isabelle and Henri enter
Roxanne shuts the door
Marguerite gasps when she sees Isabelle
Have you lost your mind
If they find her here, they'll kill us, too
Then shut up so they don't find her
We have to get out of town
You'll never make it
You can hide here until morning
() 97
: They're searching everywhere
We have to keep moving
You might make it to the church
Even the king cannot violate the protection of sanctuary
And the Wolf cannot cross onto holy ground
The three exchange a look
Sounds like a plan
Can we go out your back window
Roxanne nods
They hurry toward the window, but then: Wait
have an idea
'   - group of Villagers walks by
As they do, the Reeve hears something coming from behind the cottage
(
) Come on
The Reeve follows the voice and sees two figures that look like Henri and Isabelle climb out the back window
They're here
Over here
The two figures run and the Villagers chase after them
-  - Henri and Isabelle hide behind a shed, just as the Villagers appear and spread out, trying to find them
Henri turns to Isabelle
only it's not Isabelle
It's Roxanne wearing Isabelle's clothes
Can you keep going
can if you can
They run off, chased by the Villagers
98
'   - Isabelle climbs out the back window undetected, dressed in Roxanne's clothes
The coast is clear
She runs off
-  - Isabelle can see the church steeple over the rooftops and races toward it
But then she hears a low  ahead of her
Dark eyes peer from an open barn door
She turns and runs down an alley
The Wolf chases after her
As Isabelle nears the end of the alley, the Wolf suddenly appears in front of her, blocking her path
She races back the way she came, then darts into a gap between two outbuildings, barely big enough for her to pass through, too narrow for the Wolf to follow
But as she runs, she hears a   above her
The Wolf is chasing her on the roof of one of the buildings
It's right over her
It shoves its head through the narrow space above her,  its jaws, but can't quite reach her
Then suddenly -- -- the gap between the buildings closes further and the Wolf is stopped short, choking, its head caught in the narrow space
But Isabelle slips through, emerges from between the buildings, and is startled by a : (
) There
The Captain is pointing at her
He has another Soldier with him
Isabelle runs
They chase after her
just as the Wolf frees itself
From the rooftop, it sees the Soldiers chasing Isabelle
It races after them, running across roofs and jumping from cottage to cottage
Isabelle runs into an alley that dead-ends at a low wall
There's firewood piled against the wall and Isabelle quickly scrabbles up it, but at the last second -- -- the Captain reaches out and grabs her ankle
She grabs a log and hits him over the head until he lets go
Then she jumps down to the other side
The other Soldier starts to climb after her, but is suddenly lifted right off his feet
The Captain looks up
The Wolf is standing on the adjacent roof and has picked the Soldier up in its jaws
It glares down at the Captain
It flings the Soldier in its mouth away like a dirty sock
The Captain gapes up at it in fear for a moment too long and then the Wolf is on him
99
-  - Isabelle's route has taken her right back to where she started
She spots the steeple and starts toward it
But there is someone here
Father Solomon
He's holding his silver sword
Isabelle freezes
For a moment, they just stand there, looking at one another
Then -- Isabelle turns to run
Solomon is on her in an instant
He grabs a fistful of her hair and throws her to the ground
She tries to get away, but he puts a knee in her back and ties her hands together with a length of rope
At least you won't die alone now
Your friends will all hang with you
Suddenly
a long, hideous
Behind them
Father Solomon turns
Isabelle cranes her neck and sees
the Wolf emerge from the alley she just came out of
Solomon picks up his sword and stands to face it
If you come for her, you come through me
The Wolf  and raises its hackles
Solomon raises his sword
Just then, Henri and Roxanne run into the square, followed by a group of Villagers
Stay back
Henri hurries to Isabelle's side
The Villagers watch, breathless, as Solomon and the Wolf circle one another
Solomon's sword starts to tremble
Sweat breaks out on his brow
The Wolf  with an almost mocking leer
Then, with a loud battle cry, Solomon charges
The Wolf leaps at him
Solomon raises his sword
and the Wolf's jaws clamp onto his wrist
Solomon screams
The Villagers watch, horrified, as the Wolf twists back and forth, like a dog with a chew toy -- -- biting off Solomon's hand
The hand falls into the snow, still clutching the silver sword
Solomon cries out in agony
The Wolf turns toward Isabelle and
There is your mighty werewolf hunter
Who will save you now
() 100
: Isabelle trembles
The Wolf slowly steps toward her, menacing
and is struck in the head with a rock
The Wolf stops, surprised to find Henri standing in its way
Henri picks up another rock and throws it
You bastard
You killed my father
Henri, what are you doing
'm not letting it take you
He throws another rock and another
One hits the Wolf in the eye, tearing a gash in its face
The Wolf
Look
It bleeds
We can kill it if we stand together
The Villagers waver
Henri beseeches them: Father Solomon was one man
His soldiers were mercenaries
But we are a village
The Wolf  at him, but comes no closer
He's right
It's a coward at heart
Look at it
Why doesn't it attack
The Wolf  louder and takes a step toward her
but then the Merchant picks up a rock and throws it
You killed my daughter
Then another Villager joins them
The Wolf looks around
Villagers are emerging from the shadows all around it
It's surrounded
And not by a dozen soldiers, but by a solid wall of angry, determined men and women
The Wolf raises its hackles, trying to scare them, but they start closing in, jabbing at it with weapons and farm implements
It snaps and  at its attackers, but there are too many of them
Someone drives a spear into the Wolf and it screams in agony
It lurches around, biting at the spear, but can't reach it
Then Henri sees something in the snow
() 101
: (2) Solomon's sword
He pries it out of Solomon's severed hand and turns to face the Wolf, the angry Villagers gathered behind them
The Wolf trembles, blood dripping from its many wounds
then it turns to Isabelle
will come for you again
And with that, it turns and flees into the night
The Villagers
The Reeve chases after it and the rest of the angry mob follows him
Henri turns to Isabelle
Are you all right
Isabelle nods, shaky
Then
(
) This isn't over
They turn
Solomon kneels, holding his bloody stump
am bitten
Henri and Isabelle exchange a look
long beat
Henri walks over to Solomon, sword in hand
Solomon crosses himself and closes his eyes, unafraid
Roxanne turns away
Isabelle doesn't
Then Henri swings the sword
There is a soft  as Solomon's head hits the snow
Henri throws the sword aside
Isabelle puts a reassuring hand on his shoulder
'   -  - Isabelle awakens in her bed
She looks around
She's still dressed in Roxanne's clothes from the night before
'   -   - Isabelle enters to find Suzette putting food in a basket
Suzette stops when she sees Isabelle and gives her a hug
It's past noon
know
didn't want to wake you
Isabelle smiles up at her
The wounds on Suzette's face are still bad, but healing
She's scarred for life
() 102
: Where's Father
He'll be home soon
They have no reason to hold him any longer
Did they catch the Wolf
No
They lost it in the forest
This gives Isabelle pause
beat
Then: What about Grandmother
Suzette hesitates
Isabelle is suddenly concerned
Roxanne came by
She said your grandmother has fallen ill
was hoping you could look in on her
Off Isabelle's troubled look
-  - Isabelle walks through the village wearing Lucie's red riding hood and carrying a basket of food
People lower their eyes as she passes
She spots Prudence gossiping with Lucrece
Prudence sees her, then looks away
The same pup we saw at the beginning is now a grown dog
It playfully follows Isabelle along the path, but stops as she enters the dark, fog-shrouded forest
-  - Isabelle walks through the snow
thick fog gives the forest a strange, dream-like feeling
cold wind blows
Soon Isabelle becomes aware of  behind her
She stops and turns
Slowly, a figure appears
It's Peter
Thank God you're all right
He tries to take her hand, but she pulls away
beat
'm fine
You sent Henri to help me
() 103
: What did he tell you
Isabelle gives him a hurt look
Those people back there
know they mean well, but they're just people
didn't expect anything from them
expected something from you
just need to talk to you
'm going to see my Grandmother
She's sick
Please don't follow me
Isabelle starts walking again
Peter just stands there, watching her go
When she looks back, he's gone
She sighs, wiping tears from her eyes
She continues on
Then:  behind her again
She stops and looks back
Listens
Nothing
She keeps walking
But then she  them again
Looks back
dark figure follows her in the fog
She walks faster
She reaches the fork in the path
She pauses
The are still behind her
She makes a decision
She breaks off a tree branch and backs toward the abandoned path, using the branch to sweep away her tracks in the snow
When she's far enough away from the main path, she throws the branch aside
and turns to face the abandoned path
It looks ominous
She gives it a wary look, then starts walking
- Isabelle reaches the rope bridge
More of the rotten boards have fallen out during the winter
Isabelle looks down
It's a long drop to the river below
She edges out, stepping carefully on the snow-covered boards, holding onto the rope with both hands
Suddenly --
board  under her weight
At the last instant, she regains her balance
The broken board  into the water
She takes a moment to catch her breath before continuing
104
'  - Isabelle crosses the little bridge and knocks on the front door
The fog still hangs over everything
She doesn't notice the dark stain under her feet
Grandmother
Are you awake
She listens at the door
long beat
Then: (
) Pull the bobbin
The latch will open
We recognize the thin, raspy voice
Isabelle hesitates, then pulls the bobbin and opens the door
-  - The Reeve and a  examine something
You're certain nobody has seen him since last night
The Wolf must have taken him
What else could have done that
They're looking at the cell where Cesaire was locked up
The metal door has been ripped off its hinges
'  - Isabelle closes the door
pot is cooking over the fire
The cat lounges in its heat, grooming itself
It looks up at Isabelle as she enters
Isabelle stops
The veil that has always been closed is now open
Beyond it, we see Grandmother propped up in bed
The light is too dim to see her very well, just a candle by her bed
She's wearing a nightgown and cap
She doesn't move
've been expecting you
Isabelle starts toward the bedroom with the basket
Mother sent some food
There are cakes and a pot of butter -- () 105
: Don't come in here
Isabelle stops short
Grandmother's face is cloaked in darkness
Isabelle gives her a questioning look
'm not hungry right now
Are you sure
You sound so weak
just made myself a stew
left it over the fire for you
Isabelle glances back at the pot  over the fire
came here to take care of you
Not the other way around
Don't be silly, my dear
You've been through so much
Sit down
Isabelle considers for a beat, then places the basket on the table, next to a ball of yarn with Grandmother's knitting needles sticking out of it
There's no burden so heavy that it doesn't seem a little lighter on a full stomach
() You always say that
She ladles some soup into a bowl and sits down
The cat looks up from its grooming, watching her
That's right
Eat up, my dear
Eat up
Isabelle takes a bite of the hot soup
The cat jumps up on the table and lies down next to her, licking its paw
've been worried about you
When you didn't come back yesterday, was afraid
() You were wrong about Henri
() 106
: (2) Was  now
Yes
He saved my life
Isabelle takes another bite of soup, then pauses
She puts the bowl down and loosens her collar
feel hot all of a sudden
It's just the stew warming you
Isabelle hesitates, but keeps eating
Then she takes a closer look at the cat
There's blood on its paw
That's what it has been licking this whole time
Suddenly, Isabelle feels faint
She breaks out in a sweat
She looks at the soup
thick broth with chunks of white meat
What is this
If you don't like it, there's wine on the table to wash it down
Isabelle reaches for the bottle with an unsteady hand and pours herself a cup
She takes a sip
and freezes
It's not wine
It's blood
She gags and drops the cup, spilling blood everywhere
The cat jumps away
She looks at the bottle, turns it over
More blood pours out
Isabelle screams and throws it, knocking over the pot and spilling the soup
The Figure laughs
Oh, what pretty red lips
Come and give your Granny a kiss, my dear
don't think  want to
Then  will come to you
And with that -- Grandmother slowly starts to move
She groans
She's hurt
She stands up
She's much taller now than she was
As Isabelle watches in mute dread, the Figure pulls off Grandmother's nightgown and cap, hobbles into the firelight, revealing its face
() 107
: (3) It's Cesaire
Isabelle quickly stands, startled
What is this
Where's Grandmother
'm afraid  ate most of her
() You ate the rest
Isabelle gives the spilled stew on the floor a horrified look
For a moment, she looks like she may pass out
didn't want to kill her
But she finally realized what  was
-  () Cesaire bathes in a cold stream
(
) The hardest thing to hide has always been the smell
The werewolf musk is strong, especially close to the full moon
-  () The night of the wolf hunt
Henri crouches in the woods, clutching his hammer
then freezes with terror
He sees the Wolf slink by in the dark, dragging Adrien along by his throat
It happened just as Henri said it did
(
) Henri smelled it the night he saw me
And he recognized the smell later
-  () Grandmother's confrontation with Henri
She stumbles outside and practically runs right into Cesaire
(
) He thought it was your Grandmother
He didn't know he was smelling me
But she did
She'd lived with the smell her whole life, she just had no way of knowing what it was
108
'  -  () Grandmother hands Cesaire a stack of knitted blankets
(
) Once she realized what it was, of course, she knew the truth
She tried to sneak a message to Father Auguste last night
'  -  () Cesaire carries the blankets back to the cart
He quickly looks inside them and finds a note: ' ' Subtitle: 'My son is the wolf
' (
) Luckily, she'd taught me how to read
Isabelle shakes her head, tears streaming down her face
You're not the Wolf
You can't be
Look into my eyes
The one part of me  can never change
Isabelle looks into his eyes
and recoils in horror
Oh, dear God
You killed Lucie
You killed my sister
did more than that to her
Isabelle steps away from him, mind reeling
He snarls
only wish your mother could have known what  did to her
The girl she passed off as my daughter
'   -  () The night of the festival
can be heard coming from the village square
Suzette runs outside
() 109
: (
) was made a cuckold by your mother
But  paid her back
She hears a
She turns, startled
It's the Wolf
It lunges at her, raking her face with its claws
-  () The wolf hunt
Adrien hears  move in the brush
He looks toward it
and sees the Wolf staring at him from the darkness
(
) paid her lover back, too
To Isabelle's dismay, Cesaire has tears in his eyes
Lucie was the joy of my life
But she wasn't mine
Yes, she was
In every way that matters, she was
No
Not in every way that matters
My father sired me am a werewolf because it was in his blood
Because  was his
Did Grandmother know
No
And neither does your mother
'   -  () The night Lucie died
Cesaire pours mugs of beer, but this time we see him sprinkle something in the beer before serving it -- Grandmother's sleeping herb
(
) put an herb in the beer to make you sleep whenever the moon was full
One of your Grandmother's old remedies
110
'  -  () Many years ago
Grandmother is in her 40s, asleep in a chair, holding an empty cup
Isabelle's takes the cup from her hand and quietly leaves
Grandmother sleeps peacefully by the fire
(
) That's how my father got away with it
Your grandmother never learned the truth
Until last night
-  () Still many years ago
werewolf runs through the woods
followed by a smaller werewolf
(
) began to turn when  was fourteen
My father and  ran together
We hunted freely
Killing at will
The two werewolves are chasing a  , moving in for the kill
-  () The mangled body of the Peasant has been discovered group of  stands around it
(
) Our only mistake was that we gorged ourselves too often on the fat flesh of the villagers
-  () The two werewolves are running through the woods again, this time chased by  with torches and weapons
They killed my father
Suddenly, the larger werewolf falls into a pit filled with sharp stakes
It   in agony
The smaller werewolf looks down and
watching as the larger werewolf begins to change before our eyes
It's reverting to its human form
() 111
: By the time the Villagers reach the pit, what they find is Grandfather's naked body skewered on the stakes
The smaller werewolf  at them and runs away
(
) The fools thought my father had been thrown in the pit by the Wolf
They never suspected that he was the Wolf
() Cesaire labors in a field
He goes to church
He thatches the roof of his cottage in the hot sun
(
) tried to live as my father did, but  came to realize that  did not belong here
The Wolf was my true self
It wasn't something to be hidden
It was a gift
had to leave here and never return
-  () Cesaire stands in the cemetery, looking down at his father's grave
(
) But  did not want to go alone
My father and  were part of a long and powerful bloodline
It was up to me to see that it did not die out
had hoped for a son to pass my gift on to
'   -  () Cesaire mends a fence, but keeps glancing at something
(
) Instead, God gave me daughters
He's looking at Lucie and Isabelle
They help Suzette hang clothes to dry
He smiles as he watches them
(
) But female werewolves are not born
They are made
And  chose my eldest
Lucie catches him watching
She waves
He waves back
112
'   -  () Another day
Cesaire is giving Lucie a stern lecture
Lucie's face is ashen and there are tears in her eyes
(
) When  finally decided to leave, told Lucie the truth
And  gave her a choice
She could come with me
Or  would take you instead
Lucie turns and sees Isabelle approaching
We realize that we've seen this moment before
This doesn't concern you, Isabelle
Yes, Father
Isabelle walks away
Cesaire watches her go
(
) She agreed to come with me
She did it to protect you
'   -  -  () Isabelle is fast asleep
Lucie sneaks out of bed
(
) We arranged to meet on the night of the next full moon
-  -  () Lucie stands naked, arms clutched around her breasts
Then, a  in the brush
She turns and sees
She was not a werewolf yet
had to turn her
the Wolf emerge from the forest with a scrap of bloody meat dangling from its jaws
-  -  () Later
Lucie weeps as she forces herself to eat the raw meat scraps
The Wolf watches, panting
() 113
: (
) First, she had to eat human flesh
fed her from a kill  had made the month before
But the ritual was not yet complete
She had to be bitten by a male werewolf
'  - Isabelle looks like she's going to be ill
The bite should have changed her
It should have made her like me
But it didn't
That's when knew
There was no werewolf blood in her
was not her father was so angry
killed her before even realized  was doing it
-  () Cesaire sits slumped in a corner, too drunk to move hand reaches in to help him
It's Isabelle
(
) Afterwards,  thought about killing myself
The only thing that kept me alive was you
'   -  () Isabelle helps drunk Cesaire into bed
(
) You were so beautiful
So kind
And  knew you were mine
That's why you could understand me when no one else could
You were mine
'  - Cesaire takes Isabelle's hand and won't let it go
She backs into the wall
He looms over her
Do you see now
This is your heritage
This is what you are
Everything  have done has been to insure the future of our bloodline
We will run together () () 114
: (') like my father and  once did
You are the next generation
You have had your first taste of human flesh
Now one bite from me is all that is needed to change you
It will only hurt for a moment
And then you will be as  am
There must indeed be a God
For you are surely the Devil
will give you a choice
Come with me now
Or refuse me and let your friends suffer in your place
will kill them one by one
Your mother
Roxanne
Peter
Isabelle shudders
She slowly pulls away and he releases her
She walks over to the table, her back to him
She eyes the ball of yarn with Grandmother's knitting needles in it
long beat
Isabelle chokes back tears
Father
He approaches her
Stands behind her and places his hand on her shoulder
Her skin crawls
Yes, my dear
You gave me two choices
She turns to face him
Looks up at him
But  have thought of a third
Suddenly --
Isabelle drives something hard into Cesaire's jaw
He gasps, choking
He puts his had to his throat
Blood spills out through his fingers
Grandmother's ball of yarn on the table
The knitting needles aren't sticking out of it anymore
They're sticking out of Cesaire's neck
He falls to his knees, gagging
Then he flops over dead
Eyes open
Isabelle gazes down at him
She looks like she might have just lost her mind
Then she sits on the floor, staring at his body
and screams
An eruption of rage, betrayal, and heartbreak
She screams
115
'  - The cottage is dark and quiet
'  - It's pitch black in here
There's a  at the door
(
) Hello
No response
The door  open
It's Peter
As he opens the door, moonlight spills inside to reveal Isabelle huddled and trembling in the corner
She's screamed and cried herself out
All that's left is anger and a grim resolve
She did what she had to do
'  -  () Isabelle and Peter sit at the table
dim candle provides the only light
long beat
People should know what he was
We can't tell anyone
If they don't believe you, they'll hang you for this
And if they do believe you, they'll hang you for being the daughter of the Wolf
Then 'll run away
was ready to run away last night
() Why didn't you come for me
Peter gives her a long look
But instead of speaking, he rolls up his sleeve
Isabelle's eyes go wide
There's a huge scar on his arm
In the shape of a bite mark
was bitten at the festival spent last night in the woods because  was afraid of what might happen
( ) changed
'm like him now
No, you're not
You could never be like him
() 116
: Isabelle's tears fall, the full implications of what he's saying starting to sink in
He takes her hand
can't stay here
Yes, you can
We can still be together
My father lived here
My grandfather lived here
Your father and your grandfather killed people
They couldn't help themselves
If  stay here, won't be able to control myself
(off her look) have to be alone
Isabelle rests her head on his and they just sit like that, leaning against one another in the candlelight
'  -  () Isabelle and Peter crouch next to Cesaire's body
The candle is on the floor, casting weird shadows
We could take him to the river
don't want him ever found
We'll weight him with rocks
No
We'll put the rocks inside him
(off his look) Cut him open
will sew the rocks inside him
Peter is taken aback
She's serious
'  -  () Peter and Isabelle have placed several heavy rocks next to Cesaire's body
Peter opens Cesaire's shirt and takes out a hunting knife
Isabelle gives Peter a nod
Peter somewhat reluctantly lowers the knife, his shoulder moving up and down as he goes about his unseen task
() 117
: Moments later, Isabelle threads a needle and coldly stitches begins stitching
We don't see what she's doing, but there's blood on her needle and thread
There's a spot of blood on her cheek, too
-   - Low mist hugs the ground
There's a wooden -frame pontoon raft tied to a ferry dock
guy-rope runs through the -frame to a pier on the opposite shore
Isabelle and Peter nervously approach
He pushes a wheelbarrow onto the raft, its contents wrapped in burlap
Peter unties the moorings and is about to shove off, but Isabelle stops him: Wait
She pulls back the burlap, revealing Cesaire's dead body
His belly is lumpy and misshapen, an ugly red line in his torso stitched together with black thread
The knitting needles still jut out of his jaw
Isabelle yanks them out, then pulls the burlap back over Cesaire's body
Peter gives her a questioning look
These belonged to my grandmother
The knitting needles are covered in blood
Peter takes out a rag and wipes the blood off for her
And as he does
something begins to shine through in the moonlight
Peter gives Isabelle a stunned look
They're silver
- Peter uses a long pole to push the raft across the water
Isabelle gazes out at the moonlit mist
They stop the in the middle of the river
They exchange a look
then each take a side of the wheelbarrow and dump the body into the water
It sinks instantly and is gone
Death was too good for him
can live with it
118
-   - Isabelle and Peter stand on the shore
He kisses her and she holds his face in her hands, wanting the kiss to last forever
When they part, she gives him an aching look
Where will you go
don't know
need to understand what 've become
Maybe  can learn to control it
(off her look) 'll take my own life before take another's
know
'm not coming back
don't want you to wait for me
This is the last time you'll ever see me
No, it isn't
You'll be in my dreams until the day  die
Peter turns and starts to walk away
But then he pauses
You know, Henri is a good man
Yes, he is
Then Peter continues on until he vanishes in the fog
on Isabelle as she watches him go
(
) never saw him again
-  - The leaves have returned to the forest with explosions of green
Crops grow in the fields
Flowers bloom
The village is vibrant with life and beauty
(
) Life in my village was changed forever
There were many questions and few answers
In the () () 119
: (
) (') end, the Wolf did not return
And that was answer enough for most
- Isabelle and Henri stand before Father Auguste
They're getting married
Roxanne, Suzette, and other friends and neighbors watch as Isabelle and Henri exchange rings
(
) Henri and  were married
He was a good man and a good father loved him very much
But  never loved him the same way that loved Peter
That was the one secret in our marriage
- Isabelle laughs as she watches Henri run around, playing with their three young children --   and a
Isabelle gives Henri a warm, loving smile
(
) only tell you now because he is dead
And if he knows now, believe that he forgives me, for he must also know that  never loved him falsely
'  - Isabelle's Girls are in bed asleep
Isabelle enters, carrying the sleeping Boy
She gently places him in bed next to the girls and covers them with a blanket
(
) This is my story, not that expect you will believe it
In my own village, the events of that awful winter have already passed into legend
Parents tell their children to be good or else the Wolf will come and gobble them up
Isabelle smiles as she watches them sleep
(
) They've already forgotten simple children's story is all that remains
120
'  - Isabelle opens the door and strolls outside, looking up at the sky
The moon is full
(
) But sometimes, when the moon is full, my thoughts still turn to Peter
He promised me that would never see him again
And never have
Somewhere, a wolf
Isabelle smiles
(
) But  often wonder if  hear him
- High on a hilltop,    to reveal a staring down at the distant village
It's hard to tell in the moonlight whether it's a normal wolf
Or something else
