Written by John Fusco Fourth draft Oct
5, 1990 Beating slow
And deep
Like a heart
: - Something is rising from the Black Hills
sphere of light, too red to be the sun
sphere of contained fire, undulating in crimson and ochre, and rising slowly, majestically, to the pulse
To the
It is the sun
But it is a Paha Sapa sunrise
Black Hills sunrise
And it is spectacular
The , pounds deeper, bigger, as the sun gets higher
Stronger
Igniting a vast landscape of gentle slopes and foothills; throwing shadows on the plains that look like, as the Indians say, an old man dancing
The grass is golden
And high
The wind moves through it, snakes through it
Slowly
Voices; a    (Lakota), summoning Wakan Tanka - The Great Mystery
And now, rising up over one of the small land waves, a head comes into view
Shoulders
man, running in ghostly , his long black hair trailing in the wind
The wears only buckskin pants and a bone choker around his neck
Legs and arms churning, the man runs with antelope grace, backlit by the sunrise, bounding toward us
Running
his heart pounding in high-pitched tremolo join the song
And then the runner soars, like an eagle from a bluff, airborne, flying over a small dip, arms outstretched, and it would be a wondrous thing if there were not a fine, crimson, mist all around him and if slow motion was not suddenly overtaken by  , revealing the brutal force of gunfire which has slammed the Indian into the air, throwing him
Slamming him hard into the grass
And it is over as quickly and violently as a deer shot dead
ends abruptly
- the sun burns like lava at the horizon
beats like a heart
And Somewhere off in a distant cottonwood, an
Then Silence
Deep, disturbing stillness
-
- ' shatters the silence
Cars -- a multicolored metallic criss-cross reflecting off a building made of mirrors -- races past an electronic billboard that blinks in red skyhigh digital:
7:59
73 degrees
The
Superhighway
And off behind it, in the distance, Capital Hill holds imposing vigil, the massive cast iron dome of The Capital, catching the sun
But everything is soon smothered by a  , hogging the far lane of the Beltway, leaning on its
Good morning
And the rock n'roll is everybody's radio, everybody's tempo
shimmers across the beltway hugging then releasing a solitary vehicle that we stay with
move with
black Nissan 240 , hard-waxed
240  - Behind the wheel -- an intense young man with close-cropped black hair, eyes hidden by sunglasses
Whatever he does for a living, he does in a suit (not expensive but well-fit
But we might also note that any extra suit cash has gone instead into the silver-plated watch on his left wrist)
Lean as a rake, sallow in the cheeks, there is something insatiable about him -- a hungry energy that won't let him go
, late 20's, early 30's, pulls out of a threatening traffic jam and races on the narrow right between thirty cars and a cement girder
-  - The black  has jumped off an exit and has entered the light- industrial section of Washington
It pulls up near a loading dock behind an old gray building and several parked cars and vans
Ray steps out, smooths his jacket, locks and Another young man -- chubby, clean-shaven; in a nicer suit than Ray's -- steps out from a parked Miata, and approaches Ray
balances a coffee, a
Today and a black eel-skin briefcase
Hey
Hey
Nice tie
Don't get too attached
They start walking briskly toward the loading dock
Ya got the paper
They mount steps
Yeah
You're my hero, Carl
Heroes ain't supposed to shake
'm shakin', man, look at me
Breathe, Carl
Four, nice, deep ones
They stop at the door of a service elevator and Carl breathes
Expanding his chest, exhaling
Ray adjusts Carl's tie for him, his collar
He speaks quietly
Quickly
Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company
We have rug samples
Rug samples
We are one-dimensional, boring peddlers of fine carpet, Carl
Carl nods
Ray hesitates, adjusts his own collar and enters the service elevator
Carl follows
Door closes
- Carl follows Ray into the big sparse room of unfinished sheetrock walls
There is nothing in here but cardboard boxes, and two people; a bearded   standing behind a counter, writing on a clipboard
The other is a middle-aged in a purple silk shirt sitting in a chair with a newspaper held open
He barely looks over the top of the Wall Street Journal
Hey, look who's here
Louis, my man, what's happenin'
Ray walks up to the counter
Carl lingers, fidgeting
Ray sets his briefcase on the counter and click-clicks it open
The Hispanic fence man looks inside, and begins pulling out stacks of treasury checks
Clean ones
Immaculate
Ray gestures to Carl and he nervously sets his briefcase on the counter, fumbles with the first latch
The second
He flips it open
The fence man casts his eyes down at a neat cache of Grade Treasury
lot of it
Then his eyes rise to Carl
What ya got there, seventy-five thousand
hundred and ten
Count it
( ) Have the girl count it, we can't sit around here countin' bonds, we got things to do here
The fence man pushes an intercom button and yells into a speaker
Carl's eyes flit to Ray
Ray's eyes flit to Carl
Louis crushes his newspaper down and lifts a big Colt Python from his lap just as -- section of sheetrock kicks open and bust out, each clutching a handgun,  inaudibly
Get your face on the fuckin' floor
Carl startled, does an almost effeminate dip down to one knee, but that knee is swept out from under him, slapping him flat onto plywood where he is instantly frisked down by the fence man who is wielding a 9 mm handgun
But the white collar criminal is more stunned by the fact that -- Ray is walking across the floor with his hands in his pockets over to the Mr
Coffee
He pours one, and adds some milk
Turns and watches the bust while opening a packet of Sweet n'Low
Slam dunk
Beauty
Beauty
Ray rests his weight against the coffee station, takes a careful sip
Carl is yanked to his feet by the fence man and he stands there, looking at Ray, baffled
Completely shocked
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry
That's not even your name, is it
What's your real name, you fucking scumbag
Don't have one, Carl
have a number, man
Just like the numbers on those treasury checks
You stole from your own country, Carl
Shame on you
Coffee in hand, Ray walks briskly toward the door
Sugar Ray
Ray turns
Louis takes a few steps toward him, putting his gun back in his waistband
They want ya Home
Upstairs wants to see ya
Ray stands frozen, holding the door knob, and digesting what are apparently influential words
Make sure ya spell my name right
Ray just stares for a moment
Then hurries out the door
Carl, being arm-gripped by two agents and photographed like a trout, gazes bewildered at the door
(incredulous) We just spent four months together
thought he was my friend
what the fuck, man
(even more incredulous) He had dinner at my mother's
at him, an agent on either side, striking a natural pose
-  - The huge, imposing, mausoleum-like Hoover building, bordered by artificial turf, hemmed by cherry trees in blossom
Turning out to be a nice day on Pennsylvania Avenue
'   - 8x10     dealt like cards onto a table, one on top of another
1 -- an aerial shot of some wasteland
2 -- a closer bird's eye of the same, what looks like a photo of Mars
3 -- a vast expanse of the Great Plains
, Number-Two-in-Command, deals a fourth photo onto the table
He is an understated, fatherly man, well- manicured in cotton pencil-striped shirt, white-tab collar and tie
The photos and maps and files a foot deep on the huge table are neatly organized
Levoi, Sir
Please
Seated, at the far end of the table, engrossed in the deep spread of information,  (Special Agent)   is about to break the record for longest single ash on the end of a cigarette and the smoke forces his eyes into tight, concentrating, slits
"" as they call him in the Bureau has seen thirty years in some rough "provinces"
He has survived the Hoover era and is a legend in the Sessions era but survival has honed an edge
An edge with a touch of ironic cop humor
Ray enters, walks into a firm shake
Ray
Mister Tully
Do you want a coffee
No
No, no
Thank you
Ray sits nervously across from Cooch who looks up from the photos and studies the younger man through reading glasses and cigarette smoke, and he looks at him like he doesn't know who the hell he is or why he's sitting there
Levoi, Cooch
Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division
Oh, yeah -- right
Cooch sticks his cigarette in his left hand, shakes with his right
Ray this is -- / Frank Couture
That's right
Hello, Ray
The handshake is still locked
Cooch is still squinting at the younger agent
Ray obviously knows something about Agent Couture
It's an honor
Tully leans back in his chair, crosses his legs casually
Ray, we're taking you off the street
We need you out in South Dakota
Ray's enthusiasm suddenly deflates
South Dakota
(confused) Did  do something unsatisfactory, Sir
No, Ray
You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother
Ray looks completely baffled now, swinging a look from Cooch to Tully
Interesting bloodline you have, Ray
(scanning file) French, Scots-Irish, Italian,
and one-eighth American Indian
Sioux Indian, right
'm not that sure
Yeah,  think -- -- yes, Teton Sioux
Father's side
Ray nods, looks from Tully to Cooch
What's going on here
Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands
Indian Reservation
It's not the first
There's been several
And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat
none of the investigations have turned up jack shit
The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians
Relations have not been amicable
Different culture
Hard to penetrate
The Indians don't like white cops poking around
And that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an American Indian agent
Tully straightens the edges of a bureau memorandum
With an Indian representative out there, we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a , Selective Operations Unit, and it'll be easier on Agent Couture if you can gain the people's trust and maybe -- Woh, excuse me, Sir
see what you're saying
've got a little Indian blood, that's true
But -- (laughing) am not an
an Indian
can't just go in and -- -- your father was part Sioux
beat
Ray lowers his eyes to the photos
didn't know him, Sir
He passed away when  was six
Seven
Ray looks up at Cooch
Another uneasy beat
Cooch lights a cigarette as if lighting a cigarette was a science
Don't worry about it, Ray
As long as the people have proof that we sent them one of their own, no one's gonna ask you to weave baskets or make it rain
Ray sits before the files and photos, looking unsure
He has come to garner a promotion but has just been sent to The Graveyard
Or in the  argot, Indian Country
Tully pivots his leather chair in a full circle and slaps an assignment folder down in front of the young agent
-   - The very landscape from opening image
Gentle waves of land, rolling out to touch the Black Hills
The sun rises up out of the distant silhouette like a waking God
Hypnotic
And then a car blows by, throwing up gravel and agate and gypsum
Right by us
Gone
When a dense screen of red dust clears, an old, bent, metal sign at roadside becomes visible
It reads, through punched and rusted bullet holes: "Entering Bear Creek Indian Reservation
" calls in the high-pitched, mournful voices of The same haunting song
- Cooch is at the wheel
Ray, passenger
His lap is a desk for several folders, and he works through them as they drive
Both agents eat a sandwich as they travel
Eight murders in less than a year
All of them Indian
All of them unsolved
Is the law a non-entity out here or what
Cooch opens a folder that sits between them, and taking his eyes off the road for a dangerous five seconds, locates some photos, and hands them to Ray
Ray's expression tells us they are not pretty
Those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant
They were executed at close range
That one there is a police officer killed by the Mohawks up in Canada more recently
Jesus
The agents who have worked out here say its like going into Nam
Unfamiliar terrain, foreign language, foreign customs
and you never know when you might walk into a few rounds
They hold a lot of old anger for the white man out here
Ray considers this as he looks out at the unfamiliar terrain while on the , a
speaks in
Ray
back at Cooch, studying his face
Were you in Nam
Airborne
That's where they used to get us agents from
Now we get 'em from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League
Accountants and computer whiz-kids
Yuppies with guns
(lights a smoke) That's scary shit
Ray smiles, sets the  on high
Not as scary as a Hoover man with a computer
Cooch throws a quick look Ray's way
And a smile
He appreciates the sting of a right off a left
Hey, hey, hey
Edgar would've loved you
He'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it
"To enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests"
You crashed my file
No
consulted it
We're going into Indian Country,  wanna know what kind of individual is covering my ass
Don't you
Ray has finished his sandwich
He wipes his hands on a kerchief while taking in the sight of chalky buttes cramming roadside
You've been in the bureau for thirty years
You survived The Hoov, the Black Panthers and Abscam
don't see any bullet holes
That's good enough for me
Cooch looks at Ray, amused
He likes this guy
And then he notices a look of growing consternation on his partner's face
'  - as they drive through the first settlement, a little, broken and scattered community, littered with wrecked cars on blocks, and overpopulated with hungry dogs
softly under
with dirty but beautiful faces and long blue black hair run alongside the car, curious
One of them we don't understand
the trading post -- a white man's store -- where -- four men, two women sit like wax figures, only their eyes moving to light on the freshly waxed government car
little house has a tipi erected beside it
And a satellite dish
The house beside that one has been half chopped away to feed the wood stove
Poverty
-  - The federal car drives out of the community and further into vast bluffs and strange rock formations where it is swallowed, leaving the ramshackle village in dust
lone dog -- all its ribs showing -- chases,
- We are on the Moon
Or Israel
But not America
Not any America we've ever seen
thirty-mile eroded landscape of dunes and crevices, soft rock strata and fossils
Barren
And eerie
underscores the otherworldly ambiance of this place as -- scuff through the gumbo and multi-colored stones
Two pair of black, spit-shined, lace-ups
Three
Tripping
Scuffing
And then a fourth pair
But they are not loafers
They are Georgio Brutini's and they belong to -- Ray, as he and Cooch follow two Special Agents from the regional office
is about Cooch's age, balding is closer to Ray's age but instead of a suit like the rest, he favors an army-green jacket
Neither is a South Dakota shit-kicker but transplanted field agents
All four shield their eyes with dark glasses, and here in the Badlands it is wise because the sun makes dunes shimmy and craters become faces
It plays mischief on the eye, making Ray and Sherman nearly trip on -- lying face down in the rainbow sand
Dried blood and horse flies cover his blown out torso
The agents stand over him, breathless from the rugged walk
Who found him
Indian kids
Hunting fossils
Cooch studies the body from where he stands
Sherman hands a file over to Ray
Okay
think Agent Levoi and  can proceed from here
What are your call signals
-10 and 11
Anything we can do to help you out, just radio
Good
Thanks, Guys
The agents start back through the Badlands
Ray is already squatting a safe distance from the body, covering his nose with a kerchief while looking in the file
Cooch takes a bended knee on the other side of the body
Flies buzz on and around the corpse
Leo Fast Elk
Thirty seven
single
Member of the Tribal Council
Cooch makes a note then slowly circles the body
He holds a hand out to Ray and the younger agent turns the file over
Looks like Fast Elk wasn't fast enough to outrun that load
What do you make of the damage
Ray gets closer, swats at Flies with the folder
Six rounds
357
That's what it looks like, doesn't it
But that's what a ten gauge, choke-bored, shotgun will look like when it hits your lower back from five feet away
Ray looks up impressed
Cooch rises and walks off gingerly, scanning the surroundings
Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure
Ray
Cooch is standing ten feet away, staring at the ground
Ray walks over, carefully
He follows Cooch's frown down at the twisted layers of earth
a circle has been etched deep in the soft gumbo, and in the center of the circle, a white eagle plume sticks straight up, dancing in the wind
Cooch and Ray each lower themselves to their haunches to study the strange sight
Cooch puts his reading glasses on, stares at it
Then lights a cigarette
Ray hefts up a camera and begins  off shots
He starts moving around it, taking shots at different angles
And then the sound of a   draws both agent's attention
: way out in the bizarre moonscape of eroded rock and earth, a lone figure on a motorcycle bounces and grinds, born out of a silvery heat mirage
It's fifty yards off but heading straight for us
The
-    try to make the figure out
the archaic mud-caked Harley chugs and stalls, spits and choices, and begins an incredible drive straight up the steep side of this natural wonder
At the throttle is an imposing figure
is a portly Indian in his late-thirties with a black reservation hat worn low over a face that seems to have been cast from a bust of Sitting Bull
Sitting Bull with aviator shades
Denim jacket over checkered shirt
Faded jeans
Well broken duct-taped boots
His hair is worn long in tight duel braids
The rusted bike bajas up and down slopes, finally stalling out, twenty feet or so from the murder site
Crow Horse swings his bulk off the bike like dismounting a horse
He looks around suspiciously then pulls a rolled-up blanket from the carrier rack
lies in death
Crow Horse's boots move in stealthily, creaking like saddle leather
He squats and looks at the corpse
then looks around with animal alertness
He reaches into the front pocket of his jacket and pulls out some Bull Durham tobacco
He pinches some and offers it to the four directions around the body
He then unrolls the blanket, begins to move the dead man
sense something and wheels to see Cooch standing behind him, one hand behind his back where his gun must be, and the other hand holding up open wallet
The sun hits his badge
Good morning
Crow Horse hawks his eyes onto a big rock, a full second before Ray steps out, his
45 drawn but held at ease
Crow Horse slowly raises his arms as Ray moves up to him, studying him
Taking ol' Leo somewhere
Leo's been out here too long, man
'm taking him to ceremonial burial
This is a restricted area
Check him out, Ray
Ray frisks the Indian, finds an old leather wallet, and then a gun
38
Nice piece
You come back here to cover your tracks, Geronimo
What's your name
It ain't Geronimo
Who are you
think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah
This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation
Cooch walks around to the front of Crow Horse, and studies him
know where  am
'm on federal land, doing a federal investigation, and if you don't wanna cooperate you can take a ride in a federal car, and spend the rest of the day in a little room, answering federal questions
It's your call
Who are you
'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation
You're a wise-ass
Ray check his wallet
did
Who the fuck is he
-- a fucking cop
pause
long, dead of South Dakota, Badlands pause
Cooch turns and looks at Ray who holds up the open wallet, revealing a badge
Like Cooch's it shines in the sun
Walter Crow Horse
Tribal Police
Cooch stands staring at the Indian
then takes a few steps over to Ray and grabs the wallet
He examines it
Then looks at Crow Horse and laughs
He's a fucking cop
The Indian cop has plenty of time to get up on his own but he kneels there, tauntingly, waiting for Ray to help him
Ray walks over and offers a hand
Crow Horse takes it, and pulls himself up, looking square into Ray's sunglasses
Cooch walks over and hands the officer his wallet, and his 23
Crow Horse takes the items, eyeing the older agent
We got the wire ya was comin'
You're the Indian official, yeah
No
No, that's Ray, here
Ray, uh
(searching his imagination) Ray
Little Weasel
Ray does a take but quickly recovers, meeting Crow Horse's scrutinizing gaze
Crow Horse nods to Ray, and Ray nods back in case it's the Indian thing to do
Crow Horse nods again
Ray nods again
Leo's gotta get to burial, Brother
He's gotta make the journey
What journey
Tell him, Ray
Ray stares at Crow Horse, uneasy
The wind sings through the Badlands
Leo has to take the journey, Cooch
We'll have to give Leo a refund
Because he's gotta go to the
In case you don't know, Officer, violation of the Major Crimes Act on -- -- an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation
know that
Good
Thank you
Crow Horse says something in Sioux to Ray
Ray just stares
said when can Leo be taken to ceremony
After we've completed our investigation
Crow Horse is staring at Ray
That's a nice suit
Ray looks offended
Cooch puts a hand on Crow Horse's shoulder and walks him toward his beat-up motorcycle
Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot
You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya
They done that to one of our girls once
Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands
Crow Horse turns and looks at Ray
Ray is quick this time
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch
He does quillwork
think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment
Respect the dead, Hoss
Because when -- -- did you understand me when  said that -- (walking away) -- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation
know that
Goodbye
Crow Horse appears to be getting on his bike when suddenly he moves like a cat and lays his knife to the dead man's head
He cuts away a patch of hair
What the hell you doing
His mother needs a piece of his hair
It's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony
(wrapping lock of hair) Has to be kept for four days
Cooch and Ray stand there, watching Crow Horse mount his bike and push off down a nasty slope back through the Badlands
He starts his motor
It dies
Then starts again
Keeping of the souls
Do they still burn their dead or something
Beats the hell outta me
Ray and Cooch look off across the Badlands, as far out of their element as they can be
- in the circle in the sand, fluttering in the wind
The gold spit-shined Le Baron eases to a crawl, passing an old wooden sign
"Leaving Bear Creak Indian Reservation
" And immediately pulling in front of a squat old bar with a burned out neon Miller light
croons "Youuuuuu- Got-Your Little-Ways" on the jukebox from inside
The Buffalo Butte bar has several cracked and sun-bleached buffalo skulls hanging off the edge of its flat roof and big faded white letters painted across the front read: "No Indians Allowed
" (This sign actually exists today in the res-line border town of Scenic, South Dakota)
The car pulls up beside a pick-up and parks
Ray and Cooch step out, careful to walk wide around a  in the bed of the truck
walks out of the bar and looks askance at the suits
As the two feds approach the bar, Cooch looks up at the warning sign
Ray sees it too
Sorry, Ray
You're gonna have to wait in the car
'll bring you out a cheeseburger
The young agent smiles, amused, starts to enter the bar but -- (
) Hey
Ray spins quickly, paranoid about entering
But the man calling to them is -- An Indian himself
, a small man in his late fifties who peers out at the agents through fat bifocals
He wears a straw cowboy hat, red windbreaker and his hair is cut short, or "bobtailed" as the Indians say
Clear Moon is walking away from a parked pick-up truck, toward the white men, eyeing the two with deep curiosity
(heavy Indian accent) You made it
Was-te
Cooch discreetly peeks into a folder as he walks toward the man You must be
President Clear Bone
Clear Moon
(pointing to the sky) Moon
You must be the Sioux
He is pointing his long, skinny finger at Cooch
No
That's Ray here
Ray
(quickly) Ray Levoi, Sir
Pleasure
Clear Moon beholds the young agent with hopeful eyes, a smile breaking across his flaccid brown skin
He takes Ray's hand in a respectful double-clutch and grips him tightly
almost desperately
It's about time they sent us one of our own
Was-te
He keeps pumping Ray's hand, looking into his face with great admiration
Cooch looks on with amusement
Things are no good here
It is like war zone
We need an official who understands what is good for the Indian people
Who knows Indian way
Clear Moon has not released Ray's arm as he leads them to a string of seedy motel units across the street
thought we were staying on the reservation
Yes
Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land
see
Are you hungry
have some nice raw kidney in the truck
Oh, 'm set, Sir
'm set
He's starving, Mr
Clear Moon
Get him some raw kidney
He hasn't had any Indian food in days
And Clear Moon guides them through the front door of room 13
Ray looks over his shoulder threateningly at Cooch who winks and pats his back
- lone headlight appears out of the black
But faster
Relentless
"res" car, a dented, rusted, peeling old station wagon, drives slowly toward the reservation
Then suddenly, someone steps in front of the car in cowboy boots and blue jeans
-  13 - Ray lies in bed
Awake
He is hanging off the bed with a file open on the floor and using the moon to light photos and memorandums
And then he hears  outside
And He gets out of bed quickly, snatching up his pants, putting their on, and going to the window
-  : out in front of the bar help a middle-aged out of the station wagon
Where you goin'
Back to the res
young local bends down behind the Indian while another shoves him, sending him tripping over the bent man and onto his back in the dirt
What ya doin'
You drunk
come out from the bar, beers and drinks and interested in what's going on
- at the window, observes
Cooch enters from the connecting room, puffy-eyed but quickly buttoning his shirt
He shares Ray's view
Let's take a walk
Ray is transfixed
- The Indian man, is pushed into a stumble, and caught by another white man as a little game of catch takes place
Cooch, stepping into the circle, shirt half unbuttoned, hair a mess, looks on
Then steps in front of a big local and catches the Indian as he comes stumbling
He holds onto him, looking at the faces that turn his way
Ray steps up beside him, looking tense
What's goin' on here
(a beat) can't walk across the goddamn street without some breed-ass fallin' all over me
And then Cooch shoves the Indian with all his might back across the road
The locals resume their fun, and Cooch looks at a local man and shares a chattering laugh that makes Ray do a serious take
Watch out now, he wants a kiss, Ray, wants a kiss -- The Indian ends up stumbling back toward Ray, and Ray catches him this time
The man maintains a perfect vacant expression and keeps acting as though nothing of the sort is happening
But he is dizzy, and exhausted, and Ray keeps him from falling
Cooch looks at Ray
Their eyes meet
Ray shoves the man forward
This time, instead of catching him, the local on the receiving end, hauls off and punches him in the face
The Indian drops
Cooch runs in, grabs the Indian under the arms and drags him back to his car
Go ahead, skin, get your ass back on your sacred land
Get outta here
He shoves him behind the wheel as the locals crowd around
They don't see Cooch throw the wheel stick in drive, and lean into the man's ear
Get outta here
Drive
Cooch slams the door, and kicks it, and the vehicle lurches forward
beer can clanks off the rear window, and rolls clanking into the middle of the road
Ray stands there with the locals as they all watch the car drive off across the reservation line
Cooch, belly sticking out of his unbuttoned shirt, and a breathless smile on his face, heads to the bar without breaking stride
This man has done "underground" before
-  - Cooch and Ray sit in a booth with  , a strapping local man, ranch-raised, and gentlemanly
In fact, downright likeable
So what type of salesmen are you gentlemen anyway
Liquor
We heard they like their drink on the reservation, and we were gonna see if we couldn't unload some surplus on the way to Nebraska
Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz  don't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here
Hey, Brooks, come over here
want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver
, a small, older man with a feed store cap and a clean cowboy shirt, comes over with a beer and a pensive look on his face
He pulls up a chair and positions himself at the end of the booth
Liquor salesmen
Be nice to them, maybe they'll give you a sample of some of that gin you like
(to Ray) He likes that Russian shit that -- They ain't liquor salesmen
They're Cooch and Ray don't flinch
Dennis does
He looks between the two, cautiously
Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow like you, doing in a joint like this
Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like
What you investigatin'
murder
On the reservation
Again
Figures, man
You'll never find out who did it
You underestimate me, Brooks
No
You underestimate these grass niggers
They're killing each other
That's all they do
Get drunk and kill each other
Then cover for each other
Who gives a damn really as long as they stay on their reservation
You ask me, the government shouldn't care one particle
You know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans
Well out here we got Indians
That's just the way it is
The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does that old adage still hold true out here
Cooch laughs good-naturedly
Ray smiles
But Brooks looks offended
That set-to you saw out front, was nothin' more than a message we were sendin' to the sonsabitches that are divertin' water from the river
We got rights
We got a ranch just up here
Ray catches this
Glances a look off Cooch who works on a cold draught beer
Did any of you gentlemen know Leo Fast Elk
Both men shake their heads
Get quiet
You fellas are here to investigate a Indian crime, you should keep to Indian land, and talk to them, not us
But you wanna drink here and shoot stick here, that's your right, and we respect that
(to Dennis) Come on, Son, we're up on the table
You fellas wanna play doubles
Cooch shakes his head, distracted, and the two locals leave, enroute for the pool table
Ray watches them go, curious
- Ray and Cooch, cross the street back to the motel
It is black and chillingly still
Water
Worth killing for out here, 'd think
Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars
already did
Cooch looks at Ray, impressed
Couldn't sleep
Good
They stop in front of their rooms and Cooch pulls a small tape recorder from his waistband
micro-cassette recorder that he examines in the dim door light
(locals) -- out here we got our Indians
And that's the way it is
Cooch shuts it off
By the time you get to the main village, sun'll be up
want you to fraternize
Socialize
Penetrate
Infiltrate
Eat some raw kidney, and get these Indians talking
'm gonna Powwow with Big Chief Clear Moon and find out more about Leo
He hands Ray the recorder
Done
Cooch starts for his room but in a long, exaggerated country step as he breaks into the   tune that has all but driven him insane inside the joint
Ray watches him go, and cracks a laugh
-  - Ray's at the wheel, looks intense as he studies the vast expanse of slopes and rock formations and the rising sphere of flame that lights the road in strange color
He is reading a name list that he traps against the wheel
Hobert Standing-Buffalo-That-Walks- Dreamer
(a dry run) Hello, 'm looking for Hobert Standing- Buffalo-That-Walks
Dreamer
Ray pulls up a long dirt drive and parks
- Ray walks to the front door of a war-torn trailer that is halfway swallowed by weeds and plants
It is static out here
Dead still
Ray approaches the front door
There is a huge hole in it
He knocks above the hole
After a moment, the door opens a crack
dark, weather-beaten face barely shows
Good morning
'm looking for Hobert- Buffalo-Dreaming
(cheat sheet) Hobert Standing-Buffalo-That-Walks-- The door closes
Locks
--Dreamer
Ray stands there for a moment then lowers himself to look through the huge hole in the door
Sir
tattered chair is pushed against the door, covering the hole
Ray stands up, turns on the steps
And before he can let out a flustered sigh, he spots something across the dirt road
Something that makes him remove his shades, look again
Whatever it is, it doesn't make him happy, and he is hurrying across the road
- motorcycle, parked between the road and the badlands
We've seen the ancient bike before
Ray walks past it, looking at it
He pushes his shades up on the bridge of his nose and looks down into the moonscape
Walter Crow Horse is down there, on his haunches, "feel tracking", laying his fingers inside tracks and reading them
He doesn't even look up at the sound of the  agent's footsteps
Ray Little Weasel
like the way ya sneaked up on me
Must be Indian
The wind whistles and moans through the Badlands as Crow Horse continues feel tracking
What are you -- Watch out
Ray draws back
What
You're steppin' on sign
Crow Horse lowers his face to the ground and blows some scattered dust out of a print
Lightly lays his fingers inside Hey
(ignored) Hey, you, listen up -- -- Leo wasn't killed here
He was dumped here
Out of a vehicle
Bald tread
Muffler held on with baling wire
Crow Horse checks out another track
The man you want
stepped outta the car, dragged Leo out, laid him down
Then walked over here and made a circle in the earth with a stick
can't find the stick
He stuck an eagle plume in the circle, got back in his car, dustin' his own prints with a pine bough for about six feet, but he missed a print, right here, see
He got in his car and went Hell- bent-for-Holy-Sunday outta here
He ditched that pine bough three miles across the flat, in the Little Bear River, it floated down to Thundershield Gap
The car hit paved road, and was outta here
Crow Horse rises, points down the road
The killin' was done where Leo's mother lives
But he was driven here into these Badlands
Ray is frowning at the big Indian, trying to get a fix on this Big sonuvabuck
Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases
'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen -- Bullshit
-- Well, maybe two-seventeen
You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track
No
Not just a track
You gotta listen to the trees, man
To the leaves
To this sand, you 's kicked all up
You gotta listen to the earth
Is that right
Well, listen to this: drag your ass
This is a restricted area
No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and  want the dog-fucker who killed Leo
Whether you get him or get him,  just want him
Shit's been goin' on too long
You've got no jurisdiction
You got no know-how
About Indian Way
Or about Jack Shit for that matter
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but  just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics,  fingerprinting; don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers
Leo was killed right here
Go back to the
, take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there
Trust me, there ain't chickens in the Badlands
His mother's place is -- -- his mother never lived here
She was from up in North Dakota
'm talkin' his spiritual mother
Maisy Blue Legs
His spiritual mother
To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family
've got seven mothers on this reservation
Sisters
Brothers
You ain't one of them
Thank God
Now listen to me, asshole
'm giving you a break
But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security
Easy
Easy
'm goin'
Crow Horse walks back up toward the road
Ray lets him leave then crouches where Crow Horse was, begins looking at tracks
(
) Hey, Little Weasel
Ray turns, and sees Crow Horse perched on a high bank -- the one Ray came down -- and he's in a tracking stance
You weigh one sixty-three, yeah
Not a beer drinker
You're one of these tofu and pilaf characters
Pack your gun, under your coat -- left shoulder
But you got backup; a little
32, 38 maybe, in a ankle holster that gives you a right foot drag, Shoes are too tight at the toe but, man, they look cool
And that's what counts
Ray just stands frozen, blown away
Crow Horse rises, dusting off his hands, and heading to his vehicle
Crow Horse
The Indian turns
The wind moans
Ray scrutinizes him, deliberating
Fuck you
Crow Horse grins and waves, and ambles away Ray stands, sweating under his suit jacket, and not sure if he's amazed or pissed off
- trailer sits off from the river in beaten solitude
There are two junked cars and one burned black
Wind blows across deep bald tire tracks
Ray walks slowly beside them, surveying, following them to a place where they become puckers and skids next to a dilapidated outhouse
There is a shotgun blast in the side of it
Ray studies it, enters the outhouse
Exits, and walks the rutted gumbo earth to where it meets rolling hills of golden grass
He stands here, mesmerized
scratch around in the dirt
Like so many far-off res homesteads, this is a haunting place
Made more so by a persistent , a rusty, metallic squeal coming from -- across the yard, where   , a Sioux elder, works the handle
She wears thick bifocals and keeps her hair under a bandanna
No water comes forth from the pump, and she tries again and again until she breaks a sweat
And then she sees the waal'cu standing out there
Urgently, she turns and starts back to her trailer with an empty coffee can
Ray starts after her
Mrs
Blue Legs
Can  ask you a few questions -- (1/3 res speed) -- go away
Leave us alone
Ma'am, Please -- She mounts the metal steps
Ray is losing her
He gets a foot on the bottom step, and attempts something he does not want to do
Mrs
Blue Legs
'm Indian
Halfway through the screendoor, Maisy turns and looks at the young man in suit and shades
'm Sioux
Maisy lowers her bifocals, studies him
Then walks in, slaps the door shut, and locks it
towel hung as a shade folds down
Ray lingers at the bottom of the steps
Yeah, right
And he walks around the side of the trailer, looking at the ground
In the gaping space between the trailer blocks, and the grass, there is much junk stored, and Ray kneels to look
He is drawn to a pair of cowboy boots, caked with dried mud
He picks up a boot, looks at the sole, then touches the mud
His fingers break through the hardened crust and come back moist and blue
He looks at this sniffs it
There is a tense, water-torture like tempo coming from the old pump where water barely drips onto a hub cap in the dirt
Ray sets the boot down
Goes to grab the other boot and -- a     coils out from the shade of the boot,  and  from white mouth and three- inch fangs, and Ray has done a backflip and roll, slapping his shoulder holster and pulling lead and
he unloads two, and the reptile is so dead, there's not even enough snake left to make a truck-stop key chain
He kneels there, flushed in the face, holding his breath and double-clutching his gun
The   through the Badlands like the aftermath of dynamite
From inside the trailer, he can hear
low moaning
Praying softly
Shit
Mrs
Blue Legs
It's okay
Then his
() X21, give me a 20
(yelling) Black Tail District, X22
You ready for this
Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands
found the location
Maisy Blue Legs place
How'd you know
got one up on ya
Go ahead
've got the doer
know who he is
Ray looks relieved
Meet me at base
Over
Cooch
You're my hero
Ray looks down at the dead snake, still rushed from it, and he hurries out of there
the snake's  moves spasmodically, still kicking with reflex
-    - an  , flapping in the hot night wind
But something is wrong about the image
The flag is hung upside lit by -- full moon that also illuminates an overgrown field that fronts a small, one-level house where the flag hangs
Three old cars decorate the front yard
busted screendoor creaks in the wind, and somewhere off in the hills, a away his boredom
(
) Jimmy Looks Twice
Couture and  Levoi sit inside the car, staking out this little place far down a dirt road on the outskirts of the settlement
Cooch has the suspect's file on his knee
Who is he
One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations
Militant organization
He hands an open file over to Ray
-  : a raging fire and six long-haired, fist-raising Indians, yelling at the camera
(
) The progressive Indians don't like them because they want everybody to go back to the old Indian ways, and the old way Indians don't like them because they use violence to get attention
2 -- a big Indian in a wheel chair, holding a rifle
He is shirtless under a vest and on his muscular right shoulder there is a clearly defined tattoo of a circle with an eagle feather through it
3 -- a Close Up of the tattoo
4 -- a propaganda flyer with the letters
and the same symbol -- perfect circle, pierced by a white eagle feather
White eagle feather through the circle
That's their symbol
That's right
Ray shuffles through more of the same with great interest
They obviously wanted it to be known that they offed Leo
Some kind of statement
Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago
And threatened him several times since
President Clear Moon and the regional feel he made good on that threat
Cooch takes a long, tight breath then turns around in his seat, coming up with an -16
Ray lifts one of his own
He looks out the car window
'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down
Easy, Cowboy
No vendettas on my ship
Now: remember what  told you about Nam
Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker
Alright
Alright
Cooch whacks a top clip into the -16
Ray slams a clip in his
It's show time
Car doors open in skillful silence
-  - and Ray maneuver toward the house, rifles ready
Cooch gets under the picture window, sneaks a look
Nothing
He follows Ray around the side
: off in a backfield, lit by a hot fire, a small round hut covered in patchwork quilts, canvas and buffalo hide strange mist floats around it, and from inside, voices are heard --     in
And
Dozens of shrill whistles
Are there birds inside this thing
- and Cooch, kneeling in the weeds, look dumbfounded
And more than a little unnerved
(whispering) What the hell is that
An     with shoulder length hair falling over a -shirt, steps out of the dark and walks to the fire
He prods it with a broken pitch fork
He turns to get some more wood and walks right into an -16, trained chest level
Ray stares him down
On the ground
The boy drops boot camp fast
Cooch moves up on the sweat lodge, looking quizzically at it, trying to figure out how to open it
He grabs a canvas flap at the front and after a moment's hesitation and a look at Ray, he tears the flap away
200   explodes forth and Cooch dances back, throwing up his rifle
(
) (inside lodge) Mitakue Oyasin
, a rail-thin Sioux elder, appears through the steam like a vision
Bent in the tiny doorway, he searches out the interruption
Cooch aims the -16 at the old man
This is the
Come on out of there nice and slow
Let's move it
Hands on your head
Grandpa Reaches crawls out first, ignoring the "Hands on your head" order from Cooch
His eyes move back and forth between the two agents
, from 16-45 come out, looking confused
Cooch makes the towel-wrapped men spread out in a line
The old man is speaking to the others in , and Ray steps up to him, cuts him off
Hands on your head, Sir
Come on, come on
The archaic figure just looks through him
Starts to walk away
Ray takes his thin arm
He locks eyes with the old man
Slowly, he obeys, raising his hands and laying them on his head
From the lodge, the last man emerges
It's Crazy Horse reborn out of the burning sage
is in his mid- thirties -- big, well over two-hundred pounds
But lean
His braids fall nearly to his hips
His face is handsome but at the moment, twisted in a full-blood's scowl
(outraged) What are you doing
James Looks Twice
That's right
What are you doing here
This is a religious ceremony you're desecrating
Looks Twice shoots hawk-like black eyes onto Ray
We're , James
We just need to ask you a few questions
We are in the middle of a sweat lodge ceremony
Do you drag people out of your churches when they're in the middle of prayer
Let's take a walk, Jimmy
Come on
Cooch takes a careful step behind Jimmy and cuffs him
Looks Twice speaks to the others in , and they disband, heading to a shade arbor where their clothes hang
As Cooch starts marching Looks Twice toward the house, Ray keeps an eye on the departing
One of them stops halfway to the fence and turns
Grandpa Reaches looks at Ray with eyes that have seen one hundred and one hard years in Indian Country
Go ahead
You can all go home
And he follows Cooch and the cuffed Jimmy to the house
We just wanna take a look around your place, Jimmy
We're not here to bust your balls
Cooch leads the half-naked suspect to the backdoor
Cooch show: a warrant, tries the door but it is locked
What's this about
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk
You think  killed him
Cuz he was an apple
Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man -- -- don't "man" me, Jimmy
Where's the key
Jimmy doesn't answer
He glares with hatred into Cooch's eyes
Ray, use the federal master key
Ray steps up, gets ready to throw a frontkick at the door
No
Don't do that
Don't deface the property, man
The key's in there
With his hands cuffed, he can only jerk his head toward a big hole in the wall down near the foundation
Cooch quickly drops to a knee and checks out the hole
Inside
in the coffee can
Cooch reaches in, probes
There's no coffee can in -- Something horrifying happens so fast, Cooch has no time to react
Whatever has taken his arm has done so with such force, his body jolts like he's touched raw voltage
The South Dakota rips through his leather jacket -- we get a glimpse of its striped face and yellowed teeth -- through his shirt
Through flesh, and deeper,  insanely while in shock tries to pull free and -- Jimmy Looks Twice spins from the porch with a skillfully executed back kick, knocking Ray off the step and to the ground
The Indian bolts like a deer into the darkness
Ray rolls in the grass, throwing his -16 up
He hesitates
But only for a moment before  and decimating the corner gutter, a junked car, several trees
But no sign of Jimmy
Cooch falls back in the grass badly mauled
His arm has been ripped open down to the bone
Jesus
Jesus
Ray starts toward Cooch
Get him
Ray takes off, crashing through weeds, into a stream, wading through mud
He throws his flashlight left and right
He crosses the river, shines the light in a field of wild sage
Nothing
He runs like a sprinter, looking everywhere
But as he enters an -- all he finds is Jimmy's towel
He picks it up and looks around the area, breathing heavily
And then suddenly, something leaps up out of the grass
Ray swings his -16 up, ready to blast
But it is a , taking off into a mystical blue night
Beating fast
Heavy
Cooch traps his bleeding arm between his knees to stanch the blood
He speaks quietly but firm into his radio, trying to stay in control
(into radio) Assault on federal officers
Suspect has left the area
One officer down
Issue a Fugitive Alert immediately
Over
Has the officer been shot, -22
No, the officer's been bitten by a fucking badger, okay
Get a Fugitive Alert fucking now
Over
-  - mind-blowing Aurora
Living clouds
The incredible mesa
slowly to the dirt road where a line of federal aerials high, enter Indian Country
But a fast heartbeat
relentless pulse throughout -- surround a little tar-paper shack, rifles up and ready
Two go in, and flush out an  , an  , and some
that has thirty junked cars in its yard and serves as a reservation parts store is crawling with ; car doors are being opened, trunks run through the cars
--    1- ""  chutters low over the grasslands, over the Badlands, flattening wheat
It swings down over the main settlement
gather in the street to look up at it but then run when -- --    come down the main road
They pass by -- --        where Ray stands, talking to the elders
few of the same from earlier but several new ones
He is sweat-drenched, and has shed his jacket and tie
He is showing them photos of Jimmy but getting no response
And then, for a little iodine on top of that, a  , spitting and choking and coughing comes around the corner, Walter Crow Horse, manning the handlebars
He pulls up to Ray and just looks at him
You're an easy man to track, Ray
Ya walk like a penguin with a hard-on
Is that right
What are the trees saying today
They're sayin' that nobody's gonna talk to you cuz they don't give away one of their own
But they did say there's somebody way across the Little Walking River who wants to talk to you
Ray soaks sweat off his forehead as he eyes the Indian on this one
He sees himself in the polaroid shades
He sent me to find ya
He says he's got information
Let's go
Ray quickly leaves the porch
-   - Silent
The unnerving silence of the Great Plains filled only by , big horseflies, buzzing around drying sage that hangs from the rafters of a shade arbor
stands under it, just gazing across -- the vast spread of grass and dry land where an ancient Airstream trailer sits lop-sided
Sheets are hung as curtains
Six old cars -- two from the early 50'a -- sit stripped to the hubs on blocks in the overgrown grass
The air is dry and heavy and the only sound is -- Ray swats at them as he steps over a truck seat that lies in the grass, stuffing and springs hanging out
Crow Horse walk
a few steps ahead, toward the trailer
(with reverence) Grandpa Samuel Reaches
Heavy duty medicine
Medicine
As in medicine man
Crow Horse nods slowly, looking at Ray in a very serious manner Why does he wanna see me
Good question
Hardly sees anybody anymore
Hasn't left this place in twenty years
Did you bring some tobacco
Crow Horse stops walking, making Ray do the same
When you go see an elder, you always bring some tobacco as a gift
Ray reaches into his shirt pocket and fishes out a pack of Marlboro
Crow Horse glances at it, and shrug-nods
They continue on toward the trailer
Grandpa Samuel Reaches sits in a taped and tuckered easy chair, his alert black eyes moving from side to side
We recognize him from the sweat lodge ceremony at Looks Twice' although today he wears a straw cowboy hat giving him a more youthful look despite a face like a map of the Badlands
He wears a vest over a western shirt, baggy work slacks, old cowboy boots
His brown wrinkled hands run over the top of the Marlboro pack as if he's reading braille
Crow Horse sits across from him on a stool
Ray leans on one of the plain green walls, looking uncomfortable
three foot adhesive fly strip hangs from the ceiling, thick with dead ones
There is a black and white  with Sesame Street wailing, honking and guffawing through static
Grandpa fixes his eyes on Ray for only split seconds at a time but one gets the feeling he's doing an incredibly deep reading of the young man
Slowly, he sits up -- focusing intensely on Ray
He begins to speak
hoarse, strained, string of , spoken like it used to be, gesturing toward Ray
When he finishes, he sits back in his chair
Ray looks intrigued
What did he say
He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster
He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster
Ray looks puzzled
Crow Horse laughs bull-wild as Grandpa takes up a fly swatter and takes out a big horsefly
The old man begins speaking Indian again
He says there's something wrong with Big Bird -- he's crazy, (stops laughing) He says you stopped the Inipi ceremony last night
Crow Horse turns a questioning look at Ray
Ray doesn't flinch
But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you
He knows me
He says he saw you in a vision some time ago
Crow Horse stops translating suddenly even though the old man continues speaking
Crow Horse looks concerned, and We don't know what he's asking but the tone is absolute amazement
This question triggers an exchange between he and Grandpa, the old one getting angry
Grandpa wins
guess he had this vision some time ago, in the Moon of the Popping Trees -- uh, back in the winter
He says you come from Wasi'cu city in the East but that your people
way back
are of the Minniconjou Sioux
But you yourself don't know that
Ray's brow is drawn tense as he stares at the old Indian, absorbing the translation
Grandpa speaks more fervently now, incorporating Indian sign
Each time Grandpa does the hard Sioux  , Ray blinks
He says he knew you'd be coming to Bear Creek
He was told
It is the will of Tunkasilia -- the grandfather that you come here
He says let's smoke the caanunpa the sacred pipe, symbol of truth
So that there will be no lies between us
The old man has taken a long wooden stem and a red stone bowl from a beaded pipe bag
He joins the two together then begins offering a pinch of tobacco to the Four Directions
While this goes on, Ray fidgets
What's he smoke in that
Sacred herbs
Tobacco
Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe
That's a white man's myth
This is a sacrament
The old man is offering the pipe to Ray
Mltaku Oyasin
Ray looks at Grandpa
The old man offers the pipe again
You don't smoke with him, it means you're hiding something
Ray takes the pipe, looks at it
then passes it to Crow Horse
The big Indian takes it from Ray, giving him a long eye, then offering the pipe to The Directions before smoking
Crow Horse puffs hard, eyes closed, then slowly releases some smoke upward
Ray watches it climb and fade
The old man then takes up an old turtle shell rattle
He speaks
He says Wakan
Sacred
Five hundred year old turtleshell rattle, passed down from the Grandfathers
Heavy duty
He shakes the rattle very slightly, moving it in front of Ray
He speaks just above a whisper
He says, it is good
The Spirits are here
The Spirits want to know what you're doing here
Ray smirks
Tell him 'm trying to find the man who murdered Leo Fast Elk
Ask him if he knows where he is
Crow Horse asks the old man in Lakota
No answer
The pipe is back to grandpa, and he offers it to the Directions, to the Earth then upward before smoking himself
He begins to speak again
Passionately
In long glottal Sioux sentences, adding sign, fingers crossing, brushing an arm, a slap here and there, He is working himself into an excited state, and Ray keeps looking at Crow Horse, very interested in the old man's answer
Finally Grandpa's breath comes up short and wheezing, he ends his oratory with a solid hand slap
What did he say
He said he doesn't know
He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux
What did he say
Crow Horse ignores him
Grandpa speaks again
More hand language
The old man is staring at Ray while whispering to Crow Horse
He strokes his badger claw necklace
Crow Horse looks at Ray and seems hesitant to translate this new piece of information
Uh
Grandpa likes to trade; no one stops by here without gettin' stuck in the old Indian barter
He, uh
he likes your shades
Grandpa smiles toothlessly
Ray who has his driving glasses in hand, lifts them to say "these
" but Grandpa sees it as an accepted deal, and swiftly removes his necklace
He holds it out
Ray slowly, hesitantly surrenders his sunglasses, and takes the necklace
Crow Horse bursts into laughter and so does Grandpa, enjoying a good trade
He draws a hand through the air in a sort of horizontal karate chop, meaning done deal
Ray looks confused
Out of his element
And out of his shades
Another fly gets snagged on sticky tape
Crow Horse is hurrying toward his bike, Ray with him
What was he saying
Why should  tell you
Because he was talking to me
Crow Horse keeps walking
Does he know something
Crow Horse stops walking and eyes Ray, deliberating
The old man saw an owl
Over there in the dry wash
Last week
And
He saw an owl
silent moment
Ray tries to figure out what he's missing here
So what
The owl is a messenger
When one shows itself to a Sioux
it means someone's gonna die
The owl told him about Leo
Ray stares vacantly
The owl told him about Leo
That's incredible
guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn't we
Evidence doesn't get any harder than that -- not for my money
Is there anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court
He also said "listen to the water
" Listen to the water
Listen to the owl
He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster
Go back to your  finger-printin'
Crow Horse   his bike and burns off down the drive Ray feels the presence of the old man, standing behind the busted screen door
Just watching
,
-, , that takes us straight into -- -  - -- painted in blazing red and yellow, black around the eyes
ridge of feathers high along the hairline, and a mouth open, tongue trilling --
is going down
Powow
Held in the center of a huge arbor
This , a traditional Kit Fox dancer, is dressed in authentic costume and is dancing with   dressed in various traditional garb and paints
Under the arbor,    in modern clothing sit on blankets or in lawn chairs, watching the dancing
group of  sit around a big drum, beating on it, and wailing the song that keeps the dancers hopping
(res beaters) are parked off around the arbor, less interested kids sitting on them, smoking cigarettes few actually have  hair-cuts
Drifting through the cars and people are Special Agents Couture, Miles, Sherman and Levoi
They stroll through, incongruously, checking out faces
Vehicles
Ray slows his step and takes in -- as the dance ends
The  , a big Sioux with a crew-cut and cowboy shirt, speaks through a scratchy
system
Was-te Yelo
Let's have five more veterans
Five more veterans
Hoka Hey
An -  sitting in a lawn chair, removes his cowboy hat and reaches down toward a blanket
He brings up his hat, adorned with medals and puts it on
Slowly, he rises, and shuffles out to the center pole along with -- who have exchanged cowboy hats for veteran's caps
There is even a traditional dancer in there, wearing a veteran cap
As a mournful   is banged out by the singers, a flag is unrolled by the veterans
An American Flag
Unrolled, and set on the mast
And together, all five Indian men, hoist -- high
Slowly it climbs
Proudly
It blows in the hot South Dakota wind
Ray stands, watching this
And then the
loud, angry voice breaks across the
'  (' ) , a young Indian in ribbon shirt and long hair has taken possession of the microphone
stand behind him
He speaks loud, firm, with the sharp gestures of an old way Chief
What is that that you honor there, uncles
After all the Wasi'cu country has done to you, after all he still does to you, you honor that flag
That flag has been desecrated by the United States, because they have not honored what that flag represents
The veterans just stand under the flag, solemn, looking at Chasing Hawk
The flag undulates soundlessly
(
) To them, we are the Bank of America
Whenever they get into a little difficulty, they go to The Bank, withdraw a little land, withdraw a little oil -- the four  agents stand, watching
Okay
Here we go
Who's this guy
Anderson Chasing Hawk
Second in command behind Jimmy
' Chasing Hawk hands the mic over to another Warrior would be the most beautiful woman Ray has even seen if she was not the meanest-looking
Her thick black hair falls over a denim jacket down below her horse-hair belt
Her faded jeans are stuffed into worn cowboy boots
And she is full of fire
She begins speaking in
Fluently
And with hand sign, like the old man
the agents stand
Cooch is writing into a small notebook
Magedelana Eagle Bear
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls
She keeps an -15 assault rifle in her truck
And she'll use it
As Ray watches her, someone approaches in a less hostile manner
It is President Clear Moon, looking very upset
He holds the hand of a  , dressed in traditional dancing garb
He approaches Ray
Mr
Clear Moon
Our police are afraid of them
Please get them out of here
Clear Moon gestures for the little girl to run off
He leans in close to Ray
They're going to kill me next
That's what  hear
These new Indians are destroying everything
Our people are a quiet people
They can lead us to Jimmy
Just let them go
We're tightening the net on him
We know he's on the reservation
Clear Moon is looking past Ray at the Warriors
They are approaching the agents, and Clear Moon looks at Ray with great concern
Help us
And he slowly retreats to his lawn chair under the arbor
Chasing Hawk, Maggie and the other Warriors strut up to the agents
All but one who is bound to a wheelchair
We've seen , the big Cheyenne who wears a Red Power baseball cap, an earring, and thick bifocals -- in one of the file photos
His arms are plastered with tattoos
Where's Jimmy
We thought he'd be dancing today
The warriors make a show of not acknowledging the presence
They have walked over here just to walk by them
That is there statement
But Yellow Bird stops cranking the wheels of his chair and stop: long enough to look up at Ray
Are you the Washington Redskin
Even the agents crack grins at this bit of Indian wit
All but Ray who just stands there, arms folded across his chest, considering the crippled activist
Say hello to Richard Yellow Bird, Ray
Yellow Bird sits there, staring up at him through thick glasses But then Maggie Eagle Bear takes the handles of Yellow Bird's wheel chair
She looks at Ray with eyes that are choke- cherry black, eyes that look right through him
He returns the glare
And then she pushes Yellowbird forward and leaves the feds alone
Ray turns to Cooch who is lighting a cigarette, and concentrating on the movements of this group as they wander under the arbor, visiting people
start up
Ray, get to Jimmy's place and keep it tight
'm gonna get a tail on his Warriors
the under ten year-old "fancy dance" -- - , whirling and stomping and dancing
- The battered old house sits under a full moon
The upside down flag moves slightly in the cross winds
several junked cars
Among them a black, rusted out  van with a smashed windshield
sniff at its tires
' In the dim light, a boot
black cowboy boot
Up on the dash
Bluejeans
-shirt
Second hand leather
And a black cowboy hat
Ray is staking out Jimmy's house
Across the passenger seat and console is an -16 rifle
On his belt, a
357 Red Hawk
He yawns
From outside, he hears a sound
: down below the van, a small, patchy   with a missing leg is looking up at him with his tongue long and salivating
breaks off a piece of sandwich and drops it down to him just as --  catch his face
He slides down low, watching an old pick-up truck creak onto the dirt road, leading to Jimmy's
: the truck parks
Someone jumps out, gracefully
Indian
Long braid
Quick steps
Front door
Inside
lifts his radio
X22
Read
Go ahead, Ray
have a pick-up truck
No plates
Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house
Over
Okay, Ray
'm coming in
If he starts to leave the area, move in
And hold him
Over
Ray sets his radio down, unclips the leather guard on his handgun
Picks up the Big Mac
- The front door creaks open, and the subject dashes back out
In the dark we cannot latch onto features
Suddenly the junker van comes alive, guns onto the dirt road, racing toward the running Indian who gets the door of the truck open but freezes in the van's highbeams as -- Ray leaps out, -16 in hand
, freeze, Motherfucker -- drop it, drop it
Ray maneuvers in Quantico fashion, keeping the rifle on the Indian's back
The Indian drops what he's holding
And turns around
It's not a he
We've seen her before
At the Powwow
Maggie Eagle Bear
Her hair is pulled back tight, braided
Ray moves in toward her, surprised at first, but still cautious Turn around, put your hands on the roof of the truck
She does what he tells her
As Ray moves in on her, he notices an   sitting in the passenger seat, looking out into the highbeams, frightened
Ray toes Maggie's legs out wider, frisks her one-handed, pats down her boots
You're the Indian
That's right
Turn around
Maggie turns around, looks Ray in the eye
He looks self- conscious in the cowboy hat
The people are glad they sent you
They usually send in guys who come at ya with highbeams, screamin' "drop it, Motherfucker", stick a gun in your face, frisk ya down
Even if ya got a child with ya
No, it's good to have ya
It's gonna be was-te times on the res
Ray is looking down at what she dropped
bundle lying in the grass
He bends down, starts to untie it
was gonna warn ya about messin' with somebody's medicine bundle but forgot you know all about that stuff
-- an eagle skull, tobacco strings, sage, sweet grass, and several white eagle feathers
This Jimmy's
You're not gonna catch him
He can shape-shift into different animals
Bear
Elk
Porcupine
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes
Jimmy didn't kill Leo
Why do you wanna do this
He tried to kill him twice before
That's a good place to start don't ya think
Leo was on the other side, wasn't he
-- Leo was an apple, that's right
Red on the outside, white on the inside
And Jimmy hated him
Kicked his ass a coupla times
But he didn't kill him
Who did
You're the
That's your job, isn't it
Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here
never saw any investigating then
Why now
What's going down here
Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect
Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine
Try the Fort Laramie Treaty
All over again
Ray doesn't have a clue as to what this radical bullshit is about
Look
You and  can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what's right and what's wrong
You're from the reservation
It's a different world
'm from Minneapolis
Fifth Street
did four years at Dartmouth before ever set foot on this res
So know about the other world, Ray
If this information doesn't throw Ray, the use of his first name does
Are you gonna keep that medicine bundle or are you gonna respect its power
Ray is holding the medicine bundle
He deliberates, then hands it over
She takes it with careful hands, casting a somewhat surprised look up at him
Thank you
When you see Jimmy, tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in
the sooner we back off this reservation
Okay
Maggie gets in the truck, starts it up
She looks out at him, studying him
Trying to figure him out
are coming fast from down the main road
Grandpa Reaches says you come from heavy Indian blood
used to think Grandpa was gettin' senile
Now know he is
Move it, Magdelana
Maggie drives forward, turning down another little wagon road, and bumping into the black night only moments before, Cooch's Le Baron pulls in
Miles and Sherman's vehicle pull in behind it
The regional feds fall in behind Cooch, everyone, packing rifles
Ray, you alright
Ray turns, nodding
An  van pulls in from the other direction and   empty out, wearing  windbreakers and heavily-armed
What do we got, Ray
It was just Eagle Bear
questioned and released her
What'd she say
She talks a lot of shit
We're not doing our job
Jimmy's innocent
"What's the  really doing here
" Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty
Cooch nods
The agents form a tight unit out below the upside down flag
She took something from the house
What she called a medicine bundle
Most likely Jimmy's
Let's see it
gave it back to her
Why
If it is Jimmy's, she's taking it to him
We'll have a runner
But borrowed a little mojo
Ray reaches inside his pant leg, down around his boot and carefully removes a white eagle feather
He gingerly tucks it in a plastic bag
Way to go, Raymond
Miles, take that to lab
Sherman,  want you to go back to base and produce some written material
Something that indicates that our girl Maggie is leaking information to us
And make sure that material finds its way into the hands of the Warrior Movement
Sherman and Miles, take off
Cooch, an impressive master of , now turns to the van squad
You gentlemen missed that medicine basket
Go back through the house, and make sure you missed nothing else
And lay some wire, too
Let's do it
The van squad moves toward the house, leaving Cooch and Ray alone in the highbeams that light the yard
That's good goddamn work, Ray
Let the salmon run
Let 'em run Upriver
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant
Her own people start to suspect her, it creates discord from within
The Warriors don't know who to trust, they start infighting, and Jimmy loses his support
Ray nods, impressed
Cooch bends down near the road, touches the dirt
Her oil pan is shot
Cooch
What's the Fort Laramie Treaty
Jesus,  don't know
You tell me
You're the Indian
Cooch wipes the oil on a handkerchief as he rises, smiling playfully at Ray
He starts back toward his car
Some sort of bird is  in the night
Get a tail on her, Ray
Ray looks up at the upside down flag
Then watches Cooch walking way
Cooch
(a quiet, tired laugh) Where the fuck did they send us
long way from home
You be careful out there
Cooch, standing there with his glasses on and his right arm bandaged, looks tired, too
He gets in his car
In the yard, Ray starts for the van, the res dog, trying to follow
He chases it away
And then as he gets closer to the van, he looks up to investigate the
there is a shadow
What looks to be a large bird
It just hovers
In the shadows
Ray looks up at the pole, watching
Then walking on
- Mind-blowing sunrise of airbrush red
Clusters of lodge-pole pine
The spectacular mesa
graze in a field, a few out in the center of the road
the old man comes down the front steps in a frail walk, carrying a paper plate
He steps down into the sage clusters that grow just off his trailer, and offers the plate up toward the sky
He then stoops, and scrapes a half-eaten English muffin, some potato chips and half a banana onto the Earth in a neat pile
He straightens his back the best he can, looks up again, and prays softly
possess an otherworldly beauty at this magic hour, a maze of shadows and rainbows
In the distance we cannot mistake the frame of Walter Crow Horse
He's out there, long hair blowing against the white bluffs
Stalking
Tracking
a puppy chases a hen in a klutzy, innocent manner then bumps into the tire of a parked car
Taking a shot at doghood, he hikes his leg, squirts a hubcap belonging to -- Cooch's Le Baron
Cooch leans on the hood, drinking a coffee from a foam-plastic cup, and supervising  - who have a map spread out over the hood and are discussing it
' is way out in a remote corner of the res, a little home, trailer and tipi right on the river
The river is rushing hard this morning, catching the light of the sun
Maggie's truck is parked in front
Out at the river, Maggie, her hair long and unbrushed, and wearing an extra large -shirt and nothing else is hauling water in buckets from the river
are with her, helping her
Near the house, an   in bifocal glasses, feeds some chickens, and a cat that gathers with the chickens and eats feed
' Ray, still in his field clothes sits, training binoculars on the distant house
He opens a carton of milk, drinks some
Then hears a whimpering
In the passenger seat sits the three legged res dog
Ray has taken him with him
He drinks some milk, then opens the carton up fully and sticks it out so the dog can lap it up
Ray laughs in disbelief, shaking his head
For all  know, you're Jimmy
And you're just waiting for a shot at my jugular
Drink, Jimmy
Milk is good for you -- The dog is lapping the milk, desperately
And then a
motorcycle
: Crow Horse, racing up on the left of the van
Ray pulls his hat down low, and sits back
The motorcycle passes on the left, slowing enough so that Crow Horse can flip Ray the middle finger
Then he races on, far down the road
Ray sits there, shaking his head
He'll let it go
Bullshit
He starts the car
- Crow Horse guns in, sliding in dirt up to the run-down, low budget shooting range -- six plastic milk jugs on sticks, jammed in the mud
moment later, the van hammers in
Parks
Ray gets out
He's removed his hat so as not to invite any crap from Crow Horse
Don't be mad
That was just an old traditional gesture that means hello, how are you
see
Forgive my cultural ignorance
Ray executes a hard, slapping, "up your ass" gesture
Have a nice day
Crow Horse bursts into laughter in his raspy, staccato laugh
He walks off a few steps, picks up a spent shell and pitches it
His laughter simmers and he gets serious
Jimmy didn't do it, Ray
checked it out
You can stop taggin' my sister
She's your sister
Spiritual sister
Gotchya
We just nailed a genetic match between the eagle feather left at the murder site and one in Jimmy's medicine bundle
It came from a white eagle
Same bird
Crow Horse fingers an eagle feather that hangs from his hat band
So did this one
Wambli is a rare and sacred creature
When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res
We share everything
lot of power in the eagle feathers
But you think that's bullshit too, don't -- (ala Crow Horse) -- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard
He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy
He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him
He started running for the open grass
With the car moving, Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed Leo's spine
Leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass
And some chicken feed
Stale chicken feed with four days mold
(a beat) Electromagnetic printing
Crow Horse stares, a little surprised
Was-te
'Cept for one thing
Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there
Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain
don't see the connection
The connection is, it did a head number on him
He's petrified of cars
Won't drive
've known him all my life, and he's never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle
He rides passenger and he rides horses, and that's it
The man that shot Leo down was behind the wheel of a moving car
Ray absorbs this with great interest
That's not solid
You want solid
That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the  missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first
Like a white man
Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first
The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu
Ray lets a pent-up sigh escape
You're saying a white guy did it
Crow Horse chews this over, unable to hide a nagging frustration
He shakes his head
When Leo was dumped out there in the Badlands, he was dropped on his back
Our man made an effort to turn him over, onto his face
It's an old Ind'n belief that if a dead man is turned face down, his spirit won't leave
And in the killer's case, it won't come back and jump all over his shit
That's an Ind'n thing a white man wouldn't know
The two of them stand there, thinking this over
Ray takes out his notebook and starts writing
Crow Horse walks away, turns to face the propped up targets
And that's the way it is
Write it down
To punctuate, Crow Horse slaps leather, draws his
38, and begins blasting at the milk bottles
He hits the bank tree
One of the posts
But not a single target
When he is done, he looks over his gun, disappointed
Starts reloading
Ray starts laughing, looking at the missed targets You laugh all you want, Breed
Sunset tonight,  get my man
Ray looks at Crow Horse, sees that he's serious, and follows him toward his motorcycle
Alright, Crow Horse
'm listening
'm listening to the trees, to the stones
Who is it
Crow Horse turns toward Ray, and creates a long dramatic pause
Damned if  know
And he hauls his bulk onto his motorbike
But the Old One
He did a Yuwipi ceremony last night
Crow Horse winks at Ray as he slams the kickstart
To no avail
The old man
He's gonna tell you who killed Leo
Go catch Jimmy, Ray
Really
He's gettin' away
Go ahead, go get him
'm late
Hey
Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing
Grandpa traded with me
(flips the bird) Goodbye
And Crow Horse nails his kick start
The   alive and the Indian works the throttle hard, leaving gravel and black exhaust
Ray stands there, drifting between logic and instinct
He looks at his watch, then starts at a slow, thoughtful shuffle toward his car
- The dust-buzzard broncs and bounces down Grandpa's driveway, coming to a stop near the wrecked cars
Crow Horse dismounts and unhooks a carton of smokes from the back
moment later, the junker van pulls in, bouncing and shaking
Crow Horse stares at the approaching vehicle, his eyes hidden behind Ray's former shades
He cracks a slow smile because -- Ray is stepping quickly from the van, and carrying two packs of Marlboros
Grandpa sits in his chair, his black eyes moving smoothly from side to side
Smoke enshrouds his ancient face, giving the sense of another time and place
He speaks
Crow Horse, sitting on a stool across from him, holds The Pipe
He passes it to Ray who sits in a busted lawn chair next to him
The room is dark as the sun sets out the window in red and purple
Ray looks at the pipe
Grandpa will not speak until Ray smokes
And so he does, drawing on the stem, awkwardly
as Grandpa speaks Indian
He says, back behind Red Deer Table, where the Elk-People-used-to-live
there are strange creatures from another world who eat stones
and who will kill anyone who crosses into this place
Ray looks at Crow Horse, searching for a hint of lightness
But there is only great reverence as he watches Ray blow smoke upward
He says, in the Yuwipi ceremony last night, he saw you
going back into the land beyond Red Deer Table was with you
But that was all the Spirits let him see so he doesn't know if you were killed or not
But he thinks you probably were
Ray smirks as he passes the pipe to Grandpa
Crow Horse looks nervous
Grandpa offers the pipe to the directions and then disengages the bowl from the stem
He speaks again
Crow Horse translates
Go to the land where the Elk-People- used-to-live and you will find the answers you came here looking for
But you must go as two
That is the vision
have spoken
And this is so
Grandpa leans closer to Crow Horse and whispers some Lakota
He wants to trade
(a beat) He likes your watch
Ray looks at Crow Horse, nervous
can't do that, (explaining) It's a Rolex
what
And Grandpa is already holding out something to offer
It is a cigarette
Grandpa offers it again
'm sorry, this is -- (loud to Grandpa) -- this is very, very expensive
It's -- (to Crow Horse) Tell him this is an expensive watch
Crow Horse tells the Old Man
Grandpa speaks Indian
He says, you need to go on Indian time
He says your watch is ruining your life anyway
Ray buries his hands in his jacket pocket
No way
Crow Horse signs to Grandpa "no
" Grandpa gets up, crosses between the two young men, up to the  set
He turns it on
explodes in    and a '
- Crow Horse and Ray walk down the steps
is heard from within
Red Deer Table, Ray
Don't tell me: heavy duty
Heavy, heavy duty
Taku Wakan
Wanagi Spirits
It's one of those few places we'd never go to as kids
Still don't
Some of the old people say Crazy Horse is buried back there
We have to go Ray
Together
Like his vision
They step into the yard and Ray stops, turning to Crow Horse Walter
When  fill out my 302, do say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation
Ray -- -- no
No offense to the old man appreciate you trying to help
But put my ass on the line coming out here, man
What'd you expect to hear
Not Native American myths and legends
'm with the , Walter, remember
Not National Geographic
What you call myths, we call our history
It's not real
What's real to you
Wall Street
Capital Hill
Now they are myths
can't be dicking around here
That's all 'm saying
don't carry crystals,  don't wanna come back in another life
just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here
You ain't no Indian
You're a Sal Mineo Indian
Crow Horse drives "Indian" home with a hard finger in Ray's chest
Ray knocks his hand away, explosively
Crow Horse is ready
(
) Knock it off
The old man is standing at the top of the steps
Ray and Crow Horse are    , and hands are up
Will ya knock it off
You're actin' like a couple of old women
Ray stands there, one hand up in defense, another poised to throw a punch
Bewildered, he stares at the old Indian holding onto the porch railing
For cryin' out loud
Knock it off
He speaks English
Only when he's really pissed off
Come inside
Watch
And Grandpa goes back in, screendoor slapping shut behind him
Ray is just staring, his jaw dropped
Crow Horse starts laughing
Harder than he has yet, and Ray starts walking toward his car in fuck-this steps
He gets into the car, closes the door and looks out the open window at Crow Horse
The Indian moves first
Don't accuse nothin' of not bein' real, Little Weasel
Cuz the only thing around here that ain't real is you
Ray lifts his arm off the door, and springs his middle finger up at Crow Horse
He holds it there for a long moment just looking at the big Indian
Take care of yourself, Walter
Likewise
Ray checks the time on his watch then guns away
Crow Horse stands there, watching him go
Eventually he shuffles back toward the trailer
- Room 14 has been transformed into a major  base; four computer terminals are set up, card tables spread with photos, boxes of files stacked on the bed, and  , manning the computers, thumbing through files
(' ) meeting takes place around a table of paperwork and coffee cups, and a
45 laid atop a file
Cooch,  Miles,  Sherman, and Ray
We've gotten word that Jimmy has been trying to hook up with Maggie Eagle Bear
but some of the Warriors have been sending word to Jimmy that she may be an  operative
So he doesn't know where to go
Cooch taps some ashes into an empty coffee cup
They sizzle in cold residue
Bingo
It's working
He's out of room
All the reservation exits have been watchdogged
We got him
give it twelve hours
Well we better use those twelve hours to apprehend the right man
The agents all look at Ray
pin can be heard falling to the cheap carpet
The right man
Talk to me, Ray
Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands
Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car
It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving
His parents were killed in a car wreck
Cooch nods, lights another smoke, intrigued
That's not very solid
There was also a print found in the Badlands that indicated diagetic locomotion
Heels first
Jimmy's walking pattern doesn't match
He has a distinct Indian walk
Indian walk
You been smoking hooch in the peace pipe, Ray
Except for Cooch who just stares at Ray, digesting what he has said
They don't smoke hooch in The Pipe, Miles
They smoke something called kinickinick, it's like a tobacco
Sherman looks at Cooch
Well, you're right about X21 being a Washington Redskin, that's for sure
What else, Ray
You boys want a soda
Oh, yeah, a Coke
You buying
No, Ray's buying
Sherman
Coke
Oh
no
No, Cooch, 'm working on a coffee here
Indian walk
Cooch nods to Ray and Ray follows, gathering up some paperwork He looks determined as a terrier
- Ray and Cooch throw long, slim shadows on their way to an archaic Coke machine
Genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings
An incontrovertible motive
And definite footprints on Jimmy Looks Twice at Maisy Blue Legs house
When did we get that
Today
And now you -- there's a dog in the van -- --  know
fed it, and  can't get rid of -- You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray
You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit
These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country
need you behind me, Ray
Not pulling against me
'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch
've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray
just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer
Ray
never get into bed with somebody unless  know for sure
Just the way  was raised
Ray studies him with a smile building
Cooch shrugs, sips some soda
Alright
Alright
(lightly) Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world
Go get a tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with her
Cuz Jimmy's gonna show
And want you to make the collar
Ray nods, starting for the van
Ray
He turns
Cooch looks at him for a time
It is a warm look
'll sleep around a little
Thanks, Cooch
And get rid of the dog
Ray gets in and pulls the dog out
The dog sits at roadside, tilting its head at him, confused
And he pulls out
It runs after him
' -  - The van sits parked down the road from Maggie's dimly-lit home
Ray sits behind the wheel, watching the house make a steady and unnerving sound
It is black
Black under big sky
Ray lets his head sag out the open window and he takes in the vastness
: stars
Millions of stars
And an incredible full moon
It hangs huge over distant fields, a perfect sphere
The top half of the moon is yellow, the bottom half a lava red
- stares at it, lost in thought
From Maggie's house, he hears someone
Singing a traditional   while they haul water from the creek
' , trilling out the beautiful but haunting "hey-o-hey-o-hey-o-hey-ohhhhh
" Ray just sits, listening
And then something draws his attention to his rearview mirror
The res dog, lying in the back seat is
Lip curled back, growling low
Ray looks at him, looks out the window
Blackness
Nothing but the sound of locusts
And a slight crosswind in the wheat fields
The dog stops growling
And Ray fixes his gaze on the house again, lifting a pair of binoculars and -- The rear windshield is  by an explosion
Ray throws himself low across the passenger seat --
The driver's side window and part of the door explodes
' The federal van is
All the windows, shattered, the metal doors splayed
Someone is going for the kill, is thrown open just as its window implodes, and Ray slides out belly first, gripping his -16 and crawling like a dog soldier into tall wheat at roadside as the car, the road, the wheat, the dirt, the night are slammed by gunfire
The res dog overtakes Ray and vanishes in the wheat
Ray vanishes, too
It is quiet for a moment, then Ray, pops up ten feet away, and   -16, in a left to right, clean sweep before dropping again
He lies there, listening
The
His breath is heavy
His heart's got to be pounding through the dirt he lays in
(whispering) Motherfucker
- the decimated van, aerial still high
The distant lights of Maggie's house
And the giant Moon, hovering over it all
into -- - comb the dirt road, the wheat fields, picking up shells with gloved hands, scanning the vast distance
of Maggie's,    stand with the Old Woman, watching
Cooch, flushed in the face, mans the wheel
He wears only a -shirt which indicates, a desperate rush to the scene
His eyes scan the surrounding homes and fields
In the passenger seat, Ray sits, drinking a coffee
He looks haggard
Bastards
All  could think of was
not here
don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home
He's out there
He's out there playing Sitting Bull with us
want the motherfucker so bad 'm getting a bleeding ulcer
Ray turns around in his seat, looking off across dry land
It may have been Maggie's way of saying "get off my ass
" She's that subtle
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says
Well, she's running now, too
These fucking people like to run, don't -- -- Cooch
Woh
Stop
He does
Ray is turned around in his seat, staring off into the distance
The Le Baron whines backward, and off the road, into some grass Ray steps out, keeping his gaze fixed
Cooch bails from the driver's side, joins him
' : Four-hundred feet across a flat area of sandstone and grass clusters, something shimmers in the undulations of the harsh morning sun
Something of pea green and rusty metal
glass catches sunlight and makes prisms
car
An old res car, sitting in a long, chasm in barely a foot of green water
-    - Ray and Cooch go through the car, around the car, with gloved hands and grease pencils and plastic bags, sweating in the hot sun
Tread matches
It's the car
Yes
Excited, Ray walks off, scanning the area
But this doesn't make any sense, Ray
If it's just been sitting in this dry wash for seven days
why the hell didn't we find it
Ray picks up a handful of stones, sifts them in his hands
Because this isn't a dry wash
Cooch watches him slosh shoes first through a rut where the water shimmers a foot deep or less
It's the Little Walking River
Ray turns, shucking up mud
And it was full of water when  drove by here three days ago
Full mean
a river
The Little Walking River
You're right
This is part of it
So whoever sunk this car didn't compensate for drought
Goddamn
Ray doesn't hear Cooch
He stares past the  at the long wide chasm, wet in some places, arid in others, and what he hears must be an echo in his head
Listen to the water
Cooch is listening to a  across his radio and he walks off a few feet, exchanging information with the Ray stands, ankle deep in stagnant water, his face sweat- soaked, his eyes transfixed on heat undulations
-  13 - flat-bed tow truck drives past the motel with the killer's car on it
Behind the truck is a fed car which stops at the motel, and the Le Baron which also pulls in
Miles and Sherman get out from the first car, Ray and Cooch bail from the Le Baron
With  , the agents walk, dusty and tired, into room 14
Ray hesitates, snagged by the sight of -- motorcycle parked in front of the Buffalo Butte Bar
Parked with pick-up trucks and station wagons
It's the mud-caked old Barley
Parked right under the   sign
He puzzles over this
- Dark
Even during the day
Cigarette smoke
Sawdust
On the archaic juke box,   sings "Old 8x10" while behind the bar, the  , an old man with long white hair and beard, busies himself with leather work sit on the old water drum bar stools
Heads lift, turn when Ray enters in his "fraternizing" clothes -- jeans and boots, leather jacket
He scuffs up thick sawdust as he heads to the furthest booth back where -- Crow Horse sits, alone over a bourbon and a beer
Ray approaches carefully, upset by the sight
He slides into the booth and point blanks the Indian
Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination
Jesus Christ
You're hammered
What are you doing
You're right about the old man
His power's long dried up
He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people
He says we changed, and we don't listen
Well, he don't go out and talk no more
haven't had a drink in three years but just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered
Cut the shit
You shouldn't be in here, Man
Cuz 'm a skin
Cuz you're a cop
Not no more
What are you talking about
You tell me
You tell me who went to the
-- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said  was messin' with your case, man
don't give a goddamn about your case
And  don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but  didn't cut you
Crow Horse shimmers his black eyes onto Ray
Still after Jimmy
They found prints at Blue Legs' place
Yeah
Jimmy's prints are there
But they cross over Benjamin Black Star's prints
And he wasn't there until six o'clock the mornin' after to get eggs from the chickens
So Jimmy wasn't there til the next day
Follow
Ray just looks vacantly at Crow Horse
Crow Horse resents the vacancy
Look, man
you better bust Jimmy and get out before somebody shoots up more than your car next time
Ray glares at him
Next time 'll be ready
You get the word to who ever it is
can't, Hoss
don't talk to 's
Ray doesn't blink
You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop
No
was sent here cuz 'm Indian
And a good cop
Crow Horse leans toward Ray and speaks more quietly
You ever think that maybe you was sent here cuz the 's need one good reason to take out the entire Warrior Movement
And what better reason than one of their men, gettin' blown away on the res
low-rent, expendable public servant sent in to take a bullet for his country
Ray is fuming
He can't believe what he's hearing, what's being insinuated, but he's giving it thought and it's getting him angry
He smashes a hand down on the table
'm sick of your shit -- (
) 'm sick of the two of ya timber niggers spewin' off
Standing over the booth is a long, tall '
Rangey with red curly hair tucked under a    cap, and arms built by tractor work
And behind him, fall in
And   , grinning with amusement
Ray and Crow Horse look up
Sorry, we don't speak United States
' Yeah, well  do
Get the Jesus up, and get the Jesus out or 'm gonna go out to my truck and come back with my hardware
Woh, hold on there, Jack, you're -- ' -- don't "jack" me, Squanto
'll bury your lazy ass right here
Ray realizes now that they think he's Indian, too
Crow Horse sees this revelation and complicates it by suddenly speaking to Ray
The rancher grabs Ray by the cheeks
' 'm talkin' to -- Ray decks him
Backhands him in the solar plexus then, lays a burner of a Quantico roundhouse to his ear, knocking him across the bar, over a mop and bucket and into sawdust
The others start to fall at him but someone has jumped in, holding them back, and sticking himself in the way
It is Brooks
The old timer Ray met his first night here
No
No, you butt holes
He ain't skin
He '
Yeah he's In'dn
Miniconjou Sioux
The rancher's son who is coming back with a broken beer bottle, slows his step and shifts his eyes from Brooks to the young fed There is a lot of heavy breathing
But no talking just yet
The young rancher eyes Ray
' You ain't Indian
Ray just stands tense, staring at him
And it's strange
Because he hasn't really looked like he has any Indian blood up to this moment
But dressed the way he is, and his eyes glaring, face drawing tense, he might pass for a breed although that's probably the Italian
But Ray doesn't answer the question
Crow Horse starts laughing
Drunkenly
What's so damn funny
Well, it's just that the cavalry used to always threaten the Lakota
The cavalry ain't around anymore
The Lakota still are
' got no trouble tellin' where you come from, Fat Red
Crow Horse rises and walks unsteadily across the floor, leaving the bar
Brooks is whispering to the others, apparently about who Ray is
The bar man comes up to Ray, holding a tray, on which sits a shot and a beer
Ray looks at it for a moment
Sorry
On the house
Ray knocks the tray out of his hand, spilling beer and whiskey all over the bar man and the locals around him
And he walks out, leaving the locals confused
-  -  - Ray looks strung-out as he drives
If it's not the conflict at the Butte, it's the dangerous seed Crow Horse planted, and it is playing with his mind
He is on his
No plates
No registration
Serial numbers removed
And all prints washed off by the river
That's great
This is turning out to be a walk in the park, do you know that
(woman agent) Come back
Never mind
But before he hangs the radio
Ray
X22
read, Cooch
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house
Somebody took it down
Good
They took it down, set fire to it, and threw it on the doorstep of room 13 at the Buffalo Butte Motel
Your room
Ray seethes quietly as he drives
We traced the number of the truck that dumped it, and it belongs to one Maggie Sanders, also known as Maggie Eagle Bear
She's been all over the res, riling up the traditionals, telling them not to break, and to keep Jimmy in hiding
She's a problem now
And she's yours
Get her off the reservation
Ray keeps driving
- Maggie's old pick-up is parked near an arch gate of the tiny cemetery where a tall monument is fenced off from other graves There are tobacco offerings and other medicines hanging on the fence and on the monument
It is a quiet place
Still
Maggie stands before the unkempt monument in her denim jacket, her hair blowing across her face in the wind
She Behind her   from the Bear Creek School stand, heads bowed respectfully
Two of them sit on the lap of Richard Yellow Bird who looks on from his wheelchair, praying quietly with Maggie
When Maggie completes her prayer, she ties some tobacco to the monument then turns and faces the children
One of them, a   -- heavy-set -- raises a hand that we might note is deformed
As many of the children we have seen on the res, are
Are they all right under here
Two-hundred and sixty-seven men, women, old people
And little ones like you
Many killed running along that road you see there
Where were they runnin' to
place called The Stronghold
(a beat) They died for a dream
But you live
You are their great-great grandchildren and you live
We have to honor their dream
Of protecting the Mother Earth
And being proud of being Indian
My mother told me that they call us Indians cuz Columbus was lookin' for India when he discovered our country
Maggie smiles at the boy
Yeah, well, let me tell you something, Henry: just be glad he wasn't looking for Turkey
The
All but one boy, who isn't paying attention
He is staring up at a hill, off in the distance
' : on the hill, a figure stands, hands in his pockets, hair blowing in the wind
Ray
- keeping her eyes on the Wasi'cu, but addressing Yellow Bird
Richard
Sing the Honoring Song with them
'll be right back
Ray stands, watching Maggie walking into the wind, toward him
Behind her an  , sung by ten children haunts the still air
He doesn't budge as she mounts the gentle bluff and joins him there
We're praying at the grave
Do you wanna join us
long silence
The voices carry in the wind
No, Maggie
But you're gonna have to join me for a ride
'm taking you to Rapid City
Maggie looks at him
They lock eyes
So much power
see it in your eyes
This
hunger for power
Or for what you think is power
As if exhausted by the thought, Maggie sits down on the bluff, looking out at the children who are still singing the song
As she speaks, she begins digging her fingers in the earth
Ray stands over her
You burned an American flag today
And left it for me
-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned
desecrated it
You forced an innocent man to run like an animal
You've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters never wrote
you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family
wash myself in the river
And now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place
(a beat) In your eyes, that's power
Maggie lifts herself onto her knees and looks down into the small hole she's dug
She picks up a little pine cone
So  plant this tree for you
And take all this stuff that you've laid on me and my people, and  put it in this hole with this pine cone
(she covers it) And  bury it
Cuz ya know what it is, Ray
Bullshit
And shit is fertilizer
(she stands) And The Mother will turn your lies into something that lives
Maggie rises, dusting off her hands
She looks him in the soul
That's what power is, in the Indian way
(holds her hands out to be cuffed) Take me to Rapid, Ray
'm the enemy
Ray just stares at her, struggling with what he's feeling, what he's hearing
What he's supposed to be feeling
Silence hangs between the two of them
If  told you
that  think Jimmy's innocent
but 'm in over my head
would you believe me
Maggie looks at him, considering
Then toward the long dark silhouette of a mountain range across the plains
See those Black Hills out there, Ray
When the people lost the land in 1868, the government took everything but those hills
They allowed us to keep those Black Hills, to live there
Signed a treaty
Until they found gold
Then they told us we had to leave because of National interest
They broke that treaty
Anyone who fought or spoke out against it, wound up dead or in jail
And the people wound up here
On a reservation
While she looks off at Paha Sapa, Ray stares at her profile
While up there, in the Black Hills
they carved the faces of four presidents
She looks at Ray with an ironic smile, and she catches him transfixed
Your relatives must've taught you something
(after thought) My father never told anybody he had Indian blood
But he still used a few Indian words around the house
He called me Washee
Said it meant
good boy
Maggie starts giggling
What
Wa-shee is like
a dumpling
Like tallow we put in stew
think he was calling you chubby boy
Great
Maggie is laughing as she looks back at the children who are no longer singing
Ray reaches inside his jacket and takes out five polaroids
He shuffles them as he ponders
He hands one to Maggie who has caught herself opening up too much to the Wasi'cu
You ever see that car before
Maggie looks at the first photo and says nothing
She hands it back quickly
Ray won't take it
Who's it belong to
Maggie ignores him
Ray studies her reaction
Help me, Maggie
Maggie is looking away
She picks a long blade of grass and smoothes it in her hands
Ray looks at her a moment longer then rises, dusting off his jeans, and standing there
He thinks for a long moment, pinches the bridge of his nose, then looks out at the Black Hills, pensive
didn't see you today, Maggie
(a beat) Goodbye
Maggie watches him go
Looks away
Then watches him again
Goodbye
Wa-shee
Ray stops
She stands on the bluff, her hair riding the wind and her eyes searing
And then her lips do something that might qualify as half a smile
sense of humor rising up through anger
Survival humor
Ray looks at her for a long moment
And then he walks on, leaving her there
-     - Ray sits behind the wheel, going through files on his lap, photographs of Indians
And thinking hard
Anyone who fought or spoke out against it
wound up dead or in jail
Ray looks out the window toward the monument
(to himself, flustered) That was 1868, Maggie
Exhausted, Ray lays his head back on the seat, and lets a long, constricted breath free
like the slow, deep roar of some giant bear up in the hills
He opens his eyes, looks out the window
: rain is coming down, and Maggie is getting the children into the back of her truck
She helps them get a tarp over their heads
Then as Yellow Bird pulls himself into the cab of the truck, she hefts the wheelchair and two boys load it in
She gets in, starts up, and rolls off down the sloping road
- Ray steps out of the car into the rain and closes the door
He stares at the burial grounds
Then slowly, he starts toward them as if magnetically drawn
shroud of mist lays over the cemetery, growing thicker as the rain falls harder
Ray is walking toward the memorial, getting drenched
Then he hears something strange
' : coming down the dirt road, toward him, a  drives his mount at a fast trot
The rider is only a vague image in the mist, his face hidden
As he rides closer, we can make out a shotgun in his hand
And he throws it up, takes aim
- paralyzed for a moment
And then going for his gun
But it's not there
He's left it in the car
He breaks into a run
But there's a shorter distance now between the horseman and the car and Ray has no choice but to turn and flee
His boots slap wet pavement, and his breath draws heavy and desperate as he bounds off the road and races down a grassy slope, looking over his shoulder, panicking
His legs and arms churning, his face contorted
And then someone passes him out, running just as hard in 1890 Winter rags, clutching a  to her breast and Ray looks at her, incredulous as he runs
But he keeps running
The rider is right behind him
He
The the sky like thunder
Ray jumps awake
Cooch is  on the window
And the three-legged dog inside is
Ray quickly rolls the window down, letting in
Cooch starts to say something then takes note of Ray's peaked face
Sweat runs down his temples, beads at his nose
Jesus, you alright
Yeah
fell asleep
can't believe it
-- Never turn your radio off
thought was gonna find you scalped
Damn it
Sorry, Cooch
lost Eagle Bear -- -- never mind Eagle Bear
We've got Jimmy nailed
Let's go
And Cooch runs to his car
Ray fires the car's big engine and takes off behind Cooch who is driving a fed Chevy -- - The rain pelts Grandpa's little Airstream trailer, wind snaps at sheet plastic in the windows
An ancient sewing wheel in the wind
Three clean, late-model fed cars pull down the muddy drive as two  vehicles pull in from another road
The Le Baron pulls in, and Ray bails out with the others
When he sees where he is, he looks distraught
Agents are running behind junked cars, positioning themselves around the trailer
The holy man is sitting in his chair, smacking Flies with a swatter
Tonight he wears a black reservation hat and stares vacantly at the  where   swings a giant baseball bat, and falls on his face, bouncing back up
And then
The door is open and Cooch leads Miles, Sherman and Ray inside
Cooch has a gun on the old man
The old man slowly removes his hat and hangs it on a knee
Carefully he places his wrinkled hands on his thinning white hair
His eyes seek out Ray who stands in the doorway, -16 in hand, looking concerned
He stares at Ray
Cooch storms into a back bedroom, Miles moves to a window
Sherman stands over the old man
Where is he, Sam
Where's Jimmy
Grandpa looks at Sherman, ignores him, looks back at Ray
He's a medicine man, Ray
The "spiritual leader" of the Warriors
That right, Sam
With   crackling through the house, Cooch comes back down the hall, and heads to the door
Trailer's clean, let's go
Ray starts to follow but he sees Sherman pick something up from near Grandpa
The 500 year-old turtleshell rattle
Grandpa's eyes widen slightly
You been the one making it rain like that, out there, Sam
Hey, put that down
Can you make Jimmy outrun an -16, Sam
Sherman
Sherman drops the turtleshell rattle on the linoleum floor
Then drives his heel into it,  the fragile turtleshell
Ray grabs him and slams him into the tin wall
Miles gets between them, grabbing Sherman
,
-- '
' ,  ,
They're out the door, leaving the old man to sit looking down at the shattered rattle
He closes his eyes
In a blizzard of rain, Jimmy Looks Twice in a cowboy shirt, jeans and boots, leaps off the top of the Airstream, clutching his medicine bundle
him from all directions
screaming at him
He tries to turn a corner and runs right into a fed
Ray, having run out the back door has slammed right into him
He has his rifle on him, and they stare each other down for a split second before he is converged on
Guns at his back, at his head
He is swept off his feet, face down, and frisked
He looks up at Ray, desperately
Brother, the old man told me about you
Listen to me: what was Leo trying to tell me
He wanted to meet me at Maisy -- Another fed, pushes his face into the mud, cuffs him behind his back
Save your speeches for prison, Jimmy
With two     swarming the area, and six agents pushing Jimmy toward a car, Cooch stands there in the pouring rain, looking relieved
Ray stands near him, looking abhorred
Damn
That's one hard running Indian
Ray watches Jimmy as he is shoved into the back of Miles and Sherman's car and driven away
He is twisting around in his seat to look at Ray
Desperately
The  teams disband, return to their vehicles
It's over, Ray
aged five years
But it's over
At least 'm gonna look like 'm ready for the advisory desk
Let's go get a beer
Cooch heads to his car and Ray starts shuffling toward his as if he is dared by it all
He is looking at the trailer and there on the rickety porch is Grandpa
He comes down the steps slowly, holding his hat on against the wind
He watches the cars pulling out
Ray walks over to him, looking sick
Look
'm not who you think  am
(a long beat) 'm sorry
And after a moment of locking gazes, he starts for his car, Out back that way
is a placed called Wounded Knee
Ray turns
was one years old there when our people were shot down
My mother hid me in the snow in a blanket
One of those killed was a Holy Man called Wakiyan Cante -- Thunder Heart
They killed him while he was running for The Stronghold
It is his blood -- the same blood that spilled on the grass and snow at Wounded Knee -- that runs through your heart like a buffalo
Ray frowns, disturbed by this story
The old man is speaking with conviction
With power
Thunder Heart has come
Sent here to a troubled place to help his people
That's what  am told
Maybe you're right and  am mistaken
Your mind is young, mine is old
If so, so be it
Ho Hecetu Yelo
'll speak no more
Ray stands, almost paralyzed, digesting this
He turns and looks into the old man's sharp eyes
Grandpa has closed his eyes, and as he is pulverized by the rain, he turns his face toward it and from way down in his belly, he begins to And it is too much
Too weird
He wheels and hurries to the car
Gets in, and beats a fast path out of the old man's lonesome patch of land
knifes the sky
, and rumbles into   -- - The agents have taken over both sides of the streets, gathered in front of the bar and the motel, putting firearms into cases, removing flak jackets
knock from inside the bar while outside, takes a piss near a truck while his  stands at his back, yelling at him
sings country on the juke Ray heads to room 13, starts unlocking the door
Cooch comes up behind him
Buffalo burgers and cold beer, Raymond
Don't worry about the sign out front
you don't have to be Indian anymore
Cooch throws a mock punch at Ray and he mock blocks, tired
He musters a smile
But he isn't all there
You have a fever
You okay
Ray nods
Cooch lets a few agents walk past,
He speaks quietly
Listen: when we get back tomorrow, you're gonna find Tully laying a promotion on you
He wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good
He's offering you New York
Tell him you want Atlanta
Why
Cuz  want New York
Ray tries to break a smile again
Cooch cups his arm
Cooch
They sent us out here because the place was being neglected
Now, all of a sudden, there's two five man  teams out there tonight
Bell Huey choppers flying all over the place
Federal occupation to catch one guy
Why, Cooch
What's going on
Cooch stares at Ray
The younger agent looks like he indeed has a fever
National security, Ray
Get some sleep
Tomorrow, we fly
Cooch hurries across the rain-swept street
Ray steps inside and closes the door
13 - Ray closes the door, and stands there
He seems to be having trouble breathing
He looks down at his boots
There is something on the floor
Something that has been slipped under the door earlier
He just stares down at it
Then slowly stoops
: the polaroid of the res car he gave to Maggie earlier
She has returned it
He turns it over
Written across the white backing of the photo, in dark black marker is the name -- Ray stares at this for a moment then hurries over to boxes of files on the bed
He rummages like a nervous thief and comes up with a folder
He flips through it, casting off files and 302's and profiles and finally stopping on -- The 8x10    of Richard Yellow Bird seen earlier
Sitting in his wheelchair, Red Power cap on, tattoos marring big arms
And under it a    stamped Under that     stamped And under that a -- stamped "
" Ray, his eyes fixed on this one, takes a few steps and sits on the end of the bed
He then stuffs the file back in a box, and takes off toward the door
- The Le Baron throws up loose rock and red dust, driving toward a place where the sun begins a slow drop behind the Black Hills
run out of the road
- tarpaper shack
Outhouse
Clothesline on which jerked meat hangs
No cars
lonely, unnerving place
Le Baron pulls in
Ray gets out, adjusting the gun at the back of his waistband
He starts for the shack
Ray raps a fist on the splintered plywood door
Knocks again
He checks out a boarded- up window
The door finally opens
Just a crack
Tiny black eyes peer out into the fading light
'm looking for Richard Yellow Bird
Ray sticks his open badge, gold eagle wings, near the crack
The door closes
Then unlatches and opens
Yellow Bird sits there in his wheelchair, tiny tobacco bundles in his lap
He's been tying them
The Washington Redskin
Thought you'd be gone by now
He pivots his chair to allow Ray room to enter
Yellow Bird, in a -shirt that reveals twenty different ink tattoos, rolls himself across the warped floorboards to a cheese crate where his eye glasses sit
He puts the thick bifocals on and focuses resentfully on Ray in the ochre flicker of the dirty room
What ya want
Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair
How long you been in it
Since  got a iron pipe put across my knees, man
Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know
At Sioux Falls Pen
No, that was Leavenworth
This -- (shows a scar) was Sioux Falls
What ya want
Leavenworth a tough joint
Ray walks across the room, his eyes on a covert mission
You ever try solitary confinement
No
Can't say that  have, Richard
Richard do you know why 'm here
Washington sent ya
know that
Yes, Washington sent me, Richard
They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked
Do you know what  mean when  say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard
Yellow Bird stares at Ray
An arrangement was made between you
and us
Do you remember that arrangement
Yellow Bird looks at Ray, strangely, shaking his head
Ray starts to look like maybe the game's not working
Like maybe this doesn't add up
But -- 'm here, ain't
Ray lets a tense breath out
Not for long, Richard
You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver
What the fuck you talkin' about
Ray sits in a busted chair, reaches down to his ankle holster and pulls out a
38
He holds it, resting it on the arm of the chair
He strains to look out through the boarded window
Yellow Bird fidgets in his chair
Get up out of the chair, Richard
What's with you people
Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time
came through, man
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard
(not moving) get thrown in solitary until don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me  can beat nine years if  help you
helped you
Get up
Yellow Bird stands
He takes a step forward
Limping
He's got leg problems but he can walk
Heels first
And bowed
But he can walk
He is shaking
They said 'd never see  again, and 'm livin' with you fuckers don't feed ya information on the Warriors, it's back to the pen don't do this, back to the pen
Your word against my word
Against a con Indian's word
really got a chance, man, right
They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and  have to transport you back to Leavenworth
(crying) What the fuck, man
What do you people want
did what you wasi'cu's told me to do
Leo Fast Elk
is alive
Yellow Bird wheels
No way
No fuckin' way
How the hell do you know
blew his back out with a buffalo gun, that's how  know
Now you're gonna say  didn't, so you can throw me back in solitary
Ray is trying hard not to reveal his horror at this confession, at this understanding of the machinery
He sits there with his gun, blinking away sweat that beads at his brow
Yellow Bird is weeping in a highpitched voice that doesn't match his great bulk
The men who came to see you at Leavenworth
The one's who made the arrangement
who were they
Maybe can talk to them
Miles
Three other suits
That's all know 'em as -- suits
Were you there
You turned Leo over on his face
But the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out
It's out, and it knows
What do you know about spirits
You ain't no In'dn
Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy
But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered
Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy
Do you
took him out before he got the chance
He didn't say nothin' about Tashka Sha
And now his spirit is in the dirt
Forever
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English
Red Deer Table
What's with you, man
Ray grabs onto these words, rolls them silently on his lips And now Yellow Bird is getting suspicious of the fed
Wait a minute
Wait -- what are you doin'
You ain't a
You ain't the law
Let me see your -- Ray snaps out his gun, straight-armed
'm the fucking law
Yellow Bird jumps back, raising his hands
Keep talking, Yellow Bird
All  know
is  did what  did
and  ain't in solitary, gettin' pumped up with downer, gettin' beat to shit
But  tell you what, Suit
Take me back
Cuz  can't take this shit no more
And then  pierce the gaps in the boarded windows
Yellow Bird collapses against the wall, bangs his head off it
He lets a long, pained, cry escape from under his breath and he begins a slow slide down the wall, to the floor
Ray peers out the cracks in the boards
Man,  don't know who the fuck  am no more
Ray gets up, putting his gun away and heading to the door
He stops and looks back at the Indian, sitting on the floor, clutching his knees, staring into the kerosene flicker
You and me both
Yellow Bird looks at him, his glasses foggy, his face contorted And Ray leaves
'  - Ray steps out into the falling night
There is a car parked there
With a high aerial
Ray raises a hand in a slight wave, walks on
At the fed car,    behind the wheel, waves a hand
Watches Ray get into the Le Baron
Ray gets in the car and takes off
- Ray drives like a crazy man through the dark reservation
Through miles of open land and strange rock formations
And he looks trapped
flicker in his rearview
He sees this
Slams the gas pedal
- The Le Baron races at 85 down the dirt stretch
moment later a car rattles by at 90
- Ray reaches over to the passenger seat and pulls up the - 16
He lays it across his lap
Looks in the rearview again
Then makes a sudden sharp turn
He pulls off the road quickly, throwing up dust into the already foggy night, the car goes out of control
- The car that was following drives right past the narrow layby, hidden by grassy slopes and keeps flying down the long stretch
Ray skids through the dirt, trying to stop -- he can't -- and the Le Baron fishtails, smashing into a chain-link fence
And coming to a stop
Breathing as if he's been running not driving, Ray looks behind him to make sure he lost the car
He did
When he turns back to his wheel, he sees -- lit by his headlights:    gravesite
He is right up on the arch, and the tall stone marker beyond it
- The Le Baron just sits parked, headlights making the night fog crawl up from the base of the old tomb, along the fence
The driver's door opens slowly
And Ray steps out
He walks through the arch
Into the small fenced area
Up to the stone which is overgrown with stubborn weeds, half-hidden in mist
Ray studies the tomb
:        : Weeds are grown up over the rest of the names
Ray's hands clear them, grab at them and rip them away from more names: With frantic abandon, Ray is ripping weeds away
He drops to his knees, clearing weeds
and then suddenly back up to the name: - kneeling in the weeds, the wind getting restless around him, screaming the way plains winds do but only these winds are filled with a whistling
What sounds like   , piping shrill
Ray kneels before the marker, staring at the name on the stone, his hair thrown around by the wind that drives across the grass, whistling eagles, building to an unbearable, pitch
Ray stares at the name as if he is looking through a small hole into another world
world that frightens him
He gets up and backs away from the stone, through the gate
And gets back in his car, quickly
He takes off
'  - The little home on the river
Dark
Empty
Ray runs up the steps, pounds at the door
No answer
Pounds again
Maggie
He keeps knocking
Nothing
He hurries back down the steps, starts around the back of the house and something attacks him, leaps at him from the dark, knocking him off his feet, into the grass
Hits him again
But as quickly as he falls, he rolls, throwing up his hands and blocking a savage kick aimed for his face
He traps the boot, twists it and drops the attacker onto his back
In a matter of seconds, he is on top of the man, sticking his gun in his throat
He grabs a flashlight from his jacket and shines it in the man's face
Crow Horse
Breathing like a wild animal
Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle
Crow Horse, listen -- Where's Maggie
Where'd ya take her
Nowhere
'm trying to find her
You got Jimmy
Let her go
Crow Horse, listen
You have to come with me
Why
So you can get rid of me, too
No
So we can do what the old man said
Red Deer Table, Walter
We have to go
Crow Horse lies there, breathing heavy
Ray on top of him, still clutching his gun
-  - Ray and Crow Horse are quiet as they eat up the dirt roads
Maybe the old man's visions are still strong
Ray nods, concentrating
After a time: Do they come in dreams, these visions
Oh yeah
Dreams
Sometimes durin' sickness
Vision quest
Sweat Lodge
Ya never know when
Just before we caught Jimmy
had a dream that  was being chased
And was running with other people
Old- fashion Indian people
got shot in the back
Like Leo
When Crow Horse doesn't respond, Ray looks over and finds him staring
He looks back to the road
And when he looks back at Crow Horse, he is still staring at him
Where was this
At Wounded Knee
mean, that's where was, and that's where the dream was
Why
You were running with the old ones
At The Knee
Heavy duty
Well, it was just a dream,  -- Sonuvabuck
What's with you, Man
Who are you
What do you mean
Nothin'
Forget it
Crow Horse looks out the window as if to avoid Ray who is confused by the Indian's smoldering
After a moment, Crow Horse looks at him
You had a vision
You had yourself a vision
man waits a long time for a vision
Might go his whole lifetime and never get one
And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision
Sorry
'm a full-blood Oglala
We've driven a long way
Where is this place
Maybe it was just a dream
Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams
Yeah
Fitful dreams
Crow Horse feels better
He looks out the window, nodding
But it doesn't last long
Bullshit
You had a vision
You got sign from the old ones
What the hell do you want me to do
Stop
Ray brakes
Crow Horse is looking past him
Ray turns
The spectacular mesa that we have admired with every sunrise, looms massive now that we are under it
Moonlight falls on it
And the   pulses from it
------ - The land behind Red Deer Table is Badlands
Badlands pierced by a few rutted old wagon roads
At a place between two grotesque buttes, Crow Horse stops, looking uneasy
He digs into his pocket, pulls out some loose tobacco and spills it on the ground
Then he walks on
Ray observes this, starting forward, then stopping long enough to fish a cigarette out from his pocket and drop it next to Crow Horse's offering
Ray and Crow Horse walk, carefully under a full moon, scanning the area
Crow Horse stops, checks out some tracks
Ray walks on, looking up at the table
He shines his flashlight up and it illuminates -- , tied on stakes on a ridge
Ten stakes
Twenty stakes
Ribbons blowing in the wind
What's that
Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure
Ray sweeps the light along, walking faster, and then something frightening occurs
Something
some unseen thing snags him by the leg, sucking him into the Earth with a horrible Ray is drawn into a hole up to his hips, a bluish-black slime, oozing out around him
Crow Horse grabs him, struggling to pull him up
He does, stumbling back and stepping into a hole himself
The two men are wheeling, throwing flashlight beams around, slapping through a wet jelly, and finally getting their bearings
Ray touches the ground where a blue-black chemical solution oozes out with water from the aquifer below
His flashlight scans -- uranium strip-mining grid laid out in a 50 x 60 pattern
The far side is fenced by flagged stakes
Jesus
Oil
Uranium
Test holes
Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'
They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry
1868
What
That's what we're doing here
National interest
National security
Only this time it's not gold
It's uranium
We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray
This ain't supposed to be here
It'll poison the water
Leo knew about it
Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved
So they took care of Leo
Listen to the water
the river keeps goin' down then rising again
Ray goes to another hole and sticks his arm in up to the elbow, sniffs the solution
They're drainin' our water table
That's our life, man
Ray is looking past Crow Horse at -- Something strange in the moonlight
Some forty yards away, on a flat stretch of stoney ground
Six Coyotes, dancing in the shadows of rock formations
as Ray walks forward, they circle
scatter
run back
circle again
Look straight at Ray, eyes glowing
And run
- and Crow Horse walk toward them
To the place they just left
place in the dirt, they were digging up
When they reach it, they stare down into the dirt
lies there, face down
Denim jacket and a shock of black hair, thrown into tangles and dirt
It was buried
Until the coyote caught wind
Crow Horse bends down, touches the jacket
turns the body over And almost vomits when he sees Maggie Eagle Bear
looks down in disbelief
No
No
Ray steps back, his boots squishing in solution and sealant and soiled water
He covers his mouth, stopping himself from getting sick
And then he explodes,
- in the moonlight
And '   up out of the rocks - The sordid little village the feds first drove through sits sleepy on the rim of sunrise
hollow as the Crow Horse motorcycle chutters down and coasts up in front of one of the little homes -- rundown but it has a satellite dish and a decent car like so many
The Le Baron pulls up behind it
- Crow Horse walks over to Ray's window, his jeans and boots muddy
No one speaks for a long moment, the night filled by crickets
And that one dog
This Clear Moon's house
Yeah
It's time to beat the drum
You better wait here
He don't trust the white man
Crow Horse crosses the street
Ray sits there, and he looks almost hurt by this statement
But he is the white man
But he is Indian
He lets a long breath escape, rubs at a temple
He takes out a smoke
Tries to light it
His hands are shaking too badly
But he gets it lit, and sits tense, looking in his rearview
- Oliver Clear Moon sits in a chair, his strong Indian mouth, beginning to tighten at the jowls
Across from him, Crow Horse sits on the edge of a couch
, a rotund, gentle woman brings him a coffee
in a men's extra-large -shirt stands in the hall, looking at him
Clear Moon in pajamas, rises, and with a coffee in hand, starts walking in slow steps toward the kitchen
He loses control before he gets there and hurls the cup across the room into the sink, smashing it
He wheels and faces Crow Horse
He
Asking questions
Crow Horse Answering him
Mrs
Clear Moon, understanding, shakes her head in disbelief and her eyes begin to well
Oliver, walking back to his chair, sits, and thinks for a moment
He gets up, goes to a drawer and rummages
He sits again, and tosses something onto the coffee table
It is a badge
tribal police badge
-  -  ' - Ray nervously awaits Crow Horse's words as he appears at the window again
The Indian shows hope in his tired eyes
Alright
Shit's comin' down
He's callin' council fire
All the old chiefs and the warriors, too
gotta be at Grandpa's place in two hours
We need to get the tribe together
We need to block this thing
What we need
is Richard Yellow Bird
Crow Horse looks at Ray who stares dead ahead
'  -  - The shack is just as Ray left it earlier, kerosene flickers dancing yellow through the gapped boards
Ray and Crow Horse with guns drawn, approach the front door
thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts
We did an honorin' song for him and everything
He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth
He's not gonna come out without a fight
Crow Horse snakes around toward the rear of the shack
Ray knocks at the front door
It is unlatched and it creaks open a little
Ray pushes it open and sees -- An empty wheelchair
Ray steps away from the door, looking around the vast plains as the sun comes up out of the Black Hills
He is roadblocked, and it shows in his eyes
It's all getting too big
Crow Horse leans against the shack, watching Ray
And then from inside the Le Baron
Ray pivots and stares at it as if someone is inside the car
His call signal is being paged
But he just stands there, looking at it
X21
Read
X21
Ray reaches inside the car and lifts the handset
He takes a breath before pressing it to his lips
X21
Come back
Ray
What's your 20
Ray looks at Crow Horse who looks equally spooked
The agent clears his throat
Reservation
long, unnerving pause
No response from the other side
What are you doing on the reservation
'm on my way back in
Over
Ray holds the handset down at his side, looking over the top of the car toward the Black Hills
Ray
Ray, don't let go now, Man
Ray
You go to the council fire
'm going back in
Ray
Ray swings in behind the wheel, starts the car, and barrels off recklessly down the rutted road, leaving Crow Horse behind
Ray
The Le Baron is already out to where sight reaches farther than sound and silent white dust mushrooms skyward
- is sentinel on a telephone wire that crosses the road from the bar to motel
few trucks remain parked in front of the joint
Ray approaches room 13, looking shell-shocked
His boots leave blue mud prints all the way to the door
He unlocks it
- Ray has cast off his field clothes and is halfway into one of his cleaner suits
He looks haggard but still buoyant, his eyes piercing
The connecting door creaks open and Cooch walks in
The  is freshly showered and he is fidgeting with a Windsor knot
He studies his number two man, says nothing for a moment but is obviously holding something down
His face is a red hue
(extra casual) Couldn't sleep, Ray
Ray looks at Cooch
When he speaks, his voice is dry
No
Cooch crosses the room, and picks up Ray's jeans which look like they went through a sandlot tackle match in a mud hole
Ray tucks his clean shirt in; watching Cooch
had to finish something with Crow Horse
Cooch walks up to Ray slowly and takes his face in his hand, turning it toward lamp light to study the bruise along his left eye, a residual from a Crow Horse hook
That's where you were
You had to go back and have it out with the Indian law
Ray nods, and Cooch slowly breaks a smile
An insecure smile but a smile just the same
He starts to laugh
You fucking hot head, we can get in trouble for that
Cooch laughs in amusement and Ray's face crinkles into a grin as he lowers his eyes, wiping a paper towel over his face
And then, suddenly, Ray lunges at Cooch
He slams the Agent in Charge against the hollow wall, and holds him there
His eyes wild
Why didn't you tell me what we were doing here
Cooch is stunned
We're running a cover-up and you didn't -- Cooch suddenly explodes, throwing Ray off of him and sending him reeling back against the sink
He points a finger at his charge
You ever put your hands on me again and you'll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking Everglades, Mister
You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table -- -- what the hell is Red Deer Table
What is it
It's genocide, that's what it is
It's a Pay Zone for some corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here
Uranium, Cooch
Cooch's eyes go frighteningly cold
He can't believe what he's hearing
Jesus Christ
What are you doing
What the hell were you doing out there
Ray says nothing
He just stands there, against the sink, breathing like a fighter against the turnbuckle
This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi
There is classified information pertaining to our national security
You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination
Jesus Christ -- -- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go
We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray don't know about uranium,  don't know about Red Dog Table -- all know is we did our job
It's over
We neutralized anybody with a voice
Leo, Jimmy
Eagle Bear
Anyone who was standing in the way of the land
Is that it
No
We neutralized enemies of the United States
Anti-American radicals who have killed federal officers out here
Ray turns to the sink, turns the faucet on to get some water on his face
The water only trickles into the basin
Jesus, Ray
You think  don't like the Indians
Not true
These were noble people but their day is gone
They're a conquered nation
They want all of America back but they can't even keep the garbage out of their own front yards
It's sad, Ray
But it's just the way it is
We have to function as a colonial police force out here
Ray leans on the sink, watching the water start to spurt free
He shuts it off
Turns to look at Cooch
And it is then the door opens -- some knocking after the door is already opened -- and  Miles enters
You gentlemen ready -- hi, Ray
Yeah, we're ready
Ray doesn't turn from the sink
-    - Crow Horse chugs along on his motorbike toward the council, his long hair and eagle feather trailing in the wind
- Two federal vehicles are waiting in front of Cooch's Chevy and Ray's Le Baron
One is an  van where Sherman helps load file boxes and computers
Cooch walks with Ray toward the Le Baron, looking at him as the go
Ray looks better as he breathes the morning air
As they pass the second fed car, the back window power glides down, and someone looks out with a friendly smile
Ah, there you are
The Sioux
Ray stops dead
Beholds the Tribal President who wears a western cut jacket and a strained expression behind his smile
He hole a hand out to Ray
You got the troublemakers off our land
Good, Was-te
Ray stares at him, speechless
Horrified
What is he doing here
What about the council fire
Ray somehow nods
Then walks on to the Le Baron
Cooch gets behind the wheel of the car that Clear Moon sits in
Clear Moon's eyes follow Ray to the car
- Crow Horse guns past a little shack
As he does, he looks in his side mirror then out across the grasslands
Then quickly : a car has pulled out from behind the shack
observes this
Then twists the fuel throttle hard
Ray gets behind the wheel, looks at his watch
He is panicking
He starts the car, reverses, slams into drive
: swerving and reckless as he races forward
Sherman, walking around to one of the cars has to run out of the way
The other agents clear out, looking in confusion as Ray cuts a hard  -- sweeps   , the old hitching post -- and   the reservation which lies vast before him
With agents scrambling about, looking after the car, Cooch gets out, looking into the dust Ray left behind Sherman appears beside Cooch aiming a questioning look
When Cooch quickly gets back behind the wheel, Sherman pulls his radio up and starts yelling into it
Cooch reaches out the window and grabs his radio arm
No, damn it
You call teams in and this is gonna be a fucking media event
Get me three cars, six agents, block all reservation exits
It's under control
And Cooch squeals out with a petrified Clear Moon in the backseat, inquiring nervously
Crow Horse passes by an abandoned horse trailer
When he does, another car pulls out
And follows
The first car passes by
Crow Horse sees he's being followed
He cranks his throttle and the engine grinds then dies
He heels his kickstart on the fly, and keeps it alive
But his old horse is no match for the big engines coming up fast behind him
- Ray is leaving little transitional developments and trailers behind
His eyes bore into the road before him, looking for a sign of Crow Horse, and in the rearview for a sign of his mentor
- Crow Horse has the throttle open
But the two cars are coming up on both sides, trying to sandwich him
To his right the Badlands loom deep, a drop into a caliche netherworld of jagged rock
He throws the bike right, trying to ride the thin ribbon of shoulder
floors it, and swipes him, and the bike goes over the edge, launched into -- where it does a violent triple flip, throwing Crow Horse then smashing into a tent shaped dune
sticks out from a window and punches the Badlands with The Le Baron rifles past the abandoned horse trailer
Black smoke drifts in a wind ahead
Ray veers onto the shoulder, barely gets the car in park before bailing and running wildly down into the Badlands
Ray runs, stumbles through the rock and gypsum, searching the area
He runs around the burning motorcycle, looking left and right
Crow Horse
lies on his back in the Badlands, eyes open, fixed unmoving on the sky
Ray comes out of the flame-waves, running with his
45 held high
He throws himself to his knees beside the injured Indian
Crow Horse
Crow Horse rolls his eyes toward the  agent
He has a gash behind his ear, and pink sand clings to the blood
He lifts his head, tries to form words
Ain't no Council Fire, Brother
Clear Moon
know
Come on
We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead
Hoka Hey
It's a good day to die
Bullshit, let's get outta here, Ray gets an arm under the big Indian, helps him up out of a jagged crevice
Grandpa
Cooch's car speeds down the stretch
Followed by Sherman's
The  van
All at one-hundred and five
Gravel and dirt flies
- With Crow Horse half-passed out in the passenger seat, Ray keeps the wheel steady
And then his
X21, please read
Ray
Ray
X21, please read
This is Cooch
Please come in, Ray
Where are you
Ray just stares down at the radio, keeps the pedal floored
The throws the wheel left
The Le Baron fish-tails in a cloud of dust and Ray leaps out of the car, runs toward the little trailer, gun in hand
The windows are all busted, and the door is wide open
Ray runs in
Then straight back out, shaking his head to Crow Horse
Crow Horse hangs his head out the passenger window
He's gone
He hasn't left this place in twenty years
They got him
Ray starts to get back in then hesitates
He looks out across the plains to see -- in the distance, fast approaching, dust rising
Ray gets in quickly
Cooch's car is parked in a roadblock
Clear Moon stands near him, and addresses    as they spill out from a van, carrying rifles and shotguns
(into radio) X21
Ray
Ray, please come in
Cooch has torn his tie away, his shirt is open, and he is sweat soaked
Miles gets out of a car that pulls up
We have a renegade agent, Cooch
He gets off the reservation
-- he's not getting off the reservation
And Cooch gets back in the car, drives off
- With Ray driving like a maniac, Crow Horse is turned around in his seat, watching the federal cars spreading out, the chopper moving in
They got us sealed
What are we gonna do
We're going for The Stronghold
Crow Horse looks at him
(Cooch) Ray
Can you hear me
You are fucked
There's no way out of this
If you won't listen to your own laws, then listen to this: (static: a new voice) This is President Clear Moon
This nation does not want your sympathy
You cannot use this reservation as a sanctuary
Stop where you are now
Ray and Crow Horse exchange a look
(Cooch) Whatever you are trying to do is futile, Raymond
You have nothing
Nothing
Ray picks up the mic as he cranes to keep an eye on the rearview
Yellow bird
is gonna sing
(Cooch) Yellow Bird committed suicide at three o'clock this morning
Some gung-ho agent from
pushed him into a corner
You're playing a losing game
Pull over
Ray takes the mic and for some reason, he's putting it inside his jacket near his shoulder where he keeps his leather
Crow Horse looks at him, puzzled
And then the sound comes forth, the static crackling of a micro-cassette recorder
(Ray) How the hell do you know
(Yellow Bird) blew his back out with a buffalo gun, that's how  know
And now you're gonna say  didn't and put me back in solitary
Ray keeps the tape running into the radio as he drives through rugged Badlands
Crow Horse, stunned by the voice, eyes Ray as the tape rolls
- Cooch and Clear Moon stare in horror at the radio
(Yellow Bird) You people tol' me  could beat nine years if  helped you
helped you
(rewinding) could beat nine years if  helped you
helped you
Cooch is shaking his head in vitrified disbelief
He slams the pedal almost through the floor
- The tape ends and Ray now lifts the mic to his mouth
(into mic) Fuck you
And he too, buries the accelerator
The Le Baron burns forward and we     - of the Badlands as four fed cars spread out in formation, following
- Crow Horse is turned around, looking at the pursuit
Walter
Crow Horse turns, sees what Ray is looking at
: The Stronghold -- a narrow opening in hulking rock formations
Large enough for a car to get in, and keep followers out
That's it
The Stronghold
Get us in there, we got a chance
We're in there
We're in there -- just ahead, the earth is gone
wavering heat pond turns out to be a crevice and they nose down into it, burying the front end in sand and rock
The Le Baron is stuck, wheels spinning out
Ray and Cooch bail
Guns drawn, they start running for the Stronghold
the caravan slides in recklessly, two of the fed cars coming dangerously close to going over the edge
The regional officers and six Clear Moon goons empty out, running down the dip, rifles and shotguns ready
Three more field agents come down from another direction, followed by Cooch
Sherman hands a bullhorn to him
(via bullhorn) The sound of    stops Ray and Crow Horse in their tracks
Just twenty feet from The Stronghold
Crow Horse, windless, stumbles to a knee
Ray turns slowly, facing the small army
Crow Horse, rises, sucking wind, and ditches his gun in the Badlands
Ray holds onto his
45 a moment longer
Then drops it
He stares at -- Cooch,  Miles,  Sherman, Six regional officers, six Clear Moon goons
And now, coming out of the backseat of Cooch's Chevy, Oliver Clear Moon, walking tentatively, cautiously
Cooch lowers the bullhorn
He takes the opportunity to stare at Ray
To let Ray stare at him
The older agent looks broken
Crow Horse, get your face in the dirt
Ray
come forward
Let it go
Let's just let it go
Crow Horse lowers himself to a knee then lies face down
Ray just stands there, the wind against him
(
) Come on, Ray
Come forward
No way, Cooch
Ray refuses to move
sweating, tries to keep control
All around him, hands are on guns
Cooch is walking toward Ray
Ray
'm coming to talk to you
'm gonna walk you out of here
And we're gonna get the hell outta this place
Cooch walks toward him, a gun hanging at one side, bullhorn at the other
The agents behind him, around him, all raise rifles, all take aim
Sherman, looking sick, gets to a knee and sets aim
The sound of clacking steel, all around
But Cooch seems disturbed by the sound
Because its coming from above
He raises an eye from the rifle sight to see -- , training rifles and shotguns down below
looks up from his rifle, bewildered
Then alarmed
We  across fifteen Indians -- old people, women, kids
Their weapons are weak but many
And at the end of the row, Maisy Blue Legs rises, clutching a rifle
And  ,
, many from the trading post porch, rise to the edge, armed
Silent
Twenty, twenty-five, thirty traditionals, forming a line along the ridge, a line that runs in a circle, broken by the Stronghold entrance, then starting again on the next butte
Thirty-five, forty of them
And more, standing along the opposite craggy rock, some wearing tractor caps, some cowboy hats, some just long hair blowing in the wind
Fifty, sixty, -   forming a circle on the rocks; it's Little Big Horn revisited
fourteen year-old boy struggles to keep a huge shotgun at his shoulder
Clear Moon's mouth is as dry as Badlands soil
Cooch is panicking, his eyes running along the high edge
stands equally astonished, assessing the back-up
lifts himself, stands, taking in the sight
stepping stiffly but steadily through the line of armed locals, pushing his way to the very edge so as to look down, Grandpa Sam Reaches
The wind makes feathery tails out of his long thinning strips of white hair
Ray looks up at the old man, then turns to face Cooch
You're right, Cooch
It's over
Cooch slowly, lets the bullhorn fall
Then the rifle
He looks back at Sherman who does the same, and all the way down the line, everyone dropping their arms under the threat of a lot more guns from above
And now Ray walks forward, collecting his gun
Anderson Chasing Hawk, one of the Warriors, runs down to Ray, breathless
All the exits are blocked
There's two more fed cars tryin' to get in
And some press
Ray notices that Cooch is staring at him, hard
He shakes his head slowly
Strongly
Ray
Let the press through
Chasing Hawk takes off, running, and Cooch watches in consternation
Ray just stands eye to eye with him, holding his ground
- And along the ridge, Grandpa and the locals don't budge, watching every move
, we rise above the circle of proud Sioux to see, on the inside of the Stronghold, thirty old trucks and res cars
into and through the fast-moving clouds that the Lakota call The Grandfathers as the   and takes over all sound
: -   - The   of    are delighting a storm of Indian children and  , running through the streets past junked cars on blocks
Over on a little plot of grass and dirt, a pair of hands are digging a small hole
Ray lays a pine cone in the hole and looks down at it for a moment
before hand-plowing the dirt back over it and patting it flat
He rises, knocking dirt off his knees and hands
Crow Horse walks over, bandaged and favoring wounds, and Ray falls in with him, walking down the middle of the village road
His eyes are tired
But hopeful
The people are already talkin' about their vote for a new tribal prez
They wanna vote for Jimmy
Ray nods, encouraged as they walk along
His eyes follow the helicopters
What about the water
You bought her some time, Kola
Ain't never gonna be over
but you bought her some time
Some Indian time
They reach the dusty, dented Le Baron and stand there, looking at each other
Indian time
Crow Horse offers a hand to Ray
He takes it in a white man's shake then follows Walter's cue into the Indian "allies" grip and slap
They hold it there, looking into each other's eyes
(concerned) Where ya gonna go, Ray
Ray ponders for a moment
'll have to see what the visions say about that one
You didn't have another vision
Ray shrugs
Crow Horse discreetly gestures below his belt
Yeah, right here
Ray cracks a smile, a long time coming
You take care
If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little
we'll be here
Ray stands looking at him, searching for words
Ain't no word in Sioux for goodbye
Ray goes to get in his car
But he sees someone sitting across the street on the trading post porch
The old man
Ray considers him for a moment then walks over
They lock eyes
Grandpa stares at Ray as if he's never seen him before, and then arcs a brow
He touches his sleeve at the wrist
Ray rolls his sleeve back to reveal his Rolex
Grandpa smiles and Ray strips it off
He hands it to the old man and his face crinkles into caliche earth
Grandpa holds the watch up in the light, admires it then puts it in his shirt pocket
He moves a flat hand through the air in the "done deal" sign language
Ray, a little surprised that he gets nothing in the trade, returns the smile and walks away
He gets to his car and wipes away two inches of dust from the broken windshield
After  , he gets the engine started
He pulls his gun off his waistband, goes to lay it on the passenger seat and finds something there
Grandpa's sacred caanunpa
The Pipe
Symbol of truth
Ray looks out the window at the old man who is watching him with those sharp black eyes
Ray lifts his hand, holds it flat, and does the Sioux done deal sign
- The Le Baron eats up the dirt road at a moderate, gravel crunching pace
It slows as it passes Maggie Eagle Bear's quiet home on the river
Children walk with the old woman, carrying buckets from the river
The Le Baron slows to a crawl, then drives on
: where the elders sit, watching the dust blow
(
) (voice lingering) We will be here
: walking off down the road
He stops, and looks over his shoulder, trying to glimpse the distance
: driving off the res, under big sky as it ascends a rough hill, waddles through potholes, negotiates with some horses in the road and rolls on toward the reservation line where the sun throws shadows that look like an old man dancing
where West goes to Rapid City, and East back to Bear Creek, Ray stops like the bullet-punched sign orders
He doesn't go West
Doesn't go East
He sits there
Fishes a smoke out from a pocket, clicks a lighter, and fires up
He sits there, smoking
Deliberating
And after a long silent beat,
Like a heart
