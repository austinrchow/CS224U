Screenplay by Bo Goldman -------------------------------------------------------------- --,
- 4:00 patch of water
more water an expanse of river, up the bank to massive lawn running up to a great, classic Hudson River manor house; the country estate of William Parrish
- 4:00 French doors that lead from a wide terrace into an expansive living room,  wide corridors lined with Bierstadt and Cole paintings, the Hudson River School, mists and trees and small boats and distant humans
- 4:00 the doorway to reveal a master bedroom furnish- ed with exquisite simplicity, revelatory of its sleeping occupant,  , 64, a warm but commanding face, a man of maturity yet who exudes a glow of enthusiasm
Although asleep, there is an uncommon restlessness to him
Parrish grips his upper arm as if in pain
Now the severity of the pain wakes him, he squeezes his arm
The wind comes up, through the wind a  is heard distantly, or is it the wind itself: (
) Yes
Parrish blinks, has he heard something, has he not, he is not sure, he releases his arm, his grimace of pain fades, the discomfort seems momentarily to have subsided
He rises now, crosses to the bathroom
As he pees, a breeze outside the window, the wind again, but then the Voice comes up: (
) Yes
It is unmistakably a Voice, it is not the wind, Parrish has heard something, he looks around, but no one is there
He can't finish peeing, turns back to his bedroom
All beweild- ered, Parrish looks around once more, climbs back into bed, trying to trace the source of what he has heard or hasn't heard; he is not sure
He pulls the covers up now, not a , tries to close his eyes
(
) Yes
Parrish sits up again, frightened, but still there is no one there, he seems fraught with indecision, should he get up, should he not, what is happening
He looks out: absolute stillness and silence,  chirp down by the river, a light  from a shadboat, Parrish closes his eyes but then they flutter open, he glances up at the ceiling and finally, exhausted, falls back asleep
,    - The great lawn infested with workmen, planting stakes, un- rolling a huge canvas tent, gardeners fashioning topiary and adding landscaping of their own, crews setting up platforms, speakers, lights
Ubiquitous is , 35, Parrish's older daughter, foremen competing for her attention and she relishing every moment
Painter approaches
The big tent, Miss Allison -- Paint is rust and moss green
Medieval colors -- Daddy's like an old knight
Florist stops her
The head table --
What about it
The flowers, ma'am--
Freesia, freesia, everywhere
Daddy loves freesia -- and you, over there, lights
Not too bright
'm looking for a saffron glow -- sort of tea- dance twenties
,   - Parrish, groomed for the day, trots down the stairs, observ- ing the activity outside through the windows
He checks his watch, strides down the hall, encounters , 50, a family retainer who is opening the doors to the terrace as Parrish passes
What do you think of all this, May
It's going to be beautiful
And Miss Allison says the President may come
Oh, the President's got better things to do than come to my birthday party
(smiling) What
Parrish grins, continues on, is intercepted by Allison who, on catching sight of him, bounces in from the terrace
Daddy
Hi, Allison -- Have you got a minute
Not much more
Big day in the big city
What's on your mind
Fireworks
Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity
The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept
Allison,  trust you
This is your thing
But it's your birthday
Parrish smiles complaisantly, they continue on into a break- fast room where , 30, Parrish's younger daughter, is grazing at a table laden with cereals and fruits and coffee
Good morning, Dad
Hi, honey
(to Susan) 'm Allison, you're 'honey'
(smiling) Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away
Drew's aboard
He wanted to ride back down with you
Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours -- But Parrish only pours coffee
(cont'd) (to Allison) You coming
You've got patients waiting, 've got three hysterical chefs, one loves truffles, the other hates truffles, the third one doesn't know what truffles are
'd better drive down
Parrish gazes at the going-on outside which are increasing in intensity
(unconsciously) hate parties -- Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it
No
Allison goes, Susan observes Parrish fidgeting
Will you relax
know it is a big deal day -- How did you know
Drew told me
Does Drew tell you everything
hope so
You like him, don't you
Yeah
guess so
moment
don't like to interfere
Then don't
The helicopter  in overhead
(cont'd) -- Here comes our boy now -- Shall we
- and May carry the overnight bags for the family as led by Parrish, they hurry towards the helicopter
En route they pass , 38, Allison's husband, who is perched at a portable bar with , the head caterer, tasting wines
This shit's not bad
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr
Quince, a possibility for dessert
(pointing to another bottle) And that
Pinot Grigio
We're considering it for the appetizer
Ambrose takes a sip, swishes the wine in his mouth, spits it in a bucket
What do you do that for
Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning
9:30's almost 10:30
Where  come from, the sun's over the yardarm, m'boy, and the cocktail lamp is lit
Quince drains his wine, presents it for a refill, when he is hailed by Allison
Quince
Everybody's waiting
Quince downs this glass too, runs for the helicopter as , 34, a young man going places, emerges from it, approaches Parrish and Susan
(to Susan) Hello, Beautiful
Hi
Drew kisses her, over her shoulder he glances at Parrish
Good morning, Drew
Thanks for coming out
Well, it's a big day
Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff
Any thoughts
Last minute refine- ments or variations
'Thoughts'
Not a one -- but  did hear a voice last night
voice
In my sleep
What'd it say
'Yes'
'Yes' to the deal
Maybe, who knows
You know how voices are
Let's go
Quince comes running up now
Hi, Bill -- Good morning, Quince
How're you doing--
'm doing great
You ready
am, this is it
Day
How's that, Quince
Bontecou Day
Going to close with Big John -- Look at you, Bill, all cool as a cat and over at Bontecou's, 'll bet he's shitting in his pants
(to Quince) Honey, please
Okay
All aboard - New York, New York
Remember everybody, tonight, dinner in the city at Daddy's
You too, Drew
We've still got some loose ends -- Not my birthday again
You're only six-five once
Thank God
Now could we go
Let's get this day started
Drew ushers everybody on, first Parrish, then Susan and Quince, Drew the last to climb on, shuts the door behind him As Allison hurries away from the whirling rotors
- The configuration of seats has Drew beside Parrish, in front of them Quince and Susan opposite each other in single seats
Just as Drew removes color-coded folders from his attache case and spreads them out for Parrish on his tray table, the pilot waves to Drew, indicating 'phone call'
Drew gets up and heads for the cockpit, Parrish scans the folders, glances over at Susan who is making some notes on a file of her own
He motions to her to please come sit beside him, she checks that Drew is still busy in the cockpit, tucks her papers into her carryall, and crosses over to Parrish who folds away the work that Drew set before him into his tray table, locks it
thought you were in a meeting--
am
With you
He peers up ahead at Drew, on the telephone and gesticulat- ing intensely, right at home in the cockpit despite the of the blades and the pilot pressed up against him
(cont'd) Do you love Drew
There's a start for a meeting
know it's none of my business -- Susan doesn't answer for a moment, then impulsively kisses her father on the cheek
No, it's none of your business
Another moment
Do you love Drew
You mean like you loved Mom
Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him
Probably
moment
(smiles) Don't get carried away
Uh oh -- Susan, you're a hell of a woman
You've got a great career, you're beautiful -- And 'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me
Well,  wasn't going to say that -- What were you going to say
Listen, 'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it
So what's wrong with that
That's for me
'm talking about you
It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say
You're not listening -- Oh yes,  am
Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice
Don't get dirty, Dad -- Well, it worries me
want you to get swept away
want you to levitate
want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish
That's all
Be deliriously happy
Or at least leave yourself open to be
'Be deliriously happy'
'm going to do my upmost -- He smiles
know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without
If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with
say fall head over heels
Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back
And how do you find him
Forget your head and listen to your heart
'm not hearing any heart
(a moment) Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back
Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this
To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all
You have to try
Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived
Bravo
Aw, you're tough
'm sorry
But give it to me again
The short version
Stay open
Who knows
Lightning could strike
Silence
(cont'd) Forgive the lecture -- won't
And when  tell Drew about it, he won't either
You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton
You're terrible
know
But 'm the only father you've got
She kisses him on the cheek
Thank God
He doesn't care
But thanks anyway
34TH  ,    - The AStar lands, an attendant, waiting with a luggage cart, rushes to open the door and unload the bags
The passengers, Parrish paired with Quince, Drew with Susan, file off the rooftop through a door which opens into an elevator
,    - Parrish, Susan, Drew and Quince face forward as they ride downwards
Hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, 'm getting all excited
So what do you think, is it -- (indicates Drew and Parrish) -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me
Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill
More people might -- know
Gum up the works
Parrish is about to make some reassuring comment to Quince when the Voice suddenly intrudes: (
) '
know, it's none of my business
' What
was saying to Quince we won't need -- Did you just hear something
Why yes, Bill,  was saying to Quince -- No no, not you
Daddy, what's the matter
Nothing
'm sorry
respectful silence, the elevator continues downwards, suddenly the Voice intrudes again: (
) '
want you to levitate
want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish
' Parrish grunts bizarrely, Susan notices and reacts: What is it, Daddy --
Nothing
Parrish's eyes dart about, confirming no one has heard a thing but him
(cont'd) Just talking to myself again
You know me -- The elevator door opens
Well, here we are -- Parrish leads the group out
34TH ,    - They exit the building
(to Parrish) Are you okay
-Okay
Got my gloves on, my ears pricked
'm ready for action
Well, go get 'em, Pops
Yer damn right
Parrish, followed by Drew, steps into a waiting limousine, Quince looks longingly after them
Susan, blowing a kiss goodbye to her father, steps out into the street to hustle a cab
,    - Tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and Big John, it'll lead network news
Okay so far
Sounds good
It's going to be great -- Do you think  need a haircut
Bill, after this deal, you'll be able to afford one
Parrish smiles, they step into the elevator
- Parrish and Drew emerge from the elevator, Parrish observing the overkill decor
Their  guy asked me, what did think Parrish Communications stood for, that's principle and ethics- wise
came up with something, but then it occurred to me, why don't ask Bill
What do you think
moment, Parrish shrugs
Our first annual report, must be thirty-five years ago now,  owned two stations,  wrote down a state- ment of purpose, that one day you would wake up to a Parrish radio station, read a Parrish paper at breakfast, catch our news on tele- vision during the day, and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain, have a good time
That's great
Wait 'til  show it to Bontecou
Drew opens a door, a conference room, a circle of top exec- utives, now stepping out from the group is a huge, white- haired man,  , 55
Bill, thanks for coming over
(to Drew) And how're you doing today, Drew
(to Parrish) You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table
Good, good
Glad to hear it
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where was
'm sorry,  don't recall -- Left field somewhere
Well, Bill, want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes -- thought you were buying my company
Oh, Mr
Parrish,  could never buy Parrish Communications
could pay for it, of course, but it would always have your imprint
Silence
Parrish looks around at the circle of 'suits', Bontecou holding away
Well, that's very nice to hear
Drew nods excitedly
- The busy medical community at 68th Street and New York Avenue
,    - thriving eatery diagonally across from the hospital's entrance, customers cheek-by-jowl as a pair of waiters juggle breakfasts served to a noisy throng of doctors, residents and interns
Susan has squeezed into a seat in the corner
counterman, with a smile and a greeting, places a cup of coffee in front of her
sense this is a daily ritual, arming herself for the day; immediately she becomes aware of a man behind her speaking into the pay phone
An attractive  , early 30's, a pair of suitcase at his feet, a raincoat slung over his shoulder
Honey, you've got to go on
there's a time to sow and a time to reap, you sow now and forget about him
yeah,  liked him,  don't like him anymore
because you're my honey and anybody messes with you messes with me -- 'm on a plane in a minute
as soon as  get my phone in, you're my first call, that's a promise
where you going now
good, hit the books, get that degree, one day we'll hang out a shingle together
you bet, honey
later
The Young Man hangs up, turns around and sits down to an overflowing plate of eggs and meat, potatoes and toast, the counterman refills his cup and the Young Man ties into the breakfast, eating it with such relish that Susan can't take her eyes off him
He senses her eyes, glances over, his cheeks filled with a mouthful of food, swallows embarrassedly
Good morning,  was talking kind of loud there, sorry
Not at all
It was fascinating
Oh yeah
What was 'fascinating' about it
You and 'Honey'
My kid sister
She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school
'm sorry -- Nothing to be sorry about
That's the way with men and women, isn't it
What's the way
Nothing lasts
agree -- Why
was just being agreeable, now 've got to explain why
'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy
He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it
One girlfriend wasn't enough for him
So you're a one-girl guy
Damn right
Looking for her right now
Who knows
You might be her
Susan laughs
(cont'd) Well, don't laugh
just arrived in town, got a new job -- 'm trying to get into this apartment
You a doctor
How'd you know
Everybody's a doctor around here
This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers
The guy 'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor
What kind of doctor
Me
Internal medicine
The Young Man smiles
So if  needed a doctor, you could be it
could be her
'Her'
moment
Yes,  could
(a moment) have an office in the hospital
-- This is my lucky day
arrive in this big bad city and  not only find a doctor, a beautiful woman as well
Susan looks into her coffee
(cont'd) 'm sorry, you mind my saying that
Not at all
How 'bout another cup of coffee
've got patients coming in -- And  want to get into my apartment and go to work
Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee
Two pots are warming behind the counter, he reaches over and refills her cup and his
Pushes a container and pitcher to- wards her
(cont'd) see you use lots of sugar and cream
Me, too
They smile at each other, fix up their coffee
,    - magnificent granite building, a monument to good taste in the midtown sea of glass and aluminum
,   - Parrish and Drew enter, no particular fanfare but an aware- ness the 'Chief' has arrived, everyone giving Parrish the appropriate wide berth, Drew right beside him
'm all excited -- Me, too
thought it was great,  thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop -- (faltering) Instead it was -- Like a marriage made in heaven
You have a way with words
They stride to the main bank of elevators
,   - Parrish, Drew beside him, proceeds through a high tech, but tasteful, maze, spiffy executive secretaries at burnished desks
Neither looking right or left, somehow Parrish man- ages to acknowledge their bright smiles and deferential nods despite his swift entrance
He passes through an open set of doors and he is into his own suite, commanded by , his assistant
Good morning, Mr
Parrish
Hi, Jennifer
Drew is still at Parrish's heels, but now Parrish stops at the open door, turns back to him, reminding Drew that this is as far as he goes without being invited
So
Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right
As close as a deal could be
(bursting) Olympic
Parrish disappears into his office
Drew, on his way out, glides past Jennifer's desk
(cont'd) This is our lucky day
Jennifer acknowledges Drew with a smile, rises and moves to Parrish's doorway, waiting for the day's instructions, but Parrish only nods to the door and Jennifer quickly closes it, returns to her desk
'  - Alone in his office, Parrish's ebullient mood immediately changes
Leaning against the back of the couch, he stares out through floor-to-ceiling windows, surveying the Manhattan skyline: cogitates
He takes a seat on the couch, opens a folder, suddenly he flinches with a spasm of pain in his shoulder
It is sharp but brief, he notices it but what it does not continue, he ignores it
Parrish resumes looking at the folder when suddenly the pain comes again
He reaches for his shoulder, tries to massage the pain, it does not subside
Parrish stands, trying to shake it off, but it refuses to go away, some- thing is unmistakably wrong
Now a  which he has come to recognize, makes itself heard: (
) Yes
Frozen with surprise, Parrish's eyes search the room for the source of the , it comes from no particular direction, yet surrounds him
Suddenly Parrish's symptoms sharply intensify, he is sinking to the floor but somehow grabs a corner of the desk, holds on with one hand, with the other clutches at his shoulder and arm, the pain has violently seized the upper part of his body
He breaks out in a sweat, his pallor now waxen as the Voice repeats itself: (
, cont'd) Yes
Parrish grips the edge of the desk, the pain assaulting him on the one hand, the Voice coming at him from the outer, each aberration feeds on the other, he is beside himself, consumed with pain and bewildered by what seems to be a hallucination but which he is certain is not
Parrish is possessed
He angles his face in every direction, arbi- trarily chooses one and now embarrassedly, unconsciously, enrage, responds to the Voice
'Yes' what
'Yes' is the answer to your question
didn't ask any question
believe you did
Parrish is absolutely confounded, seized up with pain and consternation at this unseen Voice which has such presence and reality
Who are you
Silence
(cont'd) Goddammit, what is going on
think you know -- don't
Try
Because 'if you haven't tried, you haven't lived'
moment
What are you talking about
What you were talking about
Parrish gasps
What is this
Who is this fucking guy
He holds on tight to the corner of the desk, sweat dripping, his skin ashen
Now he addresses the Voice again, searching for it in another direction: (cont'd) Tell me who you are
Are you giving me orders
'm sorry,  -- No, you're not
You're trying to 'handle' the situation but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle
spasm, the worst one yet, finally it subsides and there is an eerie silence in the room, a , almost more disturbing than the voice that has filled it
Where are you
Are you there
It's enough now
Please
Talk to me -- There's going to be plenty of time for that
What do you mean
think you know -- Know what
(a moment) Know what, goddammit
The  is gone
Parrish searches the corner, but the room has lost the quality it had when it was inhabited by the , it is now just Parrish's office
Faint  of traffic from the street, then a  at the door
Parrish touches his shoulder, the pain is gone, but he is still wet with sweat, the  again
Parrish straightens himself up, adjusts his tie, runs his fingers through his hair, blinks as he addresses the door
(carefully) Come in
Jennifer enters
've been buzzing you, Mr
Parrish
Are you all right
Sure
Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_ (interrupting) No
Nothing
Nothing
Parrish is within himself, doesn't answer
(cont'd) Why don't  think of something
Parrish still doesn't answer, however Jennifer is satisfied, correctly hearing his silence as an affirmative
She has her hand on the door, 'Open' or 'Closed'
He nods and she closes it
Utter silence again
Parrish's eyes search the room, nothing there
,  , The place has cleared out now, the counterman busy bussing tables laden with dishes and cups, Susan and the Young Man are still at the counter, but about to leave
It's kind of a pro bono job
'Pro bono'
That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life
know what you're saying
Doesn't pay very well
Depends on the woman marry
Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap -- You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry
would
Susan rises now, the Young Man with her, leaving money for their checks they head for the door
(cont'd) If  married you, 'd want to give you what you wanted,  know it's old fashioned and all that, but what's wrong with taking care of a woman
She takes care of you
You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days -- You never know
Lightning could strike
Susan at the door now, pauses abruptly, her eyes on the Young Man
,   - The Young Man holds the door for Susan as they step out onto the street
Susan is staring at him now, he smiles, all open and vulnerable
've got to go -- Did  say something wrong
No, it was so right it scares me
've been thinking
don't want you to be my doctor
Because don't want you to examine me
Why
Because  like you so much
(a moment) You have coffee here every morning, don't you
If  came by, could you give me the name of a doctor
Another moment
Sure, 'll give you the name of a doctor
(a moment) And  don't want to examine you
Why not
Because  like you so much
Now 've got to go
She hurries away down the sidewalk, the Young Man watching her
Now he turns and starts off in the opposite direction
- She looks back at the Young Man, then turns and walks on
- He looks back at Susan as the distance between them widens, now he turns and walks on
She looks around once more but the Young Man is still headed in the opposite direction, his back to her
She turns the corner and continues on
Approaching the corner, he looks back for Susan yet again, but she is gone, still turned he steps off into the street and a hospital supplies truck, speeding down the curb lane, , a horrific impact, the  echoes as his body arcs through the air
Another sickening  as it lands, the Young Man lies crumpled, still
: ,  ,    - beautiful space adjacent to the dining room, it has a glass roof which offers a superb view of the Manhattan sky- line
The hour is before dinner: gathered on one side of the room are Allison and Parrish, on the other side Drew and Quince
, a butler, and , the housekeeper, pass hors d'oeuvres and drinks
Music,  know how you love music, Daddy, and  want to have music that pleases you -- and of course doesn't put a thousand other people to sleep -- 've agonized over this and finally settled on Sidney Brown, twenty-four men, very eclectic, plus 'm feathering in a Latin sextet on their breaks - Tito Puente, Trini Lopez-zy,  forget their names -- Parrish has tuned Allison out, he tried to stay with it, but his mind has wandered, the event of the day too much with him
(cont'd) You haven't heard a word, have you
keep talking and all you do is nod like Mr
Himmelfass in The Nutcracker
Parrish still doesn't answer
(cont'd) You don't care, do you
What, honey
lay awake nights in a cold sweat, want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, want it to be perfect -- (attentive now) know you do, darling
And you could care less -- Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart
can' tell you how much  appreciate it and how 'm looking forward to it
Good
Songs
What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play
stab of pain, Parrish discreetly grabs his upper arm but manages to keep his attention on Allison
Tell it to me again
Suddenly, the Voice cuts in: (
) Yes
Parrish's head snaps, startled by the
(
, cont'd) (to Parrish) Did you miss me
Parrish reacts once more, aware again he is the only one who has heard the Voice, as an oblivious Allison continues: (to Parrish) Never mind
Leave it to me
Parrish ignores her, his attention has been taken by the Voice
His eyelids flutter, nonplused, edgy and fearful
Mr
Parrish, dinner is served
(to Quince and Drew, across the room) Chow-time, you guys
Parrish is confounded
Blindly and disconcerted, he follows Allison and Drew and Quince
- As a disturbed Parrish approaches the table, he hears the Voice once more: (
) What are you looking so provoked about
'Did you miss me
'  It's a normal question
missed you
But what do  get back
'Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill --' Parrish sits
(
, cont'd) '-- This relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice'
Parrish is on the edge of his seat, struggling to hide his panic
(
, cont'd) 'm waiting outside
The conversation swirls on around Parrish, he is deaf to it: (to Drew) Did you speak to the Governor
He's coming
His wife
Unfortunately
sat between them at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was better than Seconal
(
) 'm waiting outside
Won't someone come to the door
Parrish is in shock, still striving to gain control of himself
As Coyle serves him, Parrish turns to Luisa: Is somebody waiting outside, Luisa
didn't hear a ring, sir
Please have a look -- Luisa goes as Coyle continues serving
(to Quince) What about the Mayor
He said he would be there with bells on
Good, maybe they'll drown him out
Parrish is still not hearing a word, preoccupied with the return of Luisa
Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the , the Chairman of the , nine Senators, don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'
No jocks
twenty-game winner or a Masters champion
Someone  could talk to
(a moment) Or would talk to me
Luisa returns to Parrish as the others' conversation drones on: You're right, Mr
Parrish
There was a gentleman at the door
He's waiting for you in the foyer
Parrish is stunned
(after a moment) Show him into the library, tell him 'll be right there
Parrish, spinning with anxiety, tries to summon up his courage to go as Allison continues: 've arranged for favors -- silver charm bracelets for the women, platinum keychains for the men -- all engraved '
' -- but now 'm thinking of scrubbing them, they seem so ordinary
Finally Parrish rises from the table, starts out
(cont'd) Are they ordinary
Do they seem that way to you, Daddy
Uh --  don't know
No - uh - don't
Allison is about to press the point, but then drifts into disappointed silence as Parrish leaves the room
(to Allison) You're overthinking it -- don't think they're ordinary love keychains
,   - Parrish moves deliberately down the hall, slows as he nears the doorway to the library
The door is open
He hesitates before he crosses the threshold, taking in as much as his eye can see, now tentatively, he enters
,   - beautiful, classic room, areas of dim, warm light, club chairs, books reaching to the ceiling, a rolling library ladder, a weathered dictionary on a stand, a model boat carved of bone set into the stacks which are separated from the reading area by a seven-foot high partition of obscured glass
Parrish, poised in the doorway, looks around, nothing in sight
Hello
Silence
(cont'd) Anyone here
No response
(cont'd) said is anyone here
(
) Quiet down
Parrish is startled, he shrinks backward for a moment, his eyes searching the room for the Voice, the timbre and pitch of which is exactly what he has heard before
There is the sense that someone is there but Parrish cannot see him, and he does not dare look
(quietly) Where are you
(
) 'm here
Now a flicker of a shadow from behind a corner of the obscured glass, the section of the room most distant from Parrish, there is a shape
Something is there
What is this, a joke, right
Some kind of elaborate practical joke
At my 40th reunion, we delivered a casket to the Class president's hotel room and -- Quiet
Parrish falls silent, something in the  and  of the Voice muting him
He takes a step backwards
(cont'd) Where are you going
-  - uh -- The shape moves, makes itself more visible
Although still diffused by the glass, the shape has definition, a person, a man, his features are not yet distinguishable, but he is there all right
The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words
The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'
all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without
', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones -- What the hell is this
Who are you
Just think of millenniums multiplied by aeons compounded by infinity, 've been around that long, but it's only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest
Call it boredom, the natural curiosity of me, the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you
Parrish struggles to make sense of what he is hearing
About what
want to have a look around before take you
'Take me'
Where
It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one
'The one' to do what
Show me around
Be my guide
And in return, you get
(breathless) Get what
Time
What the hell are you talking about
Watch it
'm sorry -- In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, 'm not going to go into details what matters is that  stay interested
Parrish squints, trying to make sense of what is happening
(cont'd) 'Yes'
Yes what
'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion
What question
Bill
Come on
The question
The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning
The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself -- The 'question' -- (urging) Yes, Bill
The question
After a moment
Am  going to die
The figure who is the Voice takes a step forward now, no longer obscured by the glass he comes into the light, re- vealing himself to be the Young Man seen previously in the coffee shop, but there is a change; he seems odd, off- center, not handsome but terrifyingly beautiful
Yes
moment, Parrish beside himself
He cannot bring himself to speak, finally: Am  dreaming this
(Another moment) Are you a dream
am not a dream
You're coming to 'take me'
What is that
Who the hell are you
The Young Man steps closer to Parrish, his face is inches from a shaking, sweating Parrish's face, the Young Man daring Parrish to identify him: You are --
(urging again) '
Yes --' Parrish turns away
But the Young Man, spectacularly, is in front of him again
(cont'd) (gently) Who am
Death
Parrish is shocked, stunned, terrified at the word, by what he has comprehended
He surveys the Young Man who, at this moment, actually seems bewildered by his effect
(cont'd) You're Death
Yes
Death
That's me
You're not Death
You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants
The jacket and the pair of pants came with the body  took
Let me ask your opinion
Do  blend in
hopelessly confused Parrish does not respond for a moment
You want me to be your guide --
You fill the bill, Bill
do
(a moment) How long will you be staying
You should hope quite a while
And then --
The Young Man nods, gently
(cont'd) It's
it's
over
long silence
Parrish and the Young Man take each other in, the sense that now they understand each other
at the door
(
) Mr
Parrish
Parrish does not hear her for the moment, Luisa steps inside the Library
(cont'd) Will the gentleman be staying for dinner, sir
Parrish ignores her at first, finally he looks at Luisa then at the Young Man, then once more at both of them as if to verify the Young Man's presence has been acknowledged by Luisa
The Young Man interjects: (to Luisa) Yes
(a polite afterthought) Thank you
Luisa nods perfunctorily and exits
Parrish is frozen, dumbfounded
(cont'd) (to Parrish) Where is dinner
Parrish does not answer at first
This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us
Bill,  am eating dinner with you
And your family
And that's what we're doing
It's not open for discussion
Nothing is
Don't you understand
Parrish is frightened by the response
(cont'd) Good
Now lead the way
Parrish hesitates, then obediently leads the Young Man out of the library, down a long hallway and across the foyer
Excuse me
Could  say something
Of course
(quietly) It just occurred to me -- Speak up, please
(louder) When  introduce you, if  say who you are,  don't think anyone will stay for dinner
Then don't
- As Parrish and the Young Man enter, Allison is heard in the background
Well, here's another possibility
It's a little last minute, but how does this strike you
Kaleidoscopes
Little gold kaleidoscopes
Some German firm went kerplunkt, Tiffany's picked these things up, they're perfect party favors, however they're not personal, they're winter scene or something, snow-flakes and dachshunds
Parrish and the Young Man appear at the table, an awkward pause ensues, the unannounced guest's presence at a family dinner being noted, and the guest himself carefully survey- ed
Finally, Allison breaks the ice: (cont'd) (to the Young Man) Hi there -- Hello
Parrish is horribly uncomfortable as the Young Man looks at each person as if he were discovering a face of the first time
Uh -- sorry -- to have stepped away for so long -- uh -- this is a friend of mine  asked to drop by -- we got to talking and stuff -- uh -- he's going to join us for dinner -- um -- Parrish drifts into another awkward pause
(to the Young Man) Hello, how nice to meet you
And wouldn't it be nicer if my father would introduce you
(to Allison) '
How nice to meet you
' Oh, 'm sorry
This is my daughter, Allison, and her husband, Quince, Drew, my number one, works with me
Parrish drifts off as the Young Man awkwardly shakes hands with each person
(prompting) Daddy
Does your friend have a name
name
(pleasantly, going along with the joke) Yeah, something he goes by -- Oh, excuse me
This is -- uh -- this is -- Daddy
Come on, a name
Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me
Sorry
um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head -- What
(cont'd) 'm sorry
This is - uh - uh
The group waits patiently
(cont'd) Joe
Joe
Parrish once more drifts into silence
(The   is now identified as ""
) Just plain 'Joe'
Love that name
Me, too
Hey, buddy
Joe, turned on by Quince's broad smile, reacts to it as Drew squints observingly at Joe
'Joe
' Yes
Is there any more to it
(alarmed) What do you mean
Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --' Parrish's face reveals a desperate searching for a last name, a furtive glance at Joe
Parrish's brow darkens and a name tumbles from his lips: -- Black
Whew, at last
Nice to meet you, Mr
Black
'Joe Black'
Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952
Yes
(to Joe) You bet
'm kind of my Rotisserie League
Are you
He is
Let's sit down -- Luisa has set a plate in front of Joe, and Parrish's, which was taken to the kitchen to be warmed, has been returned
Joe looks over at the other guests, then picks up his uten- sils gingerly, strives to copy the others, stops, staring at his foot
(to Joe) Paillarde of veal
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen
Honey --
You know what 'm saying, Joe
No -- (laughing emptily) Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite -- Drew is studying Joe
(to Joe) Have we met
Uh -- he's from out of town -- How long you here, Joe
As long as it takes
Drew is provoked by the response, but remains polite: You and Bill old friends
Parrish jumps in: No -- (to Joe) get the feeling you've done some business before
We have an arrangement now
What side of the industry did you say you were on
didn't say
(to Parrish) Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already
Need any help with the details
Parrish falls silent again, looking for an answer
(cont'd) 'm sorry -- business at dinner
(to Joe) Forgive me for being so rude
Sure
The doors to the dining room open, Susan appears
Hi, everybody
Sorry to be late - had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief -- You ate
'm here, aren't
Wouldn't miss a loose end meeting
What's on the table for discussion
Party favors, flowers -- hi Dad, hi Drew -- She kisses Drew in some light, humorous way they have ob- viously done before, their heads bobbing like plastic water toys and their lips meeting mid-air
At the kiss's conclusion Susan suddenly notices Joe is present and has been watching
She is shocked, embarrassed, pleased, conflicted, an instant and wide spectrum of emotions
(cont'd) What are you doing here
Silence
(stunned) You know each other
(lightly) We've met
What
-- This morning
The Corinth Coffee Shop
He was looking for a doctor
Well,  guess he's found one
Joe, you do get around
Joe is happily confounded by all the interaction
That's your name
And isn't it a lovely one
So sturdy, so straight -- Joe has heard Susan's question but, as he studies her, doesn't answer
Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying
Here
'Here'
In this house
Great
Parrish pushes his plate away
Uh - will that hold you, Joe
Incidentally, 'Joe' what
Black
Hey, this is fun
So, what are you doing here
Parrish tenses, but Joe doesn't answer
(cont'd) Cat got your tongue
You weren't so silent this morning
Drew reacts to this allusion of intimacy
Now, 'm getting interested
want to know more --- (to Joe) We've got some things to discuss
Parrish stands, motions for Joe to rise
(to Joe) -- Did  hear 'business'
What 'business'
Don't bother asking, we already tried
It's so very nice to see you again
Funny,  don't get that feeling
Maybe it's because you found out 'm Bill Parrish's daughter
Cut it out, Susan
(to Joe) You and 've got to talk
Big day tomorrow, everybody
Joe, let's go
Joe rises, follows Parrish to the door, stops: (to Susan) Susan
(to Allison) Allison
(to Quince) Quince
(to Drew) Drew
(to Parrish) Bill
(to the group) Thank you
He makes an awkward little bow, then heads for the nearest door
Joe, that's the kitchen
Thank you
Joe pivots, and he follows Parrish out the proper door
That was 'Joe'
He's cute
Very
Susan's eyes are still on the door where Joe exited, her face reflecting her irritation and bewilderment, as well as a tinge of excitement
,   - Parrish leads the way, Joe beside him as they progress through the huge house
'm sorry, 'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me
'Threw' you
Where
Shook me up
mean that you knew her and everything -- didn't know her
The body  took knew her
The man she met in the coffee shop this morning
- uh - took him
So there's nothing between you and Susan
No
wish you had said something to me about staying here -- It hadn't occurred to me until then
was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what 'm here for
Parrish suddenly looks very anxious, Joe stops
(cont'd) You seem uncomfortable, Bill
No, 'm okay with this - uh - think
So -- He opens a door
,   - (to Joe) Bathroom
tub
towels, sauna -- Parrish turns back to the bedroom
(cont'd) Chair, lamp, bed -- Parrish is in a stunned state, chatters on unconsciously: (cont'd) Box springs, they're assembled in Jakarta
Had to stay in a station manager's house there unexpectedly - best night's sleep  ever had
Ordered twenty, they filled a con- tainer and shipped them right over, 've put one in every bedroom here and in the country
Joe tests the springs
What a good idea
Thank you
Would you like the man's name
No
Parrish glances around, a room in which the occupant could not want for anything
If there is anything else, don't hesitate -- won't
How long have  got
You're putting me on the spot, Bill
moment
(cont'd) Let's put it this way
When  go, you go
When you go,  go
That's the best  can do
(a moment) but minute-by-minute,  find myself lingering
just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine
Your doctor
(icily) Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta
Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain
Were they any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart of suffocating in an avalanche on a skin vacation in Gstaad
No -- hope you realize, Bill
in your office this morning, that was your time
Closer than that
Parrish keeps still, trying to cool the heat of Joe's temper
(cont'd) But meanwhile, you are still here
Count your blessings
Call it gravy, frosting on the cake, whatever it is you say
Well, thank you for letting me know
Not at all
And - uh -   guess, 'goodnight'
Good night to you, Bill
Parrish gently closes the door
Joe looks around, checks out his surroundings: curious, attentive
,   - Parrish, unsteady, starts back down the hall, Luisa appears
Miss Allison asked if you would like to have your dinner kept warm
No
Thanks, Luisa
Very good, sir
Luisa turns: Luisa -- She stops
(cont'd) Mr
Black's luggage was misplaced by the airlines
Would you mind get- ting a few things together for him
couple of suits, some shirts, ties, underwear, shoes
Have Coyle take his measurements off what he is wearing tonight
Certainly, sir
Luisa nods, and heads back downstairs
Parrish enters his den, takes a seat in his chair, stares into the middle distance, ruminates
,   - Joe has been examining his room, full of curiosity and wonderment at the oddest things, the handle on a casement window, the hem and weight of the fabric of a drape, hinges on the bedroom door
In the process he opens this door, steps out into the hallway
,   - Joe wanders down the hallway past the occasional Dufy or Miro, a Venetian tapestry cheek-by-jowl with a miniature Ming vae, and even a Bonsai garden with a trickling vein of water
,   - In the "back" of the house now, utilitarian paint and decor, the  of laughter and a glare of light
Joe enters
,   - The staff is at ease, some smoking, remains of food around
Coyle, the butler, has his back to Joe and does not see him for a moment
In front of Coyle, an open jar of peanut but- ter which he is spreading in generous hunks of Wonder Bread
Joe is fascinated by the process
Coyle suddenly hears the silence, looks up and see Joe, standing up embarrassedly
Yes, sir
Hello
'm Joe Black
Nice to meet you
Yes sir, Mr
Black, a pleasure
The staff all mumble expansive "Good evening, sir"s to Joe
He motions to them to sit, they do but Coyle does not
Coyle shifts from foot-to-foot, the staff is not used to having Parrish family or guests in this part of the house
(to Coyle) What are you eating
You mean this, sir
Coyle regards his peanut butter sheepishly
(cont'd) Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter
(carefully) 'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'
(a moment) You like it
would say, sir, it is right up there with Jif and Skippy
But miles ahead of Peter Pan
(another moment) Like a taste
Joe nods, Coyle fashions a spoonful, offers it to Joe
Joe swallows it
But he has not yet found a comfortable way of masticating, his mouth and tongue go every which way, the staff observes him, fascinated
(cont'd) You're a peanut butter man now, eh, sir
Yes,  am
thoroughly enjoyed this - uh - peanut butter
(to the staff) And  thoroughly enjoyed meeting you
Joe raises the spoonful of peanut butter in a kind of toast to the staff
(cont'd) 'll be moseying on
He heads out, with the spoonful of peanut butter, to cheer- ful "Goodnight, Mr
Black"'s, his tongue again licking the edges of the spoon
,   - spectacular indoor Olympic pool, window commanding views of the skyline
Susan is swimming laps, looking very professional in a black Speedo suit, Joe wanders in, still licking his peanut butter
He observes her, but she is unaware of him, however now, as she makes a barrel turn, his shadow falls over a reflection from a window, she aborts her lap, looks up to see who it is
What are you doing here
'm lost
-- Can't seem to escape you today
'm sorry
Susan climbs out of the pool, gets halfway up the ladder, points to a stack of towels
Hand me one of those, will you
Joe turns to the towels, but one hand is occupied with the spoonful of peanut butter, he shifts it to the other hand, can't manage the huge Turkish towel one-handed, now implants the spoon in his mouth, lifts the towel with both hands and presents it to Susan
(cont'd) You must have something really big going on with my father -- 'Big'
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first
You're in the red-hot center of big business and  thought you were a regular Joe
am Joe
Not the one  met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as 've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out 'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger
That is not my intention
Joe continues to nibble at his peanut butter
What are your intentions
To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and  don't mind admitting it was turned,  liked it, but ten hours later  feel like a fool
don't get it
You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and don't like being upset
Who are you anyway
And what are you eating
(mumbles) Peanut butter
He finishes the spoonful
(cont'd) But it's gone now
He shifts the spoon from hand to hand, starts to stick it in his pocket, realizes this is inappropriate
Susan holds her hand out to him, he places the spoon in it and she sets the spoon on the table with the towels
She watches, fascinat- ed, as Joe licks his gums, enjoying every last bit of his spoonful
You act like you never had peanut butter before -- haven't
-- What kind of childhood did you have
Do you love Drew
Come again
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing
Drew is none of your damn business
Nor is where  put my mouth
'm sorry
Do you live here
No, Joe, 'm swimming here
Then 'm going home
guess what 'm trying to say is -- 'd like us to be friends
've got plenty of friends
don't have any
can see why
She finishes drying herself, drops the towel on a chair, and prepares to leave
didn't mean to offend you at dinner
'm not quite at home some- times with people
get busy doing - uh - what  do, and  don't seem to have developed -- He drifts off
Yes --
have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time
Bu sometimes - uh - speculate - uh -  haven't left room for - uh - anything else
'm sorry to say  know what you're saying
moment
Susan
Yes
Did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder
She glances at her shoulder, he grabs a towel, touches the drops of water, pats them dry, hands her the towel
She flashes a nervous smile
Goodnight, Joe
Goodnight to you, Susan
Susan steps towards a door, Joe takes a step in the wrong direction, they almost walk into each other
Now she takes a step in another direction, as does Joe, again they almost collide
Shall we dance
Joe is completely puzzled, finally Susan heads for one door, Joe for another
(cont'd) Joe -- Yes
think you want to go to the west wing
Through there
Susan indicates yet another door
(after a moment) Thank you
Joe redirects himself, goes to the door
As they both are about to exit, Joe and Susan sneak furtive looks at each other across the pool, smile at catching each other's glances
Joe exits
For a moment Susan's eyes remain on the door through which he has gone
Now she grips the towel over her shoulders, the one Joe gave her, pats the same spot he did
: ,   - Parrish, dressed for the day, passes servants busy with their morning tasks, polishing doorknobs, putting away linen, dusting picture frames
He nods and greets them as he strides down the hall, brisk "Good morning"'s to Coyle and Luisa
,   - Parrish knocks, waits a courteous moment, opens the door, finds Joe in an elegant shirt and trousers trying to tie his tie
Good morning
Good morning, Bill
How are you
How're you feeling
'Feeling'
feel fine
How do you feel
Um -- well,  didn't sleep too well
This is crazy
This is the left- field thing of all time
What do do
What do  tell my family
Oh,  wouldn't tell them anything, Bill
You'll ruin the good start we had last night
felt as if  were being treated like a person
'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but  am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who  am - our adventure would end abruptly
Parrish regards Joe, the tie is a sorry mess now, a batwing of silk stretching across his collarbone
(cont'd) But  did so enjoy your family
Parrish is startled, he regards Joe carefully
What about my family
This 'adven- ture' involved only me, right
Silence as Joe considers the point, Parrish quickly crosses to him, undoes the tie, and now begins tying it for him
(cont'd) Tell you what, you promised that it's going to be only me and -- And what
And  won't tell anyone who you are
Sounds fair enough
It is a deal
'deal'
You give your word,  give mine -- that we'll do what we say
It's a truth exchanged between two people
moment
Bill -- Yes
You've got a deal
Parrish seems relieved
He has now, with some difficulty, completed the tying of Joe's tie, adjusts it beautifully on Joe's collar, then spins him around in front of a mirror
Joe, catching sight of his own appearance, rises to the balls of his feet, quite taken
(cont'd) This is great
(a moment) Now what do we do
Shake hands
Joe immediately extends his hand toward Parrish, but Parrish freezes on seeing the hand, stares at it, now takes it
Joe pumps Parrish's hand vigorously, then breaks into a broad smile
5TH ,    - Parrish and Joe striding downtown, Joe's jacket fits per- fectly, he blends right in and he clearly enjoys being part of the smart Fifth Avenue crowd on the way to work
Parrish senses Joe's pleasure, his slight preening, his eyes check- ing out the good-looking women headed for the offices at the top of corporate high-rises
You know,  got to thinking last night -- with you here, and seem- ingly occupied, how's your work going - uh - elsewhere
flicker from Joe
He has heard what Parrish has said, his eyes busy with the grift and the sparkle of the Avenue, but he is concentrating on Parrish's words
When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right
What do you mean
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right
guess so
So you understand the concept then
When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere
Of course
So you've grasped the idea
Con- gratulations
Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what am talking about
Parrish falls silent, chewing over Joe's admonition
Joe --
Yes, Bill
How about giving a guy a break
Make an exception
There's one to every rule
Not this
They stride on, cutting through the crowd, Joe all at home in his new surrounding, but Parrish just the opposite, un- characteristically uncomfortable, phrases forming on his lips but unspoken, then suddenly he blurts out: --  don't deserve this
'm still young, this is not my time -- That's what everybody says
'm not everybody
That's what everybody says
Parrish is trying to control himself, glances at Joe
want to live
understand
moment
(cont'd) But you can't
sudden silence between them
Parrish's shoulders appear to have stopped slightly, the courage he displayed at rais- ing these issues has vanished
What's it like
What do you mean
What's it like where 'm going
Can you keep a secret
Yes
So can
They turn into Parrish's office building
,   - As Parrish and Joe enter, Parrish is hailed by , the Elevator Starter
Good morning, Mr
Parrish
Good morning, Jaime
Knight's Reward in the 4th at Calder -- bemused Parrish walks on, Joe beside him, Jaime pursuing them
(cont'd) --  closer in today with cheap speed
The colt will come from the clouds and boom
Fifty-eight dollar horse
get you down, Mr
Parrish, just say the word
(smiles) 'm sorry, not today, Jaime
Parrish and Joe arrive at the bank of elevators
Jaime, back at his post, hits a button
(cont'd) (to Joe) You know, everyday 've walked into this building, Jaime gives me a horse
(a moment) wonder if any of them won
The elevator materializes, Parrish and Joe step on
,     - Parrish and Joe emerge from the executive elevator, Jennifer is waiting as usual with her pad, "Good morning"s, etc
As Parrish strides down the hall, Joe right beside him, he passes instructions back to Jennifer who, scribbling, hurries along behind them
-- And call my family, 'd like them to come over for dinner tonight
Didn't the family get together last night --
(remonstrating, gently) Jennifer
Of course, Mr
Parrish
Right away
Jennifer wheels and heads right back to the office as Parrish arrives at the door to the Board Room
(to Joe) Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --
No
What 'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board
'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem
Parrish hesitates, nods, conceding the point, reaches for the doorknob
,   - Parrish enters, Joe following right behind him
euphony of "Good morning"'s from the various members of the Board, including Quince
Everyone sits when Parrish does but Joe, right at home, spots a tray of refreshments: coffee, pas- tries, he heads for them
(to the Board) -- This is Joe Black, a personal associate of mine - uh - he'll be joining us today
know it's -- uh -- unusual, and my apologies -- and Drew -- uh -- carry on
Immediately indications of surprise on Board members' faces at Parrish bringing in an 'observer', Drew's reaction guarded but intense
(after a moment, to Joe) Nice to see you
didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing
Thank you
(to the Board) The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order
Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and -- (to Drew) Do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies
hushed silence at the inappropriateness of Joe's inter- ruption
(cont'd) And a cup of tea
With milk, think
'd like to try it English- style
Yes, a cup of tea with milk
Anything else, Mr
Black
How about some water
Why yes, thank you
Hot or cold
Cold
And a glass
Drew indicates to the Board's Stenographer to arrange Joe's refreshments
(quietly, indicating a chair) Would you like to sit down, Joe
Yes
Joe sits
To review -- we're really crossing the 't's and dotting the 'i's here
Bill had a great and conclusive meeting with John Bontecou yester- day, all that remains for us is to put it to a vote
Smiles and murmurs of a congratulatory receptiveness from the Board at Drew's news
(emptily) Thank you, Drew
Parrish takes a moment, draws himself up to say something official then stops himself, what follows is spontaneous, reflective, deeply felt
(cont'd) Umm --  did enjoy -- or rather was interested in meeting John yes- terday -- impressive
suppose
But it did get me to thinking started in this business because this is what  wanted to do
knew wasn't going to write the Great American Novel, but  also knew there was more to life than buying something for a dollar and selling it for two
wanted to give the news to the world, and  wanted to give it unvarnished
The more we all know about each other, the greater the chance we will survive
Sure,  want to make a profit, you can't exist without one but John Bontecou is all profit
If we give him license to absorb Parrish Communications, and he has his eye on a few others after us, we'll be appointing him to the position he craves -- Gatekeeper
In order to reach the world you will have to go through John Bontecou
And not only will you have to pay him to do this, far more expensive, you'll have to agree with him
Reporting the news is a privilege and a responsibility and it is not exploitable
Parrish Communications has earned this priv- ilege, John Bontecou wants to buy it
As your chairman,  urge you to agree this company is not for sale
silence, everybody shifts, the Board is in shock, Drew is trying to maintain his balance
(carefully) Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion
(to the Board) Sorry
know it looks like 'm reversing my field
That's your privilege, Bill
But given our needs, given the absolute necessity for growth, given the fu- ture, the truth is
joining John Bontecou is every bit as certain as - Death and Taxes
Joe interjects: 'Death and Taxes'
After a moment
Yes
"Death and Taxes"
Another moment
Yes
What an odd pairing
It's just a saying, Mr
Black, Of whom
It doesn't matter
Then why did you bring it up
Drew regards Joe
You're not familiar with the phrase, "In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes"
am now
Glad  could be of some help
The Board is provoked and mystified by Joe and even more by his presence, they cast meaningful glances at Parrish, Drew coolly grasps the irritation of the members
Parrish breaks the silence
Shall we adjourn
But the matter's still on the table, Bill -- , a contemporary of Parrish's, has been warily silent, but extremely observant
Protective of Parrish, and sensing his burgeoning difficulty, he interrupts: Why don't we let it rest for the moment
Give it some air
Well said, Eddie
Mr
Black, shall we
Joe rises
(to Drew) Those cookies were excellent
He exits with Parrish, the door closes behind them of disturbed reactions from the Board
Who is that guy
Drew grabs a telephone: (cont'd) Felicia
(
) Yes, sir
Get me a Field Background check on Joe Black
Litigations
Bankrupt- cies
Credit ratings
The works
Got it
Drew hangs up
'  - Parrish enters, Joe right on his heels
They booth stop, Parrish regards him
-- What's the deal here
Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end
don't understand
Parrish tries to gather himself
'd like to be alone for a while
Are you sad, Bill
Yes,  am
There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor
Why don't you go down and read some magazines
You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill
Joe, could  ask you to take a walk
Buy a tie or something
know 'll be seeing you
Of course
But Joe doesn't move
(prompting) Now 'd like to be alone
Oh
Okay
Parrish reaches into his pocket and hands Joe some cash
Here -- this will hold you for a while
Joe stares at the money as Parrish shows him the door
(cont'd) You know about money, don't you
It can't buy happiness
Parrish opens the door
Jennifer, give Mr
Black a map of the city
No thank you, Bill
can manage
Joe goes
,    - Susan is busy giving instructions to a Nurse, a patient on an examining table beside them
As she finishes, she suddenly notices Joe down the corridor in the reception area
She is startled for the moment, quickly makes a last notation, hands a chart to the Nurse and heads down the corridor
Joe -- How nice you look
Is that your uniform
Susan regards him
Why did you come here
Joe doesn't have an answer
(cont'd) Are you ill
Oh goodness, no
Then why are you here, Joe
came to see you
don't have any time to see you now
'm doing grand rounds and then 'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then -- Very well, 'll watch
Watch me do what
Whatever you do
That's impossible
'm a doctor, 'm -- And 'll be a visitor
Patients have visitors, not doctors
don't mind -- Visible now behind them are a Caribbean woman in her mid- thirties, , an arm around her mother, , who is holding her stomach and rocking back and forth in her seat, in great pain
(urgently) Miss
Miss Doctor
(gently) Just a minute, please
Please
My momma's sicker'n he is
Easter looks up and sees Joe
She abruptly becomes still, eyes wide, as if sudden recognition
Obeah
No, Momma
But Easter just stares at Joe, fearful
Obeah mon
gonna die
Momma, stop it
Is just a man
Joe looks at Easter, curiously
(to Teena) What's obeah
Bad spirit
She just all fever, she don' mean nothin'
Please help us
Have you filled out the insurance forms
Teena shakes her hand anxiously
Joe leans forward to Easter and speaks softly in perfect, lilting West Indian dialect
No obeah, sister
No duppy, no jumbie
Evera ting gon' be irey
Susan and Teena both look at him, astonished
Easter's fearful gaze remains locked on him
(cont'd) Go wi' de doctor lady
Momma be fine
Don' leave
(pleading) Momma
Susan leads Teena away
Easter is riveted on Joe
(with certainty) Obeah
Obeah evil
not evil
What you then
from dat nex' place
You wait here'n to take us
Like you bus driver to dere
(smiles) No, no
on holiday
(looks around, dubious) Some spot you pick
She winces with pain, gasping
(cont'd) Pain is bad
nuttin' to do wi' dat
Make it go 'way
Doctor lady make it irey
Not dis pain
Dis pain tru an' tru
Make it go 'way
Can't, sistah
(adamant, pleading) Can, mistah
Take me to dat nex' place
Joe regards Easter, a long moment
Not time yet
Make it time
Joe shakes his head, a firm no
But when he looks and speaks to Easter again, it is with concern and even regret
Can't feel wi' de way tings gotta be, Easter
Susan and Teena return with an Orderly and a wheelchair for Easter
(to Joe) Please
Come now, Momma
Easter is helped into the wheelchair
She looks pleadingly at Joe
The Orderly starts to wheel her away
Joe stays him, putting his hand on Easter's arm
Close your eyes, Easter
She does, her pained grimace melts into a peaceful smile
(cont'd) Soon
He takes his hand away, and the Orderly wheels Easter off
(to Teena) Go with her
'll be right there
Teena goes
Joe remains his normal voice
She's in a great deal of pain
Yes
Susan regards Joe, puzzled
(cont'd) Have you spent a lot of time in the islands
Some
Joe shifts
(cont'd) - uh -  - realize now - uh - my being here - um - your patient -- this is not really appropriate -- and  - uh -- Don't apologize
There's nothing to be sorry for -- every hospital should have someone like you
Silence
(cont'd) Well
'm glad you came
Thank you
'm so very glad to be here
Another awkward silence
(cont'd) guess you're busy -- Yes
She doesn't move, they search for words
Well,  could come again some other time
Susan regards him
Joe, 'm with Drew
(sincerely) Not now
Susan smiles gently
(cont'd) Don't you want me to come again
moment
have to go, 'm sorry to say -- Be sorry for nothing
Another moment
Yes
Well
thank you, Joe
Susan turns to go, hesitates
Good-bye, Susan
Susan waves softly to him, heads down the hall, glances back once to see Joe has not moved, is watching her depart
'  - Jennifer shows Joe in, Parrish is deep in thought, beside him a meal laid out beautifully on his desk with linen and silver, but untouched
Joe is more abstracted than usual, he is starting at Parrish's food
Are you going to eat your lunch It's all yours
Joe starts eating, Parrish watches him, somewhat fascinated, Joe's chewing has improved
(cont'd) Good
Excellent
What is it
Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro little Coleman's mustard
Joe takes another big bite
Truly - uh - splendid
Glad you like it
My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches
Joan -- that was my wife -- (familiarly) Uh-huh
Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken
She knew stuff like that
Silence, Parrish getting lost in his memories
(cont'd) -- Everything reminds me of her -- there isn't a day that goes by that don't think about her -- One day she was here
The next day she was gone
What are you going to do
-- guess you've heard all this a trillion times before
And more
Why didn't you stop me
Well
don't know
Silence
(cont'd) How was it the first time you met her
thought you'd heard a trillion times -- This part 'm interested in
moment
She had on this little blue suit -- with a little white collar that had little red piping on it -- Joe is riveted on Parrish ow, Parrish aware of him, has paused
(cont'd) You could have put her under glass and  would have just stood and looked at her
But when she spoke --  loved the sound of her voice and her laugh -- (a moment) --  couldn't get enough of her -- and gradually -- or maybe it wasn't gradually --  realized  couldn't live without her
, the door opens and Drew enters, looks at Parrish, then at Joe, stands poised in the doorway
May  interrupting
Yes
No
(to joe) 'Just kidding'
Sit down, Drew
Before  do -- (glances at Joe) was hoping we might be alone, Bill
Joe and  have no secrets from each other
(to Joe) How nice for you both
Drew takes a moment, then plunges in
(cont'd) Bill, pardon my candor, but  was confounded by your decision this morning
Why
was hired, you told me, to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century
This merger is the vehicle -- Joe interrupts: Perhaps a merger is a way to bring Bill's company into the 21st cen- tury
And perhaps it isn't
And perhaps cheating on your French Philosophers exam at The Groton School was an expedient way to get your diploma, and perhaps it wasn't
Be that as it may, Drew, a question can often be argued both ways
Drew is stunned
Joe, cut it out
And you too, Drew
(to Parrish) thought this was practically a done deal -- Well now it's undone, okay
Forget Bontecou
Scrub him
'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer
'm not going for it
moment
Okay
Drew heads for the door, turns around
(cont'd) (to Parrish) Can  invite myself to dinner tonight
(a moment) Susan and  had ticket for the Knicks game
But she said you guys were getting together -- Dinner
Absolutely
Absolutely
(to Joe) Damn decent of you
Drew exits
Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters
don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be man wants to leave something behind
And he wants it left behind the way he made it
And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth
Okay
Okay
And  don't need your goddamn permis- sion either
You
Drew
don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life
Easy, Bill
You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation
,  ,    - The skyline glitters through the terrace windows
The hour is before dinner, Coyle and Luisa weave seamlessly among the family, offering hors d'oeuvres and drinks on a tray
Allison and Susan together by a piano; Parrish, Quince and a distracted Joe are gathered near the terrace
Joe's eyes are on Susan across the room
Her eyes flicker towards him, aware of his gaze
(to Susan) We're never all together two nights in a row
Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it
What's going on
Nothing's going on
Maybe he doesn't want to be alone
He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute -- don't know, Daddy seems funny to me
Ever since Joe showed
It's like he dropped from the clouds
Drew enters
He nuzzles Susan's neck, out of the corner of her eye she sees Joe still observing them
(cont'd) When Daddy walked in with him, he couldn't even remember his name
Now he's his house guest
And you know how he hates house guests
What is going on
Drew, whose eyes have also been on Joe across the room, turns back
(to Susan and Allison) Good question
Allison sees Susan's eyes flicker over towards Joe
-- But he does seem very nice
You think so
Over at the terrace, Quince buttonholes Parrish, Joe stand- ing by
(to Parrish) read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and  know where you're coming from
And 'm with you a hundred and one percent
Thank you, Quince
But 've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, 've got some great prospects 've developed
want to talk to you about them next week
Next week
Yeah
Or the week after
Quince sees Parrish hesitate
(cont'd) No good
No, anything is possible
(lightly) It's up to Joe
Joe, you don't know how glad  am you're aboard
Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, 'm in his corner
That's very gracious of you, Quince
No problem
'll leave you two alone
can tell you guys have something on the fire -- An excited Quince drains his drink and heads for Drew as Allison appears
(to Parrish) Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming
Who
From the Korean War
Conflict, honey
Korean Conflict
Whatever it was, they'll be here
We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the 's are amazing
few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course -- Of course
(a moment) You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not
like it
like it
'm sorry don't seem more appreciative
(resignedly) That's okay, Daddy
Across the room, Quince has pulled Drew aside: know you're down, but you know when you're down, Drew, there's no place to go but up
Thanks, Quince
Never mind Bontecou
've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and 'm putting them to see old man
Are you
We'll do it together
'll clue you in
Timing's got to be right
The old man says it's up to Joe
'It's up to Joe'
Those were his words
Yeah
'It's up to Joe', huh
Yeah, that's what he said
Well, that's very interesting
Drew gazes intently over at Joe who is crossing to Susan, for the moment by herself near the piano
thought so, too
Joe's a neat guy
Yeah
Neat
Joe approaches Susan
wanted to apologize, Susan -- thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'
Well, now  am sorry
For intruding on you this afternoon
It wasn't an intrusion
And if it was, it turned out to be welcome
appreciate you -- Excuse me
mean  appreciate that
And  appreciate you, too
moment between them
(delighted) You do
Well, thank you very much
Drew crosses over to Parrish
was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew
Forgive me
want you to know  value your advice
As much as Joe's
Parrish doesn't answer
(cont'd) Who is this man
He's giving ubiquitous a bad name
moment
You're competitive soul, Drew
That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money
Joe is just
around
For how long
And why
Please
Don't worry about him
And above all, don't antagonize him
Drew glances over at Joe
Boss's orders, huh
'm great at following them
And  think 'll start right now
Allison calls out from the other side of the room: Dinner's ready, everybody
as Coyle opens the doors to the dining room and the family files in, Drew lingering behind with Joe
have a confession to make to you, Joe
Joe just smiles in response
(cont'd) Do you want to hear it
(pleasantly) No
Well, 'm going to tell you anyway
did cheat on that exam at Groton
But so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today
And 'm expecting you won't mention it again
don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but 'm willing to pretend  did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones
But can  tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him
What are you, his shadow
Do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak
You know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with
That means without you
Okay, pal
Let's eat
,   - Everyone eating silently but looks are exchanged, glances averted, Allison notices Susan and Joe looking at each other, Drew observes Parrish watching Joe, Quince, on the other hand, just eats
Breaking the silence, Parrish chinks his glass, stands
--  - uh - want to thank you all for coming - uh - my family -- Everyone at the table is all attention
(cont'd) -- Allison and Quince, Susan -- and the other members -- He glances at Joe, stops
(cont'd) -- 'm so happy when we can get together --  mean  know you all have busy lives -- Look who's talking
(a laugh) Yeah, speak for yourself
Anyway --  remember when you were little girls -- An awkward pause
Quince chooses to fill the silence
love little girls -- Allison elbows him
And now you're all grown up -- and 'm - uh - um -- Parrish struggles to keep his emotions in check, Drew clocking his behavior very carefully
(cont'd) had some words all prepared but now 've forgotten them - uh - um - wait a minute
Silence, everyone waiting for Parrish to proceed
(cont'd) Uh, it's gone
um -- it was on the tip of my tongue
It'll come back, Daddy
Will it
Parrish looking around, searching for words he will not find
(cont'd) Anyway, 'd like to go on but
He hesitates, drifts into silence
(tentatively) Daddy, you could sit down if you wanted to
moment
There is so much  would like to say -- but  can't -- (another moment) So  better sit down
Carry on, everybody
He sits, then immediately stands up again
(cont'd) One other thing -- why don't we all have dinner again tomorrow night
Dinner
Again
Haven't you had enough of us, Dad
(with great sincerity) No
The word lands with effect, Susan and Allison have heard it well
We'll be here
You bet
With bells on
The guests try to return to their food, Susan is the most concerned about Parrish's lapse, she does not say anything but Drew next to her senses her empathy and, in something of a display, gives her a pro forma hug
Joe has observed every instant of Drew's performance, his anxiety is palpable when Coyle leans over to serve him, offering a tray of a roast that has been carved
(to Coyle) would prefer some peanut butter
How would you like that, sir
On some kind of toast
Toast
No
just the butter
Right away
Coyle heads for the kitchen
Why do you love peanut butter so much
(intimately) don't know
adore things like that
food can't do without
Don't you
Joe is locked on Susan, it is as if there is nobody else in the room
Yes
It comforts you, doesn't it
(captivated) Yes
've found that it does
Mind if  throw up
(admonishing gently) Please, Drew
(to Susan) 'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today
am, too
Has her pain abated
We're doing what we can for her
But it doesn't look good
'm sorry to hear that
Who are we talking about
(to Susan) But  know she's grateful for the care you're giving her
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it
(to Drew) Susan's patient is whom we are talking about
Joe visited the hospital today
Parrish's head swivels to Joe
Did he
That's more than we get to do
Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along
Perhaps you could remind me
'll make a note of it
Anything else
'd like to come, too
See Susan strut her stuff
You're on, Quin-cee
Destination Hospital
Joe, you'll be the Tour Guide
Okay
How's that sound to you
Silence
Parrish regards Joe, then Susan, his face reflects a sudden concern with their relationship
Susan is a wonderful doctor
,   - After dinner, the family and guests file back in from the dining room, Drew alongside Parrish
have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day
Need a few minutes to sort everything out
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow
Sure
Drew peels off, heads for the foyer and front door, Susan follows him
Parrish corners Joe
Why did you go to the hospital
don't know
You were just curious
guess
About Susan
wouldn't put it that way
What way would you put it
You tell me, Bill
How about you telling me
When ask a simple question,  expect a straight answer
That's what 'm used to
Anybody who doesn't give it to me,  fire
Are you going to fire me, Bill
Silence, Parrish is at a loss
- Drew is putting on his coat, Susan with him, a tension between them, a heavy silence finally broken
See you tomorrow night
Include me out
've had enough of the conversations
You don't mean that
You wouldn't disappoint Daddy -- Daddy'll do fine
Besides, he's got Joe
(a moment) And so do you
Drew, you're out of line
That may be
But  don't like the fucker
don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you
And vice versa
Sorry, but  like the way he looks and talks to me
And vice versa
Okay
No, not okay
thought we had a good thing going here
(a moment) It shows you never know
Silence, neither knows how to continue
Well
goodnight
Yeah
Goodnight
Drew goes, Susan turns to find out at the far end of the foyer, he's been observing them
She walks up to him
How long have you been standing there
don't like the way Drew spoken to you
But  feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back
moment
Tell me about yourself, Joe
Who you are
What you're doing with my father
Susan's directness has caught him by surprise, Joe blinks
(cont'd) So you're not going to tell me
Joe remains silent, rendered extremely anxious by Susan's inquiries
(cont'd) You're married, aren't you
Why
Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married
Joe doesn't respond
(cont'd) So you are married
No, 'm not
Girlfriend
No
Gay
No
Susan comes closer to Joe
Then tell me, Joe, how come a man as attractive, intelligent, well- spoken ,diffident in the most sed- uctive way, and yet powerful, is all alone in this world
Joe tries to respond but he can't, his stammer interrupted by Susan
(cont'd) 'm sorry,  don't want to pry and you don't want to tell me
So let's leave it a mystery
That's the way you want it, isn't it
Susan takes another step closer to Joe
Thank you,  appreciate that
They are inches apart now, the smell of each other surrounds them, a heaviness to the moment, now Joe turns to head up the stairs
Where are you going
(softly) To bed
(suddenly fragile) 'To bed'
Yes
'm tired
He excuses himself with an ineffable gesture, now climbs the stairs, Susan watches him disappear
She turns back into the salon just as Allison and Quince are exiting, "good-byes" all around
Susan is left alone now with Parrish who is fixing a drink at a sidebar
That was wonderful
Yeah, it's good to get together
Do you mind if  raise a little caution flag
Raise away
What is the nature of your interest in Joe
Well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"
The nature of it's in there somewhere
Parrish drops another cube of ice in his drink, takes his time before answering
won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground -- Then what will you say
don't think this is the lightning you are looking for
Drew's a good man
know  didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but 've come to appreciate -- Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten
What's going on
Nothing
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing
Then what is it
It's something
She kisses him
(cont'd) 'night, Daddy
See you tomorrow
This is getting interesting
She goes
: - large suite, room service carts creaking with pots of coffee and half-eaten pastries
The Board of Parrish Communications is gathered, absent are Parrish and Quince
Felicia, Drew's secretary, takes notes
know you're all as uncomfor- table as  am to be meeting without Bill, but  got a call last night from John Bontecou
Not only is he still interested, he is sweetening his offer
(a moment) Although it pains me to say it, in my opinion Bill Parrish dealt with us peremptorily in dismissing any deal with Bontecou
Therefore, 'm sorry to say that if we are to exam- ine this new offer responsibly as the Board of Directors of Parrish Communications, we must do so with- out its Chairman
(another moment) Oh yes, there is one additional element: Bontecou is so anxious to get us, he said he'd take Parrish Communications with our Chairman or without
The Board falls silent
Sloane, a peer of Parrish's, fidgets
Drew milks the moment
(cont') It's no surprise if  suggest to you that the Bill Parrish we know is not the Bill Parrish you saw yesterday
You heard that speech -- some strange emotional rationale to buttress a knee-jerk rejection of a legitimate offer
Does it not strike you that something is possibly affecting this man's judgement
More specifically -- his judgement to make a critical business decision
Silence, the Board clocking Drew's argument
(cont') It's not pleasant to say the follow- ing, but  would be remiss, in this crisis, if  did not
When we pre- sent Bill with the improved Bontecou offer, and if he refuses to let us consider it -- once more makes an adamant or emotional rejection -- we will have no choice but to seek an alternative
And what would that be
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow
There is a provisory by- law in our charter
Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five
You're taking this too far, Drew
Am  not obligated to
Drew leans over to Felicia, speaks quietly and she leaves the room
(cont'd) How did this all come about
Crisis -- Bill Parrish, crisis -- his com- pany, crisis for us
came about with the arrival on the scene of -- Mr
Joe Black
Mr
Joe who
Joe Black
He attends our Board meet- int, he sleeps at Bill's house, re- sides in his office
Never leaves his side
And, in my opinion, is always in his ear
Telling him what to do and Bill is listening
Who is Joe Black
What is his relationship to Bill Parrish
And most important, what is behind his influence on our Chairman
You're building this thing up too much, Drew
He's had advisors be- fore
Nobody tells Bill what to do
The door opens and Felicia enters followed by Quince, sur- prised at seeing a convened Board, but still he is all smiles
Thank you for coming
Hello, Quince
Hi, Ed, hi folks,  didn't know everybody was going to be here, what a nice surprise
What's the big confab
(acidly) This is a secret meeting
(to Quince) hope you'll respect its nature -- What we're trying to do here is gather our thoughts -- in light of Bill's rejection of Bontecou's offer -- and make an appropriate presenta- tion to him as to how we think the company might proceed
Won't you share with our Board the information you gave me last night
Quince hesitates, then realizes what Drew has on his mind
He nods confidently to Drew, then turns importantly to the Board
Well, 'm happy to tell you 've got good news
As  was telling Drew, 've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger
How did Bill react to the leads you've developed
He was interested
(prompting) -- But he was concerned about the timing
The timing -- yes
He says it's up to Joe
'It's up to Joe'
That's what he said
Quince, having dispensed his information, looks proudly around at the Board members
They are stunned, Sloane in shock
Drew is absolutely still, letting Quince's words sink in
,   - Parrish, Joe, Susan, Allison and Quince are seated at the table, dessert plates in front of them, coffee cups beside
Allison and Susan's eyes are on Parrish, looking for some clue as to why has he gathered the family together yet again
Parrish is somewhat within himself, but he peeks over his demi-tasse cup at Joe, Parrish aware of Joe's heightened interest in Susan, and Susan's reciprocation
Coyle enters carrying two imposing stemmed silver trays with cakes on them, Luisa follows with one other
They set them down in front of Parrish
What is this
Annie made them
Who's Annie
From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America
(pointing) This is orange, from real Seville oranges
Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful
And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in
don't like cake
It's for the party, Dad -- Oh, the goddam party -- 'Goddam party'
Allison bursts into tears
(cont'd) (to Quince) Did you hear that
Quince quickly slashes a piece, takes a huge bite
This is great, honey
The orange
Has it got a little vodka in it
Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka -- (to Parrish) Put your lips around this one, Bill
It's out of this world
No thank you, Quince
(to Allison) 'm sorry, honey
'm no good at this
Why don't you choose whatever cake you like
knew you were going to say that
Tito Puente
The old platoon
Now the cake
You just don't care
Why did  do this
should have my head examined
'm trying to throw the party for the century for my father - and you know what -- he doesn't give a shit
She bursts into tears all over again
But he does give a shit
Don't you, Bill
Yeah,  give a shit
See
There
What'd  tell you
Joe watches as Quince dabs at Allison's tears with a napkin
(cont'd) Feel better
Yeah, but -- But what
What will  tell Annie
Parrish forks a bit of a cake
This one
The vodka
What'd  tell you
Quince puts a reassuring arm around Allison, she seems to relax now, Joe has been a keen observer of what has trans- pired between husband and wife, between man and woman, a sense that he has taken in the virtue of such a relation- ship
,   - After dinner, Parrish, Allison and Susan are gathered to- gether
At the bar on the other side of the room, Joe watches as Quince pours himself a stiff hooker of brandy
(to Quince) Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males
didn't know that
On the other hand, Winston Churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety-one
After a moment
You're an original, Joe
little hard to figure, maybe
And you're a nice man, Quince
Thanks
You're welcome
Drew appears unannounced in the doorway, exchanges a tense glance with Susan, then heads straight for Parrish who seems surprised to see him
(to Parrish) Sorry to intrude, Bill, but we've got a bit of a crisis downtown -- it's not something we could talk about on the phone
Parrish takes Drew aside
(cont'd) The Board's real unhappy, Pappy -- they felt you dealt with them pre- emptorily, you never gave them a chance to speak -- What is there to say
They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear
Now they want to do the same with theirs
What are their feelings
If  read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer
Over my dead body
Parrish's burgeoning anger has now gotten the attention of Joe, Susan, Quince and Allison
What do you think the Board is going to say when  tell them that
don't care
With all due respect, you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again, there'll be blood on the floor
Silence, Parrish carefully calibrating Drew's remark
Whose
Yours
'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me
'm just giving you the truth
There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth
Joe, although across the room, is all attention
think it's time you went home, Drew
Certainly
Goodnight
Drew goes, everybody is in shock, Susan pursues him out into the hallway
Drew
He stops
(cont'd) Never talk to my father like that again
Don't worry about it
There's a beginning and a middle and an end to everything
And  think 've come to the end of my chapter with the Parrishes
Joe has followed them into the hallway
(cont'd) And the end began with this guy
Drew looks down towards Joe
(cont'd) Mr
Black --
We ran a check on you and you know what we came up with
No,  don't -- Not good, not bad, you know what we got
Nothing
No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives
Nothing
Joe waits
(cont'd) All of a sudden a guy appears on the scene with the Chairman of one of the greatest communications corpora- tions of the world, the boss makes him privy to all the company's secrets, he attends the Board meet- ings, and us working stiffs with 's up the ass and years and years and years of experience, we're left outside with our noses pressed against the window
Joe doesn't respond
(cont'd) This is a big-time operation, deal- ing in big-time issues, demanding big-time executives who make big- time decisions
So, Joe, why don't you tell me exactly what it is that's big time about you
After a moment
You first
(to Drew) Why don't you get off his case
Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now
Are we going to go to court
Or are we going to go to bed
And don't mean you and me
mean you and him
That's it
It's over
Get out
So  guess a blowjob's out of the question
Joe clears his throat
(cont'd) Did you say something
Joe considers him evenly
Almost
(to Drew) said get out
Now Drew wheels, heads right for the front door and exits with a
What an angry fellow
moment passes before Susan realizes she and Joe are alone, and Joe does as well
'm sorry about -- Please
We don't need to talk about Drew
She regards Joe
No
We don't
They drift, osmotically, into the library in awkward silence
(cont'd) Brave you had a chance to look at Dad's rare books
Jefferson's Parliamentary Manual, a first edition Bleak House -- Joe comes closer, takes a deep breath
love your smell
--  guess you haven't
Now Susan, close to Joe, leans closer, her nose in Joe's neck
Joe holds himself very still
(cont'd) like your smell, too
Thank you
It was everything
Silence, the  of the clock
(cont'd) When  was little, my mother used to say, "Darling, you could set your heart by this clock"
-- Could you
Never tried, 'til now
(suddenly) Joe, may  kiss you
Why, yes
Thank you
moment
You're welcome
Susan reaches out for Joe, they kiss, he is awkward but his very awkwardness endearing
Susan pulls him closer, they linger now, mouths on each other's, then separate
(cont'd) Thank you
You're welcome
The clock  on
sense of foreboding falls over Joe's face, his fear that he is passing through some barrier, a point of no return
Joe
The apprehensive expression on Joe's face fades away
Yes
don't know who you are
Well
'm -- uh, Joe
And you're Susan
And  - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees -- And is your heart beating strangely
Faster
And  want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me -- forever
An intake of breath
She is about to speak
(cont'd) And you don't even have to say a word
Their faces inches from each other's
have to go home
But neither Susan nor Joe moves
(cont'd) Don't
Her question makes Joe, almost involuntarily, smile
Susan takes the opportunity to step back from him
The  of someone at the door, it is Parrish, Susan turns, comprehends immediately how the situation will appear to him
Goodnight, Daddy
She drifts right past him, exits
Joe and Parrish are left alone now, eyes on each other's
Hello, Bill
(carefully) Hello
Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap
Um -- not right now
An awkward moment
Okay
Goodnight
Goodnight
Parrish turns and exits, Joe's head inclines, he breathes in the scent of his collar
: ,   - Parrish, followed by Joe, emerges from his private elevator, is greeted as usual: Good morning, Mr
Parrish
Good morning, Jennifer
The Board is waiting
What
Didn't you call a Board meeting
Jennifer sees Parrish is trying to right his balance, she knows better than to press the point
(cont'd) Yes, the members are waiting
They are in the Board room now
Jennifer nods respectfully as Parrish doesn't cast a flicker of any further surprise, heads straight for the Board room, Joe right beside him
,   - Parrish and Joe enter, the entire Board is assembled, includ- ing Drew, Quince and Sloane
Good morning
An odd mixture of responses, the Board sheepish and at the same time looking their most dutiful at this odd meeting, its sudden convening clearly a problem for Parrish, a prob- lem which he does not attempt to hide, only control
Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill
don't think so
Do you
Drew gets the message, at the same time Joe is checking out all the attendees, his eyes come to rest on Drew
(to Parrish) To get to the point, we have re- ceived new information from John Bontecou concerning his desires for this company to merge with his, and we wanted to set the details before you
moment as Parrish looks around, the moment extends, it appears he may not ever answer
That's it
Bontecou wants a quick response and -- The answer is no, quick enough for you
Don't you want to hear the details
'm not interested in the details
And 'm not interested in the big picture either
What  am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and am expected to clap for it like a performing seal
No, thank you
So  am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer
Yes, you are to understand that, and now may  ask you a question
Certainly, Bill
Are you running this Board or am
Sloane leans in
We're not getting anywhere here
Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week -- Bontecou wants a speedier response than that
He'll wait -- Doesn't need to
Today, tomorrow, a week from now -- 'a week from now', who can think about a week from now -- the answer is going to be the same -- a loud, unmistakable, all-inclusive, airtight -- 'No'
amongst the Board, they finally rustle into silence under Parrish's withering glance
(cont'd) That's it
've got a busy day and this meeting has already set me behind
Shall we adjourn
Before we do, while we're here, there is a second question the Board would like a response to, a far simpler one
Parrish waits
(cont'd) Who is the man sitting to the right of you
Everybody's eyes are on Joe
've already introduced Mr
Black to you all
But who is he
What are his creden- tials
What is his relationship to you
No response from Parrish
(cont'd) The feeling of the Board is this: we fear Mr
Black is not only influenc- ing your decisions in regard to this company, but that you are relying on him to make them for you
Quince flinches at these words, his hands clasped in front of him, his knuckles white as Parrish regards Drew, but still does not answer
(cont'd) The lack of response, Bill, is not appropriate
We are your Board, we have a right to know how you are managing the operations of this company, and most importantly, that you have not delegated someone to do it for you
Parrish squirms, desperately uncomfortable but still does not speak
(cont'd) Okay, one more time
Drew regards Joe
(cont'd) Who is Joe Black
Parrish stares stoically into the middle distance as Quince's head sinks into his hands
(cont'd) (to the Board) motion has been brought before the Board to invoke Article 19 of the corporate charter
In English, please
Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday
Parrish is expressionless
(cont'd) At which time, the Chairman will be named Emeritus, he will be welcome to attend all meetings, and will serve as International Spokesman for the corporation plus, of course, a settlement, a golden parachute of such magnitude that his feet will never touch the ground
Drew pauses
(cont'd) Please indicate your vote by a "Yes" or "No"
"Yes" is heard, now another "Yes", now more "Yes"es, all reluctant, "No" from Sloane, "No" from Quince who realizes he is the instrument of Parrish's dismissal
(cont'd) The motion is passed
We will of course delay the announcement, out of respect for our former Chairman, until after the celebration of his birthday this weekend
Thank you for allowing me to save face, Drew
Joe's eyes are riveted on Drew
(to the Board) The other motion before us is the acceptance of John Bontecou's offer to merge this corporation with Bontecou International -- Parrish stands, Drew stops speaking
Joe
Silence, then Joe rises
(to the Board) Who  am, and my relationship to Bill, will be divulged in our own good time
Joe follows Parrish out of the room
,    - Sloane has pursued Parrish and Joe
(to Parrish) It's not over, 'til it's over
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit
still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around
You'll be up in the country
Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday
You're an honored guest, Eddie
'm going to stick it out here
We still have a shot
The elevator door opens, Parrish and Joe step inside and the door closes, leaving Sloane behind
,   - The Board meeting has broken up, clusters of members have lingered, exchanging post-mortems
And enraged Quince has cornered Drew, out of earshot of the others
What have you done
You've gotten the old man fired
That we did
Thanks to you
He was wobbling, mind you, but you stupid the coup de grace
Quince falls silent, aquiver with this reality
'm going to put a stop to this
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs
But  didn't mean to do it
The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard
Would you like to hear the silver lining
Check that, gold
've been working with John Bontecou all along
We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder
set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park
Quince is struck dumb
(cont'd) Don't you know what this'll mean
You'll be rich
You'll sell your stock, you can stop kissing ass -- What'll it feel like to be a man
don't want to get rich this way -- 'm going to expose you
Go right ahead
Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting
And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company
Quince goes ashen
(cont'd) It's just life, Quin-cee
Drew hails an employee across the hall
(cont'd) (to Quince) Wake up and smell the thorns
Drew joins the employee as Quince slumps against the wall
,   - Parrish enters, Joe right behind him, Coyle takes their coats, disappears
Parrish hesitates for a moment, shrugs as if he has a thought he doesn't want to share, then heads upstairs with Joe
He is trudging a bit, Joe senses his mood
'm sorry, Bill -- That's okay
What's okay
Just a manner of speaking
Joe seems puzzled
(cont'd) What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over
We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe
'Fish'
Never mind
'm tired
'm going to take a nap
moment
(cont'd) Are you hungry
Coyle will have Luisa fix you something to eat
'm not hungry
Then  can't help you
Parrish turns into his bedroom, closing the door gently behind him
Joe continues down the hall, enters the guest wing
,   - Midday sunlight streams into the sitting room, Joe passes through to his bedroom, sits tentatively on the bed, feels the edge of the silk spread, touches the pillow, then rises again, crosses back to the sitting room
Susan appears in the doorway, Joe suddenly senses her, turns around
You're here
am
He stands, they regard each other for the moment
(cont'd) May  take your coat
She doesn't answer, starts to take off the coat herself, Joe comes around her to help, Susan senses him breathing in the scent at the back of her neck
just thought 'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch,  was in the neigh- borhood -- How beautiful
He starts to hang Susan's coat up
Just throw it on the chair
Joe holds her coat carefully on the chair
An awkward moment, the two of them shifting from foot-to-foot
(cont'd) When  called, they said that you and Daddy had just left the office
He's taking a nap
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing -- Yes, he's tired
believe so
moment
(cont'd) You must be hungry
Susan sits on the couch
No, not anymore
Are you
Joe hears the question but doesn't answer, sits down on the couch beside her
(cont'd) (after a moment) Are you cold
No
Maybe it's the draft through the door
She gets up, closes the door, sits back down again next to Joe
warm, awkward silence, they move closer to each other, now they fall into a foreplay which Susan recognizes as such, Joe, on the other hand, participates hungrily but has no knowledge where it is leading
His movements are instinctive, the smell of her hair, the shape of her fin- gers, odd things about her seem to interest him
This excites her because she senses his untutoredness and the very sense of that stirs her, their reactions to each other are intuitive and spontaneous; even though Joe has no know- ledge of how to make love to a woman, ironically his actions are such that they never beg the question -- has he done it before
Strange territory for Joe, not to be 'in control' and exert- ing his power, but his inventions and responses in lovemak- ing are so real that an emotional exchange between he and Susan builds
Joe has found himself in an unexplored land of feeling and passion, he loves what is happening and yet at the same time, is terrified by it
He feels himself being lured by some power he has not only never been aware of, but is deeply dangerous to partake of; he knows what he is doing is putting who he is at great risk, yet he goes right on
The powerful contradiction is transmitted to Susan, and in the end there is the knowledge they have together made a journey, they both have been swept away in a stream of events they have created; and they don't care about the consequences
Spent, they lie in silence
Finally Susan speaks: It's so wonderful to make love to you
It's like making love to some- one who has never made love before
Joe senses an opportunity not only to admit to what she has said, but to tell her more, even the truth about himself
He weighs, then resists, the impulse
Thank you
Her head nestles underneath his arm, she has a sense of his comforting her without knowing that he is doing so
Did you like making love to me
loved it
More than you love peanut butter
Yes
She laughs at the earnestness with which he answers
Joe seems to drift away now, they lie together as one but for the first time, she feels separate from him, sensing him gone to some distant, distant land
Where are you going
Nowhere
'm
here
For how long
Oh,  hope a long, long time
moment
Me, too
Another moment
What do we do now
She smiles
It will come to us
,   () - Joe and Susan are at the front door, he has helped her on with her coat, she turns around, they kiss
The kiss lingers, Susan breaks away, reaches for the door, looks back longingly at Joe and then she is gone, Joe closing the door softly after her
He turns back into the foyer, looks up, Parrish is on the balcony, it is clear he has observed Joe and Susan
Hello, Bill
Parrish, in a state of shock, doesn't answer for a moment
(cont'd) Did you have a nice nap
couldn't sleep
'm sorry to hear that
He starts up the stairs
No, 'll come down Joe waits guardedly at the bottom of the stairs as Parrish descends
(cont'd) What's going on
Joe senses Parrish's tone, doesn't answer
(cont'd) saw you kiss Susan
Yes,  saw you see me
Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman
'll be the judge of that
'm her father
With all due respect, Bill, 'm not asking your permission
Well, you goddam well should
You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter
'Spooning'
Yes, and stop repeating everything sai, and turning it into a question
Spooning, fooling around, God knows what
You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me,  still don't under- stand -- picked you for your verve, your excellence, and for your ability to - how shall  say - instruct
You've lived a first-rate life
And  find it eminently usable
Parrish measures Joe
What do you want
Joe doesn't answer, riveted now on Parrish
(cont'd) Everybody wants something, Joe
You've been taking me from pillar to post here
thought  knew who you were, and it wasn't a whole lot of fun, however it was almost bear- able
Now 'm getting something else from you, something very, very strange -- what is it that you want, Joe
'm only following the Parrish bywords
Looking for that 'ounce of excitement', that 'whisper of a thrill' -- What there is no sense living your life without
You know what  mean, Bill
Parrish's jaw sets
You're violating the laws of the universe
This universe
Any universe that exists or ever existed
You may be the pro, Joe
But  know who you are
And you're all fucked up
don't like your tone, and  don't like your references
And  don't give a shit
May  remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me
So watch it
Bill
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch
told you, 'watch it'
Silence
Now Joe turns on his heel, heads right out the front door
Parrish is left solitary, confounded, staring at the closed door
,    - Joe walks down a hallway, a bouquet of flowers in hand, looks around the usual feverish activity, he seems lost for the moment, but a Receptionist catches his eye
Can  help you
Dr
Parrish
She comes on at 6
Oh
He looks at the flowers, regards them for a moment, then heads for an elevator
' ,    - Easter is sitting up in bed, hooked up to an  and moni- tors
She glances over at the doorway, Joe is standing there, observing her
An awkward silence, he looks at his flowers again, now sets them respectfully on Easter's bedstand
Mistah Bad News
'Bout time you show up
Joe speaks to her in the dialect
Don' be facety, woman
None facety, mistah
You come for me
Dat's good news
No,  come to see Doctor
Doctor
What could be wrong wit' you
Nuthin'
Silence, then Easter smiles
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady
Yes
My Doctor Lady
Mine, too
She thinks about this for the moment, Joe grows uncomfort- able
You in love
Joe seems slightly tormented by the question, Easter senses him trying to frame a respect
Yah
You loved back
am
She knows you real self
She knows how she feel
(scoffing) Rass
(irritably) Don' need you okayin'
Schoolboy tings is you head
Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting
Brung you flowers and all  gettin's facety back
(stubbornly) Only flowers  wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty
Can do no right by people
Come to take, you wan' to stay, leave you stay, you wan' to go
Rahtid
Silence, Easter waits, watching Joe
You not in you right place, mistah
Easter's response stops Joe cold, he looks away and then back at her, she had clearly reached him
(cont'd) ain' either
No more
You come wi' me now
Take me
But  not lonely here
Somebody want me here
Easter considers Joe, she smiles sympathetically
It nice it happen to you
It like you came to Cat Island and you had a holiday, sun didn't burn you red, just brown, sleep no mosquito eat you, rum no poung you head nex' day
But trut' is, dat bound to happen, you stay long enough
So tak dat nice picture home wi' you, but don' be fooled
We lonely here mostly, too
If we lucky, we got some nice pictures
Easter drifts into silence, her eyes and Joe's meet, a sense they understand each other
Easter shifts, trying hard to ease her discomfort
(gently) Got enough nice pictured, Easter
She looks at him and nods gratefully and closes her eyes
Joe watches her, now his eyes close
Easter exhales raspingly, falls still
The monitors flatline
beeping alarm sound somewhere down the hall
Joe opens his eyes, takes a deep breath, he seems troubled
(cont'd) 'bye, sistah
She slips out of the room
,   - Parrish is playing solitaire
The  of the front door closing,  crossing the foyer, he looks up, at the foyer door is Susan
Hello, honey
He starts to get up, she motions to him to stay, looks around now
Where's Joe
Joe
silence
(cont'd) Joe's not around
Where is he
don't know
Susan seems distracted
(cont'd) Why are you looking for Joe
Because  was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe
don't understand
Love
Passion
Obsession, all those things you told me to wait for
Well, they've arrived
Parrish blinks, stares down at his cards
This is crazy -- Why
man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him,  sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me
You don't know anything about Joe -- What are you afraid of, Dad
That 'll fall head over heels for Joe -- well,  have -- as you did with Mom
(a moment) That's always been standard, whether you like or not
Parrish tries to get hold of himself, changes gear now
Susan,  don't think Joe is going to be with us long
Where's he going
don't know,  can't say -- 'mon
The guy's working with you
You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works -- In this case,  can't
- uh -- just can't help you
only would tell you -- that with Joe, you are on very, very dangerous ground
Susan doesn't answer for a moment
love him
don't care if you love him
'm telling you he's no good for you
moment
Of course not, Daddy
'm sorry
There is something in Susan's tone that lets him know not a word has sunk in
Parrish slumps
(cont'd) love you, too
She kisses Parrish, rearranges one of his ranks of cards, shuffles through the deck, turns over the top card, lays down a card Parrish needs
(cont'd) Lightning does strike
Parrish watches as Susan turns, disappears out the door
,    - Joe walking disconcertedly up the street, bumping shoulders with the rush hour crowd, trapped in the life of the city, he peers intently at faces, cars, into store windows
He stops now at the window of a Korean grocery, something has caught his eye, he steps inside
Through the window, Joe can be seen making a purchase, he hands the Korean Clerk some money, walks out
Joe, back on the street now, unscrews the top of a jar of peanut butter, dips a wad out with his fingers
The Korean Clerk runs out after him
Change
Change
Joe stops, uncomprehending
The Clerk hands Joe bills and coins
Why are you giving me money
Change
am who  am
cannot change
Joe tries to hand the money back, but the baffled Clerk refuses it
You change
That's impossible
You're wasting your money
couldn't change even if  wanted to
The Clerk, exasperated, murmurs something in his language and returns to the store
Joe continues on down the street
,   - Parrish is sitting in a wing chair staring at the fire
Joe appears in the doorway, Parrish doesn't notice him
Joe waits, finally Parrish looks up
They regard each other
Silence
Uh -- Yes
--  have the feeling that, all in all, what  made this voyage for -- has served its purpose
What are you saying, that it's time to go
Joe doesn't respond, Parrish and Joe measure each other for the moment
(cont'd) 'm ready
You are
Yeah
Good
Tomorrow, after the party
Parrish nods, Joe nods back
: ,   - bird's eye view of the Hudson, over the George Washington Bridge, past the widest expanse of the river at the Tappan Zee, coming in now over the great lawns and old estates of the Upper Hudson Valley, down towards Annadale-on-Hudson and the Parrish country estate, which commands a beehive of activity, tents and workmen and vehicles
- The Parrish AStar sets down in its roped-off landing area
The Butler runs towards it to open the door, Parrish and Joe disembark
Following the Butler, they make their way through the maelstrom: tents being raised, platforms for music groups, portable pools with clusters of florists leaning over the edge to arrange lily pads within
Parrish and Joe move solemnly, observing the activity, not speaking to one another
Although they are shoulder-to-shoulder, there is a distance between them
They walk on past chan- deliers in the garden and fake trees with lights woven through their branches
Adding to the confusion, the AStar lifts off, the chandeliers rocking and floral pools rippling from the blast of the rotors
May, the housekeeper, appears
(to Parrish) Telephone call, sir
Mr
Sloane from New York
Parrish nods, starts up for a wing off the main house, Joe right at his side
Parrish stops
Excuse me
Joe, not knowing whether to be affronted or not, hesitates, and Parrish strides away
Joe does not follow
' ,   - low-slung but well-appointed room with a writing table, a working fireplace, expensive and appropriate Hudson Valley prints
Parrish enters, clicks on the , observes the party activity through a wide, bow window
Eddie
(
) (speakerphone) Yeah - Bill - How are you
You okay
Fine, fine
Big doing up here
Why are you still down here
(
) (speakerphone) The Board's working through the weekend, trying up the loose ends this damn thing
But  want to give it one more try, 'm still holding out some hope
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but,  promise you, it's hope- less, it's over
Come on up, let's get drunk, if  had your shoulder to lean on  might actually enjoy this -- (
) (speakerphone) No, 'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede
If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it
(
) (speakerphone) Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish
Talk to you Monday
Okay
Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for the memory
Parrish clicks off the , turns around and looks out the window again, the party preparations in full swing, colored lights are tested, they flicker on and off
,   - Allison is everywhere, Parrish emerges from his wing, she catches his eye immediately, the calm director of a DeMille- like epic, politely giving workers instructions, making lightning decisions
Parrish turns his attention now to an ice-filled fountain encircling two giant topiary letters written in faux- Cyrillic, a '' and a '', as rubber-booted delivery men carefully arrange giant ice chests of caviar under each letter
smile creases Parrish's face as, in an unexpected lull, Allison backs into him at the fountain
Hi, Daddy, what do you think
It's starting to grow on me
But what do the '' and '' mean
The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar
The ''s for Beluga, the '' for Petrossian
Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'
Do they, m'dear
-- Plus we've got a baritone with a balalaika coming from The Russian Tea Room
've dressed him in a Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson Eddy songs
Parrish shakes his head
You are amazing
Why, oh why, Allison, are you doing all this
But before she can answer, a workman is tugging at Allison's sleeve, she turns away from Parrish to give him instructions out of Parrish's earshot, and then turns back, they step away now, daughter and father, alone
do it because  love you
Because everybody  loved you
Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you
Yeah
And what about my enemies
They respect you
Isn't that a kind of love
Unexpectedly, Allison brushes a lock away from Parrish's forehead, with a flick she has rearranged his hair, he blinks, a little embarrassed, but having liked it
(cont'd) Above all, you've been a wonderful father
haven't been the father to you that -- That you've been to Susan
wasn't going to say -- But that's what you were thinking
And that's okay
Because  know you love me
Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when  walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now
" weather-beaten military parade ground pennant passes, 24th Infantry Regiment  "" (Charlie) Company
(cont'd) already feel 've had everything could have wanted for my birthday -- Hey, there's lots to come
(gesturing to me activity) little excess -- like you love
The preparations are building to a climax, all the elaborate plans coming to fruition
You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party
(gently) Yes, it is
Allison wades into the maelstrom now, Parrish watches her go, swarms of purveyors and caterers following her
, ,   - Ambrose, the head caterer, is making a last minute check of the bar's stock, Quince ambles up, in the background the activity has built to a pitch, waiters adjusting their uni- forms, purveyors' trucks pulling out in a cloud of dust
Give me a Seagrams and '7'
Ambrose looks at him blankly
(cont'd) No got
Okay a double
, water back
'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr
Quince
Okay, give me a bottle of wine
Red or white
Both
Joe appears, looking bewildered, jostled by caterers setting up last-minute tables, a drummer from the band rolls his traps past on a little cart
Joe doesn't seem to know where he is, when his eyes alight on Quince, he heads for this oasis
Ambrose sets down two bottles of wine and departs
(cont'd) (to Joe) Red or white
No, thank you
Quince sips the red, now the white, now he pours some of each into one glass
'mon, have a drink
You look like you need one bad as me
Do
'm a little confused
Confused, huh
About what
Love
'Love'
Oh, man, 've got troubles of my own
You love Allison, don't you
Oh yes,  do
How did you meet

But she loves you
Quince smiles, nods embarrassedly
(cont'd) How do you know
Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay
mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter
'The deepest, darkest secrets --'
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free
What do you mean 'free'
Free to love each other
Com- pletely
Totally
No fear
Quince seems uncharacteristically within himself
(cont'd) All that hoopla up there reminds me how  will never measure up to a man like Bill Parrish - or his daughter
He drains his wine
(cont'd) Do you like me, Joe
Oh yes, you are one of my favorites
What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish
(a moment) told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you
Drew led me on, but  had no business telling him in the first place
He was setting up Bill from day one
Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts
Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr
Inside
And  was the fool who made it all happen
Oh God, what do  do
Joe regards Quince
Go to Bill Parrish and tell him everything
He'll forgive you
Quince drains one more glass of wine
You think so
How do you know
Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is
moment
Well, maybe
guess you know him better than anybody
Another moment
-- Getting to
The orchestra behind them plays a few riffs, sound checks, getting close
Do you think  should wait to tell him 'till after the party
No
Quince nods anxiously, then smiles gratefully
They look on as the pre-party activities swirl on around them
,   -  () The moment just before sunset, the last pre-party minutes, a procession of guests' cars winding up to the guest house, being directed into adjacent fields
Susan cuts past a re- ceiving line that files up the stairs, she skirts the house and heads straight for the action, the party on the lawns in the rear, climbs a terrace where she commands a view of the event on which the curtain is just about to rise
,   - Guests milling, emerging from the crowd Susan sees, isolated by a fountain, Joe
He looks up towards her, he knows she has seen him, they proceed to a rendezvous that has not been prearranged but which they intuit
Susan slants through the guests, stopping here and there, excited greetings and cha- tter float on the wind, "He, Susie
",  "What a party",  "You look great", she keeps moving, a shimmering wraith
Joe is on the right coordinate to meet her, his graceful, unfailing step carrying him speedily to a destination he is not certain of, but where he knows he will find Susan
,   - The very last rays of the sun setting over the wide expanse of river, the light catching Susan and Joe as they enter the garden, the party forming behind them, the river flowing in front of them
like you in a black tie
love you in an evening gown
It beats a surgical, doesn't it
He smiles
(cont'd) Daddy told me you might be leaving
Yes
Your father and , our time together has come to an end
Where are you going
Joe attempts to answer, but nothing comes out
(cont'd) You won't tell me
Well --  -- And you can't tell me who you are
Again the same indescribable gesture from Joe
(cont'd) 'm in love with a man,  don't know who he is, where he's going or when
can tell you the when part
Tonight
It gets worse
No worse than it gets for me
'm in love with a woman whom  don't want to leave
Then don't
moment
We know so little about each other -- We know all that we need to know -- But there's so much to tell you -- Don't
That will come later
Will it
Lightning struck
We caught it in a bottle
Don't let it out
want to be with you, Joe -- Another moment
What will we do
'Love will find out the way'
'Love will find out the way'
It's a saying
believe that, don't you
Yes, that's why  said it
They are on the brink of some decision, Joe is about to make some declaration when Allison is heard -- (
) There you are
Allison appears
(cont'd) What's going on here
Tete-a-tetes on my big night
(to Susan) 'mon honey, you're needed
(to Joe) Can it wait
But before he can answer -- (cont'd) Glad to hear it
(to Susan) Let's go
She takes Susan's arm and marches her off, Joe, in thrall, watches them go as the  erupts behind them, as 'up' dance tune, a lilting, catchy melody envelops them all
The curtain has risen on William Parrish's 65th birthday party
' ,   - Quince is "on the carpet", sweating through a confession, Parrish moroses but  philosophical at his desk
what can  say after  say that 'm sorry
zipped when  should've zagged,  opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted -- It's okay, Quince
understand
You've always meant well and appreciate that
Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong
on the door, it opens, Joe appears
Excuse me -- He starts to step out
Come in, Joe --  want to thank you -- okay, Bill
Sure
As Joe enters, Quince flashes a warm smile at him
(to Parrish) Joe knew the whole story
told him
It was his idea that  come clean
mean  wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what  mean
Yes,  believe  do
Quince now drifts off
Yeah, well --  can tell you guys got business -- No, 'm out of business, right, Quince
However  do have some unfinished business -- with Drew
Get him out here
Get him on the chopper and get him out here to- night
want to tell this guy how  feel about him face-to-face
Oh, that could be a tall order,
doubt that Drew's anxious to see you face-to-face
Joe steps in
(to Quince) Tell Drew that Bill acknowledges that this was a contest and he's lost
The race is to the swift, but could Drew summon a modicum of understanding and allow Bill to save face
Tell him Bill wants it understood in the business community he has merely moved upstairs in his own company, and the executive continuity is unbroken
Tonight's the night to do it
He'll introduce Drew to his press friends as well as some of his close acquaintances from Washington and Drew can tell them that everything's sailing along just fine
Parrish is impressed by Joe's acumen, a look of grudging admiration
He nods to Joe, summarizes: (to Quince) All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings
You think Drew will go for it
Quince, 've got confidence in you
Sir, 'll deliver the package
He heads out, Parrish and Joe fall silent
Thanks
Not at all
moment
(cont'd) How are you doing
What the hell do you care
was just asking, Bill
You 'want to know', 'll tell you
You're looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, he's galloping into it
And the same time, the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates
And, oh yes,  almost forgot, my daughter's fallen in love with Death
Another moment
-- And 'm in love with your daughter
Say again
'm in love with your daughter, and 'm taking her with me tonight
Parrish is stunned
You're what
think you heard me, Bill
You're not taking Susan anywhere
And what the hell does that mean anyway
Joe doesn't answer for a moment
(cont'd) thought we had a deal
'm sorry, Bill -- Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry
Well, 'm sorry, apology not accepted
love her, Bill
She is all that ever wanted, and 've never wanted for anything because 've never wanted anything before, if you can understand
How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you
It's not love -- Then what is it
Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging
It's missing everything that matters
Which is what
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them
And above all, not hurting the object of your love
So that's what love is
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what am talking about
Those were my words, Bill
Well, they're mine now
Joe is silent for a moment, cogitating
Susan wants to come
She says she's in love with me
With you
Who is 'you'
Did you tell her who you are
No
Does she know where she's going
Joe doesn't answer
(cont'd) Susan went, in whatever way she did, for that poor sonofabitch whose body you took, and everything else since has been aftermath
You say you love her but you don't know what love is
She 'loves' you but she doesn't know who you are
You make a deal, you're breaking it -- the bottom line is, Joe, you're conducting a Great Romance under false pretenses
don't like what you're saying
don't expect you to
Are you threatening me
certainly hope so --  loved Susan from the moment she was born, and love her now, and every minute in between, and what  dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life
Parrish is beginning to reach Joe
Are you telling me  can't be part of it
pause, Parrish's posture changes
Why did you come in here and tell me, Joe
You are the Biggest Shot of all, you don't have to ask my permission, but that's what you're doing
You know why
Because you've somewhere, somehow, developed into a good guy, and you know this is all wrong
don't know what you're going to do -- how can this be love
She doesn't know who you are
Why don't you tell her
Try it out on her
See what happens
Reveal everything there is to know about yourself and let the chips fall where they may
Joe has received what Parrish has said
(cont'd) Okay
-- 've given it my best shot
wish  could tell you to sleep on it but
Parrish lets his words drift into silence, he shrugs, Joe regards him
,   - Joe makes his way down the path from Parrish's study, a weight on his shoulders, his step measured, within himself until he is hit by the lights and laughter and  of the party
He drifts into the center and runs right into Susan, couples swirl about them, the eye of a storm of gaiety
Hello, Joe
What'd you know
She smiles
(cont'd) There's something so indescribably sexy about you in a crowd
could make love to you right here
He hesitates, reaches out to take her hand, studies it
(cont'd) If you're going to tell my future, you're on the wrong side
moment
There is something  do want to tell you -- He stammers into silence
But you can't
Joe is about to respond but doesn't
(cont'd) Just then -- when you hesitated -- the way you shift from foot-to-foot, 've always found endearing but just now --  got a chill
But he drifts again, now she takes his hand
(cont'd) Remember that morning in the coffee shop
You said 'What's wrong with taking care of a woman, she takes care of you --" Did  say that
And  said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that
Joe shifts, she smiles at his embarrasement
(cont'd) Well, you've found one, Joe
The 'coffee shop' -- -- That was the place
and you were the guy
Joe seems resigned now, the air gone out of him
(cont'd) And you said you didn't want me to be your doctor because you didn't want me to examine you --
(a moment) Well,  got to examine you after all -- Joe blinks, at a loss
(cont'd) could come with you -- - uh -- You want me to wait for you, you'll be back -- Joe doesn't answer, Susan is suddenly anxious
(cont'd) Why do  want this night to last forever
Don't you know, that's what  want more than anything
He touches her face
You said before you couldn't tell me who or where, only the 'when' -- Is when now
moment
May  kiss you
She waits
He kisses her, they fall into a deep embrace
That felt like a goodbye
Joe's silence is heavy
(cont'd) What's going on, Joe
feel like we're lifting off -- 'm still here
But you're not
You're somewhere else
(a moment) You're someone else -- Joe is struggling with a response, finally, inevitably, he drifts into a long silence
Susan is beside herself, her emotions tossed in every direction, Joe steadies her
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now -- love you now, 'll love you always -- Hold me -- He holds on tight to her
They are desperately entwined until finally she releases him
Susan -- -- Yes
Thank you for loving me
She smiles wanly, Joe leaves her
' ,   - Parrish is seated by the window, lights from the party flashing past, the  and laughter audible but muted, the fever of the celebration lost on him, within himself
Joe enters, Parrish looks up
We should think about getting started, Bill
Parrish waits
(cont'd) It'll just be us
The tension in Parrish's body releases, he takes a breath
Thank you
Joe nods an acknowledgement, but his face reflects his pain
Parrish regards him sympathetically
The silence is broken by a  on the door
Parrish, out of politeness to Joe, does not respond
(
) Bill --
After a moment
Come in
Quince appears, flushed with excitement
--  got him
The chopper's two minutes away
Parrish weighs the information for a moment
(to Joe) How are we on time
Joe shrugs, nods gently
Okay
(to Quince) Get him in here
Quince exits, Parrish presses the button for the speaker- phone
(cont'd) May
--  know you're busy,  but want you to put in a call to Eddie Sloane for me -- (
) At home, sir --
No, he's at the office
,   - An area on the fringe of the party, the helicopter blades stop spinning
Quince hurries to the aircraft door, opens it and Drew steps out
Quince leads the way through the lights and
Drew, fashioning an imperial entrance for himself, hails partygoers as he passes, Quince enjoying the irony
This is damn big of Bill,  also think it's smart
He had no choice
You're a formidable adversary
He said that
Well, you've got him by the short- hairs
Yeah, the short, gray hairs
He flashes a pleased-as-punch greeting to some unseen acquaintance as they press on to Parrish's study
' ,   - Parrish is at his desk, Joe in a distant corner of the room
(
) (speakerphone) We're all here, Bill -- appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time
As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you -- (a moment) -- or not
Either way, thanks
(
) (speakerphone) We're all ears
Drew enters with Quince, Quince nods, excusing himself, and closes the door behind him
Hi, Bill, happy birthday -- moment
(cont'd) just wanted to say how appre- ciative  am of this - uh - grand gesture and -- Shut up and sit down
Drew takes a seat
(cont'd) You're a worthless sack of shit, you fucked me over, played footsie with John Bontecou, sold my company out to line your own pockets
don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed -- The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all
Is this Mr
Black's fantasy
Another one of his whoppers
Aren't you sick of this asshole lurking around
No one knows who he is, but one thing everyone does know, he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since
Joe can no longer control himself
You're the poison, Drew
You've operated behind-the-scenes to suborn the trust of a man who has stamped you with his imprimatur of class and elegance and stature
've seen all kinds and degrees of deception in my time, but Bill Parrish has been on the receiving end of machinations so Machiavellian that it has rarely been my experience to encounter
And yet he has combatted them stoically, and selflessly, without revealing my identity
Had he violated the vow of secrecy he took, his task would have been far easier, he could have turned defeat into victory, but he is too honorable a man to have done that
And now  must release him from that vow
Because of me, he has lost his work, his company, his reputation -- and now he's going to tell you who  am
Parrish is struck dumb
He looks at Joe pleadingly, shaking his head imperceptibly, but Joe nods to him blithely -- and then commandingly
(to Parrish) So tell me, tell me, 'm peeing in my pants
-- And now you're going to pee some more
Joe, don't do this -- It's time to put this person where he belongs
It's not necessary, Joe
Drew's going to step aside -- 'm not stepping anywhere -- appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home -- The dagger --
told you to shut up
(to Drew) Prepare yourself, Drew -  am -- He is -- 'll take it from here -- (to Drew) am -- -- An  man
Drew is stunned, Joe glances at Parrish, hesitates
(cont'd) Yes, he is
He's an --  man
Aren't you, Joe
Joe is at a loss, Parrish's eyes are glued to his, Joe gets the hint
Yes,  am
(to Drew) man
Drew's head swivels from Joe to Parrish and back again
The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou
They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for
The  wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity
(a moment) agreed to cooperate
(to Parrish) And we're very grateful
Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew
He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence
Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest -- Undisclosed conflict of interest -- An offense -- An indictable offense
Silence
think 'd like to talk to my lawyer -- No lawyers, Drew
We're going to offer you a deal
Drew is all attention
(cont'd) Confess to the Board every details of your participation and then submit your resignation
And what do  get
You get not to go to jail
You're talking through your hat
You're offering a deal because you've got no proof
Proof
We've got plenty of proof
(to Drew) And he's talking through his lips
Joe steps forward
(cont'd) Make no mistake, Drew, if you choose to test my resolve in this matter, you'll be looking at an outcome that will have a finality that is beyond your comprehension, and you'll not be counting the days or the months or the years, but millenniums in the house with no doors
Drew slumps
All right, you win
As soon as get back to the city, 'll meet with the Board
Sloane's voice erupts over the
(
) You're meeting with the Board right now, Drew
Resignation accepted
Moreover,  propose a motion to re- confirm William Parrish as Chairman of the Board of Parrish Communica- tions as well as a rejection of the merger with Bontecou International
How say you, Board
chorus of thunderous "Yes"es resounds through the (
, cont'd) The motion is passed
Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than  bargained for just wanted to set the record straight
(
) But we want you back, Bill
Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details
And Mr
Black, may we say thank you
My pleasure
This is an  Agent's dream
'll be promoted to Chief of Section off of this
Parrish clicks the speakerphone off
Drew is staring at Joe, shaking his head
Who would've ever believed it
You, an  Agent -- Silence
Joe shrugs, smiles
'Death and Taxes'
The door flies open, an anxious Allison appears
Daddy
We've been looking all over for you - this is your party - what are you doing in here
Never mind
You're on
Let's go
She pulls him out of his chair, hustles him out of the room, Joe right behind them
,   - The guests have formed themselves into a huge audience, the orchestra strikes up "Happy Birthday" as Parrish appears with Allison
An enormous cake is unveiled with one great, lit candle, Parrish beams then laughs
He pauses over the cake, now blows the candle out
, cries of "Speech
Speech
", Parrish tries to demur but the request becomes loud and rhythmic, he holds up his hand, nods, quiets the crowd
Joe observes from the fringe
(to the guests) thought  was going to sneak away tonight
of "No
"  "Never
" (cont'd) What a glorious night, every face  see is a memory
It may not be a perfectly perfect memory -- sometimes we had our ups and downs -- but we're all together, and you're mine for a night
(a moment) -- And 'm going to break precedent, and tell you my one-candle wish -- that you would have a life as lucky as mine, where you can wake up one morning and say " don't want anything more
" (another moment) Sixty-five years - don't they go by in a blink
Parrish hesitates, waves and steps away,  that grows into , the music resumes, another dance tune
Quince grabs him, pumps his hand and claps him on the back
Now Parrish spots Allison, he wraps her in a tight embrace, they hold each other close for a moment, but then are separated by a surge of guests
Parrish sees Susan, she smiles but there is a tinge of sadness about her
He heads towards her, they are somehow situated as if they were alone in this crowd
What a night
'm having a helluva time
moment
You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere -- (gently) 'm sorry
Susan is examining Parrish very closely
Are you relieved
Yes, but -- Parrish hesitates
But what
want you to know how much  love you
That you've given a meaning to my life that  had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me
Daddy -- No --  love you so much and  want you to promise me something don't want you to ever worry about me
If anything should happen, 'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right
(a moment) -- And  have no regrets
Susan is in pain now, she can't summon an answer
(cont'd) And  want you to feel that way, too
love you, Daddy -- That's why it's okay
They drift into silence
(cont'd) No regrets
After a moment
'No regrets'
long silence, Susan smiles
It's a good feeling, isn't it
Silence again
Everybody's saying goodbye
They regard each other, a long pause, they have reached an understanding
'm still here
(a moment) Would you like to dance with me, Susan
Oh, yes -- He starts to lead her to the floor, immediately stops
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me
Oh, Dad, you're not old
You'll never be old
He takes her in his arms and they dance away
On a distant fringe of the party, a grass terrace that still commands a view of the dance floor, is Joe
His eyes are on Parrish and Susan, he watches them admiringly yet ruefully
Waiter passes, catches sight of Joe, stops
Can  get you anything, sir
Joe regards the Waiter for a moment
Do you have any peanut butter
The Waiter hesitates
don't think so, sir
Thank you, anyway
The Waiter moves off
Joe's attention returns to Parrish and Susan, the dance number ends, a
On the dance floor
What was that
The fireworks are about to start
Parrish looks up, sees Joe up on the terrace, waiting
(cont'd) (to Parrish) Shall we
You go ahead, honey, 'm going to catch my breath
Suddenly he hugs her, holds her very close
She looks at him, he smiles, nods, but doesn't release her until she smiles back
Now she heads out with the crowd for the fireworks
When Parrish senses she is on her way, he turns and heads up towards Joe
Joe rises to meet Parrish as he approaches
Happy Birthday, Bill
Thank you
They watch the guests gathering to view the fireworks
Joe's gaze lingers
(cont'd) Did you say goodbye
Not exactly
guess you have your reasons
Yes
Silence
Now that we have a moment, would you mind if  expressed my gratitude for what you did for Susan
Joe waits
(cont'd) never heard her speak of any man as she spoke of you -- It was always what  wanted for her -- but what happens to her now
wouldn't worry about it, Bill
These things have a way of working out
Joe regards Parrish, waits until he has a sense that Parrish has accepted what Joe has said, then Joe continues: (cont'd) And would you mind if  expressed my gratitude
Parrish waits
(cont'd) For you
For the time you've given me
For the person you are
moment
Don't blow smoke up my ass, you'll ruin my autopsy
Joe barely manages a smile, now looks back longingly at the crowd below, searching
(cont'd) It's hard to let go, isn't it
Yes
That's life
What can  tell you
silence, an understanding there is another more to say
Joe looks inquiringly at Parrish as if to say "Shall we
", Parrish nods and Joe turns with him
They set off now away from the party, up a meadow that leads to a hill overlooking the river
Down below, the party guests' faces are lit by the initial fireworks display
Among them is Susan, but her interest isn't there
Not something pulls her attention, an over- powering feeling that compels her to turn and see, at a distance, Parrish and Joe walking away up the meadow
Some- thing about the sight saddens and at the same time frightens her, she turns back to the party, dazed, tracing on the fireworks
Up the hill Parrish's step slows, Joe slowing with him
'm getting a little dizzy,  can feel my heart pumping -- But Parrish doesn't wait for a response, just continues on up the meadow, towards the rise of the hill, Joe in step with him
(cont'd) Should  be afraid
Joe stops, Parrish stops with him
Not a man like you
Parrish smiles faintly, takes a deep breath, he strides out again, Joe right with him
In tandem they continue on and disappear over the crest of the hill
barrage of fireworks lights up the sky
Down below, Susan, in a pained reflex, again turns and looks up towards the hill
There is nobody there
She hesitates, now glides away from the party, her step quickens as she walks up towards the hill
Susan halts, in the distance a figure is approaching from over the crest of the hill where Joe and Parrish disappeared
He is heading straight for her, she tries to make him out, seems to recognize him, starts to walk towards him as if pulled by a magnet
Now she stops again
It is a man, he keeps coming, and now that he is close and recognizes him
Joe
He smiles quizzically, hasn't quite heard her, stands right in front of her, loose, smiling, disoriented and yet so appealing
They are riveted on each other, uneasy and yet close
(cont'd) You're here
He is trying to get his bearings
-- You bet
Something about him makes Susan slightly tentative
Where did you go
Joe shrugs, scratches his head endearingly, uncertain of time and place
don't know -- y'know,  don't know -- it's all blurred up and hazy
And would y'know what  mean if  said don't think it's worth figuring out
Some realization is dawning on Susan, it renders her lightheaded
(cont'd) But now 'm back
Susan regards Joe intently, searching his face for an answer
(gently) That's it
Well,  don't know what else to say
It's a helluva party -- You think so
Yeah
and you're the prettier thing here
Susan blinks, a long silence, she touches the sleeve of his jacket, now her hand traces the outline of his face, she regards him intently and the dilemma she has been struggling with the last moments fades away
Susan slowly realizes this is the Young Man
She is shaken, a sudden intake of breath
Hey, you all right
His hand politely touches her elbow, courteously lending her support
The coffee shop -- The Young Man nods, pleased with her recognition
asked you if  said something wrong and you said it was so right it scared you
Susan holds herself very still
(cont'd) And forgive me for saying this -- but then you said -- and it's been with me ever since -- What has --
He hesitates
You said you liked me
No -- 'didn't
moment
said  liked you so much
She falls silent now, overcome by the last moments' revelations
The Young Man senses her discomfort which is on the edge of pain
Hey, everything's going great -- don't y'think
She doesn't answer for a moment
(cont'd) Don't you feel that way
We know so little about each other
But we've got time
She searches the Young Man's eyes, his face is open, completely vulnerable, waiting for her response
long silence, the words come out haltingly: wish you could've known my father
Another moment
Me, too
Susan signs, the Young Man smiles gently, they are completely intent on each other
What do we do now
long silence
It will come to us
Susan smiles, the fireworks finale goes off, the  comes up from below, the night fills with light
The Young Man searches Susan's face, now takes her hand -- and together they start back towards the party
