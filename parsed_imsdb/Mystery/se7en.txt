"Seven", unproduced draft, by Andrew Kevin Walker by Andrew Kevin Walker January 27,1992 The world is a fine place, and worth fighting for
- Ernest Hemingway For Whom the Bell Tolls 1940 -- The white cross on the church steeple stands against blue sky
The church bell rings, resonating
Mass has let out
Small church, small congregation
The dirt road in front is lined with pick-up trucks and parishioners on foot heading to outlying farms and homes
An old two-story house sits across the road
Lone
-- Sunlight comes through the soot on the windows, more brown than bright
, 45, in a suit and tie, stands in this empty second-story room
He looks around, at the ceiling, at the worn wooden floor, at the peeling wallpaper on the walls
Somerset walks to one wall where the current wallpaper is peeled away to reveal flowery wallpaper underneath
He runs his finger across one of the pale red roses that decorates the older paper
He pushes the grime away, brings the rose out more clearly
He pulls at the edge of the paper, carefully ripping off a roughly squared section with the rose at its center
He studies it in his hand
-- Birds sing
Somerset stands, pondering the forested landscape
'  (
) Is something wrong
Somerset does not respond
The , in an ill-fitting real estate jacket, is seated on the hood of a dirty Ford Thunderbird
He holds a check and a booklet of receipts
() Is something the matter
No
no
There's nothing wrong
Somerset still seems distant
(writes receipt) Not that it's any of my business
but, are you figuring on moving out here eventually
Soon
just never seen a man mortgaging an empty house before
Everything here still seems
seems so strange to me
All this
don't know
'd say this place is about as normal as places get
The man walks over to hand over a receipt
Somerset accepts the receipt, folds it
Somerset smiles
That is exactly what  mean
Strange
Somerset looks back at the house
The man does not understand
--  -- (  ) Somerset is in a window seat, smoking a cigarette, looking out the speeding train
He is near the back of the car, away from the few other passengers
Outside, farms, small homes and lawns pass
The entire panorama is dappled by the rays of the soon setting sun
The light flickers across Somerset's placid face
-- The train is nearly full
Somerset has his suitcase on the aisle seat beside him
He has a hardcover book unopened on his lap
He still stares out the window, but his disposition has soured
The train is passing an ugly, swampy field
car's burnt-out skeleton sits rusting in the bracken
little further on, two dogs are fighting, circling, attacking, their coats matted with blood
Somerset turns his head to watch the dogs
Away in the field, another dog sprints to join the fight
-- Passing urban streets below
Slums
Smashed cars
People stand on the corners, under the bleak glow of street lamps
Somerset's suitcase is by the window
Somerset is now in the aisle seat, reading his book
'  --   -- ( ) Curtains closed
The  of the  are here as they will be everywhere in this story
Somerset's life is packed in many moving boxes, except for clothing in a closet and hundreds of books on shelves
Somerset, dressed only in his underwear, lays back on the bed
He reaches to the nightstand, to a wooden, pyramidical metronome
He frees the metronome's weighted swingarm so it moves back and forth
Swings to the left
, swings to the right
Tick, tick, tick, measured and steady
Somerset situates on the bed, closes his eyes
The metronome's ticking competes with the sound of the car alarm
Somerset's face tightens as he concentrates on the metronome
His eyes close tighter
Tick, tick, tick
the swingarm moves evenly
Somerset's breathing deepens
The car  seems
Tick, tick, tick
Somerset continues his concentration
The  is the
Somerset's face relaxes slightly as he begins to fall asleep
Tick, tick, tick
/  -- , 31, exits with a bagged 40oz bottle of beer
He is a lean, attractive man, constantly coiled, eyes always smoldering
as he walks quickly past iron-gated storefronts
He crosses the street under elevated subway tracks
train roars overhead
Mills watches it as he walks on
Blue sparks spit off the third rail and illuminate Mills, throwing his shadow long down the deserted street
-- This rotting neighborhood lives in the shadow of a single fat skyscraper
Mills walks, looks at the broken refrigerators and pieces of junk in the gutter
Ahead in the street,    struggle with a crowbar to break into the trunk of a parked car
Mills draws near
One thug looks up, doesn't think Mills will be a problem, continues prying
Mills stops, calm
Is that your car, man
What the fuck do you care
Mills pauses, switches his beer bottle to his other hand
Does that car belong to you
The thugs look at each other, gauging
They face Mills
Yeah, it's my car, alright
Fuck off
You're telling me that's your car
The second thug starts the long way round the car
Well, for some strange reason,  don't believe you
Mills gives a "isn't that silly" laugh, shifts his gaze -- Sees the first thug slide the crowbar so it's held as a weapon
(steps forward) You can fucking suck my
Mills swiftly finishes that sentence by smashing his bottle against the first thug's head
The thug falls, swings blindly
The second thug moves from the side, brings out a knife
Mills averts, swings, pounds the side of his fist into the second thug's face --
Broken nose
The second thug stumbles back, drops the knife, his nose squirting blood
Mills turns, enraged, breathing hard
The first thug is screaming, trying to stand
Mills takes one step, punts the first thug's head
The crowbar clatters away
Mills is in the process of kicking a man when he's down, when the second thug grabs him from behind, pulls him backwards
Mills clutches at the thug's arm, trying to avoid a choke-hold
They both struggle spastically
The thug's winning
Gurgling, gasping for air, Mills shifts his weight, drops to one knee and spins the thug, slamming him against the car
Mills breaks loose, grabs a handful of the second thug's hair and holds the man's head against the car's side window
Mills' free hand pounds the thug's face: once, twice -- third time's the charm as the window shatters
The thug goes out cold
Mills backs off, still incensed
He rubs his throat, looking at the two prone men
Slowly, he regains some composure
He takes a keychain from his pocket
He unlocks the door of the car, loads one of the thugs into the back seat
He walks to collect the other thug off the street
' ,  -- Somerset picks items off a moving box:  keys, wallet, homicide badge
Finally, he opens the hardcover book from the train
From the pages, he takes the pale, wallpaper rose
-- wall is stained by a starburst of blood
Somerset stands, melancholy, looking at a body on the floor under a sheet near a sawed-off shotgun
The apartment is gloomy
, 52, looks through a notepad
Neighbors heard them screaming at each other
It was nothing new or unusual
But, then they heard the gun go off
Boom, boom
both barrels
Did his wife confess
Did she actually speak the words
When the patrolman got here she was trying to put his head back together
She was crying too hard to say anything
(shuts notebook) Crime of passion
Yes
Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here
Taylor shifts his weight, impatient, annoyed
This is a done deal
All but the paperwork
Somerset looks at a coloring-book open on the coffee table
There are crayons beside it
Somerset picks the book up
He flips through: crudely colored pictures
Did their son see it happen
What kind of question is that
Huh
(pointing) He's dead
His wife killed him
There it is
That's all
Anything else has nothing to do with nothing
Somerset replaces the book, digs up a cigarette from his pocket
() You and your fucking questions, Somerset
'm glad 'm getting rid of you today
You know that, you fuck
David Mills enters, dressed in a suit
He looks a bit lost
Uh
Lieutenant Somerset
Somerset lights his cigarette, looks to Mills
() 'm David Mills
your new partner
/  -- body-bag is carried through the crowd around the tenement doors
Somerset follows
Mills follows Somerset
They walk towards the end of the filthy block
'm a little thrown
just finished orientation at central, and they dumped me off down here
heard you brought in two small-timers last night
Yeah
Two real idiots
Since we are just starting out, thought we could go to a bar
Sit and talk for awhile
That way we can
Excuse me, but 'd rather start sniffing for a case, if it's all the same to you
Seeing how we only have a week for this whole transition thing
(waits) want to get into the shit a
s
a
p
, know what  mean
Somerset walks, no reply
Mills searches to get a read on him
meant to ask you something
when we spoke on the phone
can't help wondering
(pause) Why are you here
(wary) don't follow
All this effort you've gone through, to be transferred from Philadelphia to here
It's the first question that pops into my head
Mills formulates his response
'm here for the same reasons as you, guess
Or
at least the same reasons you used to have for being here
(cutting) before you decided to give up
Somerset stops and faces Mills
You think you know me
You just met me two minutes ago
Maybe  don't understand the question
It's very simple
You've come from the "City of Brotherly Love" to the "City of Brotherly Hate," detective
've never seen it done that way
don't know
Maybe  thought  could do more good here than there
(pause) You know, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right out kicking each other in the balls
But, you're calling the shots, lieutenant, so however you want it to go
Let me tell you how  want this to go
want you to look, and  want you to listen
wasn't standing around Philly guarding the fucking Liberty Bell
But, you've never worked homicide in this city
realize that
Well, please do me the favor of remembering it
Mills just stares back at Somerset
Somerset walks
Mills rolls his eyes, looks to heaven like, "what'd  do to deserve this
"  He follows Somerset
-- ' ,  -- Somerset lies asleep on the bed
It is still dark outside
Relatively quiet
The  beside the inactive metronome Somerset awakens suddenly, rankled
' ,  -- It is barely becoming light outside
Mills can't sleep
Alone in a double bed
He sits up, frustrated
Sits on the edge of the bed and looks around
The room is a shambles, filled with moving boxes
The light coming through the window glows upon a football trophy on one box
Large and noble, a golden player stands in frozen motion at the trophy's pinnacle
Mills looks at the trophy and a fond smile forms on his face
The  of  and  is  from another room
Mills looks at the closed bedroom door, troubled
' ,  / -- Across a living room full of boxes,  , 30, a beautiful woman, stands in her bathrobe
She's upset about something, takes dishes out of boxes, puts them on the kitchenette counter
She pulls a mug from a clump of newspaper and pours some tea from a pot on the stove
Blowing on the steaming tea, she leans back on the counter, looks over at the closed bedroom door
The tea is too hot to sip, and as Tracy is placing the mug on the counter behind her the
Startled, she releases the mug too close to the edge
It falls -- Crashes to the floor, shatters
/ ,  -- dark hall
Somerset and Mills stand with  , 28, a beefy, uniformed cop
Light from a camera's flash spills in from the nearby kitchen
Davis hands Somerset two flashlights
At what time did you confirm the death
Like  said, we didn't touch anything, but we were on scene at like o-five- hundred, so he's had his face in a plate of spaghetti for about half an hour
Wait, wait, wait
You didn't check him
You didn't check vital signs
Believe me, he's gone
Unless he's breathing spaghetti sauce now
No
The point is, when you're first man in, you check vital signs
This guy's sitting in a pile of his own shit and piss
If he ain't dead he would have stood up by now
(getting angry) Listen, Godzilla
Somerset steps in, heads Mills off
Thank you, Officer Davis
We'll see you again after we've had a look
Yes, sir
Davis leaves, eyeing Mills
Mills watches him
Somerset hands Mills a flashlight, takes out surgical gloves
wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into
And,  wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a supposedly dead man who didn't really die until Davis was back in the patrol car calling the morgue and eating a powdered donut
Somerset snaps one glove over his hand and checks the fit
Drop it
We have more important concerns just now, don't we
Fine
for now
/ ,  -- The   packs up, hoists his camera and equipment bag
Somerset and Mills enter
Mills puts on his own pair of rubber gloves
The grubby kitchen is small; barely room for four people to move around in
The photographer exits: Bon appetit
The only light is a murky green illumination from the ceiling
The light bathes an   who is slumped forward in a kitchen chair, face-down-dead in a plate of spaghetti
The sizable kitchen table's green tablecloth is covered with soiled paper plates
The plates hold bits of half-eaten sandwiches, potatoes, donuts and other junk-food remnants
Mills and Somerset turn on their flashlights
Mills points his at the green bulb above
Aluminum foil has been wrapped around the bulb to focus the light on the corpse
Somerset sweeps the room with his flashlight
He goes to the body and kneels beside it
There's a rope tied around the man's wide gut
Mills comes to stand beside Somerset
guess that makes it homicide
Somerset crouches lower, uses a pen to lift one of the dead man's pants cuffs
Rope is tied around the purplish ankle
Mills examines the knots behind the chair's back
Shines his flashlight on the man's belly
() Still, he could have tied himself in
To make it look like murder
Somerset isn't listening, focused on the corpse
He studies the man's head and neck without touching
() don't see any blood or bruises yet
No wounds
You see anything
(irritated) Not yet
Somerset stands, points his flashlight: the obese man's stiff hands are clutching utensils
knife in the left hand, a fork sticking straight up in the right with a hunk of meat hanging skewered
Cockroaches swarm
Mills turns to the sink and stove
Each burner of the stove has a used pot or pan on it
There's food slopped everywhere
saw a guy once
committed suicide, but he wanted to make sure his family could collect insurance money, right
Somerset walks to the room's only window
The window has been painted over with black paint
he touches the window with his pinkie finger
The paint is still wet
Mills goes to a trash can by the refrigerator
The trash can is full to the brim with empty food containers
() So, this guy took this big knife
and he held it behind him, put the tip of it in his back, and he ran backwards into the wall
Cause, he thought it was going to look like someone stabbed him in the back
Mills opens the refrigerator
It's nearly empty
() Except, he poked a big fucking hole in the dry wall when he did it
If you could
spare me the anecdotes for now
Leave the refrigerator open for the light
(sarcastic) Oh, forgive me
thought we had this male-bonding thing going
My mistake
Somerset looks at the floor, deep in thought
His flashlight beam follows a trail of dripped sauces, soups and bits of food running from the stove to the table
What do you smell
Other than him, and all the food
(sniffs) don't know
there's something
Somerset goes close to the table, then leans to peer under
bucket
Somerset points the flashlight and Mills crouches, pulls up the tablecloth on his side of the table
Two large dead rats lay on the floor beside a metal bucket
Mills grimaces, slides under the table, careful to avoid the rats
He looks in the bucket
He leans back, baffled
It's vomit
He looks at Somerset under the table
() It's a bucket of vomit
Is there any blood in it
Can't tell by looking
Somerset stands, perplexed, stares at the dead man
There is a knock at the door
The detectives look to ', 52, the medical examiner
'Neill is a frumpy man, seems a bit gone, looking at the green bulb
' Mood lighting
Very sixties
He drops his bag on the floor, sorts through the contents
(to Somerset) You think he was poisoned
Mills goes to the trash can, pokes the garbage with a pencil
() And, those rats there somehow ate the poison off the floor
Guessing this early is useless
' You girls have got the forensics guys out there chompin' at the bit
Don't know if we'll all fit in here though
Mills continues searching the garbage
There's room
Light's the problem
Well, three is certainly a crowd in here
And, with four, someone's bound to be stepping on evidence
(pause) Detective Mills, go help the officers question the neighbors
(not pleased) Thanks, but no thanks
'll stay on this
Somerset watches 'Neill at the corpse
'Neill points a thin flashlight with his mouth, his hands free for the examination
(not looking up) Send one forensic in on your way out
Mills is pissed
He lifts his flashlight to shine it on the side of Somerset's face
moment passes
Somerset looks at Mills, light shining directly in Somerset's eyes
longer moment
Mills switches the light off
He leaves
'Neill unceremoniously places both hands on the dead man's head, lifts the swollen visage from the spaghetti
' He is dead
,   -- ,
Mills punches the heavy bag with hard, quick punches
Sweat drips off his face
He's in work- out clothing, a bundle of nerves wearing boxing gloves
The walls are covered in mirrors
Other cops watch Mills as they pass, checking out the new kid
Mills keeps punching, skillfully
He stops when he sees Somerset reflected in one of the mirrors
Somerset walks over, carrying a pizza box with paper piled on top
He sits on a near bench, takes out a cigarette
Pizza and paperwork, Detective Mills
We need to chat
,   -- Mills opens a door and enters with Somerset behind
They are alone
Chairs face an old, limp-roped boxing ring
Practice pads hang from pegs on a wall
Mills clasps a pair in his gloves, offers them to Somerset
No
You just hold them up
do all the work
Somerset takes the pads reluctantly, puts them on
He still has the un-lit cigarette hanging from his mouth
Mills climbs into the ring
He holds the ropes open for Somerset, waits
Somerset doesn't want to do this, but he climbs up
() You've seen my files
seen the things 've done
Yes
Impressive work
Mills motions to Somerset and Somerset holds up the practice pads
Mills starts working them, lightly, warming up
So, what's your problem
've done my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat
know it
That doesn't mean
did all that shit a long time ago
Somerset's very stiff, uncomfortable
made a decision, because  have to worry about the integrity of the scene
That's bullshit
When 'm on scene, 'm not going to worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field
'm there to do the work
Mills punches a little more aggressively
Somerset's backing, flinching, keeping the pads high
The badge in my pocket says "detective," just like yours
've been Homicide for four and a half years
You've worked Homicide for four years, or for five years
Don't count the half-years, unless you want to sound like a rookie
Mills unloads a mighty wallop and one practice pad recoils into Somerset's face, knocks Somerset on his ass
Oops
My hand slipped
Mills walks, climbs out of the ring
() You fucked me over today, and you know it
You know it
Somerset looks at the broken cigarette in his mouth
He contains his anger
He seems to realize Mills has a point
() Just don't jerk me off
That's all ask
It's not much
Don't jerk me off
(pause) Please, do me the favor of remembering that
Mills exits
Somerset spits out the broken cigarette
,  -- Tracy looks out a window from behind steel bars
Below her, young children play in a playground
They're playing hop-scotch, throwing balls, chasing each other
The swing sets are broken
The handball wall is graffitied
'  (
) 'm sorry, Mrs
Mills
We don't have anything right now
Tracy looks away from the window to the haggard
The school's office is ill-equipped, busy, disorganized
() We'll try to give you a call if we need substitutes next month
Thank you
Tracy looks back at the playground: on the other side of a chain-link fence, a butcher in a bloody apron walks down the ramp of a freezer truck
he carries a big, whole, slaughtered pig on his shoulder
The pig's head flops as the butcher walks
Some children stop their games and run to watch the man and the pig corpse pass
-- The train clatters through a tunnel, packed full, The lights go on and off
Passengers read tabloids, stare at their feet, study advertisements on the walls; anything to avoid making eye-contact with others
All races, creeds and colors; all ugly, forlorn human beings
Tracy stands fatigued, holding a handrail
bag-lady, crusted with dirt, reeking, pushes her way through the crowd
man presses against Tracy in an attempt to let the bag-lady pass
Tracy switches hands on the rail, turns sideways to make room
She looks down
On one seat, a man, quite normal looking, sits holding a porno magazine, - , in one hand
His other hand is in his pocket
He's obviously masturbating himself in his pants
No one else notices or seems to care
Tracy looks away, disgusted
She closes her eyes
The train's wheels   as the train takes a curve
-- The front and one side of the shop are entirely open to the busy sidewalk and street
transparent plastic canopy frames the entrance
, 20, stands at the edge of the canopy
He wears a stained sweatsuit outfit and hums a song, oblivious
Tracy and Mills look together over the piles of fruits and vegetables piled on wooden stands which form tight aisles
It was okay
mean
it was certainly better than yesterday
think Somerset and  came to a small understanding
Mills holds his thumb and forefinger about a quarter of an inch apart to illustrate
() about this big
He sounds interesting
He is that, if nothing else
Mills throws some oranges in the basket hanging from Tracy's arm
He goes to check out the carrots
Tracy looks up from heads of lettuce to the strange man at the entrance
The strange man hums on, rocking back and forth slowly, his eyes glassy
Customers come and go, paying him no mind
Mills notices Tracy's interest
He keeps comparing carrots
() We started a big homicide case today
'll spare you the grisly details
The strange man suddenly stops humming and looks into the store with a crooked grin
Name that tune
Anybody name that tune
Name that tune
The man keeps repeating this, over and over, still ignored
It's
it's like they emptied all the insane asylums into the streets
She looks back to the heads of lettuce
() That's what it's like
Like they just gave up, and let everyone out
Mills nods, his back to Tracy
() There are a lot of frightening people in this city
There are a lot of frightening people in the world
Tracy looks again to the strange man
Name that tune
Anybody name that tune
It seems worse than Philadelphia, because everything is pushed right up against you
In your face
Mills edges past Tracy towards the front of the store, tries to be pleasant
Listen, honey
don't want to fight tonight
Okay
Can we just go one night without fighting about something
He looks over apples, thinks that's the end of that
'm not trying to start a fight
(pause) How am  trying to start a fight
We're here now
Okay
Are we supposed to pack it all in and go back
How are we going to do that
Do  have to act like  love this place
Is that what a "good wife" would do
(doleful) There's a lot of pressure on me
And, there's a lot of pressure on me
'm here with you
know
know
Mills steps towards the open air entrance
He's watching something
The strange man is still heard offscreen
Tracy reaches to a high wooden shelf, trying to reach a bag of rice, her back to Mills
'm not going to close my eyes and block everything out, David
'm not going to act like you delivered us to some sort of paradise
can't
She gets the rice and turns
Mills is not there
She sighs, angry, looks around
She walks towards the entrance and sees him -- '
-- In front of the stand, Mills has run to the corner of the sidewalk to help a very old woman with a cane
The elderly woman smiles up at Mills, takes his arm as he helps her off the curb and across the street
He talks to her as they go
-- Tracy's anger fades
She shakes her head, touched, amazed by the plain boy scoutishness of her husband
'
-- Mills deposits the old woman on the other side
She thanks him, patting him on the cheek
Mills starts back towards the fruit stand, proud of himself
car screeches to a halt, just missing him
The driver leans out the window, yelling at Mills
Mills kicks the side of the car
Fuck you
(as car leaves) Fuck you, you son of a bitch
'm walking here
-- Tracy rolls her eyes in amused disappointment
She sighs again
Mills passes the babbling strange man, comes up to Tracy
'm sorry
couldn't pass it up never had a chance to actually do that
But, we can start the argument right back up where we left off, right
Tracy looks at him, charmed, no longer willing to fight
(playing dumb) What
Tracy wraps an arm around Mills and kisses him
He holds her
That was the theme from tv's Mod Squad
'm surprised nobody got that one
The strange man starts humming a new tune
An old man tries to get through the aisle where Mills and Tracy are kissing
(infuriated) Excuse me
Excuse me
' ,  -- small transistor   on the bedside table
Mills and Tracy are in bed, making love under the sheets
They move rhythmically, kissing, sweating hard
Mills holds Tracy's hair in his hands, pulls her head back as she gasps and he thrusts his entire body against hers
Mills' hair is soaked
He is anything but mellow as a lover, quickening while Tracy twists underneath him
Tracy holds tight to the back of his neck with one hand
Finally, Mills pushes himself up on his arms, holding his head down against Tracy's chest
Holds for a long moment, till he is spent and lowers himself against her, into her arms
He rests a long time
She kisses his forehead, keeping her eyes closed
Finally, Mills rolls off her, gets behind her and wraps the both of them in the sheets
He folds himself against her, and they stay that way
Goodnight
Goodnight
After a long moment, Mills shifts back, sits up
Tracy looks over her shoulder at him as he takes a towel off a chair and stands
Mills wraps the towel around his waist
He leans over to give Tracy a last kiss
She watches him leave the room
She is about to say something, but does not
light comes on in the other room, leaking through the door
' ,   -- Mills sits down at his desk
He starts looking through police paperwork
The  in the other room goes  in mid song
-- -- The room is cold, clean
Stainless steel
White tile
Many pathologists work at slabs
Mills and Somerset are with , 35, who stands over the mostly dissected obese corpse
If you take a look here, buddies
can tell you, it was not a poison
If you can see
have emptied all of everything out of the stomach
But, look at it, now that took away the liver
Santiago reaches into the belly of the cavernous corpse
Mills moves closer beside Somerset, but not too close, trying to hide his disgust
We hear squashy sounds as Santiago works, but we don't see in
() move the lungs over
First, see how big this fat son-of-a-bitch stomach is
Now
here is the strange thing, on the stomach
Stretches
(pointing) And, here is it distended
Look at the size of that, because of the foods
can see what you're pointing at
On the stomach
The lines of distention
Somerset's looking in, not believing what he sees
Doctor, are you saying this man
ate till he burst
Yes, well, he didn't actually burst
He was bleeding, inside of himself
And, there's a hemotoma on the outside
on the belly
Somerset walks around the slab, looking the body over
He died by eating
Someone punched him, or kicked him
Somerset notices something on the partially shaved head
He leans close to look at five or six small bruises on the back of the dead man's head; circular bruises, some darker than others, all about the same diameter as a dime
() Oh, and there is this here
something else you have to look at and see
Somerset stands straight, realizes something about the bruises
() Most of his stomach contents are in the lab now
but, this
found these in the fat man's stomach
Santiago looks amongst tools, buckets and jars of liquid
He picks up a glass jar and shows it to Mills
In the jar: many little bits of blue plastic
Like scrapings
Plastic
Mills gets Somerset's attention, hands him the jar
Somerset looks at it a long time
Why these were in a fat man's stomach, don't know
/ ,  -- Outside the door to the murder scene, Mills and Somerset cut through the  /  seal
Those bruises on the back of the victim's head were caused by the muzzle of a gun
So, the killer had him at gunpoint, and gave him a choice: eat, or get your head blown off
/ ,  -- Somerset and Mills enter
Somerset takes out the jar of plastic scrapings, turns on the now normal light
They begin to search
He was force-fed
till his body started rejecting the food
He literally couldn't eat another bite
So, the killer held a bucket under him
His throat was swollen from the effort
He was bleeding internally
He must have blacked out
and, if you're the killer, you're not going to want to wait around for him to die
Somerset examines the counter tops and wall
Mills gets down on his knees, examines the linoleum floor
You kick him, pop him like a fucking balloon
(touches floor) Somerset, look here
Somerset gets down, holds the jar against the linoleum
Same color and texture
They both crawl on hands and knees, study every inch of floor
If this is what that is
it doesn't make sense
It doesn't figure
Always look for one thing to focus on
There's always one singular thing, and it might be as small as a speck of dust, but find it and focus
till it's an exhausted possibility
How are pieces of the floor going to get in the guy's stomach
Exactly
Why would so many pieces be inside his stomach unless they were placed there intentionally
Somerset notices deep scratches in the linoleum, fingers the grooves
He takes a piece of plastic from the jar, holds it to the scratches, fiddles with it, fits it in
He looks up to see, these scratches are in front of the refrigerator
It looks like they were caused by the refrigerator having been pulled away from the wall and pushed back at some time
/ ,  -- We are    as it is rocked back and forth
It's pulled away from the wall
Somerset and Mills strain, pull a few more feet, then release
They lean to look -- The refrigerator had hidden a space on the wall where the dust has been cleared
In that space: a circle, smeared in grease, and a note taped in the center of the circle
Somerset's  starts
Mills leans to read: "Dear Detectives
Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to the light
" (looks at Somerset) This is not good
Milton
What
It's a quote from a book
Milton's Paradise Lost
Somerset takes out his beeper, looks at the  window
He looks up at Mills, like they've received very bad news
,  -- marble hallway
, 50, nervously chewing his nails, quickly leads Mills and Somerset past cops and forensics
said to myself, 'm not going to screw around with this
Nope
Fuck that
It's still pretty fresh meat
called the medical examiner
he's coming
(stops at door) When  got to it,  knew
As soon as laid eyes on it,  knew
The detective opens the door
Somerset and Mills -- / ,   -- Gross, deep yellow light comes through the only window with its blinds up
The light anoints a   displayed, dead
(
) this is your guy who did this
The nude dead man's legs are folded under him as if he were kneeling, and he's bent forward, chin on the floor
His eyes are open, his arms outstretched before him
Mills and Somerset walk to either side of the man
The detective closes the door, bites his thumbnail
The apartment is on a high floor, so it's quiet
Somerset sees the window has been covered with a sheet of yellow gel, stapled in place to produce the colored light
Mills examines the corpse
There's a chair one foot behind the nude man
It's an elegant leather chair, drenched in blood
There's a carving knife on the carpet in the middle of a huge stain of blood under the chair
Mills looks at pieces of cut rope on the floor behind the chair
The rope is knotted
Somerset crouches beside the body
There's a big piece of flesh missing from the man's left side, as if the love-handle had been lopped off
Hundreds of pennies lie scattered under and around the man
The man's hands are palms up, fingers wrapped around more pennies
Mills walks over to examine a scale on the floor between the corpse and the doorway
It's an old-fashioned counter-balance scale with two suspended dishes on a see-saw arm
In the high dish: the hunk of flesh missing from the man's side
In the low dish: a one pound counterweight
(to Somerset) pound of flesh
Somerset stands and walks backwards to view the entire scene from near the door
He looks worried, vaguely frightened
He turns his head, looks to a far wall
Beside a big, abstract, constructivist painting, there's a note pinned up inside a triangular smear of blood
, '  -- An office full of pictures, books and mugsheets, yet it is meticulously well kept
The , 50, sits at his tidy desk
He's dressed conservatively
Mills and Somerset sit before him
Somerset reads from a photocopy of the note they just found
(reading) "One pound of flesh, no more no less
No cartilage, no bone, but only flesh
This task done, and he would go free
" The captain is a calm man, but whenever not speaking, without fail, he clenches his jaw repeatedly, causing the muscles in his neck and jaw to pulse
Somerset stands, paces
() This victim, Mr
Gold, was tied down nude, holding a carving knife
And he was given a long time
to decide
Where to make the first cut
There's a gun to your head
but, what part or parts of your body are expendable
Mills sits back in his chair, arms crossed, seems anxious, doesn't know why they're here
() Mr
Gold tried for the whole pound at once, his love handle
But, he went into shock
Bled to death
What is the point, Somerset
Look at both killings together
This murderer is an artist
An artist
He uses colors and symbols
He positions the bodies after death, so he's working with composition
It's been premeditated so meticulously
and this is just the beginning
Wrong
For all we know, we might never hear from him again, and  don't want that kind of talk floating around
Somerset shakes his head "no
" The rats and the pennies
The circle and the triangle on the wall
There's something about them
these murders mean something
So
What
Somerset has no answer
The captain is irked, jaw clenching
() (to Mills) You with him, or you just here to watch
This is his stuff, captain
've been out in the cold most of the day
(to Somerset) Always working overtime up in that big brain of yours, huh
Always cooking
need you to know
want us reassigned
We're declining this case
(sits up, angry) What
What the hell are you talking about
This cannot be my last duty here
It's going to go on and on
You've left unfinished business before
Everything else was taken as close to a conclusion as humanly possible
Can  just say something
Also
don't think this should be Mills' first case
This is not my first case, fuckhead
don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset
And nobody's going to swap with you
Give it to me, then
There's nothing that says  have to fly with him
The captain considers this
() If Somerset wants out, fuck him
It would be too much for him, too soon
(to captain) Could we talk about this in private
The captain looks at Somerset, then at Mills
That's not necessary
You're in
Thank you, sir
Start picking up the pieces
'll shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner
Mills stands
Somerset will not look him in the eye
Mills leaves, slams the door
Somerset seems deflated
() You win, Somerset
You're out
-- -- vendor lays out a pile of tabloid newspapers at his busy newsstand
The headline:
, in huge print
The vendor lays out another tabloid pile
Headline: " ,"   , in big, red letters
The vendor places a third pile beside the others: - , '  -- Old office
Moving boxes on the floor
The single window faces a billboard
Somerset works on a manual typewriter
He types hunt-and-peck, slowly
His paperwork is on the desk in two sloppy piles
jarring  is  , like fingers on a blackboard
Somerset looks up, irritated
is working at the open door, holding the source of the sound, a razor blade he's using to scrape the words off the door's window
Sorry
Somerset turns back to typing
The captain steps in, looks at the workman, then drops more papers on Somerset's desk
As always, the neatly groomed captain clenches his jaw
He looks around
Two of boxes on the floor have written across them
The captain picks one up, puts it on top of the other
He sits, watching Somerset, starts straightening the forms on the desk
What are you going to do with yourself out there, Somerset
'll get a job
Maybe on a farm
'll fix up my house
Can't you feel it yet
(pause) Can't you feel that feeling
that you won't be special anymore
(lying) don't know what you mean
You know
Somerset reclines, looks at the captain
Did you read in the paper today, about the man who took his dog for a walk
And how he was mugged
And, his wallet was taken, and his watch
Then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes
It happened last night
Not far from here
heard
have no understanding of this place
It's always been like this
Somerset saddles up to the typewriter
Hunt-and-peck
Yes
You're absolutely right
The captain lays the paperwork down in two neat stacks
You were made for this work, Somerset
can't believe you're going to trade it all in for a tool belt and a fishing rod
But,  guess 'm wrong
The captain leaves
Somerset looks up now that the captain's gone
He grabs the paper piles and ruffles them back to their disheveled state
He looks at the workman
The workman is looking at Somerset, has a rag in his hand to remove the last remnants of Somerset's name
(angrily) Put a little elbow grease into it
The workman is startled, continues his work
/ ,   -- The grandly furnished apartment where the second murder took place has been dusted for prints and searched
Two female forensics are at work
/ ,   -- Mills is seated in front of a long writing desk with many drawers
All the drawers are open
Mills looks through letters and stationary
Nothing of use
He tosses the pile back
He sits back, frustrated, yanks off one rubber glove, looks around the room
Books have been taken off their shelves, the bed has been stripped
The room has been given the once over
The victim's family photographs hang in expensive frames on one wall
There are at least thirty photos of various sizes: ancestors, sons and daughters, grandchildren and friends
An over-weight forensic, , 35, leans in through the doorway
Mills looks up and Chris shakes his head glumly
He must have left us another puzzle to solve
somewhere
We'll keep looking, but we're running out of possibilities
Chris leaves and Mills stands to stretch
Something catches Mills' eye
He walks over to the door, curious
At the base of the open door, there's a ball of paper wedged under to act as a doorjamb
Mills puts his glove back on, pulls the ball out
He uncrumples the paper as the door slowly swings shut
The page has a drawing on it, of the sun with waves of heat at its edges
There is a single eye in the center of the sun
An arrow is drawn in dried blood on the back of the closing door
Mills notices this and pushes the door closed
The blood arrow points to the side and up, seems to be pointing to the photo gallery wall
Mills goes to examine the photos
His eyes search each photo
one by one
till he sees it: Christ
framed photo of a falsely pretty, middle-aged woman smiling and wearing pearls
Under the glass, on the photo itself, circles have been drawn in blood around the woman's eyes ,  -- An assault on the senses
Crowded streets and sidewalks
On every corner, in every doorway, on every stairwell -- freaks, junkies, punks, leather boys and motorcycle girls
few tourists wander in the mix, heedful of the dangers around them
Buildings border narrowly
Somerset walks against the stream
He carries a file
from the entrances of clubs
from one club is soon  by  from a second story window
- blasts from the tattoo parlor
Somerset does not like this place, views it with disdain
He walks to avoid two men fighting on the ground
The men are pulling hair and pounding each other idiotically
Somerset takes a cigarette from a full pack, lights it as he crosses through the traffic jam in the street
steps up with his hand out
Spare me a cigarette, money-grip
Spare me a cigarette
Sorry
Last one
He walks on
We  to
-- club at capacity
The    like a slow, cool breeze from a   on a platform
The air is thick with smoke
Yuppies sit elbow to elbow with the last members of the beat generation
Everyone's drinking beer, smoking pot
Somerset crosses the club, looking for someone
He takes a tissue from his pocket, rips pieces off and jams the pieces in his ears
At the back of the club, a major-league bouncer stands in front of a closed door
Somerset shows his badge and the bouncer steps aside with reservation
-- The walls are black
Somerset opens the door, enters, walks down the long flight of stairs
As Somerset descends, the and is  by the sound of
At the bottom, Somerset opens another door
He enters -- -- narrow room
is even
This is a private art party
The people are lizard-like, pale
Men and women priding themselves on their gauntness
Somerset passes canvases on the walls
Pointlessly abstract paintings
Splatters, smears and blobs of color
Party-people stand in front of these "works," engrossed
Somerset slides past, not interested in the art, jamming the tissue further in his ears
He spots his objective
McCRACKEN, 42, stands inside a circle of admirers
He is dressed like a pauper, his baggy clothing stained with many colors of paint
He wears dark sunglasses, bored by the bleached-blonde girl whispering in his ear
Somerset worms his way to stand in front of William
The party- goers turn their attention to this intrusion
William looks up, pushes the girl away
He takes off his sunglasses
His eyes are badly bloodshot and listless
He looks Somerset over
and then grins, glad to see him
' ,   -- Mills stands brooding over a photocopy of the picture of the woman with her eyes circled in blood
He looks overworked, drinks coffee
His desk is swamped with files
'  (
) have voiced the same concerns to our law enforcement officials, and they assure me he is of the highest caliber
Mills looks to a t
v
on a table, picks up a remote, increases the volume
On the screen,  , 47, source of the voice, stands before reporters
He's a powerful presence, with a gold tooth in the front of his mouth
(
) (from t
v
) As District Attorney, don't you feel some responsibility
Detective David Mills lacks the experience
(
) (from t
v
) 've always said
've always said, don't send a boy to do a man's job
Mills is hanging on every word
(
,) But, David Mills has a sterling record with the Philadelphia force
stand behind him one hundred percent
(relieved) You tell 'em boss
Detective David Mills is a wonderful human being
(
) However
however
let me say this
Mills looks back at the television
(
,) If Detective Mills, at any point in this investigation
if he is not pulling his weight,  will be the first in line to pull his plug
Mills points the remote, turns the t
v
off as reporters crowd Talbot
Mills stares at the blank screen, dispirited
Across the room, Tracy stands in the doorway
Mills does not see her
He looks at the photocopy and sits at his desk
Tracy watches him, great concern in her sad eyes
' / -- Somerset walks through this vast artist's studio, a converted warehouse space filled with canvases
It's clear the works at the underground art gallery were William's
William climbs a ladder to a loft storage space
He moves cautiously, like he's not quite up to the task
always figured that's the only reason you and  used to be friends
Because was a friend of hers
William yanks a painting wrapped in dusty paper, climbs down
() Speaking of which
William hands the painting to Somerset, walks to a director's chair facing a paint-splashed canvas on an easel
He is a used- up man, bound in an apathy-induced haze
He sits, picks up a squeeze bottle of orange paint from a table of supplies
() painted that about five years ago always told myself 'd give it to you next time  saw you
Somerset starts unwrapping the painting
William "paints," using the squeeze bottles and by flicking saturated brushes so that the paint flies against the canvas
Most times, he's not even looking at the canvas or colors he's using
He looks over his shoulder at Somerset
() Things are different these days, pal
You wouldn't believe it
Somerset looks at the unwrapped painting and is hit by a swell of memories
Horribly sad memories
It's a portrait in oils of a pretty, red-headed woman
William shoots red paint with one hand, concentrates on lighting a filterless cigarette with the other
() People buy my paintings now
they drive down in their BMWs and Rolls Royces
It's the new money generation
guess they think they're touching the avant-garde
William looks at his creation, then calmly kicks the easel over
() There's another thousand dollar William McCracken expression of anarchy
William gets up, walks across the wet canvas, leaving footprints
He looks down at what he's done
() Make that two thousand
He laughs
Somerset holds up the delicately rendered portrait
How is she
Have you seen her recently
Huh
oh
No
She moved out of the city
Last winter
She married some businessman, or something like that
Somerset fights the anguish this causes, puts the painting down
Good for her
(pause) 'm leaving soon myself
'm finally getting out
Yeah
What happened to the idealistic super-cop  used to know
He became a realist
William grunts, flicks his cigarette away, takes out a bag of pills
He palms a few, notices the judgment in Somerset's eyes
Oh
sorry
William turns his back to Somerset, pops the pills
Out of sight, out of mind
Somerset is disappointed, disgusted
(sarcastic) Not that  don't appreciate your recent artistic endeavors
but, what happened to the painter  used to know
William smiles like a dolt, laughs a little
can't remember
' / -- Color photos of the first and second murder sit on a drawing table
The top photos are like establishing shots, each taking in the entire display the murderer created
William examines with Somerset looking over his shoulder
Man
can  buy these from you
They're not for sale
Somerset lays out photos of the notes, triangle and circle: () What is it
What's the murderer trying to say
William narrows his eyes
Does not know
() What picture is he painting
(figuring) Wait a minute
William has an idea
He ambles over to a row of cabinets where oversized art books are stacked
He hunts through a pile, shoves some books aside
() 've seen things like that
Where
William keeps digging, finds one book, finds another
He opens one as he walks back to the drawing table
It's church stuff
Christianity
William lays a book down, finds a page
He opens it to Somerset
There is a circle to the side of the text
It says under the circle
Somerset creases his brow, turns the page
William opens another book
() When it first started
Christian artwork was all from Bible stories
It was like
nobody had any imagination
It was all
standardized
William pages through and we catch glimpses of the bizarre, worlds of Hieronymus Bosch
Horrifying religious visions
(
,) But, later, everyone started painting to tell their own stories
to teach lessons
Guys like Bosch, Bregel the elder
Van Eycks
William shoves the open book to Somerset
Somerset looks: Seven paintings in a circular pattern showing characters giving in to sins
Wicked, grotesque people
Somerset turns the book to examine each painting right side up
(
) The seven deadly sins
(
) That's what these murders remind me of
Paintings like these
(points) Gluttony
greed
(
) Envy, wrath, pride, lust and sloth
Seven deadly sins
Amen, brother
William goes to continue pulling other books
() can find more examples
There's lots of paintings like those
painted over hundreds of years
(moves books) And you're right
that murderer is an artist
Somerset is chilled by all this, immersed in the Bosch book
And, it's two down
five to go
,   -- bright, tawdry intersection
Neon swirls and circuit-bulbs on porno theatres provide the flash
Cars, taxies, and barkers urging sexual indulgence from doorways provide the noise
The streets and sidewalks are crowded with lonely humans, mostly men, looking around, sizing up promises made on porno placards: ,  ,  , etc
The usual contingent of abnormal cretins wanders in the crowd, looking for someone to hurt
through the crowds
Meet , a balding, middle-aged man, wearing thick glasses
There is not a single thing strange or unusual about his appearance
him as he walks
He's nervous, looking at the porno palaces
His sweaty hand clutches a Bible tight against his chest
He doesn't feel comfortable being here
John walks to a corner, waits for the light so he may cross grotesque   approaches waving his own Bible
People walk away from him, so he confronts John
are you, Sir
Is Jesus Christ your Lord and Master
Do you believe in Him
John tries to ignore, traffic blocking his escape
() (pleading) Don't ignore me
Listen to what  have to say
Christ can be your savior
(quiet anger) Leave me alone
Think about God, sir
can help you let Him into your life
Finally the light changes
John turns and spits in the preacher's face
The preacher recoils as John crosses quickly
John hurries between cars in the crosswalk
The preacher curses from the corner, his voice drowned out in traffic
,   -- People pass on the sidewalk
John is amongst them, but he stops, looking up at something offscreen
He's looking at a bright red storefront adorned with red neon: Massage parlor
The Hot House's  notices John's interest
Interesting isn't it, friend
You like that, you like girls, then come on in
John doesn't hear the barker
Steps up to study fading pictures of naked women massaging happy men
Nudity
() You'll see a lot more inside
You'll see a lot more than that
John's just looking, his face bathed in bright red light, the neon reflected in his thick glasses
'  ,  -- Somerset, holding more than an armful of art books and novels, pounds on the apartment door
Tracy opens it with the chain on
Can  help you
She takes a second to drink Somerset in
Somerset is surprised, having expected Mills
Tracy is so exquisite that he falters
Uh
was looking for Mills
David, mean
He's not here right now
Somerset tries not to drop any books while he digs up his badge
Mrs
Mills, my name is Somerset
If could leave these books for him
(undoes chain) Please, come in
' ,  / -- Tracy leads Somerset into the disarray of the apartment
David went for a walk
To clear his head
Oh, you can put those here
Thank you
Tracy motions and Somerset puts the books on Mills' desk
He starts looking through one book, checking paperclipped pages
() Could you tell him
tell him this is his reading assignment
It's urgent
've marked the most important pages
Would you like some coffee, or a drink
David should be back any minute
do have to get going
Somerset sees a medal encased in glass on the desk amongst pens and pencils
He picks it up: it's a medal for valor from the Philadelphia Police Department
At least  got to meet you
David has told me a lot about you
Really
Good things,  hope
Oh, yes
He said you were very smart
Really
think he's a bit intimidated by you
Somerset thinks about this, finds it hard to believe
He goes through his pocket, pulls out a notepad and some paper scraps
'm going to leave him a list of specifics
It all relates to the case he's on
He lays the various scraps and receipts aside on the desk, sits to start writing on the notepad
Tracy goes to the kitchenette to get a chair
You two aren't working together anymore
Isn't that so
To be perfectly honest, Mrs
Mills
Tracy
Tracy
David and  weren't exactly what you could call fast friends
That's too bad
Tracy brings the chair over by the desk and sits
Somerset looks up from his writing
doubt your husband shares that opinion
Tracy nods, leaning forward, semi-conspiratorially
You know, Somerset, David is very
determined
'm sure you've seen, it's not likely he'll ever be compared to Gandhi
He's a good cop
He just
He sees policework as a crusade
That's what he wants it to be, and, that might sound naive, but he's made a conscious choice to be naive
(pause) Believe me, his heart's in the right place
Somerset pauses, enchanted by her
hear you and he were high school sweethearts
Yeah
Pretty hokey, huh
But, what girl wouldn't want the captain of the football team as their lifelong mate
It's rare these days
that kind of commitment
guess so
Tracy's smile falters a bit
Somerset notices this
He breaks from her spell, turns to continue writing
Well
this will only take a minute
Take your time
Somerset writes
Tracy looks over the stack of books: Titles on the spines: ,     , , etc
Hardcover novels: '  and Tracy stands to look at the novels on top, then sees the pile of paper scraps from Somerset's pocket
She picks up the piece of wallpaper with the pale red rose at its center
() What is this
Somerset looks up
Sees her holding the paper rose
He takes it, slightly self-conscious, looks at it
My future
Tracy tilts her head, looking at Somerset
You have a strange way about you, Somerset
mean in a good way
unusual
Somerset doesn't know what to say
He pockets the paper rose
() apologize
'll get out of your hair
Tracy stands, takes the chair back to the kitchenette
() It's just
it's nice to hear a man who talks like that
If David saw that paper, he'd say you're acting like a homosexual
That's how he is
(mock indignation) Well
guess  won't be showing this to him then
suppose not
Somerset continues writing
Tracy sits at the kitchenette table, watches him
-- -- It's raining hard
Mills exits the morgue building with a few art books and a paper cup of coffee
He holds one art book over his head as he dashes through deep puddles in the street
'  -- Mills gets in, puts his coffee on the dash and tosses the art books in a box
He closes the door
Alone with the sound of the rain
He wipes water off his face, looks at his tired eyes in the rearview mirror
He reaches in the box of books, takes out copies of The Canterbury Tales and Dante's Purgatory
He makes a face, opens Dante's Purgatory: ------------------------------------------------------------- |                                           | |-------------------------------------------------------- /\  | |                                                        /  \ | |                                The Lustful         /____\| |                                                      /      | |                                 The Gluttonous    /_______| |       7                                  /        | |                                  The Avaricious  /         | |                                   and Prodigal   /__________| |                                        /           | |                                                /            | |                                               /             | |                              The Slothful  /______________| |                                             /               | |                                            /                | |                                           /                 | |                      The Wrathful     /__________________| |                                         /                   | |                       The Envious    /____________________| |                                       /                     | |                        The Proud    /______________________| |                                     /                       | |                                    /                        | |                                   /                | |                                  /                          | |                                 /                | |                                /                            | |_______________________________/_____________________________| Mills turns to a bookmark, rests the book on the steering wheel

Good work

Inside: Cliff Notes for Dante's Purgatory and The Canterbury Tales
() Thank God
, '  -- It still rains outside
Somerset enters, stops to notice painted on the door where his name used to be
He walks, sees all his belongings have been moved from his desk and piled on a small temporary desk in the corner
Somerset sits at the temporary desk, starts organizing the files and papers
Mills enters carrying the box of books
How's it coming
Great
Mills puts the box on the large desk
They both settle in, attending to their work
Two men, about five feet apart, each trying not to acknowledge the other's presence
Mills takes out his Cliff Notes, looks to see Somerset is occupied, hides them in a desk drawer
Somerset finishes one form, flips it and looks up
There's a chalk board nailed to the wall
On the chalkboard:     1 gluttony(x)    5 wrath 2 greed(x)       6 pride 3 sloth          7 lust 4 envy The
Both men look at it
Phone  again
It's your name on the door
Mills picks up
Somerset returns to his work

(lowers voice) Honey,  asked you not to call unless
(listens) What
why
Okay
okay
Hold on
Mills is confused
He holds the phone out to Somerset
() It's my wife
Somerset looks quizzical
Mills shrugs
Somerset takes it
(into phone) Hello
(listens) Yes, well
appreciate the thought, but
(listens) Well,  guess 'd be delighted to
Thank you
goodbye
Somerset gets up, hangs up, puzzled
Mills is waiting
Well
'm invited to have a late supper with you and your wife
And  accept
How's that
(sits back down) Tonight
Mills looks at the phone, lost
' ,  / -- record player on a moving box
There's a basketball game with   on the t
v
screen
Tracy, Mills and Somerset eat at the kitchen table
Mills has a beeper by his beer and occasionally fingers it absently
Why aren't you married, Somerset
Tracy
What the hell
Somerset adjusts his napkin on his lap, thinking
was close
It just didn't happen
It surprises me you're not married
It really does
Any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me
disagreeable
Just ask your husband
No argument
Mills grins, but he means it
he sips beer
The conversation lapses into long silence
Somerset concentrates on his plate
Tracy looks at Mills, who eats while watching the basketball game
(to Somerset) How long have you lived here
Too long
Much too long
(drinks) What do you think of our fair city
You take the bad with the good, suppose
It's
it's
It takes time to settle in
Tracy looks at Mills
Somerset can see it is a sore subject
(to Tracy) You'll get used to it pretty quickly
There are things in any big city that stand out at first
But
is  as plates begin to rattle and clatter
Subway train
It's right below us/ The dishes clatter more
Coffee cups clink against their saucers
Tracy holds her cup to stop it, tries to act like it is nothing, but she is clearly bothered
() It'll go away in a minute
They wait
The t
v
picture goes fuzzy
The  grows , knocks something over in the sink
Mills continues eating
Somerset fiddles with his food
The record player skips, then plays on
The  finally  , till everything is normal
(uncomfortable) This real estate guy
a real scum, brought us to see this place a few times
And, it was nice enough, and the price was right
was thinking it was nothing, but  started to notice, he kept hurrying us along
mean what could it be
Why would he only show it like five minutes at a time, before he'd hustle us out the door
Mills laughs, lamely
We found out the first night
Somerset tries to stay straight, but he can't help laughing
'm sorry
it's a nice apartment
He pulls himself together, but only for a moment
He can't stop it, laughs harder, covering his mouth
Tracy and Mills laugh
(sighs) Oh, fuck
' ,  / -- The record player spins a different album,
Tracy's clearing the last dishes into the sink
Mills and Somerset have beers
All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day
don't think 've ever met anyone who didn't have a television
Tracy takes a pot of coffee to the table and pours
That's weird
It's un-American
Somerset shrugs
() What about sports
What about them
Tracy brings over a plate of cookies and puts it on the table
You go to movies at least
read
Remember reading
What's the last book you read, Mills
Guide
Mills laughs
Burps
he turns to Tracy
() Excuse me
(to Somerset) just have to say,  can't respect any man who's never seen Green Acres
Somerset gives a blank stare
Tracy walks away
() You've never seen The Odd Couple
The Flintstones
vaguely recall Wilma, and someone named
Dino
Across the room, Tracy turns the t
v
and the record player off
She goes into the bedroom, shuts the door behind her without a word
Somerset and Mills turn to the closed door
They look at each other, then sit for a time
Somerset drinks coffee
Mills drums his fingers on his beeper
Big silence
'  ,  -- Mills walks up the creaky stairs
He carries his briefcase, a six-pack and art books
Somerset follows, reading a case file
We think he acted like he was delivering a package
The doorman at Mr
Gold's building says he doesn't even look at anyone who goes in anymore
Mills opens a door to the roof -- '  ,  -- Mills and Somerset walk onto the roof
It is a spectacular view on all sides
Miles of city lights
Breathtaking
of the  reach them
No connection between the two victims
Mills shakes his head, unloads what he's holding onto a rusty table
He sits in one of two lawn chairs
Somerset sits across from him
() No witnesses of any kind
None
Which  can't understand
It's like this guy's invisible
In this city, minding your own business is a perfected science
Somerset takes a picture from the file, the drawing of the sun with an eye at its center
He opens a book,  , which is full of illustrations
He starts paging through
() At the precinct, Sunday nights, they offer a public crime prevention course
And, the very first thing they teach is that you should never scream "help" if you're in trouble
Scream "fire
" Because people don't want to get caught up in anything
But, a fire
that's entertainment
They come running
Somerset holds the books up to Mills, points to a picture of the sun and eye, same as the drawing Mills found
() "The Sun in Splendor with the Eye
"  It refers to God the father, and to Saint Thomas Aquinas
Which saint is he
Aquinas wrote a summary of theology, Summa Theologica
And he wrote about the seven deadly sins
Mills takes the book and looks it over
() Now, what else have you got
Look,  appreciate being able to talk this out, but
it's my case
So
satisfying my curiosity
'm still leaving town on Sunday
Mills is pondering, very tired
He unlatches his briefcase, takes a photocopy of the photo of the falsely pretty woman and hands it to Somerset
The eyes were circled
With Mr
Gold's blood
This is his wife
(nods) She was away on business
She got back the day he was killed
If this means she saw anything,  don't know what
We've questioned her about ten times
And, if it's a threat
We put her in a safe house
This is the one thing
know
-- Two twenty-story tenement buildings stand practically underneath the span of a bridge
The streets are littered with garbage
Teenagers stand in cliques in front of a liquor store
Cars pass slowly,    out
Under the bridge, in shadow, a car is parked between two dumpsters
The trunk is open
The trunk is full of cardboard boxes which are in turn full of tall, orange candles
Hundreds of candles
leans in under the trunk's bulb, opens a leather pouch and checks the contents: plastic bottle of prescription pills
bottle of aspirin hypodermic needle filled with liquid
Lastly, many jars of baby food:  ,  ,  , etc
,  -- John climbs the stairs holding the leather case and a closed shoebox
He wears clip-on sunglasses, a hat pulled low, a thin overcoat on his plump body
,  -- John comes from the stairwell door, looks, walks up the hall
The walls are graffitied
The soiled floor is wet in spots
and   are  from behind closed doors
John comes to apartment 303
He's winded from the climb
He takes out keys, lets himself in
Closes the door
'  ,  -- Somerset stands at the edge, holding the photo of Mrs
Gold
He puffs on a cigarette, looks out at the city lights
It's like he's preaching
(pause) The sins were used in medieval sermons
There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, as a learning tool
The sins distract man from true worship
True faith
Mills is seated at the table with art books open
breeze fans the pages of the books
The flipping pages reveal views of heaven, hell, adoration, crucifixion and sin
Like in these paintings, and in Dante's Purgatory, right
But, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy climb that big mountain
Seven Terraces of Purgation
Anyway
pride comes first, not gluttony
And in all the paintings, the sins are in a different order can't find a pattern
Because there's creativity in the mix
Consider these books as the murderer's inspiration
Or aspiration
Somerset drops his cigarette to the empty street, watching the glowing tip fall
He looks at the woman's circled eyes
() He sees himself contributing to the body of Christian work
He's punishing these people
For all of us to see and learn from
These murders are like forced attrition
What
Forced what
Attrition
When you regret your sins, but not because you love God
Because someone's holding a gun on you
Somerset thinks
He walks from the edge to Mills
When Mr
Gold's wife found the body, about how long was she in the apartment
She didn't find it
The door to the apartment was open and a neighbor
thought you said she found the body
When she got back from a business trip
No
She got back after you and  had already been there
Somerset thinks, coming up with something
() What
Somerset holds up the photo of Mrs
Gold
Maybe she is supposed to see something
she just hasn't had a chance to see it yet
-- The room is like a bland hotel room
Mills stands beside He shows her photos from the murder scene
Mrs
Gold is crying
Somerset stands across the room
Please, look for anything strange or out of place
Anything at all
don't understand
Why now
Mills helps her go through the photos
He is shaken himself, not wanting to put her through this
need your help if we're going to get the guy who killed your husband
If there's anything in these pictures
Mrs
Gold sobs quietly, wipes her tears
don't see anything
Are you absolutely sure
can't do this now
please

Mills looks at Somerset
Somerset holds other photos
We have to show her those
There might be something she's missing
Somerset looks at the photos in his hand, hesitant
These photos show Mr
Gold's corpse, not covered in any way
Have her look one last time
Wait
Here
here's something
What is it
Mrs
Gold points at the constructivist painting on the wall in one photo
The painting is an abstraction of colored squares
This painting
in the living room
What
Why is it hanging upside-down
Mills jerks his head to look at Somerset
Big score
/ ,   -- This is where the greed murder took place
Somerset and Mills are taking the constructivist painting off the wall
Nothing on the wall behind the painting
Blank space
Nothing
This has got to be it
Somerset puts the painting down, resting it on its bottom edge
The frame is backed by a thick sheet of brown paper
He points to where the wire used to be screwed into the frame, and to where it has been re-screwed
() It has to be
He changed the wire to rehang it
Somerset tears along the edge of the brown paper to get to the space between it and the canvas
He tears out the entire sheet
Mills helps pull it away, but there's nothing there
Empty
Mills looks at both sides of the paper, then tosses it away
It's nothing
Somerset pays the painting down, face up
He pokes his finger on the painted surface
Mills watches as Somerset kneels, takes out a credit card and presses it's edge against the canvas, trying to peel up some of the paint
() Give it up
The killer didn't paint the fucking thing
Somerset pushes the painting away, stands, frustrated
() He fucked us
Somerset backs away from the wall, staring at the space where the painting hung
There is only a nail
He stares intently, then turns and walks out of the room
Mills holds his hands to his temples, furious
can be from the other room, going through drawers, dropping things
is
Mills grabs a lamp and throws it on the floor
() Son of a bitch
Somerset comes back in, holding something
He steps over the lamp and goes to the blank wall space
() What
Bear with me
Mills watches
Somerset has a woman's make-up compact in hand
He opens it, uses the soft brush to begin applying the red rouge powder to the wall around the nail
(incredulous) Oh, yeah, sure
You got to be kidding
Shut up and wait
Somerset brushes with wider strokes
He blows, leans very close to the wall to study the powder
Leans closer still
Pause
() Call the print lab
Now
' ,  -- Tracy is asleep with lights on
She stirs, opens her eyes
'  -- Tracy opens the door, enters
It's quiet
She sees Mills and Somerset are gone
She's all alone
Unhappy
' ,   -- Through the window, we can see into the bedroom
Tracy comes back from the living room
She goes to her side of the bed, kneels
She reaches between the mattress and bedspring, takes out a paperback book she has hidden there
She comes to the window, opens it and climbs out onto the fire escape
She sits, dangles her feet through the metal bars
She opens the book and tries to read by the street light, resting her head against the railing
is distantly
Tracy looks down the empty street, unsettled
The woman is not heard again
Tracy lays back, looks at the sky, holding herself
We can now see the title of the book:
There is a picture of a baby on the cover
Tracy cries, quietly
/ ,   -- uses a magnifying glass to study a very clear fingerprint in black powder on the wall
Oh, boy
(
) Talk to me
The forensic bites his lip, still studying
Mills and Somerset watch the forensic who works offscreen
() (to Somerset) Listen, honestly
have you ever seen anything like this
Been involved in anything remotely like this
No
have not
(
) Well,  can tell you this, detectives
The forensic steps down from a stool
Behind him, where the painting once was, there are fingerprints, clear and distinct
The prints have been left side by side, to form letters which form the words:
() just by studying the underloop
these are not the victim's prints
,   -- Dark
sits before an old computer
The computer's green screen shows fingerprints being aligned, compared and then rejected; whir - click - whir - click - whir - click
Mills and Somerset watch, bathed in the green glow
It doesn't work for me
can't believe he wants us to help him stop
Who the hell knows
There's plenty of schizoids out there doing dirty deeds they don't want to do
With tiny voices whispering nasty things in their ears
Somerset doesn't buy it
The technician adjusts a knob
've seen this baby take three days to finish a cycle, so you guys can go cross your fingers somewhere else
,  -- Somerset and Mills come from the print lab
janitor is mopping the hall
The computer is onwards
Somerset sits with a groan on a couch outside the door
Mills flops beside him
You really meant what you said to Mrs
Gold
You really believe we'll get him, don't you
And you don't
wish  still thought like you
'm so far gone from that
So, tell me what you think we're doing
All we do is pick up the pieces
We take all the evidence
all the pictures, statements
Write everything down and note what time things happened
We take it all, make a nice, neat pile and file it away
Just in case it's ever needed in a courtroom
You're unbelievable
In my entire life, you're the oldest man 've ever met
've seen even the most promising clues lead to dead ends
Hundreds of times
've seen the same
'm not the country hick-boy you seem to think  am
Somerset takes out a cigarette and lights it
In this city, if all the skeletons came out of all the closets
if every un- revenged corpse were to suddenly rise and walk again, there would be no more room for the living
Mills slumps back, crosses his arms, closes his eyes to sleep
Don't try to tell me you didn't get that rush tonight
that adrenalin
Like we were getting somewhere
(pause) And, don't try to tell me it was because you thought we found something that would play well in a courtroom
Somerset looks at Mills, puffs the cigarette
The computer is heard: whir - click - whir - click
-- ,  -- Our detectives are fast asleep on the couch, leaning against each other
People pass and look at them strangely
Wake up, Glimmer Twins
We have a winner
,   -- windowless classroom
The captain stands in front with a white screen at his side
The face of a black man, 25, , is projected on the screen from a slide projector
His street name is Zero, as some of you know
His prints were found at the scene by Detectives Mills and Somerset
hardened  , four men, one woman, sit in chairs facing the captain
They all wear bullet-proof vests with "" stencil-painted across them
Somerset and Mills sit in back, drinking coffee, still trying to wake up
() Now, Zero has a long, long history of mental illness
Serious illness
He was all over your television sets two years ago after he raped and killed a seventy-three year old woman
He got off, as the saying goes, on a technicality
So we watched him on the streets, and he went out of circulation about a year ago
If he disappeared, what do you want from us
His last place of residence is still in his name
search warrant is being pushed through the court as we speak
red-headed cop, , 28, raises his meaty hand
So, have the housing cops walk up and ring the doorbell
Problem solved
The cops laugh
The captain clenches his jaw
Listen, California
When you go in, if Zero isn't home, some of his buddies might be house-sitting
And besides using, Zero deals, so, you will be very uninvited guests
There is chatter among the cops
Somerset leans to Mills while the captain continues the briefing
Does not seem like our killer, does it
You tell me
'm new in town
Zero does possess the requisite degree of insanity
but, he doesn't have the desire somehow
Our killer seems to have more purpose
More purpose than Zero could ever conceive of
We'll tag along
Somerset wants no part of that
Why would we
Satisfy our curiosity
'  -- Mills drives, follows a police van
Somerset rides shotgun
Mills is pumped, ready
Somerset takes one Rolaids tablet off a fresh roll and chews it
You ever take one
Somerset pulls out his gun, checks the load
No
Never in twenty-four years
took my gun out only five times with the actual intention of using it
never fired it
Not once
pulled it once, fired it once never took a bullet
And
Mills turns a corner, tires screeching
It was my first one of these
We were a secondary unit, in vice
was pretty shaky going in
When we busted the door, looking for a junkie, the fucking guy opened fire
One cop was hit in the arm
He went flying
like in slow motion
(pause) remember riding in the ambulance
His arm was like
a piece of meat thought, it's just his arm
But, he bled to death right there anyway
pause
Somerset opens the window, feels the air on his face
How did the fire-fight end
Well,  was doing really good in Philly up till then
Lots of simple busts
've always had this weird luck
but, this was wild
(pause) got that fuck with one shot
right between the eyes
And the next week, the mayor's pinning a medal on me
Picture in the paper, the whole nine yards
How was it
expected it to be bad, because  heard about other guys
You know
took a human life
But,  slept like a baby that night
Somerset eats another antacid
think Hemingway wrote somewhere can't remember where, but he wrote that, in order to live in a city, you have to have the ability to kill
think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, to survive
Sounds like he knew what he was talking about
,  -- Crack vials and hypodermic needles crunch under heavy boots
The five cops from the briefing, fully geared up, rifles and handguns held, move quickly up the stairs, single-file
Somerset and Mills follow, guns out
Somerset is sweating bullets
Mills is juiced
,  -- The cops enter the dank hallway, the same hall we saw John in before
They move cautiously, stepping over a drunken, helpless man
door opens and a woman peeks out
The female cop points her gun and the woman obeys, slamming the door
California leads, steps up to apartment 303
He has a search warrant scotch-taped to the front of his bullet-proof vest
(to black cop) This is it
Give it up
black cop hoists a battering ram
The other cops get on both sides of the door
Mills moves front
Somerset hangs back
() Police
Open the door
The black cop brings the ram forward with a splintering thud
The door flies open
The cops storm in
,   -- The cops charge down a short hall into this incredibly dusty room
bed sits against a far wall
Mills and California move up to the bed
Someone lies under an indigo blanket
Three other cops move, training their weapons on the bed
Good morning, Sweetheart
blond cop goes into another room
Mills kicks the bed
Get up now, motherfucker
Now
,   -- The blond cop enters, gun trained, looks around in confusion
The room's tables, chairs and floor are covered with hundreds of colorful, plastic air fresheners
,   -- Somerset moves in, looks around
He notices the area around the bed, the ceiling, walls and floor, has been painted indigo, while the rest of the room is its original white
On a wall, a white sheet is pinned up with a square drawn on it in excrement
said get up, Sleepyhead
Mills pulls the indigo blanket off the bed, reveals the shriveled, sore-covered form of a black man who is blindfolded and tied to the bed with a thin wire wrapped time and time again around the bed
Tubes lead from the stained loincloth around the man's waist and snake under the bed
The victim is partially covered by what seem to be piles of black spaghetti
Oh, fuck me
Somerset pushes past the cops who recoil from the stench
Holy shit
Sloth
it's sloth
The black cop touches the black spaghetti
Holds a piece
What the hell
those are dead worms
(to Somerset) Check this out, dick
California points with his gun to the end of the black man's right arm
The hand is gone, severed at the wrist long ago
It's him
It's Zero
Someone call an ambulance
Someone call a hearse, more like
The female cop has gone to the wall where the sheet is pinned up
She pulls the sheet aside and finds: fifty-two polaroid pictures; all pictures of Zero tied to the bed, with a date written at the bottom of each
it is a visual history of Zero's physical decay
The blond cop enters from the other room
What the fuck is going on
Hey, California
Get your people out
Somerset takes out rubber gloves and puts them on
You heard him
Hit the hall, and don't touch anything
The other cops file out as Mills goes to examine the polaroids under the sheet
Somerset replaces the sheet over Zero's body
California stays by his side
() It looks like he's some kind of friggin' wax sculpture
Somerset places his finger along Zero's throat
Somerset, you
you better look here
Mills studies the polaroids
Somerset walks to join him
() All pictures of Zero tied to the bed
(crouches) The last one's dated three days ago
Somerset looks at the first photo
In it, Zero is bound and gagged, but he is fit, healthy
(awed) The first photo
it's dated one year ago
Almost to the day
California lifts Zero's blanket to peek under, examining with morbid curiosity
Mo-ther
Mills kneels and lifts the bottom of the sheet off the floor, finds an open shoebox
On the box:
What's this
California leans close to Zero's gaunt, blindfolded face
You got what you deserved, Zero
Somerset leans down beside Mills
Mills looks through the shoebox
Inside are plastic, zip-lock bags
One bag contains small clumps of hair, one contains a yellow liquid
urine sample
hair sample
fingernail clippings
He's laughing at us
California is still close to Zero's face when suddenly Zero's lips twist
Zero lets out a loud, guttural bark
California jerks back in fear, shouting, falling over a chair
Mills and Somerset reel, standing
They see California on the ground, scared out of his mind, pointing
He's alive
Mills and Somerset look towards the bed
Zero's lips move feebly as he lets out a sick, gurgling moan
He's still alive
-- crowd has gathered
Mills' car, the police van and two ambulances are parked on the sidewalk
,  -- The siege cops are in the hall, holding neighbors at bay
,   -- Three ambulance attendants are at the bed, working on Zero
One attendant uses wire-cutters to clip Zero's bonds
,  -- Mills and Somerset stand in the middle of one flight of stairs
They are both highly agitated
The way this has gone,  didn't think it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy
The type of intestinal fortitude it must take
to keep a man bound for a full year
To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints
want him bad
don't just want to catch him anymore
want to hurt him
Listen
we have to divorce ourselves from our emotions here
We have to keep focusing on the small details
don't know about you, Somerset, but feed off my emotions
He'll string us along all the way if we're not careful
Mills is looking at the floor, burning with anger
Somerset grabs him by the jacket
() Are you listening to me
Mills pushes Somerset's hand off
hear you
There is a sudden brilliant flash of light and the  of a Mills and Somerset look -- Down the stairs, John is posing as a reporter
He has his camera and flash up, pointed at the detectives
Say cheese
He takes another picture, flashbulb flashing
Mills charges downwards, grabs John by his wrinkled clothing
What the fuck are you doing
John squirms, holds up a laminated  identification pass
have a right, Officer
Mills shoves him and John stumbles a few steps, then falls to the landing below with a thud
His glasses fly off
That doesn't mean anything
This is a closed crime scene now
Somerset steps down and pulls Mills back
John stands
You can't do this
You can't
Get the fuck out of here
John gets his glasses, scrambles downstairs, out of sight
(
) The public has a right to know
Somerset yanks Mills harder, till Mills sits on the stairs
How do those cockroaches get here so quick
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well
You can hate them, but you better give them something, or they'll make it all up
(calming) 'm sorry
just
Oh, it's alright
It's always impressive to see a man feeding off his emotions
-- Mills stands with the blase
, who reviews a medical chart on a clipboard
Zero lies inside an oxygen tent with tubes running into him
The room is dark
year of immobility seems about right, judging by the deterioration of the muscles and spinal cord
Blood tests show a whole smorgasbord of drugs in his system
Heroin
crack
even an antibiotic which was administered to keep the bed sores from infecting
Mills looks into the oxygen
He hasn't said anything, or tried to express himself in any way
Even if his brain were not mush, which it is
he chewed his own tongue off a long time ago
Mills winces, moves away from the bed
There's no way he'll survive
Detective, he'd die right now of shock if you were to shine a flashlight in his eyes
,   -- tall church on a bustling street
Smoggy air has eaten at the stonework
The homeless are camped out on the stairs
, '  -- The priest's accommodations are quite spacious and comfortable
The parish's wealth is evident
, 38, stands looking at several 8" by 10" glossies
He's dressed in his "civilian" clothing, wears his hair short and proper
These photos are making him heartsick
Bleeker hands them to Somerset who is seated by a fireplace
Put them away
wish you hadn't brought them into the church
needed for you to see them
Father Bleeker shakes his head, as if he were trying to forget the images
Somerset replaces the murder photos in a file
There were five principal phases in the development of early Christian art
From Hellenistic through the Renaissance
each period was affected by the decrees of religious leaders
If this killer belongs to a certain branch of the church
if he collects religious art from a certain period, want to know
have to narrow it down
Bleeker walks to an ornate, gold cabinet
He puts on a pair of cotton gloves
The influences on these
things he's done, couldn't have come before the Gothic period
What's in those pictures is presented far too asymmetrically
Bleeker crosses himself before using a key to open the cabinet
He takes out an ancient devotional book and a piece of cloth
() The colors will tell the tale
Bleeker takes the book to a table
Somerset follows
Bleeker lays the cloth under the book, opens the book, tenderly
() Each sin had a symbolic color
But the specific color designations changed throughout the ages
Somerset leans to examine Bleeker's illuminated manuscript: Two pages of prayer
The prose is elaborately formed, surrounded by colorful illustrations of the seven deadly sins
Bleeker's finger points to a rendering of a man seated on a rock, guzzling from a jug
It's been painted in orange
(
,) This is an example
Gluttony is the sin, and the color is orange
This particular manuscript is preserved from the 18th century
(
) In the murders, gluttony is green
Greed is yellow
Sloth is indigo
Bleeker steps away and Somerset gets closer to the pages
So, if this murderer is as precise as you say, then you need to find out at what period in history was gluttony green
and so on
Where do  look
If the colors changed so often
(contemplates) There is one man
Father Stone
(pause) haven't heard from him for quite some time
This was his passion
He spent his life studying the sins
and preaching against them

Zero's landlord said an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month
He says, quote, " never heard a single complaint from this guy and nobody ever complained about him
He's the best tenant  ever had
" There's a landlord's dream tenant paralyzed man with no tongue
Who pays his rent on time
Bring me everything as soon as it's transcribed
The officer leaves
Mills starts sorting through piles on his desk
He doesn't know where to begin
He sits back in his chair, looks at the collage-like collection of pictures pinned on the walls: photos and diagrams of the murder scenes, the drawing of the sun and eye, color pages and black and white copies of pages from art books
He stares, thinking
He stands, takes a photocopy off the wall
The killer's first note: Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to the light
(to himself) Milton
-- Big brass lamps hang from the high ceiling
Mahogany chairs and tables run down the center floor which is bordered by three levels of balconies
People wander like ants in an ant farm
Mills walks, taking it all in
He goes to the circulation desk
Impatient patrons wait in a long line
He watches the bored , female, 64, help an old man at the desk
She opens the old man's books, runs a laser pen over a bar code sticker, pushes a few buttons on a computer
,   -- Near the balcony railing, overlooking the main floor, Mills sits before a computer card catalog
He reads the computer screen, unsure
He sets down his pad and pencil, cracks his knuckles, begins typing on the keyboard
The computer gives off a quiet Pleased, Mills reads the screen
Types
On the screen:                  /  LOST_ He hits return
Reads the screen as information on the book appears
He copies it on his pad, puts the pencil in his mouth
He types
On the screen:       /   RIPPER_ Hits return
Again, he copies info from the screen
-- monk opens a formidable gateway door, letting Father Bleeker and Somerset into a garden courtyard
Bleeker now wears his priestly garb and collar
The monastery's main building looms at the end of a pathway
The building is stately, ivy-covered
Father Stone had a church and congregation of his own
But, he
there were some problems
The church is deserted now
Problems
Bleeker continues walking
() Father
,  -- The walls of the hallway are carved with images of saints
Bleeker whispers to Somerset beside a windowless door
There was a small orphanage attached to the church, overseen by Father Stone
This was almost thirty years ago
(hesitant) He was an excellent priest, devoted in every way
Many in his parish demanded his return
Tell me what happened
Bleeker sees a  down the hall, coming towards them
Allegations were made
Stone was accused of abusing the children in his care
But, those charges were never substantiated
What abuse
It was claimed
that the children were beaten
And, punished severely
The nun is too close for Bleeker to speak freely
, '  -- The door is unlocked and opened by the nun
Somerset enters and Bleeker waits outside as the nun closes the door
It's dark
, 73, is in a wheelchair
Feeble and frail, eyes sunken in their sockets
He looks up at Somerset
Father Stone
'm a policeman
'd like to ask you a few questions, if it's alright
The whites of Stone's eyes have yellowed
He seems to nod
Somerset sits on a stool, close
() want to ask you about the seven deadly sins
The sins
Yes, father
Stone reaches out a hand to touch Somerset's face
Stone's extremely long fingernails trail against Somerset's cheek and Somerset tries to hide his revulsion
Are you one of mine
don't
Are you saved
Do you have God
need to ask about the sins
Do you understand what 'm saying
Stone takes his hand away, seems to be getting angry
Are you a sinner
Stone's weak arms wheel him away, towards a corner
() There are sinners here
Even here
And, pain waits for them
Hell is hungry for them
Stone bites his lip, moaning, disoriented
() They don't realize
they don't know
(pause) Fuck them all
Somerset is shocked by the strength and volume of Stone's jagged voice
The nun goes to place a comforting hand on Stone's shoulder
Stone is beginning to cry
(to Somerset) They shouldn't have let you disturb him
This shouldn't have been allowed
Where are the children
(much louder) Where are the children
,  '  -- From a mahogany hallway lined with book-carts, we look  a big  into the head librarian's office
The elderly head librarian is at a computer, chain-smoking, working the keyboard
Mills alternates talking on the telephone and reading things off his pad to the librarian
We cannot hear them, but it's clear Mills is excited as he walks back and forth, hovering over the librarian, looking at her computer screen, making suggestions, then walking to monitor a dot-matrix printer which spews a waterfall of computer paper onto the floor
Back and forth goes Mills, carrying the phone
He closes the pad, puts it in his pocket
The librarian finishes typing, sits back, done
Mills hangs up the phone, goes to put it on the librarian's desk, but the cord drags, knocks a pile of books off a table
The librarian is irritated, goes to pick up the books
Mills is apologizing
He goes to watch the printer
He tears the last sheet's perforated edge, gathers the huge pile of printed paper off the floor
Prize in hand, Mills is so grateful he bends to give the old woman a kiss on the cheek, but she pushes him away, now even more annoyed
Mills goes to leave, knocks over another pile of books
Before he can assist, the angry librarian points to the door
Mills obeys like a scolded child, exits
The librarian shakes her head in disgust
/ -- once exemplary church, now boarded up, neglected
Gothic in style, it stands with deserted brownstones and empty lots of rubble as neighbors
Smokestacks spew smoke distantly
Cars and trucks drive by on a nearby elevated highway, but down here on the street it's a ghost town
There's a building attached to the rear of the church
Somerset's car is parked beside it
,  -- The windows are covered over
Somerset and Father Bleeker move through
Somerset has a flashlight with a wide beam
The room is empty except for broken, cob-web covered school desks and a few file cabinets
There are cracked blackboards on the walls
Rats skitter away from the light
Somerset opens a file cabinet drawer
It's empty
He walks to a door, starts pulling at the rotting boards which seal it shut
What are you looking for
'm just looking
-- Somerset pushes the door
He and Bleeker enter from the classroom into the far back corner of the church
Big church
Shafts of colored light needle through the holes in the pieces of wood and cloth that cover the broken stained glass windows
Somerset walks down the center aisle between deteriorated pews
rats run
Pigeons flap about, dirt drifting off their wings
Somerset shines his flashlight forward to the rather barren altar
To the right, at the top of the altar stairs, there is a stone statue of a saint with his arms outstretched, welcoming
The life-size saint is covered in spider-webs
Tiny spiders crawl across his eyes, which look down on Somerset
Saint Jerome Emiliani
The patron saint of orphans
Somerset shines the flashlight against the back altar wall, revealing a wooden carving of Christ crucified
Is this still the Lord's house
Of course it is
And, even if Father Stone was guilty of everything
if he was hurting children here
It's still the Lord's house
Father Bleeker finds this talk insulting and offensive
You have no faith, Somerset
Have you given up on the church entirely
No
(pause) That's not what 've given up on
Somerset notices two ends of a thick rope suspended from the ceiling above the center of the altar
He looks up, following the rope with the flashlight, when he notices something else
His mouth drops
Bleeker looks, and is equally horrified
Above them, in the beam of light: seven large paintings on panels tilted forward at the curve of the ceiling above the altar
Seven ancient paintings; seven deadly sins
The beam of light moves to the panel to the immediate right: a painting of a man kneeling, grasping at gold coins all around him
The man is naked, as was the victim of the greed murder
The chief color in this panel is a vulgar yellow
The third in the series is sloth
The painting, in indigo, shows a man at rest in a pliant bed
The skeletal man's eyes are rolled up in their sockets
He is covered in slimy worms
-- The streets are full of patrol cars
Cops and forensics enter and exit the church from various doorways
Saw-horses are loaded off a flat-bed truck as a police barricade is erected
-- Much activity, as forensics with flashlights go about their business, checking every nook and cranny of the church, looking for any sign that someone's been here recently
Small temporary floodlights are hoisted on tripods
Two photographers stand at the tops of tall ladders
Flash- photo after flash-photo is taken of the seven paneled tableau
Near the open church doors, Mills speaks with great animation, holding his ream of computer paper
Somerset looks at the altar and the tableau, preoccupied
Our guy's a bookworm, right
And, know it's a long shot, but you have to give a picture id and current phone bill to get a library card
Hey
Mills snaps his fingers in Somerset's face, gets his attention
() made two separate lists of books
One relating to the sins
Dante's Purgatory, Canterbury Tales
The Dictionary of Catholicism
all the religious stuff
The second list was books about torture methods, mass murderers
sadomasochism
Whatever our killer might study to do the things he's done
Whatever his other interests are
Somerset takes the computer list
So, what is this
Alright
Everything at the library goes into a computer
So, you can get in the system and cross-reference
Mills fumbles in his pocket, takes out his pad and reads
() Let's say you take, Dante's Purgatory, call number eight-five-one-, and
The Biography of the Marquis de Sade, ninety-two ---
Put those books in the system, and the computer can give you the name of anyone who's ever taken out both those books
And, it doesn't just give you their name and address, it gives you a complete history of their library reading habits
Mills slaps the list in Somerset's hand
() (psyched up) If somebody's out there reading Paradise Lost and studying The Life and Times of Charlie Manson,  want to talk to them
Somerset looks up from the list, warming to it
He starts looking around, searching for someone
-- Somerset and Mills exit down the stairs
Somerset's still searching, holding the list
He spies a uniformed cop,
Dario
Come here
Dario runs up
Somerset puts his hand on his shoulder and makes him walk with him
Mills continues on to his car
() According to the Father, this orphanage wasn't around for more than five or six years in the late fifties
So,  want someone to go to the Department of Child Welfare or City Hall and dig up all the records on this place
Understand
got it
Get a list of every child who attended this orphanage before it shut down
Get it on my desk within the hour
Somerset releases Dario, who runs to obey
Somerset goes to his own car
Mills is driving to leave, stops, revs the engine
Somerset hands the computer list through the window
() You thought of this all by yourself
This was your brainstorm
Yeah
Is that so hard for you to believe
It's a pleasant surprise
'm not as stupid as  look
Mills peels away
Somerset heads to his own car
(to himself) guess not
'  -- Seven large photos hang with the other materials on the wall: The seven tableau paintings
Gluttony, greed and sloth, followed by vanity
Vanity shows a woman standing in front of a mirror, staring at her image
The floor around her is scattered with flowers
The primary color is violet, and as in all the paintings, there is a quality of ugliness in the character
(
) Ramirez
Manuel Ramirez
(
) No
don't see any Ramirez
The lust painting is next
It shows a man standing over a woman
The woman is nude, under a sheet, and the man's features are bizarre, lecherous
He wants that woman
There are apples on the floor and on the bed
The color is red
(
) Elinski
Dennis Elinski
(
) No
Envy is particularly gruesome
The Devil is seen hovering in the air, wearing a crown, his body orange and slick, wrapped in a cloak of flames
His arms held high, his right hand grips a sword, a bolt of lightning, arrows, wheat, thistles, etc
His left hand, holds a plain globe around which a serpent has wrapped itself
He looks down at several pitiful mortals in a pit of fire
The mortals reach for him, yearn for him, the skin on their bodies is stretched taut over their bones
(
) Atwater
Paul Atwater
(
) No
Wrath shows a man surrounded by vaporous, satanic demons
He stands in a puddle of blood, looking at his hands stained with and dripping blood
Other than the rich red, the color is blue
Mills is at his desk, a good portion of the print-out list draped to the floor
He rubs his eyes, sighing, gets back to it
Somerset, at the temporary desk, studies his orphan list
Okay, here we go
Listen to the books this guy's been taking out
(reading list) Basic Homicide Investigation
Forensic Toxicology
The Encyclopedia of Modern Serial Killers
(looks up, excited) Of Human Bondage That's not what you think it is
Mills is disappointed, runs his finger further down the page
Holy shit
Somerset
(reading list) The Writings of Saint Thomas Aquinas
Mills points to the drawing of "the Sun in splendor with the eye" which hangs on the wall
() Aquinas
Right
That's right
Let me have it
Mills looks at the page
searching
Fuck
he used a false name
How do you know
His library card lists him as Jonathan Doe
John Doe
Mills sits back, angry
Something strikes Somerset as odd
Familiar
He starts leafing quickly through the orphanage list
() What
Somerset finds what he's looking for
Christ
it's like a sick joke
What are you talking about
There is one boy here
He was abandoned
no one knew who his parents were, so he was named at the orphanage
(looks at Mills) John Doe
It's his legal name
'  ,  -- Somerset and Mills climb stairs, turn a corner into this hall
It's impossible odds that this is him
We're focusing
know,  know
On one little thing
'm not complaining
'll follow anything we get and 'll take it any way we can get it
We'll look at him
Ask a few questions
Try to get a feeling whether we should keep tabs on him
They reach a door, apartment 3A
Somerset knocks
Mills takes out his gun and looks at Somerset to ask "what do you think
" Somerset nods that he should have the gun ready
Mills steps to the side of the door, knocks hard
Waits
(quietly) 'll do the talking, right
Let me practice here
um, excuse me Mr
Doe, but, are you by any chance a serial killer
Oh
oh, you are
Well, come with us then, if you don't mind
Mills smiles at his own wit
is offscreen
Mills turns to look towards the stairs
stands at the top of the stairs, wearing a hat, standing in shadows
The man looks at them, lets out a scream of horror and reaches into his coat
() Somerset
and a bullet slams into door 3A behind Mills
He and Somerset recoil in shock, going to the floor as another bullet explodes, blasting plaster off the wall
The man is back down the stairs
() It's him
Jesus Christ, we can get this fucker
Mills jumps up
He moves towards the railing
Somerset sits up and takes out his own gun
The stairwell is silent
Mills peers over the railing into the stairwell's center, gun pointed
is
Echoes
Mills leaps backwards as bullets begin raining up from below, accompanied by the  of an  -
Somerset lays flat as he and Mills crawl away from the railing, which is being shredded along with the floor around it
Bullets soar unceasingly
Mills and Somerset hold their hands over their ears
Pieces of wood and plaster fly everywhere
The uzi stops and the man can be   again
Mills gets up, covered in debris
He runs down into the smoky stairwell
Somerset rolls over, gets up more slowly
'  ,  -- Mills rushes out into this weedy, overgrown courtyard
He sees a thin vagrant sleeping on the building's junk-pile, then looks all directions
His eyes are wild
His gun hand is shaking
The courtyard is surrounded by alleyways
The shooter could have gone anywhere and is nowhere in sight
Somerset comes out, face wet with sweat
Mills holsters his gun
Are you alright
Are you okay
Yeah
think so
They look at each other for a long time
Both realizing they came very close to dying
'  ,  -- Police cars on scene
Curious civilians have gathered
'  ,  -- , several forensics are collecting shell casings, putting them in bags
The casings are scattered all the way up the stairs
walks up beside a
hear he's running around with an uzi in one hand and a book of poetry in the other
real, modern-day renaissance man, huh
, two forensics,  and , wait behind Mills and Somerset
Surgical gloves on all hands
Mills kicks at the door to apartment 3A with all his might
Again
' ,  -- -- door flies open
Mills enters with Somerset
Darkness
(to forensics) Give us first crack at it
Sarah and Billy wait in the hall
Somerset hits a switch on the wall and a lamp illuminates on a desk
The desk is in the center of the room, facing them
The walls, floor to ceiling, are covered with visual stimuli; pictures, paintings, newspaper articles, sketches, writings on napkins and notebook sheets, etc
Mostly religious images
The far wall is made of shelves full of books
Mills goes to the desk while Somerset goes to the books
Books: An Overview of Theology, Handbook of Firearms,  History of the World, Summa Theologica,
Criminal Law Review, etc
Mills looks at the desktop
The surface is marked by dried oil colors
There are tubes of paint laying out, boxes of water colors and pastels
Mills looks at one corner of the desk
An orange candle has been allowed to burn down
The wax trail goes all the way down the edge of the desk to a puddle on the floor
Somerset walks, studying one wall of pin-ups
There are articles about the seven deadly sins, pages from art books, pencil drawings of Satan and Christ, and drawings of the seven paneled tableau paintings which inspired the murders
Somerset lifts several sheets to note the paper scraps are spaced so tightly and completely that they cover the window
At the desk, Mills opens the top middle drawer
It's empty except for The Holy Bible
he opens another drawer, which is filled with at least forty empty aspirin bottles
Somerset looks at a door which is papered over by all the newspaper articles and photographs about the seven deadly sin murders
He opens the door -- ' ,   -- Somerset enters
The ceiling light is on
There are bookshelves on each wall, filled with thousands of notebooks
Somerset takes one notebook down
It is a thick composition book with a marbled black and white cover
Inside, the pages are covered in small handwritten sentences and drawings
Somerset takes down another notebook and opens it
Same as the first; scribbled sentences and sketches
He walks to another wall, pulls another notebook
Same deal
Jesus Christ
' ,   -- Mills opens a final drawer to find a rosary and a revolver
He looks around, nervous and excited, being in the murderer's lair
He goes to a closed door across the room, notices John Doe's bed in the corner
Sees Doe has a cross nailed to the ceiling directly above the bed's pillow
' ,  -- Mills enters the bathroom
It has been converted into a darkroom, lit by red bulbs, with strips of film hanging from the ceiling
is
Mills opens the shower curtain
Prints hang drying, clipped to wires over the tub
' ,   -- Somerset enters from the room of notebooks
This is John Doe's art studio
Windowless, with several easels holding paintings in various states of completion
The walls are covered with photos and finished canvases, except for one wall which is blank white
Somerset turns the lights off
There is a 16mm film projector on a table, facing the blank wall
Somerset turns the projector on
It clatters to life, running a piece of film
The film is spliced into a non-stop loop
Somerset watches the wall, light strobing across him
The projector shows an image of clouds drifting, with strange, superimposed angels in flowing robes floating jerkily
It's like an old, Hollywood version of heaven
The image switches abruptly to fire and tormented souls laboring around a pit of molten goo
Like Heaven, it's a scratched piece of film from Hollywood's early days
Somerset turns to examine one of the paintings on an easel
The painting has been skillfully rendered, in small, controlled brush strokes
It shows a modern city street, stylized, dark
The city is peopled by mutated humans and freakish beasts
Sinners in the streets, killing, raping, pillaging
Buildings are burning, blood is being spilled
It's dense with detail
Somerset walks to another painting which is covered by a drop cloth
He removes the cloth, uncovers a huge canvas
We do not see the painting, but when Somerset does his features turn grim
(
) Somerset
Mills enters, tormented, weary
He stands in the projector's bright beam, holds an 8" by 10" print
(
) Somerset, we had him
Goddamn it
He hands a press pass and the photo to Somerset
() The pass is a fake
we had him
Somerset looks at the photo, a picture of Mills and Somerset on the stairwell of the slum apartment building; the picture John took when he posed as a reporter
() We were that close to him
know
Somerset motions to the huge canvas
Mills looks: The painting is frightening collage, thick with paint
The photo of Mills and Somerset has been incorporated in bits and pieces
Duplicate images: enlarged eyes, hands, faces
The faces have been ripped, scratched, mutilated
Grainy eyes with holes jabbed in them are mounted in paint beside chopped broken arms
Mills' head is on Somerset's body, and vice versa
It's like a sick, fragmented vision of a slaughter house floor
-- block of burnt-out row homes and warehouses
Stray, wild dogs roam in a pack
car turns down this street
It's John Doe's car, moving fast
Its headlights go out and it cruises, avoiding garbage cans in the street
the dark car
Ahead, a few blocks away, we can see the only lights in this neighborhood, the flashing reds, whites and blues of police activity
'  -- John Doe brings the car to a stop
He watches the police at work around the abandoned church
He gives no discernable reaction, puts the car in reverse
He looks behind as he drives back the way he came
' ,  -- The refrigerator door is open
male forensic uses tongs to remove Zero's severed hand from behind soda cans and mayonnaise
' ,   -- The forensic walks through with the hand in a clear plastic bag, past a    who puts the finishing touches on a fairly accurate drawing of the balding John Doe
This is the guy
Mills stands over the artist
Sarah, Billy and two deputy detectives are at work in the room, photographing, searching
Make sure it gets around
You got it
Tomorrow morning, this city's good citizens will be on the lookout for Elmer Fudd
(to Mills) We can't find anything to hang onto
No pay-stubs, no appointment books or calendars
Not even a book of phone numbers
And, you're not going to believe this
Keep looking
It's just
we haven't found any fingerprints yet
Not one
You know, you're right
don't believe it
Keep looking
' ,   -- Somerset reads one of Doe's notebooks
Three cops are looking through other notebooks from the shelves
Mills enters
We need to put more men on this
'm working on it, alright
What have we got
Somerset bristles slightly at Mills' abrupt demeanor
We've got about five thousand notebooks in this room
And, as near as  can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages
Then, he must write about the murders
Somerset looks at the notebook, reads
"What sick, silly puppets we are, and what a gross stage we dance on
What fun we have, dancing around, not a care in the world
Not knowing that we are nothing
We are not what God intended
" (turns pages) "On the subway today, a man came up to start a conversation
He was making small talk, this lonely man, talking about the weather and other things tried to be accommodating, but my head began to hurt from his banality almost didn't notice it had happened, but  threw up all over him
And couldn't stop myself from laughing
" (closes book) No dates indicated
They're placed on the shelves in no discernible order
He describes a scab on his arm for five pages, then writes about existential philosophy on the next
Mills walks
He looks into the adjoining paint room
() It's just his mind poured out on paper
Mills leans in the doorway, looking at Doe's strange artworks
You were right
He is preaching
The   in the other room
' ,   -- All attention is focused on the phone on Doe's desk
tape recorder is rigged to the receiver
Mills and Somerset enter
Mills walks over, pushes a button on the recorder, picks up
(into phone) Hello
hello
(
) (from recorder) admire you, David
Imagine my surprise on finding you at my doorstep
admire you more and more every day
(into phone) Okay, John
Let's
(
) (from recorder) No, no, no
You listen and don't talk
suppose you found the painting and the photos
This is just as well
Now we all know we've all seen each other
(pause) mean what  say
do admire you
Long pause
Mills waits
(
,) Oh, there is one other thing
Fourteen hundred thirty
West Eighty-sixth street
Apartment six-o-four
John Doe hangs up
604,  -- Somerset looks around this femininely decorated bathroom
In the sink, objects covered in blood: a pair of scissors, a hypodermic needle, first-aid tape and gauze bandages, a bottle of anesthetic for use with the needle, a straight razor
Somerset moves from the sink, looks in the bathtub
The tub and shower walls are splattered with blood
The tub has a few inches of water in it
The water is cloudy red and bits of gauze float in it
Somerset jiggles the drain's knob
Some bubbles pop up from the clogged drain
604 -- Mills is in a dark mood
He and Dr
'Neill stand by a who hangs by a noose from the ceiling
The woman's head has been bandaged sloppily with white gauze and tape
Her eyes have been left uncovered
The gauze is stained red in small spots
The woman hangs low, so her feet are inches from the floor where piles of dried flowers and a cordless telephone lay
There's a chair knocked over behind her
'Neill's going through his black bag
violet, velvet curtain has been draped on the wall in the corner, behind a full length mirror
The mirror reflects the corpse
seven-pointed star is smeared in lipstick on the mirror's surface, with the words ,      below
Somerset enters from the bathroom, looks at the murder display
Pride
Just like in the painting
Somerset nods
He walks to a dresser
The woman's purse sits open and Somerset extracts her driver's license
He looks at the photo
The woman in the picture is beautiful
You can see what he did
'Neill steps up to the woman
He brandishes dull scissors
The captain enters with two uniform cops
He looks around, grim, clenching his jaw
Cut her up
dressed the wounds
He put the noose around her neck and stood her on the chair
She had the telephone
Call for help, and you'll live
But, you'll be mutilated
Or, kick out the chair, and spare yourself a lifetime of hideousness
'Neill's cutting the bandages on the woman's face
He pulls them away in front
Mills looks, disgusted by the sight
Somerset sits in a chair, runs his fingers through his hair
' He cut off her nose to spite her face
And he did it very recently
Alright, boys, you're running on empty
Go home
Just make sure you sleep with the phone between your knees
-- The bookstore is a labyrinth
Tables and shelves, mountains and valleys of books
Books, new and used, hard and soft, in disorganized groups
few customers search for titles
Somerset walks, downcast, winds out of one aisle into another
he has his jacket over his shoulder, runs his fingers along the books as he goes
He pulls one book, The Merchant of Venice, looks at it, replaces it
He looks down the aisle and is surprised to see Tracy
Tracy stands solemn, scanning book spines
Somerset approaches
Tracy
Tracy brightens a bit upon recognizing him
Somerset
How are you
'm alright
'm glad to see you found this place
almost should have expected to run into you here, knowing that you teach English
Tracy looks up and around
It's so huge
It's amazing
This is why  moved into this neighborhood
Don't you love the smell of all the old books
It smells like
like guess just old books, but,  love it
Somerset notices Tracy noticing his gun
() Forgive me
No matter how often  see guns,  can't get used to them
Same here
Tracy laughs
She looks at her watch
If David's going to be back home soon, should get back
She starts down the aisle and Somerset walks with her
() hope you'll come to dinner another night
Before you leave
You can stay and browse a little longer, can't you
mean
Tracy considers this as they enter an open area
() hardly know anyone  can talk about books with anymore
'd appreciate the company
Tracy stops
Somerset looks hopeful
Tracy is very tempted
-- Shelves and empty aisles of books
still
(
) The irony is, that after a day of the type of work he did, he'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories
Le Fanu's Green Tea
Murders in the Rue Morgue
the aisle marked , where Somerset and Tracy are leaning against shelves
They both hold books they've selected
() My mother would give him hell
because was young, and he was keeping me up till all hours, giving me nightmares
Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps
One birthday, he gave me a hardcover book called The Century of the Detective, by Jurgen Thorwald
It traced the history of detection as a science and it sealed my fate
Because it was real, and that a drop of blood or a piece of hair could solve a crime
was incredible to me
looks down the aisle, then walks on
(
) We're closing up, Somerset
Okay, thanks
David's going to wonder where  am
'll give you a ride
No
Please, don't bother
have to insist
If your husband found out  let you ride the subway at this hour he'd tear my head off
They make their way out of the aisle
Somerset chuckles
() mean, literally
-- Somerset's car stops at the corner of Mills' street
'  -- Somerset puts the car in park
Tracy sits for a long time, then turns to face Somerset
You've lived here for so long, Somerset
You know this city
Tracy can't quite figure how to put it
It's a hard place, Tracy
When David and  lived in Philadelphia, we could afford to live on the outskirts
But now
(pause) hate it here
feel scared, and feel sick and
hate it
Tracy wants to laugh, like it's silly, but can't pull it off
You have to put blinders on sometimes
Most times
But, keep in mind, Tracy, like tonight, there are small pockets of sanity
Some bars and bookstores
Museums
Several last vestiges of civilization
-- In Somerset's car, Tracy and Somerset continue talking
On the other side of the street, closer to the middle of the block, John Doe's car is parallel parked at the curb
'  -- Behind the wheel, John Doe is slumped low, calmly watching Somerset and Tracy
He can see them clearly from here
'  -- Tracy looks out through the windshield, fighting tears
've visited so many of the schools, looking for work, you know
And, the conditions are
horrible
can't believe how bad it is
(pause) Children shouldn't have to grow up here
You can always look into the private schools
You'll find something
Somerset gives her a handkerchief
She wipes her tears
() You're too hard on yourself, Tracy
She will not look at him, keeping herself under control
() It's okay to hate this city
It's natural
But, there is a bright side in all this
There is
You want to hear it
Tracy is able to muster a small smile
Oh, God, yes
Please
can't think of another place that needs education more than this city
And you're a teacher
You can make a difference in a few people's lives
It's a very good thing
Tracy leans to give him a kiss on the cheek
Goodnight, Somerset
They remain close, looking into each other's eyes
Goodnight
Somerset reaches to touch Tracy's face
They kiss
They kiss a long time
Tracy wraps her arms around Somerset's neck
Somerset runs his fingers through Tracy's hair
They share their sorrow
Tracy's tears run down her face
Finally, they part, opening their eyes
They know this is wrong
Somerset's hands are shaking
He grips the wheel, feels helpless
() 'm sorry, Tracy
'm sorry
Tracy's face is flushed
She is confused
better go
Tracy gets out, neglects to close the door, not looking back
Somerset tries to come to his senses
He doesn't understand either, and his heart is aching
He adjusts the rearview mirror to watch Tracy go
--    -- '
Tracy walks down the block, straightening her hair
She runs
'  -- Somerset looks away from the mirror
he holds his head in his hands for a moment
-- Somerset leans to pull the door shut, puts the car in gear
He drives, turns the corner
'  -- John Doe watches Somerset's car leave
Doe turns his attention to Tracy, who hurries along the other side of the street
Tracy looks back, enters her apartment building, digs out her keys
She gets through the door and climbs stairs, disappearing
-- Doe gets out of his car
He looks both ways down the street, walks towards Mills' and Tracy's building
' ,  -- Mills and Tracy are asleep in their bed
Mills' eyes shift under their lids
Rapid eye movement
is  from the other room
Mills awakens
He lays still a moment, then gets up, slowly, reaches to take his gun off the bedside table
He grabs his pants from a chair, slides into them
' ,  / -- Mills opens the bedroom door and enters quietly, gun held up
He moves, crouching
In the dark, objects in the room and shadows from windows form complex, confusing patterns
Mills walks between moving boxes, attempting to remain silent
He aims the gun from point to point as he advances
He gets to a closet
Staying on one side, he opens the door and points his gun
He carefully separates the clothing hanging there
Nothing
No one
He turns to look over the room
It's the first time we see it in Mills' eyes -- real fear
The door to the apartment is wide open
'  ,  -- Mills moves from his apartment, gun out, into the dark hallway
The coast is clear
He stays low, moves down the hall
He stops, looks up
'  ,  -- Mills shoves the rooftop door open
It creaks as it swings
Mills moves out, backwards, looking to top the raised rooftop entrance, covering it with his gun
He moves around, sees nothing, walks to the edge of the roof and looks over
' ,  -- Mills returns to the bedroom, still holding his gun up
He looks at Tracy asleep in the bed
The room begins to  a little as a subway train is again passing underground
He walks to the window and checks the lock
He halts
He opens the window and reaches out
The rattling is a bit
From the fire escape, he picks up a bundle of thorny thistles wrapped with a rubber band
Mills realizes, Doe was here
-- The room is plain, like the room Mrs
Gold was kept in
The door opens and Tracy and Mills enter
They look sleepy, carrying suitcases
uniformed cop closes the door for them
Mills goes to lay a suitcase on a table while Tracy looks around, depressed, distant
The lighting is bad
There are no decorations, no windows
wide crack runs down one wall
Tracy sits down on the bed
Mills notices her discontent
It won't be for long, honey
swear
This is just till this is over
know
Mills goes to sit beside her
He puts his hand on her shoulder
'm sorry
Tracy nods
She stands, goes to start turning down the covers
know
It can't be helped
Mills feels useless, powerless
He goes to the suitcase and starts unpacking the contents
Tracy continues turning down the sheets
-- , '  -- The chalkboard:            1 gluttony (x)      5 lust 2 greed (x)         6 envy 3 sloth (x)         7 wrath 4 pride (x) Somerset is seated, holding the photo of the lust painting from the tableau
Mills is behind his own desk
They both look like they haven't gotten much sleep
There's two people in that painting
So, maybe he's planning to kill two people this time
Maybe
Mills looks at Somerset, who doesn't seem to be listening
() What's wrong this morning
Nothing
Sorry
Somerset looks up, sips from a cup of coffee, looks at the photo
Mills swings his chair, looks out the window at the morning light on the billboard
Lust is next
Lust is sex
Apples on the floor
Original sin
Adam and Eve
Somerset puts the photo down, leans back, takes out a cigarette
() Sex, sex, sex
Fucking sex
Lust is everywhere
That's the hard part
think lust is the most prevalent sin, even more than greed
Somerset looks at the burning tip of his cigarette
He gets up to stretch his legs
Mills picks up the lust photo, puts his feet up on the desk
Lust is red
Long pause
Bright red
Blood red
Red sky at night, sailor's delight
Red blooded
Red head
Dead
Red light district
Pause
Realization
Somerset and Mills look at each other
That would make sense
It would be fitting
You're damn right it would
Mills picks up the phone
,   -- Porno theaters and Adult Bookstores rule these busy sidewalks
Marquees offer  ,   and movies like and  -'
Cops are walking through the pedestrian flow, handing out photocopies
There are many patrol cars on the street
Definitely a larger than usual police presence
Cops are questioning the proprietors of porn at the entrances of their shops and theaters
Cops are taping photocopies onto lamp posts
These photocopies are warnings, with the drawing of John Doe's face above a line of information and the words
'   -- Somerset's holding up the composite sketch of John Doe
(
) Yeah, he was here
This morning
Mills and Somerset are across the sales counter from  , 37
Wild Bill is shirtless, covered in tattoos
thick scar runs down his forehead to his bent nose
Leather belts, whips and jackets hang from the walls
It was definitely him
You're positive
Yeah
John Doe
Easy name to remember
What was this job you did for him
Wild Bill pulls a box from behind the counter, digs in it
got a picture of it
That's what he came for this morning
figured he must be one of those art guys
like those guys who piss in a cup and drink it on stage
Performance art
Wild Bill gives a polaroid to Mills
We don't see the image
Oh, fuck
think  undercharged him
was up all night working to finish it
(looks at photo) You built this for him
You built this
've built weirder shit than that
as a  enters the store
Somerset
we have a situation
Mills and Somerset follow the policeman out
Hey, my picture
They're gone
Wild Bill scratches his scar
() Fucking pigs
-- It's a madhouse outside The Hot House
Police action in progress
Cops have formed a barrier, holding off a crowd and creating an aisle to the back of a jail-van
Cops and detectives escort various men, women and transvestites into the large vehicle
The crowd, consisting of the dregs of society, is angry
Some spit and throw trash at the cops
,   -- An   pounds his nightstick on a glass cage
Inside the cage sits an oily   in front of a wall of sex toys
Just wait
Get out of the fucking booth
Just wait
'll come out, just wait
,  -- All the lights and walls are red
Mills and Somerset follow a through the twisting corridors
They reach a door
don't want to go in there again
,   -- Mills and Somerset enter
,
strobe light flashes from the ceiling onto
The first attendant places a sheet over a bed, hiding the corpse of a  with long blonde hair
The second attendant tries to examine the pupils of a  , 55, who sits naked on the floor, wrapped in a sheet
holds the crazed man down
He
he
he made me do it
have to look at you
have to look at you
An  is scratched into the red paint on the wall
Mills and Somerset move towards the covered body
There are apples on the bed and floor
The   from outside
You're not going to want to see this more than once
He had a gun
He
he made me do it
The sheet is lifted for the detectives
They grimace at what they see
We do not see
Somerset closes his eyes and walks to face a wall, shaken
The first attendant replaces the sheet
Mills steps back, takes out his handkerchief and sucks on it
(
,) He made me do it
,   -- polaroid is on a white table
It is the photo Wild Bill gave to Mills and Somerset
It is a picture of a belt, made with extra leather straps so it can be worn securely around the groin
It is a strap-on phallus, but there is no plastic protuberance
Instead, there is a metal knife
It is a strap- on butcher's knife
Somerset is seated beside the white table in this white room
Mills stands behind him
The crazed man from the lust murder is in a chair across the room
The crazed man is crying
And
and
and he said
he asked if was married
And,  could see he had a gun in his hand
Where was the girl
What
What
Where was the prostitute
She was
she was on the bed
She was just sitting on the bed
Who tied her down
You or him
He had a gun
He had a gun, and he made it happen
He made me do it
He made me put it on
that thing
Oh, God
he made me wear it
He had the gun in my mouth
The man slides off the chair and hides his face in his hands
() The gun was in my throat
Mills looks at the mirror in the room
Somerset stands, picks up the Polaroid as two men in white uniforms enter to collect the crazed man from off the floor
, '  -- Somerset and Mills are shell-shocked, seated at their desks
Somerset is looking out the window
Mills stares at the wall
Somerset looks to his temporary desk
He picks up a small pile of mail, sorts through it
An 8" by 10" manila envelope interests him
It reads   on the outside, handwritten in red marker
He opens it
He takes out a grainy photograph of he and Tracy kissing in his car
It's obviously been taken with a special night-lens
Somerset goes pale, suppressing a gasp
He holds the photo to hide it from Mills, looks to see Mills has not noticed
He feels panicky, crumples the photo and envelope in his hand
, '  -- Somerset enters, latches the door
He takes the crushed photo and envelope from his pocket
He quickly checks under the stalls to see he is alone
He opens a window, goes to the sink
He takes out his cigarette lighter, lights the envelope and photo, watches them catch
Once they're burning steady he throws them in the sink
He backs away, leans against the wall, watching, feeling sick
-- Somerset and Mills sit with a full pitcher of beer between them
The  plays  for other customers
The walls of the bar are lined with trophies, ribbons and other victory symbols
There's not going to be a happy ending
It's not possible
If we get him, 'll be happy enough
No
Face it now
Stop thinking it's good guys against the bad guys in this city
Mills drinks deep, pours more
How can you say that
Especially after today
You tell me
when you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or, a wife murdered her husband in cold blood
and you have to wash the blood off their children
You put the killer in jail
Who won
If  thought like you, 'd have slit my wrists a long time ago
Where's the victory
You do your job
Follow the law and do the best you can
It's all there
If we caught John Doe tomorrow, and it turned out he was the devil
if it turned out he was literally Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations
No human being could do these horrible things, right
But, this is not the devil
It's only a man
Why don't you shut the fuck up for a while
Huh
You make these speeches
like you know everything there is to know
Somerset sits back, looking at Mills
() You think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead
You think you're toughening me up
Well, you're not
(pause) You're quitting, fine
but 'm staying to fight
Who are you fighting for
People don't want a champion
They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers
What the fuck is wrong with you, huh
What burnt you out
There's no one thing, if that's what you mean
just
can't live anymore where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue
You're so much better than everyone, right
No one's worthy of you
Wrong
sympathize completely
Because if you can't win
then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you go insane
It's easier to smoke crack, and not worry that your wife and kids are starving to death
And, it's so much easier to bear a child till that child finally shuts up, because it takes so much work to love
And, if you bothered to think about the abuse, and the damage, you'd be sad
You're talking about people who are mentally ill
You're
(cuts in, furious) No,  am not
'm talking about common, everyday life here
Where Ignorance isn't bliss, it's a matter of survival
Listen to yourself
You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so  don't care about people
"  But, if you're not part of the solution
(cuts him off) People who are in arguments over their heads always use meaningless slogans
But, life doesn't conform to analogies
You're already here, and you've been here a long time
So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters
That part of me is dead
Mills stands
Fuck you
You want me to agree with you
"Yeah, you're right, Somerset, this place is fucked
Let's go live in a fucking log cabin
"  Well,  don't agree with you
You're quitting, and it makes me sick
Cause, you're the best 've ever seen
Mills digs out some money and throws it on the table
() Thanks for the beer
Mills leaves
Other patrons watch him go
Somerset takes out a cigarette
He goes to light it
The lighter will not light, and when it does, Somerset's hand is shaking
-- Mills comes quietly into the bedroom
Tracy is asleep in the bed
Mills takes off his jacket, puts it down
He sits on a chair and unties one shoe, takes it off
He looks at Tracy, looks at her a long time
He puts the shoe on the floor and goes to get on the bed
He kisses Tracy's forehead, looks at her sleeping innocently
He is touched, saddened
He kisses her cheek, then wraps his arms under and around her
He holds tight, kisses her again
Tracy stirs
David
Mills his face against her, holding tighter still
love you
Tracy holds his face in her hands, sees that he is crying
David
love you
Mills clings to her
She wraps her arms around him as he cries quietly against her, and she kisses him, tries to comfort him
He sobs
,   -- John Doe walks in this section of huge industrial complexes
Factories and foundries are lined side by side, seemingly for miles
We can    sounding low and deep
We're near the water
Doe seems to know where he's going
He passes stacks of industrial piping and steel drums piled to the sky
He walks through an industrial junk-yard filled with trashed bulldozers, trucks and discarded factory equipment
It's like a stroll through a bone-yard of dead dinosaurs
At the end of this field of metal, there is a tall, narrow alleyway formed by two warehouses
Doe enters, looking up at the single lit bulb on the wall above
He looks at the ground, picks up a rock and a beaten hubcap, walks under the bulb
He throws the hubcap with all his might
It soars, but misses the bulb, falls to the ground behind
Doe takes aim with the rock
He throws, grunting
The rock smashes the bulb, bringing darkness to the alley
Doe walks back to the mouth of the alley
He stops and turns to start from there
He walks, deliberately, looking down at his feet
as he walks
He stops, looks back to the way he came, then looks down at the ground in front of him again
He takes off his thick glasses
He holds the glasses in his hand
' ,  -- Somerset is in bed
The metronome is sounding: tick, tick, tick
The  of the  are
Somerset closes his eyes, concentrating on the metronome
Tick, tick, tick
and a  are   at each other incoherently from outside
Somerset rolls over, restless
Tick, tick, tick
is  from outside
This man is screaming at the other two people to shut up
Somerset opens his eyes, sits up
He reaches over, grabs the metronome and throws it against the wall
-- ' ,  -- Somerset sits away from the bed
He's smoking a cigarette
The Somerset gets up, not in the best of moods
(into phone) Hello
(
) (from phone, upset) Hello, Somerset
It's Tracy
Is everything alright
(
) Yes
Everything's fine
Could
could you meet me somewhere
To talk
(pause) don't think that's a good idea
(
) need to talk to someone, Somerset
You're the only friend  have here don't know anyone else
-- Somerset and Tracy are seated in a booth by the window
The city's morning rush passes by outside
The cafe is noisy
Tracy is very upset
Somerset is very uneasy
David doesn't know about this
You haven't told him
Tracy shakes her head
Somerset sighs
Long silence
() have to tell you, Tracy, 'm not the one to talk to about this
just can't think straight
don't know why  called you, except  can't stand to hold it as a secret anymore had to get it out
and  can't tell David yet
Not yet
Somerset takes out his cigarettes, but thinks better of it and puts them away
He watches Tracy stir her coffee
had a relationship once, very much like a marriage
And, there was a baby
long time ago
Things were good
And  got up one morning, and went on a case
a murder, like any other
Except it was my first since hearing about the baby
And,  felt this fear and anxiety coming over me looked around and  thought, how can raise a child here
So, that night, told her  didn't want us to have children,  And, over the next few weeks
convinced her
Tears come to Somerset's eyes
() mean,  wore her down
slowly
want to have children
But
can tell you,  know
'm positive made the right decision
'm positive it was the right thing to do
But, there's never a day that goes by that don't wish  had decided differently
Tracy reaches to hold Somerset's hand, but he withdraws it, wipes his tears away
() If you
if you decide not to have the baby
if that's what you decide, then never tell Mills you were pregnant
mean that
Never tell
(pause) Your marriage would just wither, and die altogether
Tracy looks around the cafe, tears in her eyes
() But, if you decide to have the baby, then, at that very instant, when you're absolutely sure
tell him
Tell him that exact second
And, spoil that kid every chance you get
Somerset
Somerset stands
He forces a smile
That's all the wisdom  can share with you, Tracy
barely know you
Will  see you again, before you leave
Probably not
But, it's probably better that way
Somerset steps away, leaves
Tracy watches him go
-- Mills and Somerset walk towards the precinct house
They wade through cars to cross the street
've decided
want to stay on, till this is over
Till either it's done, or we can see it will never end
Mills remains impassive
Oh, you want to stay now
One of two things is going to happen
We're either going to get John Doe
or, he will finish his series of seven, and he'll never be found
You think if you stay you're doing me some big favor
'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days
You'd be doing me the favor
You knew 'd say yes
No
wasn't sure at all
They enter the precinct house
Down the sidewalk, from a distance, comes John Doe
His brown workboots and clothing are splattered with blood
He walks towards the precinct house, hands in his pockets, like he's merely out for a walk on a Sunday afternoon
People on the sidewalk stop upon seeing him, avoiding him
,  / -- Mills and Somerset walk past booking cubicles and benches of handcuffed low-lifes
The place is swimming with activity
The two detectives head to a duty desk at the end of the room
As soon as this is over, 'll be gone
What a great big surprise that is
They pass through a gate and Somerset goes to the staircase leading to the second floor
Mills stops at the duty desk
Other cops are fighting for the  ' attention
() Mills and Somerset are on the premises
Wonder-fucking-ful
Mills stops, looks
Somerset stops, looks back down the stairs
John Doe stands inside the precinct house doors
He holds out his arms as if to say "presto, here  am
" Near silence comes to the room as all eyes go to the figure of John Doe
Mills is riveted, finding this impossible to comprehend
One   takes out his gun, points it at John Doe
It's him
Several other cops drop what they're doing and draw weapons
Mills, still off-balance, walks back through the gate, takes his gun out and points it at Doe
Get down on the floor
Somerset comes back down the stairs
Be careful
Cops move slowly in on Doe from all sides
You heard him
Get on the floor
John Doe gets on his knees, hands up
Mills moves close, but not too
comes from behind, nudges Doe with his foot
Spread your legs and get your hands out in front of you
Get down
Face down
John Doe gets on his stomach, obeys
Mills comes right up to Doe, steps on his neck, puts his gun against Doe's head
() Don't move
Don't move a fucking inch
Cops frisk and handcuff Doe
Somerset comes beside Mills
don't believe it
Hello, Lieutenant Somerset
What the hell is this
The cop putting the handcuffs on Doe holds up Doe's hands
Doe winces
Every single one of Doe's fingers has a bandage wrapped around it
John Doe looks up, his face pressed against the floor, glasses askew, Mills' gun at his temple
want to speak with my lawyer
,   -- Mills, Somerset and the captain stand in darkness
On the other side of a two-way mirror, John Doe is seated in a restraining chair in an interrogation room
His hands and legs are bound with leather straps to the chair's arm and legs strap hold tight around Doe's throat
This is not some superman/serial killer
He looks more like an eccentric college professor
His lawyer  , 43, sits at a table, taking notes
Mills holds a fingerprint card
The black ink prints are just useless blobs with traces of blood in them
He cuts off the skin of his fingertips
That's why we can't find a single usable print in his apartment
For a long time, he's been cutting before the papillary lines can grow back
What about the trace on his bank account
The guns
The orphanage is all we have
His bank account is only five years old and it started as cash
There's no credit history, no employment history
We even tried to trace his furniture
All we know for sure is he's wealthy, well educated and totally insane
We may never know how he got that way
Somerset stands looking in at Doe
Because he is John Doe, by choice
When do we get to question him
You don't
This goes to court now
This doesn't make sense, captain
He wouldn't just turn himself in
Well, there he sits
It's not supposed to make sense
He's not finished
You're wound way too tight on this, Mills
Somerset
help me out here
Somerset looks at them
Says nothing
It's over
The captain leaves
Mills is furious
Damn it, Somerset
You know Johnny's fucking with us
He's pissing in our faces again
Slow up
You and  are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement
He wouldn't just stop
Well
what the fuck, man
John Doe's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right
But, can you even conceive of what might happen next
mean, can you tell me how he's going to go about it
(pause) No
can tell you this;  recognize his lawyer
His name is Mark Swarr
He's the one who kept Zero out of prison
(pause) We'll wait for John Doe's plea
, '  -- Mills is at the desk with his feet up, stares at the chalkboard: 1 gluttony (x)       5 lust (x) 2 greed (x)          6 wrath 3 sloth (x)          7 envy 4 pride (x) Clock on the wall says 4:45
Somerset packs books into boxes, preparing for his eventual departure
The captain opens the door and steps into the office
He clears his throat, looking like there is something very wrong
, '  -- Mills and Somerset stand together
The captain is behind his desk with the
, Martin Talbot, seated in front of him
Mark Swarr addresses them all, seems nervous, but in control
My client says there are two more bodies
two more dead, hidden away
He will take Detective Mills to these bodies, but only Detective Mills
Only at six o'clock, today
Swarr wipes his brow with a handkerchief
Oh, Christ
Why me
He says he admires you
(to captain) This is all part of his game plan
Mr
Doe claims that if the detective does not accept this offer, the bodies will never be found
Frankly, counselor, 'm inclined to let them rot
Mills walks up into Swarr's face
You like what you do for a living
Back off, Mills
'm required by law to serve my clients to the best of my ability, and to serve their interests
Mills eases off
Talbot is agitated, tapping a finger on the gold tooth in his mouth
He looks at Swarr
We don't make deals like this
We're going to have to pass
My client
he also wishes that inform you, if you do not accept, he will plead insanity, across the board
Let him try
'd like to see him try
Come now, Martin
Even he knows, with the nature of these crimes,  could get him off with such a plea
Talbot stands, wringing his hands
Mills and Somerset are looking at each other, thinking it over
'm not letting this conviction slide
can tell you that, right here and right now
He says, if you accept, under his specific conditions, he will sign a full confession and plead guilty
right here, and right now
Talbot looks at Swarr with hatred
'll do it
Hold on
just a minute
Somerset turns to Talbot
() If he were to plead insanity
this conversation is admissible
The fact that he's blackmailing us with his plea
And, my client reminds you, two more people are dead
The press would have a field day if they found out the police didn't seem too concerned about finding them
giving them proper burial
'll do it
want to finish it
Somerset is thinking it through
He looks at Mills
(to captain) Well
let's get the fucking lawyer out of the room, and we can talk about how this whole thing's going to go down
,  -- Mills' hand reaches to the sink to pick up a razor
He's shirtless, his chest covered in shaving cream
He starts shaving in front of a mirror
Somerset is behind him, smoking
If John Doe's head splits open, and a flies out,  want you to have expected it
will
No emotion
Stay as cold as ice
will
Somerset flicks ash in the sink
Mills finishes shaving
He steps away from the sink and wipes his chest off with a towel
() (very serious) Listen, Somerset
we've been through a lot together
And,  uh
What is it
would like to make sweet love to you
Somerset walks away
Mills laughs
Please
As they leave
Give me a kiss on the lips
Give me a break
,   -- Mills has his shirt off
female technician, Josie, tapes a radio transmitter and microphone to his chest
Somerset sits nearby at one of the ready room desks
He wears a bullet-proof vest, is just finishing a check of his gun
He's putting the bullets back into it
Josie finishes prepping Mills
Mills presses the adhesive, making sure it will hold
He puts on a shirt and bullet-proof vest, fastens the velcro
Somerset stands, puts the gun in his hip holster
Mills picks up his own gun, checks it, holsters it
He watches Somerset take out a roll of antacids
Somerset pops a few
Ready
Extremely
They look at each other
Mills holds out his hand
They shake on it
,      -- The street is full of shadows as the sun is falling low
On the steps of the precinct house, a throng of reporters shifts anxiously
line of policemen holds them back
The precinct doors open
Martin Talbot arrives, escorted by cops
The press swarm lurches forward, flashbulbs explode
Talbot holds out his hands, quieting them, about to speak
,      -- Mills' car pulls out of the fenced parking lot
John Doe is seated in the rear
The car speeds up on the street, turns onto an avenue, heading into a canyon formed by tall buildings
At the corner, a car is parked
Somerset is at the wheel
He pulls out, follows Mills' car
-- California is dressed in full battle gear
He looks through binoculars at the city below
The wind blows hard
He turns and runs to a sleek helicopter on the roof's heli-pad, climbs in the side door
The  leans back from the cockpit to hand him a helmet
California dons it, starts strapping himself in so he can lean out the open door
Is this wind going to hurt us
The pilot cranks the helicopter's whining engine and the blades start to spin, churning the air
Just makes the ride a little more fun
California hefts a high-powered automatic rifle as the chopper lifts from the pad and takes off
'  -- Mills drives, looking to the back seat through the rearview mirror
steel mesh partition separates front from back
John Doe sits with his hands cuffed
He is dressed in gray pants and a gray shirt
His feet are cuffed to a metal fastener on the floor of the car
Rivulets of sweat pour down his face
He seems wired
What's your story, Johnny
Who are you, really
Doe pushes his glasses back up the bridge of his nose, looks at Mills' eyes in the rearview mirror
It doesn't matter who  am
Who  am means absolutely nothing
'  -- Somerset adjusts the volume on a radio receiver mounted on the dash
He watches the road ahead, tailing Mills
(
) (from receiver) What's your deal
You seem pretty fucking nervous
(
) (from receiver) want this to go well
It's very important to me, obviously
-- The chopper hovers amongst skyscrapers
California and the pilot are listening, through their helmet headsets
(
) (from headset) You want this to go well
What is this
(
) (from headset) Turn right on this street
Stay in the left lane
California leans out the chopper door, using his binoculars
-- Mills' car weaves through traffic
Somerset's car isn't far behind, goes through a red light, barely missing a truck
Other cars blow their horns
'  -- cellular phone on the passenger side is
Somerset pushes a button on the phone's panel
He puts on a headset/telephone, speaks into the mouthpiece
'm here
(
) (from headset) Downtown and moving west
Looks like you're going to be crossing water
If we're on the bridge, you keep your distance
You hear me
-- The helicopter hovers steady
California stows his binoculars
(
) (from headset) Cross the river before us if necessary
You got it
California taps the pilot's helmet
-- The helicopter dips, flying like a bullet over the city skyline, heading towards the river and the setting sun
-- , we see traffic on the highway at the polluted river's edge
Cards and trucks move like blood through veins
, we can see Mills' car in the flow
The car turns into a lane of traffic on its way to the huge suspension bridge
Somerset's car is in close pursuit
, the police helicopter travels close to the water, moving parallel to the bridge, but low, so that it's out of the sightline of the vehicles above
'  -- Traffic is bumper to bumper
Somerset moves his headset mouthpiece to smoke a cigarette
He steers onto the bridge, under the massive girders
(
) (from receiver) For us to go pick up two more dead bodies, and have that be the end of it
just seems too boring for you
'  -- Beyond the crest of the bridge, the sunset is crimson
Wouldn't be sensational enough
Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder
John Doe strains to turn, looks out the back window
() Sometimes you have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer
and then you get their strict attention
What are you looking at, Johnny
Looking back
at the city proper
Doe situates forward, holds his hands in front of his face, looking at his bandaged fingers
() And yet, no pillar of salt
(smiles to himself) Lost on you, isn't it
You've never read the Bible, have you, David
remember a lot of people reading it at me when  was a kid
preferred the classic comic version myself
This is an affront to Doe, angers him
Mills sees it, likes it
() used to have "Godspell" on an eight- track tape
Does that count
Doe leans forwards, fury building in him
You make me sick
Sit back, freak
Mills slams his fist against the partition
Doe sits back
(under his breath) Ignorant heathen
Right, right
forgot
You think these murders were for God
Right
(pause) 'm asking you seriously
You really think what you did was God's good work
Doe looks out the window at other cars, refuses to answer
He's pressing the tips of his forefingers into his thumbs, causing blood to drip from under the bandages
The Lord works in mysterious ways
,   -- It's getting dark
We've been in this section of factories before, with John Doe
The police helicopter soars overhead
-- California's looking down, wearing night-vision goggles
-- '
-- The goggles allow California to see clearly into the maze formed by buildings, yards and worksheds below
No one in sight
(
) Fuck, man
there's about a thousand places to be ambushed out here
'  -- The headlights are off
Mills' car's red brake lights are far ahead on this industrial road
(
) (from headset) don't see anything
not yet
(in mouthpiece) quick sweep is all we get
Clear out now
You're right in front of us
Somerset reaches to turn up the volume on his radio receiver
Mills is   "Jesus Christ Superstar," loud
Somerset allows a very faint smile
'  -- Mills drives along, singing
Jesus Christ, Superstar
who in the world do you think you are
Jesus Christ, Superstar
Doe's in the back seat, trying to bear it, steaming
-- The chopper goes high, away, over the industrial area
It moves to the other side of the factories and settles in low over the river
'  -- Mills' tune comes to a conclusion
Somerset slows the car as he sees Mills' brake lights go on ahead
(
) (from receiver) We can walk from here
(in mouthpiece) You stay out of this unless  call you in, California
Understand
(
) (from headset) You're in charge
Somerset takes off the headset/phone, stops the car
,  '  -- Somerset gets out
He looks through binoculars
-- '
-- Mills' car has stopped under the lights of a junk-yard
Mills gets out
He walks to unlock the passenger door
(
) (from receiver) Alright, Somerset
Going for a stroll
' Mills opens the passenger door
Doe looks out
Lean on your side
Hands behind your head and lock your fingers together
Doe obliges
Mills moves to unchain Doe's feet, cautious
-- '
-- Mills lets Doe out
Doe does a deep knee bend to loosen his legs
Mills takes out his gun
(
) (from receiver) Where are we going
Doe points with handcuffed hands, at a path through the junk- yard, towards warehouses
Mills motions with his gun
(
,) (from receiver) Lead the way
Doe starts walking
Mills follows, keeping the gun on Doe
We lose sight of them behind the junk-yard's massive pieces
' Somerset lowers his binoculars
He gets back in the car, leaves the lights off, drives slowly towards Mills' car
, - -- Mills follows Doe past rusting collections of machines
We took this walk with Doe before, through this metallic bone-yard
It's right this way
Mills is on edge
His eyes search the towering, twisted junk
Sharp edges reach for the sky
Glass breaks under their feet
So far, so good
of  on the river can be
Doe's heading for the alleyway created by two warehouses beyond the junk-yard
Doe nears the alleyway
It is pitch dark
Doe stops before entering, turns to Mills
In here
Mills steps up, keeping his distance from Doe
He can't see a thing in the blackness ahead
You go first
Doe faces the alley
He starts walking
We  with him as he goes
He's counting silently to himself, moving his lips
Mills walks behind Doe, keeping a sharp eye out in all directions
He's about ten feet behind Doe, keeping his gun trained on the back of Doe's skull
() Tell me where we're going
Doe continues walking, counting his steps, a bit quicker
'  -- Somerset has pulled along Mills' car, at the junk-yard
(
) (from receiver) Slow down, Johnny
Stop right there
(pause) said stop
-- Doe walks on
Mills is behind, walking to close the gap
We can  the faint  of
'll blow your head off right now
Doe stops abruptly
He spins on his heels, facing Mills
Mills is getting closer, pumped, ready to pull the trigger
Doe reaches up with his hands, takes off his glasses
He holds them in one hand
The  of the  is
Mills is about six feet from Doe, and knows something's wrong
John Doe smiles
() What
Doe takes one step backwards and falls, straight down, disappears in the blink of an eye
() No
'  -- Somerset looks towards the far off alleyway, horrified
(
) (from receiver) Motherfucker
No
-- Mills stands facing the open manhole cover Doe disappeared into
torrent of water rushes by underground
Mills fires a few futile shots into the water, out of his mind with rage
He pulls back the top of his bullet-proof vest, exposing the microphone
He's gone, Somerset
He's in the water
, '  -- Somerset leaps out, takes out his gun
as he runs into the junk-yard as fast as he can
(
) (from receiver) 'm going in
-- The chopper's over the river
California listens intently
(
) (from headset) have to go in after him
in his headset, then it
California grips his mouthpiece
Somerset, what's going on down there
-- An underground pipe-way
Mills tries to swim, is mostly carried in the flow
He's battered against the sides of the pipe, holding his breath desperately
- -- Somerset as he charges onwards through the junk-yard, stumbling over pieces of metal
He runs towards the alleyway
-- square pool of water churns
moment, then Mills rises, gasping, choking
He's disoriented, furious, waving his gun, expecting Doe to be right on top of him
No one around
Mills looks
This is some sort of unmanned water switching station
the walls are covered in catwalks, drainage pipes and tunnels
Some tunnels and pipes spew water down into the central pool, others are sealed shut
Mills pulls himself from the central pool to a concrete spillway
He stands up, searching
Doe could be anywhere
Come on, Johnny
'm right here
-- There is a plastic bag with an automatic pistol and extra clip inside hanging from a protruding shut-off valve
John Doe's hands tear the bag open, taking the contents
-- Somerset enters the alley, short of breath
He points his gun in front of him, fearful
Moving slowly
Mills
-- California is enraged, looks towards the pilot
God damn it
Let's do something
Somerset said wait
Fuck that
Let's go
Where
don't know
Just go
-- Mills climbs onto a catwalk
He passes tunnels, looking down each, intense, ready to kill
waterfall flows and over the other end of the catwalk
Mills stands, looking over the railing at the central pool and other tunnels
He points his gun and fires into a far tunnel
Come on
Let's do it
You and me
figure appears in the center of the waterfall behind Mills
() 'm not going to let you win this
John Doe steps out of the waterfall, putting on his glasses
He seems calm, unloads his gun into Mills' back
,
Mills twists, blown forward by the bullets slamming into his bullet-proof vest
, ,
he stumbles, trying to turn and fire back, but bullets strike him down and he falls to the floor of the catwalk, gun falling from his hand
Doe's gun is empty
The gunshots echo
Mills lays there on his stomach, pounded, blacking out, the hot bullets in his vest smoking and sizzling from the water splashing them
Doe moves quickly, starts searching Mills' pockets
-- Somerset comes upon the open manhole
Water rushes by
Christ
-- The central pool bubbles, undulating
Somerset surfaces, inhaling, bringing his gun up
He looks
No one in sight
Mills
Pull out
His voice reverberates, barely heard against the roaring water
he swims to the edge, climbs out
He walks, looking
() (pleading) Pull out now
Somerset looks up, and freezes up on seeing -- -- Doe's handcuffs hang, swinging, on the rail of the catwalk above, with Mills' radio transmitter and wire tied to them
- -- Somerset runs to his car, driven, gasping for breath, still soaking wet
He stops for one second, looks
Not too far away, the police helicopter flies low to the ground, turning in wide circles
Somerset climbs into the car, starts it up
He drives away, leaving his lights off
The engine protests loudly, forced to its limit
The car disappears in darkness
The police helicopter circles, useless
/ -- The church stands elegant at night, when its decayed state is partially hidden
Small shafts of light escape from holes in the facade and just into the blackness
Somerset is out of his car
He strides towards the church, checks his gun as he goes
with him, getting closer to the church
He climbs the stairs
Somerset steps up and kicks the church doors open, met by a tremendous blast of light -- -- Flickering orange light from hundreds of once tall orange candles, now burnt low
They greet Somerset, in the church's old candle racks, on the floor, on the altar and all through out the pews
Somerset's eyes try to adjust to the light
He holds his gun ready, walks down the long center aisle
(
) Hello, Somerset
Doe sounds far, his voice echoing from the front of the church
Where's David
(
) He's here
With me
Tell me what you want
Somerset can see through the heat warp
Doe stands facing him from the altar
What do  want
The same you
want an ending
Stay where you are
Put your gun on the floor and slide it all the way down here
Somerset obeys, bends, slides the gun down the aisle till it hits the bottom altar stair
He keeps walking, slowly
want to see him
Show me Mills
On the altar, Doe is sweating hard, standing over Mills
Mills is slumped forward on the floor, unconscious
His bullet-proof vest has been removed
Mills' hands are tied tight together in front of him, tied to one end of the thick rope suspended from the ceiling
Doe holds the other end of the rope, has his gun tucked under his belt
You're an intelligent man, Somerset
You understand what you're a part of, don't you
When this is finished, it will seem surreal, but it will be a whole, crystalline reality
And, no one will be able to deny it, no matter how hard they try
Doe's voice is thick with passion
Somerset is about halfway down the aisle, still moving
You're a murderer
That's all
The only way you've distinguished yourself is by your particular brutality
Doe walks across the altar
You know that's not true
You know
You're killing innocent people, and should admire you
You're doing it because it gives you pleasure
That's the only purpose
your sick pleasure
Doe picks up a container of gasoline, looks out at Somerset
Stay where you are
Somerset stops
() won't deny my personal desires won't
Doe begins dousing Mills with gasoline, covering Mills' body and clothing
Mills stirs, coming to
He coughs, choking on the gas and fumes
() But,  don't mourn the victims in this any more than  mourn the thousands who died in Sodom and Gomorrah
Somerset looks fearful
He starts approaching again
All you've done is cause more misery and pain
You've given people all the more reason to believe there is no God
Somerset eyes his gun at the bottom of the stairs
Doe sees Somerset moving, throws the gas can away, takes out his gun
Doe walks to the edge of the altar, all the time holding his end of the rope
Stop
Somerset is twitching with anger, looking at the gun about fifteen feet in front of him
Mills manages to look up, weak, his eyes barely able to open because of the stinging gasoline
Somerset
Doe takes one step down off the altar
Somerset is still edging forward, hands out away from his body
Do you really think 'm just going to let this happen
You think 'm going to let him die
Yes
Doe fires his gun and the bullet slams into the front of Somerset's bullet-proof vest
Somerset flies back, knocking over a rack of candles on his way to the floor
Doe walks quickly back onto the altar
Motherfucker
Mills tries to grab at Doe as he passes, but Doe turns and kicks Mills in the ribs
Mills cringes in pain
Somerset lays in the aisle, on his stomach, gasping
He can't catch his breath, his twisted face pressed against the floor
How can you speak of God, Somerset
When was the last time you spoke His name
Mills tries to rub the gas out of his eyes with his bound hands
His mind works feverishly
He looks around to see where he is, then he searches the floor
We can see, inside his open shirt, the bleeding, upside-down cross Doe has cut into his chest
Doe walks back to shout angrily down at Somerset
() When did you last speak His name
Was it in prayer
Or, did you say the Lord's name after you stubbed your big toe
Or, did you use His name to curse another man
Somerset holds his chest, blinking, trying not to black out
Mills finds a piece of broken stained glass on the floor
He picks it up, palms it, still choking on gasoline
Doe walks over to the statue of Saint Jerome Emiliani, pulling the rope from above so it goes taut and Mills' arms raise above his head
Doe wraps the rope around Emiliani's arm
'm going to kill you, Johnny
'm going to see you dead
Doe begins twisting the loose end of the rope around the statue
The irony, David, is that you policemen and  want the same things
But, you are so short sighted
In this city, where you can see a deadly sin on every street corner
and in every home, we want repentance
Mills clutches the glass piece and starts cutting the rope just above his hands
() We want good over evil
We want values instilled in the children
We want a world where a man or woman can lead a decent life
(pause) Wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord
Such simple concepts
Why are they non-existent
Somerset manages to life his head, struggles to his knees
(weakly) Let him go, God damn you
Doe checks to make sure the rope around Saint Emiliani is secure, tightening the knots
There were two men once, who had wonderful gardens
Two gardens of flowers that went on as far as the eye could see
Beautiful gardens
the fragrance was inspiration in itself
Doe stands behind Emiliani, heaves against the statue
Mills watches, gritting his teeth, rubbing the glass against the rope, fingers bleeding
() But, both gardens were beset by problems
Weeds started to take root, and there were infestations of insects and diseases
The gardens started to turn putrid
And, one man fought to save his garden, because he could never forget how it once was
Everyday he cut the weeds, and killed the insects
Fought the diseases
Doe finally topples the statue, down the altar stairs, and the other end of the rope pulls Mills upwards, screaming in pain
Mills is held, about eight feet in the air, legs dangling
() That man never had a beautiful garden again
Fuck you
The other man plowed his garden under
(pause) He plowed it under the soil
He started over
Somerset gets to his feet, steadying himself on a pew
Doe walks across the altar, picks up a long metal pole with a thick wick and candle snuffer on the end
He lights the wick from a near candle
The flame burns long and thin
He looks down at Somerset, takes out his gun
() Stay there, Somerset
Or, 'll kill him right now
Doe holds the flaming pole up, near Mills
Somerset stops
He looks up at Mills
Mills is straining
He nods to Somerset, and Somerset sees Mills cutting at the rope
Alright
you don't have to do this, John
You've already made your point
Do you think  chose this
Can you even begin to understand how painful my existence has been
It's like
like having every sense heightened beyond comprehension
Doe lowers the flame, standing below and beside Mills, with his attention focused on Somerset
() So that the stench of the street coats your throat like bile
So, sugar is so sweet it
it makes your bones ache to the marrow
You're insane
That's why
(seething) No
You're wrong
Mills continues cutting, bleeding, almost through the rope
He begins to swing his feet slightly, his body swaying
() was chosen
And 've wished a thousand times  could have been a normal man
Like David Mills, a common man
with a common life
But, wishing that is my sin
can't have it and shouldn't
Doe steps towards Mills
Don't do this
meant what  said
admire David Mills
envy David Mills
(pause) Envy is my sin
No
Just as Doe is to put the flame to Mills, the rope is finally cut through
Mills drops, swinging his legs forward, smashing Doe in the face, knocking Doe's glasses off
Mills hits the floor with a thud
Somerset runs forward
() David, get out
Doe has fallen back, dropping the metal pole
Mills scrambles to his feet and charges at Doe, shouting
Doe squints, screaming, raises his gun
Fires twice
The bullets catch Mills in mid-run, and carry him off his feet, backwards
Somerset grips his own gun, just as Mills' body falls, tumbles off the altar area and down the stairs in front of him
() No
Somerset lets out a scream of pain and rage that chokes in his throat
He falls to his knees and halts Mills' body
Somerset's shaking, unable to breathe, turning Mills over and cradling his head in his arms
Tears come to his eyes
() David
David
Please
On the altar, Doe throws his gun away
he starts feeling around him, unsteady, looking for his glasses
Mills' eyes are closed
He is still, bloody
He swallows
With one gasp, without a word, he is dead
Somerset looks up at Doe, vision blurred by rage and tears
Doe stands, putting on his glasses, faces Somerset
Somerset lays Mills' body down
Stands, walks up towards the altar, raises his gun
() You
Doe stands, quaking, teeth clenched, fists balled up
He waits for the bullets, falls to his knees
The gun trembles in Somerset's hand as Somerset brings the barrel to Doe's face
millisecond's pause
Somerset changes the angle of fire
, he blows John Doe's arm to pieces in a splattering explosion
Doe screams, falling back, on the altar floor
The entire church with its candles frames the torture: Somerset walks to where Doe flops horribly, bleeding
Somerset aims, shoots Doe in the leg
Doe screams, rolling, trying to crawl away, knocking over candle racks
Somerset follows
He shoots Doe's other leg
He shoots Doe in the other arm
Flames begin to rise and spread quickly amongst the pews
Doe continues to spasm, wrenching, hand slapping the bloody floor
, ,
Somerset steps back from Doe, overturns a rack of candles on top of him
He steps away
Watching
Flames begin rising on Doe's clothing
' Doe's face, covered in blood, twisted in agony, helpless, flames rising
He continues screaming
His glasses crack from the heat
/ -- Smoke billows from the windows
The fire is moving quickly, ravenous
It's just starting to light up the night
From the front door, Somerset walks weeping, carrying Mills' body in his arms
-- The seven deadly sin tableau burns
Flames cause the paint to bubble and blacken
Gluttony, greed and sloth are already halfway gone
Flames eat at pride, lust
Wrath and envy are being consumed
Wrath goes last
man with bloodied hands, in tones of blue
Flames devour it
-- field of blue
Cops in orderly rows
The funeral of David Mills
Many police officials and politicians stand in tribute
Somerset is here, in his dress blue uniform
He stares forward, still numb, beaten
Rifles are raised by a corps of riflemen
Blanks explode from the barrels
They reload in unison
Somerset looks towards the grace where Mills' casket lies under an American flag
Tracy is there
Tracy stands surrounded by strangers at the grave-site
Her head is lowered
She cries
Each blast of the rifle salute causes her to react with a start
-- The funeral is over
Somerset stands at the edge of the graveyard, looking at the distant city
Behind him, the mourners are still filing out to their cars
The captain approaches
He comes to stand beside Somerset, similarly solemn
don't know if  should do this
(pause) We found the motel room Doe must have been staying in after you found his apartment
Somerset hasn't acknowledged the captain, still looking away
() Anyway
we found this in his belongings
The captain takes out a sealed envelope
Somerset takes it
On the envelope:  , handwritten, in red marker
'   -- Tracy and Somerset stand near a moving truck in front of the apartment building
carry Tracy's belongings to the truck
Mills' car is attached to be towed behind
wish  could say something
(pause) Something to
don't know
'll be okay
Somerset nods
We'll keep in touch
'll come visit
'll write to you when we get there
Take care of yourself
(pause) Take care of the baby
Tracy nods
There's nothing left for them to say
They're both empty
It's time for them to give a gesture, a kiss, or a hug, to say goodbye, but neither makes the first move
That's all, Mrs
Mills
We got everything
Movers latch up the back of the truck while the driver climbs in and fires up the engine
Goodbye, Tracy
Goodbye, Somerset
Somerset walks away
Tracy walks away, gets in the passenger side of the moving truck
-- Sidewalks jammed with people, hurrying
Somerset walks in a fog, hands in his pockets
He stops at a corner, but does not cross
He stands there, looks up
At the city around him
The buildings towering over him
At the cars, buses and taxies racing in the streets, blowing their horns and spouting soot
Somerset reaches into his jacket pocket, takes out the envelope from John Doe
He studies it in his hand
(to himself) Oh
man
He opens it
He takes out a small note, handwritten
It reads: Somerset looks up again, mortified, fighting to keep control of his emotions
He looks around: At the miserable people, walking past him
At a man at the top of the subway station stairs, sitting in a cardboard box, holding out a cup, rattling the change inside
father passes by, holding his young son's hand
Somerset turns to watch them as they pass
The gather reaches to pick the boy up and carry him
The boy holds tight
For some reason, this makes Somerset ache with sorrow
The father hugs his son to him, kisses him on the cheek
The boy returns the kiss, with great affection
Somerset watches them disappear in the mass of humanity
He looks back at the note in his hand
He tears the note up, into little pieces
-- The truck moves along in steady traffic
Tracy sits beside the driver
She looks out at the city across the river
She reaches into her pocket, takes out a small manila envelope
She opens the envelope and slides two keys on a keychain out into her palm
She's looking at the keys when she notices something about the envelope
She reopens it, takes out a small folded piece of paper
She unfolds it: It is the piece of wallpaper with the pale rose at its center
She smiles very faintly
-- Cars roll by in the street
Cops come and go
Somerset walks up the stairs into the precinct house
