to reveal about 25 other sketches on the wall
All of the same dog
The actual , Johann, lies underneath the kitchen table

3/28/07 : So  think
No, 'm pretty sure that's the best one so far --- Yes

She puts a bowl of  into Jerry's hands
(') You are hungry,  am guessing
Oh, no, no

He sits at the table, starts eating
This is their routine
So where is girl

Oh, the redhead
No
She
that's over
She got smart
Like the others
Well, womenareIpretty smart

You are like Johann
Jerry stops eating, mouth full
As Johann looks up
Your -- 'm like your dog
Look at him

Labrador
But he believe
he is terrier
So is Labrador
but no labrador
Somehow Jerry can't get his eyes off Johann
Quietly: why do you think that is

Adjusting to it, Jerry drinks again -- as his
He looks at his phone, freezing
Mrs
Wierzbowski notices

Answer
Tell her you'

Then ask if she give you money for rent
But we've   on Jerry, who stares at the name on the phone
Something's affecting him deeply
He says, quietly: its my mother
Is problem
(even, quieter, gets up) is problem
'   -  - Jerry steps outside as the phone keeps , debating: Finally, he answers, as if ready for punishment: Hey, mom
Jerry stands there in silhouette
Something is happening
suddenly he loses his balance -- sinks to the floor, phone to his ear -- staring in pain -- - are gathering in their somber best, shaking hands
Across the street, we find Jerry, getting out of a taxi
Standing in a rumpled suit
Grim; the last thing he wants to do is enter that church
It's almost as if he can't
Finally, from somewhere, strength
He walks forward

- Jerry heads down the aisle, painfully self-conscious
Most of the  are in the pews, turning to look at him as he passes
When suddenly there's a    -- and Jerry as if he was expecting it -- looks over at a pointing like he was a fucking bodysnatcher and she collapses -- Jerry holds up his hands as everyone turns to look at him-- -- no
-- 'm not him
All eyes on him
His voice, sad, heartbroken: (') It's okay
'm not Paul
Locks eyes with his  and  up in the front pew
Their eyes red from crying, withered shells
And Jerry gives a lame wave before heading reluctantly up to the
Devastated, he leans in -- and we   to see the body: And it's fucking  -- Jerry's very own face, but one that seems to have been  after some kind of accident
Gruesome and handsome all at once
This was

Rachel gives up, jumps out: No we're not: the bus

- Rachel and Kyle   toward the bus stop, both struggling with Kyle's carry-on, a
garment bag, her purse, and a trumpet case marked with  (Green Bay Packers among them)-- put vitamins in your toiletry bag, don't forget to take two in the morning -- and one at night,  know -- And your inhaler, which  may need to use now, is in the outside pocket -- wait

Rachel waves her arms at oncoming cars, runs  -- As she chases the bills,  and  around her: , '

And she runs back to Kyle,  the bills in the mailbox -- You swore again
Was that our bus
Rachel looks:  to across the street, the bus is now back to Rachel:
: Okay, now were gonna
be late
She puts fingers in her mouth and   for a cab -- -  - boards and Amtrak train
Rachel and Kyle are  through the crowd toward them -- Scuze us, coming through, sorry --
Finally they arrive
Kyle's teacher,
, smiles: Under the wire -- (gulping breaths) Hi -- sorry -- Rachel Holloman, we met-- -- of course, Barbara Miller
(looks at watch) You should probably -- And Rachel's stomach drops
Knows they've been racing towards this moment all morning but still not willing to accept it
Turning Kyle to face her -- 3/28/07 14
: Okay
Now
want you to have an awesome time -- will, mom -- -- you can eat junk food, just remember to brush your teeth; and if you're gonna goof off, just be really smart about it; and try not to stay up past your bedtime, you get really cranky when you do that'-- (turns to Mrs
Miller) He gets very contrarian if he doesn't get at least eight -- 'm afraid it's time to board, Mrs
Holloman
Tears springing to Rachel's eyes
She tries to hide them
Bending down to be eye to eye with her son
Sotto -- You see all these kids
They're all calling their mothers
You just do it more -- It's only two days,: mom

Somehow, his childhood
He looks up at the stairs, as if knowing he needs to go up there
So he does

And just then, William says, quietly, through tears: You sound just like him

This is love by proxy
And now he hugs, his father in support, not unity
William pulls back
Takes his wallet from his pocket: (') want to give you some, uh
No
-- Dad, 'm okay

Wierzbowski steps from

All day they make delivery
Jerry moves fast to her, a little out of breath -- shoves a thousand dollars into her hand: Here's the rest of the rent -- next month's, too -- -- where do you get this
Just take it -- it's okay,  owe you -- had to open your apartment, too many packages come, they come for hours -- For me

Jerry starts digging
It's nast Finally, he finds it in an old take-out box --- re: the phone

He wipes it off, holds it to his ear despite the stench; (') Hello

And then: So you're a twin

And she manages a clipped, judgemental (frankly rude) laugh
Yeah,  know
that's occurred to me
3/28/07 40
: So this whole situation is obviously about him
Excuse me
would offer this whole situation isn't "obviously" about anything
Just think about it: you said your brother worked at the State Department -- -- so what
-- so that means he could've: been into anythinc -- he was a twin -:- you
received a shipment of weapons and cash and airplane manuals -- it seems to me that they sent the stuff to
the wrong brother-- Wait a minute -- you're suggesting all that stuff was for Paul
As they approach  108: Hey, 'm sorry that he died, 'm not trying to insult his memory -- he hasn't been dead long enough to become a memory
And if you knew Paul, which you did not, you'd laugh all day at the idea that he was a spy or terrorist or whatever you're implying -- 'm implying if not him
then why you
Well hasn't that been the question my whole life
You know how  know Paul wasn't a terrorist
Because if he had been, he would've been the best fucking terrorist in history: he wouldn't have gotten caught, the United States would be a crater -- he would've won awards for being a great terrorist

Why'd she choose you -- what's your day job

Suddenly they're interrupted by the approaching in the distance
Rachel stops dead and on , grabs Jerry's hand, all their mutual hostility vanished: Someone's coming
And what's approaching is the "Hassad DryCleaners

It comes to a stop and out steps the Middle Eastern Man
Stands some twenty-five feet from them
Are you Jerry Shaw

Rachel grabs Jerry's arm as the man reaches into his jacket -- (') -- Whoa --  dropped it off like she said

You take the van (touches his : beat) 'm not listening to you any more
And the man turns to go, just walks away

Catches up to the guy and grabs him
Spinning him round -- (') What do you know
-- let me go

And they begin to struggle
Middle Eastern Man's dropped Rachel
Terrified, hesitant
Knows somehow its for her -- she answers: ' Stop him now or he will die
(looking around) How are you seeing us
Jerry and the Middle Eastern Man
Fighting
Thrashing
Throwing sloppy punches: Let go of me
On Rachel: ' Stop him now

Finally Jerry answers it, hand shaking slightly: You killed him
you killed that man
' It was unavoidable
Take the van

Reluctantly, Courier #1 punches a combination into the case's padlock, the cuff  free from his wrist
He slides it over to Jerry, who reaches for it #2    --  Jerry back, knocking the gun out of his hand

The Courier sees it too and grabs his chance: snatches up the case and  for the elevator -- Rachel rushes him, trips him -- he falls, dazed -- Jerry leaps up but Courier #2 effortlessly  him on top of the steel table,  Jerry's head into the counter, unholsters a back-up from his ankle -- brings the barrel up as: The Couriers spin to see , holding the gun that was kicked across the floor: Courier #2 drops it; Jerry rises, wipes blood from his lip
