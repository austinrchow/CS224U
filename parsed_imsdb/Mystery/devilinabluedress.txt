Written by Carl Franklin From the novel by Walter Mosley March 9, 1994 - 3rd Draft 1
-  '                 1 battered wooden desk drawer groans open and light brown skinned hands with dirty fingernails twist the cap off a pint of rye whiskey and pour liquor into a coffee cup
You know, when you fire somebody you have to stick to your guns
They screw the cap back on and lay the bottle in the drawer
(continuing) The men might get to thinkin' that 'm weak if  take you back
The cup rises to the face of  , late forties, with salt and pepper hair that was once jet black
Skin darker than a Louisiana Creole
He takes a sip and bares his teeth in a grimace from the whiskey
As he talks we gradually see more of him -- feet kicked up on the desk, fully in charge
Betty Grable like pin-up girl is giving us background in more ways than one in a swimsuit and high heels on a calendar tacked to the wall: May, 1948
(continuing) And  didn't tell Dupree that 'd give you your job back
All said was that 'd be glad to talk to you if you said the right thing
Do you have something to say
stream of cigarette smoke snakes through as the back of a man's head and shoulder nudges in and shifts nervously
Mr
Giacomo, when one of the white guys has come off a double shift and says he's too tired to work overtime, you don't fire him
Fella, what'd  tell ya
If you're not willing to give a little extra, Champion can't use you
, thirty, handsome and a much darker brown than Giacomo, takes a drag off a Chesterfield cigarette

1   :                                                       1 Through the window behind him, a team of men pour over a partly assembled airplane, their voices echoing in the hangar that surrounds the office
Benny measures out his words one at a time
(
) Now
Do
you
have
something
to say
Easy swallows his frustration in silence and thinks about swallowing his pride as well
And then: want my job back, Mr
Giacomo need to work and  need a good job
(
) Is that all
Easy looks down into the smoke and sits up straight to keep from bowing his head
No, that's not all
need money so that  can pay my mortgage and eat
need a house to live in and a place to raise children need to buy clothes so  can-- 'm sorry, fella, but  gotta get back to work
And he swings his feet down and stands up to go
But Easy is up too, blocking his way out the door
Ezekiel, Mr
Giacomo
Hunh
My name is Ezekiel
Ezekiel Rawlins
Benny clinches his fists and focuses on Easy's chest like a fighter
And Easy rocks back on one foot ready to score a field goal with his right knee
Slowly, Giacomo's face creases into a plastic grin and he shrugs

And he walks around Easy, shaking his head as if amused
Easy watches him go as the low moan of the baritone sax from Duke Ellington's "Absinthe" snakes up like sin and we 2                                                         2 And watch the titles, the last one reading "Two Weeks Later"

'  -                                            3 Black and grey cars, Packards and Buicks from 1928 to 1948, come and go on Central Avenue
Two-storied storefronts with canvas awnings, above black men and women in hats
all in a hurry
The Red Car rumbles through and then a white Cadillac convertible pulls to the curb in front of a butcher shop
Above the shop on the next floor are large partly open windows with '  in boldface letters
Inside sits Easy, back to the window reading the classified ads

'                                                  4 -Bone Walker's "Westside Baby" plays on the jukebox as Easy takes a final drag off his cigarette and stubs it out
of the    lies face up on the table beneath the ashtray displaying   of a middle-aged white man and his pretty young woman companion smiling and waving
Above the happy couple is a headline " "
The caption under the photo reads "Wealthy civic leader, Todd Carter, shown here with his lovely bride-to-be, Daphne Monet, at a fundraiser last month was unavailable for comment on his surprising withdrawal from the Mayor's race
" Catch ya later, Joppy
An older black man hitching up his pants underneath a bloodstained butcher's apron has slapped his empty beer glass down hard on the counter on his way out

4   :                                                      4 Hey, watch the marble
Dammit, what'd  tell you
The fifty-year-old burly bartender leans over his big stomach checking for cracks and buffing the veiny marble top of the bar with a filthy rag
Behind him is a yellow billboard from 1932 with big black letters reading "Fuller vs
Shag
10
" We could make out more of the poster and the eight-by-ten framed boxing photos around it if it wasn't so smoky in the place
Joppy, how much they payin' out there at McDonell Douglas
don't know
Don't it say-- His words hang as his eyes stray toward the door
Easy looks up also at which fills with the large frame of the white in an off-white linen suit, his pale eyes surveying the room
Satisfied that all but two of the six tables in the tiny room are unoccupied, he smiles at Joppy and walks to the far end of the bar
Easy is surprised to see Joppy, tough ex-heavyweight that he is, duck his head and smile as he makes his way over like he's answering a summons
The white man extends a friendly hand and the two of them shake like old friends and lean in close to talk in private
Easy finds it hard not to watch their conversation as he takes a sip from a short glass of bourbon on the rocks
After a moment
Easy, come on over here
This here's somebody  want ya to meet
Come on
This here's a friend of mine
Easy drains his glass and stands up, then walks over
Yeah, Easy
This here's Mr
Albright
You can call me Dewitt, Easy
5
4   :   (2)                                              4 He extends his hand and Easy shakes it
How ya doin'
(bowing and grinning) Mr
Albright and me goes back to before the war when  was still in the fight game
(to Easy) Ever seen this guy fight
Any time Joppy Shag stepped in the ring you knew you were gonna see some real knock-down-drag-out- fisticuffs
Where you from, Easy
(awkwardly) Houston
Houston
Joppy's hometown
Joppy pours Albright a straight shot of Wild Turkey and the big man sips it
So  hear you need a job
Easy throws a look at Joppy, but Joppy is busy buffing the bar and putting more of Easy's business in the street
Aw yeah, Easy always tryin' to do better
Got his high school certificate from night school
He's threatenin' up on some college
And he's one of the few colored men around here who owns his own house
Shoot, he pays a mortgage every month just like a white man
Property owner, hunh
He turns up his drink and sets the empty glass down on the counter
6
4   :   (3)                                              4 (continuing) These big companies, don't give a damn, do they
He reaches in his coat pocket and produces a business card and scribbles something on it
(continuing) If you need a job, drop by this address at seven tonight
Easy takes the card and glances at it
What kind of work you do
do favors
do favors for friends
Drop by
He nods to Joppy and walks out the door
Who the hell is that, Joppy
Just somebody  know
bidness man
What kinda business
Oh,  don't ask him all that
He comes in here every so often looking for somebody to do a little job for him
He pays good
In other words, he's a gangster
didn't say that
But if there's a dollar laying in the street don't think he'll let a little dirt stop him from picking it up
If you worried about making that house note this month, maybe you wanna pay him a call
All them pretty girls you be with ain't gonna buy you a house
7
4   :   (4)                                                 4 Easy cocks his head "Are you crazy
" (continuing) Sound like he just wants you to keep your eyes open for somebody
He'll pay you whether you see anything or not
If it was me 'd take that man's money and go on about my bidness
Ain't nothin' to worry about
Easy is still suspicious, but can't take his eyes off the card
(
) When somebody tells me "Don't worry,"  usually look down to see if my fly is open
noticed Albright didn't bother to pay for his drink

' '46  -                                     5 Little single family houses with tiny yards of St
Augustine grass rush toward the amber Indianhead hood ornament on Easy's car
6
'                                                   6 Duke Ellington's "Mood Indigo" plays on the radio as Easy heads for home in thought
(
) (continuing) DeWitt Albright reminded me of somebody  knew back in Houston
His name was Raymond Alexander but we called him Mouse
Mouse called hisself a businessman too
And found out that  shouldn't be nowhere around when Mouse got down to his business
learned that the hard way
neighbor sweeps out her front porch and waves at Easy as he slows down in front of his house
7
'  -                                           7 He gets out of his car and a group of children chasing a man giving goat cart rides, washes past him in the street
8
7    :                                                       7 with an unruly head of hair and full beard pushing a wheelbarrow with a double edged axe wheels up behind Easy as he opens his gate
Want me to knock down some of them trees back there for you
(irritated) No
Just leave the trees alone
Easy continues up his walkway past flower beds of dahlias and wild roses and stops on his front porch to check on his African violets in a jar next to the front door
8
'                                                 8 He walks into his tiny living room and tosses his jacket onto the sofa
Then moves on through the kitchen and out the back door
9
'  -  -                               9 He picks up a water hose and turns on the faucet, watering and admiring his apple, avocado, pomegranate and banana trees as he lights a cigarette
(
) had moved to Los Angeles right after the war with three hundred dollars and the
Bill
And liked coming home to a place that was mine
According to President Truman  had that comin' to me 'cause  had fought in 'the good war' against Hitler in Europe
But that didn't mean a damn thing to a lotta white folks including the foreman on my job
So, here was out of work needin' thirty-two dollars to pay the mortgage
That was three days pay on my old job -- and  had about three days to get it
10
-                                     10 Easy parks in front of a large Spanish-style building
He gets out and walks to the black wrought iron entrance

11
-                                            11 Easy makes his way through the overgrown patio with roses and vines cascading down from office windows on the second floor
A12
-                                              A12 Someone is watching Easy as he looks for the right office
12
-                                            12 small white  pops out from behind a hedge startling Easy
He wears a suit that also serves as a uniform
What are you doing here
'm looking for, uh
We only take deliveries between nine and six
No, no
Yes, we do
Now you'd better leave
He clutches a baton in his hand and swats it into his open palm
Uh
Albright
What
'm here to see Mr
Albright
DeWitt Albright
Where's your delivery
He holds out his scrawny hand
have an appointment -- 'm supposed to meet him
10
12   :                                                     12 Did he give you a note to come in here after hours
Easy only stares, hating this little man
Well, did he
Because if he didn't-- Forget it, man
Next time  see him 'll just tell him you wouldn't let me in
Disgusted, Easy turns to leave
Hold on
He sizes up Easy and then points across the courtyard
(like an order) Across that way to the left and down the stairs
Easy half nods/half glares and walks away
13                                                              13 At the other side of the garden Easy turns a corner and heads down concrete steps
At the bottom he opens a door leading into 14
-                                        14 He looks into the boiler room but turns into an empty corridor stopping at a heavy steel door at the end
He knocks
After a moment a tall and slight  with curly brown hair and the complexion of an East Indian opens the door
15
15 short and stocky kind of Chinese-looking  stands against the door at the far end
The Tall Man ushers Easy into the clutter of heavy metal tools, cans of paint and cleaning solutions
card table with two chairs sits idly
The Tall Man closes the door and holds out his hand
Easy reaches to shake it but the man starts to pat Easy on his side and Easy pushes him away
11
15   :                                                     15 Hey, man
What's wrong with you
The Chinese Man slips a hand inside his coat and the Tall Man smiles
(with an accent) Mr
Rawlins, put your hands up a little from your sides, please
Keep your hands to yourself don't let no man feel on me like that
The Chinese Man pulls some kind of weapon halfway out and takes a step forward, and the Tall Man tries to put his hand against Easy's chest but Easy grabs his wrist
Don't worry, Manny
He's okay
Just a little shaky
(indicating the door) Let him know
Manny pushes his weapon back in his coat and knocks on the door behind him
After a moment, DeWitt Albright opens up
(smiling) Easy
He doesn't want us to touch him
Leave it, Shariff
just wanted to make sure he was solo
You're the boss
You guys can go now
Easy and have some business
16
16 Easy follows Albright inside and the big man goes behind a big wooden desk and puts his bone-colored shoes up next to a half full bottle of Wild Turkey
On the other end of the desk a small radio scratches out the Glen Gray Orchestra's "Gotta Be This or That
" 12
16   :                                                     16 There is a paper calendar hanging on the wall behind him with a picture of a basket of blackberries, but other than that the room is bare
Have a seat, Mr
Rawlins
Easy takes a seat in a chair in front of the desk and tries not to stare at the tan leather shoulder holster under Albright's arm with the muzzle of the pistol almost reaching his belt
(gesturing back) Your friends, hunh
Like you, Easy
need a little help
give 'em a call
Drink
Sure
Albright pulls another glass from the desk drawer and pours a fresh one for Easy and fresher one for himself
One thing  like about working for myself
always have a bottle on the table
You wanna drink with me
Fine
You don't
Door's right behind you
Joppy tells me you're a war hero
Said you went in with Patton
Easy nods, proud but polite, and Albright pushes him a glass of whiskey
So, you want the job
Depends on what kind of job don't want to get mixed up in nothing
Walk out the door in the morning, Easy, and you're mixed up in something
Only thing that matters is if you're mixed up to the top or not
13
16   :   (2)                                               16 mean  don't wanna get mixed up with the law
Neither one of us wants to get mixed up in that
That's just rich people trying to keep me and you in our place
He laughs and takes a healthy swig and Easy takes a drink too
'm looking for somebody for a friend
He pushes a newspaper across the desk to Easy and Easy holds it up
It's the front page with the photograph of the wealthy Todd Carter and his beautiful bride-to-be
Despite her smile, there's a sadness in the eyes
(
) Daphne Monet
fiancee of Todd Carter, one of the richest men in town
Been gone for two weeks
She leave him
Evidently
You know how it is with women, Easy
Happens to the best of us
He rears back in his chair as if expecting a sign of recognition
ain't never heard of her before
wouldn't know how to find a woman like that
That's a shame
He laughs a conspiratorial, lecher's laugh and Easy allows a smile
14
16   :   (3)                                                16 See, Daphne has a predilection for the company of Negroes
She likes jazz and pigs feet and dark meat, know what  mean
The insult takes Easy off guard but he should've known
So you think she might be down in Watts
'm sure of it
But  can't go looking for her myself because 'm not of the right persuasion, so to speak
've been asking Joppy for over a week, but all he could do was introduce me to you
What do you want me to do
Just get a location on her
Mr
Carter wants to make up with her
That's all
(smiling) That's all
He pulls out a brown secretary-type wallet and counts out 10 ten-dollar bills into a neat stack next to the whiskey
One hundred dollars, and  pay in advance
Easy eyes the money
All he has to do is pick it up
just have to tell you where she is
That's right
And keep it, you know, confidential
He freshens Easy's drink and Easy eyes the money some more
15
16   :   (4)                                               16 Joppy tells me you used to frequent an illegal club down on Eighty- ninth and Central
Somebody saw Daphne there a few nights ago
You could start tonight
Easy takes a drink and looks again at the money
17
'  () -                              17 Stripped down to its dark, naked self, Central Avenue has drawn a crowd from all over town
Neon glistens off slick pomade and silk clings to the contours of simmering flesh
An outrage to police even before the era of Police Chief Parker's personal crusade, a squad car sits idling while two dicks in blue manhandle a brother in a grey sharkskin zoot suit, prodding and whapping with nightsticks, searching for something -- anything -- because his date is a young white woman
few onlookers stand back watching, but since this white woman is not Daphne Monet, Easy only glances and walks inside
18
'                                                 18 Easy sees his fifth white  that day in a disheveled but expensive dark blue suit staggering toward him, reeking of gin
Hey, colored brother
need you to do somethin' for me-- ' Go on
What'd  tell you about hair-assing my customers
Easy looks over to see  , the small, brown- skinned manager of the place, glaring daggers at the drunk man while watching the commotion out the window
Easy starts over toward Hattie and the drunk turns and tries to grab Easy's arm
But his desperation causes him to trip and he winds up sitting against the wall
Easy steps over him and joins Hattie at the window
just paid these damn cops and they still roustin' my customers
Well, that's what he gets for being with that white woman
16
18   :                                                     18 She walks over to the cash register of this neighborhood corner store; and Easy follows, the drunk beckoning him to bend down to talk as he passes
Come on, brother help me
Don't worry 'bout him
rung Junior ten minutes ago to come get him
Easy pulls out two dollars and Hattie deposits them into the till
ain't got nobody tonight but Lips and his trio -- Holiday came through here last Tuesday
Yeah
Yeah
Heavy  are heard pounding down a stairway in the back of the store and big burly   lumbers in with a cigarette hanging from his lips
Where's he at
Hattie points to the drunk man as he struggles to get to his feet
Over there
Let Easy in upstairs and when these cops leave throw his ass out
Hey, Junior
What's goin' on
Not too much
But stick around
Junior leads the way back up the stairs
19                                                              19 17
A20
'                                    A20 You got a cigarette
Sure
He pulls out his pack and stops to light Easy up
Easy starts coughing as they continue up the stairs
Damn
How do you smoke these things
Don't you hafta work tomorrow
Naw
got fired
hint of a smile appears on Junior's face
The last time  heard these fellas playin' tonight was back in Houston, the night your ole buddy Mouse had to pull me up off your ass
Easy grins and shakes his head
That's the way you remember it, hunh
Hell, that's the way it was
And he stops to unlock the door
(continuing) When you gonna admit that you helped Mouse kill old man Navrochet
Aw, man, get off that
ain't had nothin' to do with that
Junior opens the door and Lips' alto horn slaps Easy in the face
Half of Houston, Texas seems to be jammed into this place
18
A20   :                                                     A20 Boy, it's happenin' tonight
Where's all the white women at
don't pay them white girls no mind
(sarcastically) Yeah
bet you don't
And he steps in
That's right
Just like you didn't help mouse kill his stepfather
Go on, man
And he starts away inside
Hey, Easy
Did you help him kill his stepbrother, too
Easy turns to glare at Junior and the surly field hand slaps his thigh and roars with laughter as he closes the door
After all these years the two men still hate each other
20
'                                           20 Easy looks around to see couples trying to dance; finding themselves wrestling between tables packed with five and six people each
He heads for the bar pointing a finger at a man in a black silk shirt and a foot-high pompadour hairdo
Alphonso Jenkins
flashes pearls
Hey, Easy
Hey, man, you seen a girl named Dahlia or somethin'
White girl supposed to be somethin' to look at
19
20   :                                                       20 Naw, but if  see her 'm gonna keep her to myself
Easy claps him on the shoulder and waves at skinny who is sitting at a table with five
Hey, Baby
Hey, Rita
(under his breath) What do they see in you
Finally, Easy spots a fifty-year-old  in an old grey tweed jacket sitting in a corner at a table by himself
Looking like the God fearing, all fearing Baptist deacon that he is -- he is as out of place as a whore in church as he nervously gazes about the room and massacres a plate of barbecued ribs
Easy leans over the counter to the bartender
Hey, Lewis
Gimme a couple glasses and a pail of ice and send a quart of bourbon over there to Odell's table
Lewis scoops up ice into a small bucket and plops it onto the bar with two short glasses
Easy lays a dollar on the counter and carries the set up over to the corner as he watches
burn it up
Easy stops at Odell's table
Hey, Odell
Easy
How's it going tonight
Odell doesn't miss a bite as he scopes the crowd
20
20   :   (2)                                               20 (slowly) Well
It's goin' alright
It sure is goin'
Easy Rawlins, is that you
Easy looks up to see , a big black man with a wide white grin in a white suite with blue pinstripes and a ten-gallon hat
You ain't jumped outta no windows yet
Not yet, Dupree
Miss you down at the plant
You know Coretta, don't ya
He has her in tow like a toy wagon and she offers a coy smile
Short and roundish with cherry-brown skin, she leads with her bosom
Hey, Coretta, how are ya
Coretta rests her sloe-eyes on Easy and Odell and the church going man almost chokes
Oh, my goodness
Could we sit down with y'all
Sure
Sure
Dupree and Coretta settle in
You know Benny just wants you to say you're sorry, Easy
And he'll give you your job back
'm a sorry man, all right
Any man without his paycheck is sorry
21
20   :   (3)                                                 20 Dupree laughs, smacking the table so hard it rattles like an earthquake
And Coretta's smile ignites like a slow fuse causing Easy to feel it all the way down his spine
man with his hair marcelled back swoops in and pulls a quart of Old Crow from his overcoat and sits it on the table
Easy reaches for his wallet but Dupree beats him to it
got it, Easy
Your money ain't no good up in here
Naw, Dupree
This one's mine-- You sure
You the one outta work
Coretta frowns at Dupree as Easy counts out three dollars
And you're the one ain't never got no money
Aw, Baby
(to bootlegger) Get us another couple glasses
And he peels off a dollar and hands it off
Either one of y'all seen a white girl named Dahlia or somethin' with a ''
Odell shakes his head "no," and Coretta looks away as if insulted leaving silence until Hey, Coretta got a new job at the phone company
He squeezes his woman in close and Coretta softens up and burns that smile again
Easy grins and nods "congratulations

21   :                                                       21 John's is only half full and the band is gone
The jukebox echoes Lena Horne's "Prisoner of Love" and Dupree leans back in his chair, snoring -- mouth wide open
Odell gets up and starts to amble off
Hey, you goin' home, Odell
Concentrating totally on keeping his balance, Odell waves feebly without looking back
Easy is droopy-eyed from the booze but Coretta just looks a little sexier
She straightens Dupree's hat on his head and twists up her nose
He used to play till the cock crowed
But that ole cock don't crow nearly so much now
She levels her perpetual "come on" onto Easy and he nods sluggishly and lifts himself to his feet
Think 'm gonna head out
You be sorry if you go
She slides her hand inside her blouse and discreetly lifts her bodice to air her breasts
think 'd be more sorry if stay
He turns to go
Daphne sleep by now
You can't get none of that tonight
Easy turns and Coretta plays with the ice in her glass
You been telling everybody Dahlia, but her name is Daphne
You know her
23
21   :    (2)                                             21 Coretta leans back and fans her bosom
22
'  -                                   22 Easy struggles with Dupree, and Coretta gives him a hand as they drag him from Easy's car to her front door, the big man's feet plowing two deep furrows in the lawn
23
'                                           23 Coretta pushes the door open and Easy hauls him in
Throw him in there on the bed, Easy
Easy pulls and pushes Dupree's dead weight into Throwed him outta his place, 'cause he couldn't pay the rent shouldn't even let him sleep here
Finally Easy manages to pile Dupree onto the bed and then stands up panting and sweating
Damn
Coretta leads him out into 24                                                    24 need a cigarette
Coretta shines her hazel eyes on him
That all you need
Easy grins nervously and clears his throat
Coretta, sun catch me tip-toein' out your door and no tellin' what your neighbors say
24
24   :                                                     24 Dupree run through his money, fall asleep on me
And you just gonna walk out on me like  was dog food
You got a man in the other room
Why don't you tell me 'bout your friend Daphne
Coretta strolls up to Easy, pressing her body against his
Why you keep askin' 'bout her
Colored women ain't good enough for you no more
She undoes a button on his shirt and kisses his chest, and unbuttons another working her way down
Easy sweats harder than when he was lifting Dupree
What if he hears somethin'
(
) Way he snorin'
- Oh yeah, daddy
You hittin' my spot
Oh yeah
yeah
The top of her dress undone, Coretta is straddling Easy who is hitting her spot and his too, in a rhythm
Eyes closed, he bites his lip to hold in the ecstasy so as not to awaken Dupree, who is sawing logs -- shredding 'em -- in the bedroom
Suddenly Coretta tears herself off of him and sits back on his knees
Easy writhes and shakes like a power line shorting out
(coy, shy) Oooh, that's just too good, Easy
Easy tries to pull her back but she twists down to the floor
can't give up that much love, daddy, not the way things is
25
24   :   (2)                                               24 (out loud) What things
She shushes him with a finger and twists her head toward the bedroom
You know, Dupree's right there in the next room
(full voice) Forget about him
You got me goin', Coretta
Coretta quiets him again and he comes back to his senses
But it ain't right, Easy
Here am doin' this right in the next room and all you doin' is nosin' after my friend Daphne
Daphne
(and then remembers) Oh, yeah
ain't after her, baby
That's just a job
What job
Man wants me to find her
What man
Who cares, what man
don't want nobody but you
He pulls her toward him but she pushes him away
But Daphne's my friend-- Frustrated, he sits back against the sofa and Coretta, sensing that he is snapping out of her spell, slides forward onto him giving him her spot again
And within moments they are back at it
26
24   :   (3)                                                 24 Oh, baby
Oh, daddy, you hittin' my spot
Oh, yeah
(
) went on hittin' her spot until just before sun-up
: 25
'  -                                       25 The sky is light purple as Easy stumbles down Coretta's porch
She waves half-heartedly and closes the door as he straightens his clothes and looks around for any "witnesses" on his way to his car
: 26
'  -                                           26 Easy's Pontiac pulls to a stop in front and he gets out
(
) It occurred to me that Coretta had found out a lot more about what was up to than  had wanted her to
But  had found out that the rich man's woman had a colored boyfriend
It had cost me a sawbuck to get Coretta to give me that information
Well, let's just say somethin' had cost me ten dollars
27
'  -  -                               27 Golden morning light streams in through the window
Outside, a dog is barking at a bird on the fence
Coffee percolates on the stove and Easy walks over and pours himself a cup
He moves to the breakfast table and sits down by the window looking out onto the street as he opens up a blue envelope in a stack of mail
Gradually he begins to silently mouth the words and sits up, his eyes getting bigger until he finds himself reading aloud
"Since Etta Mae has left me and am a bachelor  figured  could come out and visit and we burn down the town
() 27
27   :                                                    27 (') Write me and tell me when's a good time
" (looks up) Aw shit
28
'  -                                        28 Easy waters his lawn in deep thought
(
) The letter from Mouse was worrying me in more ways than one
All had to do was call Albright to earn the hundred dollars  already had in my pocket
But the last time got money that easy  got it from Mouse -- fifty dollars -- And the next day  had to join the Army to leave town
: 29
-                                        29 younger Easy is driving, his hair greased up high in a pompadour with a pencil line moustache framing his top lip
man in a wide brim Homburg hat looks away out the passenger window
Drive to the trainyard, Easy
Let's dump this damn thing
(suddenly alarmed) This ain't your friend's car
What'd you do Mouse
(still looking away) Just drive this sumbitch
The drone of the engine takes us 30                                                      30 with a whole family's belongings tied down onto a flatbed rolls up
and a bunch of  fill up the cab
Bye, Easy

30   :                                                       30 Where you goin', Sophie
Back to Texas
It's too fast for me out here
She waves and keeps on trucking
He watches her wistfully and then catches sight of across the street in a neighbor's front yard, axe in hand, about to swing on a lemon tree
Get away from there
He picks up a rock and throws it, and then chucks another sending the scruffy vagabond wheeling his barrow off down the street
Easy shuts off the water and walks back up on his porch
He picks up a glass of lemonade that sits at the foot of a chair on top of front page heading reads "' " Below it of a smiling Matthew Teran, with lips too thick for a white man, getting out of a limousine
31
It's                               31 - Easy is asleep on the porch
Finally, he wakes up to the ringing and heads into the house
32
'  -                                       32 Easy flops on the bed and lifts the phone off a cherry wood nightstand
Hello
Mr
Rawlins, 've been expecting your call
What
29
32    :                                                        32 hope you have good news for me
Mr
Albright, is that you
Sure is, Easy
What's shakin'
Easy clears his head
He has slept away the day
got what you want
She's with-- Hold on to that, Easy
like to look a man in the face when we do business
Meet me at the Fisherman's Pier in Malibu at the hamburger stand in an hour
Uh
don't know about that Mr
Albright -- Mr
Albright
He realizes that Albright has hung up, and swears under his breath
33
-                                 33 The headlights from Easy's car illuminate the cliffs that fall alongside the winding two-lane highway
34
'  -                                            34 Easy is cautious, checking the rearview mirror more often than usual
(
) wasn't used to going to white communities, like Malibu, to conduct business
Champion Aircraft was in Santa Monica but drove out there in the daytime, did my work and came home
never loitered nowhere except among my own people, in my own neighborhood
A35
-   -                            A35 The lights from the   pier can be seen in the distance as Easy parks his car
And    the voices of teenagers in raucous conversation can be   heard above Glenn Miller's big band playing "Silhouette   In The Moonlight" on the jukebox
30
A35   :                                                     A35 Easy gets out and starts toward the pier
35
-                                        35 Easy walks past the hamburger stand and on to the railing that looks out over the ocean
Hi
He spins around and sees a chubby 17-year-old white  in a tight-fitting skirt
He nods respectfully and turns away to look out at the water, hoping she'll leave
It's pretty out here, huh
Yeah
It's all right
'm from Des Moines in Iowa
Where are you from
(without looking back) Huh
Uh
Texas
Do they have an ocean in Texas
The Gulf, they have the Gulf
She leans on the rail next to Easy and he glances over his shoulder, seeing a couple of the young men looking around like they've lost someone
think they're looking for you
Who cares
My sister brought me 'cause my parents made her
All she wants to do is make out with Herman and smoke cigarettes
- Hey, you
What are you doing
The five-foot-six-inch twenty-year-old charges straight up to Easy
31
35   :                                                       35 (yelling) Leave him alone, Herman
We were just talking
You were, huh
(to Easy) We don't need you talking to our women
Easy braces himself as five of Herman's  rush over, including one built like a football player
Hey
What's wrong
Nigger's trying to pick up Barbara
Leave him alone
We were just talking about the ocean
' Barbara
Football gets right in Easy's face
Hey, fella, what's wrong with you
couple of the other boys have picked up sticks and are surrounding Easy against the rail
don't want no trouble
You already got trouble, boy
Listen
was just being polite
No, you weren't
You were talkin' about the ocean
Excuse me
Easy sees Albright's Panama hat appear behind Football
32
35   :   (2)                                                 35 What do you want
And he whirls around to Albright's smiling face, just in time to see him pull that rifle-like pistol from inside his coat, leveling it at his eyes
want to see brains
want you to die for me
Albright cocks the hammer
It sounds like a bone breaking, and Barbara starts crying in her sister's arms
(quickly) 'm sorry, sir
Easy nods but Albright is not satisfied
The question is: "Are you sorry enough
" Yessir
Then prove it
Show him
Get down on your knees and suck his peter
Football starts crying
(to Albright) think he got the point-- (to Football) You heard me
He presses the barrel to the boy's forehead and Football goes down to his knees
The other young men look on in horror
Son of a gun
You were gonna do it, weren't you
He slaps the barrel of the pistol into the side of the boy's head
Football screams and the others scatter
33
35   :   (3)                                                 35 Sick bastard
He smacks him again, and blood is everywhere
Get out of here
You call the cops, 'll kill ya
Football manages to stagger to his feet and stumbles away into the darkness back out toward the parking lot
36   Albright wipes his gun with a handkerchief and slides it         36 back into the holster
don't think they'd dare call the cops
(giggles) But it'll cost me a few bucks if they do
He claps Easy on the back as if it's all been in fun and giggles like a kid on his way toward the hamburger stand
Easy looks at him numbly and tags alongside, clutching his anger in tightly clenched jaws
What you got, Easy
You sure no harm is gonna come to that woman 'cause of me
Albright doesn't break stride
Course not
Mr
Carter wants to buy her a gold ring and live happily ever after -- What do ya got
Easy exhales, feeling trapped, but he's come this far
Woman told me she's with a man named Frank Green
Albright stops; the charm gone, he's all business
Where
34
36   :                                                    36 He's got an apartment at the Skyler Arms on Skyler and Eighty-third
Albright scribbles it down on a note pad
Anything else
Frank's a gangster
hijacker
Liquor and cigarettes
He's real good with a knife
Albright is unable to suppress a smile
Ever seen him in action
Naw
just heard about him
Albright, still grinning, pulls out the brown "secretary" and counts out more bills
Here's another hundred
He shoves the money into Easy's hand
Buy ya a burger, Easy
He starts into the screen door of the hamburger stand but Easy declines
No thanks, Mr
Albright
How come you let those boys get around you like that
War hero should have been able to pick 'em off one by one before they got you against the rail
don't kill children
For some reason this is hilarious to Albright
He throws his head back and wheezes out an almost silent belly laugh, then winds down
35
36   :   (2)                                                 36 Take it easy
He disappears into the hamburger joint and Easy walks away back toward his car
37
'  -                                         37 Easy pulls in front of his house and notices a dark Ford parked across the street as he gets out of his car
tall, skinny white  in a dark blue suit gets out just ahead of his slightly shorter and heavyset
Easy watches them as he moves toward his walkway
Mr
Rawlins
Yeah
They approach fast but cautiously, the fat one with a hand in his pocket
Mr
Rawlins, 'm Miller and this is my partner, Mason
They both hold out badges
Mason is a slob with grease spots on his wrinkled tan suit
We want you to come with us
Where
You'll see
And he takes Easy by the arm
You arresting me
You'll see
And he starts pulling Easy toward the street
got a right to know why you're taking-- 36
37   :                                                      37 Easy takes one to the diaphragm, and as he doubles over the fat detective slips the handcuffs on behind his back
You got a right to fall down and break your face, nigger
You got a right to die
The two cops drag Easy to the car and dump him into the back seat where he lies gagging as the car whisks away
38
38 Easy's head sags down as he's dragged through the front door past blurred blue bodies that talk
(
) You got 'im, huh, Miller
(
) Yeah, we got him coming home
Nothing on 'im
door opens and Easy finds himself being flung inside
39
39 On his knees he hears the door close and looks up at a single, bare wooden chair resting on the corroded linoleum floor
He crawls to one of the urine-stained corners, and looks down on a dry, flat corpse of a mouse
He pushes his shoulder against the unpainted plaster until he's standing and then stumbles over to the chair and sits
He looks up at the bare pipes that run along the ceiling, dripping water, and at a window with criss-cross chairs instead of glass framing, overgrown branches and leaves pushing their way in
opens and Miller comes in first carrying a notebook
Ezekiel Rawlins
Yes, sir
Mason follows and closes the door
We can take off the cuffs if you wanna cooperate
37
39   :                                                     39 'm cooperating
Miller motions to Mason and he removes the cuffs
Where were you this morning at about five
(stalling) What do you mean
He means-- He plants his foot in Easy's chest and pushes him over backwards
--this morning
Easy has caught himself and stands back up
don't know
was out drinkin' and  helped carry a friend home
could've been on my way home don't know
didn't look at a clock
(wandering over) He didn't look at a clock
Easy takes a fist to the ear and struggles to keep his balance, wiping away blood streaming down
You were drinkin' down on Eighty- ninth and Central
At an illegal club called John's, weren't you
Mason moves again but this time Easy turns to face him and the fat man looks back with an innocent face, his palms turned up
You may as well answer 'cause you got bigger troubles than us bustin' an illegal bar, Ezekiel
What do you mean
What's goin' on
38
39   :   (2)                                              39 Mason has taken off his shoe and is swatting it against the palm of his hand
Means we can take your black ass out behind the station and put a bullet in your head
Now
What time did you leave Coretta James' house this morning
guess about five
five- thirty
Miller and Mason glance at each other, and Mason kicks the chair over toward Easy
Sit down
Why, 'm gonna sit down and you keep trying to knock me down
But he sits down anyway
Did you go back and see Miss James later in the day
No, sir
Did you and Dupree Brouchard have words over Miss James
Huh
You heard 'im
Did you two argue over Coretta James
Naw
He was asleep
She went to sleep too, Ezekiel
But she won't be waking up
Easy's face goes sick
39
39   :   (3)                                                39 (continuing) Where'd you go when you left Miss James' house
Easy is too stunned to answer
You heard him, where'd you go
Easy stares into space, answering in barely a whisper
went home with a hangover
Mason fires off two punches and Easy grabs his wrists and pulls him down to the floor, swinging around, straddling Mason sitting on his ass
Miller's police special presses into Easy's temple and Miller speaks to him quietly, deadly
Get up slow
Real fuckin' slow or you know what's gonna happen
Easy raises his hands and uncoils to his feet, backing away cautiously
Mason is winded and furious
Okay
Let's take him out back
He gets to his feet and reaches for his gun, but Miller stops his hand
No
Let's go
Bullshit, 'm gonna blow his-- Let's go
He pushes Mason toward the door
Son-of-a-bitch
Son-of-a-bitch
They exit the door and Easy rubs at his bloody ear
40
40
-                                      40 Easy walks down the steps of the station buttoning up his top shirt button, his hand cupped to his aching ear to keep out the chill of the night air
The street is dark and deserted like a giant black alley except for the black and white patrol car that sits at the curb
taut-faced officer leans out the window
Hey, Buddy
It's a long walk
why don't you let us give you a ride
Easy walks across the street off into the darkness
41
-                                41 snatch of  and  startles Easy as he trudges home and a car full of teenagers shoots by
And then
cruises up behind and drives alongside
Hey, you
Ezekiel Rawlins
The window rolls down all the way and a white face in a black cap appears in the window
Ezekiel, hold on
Easy keeps walking
Come on, fella
Somebody in the back wants to talk to you
don't have time right now
He doubles his pace, almost running
Jump in
We'll take you
My boss wants to talk to you
Easy cuts behind the limo and into the street headed for the other side of the bridge but 41
41   :                                                      41 The Cadillac whips a -turn blocking his way in the middle of the street while cars pass, honking, on either side
The tall angular chauffeur gets out of the car and holds up his hands as if making peace
Easy starts to make another move to escape but: (continuing) Come on
If we wanted to hurt you it would have already happened
He opens the back door and after a few moments, Easy gets in
42
-                                           42 Easy settles into the seat with his back to the driver
Edith Piaf's "Parles Moi 'Amour" adds sugar to the strong smell of cologne and the portly form of Matthew Teran sits across from him with a small   in pajamas seated next to him holding a small elephant
can see that the police roughed you up a bit
That's a terrible practice of theirs which has to change, Mr
Rawlins
Has to change
He opens his gold cigarette case and offers Easy a cigarette
Easy accepts and Teran lights them both up
(continuing) She was beaten
And died from a heavy blow to the back of the head, Mr
Rawlins
Easy begins to feel nauseous
The evening's events have caught my adopted son and  quite off guard
My household was asleep when we got the call that the police had a suspect in Coretta James' murder
Did you know that she was a friend of mine, Mr
Rawlins
No  didn't, Mr
Teran
42
42   :                                                    42 Oh, you know who  am
read the papers
You're runnin' for mayor
(correcting) am the next mayor, Mr
Rawlins
And luckily for you, a friend of the Negro
When  arrived at the station  knew right off that you were being improperly detained as is Coretta's boyfriend, Dupree Brouchard
It's this sort of thing that my administration will not tolerate, Mr
Rawlins
Absolutely will not
He sits back in his seat self righteously and offers a nod of assurance and awaits Easy's gratitude
Then after a moment
(continuing) Yes
Coretta answered phones for a while in my campaign office on 103rd and Western
In fact my people got her a job in the phone company
So when  heard what had happened  got out of bed immediately, personally because of my concern
Was anyone there with you Mr
Rawlins besides Mr
Dupree Brouchard
Any
other friends of Coretta's
No, sir
No young lady perhaps
Nobody
Of course not, Mr
Rawlins
And why should you tell a man whom you've only just met
But, believe me, Mr
Rawlins
You can trust me
43
42   :   (2)                                                 42 (shrugging) There was no one else
Teran's face sags with disappointment and then
Well don't worry, Mr
Rawlins won't tolerate your being harassed
You or any of my constituency --  was a city councilman in the Watts area for two terms with a large contingent of colored --  value all of my supporters equally
humble though they may be -- where can we drop you, Mr
Rawlins
You can let me out here
Are you sure, Mr
Rawlins
This must be quite out of your way
It's okay
The little boy stares up at Easy through big, dark almond- shaped eyes in the silence that follows
And then, Teran picks up the ivory horn that hangs next to his head
Norman, pull the car over
43
-                                       43 The limousine stops and Easy pushes the door open and gets out
Mr
Rawlins, may  offer you cab fare
Teran's stubby fingers hold out crumpled bills
No thanks
Easy closes the door and watches the long Cadillac glide away
44
43   :                                                      43 (
) There had been nights during the war that  still had trouble claiming as part of my life
Insane nights  wasn't sure ever really happened
And here  was again
Had  really just gotten out of a rich man's car who was runnin' for mayor
Running against the man  was supposed to be working for
Was he really lookin' for the same woman  was trying to find
My ear was killin' me and the buses had stopped running
And  was feeling sick
Sick from wondering if  had really hard that Coretta was dead
44
'  -                                      44 The room is a mess; trousers strewn here, shirt and shoes over there
And from the corners are haunting, ghostly whispers
' You be sorry if you go
(heavy breathing) can't give up that much love, daddy, not the way things is
, 3/4 full, sits atop the cherry wood nightstand
Another empty bottle lies next to it on its side, in front of a water glass with 1/2 inch of liquor at the bottom
'  rests on a pillow on the bed behind it, sweating, tossing and turning as the ghost gets louder
' Oh yeah, daddy
You hittin' my spot
Oh yeah
oh yeah
The voice of the ghost is reaching closer for his ear
' Oh, that's just too good, Easy
Oh daddy
oh yeah
The voice is right up in his face
' Oh, baby
Oh, daddy, yeah
Oh yeah
Oh Yea-a-h
45
44   :                                                     44 He jerks up, awake, and the phone is
It jingles a couple more times and Easy almost knocks the receiver out of its cradle reaching for it
Huh
(a woman's) Hello
Is this Mr
Rawlins
Who is this
Daphne
Daphne Monet
He sits straight up
You're looking for me
pause on the line
think you should come and talk to me, Mr
Rawlins
alone
Look, it's late-- Mr
Rawlins, Coretta has been killed
Another pause
And if you don't want any trouble from the police then you'll come
And you won't tell anyone that you're coming
Now wait a minute, Daphne
don't know nothin' about all this stuff
'm at the Sunridge Motel on 112th and Grand, Room 102
46
44   :   (2)                                                 44 Easy holds his hands up, helplessly -- "what do you want from me
" -- but no one can see and she has hung up the phone
45
-                                       45 It's a Spanish-style set of rooms with tile roofs set around a square parking lot
Easy's car pulls into the alley behind it
He gets out and scans the area looking down from a rise at the back entrance to the parking lot
And then walks down
46                                                                46 47
-  102 -                            47 Before Easy can knock, he hears: (
) Mr
Rawlins
Yeah
The door opens and she's standing there, more beautiful than the photograph
They take each other in for a moment before she steps back from the door
Please come in
48
48 It's a regular drab, cheap motel that she has given a warmer touch with colorful scarves draped over the two lamps
Would you like a drink
She indicates a pint of scotch on the dresser with an empty glass and one that she's been drinking from
No, thanks
She indicates the chair
Please sit down
She's wearing a blue dress that's plain, cutting just below her knee with a ceramic pin just over her left breast
47
48   :                                                     48 What happened to you
Have you been fighting
Easy stubs out his cigarette in an ashtray and sits down
Why don't you just tell me what you want
She sits down too, her calm but brittle exterior betrayed at the hands
She stops wringing them when she sees that he notices and takes a drink -- more medicine than pleasure
should be asking you that question
Why have you been asking about me
heard about you
Fellas at John's said you were something to see
So
You've found me
Uh
yeah
Guess  have
But you got a boyfriend  don't want no part of
Frank Green
She lights a cigarette
You can stop pretending, Mr
Rawlins
know someone hired you to look for me
In fact  had to pay Coretta not to tell you where was
you know how Coretta is
(forces a weak smile) She told me you two became 'good friends' yesterday
(tears gather in her eyes) talked to her this morning before she died
(regaining control) uh
need to go across town to see someone
It's very important
can't seem to reach him by phone
'm afraid 'd better have someone go with me
48
48   :   (2)                                                 48 Uh
Miss Monet-- Call me Daphne
Daphne-- can understand why you'd be nervous
because  threatened you with Coretta
'm very sorry, but couldn't think of any other way to get you to come
She takes another drink and stubs out her cigarette though it's less than a third gone
can't -- why don't you ask Frank
She gets up and starts to pace nervously about the room
He's out of town --
'm willing to pay you
That's nice of you but, see, 'm not really a detective-- -- know that
was just hired to ask around to try to find you for a man-- know all about that, Mr
Rawlins
But this is a gettin' a little out of hand-- --Mr
Rawlins-- --Easy
49
48   :   (3)                                                48 Easy
If you don't help me, then 'll call the police and tell them that you were with Coretta before she died and that you've been after me too
That stops Easy
You'd do that
Yes,  would
don't want to but would
She hates herself for threatening and decides to change direction, moving in close
Please let me pay you
No
can't do that
Why
don't want no part of all this
Please, 'll pay you twenty dollars
No dice
Thirty
or even more
Name your price
She moves in closer, massaging with her voice
(continuing) Go ahead
There's gotta be something that you want
Her eyes make an offer, but he's a better man than me and he's not taking
50
48   :   (4)                                               48 (angrily, sarcastically) What
Are you afraid 'll yell rape or something
She walks away and turns up her glass, her desperation, raw, unguarded
Uh, Miss Monet
Daphne, 'm sorry but  really better be goin'
He starts out and she runs to stop him
Easy, don't touch that door-- He opens it and Like an alarm, she's  all of the scale
49   He looks out and sees                                          49 in other rooms
50                                                       50 He looks back frantically and grabs her by the shoulders
Crazy assed broad
What the hell are you doing
'm really very sorry
really am
She pulls on a coat and grabs her purse
(continuing) didn't want to do this but
Shall we
She grabs an already packed suitcase and is out the door
51
-                                      51 Easy's Pontiac snakes up the winding road, city lights glimmering in flashes below as it rounds the curves
51
52
'  -                                          52 Ben Webster's "'ve   Got It Bad" plays on the road as Easy shifts nervously in   his seat, his eyes searching in the rearview mirror and   all around for headlights that might be unfriendly
Daphne    leans back against the passenger door, taking him in
Easy passes a police car pulled over to the side
He looks in the rearview mirror and its headlights go on
He takes a deep breath, bracing for the worst and Daphne looks back concerned
But the lights arch a -turn and head back the other way
They must not have seen us that well
God, Frank and  have been pulled over so many times thought-- She catches herself and looks over at Easy
(continuing) Easy, 'm sorry
Don't be mad at me
Easy keeps his eyes on the road
(continuing) Come on
She tries to touch his arm and he pulls away
(continuing) You really hate me, don't you
How much further is it
Around the next bend
(she grins) You remind me of Frank when he gets angry
Ain't nothin' about me like Frank
Your jaw sets just like his when-- 52
52   :                                                      52 don't get no kick outta risking my life for some white woman's entertainment
(sighing) Just park behind the Studebaker
53
'  /
'                       53 The Studebaker is parked at a deadend in the street
Easy pulls in behind
The cabin is so overgrown with ivy that all this is visible is the mailbox and address
Did you bring a gun or something
What
No
Easy, that's not very smart
Everybody carries a weapon now a days
(defensively) Well then where's yours
Search me sometime
You'll find it
She gets out of the car
Damn
He frowns and gets out of the car
54                                                               54 55
'  -                                     55 Daphne waits, clutching her suitcase and lets Easy lead the way
They get to the door and find it ajar
Easy takes a look inside and then cautiously steps in
53
56
'  -                                         56 He flicks on the wall switch
It's a typical little hideaway that the rich kept for summer use
The living room, dining room, and kitchen are all in one with a long counter separating the kitchen
On the left is a wooden couch with a Mexican rug thrown across it and a metal chair with tan cushions for the seat and back
The opposite wall is all glass with the city lights blinking in the distance
Mr
McGee
No answer
Easy leads them to a door and opens it
57                                                                57 Another wall of glass and spread out on the king-sized bed, with the contents of the dresser and closet strewn all over the room
Oh, my God
She gags and backs out of the room with her hand over her mouth in case she throws up
Easy takes out a handkerchief and holds it over his mouth and nose as he gets a closer look at the body
It's the drunk white man he had seen at John's Speakeasy in the same blue suit
He's lying on his back like a crucifix with a butcher knife buried in his chest
There's blood that has drained from his chest and gathered around his face and hair so dark and thick you could scoop it up like Jello
Easy actually does throw up and doubles over, dropping to a knee to keep his balance and some control
He stays there for several moments regaining his composure and then spots a spilled ashtray and a cigarette butt
He lifts it off the floor and smells it
He wipes his mouth with the handkerchief and then wraps the butt inside and puts it in his pocket
He gets up
Daphne
He hears a   start up and
Then runs out the door
54
58
'  -                                        58 pink Studebaker whips backward out the driveway
Easy runs alongside trying to stop Daphne as she screeches into the street
Hey, wait a minute
She speeds off down the canyon
Dammit
He stands in the middle of the street, watching her go
59
'  -                                           59 Fiery orange light bounces off the hood of the car into Easy's face as he turns the corner onto his block
He is surprised to see parked in front of his house
And now it's his front door that's open
He pulls in behind the Caddy and gets out
60
'                                                   60 He pushes open the door
Shariff loiters just inside, grinning at him, and Manny stands in the middle of the living room looking at the floor
From a  in another room Tommy Dorsey plays "Blue Skies" with Frank Sinatra out front
And so Easy walks past the two hoods into Albright turns from looking out the backyard window with a porcelain coffee cup cradled in his right hand
Easy
Easy looks at the coffee pot on the stove and again at Albright, smiling loose and friendly but looking tired in the same clothes he had on at the pier
What you doin' in my house, man
expected you to be home, so Manny used a screwdriver on the door
What happened to your face
55
60   :                                                      60 You got no excuse to be breakin' into my house -- What if  broke into your place
(still smiling) 'd tear your nigger head out by its root
Easy boils inside and then goes over to the counter to pour himself a cup of coffee
So what do you want
Where have you been this time of morning, Easy
went to see a girl
Don't you get none, Mr
Albright
The smile leaves Albright's face and his eyes turn even colder
didn't come here to play, boy
You got my money in your pocket and we've been over at that address waitin' all night for Frank Green and now we've found out that he moved from there over a year ago
Easy is scared and confused but he plays it off
So what do you want me to do about it
You don't think  did my job
Shit,  give you the money back
And he reaches for his pocket, but Albright reaches too -- and suddenly, Manny and Shariff are in the room and on Easy like a vice
Albright presses the barrel of the
45 against Easy's forehead
Do you believe in God, Easy
'Cause 'm curious to see if death is any different for a religious man
Easy looks down, away from the gun, and swallows hard
56
60   :   (2)                                                60 seen her
After a moment, everyone relaxes and Easy sags out from under their grip and staggers into 61                                                      61 Manny and Shariff surround him as he sits down in a chair and Albright stalks in holstering his gun
Where
She called me
Had me drive up to the Hollywood Hills
How'd she know about you
guess Coretta
the girl that told me about Daphne and Frank Green
Why didn't you call me
couldn't
She threatened to tell the cops that  had killed Coretta
Albright looks over at his henchmen
Where is she
She took off
(dangerously) Where is she
don't know
While  was looking at the body she split
(nodding) Uh-hunh
57
61   :                                                       61 Albright looks around the room as if answers lie in the corners, but he is not surprised to hear about a body
You call the cops
tried my best to keep in the speed limit
That's all  did
What'd she do, take his car
Hunh
McGee
Did she take his car
Easy hesitates, "How did Albright know his name
" Uh
Yeah
Where'd you pick her up at
She left that place-- --Write it down
To his shame Easy flinches and gets paper from his end table, then scribbles down the address and hands it to Albright who takes Easy's seat and examines the note
Get me some whiskey, Easy
Easy studies Albright who sits knees wide apart, now the master of the house, and he can't help himself
Get it yourself
Bottle's in the cabinet
Albright looks up and Easy braces himself for Albright to bring on the end, all at once
But slowly a smile spreads across Albright's face and he laughs, stamping his foot
58
61   :   (2)                                               61 Well, 'll be damned
Get us a drink, Manny
Easy, you're a brave man
need a brave man working for me
But you gotta find Frank Green, so he can lead us to her
No, thanks, Mr
Albright
People are gettin' killed all around me
You never said anything about all this
Easy, you're connectable to two murders
You'll do whatever  tell you to do
Manny brings Albright's drink and the captain turns it up and gives Manny back the glass
(continuing) Now you got three days to find him
And you make sure you count 'em right
He walks out the screen door with Manny and Shariff following
62                                                           62 Easy grabs the bottle from the counter, where Manny has left it, and pours himself a stiff one
But he only stares into the glass
: 63
-                                          63 Dense black smoke masks everything but two vague figures in a struggle
The  of heavy artillery gives way only to the deafening  of automatic fire
We are hurtling forward into a horror-stricken Easy in combat gear, repeatedly stabbing an already lifeless German soldier
Tears are streaming down Easy's face, his mouth gaped open in an inaudible
64                                                       64 He studies the glass and pushes it away
Then looks 59
65                                                        65 Albright and his two goons get in the white Caddy and cruise away
66                                                             66 He dials the operator
(
) needed help
Albright didn't flinch at hearing that Coretta was dead and he seemed to know all about Richard McGee too
(
) Number please
Raymond Alexander on
He pauses, speechless as (
) Yes
(after a moment) Forget about it, operator
He hangs up, his eyes trained in thought
A67
'  -                                          A67 crowd has gathered along the street to watch a three convertible car caravan: the first car bearing a four-place band playing "Happy Days Are Here Again"; the second with someone who could be Lana Turner holding up a "Teran for Mayor" placard with a man in the front passenger seat announcing through a megaphone; and last, but hardly least, Matthew Teran blowing kisses and waving two small American flags
Easy looks up for a moment as he closes the trunk of his car to watch the parade
Then stuffs a ball peen hammer in the waistband at the small of his back, under his jacket
He walks with a purpose into the open door next to the butcher shop
B67
'                                                B67 Easy stops in the doorway, seeing as usual buffing the marble top of his bar
-Bone Walker's "They Call It Stormy Monday" is on the jukebox
60
B67   :                                                    B67 He scans the bar and sees that there are no customers, and walks in
Hey, Easy
Easy stops at the bar and stares at Joppy
That girl called me last night
What girl is that
The one your friend is lookin' for
Uh, huh
That's pretty lucky, hunh
No, Joppy
Wasn't no luck at all
It was you
Joppy inadvertently clenches his fists and notices Easy's aggressive stance
You and Coretta was the only ones that had my phone number who knew was lookin' for her
And Coretta was busy scammin' Daphne so she wouldn't have done it
It was you, man
Maybe she looked in the phone book
ain't in the phone book, Joppy
Joppy's eyes narrow
What the hell you mean, coming up here all mad like you gonna do something
61
B67   :   (2)                                              B67 (yelling) You damn right
Coretta's dead
Your friend Albright is on my ass
The cops done brought me down once -- Why didn't you just tell Albright your damn self
(yelling back) What did  tell you
To just take that man's money
didn't tell you to do nothin'
call myself trying to help you save your house
Don't come up in here startin' no shit with me
And he pulls a baseball bat from behind the bar, but Easy has pulled his hammer and  it down hard, cracking the beveled wood that frames the marble
(continuing; panicked) Easy, wait
Watch my marble
My uncle left me that when he died
And goddammit, he's about to get it back
He draws back for the downswing, and Joppy drops the baseball bat, holding up his hands
Let's talk
Let's just talk
What you got me into, Joppy
Joppy inhales, forcing himself to be calm
She asked me to help her 'cause told her that Albright was lookin' for her
And  figured  could help you make a few bucks and throw Albright off the trail too
She wanted to know something about you so  told her
guess  must've give her your phone number
Where is she, man
62
B67   :   (3)                                                B67 don't know
Don't lie to me, Joppy
ain't lyin'
don't even know her that good
She just asked me to help her
And she asked me not to tell nobody
guess 'cause of her and Frank Green
What's she runnin' from Joppy
swear  don't know
She didn't tell me
didn't mean to get you into nothin', Easy
just
she just
mean you seen her, Easy
Man, she's something else
Easy can see "sucker" written all over Joppy as he fumbles for a cigarette with one hand and shakes his head with disgust as he lights up
Damn, Joppy
Is there any white woman that ever gave you the time of day that you wasn't a sucker for
Joppy frowns painfully and continues to wipe the bar
67
-                                  67 Easy turns into the winding driveway through the stone entrance way that bears the name of this distinguished institution on a bronze plate
He parks the car and gets   out, adjusting his dark brown Stetson which matches his   pin-stripped suit
He looks around at the massive and   well manicured grounds and walks into a patio area of this   Spanish-style complex
(
) Albright had said that when you're mixed up in something it's best to be mixed up to the top
could see his point
So that's where was going
all the way to the top
63
68
68 An   descends an outdoor curved stairway carrying a file
She spots Easy looking around confused and immediately becomes annoyed
May  help you
Uh
yes
came to see Mr
Carter
Do you have an appointment
No,  don't
Well, 'm sorry, but Mr
Carter is a very busy man
Easy pulls out Albright's business card and hands it to her
Well, tell him Mr
Albright sent me, and it's real important
She looks at the card and then up at Easy with annoyed superiority
May  ask the nature of your call, Mister
Rawlins
But 'm not so sure he'd want me to tell you
'm quite sure, Mr
Rawlins, that whatever you know is nothing can't know as well
Okay
Well, anyway, tell him 'm here with information about that little chippy of his that dumped him
Is this some sort of joke
Uh
Excuse me
64
68   :                                                     68 Easy and the secretary turn to see a   in a dark grey suit with bushy black hair and thick eyebrows standing in the doorway
He forces a smile and comes out
Mr
Rawlins was it
He holds out his hand and Easy shakes it
Yes
Mister
Baxter
(to the secretary) 'll take care of this
(and back to Easy) Why don't you come with me, sir
They walk through the door into 69                                                          69 Not very smart talking about Mr
Carter's business to a secretary
don't wanna hear it, man
It's too much goin' on for me to give a damn about what you think is smart
Baxter bristles up and slows down his walk, about to put Easy in his place
But Easy slows down too and squares up on him
Baxter reconsiders and leads the way up a stone staircase
70
'                                            70 Baxter ushers Easy into a huge elegantly furnished room more closely resembling a hall than an office with large arched doors and windows leading out onto a stone veranda overlooking a canyon
Alone looking out at the greenery on the opposite hillside is
Baxter walks out and speaks with Carter, while Easy watches them from inside the office
The rich man perks up with interest and hurries inside with Baxter who throws Easy a dirty look on his way out
He pauses uncertainly wearing a simple Sears Roebuck-looking tan suit with a plain open- collared white shirt
The dark circles under his eyes show nights without sleep
65
70   :                                                    70 Mr
Rawlins
He runs a hand through his thinning red hair, and offers an overstuffed sofa
They sit on either end
(distraught) Has something happened to Daphne
The last time  saw her she looked fine
You saw her
Yeah
Last night
She's still in town
She was last night
What did she say -- what was she wearing
blue dress
Blue heels
And a pin on her chest
Yeah, on the left side
(carried away) Oh yes, that's her
That's her
You know 've never known a woman who could wear perfume so slight that-- --Mr
Carter, Mr
Carter-- What did she say
What did she say
Oh, 'm sorry
Brandy

70   :   (2)                                              70 He points to a crystal decanter near Easy
Easy pours himself a drink and takes in Carter as he wrings his hands to keep from going to pieces
This guy's got it bad
Mr
Carter
came here to get some answers
Yes
don't know
'm takin' a helluva chance
Carter runs his hand through his hair again, the suspense killing him
(continuing) guess it's just that when 'm working for somebody,  wanna know what 'm gettin' myself into
Carter leans in as if he missed something
beg your pardon
Well, 'd like to know the real reason why Mr
Albright hired me
(after a moment) Mr
Albright
Yeah
The man you hired to find Daphne
There must be some mistake
'm sorry, busy
Who are you talking about
Easy and Carter stare at each other, not sure how to proceed
You didn't hire somebody to find your girlfriend
67
70   :   (3)                                                 70 No
Until just now  was sure that she was hundreds of miles away from here
You say someone is looking for her
Easy nods, his brow furrowed in thought
Carter gets up and walks to the door, looking out into the canyon
(half to himself) Someone is looking for her
What's goin' on between you two
Carter shrugs and stammers nervously
Uh
don't know
We were going to be married
We had a fight
(then recovering) Uh
that's none of your concern, Mr
Rawlins
He stops and looks to the floor, the gravity pulling him down
way down
(continuing) Someone's
after her
Mr
Albright
And he said he's working for me
Yeah
Do you know a man named Richard McGee
No
can't say that  do
Why would someone be after her, Mr
Carter
Uh
can't say --  don't know
He's lying and Easy knows it
68
70   :   (4)                                              70 (continuing) Do you think you could find her again
don't know
It's important, Mr
Rawlins, for her sake
'm willing to pay you
Mr
Carter, why did she leave
can't tell you any more Mr
Rawlins -- 'll pay you to find her
Easy thinks about it, and then nods
Okay
a thousand dollars
thousand dollars
Yeah
'll take two hundred right now
Mr
Rawlins
think you're trying to take advantage of me
But left me inform you that the incumbent mayor and the chief of police eat at my house regularly
Good
Then they can help us-- --No
They can't
Carter is too emphatic and Easy waits for him to give more, but instead he turns and gazes out again at the canyon
'll have Baxter write you out a check
69
70    :   (5)                                               70 (after a moment) Mr
Carter, why'd you stop runnin' for mayor
(terse) 'll have Baxter write you a check
Why is Matthew Teran looking for her too
(with finality) Baxter will write you a check
Easy takes him in and then holds out his hand
'll take cash, Mr
Carter
Carter fumbles in his wallet, and too nervous to count the money, shoves the wallet at Easy
Take it all
Just take it all
Easy nods and strides out of the room
71                                                               71 A72
-                                A72 Easy walks to his car, gets in and drives away toward the entrance
(
) So Albright was working for Matthew Teran
And whatever Teran had on Carter was strong stuff
too strong even for Carter to go to the police
But because Teran was desperate to find the girl too, that gave me the best hand
had seen her once, and if  played it right, 'd see her again
72-75                                                          72-75 70
: 76     -                                             76 Easy talks to the short, squat, suspicious woman who runs the place
Through the smoke, other distrustful eyes fix on him from pool tables and dark corners
(
) Everywhere  went was a familiar place, but different because  was asking about buying hijacked liquor from the man nobody wanted to talk about
Frank Green
: 77    -                                             77 Upscale, with a balcony
Billy Eckstine fronts the band
Blacks and whites are dressed to impress, including Easy, who leans into the bartender
(
) It was actually looking more and more like  might not make it through this little adventure  was having
But  was likin' the chill in my blood, and the freedom of working on my own
: 78     '  -                                 78 The two   unveil for Easy a case of hijacked liquor in a wooden crate
(
) There were times in the war when had felt like this
When life or death where the only two choices
That made it simple
And that was alright by me
79
'  -                                           79 Easy unlatches the gate and pushes it open
He's tired, and he trudges up the walkway to the porch
He sees standing on the front lawn of the next door neighbor's, waving at him
71
79   :                                                      79 He throws a rock and then unlocks the door
But he notices lying broken on the cement
He looks up just in time to see a -- swing down
And Easy is seeing stars
big man, dressed in black, kicks open the door and drives Easy head first into 80
'  -                                   80 Easy slams to the floor but manages to roll out of the way of a lethal
of the board onto the floor
He grabs a lamp and hurls it at the oncoming figure who catches it on the arm and keeps on coming, snapping a blade from his fist which leaps out like a chrome-colored flame
Easy scrambles back, his head butting up against the couch, his forehead streaming blood, his eyes wide with the sight of sure death advancing
(terrified) Frank
Wait a minute
need to talk to you
Frank looms over him, his   sinister but handsome brown face framed by a short-rimmed,   black Stetson hat and a black shirt and coat
He holds    the knife to Easy's neck, letting the blade press into the skin   as he talks
You the reason why she told me to lay low, hunh
Easy buries himself back against the sofa
(machine gun quick) Naw
got five hundred dollars for you
Rich man wants to talk to a white girl you know
Daphne
Frank's eyes flame and he presses the knife, drawing blood
You a dead man-- 72
80   :                                                     80 Easy, you in there
Frank's head whips toward the door and Easy knocks the knife away and comes up tussling
Frank scrambles to get away and Easy tackles him, straining to keep Frank from reaching the knife
springs open and clump in, the last one stomping down on Frank's outstretched fingers
Frank screams and cradles his hand in agony
Easy scrambles up to his knees and gawks up at , dressed in a plaid zoot suit with Broadway suspenders down the front of his shirt, a long-barreled
41 caliber pistol held loosely in his hand
Want me to kill him
(exhaling relief) Mouse
Aw, man naw, it's all right
Well, what's happenin'
He holds out his hand and helps Easy to his feet
Frank makes a slight move towards the knife and Mouse levels the pistol at his head, his gold-rimmed teeth glittering from a smile that wants Frank to go for it
'll blow your goddamned nose off
No, don't
(to Frank) Where's Daphne Monet
Frank just stares up at Easy, his eyes sharp and defiant
Look, if you don't know where she is, maybe we can help each other find her
After a moment, Mouse cocks the hammer
73
80   :   (2)                                                 80 Nigga, you heard him
No, Mouse
Don't kill him
The phone  next to Mouse and he picks it up, eyes still on Frank
Huh
He's busy right now, you gonna have to call back
He hangs up
Frank, a rich man she knows is willing to pay a thousand dollars just to talk to her
thousand bucks, man
Frank still won't talk and that does it for Mouse
He releases the hammer
Easy, lemme try
He slaps Frank upside the head with the pistol
You better
(
) Talk
(
) You stupid-- Easy grabs Mouse's arm and Frank slumps to the floor
Let him go
Get out of my way
Let him be
The two friends struggle, and Frank rears up and plows into Easy, sending him sprawling to the floor on top of Mouse
Then Frank, covered in blood, hurls himself across the room, out the door
74
81   Mouse gets to his feet and runs to the door aiming the       81 pistol, but it's too late
Easy stands up and Mouse points the gun at him
Damn you, Easy
Don't you never grab me when  got a gun in my hand
Easy silently eyes the pistol and gives Mouse a chance to calm down
After a moment Mouse looks down at his jacket
Look at the blood you done got on my coat
Why you wanna go and do that
He looks out the door and grabs a small suitcase
Then spots the bathroom and moves to it, taking off his jacket and hanging the pistol in his belt
Easy holds his fingers to the bump on his forehead and catches his breath as Mouse runs water in the bathtub
Now we got to find that girl so we can get that money
No, we don't, Mouse
don't need your kinda help or  would've called you
Mouse comes out of the bathroom, scrubbing at a spot on his jacket with a washcloth
You standing there with a knot on your head the size of a twelve- year-old tittie and you "don't need my kind of help"
(angrily) This is the same shit you pulled five years ago when you asked me to drive you out to your stepfather's house, then come to find out you killed him and your stepbrother
Aw, easy, that was a long time ago
Easy glares at Mouse and dabs blood from his forehead with a handkerchief
75
81   :                                                     81 (after a moment) Come on, Easy
Cut me in on this
could help you
let you run the show
swear  will
He ambles over to Easy apologetically and holds Easy's shoulders with both hands
swear,  ain't gonna do nothin' you don't tell me to do
Easy knows he can't believe this but Everything  say
Everything you say
With no choice, Easy nods and walks into 82                                                       82 He runs cold water onto a washcloth and looks in the mirror, dabbing at his forehead
Who was that called
(
) don't know
Sound like some white girl
Easy turns toward the door "Aw Man
" 83
'  -                                           83 Mouse, in a plum colored double-breasted suit and a brown felt derby hat, turns on the radio and the Ink Spots' "We'll Meet Again" purrs out
He starts to turn the key, but then remembers and honks the horn
84
'  -                                         84 Easy opens the door and stands on the porch
Hey, Easy, was it a left on Richland or a right
76
84   :                                                     84 right
And if Dupree ain't over there in Compton, just come on back 'cause  might have heard from the girl
Just then a car cruises around the corner and Easy watches pull up across the street and get out
He glances over at Mouse
85
'  -                                           85 Mouse shuts off the radio and slumps down in the seat out of view
86
'  -                                         86 Easy watches them stroll up the walkway
Mr
Rawlins
We came to ask you a few more questions
(grinning) So why don't you just invite us inside
(holding open the door) After you
And Easy and Miller go in
What happened to your head don't remember doing all that
He laughs and closes the door behind them
87
'                                               87 Miller looks around suspiciously
The room still shows signs of the struggle with Frank Green
He exchanges a look with Mason
Been having a party, Ezekiel
Mason pushes Easy into the chair and Miller plants his foot on the seat between Easy's legs and leans in
You got a lotta cuts and bruises to be an ordinary working stiff
77
87   :                                                    87 It's looking worse and worse for you, my friend
What do you know about Richard McGee
Who
On the other side of the room Mason picks up a chunk of the broken lamp from the fight
dead white man in a cabin in Laurel Canyon
Mason comes over and stands over Easy next to his partner
He fingers the sharp porcelain shard of the lamp, threatening
He hangs out with some of those same nigger friends of yours down on Central Avenue
Easy eyes the sharp edge, making up his mind to kill this fat son-of-a-bitch if he gets too creative, and die with him
He just happened to have a note in his pocket with '
James' written on it
He holds the slip of paper up for Easy to see
Any of this making you feel talkative at all, 'cause 'll bet ya six bits to a bottle of piss that we're looking at a double here
All we need is to place you in the dead man's house
ain't been there
Where
ain't been in no dead man's house
Miller stands back and pats his pockets for a smoke
78
87   :   (2)                                               87 How 'bout a smoke, Ezekiel
Easy taps out one and Miller places it in his mouth
Got a light
Easy pulls out his lighter and sparks the flame
May
Easy shrugs and passes the lighter to Miller who fires himself up
Nice lighter
He holds the lighter out of Mason who wraps it up in a handkerchief
And we got our print
What do you mean
Oh, hadn't you heard
We found a cigarette lighter in the dead man's house with the killer's fingerprints on it
(total disbelief) Naw, man
didn't do it
Course you did, we got evidence
(frantic) didn't do it
You know didn't
And Miller leans in hard
We know that you know more than you're lettin' on
And now a white man's been killed
() 79
87   :   (3)                                                 87 (') Now you better tell us what you know, or you're goin' down for the murder of Richard McGee and Coretta James
He straightens up and Easy stands up, too
(shouting) don't know nothin'
(to Mason) Put the cuffs on
Let's take him down
As Mason reaches for the cuffs, Easy sees Mouse peek out from the kitchen doorway then disappear inside
Uh, listen
don't know who did it
But we do
He sees Mouse draw his gun, his eyes trained on Miller's back
And that's all that counts
Dammit,  didn't do it
Tell it to the
Mouse is trained with the hammer cocked and Easy is about to give the signal, but then: Look, gimme some time to find out
Forget it
Gimme till tomorrow
Tomorrow mornin'
Miller thinks about it and then-- 80
87    :   (4)                                                  87 Okay
Tomorrow morning, that's it
He nods to Mason and Easy looks up to see Mouse raise the gun and slide back into the kitchen
Mason unlocks the cuffs
Have a nice evening, Ezekiel
And he and Miller walk out
Easy looks out the doorway watching A88   '                                                        A88 get in their squad car and drive away
B88   He turns back to see Mouse standing in the living room
B88 (wearily) guess you know what would have happened if you had shot them two cops in my house
(shrugging) Hell yeah
They'd be dead
Easy shakes his head
Come on, let's go
He grabs a jacket
88-91                                                          88-91 A92
'  -                                           A92 Easy hurries out of his house pulling on his jacket with Mouse right behind
What they tryin' to pin on you
81
A92   :                                                       A92 'll tell you on the way
You got the keys
Yeah
And he hurries around to the driver's side
Before we run out to Compton we got one other place to stop by
He freezes seeing the Woodcutter watching and listening
(to Woodcutter) Man, don't you mess with my trees while 'm gone
He gets in as Mouse cranks the engine
You heard me
Leave my trees alone
As Mouse starts away the old man smiles mischievously and starts to sharpen his axe
Easy leans out the car window, yelling back as the car pulls away
mean it now
Don't you mess with my trees
92
-                                         92 It's a horseshoe of tiny apartments with over a dozen little porches and doorways staggered in a semi-circle around a small yard that has a half-dozen stunted magnolia trees growing in brick pots
Easy and Mouse step into the courtyard, passing elderly tenants sitting inside screened doors
Jimmy Lunceford's "'m Walking Through Heaven With You" floats out into the yard
They arrive at the closed door of number eight
Easy knocks and then knocks again, hard
Something  on the inside and heavy  pound to the door
Who's that
82
92   :                                                       92 Easy
The door opens and   stands there behind the screen door in blue boxer shorts and a white -shirt
What you want
It's private, Junior
Lemme in
And he reaches to pull open the door, but Junior throws the latch
ain't got time now
'm tryin' to get some sleep
Why don't you open the door, Junior, 'fore  have to shoot it down
Mouse steps out into the doorway, in plain view
Mouse
Open up
We ain't got all night
Junior forces a smile and lets them in
93
'  -                                     93 Filthy and junky, with old car parts scattered amongst old furniture, the room is unpleasant with only the benefit of a dim light -- just like Junior
'all want a beer
He nods at a card table with one folding chair and throws two others into place on his way to the refrigerator
Easy and Mouse sit down and Junior brings over a quart of and two glasses that he wipes out with a rag
What ya smokin'
Zapatas
83
93   :                                                     93 Junior tosses his pack onto the table and pours beer into the glasses for Easy and Mouse, and drinks from the bottle
Easy unfolds the handkerchief in his pocket on the table, uncovering the cigarette butt from Richard McGee's house
(to Junior) This is one of yours, ain't it
Junior looks at the butt and shrugs
You the only one  know cheap enough to smoke this shit
Why'd you kill Richard McGee
Huh
What you talkin' 'bout
Ain't no time to play, Junior know you the one killed him
You crazy, man
You crazy
And he stands up to emphasize his indignation
Sit down, Junior
Junior shifts awkwardly from side to side and then sits back down
Tell me what happened, Junior
don't know what you talkin' 'bout
Well, the police will
When they find out that they got your fingerprints up there in that man's house
What fingerprints
What house
84
93   :   (2)                                               93 Hattie had you pull that man out of John's the night  was there
And he was laying up there dead with the same suit on and a knife in his chest
ain't killed nobody
Quit lyin', you big ole sweaty- thick headed-cornbread eatin'-- Mouse can't keep from laughing and Junior starts up after Easy
You thick-headed, ya damn self
But Mouse is up, still laughing with the pistol in his hand
Sit down, man
'fore  blow your brains out
What kinda shit y'all trying to pull here
(last warning) Sit down
Junior sits down and throws himself around in the chair like a child throwing a fit
You better tell it the way it happened
And maybe 'll forget what  know
Otherwise, 'm gonna tell Mouse to shoot ya 'cause you know  don't like your ass and he don't like you either
Mouse slaps the table, laughing so hard he's in tears
Aw, man
And he aims the pistol and cocks the hammer, causing Junior to throw himself around some more
85
93   :   (3)                                                93 You killed him to take his money, didn't ya
don't even know who you-- You just had to rob him, didn't ya
didn't
didn't touch nothin' in his house
But it's in the open now and Junior frowns and shakes his head
Hattie had me take him out to his car
And he say he give me ten dollars to drive him home
Mouse is busy working a toothpick between his front teeth
know you took that
Hell, yeah
Then he asked me about that white girl you was askin' everybody about at the club
And told him  seen her with Coretta
What the hell  care if he know
You tell him but you won't tell me
don't like your ass, Easy
And he gimme fifty dollars
(disbelievingly) Fifty dollars
Just to tell him you seen her with Coretta
Naw
To deliver a letter
Easy is stopped for a moment
What letter
86
93    :   (4)                                                 93 How should  know
He just said to give it to her
And you knew where she was
didn't say that
give it to Coretta to give it to her the next mornin'
You 'spect me to believe that
Why would he trust you to give it to the girl if it was worth fifty dollars
'Cause he had to blow town, fool
Easy stops to make the connection
Why
He didn't say
(after a moment) You better be tellin' the truth
Let's go, Raymond
He and Mouse get up
'm tellin' the truth
ain't killed nobody
That man was alive when  left him
Easy opens the door, looking back at Junior, who's still going on and walks out
94-95                                                          94-95 96
'  -                                            96 Compton looks a lot like Texas, with unpaved streets and little country-styled houses set back away from the road behind vegetable gardens and chicken coops and small sheds with a horse or a cow tied up
87
96   :                                                       96 Easy and Mouse pull into    the gravel driveway of a little house and are met by the    usual barking dog you find in the country -- part Spaniel,    part Shepherd, and some kind of Retriever
It dogs Easy     and Mouse's heels as they get out of the car
97
' '  -                               97 They notice the light in the front window go out and the shade pull back slightly as they walk toward the front door
Moments later the door opens and the dark figure of Dupree Brouchard appears
(to the dog) Go on
Go on in the back
The dog obeys and Easy and Mouse walk up the walkway
Hey, Dupree
Been trying to call you
Yeah, Easy
Cops just let me out today
My sister gone to work and didn't feel much like talking
Raymond
Hey, big man
Them pigtails smell
Yeah
Lula Mae made some 'fore she went to work
Dupree ushers them in
98
' '  -  -                     98 Dupree's face under the kitchen light shows two swollen black eyes from a brutal police "questioning
" His eyes are heavy with liquor and tears glisten down his cheeks
Why somebody wanna kill her like that
Why
don't know, Dupree
don't know
88
98   :                                                       98 Dupree pours rye whiskey into a water glass in front of Mouse, who swallows half the shot without looking up from his plate of food
Easy declines when the bottle comes his way, feeling the pressure of time running out
Did Coretta ever say anything to you about a letter she was keeping
Letter
What kinda letter
For that white girl
Naw
But  know it was on account of her that Coretta got killed
Easy rears back in his chair with keen interest and Mouse looks up from his pigtails
Dupree takes a drink and his eyes narrow in anger
(continuing) Everything between Coretta and that Daphne was always such a damn secret
mean that ole girl didn't think nothin' about two- timin' on Frank
She probably 'innerduced' Coretta to one of them ole guys she knew
And when he came to the house after Coretta
(starting to break) he found out she wasn't that kinda woman
Cops said she fought him
aw my Gawd
fought him 'cause she wouldn't have nobody but me-e-e
He buries his face into his hands and Easy throws a sad but frustrated look to Mouse
(continuing) Aw Gawd,  can't even go to sleep
'cause  can still see her face that mornin' 'fore  went to work
() 89
98    :   (2)                                                 98 (') Junior had been by and just left the house
and she came runnin' out to the car carrying her bible
And she said, 'Keep this for me, baby
' Easy and Mouse exchange looks
And Dupree falls apart
(continuing) Police won't even let me go near her house
So it's the only thing got left from her
It was a sign
know it was a sign, 'cause she was so religious
It's all right, big man
it's all right
And he pours Dupree a half glass of rye
99      - ,                                         99 Barely a "corner" of whiskey lies at the bottom and is snoring like a buzzsaw, sound asleep
squints into his glass, wondering why it's empty, and looks down the length of the kitchen leading into 100     -                                              100 Drawers are pulled out on the dresser, and Easy is rifling through another until he pulls out a bible
He fans the pages, finding already opened
His fingers pull out a photograph and then two more
His excited face goes sick, and he silently mouths: Holy shi-it
90
100   :                                                       100 (
) was as nauseated from fear as was from what  saw
Pictures of a much younger Matthew Teran and children
innocent, helpless, naked children
101                                                             101 Easy hurries in holding up the letter
got it
Come on,  think that girl is gonna call again
That Dupree is a good man, but he sure can't hold his liquor
Easy grabs his coat off a chair and starts to put it on, stuffing the letter in his coat pocket
You got your sails up pretty far too, Raymond
You callin' me drunk
Well, you been puttin' it away along with him and-- If  was drunk could  do this
And in less than a heartbeat he has pulled that long- barreled pistol and is aiming it at Easy's forehead
Ain't a man in Texas can outdraw me
(forced calm) Put it down
Go on
And he puts the gun back in his shoulder holster
91
101   :                                                    101 Go for your gun
Let's see who gets kilt
don't have a gun, Raymond
Come on, let's go
You fool enough to go without a piece then you must wanna be dead
He lays the pistol on the table then draws a
32 automatic from his waist, this time cocking the hammer, the muzzle only inches from Easy's head
Easy can tell from the glazed look in Mouse's eye that instead of seeing him, his friend is glaring at some demon he carries around in his head
So he stands stock still
(quiet, soothing) Let him go, Raymond
He done learned his lesson
If you kill him then he won't have got it
He fool enough to call me out and he ain't even got no gun
'll kill the motherfucker
Let him live, Raymond, and he be scared whenever you walk in the room
Motherfucker better be scared kill a motherfucker
kill him
Easy stares down the barrel of the gun for a long moment until Mouse blinks, then nods and lets the pistol fall down into his lap
His head on his chest, he's sound asleep
Easy takes the gun and puts it on the table with the other
Then walks to the doorway and turns out the light
102
'  -                                        102 The dim street lamps of Easy's neighborhood streak past as Easy scans the streets and sidewalks, wary for anybody who might be staking him out
91
102   :                                                     102 (
) The pictures were burnin' a hole in my pocket
had no doubt that Albright had killed McGee
and that he had done it for Matthew Teran
But Teran hadn't known who killed Coretta
was sure of that, too
103
'  -                                       103 Easy's car pulls up and he gets out and looks around cautiously before starting up the walkway
(
) (continuing) For the first time  hated walking up to my house
still didn't know if  could go to the police
But Albright was liable to be showing up in a few hours asking about Frank Green
was thinking oughta forget the girl and leave town, back to Houston or Galveston where they didn't know me too good
Easy gets to the door, still literally looking over his shoulder, and hears the phone  inside
He unlocks the door and bursts in
104
'                                               104 He races through the dark living room and into 105
105 And picks up the phone but the dial tone  on the other end
Shit
Damn
He whacks the nightstand with the receiver, dying with frustration
And   in the dark
He lunges and grabs and pulls her into the light, then sits down onto the bed before the shock can knock him down
Are you all right
93
105   :                                                      105 Easy shakes his head in disbelieving relief and she reaches to touch the bump on his forehead
What happened
Your boyfriend, Frank Green, threw a surprise party for me
'm sorry, Easy
He pulls away
(continuing) Easy, Coretta's boyfriend, Dupree, got out of jail today
And
(continuing)                    (he joins her) need you to help me           You need me to help you find him
find him
Easy shakes his head, amused, and lights a cigarette
-- already have the pictures
Daphne stiffens, as if from an electrical shock, and then: Easy,  paid seven thousand dollars for those pictures
They belong to me
Oh yeah
Matthew Teran may have somethin' to say about that
Easy, you wouldn't dare
Try me
Who killed Coretta
don't know -- 'll pay you for them
'll give you a thousand dollars
You gave Richard seven
94
105   :   (2)                                        105 Okay, 'll give you seven
Where'd you get seven thousand dollars from
Never mind
'll give it to you
Easy, please
They're very important to me
Coretta's life was important to a few people too
What's say you tell me who killed her
Easy, honey,  don't know
'Honey
' Do Frank and Carter really fall for that stuff
Come on
You and Todd Carter have a fight and all of a sudden he doesn't wanna be mayor no more
You leave, he's worried but he can't even get his buddies in the police department to help him find you
And now you wanna buy some pictures of Teran
Why
'Cause he's got some dirt on you
She gets up and walks away
Easy, why don't you just take the money
Is that what Frank told Coretta
She whirls around to face him
(continuing) Was she being too nosy
Or was she just being Coretta and trying to bargain up the price
Easy, please
How much do you want
95
105   :   (3)                                              105 Tell me
Is Frank your husband or your pimp
She swings and open hand across his face, and
He returns the gesture, sending her back onto the bed
He picks up the phone and dials "
" Easy, put the phone down
Why don't you try screaming again
'Cause  bet police like white women with Negro boyfriends who hijack trucks
Easy, please
She reaches for the phone and he pushes her away
bet they like pimps, and whores, too, who scam rich white men like Carter runnin' for mayor
Easy, please, put it down
And 'm sure they like it when these white girls tell their colored men to lay low 'cause they killed a woman over some pictures of another rich white man
She gathers herself, just as: ' Number please
(soberly) Frank is my brother
Easy is about to speak, but then stands still
' Number please
He hangs up
96
105   :   (4)                                              105 She looks away, worn out, tired
We have different fathers
Mine is white
Frank doesn't even know that Todd and  broke up
So far 've kept him out of all this
She gets up and takes Easy's cigarettes and taps one out
See, Coretta's the only one out here in
besides my brother who knew about me
(she lights up) And about a month ago she took a job working for, of all people, Matthew Teran
She made friends with one of the girls in the office who told her that she'd heard that Teran was a pedophile
And Coretta got carried away and told her that Todd Carter was engaged to a colored woman
She was sorry and didn't think it would get to Teran
but it did and he got a hold of my birth records
Who killed her, Daphne
Daphne exhales smoke and brushes hair out of her face ignoring the question
(continuing) Todd and  broke up and  paid a guy for the pictures of Teran
But somehow Coretta got them
Who killed her
It was an accident
Coretta and were still mad at each other mean, she threatened to sell Teran the pictures
Who killed her goddammit
97
105   :   (5)                                               105 just asked Joppy to go over and put a scare in her
It was an accident
: 106
- '                                  106 Joppy points a finger in Coretta's face, backing her against the counter
She grabs a knife from a rack of dishes left out to dry
(
) Joppy said she pulled a knife and tried to dump hot water on him
She swipes at Joppy and he backhands her against the stove
She struggles to grab a pot of boiling water, but he wrests it from her and slings her across the room against the counter, her head striking the tile on the way down
107                                                       107 Daphne looks down at her hands
She stubs out her cigarette and sits on the bed
God,  didn't mean to hurt anybody
It's just that with the pictures  can-- What
Marry Carter
Be white again
Don't judge me, Easy
Do you think like pretending that 'm someone else
Do you know how 've been treated by people, colored and white, when 've tried to live as a colored woman in a colored community
Do you have any idea what any colored man whose ever been with me has had to go through
Don't you dare judge me
She sees Easy hesitate and she stands up
(continuing) Come on, Easy
Help me
98
107   :                                                     107 She moves in close, caressing
(continuing) Come on, you know it's the right thing to do
You know if things were different what would happen between us
'll tell you what can happen between us
You get Carter to clear me up from all this and you can have your pictures
That's all that could have ever happened between us
(genuinely hurt) Sure, baby
Of course, sweetheart
The sound of the front door pushing open startles them, and Albright knocks on his way in
Well 'll be damned
You found her
And Manny and Shariff step in, too, carrying baseball bats
Wait a minute, Albright
Daphne breaks for the back way and Easy tries to bar Shariff from going after her
Hey
Manny swings the baseball bat into Easy's side
and Easy yells and plows into him, wrestling him against the wall
Albright grabs Easy from behind and pries him free enough for Manny to uppercut him to the chin with the fat end of the bat
Easy sinks to his knees seeing double
Shariff leads Daphne back into the room, her face contorted into tears, her arm twisted up behind her in a hammerlock
99
107   :   (2)                                               107 (to Daphne) Where are the pictures
(terrified) don't know
He backhands her
Easy grabs for the wall to get to his feet and Manny swings the bat down into his kidney
Where are they
(indicating Easy) wouldn't tell him
And  won't tell you
Sure you will
(to Shariff) Let's go
Shariff leads Daphne outside and Manny draws his forty-five automatic and trains it on Easy, cocking the hammer
What're you doin'
Who are we gonna give 'em to cover this shit, hunh
Use your head
He shoves Manny through the door and pushes Easy onto his side with his foot and he's out the door
Easy strains to get back to his knees as car doors slam and the sound of a car engine growls to life
He thrusts himself up from the floor and stumbles toward the front door like a boxer who should have stayed down for the count
He gets it open in time to see
108
'  -                                       108 The blurred white form of Albright's Caddy screaming away, shattering the dark, shrieking in flight
Dogs are barking and a baby is screaming somewhere in the neighborhood while lights are going on up and down the block
Easy stumbles back inside and into 100
109                                                           109 Where he manages to dial the phone
It  several times on the other end, and finally: ' (groggy) Yeah
Mouse
' Hey, Easy
(slurring) Get Dupree's car
Drive it to 78th and Central
The butcher shop
' You alright
Hurry up
He puts down the receiver, missing the cradle, and staggers out of the room
110
'  -                                            110 Easy is ripping through the night, the streetlights flashing by in blurs of light
The windows down, he's coming to
(
) It had come to me in less time than it takes to think that Albright was taking Daphne someplace more isolated than that office building downtown
Someplace where there would be no witnesses
And  was being left alive to take the fall
111
/'  -                              111 The street is still alive
couple of late night juke joints are coughing up the last drunken bits of the party onto the sidewalk to straggle home
Easy's car screams around the corner, and then skids in, sending a heavy-hipped young sister, about to cross the street, scrambling for cover
He jumps out just as Mouse scorches the tires on Dupree's '38 Packard in behind him
101
111   :                                                     111 (to the woman) Sorry, baby
Lemme give you twenty bucks for them stockings you got on
It takes a moment to register, but when she sees him pull a twenty from his pocket, she gets busy
He runs back to Mouse
Gimme one of them guns you got
Mouse smiles, loving this side of Easy, and trades him a set of car keys for a
32 automatic
(continuing) Start up my car
'm comin' out fast
He runs back to the woman he almost hit and hands off the twenty, grabbing one of the nylons, leaving her still stripping as he runs into 112
112 He takes the steps two at a time, pulling the stocking down over his face as he reaches the top and bursts through the open door leading into 113
'                                                113 He charges through the raucous laughter of the half-full room right up to the bar
Joppy nearly drops the glasses he is clearing away as he looks down the barrel of the pistol aimed at his face
Come on, Joppy
Let's go
Joppy hesitates, recognizing the voice
You heard me
'll blow your head off
And he cocks the hammer, causing Joppy to get a move on from behind the bar
Easy shoves him through the door, calling back to the startled crowd on his way out
102
113    :                                                     113 Don't follow me, goddammit
And he's gone
114
'  -                                        114 Easy hides the piece in his coat pocket as he bum rushes Joppy to the car
Easy, what the hell you-- Shut up
And he shoves Joppy into the back seat, getting in next to him
Drive this damn thing, Mouse
Mouse pulls off, around the corner, down the street into an alley
A115
'  -                                   A115 Mouse pulls to a stop
(to Joppy) Albright's got the girl
He's gonna kill her
Where would he take her
And you better get it right
Man,  don't-- (screaming, pressing the gun) Don't fool with me, man
There's a cabin out in Malibu on Route 9
Make a right, Mouse
103
B115
-                                              B115 The car roars down the alley and turns right onto the street
115
-   -                            115 (to Joppy) You sure 'bout this place
guess so
He's done this kinda thing out there before
Easy, what's done got into you
Thought y'all was friends
He killed Dupree's girlfriend
You lyin'
Naw
Son-of-a-bitch
And he pulls out his pistol, aiming it back over the seat at Joppy as he drives
The bullet slams through the rear window just to the side of Joppy's head
Mouse
What're you doin'
This one digs out a chunk of upholstery between Joppy and Easy
Hey
Watch out
The car screeches to a halt and Mouse tries to aim again
But Easy struggles with Mouse's gun hand still holding a pistol on Joppy
Mouse, we need him to lead the way
This one rips through the roof
Joppy's yelling, afraid that Easy's gun will go off
104
115   :                                                    115 Mouse, the girl offered me seven thousand dollars for the pictures
Mouse glares into the rearview mirror
You lyin'
No,  swear 'm not
Aw shit
And he fumbles with the ignition and shifts gears
Oh, my God
Oh, my goodness
116
-                                       116 The engine roars from a punch to the accelerator, and Mouse's voice can be heard cutting through the darkness as the car powers off down the street
(
) Oh, my goodness
117
'  -                                        117 Easy, with the gun on Joppy, strains to see the dimly lit road in front of them
Is that it up there
Yeah, that's it
118                                             118 The headlights bounce off a signpost: "Route 9
" 119
9 -                                           119 The Pontiac makes the turn onto a graded dirt road
120
'  -                                        120 ranch-style cabin emerges up off the road, drawing nearer in the headlight beams
105
121                                                          121 Shut off the headlights, Mouse
Mouse kills the lights
Is that it
Naw
It's farther up
How much farther
Another ten minutes,  guess
Easy,  swear,  ain't done nothin' to nobody
swear,  ain't
122
9 -                                               122 :    House lights show through thick shrubbery
There it is
Mouse pulls to a stop and kills the engine
There's some rope in the trunk, Raymond
Mouse gets out of the car and is heard opening the trunk
Easy, come on, man
That girl is lying if she told you  killed them folks
Who said she told me
It's muted and distant
But it's a woman all right
Easy pushes out of the back door on the right as Mouse opens the opposite door on the driver's side
Stuff this in his mouth
gotta get up there
He tosses Mouse the stocking
106
122   :                                                      122 Let's just shoot him
(on the run) No, Mouse
And they'll hear it
123
'  -                                    123 The cabin draws nearer as Easy scrambles up the hill
He can hear Daphne crying out something, but he can't make out the words
It quiets down as he nears and sees shadows crossing a window with the shade pulled down
He moves cautiously, quietly to the window and peers through the crack between the shade and the windowsill
He can make out a sliver of what looks like a large room with a low ceiling
And Daphne screams again
' Come on, talk to me
Talk to me while you still can
' (sobbing) Please
don't have them
Easy has them
Easy can barely make out Shariff passing the window
He strains to see more
' You said he didn't know anything
' was lying
' Okay
Grab that for me, Shariff
It's ready
And then --
The kind that drops the bottom out of your stomach
The kind more akin to fear than the word itself
The kind that fries your skin with the cold chill of horror
---- again
' No-o-o-o
Please
No-o-o
' Now talk to me, goddammit
107
123   :                                                         123 ' No-o-o
124   Easy's gotta make a move
He smashes the           124 window with the gun and the shade rattles all the way up
Manny looks right up at his face as Daphne arches and flails, trying to get free from his hands that are pinning her down on a battered old sofa
Albright is holding a glowing red poker that Shariff, standing in front of the fireplace, has just handed him
Easy starts blasting
Manny takes one to the throat
Albright and Shariff lunge for cover, and Daphne ducks down behind the back of the sofa, screaming and screaming
Manny, hand to his throat, pulls his gun on reflex, firing into the floor and then half runs, half staggers out the side door just ahead of another
that digs out a chunk of the wall
Easy hears the screen door open and then ducks down, getting ready for Manny who should be coming his way from the side door
He  more steps stumble out and then
And then,
Two huge blasts rip right through the wall next to Easy's head, and he scrambles to the side of the house, underneath another window with the shade pulled down
(
) (to Shariff) Who the hell's out there
(getting frantic) don't know
(
) That you, Easy
() Tell us what you want, buddy
See what we can work out
Easy  footsteps coming alongside the house where he had been moments ago
Albright has fired from the inside again, thinking it's him
(whispering) Mouse
108
124   :                                                       124 But it's Manny, clutching his throat, gurgling for air, stumbling aimlessly off down the hill
walking dead man
hears him tumble into some shrubbery and after a moment the gurgling stops
(
) Easy
Hey, Buddy (then to Shariff) Come on, goddammit
Daphne cries out and
Easy breaks the window with the gun but
The windowsill tears out above his head and Daphne screams again
Easy looks up to see Shariff, holding her in front of him as a shield
He's headed straight for Easy, drawing a bead on him for the kill
And then
the back of Shariff's skull flies off and is in the side door, blasting
Albright breaks for the window
The slug spins him halfway around but he hurls himself through the window backwards
Easy scurries to the front of the house and
The bullet goes wide and Albright manages to get into his car and returns fire
Easy hits the deck
Albright's engine roars to life and he  out on the gravel
Mouse appears on the other side of the house and he's out of ammo
He pulls out the other pistol, but it's too late
Damn, damn, damn
hit him hit him
Easy gets up from the ground and trudges into the front door
125
'                                             125 Easy finds Daphne standing in the middle of the room, her whole body quaking in shock
He takes off his jacket and drapes it around her
Come on
You all right
Her top lip is swollen and bloody and she has a dark bruise on her cheek
She jerks her head, nodding "yes
" 109
125   :                                                     125 As he leads her through the doorway, he stops to look back at Shariff's legs sprawling out on the floor from behind the sofa
126
'  -                                   126 He leads her down the front porch and hears
There's blood all over here got him
Mouse gets up from squatting down, grinning, the gold rims of his teeth catching a glint from the light coming through the door
He looks Daphne over, admiring
Damn
Sweetheart
Easy leads her past, quickly
She okay
Yeah
Let's go
127
9 -                                            127 Mouse opens the back seat door of the car and Easy sees that there's no one there
Where's Joppy
And then he looks around quickly, seeing '  lying off on the side of the road
What happened
Mouse shrugs
didn't have time to be tying him up
Daphne sees the body too and starts gagging
Easy's face twists into helpless pain and he holds a handkerchief to Daphne's mouth
Why, man
Why
110
127    :                                                        127 Why what
You just said don't shoot him
And  didn't choked his ass
Easy helps Daphne into the car and closes the door
Damn Mouse
Why
How 'm gonna help you back there foolin' 'round with him
He was tied up
Why
Aw, man
If you didn't want him kilt you shouldn't have left him with me
And he goes around to the passenger side of the car to get in
Unlike up at the house this was murder -- the same as it had been in Texas with Mouse's stepfather and brother
Tears of rage well up in Easy's eyes as he hears the car door close
: A128
-                               A128 Daphne sits in the car, her eyes staring straight ahead, still in shock
128
-                                              128 few people hurry to board the train, Easy and Mouse among them
(
) convinced Mouse to take the two o'clock train to Pomona and to let me handle everything else
He could get a train back to Houston later that morning
He was fine with that but only because he was seven thousand dollars richer
Daphne had gotten the money out of a locker at the  without a word
() 111
128   :                                                       128 (
) (') Because she was still in shock and couldn't really talk
Maybe too because she had stolen about four times that much from Carter
Listen, if you think you gonna have trouble with that dude Frank,  can run by and kill him and take that evening train to Houston
Naw, man
He has had enough of Mouse for a while
Oh
This is for you
And he pulls out something wrapped up in a brown paper bag from his coat
cut you in for half 'cause  knew you was too big a fool to take your share from that white girl yourself
Easy stares numbly at the package and then takes it
The conductor gets on board and the train starts making those metal on metal sounds
Send my grip to Etta Mae
'm gonna see if she'll take me back now that 'm flush
He slaps Easy on the shoulder and boards the train
Oh, here's the keys to Dupree's car
He tosses them, and the train starts moving
And if you need somebody to run them streets with ya, gimme a call
You know how to put some money in a nigga's pocket
And he laughs, flashing gold teeth pulling away
112
128   :   (2)                                               128 Easy watches
(
) knew  would see him again and didn't know how  felt about that
'cause, unlike Mouse, my legs were like rubber
the way they had been in the war the whole two years  was there
129
-                          129 Easy sits in his car smoking a cigarette, rubbing his aching chin, looking out at standing on the lawn in front of the planetarium
Carter wanders after Daphne, explaining while she paces back and forth in anger
could tell how it was gonna go when Carter asked us to meet him at the Observatory instead of at his house
She knew it, too
But she had come this far and she had to play it out
Suddenly, Daphne stops abruptly and strides hurriedly back toward the car
Carter follows behind
Daphne
Daphne, sweetheart
He starts over, too, but then stops, knowing here's no use
130
-                                                130 She gets in
Come on, Easy
Let's go
Easy throws a look over at Carter
(continuing) Don't worry, you can give him the pictures yourself
And she throws them down on the seat
113
131                                                              131 132   Easy fires up the engine and pulls away with Daphne            132 looking straight ahead
Hey, 'm sorry
The slight twist of her head amounts to a shrug and then the tears flow
The sun is coming up over the city below
(
) For the first time  felt that could fall in love with her, too
was even wondering if it was starting to happen when  dropped her off at 63rd and Dinker where her brother, Frank, was waiting
Then it occurred to me that she still had Carter's money
and felt like a fool
133
133 Easy walks onto the rotunda holding a hand to his aching kidney
secretary comes out to meet him and as she leaves, Todd Carter and a group of men in business suits converge on him, shaking hands
(
) Evidently Carter had told all his cronies about the pictures because they were all smiles and handshakes and "how do ya do"
The Mayor, the police chief
The newspaper; land developers
All the men who ran the City, and who really stood to gain by who was the Mayor for the next six years
The group fans out leaving Carter and Easy alone to walk off down a hallway
134                                                              134 135                                                              135 136
'                                             136 Spacious and heavy in leather and wood with a not-so- spectacular view of the mountains
It's cold and official like the job itself
Carter pulls a brown envelope from inside his coat pocket, not unlike Albright
114
136   :                                                    136 Here's the remaining eight hundred that  owe you
in cash
And another thousand which  hope will keep this whole thing
you know
Easy nods a tentative "sure
" (continuing) And 've taken care of your problems with the police
You'll have no more trouble there
And that's a promise
Easy nods and starts to go, but
(continuing; to Easy) Mr
Rawlins
did Daphne ever say
she loved me
Easy shrugs, not knowing how to answer
Would it really matter if she did, Mr
Carter
Carter nods sadly and Easy walks away leaving him a lonely figure amidst all his power
137
-                                           137 Easy holds his kidney and lowers himself gingerly down the granite steps
(
) 'd been thinking about Daphne, too
wondering if she meant what she said about what could have happened between us
But at the moment  was wondering if there was any such thing as a sprained chin
But other than that and a headache, a loose tooth and a kidney that a doctor would need to look at, felt like five thousand, three hundred dollars
And unless Albright was alive somewhere, that feelin' was gonna last a while
Hey, Ezekiel
115
137   :                                                    137 Miller and Mason are waiting outside their car at the curb
They come over
You got some mighty powerful friends up there
mighty powerful
But, see, we got a problem
Easy listens disinterestedly
(continuing) With the Chief sealing these things up like this, it doesn't do much for the morale of the men who've been working on these cases
Yeah
Makes 'em feel like shit
There's a guy who's been callin' on the phone
And we're pretty sure that he was up there with McGee
uh
colored guy
sounds kinda dumb
(correcting) Not very bright
But he said you accused him of the murder
And he swears you were up there, too
In fact, he's out and out pointing the finger at ya
How about a name
He'd do it to you
Easy waits to make sure they're finished, and
Sorry, fellas
But  gotta go
He starts away
116
137   :   (2)                                              137 (continuing) Why don't you go back to the station and, uh
wait around for my call
You son-of-a-bitch
You watch yourself, you hear
Don't you even spit on the fucking sidewalk better not even-- Mason's voice fades under
(
) It might be the last moment of my adult life spent free was walking away from City Hall
138
'  -                                        138 reads: "Carter Back In Race
" The subheading reads: "Quiet Civic Leader Returns As Flamboyant Teran Quits
" (
) The paper treated the mysterious flip-flop like it happened every day
And  could tell that Matthew Teran wouldn't spend a day in jail
Back in the second section of the paper was a small article about an unidentified man found dead, slumped over the steering wheel of a white Cadillac just north of Malibu
, we see that Odell is reading the newspaper, nursing a can of ale
(
) It scared me to think about a world that could kill a man like DeWitt Albright
What could a world like that do to me
Hey, Easy, where's your car
Easy looks up from pulling weeds
117
138   :                                                138 In the shop
'm havin' it fixed up a little
Yeah
Man can't get no decent job in this town without a car
Shoot
ain't studyin' no job
Ain't thinkin' 'bout no job
How you gonna live
'm gonna go to work for myself
Take a little money  got saved up and go into real estate
Start fixin' up folks' gardens again
and do a few favors on the side
Favors for friends
What you talkin' 'bout, 'favors'
Well, like a woman offered me thirty dollars to go track down her husband for her
You talkin' about private investigatin' or somethin'
You could get in trouble doin' that
Easy keeps working
Like a man once said to me, Odell: 'Walk out your door in the morning and you're already in trouble'
It's just how you're mixed up in that trouble that counts
Easy gets up and turns on the water hose
(continuing) Odell
Yeah, Easy
118
138   :   (2)                                               138 If you got a friend that does bad and you still keep him as your friend, even though you know what he's like
Do you think that's right
All you got is your friends, Easy
Easy starts to nod, but then spots hovering over a rosebush in a neighbor's yard across the street, his shears ready to cut
(calling out) Get out of that yard
(to Odell) Bastard cut down two of my trees
Easy picks up a rock and sails it
Odell comes off the porch and does the same
Then a neighbor from across the street joins in
ambles off toward another block, leaving Easy, Odell and the neighbor gathered in the middle of the street
139                                                        139 a man with a pony is setting up a camera
few children have gathered, and more are running over from other parts of the neighborhood
The man props up a hand-painted sign, "Cowboy Pictures -- 15 Cents," and lifts the first customer onto the pony positioning a cowboy hat on the child's head
140                                                       140 Another neighbor joins Easy and company, and they continue to laugh and talk, looking up from time to time to wave at friends in passing cars
(
) thought about what Odell had said about friends and it made sense to me
() 119
140   :                                                    140 (
) (') Odell goes to church every Sunday, so he would know
Later on, he challenged me to a game of dominoes
And what'd he do that for
We got to talkin' 'bout Texas and fooled around and drunk almost a quart of whiskey
And  forgot about Daphne Monet, DeWitt Albright and Carter and them
And sat with my friend, on my porch at my house
and we laughed a long time
