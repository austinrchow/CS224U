We hear male voices gently singing "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" and a deep, affable, Western-accented voice--Sam Elliot's, perhaps: - way out west there was a fella, fella  want to tell you about, fella by the name of Jeff Lebowski
At least, that was the handle his lovin' parents gave him, but he never had much use for it himself
This Lebowski, he called himself the Dude
Now, Dude, that's a name no one would self-apply where  come from
But then, there was a lot about the Dude that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me
And a lot about where he lived, like- wise
But then again, maybe that's why  found the place s'durned innarestin'
We top the rise and the smoggy vastness of Los Angeles at twilight stretches out before us
- They call Los Angeles the City of Angels
didn't find it to be that exactly, but 'll allow as there are some nice folks there
'Course, can't say  seen London, and  never been to France, and  ain't never seen no queen in her damn undies as the fella says
But 'll tell you what, after seeing Los Angeles and thisahere story 'm about to unfold-- wal,  guess  seen somethin' ever' bit as stupefyin' as ya'd see in any a those other places, and in English too, so  can die with a smile on my face without feelin' like the good Lord gypped me
' It is late, the supermarket all but deserted
We are tracking in on a fortyish man in Bermuda shorts and sunglasses at the dairy case
He is the Dude
His rumpled look and relaxed manner suggest a man in whom casualness runs deep
He is feeling quarts of milk for coldness and examining their expiration dates
- Now this story 'm about to unfold took place back in the early nineties-- just about the time of our conflict with Sad'm and the Eye-rackies only mention it 'cause some- times there's a man-- won't say a hee-ro, 'cause what's a hee-ro
--but sometimes there's a man
The Dude glances furtively about and then opens a quart of milk
He sticks his nose in the spout and sniffs
- And 'm talkin' about the Dude here-- sometimes there's a man who, wal, he's the man for his time'n place, he fits right in there--and that's the Dude, in Los Angeles
She waits, arms folded
small black-and white  next to her register shows George Bush on the White House lawn with helicopter rotors spinning behind him
This aggression will not stand
This will not stand
The Dude, peeking over his shades, scribbles something at the little customer's lectern
Milk beads his mustache
- and even if he's a lazy man, and the Dude was certainly that--quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles County
The Dude has his Ralph's Shopper's Club card to one side and is making out a check to Ralph's for sixty-nine cents
- which would place him high in the runnin' for laziest worldwide--but sometimes there's a man
sometimes there's a man
' Long shot of the glowing Ralph's
There are only two or three cars parked in the huge lot
- Wal,  lost m'train of thought here
But--aw hell,  done innerduced him enough
The Dude is a small figure walking across the vast lot
Next to him walks a Mexican carry-out boy in a red apron and cap carrying a small brown bag holding the quart of milk
The two men's footsteps echo in the still of the night
After a beat of walking the Dude offhandedly points
It's the LeBaron
' The Dude is going up the walkway of a small Venice bungalow court
He holds the paper sack in one hand and a small leatherette satchel in the other
He awkwardly hugs the grocery bag against his chest as he turns a key in his door
The Dude enters and flicks on a light
His head is grabbed from behind and tucked into an armpit
We track with him as he is rushed through the living room, his arm holding the satchel flailing away from his body
Going into the bedroom the outflung satchel catches a piece of doorframe and wallboard and rips through it, leaving a hole
The Dude is propelled across the bedroom and on into a small bathroom, the satchel once again taking away a piece of doorframe
His head is plunged into the toilet
The paper bag hugged to his chest explodes milk as it hits the toilet rim and the satchel pulverizes tile as it crashes to the floor
The Dude blows bubbles
We want that money, Lebowski
Bunny said you were good for it
Hands haul the Dude out of the toilet
The Dude blubbers and gasps for air
Where's the money, Lebowski
His head is plunged back into the toilet
Where's the money, Lebowski
The hands haul him out again, dripping and gasping
'   ,
It's uh, it's down there somewhere
Lemme take another look
His head is plunged back in
Don't fuck with us
If your wife owes money to Jackie Treehorn, that means you owe money to Jackie Treehorn
The inquisitor hauls the Dude's head out one last time and flops him over so that he sits on the floor, back against the toilet
The Dude gropes back in the toilet with one hand
Looming over him is a strapping blond man
Beyond in the living room a young Chinese man unzips his fly and walks over to a rug
Ever thus to deadbeats, Lebowski
He starts peeing on the rug
The Dude's hand comes out of the toilet bowl with his sunglasses
Oh, man
Don't do-- You see what happens
You see what happens, Lebowski
The Dude puts on his dripping sunglasses
Look, nobody calls me Lebowski
You got the wrong guy
'm the Dude, man
Your name is Lebowski
Your wife is Bunny
Bunny
Look, moron
He holds up his hands
You see a wedding ring
Does this place look like 'm fucking married
All my plants are dead
The blond man stoops to unzip the satchel
He pulls out a bowling ball and examines it in the manner of a superstitious native
The fuck is this
The Dude pats at his pockets, takes out a joint and lights it
Obviously you're not a golfer
The blond man drops the ball which pulverizes more tile
Woo
The Chinese man is zipping his fly
Yeah
Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire
Uh
They both look around
Fuck
What do you think
He looks like a fuckin' loser
The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose with one finger and peeks over them
Hey
At least 'm housebroken
The two men look at each other
They turn to leave
Fuckin' waste of time
The blond man turns testily at the door
Thanks a lot, asshole
: Scattered by a strike
Music and head credits play over various bowling shots--pins flying, bowlers hoisting balls, balls gliding down lanes, sliding feet, graceful releases, ball return spinning up a ball, fingers sliding into fingerholes, etc
The music turns into boomy source music, coming from a distant jukebox, as the credits end over a clattering strike
lanky blonde man with stringy hair tied back in a ponytail turns from the strike to walk back to the bench
Hot damn, 'm throwin' rocks tonight
Mark it, Dude
We are tracking in on the circular bench towards a big man nursing a large plastic cup of Bud
He has dark worried eyes and a goatee
Hairy legs emerge from his khaki shorts
He also wears a khaki army surplus shirt with the sleeves cut off over an old bowling shirt
This is Walter
He squints through the smoke from his own cigarette as he addresses the Dude at the scoring table
The Dude, also holding a large plastic cup of Bud, wears some of its foam on his mustache
This was a valued rug
He elaborately clears his throat
This was, uh-- Yeah man, it really tied the room together-- This was a valued, uh
Donny, the strike-scoring bowler, enters and sits next Walter
What tied the room together, Dude
Were you listening to the story, Donny
What-- Were you listening to the Dude's story
was bowling-- So you have no frame of reference, Donny
You're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know-- What's your point, Walter
There's no fucking reason--here's my point, Dude--there's no fucking reason-- Yeah Walter, what's your point
Huh
What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about
Huh
No
What the fuck are you talking--'m not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here-- What the fuck is he talking about
My rug
Forget it, Donny
You're out of your element
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about
What the fuck are you talking about
This Chinaman is not the issue
'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude
Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh
Asian- American
Please
Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my-- What the fuck are you-- Walter, he peed on my rug-- He peed on the Dude's rug-- '
This Chinaman is not the issue, Dude
So who-- Jeff Lebowski
Come on
This other Jeffrey Lebowski
The millionaire
He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh
these two
And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no  reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug
Am  wrong
No, but-- Am  wrong
Yeah, but-- Okay
That, uh
He elaborately clears his throat
That rap really tied the room together, did it not
Fuckin'
And this guy peed on it
Donny
Please
Yeah,  could find this Lebowski guy-- His name is Lebowski
That's your name, Dude
Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug
mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug
Thaaat's right Dude; they pee on your fucking Rug
We pull back from the name   engraved in silver to reveal that the plaque, from Variety Clubs International, honors Lebowski as
Reflected in the plaque we see the Dude entering the room with a
We hear the two men talk: And this is the study
You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera
Yes, uh, very impressive
Please, feel free to inspect them
'm not really, uh
Please
Please
Uh-huh
We are panning the walls, looking at various citations and certificates unrelated to the ones being discussed offscreen: That's the key to the city of Pasadena, which Mr
Lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh
Uh-huh
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year
Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially-- Hey, is this him with Nancy
That is indeed Mr
Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when-- Lebowski on the right
Of course, Mr
Lebowski on the right, Mrs
Reagan on the left, taken when-- He's handicapped, huh
Mr
Lebowski is disabled, yes
And this picture was taken when Mrs
Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes
Not of California
Far out
And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity
Nancy's pretty good
Wonderful woman
We were very-- Are these
These are Mr
Lebowski's children, so to speak-- Different mothers, huh
No, they-- guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool-- They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the-- see
--without  the means  for higher education, so Mr
Lebowski  has committed  to sending  all of them to college
Jeez
Think he's got room for one more
One--oh
Heh-heh
You never went to college
Well, yeah  did, but  spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings-- Heh-heh-- --smoking thai-stick, breaking into the -- Yes, heh-- --and bowling
'll tell you the truth, Brandt,  don't remember most of it
--Jeez
Fuck me
Our continuing track and pan have brought us onto a framed Life Magazine cover which is headlined Oddly, the Dude's sunglassed face is on it; we realize that, under the magazine's logo and headline, the display is mirrored
We hear the door open and the whine of a motor
The Dude, wearing shorts and a bowling shirt, turns to look
So does Brandt, the young man we've been listening to
He wears a suit and has his hands clasped in front of his groin
Entering the room is a fat sixtyish man in a motorized wheelchair--Jeff Lebowski
Okay sir, you're a Lebowski, 'm a Lebowski, that's terrific, 'm very busy so what can  do for you
He wheels himself behind a desk
The Dude sits facing him as Brandt withdraws
Well sir, it's this rug  have, really tied the room together- You told Brandt on the phone, he told me
So where do  fit in
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to-- 'll say it again, all right
You told Brandt
He told me
know what happened
Yes
Yes
So you know they were trying to piss on your rug-- Did  urinate on your rug
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my-- Hello
Do you speak English
Parla usted Inglese
'll say it again
Did  urinate on your rug
Well no, like  said, Woo peed on the rug-- Hello
Hello
So every time-- just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city,  have to compensate the-- Come on, man, 'm not trying to scam anybody here, 'm just-- You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr
Lebowski
Look, let me explain something
'm not Mr
Lebowski;  you're Mr
Lebowski
'm the Dude
So that's what  you  call me
That, or Duder
His  Dudeness
Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing-- Are you employed, sir
Employed
You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday
Is this a--what day is this
But  do work, so if you don't mind-- No, look
do mind
The Dude minds
This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man
mean, if your wife owes-- My wife is not the issue here hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame
didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but  went out and achieved anyway
can't solve your problems, sir, only you can
The Dude rises
Ah fuck it
Sure
Fuck it
That's your answer
Tattoo it on your forehead
Your answer to everything
The Dude is heading for the door
Your "revolution" is over, Mr
Lebowski
Condolences
The bums lost
As the Dude opens the door
My advice is, do what your parents did
Get a job, sir
The bums will always lose-- do you hear me, Lebowski
-- The Dude shuts the door on the old man's bellowing to find himself-- --in a high coffered hallway
Brandt is approaching
How was your meeting, Mr
Lebowski
Okay
The old man told me to take any rug in the house
houseman with a rolled-up carpet on one shoulder goes down a stone walk that winds through the back lawn, past a swimming pool to a garage
Brandt and the Dude follow
Manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, Dude
It's the LeBaron
' Tracking toward the pool
young woman sits facing it, her back to us, leaning forward to paint her toenails
Beyond her a black form floats in an inflatable chair in the pool
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude
Yeah sure, if 'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john
Arcing around the woman's foot as she finishes painting the nails emerald green
Looking
The young woman looks up at him
She is in her early twenties
She leans back and extends her leg toward the Dude
Blow on them
The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose and peeks over them
Huh
She waggles her foot and giggles
'ahead
Blow
The Dude tentatively grabs hold of her extended foot
You want me to blow on your toes
Uh-huh
can't blow that far
The Dude looks over at the pool
You sure he won't mind
The man bobbing in the inflatable chair is passed out
He is thin, in his thirties, with long stringy blond hair
He wears black leather pants and a black leather jacket, open, shirtless, exposing fine blond chest hair and pale skin
One arm trails off into the water; next to it, an empty whiskey bottle bobs
Dieter doesn't care about anything
He's a nihilist
Practicing
The young woman smiles
You're not blowing
Brandt nervously takes the Dude by the elbow
Our guest has to be getting along, Mrs
Lebowski
The Dude grudgingly allows himself to be led away, still looking at the young woman
You're Bunny
'll suck your cock for a thousand dollars
Brandt releases a gale of forced laughter: Ha-ha-ha-ha
Wonderful woman
Very free-spirited
We're all very fond of her
Brandt can't watch though
Or he has to pay a hundred
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
That's marvelous
He continues to lead away the Dude, who looks back over his : 'm just gonna find a cash machine
Scattered by a strike
Donny calls out from the bench: Grasshopper Dude--They're dead in the water
As the Dude walks back to the scoring table he turns to another team in black bowling shirts--the Cavaliers--that shares the lane
Your maples, Carl
Walter, just arriving, is carrying a leatherette satchel in one hand and a large plastic carrier in the other
Way to go, Dude
If you will it, it is no dream
You're fucking twenty minutes late
What the fuck is that
Theodore Herzel
Huh
State of Israel
If you will it, Dude, it is no-- What the fuck're you talking about
The carrier
What's in the fucking carrier
Huh
Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian
Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture
What the fuck are you-- 'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian
'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii
You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling
What do you mean "brought it bowling"
didn't rent it shoes
'm not buying it a fucking beer
He's not gonna take your fucking turn, Dude
He lets the small yapping dog out of the carrier
It scoots around the bowling table, sniffing at bowlers and wagging its tail
Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu, 'd tell her to go fuck herself
Why can't she board it
First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers
You can't board it
It gets upset, its hair falls out
Hey man-- Fucking dog has papers, Dude
--Over the line
Smokey turns from his last roll to look at Walter
Smokey Huh
Over the line, Smokey
'm sorry
That's a foul
Bullshit
Eight, Dude
Excuse me
Mark it zero
Next frame
Bullshit
Walter
This is not Nam
This is bowling
There are rules
Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey
So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game
This is a league game
This determines who enters the next round- robin, am  wrong
Yeah, but-- Am  wrong
Yeah, but  wasn't over
Gimme the marker, Dude,  'm marking it an eight
Walter takes out a gun
Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain
Hey Walter-- Mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain
'm not-- world of pain
manager in a bowling-shirt style uniform is running for a phone
Look Dude,  don't hold with this
This guy is your partner, you should-- Walter primes the gun and points it at his head
The Pomeranian is excitedly yapping at Walter's elbow, making high body-twisting tail-wagging leaps
Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away
Walter-- '
All right
There it is
It's fucking zero
He points frantically at the score projected above the lane
You happy, you crazy fuck
This is a league game, Smokey
Walter and the Dude walk to the Dude's car
The Pomeranian trots happily behind Walter who totes the empty carrier
Walter, you can't do that
These guys're like me, they're pacificists
Smokey was a conscientious objector
You know Dude,  myself dabbled with pacifism at one point
Not in Nam, of course-- And you know Smokey has emotional problems
You mean--beyond pacifism
He's fragile, man
He's very fragile
As the two men get into the car: Huh
did not know that
Well, it's water under the bridge
And we do enter the next round-robin, am wrong
No, you're not wrong-- Am  wrong
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole
They watch a squad car take a squealing turn into the lot
Okay then
We play Quintana and 'Brien next week
They'll be pushovers
Just, just take it easy, Walter
That's your answer to everything, Dude
And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind
Well, just take 't easy, man
'm perfectly calm, Dude
Yeah
Wavin' a gun around
(smugly) Calmer than you are
-his irritates the Dude further
Just take it easy, man
Walter is still smug
Calmer than you are
' large, brilliant Persian rug lies beneath the Dude's beat- up old furniture
At the table next to the answering machine the Dude is mixing kalhua, rum and milk
Dude, this is Smokey
Look,  don't wanna be a hard-on about this, and know it wasn't your fault, but just thought it was fair to tell you that Gene and  will be submitting this to the League and asking them to set aside the round
Or maybe forfeit it to us-- Shit
--so, like  say, just thought, you know, fair warning
Tell Walter
beep
Mr
Lebowski, this is Brandt at, uh, well--at Mr
Lebowski's office
Please call us as soon as is convenient
Beep
Mr
Lebowski, this is Fred Dynarski with the Southern Cal Bowling League
just got a, an informal report, uh, that a uh, a member of your team, uh, Walter Sobchak, drew a loaded weapon during league play-- We hear the doorbell
It swings open to reveal a short, hairy, muscular but balding middle-aged man in a black -shirt and black cut-off jeans
Hiya Allan
Dude,  finally got the venue wanted
'm Performing my dance quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on Tuesday night, and 'd love it if you came and gave me notes
The Dude takes a swig of his kalhua
Sure Allan, 'll be there
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth
Yeah, yeah  know
Okay
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door
Yeah, okay
The  voice continues on the machine
--serious infraction, and examine your standing
Thank you
Beep
Mr
Lebowski, Brandt again
Please do call us when you get in and 'll send the limo
Let me assure you-- hope you're not avoiding this call because of the rug, which,  assure you, is not a problem
We need your help and, uh--well we would very much like to see you
Thank you
It's Brandt
We are pushing Brandt down the high-ceilinged hallway
Distantly, we hear a dolorous soprano
Brandt talks back over : We've had some terrible news
Mr
Lebowski is in seclusion in the West Wing
Huh
Brandt throws open a pair of heavy double doors
The music washes over us as we enter a great study where Jeffrey Lebowski, a blanket thrown over his knees, stares hauntedly into a fire, listening to Lohengrin
, : Mr
Lebowski
Jeffrey Lebowski waves the Dude in without looking around
It's funny
can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome
've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs
What
What makes a man, Mr
Lebowski
Dude
Huh
don't know, sir
Is it
is it, being prepared to do the right thing
Whatever the price
Isn't that what makes a man
Sure
That and a pair of testicles
Lebowski turns away from the Dude with a haunted stare, lost in thought
You're joking
But perhaps you're right
The Dude thumps at his chest pocket
Mind if  smoke a jay
Bunny
He turns back around and the firelight shows teartracks on his cheeks
'Scuse me
Bunny Lebowski
She is the light of my life
Are you surprised at my tears, sir
Fuckin'
Strong men also cry
Strong men also cry
He clears his throat
received this fax this morning
Brandt hastily pulls a flimsy sheet from his clipboard and hands it to the Dude
As you can see, it is a ransom note
Sent by cowards
Men who are unable to achieve on a level field of play
Men who will not sign their names
Weaklings
Bums
: - Bummer
Lebowski looks soulfully at the Dude
Brandt will fill you in on the details
He wheels his chair around to once again gaze into the fire
Brandt tugs at the Dude's shirt and points him back to the hall
The soprano's singing is once again faint
Brandt's voice is hushed: Mr
Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money
Why me, man
He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh
Well Dude, we just don't know
--scattered by a strike, in slow motion
Still in slow motion
We are looking across the length of the bowling alley at a tall, thin, Hispanic bowler displaying perfect form
He wears an all-in-one dacron-polyester stretch bowling outfit with a racing stripe down each side
On the Dude, sitting next to Walter in the molded plastic chairs
The Dude is staring off towards the bowler
Fucking Quintana--that creep can roll, man-- Displaying great slow-motion form as the Dude and Walter's conversation continues over
Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude
Huh
The man is a sex offender
With a record
Spent six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight- year-old
We see Quintana, in pressed jeans and a stretchy sweater, walking up a stoop in a residential neighborhood and zinging the bell
The - conversation continues
Huh
When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast
The door swings open and a beer-swilling middle-aged man looks dully out at Quintana, who looks hesitantly up
What's a pederast, Walter
Shut the fuck up, Donny
scattered by a strike
wheeling and thrusting a black gloved fist into the air
Stitched above the breast pocket of his all-in-one is his first name, "Jesus"
They have been joined by Donny
Anyway
How much they offer you
Twenty grand
And of course  still keep the rug
Just for making the hand-off
Yeah
He slips a little black box out of his shirt pocket
They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call-- What if it's during a game
told him if it was during league play-- Donny has been watching Quintana
If what's during league play
Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit
What's wrong with Walter, Dude
figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless
mean she probably kidnapped herself
Huh
What do you mean, Dude
Rug-peers did not do this
mean look at it
Young trophy wife
Marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough
She owes money all over town-- That
fucking
bitch
It's all a goddamn fake
Like Lenin said, look for the person who will benefit
And you will, uh, you know, you'll, uh, you know what 'm trying to say-- am the Walrus
That fucking bitch
Yeah
am the Walrus
Shut the fuck up, Donny
Lenin
Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov
What the fuck is he talking about
That's fucking exactly what happened, Dude
That makes me fucking
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter
Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off
Those rich fucks
This whole fucking thing--  did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet-- don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude
Walter, face it, there isn't any connection
It's your roll
Have it your way
The point is-- It's your roll-- The fucking point is-- It's your roll
Are you ready to be fucked, man
They both look up
Quintana, on his way out, looks down at them from the lip of the lanes
Over his polyester all-in-one he now wears a windbreaker with a racing stripe and "Jesus" stitched on the breast
He is holding a fancy black-and-red leather ball satchel (perhaps a Sylvia Wein)
Behind him stands his partner, 'Brien, a short fat Irishman with tufted red hair
see you rolled your way into the semis
Deos mio, man
Seamus and me, we're gonna fuck you up
Yeah well, that's just, ya know, like, your opinion, man
Quintana looks at Walter
Let me tell you something, bendeco
You pull any your crazy shit with us, you flash a piece out on the lanes, 'll take it away from you and stick it up your ass and pull the fucking trigger til it goes "click"
Jesus
You said it, man
Nobody fucks with the Jesus
Jesus walks away
Walter nods sadly
Eight-year-olds, Dude
' We are looking down at the Dude who is prone on the rug
His eyes are closed
He wears a Walkman headset
Leaking tinnily through the headphones we can just hear an intermittent clatter
In his outflung hand lies a cassette case labeled 1987
The Dude absently licks his lips as we faintly hear a hall rumbling down the lane
On its impact with the pins, the Dude opens his eyes
He screams
blonde woman looms over him
Next to  her a  young man in paint-spattered denims stoops and swings something towards the carrier
The sap catches the Dude on the chin and sends  his head thunking back onto the rug
million stars explode against a field of black
We hear the "La-la-la-la" of The Man in Me
The black field  dissolves into  the pattern  of the  rug
The rug rolls away to reveal an aerial view of  the city  of Los  Angeles at twilight, moving below us at great speed
The Dude is flying over the city, his arms thrown out in front of him, the wind whipping his hair and billowing his bowling shirt
He looks up
Ahead the mysterious blonde woman wings away, riding on the Dude's rug like a sheik on a magic carpet
She is outpacing us, growing smaller
The Dude does a couple of lazy crawl strokes and then notices that a bowling ball has materialized in his forward hand
His bemusement turns to concern over the aerodynamic implications just as the ball seems to suddenly assume its weight, abruptly snapping his arm down, and him after it
He is falling
From a high angle we see the Dude hurtling down toward the city, dragged by the ball
reverse  looking  up shows  the Dude  hurtling toward  us out  of the inky  sky,  his eyes  wide with  horror
Led by the bowling  ball, he zooms past the camera leaving us in black
We hear a distant rumble, like thunder
Dull reflections materialize in the darkness
They are glints off the shiny surface of an oncoming bowling ball
We pull back to reveal that the blackness was the inside of a ball return, and the gleaming bowling ball is being regurgitated up at us, overtaking us
The Dude looks up, up, up at the looming ball, its mass rolling a huge shadow across his face
The gleaming ball shows three dead black holes rolling toward us --finger holes
The largest--thumb--hole rolls directly over us, engulfing us once again in black
The black rolls away and we are spinning--spinning down a bowling lane--our point of view that of someone trapped in the thumbhole of the rolling ball
We see the receding bowler spinning away
It is the blonde woman, performing her follow-through
Floor spins up at us and then away; ceiling spins up and away; the length of the alley with pins at the end; floor; ceiling; approaching pins; again and again
We hit the pins and clatter into blackness
We hear pins spin, hit each other and drop
We hear an irritating, insistent beeping
We are close on the Dude, upside down
As the picture fades in the bowling noises continue, but filtered and faint
They come from the Dude's Walkman, the headset of which is now askew, with one arm off his ear
As the Dude opens his eyes we spiral slowly upward to put him right side around
His head is now resting against hardwood floor, not rug
Oh man
He  raises  himself  onto  his  elbows  and  massages  the red   lump  on his  jaw
The  beeper  on his  belt is blinking red  in sync  with the continuing irritating beeps
An  end  table  is  upset,  but  otherwise the  furniture is in place
The rug is gone
The  Dude  looks  around
The  bowling sounds  continue
The beeps continue
The phone starts to jangle
We  push  Brandt  down  the  familiar  marble  hallway
Again  there is a  distant  aria
Brandt  throws  out a wrist to  look at  his watch
They called about eighty minutes ago
They want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5
They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes
One person only or 'd go with you
They were very clear on that: one person only
What happened to your jaw
Oh, nothin', you know
They have reached the little desk outside of the big Lebowski's office; Brandt opens its bottom drawer with a key and takes out an attache case
He hands this to the Dude along with a cellular phone in a battery-pack carrying case
Here's the money, and the phone
Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give
Uh-huh
Her life is in your hands
Oh, man, don't say that
Mr
Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands
Shit
Her life is in your hands, Dude
And report back to us as soon as it's done
' We pan off the Dude, driving, to his point of view through the front windshield
The headlights play over Walter standing waiting in front of the storefront of Though he is wearing khaki shorts and shirt, the fact that he holds a battered brown briefcase makes him look oddly like a commuter
He also holds an irregular shape bundled in brown wrapping paper
The car stops in front of him and he opens the Dude's door and hands in the briefcase
Take the ringer
'll drive
The Dude takes the briefcase and slides over
The what
The ringer
The ringer, Dude
Have they called yet
The Dude opens the briefcase and paws bemusedly through it as the car starts rolling
What the hell is this
My dirty undies
Laundry, Dude
The whites
Agh-- He closes the briefcase
Walter, 'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies-- Thaaaat's right, Dude
The weight
The ringer can't look empty
Walter--what the fuck are you thinking
Well you're right, Dude,  got to thinking
got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand-- We
What the fuck we
You said you just wanted to come along-- My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million
Am  wrong
Yes you're wrong
This isn't a fucking game, Walter-- It is a fucking game
You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself-- ' Yeah, but-- The phone chirps
Dude grabs it
Dude here
(German accent) Who is this
Dude the Bagman
Where do you want us to go
Us
Shit
Uh, yeah, you know, me and the driver
'm not handling the money and driving the car and talking on the phone all by my fucking-- Shut the fuck up
(Beat) Hello
Yeah
Okay, listen-- Walter looks over at the Dude and bellows: Dude, are you fucking this up
Who is that
The driver man,  told you-- Click
Dial tone
Oh shit
Walter
What the fuck is going on there
They hung up, Walter
You fucked it up
You fucked it up
Her life was in our hands
Easy, Dude
We're screwed now
We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her
We're fucked, Walter
Dude, nothing is fucked
Come on
You're being very unDude
They'll call back
Look, she kidnapped her-- The phone chirps
Ya see
Nothing is fucked up here, Dude
Nothing is fucked
These guys are fucking amateurs-- Shutup, Walter
Don't fucking say peep when 'm doing business here
(patronizing) Okay Dude
Have it your way
The Dude unclips the phone from the battery pack
But they're amateurs
The Dude glares at Walter
Into the phone: Dude here
Okay, vee proceed
But only if there is no funny stuff
Yeah
So no funny stuff
Okay
Hey, just tell me where the fuck you want us to go
: It flashes by in the headlights of the roaring car
That was the sign
Walter wrestles the car onto the two-lane road
Yeah
So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain
And we keep the baksheesh
Terrific, Walter
But you haven't told me how we get her back
Where is she
That's the simple part, Dude
When we make the handoff,  grab the guy and beat  it out of him
He looks at the Dude
Huh
Yeah
That's a great plan, Walter
That's fucking ingenious, if understand it correctly
That's a Swiss fucking watch
Thaaat's right, Dude
The beauty of this is its simplicity
If the plan gets too complex something always goes wrong
If there's one thing learned in Nam-- The phone chirps
Dude
You are approaching a vooden britch
When you cross it you srow ze bag from ze left vindow of ze moving kar
Do not slow down
Vee vatch you
Click
Dial tone
What'd he say
Where's the hand- off
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter
At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car
Huh
We throw the money out of the moving car
Walter stares dumbly for a beat
We can't do that, Dude
That fucks up our plan
Well call them up and explain it to 'em, Walter
Your plan is so fucking simple, 'm sure they'd fucking understand it
That's the beauty of it Walter
Wooden bridge, huh
'm throwing the money, Walter
We're not fucking around
The bridge is coming up
Gimme the ringer, Dude
Chop-chop
Fuck that
love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron
Okay, Dude
No time to argue
Here's the bridge-- There is the bump and new steady of the car on the bridge
The Dude is twisting around to pull the money briefcase from the back seat
Walter reaches one arm across Dude's body to grab the laundry
And there goes the ringer
He flings it out the window
Walter
Your wheel, Dude
'm rolling out
What the fuck
Your wheel
At fifteen em-pee-aitch roll out
double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him
The uzi
Uzi
Walter points across the seat at the paper-wrapped bundle
You didn't think  was rolling out of here naked
Walter, please-- Walter has flung open his door and is leaning halfway out over the road
Fifteen
This is it, Dude
Let's take that hill
Walter rolls out with his parcel, giving a loud grunt as he hits the pavement
The car swerves and lurches and the Dude, cursing, takes the wheel
Walter tumbles onto the shoulder and-----
--muzzle flashes tear open the wrapping paper
The car rocks and the Dude wrestles with the wheel
The car clunks and screams around in a skid
The Dude is thrown forward as the car hits something
As the Dude struggles out holding the satchel of money
The front of his car is crumpled into a tree
The car body saps back to the left, where the rear wheel has been shot out
is  just  rising  from  the  ground  massaging an injured knee
The  Dude  runs  up  the  road  toward  the bridge, frantically waving the satchel in the air
There is a distant engine roar
motorcycle bumps up onto the road from the ravine under the bridge and, tires squealing, skids around to speed away in the opposite direction
It is closely followed by two more roaring motorcycles
We have it
The Dude and Walter stand in the middle of the road, watching the three red tail lights fishtail away
: Ahh fuck it, let's go bowling
ball rumbles in to scatter ten pins
He turns from the lane to where the Dude sits in the nook of molded plastic chairs
The Dude listlessly holds the portable phone in his lap
It is ringing
Aitz chaim he, Dude
As the ex used to say
What the fuck is that supposed to mean
What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski
Huh
Oh, him, yeah
Well  don't see, um-- what exactly is the problem
The portable phone stops ringing
Huh
The problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman-- What the fuck're you talking about
That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude
You said so yourself-- No, Walter
said  thought she kidnapped herself
You're the one who's so fucking certain-- That's right, Dude, 1  % certain-- Donny is trotting excitedly up
They posted the next round of the tournament-- Donny, shut the f--when do we play
This Saturday
Quintana and-- Saturday
Well they'll have to reschedule
Walter, what'm  gonna tell Lebowski
told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling
Walter-- Burkhalter
told that kraut a fucking thousand times  don't roll on shabbas
It's already posted
-
Who gives a shit, Walter
What about that poor woman
What do we tell-- 'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back-- How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter
'm shomer shabbas
What's that, Walter
Yeah, and in the meantime what do tell Lebowski
Saturday is shabbas
Jewish day of rest
Means  don't work,  don't drive a car,  don't fucking ride in a car,  don't handle money,  don't turn on the oven, and  sure as shit don't fucking roll
Sheesh
Walter, how-- Shomer shabbas
The Dude gets to his feet with the portable phone
That's it
'm out of here
For Christ's sake, Dude
Walter and Donny join the Dude as he walks out of the bowling alley
Hell, you just tell him--well, you tell him, uh, we made the hand-off, everything went, uh, you know-- Oh yeah, how'd it go
Went alright
Dude's car got a little dinged up-- But Walter, we didn't make the fucking hand- off
They didn't get, the fucking money and they're gonna-- they're gonna-- Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman
" He waves both arms as if conducting a symphony orchestra
Kill that poor woman
Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas-- Really, Dude, you surprise me
They're not gonna kill shit
They're not gonna do shit
What can they do
Fuckin' amateurs
And meanwhile, look at the bottom line
Who's sitting on a million fucking dollars
Am  wrong
Walter-- Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here
"Our" car, Walter
And what do they got, Dude
My dirty undies
My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car
The three bowlers, stopped at the edge of the lot, stare out at an empty parking space
Who has your undies, Walter
Where's your car, Dude
You don't know, Walter
You seem to know the answer to everything else
Hmm
Well, we were in a handicapped spot
It, uh, it was probably towed
It's been stolen, Walter
You fucking know it's been stolen
Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude-- Aw, fuck it
The Dude walks away across the lot
The portable phone starts ringing again
Where you going, Dude
'm going home, Donny
Your phone's ringing, Dude
Thank you, Donny
' The Dude is slumped disconsolately back in his easy chair, fingers of one hand cupped over his sunglasses
Facing him on the couch are two uniformed policeman, one middle-aged, the other a fresh-faced rookie
At the cut the portable phone, in the Dude's lap, is chirping
The Dude waits for the rings to end
When they do: 1972 Pontiac LeBaron
Color
Green
Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration
And was there anything of value in the car
: Huh
Oh
Yeah
Tape deck
Couple of Creedence tapes
And there was a, uh
my briefcase
In the briefcase
Papers
Just papers
You know, my papers
Business papers
And what do you do, sir
'm unemployed
Most people, we're working nights, they offer us coffee
There is silence
Dude continues to stare at a spot on the floor
The older cop stares at him
Me,  don't drink coffee
But it's nice when they offer
: Also, my rug was stolen
Your rug was in the car
The Dude taps the floor with his foot
No
Here
Separate incidents
The Dude stares at the floor
Silence
Snap out of it, son
The home phone starts ringing--a ring distinct  from the chirp of the portable
The Dude makes no move to answer it
Finally the rings stop as an answering machine kicks on
You find them much
Stolen cars
Dude's Voice on Machine The Dude's not in
Leave a message after the beep
It takes a minute
Sometimes
wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though
Or the Creedence tapes
And the, uh, the briefcase
Beep
Mr
Lebowski, 'd like to see you
Call when you get home and 'll send a car for you
My name is Maude Lebowski
'm the woman who took the rug
Beep
Dial tone
Well,  guess we can close the file on that one
We are moving through the open living area of a large downtown loft
huge unfinished canvas,  lit by  standing industrial lights, dominates one wall
The furnishings  are spare  given the space
On the floor is the Dude's brilliant rug
We hear a rumble like an approaching bowling ball
The Dude, standing in the middle of the loft, looks into the murky depths of the cavernous space
Something huge and white hurtles towards the Dude's head
As it roars overhead he ducks, and spins to watch it pass
We see the backside of a naked woman in a sling suspended from a ceiling track rumbling over a canvas that lies on the floor
She is holding a paint bucket in one hand and a brush in the other, with which she flicks paint down at the canvas
The Dude turns again as he hears running footsteps
Two young men in paint-spattered shorts, -shirts and sneakers reach the sling shortly after it reaches the end of its track and haul it back for another push
'll be with you in a minute, Mr
Lebowski
She rumbles by in another pass
All right, we'll do the blue tomorrow
Elfranco
Pedro
Help me down
The  two  men  help Maude  out of  her sling
She  is naked except for leather  harness  straps  which  ring  her  breasts and wrap  her thighs and give her something of a dominatrix look
Does the female form make you uncomfor- table, Mr
Lebowski
Is that what that's a picture of
In a sense, yes
Elfranco, my robe
My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal
Which bothers some men
The word itself makes some men uncomfortable
Vagina
Oh yeah
Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say
Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson"
"Johnson"
Thank you
This to Elfranco, who has handed her a robe
All right, Mr
Lebowski, let's get down to cases
My father told me he's agreed to let you have the rug, but it was a gift from me to my late mother, and so was not his to give
Now
As for this
"kidnapping"-- Huh
Yes,  know about it
And  know that you acted as courier
And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven
Right, but let me explain something about that rug-- Do you like sex, Mr
Lebowski
Excuse me
Sex
The physical act of love
Coitus
Do you like it
was talking about my rug
You're not interested in sex
You mean coitus
like it too
It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex
It can be a natural, zesty enterprise
But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy
Oh, no
Yes Mr
Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word
Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these
Listen, Maude, 'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but  don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua
Take a look at this, sir
She is aiming a remote at a projection
The screen flickers to life
title card: : : ' The Dude is at the bar, a bottle of kalhua frozen halfway to his glass
From the television set we hear a doorbell ring, and then  a door opening
On the  screen the door opens to reveal a sallow-faced man in blue coyer-alls
It is Dieter, the floater in Lebowski's pool
Hello
Nein dizbatcher says zere iss problem mit deine kable
Shit,  know that guy
He's a nihilist
And you recognize her, of course
The girl answering the door is Bunny Lebowski
Bunny The  is in here
Za, okay,  bring mein toolz
Bunny This is my friend Shari
She just came over to use the shower
(grimly) The story is ludicrous
Mein nommen iss Karl
Is hard to verk in zese clozes-- Maude switches off the set
Lord
You can imagine where it goes from here
He fixes the cable
Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey
Little matter to me that this woman chose to pursue a career in pornography, nor that she has been "banging" Jackie Treehorn, to use the parlance of our times
However
am one of two trustees of the Lebowski Foundation, the other being my father
The Foundation takes youngsters from Watts and-- Shit yeah, the achievers
Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them
asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this "abduction", but  tell you it is preposterous
This compulsive fornicator is taking my father for the proverbial ride
Yeah, but my- 'm getting to your rug
My  father and  don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say,  don't approve of his
Still,  hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so 'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to
Well--sure,  could do that-- If you successfully do so,  will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum
hundred
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them
Yeah, but what about-- --your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me
And  am sorry about that crack on the jaw
The Dude fingers his jaw, where the lump from the sap has all but disappeared
Oh that's okay,  hardly even-- Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you
You will receive no bill
He's a good man, and thorough
That's really thoughtful but -- Please see him, Jeffrey
He's a good man, and thorough
The Dude sits in back holding a White Russian,  listening to the chauffeur, a man of about the same age from whose livery cap a ponytail emerges
--So he says, "My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and  got a rash on my ass so bad  can't hardly siddown
But you know me
can't complain
" : Fuckin' , man
got a rash
Fuckin' , man
gotta tell ya Tony
He takes a sip of a freshly-mixed White Russian, which leaves milk on his mustache
was feeling really shitty earlier in the day, 'd lost  a little  money,   was down in the dumps
Aw, forget about it
Yeah, man
Fuck it
can't be worrying about that shit
Life goes on
The limo has rolled to a stop
The Dude gets out, still holding his drink
Home sweet home, Mr
Who's your friend in the Volkswagon
Huh
His eyes on the rearview mirror, Tony jerks a thumb over his shoulder
He followed us here
The Dude turns to look
Halfway up the block a Volkswagon bug has pulled over to the curb
In the driver's seat we see a fat man's shape
He scowls
When did he- The Dude is grabbed from behind and muscled away in a half- nelson by another uniformed chauffeur
Into the limo, you sonofabitch
No arguments
As he is frog-marched towards another limo the Dude holds his drink away from his chest and cups a hand underneath it
Fuck, man
There's a beverage here
The waiting limo's back door is flung open
The Dude is shoved in and awkwardly takes a seat facing the rear
The door is slammed behind him
Start talking and talk fast you lousy bum
We've been frantically trying to reach you, Dude
Brandt sits catty-corner from the Dude; directly across from the Dude is the big Lebowski, a comforter across his knees
Where's my goddamn money, you bum
Well we-- don't-- They did not receive the money, you nitwit
They  did not receive the goddamn money This is our concern, Dude
No, man, nothing is fucked here-- The Dude takes a hurried sip from his drink
'mon man, who're you gonna believe
Those guys are--we dropped off the damn money-- --the royal we, you know, the editorial-- dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, 've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know
What in God's holy name are you blathering about
'll tell you what 'm blathering about
got information--new shit has come to light and--shit, man
She kidnapped herself
Lebowski stares at him, dumbstruck
The Dude is encouraged
Well sure, look at it
Young trophy wife,  mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but 'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey,  mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you
Sir
(quietly) No
No Mr
Lebowski, that had not occurred to me
That had not occurred to us, Dude
Well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for
Speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash
gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax-- Brandt, give him the envelope
Well, okay, if you've already made out the check
Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside
We received it this morning
The Dude, frowning, untucks its flap, takes out some cotton wadding and unrolls it
Since you have failed to achieve, even in the modest task that was your charge, since you have stolen my money, and since you have unrepentantly betrayed my trust
The wadding, undone, reveals a smaller wad of gauze taped up inside
The Dude undoes the tape with his fingernails and starts to unroll the inner package
have no choice but to tell these bums that they should do whatever is necessary to recover their money from you, Jeffrey Lebowski
And with Brandt as my witness, tell you this:  Any further harm visited upon Bunny, shall be visited tenfold upon your head
Between thumb and forefinger the Dude holds up the contents of the package--a little toe, with emerald green nail polish
By God sir
will not abide another toe
The Dude and Walter sit at the counter, both staring off into space, both absently stirring their coffee with little clinking noises
: That wasn't her toe
Whose toe was it, Walter
How the fuck should  know
do know that nothing about it indicates-- The nail polish, Walter
Fine, Dude
As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe-- Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna-- You want a toe
can get you a toe, believe me
There are ways, Dude
You don't wanna know about it, believe me
But Walter-- 'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish
These fucking amateurs
They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear
Jesus Christ
My point is-- They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me-- Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude
So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes-- What about the toe
waitress enters
Could you please keep your voices down--this is a family restaurant
Oh, please dear
've got news for you: the Supreme Court has roundly rejected prior restraint
Walter, this isn't a First Amendment thing
Sir, if you don't calm down 'm going to have to ask you to leave
Lady,  got buddies who died face- down in the muck so you and  could enjoy this family restaurant
: All right, 'm leaving
'm sorry ma'am
Don't run away from this, Dude
Goddamnit, this affects all of us
The Dude has left frame; Walter calls after him: Our basic freedoms
He looks defiantly around
'm staying
Finishing my coffee
He stirs the coffee, bopping his head in time to the Muzak, affecting nonchalance
Finishing my coffee
' dripping noise
The Dude sits in the bathtub, staring stuporously, a joint pinched in one hand, a washcloth draped over his head
We hear the phone ringing in the other roam
The Dude is staring at his toes, which protrude from the soapy water, splayed against the far side of the tub
After the Dude's outgoing message we hear: Mr
Lebowski, this is Duty Officer Rolvaag of the
The Dude looks stuporously up, his head swaying
We've recovered your vehicle
It can be claimed at the North Hollywood Auto Circus there on Victory
Far out
Far fuckin' out
You'll just need to present a-- The message is interrupted by loud smashing sounds, as of someone applying a baseball bat to the answering machine
Hunh
He looks blearily at the open doorway
tall man dressed in black leather with a cricket paddle is striding across the living room towards the bathroom
Hey
This is a private residence, man
The man has entered the bathroom and, in stride, swings the cricket paddle up to smash the overhead light
Two other men are entering behind him
The room is dark now except for spill from the living room; the men are backlit shapes
One of them holds a string at the other end of which a small animal skitters excitedly about the floor
The Dude looks curiously at the small, nattering animal
Nice marmot
The man with the string scoops up the marmot and tosses it, screaming, into the bathtub
The Dude screams
The marmot splashes frantically, biting at the Dude in a frenzy of fearful aggression
Vee vant zat money, Lebowski
The Dude, screaming, grabs the lip of the tub and starts to hoist himself up but the first man lays a palm on top of his head and squishes him back into the water
You think veer kidding und making mit de funny stuff
Vee could do things you only dreamed of, Lebowski
Ja, vee could really do it, Lebowski
Vee belief in nossing
He scoops the marmot out of the water
It shakes itself off, spraying the Dude
Jesus
Vee belief in nossing, Lebowski
The marmot, back on the floor, is skittering around, shaking itself and convulsing in little sneezes
Jesus Christ
Tomorrow vee come back und cut off your chonson
Excuse me
The three men turn to leave
Over their retreating backs: Just sink about zat, Lebowski
Ja, your viggly penis, Lebowski
Ja, und maybe vee stamp on it und skvush it, Lebowski
policeman with a clipboard is leading the Dude through a large parking lot
You're lucky she wasn't chopped, Mr
Lebowski
Must've been a joyride situation; they abandoned the car once they hit the retaining wall
They have reached the Dude's car
The  driver's side exterior has been scraped raw
The policeman hands the Dude a door  handle and an exterior rear-view mirror
These were on the road next to the car
You'll have to get in on the other side
The Dude climbs in the passenger side
My fucking briefcase
It's not here
Yeah, sorry,  saw that on the report
You're lucky they left the tape deck though
My fucking briefcase
Jesus--what's that smell
Uh, yeah
Probably a vagrant, slept in the car
Or perhaps just used it as a toilet, and moved on
The Dude tries to roll down the driver's window but it will not go; he bellows through the glass: When will you find these guys mean, do you have any promising leads
The policeman laughs, agreeing broadly
Leads, yeah
'll just check with the boys down at the Crime Lab
They've assigned four more detectives to the case, got us working in shifts
The Dude looks sadly through his window at the policeman rocking back on his heels, his raucous laughter muffled by the glass
The Dude, Walter and Donny sit at the bar, the Dude with a White Russian, Walter with a beer, and Donny eating beer nuts
And then they're gonna stamp on it
Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny
figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off
Now that is ridiculous, Dude
No one is going to cut your dick off
Thanks Walter
Not if  have anything to say about it
(bitterly) Yeah, thanks Walter
That gives me a very secure feeling
Dude-- That makes me feel all warm inside
Now Dude-- This whole fucking thing--  could be sitting here with just pee-stains on my rug
Walter sadly shakes his head
Fucking Germans
Nothing changes
Fucking Nazis
They were Nazis, Dude
Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration
Uh-huh
Are you gonna split hairs
No-- Am  wrong
Well-- They're nihilists
Huh
They kept saying they believe in nothing
Nihilists
Jesus
Walter looks haunted
Say what you like about the tenets of National Socialism, Dude, at least it's an ethos
Yeah
And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either
What're you, a fucking park ranger now
No, 'm-- Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot
--We're sympathizing here, Dude-- Fuck your sympathy
don't need your sympathy, man,  need my fucking Johnson
What do you need that for, Dude
You gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude-- Fuck the tournament
Fuck you, Walter
There is a moment of stunned silence
Fuck the tournament
; : Okay Dude
can see you don't want to be cheered up
'mon Donny, let's go get a lane
They leave the Dude sitting morosely at the bar
As he stares : Another Caucasian, Gary
Right, Dude
: Friends like these, huh Gary
That's right, Dude
The pop song on the jukebox has ended; someone puts on "Tumbling Tumbleweeds
" man saunters up to the bar to take the stool that Walter vacated
He is middle-aged, amiable, craggily handsome--Sam Elliot, perhaps
He has a large Western-style mustache and wears denims, a yoked shirt and a cowboy hat
: 'ya have a good sarsaparilla
We recognize the voice of The Stranger whose narration opened the movie
Sioux City Sarsaparilla
The Stranger nods
That's a good one
Waiting for his drink, he looks amiably around the bar
His crinkled eyes settle on the Dude
How ya doin' there, Dude
The Dude, still staring down at his drink, shakes his head
Ahh, not so good, man
One a those days, huh
Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you
(absently) Uh-huh
That some kind of Eastern thing
Far from it
Mm
The bartender puts a brown bottle and a frosted glass on the bar in front of The Stranger, who touches his hat brim
Much obliged
He looks back at the Dude
like your style, Dude
, : Well  like your style too, man
Got a whole cowboy thing goin'
Thankie
Just one thing, Dude
'ya have to use s'many cuss words
The Dude looks at The Stranger as if just now noticing how out of place the cowpoke is
The fuck are you talking about
The Stranger chuckles indulgently and pushes off from the bar
Okay, have it your way
He brushes his hat brim with a fingertip
Take it easy, Dude
Yeah
Thanks man
He is gone
"Tumbling Tumbleweeds" is ending as we hear an offscreen voice, breaking the spell: Dude
Dude
: Tony, the unformed limo driver, is at the door of the bar, beckoning
' She strides toward us, naked under a robe which she is just cinching shut
Paint flecks her skin
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor
No it's fine, really, uh-- Do you have any news regarding my father's money
, uh
money, yeah,  gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all
She most certainly was not
Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally
You might learn something
Now  got-- And please don't call her my mother
Now  got-- She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim
'm telling you,  got definitive evidence-- From who
The main guy, Dieter-- Dieter Hauff
Well--yeah,  guess-- Her "co-star" in the beaver picture
Beaver
You mean vagina
-- mean, you know him
Dieter has been on the fringes of-- well, of everything in
, for about twenty years
Look at my 's
Under 'Autobahn
' The Dude fingers through the albums filling one bookshelf
That was his group--they released one album in the mid-seventies
The Dude stops between two albums
Roy Orbison
Pink Floyd
Huh
Autobahn
-u-t-o
Their music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop
The Dude pulls out an album with a worn sleeve
On it is the group's name, Autobahn, the album name, Nagelbett, and a picture , - back hair, gazing upward in thin-lipped epiphany
They are wearing severe but modishly retro suits
Each has his name under his picture--Dieter, Kieffer; and Franz
bed of nails is the only set dressing on the cyc
Jeez
miss vinyl
Is he pretending to be the abductor
Well
yeah-- Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with
You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are
Well yeah
know that
So Dieter has the money
Well, no, not exactly
It's a complicated case, Maude
Lotta ins
Lotta outs
And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man
Lotta strands in old Duder's-- Do you still have that doctor's number
Huh
No, really,  don't even have the bruise any more, -- She is scribbling
Please Jeffrey
don't want to be responsible for any delayed after- effects
Delayed after-eff-- want you to see him immediately
She is picking up a telephone
'll see if he's available
He's a good man, and thorough
His eyes are closed, a headset on, his shirt off
Leaking tinnily through the headset we hear the opening bars of "Comin' Up Around the Bend
" Behind him, cropped so that we see only a little of his torso, a white-smocked figure taps at the Dude's back
After a moment the figure circles to one side, out of frame
His hand reaches in to pull one arm of the headset away from the Dude's ear, and as he does so the music issues more strongly
Could you slide your shorts down please, Mr
Lebowski
The Dude's eyes open
Huh
No, she, she hit me right here
understand sir
Could you slide your shorts down please
' The Dude is driving home
Creedence tape plays
The Dude is sucking down a joint
He glances at the rear-view mirror-- and, noticing something, looks again
Volkswagon bug is following, a lone fat man driving
His eyes still on the mirror, he absently takes the joint between thumb and forefinger of his right hand and flicks it out the driver's window--except that the window is not open
The butt bounces off the glass and around the car, showering sparks
' The glowing butt rolls down the car seat between his legs
The Dude screams
The car careens wildly as the surrounding traffic veers off to, make way, horns blaring
The car finally spins and comes to rest with its passenger side wrapped into a telephone poll
The Dude frantically grabs at his door, which won't open, and then slides over to push at the passenger door, which also won't open
Fuck Me
But he is sitting on the passenger  side now,  away from the lit butt
He looks around for it
Smoke is wisping up from between the Driver's seat cushion and back cushion
Fuckola, man
He takes his beer and pours it in between the cushions
There is a hissing  sound
But there is a piece of paper sticking out from between the cushions
The Dude pulls it out
It is lined spiral notebook paper, slightly singed and dripping beer, covered with handwriting
In the upper right- hand corner is the name Lawrence Sellers, and under that, Mrs
Jamtoss 5th Period
The theme is titled "The Louisiana Purchase
"  In red ink is a large circled  and some handwritten marginal comments; misspelled words are circled in red throughout
' We are behind Walter, the Dude, and Donny, facing the stage in the background where Allan, the Dude's balding landlord, is performing a dance moderne
As Walter talks to the Dude he leans in to him, his voice hushed, so as not to disturb the rest of the very sparse audience
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger-- The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose
Near the In-and-Out Burger-- Those are good burgers, Walter
Shut the fuck up, Donny
This kid is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his father is--are you ready for this
-- Arthur Digby Sellers
Who the fuck is that
Huh
Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers
Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude
Yeah
All but one man died
There at Bitter Creek
Yeah yeah,  know the fucking show Walter, so what
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude
Uh-huh
The bulk of the series
Uh-huh
Not exactly a lightweight
No
And yet his son is a fucking dunce
Uh
Yeah, go figure
Well we'll go out there after the, uh, the
He waves a hand vaguely toward the stage
What have you
We'll, uh-- We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger
Shut the fuck up, Donny
We'll, uh, brace the kid--he'll be a pushover
We'll get that fucking money, if he hasn't spent it already
Million fucking clams
And yes, we'll be near the, uh--some burgers, some beers, a few laughs
Our fucking troubles are over, Dude
The Dude and Walter are pulling up in front of a dilapidated house sitting on a scrubby lot
Parked incongruously in front of the house is a brand new red Corvette
Fuck me, man
That kid's already spent all the money
Hardly Dude, a new 'vette
The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options
Wait in the car, Donny
Walter rings the bell
It is opened by a matronly Spanish woman
Jace
Hello, Pilar
My name is Walter Sobchak, we spoke on the phone, this is my associate Jeffrey Lebowski
Jace
May we uh, we wanted to talk about little Larry
May we come in
Jace
They enter a dim living room and stand, looking about, as Pilar : Larry
Sweetie
Dat mang is here
There is a rhythmic compressor sound; Walter places it and nudges the Dude
At the other end of the living room a man lies on something that looks like a hospital gurney with its midsection enclosed by a motorized stainless-steel bubble
It is an iron lung, artificially breathing with distinct hisses in and out
That's him, Dude
And a good day to you, sir
See down, please
Thank you, ma'am
He and the Dude sit on a sagging green sofa
In a lowered voice, to Pilar: Does he, uh
Is he still writing
No, no
He has healt' problems
Uh-huh
: just want to say, sir, that we're both enormous--on a personal level, Branded, especially the early episodes, has been a source of, uh, inspir--- There are footsteps on the stairs
Larry, a fifteen-year- old, looks at the two men
See down, Sweetie
These are the policeman-- No ma'am,  didn't mean to give the impression that we're police exactly
We're hoping that it will not be necessary to call the police
He adopts his command voice in turning to Larry: But that is up to little Larry here
Isn't it, Larry
Walter pops the latches on his attache case and takes out the homework, which is now in a ziploc bag
He holds it out at arm's length, displaying it to Larry
Is this your homework, Larry
Larry does not respond
Is this your homework, Larry
Look, man, did you-- Dude, please
Is this your homework, Larry
Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man
Walter is still holding out the homework
Is this yours, Larry
Is this your homework, Larry
Is the car out front yours
Is this your homework, Larry
We know it's his fucking homework, Walter
Where's the fucking money, you little brat
Throughout Walter has been staring at Larry with the homework extended towards him
Look, Larry
Have you ever heard of Vietnam
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter
You're going to enter a world of pain, son
We know that this is your homework
We know you stole a car-- And the fucking money
And the fucking money
And we know that this is your homework, Larry
No answer
You're gonna  your , Larry
,  : Ah, this is pointless
As he shoves the homework back in the attache case: All right, Plan
You might want to watch out the front window there, Larry
He is heading for the door
The Dude, puzzled, rises to follow him
This is what happens when you  a in the , Larry
Walter is striding down the lawn with his attache case like an enraged encyclopedia salesman
Without looking back at, the Dude, who follows: Fucking language problem, Dude
He pops the Dude's trunk, flings in the briefcase and takes out a tire iron
Maybe he'll understand this
He is walking over to the Corvette
,
He swings the crowbar into the windshield, which shatters
He takes out the driver's window
Lights are going on in houses down the street
Distant dogs bark
'  ,
' man in a sleeveless -shirt and boxer shorts has run over behind Walter and grabbed him from behind on a backswing of the crowbar
,
He wrestles the crowbar away from the startled Walter
'
Walter cringes before the enraged Mexican
Hunh
The man looks about, wildly
,
-- He runs over to the Dude's car
No
No
' -- Glass rains in on a terrified, cringing, Donny
: ' We are looking into the car through the broken windshield as it rattles down the freeway
Wind whistles through the caved- in windows
The Dude drives, his jaw clenched, staring grimly out at the road
Walter, beside him, and Donny in the back seat, munch 'on In-and-Out Burgers
Creedence music plays above the bluster of wind
' As the Dude talks on the phone he is hammering a two-by-four into the floor just inside, and parallel to, the front door
accept your apology
No , just want to handle it myself from now on
No
That has nothing to do with it
Yes, it made it home, 'm calling from home
No, Walter, it didn't look like Larry was about to crack
He finishes hammering, rises and grabs a straightbacked chair that stands nearby
Well that's your perception
Well you're right, Walter, and the unspoken Message is Yeah, 'll be at practice
He hangs up and has just finished sliding the chair into place with its top under the doorknob and its legs braced against the two-by-four, thus wedging the door closed, when the door is opened--outwards
The chair clatters to the floor
Huh
Woo and the blond man who earlier peed on the rug stride in, kicking the chair away
Pin your diapers on, Lebowski
Jackie Treehorn wants to see you
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski
Yeah
Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski
You're not dealing with morons here
Out of the blackness something is falling toward us
It is a woman, falling in slow motion, her limbs flailing, her mouth contorted by either fear or ecstasy
She is topless
She falls past the camera, leaving blackness, then after a beat reappears, rising into the night sky
crowd of mostly tanned middle-aged men with blow-dried hair, wearing jogging outfits and other expensively casual attire, are blanket-tossing the squealing young woman in nightmarish slow motion
It is a party, lit by festive beach lights and standing kerosene heaters
1960's mainstream jazz, of the Mancini- Brubeck school, has been piped down to speakers on the beach'
In long shot now the woman rises, squealing, disappears into darkness, descends into light, rises again
man walks towards the camera through the pools of beach light
He is handsome, fiftyish, wearing cotton twill pants and a Turnbull & Asher shirt with a foulard knotted at the neck
Behind him, the woman rises and falls, appears and disappears
Hello Dude, thanks for coming
'm Jackie Treehorn
The Dude is looking around at the '60's modern decor
This is quite a pad you got here, man
Completely unspoiled
What's your drink, Dude
White Russian, thanks
How's the smut business, Jackie
wouldn't know, Dude
deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and-- Which one was Logjammin'
Regrettably, it's true, standards have fallen in adult entertainment
It's video, Dude
Now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest that little extra in story, production value, feeling
He taps his forehead with one finger
People forget that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone-- On you, maybe
He hands him the drink
Of course, you do get the good with the bad
The new technology permits us to do exciting things with interactive erotic software
Wave of the future, Dude
100% electronic
Uh-huh
Well,  still jerk off manually
Of course you do
can see you're anxious for me to get to the point
Well Dude, here it is
Where's Bunny
thought you might know, man
Me
How would  know
The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me
But she hasn't run off, she's been-- Treehorn waves this off
've heard the kidnapping story, so save it
know you're mixed up in all this, Dude, and  don't care what you're trying to take off her husband
That's your business
All 'm saying is,  want mine
Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties
If  can find your money, man-- what's in it for the Dude
Of course, there's that to discuss
Refill
Does the Pope shit in the woods
Let's say a 10% finder's fee
Okay, Jackie, done
like the way you do business
Your money is being held by a kid named Larry Sellers
He lives in North Hollywood, on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger
real fuckin' brat, but 'm sure your goons'll be able to get it off him, mean he's only fifteen and he's flunking social studies
So if you'll just write me a check for my ten per cent
of half a million
fifty grand
He is getting to his feet, but sways woozily
'll go out and mingle
--Jesus, you mix a hell of a Caucasian, Jackie
The Dude shakes his head, tries to focus
fifteen-year-old
Is this your idea of a joke
Jackie Treehorn's image starts to swim
He is joined on either side by Woo and the blond man, all three men looking grimly down at the Dude
No funny stuff, Jackie
the kid's got it
Hiya, fellas
kid just wanted a car
All the Dude ever wanted
was his rug back
not greedy
it really
He squints at Jackie Treehorn, who swims in and out of focus
Tied the room together
He tips forward, spilling his drink off the table
Looking up at the Dude as his face hits the glass and squishes
' Darkness warshed over the Dude-- darker'n a black steer's tookus on a moonless prairie night
There was no bottom
We hear a thundering bass
: : : The title logo is a suggestively upright bowling pin flanked by a pair of  bowling balls
The  bending bass sound turns into the lead-in to Kenny Rogers and the First Edition's "Just Dropped In
" The Dude is walking down a long corridor dressed as a cable repairman
The Dude's face is washed with a brilliant light as the corridor opens onto a gleaming bowling alley
In the center of the alley stands Maude Lebowski, singing operatic harmony to the Kenny Rogers song
She wears an armored breastplate and Norse headgear, has braided pigtails, and holds a trident
The Dude stands behind her and, pressed up against her, helps her with her follow-through as she releases a bowling ball
The lane is straddled by a line of chorines in spangly mini- skirts, their arms akimbo, Busby-Berkley style, their legs turning the lane into a tunnel leading to the pins at the end
But it is no longer a bowling ball rolling between their legs--it is the Dude himself, levitating inches off the lane, the tools from his utility belt swinging free
He is face down, his arms, torpedolike, pressed against his sides
His point of view shows the lane rushing by below, the little ball-guide arrows zipping by
The Dude twists his body around, performing a barrel-roll so that he is now gliding along the lane face-up
Now his point of view looks up the dresses of the passing chorines
The Dude smiles dreamily and does a backstroke motion so that he is once again gliding face-down
He looks forward and his forward momentum blows back his hair
Coming at us, as we go through the last few pairs of legs, are the approaching pins
We hit the pins, scattering them, and rush on into black
body drops down into the blackness in slow motion--a topless woman, squealing, her legs kicking
As she drops out of frame, leaving blackness again, three men are entering from the background, emerging into a pool of light
It is the Germans, advancing ominously, wielding oversized shears which they menacingly scissor
The Dude, now standing in a field of black, reacts to the advancing Germans
He turns and runs, fists pumping
The scissoring sound of the shears turns into the whoosh of car-bys
The field of black is punctured by headlights
The Dude is running blearily down the middle of the Pacific Coast Highway
Cars rush by on either side, horns blaring
With the - of a short siren blast, a squad car with flashing gumballs pulls up
The Dude sits in the back seat, his head lolling with the motion of the car as he blearily sings the theme of Branded: He was innocent
Not a charge was true
And they say he ran awaaaaaay
' The Dude is hurled against the chief's desk, which he bounces off of, to come to rest more or less seated in a facing chair
His wallet is tossed onto the desk
The chief leans forward, takes the wallet and sorts through it with disgusted incredulity
This is your only
He is looking at the Ralph's Shopper's Club card
know my rights
You don't know shit, Lebowski
want a fucking lawyer, man want Bill Kunstler
What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties
Uh-huh
Mr
Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive
That guy treats women like objects, man
Mr
Treehorn draws a lot of water in this town, Lebowski
You don't draw shit
We got a nice quiet beach community here, and  aim to keep it nice and quiet
So let me make something plain
don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski
don't like your jerk- off name,  don't like your jerk-off face,  don't like your jerk- off behavior, and  don't like you, jerk- off --do  make myself clear
The Dude stares
'm sorry,  wasn't listening
The Chief hurls his steaming mug of coffee at the Dude
It hits him in the forehead with a thud, the scalding coffee splashing everywhere
The Chief is already up off his chair, rounding the desk
--Ow
Fucking fascist
The Chief slaps him twice
Stay out of Malibu, Lebowski
He kicks the chair out from under the Dude, and then starts kicking at him
Stay out of Malibu, deadbeat
Keep your ugly fucking goldbricking ass out of my beach community
The Dude, in the back seat of a taxicab that rocks and squeaks with every bump, is gingerly touching at sore spots on his face and scalp
"Peaceful Easy Feeling" is on the radio
' The back of the driver, a large black man with rasta dreds under a knit cap
Jesus, man, can you change the station
Fuck you man
You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab
've had a-- pull over and kick your ass out, man
--had a rough night, and  hate the fucking Eagles, man-- That's it
Outta this fucking cab
The cab screeches over towards the curb
Another car, oncoming, its radio blaring Metallica, speeds by
It is a red convertible
The driver, singing loudly and badly along with the radio, her hair blowing in the wind, a dreamy smile on her face as she speeds along, higher than a kite, is Bunny Lebowski
On the accelerator her right foot, in an open-toed bright red high-heeled shoe, has five painted toes
When she downshifts her left foot enters to engage the clutch
Five more toes
' The Dude staggers in the open front door, one hand pressed to a lump on his forehead, and looks around
Jesus
The place is a wreck
Furniture has been overturned, upholstery slashed, drawers dumped
Quiet
The door to the bedroom starts to creak open
The Dude cringes
Maude emerges from the bedroom
She is wearing a bathrobe
Jeffrey
Maude
She pulls open the bathrobe as she approaches
Love me
The Dude is stupefied
That's my robe
: After a beat, a long sigh, and then a voice from the blackness: Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey
Well, uh
Not much to tell
match is dragged across a headboard; the Dude is lighting himself a joint
He shakes the match out to restore blackness except for the glowing tip of the joint
was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement
--The original Port Huron Statement
Uh-huh
Not the compromised second draft
And then , uh
Ever hear of the Seattle Seven
Mmnun
Click--the Dude turns on a bedside lamp
He and Maude lie next to each other in bed
And then
let's see,  uh--music business briefly
Oh
Yeah
Roadie for Metallica
Speed of Sound Tour
Uh-huh
Bunch of assholes
And then, you know, little of this, little of that
My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately
What do you do for fun
Oh, you know, the usual
Bowl
Drive around
The occasional acid flashback
He climbs out of bed but Maude remains in it
She wedges a pillow into the small of her back and clasps a hand on each kneecap
She pulls her knees in toward her chest to keep her pelvis raised
What happened to your house
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place
Wanted to save the finder's fee
Finder's fee
He thought  had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's
Why did he think you had it
And who does
Larry Sellers, a high-school kid
Real fucking brat
He picks a White Russian off the bedside table
Jeffrey-- It's a complicated case, Maude
Lotta ins, lotta outs
Fortunately 've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber
'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close
It's just-- keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money
Father doesn't have any
Huh
He's fucking loaded
No no, the wealth was all Mother's
But your father--he runs stuff, he-- We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it
But he's-- He helps administer the charities now, and  give him a reasonable allowance
He has no money of his own
know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity
Hence the slut
Huh
Jeez
Well, so, did he--is that yoga
Throughout, Maude has been lying on her back with her knees pulled in
It increases the chances of conception
The Dude spits some White Russian
Increases
Well yes, what did you think this was all about
Fun and games
Well
no, of course not-- want a child
Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude-- Look, Jeffrey,  don't want a partner
In fact  don't want the father to be someone  have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself
Huh
Something occurs to him
So
that doctor
Exactly
What happened to your face
Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well
The Dude is staring off into space, thinking
His answer is absent
No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu
real reactionary
So your father
Oh man,  get it
What
The Dude is leaving the bedroom
Yeah, my thinking about the case, man, it had become uptight
Yeah
Your father-- The Dude finishes punching a number into the phone
This is Walter Sobchak
'm not in; leave a message after the beep
: ' What're you talking about
Beep
Walter, if you're there, pick up the fucking phone
Pick it up, Walter, this is an emergency
'm not-- Dude
Walter, listen, 'm at my place, need you to come pick me up-- can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas
Huh
Erev shabbas
can't drive
'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency
It is a fucking emergency
understand
That's why  picked up the phone
' --fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to-- Dude, 'm not supposed to make calls-- ,   , '
' Jeffrey
He emerges on his front stoop, pulling on a shirt
His attention is caught by something down the street
car is  parked halfway down the block
We can see the shape of a fat man in the driver's seat
Striding purposefully down the street
The fat man leans forward and we hear the sound of the car's ignition coughing, but the engine will not turn over
More whines and coughs; no start
The man hurriedly fumbles in front of him
He brings up a newspaper, which he holds before his face
As he gets to the car
He reaches through the open driver's window and grabs the newspaper and hurls it to the ground
He is revved with nervous energy
Get out of that fucking car, man
The man nervously complies
The Dude flinches at the man's movement as he gets out
The man cringes, reacting to the Dude's flinch
He is wearing a cheap blue serge suit
He is bald with a short fringe and a mustache
The Dude shouts to cover his fear: Who the fuck are you, man
Come on, man
Relax, man
No physical harm intended
Who the fuck are you
Why've you been following me
Come on, fuckhead
Hey, relax man, 'm a brother shamus
The Dude is stunned
Brother Shamus
Like an Irish monk
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about
My name's Da Fino
'm a private snoop
Like you, man
Huh
dick, man
And let me tell you something:  dig your work
Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man
'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man
Hey hey, 'm not messing with your special lady-- She's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend
'm just helping her conceive, man
Hey, man, 'm not-- Who're you working for
Lebowski
Jackie Treehorn
The Gundersons
The
Who the fff-- The Gundersons
It's a wandering daughter job
Bunny Lebowski, man
Her real name is Fawn Gunderson
Her parents want her back
He is fumbling in his wallet
See
The Dude looks at the picture
It is probably a school portrait, unmistakably Bunny, but fresh-faced, much younger looking, with a corn-fed smile and straight Partridge Family hair and bangs
Jesus fucking Christ
Crazy, huh
Ran away a year ago
He is holding out another picture
The Gundersons told me to show her this when  found her
The family farm
bleak farmhouse and silo are the only features on a flat snow-swept landscape
Outside of Moorhead, Minnesota
They think it'll make her homesick
Boy
How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm once they seen Karl Hungus
He hands back the picture
She's been kidnapped, Da Fino
Or maybe not, but she's definitely not around
Fuck, man
That's terrible
Yeah, it sucks
Well maybe you and me could pool our resources--trade information-- professional courtesy--compeers, you know-- We hear distant yapping, growing louder with the hum of an approaching car
Yeah,  get it
Fuck off, Da Fino
And stay away from my special la-- from my fucking lady friend
The Dude steps out to meet Walter's car as it pulls up, its passenger window open and the pomeranian leaning out and yapping
' Four people sit at a booth:  Dieter, Kieffer, Franz, all in black leather, and a young woman with long stringy blonde hair, wearing torn and patched jeans and a ribbed sleeveless tee-shirt, worn thin with age
She is apparently braless, and is teutonically pale with birthmarks on her face and arms
Notable  is  her  camera-side  leg,  which  ends in  a bandage- swaddled foot
Dried rust-colored blood stains the tip of the bandage
The  four  are  arguing,  loudly,  in  German
They seem  very unhappy
waitress enters with a checkpad and pen
You folks ready
The German shouting stops
Dieter looks sourly up
haff lingenberry pancakes
Lingenberry pancakes
Sree picks in blanket
The woman speaks to Dieter in German
He nods
Lingenberry pancakes
' Walter's eyes are on the road as he listens, driving, to the Dude, whose speech is occasionally punctuated by yaps from the back seat
mean we totally fucked it up, man
We fucked up his pay-off
And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything
Huh
Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh
'm saying if he knows 'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife
Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man
He's had enough
He no longer digs her
It's all a show
But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks
mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back
What's your point, Dude
His million bucks was never in it, man
There was no money in that briefcase
He was hoping they'd kill her
You throw out a ringer for a ringer
Yeah
Shit yeah
Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency
Huh
'm saying,  see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which 'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death-- Walter, come off it
You're not even fucking Jewish, you're-- What the fuck are you talking about
You're fucking Polish Catholic-- What the fuck are you talking about
converted when  married Cynthia
Come on, Dude
Yeah, and you were-- You know this
And you were divorced five fucking years ago
Yeah
What do you think happens when you get divorced
You turn in your library card
Get a new driver's license
Stop being Jewish
This driveway
: 'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing
Taking care of her fucking dog
Going to her fucking synagogue
You're living in the fucking past
Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax-- ' --Jesus
What the hell happened
He is looking off as the car slows
The Dude looks where Walter is looking
Walter's car pulls up the drive into the foreground and he and the Dude get out
Both are gaping off at the front lawn
Jesus Christ
Tire treads lead across the manicured front lawn to where a little red sports car rests with its hood crumpled into a palm trunk
Through the French doors at its far end we can see Bunny, naked, briefly bouncing on the diving board before splashing into the illuminated pool outside
Heavy metal music filters in from a boom box by the pool
Brandt, approaching, stoops and straightens, stoops and straightens, picking up the discarded clothes that run the length of the hall
He can't see you, Dude
We pull the Dude and Walter as they approach the doors to the great study
Walter's dog follows, stiffly waving its tail
Where'd she been
Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs
Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us
But  guess she told Dieter
Jesus, Dude
He never even kidnapped her
Who's this gentleman, Dude
Who'm
'm a fucking
You shouldn't go in there, Dude
He's very angry
--the Dude and Walter push through the double doors into-- The big Lebowski turns at the sound of the door
His wheelchair hums as he spins it around
(bitterly) Well, she's back
No thanks to you
Where's the money, Lebowski
,
The dog yaps
Who the hell is he
'll tell you who  am
'm the guy who's gonna We know the briefcase was empty, man
We know you kept the million bucks yourself
Well, you have your story,  have mine
say  entrusted the money to you, and you stole it
You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear
All you needed was a sap to pin it on, and you'd just met me
You thought, hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone the square community won't give a shit about
Well
Aren't you
Well
yeah
All right, get out
Both of you
Look at that fucking phony, Dude
Pretending to be a fucking millionaire
said out
Now
Let me tell you something else
've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, and this guy is a fake
fucking goldbricker
He is crossing to Lebowski
This guy fucking walks
've never been more certain of anything in my life
Stay away from me, mister
Walter reaches around from behind and hoists the big Lebowski out of the wheelchair by his armpits
Walk, you fucking phony
The big Lebowski waggles helplessly, his rubbery feet grazing the floor like a Raggedy Ann's
The pomeranian gaily leaps and yaps
Put me down, you son of a bitch
Walter
It's all over, man
We call your fucking bluff
,  '
' Sure, 'll put him down, Dude
,
He shoves the big Lebowski forward and he crumples to the floor, weeping
Oh, shit
(sobbing) You're bullies
Cowards, both of you
Walter is abashed
The Big Lebowski flails about on the floor
Oh, shit
He can't walk, Walter
Yeah,  can see that, Dude
You monsters
Help me put him back in his chair
Walter moves to comply
Shit, sorry man
: Stay away from me
You bullies
You and these women
You won't leave a man his fucking balls
Walter, you fuck
Shit, Dude,  didn't know wouldn't've done it if  knew he was a fucking crybaby
We're sorry, man
We're really sorry
The Dude has picked up the Big Lebowski's plaid lap warmer and is frantically tucking it back in around his waist and batting the dog away
There ya go
Sorry man
Walter, puzzled, hands on hips, stands over the big Lebowski
Shit
He didn't look like a spinal
Scattered at the cut
Each with a beer at the scoring table
Sure you'll see some tank battles
But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle
Uh-huh
mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk
mean  had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank
Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball
Yeah
That's fuckin' combat
The man in the black pyjamas, Dude
Worthy fuckin' adversary
Who's in pyjamas, Walter
Shut the fuck up, Donny
Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank
This is not a worthy-- The Dude and Walter look
Quintana is bellowing from the lip of the lane, and is restrained by 'Brien
What's this "day of rest" shit, man
Walter looks at him innocently
What is this bullshit, man
don't fucking care
It don't matter to Jesus
But you're not fooling me
You might fool the fucks in the league office, but you don't fool Jesus
It's bush league psych-out stuff
Laughable, man
would've fucked you in the ass Saturday, 'll fuck you in the ass next Wednesday instead
He makes hip-grinding coital motions as 'Brien leads him away
You got a date Wednesday, man
Walter, his head cocked, and the Dude, peeking over his shades, watch him go
He's cracking
Donny, Walter and the Dude emerge from the alley, each holding his leatherette ball satchel
tree of life, Dude
To all who cling to it
They react to the droning synthesizer-based technopop coming from a boom box
Dieter, Kieffer and Franz, in shiny black leather, stand in a line facing them in the all-but-deserted lot
Behind them orange flames lick gently at the Dude's car, which has been put to the torch
The orange flames glow on the men's creaking leather
Next to the car are three motorcycles, parked in a neat row
The Dude looks sadly at the burning car
They finally did it
They killed my fucking car
Vee vant zat money, Lebowski
Ja, uzzervize vee kill ze girl
Ja, it seems you forgot our little deal, Lebowski
You don't have the fucking girl, dipshits
We know you never did
So you've got nothin' on my Johnson
The men in black, stunned, confer amongst themselves in German
Under his breath: Are these the Nazis, Walter
Walter answers, also sotto voce, his eyes still on the three men: They're nihilists, Donny, nothing to be afraid of
The Germans stop conferring
Vee don't care
Vee still vant zat money or vee fuck you up
Ja, vee still vant ze money
Vee sreaten you
He pulls an uzi from under his coat
It glints in the firelight
Fuck you
Fuck the three of you
Hey, cool it Walter
Walter ignores the Dude, addresses the Germans: There's no ransom if you don't have a fucking hostage
That's what ransom is
Those are the fucking rules
Zere  no
- - - -- His girlfriend gafe up her toe
She sought we'd be getting million dollars
Iss not fair
Fair
' , Hey, cool it Walter
Listen, pal, there never was any money
The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him
'
The Germans confer again, in German
Donny is visibly frightened
Are they gonna hurt us, Walter
'   : They won't hurt us, Donny
These men are cowards
: Okay
Vee take ze money you haf on you und vee call it eefen
Fuck you
The Dude is digging into his pocket
Come on, Walter, we're ending this thing cheap
Walter's eyes, burning with hatred, are locked on Dieter's
What's mine is mine
Come on, Walter
Louder, to the Germans, as he looks in his wallet: Four dollars here
He inspects the change in his palm
Almost five
(tremulously) got eighteen dollars, Dude
(grimly) What's mine is mine
With a ring of steel, Dieter produces a glinting saber
, (coolly) Come and get it
,
Come and get it
Fucking nihilist
Show me what you got
Nihilist
Dipshit with a nine-toed woman
In a rage, Dieter charges
hurls his leather satchel
Watching Dieter's charge, is caught off-guard
The bowling ball thuds into his chest and lifts him off his feet
He falls back, his uzi clattering away
twists away as Dieter reaches him; grabs Dieter's head in both hands; draws Dieter's head up to his mouth, which closes on Dieter's ear
He rushes Franz but draws up short as Franz sends out karate kicks, his leather pants squeaking and popping
Franz gives a loud cry with each kick; the Dude leans back, throwing his arms up, evading the kicks
His jaw is still clamped on Dieter's ear
Dieter draws his saber against Walter's side, drawing blood
Walter doesn't react to the wound
Growling as Dieter screams, he worries his ear, waggling his head with his jaws clamped
Dieter drops it
Awkwardly circling, evading Franz's kicks
still worrying the ear
With a tearing sound his head and Dieter's separate
, , : Walter spits his ear into his face
The Dude and Franz, both now panting heavily, have yet to establish body contact
Franz continues to kick
draws back his fist
-
Bam
-- powerhouse blow to the middle of his face drops Dieter for the count
With a piercing shriek Franz finally summons the nerve to charge the Dude, hands raised to deliver karate blows
As he reaches the Dude----the  boom box swings into frame to smash him in the face
Its volume shoots up
Walter bashes him a few more times over the head
The music screeches to static, then quiet
Laid out now, Franz too is quiet
All quiet
Walter, panting, looks around
We've got a man down, Dude
With a hand pressed to his bleeding side he trots over to Donny, who lies gasping on the ground
The Dude, also panting, rises and trots over
Hy God
They shot him, Walter
No Dude
They shot Donny
Donny gasps for air
His eyes, wide, go from the Dude to Walter
One hand still clutches his eighteen dollars
There weren't any shots
Then what's
It's a heart attack
Wha
Call the medics, Dude
Wha
Donny-- Hurry Dude
'd go but 'm pumping blood
Might pass out
The Dude runs into the lanes
Walter lays a reassuring hand on Donny's shoulder
Rest easy, good buddy, you're doing fine
We got help choppering in
--- They sit side by side, forearms on knees, in a nondescript waiting area
Walter bounces the fingertips of one hand off those of the other
They sit
They wait
tall thin man in a conservative black suit enters
He eyes the Dude's bowling attire and sunglasses and Walter's army surplus, but doesn't make an issue of it
Hello, gentlemen
You are the bereaved
Yeah man
Francis Donnelly
Pleased to meet you
Jeffrey Lebowski
Walter Sobchak
The Dude, actually
Is what, uh
Excuse me
Nothing
Yes
understand you're taking away the remains
Yeah
We have the urn
He nods through a door
Another man in a black suit enters to carefully deposit a large silver urn on the desktop
And  assume this is credit card
He is vaguely handing a large leather folder across the desk to whomever wants to take it
Yeah
He takes it, opens it, puts on reading glasses that sit halfway down his nose, and inspects the bill with his head pulled back for focus and cocked for concentration
Silence
The Dude smiles at Donnelly
Donnelly gives back a mortician's smile
At length Walter holds the bill towards Donnelly, pointing
What's this
That is for the urn
Don't need it
We're scattering the ashes
Yes, so we were informed
However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle
This is a hundred and eighty dollars
Yes sir
It is our most modestly priced receptacle
Well can we-- hundred and eighty dollars
They range up to three thousand
Yeah, but we're-- Can we just rent it from you
Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house
We're scattering the fucking ashes
Walter-- '  ' '
Sir, please lower your voice-- Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in
That is our most modestly priced receptacle
' -- It is a high, wind-swept bluff
Walter and the Dude walk towards the lip of the bluff
Parked in the background is one lonely car, Walter's
Walter is carrying a bright red coffee can with a blue plastic lid
When they reach the edge the two men stand awkwardly for a beat
Finally: 'll say a few words
The Dude clasps his hands in front of him
Walter clears his throat
Donny was a good bowler, and a good man
He was
He was one of us
He was a man who loved the outdoors, and bowling, and as a surfer explored the beaches of southern California from Redondo to Calabassos
And he was an avid bowler
And a good friend
He died--he died as so many of his generation, before his time
In your wisdom you took him, Lord
As you took so many bright flowering young men, at Khe San and Lan Doc and Hill 364
These young men gave their lives
And Donny too
Donny who
who loved bowling
Walter clears his throat
And so, Theodore--Donald--Karabotsos, in accordance with what we think your dying wishes might well have been, we commit your mortal remains to the bosom of
Walter is peeling the plastic lid off the coffee can
the Pacific Ocean, which you loved so well
: Goodnight, sweet prince
The wind has blown all of the ashes into the Dude, standing just to the side of and behind Walter
The Dude stands, frozen
Finished eulogizing, Walter looks back
Shit, 'm sorry Dude
He starts brushing off the Dude with his hands
Goddamn wind
Heretofore motionless, the Dude finally explodes, slapping Walter's hands away
Goddamnit Walter
You fucking asshole
Dude
Dude, 'm sorry
The Dude is near tears
You make everything a fucking travesty
Dude, 'm--it was an accident
The Dude gives Walter a furious shove
What about that shit about Vietnam
Dude, 'm sorry-- What the fuck does Vietnam have to do with anything
What the fuck were you talking about
Walter for the first time is genuinely distressed, almost lost
Shit Dude, 'm sorry-- You're a fuck, Walter
He gives Walter a weaker shove
Walter seems dazed, then wraps his arms around the Dude
Awww, fuck it Dude
Let's go bowling
We watch each of them glide across the floor, release, follow through--gracefully
We have never seen them bowl before
They are quite good
Each wears a black armband on his bowling shirt
The Dude walks up to the bar
Two oat sodas, Gary
Right
Good luck tomorrow
Thanks, man
Sorry to hear about Donny
Yeah
Well, you know, sometimes you eat the bear, and, uh
"Tumbling Tumbleweeds" has come up on the jukebox, and The Stranger ambles up to the bar
Howdy do, Dude
Oh, hey man, how are ya
wondered if 'd see you again
Wouldn't miss the semis
How things been goin'
Ahh, you know
Strikes and gutters, ups and downs
The Stranger's eyes crinkle merrily
Sure,  gotcha
The bartender has put two gleaming beers on the counter
Thanks, Gary
Take care, man, gotta get back
Sure
Take it easy, Dude-- know that you will
, , : Yeah man
Well, you know, the Dude abides
Gazing after him, The Stranger drawls, savoring the words: The Dude abides
He gives his head a shake of appreciation, then looks into the camera
don't know about you, but  take comfort in that
It's good knowin' he's out there, the Dude, takin' her easy for all us sinners
Shoosh sure hope he makes The finals
Welp, that about does her, wraps her all up
Things seem to've worked out pretty good for the Dude'n Walter, and it was a purt good story, dontcha think
Made me laugh to beat the band
Parts, anyway
Course-- didn't like seein' Donny go
But then, happen to know that there's a little Lebowski on the way
guess that's the way the whole durned human comedy keeps perpetuatin' it-self, down through the generations, westward the wagons, across the sands a time until-- aw, look at me, 'm ramblin' again
Wal, uh hope you folks enjoyed yourselves
He brushes his hat brim with a fingertip as we begin to pull back
Catch ya further on down the trail
As we pull away The Stranger swivels in to the bar
As his voice fades: Say friend, ya got any more a that good sarsaparilla
