Some are boarded up
Not all the street lights work
Those that do cast shadows of parked vehicles glistening in the rain

He hears something and looks up to see four big horses pulling a hulking great wagon down the middle of the street
The wagon is a gigantic windowless box
The horses are harnessed and there are reins but no sign of a driver
It's a very weird sight

We now see what they see
The wagon has been converted into a stage
We're looking at an old fashioned and very shabby travelling theatre
Electric footlights are powered by a clanking generator
The pediment above the stage carries the words:
, a dwarf, dressed as a medieval demon and rigged out as a one-man band plays a fanfare introducing a young man (, 18-19 years old) who emerges from the back of the stage dressed as , the messenger of the gods, with wings on his helmet and sandals

(He's sitting on a glass plinth)
is seemingly in a trance
bronze tripod containing burning incense stands beside him

Let him guide and transport you to worlds and possibilities you never dreamt of
If you dare
But
Beware
there are dangers
You will have to choose
Will your soul fly
Or will it be dashed on the rocks of darkness
The choice is yours and yours alone
Transcend the heights on Beauty's wing
young woman, ,(wearing a wig of long blonde hair and a white, flowing costume which gives her prominent hips and breasts) stands facing an elaborately framed full-length mirror nestled upstage amongst cut-out trees representing a forest

lunges at `Beauty' who retreats up stage
blunders into the scenery as he pursues `Beauty' who stays just out of reach
She takes cover behind a cut-out tree
and  climb back onto the stage as  continues to chase `Beauty'
evades him by ducking through the mirror (made of flexible reflective material slit down the middle)
crashes after her
and  exchange worried looks
They look at Should they wake him from his trance
They decide not to but it's a difficult decision

`Beauty' weaves in and out of the 2 dimensional trees as chases her further into the increasingly magical forest
Beauty's costume has been transformed into something wonderful

He doubles up
pauses for a moment, contemplating doing some serious damage, before striding off
staggers to his feet

You bitch
He rushes after her but, trips on a root (a real 3 dimensional tree root) and pitches face first to the ground
Recovering, he looks up
Shock
He is surrounded by a dark, terrible, and very  forest
`Beauty' has vanished
6                                                 6 , `Beauty', slips back on stage through the mirror
Her costume has reverted to its original state
She examines her knuckles on the hand with which she punched Martin

She shrugs

`Beauty' sighs
She's had enough

His voice echoes through the giant trees
But his cries are interrupted by another sound
a Tarzan-like howl
spins around
Strange creatures are swinging on vines through the giant trees
They are all around him
They look like
with little heads and arms where the wrists should be
They are all howling and jabbering
From behind, a   swings down and grabs  by the collar, hoisting him high into the air
Clearing the trees,  sees he is not alone
There are many other people - all in the clutches of swinging on "vines"

7   :                                                     7 But, the "vines" are actually long, slim tentacles
dangling from enormous, luridly coloured  that float through the dark, frightening, sky
From some of the tentacles, bottles of booze dangle - just out of reach of the struggling crowd - all desperate for a drink
(') Please
'll never
Never again
Honest
From now on swear
Not a drop
With a smile of satisfaction, the   stops jabbering and let's go of ' collar
Down he plummets
The ground rushes up
is as good as dead
But when he hits the ground, rather than going , he bounces high in the air, turns a couple somersaults and lands on his feet
He can't believe what has just happened
and then he hears music
Beautiful, ethereal music
In the distance a light is glowing
It's the sun, rising above a majestic mountain pass
Cut into the rock, is a long stairway winding up to the summit
The   swings down, gives  the "thumbs up", and points encouragingly toward the stairway
Reformed and determined,  heads for the      stairs
But on reaching them he discovers that each one is 6      feet high
The stairway is ridiculously steep and difficult
Letters are carved into the first stair
" 12X12 "
This is going to be tough
The sound of a honky-tonk piano makes him turn
Behind him the sky is dark
roadside bar/nightclub with flashing neon lights has appeared
He hesitates
He could use a drink before the long climb
He heads for the club
The door to the club is opened by a mechanical fairground figure of a jolly smiling man ( ) distinguished by a bowler hat and a red waistcoat
Hi there
'mon in
Looks like you could use a drink

pulls back as the nightclub suddenly 8                                               8 The sound of police sirens
We are back outside in front of the theatre
rises unsteadily, coming out of his arduous trance
`Beauty" moves to support him as, exhausted, he loses his balance and snaps out of his trance

Not to be missed
On stage is  , `levitating' and in a trance, as before
Incense smoke swirls around him

Envisage the sublime
Let Doctor Parnassus be your guide
Discover the heights of Wisdom

(') Or, if you will, visit the doldrums with all that's vile and stinks

(indicating ticket machine) Take a ticket and wait your turn
Twenty quid a go, reduced to five for one night only
The world is full of wonders, beauty, enchantment, for those with eyes to see
He magically produces a bouquet of flowers
Throws it into the air
it transforms into beautiful doves
This impressive trick is totally ignored by a group loudly arguing just in front of the stage -

Where's Diego

She starts to go after him, then hesitates
(trying to get ' attention) Pssst
looks across the stage to her
She mimes that a certain someone has gone into the mirror
considers waking but thinks better of it
Instead he heads off upstage and through the mirror in pursuit of Diego
takes over the pitch

The world has gone dark
He hears  crying somewhere in the distance and starts to clamber over the shattered monoliths
Reaching the top,  sees  on the peak of a distant rocky pinnacle surrounded by bottomless chasms
There are what appear to be two suspension bridges spanning the void on either side of the pinnacle
who is in a state of confusion and terror
Is he lost inside a video game he can't control
He presses the buttons on his gaming device - to no avail
One of the bridges leads to a bluff where war games are under way
all very video-game-like
Thrilling aggressive music blares forth
appears, still in red waist-coat and bowler hat, but this time in the form of a - shooting target with a bull's-eye on his chest

As he speaks bullets fly
Each time
gets shot and is knocked flat, he pops back up continuing his spiel
The other bridge appears to be made of black and white piano keys and looks very rickety and unsafe
The piano key bridge descends into a great cavern where hundreds of are practising on hundreds of pianos, all playing the same tune - the tune
is humming, but with stern, demanding,   in attendance

Attaboy, sonny
Join the men

Hup two, hup two
He hesitates
the music from the pianos seems to have an effect on him
He comes to a decision
He drops his gaming device then very hesitantly steps onto the extremely wobbly piano keys
The - shooting target   isn't happy
(') No, wait
That's the wrong choice
That bridge leads to failure and despair
You'll be dead before you're thirty
This is the one
This is the bridge to manhood

For a moment we think he might change his mind, but he presses bravely on across the piano bridge

This man's drunk
Dead drunk
Disgraceful

Thanks to you we can afford to buy Valentina a b- birthday cake

He used to run a big charity wouldn't trust him
But then

For God's sake
Tell me what you want

That's so strange

Valentina sees good in him
She'd be better off with Anton

It works

the right public
and in a better part of town

full of the troupe's savings

Sitting on top is Percy playing something ethnic but tasteful on a flute with one hand
his other is held out pathetically
a beggar
He's blacked up and dressed in rags
He doesn't look happy
He sneaks nervous glances at the glass box of money

New signs proclaim `The Choice Is Yours' `The Imaginarium - More Exclusive than ever'
The stage, hung with soft,flowing, gauzy fabric, has been chromatically divided in half - one side black, the other white

dressed as a stylized doctor with head reflector
In his hand is a staff with an elaborate sun on the top
He is blindfolded
On the white side of the stage stands the mirror and a stylized Tree of Knowledge with bright red apples
Under the tree, and reflected in the mirror, sits  as Eve
naked except for a long wig that maintains her modesty
She gracefully combs her hair
Above the mirror is a sign proclaiming "The Naked Truth"

Nobody speaks
They pay no attention to the crowd
few women stop, curious
One of them takes out some money and puts it in the glass plinth and turns to go
(retrieving the money) Excuse me, madam
'm afraid we can't accept this
The woman stops, confused
Tony hands her back her money
(') We are here to give
not take
We are here to help those in need
If it's money you need, then here it is

Excuse me but, how does this work
What does it cost

This is a refuge for hearts in need of truth
place for souls to be purified
2 How long does that take
'm running late
Madam, why should you care about time
What are your dreams worth in minutes
The women grow pensive
(') There are hard choices to be made in life
(he indicates the tableaux) What about the dreams of the less fortunate in the world
Do you have time for their dreams
Or are you like  once was
do you just despair
Despair at all that is wrong in the world
(getting to his feet) despair at your inability to do anything to change it
to make it better
despaired so much at the powerlessness of my own existence that  took the easy way out
the coward's way
committed suicide
Yes, that's right,  killed myself
Can you understand my despair
But was saved
saved by a miracle

and Doctor Parnassus
He brought me back from the dead
He gave me a new life
reason to live
He has given me power to dream again
to dream of a better world
During his speech, more and more people have gathered
Some are actually weeping
They are press forward putting money in the plinth
Tony tries to stop them but, they insist

are astonished by ' performance

The    looks around as a couple of arrive on the scene

Madam, congratulations, you have been chosen
The other  gasp

Come forward and enter the Imaginarium
But,  haven't paid

We want your hopes and dreams
You may make a donation later, if you wish
But
This is a rare moment
Very few are chosen
Don't miss this once-in-a- life-time opportunity
This way
Please
He ushers the uneasy    onto the stage and guides her upstage
goes into his trance
(') Believe me Madam, you're the luckiest woman in the world
The    steps into the mirror hesitates
a moment of uncertainty
encourages him with a smile
He steps through
Across the street a clock begins striking the hour
the two   who start to move the crowd and show on
Alright,  think it's time to move on, folks
But on spotting the naked  who winks at them, they agree between themselves to give the show a bit longer
54   /                                           54 and     are astonished to find themselves in the romantic, soft-focus, pastel-colour setting of a soothing, sophisticated, shampoo commercial
Soft fabrics waft, cleansing waterfalls cascade, rose-petals float through the air, beautiful girls swing from swings attached to clouds - all in delicious slow motion
(overcome) Oh
how gorgeous

He smiles and, with an effort, puts his arm around ' wide waist
He looks into her eyes
She's in love

What bliss
and  don't even know your name
Tony
Tony
How dashing
bar or two of tango encourages them to take a couple of intimate tango dance steps
Now gently wafting curtains part to reveal
down a flower strewn path and over a bridge
a sleazy motel with a shingle over the door reads: "The One Night Stand Motel"
In the office window sits (') Oh, goodness me
She bats her eyelashes at  and begins, knowingly, to pull him towards the motel
(resisting) If 'm not wrong,  fear you must go alone
pouts playfully, pulling him onwards
Why would  want to go without you darling
It's one of the rules
One imagination at a time, free from the influence of another

Stairs descend to a stream
Oh
look
another possibility
Below them a gondola rests in the stream as small, flower bedecked barques float past with framed pictures of romantic heroes who died young; Keats, Shelly, Byron, James Dean, Rudolph Valentino, Marilyn Monroe, Buddy Holly, Princess Diana
the stream continues off into the distance to a dark, towering Egyptian pyramid
is as bemused as
(') You must make a choice
and
actually, to be honest, 'd strongly recommend this one
But
Rudolph Valentino, James Dean, Princess Di
all these people
they're dead
(thinking fast) Exactly
To be reborn, first you must die
All of them have achieved a kind of immortality
And we love them all the more for it
They won't get old or fat
They won't get sick or feeble
They are beyond fear
They are forever young
They are gods
And you can join them
(softening) You're such a wonderful speaker
The gondola awaits
with a beautiful male model at the helm
smiles at him
There's not a moment to lose
But as she hesitates a dark shadow rises over them
, looking past the " shoulder, sees the dark waters of the stream rise up transforming into a that towers menacingly over them
It's wearing a and it's angry

You have to let go of all these worldly goods
He helps     remove her necklace, earrings, bracelets, rings, broach, in double quick time and guides her onto the gondola, blowing a kiss after her
(') Remember nothing is permanent
not even death
He turns back to see the    shrinking back below the bridge, transforming itself back into the waters of the stream
From under the arch of the bridge hangs a rope
At its end
a hangman's noose
stares at it darkly disconcerted

55 re-enters the stage through the mirror, looking at
who has just come out of his trance with astonishment (gobsmacked) That was so
had no idea
It's just
incredible
And then he realizes the clock is still striking the hour realizing that only a few moments have passed since he entered the mirror
(') how do you do this
(ignoring him and with a big theatrical gesture) Hooplah
The   woman reappears, sitting on a cut-out cloud descending from the ceiling of the stage
She looks radiant
She is weeping, completely overcome by her experience
steps forward and helps her to her feet
She kisses his hands in gratitude

55   :                                                  55 Thank you, thank you, that was so beautiful,  feel so
thank you so much

The crowd is still
stunned by the   's transformation as she deposits the cheque, her handbag, her expensive coat in the glass box and glides benignly through the crowd
which parts in awe
Pause
and then the other  rush the stage
Mayhem is narrowly averted as  and  manage to coral them into a more-or-less orderly queue
Across the street, standing in the doorway of a shop selling luxury goods, is
He watches events, intrigued
as  escorts a second woman through the mirror, and a third, they descend, ecstatic, emptying the contents of their handbags, their pearls, earrings and diamond rings into the glass box

And now a fourth woman descends

The leading pulls him on

They start pushing through the crowd
, reaching down to help an elderly lady up to the stage, looks up and sees the  heading through the crowd
Panic
He pulls the mask down and begins to back up
But it's too late, they've definitely seen him
He spins around and rockets upstage, past
who is deep into his trance
dives through the mirror much to the amazement of , ,
The  chase after him, shoving the queuing aside, smashing the scenery and knocking  into the wings
56   /                         56 The  charge through the shampoo-commercial landscape
No
Just slo-mo fashion models and soft wafting fabrics and aromatic breezes

( ) You tell me
It can't be him
He's dead
We killed him

In the distance,  is hiding behind some billowing fabric
On being spotted, he takes off up a hill
The  race toward the hill only to crash into a solid wall - painted as a landscape with  frozen in mid stride
Looking off to their right they see Tony heading up another hill
But as they rush in that direction another wall rises up blocking them
Again it is painted with a hill and frozen in midstride
third and fourth wall rise up
surrounding and trapping the
There is a cell door in one wall
Like crazy animals they start throwing themselves against the door trying to break it down
It won't budge
While the others batter the door, , who has been somewhat affected by the soft shampoo commercial world, sits quietly in a corner picking pretty flowers
Exhausted, the other  collapse on the ground
gently breathes in the aroma of the flowers and exhales
As he does the door swings open
The other gape at him
then barrel out the door
Outside is a new, beautiful, landscape - the sky dotted with white fluffy clouds
Extending from the ground to each cloud is an incredibly long ladder
On each ladder is a person climbing upwards
The  spot Tony
He is already a hundred feet up a ladder and climbing
Unfortunately, their way is blocked by an over-bright, hyper- active, wide-eyed sales girl

Seeing the threat,  kicks hard and breaks the rungs below him
setting off a domino effect with more rungs breaking downward towards the
Snap
Crack
Rungs break in their grasp
they fall
The  land in a tangled heap as the domino effect continues down to the base of the ladder
Laughing down at them,  turns to continue climbing - only to see the domino effect heading down from the top of the ladder
towards him
Tony struggles to maintain his balance - and somehow manages to get his feet on the two halves of a broken rung
Then, as if he were on giant stilts, starts to stride away
The  chase after him but, his giant strides leave them far behind
Smugly,  looks back just as one of the legs of his ladder snags on a fallen log
He loses his balance
and plunges hundreds of feet earthward
From nowhere,  (still dressed as a fat woman) appears
running to catch the plummeting
He does and Whomp

Knocked out cold

But, the  arrive, grab , start to beat him up

Foolishly, he whips off his wig and assumes a manly martial arts pose
The  look at each other
Then, utterly ignoring , turn their attention back to beating
walks calmly over to  who is in attack mode
(bending down and picking a flower, he offers it to ) Relax
Smell the flowers
Confused,  takes the flower, sniffs and then floors him with a powerful punch on the nose Meanwhile, the  have a noose around 's neck and have looped the rope over a tree branch
struggles to pull out the metal pipe he keeps on a string around his neck
He gets it to his mouth as if to swallow it when
the ground erupts and a giant London policeman's helmet rises up (we are talking 20 feet tall)and revolves - revealing
' carved and painted face beneath
The mouth drops open and a great red tongue rolls out like a welcoming red carpet
From inside the giant mouth a smiling policeman beckons the  to come on in
The terrified  let go of the lynching rope
drops to the ground and, with a whistle, the brass pipe flies out of his mouth
Behind the  a painted backdrop unfurls
it reads "

and a chorus line of -  in mini-skirted police outfits appear - high-kicking a snappy song and dance number
The astonished  don't know what the fuck is going on
Suddenly, a friendly  '  is heard shouting something in Russian
Spinning around, the  see an old  (Russian grandmother) outside a tumble-down cottage waving gaily to them

Then, pell-mell, they rush to her

As they run toward her they get smaller and smaller
She lifts her skirts and all four disappear underneath
And then
a muffled explosion balloons the skirts outward
Smoke spews out from below
Straightening her skirt, the  looks up, and pulls off her head - revealing
's tiny head poking out of the collar
He smiles smugly
The giant
registers disappointment and, like a balloon rapidly deflating, spins off into the sky sending up a cloud of dust obscuring everything
The dust clears and  and  find themselves in a desolate, empty landscape
Nowhere
Nothing
Did you see me
almost reached the clouds

it was incredible
was almost there
Shut up
Over a distant rise the wagon appears, pulled by the horses
drags Tony, babbling and stumbling, towards it

have to have another chance
another go need this
57         -                  57 The wagon is parked on waste ground

He seems utterly destroyed
You're a l-liar
You've been lying to us all along
Who are you
Who were those thugs

Why not
Because they're irredeemably bad people, and 'm essentially good know that sounds terribly prim and arrogant and self righteous, but 'm trying to be honest
Look, the truth is
in order to get my charity off the ground  needed capital
looks askance
(') (in response to Anton) Yes,  know, and you're right, but that's the way the grown-up
the real world works
You can't make omelettes without soiling your hands
Or should that be the other way round
Anyway,  - with hindsight very foolishly - accepted a loan from people who seemed to me, at the time, to be very decent and sincere
There was absolutely no way  could have known that they were part of a ruthless organised crime syndicate and that they wanted to use my charity to launder money
made a mistake
And  have to live with that
'm sorry
What more can  say

"Again
" is what they said
What
(answering his own question) The first time they hung you from the b-bridge
right
-because you stole their money
Stop saying that
didn't steal it
