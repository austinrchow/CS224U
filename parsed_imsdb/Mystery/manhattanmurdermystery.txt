Screenplay by Woody Allen & Marshall Brickman Most of the sequences in this production are filmed using a hand- held camera or a Steadycam
These very mobile cameras move around the set, and get constantly closer and further from the characters
Still, we'll be using the usual technical terms, such as long shot or full shot or medium shot here and there to give the reader an idea of the location of the camera at the beginning of each sequence
And then we'll mention the movements of the camera
Winged white horse flying over clouds We hear jazz music during the credits
- -   - While the camera is flying over New-York, we keep on hearing the jazz music
The camera reaches a round building that looks like a stadium and starts moving around the building
- Long shot on the skating rink
hockey game is in progress on the rink
The camera follows a player, and then pans on the audience
The camera stops on a medium shot of Larry and Carol, a couple in their early fifties
Larry seems fascinated by the game, but Carol seems to find it boring
She looks at the ceiling, and then puts her hand over her mouth to suppress a yawn
Larry turns toward her
Come on
What
You promised to sit through the entire hockey game without being bored and 'll sit through the Wagner opera with you next week
know, honey,  promised
know
already bought the earplugs
Yeah
Well, with your eyesight, 'm surprised you can see the puck
The crowd starts yelling and we guess that one of the players has done something really good
Carol mockingly claps her hands
Yay, hooray
Then she raises her eyes to the ceiling, seeming more bored than ever
'  -  - nice-looking apartment building in New-York
Full shot of the lobby
We see the street through the glass door
An uniformed attendant is standing near a counter, on which he is writing on a book
Larry and Carol are coming from the street and entering the building
He is carrying some shopping bags, and she is reading a newspaper, the Daily News
God
can't wait to get into bed and stretch out
Yeah
The attendant slightly turns around and bows to them
They bow back to him
He goes back to his book-keeping, and the couple keeps on walking through the lobby
You know, there's a Bob Hope movie on television later
know
Can you believe this guy in Indiana
Killed twelve victims, dismembered them and ate them
Really
Well, it's an alternative lifestyle
Yeah, 'll say
They reach the two elevators
Larry presses the call-button on the wall between the two elevators
'  -  - Medium shot inside the cabin of the elevator
The inner door slides open
Carol enters first, still reading her newspaper
Larry enters behind her and presses a button on the control panel
(voice over) Hold the elevator
(voice over) 'm coming
Hearing people's voices, Larry puts his hand on the edge of the door to keep it from closing
(voice over) Hold the elevator
Paul and Lilian enter the elevator
They are a middle-aged couple
He is bald and tall, and very smily
She is small, with grey hair
That's right
Thank you
Lilian has a broad smile when she recognizes Larry and Carol
The elevator door slides shut
Lilian looks at Carol
, uh,  see you at the gym sometimes
Oh, you do
Yeah, we live in the apartment down the hall
Oh, well,  go whenever  have the discipline
It's important to put that time in
It does wonders
Oh god, yeah
agree with you
Exercising changed my life
Well, geez
prefer to atrophy
'm not a very exercise person
We bought a treadmill last week
Oh, well, we had one
But you know, we got rid of it because it was just taking up too much space
Oh, it-it-it
Because you have to turn it on and get on it once in a while
That was her problem
Hey,
exactly,
and it's so confusing, with all those buttons and computerized programs
'm just never gonna get that
'  -  - Full shot of a very sober and modern hallway
Creme-colored walls, grey carpeting, dark wooden doors
We hear the elevator door opening and Carol comes out, followed by Lilian, Larry and Paul
They all talk together and we can hardly understand the following dialogue
Oh,  know
It's late
It's so wonderful, meeting
Oh, well, yeah
It is just like New York
You have neighbors
You never meet them
You guys
The following line, said by Lilian, is clearer and we understand it better
've seen you so many times in the hallway, you know
and 've always wanted to come up and say hallo
Well, anyway
good night
Larry and Carol walk away from Lilian and Paul, who remain near the elevator
(voice over) Good night
Such a lovely couple
You know that
Paul bends down to pick up something on the carpet
Lilian walks one step in Larry's direction
Oh, uh, say, hello
Paul starts opening his apartment door, just across the hallway from the elevator
(voice over) Huh
Yeah
Huh, listen
why don't you come in for a-a-a second and have a drink with us
mean, we'd really love that
The camera pans around toward Larry and Carol
Larry makes a negative sign with his hand
Oh, oh well that'd be fine
(voice over) She makes great Irish coffee
Mute conversation between Carol and Larry
Larry evidently doesn't want to accept Lilian's invitation, but Carol wants to
(voice over) Oh, please
Uh uh,  want you to give me a treadmill lesson
There's a movie on television  want to watch
Carol starts walking toward Lilian and Paul's apartment, followed reluctantly by Larry
The camera pans around during Carol's next line, and we see Carol entering Lilian an Paul's apartment
Oh, about the tread
oh, well, if  can figure it out, then believe me, anybody can
She laughs, and Larry, entering the apartment behind her, utters a forced laugh
'  -  - The cosy apartment of middle upper-class people
The decoration looks like them
Medium shot of Lilian walking across the bedroom toward the large double bed
She walks near the famous treadmill
Have a look at the instructions
They drive me crazy
You know
don't know what 'm doing at all
Let's look
(voice over) No
Please, it's easy
Lilian picks up a book on a table near the bed
Wonderful book they've given me
Now 'm at level five
(voice over) What
That  know
(voice over) You're that advanced
Well, yeah
(voice over) God,  only got to level two
Lilian brings the book to Carol
Look at these diagrams
Do you believe this
That's amazing
She is standing near the treadmill
Lilian shows her one of the diagram in the book
can't understand this even
Let me see
Yeah, well
See this
Okay
'  -   - One of the wall could be a bay window, but, for the moment, it is entirely covered by a beige drape
Medium shot of Paul bringing a stamp book to Larry
Now, let me show you a mint 1933 airmail
Very rare
and very beautiful
Larry is seated near a small table, on which Paul puts the book down
Paul sits down next to Larry
Yeah
Paul picks up a special philatelist magnifying glass and puts it in front of the stamp, for Larry to have a better look at it
Look at that
And this plate block is quite unique because it has a flaw in the engraving
See if you can see it
Larry, who is not interested in philately at all, scratches his head
Uh, it's hard for me
Actually 'll give you a little hint
Right down here in the corner
That tiny thing there
Interesting, yeah
Ah, you have a really
That makes it quite valuable, you see
And  just got a commemorative set of issues that are going to be quite valuable, too
He picks up a transparent envelope inside which are several stamps
Yes
Look at the color, right there
All these are gonna become a real f
Larry stands up
Well, listen
we're probably keeping you up, right
Oh, no-no-no
This is wonderful
should be going
What do you do, if  may ask
Me
'm in book publishing
work up at Harper's
Are you really
Yeah
own an old, uh, cinema
Having it redone
Oh
Used to have a string of three, but, you know, business is not what it used to be
He picks up some more stamps from the table
Now, look at these presidentials
Look at the color work
Even the perforations are still intact
Where's Carol
All the
Because  should really be going, actually
Oh, really
Yeah
mean, so, we
In the background, behind Larry, we see Carol and Lilian entering the room
Coffee's ready
Oh, coffee
forgot coffee
He turns around to face the women
(voice over) Good
We can get back to this later
Come on in
We see Paul's hand on Larry's shoulder, pushing him toward the centre of the room
little later
Full shot of the room
They are all seated around a low table, Larry and Carol on the sofa, Paul and Lilian on two armchairs
They've just finished their coffee
Well, we've never had any children, but it's easy to empathize
Oh, um, uh, what college does your son attend
Brown
Oh
Nice color
They all laugh
Paul never attended college
He's self-made
Always regretted it
think knowledge is the second most important thing
First is health, then knowledge, then money
Larry puts his cup down on the low table
You know, it's amazing how time, we,
we'll just
And, do you work
Larry stands up
Huh
Do
Yes
Larry looks at Carol and sits back on the sofa
Oh, well,  actually, um,  used to work at an ad agency, but that was many years ago
The camera moves closer to Carol and Larry
But
You know, 've been seriously thinking of starting a little restaurant
But, well, Larry, he's trying to talk me out of it
Oh, she's a great cook, though, really
Her duck and fennel omelette on a bed of scallops and Hollandaise sauce with truffles and sweetbreads'll make you snap into a fetal position and have you in bed screaming for a month
He loves to tease me, but actually, he really loves exotic food
My weakness is any rich dessert, cream, butter, anything with fat
Oh, really
Oh well, let
listen
'll fix you a dessert that'll make your eyeballs roll up
You'll have to exercise for a month to work it off
Yeah
(voice over) We're going to Le Cirque for our anniversary
No, really
The camera moves around, away from Larry and Carol, to Paul
(voice over) Yes
Twenty-eight years
November
(voice over) Really
Well, what do you buy the woman who buys everything
The camera moves around backward, away from Paul and back to Larry and Carol
We already have twin cemetery plots
Well, it's
always think a Bentley is in good taste
You know, or you can go the route that  went with her
On her twentieth,  got her some very lovely handkerchiefs
Yeah
Oh no
But, you know, they had my initials on them
Yeah, it was a very, very high-class item
didn't even know her size
'm going over
Carol bursts out laughing
Black screen
Actually, we are in : '  -   - Carol and Larry's apartment is quite different from the one we've just left
It is the apartment of a couple of New-York intellectuals, with nice, artistic furniture
We hear a door opening
Jesus, couldn't you keep the conversation going a little longer in there
Lights are switched on
Full shot
We see only part of the hall, the camera being in a corridor, and the walls of the corridor concealing part of the hall
Carol enters the apartment, and Larry holds the door for her
was signaling you frantically
Larry closes the door
was just trying to be neighborly
Neighborly
If this guy showed me his stamp collection one more time
mean, my favorite thing in life is to, you know, look at canceled postage
The camera follows Larry walking in the corridor toward : '  -  - Actually there are two large beds in the bedroom, the room being divided by a partition set between the two beds
The partition is only a half wall
There is a opening, without door, at each end of the partition, to go from one section of the room to the other
(voice over) Oh, come on, Larry
It was sweet
They, you know, they're looking forward to their anniversary
Medium shot of Larry taking his jacket off
He puts it on a chair
Oh, and 'm looking forward to seeing that Bob Hope movie
don't know why they put it on so late
The camera turns back to the corridor and Carol, still in the front hall
You know, do you think that's gonna happen to us
(voice over) What
Carol walks in the corridor, toward the bedroom
Well, that we'll become like them
You know, just another dull aging couple, you know, with our little walks, you know
She walks into the bedroom
(voice over) We are a dull aging couple
Our , our lox and bagels
And
and our twin cemetery plots
Larry is seated on his bed
Carol looks at some pills bottles on the night table
No, we should be as lucky as them
To, you know, to be in their physical shape, at their age
They look great
Did you see the dumbbells this guy lifts
If  lifted dumbbells like those,  would get a hernia the size of the San Andrea's Fault
How often do you think they make love
She goes out of the main part of the room, and the camera follows her
She sits down on the other bed and starts taking her shoes off
(voice over) Oh, you know, probably more than we do, in their shape
You know, 'm sure as much as once a week
Larry
(voice over) 'm exhausted
What
Do you still find me attractive
(voice over) Of course
What kind of question is that
Of course  do
Carol stands up from the bed and moves across the room
The camera, still located in the main part of the room, follows Carol, so we don't actually see her walking, but we see the partition and the large clock on it
(voice over from behind the partition) Yeah, but we're not turning into a pair of comfortable old shoes, are we
Do you think
Carol reappears on the other side of the partition
(voice over) Never comfortable
No
Larry's head appears in the forefront of the shot
He is still seated on the bed
don't think you have to worry about that
- Long shot on a large outdoor antique market place in New-York
The camera pans along the stands in the market, showing sellers and customers
(voice over) How you guys doing
(voice over) We're fine
(voice over) We're good
(voice over) We like that
We're gonna get this one
(voice over) That's very nice, actually
(voice over) So, actually
(voice over) Listen, are we going to see you at Elaine's Thursday
(voice over) Oh, no
Thursday's our Wagner opera
Medium shot on a stand around which Larry, Carol, Sy and Marilyn are standing
Sy and Marilyn are a couple about the same age as Carol and Larry
Uh
hum
You know
Ted's coming to Elaine's with us
Ted
Yeah
How is Ted
He's
he seems to be doing well
mean,
actually think he's glad
think he's glad he's divorced
Well,  don't think he's
no, he's not doing
Come on, he's not doing well at all
He's not used to it
Well he looks
think he looks, you know, like he's glad
Sy looks at some of the antique displayed on the stand
Yeah, yeah
This
So what do you want to do
you guys gonna browse, or
No, we're gonna go to a movie
Yeah, we're gonna go see Double indemnity
Oh, really
Yeah
Why don't you come with us
It starts in a little while
- Full shot of the screen of the theater, on which the film Double Indemnity is shown
And under the screen, in the dark, the back of some of the spectator's heads
This film is a very famous 1944 film directed by Billy Wilder, and referred by the Library of Congress as one of the hundred best films of the Twentieth Century
The term double indemnity refers to a clause in certain life insurance policies that doubles the payout in cases when death is caused by certain accidental means
(played by Edward
Robinson) 'd have the police after her so fast, it'd make her head spin
They'd put her through the wringer
And brother, the things they would squeeze out
(played by Fred MacMurray) They haven't got a single thing to go on, Keyes
Oh, not too much,  guess
Just twenty-six year experience
All the percentage there is, and this hunk of concrete in my stomach
The third character in the sequence, Phyliss Dietrichson, played by Barbara Stanwyck, is half-hiding behind a wall
- - '   - Full shot of the street, where Larry's apartment building is located
The camera is set near the entrance of the building, and Carol and Larry are walking toward us
God, that movie was great, wasn't it
Yeah,
it was one of my favorites
loved it
It just
they were all so wonderful, in the picture
You know, who could we fix Ted up with
mean, there must be somebody in your office
Ted
Yeah
Well,  don't know
Ted
always thought Ted had a crush on you
Me
She laughs
They have reached their building
The camera turns around to follows them inside the building
Larry puts his hand on Carol's back to guide her inside the building
We see an ambulance revolving light reflected in the glass door of the building
Yeah
Why are you so stunned
think that
Please
mean, you know,  adore him, but you know, he's like a girlfriend to me
Uh
Now he's divorced, you know
Do  detect a note of jealousy
The camera is still on the sidewalk near the entrance of the building and we see Carol and Larry walking toward the elevators
'  -  - short black screen, which actually is just a close shot on the outer door of the elevator
This door slides open, and we get a medium shot of Larry and Carol inside the elevator
They seem surprised by what they see on the landing
There is a gathering of neighbors, which we don't yet see
But we hear their voices
(voice over) had to come up here and call nine-one-one
(voice over) So what's the trouble
Oh, is that the-that the
(voice over) That guy's so excited
(voice over) The doctor and the
The camera follows Larry walking toward the group of neighbors
Paul's door is wide open
What's the matter
What's going on
What happened
He is answered by a tall male neighbor
She had a heart attack
(voice over) Oh my God
Sh-She's dead
The camera turns around to show us inside the apartment
There is a stretcher standing in the corridor
On the stretcher, a body - Lilian's body - is covered by a white sheet
Three men are standing near the stretcher, one of them wearing green gloves and writing on a clipboard, another one carrying a black leather case (he is evidently a doctor)
(voice over) She-she's dead
(voice over) Dead
(voice over) They're giving Mr
House a sedative right now
He's running around like crazy
The camera turns back to the tall neighbor standing near the front door
policeman enters the apartment
called
and they got here as soon as they could, but it was too late
Sh-We just met her last night
The camera turns back inside the corridor
The doctor is coming toward the front door
(voice over) Awful, just awful
(voice over) What happened
Well, it was a classic coronary
She just went like that
The camera turns back toward the group of neighbors
Is there anything we can do
Oh, my God
(voice over) You can be good neighbors
You know, we calmed him down, uh
Th-Th-Th-The first time we saw them was last night
We just met them
-We had
They invited us in for coffee
Such a
Such a nice lady
Nice lady
Sweet person
- - '   - Full shot on the entrance of Larry's building
Larry and Carol are coming out
They are very elegantly dressed, Larry wearing a suit and a necktie
God, okay
You look wonderful
Paul is coming down the street toward the entrance of the building
He is carrying some grocery in a paper bag
Oh, hallo
Hi
Hi, Mr
House, so
sorry
Thank you so much for those wonderful flowers
Paul seems very relax
He smiles a lot, which could be surprising, when we understand he put his wife in the grave only a couple of days ago
Oh
It was quite nice of you
That's
sure
If there's anything we can do
You know, anything you need, just tell us and we'll
No, anything
Anything at all
mean, God, it's just such a shock when anyone
It was just so sudden
mean, she seemed so
God, well, healthy
Yeah
She had a heart condition
She did
She never mentioned it
It
that she was
Ah
She wouldn't have
No
Right
Well
If there's anything we can do
Yeah, anything
Really
You know, if you need anything, if you are lonely, come by
You know
Thank you
You know, you owe me a wonderful French dessert
Oh, no, no, no
know,  haven't forgotten
Believe me, haven't forgotten
Well, have a nice time
You seem all gussied up
Yeah
Oh,  know
We're going to the opera
Oh, enjoy
My favorite, my favorite
Goodnight
He walks away toward the entrance of the building, still smiling a lot and looking very happy
Carol looks at him with a question on her face
Goodnight
Goodnight
Come, we're gonna be late
- Long shot on the Met building
We hear the music from Wagner's The Flying Dutchman
The camera slowly tilts down
We don't see Carol and Larry yet, but we hear their voices
(voice over) The deal was,  sit through the ice hockey game and you watch the whole opera
The camera is now on ground level, and we see Carol and Larry coming out of the Met
can't listen to that much Wagner, you know
start to get the urge to conquer Poland
They cross the esplanade in front of the Met
'  - Elaine's is a cosy place, like there are many around Greenwich Village
Carol and Larry are eating at Elaine's with Sy, Marilyn and Ted
Ted is a quite handsome man in his forties
We get a medium full view of the party, with a very mobile camera moving around the table and going from one person to another, getting closer to one person, then moving slightly away
'll tell you something
think it's weird
mean, listen to this
One night she's having coffee, and the next night they are carrying her out in a rubber bag
Oh,  know,  know
And she did not look like she was ready to go
Maybe this guy killed her, you know
Like, he's got, like, a young tootsie stashed someplace, or something
No, no, not this
you gotta, you gotta see this guy
This guy gets his jollies from licking the back of postage stamps
He's a-a boring old
Well,  can see that
Yeah, depending on whose picture is on the stamp
She never once mentioned that she had a heart condition
Well, what is she gonna say
Oh, yeah, hello, 'm Mrs
House and  have a bad heart
Well, she had no problem telling me about her hysterectomy in the first five minutes
It is much easier to talk about a hysterectomy than it is to talk about a heart condition
You said she liked
she liked eating high cholesterol desserts
Is that what you said
So, she had one too many
No
No
She wasn't on a diet
We discussed diets
So she wasn't on a diet
But
This would be a really great way to kill somebody
How
You clog their arteries with whipped cream, chocolate mousse, butter
They go like that
Carol is laughing very heartily at Ted's joke
That's great
like a
It's disgusting
you know what  mean
It's disgusting, but a
It's fatal
Wouldn't that be great
'd like to French-pastry myself to death right now
'll help you
really would
All right
In fact, 'd like another piece of pie, right after this
Do  dare
like yours better than this
Are you gonna start a restaurant
Are you serious about that
You really should
you're a great cook
Because, if you do, count me in
wanna be part of that
Really
Really
You should
No
Well,  don't know
mean, you
Are you serious
Yeah
Oh, oh, God, it'd be wonderful
What are you encouraging her for
It's so
She's great
She's a great cook
know, but
Well, it's thanks to you, actually
mean, it was his idea
The cooking lessons, so  mean
Yes,  had
Yes, but a restaurant is a serious business
mean, you just can't take that lightly
You can't be cavalier about a restaurant
'm not being cavalier about it
Do you know how time-consuming it is
Yeah
You have to be there every night
Absolutely
You'd be stuck there, you know
Wait
Look, look
They steal from, if you're not
You gotta be hap
But it's bi
it's what  do
It's-It's what  do, Larry
She'll cook
She's great
She's-She's a pro
She's a pro
She'll be cooking
She'll be cooking in the kitchen
'll be at the front, running the joint like Rick, you know, in Casablanca
It's not that easy
You do it anyway
Right as well get paid for it
Right
Directs
'm set, 'm serious about it
don't
mean, it's not like a hobby
mean, it's gotta be a serious thing
'll be the first customer
'  -  - Medium shot of Carol coming out of the bathroom
She switches the bathroom light off
She is wearing a pink night dress
The camera turns toward Larry's bed, in which Larry is already lying
He has a book in his hands
You know,  was thinking of fixing Ted up with Helen Dubin
You know,  figured they would just, you know, get into an argument over penis envy, or something
Oh
The poor guy suffers from it so
Carol puts something on the night-table on her side of the bed
Did he seem a little too cheerful
She looks at some pills bottles on the night table
No, he seemed like his regular self to me, but-but, uh, when you brought up the notion of the restaurant
the guy lit up like Mr
Glowworm
The restaurant
She picks up a hair brush
Yeah
He sees himself as, uh, you know, as Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca
- see him more as Peter Lorre, wringing his hands
Carol starts walking toward the other section of the room
The camera follows her
No, no, no
No, no, no
mean, Mr
House, Mr
House
Didn't seem a little too cheerful to you
(voice over) Mr
House, our next-door widower
Carol stops in front of a large mirror set on the wall in one corner of the room
Yes
Yes
mean, there's
Well, you know
mean, didn't he seem too compose for a man whose wife just died
Don't you think
(voice over) Well, Jesus
What do you want the guy to do, walk down the street sobbing hysterically
Carol starts brushing her hair
Well,  don't know
All  know is, they were supposedly looking forward to their, you know
anniversary, and, and, and, you know, uh-uh, i-i-if
suddenly dropped dead
wouldn't you sob for months, or-or years, if
You know
(voice over) Hey, don't make those kind of jokes, okay
don't like those remarks
And, meanwhile, 'm the guy who needs a physical check-up
Oh,  don't know
(voice over) Uh, uh
Carol walks to a chest of drawers, on top of which she drops the hairbrush
Then she switches the lights off in the other section of the bedroom, and walks back to the bed
mean, to me he just seemed a little too perky
You know
Now, suddenly he wants his French desserts, and, Have a nice time, you know, at the opera
And, my God, We're certainly dressed up
mean, you know
This guy should be a wreck
She sits down on her side of the bed, and takes her socks off
While talking, Larry puts the book and his glasses on the night- table
Carol switches the light off on her night table and gets into the bed
Right
Meanwhile,  can't get the-the Flying Dutchman theme out of my mind, you know
Remind me tomorrow to buy up all the Wagner records in town and rent a chainsaw
He switches the lights off on his bed table
The room is completely dark, and we hear the next sentences on a black screen
Helen Dubin's wrong for Ted
Yeah
She's too mousey
Well, he's a little mousey, too
They could have their little rodent time
They can eat cheese together
Carol bursts out laughing
The phone starts ringing
Oh, Christ
He switches the light back on, puts his glasses on his nose and picks up the phone
Hallo
Yes
Yes, of
Yes, of course you woke us
You know, not everybody's up at one o'clock in the morning watching the porn channel
'll put her on
He gives the phone receiver to Carol
Who is it
Ted
For you
Ted, hi
- Medium shot of Ted, dressed in a night-gown, and standing near the counter of a restaurant
The room is very dark, only lit by a lamp on the counter
figured out how he killed her and made it look like a coronary
He gagged her and tied her to the treadmill, and then he turned the exercise program up to the Olympic levels
'  -  - Carols bursts out laughing
No, no
You know,  mean,  just think this guy is too perky
You know,  mean he's not acting like a man whose beloved of twenty-eight years died just a few days ago
Larry is trying to get the telephone cord, stretched from his night-table to the handset hold by Carol, away from his face
Jesus, are you onto that
My God,  thought you were just joking
Yeah,  know
Let me speak to him, all right
What
Oh
Here
Just a sec
Here's Larr
She gives the handset to Larry
Hey, listen
She was not murdered
She
she had a heart attack
It was a coronary
There was a doctor there
He said to
He was an old man
- Close shot on Ted, drinking from a mug
How do you know it was a real doctor
'  -  - 'm not gonna touch that
'm tired
want to go to sleep
Look
- Medium shot of Ted
Wait-wait-wait a minute, wait a minute, put Carol back on, called about something else
Listen,  know a great location for a restaurant
- -   - yard in the middle of old New-York buildings
The camera is located at the inner end of the passage leading from the street to the yard
We gets a full shot of Carol and Ted coming from the street and walking toward us and the yard
Hah, look at this
Isn't this great
Well, it's dark
Aren't these walls great
cave, you know, like you have to go through a little cave
Oh,  see
And then you come out, to this here
They have reached the yard
The camera moves back to get a medium shot of them both
Oh, look at this though
It's really so beautiful
Yeah
Isn't it great
But
it's kind out of the way for a restaurant, isn't it
No, no
that's the appeal
That's just the appeal, because it's
it's,  mean it's so romantic
tucked away back in here like this
The camera leaves Carol and Ted in the middle of the yard and moves up and around to show us the old building around the yard
(voice over) Yeah
(voice over) And, you don't want street traffic
You want
(voice over) No
(voice over) you want a little out of the way spot that people hear about and lovers go to
(voice over) Yeah
(voice over) It takes months to take a reservation, you know
Very few tables
The camera moves down to ground level to give us a better view of the yard
It does look a bit neglected, with weeds growing in between the stones covering the ground
There are some trees and a small out-of-order fountain with a statue on top of it
(voice over) You know, you've really thought this out
(voice over) Oh, well,  used to come here all the time with-with July, when we were married
(voice over) Uh uh
Right
The camera moves back to Carol and Ted
Used to walk around here
Really beautiful at night
It's gorgeous at night
It's beautiful,  bet
used to think, What am  doing here with July
We don't love each other any more, you know
It made the moment doubly poignant
'  -  - Medium shot of the corridor, showing the front door
Paul opens the front door
Larry and Carol are standing in the doorway
Larry is wearing a necktie and Carol is carrying a large tray
Hi
How are you
Hi
How are you
Oh, my
These are my floating islands
hope you like meringue
Paul takes the tray from Carol's hands
love it
Come on in, come on in
Well, okay
This is unbelievable
Carol enters the apartment, followed by Larry
know, it's just
Did you do it
Larry closes the door behind him
did do it
told you
Anyway, this has got
this is vanilla sauce here and  put little chocolate truffles
Well, come on in
Do you like chocolate truffles
Would you share it with me
Oh, no
She made these just for you
This is
Oh, well
'  -   - They all enter the living room
No, no, no, it's too much for one
'll  make some coffee
Please
They're only half a dozen
No, no, no
Look, 'll make the coffee
That'd be better
Let me make it
Oh, you've already done so much
No, no
insist,  insist
Go on, sit down, relax
She takes the tray from Paul's hands
Aren't you nice
Enjoy yourself, you've been through enough
She walks to the kitchen, carrying the tray
She worked on those for
How're you holding up
Oh,  don't know
was thinking after a while
'd get away from here
From this place and all its memories
Uh uh, so you have someone to go with, or are you
have a brother in Florida
Oh, really
'm hoping he can get away for a while
Good
It's a good idea
Do you like snorkeling
Snorkeling
No, no
get nervous when brightly colored fish are staring at me face to face, you know
Hey, 've got some stamps  wanted to show you
He turns to his desk to pick up a stamp album
Oh, stamps
Well, that's
Come on, look at these
The camera pans to the kitchen
'  -  - The conversation between Paul and Larry keeps going in the living- room but we can't understand the words
Carol puts water in the glass jar of the coffee machine
She puts the lid on the jar and turns around to put the jar in the machine
She looks in the coffee plastic container and notices there is no coffee inside
She bends down and opens the cupboard door
Not finding any coffee in the cupboard, she closes it, stands up and turns around to look inside the cupboard above the sink
She closes it, and bends down to look inside the cupboard next to the dishwasher
She seems surprised by something and pauses
Then she takes a copper funeral urn from inside the cupboard
She stands up and takes the lid off the urn
She looks inside the urn and closes it
She seems a bit shocked and bends down to put the urn back inside the cupboard
Then she stands up and looks absently around her
'  -   - little later
Full shot of the room
Larry and Carol are sitting next to each other on the sofa
Carol is drinking coffee from a cup, and Larry is staring, with his arms crossed on his chest, looking a little bored
Paul is sitting on an armchair and eating the floating islands from a plate he is holding in his other hand
This is very delicious
Thank you
You are an artist
Well, thanks very much
Uh, was it a large
funeral
Oh, no
We had
very few friends, no family
The camera moves closer to Larry and Carol
Right
Just a simple affair, uh
Well, they're the best, aren't they
Yeah
guess
Anyway, then you're laid the rest, and, you know, was just
where, um, where are the twin cemetery plots
We
because, we were thinking that that was just such a romantic idea
Weren't we, Larry
You know
Larry
You remember when we were talking about the twin cemetery plots and, you know, how kind of romantic that is
Remember
Larry looks at his wife
He has a little difficulty to come back into a conversation he wasn't following
Uh-huh
Yes, yes
We were
We were spending the eternity with the beloved
sound like
sound like one of those guys, now
The camera pans to Paul
He has put his plate on the low table
Yes
(voice over) Yes but,  was just wondering where, um, where is the cemetery
Oh, it's
uh, in
uh, it's in Nyack
We used to summer there occasionally
He wipes his lips with his napkin
'  -   - Medium shot
Larry enters the apartment, followed by Carol, who then walks in front of him
What was all that stuff about twin cemetery plots
Listen, Larry
You know
mean, we-we never discussed it at all, but knew that you were trying to tell me something, so  picked up on it quickly
He closes the door behind him
Listen
But
You know, we
Okay, just
was in the kitchen okay
And  was making the coffee
There were no beans, so,  was looking in his cupboards, just to see, you know, and  came across this urn, okay
And  opened it and there were ashes in it
Ashes
Funeral ashes
Did you wash your hands
Larry, he had her cremated
How did you know it was her, for Christ's sake
They were ashes
What, did they resemble Mrs
House
He walks into the living-room
Oh, and who else would it be, okay
Larry picks up his jacket from the back of an armchair
Anybody
Could it be, an associate, an old relative, his accountant, his cat
Who knows
(voice over) Right, right
Hidden, uh
Hidden away
What do you mean
Th-th-the guy didn't do anything
The camera pans across the hall toward the kitchen
She has a box (cereals
) in her hand
Look, Larry
All  know is he lied, okay
He lied
She puts the box in a cupboard above the sink
Then she picks up the phone on the wall
(voice over) Look
Maybe-maybe-maybe he is embarrassed
Maybe he didn't want to spend eternity next to the beloved, so he-he told us that-uh
You know, what's the difference
Who are you calling
Ted
The camera pans back to the living-room and Larry
Larry walks behind a partition, still holding his jacket
The camera follows his movement
Oh, Jesus
Leave the guy alone
You know, he-he
he's a poor widower, he wants to go on a vacation or something
(voice over) Yeah
Where
Oh,  know where, ah ah
Snorkeling, right
Ah ah
Larry puts the jacket on something we don't see because it is hidden by the partition
Then he picks up a brochure on a low table and walks toward the kitchen
The camera follows him
So what
Different strokes
You know, he has fun, uh, sitting at the bottom of the water, face to face with squid
Carol is still standing in the kitchen, with the phone handset on her ear
Oh,  know
know
What about this
What if they had a big insurance policy, or something like that, huh
Too much Double Indemnity, you know
Hu-Huh
(speaking on the phone) Hi
Yeah
Hi, it's me
Listen, we were just in our neighbor's apartment, right
Larry walks away from the kitchen
Yeah
And get this
came across an urn with ashes in it
Only he says he had his wife buried
'  - - - Ted is lying on a large comfortable sofa, sipping beer from a bottle
That's what you do if you don't want an autopsy
You don't want something discovered, you know
Like-like poison
'  -  - Carol is still standing up, the telephone handset stuck between her ear and her shoulder
Mm
Right
They'd have detected poison, wouldn't they
'  - - - Uh,  don't know
There's a lot of different kinds of exotic poisons, you know
'  -   - Full shot of the kitchen, seen from the hall
Carol is still standing up but now she holding the phone handset with her hand
Yeah, but why would he
Why would he be lying
mean, why-why would he lie at all
Larry walks back into the kitchen
Jesus, you're up to poisons already
You guys are slipping into a mad obsession
Yeah
Oh, would you do that
Because
That'd be great
Because, you know, 'm not good at that kind of thing, okay
All right
Okay
Well, 'll talk to you later
Okay, bye
She puts the phone back on its hook on the wall Let's go to bed
Could we go to bed, now
Hey, 'm not tired
What do you mean, You're not tired
You know, Ted's gonna check with the funeral home, tomorrow
Great
You know what  mean
mean,  don't understand why you're not, not more fascinated with this
We could be living next door to a murderer, Larry
Well, New York is a melting pot
You know, get used to it
'  -  - Later in the night
Medium shot on the bed
Larry is asleep, but Carol is not
She moves in the bed, and then sits up
She turns around, pats her pillow, and tries to lie back on her side
But she sits up again, looking around the room
Eventually, she gets out of the bed
She walks around the bed in the dark, and switches on the lights in the corridor
The camera follows her in the corridor
'  -   - Carol switches the lights on in the hall, then she looks into the peephole in the front door
Oh my God
The camera turns around toward the corridor
Larry is getting out of the bedroom, putting his slippers on
Hey, are you okay
Carol walks in the corridor toward him
Larry
Larry,  heard a noise
-- heard a noise in the hallway, so  just
You know, - looked and think
think Mr
House was getting on the elevator
Larry hops toward her, still trying to put his slippers on
She backs up and they are now both in the front hall
Yeah
You're sure
Yeah, you know,  was
'm-'m
almost certain that it was him
So-So-So what
Just, you know
mean, who else could it be
So what
It's not a crime
He can get on the elevator
know
know
But wh-who would it be at one-thirty in the morning
Oh, Jesus
was in a deep sleep
What-What's the difference
But, you mean, you know how we're always complaining about living on the geriatric floor
Do you know what 'm saying
joke
While Larry is answering her, Carol opens the front door and peeks into the hallway
All right, so it was Mr
House
So he got on the elevator
It's not a felony
The guy pays rent
He's entitled mean, what
Can you go back to bed
This is crazy
You woke me up out of a deep sleep
gotta get up early tomorrow morning
Carol closes the door, and walks toward the kitchen
The camera follows her
'  -  - Carol looks through a notebook
know what 'm gonna do
'm gonna ring him up
'm gonna ring his apartment
'm gonna see if he's home
(voice over) You're gonna ring Mr
House, now
Yes, because this is really
(voice over) What are you talking about
It's very sus
Larry joins Carol when she already has the handset in her hand
But she succeeds in dialing Paul's number
Don't ring Mr
What are you doing
No, don't ring
Let me just
Larry, don't
Wait
Don't ring Mr
house
This is a widower
Leave the poor guy alone
You're crazy
Stop it
Carol listens to the phone
That's one ring
So you saw him go out
It's not a-not a crime
Okay, two rings
He's not there, yet
Larry takes the handset from Carol's hand
Give me this
Give me this
What are you doing
Look, if you want to find out if somebody left, just call downstairs
Call the-the-the person at the desk
All right, 'll call
Just keep ringing
Ask if someone went out
Keep ringing
Yeah, um
Sure, 'm gonna keep ringing
You got it
While Carol walks out of the kitchen, Larry puts the phone back on its hook on the wall
Oh, man
Carol walks into the hall
The camera follows her
'  -   - (voice over) This is insane
What's gotten into you
Carol picks up the building internal telephone handset from the wall
don't know
What is he doing
Where is this guy at one- thirty in the morning
You know what 'm saying
(voice over) It's not your business
He can go any place he wants
(in the phone) Hallo
Yes, hallo
This is Mrs
Lipton
Yes
Did anybody just leave the building
'm just
hmm
You're sure
You're sure no one
No, okay
All right
Yes
Thank you
While she was talking on the phone, the camera has moved toward Larry, standing at the entrance of the kitchen
Okay
Are you happy
We hear the noise of the phone being put back on its hook
don't believe this
Man,  don't get it
Larry joins his wife in the hall
Now, can we back to bed
No
For crying out loud, it's no big deal
You're making a mystery where nothing exists
Just let me think about this a second
Okay,  got it
Wait

No, wait
Listen to me
Larry
Listen
He got on the elevator, okay
You know, 'm gonna
No, wait
No, no, listen to this

What do you mean, so what
He's
What's the big deal
So, the next-door neighbor went out in the middle of the night and took his car
So, he went someplace
All right
So, 'm right, though
She starts walking back to the bedroom
Larry follows her
The camera remains in the front hall, filming them
That's all
mean, 'm right
mean, so you're right
So big deal
Yes, he isn't in his apartment
But this kind of right is gonna put us in the toilet
So, you're right
You're suspicious
Yeah, that's right
It says more about your mind that about him
What about your rigidity
How about that
Get into bed
Get into bed
How about that point
You're so
What's wrong with you
Jesus
They disappear in the bedroom
- - '   - Long shot on the crossroad between the street where Larry's residence is located and another street
Carol is crossing the street
She stops walking while on the crosswalk
The camera zooms on her and we see an expression of surprise on her face
Reverse angle long shot on the entrance of Larry's building
Paul comes out of the building
The camera zooms on him : he looks around him as if afraid to be followed
Reverse angle shot on Carol looking at him from a distance
She enters her building
She smiles to the attendant on duty
Hi
'  -  - Full shot of Carol walking down the staircase leading to the basement
We see her through the glass panel of a heavy metal safety door
She opens the door
Jack
The camera follows Carol to a reverse angle shot showing the workshop of Jack, the factotum caretaker of the building
With a screwdriver and a plier in his hands, he is working on something we don't see
Jack, do you think you could come upstairs today, because got a leak in the kitchen
Well, yeah
Yeah
You can
Sure
Well, but, it will be this afternoon
But

All right, you're not gonna go now

Jack walks out of his workshop and along one of the basement corridors
In a minute
Okay, just wait a second
'll be right back
The camera follows Jack walking away
(voice over) Yeah
Okay
All right
Oh, God
The camera turns around to a reverse angle shot on Carol, still in the workshop
She looks around, apparently looking for something
She peeks through the door of the workshop, to make sure Jack is not coming back too early
Carol rushes to a key-box on the wall, into which there is a spare key for every apartment in the building
She selects a key, takes it out of the box and puts it in her pocket
Then she leaves the workshop toward the staircase
'  -  - Full shot of the hallway
Carol comes out of the elevator, and looks around her
She walks back and forth in the hallway, before coming back to Paul's apartment door, just in front of the elevator
She opens the door with the key she has just stolen in Jack's workshop
'  -  - Full shot of the front door, seen from the living room
The front corridor is completely dark
The door opens and Carol walks in
She closes the door behind her
Carol walks toward the living room, and the light coming from the windows
'  -  - Carol crosses the kitchen
She kneels down to look into the cupboard where she had found the funeral urn
Apparently the urn is not there anymore
-   - Long shot on a crosswalk in New-York
Paul is crossing the street
The camera zooms on Paul
He has almost crossed the street, but he suddenly stops a few feet from the next sidewalk
He feels his jacket : apparently he has forgotten something in his apartment
He turns around and starts walking back on the crosswalk
'  -  - Carol is still looking in all the cupboards of the kitchen
She gets out of the kitchen into the living-room
'  - - - The camera pans around the room, following Carol, who looks inside every piece of furniture in the room
-   - Medium shot of Paul walking along the sidewalk, going back toward his apartment
'  - - - Carol has picked up a few papers from a low table, and is looking at them
She puts her hand into her trouser pocket to get her glasses out
She puts her glasses on to have a better look at the documents she has found
'  -  - Through the window of the lobby, we get a full shot of Paul coming toward the entrance of the building
An attendant rushes to open the door for him
'  - - - Carol is sitting at the desk
She has opened the drawer of the desk and is looking through its content
She takes an Air France ticket folder out of the drawer and looks inside it
Then she picks up another one

She stands up and picks up the phone from the desk and starts dialing a number

He gives a quick look up to the floor numbers above the door
'  - - - Same shot of Carol on the phone
The urn is missing
It's gone
Yeah,  think it might have been
He had this satchel last night
He was carrying this bag, and  think that might have been what he had in his satchel
'  - - - Close shot of Ted's back
He is still seated at his desk and talking on the phone Listen, 'd get out of there right away, if  were you
The camera moves around Ted, showing the typewriter he is typing on
No, no, no
Go, go, go
We'll do
We'll talk more from your apartment
'  - - - Same shot of Carol on the phone
He's not going snorkeling with his brother
He's got two tickets to Paris, and he's got reservations at the Georges Cinq hotel with a woman named Helen Moss
She turns around, because she feels she heard a noise in the landing hallway
'  -  - One of Paul's neighbor is standing in the hallway, waiting for the elevator
He's got some documents in his hand
The elevator dings and the door opens
Paul comes out
Oh
Hi
How are you
Good morning
How are you
Paul has his key in his hand and is ready to open his apartment door
Good
You got the notice on the
Uh, maintenance increase
Paul turns around to look at the neighbor
No
When did that happen
'  - - - Close shot on Carol, whispering in the phone and looking toward the front door
'm gonna look around and see what else  can dig up here, okay
Yeah
'm telling you, this is just
Ted, -'m just dizzy with freedom
This is just
uh, this is just the craziest thing 've ever done
'  - - - Close-up shot on the ashtray, where a cigarette is burning slowly
The camera pans to a close-up shot on Paul's face, still on the phone
Yes, it's crazy
But soon, we'll be too old to do anything crazy
Go, leave, leave, leave
'  - - - Carol puts the phone down on the desk
She stands and turns around when she hears the front door opening
Black screen shot on the front door in the dark of the corridor, then the camera quickly spins around to show Carol, standing in the living-room, with a frightened look on her face
She walks away from the room
The camera spins back to the front door, which opens
Paul enters and switches the lights on
He closes the front door, and walks along the corridor to the living-room
Carol walks into the kitchen from the living-room
The camera pans to Paul, looking for something on his desk
He looks through all the documents scattered on the desk
The camera pans back to Carol, hiding in the kitchen, then back to Paul
Paul opens both his hands in a gesture of despair : apparently, he hasn't found what he was looking for
He starts walking across the room, and the camera pans back to Carol in the kitchen
She rushes out of the kitchen
The camera remains at the same spot, and we see Paul in the living-room, still looking for whatever he is missing
He walks out of the living-room through the kitchen
'  -  - Paul enters the room, looking in the inner pocket of his jacket
He walks around the room, and opens a closet
He looks through the hanging clothes, and finds a few documents in one of the jackets
He closes the closet, and starts looking through the documents he has found
He puts them inside the inner pocket of his jacket
He starts walking out of the room, when the phone rings
He stops and picks up the phone receiver on one of the night-tables
Hallo
Medium shot of Carol hiding under the bed
We notice she doesn't have her glasses anymore
(voice over) Oh, hi
Yeah

-
Yes,  miss you, too

Back to Paul standing by the bed and talking in the telephone
Yeah, look
Okay,  have to run
But 'll see you later, okay
Okay
He puts the phone down on its hook, and starts walking out of the room
He stops, thinks for a couple of seconds, turns around, sits on the bed and picks up the phone
Back to Carol under the bed
The bed frame hits her back when Paul sits on it
She looks up
We hear Paul dialing a number
(voice over) Extension five
Well, keep ringing, would you please
Because  just talked to her
What
Okay
Uh, will you tell her
yes, tell her that Tom called
Tom
Thank you
Back to Paul sitting on the bed
He puts the phone down on its hook, stands up and starts walking out of the room
Back to Carol under the bed, waiting for Paul to get out of his apartment
- -   - Starting from street level, the camera tilts up along a very modern office building, all glass and steel
sign, above the main entrance, says 10 East 53
This is the building where Larry's office is located
' - Full shot of a large office room
In the forefront, a reception desk, with a young female receptionist talking to someone we still don't see
Coming from the other end of the room, Larry is walking with Marcia, a tall dark-haired lady, wearing sunglasses
So,  thought your rewrites were great
really think you helped your book, you know
It's
It's dense a little bit, but, uh
Well,  don't want it to be too transparent,  mean
They are now at the reception desk level, and, since the camera is following them, we can see the young gentleman the receptionist is talking with
That's
That's something you're never gonna have to worry about, you know
This book makes Finnegan's Wake look like airplane reading, you know
But-But it's long
It's- It's-It's
They are now walking along a corridor
You know, you're the only editor in the world 'll take suggestions from, but even you shouldn't push it
No, 'm not pushing it
think the book is great
Absolutely great
You know, but, uh
how much, how much of Dorothy is you
As  was reading it,  kept thinking how much is
you know, how much did you base it on your own life
They have now reached a smaller room, actually Larry's private room
Marcia takes her glasses off, and then her coat, and sits on a sofa
Well,  was a waitress
lived with a poet
was a film critic
(voice over) Right, but not-not a blackjack dealer, right
No, but  put myself through school playing poker
The camera pans to Larry, who is standing up at the other end of the room, looking through some documents
Oh, really
Do you still play
(voice over) No, but  still know how
Yes
Are you good
(voice over) Yeah
Yeah, because maybe you could give me some pointers
(voice over) could turn your game around in two hours
Could you
That's great
That's
you know, you-you have all these skills, and you're beautiful, and you can write so well
and now it turns out you play poker
This is, uh, too good to be true
Larry sits down with the pile of documents on his laps
The camera pans back to Marcia
She has a cigarette in her hand
Well,  wouldn't say beautiful
(voice over) Oh,  would
But  do have tremendous sex-appeal
The camera pans back to Larry, who is looking through the huge pile of paper on his laps, perhaps a manuscript
Okay, you sold me
Are-are you seeing anybody
(voice over) No
Don't let my confidence fool you, it's a facade
Why do you ask
Because  have a friend who became single recently, and - know he would get a big kick out of you
(voice over) Oh
So, when do you want your poker lessons
Uh, next week
could take you to lunch
We could-we could, um, 'll put you on my expense account, and you could
teach me when to
bet and when to fold
(voice over) How about a cheeseburger right now
The phone rings
Now
That's a possibility
Larry picks up the phone from a small table
You know, we could, we could do
(talking into the telephone) Hallo
Yes
Where are you
The camera pans back to Marcia, who listens to Larry, smoking her cigarette
(voice over) Is everything okay
Really
No,  could, sure
The camera pans back to Larry
could
Yeah
need- need, you know, five minutes, or so
Okay
Yes
Yes
know where it is
Okay, hold on
He puts the telephone down on its hook
can't do it
have to
My wife,  have a little thing have to do
'll do the cheeseburger with you next week, or something
The camera pans back to Marcia, who is smiling
Story of my life
She crushes her cigarette in and ashtray and stands up
- -   - Full shot of a round concrete pond, with a fountain in the middle pouring water
In the background, a meadow, with chairs scattered on it
Carol is standing by the pond
Larry is talking to her, looking very nervous
What do you mean, you snuck into his apartment
Are you nuts
Oh, stop being such a fuddy-dud
fuddy-dud
Carol starts walking around the pond
Larry follows her
Yeah
What are you talking about
That's a crime
You can't do that
You
That's-That's burglary and breaking and entering
But
What has gotten into you lately
For crying out loud, save a little craziness for menopause
It was a cinch
took the key and  just let myself in
Hey, look
Do
don't want to
You-You'll wind up rooming with John Gotti
You can't do that
You can't just steal the key and then go into somebody's apartment
Listen
He's not going snorkeling with his brother, okay
Okay
don't wanna know
don't wanna be an accessory
He's going to Paris, to a fancy hotel with a woman named Helen Moss
Tell Ted
don't want to know
Leave me alone
They keep on walking around the pond, the camera following them from a fixed location
They are now hidden by the fountain
(voice over from behind the fountain) told Ted
(voice over from behind the fountain) You told Ted before you told me
(voice over from behind the fountain) Yeah
He's more open-minded about these things
(voice over from behind the fountain) Yes,  know
'm-'m-'m a bore
'm-Because -Because don't break the law, you know
(voice over from behind the fountain) Yeah
(voice over from behind the fountain) live within the Constitution, so 'm dull
(voice over from behind the fountain) Listen
Perhaps he got rid of the urn, okay
They appear back from behind the fountain
- don't wanna hear
Leave me alone
Don't tell me
He talked on the phone with a woman
How do you know
Because he
Well, he came back while  was there, you know, so
He did
Yeah, but  hid under the bed
You hid under his bed
He didn't see me, Larry
He didn't see me at all
cannot believe this
My stomach is curdling, here
He was-He was very lovey-dovey with his kind of bimbo, you know
He kept saying stuff like, you know, don't worry, it's gonna be all right
We're gonna be together
That kind of thing
They keep on walking around the pond, slowly coming back toward the camera, which moves a little to meet them
But what would you have done if he, if he found you out
know, listen, - couldn't think that far ahead
That far ahead
You're talking two seconds
No,  c
He could have looked under the bed and there you are
What do you
Yeah, but
Larry, listen
And then, listen to this
He-He called this woman back
Probably this-this Helen Moss woman, right
don't wanna know
Leave me alone
And when he calls her back, she's not there
And then he leaves this message, and he says : Tell her Tom called
You know what 'm saying
Tom
Tom, Larry
They are back at the same place where we saw them first by the pond
They stop walking
Yeah, yeah
know,  get it, his name is Paul, but don't care
don't wanna hear
Well, okay
Well, 'll tell you
thought  did
just don't
thought  did a great job, and so did Ted
don't think a private eye could have done any better than me
put everything back where  found it,  was very careful made one mistake
What
left my reading glasses on his table
Larry looks at her with a very puzzled eye
'  -  - Medium close shot on Paul's apartment front door
We get a close shot of the back of Carol's head
The door opens on Paul
Oh, hallo
Hi
- thought 'd bring you some chocolate mousse
know how much you enjoyed the last dessert
Carol walks rapidly inside the apartment, followed by Larry
Paul looks a bit surprised by this intrusion
He follows them along the corridor
He doesn't even close his front door
'  -  - The camera follows the three persons along the corridor
Well, thank you
thought 'd-'d give you, you know, another shot at something really delicious
Do you want me to serve that for you, because, you know, you should have it while it's still fresh
The shot becoming a bit wider, we notice that Paul is carrying the tray of chocolate mousse that Carol gave him when entering his apartment
And you can divide it up and we can all have some
That'd be great
That's a great idea
You'll really like this dessert
Okay, 'll get some plates for it
Wait a minute
Paul walks out of the corridor toward his kitchen, and Carol rushes into the living-room
Okay, that'd be really good
Yeah, that's great
'  -   - They both start searching the room frenetically
While Larry looks on the desk, Carol searches the rest of the room, even kneeling on the floor
() Come over here
put'em
um
right here
Right in here somewhere
The first
Wait
should
(to Paul, with a much louder voice) Uh, how-How are you doing in there
You need
Larry drops things on the floor
With a nervous gesture, Carol shushes him
You need any help
The camera pans to the kitchen, where Paul is preparing the dessert
No, 'm fine
'll be right in
(voice over) Um
Okay, great
The camera pans back to the living room, where Larry is still nervously messing things on the desk
Then he starts moving around the room, looking for his wife's glasses
Carol puts things back in order on the desk
Larry walks to her, and whisper something we can't understand
(to Paul, with a louder voice) Are you okay
Can-can-can-can we do anything for you
(voice over from the kitchen) Coffee or tea
Tea
It's what
'd like to have some tea
Paul walks into the room, with a pair of glasses in his hand
You know,  found your glasses
Mine
These are yours, aren't they
Yes
No
Uh, no
Yeah
Uh
No no no no no
They
They
Oh, God
Carol and Larry both look very nervous
Carol takes the glasses from Paul's hand
No, no, those aren't yours
These are the same, actually
They are, aren't they
These-These-These ones, are
They are actually
They're mine
Honey, they're mine
You know what happened
think the other night, must have left them here
It's the strangest thing
Did you
didn't notice that
No, no
Yeah
know
Because, remember, you were saying that you thought that  left them at your mother's house
Carol and Larry both look very embarrassed
Paul looks at them with a slight surprised eye
At your mother's house
That's right
Of course, so
She turns toward Paul, who has remained very calm
That mousse looks fabulous
Anyway, it's so good
love mousse
Thank you very much
Hey, listen, are you looking forward to going snorkeling in the Caribbean
Very much
Very much
Uh uh
That's funny
found those glasses under my bed
That's because  must have dropped them and they probably got kicked under
Kicked under, right, because what she'll do, she'll drop
They were just
She'll always drop things and she'll kick them all around the house
They f
The mousse
He walks away to the kitchen, with a strange smile on his face
She's always-She's always kick
Carol looks at Larry with a meaning look, to make him stop rambling
Anyway, 'd love to have some mousse
Yes, really
Remember there was the time you kicked the mousse under the bed in the house
Remember that
It was
Carol walks away toward the kitchen
remember
It took-took six months to get the
- -   - Medium full shot of Carol waiting under the awning of a place (hotel or club) called the Five Hundred
She hears a car stopping and she looks at the street
(voice over) Hi
'm sorry 'm late
The traffic's murder
Carol runs to the car
know, but where
where are we going
(voice over from inside the car) looked up, looked up Helen Moss in the phone book
Carol climbs into the car and closes the door
(voice over from inside the car) Yeah
(voice over from inside the car) It was just
Moss
(voice over from inside the car) Right
(voice over from inside the car) So -it's on Bank Street
The car drives away, with Ted's voice fading as the car gets away from us
(voice over from inside the car) Bank Street
we're going to go down and do surveillance
got a lot whole of food
It's great
called up this
called this number
- -   - Full view of the corner of two very quiet streets
brick building covered with vines
The camera pans away from the building to Ted's car parked on the other side of the street corner
Medium shot of the inside of the car, through the open window on the passenger's side, Carol's side
There's her house
Right
So we should just sit here and wait, huh
Yeah
Okay
They look at each other and laugh
Slightly later
Medium shot through the windshield
The view is a little blurred by the daylight reflection on the windshield
Maybe he thought that if he, if he, if he divorced her, she'd-she'd hit him for a ton of alimony
Or maybe she, maybe she controls the family fortune
What do you think of that
Oh,  don't know
Yeah, maybe we're wrong, Ted
Maybe we're just, you know
mean, maybe she died of natural causes, like the doctor said and we're just two people with, you know, hyperactive imaginations whose lives need a little shot of adrenaline
Ted looks through the paper food-bag he has brought with him
Does yours
'll tell you, mine needs something
Yeah
What's that, there
You want
They're jelly doughnuts
You want a jelly doughnut
(with a disgusted tone in her voice) Ooh
Eh
Come on
No, come on
Come on
You gotta get into it
Okay
Oh my God
Look, look, look, look, look
The camera pans to the other corner of the street
Two people, a male and a female, are coming out of the brick building
(voice over) What
What
What
What
(yelling in voice over) Helen
Helen
(Back to a normal low voice) Duck, duck, duck
Neither one of the couple has turned around at the sound of Ted's yelling, and they start walking down the street, away from the corner
(voice over) Ted
God, oh
Oh
(yelling in voice over) Helen
The camera pans back to the car, looking through the open window on the passenger's side
Carol is hiding under the dashboard
Ted is hiding his face with his paper bag, holding a paper cup in the other hand
It's not her
It's not her
She sits back in her seat
No, it's not her
Carol laughs
What
Oh, God, you really have this worked out, don't you
She keeps on laughing
Ted starts laughing too
Slightly later
It is raining
It is still the same medium shot through the passenger's window, but the window is now closed, with the rain pouring on the window-pane
figured she'd come out and go to work, you know
Maybe she doesn't work
Maybe she's like
you and she has writers hours
'm writing a play about something that happened to you and me
Oh, God
Oh, dear
What
Remember-Remember that time
you and
you and  and Larry and Julie were all on that-that eating tour of France
Oh, God
Yeah
Yeah
And they, and then they wandered off and they forgot to pick us up
You remember
We had to share that bed-and- breakfast place
Right
Do you remember those wonderful cottages
Yeah
And  remember
that we shared a bedroom together, right
Yeah, but not a bed
The camera pans away from the car to the other corner of the street
Someone is coming out of the brick building
It is apparently a male wearing white pants
He opens an umbrella
(voice over) No, not a
Well, God
You were too gentlemanly to suggest that
Well, it's not
Not that  didn't think of it
The camera follows the man with white pants, while he is crossing the street on the other side of the street from the car
No
Well,  knew what was going on in your mind
because of the way you kept plying me with Chateau Margaux, remember
The camera is back behind the passenger's window of the car
Though the car-windows, we see the white-pants-man walking on the sidewalk on the other side of the street
Ted and Carol do not seem to notice him at all
It could have been our little secret, then you passed out
Well, you
Yeah, God
It seems like a long time ago, doesn't it
Not that long ago
Slightly later
The rain has stopped
Same shot through the passenger's window of the car, but the window is now open again
long pause
Ted and Carol seem to be both lost them in their own thoughts
Then Ted gives a look outside and comes back to attention
Look, look, look, look
Oh, what
The camera pans to the other side of the street
woman is coming out of the brick building
(yelling in voice over) Helen
(with a softer voice) Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck
On the other side of the street, the woman has stopped and is looking around her
(voice over) Oh, god, yeah
Right
(voice over) She didn't see us
She didn't see us
(voice over) No
No
That's gotta be her
(voice over) 'll bet it's
The woman starts walking again on the sidewalk
(voice over) Are you sure
(voice over) mean, she answered to Helen
(voice over) She answers to
She's pretty
(voice over) Yeah, 'll say
The woman has reached the corner of the street and she lifts her arm
(voice over) She's
What is she doing
She's getting a
(voice over) She's getting a cab
yellow cab stops near the woman
(voice over) Okay, okay
Hold on
(voice over) Keep-Keep down
(voice over) Okay, don't worry
Don't worry
(voice over) 'm gonna follow her
(voice over) All right
The woman opens the cab door and climbs into it
- -   - Long shot of a street covered with a metal structure
We could be under a commuter train bridge
The yellow cab is driving toward us
The cab stops at the corner of the street with another street
The woman comes out of the cab, and walks away on the sidewalk of the other street
The camera pans back to the first street and we see Ted's car coming toward us
The camera stops at the corner of the street and Carol walks out of the car
She runs in the direction of Helen, and waves Ted to join her
The camera pans to the end of the street, which actually is a dead end street with the back door of a movie house
The woman enters the movie house
'   - Medium shot of a door leading to an emergency stair way
Helen, the woman we just saw coming out of the yellow cab, is coming down the steps and through the door
She is blonde, young and pretty
(voice over) Watch your step
It's very steep
Be careful
Behind Helen, Paul is coming out of the stairway
Helen has stopped to look around her
Oh, this is beautiful
Isn't it
Yeah
The camera pans away from the couple toward the main hall of the movie house
It is an old-fashioned movie house, with red velvet seats, and a carved balcony
(voice over) Well, we only show revivals now
This week, we have Fred Astaire
Next week, we have an Orson Welles festival
(voice over) Oh, yeah
(voice over) Yeah, it'll be about the last thing we do before we start renovating
The camera keeps on panning around the room
(voice over) Mm
Oh, Paul,
(voice over) Oh, come on, there's nobody around
We hear moaning and kissing sounds
(voice over) -
(voice over) Come on
(voice over) Okay
'   -  - Full shot of the backstage behind the screen
In a corner, a stairway going to the top of the backstage
Half-hidden on the stairway, Carol and Ted
(voice over) 've never been behind a movie screen before like this
(voice over) Strange, isn't it
(voice over) Yeah
(voice over) Used to be a first-run house when the neighborhood was better
The camera pans to the back of the screen, in front of which Paul and Helen are standing
Oh
Beautiful, huh
Look around
All these mirrors
The camera pans around the room, where a lot of huge mirrors are stacked
Huh
Well, it used to be all mirrors, and it was quite beautiful
The camera tilts down to give us a closer shot on the mirrors
(voice over) 'm having all this broken glass replaced as we go along with this renovation
You know, they used to have stage shows, here
Now, of course, we only show old movies
The camera tilts back up on Paul and Helen
It has such a lonely feeling
That's because 'm the only one here
And my assistant, Mrs
Dalton
'm gonna have this place fixed up, then 'm gonna sell it
The money's gonna come in handy
It sure will
Paul looks around, a bit worried
What's that noise
Where
The camera pans to the other side of the room, where a middle-aged woman with red curly hair has just entered
She is Gladys Dalton, Paul's assistant
She is walking with the help of a cane
(voice over) Oh, Mrs
Dalton
didn't know you were here so early
Oh, uh, - didn't know whether an-anyone was here
-'m sorry
-- heard the noise and  thought
(voice over) It's quite all right
But, but, uh
(voice over) It's quite all right
apologize
(voice over) Quite all right
All right
Gladys Dalton starts going out of the room and the camera tilts up on the stairway, on which Ted and Carol are still hiding
(voice over) 'd love to really get an acting job
had it with this modeling
(voice over) Maybe you won't have to work at all
Ted and Carol are moving away from the stairway, which remains empty
'  -  - Close shot on the clock on the wall : the time is just after one o'clock
The room is completely dark and the clock is the only source of light
The camera pans to the bed and on Carol, sound asleep
We hear a noise, like an object dropping down
Carol instantly wakes up
She gets up and the camera pans to Larry, still asleep
He eventually wakes up, moves around in the bed, takes his glasses from the night-table and put them on his nose
(whispering in voice over) Oh, my God
Slowly Larry gets out of the bed
What's the matter
(voice over) Larry, come with me, okay
Larry starts walking along the corridor
Oh, Geez,  was
(voice over) Come on
was fast asleep
was dreaming of round card girls
'  -   - Larry has reached the front hall
Carol is looking through the peephole of the front door
Okay
Uh, it looks like he's gone
Yeah
Yeah
He's gone
Oh, Christ
Not that again
Please, you know
Listen, Larry
want to take another look around his apartment
Yeah
Carol walks along the corridor toward the bedroom
Larry follows her
What are you talking about
Where're you going
Listen
It's-It's one o'clock in the morn
He'll never be back, Larry
What
What
'  -  - No, he's not coming back
Not for at least an hour, an hour and a half
What-What're you doing
You got his key
Yeah
You're kidding
What are you talking about
You can't do
Why
because you-you followed him to the movie house, you-you said there was nothing happening
No, wait a minute, look, he was with this young model type, and they were talking about money
Carol is putting her shoes on
Well, so what
That's the
So, that's the motive
What
Hey, listen to me
Come here
What are you talking about
Carol walks back through the corridor toward the front hall
Larry follows her
Come here
Wait a minute
Come here
Look, look
Come here
What do you mean, Larry
've been thinking about you
'  -   - What do you mean

Huh

Five
Only five
What

He points to the bedroom
Well,  didn't
Sleep
command it
No,

Sleep
Larry, all  can tell you is, if this had been a few years ago, you would have been doing the same thing
Because if you recall, we solved a mystery
Yep, we solved a mystery once
Remember
It was the-it was the noises in the attic mystery
Uh, yes
The country house
The bluebird
know
That's right
So
But that, though, was a sweet mystery
This is murder
This
Wh
You agree, right
It's murder, Larry
So, 'm right
She opens the front door and walks out of the apartment
No,
Yeah, look, no, - forbid you

It's a-a
'm forbidding
Is that what you do when forbid you
If-If that's what you
'm not going to be forbidding you a lot, if you do
'  -  - Full shot of the landing
Carol is walking rapidly toward us and Paul's apartment
Larry walks behind her
Carol takes Paul's key out of her pocket and tries to open the front door
But she takes the wrong key on the keyring
Oh, damn it
Larry takes her by the shoulders
Don't do this
We should be asleep, now, in one of our many cuddling positions
Please, stop it, will you
Please, be quiet, Larry
This is wrong
Be quiet
You're gonna wake up the neighbors, okay
Okay, got it
got it
She opens the door
'  -   - Full shot of the front door, seen from the living room
small lamp is still lit on a low table
The door opens and Carol walks in, followed by Larry
This is no good
promise you, this could only lead to great unhappiness
Listen, Larry
Relax, okay
She closes the front door
Pl
can't relax
How can  relax
'm in a strange man's apartment in my, in my -shirt and-and pajamas
Oh, don't worry about it
All right, now Ted told me to try something here
Yeah
She rests her hands on the telephone, which is next to the lamp
What do you mean, Ted told you
Who
Ted
Ted
What is he, your mentor
The camera zooms to a close shot on the telephone
Carol picks it up
Um, Last number dialed
The camera zooms backward to Carol with the phone handset to her ear
Ted is a sick schmuck
He's-He's home, and we're in
Just be quiet for a second, all right
She listens to the phone
Shhh
mean, 'm
What if he comes back
'm
My heart is
Larry
Waldron
Uh, who
Who is this
Who do you want
Um, who's this
She puts her hand on the phone microphone and turns toward Larry
Do you know anybody named Waldron
Waldron
Hang the phone up
Just be quiet
Okay, wait
Hang the phone up, now
She puts the phone handset back to her ear
Oh, great
Now they-they hung up on us
Good, good
He takes the handset from her hand and slams it down
Oh, great
Let's get out

want to go back to bed
No, just let me think for a second, now
Waldron, right
Helen Moss
Okay
He used the name Tom, right
So, Tom Waldron
We gotta run a check on that
Run a check on it
What, do you want to beat it down to the morgue
You got all the jargon
Come on
She walks away from the phone table
Where are you going
Right
'  -  - Carol enters the bedroom, followed by Larry
'm not a night person
don't wanna be
What are you
don't know what 'm looking for
Oh, oh, wait
Look
She starts looking through the mail scattered on a table
What
What do you wanna do, go through the guy's mail
This is insane
He starts looking through the mail
What do you mean
Oh, my
As he takes some more letters, Larry hits a small porcelain statuette, and drops it on the floor, where it breaks
He bends down to pick up the debris
Jesus
Oh, Christ
What are you do
Well, just
Clean it up, Larry
Clean it up
Larry stands up
What do you mean, clean it up
What am  gonna do, vacuum
Put it under the rug, or something like that, okay

It's a wall-to-wall carpet

He looks at the porcelain pieces in his hands
Well then glue it
Glue it back to
She moves around the room

So what
Gloves

Uh
Let's get out of here, because this is a

It's eye of the beholder
What you have

He pushes her toward the exit of the room
What
Look, 'm gonna take the pieces with us, and we'll-we'll get rid of them

On the right, a counter with an attendant behind the counter
Facing us the entrance of the main room
Carol, Larry, and their son Nick, are coming out of the room
Nick must be in his early twenties
So, how did you like your birthday cake, Nick
loved it,

loved
But then again,  love chocolate anything, so
The camera moves around the three people as they walk toward the cloakroom
know
Right

Larry walks across the lobby, because he has seen someone he knows in the sitting-room
He waves his hand and comes back to his wife and his son
Hi
Hey,  want you to meet somebody

The camera pans around, to show us Marcia crossing the sitting- room
want you to meet somebody

Because, yeah

They walk out of the club
- -   - This is very nice lounge in New-York, very tastefully decorated
It looks like one of those old English Club in London
Beautiful paintings on the walls, and even stained glasses on the windows
This is where the wine-tasting is taking place
The camera pans around the room
We see people talking while holding wine-glasses
We hear Ted and Carol's conversation without seeing them yet
(voice over) That Mouton 45
That was

Flattered

He stands up and bumps into a low table in front of the sofa
See you
Oops, careful
Whoops
Sorry
Excuse me
Excuse me
Carol looks at him walking away with a strange expression in her eyes
- -       - Medium tracking shot of Ted walking on the sidewalk, coming from the lounge and toward us
Medium low-angle shot of one of the window of the lounge, seen from the street
This shot is low-angled because the lounge is located slightly above street level
Carol is seated in front of the window, looking very pensive
She takes a sip of her glass of wine
She looks absently though the window
- -   - The street seen through the window, next to which Carol is seated, but we don't actually see Carol
We see a big car, followed by a bus
The camera zooms on the bus
Through one of the bus windows, we see a woman, seated inside the bus
And this woman looks very much like the deceased Lilian, Paul's wife
- -       - Close shot on the window, in front of which Carol is seated
She looks at the passing bus, with a wide open mouth, and a surprised, almost frightened, expression on her face
She stands up a little and then sits back
- -   - Full view of the room
In the background, Carol, still seated by the window
She stands up, picks up her purse, and starts crossing the room, bumping into people
She reaches the staircase, and walks downstairs
- -       - Full view on the entrance of the lounge
Carol is walking rapidly down the stairs leading to the entrance
She reaches the sidewalk, and looks around her for the bus
She walks away from the lounge and toward us, with the camera on a tracking shot in front of her
'  -  - Medium shot of Larry working in the kitchen, putting things away in the cupboards
Behind him, we see the front hall
The front door opens and Carol walks in
got a great sweater at Brooks Brothers' today for Nick, today
Carols closes the door and leans on the wall
But Larry doesn't seem to understand that something is wrong with her
He walks away to the sitting room
He keeps on talking in voice over, while Carol is still leaning on the wall of the front hall
(voice over) Really beautiful
It's cashmere
Very expensive
The kid looked so handsome in it, though
Also,  decided 'd cook dinner tonight
My one dish tuna casserole
Larry comes back in the kitchen and looks at his wife, but still doesn't seem to notice that something is wrong
We follow Larry into the sitting-room
'  - - - Larry is setting the table for dinner (voice over) Well, no wonder he had her cremated
What
(voice over) Mrs
House
Oh, Jesus
You're not about Mrs
House again
thought we'd have a light dinner, you know, because we had a rich lunch at Twenty-One,  thought
The camera pans to Carol standing at the entrance of the room and leaning on the wall Larry
(voice over) What
just saw Mrs
House
(voice over) What are you talking about
The ashes
No, no, no
bus
It passed me, and she was on it
Larry joins Carol
Uh, the dead woman passed you on a bus
Which bus was this, the bus to heaven
Larry walks away toward the kitchen
Carol follows him
No, but 'm not, 'm not joking
mean, 'm telling you something
'm telling you,  really saw her
actually saw her
'  -  - Larry is checking his cooking
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Yeah
Larry takes two wine-glasses out of the sink
You want to lie down for a while
We'll put a cold compress on your head, or a hot compress on your back, or
No, Larry, you know,  was at the wine-tasting, right
And was just
was sitting at, you know, a bay window
- happened to look out
bus passed, and she was on it, Larry
Remember  said to you
Yes, remember  said to you, spit it out
said don't drink it
You said you were going to a wine- tasting
But
You said you were going to taste wine all afternoon said spit it out
Yeah
said don't swallow it
You swallowed it
And that's why you're this way
know
know
Okay
-
Yeah
had a few drinks, but it's-it's not
mean,  saw her
Larry puts the glasses away on the dinner table
Yeah,  'm sure you saw her
How could you see her
She's dead
Not only is she dead, she's been cremated
It's not even Halloween
They walk into the sitting-room
'  - - - Okay
Are you telling me that you
That, that, that, that you
That  didn't see her
Is that what you're saying
think it's a pretty fair assumption that if a person is dead, they don't suddenly turn up in the New York City transit system
just
just don't know what's happening, Larry
-- don't know what's going on
What's going on
What's
yeah
Let me put it this way : total psychotic breakdown
Okay
Is that enough
Maybe, look
Maybe she's a twin
That's possible
Now forget this
Why
Taste my tuna casserole
Tell me if  put in too much hot fudge
He opens the dish he had put earlier on the table
Honey, you're getting so close-minded these days
just
The phone rings
Oh
Oh, God
She picks up the phone from the wall
Larry sits at the table
Hallo
Ted
Ted
Oh, Ted
Ted
Ted, you're not going to believe this, but, Ted,  saw Mrs
House
Yes, Mrs
House
Yeah
Mrs
the murdered woman
That's right
Larry opens the red wine bottle and pours some wine in his glass
She wasn't murdered
It was a coronary
It was a coronary, folks
It was a coronary
She wasn't murdered
don't know what they're talking about
Yeah
No, 'm sure
'm sure  saw her
She was on a bus, you know

Larry puts the cork back on the bottle
He was at the wine tasting, too
Sure, why not
Would you
They're both at the wine tasting
Would you really
Oh, that would be so great
You'd just run a check on Paul and Lillian House
Larry stands up and walks toward Carol
Don't run a check
Don't run a check
He takes the phone from Carol's hand
What are you talking
Stop
What are you doing
mean
Larry talks to Ted on the phone
Listen, could you call back later, because my marriage is falling apart
He puts the phone down
Larry, what are you
But, what
Forget it
Will you
If you're gonna have an affair with the guy, you don't need a murder to do it
'm telling you,  saw Mrs
House
Larry sits back at the table
Yes,  know, on the bus, the dead persons' bus
No car fare
s
Okay
Now, sit down
Let's
Now look
Just

Yeah, 'm not going to see the exact spot

She walks away toward the front hall
mean, 'm telling you, 'm just vibrating from this mean,  saw this woman
Will you eat something
We've got tickets to the theatre
Carol comes back into the room
What
Wh
'm not going to the theatre
(voice over) What do you mean you're not go
We've been holding onto these tickets for two months, now
Carol walks again to the front hall and comes back toward the sitting room, via the kitchen
Do you comprehend the enormity of what 'm telling you, Larry
Do you compr
(voice over) If you got a big story, tell it to the Police
Don't tell it to me
What am  going to say to them
Tell them your story
Tell them this whole cockamamie story
What story

mean,  got nothing
Unless
Oh
That's right
That's right, you've got nothing
Unless
Unless  locate her
Yeah, okay, good
Now, will you sit down because we're going to the theater
don't care what you say
She takes a drink on water in the kitchen
'  -  - Medium shot of Larry and Carol coming out of the lift
They cross the lobby
Jack, the caretaker of the building in standing near the entrance of the building
Oh, Jack
Jack
You-you were there when Mrs
House died, right
You saw her
Right
Yeah
You saw her lying there, right
Yes, she was lying on the floor
You said
Yeah, but

Right
Right
You know,

Okay, look
Yeah, yeah
Larry gives some banknotes to Jack
Yeah, this is, this is for all the times  call you to fix the faucet, and you show up six months late
Thanks
-   - Full shot of the audience watching the show
We hear music
In the forefront, Carol and Larry
Larry is taping his chin with the program
Carol turns toward Larry and starts whispering
The super is a drunk
know, but, we've seen him smelling of Jack Daniel's, remember
Yeah, but
mean,  know he didn't see Mrs
House, Larry
If she's a twin, it's a different story
But you don't seem to feel she is, so
Well,  don't know
Oh,  know
Unless he's in on it
Who's in on it
The super
The super can't change a fuse
The lady, sitting next to Larry, just gave the couple a bad look, and Carol taps on Larry's arm
Shh
Shh
short pause
mean, she
What
Well, she's alive
And my question is, who was in that bag
mean, somebody
She's not alive, unless she's a twin
Okay
Now keep quiet
Look, somebody
Somebody got cremated, Larry
Somebody
Shut up
- -       - Long shot of Ted and Carol walking toward us in a quiet street
Actually it is the street where the wine-tasting lounge is located, and, of course, the street where Carol saw the bus with Lilian on board of it
They walk near the entrance of the National Arts Club
Ted is holding a small notebook and looking at what is has written in it
Lillian House
Right
Uh, maiden name, Lillian Beagle
Born in Carlyle, Pennsylvania, nineteen-thirty-five
Married Paul Richard House
Right,  know
She was not a twin
Had an older sister who
So goes Larry's theory
Uh, went to England twenty years ago, and an older brother who died in nineteen-eighty-seven
Carol stops in front of the building next to the National Arts Club
It is the building where they had the wine-tasting session the day before
Right here
This is it
This is where we were
The camera tilts up to show the window behind which Carol was sitting the day before
(voice over) This is where we were
know
And  was sitting right here, after you left
The camera tilts back down to Ted and Carol
Right
And  was having a glass of, you kn-you know, wine, and looked out the window, and-and  saw the
right here
Carol shows Ted the spot where she saw the bus
You saw her after  left
Yes,  saw
her on a bus
It was passing
You
It was, like
She walks in the middle of the street
Wait a minute
Are you
You're absolutely sure you saw her
You saw her face
'm positive - saw her
car is honking
Carol, still standing in the middle of the street, moves out of the way of the car
Whoo
Excuse me
-'m telling you, Ted
Ted joins Carol in the middle of the street
What was the number of the bus
Uh,  don't know what the number of the bus was, but  know that it was heading west to east, so it was
it obviously was a cross-town bus
All right
Okay, look, look
It's a cross-town bus
They walk to the sidewalk on the other side of the street, where the park is located
Right
Okay, so look
The end of the line is a few blocks down there
So, okay
So, then, it's like
So, she
She had to get off somewhere
somewhere
Then
Her destination was probably within the next five or six blocks
They start walking on the sidewalk, going the way where they first came from
Yeah, right
So, let's, let's look around
Let's, we, we'll see some, you know, uh, like a, like a, you know
clue, or something
Or something
Maybe we'll see her
You're sure you saw her face
Don't, don't doubt me, okay
Okay, okay, okay
No, no, no, no
'm-'m not kidding
Look
- -    - This is not a nice area anymore
It is a wide dingy-looking avenue, with the nearest buildings very far away and a road bridge over the street
And it is raining
Long shot of the avenue, with Carol and Ted walking further away
Oh, God
Well,  think, you know,  think we've reached the end of the line
think this is it
bus is coming toward them
Look
The bus
The bus slows down
don't think
there's noth
Watch out
Watch out
Ted pushes Carol so she doesn't get soaked by the bus driving very close to the sidewalk and into the pools of rain
Yeah, what
Oh
Whoo
The bus makes a -turn on the avenue
Yeah, look
See
See, he's turning
That's it
Yeah,  know
That's all there is, here
Well, what do you think
What
Do you think we should retrace our steps
- -       - They are back in the same street where the wine-tasting place is located
Full shot of the park across the street, seen across the thick vertical bars of the railings that surround the park
Ted and Carol are walking on a lane in the park
You-you wear a tie with a dress
It's a
It's a very special
The camera follows Ted and Carol, moving on the other side of the railings
No,  don't think it looks good, and  don't even know if it looks
mean,  feel like it'd be to masculine if wore it with a pair of pants
Oh, it'd look great on you
No, no, just don't wear it with pants
Oh
With pants, it's-it's
what
Carol has just stopped walking, and she is looking at something on the other side of the railings
Ted, look
At what
What
The camera pans around to a reverse angle shot of the other side of the street
It stops on a building
On the awning above the entrance of the building is written : Hotel Waldron
The camera stops on that shot and doesn't move anymore
(voice over) That hotel
(voice over) What about it
(voice over) Well, that's
the Waldron
mean,  thou
- was in his apartment,  pressed the number
last number dialed, and
(voice over) You're kidding

And said
Waldron
(voice over) Let's-Let's-Let's get to a phone
Let's get to a phone
Let's call up
You got a quarter
Medium shot of Ted talking into the handset of a pay-phone on the street
Hallo
Mrs
House, please
Mrs
Mrs
House
Can you ring her room for me, please
The camera pans to Carol, standing in the street near Ted
Really
Well
What
Maybe
Well, maybe she checked out
No-nobody, nobody at all
Uh
What about
Wh-What about
Yeah, what about, uh, Helen Moss, Moss
You're sure
Nobody

All-All right
All right, okay
'm sorry
All right
Thank you

Great
Oh, God
It looks like it's gonna rain again
Well
- Full shot on a restaurant
This part of the restaurant is empty
Only two people, Larry and Marcia, are seated at a table behind a set of crossed wooden bars, on the other side of which the camera is located
Apparently Marcia is teaching Larry how to play poker
Marcia wears sunglasses and has a cigarette stuck between her lips
If  get two kings,  take one
Otherwise,  fold
So
Got it
- never go out
---- just,  can't take can't
Marcia shuffles the cards
That's how you wind up on welfare
The camera pans away from the two players to another section of the restaurant, where a few people are still eating
It looks like a very good restaurant, with waiters dressed with white shirt and black vest
(voice over) You know,  need the action, for some reason
- can't
bet anything
Okay, just
(voice over) Cut
(voice over) No, no, go ahead,  trust you
Lay it on me
The camera pans back on Larry and Marcia
This is a different shot, with the camera in front of their table
Marcia seems very relaxed with the cards in her hands, when Larry seems quite nervous
He holds the card very close to his eyes, seeming afraid that his partner will look at them
You seem in a strange mood
No, no, no
'm just probably just a little drunk
On Perrier
No
What are you talking about
had rum cake
Want any cards
Larry shuffles his cards in his hand, hesitating on his next move
Uh, one second
Just let me, let me see, see what , possibilities  got here
Uh, yeah
'm gonna have, uh
'll have, uh
'm gonna have four cards
Four
Yeah
She gives him his four cards
Cruising for a bruising
Inside and outside straight
Marcia looks at her cards
Larry keeps shuffling his cards very nervously
You're in trouble, now
You know,  can't escape the feeling that my-my wife is becoming attracted to somebody else
and it's really bothering me
Really
Yeah
That's why 'm not playing my best
This guy is, you know, more adventurous than  am, and for some reason they just seem to hit it off
'm gonna be very lonely if, uh, you know, if this happens
You must love her a lot
Yeah,  do
do
Um
if you want to hold on to her, you have to make some effort
mean, who's the guy
Uh, Ted
The guy that  fixed you up with
Ted
Yeah
Well, we could always switch
Ted gets Carol,  can be your date
Maybe-Maybe  should actually make a greater effort with- with Carol
- -      - Full shot of the entrance of the Waldron Hotel
The pavement is wet but it doesn't seem to rain anymore
The camera pans to a car parked on the other side of the street a short distance from the hotel
This is Larry's car, with Larry seated behind the wheel and Carol seated on the passenger's seat
Medium shot of the inside of the car, seen through the open window
So, you bored
mean
Well, it's more fun than the Wagner opera
Yeah
Well, to me,  mean, just
mean, it's just one of the most exciting adventures 've ever been on
Would you rather be here with Ted
Well-Well, he has a more enthused attitude, Larry
More enthused
Yeah, enthused, yeah
Well, he's a fun guy
He's a light guy, 'm a heavy guy
Well,
You know, Ted-Ted would be fun on a scavenger hunt
No, look
Larry, you used to be a lot of fun
You know, he's the guy you want if you have a really heavy scavenger hunt
He's the man
know, well, but, y-you know
You used to
Do you know that this neighborhood was where  first took you out on a date when we-we first started going out
What
don't know
don't know
Just for some reason, you've gotten so stodgy in your old age, you know
Hey, you remember there was a movie house right on this corner
No,  know
Yes
Yeah,  remember
Not to change the subject
You know,
took you to see Last year at Marienbad on our first date
Yeah,  know
had to explain it to you for the next six months
Who knew they were flashbacks
You know
Look, Larry
Look
We've got plenty of time to be conservative
You know what 'm saying
Don't you see
The camera starts moving around the car
It's to me, it's like this-this tantalizing plum has just, like dropped into our laps
mean, life is just such a dull routine and here we are, right
mean, we're on the threshold of a genuine mystery
mean, to me, the whole thing is like
It's
Hey, no
The camera stops moving on another medium shot, where we still see Larry through his open window, but we see Carol only through the wet windshield
Are you gonna burst into a song, here
We're in a car
Just don't make fun of me, okay
Because 'm open to new experiences
Let me ask you a personal question, here
Yeah
Did you ever sleep with Ted
Sleep
Don't get nervous
Yeah
Yeah, you guys
What, are you nuts
We were on an eating tour of France, together
Yeah
You two guys spent an evening, you know, together
Yeah, right
We sp
At that place, you know

Yeah, but what about you
Remember
You spent the evening with Julie
Am  right
You spent the night, and shared a
That meant absolutely nothing
She hated me
Julie despised me
What
You know that
She-She thought  was a low-life and a wimp and a vermin and a roach
Just-Just jump in anytime you want to defend me, you know
Hey,  mean, 'm waiting for you to say something  don't agree with, okay
Ho-ho
Hey, you're nailing me
Jesus
He stops smiling because he just saw something in front of his car, something we don't yet see, because the camera hasn't moved from its position
Oh
Larry
Yeah
The camera starts panning very rapidly toward the entrance of the hotel
(voice over) Larry, Larry, look
It's her

No, 'm not afraid
You're not afraid of Mrs
House
She's an old woman and 'm a virile male

And yet somehow  am scared

Maybe because she's dead
You know

Larry gets out of the car

Medium shot of a clerk cleaning the lobby floor with a broom
She is a woman in her forties, very casually dressed with a flowered blouse and a beige sweater, and with uncombed hair hanging on her shoulders
The camera pans around toward the street door
Carol enters the lobby, followed by Larry
Carol is holding a small present-wrapped parcel in her hand and walks toward the clerk
Uh, excuse me
Hi
Hi
Um, we were just wondering
Uh, did you see a woman come in
She was, uh, she was a little woman, about five foot three

He gives the parcel back to Carol
Oh
Yes, that's right
What room
Uh, six-eleven
Six-eleven
Really, thanks a lot
Okay
Sure
Carols walks away, but Larry stays with the clerk
He takes a banknote out of his pocket
Yeah, we-we may need some information, while we're here, so-so, we just want you to know
'll take very good care of you, if you play ball with us
He gives the banknote to the clerk, who seems a bit surprised by Larry's attitude and present
She looks at the banknote
What are you making that face for
He's the father of our country
(voice over) Will you come on
Larry walks toward Carol, who is waiting for the elevator
'm coming, 'm coming
Come on
What're you doing

Carol walks out, followed by Larry, who closes the door
Carol starts looking around for room numbers
The camera follows them Okay
Um, six-eleven
Six-oh-seven
The camera stops at the beginning of a long narrow corridor
Carol and Larry walk along the corridor, away from the camera
Huh
Very nice
love a hotel that's got lots of blue powder sprinkled along the baseboard
Six-eleven
Here, Larry
All right
They have stopped walking at the end of the corridor, in front of a door
Carol knocks on that door
Um, Mrs
House

House
Carol knocks louder on the door, helped by Larry
Under Larry's fist, the door opens slowly

(voice over) -Mrs
House
(voice over) Hallo
Carol enters the room, followed by Larry
Hallo
Mrs
Hou
don't
don't
My God,  don't
don't think she's
The camera starts panning around the room, up to the window, then starts panning back toward Carol and Larry
(voice over) don't see her
(voice over) This may not be the right-right place
(voice over) Just hold on, Larry
Hold on, hold on, hold on
The camera is back on Carol and Larry
Larry is looking inside a closet
There's nothing here
He closes the closet door
Carol yells
Ahhh
Larry
She runs to the beds and look down on the floor between the two twin beds
She drops the parcel on the floor
What's the matter
Oh, my God
Wait a minute
Oh, Jesus
Carol kneels down on the floor, bending on something she just saw on the floor
The camera follows her movement and we see a human hand resting on the floor, the rest of the body being hidden by one of the bed
Oh, my God, look
Mrs
House
Mrs
House
What's the matter
Hallo
What-What-What
Mrs
Oh, Larry

Oh, my God
'm thinking of running the Boston marathon
They both start running out of the room
Oh, God
Okay, oh God
This woman is forever dying
-    - Same shot of the long corridor as before
We see Carol and Larry coming out Room 611 and running toward us
Come on, come on
Move, move
Adrenaline is leaking out of my ears
They reach the end of the corridor, and the camera follows them as they run around the corner of the hallway
Get down those stairs
They don't use the elevator and instead run down the stairs
Okay, all right
Come on, come on
Quickly
- -      - Long shot of the entrance of the hotel, seen from the other side of the street
blue police car is parked in front of the hotel
Two plainclothes police officers and one uniformed policeman are talking with Carol and Larry
They both try to explain the situation to the police officers
But since they both talk together, the police officers have a hard time understanding them
While they are talking, the camera zooms forward from a long shot to a full shot of the group
(talking together with Larry) And then, you see, what happened was  suspected Mr
House, right
He's a
He runs a movie house
But-But then what hap
We're sit

And
And she has
no place at all
Then we checked anyway
So we were just sitting there, just waiting
(talking together with Carol) We-We-We were there
She-She was very nervous
So-So we were going to the movies, and, and, and we were walking and looking around the place
And then suddenly she's a
Her hand is on the floor
You could see it on the side of the bed
She was lying there, she was sort of
like blue in the face
The girl was nervous
tried to keep calm, as best as  could
One of the plainclothes police officers stops their talking
There's nobody up there
There's what
What do you mean, there's nobody up
There's nobody
Wait a minute, wait
There's no body there
We-We saw
We just saw her there
She's lying on the floor
We

He starts climbing the few steps to the entrance of the hotel, followed by Carol and Larry
The other police officer remains on the sidewalk
She was totally dead
We
She's there
Wait, wait
-  611 - Medium close shot of an uniformed policeman, different from the one we just saw in the street
(voice over) She was right here
She was lying, like, right this-a-way
(voice over) Yeah, she was definitely laying here
The camera pans from the uniformed policeman to the two police officers talking with Carol and Larry in the middle of the room
The following dialogue transcript separates what Larry says from what Carol says, but, most of the time, they talk together at the same time, making it quite difficult for us, or for the police officers, to follow their conversation
Because,  mean, she was, she was there, do you understand
The camera tilts down on one of the police officers looking under the bed
The
-Yes
She was
It looked like she was strangled, or something
Not-Not that 'm an expert on violent death, because  wouldn't know
We're-We're two professional people
Right, 'm a
- work at Harper's
Yeah
'm in publishing
Yeah, that's right, and 'm-'m looking to start a little restaurant, basically French, although international cuisine would be fine
Not that  really have a location
Right, she's a fantastic cook
But, uh, 'm against the restaurant, myself, but-but she's a wonderful cook
Calm down
Calm down
Please
Okay, just
Look, obviously what happened is, in the time it took you guys to respond
somebody came here and removed the body
Not that you didn't respond quickly, you know, you were here fast
It took-took you three minutes, not-not-not counting the half-hour that the operator 911 took to understand what  was saying
Nobody is doubting you, okay
We're going over the whole building, all right
All right
- -      - Medium shot of Carol, Larry, the first plainclothes police officer and the uniformed policeman we first saw in the street
Uh, did you check
Mr
House
The second plainclothes police officer joins the group
He's been at his place of business all day
Any witnesses
Yeah, b
Uh-huh, backed up and corroborated
Yeah, but you didn't use our names, or anything like that, did you
No, we didn't
No, okay
don't know
If you think you saw his wife, shouldn't you tell him
No, 'm
No,  mean, he's in some sort of scheme, here
It's
We think you should calm down and file a report
It's not
Oh
This way, if anything turns up, we got it on record
He gives his business card to Larry
All right
Take a card, give us a call, have a good day
Thank you
Thanks very much
Bye-bye
The two police officers walk away with the uniformed policeman
Larry looks at the card in his hand
Thanks very much
Oh, man,  don't know how we're gonna
Jesus,  gotta have a drink
gotta calm myself
need fourteen Zanacks or something
Where is Ted
just don't understand where Ted is mean, you know, all this stuff is happening
They start walking away on the sidewalk, while the police officers are climbing in their car
Ted
Ted-Ted's, you know, he's got his date with Marcia Fox tonight
He's probably out buying some Spanish Fly
Do you think Helen Moss might be in on this
Helen
don't know and
think so
don't want to know about this
think we should change our lives
No, think about it
We should move out of that stupid apartment, you know
You know, start over maybe in Mexico
No, no, no
You know, sell blankets
We'll work off the hood of a car or something

Rows of table on either side of the room, each table surrounded by beige imitation- leather twin seats
Another row of table in the middle of the room, with chairs around them
Huge electrical fans hanging from the ceiling
The camera pans on the left to a medium shot of the table around which Larry and Carol are seated
They are drinking beer
'm just beginning to calm down
'm telling you,  didn't know what's happening
It was like one of those television shows, where you open the door, and you see a-a dead body
You know,  always hated those shows
Yeah
You know, 've never seen a dead person before in my whole life
The only one  ever saw was my uncle Morris, who was ninety-four years old
Yeah
He collapsed from too many lumps in his cereals
Larry, is this the most exciting thing that's ever happened to us in our whole marriage
This is too exciting
don't need this
You know,  like something quiet
like a fishing trip, a Father's day, you know, or, the time we saw Bing Crosby walking on 5th avenue
You know,  don't need a murder to enliven my life at all
You know, whoever did it was probably still in the room while we were there
Probably hiding in the closet
Make sure and tell me that just before  go to sleep, tonight
That'll be good for me
But you know, that probably means he saw us
Great, 'll never get my eyes closed
You know,  mean, what do you want me to do
'm petrified
Not only that, but 'm a little drunk
wonder who was cremated
Who was it
Well, it was
Well
You know, obviously, it wasn't Mr
House, because he has an alibi
Well, yeah, but  don't buy that
She doesn't buy that
She doesn't buy the alibi
Let's get out of here
want to go home
- -      - Full shot of Carol and Larry walking toward us
It is very dark and the sidewalks are wet from a recent rain
Jesus, it's starting to rain again
Can you believe that
Oh, God
If only Ted were with us, he'd have a million theories about this, 'll tell you that
Yeah,  know
know
Ted's got a mind like a steel sieve
Oh, right
The camera hasn't moved, so now we get a medium shot of Larry and Carol
They have reached their car, and Carol walks around it to get into the passenger's seat
You know what  think
think it's possible
That hotel room was on the, on the ext
That end of the hall
The camera tilts up the facade of the Waldron Hotel
(voice over) What
Yeah
(voice over) It's right up there
That's the room
(voice over) know
(voice over) Well, what if they got the body out over that little roof
You know, that would be a possibility
Why would
The two windows, which Larry is pointing at, suddenly get lit
(voice over) Ohhh
What are the lights
(voice over) Oh, Jesus
The camera tilts back down to street level
Larry and Carol are around their car, ready to climb in
Larry, the lights
Yeah, that's eerie, isn't it
My God
This gave me the chills, honey
Yeah, well, let's call the police
mean
Oh, no, no, no
Come on
Let's go over there now
Let's check it out
Come on
We don't have time
Check it out
Yes
What, are you nuts
No, 'm not gonna check that out
No, but look at it, Larry
Look at that
There's lights going on, there
Yeah,  know,  know
That's crazy
Look, look
Why don't we go home and nap, and we'll call the police, and they can check it out while we're home in the
Carol walks away from the car toward the hotel
Oh, no, the police are red tape
Come on
This is my case, honey
Larry catches up with her
The camera remains on the sidewalk, looking at the couple walking toward the hotel
What do you mean, it's your case
Yes, it's my case
Hey, come here
don't want to do this
No, come on
No
Oh, God
If only Ted were with us
Hey, don't give me Ted
Ted would be shaking in his boots
Ted
Oh, God
'm at least just trembling like a leaf
They have reached the hotel and they are climbing the steps to the entrance of the hotel
-  - Medium close shot on a window set in the wall of the lobby
Behind the window, the night clerk is sorting some paper
There is a grill in the window, to allow people to to talk to the clerk
Carol and Larry walk to the window
Um, excuse me
We're with the Police department
We'd like to, uh, check out room, uh, six-eleven, please
Larry tries to play the part of the relaxed policeman doing his job, but he overdoes it and he looks more bizarre than serious
You were here before
Uh, that's right
Yes
Mm-hm
Yeah
You are Police
Ee
Ooh, um, just, uh-uh
Show him your card
My what
Your-Your card
Your-Your Police identification card
Yeah, -
Your card, you know
Your card
He's got his card
Larry goes through the pockets of his jacket and gets the business card the police officer gave him
He shows it to the clerk and then slides it through a small rectangular hole at the bottom of the window
The clerk takes it and looks at it
Yeah
See
Okay
The clerk gives the card back to Carol
Thank you very much
Six-eleven
Okay
Great
The clerks goes and gets the key of the room
He gives it to Carol, who drops the card on the small counter under the window
Is there any trouble
No, no, no, no, no
-m-'m-'m-'m j
'm-'m ju
um
'm a detective
They-They-They lowered the height requirements, so
'll take this card back
They-re, they're
He takes the card from the counter and puts it back in the inside pocket of his jacket
Come on
expensive
Carol walks toward the elevator and Larry follows her
-    - As before, the camera is located at one end of the long corridor, showing Larry and Carol at the other end of the corridor ready to enter Room 611
Larry keeps looking around while Carol is opening the door
-  611 - Full shot of the room with the door in the background
The door is opening slowly
Carol enters the room, followed by Larry Okay
Be careful
Telling me to be careful
Now, just don't upset anything
Okay, Larry
Larry closes the door
'm not upsetting anything
just, you know, 'm just gonna leave a-a set of fingerprints around, so if there's a trial, we can get trapped
The camera follows Carol and Larry moving around the room
All right, now look
The murderer must have, like, hid in this closet, right
Carol opens a closet
don't like this
Carol gives a quick peek inside the closet, and then closes it
Right, and then he must have
Let's go
You know, 've got to get up early tomorrow
've got to be in temple
Okay, he must have dragged the b
The body out, really fast
What
We hear a click coming from the door of the room
Shhh
Larry picks up a metal lamp from the floor and hides behind a closet in front of the door with Carol behind him
The door opens and the cleaning lady walks in with her bucket and things
Larry is ready to hit her, but, when he realizes who she is, he drops the lamp
The cleaning lady yells
Ahhh
Oh, Jesus
What
'm sorry, 'm sorry
'm
Didn't mea
-, oh, it's- It's-It's a
Oh, hi
Larry opens the door and pushes the lady out of the room
You don't have to turn the bed out
It's not necessary
And no-no-no croissants tomorrow for breakfast
He takes some money out of his pocket and gives it to her
Here, here
Here, take this for yourself
like the towels
Keep the little mints coming on the pillow, uh
He closes the door
Oh, Jesus
Larry
mean, really
Let's go
That's why the light was on
This is crazy, we're gonna get in trouble
Just a second, Larry
Let me just look around here, just a little bit
Larry picks up the lamp which is broken in two pieces
Oh, look
did damage
Now
'll be sued
(voice over) Oh
Larry
That's what
Carol comes back to Larry, holding something small in her hand
Larry, look
Look
thinks that's her wedding band, Larry
How do you know
How do  know
saw it on her
You did
Yeah
Jesus
think so
So much for the police combing every inch of this place
Where did you find it
found it behind the door, right there
Oh, brother
Let's get out of here, come on
And take the ring with you
Maybe there's a pawnshop open
Okay
Okay
Larry opens the door and they walk out of the room
-   - Medium shot inside the cabin
The elevator is moving down
Didn't  tell you the police weren't thorough
mean they probably thought we were cranks, right
mean, we got no body, and
mean, they must get fifty crisis calls a minute
Why would they bother with us
don't know
just know, this is very deep stuff
Just
We should not be here
'm scared, this is creepy
You know what  mean
This goes
this could be
Who knows who's involved in this
This could go very deep, Carol
This could be like, you know, like with the Warren commission, or something
don't like it
Oh, not the Warren Commission
There is a loud noise and the elevator suddenly stops
Oh, my God
Jesus
What is that
Wait a minute
Okay, all right, now look
All right
The- the elevator's probably stuck
Why are we stopping
Why are we stopping
Relax now, Larry
Carol starts punching all the buttons on the control panel
Don't tell me to relax
'm-'m-'m a-a world-renowned claustrophobic
It's okay
It's okay, everything's going to be fine
Stop
Hit something
am hitting it
don't like this,  don't,  don't
know,  know
It's okay
It's easy for you to say, but  can't breathe, 'm phobic
The-the idea is, there's plenty of air, in this elevator
Uh, Larry, relax
Now, if you just don't panic, okay
Don't panic, all right
'm not panicking, 'm not panicking, 'm
Now, just don't worry
'm just going to say the rosary, now
Somebody'll help us
Somebody's gonna help us
Somebody'll find us here

She hits the door with the palms of her hands
Oh,  don't know,  don't like this
Hello
Say something

Boost me up, and we'll get out there

Yes we can

She puts a foot on Larry's hands
Wait a second
Wait, wait
Close shot on Larry's distorted face
We see Carol's body going up
Oh, Jesus, you've got to cut down on those rich desserts
Oh, wait a minute, now
Oh, just wait
Wait, wait
Let's go, my life is passing in front of my eyes
The worst part of it is, 'm driving a used car
Okay, now you'd think they'd loosen this stupid thing
Medium close shot on the ceiling of the cabin
Carol is trying to open a trap above the ceiling lamp
'm scared
The trap opens, and Lilian House's body comes out
Carol yells and falls down on the floor
The upper part of the body is hanging out of the trap, with its arms moving around
Oh, my God
Oh, my God
It's her
The camera tilts down to floor level and Larry and Carol
So that's where he hid her
Oh, Jesus
Claustrophobia and a dead body
This is a neurotic's jackpot
Suddenly, the lights switch off
The cabin is now pitch dark
Oh
Oh, Larry, hold on
'm scared
We hear the noise of the elevator starting again
We're going down
Oh, God
What's happening
We're going down
Oh, God, press up
Press up
Press up
can't see my hand
How can  press up
Jesus
We must be heading for the basement, Larry
The basement
want to get off in the mezzanine
'm returning shoes
It's dark in here
We hear the noise of the elevator door opening
What
What are you doing
Apparently Carol has come out of the elevator
-  - This shot is supposed to be in the basement of the hotel, but since it is still pitch dark, we can't tell the difference
Where are you
'm getting back on the elevator
don't care
don't know where
Larry
- can't see anything
There's nothing out there
Wait a minute
What are you doing
Larry lights a match, and we see his scared face lit by the flame of the match
Hey, what are you doing with matches
Th-Th-These are my matches
got them at
Wait a minute, what
When were you at the Cafe des Artistes
Larry blows the match, because it is burning his fingers
Look

Yeah,  was with an author
An authoress
At-at the
At
At the Cafe des Artistes

French, a French authoress
An author
He lights another match
We very dimly see the basement walls around them
Wait
Shh
Shh
Shh
Jesus
Try this way
Medium full shot of Carol and Larry walking toward us in a corridor
Beside the light of the match, there is some other dim light coming from somewhere in the basement
like a basement with-with knotty pine and a pool table
You know, where you can
Hey, look, look, look, look
Uh-huh
They are now in close shot
What
What
What's this
No, wait a minute
Not so fast
don't like it here, it's dank
The camera turns around to follow them in the corridor
All right
And there's strange noises
don't know what this is don't know
This
We hear a loud metallic bang
Oh, Jesus
Calm down
Calm down
Don't tell me to calm down
There
Turn the light on
Larry switches the light on
They are in a room with beige walls
There are pots of paint stacked behind Larry
This
Wh-Wh

What do you
Let me see
Carol tries to open a door near Larry, but it is locked
Where
There
Oh
We're locked in here
What are you gonna do
Oh, relax, relax, relax
Don't
'll break it down
Stand back
Larry walks back a few steps and rushes on the door, trying to break it open
Careful, now
Don't worry
Just-Just give me a second
He does it another time
Don't hurt yourself
Must be one of those new doors
Let's try out here
Carol points to another room opening in the one they are in
Carol and Larry are now walking in a lit corridor
Oh, my god
keep hearing noises
Oh
What's down there
Carol walks rapidly toward a dark section of the corridor
The camera follows her
Where
Where you
Where are you going
Don't leave me
Let me see
It's okay
What
Oh
She has reached a door with a barred window showing the street outside
Yeah
think this is it
think this is the service entrance
She tries to open the door, but it is a bit stuck
Well, come on
'm trying
Come on, get it open
Carol succeeds in opening the door
got it
got it
Go into a trot
They rush outside
- -      - Long shot on the dark street
At a distance, we see a man putting a large oblong-shaped parcel in the trunk of a car
The man looks very much like Paul
The camera pans around to give us a reverse-angle medium shot of Carol and Larry coming out of the basement of the hotel
They stopped in the middle of the short staircase
Wait
Wait
Did you see that
What
It looks like somebody's putting a body into a car
Jesus
swear
Look
It's got a white sheet on it
Yes
Right
Yeah
Come on
Carol walks on to the sidewalk, followed by a very frightened Larry
It is
Oh, brother
The camera pans back around to give us a reverse-angle shot of the car leaving the curb of the street
(voice over) Let's-Let's-Let's get out of here
Let's get out of here

Wait
No, look
Let's-Let's follow him

It's-It's probably-It's probably a rented car
They have reached their car and they start climbing into it, Larry still on the driver's side
There
Oh
And a rented body
Hurry up
Come on
They slam the doors, switch the headlights on and start
- -      - The camera starts with the interchange at one end of the bridge, then pans to the bridge itself
At this early hour of the night, the bridge still has a lot of traffic moving on it
Then the camera moves down to get a closer look of the traffic on the bridge
(voice over from inside the car) Oh, Jesus
- can't c
can't follow his car
The camera follows the moving traffic on the bridge, and certainly also follows Larry's car, even though, from this height, we can't tell which car it is
(voice over from inside the car) Well, he's right up ahead
He's right there
(voice over from inside the car) Where, up ahead
don't know which car 'm following here
You know, 'm not a good driver
can't chase somebody in a car

They pass the 15W exit

The car stops
(voice over from inside the car) Okay, let me turn the light off
The car headlights switch off
(voice over from inside the car) Be careful, be careful, be careful
They both get out of the car, and they start walking toward the place where Carol saw the other car
They reach the other car surrounded by huge piles of metal scrap
The car and the scenery around it are lit by a powerful red light
Carol and Larry run toward the place where the red light comes from
It is inside a huge building
But they don't go inside the building and, instead, keep on running along the building
Medium shot on Larry and Carol
Carol stops Larry and points at something
Look, look

House's body

House
Reverse angle shot on Larry and Carol
Then reverse angle long shot on the cauldron
lot of bright sparks are coming out of the cauldron

The camera pans around to a medium shot on Paul's car
Through the windshield, we see Paul behind the wheel, lit by the red light coming from the melted metal
He starts the car and drives away
The camera pans around toward Carol and Larry, still running - too late - toward Paul's car
That was Mr
House
That was definitely Mr
House

Larry has walked around the car and joins Carol on the sidewalk
You know, he's got proof his wife died of a heart attack two weeks ago
We've got no body
We've got nothing, Larry
Larry looks away from her and puts his hand on his mouth, as if frightened by something Ohhh
What
What
What's wrong
What
Oh
The camera turns around Larry and Carol and, located now behind Larry's back, gives us a full shot of the entrance of Larry's building
Oh, my God
Oh, my God
Paul and Gladys Dalton, Paul's assistant at his movie house, are coming out of the building
Paul tuns his head around and sees Carol and Larry
Hallo, there
Hey
How are you

May  introduce Gladys Dalton, my gal Friday
Mrs
How are you
Nice to see you
Carol and Larry shake hands with Gladys
This is Larry and Carol, my neighbors

Oh, well, it

He puts his hand on Gladys' shoulder and start walking away with her
What a shame
Good night
Good night
The camera follows the departing couple, Gladys still walking with the help of a cane

They've already put on their nightclothes and they have a last talk before going to sleep

Either she's a twin, or he's a twin

All right, all right
The, um, the first thing is this
'  -  - The door of the elevator opens
Inside the cabin, Larry and Carol are smiling and talking
(voice over) We came home that night
There had been a heart attack
Some neighbors are gathered around Paul's apartment door
Larry asks them questions
(voice over) Uh, what if they induced it
You know, some kind of poison
We never saw the body
The camera pans inside Paul's corridor, where Mrs
House's body, completely covered by a white sheet, is lying dead on a stretcher with the doctor and the emergency medical team around her
(voice over) You know, it had to be some other woman
You know, some- some woman who probably had some kind of ballpark resemblance to Mrs
House
The camera pans around to the group of neighbors standing in the hallway
(voice over) The super says he saw her, but, uh, he's a drunk, you know
Mrs
House could have been hiding
'  -  - Back to Larry and Carol sitting in their bed
But you-you remember that you heard a noise that night
That had to be Mrs
House leaving to check into the hotel
Yeah
Yeah
Well
can't sleep
just,
No, wait a minute, wait
'm too, you know
'm too
But it doesn't make any sense at all, Larry, because suddenly, you know, he murders her
mean, what's it all about
Let me, let me call Vincent's restaurant in New Jersey
and why don't we go meet Ted and Marcia and get something to eat, and talk with them
Wait a minute
At one in the morning
What are you talking about
You mean
You wanna
Yeah, so what
So what
It's so, you know, Ted-Ted was taking her to a show and to-to-to dinner
so they'll be there
All the way out to New Jersey
So, hey, kid, this is the apple
This is the town that never sleeps
That's why we don't live in Duluth
That, plus  don't know where Duluth is
He picks up the phone on his night table
Lucky me
'  - Vincent's is a nice cosy place, with dim lights, tasteful decorations, and light piano music
Full shot of a table with the four customer seen in profile
Larry is seated next to Marcia, and across from his wife
Ted is seated next to Carol
During the following conversation, the camera moves around the table
Uh, you really saw his face
Yes
Oh, yes, 'm here to tell you
You saw, you saw what he looked like
No question
You know exactly who it is
Oh, no question about it
It was-It was Mr
House
There was no
Not a, not a question
mean, you could see him because, uh, you know, there was-there was just no way that you could avoid it
He was right there
The camera stops on Marcia and thus stops moving around the table
To me, it's obvious
Wh
How do you see it
How obvious
What do you mean
Obvious he's committed the perfect murder
What do you mean
What
How
What do you mean
Okay, look
You have to start off with another woman who bears some ballpark resemblance to Mrs
House
Yeah
That's what  said
That's exac
used the term ballpark resemblance myself
know
You used the term, right
It was my idea
said what she said
They're with this woman
Yeah
'  -   - Paul and another woman, that looks like his wife, are seated around a table, having dinner
Lilian House gives a glass of wine to the woman, then another one to Paul, and kisses him on the forehead
(voice over) Maybe having dinner
They don't induce a heart attack, because that's fiction bullshit
Later
The woman has a hard attack
Paul helps her to walk to the sofa
(voice over) She has a heart attack
She drops dead spontaneously
They had no thought of killing her
Maybe they wished she was dead
(voice over) Why
(voice over) don't know
Maybe they stood to gain if she died
They see a golden opportunity
Later
Lilian, wearing a pink night-robe, is dressing the dead woman, lying on the sofa, into her own clothes
(voice over) Mrs
House dresses her up in her clothes
She hides
(voice over) This is my theory
Exactly my theory
(voice over) That's right
She checks into a hotel
'  - Back to the restaurant
Long shot on the table
All the other tables are empty
The camera zooms to a full shot of the table, Marcia and Larry facing us, and Carol and Ted with their back to us
Yeah, well, we got that far, with the exception of the actual spontaneous heart attack
Okay, you know the husband's planning to go to Paris with this pretty young woman
Yeah
Yeah
He's cheating on his wife
Yeah
So, instead of finishing the scheme they planned, he double-crosses her and kills her, taking her share of the profits
Well, you think, you think Helen Moss is in on this, too, huh
Yeah, a good chance she's aware
Okay, but what about Mrs
Dalton
He claims he took her to the movies
She's his alibi
She covered for him when he strangled his wife
She said he was at work all day
That's right, because he introduced her as a colleague
Marcia lights a cigarette
Wait, why
Why would she
She's a colleague who maybe loves him
Oh, wait, wait
He's cheating on her, too
Cheating on two women
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's perfect
Just, it all fits
The guy doesn't look the part
The point is, he's gotten away with the perfect murder
There are no bodies around to prove anything
And all the paperwork is strictly above board
He's home free
Oh, my
Oh, where did you find this woman
She's a genius
She's brilliant
She's brilliant
But the guy
He knows that we know, so if he knows we're on him
Well, he doesn't care
Why should he
Everything's been neatly disposed of
He's home free
Only he, and maybe his mistress, know the truth
Well, j
She's right, there's no body
Hold on, hold on, for a second
We don't know this is all true
This is just a theory
Yeah, but it's a great theory
Have you been paying attention
This is a great theory
Oh, yeah
It sounds good, it holds water
Everything fits together in this
am paying attention
think it's great
When  come back from the ladies room, 'll tell you how to trap him
She stands up and starts walking away to the toilets
Larry and Ted stand up too
They wait for her to be gone to sit back
Oh, excuse me
Where-Where did you find her
She's-She's-She's really something
Her mind, it just goes
Yeah, she's got one idea after another
It's like one thing leads to another
Fantastic
Close shot on Carol
'm surprised you two didn't drool yourself to death
The camera zooms back to a medium shot on Carol and Ted
Oh,  thought we just had a nice first date
That's
(voice over) knew that they would hit it off
Why
Uh-huh
Yeah
Him
(voice over) -- knew this
Yeah, uh-huh
What about you
You were gonna jump into her lap
saw you, Larry
The camera moves around the table to a medium shot on Larry, with Ted and Carol's backs in the foreground
What are you talking about
Huh
'm, 'm, huh, what's wrong with you
'm her editor
'm- 'm a father figure to her, how
Yeah, the only thing you didn't do is rub your hands together
That was it
You gotta be joking
What
are you telling me that you're jealous of Marcia
Well
It's not that 'm jealous
Kids, kids
People, what are we doing, here
The camera pans to a medium close shot on Carol
Yeah, look who's talking
My God,  mean, you kept staring into her eyes like she was the Dragon Lady, or something
The camera slightly zooms back to show us Larry and Carol What'd wrong with you
You're jealous because he's-he's interested in her
'm interested in her theory
What
don't
What are you
Well, 'd just like to know if you take all your-your authors to lunch at the Cafe des
Marcia walks back to the table
Okay, 've got it
She sits down, while Larry half-stands up and then sits back
Close shot on Marcia Here's the story
Since he's gotten away with it, all we can do is bluff
As long as we have no body, we have no case
The camera pans to Ted
What
What do you mean
What do we
We pretend that he slipped up, and the molten steel didn't do the job
What- What do you mean
The camera pans back to Marcia
Yeah, it's possible
He saw you there, he knows you're onto him
After he ran away, why couldn't you have retrieved the body
You're kidding
We couldn't have gotten her out of that
We
would have wound up with a few toes and a shoulder, maybe, at most
Well, that's
Okay, okay, you have the body
What does he know
He was probably too scared to be very lucid
The camera pans to Ted, who looks at Marcia with worshipping eyes
(voice over) He's an amateur
He dumped the body and ran off, and then somehow - who knows the details, you two dug her out
Now, you can send him to the chair
Okay, okay, just
like this woman, she's lurid
Let me tell you why he's not going to believe us, okay
The camera pans on Larry
Yeah, first of all, because  can't,  can't bluff or lie without giggling, so-so
The camera pans to Carol
Yeah
No, because if we really had the body, why tell him
Why not go straight to the Police
The camera pans to Marcia
If you tell the cops, you can't shake him down
Medium shot on another table, around which two middle-aged men are seated, listening very eagerly to the conversation
(voice over) Oh, she's wicked
Oh, -look
look how, look how this works out
You go to the law, what do you gain
Medium close shot on Ted and Carol
mean, so-so maybe they, you know, they put him in jail
What have you got
You haven't got anything
(voice over) Right
But if he wants the evidence, and he's got to pay for it, now
Okay, now he's nervous, right
Yeah, you know, wait
There's just so many fallacies in this,  can't even count them
The camera pans to Marcia and Larry
(voice over) What
Name one
(voice over) Name one
Okay, the guy looks us straight in the eyes and says, What body
What the hell are you talking about
Prove it
Well, that's when we keep bluffing
(voice over) What
How
What do we do
We produce the body
Yeah, but where are you gonna get it
Madame Tussaud's
Yeah
Say-Say we found someone to corroborate this story
(voice over) Oh, really
-Just
Someone he trusted
The camera pans to Ted and Carol
Like who
(voice over) Like his lover
Say she called and said, Paul, 've just seen Lillian's body
They want a hundred thousand dollars for it
Why-Why would she do that
The camera pans to Marcia and Larry
(to Larry) Remember that book you recommended to me
Murder in Manhattan
Oh, yes
Max Schindler's book
That's right, the phone call
(voice over) don't remember that book
This is perfect
(voice over) You never mentioned that book to me
No, no
Because you don't like light reading, so  never
The camera pans to Ted and Carol
Since when did  not like light reading, Larry
don't know
don't know this book
What is this book
The camera pans to Larry and Marcia
This book
That's fantastic
It would be so perfect because s-she's a, she's a-an, actress, or would-be actress, anyhow, and you're-you-re
Jeez, we could use his theatre
He's a playwright
This is so perfect
Your theatre is empty all the time, anyhow
The camera pans to Carol and Ted
Oh, God
Oh, yeah, thank you
That's great
What-What are we talking about here
What-What do you mean
What-What is this
The camera pans to Larry and Marcia
Listen to this
What you do is, we get her in for a fake audition, and you write some lines that don't mean anything
(voice over) Yeah
And she does them, and she doesn't know what she's doing and we tape-record it
(voice over) Uh
Listen to this
(voice over) 'm listening
And we edit it up
We edit the tape recording up, and we make one end of a phone call
The camera pans to Ted and Carol
(voice over) and we play it into the phone to Mr
House
This is in the book
The camera pans to Larry and Marcia
This is perfect, list
(voice over) Oh, come on
No, that could never, ever work, in a million years
You don't know what he's going to say
The camera pans to Ted and Carol
What's he gonna say
The camera pans to Marcia and Larry
In the book, they use several tape recorders
(voice over) In the book
We coordinate it
It's coordinated
The camera pans to Ted and Carol
In the book
You mean, you're basing your plan on some dumb paperback
(voice over) This is great
This is great
s
No, really
(voice over) like
No, it's great
Oh
The camera pans to Marcia and Larry
He's gotten away with murder
Our only chance is to nab him as he tries to kill again, cover his tracks
Medium shot on the two waiters, standing on either side of the counter, and listening to the conversation
(voice over) It's great
What happens, is
it provokes him to kill again
They catch him the second time
(voice over) Exactly
He's gotten away with the first murder
Medium close shot on Carol and Ted
(voice over) You know what 'm thinking, though
The camera pans to Marcia and Larry
What
Actually, in the book what happens is, now that  think of it, he
he kills the
the two people that are working the scheme on him
(voice over) Yeah, that's all right
(voice over) But
(voice over) But you're not worried about that
Um, well,  don't know
It's perfect
Either that, or 've
've just developed Parkinson's
The camera zooms back, to show us the four people around the table
No, we can handle him
We can handle him
Listen, this is incredible
This is an incredible idea
It's perfect
It's perfect
He knows you're onto him
You shake him down
No, no
He comes after you, we nab him
The camera stops zooming back and gives us a full shot on the table
That's great
It's great
You're wonderful
just
'm amazed
Yeah
just
It's either that, or he walks
Yeah
Yeah, wait
So, what you're saying is
This is great
Wait, no, okay

House into trying to murder Larry and me

You're not scared, are you
No, no, no, no, no, 'm not scared
'm not scared
'm just turning it over in my mind
just want to check with my clergyman before we commit
- -   - Medium shot on Helen Moss, making a phone call from an open booth in the street
While she is talking, the camera comes closer to her, to a medium close shot on her face
Hi, uh, -twenty-four messages
Oh, really
Audition for what
Did he say
Okay, okay
Wait, hold on
She looks into her purse and gets her agenda out of it
Let me get a pencil
Okay
'  -  - Full slightly high-angled shot on the stage
In the middle of the stage floor, a white circle, on which there is a chair and a small table with a telephone
Suzanne Raphael, a young woman, is auditioning
She is seated on the chair, holding the telephone
Behind Suzanne, which is the left side of the stage seen from the audience, a white wall, with a doorless opening
On either side of the wall, two red columns
And on either side of the girl, which are the front and the back of the stage, two red metallic frames
In front of the girl, a video camera on a tripod, with an operator standing behind the camera
Actually, the operator is Sy, Larry and Carol's friend, whom we have seen much earlier in the film, in the antique market and at Elaine's restaurant
The stage is well lit, when the audience hall is in the dark
Yeah, well, Dad, you know, 've heard just about enough of this
She slams the phone down
The camera pans around to show us the right side of the stage, where there is several rows of theatre seats and a table in front of the seats
Ted, Marcia and Marilyn are seated in the front row
Marilyn is Sy's wife, whom we have also seen earlier in the film
Carol is seated in the second row, behind Marcia
Good, that's great
Thank you, Suzanne
Thank you
We'll let you know
That's Suzanne Raphael, right
Yeah
Good, thank you
Carol taps on Marilyn's shoulder, and whispers something to her
Ted joins them in their whispered conversation
The camera pans back on the stage
Larry, with a clipboard in his hand, has entered the stage, pushing Helen in front of him
This is Helen Moss
Hi, there

Hi
Medium close shot on Ted, who stands up, and walks toward the stage
The camera follows him
Uh, have you, uh

To go over it, a little bit
The camera pans to a medium close shot of Helen
Yes, yes
Uh,  have, but, um,  have just a few questions
Sure , yeah
The camera moves slightly, and is now located behind Ted's back, still with Helen in medium close shot
Is she divorced, in this
Uh, yes
Yes
Uh, recently
Yes
Yeah
But she's, uh, very, highly emotional
Yeah
You know really
uh, lot of
Lot of feeling
Very strong
Oh
Hm
Should  just begin
Yeah, just
Whenever, you know, whenever you feel it
Whenever you feel into it
Ted walks away
Helen takes a very deep breathing, sits down, puts her hands trough her hair, takes another breathing, and picks up the phone handset from the telephone on the table
She overdoes it a lot, trying to act as the prima dona she is not
Yeah, okay
She dials a fake number on the phone keyboard
Hello, Joe
- was just
(voice over) Uh, let me stop you right there
Helen looks in Ted's direction
(voice over) 'm sorry,
uh, if you'll be
if you'll start out more frightened
then that'll take you where you're gonna go
Right, right
She breathes deeply before starting again
Hello, Joe
can't talk much, now, and if  sound strange, don't get alarmed
Later
Helen is auditioning another scene
She doesn't have the phone in her hand any more
She is holding a script and looking at it
Larry is seated in front of her, and read his own script on his clipboard
Give me your hand
Hold on
Try not to fall
Hold on
'm trying, 'm trying
Quickly
Hurry
Later

Medium shot of Helen, seen from behind
We see Sy standing behind his camera on her right, and Larry standing with his clipboard in his hand on her left
In the background, Ted, Marcia, Marilyn and Carol listening to her
While Helen is talking, the camera moves backward through the opening in the scenery
Ever since Joe came home from Vietnam, he's cast a pall on everything
dark cloud, a pall

It is full of very high-tech video and audio equipment
Medium shot of Marilyn standing behind a computer
Close to her, Carol is seated on a table, and Ted is standing next to her
They are both looking at a large video monitor
On the monitor screen and on the computer screen, we see the same picture of Helen auditioning with the telephone in her hand
' Hello, Joe

The camera pans to Marcia, seated behind Carol and also looking at the monitor
Behind her, Sy is looking at another monitor, and manipulating some switches on an editing machine underneath the monitor
Larry is standing next to him

We hear Helen's voice distorted by Sy's editing machine
'  (distorted) Hello, Joe
The camera pans back on Ted and Marcia, then it pans to a close shot of a big high-tech tape recorder, on which Sy is working
We see his hands cutting off a short section of the audio tape, and gluing back the two severed ends of the tape together
Full shot of the room
In the foreground, Sy is working on his tape recorder
On his right, Larry is standing and looking at him
On his left, Marilyn also looking at him

Ted smiles when he hears the work Sy has done with the tape
' and if  sound strange, don't get alarmed
() Perfect
She shakes hands with Larry
That's great
He also shake hands with Larry, moving slightly Carol out of the way
You did great
Great
Larry suddenly notices that Carol has been excluded from the hand- shaking party, and he turns around toward her
Well, yeah, it's, excuse me, hey, don't worry, yeah, okay
Fantastic
'  - The camera is behind Marcia, who is driving in a street in New- York
We see Helen walking on the sidewalk
There she is
The camera pans around, from inside the car, to get a better shot of Helen
Where
You have to keep her busy for all afternoon
Through the back window of the car, we see Helen entering a restaurant called Time
Yeah, yeah, okay
Okay, yeah
Yeah, 'll-'ll just keep improvising, you know
Okay, well, it shouldn't be too hard
She's a hungry actress, you're a playwright with a role

On the right, there is a large modern mantlepiece
On the left, a bicycle is leaning on the wall
Under the window, a large and cosy sofa
Carol and Sy are standing in front of the window and talking together
Next to them and Marcia is also standing and reading a large album
In the foreground, Larry, who is the only one not to be casually dressed, and is wearing jacket and necktie, is playing with a small cassette-player in his hands
Marilyn is walking into the room
Listen, does anybody want some guacamole or anything
Sy walks toward her, holding another cassette player
Carol is also holding one
Would you stop with the guacamole
We have to get started with this

It must have been a dressing room, but now it is full of various junk, with a big poster, that looks like a enlarged newspaper, on the wall
Paul picks up the phone from a small counter fixed on the wall
Hallo

Carol picks up her player to put it in front of the telephone and presses the play button
' They have your wife's body
They showed it to me
'   -    - Exactly who has it
How many are there
'  -   - It is Sy's turn to switch his player on
' Your neighbors
That's right
They want two hundred thousand dollars for it

There's an echo
Are you on a speaker phone
'  -   - The group seems surprised by a question they did not expected
Marcia silently points to Marilyn's player
Marilyn presses the play button

We don't have an answer for that
What are we gonna do
Go to a different thought
Mm

What thought
Wait

Sy turns to Carol
Shhh
Carol puts her hand in front of her mouth
Larry gets his player close to the telephone and presses the play button ' You've either got to pay them off, or get rid of them

Can you meet me
'  -   - It is still Larry's turn to use his player
'  (louder) Yes
They're keeping it refrigerated
Marcia hits Larry's elbow, to tell him it was the wrong cue
(voice over in the speaker of the telephone) What
What did you say
Larry is very nervous all of a sudden, and puts another player in front of the telephone
' About two hours ago
Larry drops the player

Two hours what

The usual spot

Marilyn, who has just been playing her player, presses the stop button on it
Then Marcia presses the mute button on the telephone

Okay, hurry up, hurry up

You can't press some

We hear voices but we don't see anyone yet
(voice over) Great
All right
Now, my job is to wait exactly one hour and call Mr
House from a phone booth
Where are you
Where are you running so fast
Carol runs out of the building

Larry comes out of the building and closes the door
Carol turns toward him

They start walking down the street
The camera follows them
What are you talking about

We had just a big success in there
What
Marcia likes to read what  like to read
Oh, right, God
Yeah, well it's true

Now that, now that Nick's grown up,  mean, you know, we're just left facing each other

Nothing, 'm her editor

Yeah

The camera stops moving and just shows just the departing couple walking down the street
Well, listen,  think maybe  will go back to seeing my shrink
Oh
You don't have to see your shrink
There's nothing wrong with you that can't be cured with a little Prozac and a polo mallet
Just
just would like to be alone for a while, okay, Larry
What are you talk
Just
just,
Uh, okay
Long shot of Carol running away, while Larry, standing in the middle of the sidewalk, looks at her going away
- classical New-York cafeteria, with tables and chairs scattered all around the room
In the background the long counter, where the food is displayed, and along which the customer are lining up at lunchtime
Around a slightly isolated table on the left, Ted and Helen are talking
So,  have this, like, really crazy father and everything
Oh, yeah
The camera zooms to a medium shot on Ted and Helen
And, yeah
He's wanted, like, in three states
He has a terrible driving record
So we had to move from Virginia then to New Jersey, and
So, your father is wanted in three states for driving
Really
Yeah, for driving
Yeah
So  moved to Hackensack, and then
Well, anyway,  was in all these different contests and  was even, uh, Miss, uh, Teenage Passaic
Oh, how wonderful
'  -   - Medium shot of the room
The front door opens and Carol walks in
She slams the door shut and puts her purse on a table
She takes her coat off, walks into the corridor and opens a closet to put the coat away in it
She then chooses a new set of clothes and shoes to go to her appointment
She closes the closet and walks into the bathroom to change
She closes the bathroom door
The camera remains outside the bathroom and starts moving along the corridor back to the front door
The front door opens and Paul walks in
He walks silently along the corridor toward the bathroom
- Same medium shot as before on Ted and Helen
Was that before or after the fourth abortion
Well, after the fourth, but before the drama prize
The drama prize
And
Mm
hm

Remember
Remember

Out, out, damn spot
The topless Macbeth
Oh, yeah
Oh, for the fraternity party, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Topless Macbeth

How could  forget that
It's just
- -   - Larry is in an open phone booth in a quiet street
He picks up the handset, put a coin in the slot, and starts dialing the number he has written on a piece of paper
Hallo, Mr
House
This is Larry Lipton
got a
a package  think you're gonna want
Of course it's gonna cost you, uh, $200,000 in
in small, unmarked bills
Or
or
or large marked ones, if
if
if you want to go that route
'   -    - The small disused dressing-room in the corner of the backstage
Paul is talking into the telephone
In front of him, Carol is tied on a chair, with a white cloth gag taped on her mouth
While Paul is talking, the camera zooms on Carol's frightened face
And  have a package you might want, Mr
Lipton
If you ever wanna see your wife alive again, you'll do as  say
- -   - Larry is still in the phone booth
Oh, really
Well,  think you're bluffing
Yeah, don't
don't ever try and bluff a bluffer
Yeah, if
if you got Carol, put her on the phone
'   -    - Paul takes the gag off Carol's mouth and put the phone mouthpiece in front of her lips
() Larry, Larry, help me
'm here, Larry
Paul puts the gag back on Carol's mouth - -   - Larry looks very frightened
Oh, my
Oh, my God
Don't hurt her
'   -    - Paul is holding the gag in front of Carol's mouth with one hand and the telephone with the other hand
'll tell you exactly where to meet me, and you bring that package  want
Now, once  have it and 'm safely gone, you'll get your wife back
Otherwise, 'll kill her
- -   - Larry is now very very frightened
Yes, yes
Yeah, no, no, no, no

'll be there
'll be there
Yes, 'll b
'll bring your wife's body, she
In
in
in the trunk of my car
Yes, 'll
promise
'll be there
Larry hangs up and hold the side of the phone booth
don't have his wife's body
Bluff, bluff
- -   - Long shot of a street covered with iron works
Actually, this is the same street and the same shot as the one we saw earlier in the film, when Ted and Carol were following Helen going to Paul's movie house in a yellow cab
Larry's car is coming toward us, and then turns into the dead-end street where the back entrance of Paul's movie house is located
'   - Larry stops the car near the entrance of the movie house
Paul is waiting for him
Medium close shot on Larry's car
Larry opens his door, and comes out of the car
Where's Carol
Paul walks toward the car
He's got a gun in his hand
First show me Lillian's body
got it
There's no way she could have survived that vat of molten steel
No, no,
got
If you're not bluffing, where is she
Why are you so nervous
What are you so nervous about
Where
If  don't have her, what are you so nervous
Where is she
got her in the trunk of my car
Open it
Come on, now
got her
If she's not there, 'll put a bullet through your head
Now, open it
Larry walks around his car toward the trunk
Come on
Come on
Larry opens the trunk
Step back
Larry takes something in the trunk, then closes it back, but the door of the trunk doesn't close well and opens again
Larry walks back to Paul and shows him what he's got in his hand
No, no,  got her
See, if  don't have her, how come  got her ring
got her ring, there
This is
This is her ring
think you're lying
He walks to the open trunk
It's a
No, no, no, no
Uh
Paul takes a bad-looking dummy out of the trunk
Apparently, it is an amateur dummy that Larry has made himself
What is this
What is this
He throws the dummy back in the trunk
could never bluff
What
've lost a fortune in cards over the years
Listen to me
'm not a bluffer
'm going to put a
Get a
They start fighting
'   -    - Carol is still tied and gagged on the chair
She tries desperately to get free
'   - Medium shot on Larry and Paul, still fighting
Larry succeeds in getting away from Paul, who fires his gun
But, apparently, Larry is not hit by the gunshot, because he runs toward the back entrance of the movie house
The camera follows him
'   -  - Medium shot on the staircase on the side of the backstage
Larry runs down the stairs, while we hear the sound of the Lady from Shangai
The Lady from Shangai is a 1947 film written, directed and played by Orson Welles
(Orson Welles - voice over from the film) That's what Grisby thought
But, of course, she meant to kill Grisby, too
After he'd served his purpose
Poor howling idiot
Larry has now reached the backstage
He is behind the screen, a small part of which is seen on the side of the shot
(Orson Welles - voice over from the film) He never even did that
He went and shot Broome
And that was not part of the plan
Broome might have got to the police before he died
Larry walks around the backstage, trying to find his way
We see the black and white film on the screen, but also reflections of the screen on the multiple mirrors scattered around the backstage
(Orson Welles - voice over from the film) And if the cops traced it to Grisby
and the cops made Grisby talk, he'd spill everything
Medium shot on the staircase
Paul is walking very slowly downstairs
(Orson Welles - voice over from the film) And she'd be finished, so she had to shut up Grisby but quick
Back on Larry, still trying to find his way around the backstage
(Orson Welles - voice over from the film) And  was the fall guy
Full shot on the screen, where a man is falling down a long slide, like the one used by kids on playgrounds
We hear the film music
Medium close shot on two mirrors, one behind the other
On the mirrors, we see the reflection of the screen
Paul is slowly walking from behind the first mirror, his gun in hand
Full shot on the mirrors, with Larry walking cautiously among them
'   -    - Medium shot on Carol in the small room
She is still trying to get free from her bonds and gag
(Rita Hayworth - voice over from the film) Why don't you try to understand
'   -  - Back to the mirrors showing numerous reflections of the screen
(Rita Hayworth - voice over from the film) He was mad
He had to be shot
(Orson Welles - voice over from the film) And what about me
Paul walks in, his gun in his hand
(Rita Hayworth - voice over from the film) We could have gone off together
Close shot of Larry half-hidden behind a large mirror
(Orson Welles - voice over from the film) One who follows his nature, keeps his original nature in the end
Larry inadvertently drops the large mirror on the floor
The mirror breaks with a crashing sound
(voice over) Help
Help
The camera pans to Paul, walking slowly with his gun pointed toward Larry
They can't see us behind the screen, and they can't hear us with the sound on
Not even a gunshot
Behind Paul, we see the film on the screen
We have now reached the famous last scene of the film, shot in the hall of mirrors
Rita Hayworth's face is reflected on the many mirrors in the film, just like, in the actual scene in the backstage, Paul and Larry are reflected on the many mirrors scattered around
(Everett Sloane - voice over from the film) knew 'd find you two together
Arthur's figure, walking with a cane, is reflected in the many mirrors in the film
Just the same, Gladys, who has just entered the backstage, walking with a cane, is also reflected on the mirrors scattered around her
She has a gun in the hand which is not holding the cane
While Gladys and Paul are talking, the film keeps on showing on the screen behind them, but we do not understand the words from the film, because Paul and Gladys' voices are louder
Hallo, Paul
Didn't you expect me
Medium shot on the mirrors, showing several reflections of Paul
Mrs
Dalton
Close shot on Gladys' face
While she is talking, the camera pans away from her, showing her reflection on a mirror
You made a lot of promises to me, over the years
And then, you decided to dump me for that young model
The camera keeps on panning, showing another reflection of Gladys
(voice over) never led you on
(with a very harsh voice) It's late for excuses
Medium shot on the mirrors showing several reflections of Paul
None of you can prove anything
Full shot of the screen, showing Arthur and his numerous reflections on the mirrors in the film
(Everett Sloane - voice over from the film) So you'd be foolish to fire that gun
Low angle shot on the staircase, showing Larry going down the stairs
(Everett Sloane - voice over from the film) With these mirrors, it's difficult to tell
You are aiming at me, aren't you
Carol
Carol
Carol
Medium shot of Gladys and one of her reflections
'm aiming at you, lover
(Everett Sloane - voice over from the film) Of course, killing you is killing myself
Of course, killing you is killing myself
(Everett Sloane - voice over from the film) It's the same thing
But you know, 'm pretty tired of both of us
She fired her gun twice Medium shot on the many reflections of Paul
He fires his gun twice
We hear noises of mirrors being broken by the gunshots, both in the film, and on the backstage itself
Medium shot of Gladys and one of her reflections
She turns around, not being sure, because of the mirrors, of Paul's exact location
Medium shot of Paul walking on the backstage
We still hears noises of mirrors being broken, but we don't know if the noises come from the film or the backstage
Medium shot of Gladys and several of the reflections
Medium shot of the floor of the backstage
We see the bottom of the screen and, of course, the film projected on it, and in which the mirrors are being broken
Paul enters from behind a mirror frame, and falls on the floor
Gladys' reflection appears in several mirrors
She stops and looks at Paul's body lying on the floor
'   -    - Medium close shot of Larry entering the room
He rushes to Carol, and takes her gag off
God
Are you okay
Are you okay
He hugs and kisses her
Oh, God, Larry
Oh, Larry, 'm so happy to see you
Jesus,  was,  was never so glad to see somebody in my life
Are you all right
He starts untying her hands
Yes, 'm all right
You don't know what's going on out there
'll never say that life doesn't imitate art again
'm
'm
Oh, gee
We
we gotta call the police, Larry
Yes, and
and
and
a glazier
know
Oh, God
Quick, quick
Dial, dial, dial
He picks up the telephone, and Carol, whose hands are now completely free, starts dialing
Larry
Oh, God, Larry
Oh, God
Oh, honey
Oh, God
Ow
Ow
Oh, God
Jesus
Larry hugs and kisses her again
'm sorry
'm sorry
Oh, wife mine
He takes the rope away, but he does it so nervously that he almost takes Carol's head off
Aow
Aow
(talking in the phone) Hello
Wife mine
Oh, God
- -        - Medium close shot on the top part of the door of the police station
sign says : 4th precinct 621
The camera tilts down
Three uniformed policemen are standing on the sidewalk near the door
Marcia and Ted come out of the station, and stop at the entrance
God, it's
it's so complicated
can't
Can't keep track of it all
Oh, listen
'll give it to you one more time
Marcia takes a cigarette, and Ted lights it with his lighter
'  -   - Medium shot
It's dinner time in Paul's apartment
Paul and Lilian's sister are seated around the table
Lilian comes in from (voice over) Mrs
House had a sister who moved to England many years ago
Lilian gives a glass of wine to her sister
(voice over) She changed her name when she married
Lilian gives a glass of wine to Paul
(voice over) Her husband died
She moved back to New York recently, a very, very rich widow
but a recluse
Lilian's sister has a heart attack
Paul helps her walk away from the table to the sofa
(voice over) Mr
and Mrs
House knew they weren't in her will
They have her over to dinner, she accidentally keels over
guessed right there
Lilian's sister is lying dead on the sofa, and Lilian, wearing a pink night-robe, is dressing her sister in her own clothes
(voice over) She has a reasonable resemblance to her sister, so they fake it
Pretend Lillian House died
They cremate the sister
The camera pans to Paul talking on the telephone
(voice over) Lillian checks into a fleabag joint
and for several weeks she pretends to be her sister
closing her accounts, liquidating her assets, accumulating big money
The camera pans back to the sofa, where Lilian is still dressing her sister
(voice over) What she didn't realize was that her husband was two-timing her with Helen Moss, this pretty model
- -        - Back to the entrance of the police station, where Ted and Marcia are still talking
They start walking along the street
So, he decides not to cut her in and go off to
don't know
With his mistress and, uh, keep all the dough
So, he kills Lillian
He cremates her, or pours molten steel all over her or something
and, uh, that's when we came along and tripped him up
Medium shot of Ted and Marcia slowly walking behind the police cars parked near the station
He had some great alibis
Yeah, that woman that worked for him
Yeah
Mrs
Dalton
She covered for him
She loved him
Not that she dreamed he was a murderer
What do you
What do you
want,  want to celebrate, or something
What do you wanna do
You wanna
Wanna go see what, uh, what Larry and Carol are up to
think they wanna be alone
Oh, yeah
Uh, okay
All right
Uh, well, you have any plans
You're taking me to dinner, right
Yeah, right
Absolutely
Only we can't sleep together
Why not
Not
not tonight
Why not
Well,  already slept with Helen Moss once today, and 'm not young and active like  used to be
You'll do anything to catch a murderer, won't you
- - '   - Full shot of the corner of the street where Larry's building is located
The pavement is wet from a recent rain
Carol and Larry are coming around the corner of the street
What an experience
Oh, really one
'm
'm still vibrating
know
Incredible
Carol, who was walking quite rapidly, suddenly slows down
Track shot of Larry and Carol, with the camera in front of them Oh, you know, Larry, you were surprisingly brave
What do you mean surprisingly
Yeah
You seem shocked
Well
You know, 'm a pretty good guy, you know
Well, you know
Yeah,  know, uh
Where do you wanna go for dinner tonight
Let's not go to any restaurant where they serve cowards
Carol laughs
don't know
What are you laughing at
You know, Larry,  love you
love you
How could you have ever been jealous of Marcia
Isn't that ridiculous
Don't you know that  could only love you
You were jealous of Ted
Ted
Yeah
You've got to be kidding
Take away his-his-his elevator shoes and his fake suntan and his capped teeth
and what do you have
You
Larry laughs
They have reached their building and they enter it
Right
love that
An attendant opens the door for them
Through the glass doors, we see them cross the lobby toward the elevator
