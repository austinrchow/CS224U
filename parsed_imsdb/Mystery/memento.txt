Memory's not perfect

Ask the police, eyewitness testimony is unreliable
The cops don't catch a killer by sitting around remembering stuff
They collect facts, make notes, draw conclusions
Facts, not memories: that's how you investigate

Memory can change the shape of a room or the color of a car
It's an interpretation, not a record
Memories can be changed or distorted and they're irrelevant if you have the facts

---------------------------------------------------------------------- The following is Jonathan Nolan's short story "Memento Mori", the inspiration for his brother, Christopher Nolan's, screenplay for the film, : by Jonathan Nolan What like a bullet can undeceive
" -Herman Melville Your wife always used to say you'd be late for your own funeral
Remember that
Her little joke because you were such a slob-always late, always forgetting stuff, even before the incident
Right about now you're probably wondering if you were late for hers
You were there, you can be sure of that
That's what the picture's for-the one tacked to the wall by the door
It's not customary to take pictures at a funeral, but somebody, your doctors,  guess, knew you wouldn't remember
They had it blown up nice and big and stuck it right there, next to the door, so you couldn't help but see it every time you got up to find out where she was
The guy in the picture, the one with the flowers
That's you
And what are you doing
You're reading the headstone, trying to figure out who's funeral you're at, same as you're reading it now, trying to figure why someone stuck that picture next to your door
But why bother reading something that you won't remember
She's gone, gone for good, and you must be hurting right now, hearing the news
Believe me,  know how you feel
You're probably a wreck
But give it five minutes, maybe ten
Maybe you can even go a whole half hour before you forget
But you will forget- guarantee it
few more minutes and you'll be heading for the door, looking for her all over again, breaking down when you find the picture
How many times do you have to hear the news before some other part of your body, other than that busted brain of yours, starts to remember
Never-ending grief, never-ending anger
Useless without direction
Maybe you can't understand what's happened
Can't say  really understand, either
Backwards amnesia
That's what the sign says disease
Your guess is as good as mine
Maybe you can't understand what happened to you
But you do remember what happened to , don't you
The doctors don't want to talk about it
They won't answer my questions
They don't think it's right for a man in your condition to hear about those things
But you remember enough, don't you
You remember his face
This is why 'm writing to you
Futile, maybe
don't know how many times you'll have to read this before you listen to me
don't even know how long you've been locked up in this room already
Neither do you
But your advantage in forgetting is that you'll forget to write yourself off as a lost cause
Sooner or later you'll want to do something about it
And when you do, you'll just have to trust me, because 'm the only one who can help you
*** after another to a stretch of white ceiling tiles interrupted by a hand-printed sign taped right above his head, large enough for him to read from the bed
An alarm clock is ringing somewhere
He reads the sign, blinks,reads it again, then takes a look at the room
It's a white room, overwhelmingly white, from the walls and the curtains to the institutional furniture and the bedspread
The alarm clock is ringing from the white desk under the window with the white curtains
At this point Earl probably notices that he is lying on top of his white comforter
He is already wearing a dressing gown and slippers
He lies back and reads the sign taped to the ceiling again
It says, in crude block capitals, Earl rises and takes a look around
The room is large for a hospital-empty linoleum stretches out from the bed in three directions
Two doors and a window
The view isn't very helpful, either-a close of trees in the center of a carefully manicured piece of turf that terminates in a sliver of two-lane blacktop
The trees, except for the evergreens, are bare-early spring or late fall, one or the other
Every inch of the desk is covered with Post-it notes, legal pads, neatly printed lists, psychological textbooks, framed pictures
On top of the mess is a half-completed crossword puzzle
The alarm clock is riding a pile of folded newspapers
Earl slaps the snooze button and takes a cigarette from the pack taped to the sleeve of his dressing gown
He pats the empty pockets of his pajamas for a light
He rifles the papers on the desk, looks quickly through the drawers
Eventually he finds a box of kitchen matches taped to the wall next to the window
Another sign is taped just above the box
It says in loud yellow letters,
,
Earl laughs at the sign, lights his cigarette, and takes a long draw
Taped to the window in front of him is another piece of looseleaf paper headed
It charts off the hours, every hour, in blocks: 10:00 p
m
to 8:00 a
m
is labeled go
Earl consults the alarm clock: 8:15
Given the light outside, it must be morning
He checks his watch: 10:30
He presses the watch to his ear and listens
He gives the watch a wind or two and sets it to match the alarm clock
According to the schedule, the entire block from 8:00 to 8:30 has been labeled
Earl laughs again and walks over to the bathroom
The bathroom window is open
As he flaps his arms to keep warm, he notices the ashtray on the windowsill
cigarette is perched on the ashtray, burning steadily through a long finger of ash
He frowns, extinguishes the old butt, and replaces it with the new one
The toothbrush has already been treated to a smudge of white paste
The tap is of the push-button variety-a dose of water with each nudge
Earl pushes the brush into his cheek and fiddles it back and forth while he opens the medicine cabinet
The shelves are stocked with single-serving packages of vitamins, aspirin, antidiuretics
The mouthwash is also single-serving, about a shot-glass-worth of blue liquid in a sealed plastic bottle
Only the toothpaste is regular-sized
Earl spits the paste out of his mouth and replaces it with the mouthwash
As he lays the toothbrush next to the toothpaste, he notices a tiny wedge of paper pinched between the glass shelf and the steel backing of the medicine cabinet
He spits the frothy blue fluid into the sink and nudges for some more water to rinse it down
He closes the medicine cabinet and smiles at his reflection in the mirror
"Who needs half an hour to brush their teeth
" The paper has been folded down to a minuscule size with all the precision of a sixth-grader's love note
Earl unfolds it and smooths it against the mirror
It reads- ,  '
Earl stares blankly at the paper, then reads it again
He turns it over
On the back it reads- :  '  ,
Earl reads both sides again, then folds the note back down to its original size and tucks it underneath the toothpaste
Maybe then he notices the scar
It begins just beneath the ear, jagged and thick, and disappears abruptly into his hairline
Earl turns his head and stares out of the corner of his eye to follow the scar's progress
He traces it with a fingertip, then looks back down at the cigarette burning in the ashtray
thought seizes him and he spins out of the bathroom
He is caught at the door to his room, one hand on the knob
Two pictures are taped to the wall by the door
Earl's attention is caught first by the , a shiny black frame for four windows into someone's skull
In marker, the picture is labeled
Earl stares at it
Concentric circles in different colors
He can make out the big orbs of his eyes and, behind these, the twin lobes of his brain
Smooth wrinkles, circles, semicircles
But right there in the middle of his head, circled in marker, tunneled in from the back of his neck like a maggot into an apricot, is something different
Deformed, broken, but unmistakable
dark smudge, the shape of a flower, right there in the middle of his brain
He bends to look at the other picture
It is a photograph of a man holding flowers, standing over a fresh grave
The man is bent over, reading the headstone
For a moment this looks like a hall of mirrors or the beginnings of a sketch of infinity: the one man bent over, looking at the smaller man, bent over, reading the headstone
Earl looks at the picture for a long time
Maybe he begins to cry
Maybe he just stares silently at the picture
Eventually, he makes his way back to the bed, flops down, seals his eyes shut, tries to sleep
The cigarette burns steadily away in the bathroom
circuit in the alarm clock counts down from ten, and it starts ringing again
Earl opens one eye after another to a stretch of white ceiling tiles, interrupted by a hand-printed sign taped right above his head, large enough for him to read from the bed
*** You can't have a normal life anymore
You must know that
How can you have a girlfriend if you can't remember her name
Can't have kids, not unless you want them to grow up with a dad who doesn't recognize them
Sure as hell can't hold down a job
Not too many professions out there that value forgetfulness
Prostitution, maybe
Politics, of course
No
Your life is over
You're a dead man
The only thing the doctors are hoping to do is teach you to be less of a burden to the orderlies
And they'll probably never let you go home, wherever that would be
So the question is not "to be or not to be," because you aren't
The question is whether you want to do something about it
Whether revenge matters to you
It does to most people
For a few weeks, they plot, they scheme, they take measures to get even
But the passage of time is all it takes to erode that initial impulse
Time is theft, isn't that what they say
And time eventually convinces most of us that forgiveness is a virtue
Conveniently, cowardice and forgiveness look identical at a certain distance
Time steals your nerve
If time and fear aren't enough to dissuade people from their revenge, then there's always authority, softly shaking its head and saying, We understand, but you're the better man for letting it go
For rising above it
For not sinking to their level
And besides, says authority, if you try anything stupid, we'll lock you up in a little room
But they already put you in a little room, didn't they
Only they don't really lock it or even guard it too carefully because you're a cripple
corpse
vegetable who probably wouldn't remember to eat or take a shit if someone wasn't there to remind you
And as for the passage of time, well, that doesn't really apply to you anymore, does it
Just the same ten minutes, over and over again
So how can you forgive if you can't remember to forget
You probably were the type to let it go, weren't you
Before
But you're not the man you used to be
Not even half
You're a fraction; you're the ten-minute man
Of course, weakness is strong
It's the primary impulse
You'd probably prefer to sit in your little room and cry
Live in your finite collection of memories, carefully polishing each one
Half a life set behind glass and pinned to cardboard like a collection of exotic insects
You'd like to live behind that glass, wouldn't you
Preserved in aspic
You'd like to but you can't, can you
You can't because of the last addition to your collection
The last thing you remember
His face
His face and your wife, looking to you for help
And maybe this is where you can retire to when it's over
Your little collection
They can lock you back up in another little room and you can live the rest of your life in the past
But only if you've got a little piece of paper in your hand that says you got him
You know 'm right
You know there's a lot of work to do
It may seem impossible, but 'm sure if we all do our part, we'll figure something out
But you don't have much time
You've only got about ten minutes, in fact
Then it starts all over again
So do something with the time you've got
*** and blinks into the darkness
The alarm clock is ringing
It says 3:20, and the moonlight streaming through the window means it must be  he early morning
Earl fumbles for the lamp, almost knocking it over in the process
Incandescent light fills the room, painting the metal furniture yellow, the walls yellow, the bedspread, too
He lies back and looks up at the stretch of yellow ceiling tiles above him, interrupted by a handwritten sign taped to the ceiling
He reads the sign two, maybe three times, then blinks at the room around him
It is a bare room
Institutional, maybe
There is a desk over by the window
The desk is bare except for the blaring alarm clock
Earl probably notices, at this point, that he is fully clothed
He even has his shoes on under the sheets
He extracts himself from the bed and crosses to the desk
Nothing in the room would suggest that anyone lived there, or ever had, except for the odd scrap of tape stuck here and there to the wall
No pictures, no books, nothing
Through the window, he can see a full moon shining on carefully manicured grass
Earl slaps the snooze button on the alarm clock and stares a moment at the two keys taped to the back of his hand
He picks at the tape while he searches through the empty drawers
In the left pocket of his jacket, he finds a roll of hundred-dollar bills and a letter sealed in an envelope
He checks the rest of the main room and the bathroom
Bits of tape, cigarette butts
Nothing else
Earl absentmindedly plays with the lump of scar tissue on his neck and moves back toward the bed
He lies back down and stares up at the ceiling and the sign taped to it
The sign reads,  , Earl closes his eyes
*** They tried to teach you to make lists in grade school, remember
Back when your day planner was the back of your hand
And if your assignments came off in the shower, well, then they didn't get done
No direction, they said
No discipline
So they tried to get you to write it all down somewhere more permanent
Of course, your grade-school teachers would be laughing their pants wet if they could see you now
Because you've become the exact product of their organizational lessons
Because you can't even take a piss without consulting one of your lists
They were right
Lists are the only way out of this mess
Here's the truth: People, even regular people, are never just any one person with one set of attributes
It's not that simple
We're all at the mercy of the limbic system, clouds of electricity drifting through the brain
Every man is broken into twenty-four-hour fractions, and then again within those twenty-four hours
It's a daily pantomime, one man yielding control to the next: a backstage crowded with old hacks clamoring for their turn in the spotlight
Every week, every day
The angry man hands the baton over to the sulking man, and in turn to the sex addict, the introvert, the conversationalist
Every man is a mob, a chain gang of idiots
This is the tragedy of life
Because for a few minutes of every day, every man becomes a genius
Moments of clarity, insight, whatever you want to call them
The clouds part, the planets get in a neat little line, and everything becomes obvious
should quit smoking, maybe, or here's how  could make a fast million, or such and such is the key to eternal happiness
That's the miserable truth
For a few moments, the secrets of the universe are opened to us
Life is a cheap parlor trick
But then the genius, the savant, has to hand over the controls to the next guy down the pike, most likely the guy who just wants to eat potato chips, and insight and brilliance and salvation are all entrusted to a moron or a hedonist or a narcoleptic
The only way out of this mess, of course, is to take steps to ensure that you control the idiots that you become
To take your chain gang, hand in hand, and lead them
The best way to do this is with a list
It's like a letter you write to yourself
master plan, drafted by the guy who can see the light, made with steps simple enough for the rest of the idiots to understand
Follow steps one through one hundred
Repeat as necessary
Your problem is a little more acute, maybe, but fundamentally the same thing
It's like that computer thing, the Chinese room
You remember that
One guy sits in a little room, laying down cards with letters written on them in a language he doesn't understand, laying them down one letter at a time in a sequence according to someone else's instructions
The cards are supposed to spell out a joke in Chinese
The guy doesn't speak Chinese, of course
He just follows his instructions
There are some obvious differences in your situation, of course: You broke out of the room they had you in, so the whole enterprise has to be portable
And the guy giving the instructions-that's you, too, just an earlier version of you
And the joke you're telling, well, it's got a punch line
just don't think anyone's going to find it very funny
So that's the idea
All you have to do is follow your instructions
Like climbing a ladder or descending a staircase
One step at a time
Right down the list
Simple
And the secret, of course, to any list is to keep it in a place where you're bound to see it
*** through his eyelids
Insistent
He reaches out for the alarm clock, but he can't move his arm
Earl opens his eyes to see a large man bent double over him
The man looks up at him, annoyed, then resumes his work
Earl looks around him
Too dark for a doctor's office
Then the pain floods his brain, blocking out the other questions
He squirms gain, trying to yank his forearm away,  the one that feels like it's burning
The arm doesn't move, but the man shoots him another scowl
Earl adjusts himself in the chair to see over the top of the man's head
The noise and the pain are both coming from a gun in the man's hand-a gun with a needle where the barrel should be
The needle is digging into the fleshy underside of Earl's forearm, leaving a trail of puffy letters behind it
Earl tries to rearrange himself to get a better view, to read the letters on his arm, but he can't
He lies back and stares at the ceiling
Eventually the tattoo artist turns off the noise, wipes Earl's forearm with a piece of gauze, and wanders over to the back to dig up a pamphlet describing how to deal with a possible infection
Maybe later he'll tell his wife about this guy and his little note
Maybe his wife will convince him to call the police
Earl looks down at the arm
The letters are rising up from the skin, weeping a little
They run from just behind the strap of Earl's watch all the way to the inside of his elbow
Earl blinks at the message and reads it again
It says, in careful little capitals, *** It's your birthday today, so  got you a little present
would have just bought you a beer, but who knows where that would have ended
So instead,  got you a bell
think  may have had to pawn your watch to buy it, but what the hell did you need a watch for, anyway
You're probably asking yourself, Why a bell
In fact, 'm guessing you're going to be asking yourself that question every time you find it in your pocket
Too many of these letters now
Too many for you to dig back into every time you want to know the answer to some little question
It's a joke, actually
practical joke
But think of it this way: 'm not really laughing at you so much as with you
'd like to think that every time you take it out of your pocket and wonder, Why do  have this bell
a little part of you, a little piece of your broken brain, will remember and laugh, like 'm laughing now
Besides, you do know the answer
It was something you learned before
So if you think about it, you'll know
Back in the old days, people were obsessed with the fear of being buried alive
You remember now
Medical science not being quite what it is today, it wasn't uncommon for people to suddenly wake up in a casket
So rich folks had their coffins outfitted with breathing tubes
Little tubes running up to the mud above so that if someone woke up when they weren't supposed to, they wouldn't run out of oxygen
Now, they must have tested this out and realized that you could shout yourself hoarse through the tube, but it was too narrow to carry much noise
Not enough to attract attention, at least
So a string was run up the tube to a little bell attached to the headstone
If a dead person came back to life, all he had to do was ring his little bell till someone came and dug him up again
'm laughing now, picturing you on a bus or maybe in a fast-food restaurant, reaching into your pocket and finding your little bell and wondering to yourself where it came from, why you have it
Maybe you'll even ring it
Happy birthday, buddy
don't know who figured out the solution to our mutual problem, so don't know whether to congratulate you or me
bit of a lifestyle change, admittedly, but an elegant solution, nonetheless
Look to yourself for the answer
That sounds like something out of a Hallmark card
don't know when you thought it up, but my hat's off to you
Not that you know what the hell 'm talking about
But, honestly, a real brainstorm
After all, everybody else needs mirrors to remind themselves who they are
You're no different
*** , then repeats itself
It says, "The time is 8:00 a
m
This is a courtesy call
" Earl opens his eyes and replaces the receiver
The phone is perched on a cheap veneer headboard that stretches behind the bed, curves to meet the corner, and ends at the minibar
The  is still on, blobs of flesh color nattering away at each other
Earl lies back down and is surprised to see himself, older now, tanned, the hair pulling away from his head like solar flares
The mirror on the ceiling is cracked, the silver fading increases
Earl continues to stare at himself, astonished by what he sees
He is fully dressed, but the clothes are old, threadbare in places
Earl feels the familiar spot on his left wrist for his watch, but it's gone
He looks down from the mirror to his arm
It is bare and the skin has changed to an even tan, as if he never owned a watch in the first place
The skin is even in color except for the solid black arrow on the inside of Earl's wrist, pointing up his shirtsleeve
He stares at the arrow for a moment
Perhaps he doesn't try to rub it off anymore
He rolls up his sleeve
The arrow points to a sentence tattooed along Earl's inner arm
Earl reads the sentence once, maybe twice
Another arrow picks up at the beginning of the sentence, points farther up Earl's arm, disappearing under the rolled-up shirtsleeve
He unbuttons his shirt
Looking down on his chest, he can make out the shapes but cannot bring them into focus, so he looks up at the mirror above him
The arrow leads up Earl's arm, crosses at the shoulder, and descends onto his upper torso, terminating at a picture of a man's face that occupies most of his chest
The face is that of a large man, balding, with a mustache and a goatee
It is a particular face, but like a police sketch it has a certain unreal quality
The rest of his upper torso is covered in words, phrases, bits of information, and instructions, all of them written backward on Earl, forward in the mirror
EventuallyEarl sits up, buttons his shirt, and crosses to the desk
He takes out a pen and a piece of notepaper from the desk drawer, sits, and begins to write
*** don't know where you'll be when you read this
'm not even sure if you'll bother to read this
guess you don't need to
It's a shame, really, that you and  will never meet
But, like the song says, "By the time you read this note, 'll be gone
" We're so close now
That's the way it feels
So many pieces put together, spelled out
guess it's just a matter of time until you find him
Who knows what we've done to get here
Must be a hell of a story, if only you could remember any of it
guess it's better that you can't
had a thought just now
Maybe you'll find it useful
Everybody is waiting for the end to come, but what if it already passed us by
What if the final joke of Judgment Day was that it had already come and gone and we were none the wiser
Apocalypse arrives quietly; the chosen are herded off to heaven, and the rest of us, the ones who failed the test,  just keep on going, oblivious
Dead already,  wandering around long after the gods have stopped keeping score, still optimistic about the future
guess if that's true, then it doesn't matter what you do
No expectations
If you can't find him, then it doesn't matter, because nothing matters
And if you do find him, then you can kill him without worrying about the consequences
Because there are no consequences
That's what 'm thinking about right now, in this scrappy little room
Framed pictures of ships on the wall
don't know, obviously, but if had to guess, 'd say we're somewhere up the coast
If you're wondering why your left arm is five shades browner than your right, don't know what to tell you
guess we must have been driving for a while
And, no,  don't know what happened to your watch
And all these keys:  have no idea
Not a one that  recognize
Car keys and house keys and the little fiddly keys for padlocks
What have we been up to
wonder if he'll feel stupid when you find him
Tracked down by the ten-minute man
Assassinated by a vegetable
'll be gone in a moment
'll put down the pen, close my eyes, and then you can read this through if you want
just wanted you to know that 'm proud of you
No one who matters is left to say it
No one left is going to want to
'    , staring through the window of the car
Smiling eyes
Smiling through the window at the crowd gathering across the street
The crowd gathering around the body in the doorway
The body emptying slowly across the sidewalk and into the storm drain
*** stocky guy, facedown, eyes open
Balding head, goatee
In death, as in police sketches, faces tend to look the same
This is definitely somebody in particular
But really, it could be anybody
Earl is still smiling at the body as the car pulls away from the curb
The car
Who's to say
Maybe it's a police cruiser
Maybe it's just a taxi
As the car is swallowed into traffic, Earl's eyes continue to shine out into the night, watching the body until it disappears into a circle of concerned pedestrians
He chuckles to himself as the car continues to make distance between him and the growing crowd
Earl's smile fades a little
Something has occurred to him
He begins to pat down his pockets; leisurely at first, like a man looking for his keys, then a little more desperately
Maybe his progress is impeded by a set of handcuffs
He begins to empty the contents of his pockets out onto the seat next to him
Some money
bunch of keys
Scraps of paper
round metal lump rolls out of his pocket and slides across the vinyl seat
Earl is frantic now
He hammers at the plastic divider between him and the driver, begging the man for a pen
Perhaps the cabbie doesn't speak much English
Perhaps the cop isn't in the habit of talking to suspects
Either way, the divider between the man in front and the man behind remains closed
pen is not forthcoming
The car hits a pothole, and Earl blinks at his reflection in the rearview mirror
He is calm now
The driver makes another corner, and the metal lump slides back over to rest against Earl's leg with a little jingle
He picks it up and looks at it,  curious now
It is a little bell
little metal bell
Inscribed on it are his name and a set of dates
He recognizes the first one: the year in which he was born
But the second date means nothing to him
Nothing at all
As he turns the bell over in his hands, he notices the empty space on his wrist where his watch used to sit
There is a little arrow there, pointing up his arm
Earl looks at the arrow, then begins to roll up his sleeve
*** "You'd be late for your own funeral," she'd say
Remember
The more think about it, the more trite that seems
What kind of idiot, after all, is in any kind of rush to get to the end of his own story
And how would  know if  were late,  anyway
don't have a watch anymore
don't know what we did with it
What the hell do you need a watch for,  anyway
It was an antique
Deadweight tugging at your wrist
Symbol of the old you
The you that believed in time
No
Scratch that
It's not so much that you've lost your faith in time as that time has lost its faith in you
And who needs it,  anyway
Who wants to be one of those saps living in the safety of the future, in the safety of the moment after the moment in which they felt something powerful
Living in the next moment, in which they feel nothing
Crawling down the hands of the clock, away from the people who did unspeakable things to them
Believing the lie that time will heal all wounds-which is just a nice way of saying that time deadens us
But you're different
You're more perfect
Time is three things for most people, but for you, for us, just one
singularity
One moment
This moment
Like you're the center of the clock, the axis on which the hands turn
Time moves about you but never moves you
It has lost its ability to affect you
What is it they say
That time is theft
But not for you
Close your eyes and you can start all over again
Conjure up that necessary emotion, fresh as roses
Time is an absurdity
An abstraction
The only thing that matters is this moment
This moment a million times over
You have to trust me
If this moment is repeated enough, if you keep trying-and you have to keep trying-eventually you will come across the next item on your list
End
