href <b>// --> </b> -------------------------------------------------------------------- At first we see an eye
Closed and slowly it opens up and looks around
Later we get a full view of a man lying on the floor in a strange-looking room
4 walls, 1 ceiling, 1 floor
6 sides just like a cube
There is a kind of door on each side
Each door has a handle
On the walls are weird-looking pictures
They doesn't seem to look like anything seen before
The man stands up in the middle of the room
The camera pans around him
Then he makes some sounds and opens a door in one of the walls
As he looks in to the open door, he sees a new room like the one he is located in, but the light in the new room is blue
He turns around and the door closes by itself
Then he opens the door in in the floor
Under that door, there's a new room excatly like the first, but in this room the light is red
The door closes
He opens a new door in one of the walls
The light in there is red
He looks back and then crawls into the new room
As he lands on the floor in the new room it makes a loud sound, and then the door closes behind him
He takes one step, and then there is a loud sound
The man stands still
Slowly he begins to bleed, and slowly his body begins to fall apart
As the last parts of his body hits the floor, we see a sort of trelliswork
First it moves to the floor, and afterwards it is being folded up
-------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------- man lies on the floor
door is open beside him
Slowly we see a hand trying to find something to hold on to
man crawls up from the hole
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Hey
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin closes the door in the floor
He sits down beside the man lying on the floor and tries to wake him
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Hey
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin stands up and opens a door in one of the walls
He looks into a new room
Red light
He closes the door again
The man from before is now awake
We hear a sound from one of the other doors in the walls
Quentin stands beside the door preparing to attack whatever that comes out from there
As someone looks out, Quentin grabs her by the neck, throws her to the floor and tries to beat her, until he realises that it is a lady
The lady screams, and sits down in a corner of the room
-------------------------------------------------------------------- 'm sorry
It's alright, 'm not gonna hurt you
What do you want
thought you were
What
don't know
-------------------------------------------------------------------- We hear a loud sound and everybody in the room looks around
As the sound stops, someone screams for help
Quentin opens a door real fast
As the camera switches to a new angle, we see a girl in a red room screaming for help
When she sees Quentin she walks towards him
-------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin crawls into the room
-------------------------------------------------------------------- What, what
It's ok, come here
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin helps Leaven into the room where the others are located
Holloway helps Leaven out, but not good enough, because Leaven falls and drops her glasses
Leaven sits up against a wall and Quentin comes towards her
-------------------------------------------------------------------- It's ok, calm down, evrything's gonna be fine
What was in there
Just give me a minute to figure things out
Why are you afraid of that room
Just give me a minute  said
-------------------------------------------------------------------- The door in the ceiling is being opened
We see an old man
-------------------------------------------------------------------- How many people are in this thing
Listen
We can't go climbing around in here
Why not
There's traps
What do you mean, traps
Ubitraps
looked into a room down there and something almost cut my head off
-------------------------------------------------------------------- The old man crawls down to the others, while Quentin talks about the traps
Leaven breathes heavily
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Holy God, holy, holy God
-------------------------------------------------------------------- The old man sits down and begins to untie his shoe
Leaven suddenly hugs Quentin
Holloway sits down beneath Worth
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Are you alright
Mister
Worth
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Holloway gets the attention from Worth
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Alright
hit my head
Let me take a look at that
It's ok, 'm a doctor, it doesn't look bad
-------------------------------------------------------------------- The old man stands up
-------------------------------------------------------------------- What the hell are you doing
-------------------------------------------------------------------- The old man opens a door and now looks into a blue room
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Hey old man
-------------------------------------------------------------------- The old man, Rennes, throws his boot into the room
An incinerator quickly burns the boot
Rennes pulls the boot back and then the door closes
Rennes drops the boot on the floor
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Motiondetectors integrated in the walls
Tough to spot
Oh God, oh God, oh God
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Rennes is on his way to open a new door
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Wait a second
Let's all just relax for a minute
Does anybody remember how they got here
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Long, nervebreaking silence
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Perogies
was eating dinner
Perogies, cheese and potato
ran out of sour cream and then  went to the fridge and then
don't know
You
Leaven
just went to bed and then What about you
just woke up here
Middle of the night
It's like Chile
They always come in the middle of the night
Who
Only the government can build something this ugly
Oh, it ain't government
Then what is it
don't know
Aliens
Please, we're spooked anough as it is
Let's rule out aliens from now on and concentrate on what we know
My mom's gonna freak
Rennes
Just won't be there
What do you think Rennes
We don't solve the act, sitting still
'm moving at this straight line, till  get to the end
Alright,  attend to agree
Shouldn't we wait here
To see if anybody comes
No one is gonna come
There's a way in here, so there's gotta be a way out
We can avoid the traps using the boot
Holloway is it
What do you think
For an exit
Ok
It can't be that simple
It ain't gonna be that simple
Take a look around
Take a good long look around, see it
Coz,  got a feeling it's looking at us
just wanna wake up
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven blinks with her eyes several times
Quentin sits down beneath her
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven, we can do this
We just have to stay calm, and work together as a team
There's gotta be a lot of people looking for us on the outside
'm a cop, alright
You're a cop
Yeah
'm gonna get you out of here,  promise, but you gotta be with me on this one
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven nods
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Ok
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Rennes opens a new door, waiting for Quentin to give "signal" -------------------------------------------------------------------- Boot it
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Rennes throws the boot, nothing happens
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Clean
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Through several times of boot-throwing we see other rooms, with other colors on the walls
On the way to a new green room, Leaven notice some numbers in the passage between two rooms loud sound is to hear
-------------------------------------------------------------------- That one sounded closer
It's mechanical
Seems to come at regular intervals
Maybe it's the ventilationsystem
No bets
No kidding, 'm boiling -------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven looks at the numbers again: 566 472 737
Above these numbers are some others: 476 804 539
-------------------------------------------------------------------- What is it, serial numbers
Room numbers, they're different in each room
Oh great, so there's only 566 million 400
000 rooms in this thing
There'd better not be
We have about three days without food and water before we're too weak to move
They have to feed us, don't they
Holloway
Oh, we have heat, stress, physical exhaustion i
e
dehydration, headaches, dizziness, disorientation, confusement
Mental process
The body eventual begins to break down it's own tissue
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Rennes rips a button of Holloway's shirt
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Suck on it
Keeps the saliva flowing
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Again the boot lands in a new room
This time, it's red
-------------------------------------------------------------------- What
The air seems dry in there
Trapped
Molecular chemical sensor
Why the hell didn't the boot set it off
The boot's not alive
It detects hydrogen-sulfide extruded from the skin
How come, you know so much about sensors, Renz
Rennes
Not Renz
It's french
Fine, you're french
'm asking how
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Rennes opens a new door and throws the boot
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Rennes
Sensorexpert
With the right age
don't believe it
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin laughs
-------------------------------------------------------------------- This guy is The Wren
The what
The Wren
The bird of Attica
through the coop on six major prisons
Seven
You're kidding right
You can get us out
Maybe
An escapeartist
Yes, 'm Harry "fucking" Houdini
The only reason  dragged you so far, is cause  need your boots
If you're not smarting up 'm gone like that
No more talking
No more guessing
Don't even think about something which is not right in front of ya
That's the real challenge, you gotta save yourselves from yourselves
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Rennes jumps into the new room
We hear a click
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Merde
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Rennes gets acid in the face
He screams, and the door closes
In the other room, the door begins to open
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Get him out
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Rennes' head is partly dissolved
He screams quietly, because he has blood in his mouth
The others scream too
They lay him in a corner
After a little while they look to him again
He's dead, most of his head his been dissolved
-------------------------------------------------------------------- So it was electrochemical or whatever, right
And he missed it
The Wren
That's great, that's fucking great
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin turns the corpse of Rennes around with a foot
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Alright
It's time to reassess this place
've been over it again and again, why would they throw innocent people in here
Are we being punished
've never done anything to deserve this
Forget about all that
You can't see the big picture from in here
So don't try
Keep your head down
Keep it simple
Just look, look at what's in front of you
That's what he said
Start with us
We got an escapeartist and a cop
There's gotta be a reason for that
You're a doctor Holloway
That gives you a function, a reason, right
No, it just makes me go: "Why me, and not one of the ten million other doctors out there"
Leaven
What are you
Nothing,  jst go to school, hang out with my friends
What else
There is nothing else
My parents are these people live with them
'm boring
think we have to ask the big questions: What does it want
What is it thinking
One down, four to go
Why don't you tell us what your purpose is Worth
've wondered that myself
'm just a guy,  work in an officebuilding, doing officebulding stuff
wasn't actually bursting joie de vivre before  got here
Life just sucks in general
can't stand that attitude
Because, he's right
What s your purpose Quentin
Kids
Three of them
haven't made my piece yet
'm getting out of here no matter what
That's where my strength comes from
You people find yours wherever you got it
For Christ's sake
What do you live for
Don't you have a wife or a girlfriend or something
Nope,  got a pretty nice collection of pornography Nice, nice
ain't got anyone either, but 'm not giving up
'm pissed off
The came into our homes
They stripped us bare
They took my rings
They took my
my amethyst
wanna know who's responsible
Leaven, your glasses
You don't need them
Only for reading
Well, they took off her jewelry, but they must have put these on you
If nothing is random
why are they here
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin opens a door in the wall
We see three numbers: 582 434 865
On the other side there's the numbers: 149 413 568
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven, what do you read in school
Math
What can they mean
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven takes the glasses and begins to study the numbers
-------------------------------------------------------------------- 149
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven opens a new door
The numbers we see are: 645 372 xxx -649 -------------------------------------------------------------------- Primenumbers
can't believe  didn't see it before
See what
It seems like if any of these numbers of prime, then the room is trapped
Ok, 645
645, that's not prime
372
no
649
Wait, 11 x 59, it's not prime either
So that room is safe
Wait, wait, wait
How can you make that decision based on one primenumbertrap
'm not
The incinerator thing was prime: 083
The molecularchemical thing had 137, the acidroom had 149
You'd remembered all that in your head
have a facility for it
Leaven, you beautiful brain
Boot it
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Holloway throws the boot
Nothing happens
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Ok, out of the way
Brains before beauty
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven jumps into the room
Nothing happens
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Primenumbers
Primenumbers
Primenumbers
Primenumbers
-------------------------------------------------------------------- The camera pans around for some time
First we see the numbers: 656 778 462, then we see Leaven thinking
-------------------------------------------------------------------- How long have we been in here Nine or ten hours
-------------------------------------------------------------------- We see a door closing
Then we see Leaven rubbing her eyes
-------------------------------------------------------------------- How do you know
5 'o clock stubble
the last thing  remember was shaving
guess  missed breakfeast
or lunch
or whatever Now don't worry
'll be home in time for dinner
If we get out, 'l make you dinner
You got a date
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin opens a door and Leaven looks at the numbers inside
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Doing good
need to smoke
could smoke a butt of a sidewalk
Holloway
Just real yourself in a bit
Come on
Were moving along, things are looking up
Ok
You're right,  quitted smoking years ago
just need to be occupied
Talk to me
Have a conversation
What kind of doctor are you anyway
Uh, you know, the free kinda
Er, come on help me
Tell me about your rugrats
Ok
We have three boys
Nine, seven and five
Oh, good God
Poor woman
There's no way 'd survived that
She didn't either
She's not dead, we're just separated
'm sorry,  can't just shoot the breeze
These numbers aren't prime
Ok
Clear
Excuse me, sorry
You could try and help me out here buddy
No,  couldn't -------------------------------------------------------------------- The group crawls into the new room
Shortly afterwards they are in a green room, with everyone looking down in a new room
-------------------------------------------------------------------- This one is trapped too
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin closes the door
-------------------------------------------------------------------- We have to backtrack
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin looks up
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Not yet
Oh, no
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Everyone looks up on the door
the Quentin looks at Leaven
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Read them to me
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin takes of his shirt
Leaven is ready to hold it
-------------------------------------------------------------------- What are you
His coatrack
Oh please
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin begins to crawls up to the door
As he wants to open the door, he says: -------------------------------------------------------------------- It's stuck
-------------------------------------------------------------------- As Quentin opens the door, a guy falls down and almost hits Leaven
Quentin jumps down and the new guy stands up
-------------------------------------------------------------------- This room is green
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Kazan begins to knock his head into the wall
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Holloway
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Holloway now looks at Kazan
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Hi there
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Holloway puts a hand on Kazan's forehead
-------------------------------------------------------------------- This room is green
Yes it is
wanna go back to the blue room
Is it shock or what
think he's mentally handicapped
like the blue room
Jesus Christ
He almost broke my neck
Hey there, are you all alone
Do you wanna hold my hand, honey
Butter first, then honey, Kazan
Butter first then honey
How did he survive
wanna go back to the blue room
There's lots of blue rooms
We'll find another one to you real soon
This is just way too bizarre
Will you just worry about your own numbers
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven looks molested
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Go on, 'll look after him
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven points at the ceiling
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Safe, obviously
Since he almost fell on my head
Shall we go for a walk
Kazan, do you wanna go for a walk
-------------------------------------------------------------------- As Quentin begins to crawl up to the door
Kazan gets terrified
He hits himself with the one hand on his head
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Erm' Quentin
Let's not make him do the climbing thing right away
Holloway
Holloway
-------------------------------------------------------------------- The screen fades and next time we see something is in a new room where Kazan opens a new door
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Could they have taken us all the way to New Mexico
What are you talking about Holloway
'm talking about: "Where do you hide something this big
" It has at least got to fill something
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Holloway stands walks over to Quentin and stands beside him
-------------------------------------------------------------------- 'm sorry to shake your foundations Quentin, but you have no idea where your tax-dollars go
Free clinic doctors
Only the military industrial complex can afford to build something this size
Holloway, what's the military industrial complex
Have you ever been there
'm tellin' you, it's not that complex
And how would you know from where you are
What do you think these establishments is
It's just guys like me
Their desks are bigger, but their jobs aren't
They don't conspide, they
buy boats
No, this place is
Remember Scaramanga
The bad guy in "The Man With The Golden Gun"
It's some rich psyco's entertainment
Is that what you think
Clear
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Holloway crawls into the passage
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Ok, you're a cop
Single bullet theory
Right on
-------------------------------------------------------------------- As Holloway lands in the new room, she starts to lose her breath
It seems like she's being choken
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Gas
Holloway
Get back here
-------------------------------------------------------------------- But Holloway stays where she is
-------------------------------------------------------------------- It's ok
just swallowed my button
hate this
hate this
Your boy's having a conniption sitting there
-------------------------------------------------------------------- door is being opened
-------------------------------------------------------------------- It's like creme without coffee
She needs a break
She can do it
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Holloway crawls into Kazan and makes him touch her hair
And then back to the other room
-------------------------------------------------------------------- They don't look prime to me
Is that your two bits worth, Worth
Of course it's what is worth
Well
Well, he's right
Not prime
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin jumps into the new room
-------------------------------------------------------------------- In front of you
-------------------------------------------------------------------- lot of wires or whatever is being shot down from the ceiling and the slowly surrounds Quentin, rotates and Quentin just jumps away before he gets split up into several pieces
But it wasn't without pain
Quentin gets cut on one of his legs
-------------------------------------------------------------------- What is it
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin gets back into the room
-------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------- The door closes
-------------------------------------------------------------------- don't know what happened
it wasn't prime
Quentin, hold still
Somebody stop that rackets
Worth
Leave the boots
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth joins Kazan to make him shut up
-------------------------------------------------------------------- And shut the fucking door
-------------------------------------------------------------------- The door closes
-------------------------------------------------------------------- had a feeling about that fucking guy
He knew about that trap
But these numbers aren't prime
Then your numbersystem failed, but he knew
Knew what
How could he know
You're the paranoid, think about it
His only function so far is to kick us when we're down
So, he has a bad attitude
So you think that makes him spy
Trust me on this, it's my job to read people like an x-ray
-------------------------------------------------------------------- The door opens and Worth comes in with Kazan
Worth holds him for his eyes
-------------------------------------------------------------------- He doesn't like red rooms
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth makes Kazan, sit by himself
-------------------------------------------------------------------- So what happened
Pmfh, you saw what happened
Quentin
guess the numbers are more complicated than  thought
Maybe they mean nothing at all
No, it means they're more involved, the works for us up to now have just been bad,  just need more time with them
We need to rest anyway
Well that's handy, like if there was nothing fucking else we could do
-------------------------------------------------------------------- The camera fades
Next time we see Leaven writing some numbers on a piece of metal
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Are they telling you anything
They're not Tarot-cards
Do you have any idea on how many variables have to consider before  can decide from numbers this size
They don't reveal themselves right away
They're like people
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Kazan pulls down his pants to pee
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Oh, gross
Erm, not here honey, over in the corner
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Everybody looks at him
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, he's just peeing
Jesus Christ
Excellent
Now it totally reeks in here
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth laughs
-------------------------------------------------------------------- And you find this all pretty funny, don't you
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin goes really close to Worth
-------------------------------------------------------------------- What's your fucking problem Worth
Even Holloway's holding up better than you
Get over there and help her with him
That's your job, babysitter
Jawohl, Kommandant
Somebody has to taka responsibility around here
And that somebody has to be you
Not all of us have a luxury of playing nihilists
Not all of us are conceded enough to play hero
It's the will to live, everybody's got it Worth, even you, especially you hiding behind that cynical front
The will to live
That's the warm, coasy feeling deep inside
Thanks partner, 'm a new man
Arh, poor Worth: "Nobody loves me"
If that's the chip on your shoulders, then why did you lug it all this way
Why didn't you just lie down and die
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin opens the door to the trap from before
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Do it
Show us you have some backbone and jump into the sushimachine
Be a man
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Everybody's waiting for Worth to answer
Finally Worth stands up
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Thought so
Fuck you Quentin
don't wanna die, 'm just being realistic
Do you think they just builded this thing so we could just walk out of it
Do you think they would lay clues, if there wasn't a way out
You think we matter, we don't Put us out of your misery so we can get on and get out of here
Oh, you're not getting out
Yes, we are
There is no way outta here
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Long and nervebreaking silence
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Got ya
How
Do you know
Answer the question Worth
Oh, God
Who are you
am the poison
designed the outer shell
What
The shell, the sarcophagus
You builded this thing
Not this part, the exterior
don't know anything about the numbers or anything else in here
was contracted to draw plans for a hollow shell
cube
cube
Why didn't you tell us
For Gods sake, Worth
You knew what it was
No Worth
You're lying
Not first
Who's beyond it
don't know
Who hired you
didn't ask
never even left my office
talked on the phone to some other guys like me
Specialists working on small details
Nobody knew what it was
Nobody cared
Bullshit
You knew from square one
Look at him, he's up to his eyeballs in this thing
No Quentin
That's how they stay hidden
You keep everyone separated so the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing
The brain never comes out in the open
Whose brain
It's all the same machine right
Pentagon
Multinational coorporations
The police
If you do one little job
You build a widget in Saskatoon
The next thing you know, it's two miles under the desert, the essential component of a deathmachine
was right
All along my whole life  knew it
told you Quentin
Nobody's ever call me paranoid again
We gotta get out of here and blow the lid of this thing
Holloway, you don't get it
Then tell me, please,  need to know
It's maybe hard for you to understand, but there's no conspiracy
Nobody is in charge
It's a headless blunder operating under the illusion of a masterplan
Can you grasp that
Big brother is not watching you
What kind of fucking explanation is that
It's the best you re gonna get
looked and the only explanation  can come to is that there is nobody up there
Somebody had to say yes to this thing
What thing
Only we know what it is
We have no idea, what it is
We know more than anybody else
mean somebody might have known sometime, before they got fired or voted out or sold it
But if this place ever had a purpose, then it got miscommunicated or lost in the shuffle
This is an accident, a forgotten propetual, public, worksproject
Do you think anybody wants to ask questions
All they want is a clear conscience and a fat paycheck
mean,  lead on my desk for months
This was a great job
Why put people in it
Because it's here
you have to use it or admit it's pointless
But it is pointless
Quentin
That's my point
What have we come to
It's so much worse than  thought
Not really, just more pathetic
You make me sick, Worth
make me sick too
We re both part of the system
drew a box - you walk a beat
It's like you said Quentin is: Keep your head down, keep it simple, just look at what's in fron of you
mean nobody wants to see the big picture
Life's too complicated
mean, let's face it
The reason we're here is it's out of control
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin turns around
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Is that how we're ruining the world
Daah
Have you been on glue all of your life
felt guilty for ruining the world since  was like
seven
God
If you need someone to blame, throw a rock
Now  feel better
That's why you stayed with us
To confess
Still looking for someone to bust, Quentin
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin turns around again and begins to beat Worth
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin, Quentin,
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven grabs Quentin's arm
-------------------------------------------------------------------- We need him
What for
Have you gone absolutely mad
He's the only one who knows nything about the place
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth falls to the ground
Quentin walks away
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth
Hi
So there's this outer shell
Yeah
And it's a cube, like this
assume so
Are there any doors
There's one door
Where
Wherever the doorguy put it
Six guesses and it's sealed from the outside
What are the dimensions of the outer shell
434 feetsquare
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven starts to take steps inside the room until she gets to Kazan
-------------------------------------------------------------------- May
Come on
Side over
14 by 14 by 14
The inner cube cannot be flushed by the shell
There is a space
One cube
don't know
It makes sense
Well, the biggest the cube then can be is
26 rooms heigh, 26 rooms across, so
17
576 rooms
17
576 rooms
Oh, God that makes me queasy
Descartes
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven opens a new door and puts on her glasses
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven, you are a genius
What
-------------------------------------------------------------------- We see three numbers: 517 478 565 -------------------------------------------------------------------- Cartesian co-ordinates, of course, coded Cartesian co-ordinates
They are uses in geometry to plot points on a three-dimensional graph
In English
Slower
Bonjour, these numbers are markers, a grid-referance, like altitude and longitude on a map
The numbers tell us where we are inside the cube
Then where are we
It works
Ok, all  have to do now is add the numbers together
The co-ordinate is 19,  is 26 rooms
So that places us
seven rooms from the edge
Alright, let's go
Just out of curuiosity
mean don't hit me again or anything
But what are you gonna do when you get there
Maybe we can get the door open
Wrong
What we need to do is figure out how we get around the traps
'm dealing with that Holloway
'm looking for practical solutions here
Well, you haven't found any yet
We cut the risk with the numbers and the boot
Worth will go in first
No he won't Quentin, we take turns
Relax
-------------------------------------------------------------------- The camera fades
The first we see is someone nervous playing with his/hers button
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Is there room for two in there
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin crawls in to Leaven
-------------------------------------------------------------------- What's the matter
These co-ordinates: 14, 27, 14
What about them
Well, they don't make sense
Assuming the cube is 26 rooms across, there can't be a co-ordinate larger than 26
If that was right, then we would be outside the cube
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven looks up, and looks around
-------------------------------------------------------------------- No, not outside the cube
guess that means we're not having dinner
-------------------------------------------------------------------- The camera fades
First we see the group opening the door in the floor
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Trap, trap, trap
-------------------------------------------------------------------- We see a blue room
Just after Kazan says trap the last time
lot of spears come out from the walls until the room is filled with spears
In the end the spears go back again
-------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------- The spears come again, and goes away in the end
-------------------------------------------------------------------- (Whispers) It's soundactivated
-------------------------------------------------------------------- The spears come, and goes away
They close the door
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Lovely
How come the sound of the door-opening didn't set it off
Must be reat to ignore it
So that's it
The edge is surrounded by traps
Well,  guess we have to backtrack and try somewhere else
Who knows how many detours we'll have to take
say we cross the bitch
Right
How many boots do we have left Holloway
-------------------------------------------------------------------- They look at Kazan's feet
Just one boot left
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Get it off him
We know how it works, we just have to be quiet
Pretty fucking quiet
'm glad you're on sight Worth, because you're up
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Kazan makes a sound
-------------------------------------------------------------------- And he's not coming
Of course he is
No way
You're not leaving him behind
He's unpredictable
When we get to the edge we can come back for him, but he will get somebody killed here
Am  right
Shame on you
Will you look at yourselves
What have you turned into
They may have taken our lives away, but we're still human beings
That's all we've got left
We'll come back for him
That's a lie and you know it
He'll be quiet
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin opens the door and puts Worth down there
He hangs in the ceiling by himself now with a boot in his mouth
He crawls down the wall
Meanwhile we hear something nearby
As it's no longer is to hear
Worth opens a door, nothing happens, and crawls in
Leaven is up next
Afterwards Holloway
Next is Kazan
As Leaven is in Worth and Holloway stands on the floor
Kazan crawls in the ceiling and afterwards he crawls the wrong way
Holloway goes to get him
Suddenly his pants are stuck in the handle on the floor
Holloway tries to unloose it
Next up is Quentin
Now all is in except Quentin
He is on his way
In the floor the door is opening
So Quentin hurries up and aren't safe as the handle stops turning
He waits to be speared
Nothing happens
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Hah
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Now the spears come again, Quentin just makes it into the passage
Now we are in a red room
Quentin grabs Kazan and almost beats him
-------------------------------------------------------------------- You fucking fuck
That's enough
He's a trap
Let him go right now
Law of the jungle Holloway
He's a danger in the pack
Let him go you nazi
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin lets go of Kazan
-------------------------------------------------------------------- What did you call me
Quentin
You let that innocent boy go
You listen to me woman
Every day  mop up after your bleeding heart
The only reason why you exist is because  keep you
know your type
No kids, no man to fuck you
So you go around outraged sticking your nose up in other peoples assholes, sniffing their business
You missed your boat Holloway
You are all dry up inside there aren't you
That's your fucking problem
-------------------------------------------------------------------- The others look shocked
-------------------------------------------------------------------- How dare you say that to her
You don't know her Quentin
None ouf us know eachother here
Oh,  do
No you don't
No wonder your wife left you
All that bottled-up anger
And a thing for young girls
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin slaps Holloway in the face
He looks insulted
-------------------------------------------------------------------- God help you Quentin
Did you smack your kids around too
Is anybody besides me interested in what's on the other side of that door
Open it
Door number six, not door number one, door number two
Open the fucking thing
("singing") Sunshine
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth opens the door
Now we see something completely black
Only with a little light from rooms below and on the other sides
It's the edge, the shell
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Nighttime
My old friend the shell
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth crawls into the passage
-------------------------------------------------------------------- It's there
Morning
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Now we hear a gigantic echo
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Hang on to me
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin crawls in and Worth crawls into the room again
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Can't see shit
Nothing to hang on to
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin crawls back
-------------------------------------------------------------------- We have to try something
We gotta see if the door's over there
Someone has to swing over there and take a look
We make a rope of our clothes
Take it off
'll tie it onto myself
Yeah, you're gonna go
You weigh like 500 pounds it'll snap in two seconds
'm the lightest
Forget it
'll go
'm going Holloway
She's right Quentin, you're too heavy
'm the lightest after Leaven
Anyways it's my turn
-------------------------------------------------------------------- As Quentin ties the clothes, Holloway and Worth talks together
-------------------------------------------------------------------- How long did you know people we're put in here
couple of months
That's not long , if you consider your whole life
am
You opened my eyes Worth, that s something
David
Helen
And such a Helen
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Holloway begins to crawl outside the room
She's almost crying
-------------------------------------------------------------------- That's as far as you go
There's nothing down here
Hold tight
'll try swinging over there
Place yourself 'm gonna try again
Ok, one more time
Hurry, you're getting heavy
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Third time Holloway tries to swing over to the shell there's a big crash
The others now drops the grip of the rope
Quentin just reaches the end of the rope, as Holloway is falling
The others graps Quentins feet as he is almost out fo the room too
-------------------------------------------------------------------- What the hell is going on
Get up here now
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Holloway crawls up
In the end Quentin can reach her arm
First Quentin smiles, Holloway smiles too
But then Quentin looks someway different
Holloway knows what is going to happen
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin
Do you got her
What's going on
Is she Ok
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin drops Holloway and crawls back into the room
-------------------------------------------------------------------- She
slipped
Holloway
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven sits down i a corner
Quentin walks over to her
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Sssh
Come on Kazan
Kazan will you please stop doing that
Leaven, you gotta be strong sweetheart
Don't even talk to me
We gotta get down to the bottom
It'll be easier to get on to shell from there
It's a long fucking way with only one boot
But we gotta do it, before we get too weak
You gotta keep cracking the numbers Leaven
can't think anymore
Sure you can
It's your gift
It's not a gift, it's just a brain
Let her sleep for a while
We haven't slept for fucking hours
Ok, one hour
How the fuck are you gonna know how long an hour is
An hour is as long as  say
-------------------------------------------------------------------- The group go to sleep
In the background weird music is to hear
After a little while, we see someone taking the boot away from Worth
Then we see a hand holding Leaven for the mouth
Then Quentin is bending towards Leaven and afterwards we see him carry Leaven
The next we see is a door closing
-------------------------------------------------------------------- What are you doing
We have to make it down to the bottom
There'll be quiet there and you can concentrate
Do you just wanna leave them
They're traps
We are the key
get us down there
You think us out
Believe in me
Try to see what  see, how my mind works
When  look into someone's head like a fucking x-ray
looked through the walls
dreamed him at his desk, designing everything
He can't let you solve the puzzle
There is a purpose
We are the purpose
The cube is us
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin begins to touch Leaven
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin
We fit like numbers
man and a woman
Two halves of the equation take you down
The perfect key
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin goes further and tries to touch her breasts
-------------------------------------------------------------------- 'll slip you on the lock
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven runs away
Quentin stands up
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven
It's time to go down
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin tries to catch her
Meanwhile a door is being opened
Worth comes jumping hitting Quentin to the floor
Kazan enters the room too
The door closes
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Get away from her
Leaven, they're fucking spy's
Him, the retard
Holloway had outside information about my family
She went too far
You dropped her
Just go Quentin Give us the boot, you pig
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin turns around and suddenly hits Worth with the boot
Then he walks towards Leaven
-------------------------------------------------------------------- You don't want the boot
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Then Quentin again hits Worth several times
Afterwards he opens the door in the floor
-------------------------------------------------------------------- You wanna come with us Worth
Down the hatch
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin throws Worth down the hole in the floor
As Worth hits the floor, he starts laughing
-------------------------------------------------------------------- What the fuck's with him
-------------------------------------------------------------------- The others crawl down to Worth
He lies on the door, on the handle
As the camera switches angle, we see a corpse with the face down
Quentin turns the corpse with his foot
It's Rennes
Quentin drops the boot
-------------------------------------------------------------------- How does he
(laughing) It's The Wren, the old Renster
How could
(laughing) We've been going in circles That can't be
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin grabs Leaven and opens a door
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Where are we
don't know
Where are we
You figure it out
You haven't done anything
All you do is freak out
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven starts crying
Worth stands up and laughs
Quentin sits down
-------------------------------------------------------------------- You were right Worth
There is no outta here
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin starts crying
Kazan comes and touches his hair
-------------------------------------------------------------------- (crying) Get away from me
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth stands up
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Wasn't Rennes killed in that room
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth opens the door to were Rennes was killed
There's nothing
All we see is black
It's the edge, the shell
-------------------------------------------------------------------- How come there's nothing out there
You see an edge
We were not at the edge before
Where's the room that killed Rennes
Fuck off
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin throws the boot after Worth, but the boot does not him it's being thrown out of the room
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Oh, that was good
What difference does it make
We're dead anyways
Listen to what 'm saying
There was a room there before
We haven't been moving in circles, the rooms have
Of course
The rooms
That explains the thunder, the shaking
We've been shifting the whole time
It's the only logical explanation
'm such an idiot
What are you on to Leaven
Give me a minute
The numbers are markers point on a map, right
Right
And how do you map a point that keeps moving
Permutations
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven nods
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Permu
what
Permutations
list of all the co-ordinates the room passes through
Like a map that that tells you where the room starts, how many times it moves and where it moves to
The numbers tell you all that
don't know
've only been looking at one point on the map, which is probably the startingposition
All  saw, was how the cube looked like before it started to move
Ok, so it's moving
How do we get out
27
know where the exit is
Where
Stay away from me
Back off, Quentin
just wanna know, don't you wanna know
You remember that room we passed through before, the one with the co-ordinate larger than 26
What about it
That co-ordinate placed the room outside the cube
bridge
Right, but only in it's original position
What are you talking about
Look, the room starts off as a bridge, then it moves it's way through the maze, which is where we ran into it, but at some point it must return to it's original position
So the bridge is just a bridge
in a short period of time
This thing is like a giant combinationlock, when the rooms are in their startingposition ht elock is open
But when they move out of the linement the lock closes
Well the size of us
It must take days to complete a full cycle
So when does it open
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Now we see Leaven doing some math again
Quentin crawls towards her
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Don't
We find it's original co-ordinates by adding the numbers, the permutations is found by subtracting the numbers
It's it
The room moves to 0, 1 and -1 on the x-axis, 2, 5 and -7 on y, and 1, -1 and 0 on z
And what does that mean
You suck in math
Ok,  need the roomnumbers around as a referencepoint
666
897
466
567
898
ok
Yes
And 545
Did you get that
656
778
462
That's enough
is 17, y is 25 and z is 14
Which means this room makes two more moves before returning to it's original position
Do we have time
Maybe
Then let's go
Can you work out the traps in the system
Fuck the traps, let's get to the bridge
Well you threw out our last boot, you fucking idiot
Technically  can identify the traps
Technically
First  thought they were identified by primenumbers, but they're not
They're identified by a number that are the power of a prime
Ok, so
Can you calculate that
The numbers are huge
But you can, right
You can
have to calculate to numbers of factors in each set
Maybe if  had a computer
You don't need a computer
Yes,  do
Figure it out
Yes,  do
'm not dying in a fucking ratmaze
Look
No one in the whole world could do it mentally
Look at the number: 567898545
There's no way  can factor that
can't even start on 567
It's astronomical
Two
Astronomical
What did you say
Astronomical
Before that
Factors
How many factors Kazan
Of 567
Two
What are you fucking kidding
How many factors does 30 have
Three
And seven
One
Gumdrop
don't have any gumdrops
Gumdrop
Kazan, 'll give you a whole box of gumdrops for each answer
Gumdrops come in bags
You want 'em in bags, you got 'em in bags
don't like the red ones
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth opens a door and tells the numbers to Kazan
-------------------------------------------------------------------- 8-9-8
Two
5-4-5
Two
He's giving us the factors
Astronomical
You're telling me Tell--Son boy is a genius
By those numbers the room should be safe
There's only one way to find out
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin takes Worth and throws him into the room
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Don't
Safe
Kazan, my man
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin tries to make Kazan give him the factors
-------------------------------------------------------------------- What's the numbers boy
Right here
Look here
Make him do it
Kazan, we gonna do some numbers, ok
We like to do numbers, right
Primenumbers
That's right
Can you tell me the factors of 656
Two
779
Two
462
Three
Clear
Move
Come on let's go
You too Worth
Move your scuddy ass Worth, 'm not through with you yet
Leaven open up that door, and get Einstein working on the numbers
-------------------------------------------------------------------- As Quentin has his head in the room, Worth closes the door and tries to choke Quentin
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Oh, Jesus
Go
Hurry
Leaven
563
Come on Kazan
563
You fuckheads, you're dead
Two
Clear
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin gets his head out, and Worth closes the door
Next we see the number 384
-------------------------------------------------------------------- One
Trapped
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth enters the room and closes the door
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Check the floor
Is he dead
Not quite
Not even close, Worth
When 'm finish 'll throw you in a fucking trap on the way out of here
-------------------------------------------------------------------- On the other side of the door, we see Quentin opening the door
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Where is he
Come here
said come here riiight
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin falls down in the room under the floor
We see Worth hanging down there
Afterwards Leaven and Kazan help Worth up from there
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Got ya
That way
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Now we see the number 805 -------------------------------------------------------------------- Two
Clear
Four
Clear
-------------------------------------------------------------------- The next door they open lead them to the edge again
This time there's much more light out there
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Oh
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven puts her head outside the room, and quickly takes it back
room is passing by
When they open the door again, there's a room there
-------------------------------------------------------------------- guess that proves out theory
The numbers
-------------------------------------------------------------------- We see two numbers: 206 911 xxx -------------------------------------------------------------------- Four, two, three
Clear
-------------------------------------------------------------------- They enter the new room, except Kazan, the room they just came from moves away
-------------------------------------------------------------------- / -------------------------------------------------------------------- In the background we hear Kazan screaming
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Listen
He hasn't moved far
'm gonna find him
What do you think
You don't have a lot of lives left
-------------------------------------------------------------------- We see Kazan in a red room
He's terrified
Then we see Worth entering a blue room, then we see Leaven step on a piece of glass, the one from her glasses
Then we see Worth in the ceiling of the red room with Kazan
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Kazan
didn't move
Yeah, good
Erm, you have to climb up here, ok
don't like that
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven opens a door and studies the numbers
-------------------------------------------------------------------- 14
26
14
Five bags of gumdrops
27 bags total
27 bags, deal
Come here Worth, this room's next move takes it to the bridge
We're coming
Over here
Move it
We don't have much time come on
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth and Kazan crawls in to Leaven's room
Leaven closes the door
They just make it, before the room moves
As we see the group again, they lie down
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth
Eaoh, it' better be it
It should be
Where
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven opens a door, there's nothing behind it
She closes it again
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Ooh, arh
Give me a minute
Be patient
So guess what, this was the room we started in
was right, we should never have moved in the first place
-------------------------------------------------------------------- The room starts to shake, it's moving
As it stops, Leaven opens the door
We see a red room
-------------------------------------------------------------------- The bridge
Red
Kazan
38079 Clear
-------------------------------------------------------------------- They enter the red room
Leaven closes the door
Kazan opens a new door
We see daylight
Worth sits down
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth
Go ahead
What are you doing
You can't quit now
It's not your fault
have nothing to live for out there
Was is out there
Boundless human stupidity
-------------------------------------------------------------------- In the background we hear a door opening
-------------------------------------------------------------------- can live with that
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Leaven says some strange sounds, she rises
Behind her we see Quentin with a door handle
Quentin has stabbed Leaven in the back
He drops her to the floor
He's covered with blood
Kazan closes the door to the daily life
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Nooo
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Worth hits Quentin quite hard
But just after Quentin does the same to Worth
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Kazan get out to the door
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Quentin stabs Worth with the handle
Worth falls to the ground
Quentin tries to reach Kazan
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Red, Kazan
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Kazan opens the door
Meanwhile the room starts to move
As Kazan is outside the room, Quentin grabs his t-shirt
As he is just halfway out he can't move anymore
Worth holds Quentins leg
Quentin gets split up in two parts
Afterwards we see the room move
There's blood on the inner cube
In the room again we see Worth crawl towards Leaven
Halfway he stops moving he dies
The last we see of the movie is Kazan looking at the inner cube, before he turns around and disappears into the bright, white light
