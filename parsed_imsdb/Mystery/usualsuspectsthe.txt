The Usual Suspects The Usual Suspects Written By Christopher McQuarrie Produced and Directed By Bryan Singer Revised, 05/25/94 White Revised, 06/01/94 Blue Revised, 06/07/94 Pink Revised, 06/11/94 Yellow 5/25/94 1 - The lonely sound of a buoy bell in the distance
Water slapping against a smooth, flat surface in rhythm
The creaking of wood
Off in the very far distance, one can make out the sound of sirens
, a single match ignites and invades the darkness
It quivers for a moment
dimly lit hand brings the rest of the pack to the match
plume of yellow-white flame flares and illuminates the battered face of  , age forty
His salty-gray hair is wet and matted
His face drips with water or sweat
large cut runs the length of his face from the corner of his eye to his chin
It bleeds freely
An un-lit cigarette hangs in the corner of his mouth
In the half-light we can make out that he is on the deck of a large boat
yacht, perhaps, or a small freighter
He sits with his back against the front bulkhead of the wheel house
His legs are twisted at odd, almost impossible angles
He looks down
thin trail of liquid runs past his feet and off into the darkness
Keaton lights the cigarette on the burning pack of matches before throwing them into the liquid
The liquid  with a poof
The flame runs up the stream, gaining in speed and intensity
It begins to ripple and rumble as it runs down the deck towards the stern

-  -                                              2' stack of oil drums rests on the stern
They are stacked on a palette with ropes at each corner that attach it to a huge crane on the dock
One of the barrels has been punctured at it's base
Gasoline trickles freely from the hole
The flame is racing now towards the barrels
Keaton smiles weakly to himself
The flame is within a few yards of the barrels when another stream of liquid splashes onto the gas
The flame fizzles out pitifully with a hiss
Two feet straddle the flame
stream of urine flows onto the deck from between them
06/01/94 2
The sound of a fly zipping
Follow the feet as they move over to where Keaton rests at the wheel house
to the waist of the unknown man
He pulls a pack of cigarettes out of one pocket and a strange antique lighter from the other
It is gold, with a clasp that folds down over the flint
The man flicks up the clasp with his thumb and strikes it with his index finger
It is a fluid motion, somewhat showy
Keaton looks up at the man
look of realization crosses his face
It is followed by frustration, anger, and finally resignation
(
) How are you, Keaton
'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser
He spits the name out like it was poison
The man puts the lighter back in his pocket and reaches under his jacket
He produces a stainless
38 revolver
(
) Ready
What time is it
The hand with the gun turns over, turning the gold watch on its wrist upward
The sound of sirens is closer now
Headed this way
(
) Twelve thirty
Keaton grimaces bitterly and nods
He turns his head away and takes another drag
The hand with the gun waits long enough for Keaton to enjoy his last drag before pulling the trigger
The sound of Keaton's body slumping onto the deck
06/11/94 3
Below is the stream of gasoline still flowing freely
The sound of the gasoline igniting
The flame runs in front of us towards the barrels, finally leaping up in a circle around the drums, burning the wood of the pallet and licking the spouting stream as it pours from the hole
, away from the boat
The pier to which the boat is moored is littered with Twenty or more men have been shot to pieces and lie scattered everywhere in what can only be the aftermath of a fierce fire-fight
On the deck of the barge is a tangle of cables and girders
The mesh of steel and rubber leaves a dark and open cocoon beneath its base
Sirens are close now
Almost here
The sound of fire raging out of control
, , Voices yelling
New light flickering in the surrounding darkness
,
Then silence
We hear the voice of  "" , whom we will soon meet
(
) New York
- six weeks ago
truck loaded with stripped gun parts got jacked outside of Queens
The driver didn't see anybody, but somebody fucked up
He heard a voice
Sometimes, that's all you need

-  -   - The black explodes with the opening of a door into a dark room
Outside, the hall is filled with blinding white light
Shadows in the shapes of men flood into the room
We can make out men in hoods with flashlights
They are laden with weapons
'
It is a blur of violent action and sound
'Beams of flashlights cut the darkness in all directions
: dozen flashlights land on one man
He lies naked in bed, Merging from a deep sleep
He squints at the flood of blinding white light, more annoyed than frightened
He nearly laughs at the sound of countless guns cocking
He is McMANUS
Age twenty-eight
(
) Mr
McManus
McMANUS Yeah
(
) Police
We have a warrant for your arrest
McMANUS Will they be serving coffee downtown
Two dozen black gloved hands grab him and yank him out of bed

-                                             4 An old paint mixer vibrates furiously
, a dark, portly man in his thirties is working on an old Fire-bird
mixes paint a few feet away
, the garage door opens  : 06/11/94 4A
row of five men silhouetted by the bright sun
Hockney squints
06/11/94 5
Can  help you
Hockney's voice is gruff
Todd Hockney' Hockney reaches for something just inside the door of the Fire-bird
Who are you
All six men    and aim them at Hockney
Police
Hockney withdraws a filthy towel and wipes grease and sweat from his forehead
We don't do gun repair
-   - , a tall, thin man in his thirties strolls casually down the street
He is dressed conspicuously in a loud suit and tie with shoes that have no hope of matching
He smokes a cigarette and chews gum at the same time
He happens to glance over his shoulder and notice a brown Ford sedan with four men in it cruising along the curb
He picks up his step a little
The Ford keeps up
He looks ahead at the corner
He tries to look as comfortable as he can, checking his watch as though remembering an appointment he is late for
The Ford stays right on him
, he bolts
He gets no more than a few yards before cars pour out of every conceivable nook and cranny
Brakes are squealing, radios squawking, guns cocking
Fenster is surrounded instantly
He stops short and flaps his hands on his thighs in defeat

'  - An attractive man and woman walk quickly through the front of a small New York cafe
They are charged with nervous, excited energy
06/11/94 5A
The man is  , a well dressed, sturdy looking man in his forties with slightly graying hair
He looks much better than he did in the opening scene
The woman with him is , age thirty-three, poised and attractive - Easily the calmer of the two
06/01/94 6
They come to a staircase at the back of the restaurant leading down to a dark room
Edie takes Keaton's arm and stops him
Let me look at you
Keaton is uncomfortable in his suit, or perhaps the situation
Still, he smiles with genuine warmth
Edie straightens his tie and picks microscopic imperfections from his lapel
(') Now remember, this is another kind of business
They don't earn your respect
You owe it to them
Don't stare them down but don't look away either
Confidence
They are fools not to trust you
That's the attitude
'm having a stroke
You've come far
You're a good man love you
Keaton blinks then stammers, looking for a response
(') Live with it
She kisses him and runs down the steps with Keaton close behind
Keaton playfully grabs her ass and she nearly stumbles down the stairs
7
- They come to the bottom of the steps giggling and jabbing each other
Once off the stairs they instantly transform as though hit with cold air
They assume a cool, professional exterior and walk two feet apart
One would look at them and see only two business associates here to ply their trade
They walk across the dimly lit dining room to a table in the far corner where two men are already waiting
The first is , age thirty-five, the other is
, age sixty
Both men are impeccably dressed with a distinguished air
They stand and smile
06/11/94 7
Edie, nice to see you
Sorry we're late
Nonsense
Sit, please
(struggling with English) You must be Mr
Keaton
'm sorry
Dean Keaton Renault's hand is already out
Monsieur Renault
pleasure
How do you do
They shake hands
Keaton takes Fortier's hand next
Monsieur Fortier
So nice to finally meet you
Everyone sits at the table
All faces are smiling
: Edie's hand reaches out and finds Keaton's leg
Her hand runs high up his inner thigh and squeezes firmly
Her face is absolutely calm, giving no hint of what her hand is doing
Keaton smiles and clears his throat

'                                             8' Follow a waiter past the flight of steps

The feet in the middle wear shoes notably nicer than the rest

-                                         10 Edie brought us your proposal and 'll be honest
We're very impressed
bit skeptical,  must admit, but impressed
Skeptical
We find the concept brilliant, but New York is difficult for new restaurants
How can we be certain that our money will be returned in the long run
Keaton looks at Edie and smiles confidently
It's simple gentlemen, design versatility
restaurant that can change with taste without losing the overall aesthetic
Our atmosphere won't be painted on the walls
This was the part of the proposal that intrigued us, but 'm not sure  follow
Let's say for example - (
) This  had to see myself
Keaton looks up
He sees David Kujan
Behind him are the very serious looking guys in suits
Keaton is not happy to see them
Dave
'm in a meeting
Time for another one
This is my attorney, Edie Finneran
(Gesturing) 06/01/94 9
(cont'd) This is Mr
Renault and Mr
Fortier
Everyone, this is David Kujan
Special Agent Kujan
Customs
(Gestures to men behind him) These gentlemen are with the New York police department
You look great, Keaton
Better than  would have thought
Is there a problem, Mr
Keaton
The small matter of a stolen truck-load of guns that wound up on a boat to Ireland last night
Renault and Fortier's confusion is giving way to suspicion
Mr
Keaton
If you will excuse us for a moment, gentlemen
We need to ask you some questions downtown
You'll be quite awhile
Renault starts to get up
We should leave you to discuss whatever this is
Please
Sit
Keaton stands up and throws a wad of money on the table to cover the check
He looks at Edie
She moves to stand, but he sits her back down with a hand on her shoulder
Enjoy the meal
(To Edie) ' call you
Kujan takes him by the arm, but Keaton yanks away
06/11/94 10
He looks out over the dozens of other faces in the restaurant
Everyone is looking at him with some level of surprise
If Keaton is humiliated by the whole affair, he hides it well

-  -                                         11' police officer steps into the frame and opens the steel door
as they shuffle across the cement floor
The shoes are shabby and worn, as are the wrinkled pants that hang too low and loose at the cuffs
The right foot is turned slightly inward and falls with a hard limp
It is clear that the knee does not extend fully
The sound of a steel door opening
The bottom corner of a steel cage comes into view
Another set of feet falls into step with the first
Another steel door and another set of feet
Another door, another and another
Five pairs of feet walk single file down the hall
The lame feet are in the front of the line
They come to another steel door, this one solid and covered with dents and rivets
: ,  to his few friends
He has a deeply lined face, making his thirty-odd years a good guess at best
From his twisted left hand, we can see that he suffers from a slight but not debilitating palsy
Behind him are Dean Keaton, Fred Fenster, McManus and Todd Hockney
t Verbal steps through the door, followed by the rest
(
) It didn't make sense that  be there mean these guys were hard-core hijackers, but there  was
At that point,  wasn't scared, f knew  hadn't done anything they could do me for
Besides, it was fun
got to make like  was notorious
12
-                                                    12 The five men are ushered into the room in front of a white wall painted with horizontal blue stripes
Each has a number at either end to denote the height of the man in front of it
Between these lines are thinner blue lines to tell the specific height in inches
5/25/94 11
Bright lights shine on all of them
They squint, eyes adjusting
Keaton leans forward a bit and looks at the men in line with him
He shares a look of familiarity with Fenster and then McManus
Hockney smiles at all of them
McMANUS (To Keaton) Where you been, man
(
) Alright, you all know the drill
When your number is called, step forward and repeat the phrase you've been given
Understand
The men all nod
(
) Number one
Step forward
Hockney takes a step forward
He looks directly into a mirror on the other side of the room
It is three feet square and we can make out faint light behind it
It is a two-way
He speaks in a complete dead-pan
Hand-me-the-keys, you-fucking-cock- sucker
(
) Number two
Step forward
McManus steps up and makes a gun with his thumb and forefinger
He mocks criminal intensity, pointing at the mirror
He camps up his line
McMANUS Give me the keys, you motherfucking, cocksucking pile of shit, or 'll rip off your (
) Get back in line
McManus steps back
The rest of the men do their bit as Verbal speaks
06/01/94 12
(
) It was bullshit
The whole rap was a setup
Everything is the cops' fault
You don't put guys like that in a room together
Who knows what can happen
13
- 13 McManus sits in a chair in front of a white wall
He smiles at someone off-screen
: This has to be embarrassing for you guys, huh
mean you know and  know this is a load of shit, but at least don't have a captain with his dick in my ass making me play along
That has got to suck, (
) Are you done
McManus Do you work for a broad
That would have to be the worst
(0
8
) Are you done
McMANUS Still,  guess dignity is a small pries to pay for medical and a pension
small pension, mind you, but a pension nonetheless
(
) They drilled us all night
Somebody was pissed about that truck getting knocked off and the cops had nothing
They were hoping somebody would slip
Give them something to go on
They knew we wouldn't fight it because they knew how to lean on us
They'd been doing it forever
Our rights went right out the window
It was a violation
mean disgraceful
06/01/94 12A
(
) They went after McManus first
He was a good guy
Crazy though
top notch entry man
(
) So where'd you dump the truck
McMANUS What truck
(
) The truck with the guns, fucko
McMANUS You kill me, you really do
Where's my phone call
(
) Right here
Suck it out
McMANUS Clever guy
(
) You want to know what your buddy Fenster told us
06/01/94 13
McMANUS Do  look stupid enough to fall for that
Jesus Christ
Beat me if you gotta, but no more of the candy-land tactics, man
(
) '
14
14 Now Fenster is in the seat
He sweats profusely

: Who

8
) McManus
Be told us another story altogether
t Was it the one about the hooker with dysentery  swear , she never mentioned money until  came
(
) Be fold us about the truck
s To be honest, it was more like a                           + mobile home
She made a lot of money,                      t (
)                                  + Who took the guns off your hands
Hey, are we talking about the same thing
(
) 'm losing my patience
06/01/94 13A
(
) Fenster always worked with McManus
He was a real tight-ass, but when it came to the job, he was right on
Smart guy gopher
Got whatever you needed for next to nothing
You guys got nothing on me
Where's your probable cause
(
) You're a known hijacker
You're sweating like a guilty motherfucker
That's my p
c
Save us the time
Tell us where the truck is
Fenster knocks on the table
Can you hear me in the back
He looks under his chair
(') Where is it
'm lookin'
It's not happening
What's going on with that want 06/01/94 14
15 15 Hockney's turn in the chair
He laughs it all off
- my lawyer
'll have your badge, cocksucker
: (') know you
You don't think  know you're on the take
This whole fucking precinct is dirty
You don't have a fucking leg to stand on
(
) Hockney was just a bad bastard
Good with explosives
Mean as a snake when it mattered
(
) You think so, tough guy
can put you in Queens the day of the hijacking
live in Queens
What the fuck is this
You come into my store and lock me up in front of my customers
What the hell is wrong with this country
Are you guys gonna charge me or what
(
) You know what happens if you do another turn in the joint
'll fuck your father in the shower
Charge me, dick-head
16
16 Now Keaton sits in the chair, cool and indifferent
(
) Keaton was the real prize for them, for obvious reasons
(
) 'll charge you when 'm ready
06/01/94 14A
with what
(
) You know damn well, dead-man
Hey, that was your mistake, not mine
Did you ever think to ask me
've been 06/11/94 15
(cont'd) walking around with the same face, same name - 'm a businessman, fellas
(
) What's that
The restaurant business
Not anymore From now on you're in the getting-fucked-by-us business
'm gonna make you famous, cocksucker
Keaton shows just a flicker of contempt
The threat has hit home
Like  said
It was all your mistake
Charge me with it and 'll beat it
Let's get back to the truck
flies into the frame and connects with Keaton's jaw
His head snaps back, blood flowing freely from his mouth
17                                                                 17 18
18 Keaton is brought in to a holding where he joins Fenster, Hockney, Verbal and McManus
He sits in a corner and keeps to himself
Fenster is in mid-tirade
Somebody should do something
What is this shit - getting hauled in every five minutes
Okay, so  did a little time, does that mean  get railed every time a truck finds its way off the planet
McManus is silently staring at Keaton, who sits on a bench, looking away
These guys got no probable cause
5/25/94 16
You're fuckin'  right, no
Well screw
No right
No goddamn right
You do some time, they never let you go
Treat me like a criminal, 'll end up a criminal
You are a criminal
Why you gotta go and do that
'm trying to make a point
Then make it
Christ, you're making me tired all over
McManus looks at Keaton
McMANUS heard you were dead, Keaton
You heard right
The word  got is you hung up your spurs, man
What's that all  about
McMANUS What's this
Rumor has it, Keaton's gone straight - cleaning house
hear he's tapping Edie Finneran
McMANUS Who
She's a heavy-weight criminal lawyer from uptown
Big-time connected
She could erase Dillinger's record if she tried hear she's Keaton's meal ticket
(To Keaton) Is it true
McMANUS What about it, Keaton
You a lawyer's wife
What sort of "retainer" you giving her
5/25/94 17
Keaton shoots McManus a fiery glare
'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet
McMANUS You're clean, Keaton
Say it ain't so
Was it you that hit that truck
Forget him
It's not important
was trying to make a point
(Ignoring McManus) This whole thing was a shakedown
McMANUS What makes you say that
How many times have you been in a line- up
It's always you and four dummies
The pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time
No way they'd line five felons in the same row
No way
And what the hell is a voice line-
up
public defender could get you off of that
So why the hell was  hauled in and cavity searched tonight
It was the Feds
truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on for some answers - they come up with us
They're grabbing at straws
It's politics - nothing you can do
had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight
Is it Friday already
5/25/94 18
Fuck you
'11 never shit right again
So who did it
Own up
don't want to know
McMANUS Nobody asked you, workin'-man
Fuck who did it
What  want to know is, who's the gimp
suddenly turn on Verbal
He has been quietly listening the whole time without uttering a word
He's alright
How do  know that
How about it, pretzel-man
What's your story
His name is Verbal Kint
thought you guys knew him
McMANUS Verbal
Roger really
People say  talk too much
Yeah,  was gonna tell you to shut up
We've met once or twice
Last time was in
County
was in for fraud
You were waiting for a line-up then, too
What happened with that
walked
Ninety days, suspended
06/11/94 19
So you did it
To your mother's ass
Verbal looks away from Hockney, awaiting a violent response
Everyone slowly starts to laugh
Hockney looks as if he is about to boil in his own skin
(To Hockney) Let it go
Verbal smiles at Keaton appreciatively
McManus stands and walks to the toilet in the corner of the cell
He starts taking a leak; McMANUS Look, we've all been put out by this, figure we owe it to ourselves to salvage a little dignity
Now Fenster and  got wind of a possible job - Why don't you just calm down' What do you care what he says
McMANUS Yeah, 'm just talking here, and Hockney seems to want to hear me out
know Fenster is with me - (To Verbal) How about you, guy
McManus finishes pissing
'm interested, sure
McMANUS There, so you see, 'm going to exercise my right to free assembly
McManus taps the bars of his cell and the others
'm not kidding
Shut your mouth
06/11/94 19A
McMANUS You're missing the point
06/11/94 20
No, you're missing the point
Shut up don't want to hear anything you have to say
don't want to know about your "job"
Just don't let me hear you
want nothing to do with any of you - (Beat) beg your pardon but all of you can go to hell
McMANUS Dean Keaton, gone the high road
What is the world coming to
McManus and Keaton stare at one another for a long and tense moment
Finally McManus turns to the others
McMANUS (') Forget him then
(Whispering) Now  can't talk about this here in any detail, but listen up
Everyone but Keaton gravitates toward McManus's cell as he begins to speak in low, hushed tones
(
) And that was how it began
The five of us brought in on a trumped-up charge to be leaned on by half-wits
What the cops never figured out, and what  know now, was that these men would never break, never lie down, never bend over for anybody
Anybody

-  -   -                            19 It is morning in the aftermath of the opening scene
Harsh sunlight shines on a line of body bags on the dock
Police swarm everywhere, photographers are taking pictures of the scene while a team of men in rolled up sleeves and plastic gloves pick at the remains
Two men on a fire boat operate a water cannon, dousing the smoldering remains of a burned-out ships hull
Watching this from the edge of the pier is a man in a dark suit
He is     of the
He is tall and fit, in his late thirties
He gazes out over the water thoughtfully
06/11/94 21
trots up to him
Who are you
Baer holds up his badge without looking at the man
Agent Jack Baer,
How many dead
Before the cop can answer, Baer turns and walks along the line of body bags
Fifteen so far
We're still pulling some bodies out of the water
Baer eyes the corpses on the dock, burned beyond recognition
Looking for anyone in particular
Baer looks at the cop for the first time, unamused
f don't want any of the bodies taken away until 've had a chance to go over this, understood
have to clear the scene
've got word direct from the Chief Baer lights a cigarette, only half listening
(Unimpressed) Yes, the chief
Spooky stuff
Any survivors
Two
There's a guy in county hospital, but he's in a coma
The
has the other guy -  cripple - from New York think
Listen, the Chief said - Excuse me
Baer walks away from the cop, ignoring him completely
He wanders through the carnage on the pier
06/11/94 22
20 20 half mile out from the pier
The sea is choppy, stirred by the wind
An object floats into view a few feet away, bobbing in the water
It is    - a man, face down, wearing a He drifts quietly toward the open ocean

-  -                         2: Verbal Kint sits in a chair in front of a microphone attached to a tape recorder, his brow beaded with sweat
On the wall behind him is the seal of the He is cleaner, better kept, in a well-cut suit and neatly trimmed hair
He looks older than he did in New York - worn down
flurry of voices banter off screen
Verbal's eyes follow the voices back and forth
#1 (
) My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings
In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible
#2 (
) The district attorney's office will comply provided - #1 No provisions, nothing
My clients testimony for his immunity
#2 May- be frank, Counselor
suspect your political power as much as  respect it
don't know why Mr
Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and  don't care
The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here
#1 Immunity
06/11/94 22A
#2 Counselor,  will prosecute your client
#1 Then prosecute
will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy
would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged "faceless people in City Hall" you mention
#2 1 One would think the counsel is veiling a threat
#1                                     + Counsel isn't veiling anything
#2 '11 take my chances then

Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession
#2 You're joking

Voices mumble off screen
Verbal fidgets in his chair
#2                                     + Misdemeanor one
Fine
This is ludicrous
tiny smile and a genuine look of disbelief flash across Verbal's face
6/11/94 22B
#2 (') (Clearing throat) As for the rest of the charges grand larceny, arson
murder - the district attorney will accept the subject's testimony in connection with the above mentioned events and in exchange will offer complete immunity
The transcript
The transcript of said testimony will be sealed and all matters incriminating to Mr
Kint will be rendered inadmissible
Verbal lets out a long-held sigh of relief

-  - 22 David Kujan is walking quickly beside  , a dark and weathered looking man in his late thirties
They move up a staircase into the heart of police headquarters
What do you mean  can't see him
The
came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county
Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the
comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man
They took his statement and cut him a deal
Did they charge him with anything
Weapons
Misdemeanor two
What'the fuck is that
Rabin motions for Kujan to lower his voice
He points out that they are walking through a bullpen filled with desks where a number of other police are working within earshot
give the
credit for getting that much to stick
This whole thing has turned political
The Mayor was here - the chief - the Governor called this morning, for Christ's sake
This guy is 06/11/94 220
(cont'd) protected - From up on high by the prince of fucking darkness
When does he post bail
Two hours, tops
want to see him
Rabin comes to an office door with his name on it
He opens it and lets Kujan in before following

'                                                   23 + Dave, please
Rabin's office can only be described as a disaster area
The desk is cluttered with weeks, perhaps months or even years of paperwork that could never conceivably be sorted out
Above his desk is a bulletin board
It is a breathtaking catastrophe of papers, wanted posters, rap-sheets, memos and + post-its
This is in the neighborhood of decades
Rabin is a man with a system so cryptic, so far beyond the comprehension of others, he himself is most likely baffled by it
(') Even if  was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you
He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired This won't be an' interrogation, just a
friendly chat to kill time
(enunciating) He won't go into the interrogation room
Someplace else, then
Where
Kujan looks around Rabin's messy office
(') No, no, no, no, no
If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in
And  am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions
You know damn well what  think
06/11/94 24A
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter
He has total immunity and his story checks out
He doesn't know what you want to know
don't think he does
Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story
want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there
Above all,  want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead
He's dead
Two hours
Just until he makes bail
They're all dead
No matter how tough you                 r
say this Keaton was, no one on that boat could've made it out alive

Ridgly, this is Special Agent Jack Baer from the
Agent Baer, this is Doctor Ridgly Waiters
Nice to meet you
Is he talking
He regained consciousness less than an hour ago
He spoke - not English - then he lapsed
Hungarian

don't It was Hungarian
Most of them were Hungarians
Any fluent Hungarians on your staff
We have a Turkish audiologist

In the center of it all is the as yet unnamed  , mid-thirties
His body is nearly mummified in bandages and plaster from waist to chin
: s <<Are you the police
need the police
He'll find out 'm here and he'll kill me
need the police will tell them anything they want to know
Please,  am going to be killed
>> will he die
There's a chance
Baer walks over to Rovash and kneels down on the bed beside him
He looks closely at his battered and scalded face
He listens to him far a moment
Kovash goes on incessantly
<<Find someone who understands me, you idiot, 'm going to be killed, You'll all be killed if he has to do it
Help me, God
They're all stupid
Get someone who understands me or we're all going to die
>> 06/11/94 30A
Baer pulls a cellular phone out of his jacket and dials
Call hospital security and put a man on the door until the police get here
<<Why are you just standing there, you idiot
'm not speaking English am
Wouldn't it make sense to find someone who could talk to me so you could find the person that set me on fire, perhaps
He is the Devil
You've never seen anyone like Keyser Soze in all your miserable life you idiot
Keyser Soze
Do you at least understand that
Keyser Soze
The Devil himself
Or are you American policemen io stupid that you haven't even heard of him
Keyser Soze, you ridiculous man
>> 06/01/94 31
Ridgly runs out of the room
Kovash babbles louder and louder, trying to get Baer's attention
Baer sticks a finger in one ear to block him out and hear the phone
Is he dangerous
Yes
Someone picks up on the other end of the phone
(') Joel, it's Baer
'm down at
county
The guy they pulled out of the harbor is Kovash
Yes, 'm sure
No, he's all fucked up
What
can't hear you
(To Arkosh) Shut up, Hugo, 'm on the phone
(Into Phone) Yes
No
Not until  put someone on him
Listen,  need you to send me someone who can speak Hungarian
He's awake and talking like a Thai hooker
How should  know
Get me someone who can talk to him - Baer is suddenly distracted by something Kovash has said
In the middle of a long string of unintelligible dialect, he has spouted two words that have gotten Baer's attention
He turns and looks down at the tattered man in the bed
Kovash realizes Baer is listening and says the two words again
Keyser - Soze
What
He waves his hand, gesturing for Kovash to say it again
Keyser - Soze
No shit
(Into Phone) Joel, call Dan Metzheiser over at Justice and find Dave Kujan from Customs

-                                         26 Rabin walks out of a small room
Behind him, we catch a glimpse of a workroom with a bench covered with wires
Kujan comes out a moment later, gently fixing his tie
Rabin opens the door to his office and Kujan enters
Rabin follows, looking up and down the hall before closing the door behind them
As the door closes we can just make out the back of Verbal's head
He is seated in Rabin's office, smoking a cigarette
27
'                                                  27 Kujan and Rabin sit down across from Verbal
06/11/94 34
(Exasperated) Verbal, you know we're trying to help you
Sure
And  appreciate that
And  want to help you, Agent Kujan
like cops would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my
was - Verbal,  know you know something
know you're not telling us everything
told the
everything  know
28 28 Rabin stands over , a messy looking technician at his workbench in a room full of electronic equipment
He adjusts several dials on a receiver until the voices of Kujan and Verbal come clearly through a tinny speaker on the wall
Rabin reaches over for a nearby pot of coffee
() know you liked Keaton  know you think he was a good man
() know he was good
() He was a corrupt cop, Verbal
29
'                                                   29 Sure
Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit
Keaton was a piece of shit
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan
06/11/94 34A
just want to hear your story
06/11/94 35
It's right here
He taps a finger on the stack of paper that Kujan brought in
Kujan picks it up and thumbs through it
According to your statement you are a short-con operator
Run of the mill seams
Everything you do, you learned from somebody else
That's been suppressed
Anything in there is inadmissible
Oh,  know
Sweet deal you have
Total immunity
(laughing) Well  do have the weapons charge
'm looking at six whole months hard time
(smiling) You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal
You know a religious guy named John Paul
You know Ruby is in Attica
He didn't have my lawyer
know Ruby
He's very big on respect
Likes me very much
Verbal sees this getting to something
His smiles fades
(') Now  know your testimony was sealed
Ruby is well connected
He still has people running errands for him
What do you think he'd say if he found out you dropped his name to the
5/25/94 36
There's nothing in there about Ruby
'11 be sure to mention that to him
Verbal is not smiling anymore
He stares at Kujan with utter contempt, knowing he is being shafted
(') The first thing  learned on the job, know what it was
How to spot a murderer
Let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing
Put them all in jail overnight
The next morning, whoever is sleeping is your man
If you're guilty, you know you're caught, you get some rest - let your guard down, you follow
No
'11 get right to the point
'm smarter than you
'11 find out what  want to know and '11 get it from you whether you like it or not
'm not a rat
Kujan puts his hand on the transcript of Verbal's confession
Rabin walks in with a cup of coffee
Verbal takes it with his good hand and sips it with a relish
(') Ahhh
Back when  was picking beans in Guatemala we used to make fresh coffee
Right off the trees  mean
That was good
This is shit, but hey
Can we get started again
Now what happened after the line-up
Verbal sneers at Kujan, unable to change the subject
06/01/94 37
30
-  -   -            30 Keaton stops at the top of the front steps of the police station and lights a cigarette
Edie comes out behind him, fuming mad
and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you
Can you believe that
You weren't even charged
New York police - Jesus
want to take pictures of your face to bring to the
first thing in the morning
Just forget about it
He looks across the street and sees Fenster and McManus talking by a newsstand
McManus is thumbing through magazines
Absolutely not
Keaton looks to his right and sees Hockney trying to hail a cab
(') '11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday
Edie, please
don't want to hear this right now
What did Renault and Fortier say
They want more time to think about investing
Goddamnit
They just said they wanted time
Time for what, Edie
Time to look into me a little more, that's what
No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who  am
5/25/94 38
Give me some credit
got you this far, let's go to the grand jury
This is never going to stop if we - No
It's never going to stop, period
It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us
It's finished
'm finished
Just then, Verbal bumps into him on his way out the door
He excuses himself and hobbles down the steps, oblivious to who he has bumped into as he tries to navigate the stairs
Don't give up on me now, Dean
They'll never stop
love you
(To himself) They ruined me tonight
Dean,  love you
Do you hear me
Verbal gets to the sidewalk and stops
He turns, realizing it is Keaton on the steps
(') Let's just go to my place
We'll worry about this tomorrow
Keaton and Verbal look at one another for a moment
Keaton then looks over to the newsstand and sees Fenster looking at him
Huh
McManus notices Fenster and glances up from his magazine to see what he is looking at
+ Come home with me, please
Dean
5/25/94 39
Keaton looks at Hockney who has one foot in a cab
He is looking at Fenster and McManus who are looking at Keaton
This makes Hockney look up at Keaton as well
, Edie tunes in to what is going on
She notices the others on the street
She reaches over and takes Keaton by the arm, pulling gently
She glares at the others
Come home, Dean
(Distant) Alright
Verbal looks at everyone else from where he stands on the street
Fenster, McManus and Hockney all look at him and then at each other
It is a strange moment of unspoken understanding
All eyes finally turn to Keaton, high on the front steps of the police station as he walks away with Edie
31
-                                                    31 Verbal stands in front of an apartment door
He hesitates for a long moment before he knocks
After a moment, the door opens and Keaton stands on the other side of it
He is wearing a bathrobe and smoking a cigarette
He looks at Verbal without any expression whatsoever
What are you doing here'
How did you find me
just asked one of the detectives downtown
He seemed pretty happy to tell me
Keaton curses under his breath and motions for Verbal to come in
32 32
' Verbal walks in and sits down on the couch, watching Keaton cautiously
He looks around the large apartment, beautifully furnished and decorated
5/25/94 40
Edie walks into the room in a man's button-down shirt and sweat pants
Dean, who was at the She stops when she sees Verbal
Verbal stands and smiles nervously
How do you do
Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran
Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at (Cold) know who he is
hope  didn't disturb you
hope so, too, Mr
Kint
Can  get you something to drink
glass of water would be nice
Edie shoots a look at Keaton on her way out of the room
Keaton tries to hush his voice despite his anger
What the hell do you want
wanted to talk to you
The other guys - did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends
'm sorry, but  have other things - They're gonna do a job
Three million dollars, maybe more
Keaton is speechless
Verbal sits on the couch again
5/25/94 41
(') They sent me to offer you a cut
We could use a fifth man - a driver - That's all you'll do
Edie walks in with a glass of ice water and hands it to Verbal
(') Thank you
Verbal drinks slowly
Edie stands over him, her face blank
It is an awkward moment
She deliberately makes Verbal uncomfortable
- : So what is it you do, Mr
Kint
Umm
hijacker like Dean, here
Or something more creative
That's enough, Edie
(Angry) don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it
Edie, please
Keaton takes Edie by the arm and tries to guide her toward the other room
She pulls away, anger turning to rage
've spent the last year of my life putting his back together again -  won't have you come in here and - What makes you think -
m
Keaton is pulling her now
She yanks her arm away and shoves him
06/11/94 42
Don't touch me
Just don't, She turns and walks out of the room
Somewhere in the back of the apartment, a door slams
Keaton turns and glares at Verbal
Verbal cringes
Get out
If you'll just let me - ,
He grabs Verbal by the lapels and lifts him off the couch, moving him effortlessly across the room and slamming him into the wall next to the front door
He opens it
(') Don't hurt me
(Seething) Hurt you, you sonofabitch
could kill you
Keaton starts to shove Verbal out the door
(Quickly) They're going to hit the Taxi Service
Keaton freezes
New York's Finest Taxi Service
They - That's bullshit
They don't operate anymore
McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct
They're coming out for one job - Thursday
They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America
Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff
06/11/94 43
What fence
Who
Some guy in California
His name is Redfoot
Never heard of him
Keaton moves to throw Verbal out
Verbal grabs Keaton and holds tight
You have to come
What's with you
What do you care whether come or not
They - They don't know me
You do
They won't take me unless you go
Look at me
need this
Tough break
Don't tell me you don't need this
Is this your place
Keaton is unable to answer
(') They're never going to stop with us, you know that
This way we hit the cops where it hurts and get well in the mean time
Keaton lets Verbal go and steps back, thinking
(') As clean as you could ever get, they'll never let you go now
5/25/94 44
(cont'd) 'm not knocking you
You look like you've got a good little seam going with this lawyer - Keaton punches Verbal in the stomach and drops him to one knee
Verbal coughs and tries to find his breath
You watch your mouth
(Gasping) Okay, okay
You say it's the real thing
That's cool
Keaton reaches for Verbal
Verbal flinches
Keaton gently helps him up and guides him to the couch
They bath sit
Keaton reaches for a pack of cigarettes and lights one for each of them
apologize
Verbal takes one and has a few drags, catching his breath and rubbing his stomach in pain
: was out of line
You okay
'11 be alright
Well, 'm sorry
Forget it
(Beat) '11 probably shit blood tonight
Keaton laughs
Verbal thinks about it for a moment and laughs with him
Keaton's laughter trails off
He thinks for a moment
5/25/94 45
How are they going to do it
McManus wants to go in shooting
said no way
Fenster and Hockney
They're pretty pissed off
They'll do anything
Now  got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like  said, they won't let me in without you
Three million
Maybe more
No killing
Not if we do it my way
(Lost in thought) swore 'd live above myself
Verbal smiles, knowing he has him

What the Strausz looks in front of him
green minivan swerves in front of them from out of nowhere
Strausz slams on the brakes and skids to a halt
The white minivan rams them from behind
Strausz and Rizzi are stunned for a moment as two more vans screech up on either side of the cruiser, boxing it in with only a few inches between them
The cruiser is surrounded on all sides

They come to rest, one on Strausz's left temple one on Rizzi's right
looks out of the corner of his eye
He sees the driver of the van next to him holding the shotgun with one hand
stocking is over the driver's head
Strausz looks straight ahead
The minivan in front of them is missing a back window
Another man with a stocking on his head aims a sub-machine gun at them from inside

The man standing on the roof doubles over and sticks a gun in Strausz's face
His face hangs upside down and looks gruesome - covered from the mouth up in a stocking

Strausz dares to turn his head right at the shotgun pointing at him through the window
On the other end is a masked and smiling Todd Hockney

McManus lights a pack of matches and drops them on the roof of the car as he jumps off

You really expect me to believe he retired
For a woman
Bullshit
He was using her
He loved her
Sure
And 'm supposed to believe that hitting the Taxi Service wasn't his idea either

Keaton was a cop for four years
Who else would know the Taxi Service 06/07/94 53

That job had his name all over it

It wasn't like that
Sure he knew, but Edie had him all turned around
r 'm telling you straight,  swear
+ Let me tell you something
know Dean Keaton
've been investigating him for three years
The guy  know is a cold-                    + blooded bastard
indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold
+ You got him wrong
Do
Keaton was under indictment a total                 + of seven times when he was on the force
+ In every case, witnesses either reversed                  + their testimony to the grand jury or died                 + before they could testify
When they                      t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  + five years in Sing Sing
He killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death
Of course  can't prove this but can't prove the best part either
Kujan pauses to drink some coffee
(') Dean Keaton was dead
Did you know that
r He died in a fire two years ago during an investigation into the murder of a witness who was going to testify against him
Two people saw Keaton enter a warehouse he owned just before it went up
They said he had gone in to check a                   + leaking gas main
It blew up and took all of Dean Keaton with it
Within three months of the explosion, the two witnesses were dead, one killed himself in his car and the other fell down an open elevator shaft

(On Speaker) Six weeks ago  get an anonymous call telling me  can find Keaton eating at Mondino's with his lawyer, and there he is
Now because he never profited from his alleged death and because someone else was convicted for the murder we tried to pin on Keaton, we had to let him go
51
'                                                   51 (') He was dead just long enough for a murder rap to blow over, then he had lunch
5/25/94 55
don't know about that
don't think you do
But you say you saw Keaton die
think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor
My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend
You tell me he's dead, so be it
want to make sure he's dead before go back to New York
(Blurting) He wasn't behind anything
It was the lawyer
What lawyer
(') What lawyer, Verbal
Verbal stammers for a moment, looking around wildly
Back when  was in that barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois  used to have Kujan grabs Verbal's shirt and yanks him half out of his seat
You think  don't know you held out on the

You'll be the lowest sort of rat, the prince of snitches, the loudest cooing stool pigeon that ever grabbed his ankles for the man
Now you talk to me, or that precious immunity they've seen so fit to grant you won't be worth the paper the contract put out on your life is printed on
Verbal looks at Kujan with utter contempt
There was a lawyer
Kobayashi
Is he the one that killed Keaton
No
But 'm sure Keaton's dead
Convince me
Tell me every last detail

The young couple smile at one another nervously

-  - 54 (
) McManus' fence was this guy named Redfoot
He had a good reputation around Seemed like a good guy - Looked like a cowhide full of thumbtacks
55
-                                     55' All five guys stand in a group
It is utterly quiet
An old but well kept Cadillac creeps into the lot from the far end and idles up to them
The windows are tinted too much to see in
The car passes within a few feet of them and drives on
moment later, a chrome and leather monster of a Harley Davidson pulls into the lot
The rider is dressed in an almost comical array of leather, silver and suede
He waves to the Caddy as it parks a few yards from Keaton and the others
It sits quietly, almost menacing
As he gets closer, we can see he is wearing one black boot and one red
Keaton is still looking at them when the bike pulls up to them and stops
and McManus shake hands
How've you been
McMANUS Good
You
Alright
How's it going, Fenster
Getting by
5/25/94 60
You got it
McManus holds up a briefcase
Redfoot takes it and gets off the bike
He walks over to the Caddy
The door of the Caddy opens
Redfoot hands the case to Someone inside that we cannot see
The door closes
(Whispering) Snazzy dresser this guy
moment later, the door of the Caddy opens again
Someone hands Redfoot a different briefcase and he walks back over to McManus
He hands him the case
McManus hands the case back to Hockney
Hockney opens it, revealing the stacks of money inside
You must be Keaton
McMANUS Jesus, 'm sorry
Redfoot, this is Dean Keaton, that's Todd Hockney, and that's Verbal Kint
(To Verbal) The man with the plan
Verbal smiles
(') Are you guys interested in more work
McManus moves to answer, but Keaton cuts him off
We're on vacation
've got a ton of work and no good people
McMANUS What's the job
5/25/94 61
Keaton shoots McManus a foul look
McManus pretends not to notice
jeweler out of Texas named Saul
He rents a suite at a hotel downtown and does free appraisals
Buys whatever he can
Word is he moves with a lot of cash
'11 take the merchandise, you keep the green
Security
Two bodyguards
Pretty good
McMANUS Give us time to check it out
'd expect nothing less
McMANUS We'll call you
Take your time
Enjoy
friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis
hear you did time with old Spook
Yeah, he was a good egg
used to run a lot of dope for him
Fuckin' shame he got shivved
shivved him
Now McManus is shooting the angry look at Keaton
(') Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later
Business or personal
5/25/94 62
little of both
Ain't it a crime
Call if you're interested
Redfoot fires up his bike and takes off with the Caddy close behind
McMANUS (To Keaton) What's your fucking problem
One job, that was the deal
McMANUS Take it as it comes, brother
This is bullshit
McManus laughs and walks away
Fenster and Hockney follow
Verbal turns to Keaton
What is it Keaton
(Distant) Something -  don't know
(Shaking himself) ever tell you about the restaurant wanted to open
Keaton walks off
Verbal follows him in confusion
(
) , was good for about two hours
We were from New York
There's no place to eat after one; you can't get a pizza that doesn't taste like a fried fruit-bat, and the broads don't want to know you if you don't look like a broad
Within a few days the last of us was ready to go back to
, but Keaton wouldn't have it, so he really didn't have a choice
We went to work

- McManus walks along a line of cars
He comes across a black Mercedes and stops
He looks down at the license plate and walks over to the next car, a green Honda
He pulls a slim- jim out of his jacket and pops the lock an the Honda
He reaches in and opens the hood
He walks around and sticks his head in the engine
57
57 Verbal sits behind the wheel
Keaton is beside him
Hockney and Fenster are in the back
They all watch McManus from where they are parked a few dozen yards away
58
58 - The elevator bell sounds at the far end of the garage
The doors open
Two men in ill-fitting suits get out and look around cautiously
The first is , a big bellied, white haired menace
The other is , lean and bad skinned
They are bodyguards and give it away by their every careful move
They turn back to the elevator and motion to someone inside
Out walks  , a slightly overweight man in his forties with an open collar silk shirt and a thick gold chain on his hairy chest
He carries a
He lets his guards do the worrying
He walks straight to his car
Saul passes McManus under the hood of the Honda
He takes out his keys and pushes a button on his key chain
The Mercedes beeps three times and tells Saul his alarm is off
Tucci keeps an eye on McManus
Higham watches Saul
McManus pretends to tinker with the car's engine
He has put a pistol just inside the grill and keeps it within reach
The van on the other side of the garage starts and pulls out of the spot
It cruises over toward the Mercedes
Tucci sees the van
He and Higham are suddenly busy trying to keep track
They hear laughing behind them and turn around
06/11/94 64
and  are walking towards them
They are sporting mustaches and sunglasses in addition to matching suits, each with loud plaid sport coats, decades out of style
Saul glances at Tucci and Higham
Just get in the car Saul
Under the hood of the Honda and out of sight, McManus pulls on a black ski mask
The van gets closer
get out of the car, and man if the thing wasn't wrecked
And  see this broad in the back seat with nothing on
Saul gets in the car quickly but calmly as Fenster and Hockney laugh and talk louder
They look drunk - The desired effect
(') 'm laughing so hard  can't breathe - Tucci and Higham try to take it all in stride
Saul's reverse lights come on and he begins to back out of the spot
(') And the fat guy comes out of the car with his pants on backwards and says - , the van revs and screeches to a halt behind Saul's Mercedes, blocking him in
Hockney and Fenster drop the drunk act and snap to
They both pull out guns and start screaming
(') ' ,
McManus comes up from under the hood
Tucci and Higham throw their hands in the air
Hockney and Fenster grab them and reach into their belts to get their guns
Keaton jumps out of the van and runs up to Saul's car, his face covered in a ski mask
He yanks on the door handle but it is locked
Saul sits in terror behind the wheel
Keaton pulls out a pistol and smashes the window with it
06/11/94 65
Give me the case
Saul reaches over for the case
Keaton trains the gun on him
, Saul comes up with a pistol and points it at Keaton
Keaton sidesteps and grabs his wrist
The gun goes off into the fender of the Honda
Hockney and Fenster both look over at the sound of the gun
Tucci and Higham seize the opportunity
Tucci grabs Hockney, Higham grabs Fenster
The four men grapple for the guns
Fenster's gun falls to the floor
McManus picks it up
He trains a pistol on each bodyguard and takes a breath
They are some ten feet apart and moving erratically
Hockney and Fenster constantly fall in the line of fire
McManus walks around the four men, keeping a pistol trained on each of the guards
Finally he comes to an angle where they are all in front of him
One guard is a few feet away, the other is ten feet past him
McMANUS'
The closer of the two moves in and out of the sights of the pistol in McManus' right hand, the one farther away does the same with the left
Verbal gets out of the van and moves towards them to help
Both of McManus' guns go off like one shot
Tucci and Higham collapse, each with a bullet in his head The only sound is Saul grappling with Keaton for the gun
His arm is halfway out the window
His elbow rests in the door frame
Keaton cannot get the gun out of his hand
Finally, he pushes down with all his weight
Saul's elbow breaks backwards on the door frame
He screams in agony
The gun falls from his hand
06/01/94 66
All five of the men look at each other for an impossibly long moment
The confusion is only aggravated by Saul's screaming
, Keaton raises his pistol and aims it at Saul
His hand trembles, his eyes squint to near slits
His finger tenses and slacks off over and over again on the trigger
Keaton looks at him in surprise
Verbal trembles more than he does
The garage is silent
What the hell
McManus Bad day
Fuck it
- The elevator light comes on
All five men look
Move
Keaton reaches into the car and grabs Saul's case
Everyone else piles into the van
Keaton gets in as Verbal is driving for the exit
59
59 The mood in the van is grim
Everyone is silent
Keaton pops the clasps on the case and opens it
Son of a bitch
Everyone looks in the case
It is filled with cash on one side
The other side is filled with clear plastic bags of 60
-                                              60 Keaton and the others stand in silhouette in front of the lights of an oncoming car in the distance
We can make out McManus loading a gun
+ What are you doing
06/11/94 67
McMANUS What does it look like
'm going to kill him
We did it your way
Now '11 deal with him
You gonna kill him
'm going to deal with him
The car, Redfoot's escort Caddy, is now in front of them
The horn lets out three short blasts
Redfoot comes around from behind the Caddy on his motorcycle
He gets off the bike, trying to hide a faint smile
McManus throws Saul's case on the ground in front of him
McMANUS What the fuck is this, Redfoot
Get a grip
didn't know
You didn't know
06/11/94 68
The job got thrown to me by this lawyer
Who is he
Some Limey
He's a middle-man for somebody
He doesn't say and  don't ask
We want to meet him
He wants to meet you
He called last night and asked me to set it up
What do tell him' Tell him we'll meet
McMANUS If you're lying, Redfoot
McManus, you're a real bad-ass, but get off my tip
McManus lunges for Redfoot
The Caddy doors instantly pop open and rifle barrels come into view from within
Fenster and Hockney draw guns and aim at the Caddy
Keaton and Verbal grab McManus and hold him back
Redfoot gets on his Harley, smiling defiantly
(') Real shame about Saul getting whacked
Lot's of cops looking for the guys that did it
'm sure They'll get around to asking me
He starts his bike
06/11/94 69
McMANUS Fuck you
Redfoot drives off
The Caddy waits until he is completely out of sight before following
61
'  -  -                                 61 So this lawyer
Kobayashi
Came from Redfoot
Right
And why leave this out when you talked to the
Rabin sticks his head in
Someone to see you, Agent Kujan
Kujan steps out into the hall, shutting the door behind him
62
'                                      62 Kujan smiles instantly, recognizing the man standing with Rabin
Jack
What are you doing here
've been looking all over for you
You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor
Yeah
You can stop looking
There was no coke
've been in
county with a guy they 06/07/94 70
(cont'd) pulled out of a drainpipe in San Pedro yesterday after the shoot-out
He came to                 + this morning and started talking
He was part of a Hungarian mob there to do a deal with a bunch of goats from Argentina
He says it was definitely not a dope deal
There was ninety-one million - We know, but our man says no way on the dope
This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day
They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it
What was the money for
He didn't know
No one doing the deal knew except a few key people
This guy says they were real hush about it
Whatever it was it was highly sensitive
don't get it
They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there
He mention Keyser Soze Who
Bear with me here
63 63
'  - - The door bursts open
Who is Keyser Soze Verbal looks up in shock
He drops his cigarette and trembles at the mere mention of the name
06/11/94 71
Ahhh fuck
64
-  -                 64' Keaton stands while the rest sit and listen
So  need to know if anyone can think of anybody
Somebody with power
Enough to possibly track us from New York
McMANUS Look
We've been over it for an hour now
say we pack up and run
Let's go back to New York
At least get out of
, The sound of a man clearing his throat
Everyone turns to the door behind them
a tall, slim, well groomed man stands in the hall
He has a briefcase in his hand
He smiles politely
Mr
Keaton
Keaton stands back and lets him in
Kobayashi looks them over
(') am Mr
Kobayashi
've been asked by my employer to bring a proposal to you gentlemen
That must be Mr
Hockney recognize Mr
Fenster from his mug shot, as well as Mr
McManus
(To Verbal) can only assume that you are Mr
Kint
believe you were the one who disposed of Saul
My employer sends his gratitude
most unexpected benefit
Everyone looks at one another in shock that he would know this
What can we do for you
06/01/94 72
My employer requires your services
One job
One day's work
Very dangerous don't expect all of you to live, but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit
Who's your boss
My employer wishes to remain anonymous
Don't jerk me off
We all know what this is
You don't work with me if  work with you without knowing who 'm working for
Now let's cut the shit
Who's the man
work for Keyser Sate
strange look crosses Keaton's face
Skepticism, mockery and just a hint of fear
Hockney, McManus and Fenster all share similar looks
What is this
Who's Keyser Soze
am sure you've heard a number of tall tales, myths and legends about Mr
Soze can assure you gentlemen, most of them are true
Who's Keyser Soze
Judging by the sudden change in mood, am sure the rest of your associates can tell you, Mr
Kint
have come with an offer directly from Mr
Soze
An order actually
An order
06/01/94 73
In nineteen-eighty one, Mr
Keaton, you participated in the hijacking of a truck in Buffalo, New York
The cargo was raw steel
Steel that belonged to Mr
Soze and was destined for Pakistan to be used in a Nuclear reactor
very profitable violation of
Regulations
You had no way of knowing this, because the man shipping the steel was working for Mr
Sate without his knowledge
+ (Beat) Mr
Fenster and Mr
McManus hijacked a twin-prop cargo flight earlier this year out of Newark airport
The plane was carrying platinum and gold wiring
Also set for Pakistan
Kobayashi turns and points at Hockney
(') Two months ago, Mr
Hockney stole a truck carrying gun parts through Queens - Everyone looks at Hockney
He smiles shyly
It occurs to them all that he robbed the truck for which they were all arrested in the first place
(') - guns allegedly set to be destroyed by the state of New York
They were to be "lost" in a weigh station and routed to Belfast
Again, Mr
Sate using pawns who had no knowledge
(turning to Verbal) Which brings us to Mr
Kint
Verbal crumbles under his stare
(') Nine months ago, one of Mr
Soze less than intelligent couriers was taken in a complicated confidence seam by a cripple
He was relieved of sixty-two thousand dollars
Now (To all of them) - It has taken us some time to find you
Our intention was to approach you after your apprehension in New York
06/01/94 74
You set up the line-up
Mr
Soze made a few calls, yes
You were not to be released until  came to see you
It seems Mr
Keaton's attorney, Ms
Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release
Holding the rest of you became a moot point
What about Redfoot
Mr
Redfoot knew nothing
Mr
Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for
One cannot be betrayed if one has no people
So why tell us
Because you have stolen from Mr
Soze
That you did not know you stole from him is the only reason you are still alive, but he feels you owe him
You will repay your debt
Who is this guy
How do we know you work for Soze don't think that is relevant, Mr
Hockney
The five of you are responsible for the murder of Saul Berg and his bodyguards
Mr
Redfoot can attest to your involvement, and we can see to it that he will
He is not of your "superior" breed
This is a load of shit
The offer is this, gentlemen
Mr
Soze's primary interest, as  am sure you all know, is narcotics
He's been - competing shall we say, with a group of 06/11/94 75
(cont'd) Argentinians for several years
Competing with Mr
Soze has taken its toll
These Argentinians are negotiating the sale of ninety-one million dollars in cocaine in three days time
Needless to say, this purchase will revitalize the diminishing strength of their organization
Mr
Soze wants you to stop the deal
If you choose, you may wait until the buy
Whatever money changes hands is yours
The transaction will take place on a boat in San Pedro
Mr
Soze wants you to get to the boat and destroy the cocaine on board
Then you are free of your obligation to Mr
Soze
Give me one good reason why  shouldn't kill you right now
Kobayashi smiles and puts his briefcase on the table in front of him
gift from Mr
Soze gentlemen
He turns and walks out of the room
Keaton walks over to the case and opens it
He reaches in and pulls out five thick manila envelopes, each marked in bold black letters
"", "McMANUS", "", "" and "" Keaton pulls out the files, revealing a map underneath
Keaton hands each man his file
He opens his first
He pulls out a thick stack of papers and thumbs through them
Jesus Christ
Open them
All of the men open their files
Inside are mug shots of each man in his respective file as well as a printout of his criminal record
But there is more
They know everything
McMANUS This is my life in here
Everything 've done since  was eighteen
06/01/94 76
Everybody  ever worked with, did time with
They fucking know everything
Keaton pulls out a large black and white photograph of himself and his lawyer
They are laughing arm in arm by a fountain in New York
He hides the photo from the others
This is not right
don't know
Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York
McMANUS Bricks Marlin
Yeah
He said he did jobs for him
Indirect stuff
Always five times more money than the job was worth
Come on
The guy is a pipe dream
This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing
don't know
This is bad
It's bullshit
This guy could be
think it's a setup
The way  hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher
No pity
There' is no Keyser Soze Verbal thumbs through his file
long list of names, numbers, addresses
It is a detailed portfolio of his entire criminal and personal life
He looks up at Keaton
06/01/94 77
Who is Keyser Soze 65
'  -  -                                  65 Kujan leans into Verbal's face
He hangs on his every word
He is supposed to be Turkish
Some say                   r his father was German
Nobody believed he was real
Nobody ever saw him or knew anybody that ever worked directly for him, but to hear Kobayashi tell it, anybody could have worked for Soze
You never knew
That was his power
The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist
One story the guys told me - the story believe - was from his days in Turkey
There was a petty gang of Hungarians that wanted their own mob
They realized that to be in power you didn't need guns or money or even numbers
You just needed                   + the will to do what the other guy wouldn't
After a while they come to power, and then they come after Soze He was small time then, just running dope, they say
66                                                         66 67
'  -                                             67 Three of the Hungarians come bursting into Keyser Soze's            + home
They grab his five children and round them up in the front room
One of the men grabs his wife and back-hands her across the face
06/01/94 78
(
) They come to his home in the afternoon looking for his business
They find his wife and kids in the house and decide to wait for Sate
68
'  -                                             68' The front door opens and in walks Keyser Sate
We are never         t allowed to see his face
Sate's wife lies in the corner, beaten and bruised
Her dress is tattered to shreds
She cannot look up at her husband
The three Hungarians stand to greet him
Two hold guns in their hands
The third holds a straight razor
He grabs Soze youngest boy and holds the razor to his throat
(
) He comes home to his wife raped and his children screaming
The Hungarians knew Soze was tough
Not to be trifled with
So they let him know they meant business
The Hungarian smiles
Soze's wife
The Hungarian holds up a
, he grabs another child
little girl no older than six
(
) They tell Soze they want his territory - all his business
Soze looks over the                    + faces of his family
Then he showed these men of will what will really was
, Soze pulls out a pistol and shoots the two men with guns
He turns and aims at the third man holding his child
The man threatens to cut the child's throat, slicing just enough to draw blood
The stunned Hungarian watches the child fall from his arms
Sate turns the pistol on the next child, then the next and the next
He kills his children one by one in front of the Hungarian
06/07/94 79
(
) He tells him he would rather' see his family dead than live another day after this
walks over to his wife, crying and beaten on the floor and holds up her head
She gives him the strangest look
One of trust perhaps, saturated with fear and humiliation
He puts the gun between her eyes and fires
(
) He lets the last Hungarian go, and he goes running
He waits until his wife and kids are in the ground and he goes after the rest of the mob
He kills their kids, he kills their wives, he kills their parents and their parents' friends
dark and looming figure of a man walks in front of a wall of fire - a black shadow blurred by waves of heat
(
) He burns down the houses they live in and the stores they work in, he kills people that owe them money
And like that he was gone
Underground
No one has ever seen him again
He becomes a myth, a spook story that criminals tell their kids at night
If you rat on your pop, Keyser Sate will get you
And nobody really ever believes
69 69
'  - Do you believe in him, Verbal
Keaton always said: " don't believe in God, but 'm afraid of him
" Well believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser
70 70 Jack Baer and Rabin listen to Verbal on the speaker with one ear
You give this any weight, Agent Baer
06/07/94 80
can introduce you to Dan Metzheiser from Justice
He has a file on Sate in It's been a hobby of his for a few years
lot of guys equate him to that reporter on the Incredible Hulk
Had you heard of him before
On the street
few times
Outside stuff
Somebody was working for a guy who was working for a guy who got money through Keyser Soze
That kind of shit
Could be an old badge
hex sign to keep people from fucking with you back when a name meant something
But you're here
Shit yeah
got a guy trying to walk out of the hospital on d fried drumstick to get away from

'                                                   71 came clean
told it like it happened on the boat
So what if  left out how got there
It's got so many holes in it, the
would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass
So you got what you wanted out of me
Big fucking deal
And this is why you never told the
You tell me, Agent Kujan
If  told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say
Turn state's evidence
Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out
06/01/94 81
've got immunity now
What can you possibly offer me
If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you
Where's your head, Agent Kujan
Where do you think the pressure's coming from
Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where  am right now
He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later
Immunity was just to deal with you assholes
got a whole new problem when  post bail
So why play into his hands
We can protect you
Gee, thanks, Dave
Bang-up job so far
Extortion, coercion
You'll pardon me if ask you to kiss my pucker
The same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me They'll bail me out
Fuck you
You think you can catch Keyser Soze
You think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out
If he comes up for anything, it will be to get rid of me
(beat) After that, my guess is you'll never hear from him again

75 75  ' That was how  ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois
This is totally irrelevant
Oh, but it's not
If  hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets,  never would have took off for New York
never would have met Keaton, see
That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything
Can we just get back to Kobayashi
The quartet is part of the bit about Kobayashi
The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing  had done since high school, see
Aliases, middle- men
They knew me better than  did
They knew all of us
Kujan looks at his watch
You're stalling, Verbal
Give a guy a break, huh
What happened
Verbal slumps a bit
He realizes his stalling tactic has failed
We woke up the next morning and Fenster was gone
He couldn't handle the idea of slumming for
He left a note wishing us good luck and took a chunk of the money we'd scraped together
5/25/94 84
Then what
McManus was furious
He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit
That night we got the call
What call
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster
76
-  -                                  76 Keaton looks out over the ocean and smokes a cigarette
What do you want to do with him
McManus kneels in the sand
Hockney and Verbal stand behind him, staring at something in front of them
It is the body of Fred Fenster, literally peppered with bullet holes
McManus stares at him, fighting any flicker of emotion
McMAMJS worked five years with Fenster
More jobs, more money than  can count
'm sorry, McManus
McMANUS want to bury him
No time
McManus springs to his feet and points a pistol at Keaton
Keaton turns to face him and raises his head
McManus might as well be pointing a feather-duster
McMANUS You're not the only one with debts, man
06/11/94 85
No shovel
McMANUS 77
77' Everyone digs in the sand on the deserted beach with their hands
They are up to their waists in the hole they have scooped out
Fenster's body is a few feet away
This is nuts
McMANUS Dig
This is fucking dry sand, man
When he rots, the surfers'll smell him from a hundred yards out
McMANUS ,
Hockney can see that McManus has truly gone over the edge for now
Keaton gives him a look that says don't argue
Keaton, we gotta go
They're gonna find him
Dig
What are we gonna do
can run
got no problem with that
They don't seem to have a problem with it either
McMANUS Nobody runs
This ain't my boy we're burying
don't owe anybody
5/25/94 86
McMANUS We got a deal here
Since when
McMANUS Since tonight
+ Fuck that
McMANIJS It's payback
'
don't answer to you
+ It's precaution
You want payback
You want to run
don't care
'm going to finish this thing
Not for Fenster, not for anybody else, but for me
This Kobayashi cocksucker isn't going to stand over me
(Beat) All of you can go to hell
Keaton turns and digs furiously with both hands
Hockney takes a moment and slowly starts to do the same
The four men dig for Fenster
The first to find some rest
78
'  -  -                                  78 Verbal smokes with his good hand shaking badly
And after they killed Fenster nobody would run
wanted to
thought we could make it
Why didn't you say anything
tried, believe me, but Keaton wouldn't have it
It was too far-fetched for him
Keaton was a grounded guy
An ex-cop
To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated
It's always simple
There's 06/07/94 87
(cont'd) no mystery on the street, no arch- criminal behind it all
If you got a dead guy and you think his brother did it, you're going to find out you're right
Nobody argued with Keaton
They just set their minds on whacking Kobayashi

The body of the Caddy is riddled with bullet holes
Redfoot's dead body has been shoved head-first through a hole in the windshield up to his waist, recognizable only by the trademark red boot
80 80
- Kobayashi walks through the front door of a plush office tower followed by two bodyguards
He heads toward the elevator, failing to notice Hockney a few feet away, reading a newspaper
We see a wire running from Hockney's ear to his collar
He's coming up
81 81
- Keaton, McManus and Verbal stand by the six elevators on the fortieth floor
They are all wearing khaki overalls and tool belts with walkie-talkies
They look like servicemen
All of the elevators have been propped open and stranded
McManus moves into one of the elevators
As the doors close         i behind him, he scrambles for the ceiling hatch

Kobayashi and his bodyguards get on the elevator

Two shots from a suppressed pistol and the guards drop to the floor,
Kobayashi looks up with surprising calm into McManus' barrel
McManus Press forty
91 91
- The elevator opens and Kobayashi is greeted by Keaton and Verbal
McManus drops from the ceiling hatch and pushes him out
06/01/94 90
Verbal and McManus grab the dead bodies and drag them out of the elevator
They drag them to the next elevator which has been forced open, revealing an empty shaft
The answer is no
Mr
Soze will be most - Listen to me, cocksucker
There is no Keyser Sate
If you say his name again, '11 kill you right here
strange threat
can only assume you're here to kill me anyway
Pity about Mr
Redfoot
McMANUS Fair trade for Fenster
The elevator opens and Hockney steps out
Ahh, Mr
Hockney
Do join us
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you
'm offering you the chance to call this off
Mr
So- My employer has made up his mind
He does not change it
Neither do we
McMANUS You got Fenster, you may get more, but you won't get us all
Not before one of us gets to you
believe you, Mr
McManus
quite sincerely do
You would not have been chosen if you were not so capable, but cannot make this decision
Whatever you can threaten me with is
ludicrous in comparison to what will be done to me if 06/01/94 91
McMANUS Just so you know
'm the guy
'm the one that's gonna get through to you
am sorry, Mr
McManus
(To Keaton) f implore you to believe me, Mr
Keaton
Mr
Soze is very real and very                             + determined
We'll see
McManus holds a pistol to Kobayashi's chin
The lawyer's cool eyes never falter'
Before you do me in, you will let me finish my business with Ms
Finneran first, won't you
, Keaton grabs McManus' hand and pulls the gun away before he can shoot
What did you say
Edie Finneran
She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition requested she be put on the case personally
She flew out yesterday
Everyone looks at Keaton
(') No matter
Kill away, Mr
McManus
You're lying
Am
92 92
- Everyone follows Kobayashi quietly down a dimly lit, oak- lined hallway
Verbal holds a small pistol discreetly in the small of Kobayashi's back
5/25/94 92
They come to a glass office foyer
Kobayashi gestures and everyone looks through the glass into the lobby beyond
is talking casually with the receptionist
93
93 Edie glances toward the men in the hall
Keaton turns quickly on his heels, facing the others
From where Edie stands, it looks as though Kobayashi is talking to a group of harmless maintenance men
They see    dressed very much like the two dead bodies left in the hall downstairs
The man notices Kobayashi and the others
He stands and stares menacingly
Ms
Finneran's escort in Los Angeles
Never leaves her for a moment
thought you'd like to know she was in good hands
Keaton's mind races for an alternative
He can find none
Verbal lowers his gun without being told
(') Get your rest, Gentlemen
The boat will be ready for you on Friday
If  see you or your friends before then, or fail to check in every half hour with that unpleasant looking man in there, Ms
Finneran will find herself the victim of a gruesome violation before she dies
As will your father, Mr
Hockney
and your Uncle Randall in Arizona, Mr
Kint might only castrate Mr
McManus' nephew, David
Do  make myself clear
All of the men surround Kobayashi, aching to kill him
'11 take care of the dead men downstairs
We'll add them to the cost of Mr
Fenster
Now if you'll excuse me
Kobayashi walks into the office
Edie turns to greet him
Keaton slowly turns and watches as they shake hands and talk
Kobayashi says something they cannot hear and Edie laughs, her back to the window
5/25/94 93
Kobayashi smiles over her shoulder at Keaton
All the while, the bodyguard watches Keaton
He nods politely before Keaton and the others leave
Verbal watches for a moment more and follows

Another file from Kobayashi's briefcase is laid out on the dashboard
This has a map and a good fifty pages of information in it
It's a logistical nightmare
Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty
Can we stealth these guys
Doubtful
With all that coke, they'll be ready - which brings me to sunny spot number two
Even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat, we get nothing
McMANUS And if we wait for the money
Ten more men at least
In my opinion, it can't be done
Anyone who walks into this won't come out alive
McMANUS 'm for waiting for the money
Me too
Did you hear what he just said
If 'm going in,  want a stake
06/11/94 94
McMANUS So do
Verbal is shocked by what he is hearing
He looks at Keaton as if to ask him for his decision
Keaton's cold stare is all the answer Verbal needs
He slumps in his seat, resigned to the others
just can't believe we're just gonna walk into certain death
They all suddenly realize the weight of their situation
: McMANUS News said it's raining in New York
No one knows quite how to respond

black van pulls up and parks near the crane
Four men in suits get out
One remains with the van and the other three walk toward the boat
On the boat, five men come up from below deck
They are tense and cautious around the men in suits
Someone speaks in Spanish and someone else in Russian
It takes a moment before anyone speaks the same tongue
They settle on French for both negotiators
Hockney sits in the van
He handles a large shoulder bag            + stuffed with plastique
He tests a timer on top

(To Verbal) want you to stay here
Understand
+ But 'm supposed to - If we don't make it out,  want you to take the money and go
(Confused) Keaton,  can't just - want you to find Edie
Both of you find some place safe
Tell her what happened - Everything
She knows people
She'll know what to do
If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way
What if Just do what  tell you
Keaton turns and takes a few steps
He stops and looks back, his face marked with guilt and agony
(') Tell her
Tell her  tried
Keaton leaves before Verbal can respond
He walks down a ramp toward the boat
He is no more than a few yards out of the shadows before the first man sees him
102
102' One of the men in suits starts to yell to the others
Men pull out guns and try to look as cool as they can
Keaton walks right into the face of all of these men, undaunted
His hands are in his pockets
Above him, in the darkness, McManus pokes his head out and 06/11/94 97
spies Keaton
He pulls his head back and sticks out the barrel of the rifle
Keaton comes to a stop about twenty feet from fifteen men all together

McManus stares through the scope of his rifle at the scene
The cross-hairs breeze past Keaton and find a target
man in a suit
McMANUS Pow
He moves to another and then another, picking up speed and mock-shooting the men
He is steady and quick
It is clear he could take all fifteen in a few seconds
McMANUS (') Pow-pow-pow-pow-pow-pow
Oswald was a fag

few men standing on the dock near the stern of the large boat, move towards the commotion
Hockney bails out and runs quickly and quietly through the shadows, bringing the bomb with him

And on this farm he shot some guys
Ba-da-bip, ba-da-bing, bang-boom

The rest train guns on him
They reach for his arms, pointing their guns right at him
At the far end of the dock, Hockney throws his bomb onto the stern of the large boat
The men surrounding Keaton, are distracted
Keaton pulls a pistol out of each pocket and shoots the two men closest to him

He arrives at a thick mooring cable and climbs across to the boat
i : Keaton climbs up onto a small lifeboat hanging from the side of the larger boat
From this he climbs aboard the large boat
06/11/94 99
113
113f Hockney is firing in all directions
, he realizes no one is left on the dock
, he turns and runs back for the van parked on the pier above
He finds a ramp leading from the dock to the pier
At the van, he finds the one man who has stayed behind to protect it
i The man hears Hockney coming and raises his gun
Hockney runs       i straight at him, screaming frantically
i (In Spanish) <<' , '

He gets to the back door of the van and yanks it open
The inside is stacked with large wooden crates
114
114 Hockney, suddenly oblivious to the sound of gunfire, opens one of the crates and looks inside
Cash and negotiable bonds of all kinds
He smiles
sprays all over the money
Hockney looks at it, puzzled
Hockney raises a blood-soaked hand from his belly
He turns and stares in horror
06/11/94 99A
- Another shot takes off the top of his head
115
115 McManus runs like a wild man across the deck, heading for the hatch
He shoots in all directions as though he has eyes in the back of his head
He sees Keaton climbing onto the deck of the boat
06/11/34 100

116 Verbal is wrestling with what to do
He finally makes a break for the other side of the boathouse
117
117' The crane continues to swing
single bullet hits one of the barrels on the suspended pellet
Gasoline pours out through the bullet-hole

120' Verbal arrives at the top of the ramp leading from the dock to the pier
+ He ducks down behind a guardrail beside the ramp
He turns and sees Hockney's dead body next to the van
He looks around frantically, frozen in terror
It is quiet, except for the sounds of screaming, far off in the bowels of the boat and the hum of the crane

thought about Fenster and how he looked when we buried him, then thought about Keaton
It looked like he might pull it off
Rabin steps in and motions for Kujan to come outside
122' 122 Rabin and Jack Baer are in the hall
Rabin hands Kujan a thick manila folder
Kujan thumbs through it
boy came across a body on the beach this morning
Thrown clear when the boat burned
Shot once in the head
Two guys from the
just identified him
+ And
His name was Arturo Marquez
petty smuggler out of Argentina
He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking
He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach
They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again
Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings
Kobayashi
Bear nods
called New York County and they fared me a copy of Marquez's testimony
He was a rat
Kujan pulls out page after page from the file
big fucking rat
06/07/94 102
+ Arturo was strongly opposed 'to going back to prison
So much so that he informed on close to fifty guys
Guess who he names for a finale
Kujan finds one sheet and notices a paragraph is highlighted
Keyser Soze There's more
123
'  -                                 123 Kujan walks in and sits down in front of Verbal
He smiles
'11 tell you what  know
Stop me when it sounds familiar
Verbal is confused
There was no dope on that boat

-  -                                  124 Keaton is weaving through tight, low-ceiling corridors, looking in every cabin, working his way towards the bottom of the boat
, McManus is tearing though the corridors, seemingly less interested in securing the cargo as he is in killing everyone on board
He screams like a lunatic, shooting everything in his path, killing some men with his bare hands, shooting others, stabbing others still with a knife he has brought along
125 125 , one of the men from the boat, is half-pushing, half- helping a thin and sweaty looking towards a cabin at the end of the hall
The man in the robe is trembling
He seems stricken with fear
06/01/94 103
He's here
saw him on deck
Jaime pushes him inside the cabin and shuts the door
stereo playing softly in the room mixes with the man's panicked breathing
The man in the robe screams through the closed door, his voice echoing off of the metal bulkheads
(') '   '
Jaime stands outside the door of the cabin and turns to face down the hall
Off in some other part of the boat, he can hear McManus wailing like a banshee and the ever-less frequent sound of gunshots
126
126 Keaton has come to the four-foot-high door to the hold
The door is open slightly
Keaton finds this strange
He pushes the door open and steps inside
The hold is empty
He hears a noise behind him
He wheels around to fire
He sees McManus in the door
His face is covered with blood
McMANUS Did you hear what  heard
What happened to you
McMANUS Keyser Soze is on the boat
What
McMANUS heard somebody screaming his nuts off
He said Keyser Soze was on the boat
Are you alright
McManus rubs some of the blood off with his sleeve
5/25/94 104
McMANUS Huh
Oh, It's not mine
There's no coke
McManus looks around the hold as though he'll see four and a half tons of dope in some corner where Keaton might have missed it
The two men look at one another
There is a long, pregnant silence
McMANUS Let's get the fuck out of here
Right behind you
127
127 Keaton and McManus step out of the hold, walking slowly and cautiously back from where they came
They hear the sounds of footsteps running on the deck above and the occasional hollered sentence in Spanish
Where's Hockney
McMANUS don't think he made it to the boat
They come to a corner
They can go left or right
can't remember which way
McMANUS Right - - Gunshots fill the hallway from behind them
They do not stop to turn around
Keaton goes left, McManus goes right
They run in opposite directions with the sound of gunfire right behind them
128
-                                                 128 Jaime squints and cocks his head
06/11/94 105
He raises a pistol and crouches by the door
129
129 The man in the bathrobe sits on the foot of the bed watching the door
He hears the sounds of fighting somewhere not too far away
He crawls over the bed and squeezes between it and the bulkhead
Only the top of his head is visible
He starts to cry
-  - Two shots just outside in the hall
, the door bursts open
Jaime collapses in a heap on the floor, a bullet hole in his eye
The man in the bathrobe looks up at the figure
We cannot see him
told them nothing
The man in the robe falls dead
130
-                                            130 The boat is quiet now
Keaton walks out onto the deck
He looks out over the pier and sees Verbal standing in the middle of the carnage, frozen
Their eyes meet
Keaton waves at him as if to shoe him away
131
-                                               131 Verbal hesitates and finally moves towards the van with the money
He looks back over his shoulder and sees Keaton
Keaton sees him looking and waves again, hurrying him along
Verbal turns away and focuses on the van
132 132 Keaton hears a noise behind him
He swings around and points his gun at McManus again
He puts the gun down
06/11/94 106
McManus smiles
He walks slowly across the deck towards Keaton
Something is not right about him
McMANUS Strangest thing
He slumps to the deck
Keaton rushes over to him
He kneels down and sees a pipe sticking out of the back of McManus's neck
133
133' Verbal approaches the van, stepping over Hockney's body
He closes the back doors of the van
, He looks to his left at the huge loading crane
He glances upward along the giant' arm as it swings steadily on
Somewhere, off in the distance, the sound of  can be heard
134
134 Keaton kneels by McManus, trembling with rage
After a moment he stands, looking down at McManus' dead body
135
135 , Verbal realizes something
He turns and goes to call out a warning to Keaton
He is too late
136
136 Keaton never sees the crane coming
The pellet of barrels hits him square in the back and sends him flying into the wheel house of the boat
Keaton is still for a moment
Finally, he tries to get up, but finds he cannot move his legs
137
137 Verbal runs down the ramp as fast as he can
He comes to a rope ladder hanging down the side of the boat
+ , he stops dead in his tracks, looking up at the boat
06/11/94 106A
>From where he stands, he can just make out the figure of a ,   walking along the edge of the deck
He moves quietly and calmly in the shadows towards the crane, looking out of place in his expensive suit
06/11/94 107
Something about this man terrifies him
138                                                        '  138' 139
'  -  -
139 And that's when you say in your statement that you saw
Kujan picks up his copy of Verbal's statement to the
(') man in a suit with a slim build
Tall
Wait a minute
(Looking at watch) don't have a minute
Are you saying it was Keyser Soze
You told the
you didn't know who it was
Verbal is drowning in Kujan's interrogation
He looks dazed
- there had to be dope there
06/01/94 108
Don't shine me, Verbal
No more stalling
You know what 'm getting at
don't
'
' For the first time, Verbal stands and tries to move away from Kujan, but Kujan stays in his face, backing him into a corner
Verbal shields himself with his hands and shuts his eyes
(') don't know what you're talking about
' Verbal looks into Kujan's eyes with genuine terror
Kujan's face is red, his body trembles
His locomotive breathing is the only sound in the room
don't understand what you're saying saw Keaton get shot,  swear to you
Then why didn't you help him
,
Somehow,  was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him
But Keaton
It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan
mean the Devil himself
How do you shoot the Devil in the back
06/11/94 109
Verbal holds up a shaking, twisted hand
(') What if you miss
140
-  -                                  140' Verbal is hiding in the tangle of girders and cables on the barge
'
Keaton's body is completely obscured
The man in a suit strides across the deck over to Keaton, stopping to relieve himself on a small fire on the deck
He walks up and stands over Keaton
The two men exchange words and the man in the suit pulls out a pistol
He points it at Keaton
Verbal turns
He can just make out police cars coming in the distance
Verbal hears a shot from the deck of the boat
He turns in time to see the man in the suit running across the deck toward the gangway
Verbal can barely see the man from where he is now
The man in the suit is covered by shadows and the poor angle from the barge
Verbal strains to see but he cannot
The man in the suit stops long enough to pull out a lighter
He turns and walks back across the deck and out of sight
moment later flames leap up from on the deck
The mesh of steel and rubber leaves a dark and open cocoon at its base
Sirens are close now
Almost here
The sound of fire raging out of control
06/11/94 109A

Voices yelling
New light flickering in the surrounding darkness

'  -  -                                141 Arturo Marquez
Ever hear of him
Wha- No
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department
He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder
never heard of him
His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians
Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey
The money wasn't there for dope
The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them
said  never heard of him
But Keaton had
Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor
She knew who he was and what he knew
don't There were no drugs on that boat
It was a hit
suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it
Men he knew he could march into certain death
But how - wait
You're saying  sent                  t us to kill someone
06/01/94 111
'm saying Keaton did
Verbal cannot grasp this
He squints, trying to understand
(') Verbal, he left you behind for a reason
If you all knew Soze could find you anywhere, why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat
He wanted me to live
Why did he want you to live
one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple
No, sir
Why' Edie
don't buy that reform story for a minute
And even if  did,  certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her
So why
Because he was my friend
No, Verbal
You weren't friends
Keaton didn't have friends
He saved you because he wanted it that way
It was his will
Verbal grinds to a mental halt, trying to grasp the implication
: No
Keaton was Keyser Soze 5/25/94 112
The kind of guy who could wrangle the wills of men like Hockney and McManus
The kind of man who could engineer a police line-up from all his years of contacts in
Verbal stands on wobbly legs, shaking with anger
, , , ,
strange look crosses Verbal's face
Shock perhaps, or revelation
(') They found her yesterday in a hotel in Pennsylvania
Shot twice in the head
It starts to sink in with Verbal
His eyes swell
Edie
He used all of you to get him on that boat
He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man
The one man that could identify him
This is all bullshit
He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead
You saw him die, right
Or did you
You had to hide when the first police cars showed up
You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die
knew him
He would never - He programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to
Customs has been 5/25/94 113
(cont'd) investigating him for years
He knew we were close
You said it yourself
Where is the political pressure coming from
Why are you being protected
It's Keaton making sure you tell us what you're supposed to
Immunity is your reward
McMANUS
'm a cripple
'm stupid
Why me
Verbal hears the weight of his words and falls back in his chair, Kujan looks at him with some pity,; but he is too far in to stop
Because you're a cripple, Verbal
Because you're stupid
Because you were weaker than them
Because you couldn't see far enough into him to know the truth
Verbal is crying now
He shakes his head, eyes closed
(') If he's dead, Verbal - if what you say is true, then it won't matter
It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York, wasn't it
Tell me the truth
(Sobbing) It was all Keaton
We followed him from the beginning
Kujan smiles with triumphant satisfaction
(') didn't know
saw him die
believe he's dead
Christ Why lie about everything else, then
You know what it's like, Agent Kujan, to know you'll never be good
Not good like you
You got good all fucked around mean a stand up guy
grew up knowing was never going to be good at anything 'cause  was a cripple
Shit,  wasn't 06/01/94 114
(cont'd) even a good thief
But  thought the one thing  could be good at was a keeping my mouth shut - keeping the code
didn't want to tell you for my dignity, that's all, and you robbed me, Agent Kujan
You robbed me
Kujan pulls the microphone out from under his tie and puts it + on the desk
Verbal actually manages to snort a laugh, but only briefly, overcome by an apparent wave of nausea
You're not safe on your own
You think he's
Is he Keyser Soze  don't know, Verbal
It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield
Like you said, a spook story, but know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you
Stay here and let us protect you
'm not bait
No way
post today
You posted twenty minutes ago
Captain Leo wants you out of here a

p
, unless you turn state's
'11 take my chances, thank you
It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop
Where are you going to go, Verbal
You gonna run
Turn states evidence
You might never see trial
If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there
Maybe so, but 'm no rat, Agent Kujan
You tricked me, that's all
won't keep my mouth shut 'cause 'm scared
'11 keep it shut 'cause  let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too
And if they kill me, it's 06/11/94 115
(cont'd) because They'll hear  dropped dime
They'll probably hear it from you
Verbal stands, mustering his shattered dignity and walks towards the door
Rabin opens it for him from outside
For once Kujan cannot bring himself to look at Verbal
Verbal turns to the door, stopping to look Rabin in the eye
(') Fuckin' cops
He steps out of the room and into the hall
Rabin follows him
142
-                                                 142 Daniel Metzheiser comes out of Arkosh Kovash's room with a single sheet of 15x20 inch paper in his hand
He inspects the sketch with great interest
He folds the edges of the paper back to make it smaller
143
143 Metzheiser walks behind the reception desk without asking the nurse for permission and helps himself to the fax machine
144
-                                                  144 Verbal is downstairs in the depot of the police station picking up his personal belongings
, -  is checking off the items as he takes them out of the tray in which they are kept
One watch: gold
One cigarette lighter: gold
One wallet: brown
One pack of cigarettes
Verbal collects his personal items and shuffles on his lame leg toward the exit
145
'                                             145 Jack Baer stands by a fax machine
green light comes on next to a digital display
The display reads: 06/01/94 116

'                                                  146 Kujan stares solemnly at the bulletin board, drinking from Rabin's coffee cup
Rabin sits at the desk, sifting through the mound of gapers as though considering organizing them once and for all
You still don't know shit
know what  wanted to know about Keaton
Which is shit
No matter
He'll have to know how close we came
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again
'11 find him
Waste of time
(To himself) rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die
What
Nothing
Something  - forget it
Kujan shakes his head
He gestures to the desk
(') Man, you're a fucking slob
Rabin regards the mess of his office
Yeah
It's got it's own system though
It all makes sense when you look at it right
You just have to step back from 06/01/94 117
(cont'd) it, you know
You should see my garage, now that's a horror show
Kujan is not listening
He has been staring at the bulletin board, lost in thought, his unfocused eyes drifting across the mess of papers, not looking at anything at all
147
147 Verbal steps out into the sunlight, putting on a pair of cheap sunglasses
He looks up and down the crowded street
People on their way to and from lunch, no doubt
Cars choke the street in front of the police department as they wait for pedestrians to clear the way
148
'                                     - 148 single sheet of paper comes out of the fax machine, face down
149
'                                                  149 Kujan still stares at the bulletin board
, Kujan's face changes
He leans in closer to the bulletin board and squints his eyes
His face changes again
First a look of puzzlement, then confusion - finally realization
The coffee cup tumbles from his hand
It hits the floor with the  of cheap porcelain
Coffee splatters everywhere
Rabin snaps out of his droning and looks up in surprise
'
Kujan is staring not at what is on the bulletin board, but at the bulletin board itself
His eyes follow the aluminum frame, mounted firmly to the wall
One might note it's sturdy construction and it's convenient size
Big enough to hold a lifetime of forgotten and disregarded notes and facts
Years of police trivia that has been hung and forgotten with the intention of finding a use for it all someday
One might want such a bulletin board for one's self
One would look to see who makes such a bulletin board
Kujan's eyes are locked on a metal plate bearing the manufacturer's name
06/11/94 118
It reads:  - , Kujan's eyes flash all' over the bulletin board
He finds a picture of Rabin in the far corner
He stands beside a scale in fishing gear
He proudly holds a hand out to his freshly caught marlin
His eyes skim quickly over and stop on an eight and a half by eleven inch fax sheet of what must be a Kujan glazes over his name, it is irrelevant
His aliases stand out
Slavin, , Shank, , Thee, Rooster
'   with sudden realization
He runs for the door
His foot crushes the broken pieces of Rabin's coffee cup
The cup that hovered over Verbal's head for two hours
Kujan is in too much of a hurry to notice the two words printed on the jagged piece that had been the bottom of the cheap mug
150
150 Kujan is sprinting wildly down the hall for the stairs
151
151 Verbal looks behind him and sees   standing just inside the doorway, lighting a cigarette
The cop notices Verbal and watches him in the way that cops look at people they cannot place in the category of idiot citizen, or stupid criminal
Verbal smiles politely, meekly at the cop and walks down the steps into the moving throng
152
152 Kujan runs up to the desk where Verbal had only moments before picked up his belongings
Rabin is right behind him, a look of absolute confusion on his face
t The Cripple
He went that way
06/11/94 118A
The cog gestures towards the door
Kujan runs outside looking around frantically
153                                                         153' 06/11/94 119
154
154 Verbal limps his way carefully across the sidewalk, avoiding people as best as he can
He looks over his shoulder, getting farther away from the police station
He can see Rabin and the cop on the steps, looking around with strange, lost expressions on their faces
He does not notice the car creeping along the curb beside him
155
155 '
The driver's hands tap the wheel patiently
His eyes follow Verbal as he fumbles through the crowd
156
156 Kujan pushes and shoves, looking this way and that
157
157 on the feet of dozens of people
Verbal's feet emerge from the crowd on the far side
They hobble along the curb
, the right foot seems to relax a little, the inward angle straightens itself out in a few paces and the limp ceases as though the leg has grown another inch
' Verbal's hands are rummaging around in his pockets
The good left hand comes up with a pack of cigarettes, the bad right hand comes up with a lighter
The right hand flexes with all 06/01/94 120
- of the grace and coordination of a sculptor's, flicking the clasp on the antique lighter with the thumb, striking the flint with the index finger
It is a fluid motion, somewhat showy
Verbal lights a cigarette and smiles to himself
He turns and sees the car running alongside
158
'                                            158 Jack Beer pulls the sheet out of the fax machine and turns it over, revealing the composite sketch of Keyser
Though crude and distorted, one cannot help but notice how much it leaks like
159
159 The car stops
The driver gets out
, or the man we have come to know as such
He smiles to Verbal
Verbal steps off of the curb, returning the smile as he opens the passenger door and gets in
The man called Kobayashi gets in the driver's seat and pulls away
moment later, Agent David Kujan of
Customs wanders into the frame, looking around much in the way a child would when lost at the circus
He takes no notice of the car pulling out into traffic, blending in with the rest of the cars filled with people on their way back to work
