-  1 From a distance and through the trees we see a raging hell fire engulfing a small two story house
It burns and burns
Out of nowhere a man bursts through a second story window, lands hard and rolls to smother his burning clothes
He crawls away and staggers up and for a moment looks as if he might run back into the flames
But the heat is unbearable
He runs toward us then past us through black shadows
We cannot see his face, 1A
-   ( 1930S) 1A Glass in a weathered window glitters with early morning sun
rock shatters one of the remaining glass panes
2
-  / 2 The rock thrower,  ( 10) is hightailing it away from an isolated Appalachian  as the door bangs open, a shotgun barrel appears, and a chicken comes  out from under the porch
Thinking he's sure to be shot, Tom runs into the old barn
3
'  -  / 3 Panting in terror, Tom is hunkered down in strips of light, trying to see through the cracks
There is a loud  and the huge face of some kind of beast suddenly appears at his shoulder
Tom jumps, panicked, just as a   creeps into the barn and levels a glinting shotgun at him
Tom freezes, bends over, and throws up
When Tom looks up, a ray of light reveals the half face of a fierce gray bearded man,
He is holding out a handkerchief to the boy
Shaking hard, Tom hesitates then takes it and wipes his mouth
Bush pushes open the door and gives Tom a sad look that the boy will never forget before waving him away
2
4
'  -  4 Looking back over his shoulder, Tom runs for the road
Two of his  are already kicking up dust
(72) steps into the sun and watches the boy run off with a look of muted anger, sadness, and something much deeper
5
'  -  5 Bush enters the barn to check on his companion
is older than Bush in mule years and just as gray
He wears an old mule blanket everywhere to keep out the cold
He fidgets nervously from all the excitement
Bush comforts him
Just a boy, that's all
6 : 6 7 Bush rips down an old faded sign at the road and posts a 7 fresh one:'No Damn Trespassing/Beware of Mule'
Bush checks the road in both directions
All clear for now
8 Bush splits firewood with powerful cleaving strokes
Mule 8 dozes in the shade
Bush sees a Model- approach and turn into his road, right past his new sign
He glances at his shotgun leaning against the shack
The Model- comes to a shaky stop
climbs out, sees Bush swinging the axe and approaches with trepidation
Mornin', sir
Hard life if you can't read
Pardon
'm uh, Reverend Gus Horton, sir, how you doing
Bush stops his swing and turns and stares coldly at Horton
Don't need saving, preacher
3
Uh, well, Mr
Wiley Starke has passed on, sir
His funeral is tomorrow and  thought you might want to know since
() What got him
Just got old, sir
Yeah, well
Bush returns to chopping wood
Feeling awkward, Horton hesitates, starts for his car, stops
Mr
Starke told me that you and him ran away from home when you were 6 years old
Is that true
talked him into it
Bush doesn't turn, just keeps chopping
Well
anyway
alright
Horton shrugs, get in his car, and leaves
Bush strikes the log hard and a cleaved piece goes flying
9
-  9 The loneliness of the empty cemetery is broken by Wiley Starke's fresh grave
The mounded earth is covered with beautiful flowers and wreathes, a loving send off from his family and friends
As we pan past the flowers and cards
we realize that the cemetery is not quite empty
Hunkered down nearby, Bush is as still as a gravestone, staring at the last resting place of his old friend
As Bush gets up to leave he stops abruptly and stands frozen, staring at a pot of   on a distant grave
Now he turns and walks quickly away in the opposite direction
4
10
'  -  10 Rain drums hard on the tin roof as Bush, soaked to the bone and shaking with chills, rummages through an old hat box by lamp light: Letters, news clippings and keepsakes
He finds what he's looking for:   of a
She smiles at us from happier days
Realizing that he is raging with a serious fever, he tries to stand up only to collapse back on the bed
11  11/12/13 11 14
'  -  14 Wrapped in his quilt and carrying the oil lamp, Bush moves slowly toward the barn
But he is so wracked with fever he has to stop
It stuns him that he can't go on
He never thought anything could stop him
Stuck in the rain with the shaking lamp sizzling, he stares into the forever darkness, the muscles in his jaw rippling in the pale light
Well hell
15
'  -  15 Somehow he has made it
Sopping wet and shivering, Bush is in bad shape and knows it
Mule sees Bush and grunts anxiously as he rises
Bush blindly pours Mule some feed and the poor old thing snatches his first meal in days
Bush tries to think through the fever
He stumbles back to the door and swings it wide open so Mule can get out if Bush doesn't make it
Satisfied, he comes back and drops hard onto a pile of hay near Mule
Always thought you'd go first
White as cotton, Bush stares into the lamp that is running out of oil, the light fading fast to darkness
Thoughts tumble through his mind, troubling him, stirring the dark waters of memory
5
16
'  -  16 across the stillness of the foothills to the barn
The door is still swung wide open
Back from the brink of death, Bush emerges into the blinding sunlight
Mule is dozing in his favorite spot
He swings his big gray head over at Bush
Ahh, don't look so disappointed
17  17 18
'  -  18 Mule watches Bush heave a creaky old wagon out from behind the barn
Mule climbs up on all fours
Bush gets a set of reins and walks toward him
Mule starts to take a stroll, knowing what the reins mean
You better not
Mule looks back, sees an apple in Bush's hand, and stops
And coffee when we get there
19
-  19 Old wheels creak and moan
Bush and Mule ease up Main street with the cart
try to catch a glimpse of the infamous recluse
Mule comes to a wearied stop, breathing hard
Bush climbs off the cart and walks Mule, ignoring the eyes upon him
20
-  20 Reverend Horton, stoking the wood stove, hears
Buddy
6
But as he turns he sees Bush silently looking around
Oh
Hello
Horton comes to Bush but Bush ignores him and keeps critically looking around
What can  do for you, sir
Suddenly  and   (20's) enter from the vestibule with their new
In their own world, and not realizing that there is anyone in the chapel, Kathryn picks some lint from Buddy's jacket
He catches her fingers and kisses them
Bush is transfixed by the loving moment
can wait
Buddy and Kathryn see Horton and double-take Bush
Buddy nods to Horton and he and Kathryn step back into the vestibule to give Bush and Horton privacy
It's alright, have a seat
Bush sits down uneasily in a pew
Horton sits down in the pew in front of him and twists around to face him
The wintry light from the near window washes over them
What's on your mind, sir
Bout time for me to get low
Get what
Down to business Bush reaches into his overalls and puts a balled-up wad of on the pew
Horton's eyes bulge
Need a funeral
Horton looks up from the money
7
For who
Me
Buddy peers around from the vestibule, listening, curious as hell, until Kathryn pulls him back
For you
(off Bush's impatient nod) You want to buy a funeral for you
Am  not talking right
No, yes, 'm sorry
Are you sick sir
Everybody dies
True, but
don't take care of my bones it won't get done, will it
All right,  see
Well the church can help you get your affairs in order, arrange a service
Horton glances at the strange wad of money again
What would you say
About what
Me
eulogy
don't know
What do you want me to say
8
Say what you'd say right now to my face
Well
uh,  don't know much about you, Mr
Bush
mean, 've heard stories but
What stories
Bush leans in and stares into Horton
It feels like everything in the world stops dead
Buddy peeks in again, this time Kathryn peeks too
Just stories
(off Bush's intense look) you know, people talking
What kind of stories
Say one
Sir
my mother used to say that gossip is the devil's radio
( ) not that she didn't play that radio at full volume now and then, bless her heart, but
(back to business) what matters when you come to the end of your life is that you're ready for the next one
Have you made peace with God, sir
paid
Horton has no idea what Bush means
He looks at the money, back at Bush
Well
you can't buy forgiveness, Mr
Bush
It's free
But you do have to ask for it
Nothing in this world is free, preacher
9
Bush abruptly grabs his money and starts out
His hand bangs into the pew and the money
Buddy stares wild-eyed at the big wad of money then drops back into the vestibule
Bush storms past Buddy, Kathryn and the baby like a hot wind
20A
-  20A Bush heads off down the road on his wagon
Horton, Buddy, and Kathryn appear at the door and watch him go
That was, uh, different
heard such awful things about him when  was a kid
My mother probably told you some of them
Kathryn goes back into the church with Horton who is cooing at the baby
Buddy lingers, staring at Bush, thinking
21
-  21 Bush's wagon loaded with bags of feed and supplies, sits in front of the Diner
Bush is holding a big tin cup of coffee for Mule who is drinking it and loving it
Tom (the kid who threw the rock) comes from behind the diner with a full garbage can to empty into the big trash barrels on the back of an old pick-up truck
He sees Bush and freezes
Bush looks up and stares at him
The diner door snaps open and  (30's), Tom's mother, steps out
She sees Tom and Bush staring at each other
What are you doing, son
Now Tom is scared to death that Bush is going to tell on him
Bonnie doesn't like this staring match at all
10
Empty those cans in your daddy's truck and get back in here
Now
Finally Bush drops his gaze and lets Tom off the hook
Relieved, Tom heaves the can up into the truck
Bonnie hesitates then goes back into the diner just as
(30s), his sidekick, , and two other  come across the street toward the diner
Gary sees Mule slurping coffee from the big tin cup
Look at that
mule drinking coffee
Finally found somebody that likes Bonnie's coffee
As they move past, they see Bush standing there
Ya'll better hush, that's old Bush
Carl eyes him
Gary and the others throw curious glances as they head into the diner
Carl stops
Hey
( ) 'm talking to you
Carl picks up a handful of gravel, tosses some over nonchalantly in Bush's direction
Bush ignores it
We know about you
You stay out of this diner
There's women and children here and we don't want you around them
Bush stands to mount up, never turning around
You better hear me
see you here again, 'll
Hey
Hey
Hearing the hollering, Tom looks up from the pick-up
Carl throws a stone, harder this time to get Bush's attention
11
But the rock misses Bush and hits Mule, startling him
Old instincts kick in and he has a
Shit
Carl moves up to try and calm him
as Bush tries to ease Mule down the cart hitch grinds a in Mule's hind-quarter
Mule whinnies painfully, slowly surrendering
As Carl steps up, Bush yanks the   off the cart and hits Carl in the chest
Air explodes from Carl as he gasps with pain
Before he can move, Bush hits him again in the same place
Carl wants to hit back but he has no air
Lightning quick, Bush steps back and hits Carl again in the exact same place
Carl falls like a bag of bones
He looks up and sees Bush towering over him with a terrible bottled up darkness in him
It has all happened so fast it feels like an awful dream to Carl
Daddy
Wild with fear, Bonnie and Tom run toward Bush
Stop it
Get away
Gary, the Worker burst from the diner but see the brake handle in Bush's hand and slow down
Bush comes to himself, sees everyone staring, sees Carl in tears, and now Tom and Bonnie, trying to get him away
Gary and the others slowly move toward Bush
More patrons step out from the diner
Buddy races up, sees Mule bleeding, and eyes Bush as he grabs the reins and leads Mule down Main street, still holding the brake handle
() 'll kill him
Bonnie shushes him softly as Carl moans in pain
Tom stares after Bush, mirroring his father's hatred

22  22 23
-  23 An  , awaits its passenger in a small but serviceable funeral hall
Through the office door, sits at his desk, his head completely buried behind a paper that he shakes hard every few seconds
His feet are up on the desk revealing a pair of lovely burgundy silk socks
24
/ -  24 Frank's hand slips the flask next to his coffee cup into a drawer when he  the front door open
But his face remains hidden as Buddy enters
Buddy is troubled by the fight
Frank
(off Frank's grunt) There was a fight
It was
let me guess
Hmm
Carl
Well yeah but this time it was with that old man Bush
Old man
( ) Is there a body
No, the old man did the beating
Never seen anything like it
Social event of the year and missed it
Frank lowers the paper so just his eyes appear
He has no southern accent and doesn't look small town
13
Read the paper today
(off Buddy's no) Something strange is happening in the world right now
What
People are dying in bunches
(off Buddy's look) Everywhere
But here
He puts the paper down and studies his socks
wonder what the odds are of a funeral home going broke
mean you have a business everybody on earth needs, you can't make that work, it's got to be you right
And yet
don't know
what do you do when people won't die
Well
Onethingabout Chicago, people knowhowto die; they drown, get runover,shot, whatever it takes
We get it done down here, we're just not in a hurry about it
It's them or us
Frank sighs and stares forlornly out at a casket
() might know someone who is looking for a funeral
Frank's eyes crawl over to him
25  25 14
30
/
/'  -  30 The Quinn Funeral Home Packard Hearse makes it way down the road
Frank drives as Buddy searches ahead
How much did he have
It was all wadded up
Ooo, hermit money
That's good
Buddy sees Bush's signs
There it is
31 /
' /  -  31 They stop at Bush's sign: 'No Damn Trespassing
" Frank squints up at the old shack and doesn't like what he sees at all
Buddy opens his door but Frank doesn't
What are you doing
You've been wanting a shot at sales
But
As of right now, you're on commission
(off Buddy's look) Remember; foot in the door, establish trust, and drop the hammer
Buddy hesitates, crawls out, and eyes the shack
'd feel better if you'd go too
15
No doubt but if you don't do this by yourself, you won't know if you're any good
And you'll never be any good if you don't know you are
Go get him
32
'  -  32 As Buddy uneasily approaches the shack, he feels the beautiful stillness and mystery of the place
He timidly on the door, pressing an ear to listen
Hello
Nothing
He shoots a look back to the hearse - miles away, and knocks a little louder
Nothing
He inches to the window and peeks in one of the remaining glass panes then starts to slide away
Buddy spins and discovers Bush standing on the ground behind him, his shotgun barrel pointed between Buddy's eyes
Want to see in my house, do you
Bush blows away several windowpanes and re-aims at Buddy's head
How's it look
Buddy closes his eyes, his last words are for his wife
Oh, Katie
It makes Bush peek out from behind the barrel
You was at the church with your wife and baby
Buddy opens his eyes and can't believe he is still alive
Yes, sir
16
What the hell you doing here
can't remember
What
They stand there while Buddy thinks
Oh yeah,  heard
you wanted a funeral
Funeral
Yes sir
work at uh
work at
(tries to think of it) Quinn Funeral Home
thought could help you
Bush glances at his blown out window: 'Damn'
He lowers his gun, walks up onto the porch
You like rabbit
What
Bush goes inside
Buddy looks desperately back at the hearse but can't see Frank
He doesn't know whether to run for it or not
33
'  -  33 The shack is spare as a monk's chamber but has wonderful in it
Sit down
There is only chair at the table so Buddy dumps the glass off a small stool under the window and sits down low
The wonder of not being dead makes him look at everything with new eyes
On a window sill he sees a beautiful little emerging from a block of wood
17
Bush is at the stove tending to a iron skillet of rabbit pieces covered with bacon and white gravy
It's how you put things together, see
Some things go, some things never will
Indians said that everything spoke to them
That's how they made medicine and knew what to eat
Things talked to them clear as we talk
You believe that
don't know, sir
If you don't listen you won't hear nothing
Bush puts the big skillet on the table and sits down
Buddy is so low he can look under the table and sees how the table legs run right into the top without screws or nails
Did you make this furniture, sir
Never seen any like it
Can't even tell what's holding it up
Magic
Buddy looks up
Bush is dead serious
The word lingers
Finally
Alright
Well
Sir, if you do want to plan for a funeral service, which  hope will be a long long time away, we'd treat you with respect and offer a good
What'd everybody say about what happened in town
don't
That crazy old son of a bitch tried to beat a man to death for no reason
That it
18
Buddy is caught off guard by Bush's lucid candor and finds himself automatically responding differently to him
There's two sides to every story
As Bush puts some rabbit on Buddy's old yellowed plate
People say that
But they don't mean it
They think what they think and they don't want to know anything else
Yes, sir, but  think people are so scared of what they don't know that they make things up to feel better about it
Like life after dying
Heaven
() hope that part's true, don't you
() But  don't think we know the actual truth about much of anything
know  don't
'm just guessing most of the time
Bush gives Buddy a closer look and motions for him to try the rabbit
Fearing the worst, Buddy bends into the steam, takes a cautious bites and mutters with shocked surprise
Lord, that's good
You boys been coming out here to throw rocks through my window for 20-30 years
never
Ya'll know lots of stories about me
19
() Yes, sir,  guess, but
Tell one
'd rather not
Bush eases forward, his eyes slit
The old Bush is back
rather you did
(startled/leans back) Well
When  was kid  heard you killed some men in a fist fight
Is that all
Bush leans back stone-faced
In the silence, Buddy looks over again at the wondrous carving of the mule on the window sill, at the big ears and long face that are being born from the rough block
It makes him smile
But when he glances back, Bush is staring a hole through him
What's your name again
Buddy Robinson, sir
Well, if  need you --  know where you are
It sounds almost like a threat
It shorts Buddy out
He stops eating and realizes that Bush has taken another turn and that he's been dismissed
34
'  -  34 Buddy heads to the hearse, glancing back over his shoulder
As he recalls his encounter, he stops, looking back at the shack
The old legend has gotten deep under his skin
20
35  35 35A
' / 35A The morning sun breaks over the mountains
36
'  -  36 Bush is on the porch, straining boiled herbs, grass, and bark into a jar
There is something not right with him and he knows it
While the medicine cools he looks out across the mountain and draws a deep breath
37
-  37 well crafted live-in home doubling as a funeral parlor sign, '  ', hangs from the porch
(
) Oh yes Ma'am,  do respect your wishes but you see
38
/'  -  38 Frank is looking a little hung over
Buddy walks in
Frank points at the phone and rolls his blood shot eyes
state law requires
No ma'am, we can't bury him under the house
There is a loud  at the door
Buddy goes to get it
39
/  -  39 Buddy swings the door open
Bush is standing there
Buddy leans back unconsciously, not knowing what to expect
(
) Well just for argument's sake, Ma'am, how would we get the casket under the house
No casket
( ) Would you like to come in, sir
21
Bush stares suspiciously into the room then back at Buddy
(
) But you have to have a container of some kind, Ma'am for decency and uh, sanitation
Bush enters the Funeral Home
As Buddy starts to close the door, Bush catches it
Leave it
40
-  40 Frank is still on the phone and pouring himself a drink from the flask into his coffee cup in the drawer
Yes, Ma'am, but there's lots of natural things that aren't decent
(listens, eyes widen) He did what
Good God
No, Ma'am, didn't know that about your husband
Well, yeah now understand why you want him under the house but still
The phone goes dead
sighs as Bush walks in
Frank Quinn, Mr
Bush
Frank takes a quick swallow from his cup to fortify himself, then jumps up, smiling, and goes to Bush with his hand out
Come in, come in, pleasure
Coffee
As Bush shakes Frank's hand, he stares into him, taking everything in, his bloodshot eyes, the wrinkled shirt beneath his suit, his breath
Frank feels downright naked
You from anywhere
little bit of everywhere, guess
Get him a chair, Buddy
Buddy stands behind the waiting chair
22
Bush scrapes up a different chair
Frank goes behind the desk
Buddy pulls up a chair
Bush reaches into his coat and pulls out the wad of hermit money and lays it on the desk
Frank does something phenomenal
He ignores the money
How can we help you, sir
Bush gives Buddy a look, then looks back at Frank who steadfastly refuses to look at the ball of money
'm after a funeral
Boy, are you in luck
( ) Follow me
41
-  41 Frank and Buddy stand with Bush in a room dedicated to sales
Three caskets are lined up for display
All tanks
Bush steps up to a cheap cloth covered box, bangs it with his knuckles, and scowls
Frank points to a wooden casket
Solid pecan, steel handles
Bush eyes it, repulsed
Mr
Bush is an amazing carpenter
Forget the box
What else
Whatever you want, flowers
No
Burial plot
Got it
23
service
Party
what
party
What kind of party
Funeral party
Stumped for once in his life, Frank looks at Buddy
Then years of honed instincts surge back to life
We can do that
42
/ -  42 As they come back into the office
And  want to be there
Frank goes behind his desk
Buddy and Bush start to sit
You will be,  guarantee it
want to be there now
You want to be at your funeral
party
alive
(off Bush's nod) But
it's not a funeral if you're not, you know, deceased
Hold on now, it's a detail, we can look at it
Pretty big detail
24
Frank cuts Buddy a look then smiles at Bush
So you'd like to have a funeral party while you're alive so you can go
Yes or no
Yes
Buddy is lost
Buddy, get some paper
We need to make of list of who Mr
Bush wants to invite
As Buddy starts to get up
Sit down
Buddy sits right down
want everybody to come who's got a story to tell about me
Say again
That probably covers 4 counties
Bush shoots him a look
Frank shoots him a look
Buddy thinks about how great an outdoor life would be
Then  want 4 counties worth of people at the party
Well, sir, the thing is, how would you get people to come and tell stories about you that 'm guessing might get them, you know
shot
Bush scoops up the ball of money and heads out
Now all Frank can see is the money, leaving
25
You know what, you go ahead, don't worry about it, we'll think of something
couple of ideas just came to me
Like what
43
-  43 As Bush starts out the open door, he nearly bumps into Buddy's wife, Kathryn, and
Mattie is carrying Kathryn and Buddy's baby boy
Frank sees Mattie and flicks his hair back nervously and quickly brushes his teeth with his finger as
Bush gives Mattie a glance and tries to be invisible
Felix
Feigning deafness, Bush walks on
Sensing something, Kathryn takes the baby so Mattie can go after him
Felix
Say hello to me
Frank, eyes wide with surprise, mouths, "Felix
"
Bush's shoulder hunch then fall as he turns
He looks into her, taking everything in
When he speaks his eyes and voice are soft
Hey Mattie
Buddy comes out, surprised to see Mattie and Bush together
Frank walks up behind him and scowls
Kathryn steers them back inside to give Mattie privacy
Heard you moved off
've been back a while
( ) Well
26
How are you
You look like you always did
He abruptly rips himself away and is gone
44
-  44 Buddy and Frank are peeking out the window
They see Mattie standing alone as Bush walks away
How would she know him
(
) It's none of our business
So
We got to know
Kathryn shakes her head and goes back outside
has another look at Mattie then lets the curtain fall back
See the size of that thing
What
What do you mean, what
Goddamn ball of money
He wants a party with pink balloons on his ears, we're gonna give it to him
But
sold 26 of the ugliest cars ever made one December, in Chicago, with wind blowing so hard up my ass was farting snow flakes in July so don't tell me we can't do this
But
27
That's the last "but"  want to hear out of you
You're a salesman now, sell
(looking out again) She called him Felix
45
-  45 Kathryn rocks the baby in a carriage
Mattie is beside her
thousand years ago he was the most interesting man 'd ever met
Get out of here
He was
And  don't mean just the way he looked
hope not
Oh no, listen, he was beautiful
Are you serious
(/) Most people are just laid out nice and simple, you know
You always know what they're thinking and where you are with them
But he was this
big old cave that went deeper and deeper
You'd never get to the end of him
Good Lord, you had a crush on him
All the girls did
know he's something wild that crawls out of the hills once in a while and gets into trouble now but there's still nobody like him
28
46
'  -  46 Bush comes out of the barn
Frank and Buddy are there
We have a plan
All we need is a little bit of your time
What for
Seeing it is better than hearing about it
Bush looks at the hearse, back at Buddy and Frank
How much is it gonna cost
( ) Did you say anything about money
(touches his own chest) didn't say anything about money
( ) If we can't get you what you want you don't owe us anything
47
-  47 Frank, Buddy, and Bush ride in the front seat of the hearse
They are together but in very different worlds
They don't even look at each other when they talk
Buddy is lost in serious thought
Frank is preoccupied about the deal and driving too fast
Bush is scrunched up to the door
He is going much faster than he is used to going
He kinda likes it and kinda doesn't
It moves, don't it
() This is nothing
29
Fancy car for the dead
Didn't buy it for them
(out of nowhere) We say that funerals are "For the Living" but we forget what that means sometimes,  guess
(to Bush but almost to ) was thinking about your funeral party before  went to sleep last night and  think  understand it a little now
When  was a kid, my folks where killed in a bad car wreck and the people at the funeral home
they did the impossible as far as  was concerned
don't know what  would've done without them
And  remember wishing that my mother and daddy were there to see how beautiful they made everything
Frank is hearing this for the first time and is shocked
Bush glances softly at Buddy then looks out the side window at the world rushing by too fast
All at once he gives in to it
48
-  48 The hearse pulls up on main street
Frank, Buddy, and Bush get out and head toward Feldman's Clothing Store
48A
'  -  48A Frank and Buddy enter the store and find
and a setting up a large camera and backdrop
As they turn to show Bush what is happening they see him go by the window outside
Where's he going
49  49 30
50
'   -  50 barber's drape falls over  who is seated in a chair
Frank and Buddy rush in
The barber, an anxious Mr
Tollerude, pumps Bush's chair upward
( ) wish you wouldn't do that yet
Bush gives him the hairy eyeball then speaks to Mr
Tollerude, a clear threat
Don't leave me naked
Mr
Bush, you can get all the hairs cut you want after we take your picture, 'll pay for it
Mr
Tollerude doesn't know whether to cut or not
Why you want my picture made
That's what we're trying to tell you
We're gonna run an ad in some papers about your party and put up posters of you
And you want me to look like this
Yes
Why
Why
It's how people recognize you, sir
And you want as many people to come as possible so
31
So a crazy old nutter draws more
Basically
Don't you think
Do you ever say what you mean
Bush rips the bib off as Tollerude whooshes him to the floor
51
'   51 Bush is seated in front of a backdrop painted with a bridge, a swan, and a pond
The Photographer is trying to tidy up Bush without offending him
As he walks back to camera, Bush roughs himself up and looks truly wild
Buddy snickers
When the Photographer gets back to the camera, he cocks his head, what
Take it
(leans in to Buddy) 'd go see that
52
'  -  52 Mr
Tollerude, nervous as hell, brings Bush up from his reclining position and turns the chair to the mirror
Bush studies his well trimmed hair and beard for a moment
It's impossible to tell what his thoughts are as he looks into his own eyes
Buddy and Frank are in the mirror too, staring at him
( ) Damn
You look pretty good
Bush suddenly gets up and nods at Frank
He's paying
As Bush blows out the door, Mr
Tollerude leans against the chair with relief
32
53
'   -  53 Bush stands in front of a full length mirror
He has on a decent black suit, pinned to be hemmed, and a plain white shirt, open at the collar
It is a startling change
But we still can't tell what he is thinking
Buddy is staring at him with honest disbelief
Frank is quietly trying to get Mr
Feldman to lower the price for the suit
He looks over and double-takes Bush
Son of a bitch, it's almost worth it
( ) What do you think
wouldn't know you, sir
Maybe the Devil won't either
Might work out
( ) Where's the shoes
Well, normally people don't wear shoes in a casket so
(off Bush's scowl) what are you, about a 10D
54
'   -   54 Buddy stands beside Frank who is still trying to get a deal on the clothes
Bush walks up with two pairs of pants and two new shirts, puts them on the counter, gives Frank a hard look, and walks away
Frank looks down at the clothes, over at Buddy
Pretty optimistic taking a change of clothes to the grave
(calls over his shoulder) How you set for underwear
(
) Don't wear none
33
One question too many
55  55 56
-  56 Everyone is back in the hearse
Something is eating at Frank
don't mean to be nosey but uh
how do you know Mattie
She's a peach
Frank and Buddy cut Bush a look
He looks ahead
We had a go
Frank nearly drives off the road
57
/ '  -  57 Late night Poker
Cigarette smoke drifts into the air
Frank, Carl, Rev
Horton, Mattie, and , a banker, are at the table
Ray has the untouchable presence of someone privileged which appears to be driving Frank up a tree tonight
Horton gathers up his winnings
"The Lord loves a cheerful giver
" Oh please
you think the Lord's taking sides in a poker game in a funeral home
Horton shrugs and points to the divine evidence
If He is, the Divine's cheating
Exactly
Don't agree with me Ray, it makes me doubt myself
34
Ray sighs and studies his perfectly cut nails
would have turned down your loan if you were my own dear mother, Frank
You made my point and don't even know it
Jesus, would you two stop it
You're worse than two old women
Ray shrugs, sweetly blase
Frank tries to rein in his temper for her
The loss of the hand is especially hard on Carl who has only a couple of dollars left
( ) What were you doing with that old bastard in town today, anyway
Oh yes
Buying him clothes, getting him a haircut
on credit
Frank shoots him a look
Took out ads in a bunch of papers too, something about a party
God,  love small towns
Who are you talking about
That hermit, what's his name
(a knowing look at Mattie) "Felix" Bush
You're giving him a party
funeral party
35
Whatever you're drinking is not being good to you at all
What the hell is a funeral party
Hey, the man wants to be at his own funeral
What can  say
'd like to be at my funeral so  could tell my ex-wife to kiss my
What makes you think she'd show up for you
Because, Dear, vultures are constitutionally unable to ignore the dead
Mattie grins which delights Frank, no end
Horton stops counting his money and stares at Frank
It's that big wad of money of his you're after
There is a crack in Ray's disinterest that he tries to hide
What money is that
Felix has money
Everyone is looking at Frank but he shuffles the cards
He came to see me, wanting a funeral, had a big old greasy ball of money
Talked like he thought he could buy his way to heaven with it
() How much has he got
Maybe he can
Hearing that Bush wants or needs a real funeral Mattie is suddenly truly concerned
36
Is he sick, Gus
Horton shrugs
Frank notes the concern and doesn't like it
Carl coughs and his ribs make him break out into a sweat
'll tell you one damn thing, ain't nobody gonna go to a funeral for that son of a bitch
Mattie gives Carl a look Language
They might
He's inviting everyone who has a story about him to come
You could tell about him kicking your ass, Carl
Carl looks at Frank as if he wants to cold cock him
Old man is going to ride the Weird Train right into the ground, isn't he
Wouldn't you like to know what everybody says about you behind your back, Ray
(off his look) Yeah, probably not
already know way more about people than  need to
Or want to
Amen
Let's play some cards
37
Oh for God's sake, face it Frank, you're broke
This is not about cards
It's a declaration meant to embarrass Frank in front of everyone
Frank feels their eyes on him as he starts to pull off his watch
Ray waves it off
Please
've won that 4 times already
It's who has it last that counts
Say what you want but if there hadn't been anybody there the other day he would've killed me
And guarantee you it wouldn't have been his first time
It sounds true and everyone is quiet except Mattie
Everybody knows you started it
(off his glare) Don't look at me like that remember when you were born
You were the sweetest little boy
What is wrong with you
Momentarily shamed, Carl's face softens and we can see a better man there
He struggles to hold on to it but
made a mistake
But there's a line
and he crossed it
and everybody knows that too
Ya'll go on and have a party with the devil for his money but 'll dance on his grave someday
Carl snatches his few dollars up and heads out
You kind of hate to admit it when it comes to Carl but he's got a point
You don't know what Bush is doing
What if he just wants to get everybody in one place so he can turn his shotgun on them
38
He wouldn't
looked in his eyes
The truth is nobody knows what he's capable of
Maybe even he doesn't know
She looks into him
Frank starts to deal the cards
Go ahead and lay your watch down, Frank
But  am going to keep it this time, alright, on principle
got an idea
Let's try something different
( ) The cards in your sock
Leave'em there
Everyone freezes
Ray shakes his head
What are you trying to pull now
You really think you're that good that nobody sees
Sees what
You cheat at everything you do
Even at the bank, you loan people just enough to get'em deeper in so you can foreclose on them
You are a pathetic man
And a goddamn
Am
Then stand up and roll down your socks
(a deep dark look) Stand up or 'll stand you up
Ray looks around the table and suddenly realizes that he is irreversibly exposed and alone
The sound of Frank's chair scraping the floor makes him jerk up
39 He walks out, trying to find his old confident rhythm and failing
Everyone sits in uneasy silence
58
-  58 Horton waves and walks out, leaving the door open
Frank walks Mattie to the door, helping with her coat, trying to work up his nerve to say
'll walk you home
No
Thank you
() You sure
(off her firm nod) You're not going to play anymore, are you
Oh,  don't know
Thank you for inviting me though
'm sorry about the
we don't always fight, okay, we do, but he's had that coming for
It's not that
just
(trails off) You came because you don't know what to do with yourself
(off her look) slept on the same side of the bed my whole life, right
But after my wife left me,  switched sides, just like that, and never been able to go back
When someone you love is gone, you can pour everything, even a lifetime of things into the place where they were but it's still always empty
40
He sees that her thoughts are not with him at all but a million miles away
She hardly glances up when she says
'Night
He stares after her, wishing that she could see him the way he sees her
59  59 60
'  -  60 Dim lamp light glows
We see Bush sitting on the edge of the bed wiping the sweat from his face with a sheet
He looks up at the picture of the beautiful woman
61
'  -  61 Buddy sits in the dark, rocking his son who is asleep small lamp casts a shadow across them
Kathryn comes in
didn't hear him wake up
He didn't
( ) Everything's all right, hon
'm glad you don't know how quick it can change
She gently kisses his arm and the baby's head
Buddy looks at her, haunted by the very possibility of their absence
62
-  62 Mattie is standing on the sidewalk at Feldman's store with her coat collar pulled up against the cold, giving someone we can't see a bemused affectionate scolding
Good Lord
Have you completely lost your mind
() 40A
(cont`d) Straighten up for heaven's sake before somebody throws a net over you
But she smiles in spite of herself, glances around to see if anyone was watching and moves discretely on
As she does we see that she was talking to a striking   of a wild man sitting in front of a pond, a swan, and a bridge
The text reads: 41
63
-  63 tiny , cramped with radio gear
Buddy and Frank peer through a glass window into a small control booth
(We will cut back and forth between the glass) Buddy is having misgivings about being here
But Frank gives the thumbs up to the young   in the booth, a hopeful kid with a smooth voice and dreams of the big-time
The Announcer hands Bush a set of headphones
Bush is wearing his new clothes and truly looks like a different man
Bush is puzzled by the headset
The kid takes it and clamps it onto Bush's head
He starts to yank them off then hears a song playing inside his head and loves it
But now the announcer cuts the record off and Bush scowls
Friends, we have a treat for you today on
Our special guest is going to tell us about an event that everyone is talking about
And here he is, Mr
Felix Bush, the mysterious hermit of Caleb County
How are you today, sir
am
Bush is surprised by the sound of his own voice
So tell us, sir, exactly how did you come up with the idea of having a funeral party before you die
dreamed it
42
Really
Why would  make that up
Two seconds of dead air as the announcer finds his feet
Okay
Now  have to say that you don't look quite like you do on the posters
got pruned
Well, you're a bit of a local legend, sir
was a little nervous about our interview
've heard some pretty wild stories
Like what
Well uh, just
from what understand, you want everyone who has a story about you to come and tell it
Is that right
You come and tell yours
Thank you
Now how long have you been living out there by yourself
64
- / 64 Mattie is cutting the stems of some lovely yellow flowers and arranging them in a vase
(
) 40 some years
(
) 40 years with nobody to talk to
(
) First 38 are the hardest
43
Mattie grins
65
-  65 But why would you do that, Mr
Bush, shut yourself off like that
Frank isn't happy with this but Buddy wants to hear
Come to the funeral and maybe you'll find out
You heard it here on , folks, find out the answer to the mystery February 16
One more thing, boy
and Buddy tense
What's this
66
-  6 6 Mattie tenses at the sound in Bush's voice
(
) Gonna be a drawing
(
) What kind of drawing, sir
You buy a ticket for $5
00 The day of the funeral we draw names
Then when  die, the winner gets my place, 300 acres of timber that hasn't been touched in 40 years
Mattie accidentally cuts a bloom off of a flower
67
-  67 Dead air
The kid, Frank, and Buddy are all staring at Bush
For 5 dollars
44
Send it to the Quinn Funeral Home
Frank's eyes light up like fiery pinwheels and he almost yelps
Buddy looks oddly perplexed and sad
You heard him
If you want a chance to win 300 acres of virgin timber worth thousands and thousands of dollars, send 5 dollars along with your name and address to
(off Frank waving and pointing to himself) Frank Quinn at Quinn Funeral Home
As the Announcer begins a song, Bush moves his head in time with the music
Frank and Buddy rush into the control booth
( ) could almost kiss you on the mouth
'll take a ticket
You're betting on a man dying
didn't mean it like
Hey, it's his idea
They look at Bush who has taken off the headset and looking at it like he wants to take it home
It's what you want, right
( ) Buy a ticket, son
68
-  6 8 Mattie puts the vase of flowers on table with a group of family photographs
The picture beside the vase is the of the beautiful woman that Bush has
Is it Mattie
It looks a little like her
45
: The    stares at us as we that we are now looking at the identical photo tacked to Bush's wall
69  69 70
'  -   70 Bush starts out of the barn, draws back, and peeks through the wall boards:   approaches
He jerks
Mattie walking Mattie
Felix
Mattie enters, straining to see into the barn
Her eyes adjust to find him standing near Mule
She is startled and pleased by his new do
Look at you
wondered if you were still under that beard
Wasn't nowhere else to go
heard you on the radio
Well
You've gotten downright chatty
reckon so
( ) This is nice
drove by a few times after  got back but
You want to see it
46
Do you want me to
71
'  -  71 The first stop on the tour is a small fenced grave site near the shack
Three grave markers with names carved into them: , ,
Bush is squatting down staring at the markers
Mattie stands close beside him
Since his attention is elsewhere she looks at him in an unguarded way
Her mind is full of questions, old and new
You always know where you stand with a dog
Want to lay here with them someday if they'll have me
72
'  - / 72 Mattie and Bush walks side by side through the last of the glimmering light and shadows beneath the trees
It is a chilly and Mattie's cheeks are flushed
She is enchanted by the place
Bush tries to hide how winded he is
It really is beautiful
Probably looked like this everywhere a hundred years ago
You leave things alone, they know what to do
Like you
No, Ma'am
don't know what to do about anything much
You've been alone a long time
Some people are more suited to it than others,  reckon
46A
That's funny cause  never thought that it'd suit you
knew you wouldn't be like anybody else but
no one to talk to, no one to
be with
never
He looks into her then looks away at something
How you sleeping these days, girl
How am  what
47
You sleep good
No, not lately
How'd you know
He veers off the path and pulls up a plant and brings it back to her
Chamomile, it's good when the nights get long
Helps you nod off
She takes it and smiles up at him
Want to go on a ways
Yes
Would you stay for supper
don't want to be any trouble
supper guest every 30-40 years is not much trouble, Girl
Alright then
He holds out his arm
Better stay close, some big old wild cats been eating my chickens
She looks around and takes his arm
or maybe it was me
She snorts and slaps his arm but doesn't let go
73  73 48
74
'  -  74 They enter the dark room together
Bush lights a lantern, gets a chair from a corner and holds it out for her
She sits and watches him check a cast iron pot on the warm stove and put a log on the fire
She notices the beautiful table
You always were good with your hands
He puts a glass of tea in front of her and sits down
You still play the piano
teach a few girls
got a good feeling when you played
Remember that time you was playing and the lamp burned out
And you went right on in the dark
hear that song sometimes at night
She shrugs shyly and sips the tea
Seconds tick by
Sure is quiet out here
(cocks his head) What
said it's
(stops/gets the joke) tried to write you at times but didn't know what to say
Well
heard you married
He was a Doctor; a real good man
We lived in St
Louis for awhile
He died unexpectedly about a year ago
came back here because have no idea why
(sips tea/thinks) () 49 (') The list of people who are gone is getting longer and longer and sometimes  feel like all 'm doing is waiting for my name to come up
You have a tender heart, always did
She gives him a curious look
You can't wait for anything, Mattie
Close your eyes, hold your breath
stay in one spot your whole life, but you're still moving, like the world's moving under you
There's no waiting
And there's no getting over some things either, is there
Reckon not, Little Bit
Little Bit
Oh my God, nobody's called me that in
But suddenly she is lifted from the chair as if by strong ropes
She stares at the wall as she walks toward Bush's bed
Bush is stricken and white
He would stop her if he could but it is too late
She walks right up to the picture at the edge of the lamp light and stares into it as if it is a mirage that will disappear if she blinks
Finally she whirls and looks at him, her face a tortured mask
strangled sob escapes her
He gets up and stands there staring at the floor
Suddenly she is moving toward him and then past him and out the door
Her shadow merges with the darkness
Bush stands with his head down, staring into oblivion
75  75 50
76  76 78
/ -  78 Buddy comes in frowning and lugging a heavy mail sack
What the hell
He looks up and sees more sacks dumped on the desk
Frank is grinning and ripping open envelopes from the sacks and each one has 5 dollars in it
Buddy looks down and sees even more mail sacks on the floor
Jesus, kid
Yeah
But, but it's not our money
Well yeah, no, but some of it's gonna be
We're putting this thing on
Frank rips open two more envelopes and dollar bills rain down to the floor
He's beside himself
Buddy eyes him warily
He should be here
'm gonna go get him
They lock eyes
Frank finally tosses him the hearse keys
79  79 80
/ -  80 Buddy, Frank, and Bush are staring reverently at the money stacked across the desk and the full paper sacks all around the desk
Bush eyes Buddy who is still quiet
51
don't know exactly how much your land's worth but looks to me like you could get maybe 10 times that or more
don't know what to do with it
mean it's yours to do with what you want but 'm getting a little nervous about it
Never thought 'd see enough money to make me nervous
We should probably talk about the price for everything, the clothes, the ads, the food and drink for the party, the music
our fee for everything, we'll be fair about that, 'm not worried about it
Bush is looking at Buddy who is looking across the room
What do you think, boy
Buddy jerks, looks at Frank, at Bush
Money makes people do funny things
Frank scowls
think you should probably put it in the bank, sir
No
Ray is not
(off Bush's look) mean, if it was my money 'd put it in a bank out of town so everyone didn't know my business
This bank here, you can't trust, that's all 'm saying
Can  trust you
Every name, every dollar, is right there
Not what  asked
52
've done a hell of a job for you
don't see why
Mr
Bush,  didn't mean to imply
Hush
've sold horses, cars, houses, hell, pocket watches pinned to the inside of my coat
'm not ashamed of it
don't rob banks, don't cheat at cards, and  sleep all right the nights  sleep
What was the question
They goddamn
He nods at the money and suddenly becomes the "other" Bush
Take out for the expenses you've already had and give me the receipts
As the bills come in for things, give them to me and 'll pay them
Put this money in a box and the boy and 'll take it someplace in the morning
Whatever new comes in, keep it in the bottom of one of them ugly caskets in there 'till  come get it
After the party, name a fair price for what you've done and we'll settle up
( ) 'll be at the car
After he's gone, Frank and Buddy stare at each other
Is it just me or is he extremely fucking articulate when he wants to be
don't know who's selling who what anymore
53
It's not clear, is it
Not only that but something feels really wrong
Hold on
told you that you were working on commission
Yeah, but
So whatever our end of this is, you get a piece
piece
Half
It could help set you up, Buddy
So whatever feels wrong is gonna feel right pretty damn quick,okay
We just have to close it out
From here on, watch me, do what  do, and we'll be fine
But
He wants you to go with him to take this money somewhere which means that it's you he trusts
And that's fine because  trust you too
Just don't trust him, okay
'm lost again
Look, that funny feeling you have
have it too
And it's not funny
So go along, be friendly, but that's it
() There's a euphoria that comes with closing a deal, Buddy, and the bigger the deal, the higher you get
It's better than anything
() 54 (') But the critical time is just before it closes
It's like a witching hour and everything tries to come apart
We're not going to let that happen
All right
Now go
(as Buddy starts out) You know
always wondered why you wanted to work here
thought you could do a lot better
(off Buddy's look back) didn't know about your folks, 'm really sorry
Thank you
He goes on
Frank turns and flips through a large stack of bills, hungrily entranced
81
' / -  8 1 Buddy's son is crying his heart out
Kathryn comes in unbuttoning her blouse, picks him up, sits down, slips her blouse off her shoulder, brings the boy to her breast and voila, his sorrow miraculously vanishes
Buddy appears in the doorway, his eyes soft with love
might have a crying fit coming on too
Is that right
Feeling a little weepy
You boys
(leans against door frame) can maybe do something really good for us, Katy
55
You already have
mean, money wise
About Mr
Bush
Yeah
'm getting half of whatever we make off of him
So why aren't you happy about it
Didn't know  wasn't
(off her look) was happy for a minute
And then the whole thing of making a carnival out of a person's death, don't know if it's right
Is it what he wants
He says it is
You are not responsible for what other people do, Buddy, just you
You're right
You're always right
At least  am when 'm half naked
Right
82
'  -  82 very determined little  is working her way through a song on the piano that is unrecognizable in this form, even to her
Mattie sits just behind the girl with tears in her eyes, not really listening
On the table beside the piano is a stack of picture albums and old yellowed newspaper articles
56
83 / ' / -  83 Sitting in the hearse outside of Bush's shack, Buddy watches Bush get in the car with his shotgun
There is a big wooden box of money on the seat between them
Bush props his shotgun against it
Where to, sir
North
(starting the hearse) How far
Till  say, son
Buddy gives him an uneasy look and pulls off down the tree- lined path
84
-  84 The hearse slips around the narrow road that cuts through miles of farm land lying fallow in the winter
85
-  85 Buddy looks out at the highway
He is driving slow
Bush is leaning against the money, thinking
How much further now
Bush waves him on
Buddy scowls then decides to get serious about this
He presses on the accelerator and the hearse takes off down the highway
86
-  86 Frank is hopelessly lost in a sea of envelopes
The phone is ringing off the hook, there are full sacks around him, and some Reporter is trying to take a picture through the front window
Frank scowls and lowers the blinds
57
87
'  -  87 Frank is at Mattie's door entranced by the troubled but beautiful piano music coming from inside
It stops abruptly when he knocks
In seconds, Mattie appears
Hey Mattie
He looks almost boyish and bashful as he drinks her in
Was that you
It was really
This is a surprise
Yeah, sorry
He stands, loving the view, forgetting why he is here
She waits it out as long as she can, not sure how she feels about this adoring look
Was there something you
Uh, yeah
Help
What
'm up to my ears with this funeral and  thought, you know, we haven't had time to talk much lately so maybe you'd like to come over and rip open envelopes with me and 'm sorry,  have lessons all afternoon
have to get back in
Oh, okay,  just
Sorry
She slips back inside
Frank stares at the door
58
88
`  -  88 Mattie leans against the door with her eyes closed
There is no student at the piano
89  89/90 89 91
/  -  91 The hearse is parked in front of a beautiful white board church
91A
-  91A Close on Bush and Buddy
Don't say nothing
To who
You can say "hi"
Bush gets out
Buddy sighs, mimes "Hi" and gets out
92
-  92 Buddy quietly creeps in through the front door, looks back over his shoulder, scowls, and enters the church
93 He stops and looks around, awed by the beautifully serene 93 sanctuary
Now he sees a tall   (70) come out of an office door behind the pulpit, walk up the aisle, glancing out the window at the driveway, and then at Buddy
Hi
Hello
Buddy is out of words that he is allowed to say
He glances at the door but Bush is not coming in
59
Hi
Charlie holds out his hand, Buddy shakes it
Are you sure you're in the right place
Not expecting a funeral
Suddenly Bush steps into the church
Charlie squints over then stares at Bush with utter disbelief
Felix
Hey, Charlie
They shake hands, then hug
Buddy is blown away that Bush would hug anyone
Bush looks up at the church rafters
Still standing
Yes
Charlie give Bush a look then holds out his hand to Buddy again
Reverend Charlie Jackson
Hi
That's Buddy Robinson, he don't talk much
Someone better talk
ghost pulls up in the driveway in a hearse, you expect a little bit of a story
94
-  94 Bush, Buddy and Charlie, sit in pews near a lovely altar
60
My hearing is not what it was
It sounded like you said you want me to preach at your funeral party with you sitting there
Yes, sir
(shaking his head) You know 've talked to God a lot about you over the years and he said he broke the mould when he made you
Said you were sure entertaining to watch but way too much trouble
Buddy grins
Well
What would you want me to say at this funeral
Whatever you want to, Charlie
( ) Could you give us a minute
Buddy starts to get up
Sit still
Buddy plops back down
What's the matter
You scared to be alone with me
He can hear what's said
Buddy is surprised again
So is Charlie
All right
After you left here
did you do the right thing
61
Felix looks up at the beautifully crafted pulpit
did
what  thought was right
You confessed
Asked forgiveness
Bush looks off and the muscles jump in his jaw
Did you tell her, Felix
Charlie sighs, leans on his knees, and drops his head
You came a long way for nothing then
Bush's eyes jerk back to Charlie and they are hot
Buddy tenses
You self-righteous
Don't you dare
built my own jail and put myself in it
And  stayed in it for 40 goddamn years
No wife, no kids, no friends
That's not enough
You know it isn't
(tears welling up) Well
Why don't you come and say that then, Charlie
Hell, say it all
don't care
Not on your life
The air is so heavy you can't breathe it
Bush suddenly gets up and leaves
Buddy starts to follow
Charlie puts his hand on him to stay
They sit in silence a moment
How much do you know about him
62
Almost nothing, sir
just work at the funeral home
Do you know he built this church
No
( ) How's a man like him make something like this
mean,  know he's a good carpenter but this is
Magic
(off Buddy's look) Maybe it's the best of him, maybe he put his soul into it,  don't know
What ya'll were talking about
what did he do
Who was he supposed to tell
() For him and God to know  guess wish 'd never been put between them, that's for sure
() will tell you that he showed up here half dead
had just started preaching
Over the next 4 years we built this
Are you coming to the funeral
Charlie sighs and looks around
94A Omitted 94A 95
// -  95 Buddy and Bush are both lost in thought
Finally
Can  ask you something
63
Do you have to
Yes
What are we doing
Since the day you came into the funeral home, don't think anything has happened that you didn't want to happen just don't know where it's going
There's a whole lot of things that you don't know
Like what a dog dreams
You can make up a story about him chasing rabbits but you don't know if there's rabbits in there or not
And he can't tell you, can he
Not unless he's a very special dog
They snort together
People don't say what they mean either so you don't really know any more about them then you do about that dog's dream
But what
( ) That time you left my house  saw you stop and look back
You wanted to know what could make somebody like me
(off Buddy's uneasy look) Well here you are, son, here you are
96
-  9 6 Frank is putting money into a casket
He checks his watch
() Where are you
Lighting flashes and the lights suddenly go out
64
97
-  97 The hearse creeps down the road 98
-  9 8 Buddy looks tired
Bush is sitting up ramrod straight, thinking hard about something
better stop and tell Frank we're back
He's probably had 2 or 3 hissy fits by now
(looks out at the rain) Why don't you stay the night at the house and 'll take you home in the morning
The simple kindness seems to short Bush out
Buddy doesn't notice, he's still looking ahead
Well,
ain't stayed with nobody in a
in a long while
It's fine if you want to
Bush looks as if he might say yes but he  where the car is passing through and
Let me out
What
Stop the car
Bush starts to open the door
Buddy stops abruptly
You can't walk
It's too far
Bush climbs out with his shotgun
Put the money in a casket
65
You might as well get back in, 'll follow you all the way
(snaps the gun closed) Get the hell out of here, boy
Buddy's eyes are defiant
Bush slams the door and walks away, crossing over a fence and out into a dark field
Not responsible
Not responsible
Shit
He slams the steering wheel
99  99 100  100 101
-  101 Buddy is putting the money into the foot of a casket
lit candelabra sits nearby
There is , like the muted sound of something breaking
Buddy jerks and listens
Frank
Hello
Mr
Bush
He stuffs the money into the casket, grabs the candelabra, comes back, seals the lid, and starts into the office
102
-  102 Under the trees crooked rows of cold ghostly headstones glisten in the darkness
An old pocket lighter flares to reveal Bush staring at a pot of yellow flowers
He holds the lighter to a tombstone and brushes away the debris
It reads: 1874
1894
rolls
Close on Bush's face as rain begins to fall
They keep talking about forgiveness
ask Jesus for forgiveness
never did nothing to Him
66
103  103/104/105 103 106
-  106 Frank enters with a flashlight
He sees that his desk and files have been ransacked
He rushes into the casket room
Several caskets have been thrown to the floor
He goes to the one where the money is, finds that it is sealed tight, and sighs with relief
Hearing something he whips the light around and sees Buddy on the floor
107
- / 107 Frank examines a cut and bump on top of Buddy's head by flashlight and dabs it gently with a cloth
The cut's not bad but how's the head
He moves his finger across Buddy's eyes
Follow it
He looks him over carefully
He's had experience
Dizzy
Double vision
Nauseous
(off Buddy's no) You'll be okay
Did you see who it was
No
was putting the money in
heard glass breaking
locked up the casket quick and
boom
You did good
Doesn't feel good
108
/  -  108 Mattie sits beside a fire, knitting a baby blanket by an oil lamp
All at once the lights sputter on, the radio lights up, warms, and begins to , as a  at the door
67
109
/
/  -  109 Mattie pulls the door open
Bush is standing there soaking wet, breathing hard, holding his shotgun
She draws back reflexively
He looks into her
Please, Ma'am
110
/ -  110 Bush stands with a towel around him, shivering
Mattie opens a dresser drawer
Inside the drawer, is the carefully arranged tableau of a watch, a ring, a stethoscope, and some clothes
She hates to disturb the drawer but pulls out a pair of black pants and a white shirt, lays them on the bed, and walks out
111
/  -  111 Mattie steps from the kitchen with a steaming mug as Bush comes down the stairs in clothes that are too loose
Still shivering, Bush steps uneasily in front of the fire
Mattie hands him the hot mug
He looks uneasily at the yellow flowers on the table nearby
Thank you
What are you doing here
Burned through, a log falls in the fire
Bush jerks oddly and moves away
Can  sit a minute
She stares at him then nods at a chair
She keeps standing behind the other chair
He bends over the mug and seems to lock up inside
You want to know why  have your sister's picture on my wall
68
'm not stupid, Felix
No,  take that back
How long was it going on
She was already married when met you
Were you just making up to me to get to her
Bush is so still he looks like a gargoyle
If you're not going to talk, leave
Can you help who you love
Mattie's face tells us that she has asked herself that question many times
've had 40 years to think about it and  still don't know
don't know either, so
Slowly the gargoyle unfolds
His eyes drill into her
want to tell you how it was
If you don't want me to, 'll go
Mattie sighs from down deep in her shoes then comes around and sits down
Don't lie to me
When did you take up with her
came to see you and she was there, hanging clothes on the line with your mama
Bush stares out the window so hard, Mattie turns to see what he is looking at
She turned around
(as Mattie turns back) and
promise you that  did not know that  had a heart till right then
69
Tears well up in Mattie's eyes
You were a fine fine girl
didn't know why you wanted anything to do with me but  was gonna keep coming to see you 'till my luck ran out
() And then  saw her
She was married
And she wasn't just my sister, she was my best friend
We told each other everything
can't
how long did it go on
Bush's face is so white it looks like a death mask
How long
It's still going on, Little Bit
Mattie tries to absorb that
The truth and tragedy of it touches her in way that she is not prepared for
They sit there in silence
She suddenly wipes her face and scowls
Did you have anything to do with her death
The mug trembles
She sees it
Tell me
Like a fish jerked from the water, he mouth opens and closes, but nothing comes out
(') Felix
(off his haunted silence) Get out of my house
Bush stands up quickly and starts for the door
And go to hell
Been there
70
He staggers, tries to catch himself but slides down against the wall
Despite her anger, Mattie starts toward him
112
/  - /  112 Bush sits on the floor, pale as moonlight
Mattie is beside him with a stethoscope in her lap
You need to see a doctor
He raises his eyes to her but says nothing
They look into each other for a long moment
Just tell me, Felix
Did you hurt Mary or not
Bush stares into her then suddenly gets up, picks up his shotgun and goes out the door without a word
113
/  -  113 Frank is putting the files back in the drawers when he hears a
He reaches into the drawer and turns with a pistol in his hand
Bush is standing in the doorway with his shotgun
What the hell
Bush glances at the pistol, at the open drawers of the cabinet and desk
They get it
No
Buddy sealed it up in a casket
Took a crack on the head, but
(cold dark look) Is he all right
Yeah
71
You sure
was an army medic
He'll be fine
But Bush is still dark
But you ought to take those clothes back and get something in your size
They get the whiskey
114
/ - / 114 Frank sits with his feet on the desk
Bush sits across from him
They each have a cup of whiskey
Brought the money back, huh
(off Bush's absent nod) Listen, 've been thinking
What if we had the party at your place
People are going to want to see the land they're getting so
Don't know
Well, think about it, we could
Don't know that 'm doing it
What
Thinking to call it off
You can't
Damn well can if  want to
No no no, it's in motion
72
If  say no, it's no
Send the money back
You're killing me
bought things, hired people
promised money, everybody in town is hoping to
care about this town as much as they care about me
It's what you said you wanted and 've busted my ass for you
So why don't you want it anymore
You owe me that
( ) It was the end of the line, tell it all, get out of jail party
But guess  ain't got the goddamn guts to open my own mouth and  can't get nobody to talk for me so the hell with it
And to hell with me
Bush grabs his shotgun and goes
Frank sits, stunned
115
' -  115 Buddy sits at the breakfast table, holding his son
He opens and closes his eyes, checking out his vision
Kathryn, at the stove, sees him out of the corner of her eye
Are you having trouble seeing
see you're mad
'm not mad
'm concerned She shoves the skillet off the burner and comes to him
( ) No, you're mad
She tenderly touches his head
73
If  could get my hands on whoever did this, you'd see mad
(
) Buddy
You up
Frank rushes in, lifts a phantom hat to Kathryn, scrapes up a chair, pulls on the baby's toe, and looks at Buddy
Trouble
What's the matter
Bush is pulling out
What
What happened yesterday
told you, we went up to Illinois and met a preacher
But what happened
He asked the preacher to come to the funeral
He said no
Son of a bitch, that's got to be
( ) Sorry
(to the baby) Sorry
Where's the preacher
It won't do you any good
Why not
He knows something about Bush, something bad,  think
74
What is it
Wouldn't say but
Well if Bush wants him, by God, Bush is gonna get him
(slams the skillet down) You want eggs, Frank, or will the skillet do
What
What's wrong
What's wrong
My husband has his head bashed in and all you care about is this party
It's not like that, Katie, this is for all of us
You're like
family to me
This is not how family acts
Well, 'm sorry
've never had any practice
(gets up/to Buddy) You okay
Buddy nods
Frank leaves
Buddy mutters to the baby
Stay out of her way today, partner
116
'  -  11 6 Mattie is on her knees trying to plant bulbs in the hard cold ground
Her trowel barely gouges the earth
She stabs it again and again into the ground
Fool, it's too late for bulbs
75
Suddenly she hurls the trowel as far as she can, then a handful of bulbs
then her hat
too goddamn late
117
/ -  117 Buddy is surrounded by bags
He is copying down names onto raffle tickets and putting them in bin for the drawing
There is a  standing guard by the front door with a rifle
118
'  -  118 Mule stands with his ears back, upset
Bush, back in his old clothes, is angrily planing a board
The box of his casket minus the lid is on sawhorses behind him
119  119 120
' / -   120 blurred image becomes clear as a magnifying glass lowers to a page of a stamp collection book
Fingers fill an empty space with a prized addition
startles him and the stamp is placed slightly crooked
Reveal Charlie Jackson scowling at the crooked stamp
He gets up, does a double-take out the window
121
'  -   121 Charlie opens the door, sees Frank standing there
The hearse is parked outside
Reverend Jackson
(Charlie looks at hearse) Frank Quinn, Quinn funeral home
How'd you find me
Frank just smiles, takes off his hat, and offers his hand
Charlie gives him a long look and reluctantly motions him in
76
Frank enters, noting the clean simple home of man with an orderly mind
Charlie motions for Frank to sit down
was going to play some dominos this afternoon
But something told me to stay home
should have played dominos
Is he out there
Bush
No, sir
You sure
Pretty sure
Did you check the back
Frank snorts, liking Charlie immediately
You told Bush that you wouldn't come to the funeral
If he got that, why are you here
To help you rethink it
don't need any help
Have you rethought it
(off Charlie's look) So there is a need
() First off, Bush doesn't know 'm here
77
wouldn't be so sure about that
(off Frank's look) He's got a way of making people do what he wants them to
Frank squirms, knows it true
Is he really a hermit
Frank whistles and takes Bush's poster out of his coat
Charlie jerks at the picture of the wild man
He came to see me after he'd been here, wants to call the party off
don't care
Said he'd meant it to be a
end of the line, tell it all, get out of jail funeral but that he didn't have the guts to open his mouth and he couldn't get anybody to talk for him
You know anything about that part
(off Charlie's sigh) At first he said he wanted everybody to come who had a story about him
But he didn't want to hear their bullshit stories, did he
Pardon my language
He wants to tell one, doesn't he
78
About time
Whatever he did, it's been locked up in him for 40 years and he can't get it out
(off Charlie's look) think he told you
You may be the only person he told
And now he wants you to tell it for him
Because he won't
Or can't
Or won't
Or can't
() At least he wants the truth to come out, give him that
( ) 'll think about it
Is there a boarding house around here
said 'd think
Yeah but if you're not coming, 'm not going back
made promises can't keep to people  care about
This falls apart they won't blame Bush
Bank will take my business
If 'm gonna have to start over again, might as well be from here
Charlie scowls at him
79
122
-  122 Using a tool, Buddy unseals the casket to put the new money in it and discovers that the rest of the money is gone
He can't believe it
He yanks back the casket bed lining
123  123 126
'  -  126 Bush is sanding the beautiful lid of his casket
It is leaning against the wall and sawdust is drifting down all over him
He suddenly stops, rubs the wood tenderly, muscles up the heavy top to put it on the box and staggers back
It's not the weight, something is wrong
Sweat pops out on his forehead
He forces himself to the casket and drops the top down hard, staggers back against the loft ladder, slides down to the ground, and stares at the casket
Is this it
127
-  127 The hearse sits on the side of the road
Road signs give the mileage to different destinations
127A
-  127A Frank is lying in the back of the hearse, his head propped up on an old suitcase
He sips from his flask and stares out the window, thinking
128
'  -   128 Bush is still on the ground propped against the ladder
His eyes are closed and the fading light steals across his face that is as still as it can be
The sawdust makes him look almost wooden
shadow crosses then comes closer
Buddy is sure he is dead but Bush's eyes open
What are you doing, sir
Getting a suntan
Bush starts to get up then falls back against the ladder
80
Are you stuck
You have no goddamn idea how right you are, son
Buddy moves to help him up but Bush waves him off
'll sit here a minute
Bush looks at the butterfly bandage on Buddy's head
We're a pair, ain't we
Are you sick
Just going through the motions
What does that mean
There's Alive and there's Dead
And there's a worst place in between them that  hope you never know nothing about
() Do you know who hurt you
No, sir
Sonsabitches
It doesn't matter
Listen
Frank went somewhere and the raffle money is gone
You figure he took off with it
don't know
don't want to think that
But the money's not here and don't know where it is
He said he'd call and he never did
81
Buddy glances into the shadows and sees the casket looming on the sawhorses
He stares at it
Well
what do you want to do
Buddy looks back at Bush
don't
(realizing just then) want to make this funeral for you if you want it
(a long look) Hell
Do it if you can
() guess for everyone like me, there's one like you, son
about forgot that
Buddy holds out his hand to help Bush up but Bush forces himself up on his own and walks out
129  129 130
' /  -  130 Charlie sits at his desk, staring blankly at his crooked stamp
Suddenly Fate in the form of Frank Quinn looms at the window
Charlie knows he is there but he won't look at him
131
' /-  131 Buddy, Kathryn, and the baby are sleeping soundly
There is a Buddy sits up, grabs a baseball bat and falls back asleep
The scratching starts again
He opens his eyes, surprised to see the bat in his hand
He hears the scratching
He looks around, sees something at the window
He slides to the floor, crawls on his knees, and looks out
Frank is standing there, scratching on the screen
Behind him is Charlie, looking very unhappy about standing in the near dark in a small southern town, scratching on a screen
Buddy realizes what he is seeing and starts to smile
82
132
'  -  132 Frank, Buddy, and Charlie are on the porch, watching the world come to life
Charlie looks as if he is hoping for some kind of sign from above
'm glad you decided to come, sir
Free will is not all that it's cracked up to be
( ) Did you take the money out of the casket
Yeah
Why didn't you tell me
forgot
You forgot
Where is it
In the hearse, under the floorboards
Charlie remembers that Frank said he wasn't coming back and gives him a look
Buddy is giving Frank the same look
What
Nobody steals a hearse
Now all we got to do is take the Reverend here to Bush and
forgot to tell you, Mr
Bush already said he would do it
You're shittin' me
Charlie gets up and starts walking away
83
Where can  catch a train
You can't leave you just got here
Watch and learn
Hold on
Where's the station

The Quinn Funeral home hearse completes the unlikely parade

The old hermit is gone

She is not going
136
' / -  136 At the top of a wide clearing, a truck with a Circus Ad on the door is being set up to become a stage
The tractor and truck pull into the clearing and drive to the circus truck
The hearse pulls in and parks
Frank, Buddy, and Charlie climb out of the hearse, look around, and stand frozen
84
Trucks and cars are parked everywhere around the big clearing
Many  have been here all night with fires, tents and lean-tos
Many   are arriving now
Expecting a crowd
Frank and Buddy give each other a look
Honestly
We don't have a clue about what's going to happen here
- : The big old honking generator is unloaded
Holes are dug
10 foot poles are slid from the truck and huge speaker horns are attached
Speaker poles are pulled up and set into holes
Frank directs a gang of 6  who are selling raffle tickets making sure they know that he has his eyes on them
arrives on the back of pick-up truck
The Generator kicks on belching smoke everywhere
Frank is yelling Whoa Whoa
Disaster in the making

He sees Charlie approaching and opens the door for him
Charlie climbs the steps, appraises the shack, and stares at Bush
Pretty nice jail
Charlie enters and looks around the little room
Why did you change your mind
Charlie just looks at him, the unspoken words louder than any reason he could give
Thank you
How do you want to do this
don't
He gets a haunted look that catches Charlie off guard
'm gonna try and tell it, Charlie, really am
But if  can't get it done, would you do it
want it said
Please, sir
Charlie sighs from down in his shoes and starts for the door
Tell'em the box is in the barn
141  141 142
' /  -  142 Carl's truck is half hidden off the road
Carl, Gary and get out of the truck
86
Carl tucks an old 45 in the back of his pants
Gary and Theman grab three gas cans off the truck, give one to Carl, and clamber down a deep gully and start up the other side
Tom peeks out from behind the big garbage barrels
143
' / -  143 The generator is working
And standing on the flat bed truck, which is now a stage, an  introduces a hot blue grass group The crowd is huge now and listens as the group kicks off a song
Behind the stage Frank is collecting money from the boys who are selling the raffle tickets, making them turn their pockets inside out
The generator makes a strange noise, Frank eyeballs it, and it labors on
Buddy walks up, nudges Frank, and nods out at the huge crowd
Can you believe this
Charlie walks up and says something that we cannot hear
144
'  -  144 Pacing the cage, Bush peeks out the window
You asked for it you old ornery sonofabitch, now what are you gonna do
145
'  -  145 Frank, Buddy, and Charlie enter the barn and see Mule hitched to the wagon
On the back of the wagon is a simple and rustically elegant casket with the initials  carved into the center board
It sobers them all
146
' / -  146 Carl, Gary, and Theman hide and watch Frank, Buddy and Charlie walk Mule and the wagon away from the barn and down the road
Carl eyes Bush's shack and starts for it
Hey, hey, where you going
He said the woods
Closer
87
And he takes off
He's crazy
147  147 148  148 149
' / -  149 The bluegrass fiddle player nods to the others to quickly end the song
Now we see why
Frank, Buddy, and Charlie have brought the wagon with the coffin into the field
Everyone quiets, remembering why they are here
They park the wagon behind the hearse
Frank and Charlie walk toward the stage
Buddy peels away
Frank calls after him to come with them to the stage but Buddy waves them away
He wants no part of that
He sees Kathryn and Horton threading their way through the crowd and moves toward them instead
Frank and Charlie climb the makeshift stairs up to the stage
Charlie sits down on a folding chair while Frank goes to the big microphone and stares with satisfaction at the huge Depression-era Woodstock crowd
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen
'm Frank Quinn of Quinn Funeral Home
Welcome to the live funeral party of Mr
Felix Bush
People don't know whether to clap or not
Some do and the rest of them pick it up
Buddy gets to Kathryn and hugs her and the baby
Where's Mattie
She wouldn't come
don't
've done some things in my life, but never this
Bet you haven't either, bet no one has
() 88
(') (winks back at Charlie) We try to make things predictable and safe but if we don't risk everything to get what we want, we don't want it enough
150  150 151
' / -  151 Frank finds Buddy in the crowd
The person who made all of this happen for us doesn't like the spotlight but Buddy Robinson is the heart of Quinn Funeral Home and 'm proud to know him
Buddy is embarrassed and moved
Kathryn's eyes soften
152
'  -  152 Carl is sloshing gasoline onto the back porch while Gary and Theman keep nervous watch at the farendof porch
Suddenly Carl feels a shotgun's cold metal on his neck and the 45 being ripped from his belt and thrown to the ground
Sonsabitches
Carl drops his can
The other men drop their cans but Gary starts to pull a pistol from his back pocket
Go on, 'll paint the porch with his head
Don't do it
Gary drops the pistol
Now pick up them cans and keep pouring
What
89
You heard me
The men cautiously pick up the cans
Pour it on your head
All of it
The men look at each other
Bush cocks the other barrel of his shotgun
won't
Pour it or die,  don't care which
The men hoist the cans and start to pour the gasoline over them
Burning and spitting they empty the cans
Suddenly Theman bolts, moaning and running blind with gas in his eyes
got two barrels, anybody else wants to rabbit, now's the time
153
' / -  153 know many of you have heard stories about Mr
Bush
But today 've been told that we're going to hear another kind of story, his
murmuring moves in a wave across the crowd as they see
Bush enters the field with his shotgun pointed at Carl and Gary's backs
They are drenched with gas and it is burning them through their clothes
Buddy, Kathryn, and Horton see Bush
Quinn and Charlie follow the crowd's eyes to Bush
Holy Mother of
beside the stage see Bush
But everyone remains frozen, not knowing what has happened or what to do now
Is this the crazy Bush of the legends
89A
Buddy starts toward Bush
Kathryn tries to stop him but he pulls free and walks slowly toward Bush
shot rings out
90
Carl and Gary hit the ground like dead men
The crowd hunkers and scatters
Horton steps in front of Kathryn and the baby
Buddy freezes
Charlie rushes up beside Frank at the microphone
Carl rolls up and turns to Bush and sees blood seeping out onto his shirt beneath his coat
Bush whirls and sees
Carl's old 45 still smoking
The gun is in Tom's small shaking hands
Don't hurt him
It's my fault
,
Bush cracks his shotgun, walks slowly to the boy, gently takes the 45, empties the shells, and hands the gun back
second chance is a precious thing, son
Don't waste it
The boy plops down, overwhelmed
And suddenly everyone is in motion
The Deputies run toward Bush
Frank and Charlie rush from the stage
Kathryn and Horton are going
Buddy arrives at Bush first and sees the blood weeping onto his shirt
Are you alright, sir
Without turning Bush glances at the Deputies
Tried to burn me out
Let the boy be, he didn't mean nothing
As the Deputies get a hold of Carl and Gary, Frank, Charlie, Kathryn and Horton arrive
Carl looks at Horton with pleading eyes and nods to Tom
Help him, Gus, please
91
Horton goes to the trembling boy and picks him up
Bush suddenly walks into the trees without looking back
153A
-  153A The Announcer hangs up the phone on the wall, rushes to the turntable and lifts the tone arm from the record that is playing
Folks, 've just received word of a tragic turn of events at the Bush Funeral Party
It seems that Mr
Bush has been shot
repeat, Mr
Felix Bush has been shot
There is no word of condition

(
) When  know more  will let you know
'm sure he would appreciate your prayers
154
'  -  154 Bush stands at the mirror, his shirt unbuttoned and pulled back
The bullet caught the muscle just above his clavicle
Buddy, Frank and Charlie rush in
Close the door
Charlie slams the door
Frank examines the wound
Buddy stares in shock at the old roping burns scars on Bush's chest
Missed the bone
Got any alcohol and clean rags
Bush nods at the cabinet
Charlie finds an amazing assortment of herbs and roots, alcohol and old sheets ripped into rags
Why don't you sit down, sir
92
Boil some water and 'll tell you how to make me a poultice
Frank takes the rags and alcohol from Charlie This is gonna hurt
Don't sugar coat it
155
' / -  155 Everyone is standing around in shock
156
'  -  156 Kathryn waits anxiously near the porch with the baby
157
' / -  157 Horton steps up to the microphone
The shocked crowd turns to him
He closes his eyes and bows his head
Lord, you say you move in mysterious ways and we believe you because we don't understand much of anything
And so we come to you today not seeking answers to what's happened here but asking you to help us open our hearts a little more to each other and find some forgiveness and understanding
158
'  -  158 Frank has cleaned the wound
Buddy has made a poultice that Bush is pressing onto the wound as he hears the last of Horton's prayer over the loudspeakers
Pretty good prayer
Mighta been wrong about that preacher
Why don't you lay down, Felix
93
Bush thinks about it, sees a way out
For a second he looks like he might take it
Then he shakes his head, puts a rag over the poultice and pulls his shirt up
Let's go 'fore  lose my nerve
Are you sure
Bush scowls at the huge blood stain on his shirt
He looks at Frank's white shirt
Frank just stares at him
Bush keeps looking
Finally Frank sighs and starts loosening his tie
159
' / -  159 The bluegrass band sings a good hymn
The crowd is still stunned and talking, not knowing what to do
160
'  -  160 Buddy gently helps Bush into his jacket, which has a bullet tear in it along the shoulder but Bush seems okay with it, to Frank's relief
Frank is putting on an old faded shirt of Bush's
As Bush starts for the door, he comes up beside Charlie
You ain't nervous
All them white folks out there
There's white folks here
Stick with me, you'll be all right
You're the one they're shooting at
As Charlie opens the door, Bush stops, all his misgivings flooding in with the light
He looks at Buddy
Pretty interesting day so far, huh boy
Bush straightens himself up and goes out the door
94
161
' / -  161 Charlie, Bush walk through the murmuring parting crowd toward the stage
Frank and Buddy are close behind
Buddy is looking for Kathryn
She spots him and moves toward the stage
162
' / -  162 Bush and Charlie go up the steps to the stage
At the last second, Bush stares at the big microphone and stops, unable to go on
Charlie gives him a look then goes on up to the microphone and looks out a the sea of white folks
'm Reverend Charlie Jackson
Felix wants to continue with his funeral
And he's asked me to say a few words
Just below the stage, Buddy and Frank are joined by Kathryn
Charlie glances back at Bush, turns inward, searching for the words
Finally he holds his hands out, wide apart
We like to imagine that good and bad, right and wrong, are miles apart
But the truth is, very often they're
(brings his hand together and laces his fingers ) all tangled up with each other
Bush raises his head and looks at Charlie's back
Some 40 years ago Felix Bush dropped into my life and then dropped out
In between he built the most beautiful sanctuary that 've ever seen
lot of wonderful things happened in that church
Suddenly Bush breaks away, moves up beside Charlie, and puts his hand on his shoulder
95
Thank you, Charlie
Thank you
Charlie gives him a long look then steps away from the microphone and moves back to where Bush was standing
Bush stares at the microphone, takes a breath, and walks up to it, and looks out over the huge crowd
Had to go clear to Illinois to find somebody that had anything good to say about me
Hell of a thing
His voice booms out over the crowd, startling him
He looks down, sees Buddy, Kathryn, Frank and Horton
He looks closer for someone most important but she is not there
The crowd murmurs
Finally
'm not a smart man or a wise one
don't know what kind of man  am
was always restless, thought 'd see the world
But  didn't hardly go nowhere
on purpose
() Because
because  did something that  was ashamed of
Something couldn't ever fix
( ) Ya'll probably think you know what you'd do or what you wouldn't
And wish you good luck with that really do
() When  told Charlie what 'd done, he told me to confess to God and the law and to
to someone else
so  could get forgiveness
But didn't want forgiveness
() needed to hold on to what  did
to be sick from it every day of my life
So  never told nobody else
He stops, not knowing how to go on
The crowd has quieted completely
As as his eyes sweep over the sea of expectant faces, he suddenly   coming through the crowd
96
Mattie's here
Seeing that Felix appears to alright, her face changes from conflicted concern to open unbridled hatred
The look takes Bush's breath away
But he suddenly seems to accept it as his due and when he talks, it is only to her
fell in love with a married lady
And somehow she fell in love with me
It was the only time that have been in love
( ) We made a plan to run off and start a new life but she didn't show up at the time that we said we'd meet
got a funny feeling and  went to her house
Buddy, Kathryn and Frank all see Mattie now, see Bush talking just to her
Her husband answered the door
() He had blood on him
For Mattie all of this is like window into the past being suddenly thrown open and she is haunted and mesmerized
hit him pretty hard, knocked him down
Can't remember going upstairs but  remember  saw a hammer on the steps and it had blood and hair on it
The crowd gasps
Mattie is trembling
found her in the bedroom
She was crawling across the floor
() But before  could get to her and help her up
a kerosene lamp hit the wall
And then her husband jumped on my back
Funny what happens sometimes when things go wrong
It's like the clock stops and you have all the time in the world to think
could see that her husband had set the downstairs on fire before he came up
() () 97
(') And as  was slamming his head into the wall, trying to get shed of him,  could see clear as anything that it was all my fault
If 'd just never spoke to her
() And as  was thinking about that, saw that the lamp he threw had set the room we were in on fire too
Bush forces himself to keep looking into Mattie
And then  realized that  was on fire
tried to put myself out but couldn't, everything was
() dropped him, turned around and saw her lying on the floor and called her name
She looked up at me
() and the next thing  knew,  was flying
loud roar of fire and crushing timbers
163
-  163 man on fire bursts through the second story window of a burning house
He lands hard and rolls across the yard to smother the flames
With his clothes still smoking, he unbelievably tries to run back into the hell
But the fire is too hot and he cannot
He screams like a mad man and runs into the trees
164
' / -  164 The crowd is motionless
Nothing is moving
It is as if the whole world has stopped
Frank, Buddy, and Kathryn are frozen
Bush and Mattie are looking into each other, one anguished soul to another
don't know how  got out the window
() () 98
(') No matter how many times  play it in my mind,  can't remember jumping
thought  killed him, but maybe he pushed me,  don't know
(lost as ever
) swear to you, if  left her in there
everything  know about myself is a lie
But that don't matter
() didn't get her out, Little Bit, didn't
'm sorry
165
'  -  165 Bush sits on the edge his bed
His face is drawn and haunted
The door open and closes
He doesn't look up
Mattie sits down beside him
Tears are streaming down her face
She lays her head gently on his shoulder
Oh, Felix
He sniffs her hair and tenderly touches it
Wonder if her hair would be white
166
' / -   / 166 chooses a winning raffle ticket from a wire cage
poor   with   win the raffle
The promise of a new and better life begins for them
The big funeral party breaks up people wind their way home
The big old honking generator coughs off
Mule is lead back to the barn
The equipment is disassembled and loaded back on the truck
The microphone stands alone on the stage
He got it said
167
'  -  167 Buddy, Frank, Horton, Charlie, and Kathryn and the baby wait outside, giving Bush and Mattie time
Buddy takes the baby and holds it close
99
Finally Mattie and Bush come out of the shack and walk down to the others
No one knows what to say
Finally
How you doing, sir
Just fair, son
Carl said Ray paid them to set the fire
Paid them to break into the funeral home too
Can't stop pulling Aces out of his ass, can he
Spend his money on lawyers now
You know how thrifty they are
Frank motions to Buddy and they go to Bush
Buddy is still holding the baby, Bush looks tenderly at Buddy and the baby
What's his name
Larry, Lawrence, after my dad, sir
He ain't gonna throw rocks at me, is he
Not if knows what's good for him
You boys did good
Real good
Let's settle up
We don't have to do that now
You get some rest
(a look/ then) Yeah
We'll come out tomorrow
Bring my shirt back,  just got it broke in
100
Bush pulls Buddy aside
Frank stares over at them but can't hear what they are saying
He moves over beside Mattie
Are you alright, Mattie
She looks up at Frank for a long moment, her face softening
Oh,  don't know
'm still moving, guess
He doesn't know what that means but she has finally really looked at him and that's something he'll hold onto
Kathryn comes and hugs Mattie as
Bush and Buddy come back
Bush goes to Charlie
Frank is staring at Buddy, looking for a clue as to what Bush said
Buddy gives him nothing, Thanks again for coming, Charlie
'm proud of you
( ) Thank you for my church
Did you ever get my bill
Can we get a ride our car's about 2 miles down the road
Everyone piles into the hearse
There is no back seat so they all have to crawl in the back door and sit along the sides
It makes everyone smile
Mattie gives Bush one last fleeting embrace then climbs in
Bush looks in on them all for a long moment all then closes the door
As the hearse moves out, he waves to Buddy who is looking out the back window
Buddy waves back
( ) Look at that
My funeral and everybody's in there but me
The hearse pulls onto the road and drives away
101
The place is suddenly quiet and beautiful
He looks down the road through the fading dust and sees a  walking slowly toward him
He squints, recognizes her, and his face fills with a timeless love
168
'  -  -    168 It's a cold day beneath the spreading pecan tree
Mule stands hitched to the wagon
The three dog grave markers are frosted
fourth grave marker just like the others leans against the tree
It is freshly carved with: Felix Elijah Bush
pot of fresh yellow flowers sit beside the marker
Bush's beautiful handmade casket is inside his grave
Frank, Mattie, Charlie, Buddy, Kathryn, and Horton stand beside the grave
Several  with shovels wait near the tree
Charlie's eulogy is more of a one-sided conversation which Bush would probably love
Well, Felix, this one's for real, guess
didn't actually see them put you in the box so
Charlie glances over and notices "Charlie" on one of the dog's grave markers
He snorts and shakes his head
Wherever you are, you're probably giving someone a hard time or something wonderful and priceless just to confuse them
Not everything can be figured out, nor everybody
wish you peace from the burdens of your mind and heart
wish it for us all
Mattie moves toward the edge of the grave
Frank puts a hand out to catch her should she should stumble
She stares down at the  on the coffin, opens her hand, and lets the picture of her sister drift down onto the coffin
169
-  169 Everyone moves away as the men fill in the grave
Buddy and Kathryn move up beside Frank and Mattie and Charlie
Buddy tosses the ball of hermit money to Frank
102
50 on the outside, all ones inside
Less than $100
What
told you
Nobody listens to the preacher
Buddy pulls some papers from his coat
The day of the party he told me about the will he had in the secret drawer of his table
He left the raffle money to all of us
Everyone is shocked, touched
( ) But you have to pay for Mule's upkeep for the rest of his life
Charlie grins and Buddy flaps the papers at him
And he set up a fund for the upkeep of your church
What's the catch
No catch, sir
Still don't get it, do you
With Felix, there's always a catch
Maybe he just knew you'd go crazy wondering what it was
They all laugh and move down the hillside
As the laughter fades we see in their faces the impact that Felix Bush has had upon them
Buddy feels the comfort of this odd but growing family and stops and looks back at the grave and the pot of yellow flowers
His curiosity about the fearsome old man has not abated
Nor will it ever
