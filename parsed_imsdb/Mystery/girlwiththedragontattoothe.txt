can't take it anymore
/ know
'm sorry, Henrik
There's nothing more to say
Vanger sets the receiver down and regards a dried white flower in a 6" x 11" frame resting on the brown paper it was wrapped and mailed in
It's somehow ominous, like the dark storm clouds that now burst outside - 2

-  -                              4 Mikael Blomkvist - 40's - regards the gauntlet of reporters he'll have to pass to get out of the building
As he strides toward them, microphones and cameras swing in his direction
Without stopping - What is this, the media event of the year
1 Don't try to play it down, Mikael, it won't work
Don't try to play it up, that won't either
4A
-  -  -             4A Feeling a bit like he's fleeing the scene of a crime, which in a way he is, Blomkvist steps outside opening his umbrella
couple of the reporters come out after him - 2 Will you appeal
'll appeal to you, Viggo:   Find a real story to cover
He hurries off in the rain
/ Financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist was found guilty today on 16 counts of aggravated libel against financier Hans-Erik Wennerstrom

-  -                                    5 At a table with a pre-made sandwich and cup of coffee, and a long court judgement, Blomkvist watches himself fleeing the reporters on the cafe's
He's the only one there who watches it - no one else is interested - which only makes it worse

In an article published earlier this year, Blomkvist claimed Wennerstrom - founder and president of The Wennerstrom Group - used State funds intended for industrial development in Poland for an arms deal with the right-wing Ustashe in Croatia
The report cuts to a shot of Wennerstrom outside the courthouse in an Armani suit, surrounded by his legal team, confidently addressing the reporters - have nothing against Mr
Blomkvist
He's a good journalist who  don't believe is guided by malice
But what he wrote was inaccurate, and inaccuracies can't go unanswered
He - all journalists - have to accept like the rest of us, actions have consequences
Done with his sandwich, Blomkvist goes to the counter
Marlboro Red
and a lighter

-   -                                6 He comes out tamping the pack
Extracts a cigarette
Tosses the pack in a sidewalk trash bin
Flicks at the lighter but can't get it to fire in the wind and rain
Hunches his body around it, coaxes it to life
/ Blomkvist was ordered to pay 600 thousand  in damages and all court costs, which could be significantly more
He takes a long drag that dizzies him
wonderful feeling
He regards the trash bin
Fishes around it, finds the pack, puts it in his coat pocket

He enters the editor's office

'  -   -             10 Dragan Armansky, 40's, who looks more like a boss of a New Jersey crime family than  of a high-tech security firm, sits behind his desk, waiting with an older client
It's possible we could wait forever
You called her,  thought
You spoke to her
'm afraid that doesn't mean much
don't understand
No one here likes her
So it's better if she works at home
But you told her  wanted to meet her
But 've told her many more times prefer her not to meet clients

/ But you like her
/ Very much
She's one of the best investigators  have
As you saw from her report - 12
'  -   -               12 The report on Armansky's desk is 200 pages long
: Printed on its cover: Mikael Blomkvist, a case number and, smaller, its author, Lisbeth Salander
But
'm concerned you won't like her
She's different
In what way
In every way

-  -   -           13 The black-clad figure - from behind again - strides past coworkers who look away
14
'  -   -               14 / Ms
Salander's here
Armansky breathes a defeated sigh, taps the intercom button twice to say `okay, let her in
' Lisbeth Salander walks in:  small, pale, anorexic- looking waif in her early 20's
Short black-dyed hair - pierced eyelid - tattoo of a wasp on her neck; probably several more under her black leather jacket - black t- shirt, black jeans, black Caterpillar boots
Frode is only middlingly successful in concealing his initial reaction to her
This isn't punk fashion
This is someone saying, Stay the fuck away from me
Lisbeth, Mr
Dirch Frode
How do you do
7
7
She doesn't shake Frode's hand, but does address him: Something wrong with the report
No
It seems quite thorough
There's a wealth of data here
But 'm also interested to know what's not in it
There's nothing not in it
Your opinion of him isn't
'm not paid to give my opinion
So you don't have one
Salander sends Armansky a weary look
His look back begs her not to say anything unpleasant
Eventually - He's clean
In my opinion
He's - excuse me
He's honest
He's who he presents himself to be
In his business, that's an asset
There's less in his asset column after his conviction today
That's true
He made a fool of himself with that
If it happened that way
Frode looks at Armansky
What's that supposed to mean
If he made up the story, that's out of character
So is giving up without a fight
People don't do things that are out of character
Are you saying he was set up
8
8
That wasn't part of my assignment
And, apparently, she has no opinion on it either
You're quite right he made a fool of himself professionally
How big of a fool did he make of himself financially
The judgement will just about empty his savings
This seems to please Frode more than anything else that has been said, and Salander sees it
May  go
Your report is light in another area
His personal life
Anything you chose not to include
Nothing that warranted inclusion
'm not sure if that means yes or no
think what Ms
Salander means, and agree, is that everyone has a right to a certain amount of privacy, even when they're being investigated
Not in this case
have to know if there's anything about him  might find unsavory - even if she doesn't
Armansky's look to her at once apologizes for Frode, and encourages her to speak
She finally relents but puts no more spin on it than any other piece of raw data - He's had a long sexual relationship with his co-editor
It wrecked his marriage, but not hers
Her husband accepts it
Sometimes she sleeps at Blomkvist's, sometimes at home
Frode thinks about that, perhaps imagining how much simpler his own life would be with such an arrangement
9
9
You were right not to include that
know
Anything else
No
Please think before you say no
did
don't want to be surprised by something later
Salander offers nothing more
So
Nothing else
In the personal department
You're sure

She wakes up alone in his bed
Pads to the darkened living room to find him typing on his laptop, a half- eaten sandwich and glass of water next to it
Usually when  wake up in a cold bed, it's at home

It's unlocked
The gift in hand, she pushes it open
She comes into an apartment which looks like it could belong to a professor
Sees a chess piece on the floor
Then a trail of them that lead her to an overturned chess table and, next to it, a body
The gash on the old man's head could have been caused by a fall into the corner of the table, or from a blow to it
She quickly tries to determine if he's breathing
Calls for an ambulance

cell phone rings
No one can tell - as you never can - whose it is, and so all pull them out

Hello

Yes
/ Forgive me for intruding on your Christmas

You know, you're calling at an awkward time
/ 'm sorry
'm about to sit down to Christmas dinner myself
That's not what  mean
/ You're referring to your recent legal trouble
That has provided Mr
Vanger with some entertainment
Excuse me
/ He doesn't care for Wennerstrom either
Frode, in his polite, deliberate way, is reeling Blomkvist in like a perch
Have him call me

Up north

Sorry

And Vanger himself is warm in nature, yet speaks quickly as they come through the house - Thank you for coming way out here
Anna, take Mr
Blomkvist's insufficient coat
Would you like to freshen up
We'll be having dinner later
For now, hot tea is waiting
Unless you'd like a drink instead
What would you like

Blomkvist would like to be on the 4:30 train back to Stockholm

What do you know about me
That you used to run one of the biggest industrial firms in the country
Used to
That's correct
There are framed black and white photographs on a wall - factories and trains figuring into all of them

Doing
Officially, assisting me with my memoirs
But what you'd really be doing is solving a mystery
And you'd do that by doing what you do so well - this recent legal mishap of yours notwithstanding
You'd be investigating thieves, misers, bullies, and malcontents - the most detestable collection of people you'll ever meet

page in the album turns to reveal a photo of a young man in a uniform with a Nazi pin
Isn't it interesting how fascists always steal the word freedom
(Blomkvist checks his watch) The 4:30
Yes
Okay
Anyway, Richard died a martyr to the Nazi cause in 1940 - missed all the real excitement - but not the opportunity to regularly beat his wife Margareta and their son, Gottfried
We see photos of Gottfried, a handsome young man
Now, Gottfried - Harriet's father - was what people used to call a Good- Time-Charlie
They're still called that
Are they
Okay
:   Close on a photo of Gottfried
He was a charmer, a ladies man, a drunk
In other words, a born salesman - which is what he did for the company - traveling around, taking clients out to dinner and so on
Someone has to do it
That's right
Anyway, he died in 1965
Drowned
Drunk

The currents aren't strong here
Anything that falls into the water turns up nearby
Like her father
His body didn't drift more than ten meters when he drowned the year before
Vanger's pauses at a landing to steady himself and his labored breathing
No
Someone killed her, Mr
Blomkvist
Someone on the island that day
Someone close enough to know what she used to give me each year on my birthday
He unlocks the door of the attic and pushes it open to reveal a cluster of nine dusty framed dried flowers on a wall
24

These were from her
And, on another wall, forty similarly-framed flowers - These, from her killer
Blomkvist regards the forty
Who knows about these
Me, the police, the murderer
and now you

Salander approaches from the other direction
Passing, she notes the four number tones the woman keys in the code lock
The door buzzes open and the woman disappears inside
Salander doubles back and keys the same four number tones in the Milton Security lock
47
-  -           47 Opulent foyer
Security camera
Antique elevator cage whose cables pull the woman upstairs
Salander comes to an unlocked service door and takes stairs to a basement machine room
Examines tangles of phone lines, meters, Wi-Fi routers
Photographs them with a digital camera
She climbs the stairs back up to the foyer
The front door buzzes, and a man in a suit on the sidewalk pushes it open, sees her, holds it wide enough for her to pass
The man is a driver/bodyguard
He continues to hold the door for his employer who now emerges from the back of an idling car and crosses to it in the rain

've spent half my life examining the events of a single day
And for all that, he's no closer to the truth
understand your frustration
But what you're asking me to do is a waste of money
We haven't discussed your fee
We don't need to
can't find something you haven't been able to in forty years
You don't know that
You have a very keen investigative mind
Blomkvist wonders why he ever agreed to come here as Vanger refills his wine glass
Here's what  propose: You come stay on the island
have a nice little cottage by the water you can use
You study the material  give you
You find something 've missed - or you don't
You want me to set aside my life and career for something that's a complete waste of time
Think of it as a well deserved vacation
way of avoiding all the people you want to avoid right now
(nothing from Blomkvist) As for compensation, 'll pay you twice your salary for as many months as it takes
'll quadruple it if you solve the mystery
26
26
Mr
(Vanger) - 'm not done
'll throw in one more thing - even though you're a terrible negotiator
It's what you want more than anything else and it can't be bought at any price
'll give it to you
Hans-Erik Wennerstrom
He pushes toward Blomkvist a plate: the carcass of the fresh-killed and cooked duck they've been eating
It and the mention of Wennerstrom's name clouds, at least for a moment, Blomkvist's memory of the train he missed
He began his career working for me
And 've followed it with interest, shall we say, ever since
You were right about him
You just couldn't prove it

Knocks on a door, waits, listens to some dead-bolts unlocking
It opens, but remains impassable by a figure weighing over 300 pounds
He offers her no greeting
Fades back into the shadows of his dark apartment
Would you like to sit
could possibly clear a place if necessary
It's hard to imagine how he or anyone might accomplish that
The place is like a junkyard
Even the unmade bed is covered with stuff
Did you make it
Have you something for me

He counts it and is unimpressed with its total

This isn't enough

It's all have right now
find that so poignant
So much so that he does nothing more than look at her
She reaches to take the money back, but he pockets it and moves across the dark room to a work table where high-end computers fight for space with debris
Finds and gives her a small homemade electronic box, which she turns over in her hands
While it's clear both these people are deficient in behavior that governs polite society, it's hard to tell which lacks it more

second suitcase, presumably full of clothes, sits on the floor
/ You can't be serious - 51A   /
'  -   -     51A He zips the suitcase with the supplies in it closed and gathers the rest
We're in our worst crisis ever and you're writing a memoir
You fired me;  need something to do
You fired you;  need you here, not the North Pole
You know what this is going to look like
Like 've been gutted
Like 'm running away

They cross through the building, he with his cases, she with her coffee cup
28

Wennerstrom wants to see me waving a white flag, not a red one
And the more it looks like there's a problem between you and me, the more it'll satisfy him
There is a problem between us
He won't be satisfied until he shuts us down, and you're leaving me to fight him alone
He kisses her but gets back no more than he would from a statue - and steps outside
It's four hours by train
It's not the North Pole
52
-  -                       52 The depot thermometer reads 0
Blomkvist disembarks with two suitcases
This time, Frode isn't there to meet him
He struggles with his luggage through the snow to a taxi stand
53
-  -                                  53 As a taxi passes a gas station by the bridge, Blomkvist regards the Middle Eastern driver's eyes which regard him in the rear view mirror
Think this snow's going to let up anytime soon
This is the North Pole
54
-   -                        54 The taxi deposits Blomkvist outside a cottage
From here he can see Vanger's manor and couple other houses
The taxi drives off and disappears into the snow

Fireplace
Pile of wood
realtor would call it cozy
In truth it's just tiny and freezing cold
Blomkvist unpacks
Puts clothes in a wardrobe, sets out books, note pads, pens, 's, a  player, his laptop and a small printer
29
29
He flips open his cell phone to make a call
Gets no reception bars
Hears a faint, plaintive cry and traces it to a window, beyond which, on the sill outside, stands a cat peering in
He opens the door, and the cat heads straight for the kitchenette
Then looks at him
What
Milk
He opens the old fridge
No milk
Nothing
56
-                                           56 He comes out into falling snow holding his cell phone out in front of him like a dowser divining ground water
Moves around trying to get a signal
Can't
57
-  -                                57 He purchases milk, butter, a loaf of sliced bread, some packaged lunch meats and a few cans of cat food
58
-                                         58 He walks along the street through wind-whipping snow, cradling the grocery bag, cell out in front of him again
Any of the locals could tell him he could do this forever - there are no cell towers anywhere around here
59
-                                         59 Grocery bag at his feet, he dials a call with fingers he can no longer feel on the gas station pay phone by the end of the bridge
It goes to Erika's voice mail
It's me
'm here
It's fucking cold and 'm on a pay phone
If you tried to call, the reception sucks, and if you tried to email, there's none of that either, so - so - 'm here - and -  can't even speak it's so fucking cold
He hangs up, open the same pack of cigarettes from before
Eighteen in there
Struggles to get one lit in the wind and snow, hurries off toward the bridge
60
-                                         60 As the cat laps at milk on a plate, Blomkvist tries to get a fire going using pages ripped from a book
It's a struggle he's going to lose; he's no Boy Scout

-                                        64 But it's a knock that draws Blomkvist awake
Having forgotten where he is, he regards the cat sleeping with him, then the room, and groans
He pads to the door in the freezing cold
Opens it to find a rugged older man on his doorstep with a handcart loaded with file boxes
'm Gunner
The caretaker
65
-  -                                65 As Gunner expertly builds a fire in the fireplace for him, Blomkvist works at unpacking the boxes - documents, fat police reports, notebooks, folders, photo albums
You're an author
'm writing a biography of Mr
Vanger, yes
Nilsson nods, but isn't sure he believes it
Maybe he took a look inside the boxes before he brought them down
saw you on television
That's unfortunate
Bit of trouble,  guess
Blomkvist nods and hopes that's enough to put an end to the subject
It isn't
No jail time, though
That's good
Cost you a lot of money though, yeah
31
31
Blomkvist shares his annoyance with the cat
Nilsson dusts himself off, satisfied with the fire he's made
There

-                                   66 Vanger has ventured outside to show Blomkvist around the estate
Smoke from chimneys rise into bitter cold grey skies, weather for which Blomkvist, unlike the old man, is inadequately dressed
The island is owned by my family
Your closest neighbor is my brother Harald, another Nazi if you can believe
Two in the family
He's detestable to put it nicely, but you'll probably never see him
He's a recluse
He was there that day
Indeed he was
Vanger's look to Blomkvist adds, `so consider him a suspect
' He indicates another house on the grounds - That's his daughter Cecilia's house
They don't speak
Does anyone speak to anyone on this island
Actually, Isabella - Harriet's mother - who lives there - (points) - she speaks to Harald - which is one of reasons  don't speak to her
(points) Cecilia's brother Birger lives there
Who doesn't he speak to
You, probably
Not that you'd want him to
He can be as unpleasant as Harald
32
32
'm quickly losing track who's who
Oh, how you'll wish were it always so
Soon you'll know us all only too well - with my apologies
(points) Out there is my nephew Martin's house; Harriet's brother
It's a modern house - lots of glass - out on the point
Who speaks to him
speak to him
He runs the company now, as  think  told you
They hear a distant rifle crack and echo
It startles Blomkvist a bit, but not Vanger
Someone shooting their dinner
Gunner probably
The caretaker
just met him
He was 19 when Harriet disappeared
Old enough, Blomkvist gathers, to be considered a suspect
Vanger points off - He lives over there
Shivering in the cold, Blomkvist turns
And you live here
Sorry
Your house
For a moment, Vanger isn't sure what Blomkvist means
Then he is, and is pleased by it
33
33
Yes, you're right
The man who hires the detective should always be kept on the suspects list

On some of the cards is the word, `deceased

Was it planned

Was it about business

She was with some friends that day

She left early

On it, in neat handwriting: Magda 32016 Sara 32109

The first belonged to a woman named Margot, whose mother was Magda, who claimed she didn't know Harriet
The fourth,

The other three were unconnected in any way that could find
He hands the address book back
It, and everything else about the case, clearly trouble him still
've reminded you of things you'd rather forget
'm sorry
can't forget it
It's my Rebecka Case
Blomkvist isn't sure what that means
Every policeman has at least one unsolved case
Back then it was old Torstensson
Year after year he kept returning to one - taking out the files - uselessly studying them
As young men, we had to laugh
Was this also a missing girl case
38
38
No, that's not why  mention it
The Rebecka Case is something that happened before Harriet was born

Poor Torstensson could never solve it, and could never let it go
And neither can poor Morell with his Harriet case

How's Mr
Palmgren doing
was told he had a stroke of some kind
(nothing from Salander) Terrible
It is, but she can tell he couldn't care less
He leafs through her file - What exactly do you do at this security company

But not full-time
Not even part- time consistently
They somehow got along without coffee or mail in July and August
Nothing from her

When's the last time you were late
Never
Do you think that ring in your eyelid makes you attractive
Salander, who's had to suffer insufferable officials all her life, doesn't dignify the question with an answer
Here's the problem
There a discrepancy between the obligation of Mr
Palmgren's guardianship and the management of your finances
It isn't a discrepancy or a problem
It was clear to him  could manage my own finances
But that's not clear to me
'm not a child
No
You're not
(looks at her too long) But you were
And between then and now - (indicating the files) - two years in the locked ward at St
Stephens, for violent aggression - failure to adapt to four foster homes and seven schools - arrested twice for intoxication, twice for narcotics use, and most recently for assault: a bottle smashed into a man's face
You may have conned Mr
Palmgren into thinking you've improved, but looking at this - (the file) - not to mention how you're looking at me now -  can see you haven't

He slugs her
She goes down, but doesn't give up
Catches up with him on the escalator, throws him back down it
The bag slams onto the metal stairs, too, but at least she has it now
She doesn't run
She waits at the top and watches the junkie drag himself up and think about trying again
He wisely decides to let it go, hops to the down-escalator and disappears into the underground station

-                                      84 Blomkvist sifts through a box containing some of Harriet's personal belongings: school papers, textbooks, a Bible, the address book, her wallet and
knock on the door
He puts the box in a closet on top of others, kicks it closed, opens the front door to find a not unattractive woman in her 50's on his porch
Hi
thought 'd come over and say hello
'm Cecilia

-                                          85 Cecilia regards Blomkvist's Vanger family tree on the wall
Wherever he only has an old photo, there's a Post- It next to it that reads: Recent Photo
of Cecilia's photo, taken when she was a teenager, and a Post-It with her name on it
We're all uncomfortable with the idea of a chronicle of our family
45
45
It's not about the family
It's about Henrik and the company
Like  said
It's not my intention to present a malicious portrait of anyone
Unlike the one that landed you in court
Unlike that one
Correct
So, what you're saying is, you're not really here to look into what happened to Harriet
Silence
Then - can't ignore such a dramatic event, but no, that's not by any means my focus
So all those boxes Gunner carted down here - which are where
- in the closet now
- weren't Henrik's private investigation
(Blomkvist can't think fast enough to respond) wonder sometimes who's crazier - my Nazi father or my obsessed uncle
of the photo of Young Harald in his Nazi uniform on the wall
Since we're talking about it, since you brought it up, what was Harriet like
'm sure Henrik has told you
He was my age then, and so couldn't know what was really going on with a teenager any more than  can with my own daughter
You were her age
46
46
Actually, my sister Anita was closer to her in age
of the photo on the wall of Anita, taken when she was about 17 years old
She knew Harriet better than anyone - certainly better than  did
You should talk to her
'd love to, where is she
If  had to guess - London
You don't know where your own sister lives
haven't seen her in years
We never really got along
'm getting used to that comment
That's the way it is when you're always after the same boys
People generally get over that sort of thing at a certain point
Oh, 'm long over it, and won't ever have to worry about it again
She hates this place even more than do
She left, moved to London and that was it
You couldn't pay her to send a Christmas card, much less visit
'll try to track her down for you
Don't bother
For myself then
He smiles
She studies him
Maybe he's not so bad
47

If you do, and try talking to her about us, don't be surprised if she tells you to fuck off

To the event that altered everything in Henrik's life
Harriet
(he nods) Everything  knew about that  told to - whatever his name was - that policeman - when it happened
Morell
My recollections then were a lot better than they are now
'm not speaking of the crime itself
'm trying to get a clearer sense of what Harriet was like
Particularly, toward the end
She was messed up
Like all us Vanger kids
Crazy mother
Drunken father
At least hers wasn't a Nazi like mine
Was he abusive
Mine
Hers

never saw it myself, but you could tell something was going on
One day she'd be withdrawn
The next she'd be putting on makeup and wearing the tightest sweater she had to school
The next she'd be studying a Bible like a nun - no Vanger was ever religious - can you imagine
Obviously, she was very unhappy
She never confided in you what about, specifically
There was no specifically
It was everything
It was being part of that family
Henrik's the only decent person in it
What do you think happened to her
Everyone knows what

Is there a problem

It's so cute when you do that surly thing

He has Harriet's box of belongings out again and looks at photos of her school friends in her wallet
Then picks up the Bible
Handwritten on the inside cover is Harriet Vanger
He opens it at random
Hebrews: / Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen
Through faith we understand that the world was created by the word of God - and that what is seen was not made of things that are visible
He sets it down
Rubs his eyes
Everything - his daughter, his life, this cabin, the word of God - is depressing

They're arranged chronologically, and Vanger has noted the approximate time of day of each
The first several were taken on the manor grounds, by family members of each other
The next couple taken in town of the parade

63
've always admired Henrik Vanger

Pauses on a blurry one of the fire crew, the focus inadvertently on the background - Vanger's manor
What caught his attention is a figure in one of the upstairs windows
He checks a scribbled floor plan of the manor and sees that it's Harriet's bedroom
But he's not sure if it's Harriet
The figure is too soft to identify - even with a magnifying glass - but is wearing a light-colored dress and has light hair
He glances to the family tree on the wall - the teenage Vanger girls' photos - Three :   Harriet
Cecelia
Anita
They all have light hair, and, frankly, all look alike
He moves on to the parade pictures
To the one Vanger said before was the last picture taken of Harriet alive
It's not really of her
64
64
It's a wide shot of the parade itself - but she can be seen in the background across the street with her friends, watching a float - atop which some women in harem outfits dance - pass by
He slips it from its corner-fasteners and turns it over
There's a Hedestad Courier copyright printed on the back
He turns it over again and looks at the photo itself
117
-                                       117 Guided by the photo, he walks along the town's main street to the approximate place from which it was taken - outside a haberdashery window - but it's still not right
The photo was shot from a higher than street level angle
He looks to a second story window above the store
Then crosses the street to where Harriet was standing when the picture was taken
Looks back at the haberdashery where, now, the owner peers out at him
118
-  -                               118 On the pay phone outside the gas station - want to look at what the paper has in its archive on the parade
/ You already have what it has
In the album
don't think so
/ Why
Because no photographer at any newspaper in the world takes just two photos of anything - especially after having to climb a flight of stairs
/ The bridge accident happened during the parade
He rushed over
Maybe
Silence
Then - / Mikael, what have you found

Nothing probably
But  know photographers
They're the most insecure people on earth

The older stuff, still negatives

Thank you

You're too young to know about that
Everyone here grows up knowing about her

Blomkvist scrolls through the Courier negatives he has converted into positives and has loaded into Photoshop
He was right
Many more parade pictures were shot that day
Several at street level - a marching band, floats, children with balloons, some in better focus than others
He reaches the first of the higher-angle shots from the floor above the haberdashery, scans the crowd lining the street
Harriet isn't in it
But in the next she appears at the edge of the frame with her school friends
In the next, she's further into frame
And the next, standing in the same spot he stood earlier today

-                                      125 Blomkvist selects all 18 of the high-angle parade photographs, transfers them to an iPhoto file, and reopens them as a `slide show
' The first few, accompanied by the default music, Minuet in , dissolve at two-second intervals
Too long
Too distracting with the music
And too wide
He adjusts the size function - closer on Harriet gets rid of the dissolve effect and music and reduces the time- interval to make the transitions as quick as possible
He hits `play' again and watches a short jerky `silent film'- a kind of electronic flip-book: Harriet arrives with her friends
Moves along the street
Stops and faces the parade
Says something to her friends
Laughs
Watches the float with the harem girls on it
Smiles
Sees something to her left
Turns her head slightly toward it
Her eyes widen in fear
She looks down
She moves off
Her friends look after her confused
And then she's gone
Blomkvist backs up to the frame of Harriet looking off with fear in her eyes, and for the first time believes without a doubt what Vanger has believed for 40 years: She was murdered
Whoever she saw across the street followed her and killed her
The cat watches him
126
'  -                          126 Bjurman slowly comes to
Good
You're alive
It takes him a moment to realize it's true
Another to realize it might be better if he wasn't since he's naked on the floor, face-up, wrists and ankles bound
He tries to cry out and realizes he's also gagged
She emerges from the shadows, stands over him, and he sees that her eyes are ringed in black mascara like some kind of ghoulish raccoon
She looks insane
As she steps out of his field of view, and his hands struggle against the restraints
Recognize this
He cranes his neck to see she's by her backpack that's resting on a chair
68
68
had it with me last time
set it here
Remember
(he doesn't) See this snap
It's not a snap
It's a wide-angle micro-lens
She takes a - from the backpack, puts it in his player, flips his plasma  on with a remote
She got it all - what he did to her - the rape - in
This shows you sodomizing a mentally impaired girl
If it's ever seen outside this room, who'll be institutionalized then
He starts to whimper
Here's what's going to happen
Pay attention
He can't
He can't even look at her
His life is over
He weeps into the gag
Look at me
He won't
She strides to her backpack
Takes out a large dildo
Gets on her knees, and works it into his ass
She can only get it about halfway up
She has to stand up and kick it the rest of the way with her boot
He howls into the gag
Do  have your attention now
She does indeed
He vigorously nods his head, now, and after everything she says - When you can walk again, which admit could be a while, we're going to my bank
You'll tell them  alone have access to my account
After that, you'll never contact me again
Each month you'll write a report of a meeting we won't have
You'll describe how well 'm doing, how sociable 'm becoming
Then you'll negotiate with the court to have my declaration of incompetence lifted
If you fail, this video will spread across the Internet like a virus
(he stares in horror) () 69

(') If something happens to me - if get hit by a car - if you hit me with a car - same thing, it uploads automatically
She fishes his apartment keys from his trousers
Shows him that she has them
'm taking these with me
'll be checking on you
If  ever find anyone in here with you, whether she came of her own free will or not - His eyes dart to the  as he nods that he understands
No
Not the video
She kicks him
Then straddles his fat gut and looks him in the eye
will kill you
And he knows she means it
Do you doubt anything 've said
(he shakes his head no) Do you doubt what's in the reports about me
What do they say when you sum them up
They say 'm insane
(he shakes his head no) No, it okay
You can nod because it's true
am insane
She gets up off him, rummages through her backpack again
know it'll be hard for you to abide by my rules
Especially no more sex
'm going to make it easier for you
She puts on a plastic surgical mask
He fears the next thing he'll see is a pair of scissors in her hand, but it isn't
It's something else he doesn't recognize
She straddles him again
He squirms under her weight
Lie still
've never done this before
70
70
He sees that the thing in her hand is some kind of surgical device, a shiny stripped-down gun with a sharp point and a plastic ink bottle where the bullets would go
There will be some blood
He struggles to twist his body away, but it's useless
She digs the tattooing gun's needle into his chest and begins dragging it back and forth
He screams as dots of blood spatter her plastic mask

'  -                            127 The job has taken her all night
The sky outside the living room window is beginning to lighten
She drinks a glass of water in the kitchen, wipes her prints from it
She crosses to the bedroom where Bjurman's toys have been wiped cleaned and put back in the dresser
Picks up her backpack
Looks at him
He's unconscious
She sets handcuff key next to a dark stain on his stomach
We stay on the key as she leaves the room
Hearing the front door open and close, we rise up to see his entire naked body on the bed
Tattooed into his skin in big letters, from his nipples to his groin, is: 128    :

-                                  129A Returning from a walk and a smoke, Blomkvist sees - sitting outside the cottage, petting his cat - Harriet
Of course it can't be her, but it is a teenage girl who resembles the old pictures of her
Seeing him, she waves
It's his daughter
Hi
Hi
What are you doing here
On my way to Skelleftea
can only stay a couple hours
He arrives and gives her a hug
71
71
What's in Skelleftea
Light of Life Bible Camp
Blomkvist tries to hide his dismay
129B
-                                       129B He's made them some coffee, and, of course, sandwiches
Patiently waits for her to finish her silent prayer, and smiles bravely
They're not dangerous
It's fine, Nilla
Whatever you want to do is fine
Everybody needs something
Just so long as it's not God
didn't say that
As they eat in silence, Blomkvist can't help but think about Harriet and what Vanger said about not giving her his attention when she needed it
'm not around enough to know everything that's going on with you, and  apologize for that
But 'd never want you to not tell me something, even if you think  might not want to hear it
(smiles) That's what 'm doing
129C
-  -                      129C The afternoon train is boarding
It's not crowded
It should have been me visiting you
'm sorry
It's okay
Everything's good
72
72
He nods but doesn't believe it any more than she believes he's okay with Bible Camp
She climbs aboard
Waves
Bye
Bye
The train begins to move
Don't go too hard on the Catholics
What
The article you're writing
What are you talking (about) - The Bible quotes on your desk
What
The train clears the platform
He watches after it
What was she talking about
He glances absently to the taxi stand
Hussein points to his taxi

-  -                               130 Blomkvist comes in, goes straight to his desk, sifts through the paperwork on it, then sees the Xerox of the last page of Harriet's address book - the unknown phone numbers - he taped to the lamp - Magda 32016 Sara 32109
30114
32027 Mari 32018 It could be a coincidence they're Bible names - Magdalene, Sarah, Mary - or maybe not
He digs through Harriet's personal things for her Bible
Since all the number sequences begin with `3,' he goes to the third chapter - Leviticus - notices that its first facing page is faintly dog-eared - finds
's verse - 1:14 - on it: / If a dove is the sinner's offering, the priest shall wring off its head, cleave its wings, and burn it upon the altar

131
-                                          131 Pinching a cigarette in a shaking hand, Blomkvist pokes numbers on his cell phone
Instead of ringing he hears a beep
"Retry
" appears on the cell screen
132
-                                         132 Back across the bridge by the gas station, he makes the call on the pay phone
Detective Morell, it's Mikael Blomkvist
/ How are you
Not still in Hedestad hope for your sake
The Rebecka Case you mentioned
What was her last name if you recall
/ Of course  do, but what would it have to do with anything
Nothing probably
As Blomkvist glances to the last page in Harriet's address book, to
30114 - / Jacobsson
Rebecka Jacobsson
How was she killed
/ Decapitated
Arms cut off
Burned
Like the Leviticus dove
siren
Ambulance coming past, headed for the bridge
/ But this happened in the 1940's - Hang on a second
He watches the ambulance speed across the bridge
74
74
'm going to call you back
/ What have you (found) - Blomkvist hangs up and takes off at a trot toward the bridge - 133
-                                  133 He reaches the manor just as the ambulance is leaving and Martin is climbing into his Range Rover
He looks undone
What's happened
We were talking
He started rubbing at his arm
Then collapsed
Is he (conscious) - can't talk, Mikael,  have to (go) - Go
Martin pulls out to follow the ambulance to the hospital
Blomkvist watches after them
134
-                                     134 The cat naps while Blomkvist looks up the other Leviticus quotes from Harriet's list in her dog-eared Bible - / The daughter of any priest who profanes herself by playing the harlot, profanes her father, and shall be burned with fire - / woman who is a medium or sorcerer shall be put to death by stoning - There's a knock
He tucks the list in the Bible, sets aside and answers the door
Frode comes in
The good news is he survived
How he does now, we have to see
He's in Can  have one of those
75
75
He points to the table
sandwich
Scotch
Blomkvist pours him one, and another for himself
don't want to be indelicate
But Henrik promised me something when agreed to do this
Wennerstrom
(nods) need to know what he has on him
Now
In case
In case he dies
That is indelicate
And  apologize
don't know what he has on him, if you're asking me
And he can't tell you in the condition he's in
So
is that it then
Silence
Blomkvist drinks
Eventually - We also never discussed who 'd report to if something happened to him
You'd report to me, but does it matter
We both know nothing's going to come of this
'm not so sure
Frode looks at Blomkvist a little more intently
What do you mean
76
76
may have found something
(pause) You're joking
(Blomkvist isn't) What did you find
Now it's Blomkvist who studies Frode
He's not sure he wants to tell him
And even less so the longer he looks
The last time  reported something before  was sure of it, it cost me my savings
Frode studies him again - wondering perhaps if Blomkvist suspects him
need a research assistant
Can you authorize that
Yes
Do you have one
can find one
know a good one
She did the background check on you
The
Do you think we'd hire anyone for something like this without doing one
Blomkvist's brain tries to quickly inventory his life, pausing at its darker recesses
Frode nods
Yes, it was quite thorough
want to read it
That  couldn't authorize
77
77
Blomkvist isn't sure how to play this
Then he is
Sets his napkin down, gets up and begins taking things down from the wall
Frode watches
Then sighs

Mr
Frode was kind enough to share your report with me
(it rests on his lap) The investigator's name is on it, but  can find no record of her, and 'm pretty good at that sort of thing
Would it really matter what her name is
It would if  wanted to speak to her, which  do
Against policy
You sure
Just like your sources
You understand
Let me give you a name then
He jots "Annika Giannini" on one of Armansky's Post-Its
My sister
She's a lawyer
(gestures to the report) There's information in here that could only have come from one place
think you know what  mean
Silence
Armansky tries not to look sick
Then - 78
78
The reason you can find no record of her is because her records have been sealed
She's a ward of the State
What does that have to do with anything
She's had a rough life
Can we not make it rougher on her
Blomkvist just sits there, the picture of calm
137
-  -                          137 Cacophony of loud techno and a fringe clientele
Alone at a table drinking, Salander seems comfortable with the noise and her dateless status, but doesn't avoid a glance from an Asian girl at the bar, and doesn't tell her to go away when she comes over and motions to the empty chair
138
'  -                        138 Salander and the girl from the club, asleep in bed, entwined like snakes
Salander wakes, disentangles herself, and is padding to the bathroom when there's a knock on her door
She stares it
No one ever knocks on her door
But someone knocks on it again
She crosses to it, wrapping herself in a blanket
Who is it
/ Mikael Blomkvist
Her mind races, as Blomkvist's did to the news someone had invaded his privacy
She unlocks the door
Cracks it enough to see him
He smiles, but it's disconcerting
She's not sure it's a harmless one
May  come in
Actually 'm not really up (yet) - That's okay
79
79
He pushes the door enough to pass
Has a paper bag and satchel with him
Takes in the place, including the girl in the bedroom, in a glance as he heads for the kitchen
assumed you wouldn't have had breakfast yet so  brought some bagel sandwiches
And tomato juice
Good for hangovers
Where do you keep the coffee
Hey
Hey - (he stops; looks back) Who do you think you are
'm the guy you know better than my closest friends do
He opens cabinets looking for the coffee
She stares
We have a lot to talk about, so why don't you take a shower, put on some clothes and get rid of your girlfriend
139
'  -                              139 Blomkvist, plunging a French press, watches as the girlfriend lets herself out
In the bedroom, Salander finishes getting dressed, sticks her Taser in the back pocket of her jeans and comes out to find a table setting that's more formal than she, or anyone who lives alone, is used to
You're awake
Good
Breakfast is ready
He pours her, and then himself, coffee
guess  alarmed you showing up like this
If you touch me, 'll more than alarm you
That won't be necessary
He smiles
His eyes are not unkind
As he helps himself to one of the bagels - 80
80
Your report on me was quite detailed but for me not very entertaining
copy of it sits next to his plate
It wasn't meant to be
When  write about people,  try to entertain the reader
Wennerstrom wasn't entertained
Blomkvist lets it go
Your boss Armansky tells me you only work on things that interest you
guess  should be flattered
He also says you're the one he goes to for jobs that are, `sensitive' is the word he used
'll use `illegal,' since that what it was when you hacked into my computer
(they study each other) 'm not going to do anything about that
could but  won't
What 'm going to do is tell you a story
If it entertains you, maybe you'll decide to help me research it further
If it doesn't, 'll wash the dishes and leave
Are you going to even touch your food
What kind of research
Lisbeth - may  call you Lisbeth want you to help me catch a killer of women
140
'  -  -                   140 He's arranged some of his research on the floor, and watches Salander kneeling before it, her eyes passing over photographs of the Vanger clan, the accident on the bridge, Xeroxes of the Leviticus list and verses
've identified
Her name's Rebecka Jacobsson

(') have no idea who the others are - or how they're connected to the death of a 16 year old girl - but they have to be
His eyes settle on her blue-black "handcuffs" as hers settle on a copy of an old Hedestad Courier front page: the article about the grisly murder of Rebecka Jacobsson
We need to somehow figure out who they are, what happened to them, what the Leviticus verses have to do with (anything) - She gets up, goes to her desk, begins jotting something down, ignoring him
What are you doing
Getting started
You can keep talking if you want
Blomkvist, slightly taken aback, picks up the Leviticus Xerox from the floor
Would you like this
Got it
That's what she's jotting down, from memory: the names, initials and Leviticus numbers
She wakes her laptop - 141

He stares at it
Then at the door he just came through
Then the windows: all shut

No one's asked me about Magda in over 40 years
No one here even remembers her
He waits for her to say something, but she doesn't seem to understand conversational dynamics, so it's up to him
Why would a young lady like you want to know about such a brutal killing
It interests me
Does it
She nods
He's not sure which he finds stranger - her appearance or her sincerity
He touches his own neck to indicate the tattoo on hers
What's that
wasp
friend of mine calls me that
So you tattoo it on your neck
He'd be horrified if one of his grandchildren did that, but she just shrugs like it's no big deal
Who's this friend

Her husband was our first suspect - the husband is always the first suspect, and usually the last - but not this time
We moved on to a neighbor
Then a vagrant - He pulls a thick, yellowed folder out and sits with it and her at a table
Once you   get to strangers, it's only a matter   of time before you get to gypsies,   and you know you're never going to   solve it
And that troubles him still, that he never solved it
How exactly was she killed

(to Frode) How is he
Frode takes Blomkvist aside
He needs surgery and there's no
So it's up to the family to decide to resuscitate or not, and they're not good at decisions
He glances over to them
Isabella's staring back
How'd it go with Ms
Salander
She said yes
Isabella gets up to come over - (to Frode) Can  see Henrik
He was asleep when  last looked in
We can check
86
86
No, you can't check
You can instruct him to pack his things and leave
Mother - Don't use that tone with me
(to Blomkvist) This family's had enough tragedy without you dredging it all up again
Actually, Isabella, Mr
Blomkvist works for Henrik
And who do you work for, Dirch
Remind me who pays your salary
We should put this to a vote
Don't be an idiot, Birger
It's a family decision like any other
Cecilia
What
Am  right
You are so seldom right about anything, it's hard for me to say yes
But (yes) - No
We should do what Henrik wants, and we know what he wants
Henrik - is in there fighting for his life
This - (points to Blomkvist like he's an object) - is the last thing he needs
nurse chooses this - the absolute worst time - to approach Isabella
87

/ Excuse me, Mrs
Vanger, you can't smoke in here
Isabella gives the nurse a look so hard it's almost frightening - calmly flicks an ash on the floor - waits for the nurse to leave - and looks back at Blomkvist

She begins flipping through the reports and crime photos inside it, but we don't see them
Can  make copies
can make them for you if our machine's been repaired

(') Please accept my apology for my mother's behavior
It's all right
It's not all right, she's unbearable
But it has nothing to do with you
It's between her and Henrik
She lost it when my father died
The drinking - her state of mind - it all got so bad Henrik took me and my sister away from her, leaving her alone in our old house on the other side of the island like she was excommunicated
She's never forgiven him
And he seems as lost now as he must have been then
You have to stay and keep working
You're Henrik's last chance at some kind of resolution
Put this to rest for him one way of the other, and 'll try to keep my mother away
But, please, do it as quickly as you can
'll (try) - They glance off to the sound of a motorcycle
It appears, roars up, parks
Salander climbs off it and shoulders a duffel bag
Blomkvist seems surprised to see her
Lisbeth, this is Martin Vanger
How do you do
Fine
She comes past them without another word
Martin can't help noticing her wasp and handcuff tattoos
Looks after her as she disappears into the cottage

What's she doing, moving in
Any trouble finding the place
Everyone in town knows who and where you are

Are you hungry
Want a sandwich

She hands him her own dog-eared Bible and a copy of the list of names and initials he gave her - The five cases from Harriet's list

Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 (reading from it) "If a man lies with a woman having her sickness, he has made naked her fountain and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood
" Blomkvist doesn't see a connection
She was raped and stabbed, but the cause of death was suffocation with a sanitary napkin
Rakel Lunde, 1957 - Salander brings up more crime photos - Cleaning woman and part-time palm reader, tied up with a clothesline, gagged, raped, head crushed with a rock

Raped, strangled, a burnt pigeon tied around her neck
Lena Andersson, 1967, a student
Raped, stabbed, decapitated - Okay - 'm not done - It's all right, we're looking for a serial murderer
But what does it have to do with a 16-year-old girl on an island
Salander, as we know, is not paid to give her opinion
She's a hunter/gatherer, not an analyst
But Blomkvist asked, so she gives it - She was looking for him, too

In some of them, Erika is with him
In all of them, he's wearing a leather jacket not unlike Salander's

He's just woken up in a tangle of blankets on the couch to see her at his laptop
She closes the album, leaving on the screen what she was looking at before: his iMovie of the parade and some annotated police files
Going over your notes
They're encrypted
She gives him a don't-be-a-child look

Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 It's amazing what you figured out from the parade photos
Thank you
Too bad you don't have hers

Points to a young couple standing among the people behind her
The woman has an Instamatic camera in her hand
Her
She advances to the next frame:    The woman has raised the camera to her eye
And the next: Harriet turning her head in foreground while in the background the flash cube atop the woman's Instamatic flares slightly
Blomkvist is stunned, by both the fact he didn't notice it before, and what it means: Though the woman is taking a snapshot of the parade, she could have inadvertently included in it whatever - whoever - Harriet saw at that moment across the street
Excuse me
He takes over his laptop from her, finds the later Courier photos he didn't include in his iMovie, after Harriet has left
In one, the couple is moving off the other way
In another, they're getting in a parked car to leave
He sharpens the Photoshop contrast
The rear license plate is partly visible, but too small for him to make out even by squinting
Can you read that

He focuses on a decal on the car's back window

Too small to read
He gets up
Heads for the front door to smoke his cigarette outside - () 'm going to have to go to Norsjo
He opens the door to leave and sees on the porch - The charred corpse of the cat
Its legs - sawn off and arranged in the shape of a swastika - lie in the middle of a dark circle of blood
He seems too startled to move, but when Salander sees it, she immediately gets her camera and begins framing close-ups of the cat parts, and its head resting atop the seat of her motorcycle

He shows her one of the photos
Oh, my goodness, there we are
Who took this
Photographer at the local paper
She smiles at the picture; it brings back good memories
You were taking pictures, too
Which 'd very much like to see if by some miracle you still have them
It wouldn't be a miracle
We were on our honeymoon
But why
Blomkvist thinks about making something up
Decides not to
Indicates Harriet in the photo - This girl was killed that day, soon after seeing something across the street that frightened her
How awful

Blomkvist nods; Mildred takes a closer look at the photo
She does look terrified
Mildred gets up with purpose, goes into another room, returns with a photo album
Leafs past wedding photos, to honeymoon photos and stops on the only one she took of the parade

:   The watch repair shop clock that reads, 2:00
:    figure standing slightly apart from the other people
It's too blurry to make out his face or age, but he has light brown hair, dark slacks, and a dark blazer with some kind of patch on the pocket

In the other, the old wreck she's become
He glances to her husband Gottfried's photo
Where a second more current photo of him should go is a Courier article about his drowning in 1965

187
-  -                         187 No electricity but enough light spills through the open door for him to see the neglected, shadowy interior: Beds with bare, or no, mattresses
Sticks of furniture
Old water-stained books strewn around
Beer bottles and other debris left by intrepid Hedestad teenagers
It's creepy, even if you weren't alone in it, knowing what you know
He kneels to look at some of the books
Mickey Spillane, a bird guidebook, something called The Evil Empire about the , a children's book
He opens this last one and sees "Harriet" scrawled in a very young child's hand
188
-                         188 Having climbed the cliff above the cabin, he finds himself at the highest point on the island
Stops to rest at the ruins of a fort
piece of the stone wall next to his head suddenly erupts
As fragments tear into his scalp, he hears the delayed crack and echo of the rifle shot - He throws himself to the ground
Crawls desperately around and behind the ruins
Sees his shirt is bloody but can't feel a wound under it
Touches his face and finds the blood is coming from his forehead
He can see no one, and is almost relieved since if he could it would mean they were walking toward him, which would mean he would soon be shot dead, point blank
He has to get out of here before that happens
Behind him - the rocky cliff he just climbed
Ahead of him - a clearing leading to woods
Really only one choice - He runs for the trees
Dives through a curtain of thicket and stinging nettles that tear at his arms and hands
Crawls the rest of the way to the woods on his elbows and toes like an infantryman
Safe for the moment, he figures, hidden in the woods, he looks at the sun low in the sky, and decides to wait

-                                       192 She turns the bathtub's hot water tap - Is it still bleeding
(touches the wound) It's still bleeding
why is it still bleeding
She pulls a length of dental floss from its case - () Is that dental floss
Yes
Splits it in two thinner lengths with her chewed finger nails - Feeds one of the lengths of floss through the eye of a needle - What is that - (he can see it's a needle) Is that necessary
105
105
Yes
We can't just tape it
No
She perches on the edge of the tub where he sits - still in his pants - half-submerged in tepid water - bottle of vodka in his hand
Did you sterilize that
No
You didn't
She splashes some of the vodka on the needle
Most of it goes in the water
Hands the bottle back to him
Drink some more
He takes a swig from the vodka bottle
She reaches to his face with the needle and floss - Careful, it's my eye
Don't move
It takes all he's got not to move, and even that isn't enough as she first sticks the needle through the flesh
He pulls away with a groan
She just looks at him
Waits for him to take another swig of vodka to steel himself
She pierces him a second time, draws the floss through the skin
And after that it doesn't seem to be so bad
As she works, his eyes glance to hers with a mixture of dread and gratitude, but hers are focused on the work
Hers then briefly glance to his, but now his are down

Sees her own reflection in the glass and studies it
Then kicks her boots off
193

He's still muttering without looking at her
It wasn't an accident
Somebody was shooting at me
It's insane
these people are insane
No one's shooting at you now
She pulls her t-shirt over his stitched-up head, cocooning it against her breasts
Silence
Then - 'm pretty sure this isn't a good idea
Why
He extracts his head from the cocoon and looks at her
Apart from the fact that 'm old, we work together
You work with what's-her-name
That's worked out for you

That's true

Eventually - You want me to open a window

Hands it back

Do you want to stop

What  don't have are Vanger Industries records

Blomkvist doesn't say
Only - Will you authorize it
could but why on earth would
Because 'm asking

This is what need
That's not what he meant
Let's ask him

He's not well enough to ask
'd be happy to sign a nondisclosure statement, if that helps you
Excuse us a moment

think Henrik would say yes
That's why he has me
To protect him from himself
This is insane
What do we have to hide
Over the course of 120 years of doing business
Plenty
If he needs this to do his job, he should have permission
This goes against every privileged, confidential bone in the lawyer's body

One of the figures has something in his hand he hadn't noticed before
It and the figure are somewhat blurred in movement - but it looks like a gun
He sharpens the contrast to reveal that the gun is in fact a Hasselblad-type camera
Looks at the man's face - then at his wall of Vanger family photos - unhappy to see it matches Harald
200
-  -                       200 Carbon-copied or original documents from the 50's and 60's surround Salander like the water around the island: Financial analyses, annual reports, internal memoranda, trade union agreements, brittle news clippings, corporate staff photographs, one of which she's regarding now: much younger Frode, posing against a wall of law books
200A
-                                        200A The photo of Harald in his Nazi uniform on the wall
/ Your father was taking pictures that day no one has seen
201
'  -                                 201 Cecilia looks at the blurred bridge photo of Harald with the camera in his hand
Then at Blomkvist, coolly
'd like to if  could
So ask him
was wondering if you could do that
don't speak to him, as you know
You couldn't make an exception in my case
He gives her his most disarming smile
It usually works with women, but doesn't seem to have much affect on her
111
111
Are you afraid to be in the same room with him
'm not saying you shouldn't be
You won't help me
Sorry
202
-                             202 Salander gets up and crosses to an anteroom where an unhappy older woman - the archive manager - seems to be doing nothing but waiting for the strange girl to leave
Are you finished
No
need to know where all the factories, offices and projects were from 1949 to 1966
You already have everything
don't
Nothing on subsidiary corporations, partnerships, or suppliers
Then you'll have to do without
Mr
Frode said  have access to whatever  need, and  need this
He said you have access to this floor
Call him
The woman stares at her for a long moment, then picks up the phone
203
-                                      203 Stairs lead them to a higher floor
The woman climbs a step-stool
Pulls a couple of large binders from a high shelf
Salander doesn't help her off the stool and the woman looks at her even more unhappily than before
112
112
204
'  -                                     204 The blinds, as usual, closed
Couple of lamps throw shadows on the walls which display hunting and military trophies - wild game heads, sabers and vintage firearms - some of Harald's dearer photographs - some photographs in dusty frames
Blomkvist, alone in the room, looks at them:     Swedish Nazi leader in the 1930's
Sven Olof Lindholm
The 92-year-old comes into the room from the kitchen, followed by a housekeeper with a tea tray
Indicates the younger man in the photo, also in a Nazi uniform, that Blomkvist is looking at
Me
Blomkvist nods
Has no idea what to say
But Harald waits for more of a response
Finally - Handsome
(taps another) Birger Furugard
Me
(and another) Per Engdahl
(and another) Me
Blomkvist's eyes shift to a bolt-action Mauser infantry rifle displayed on a shelf
But your interest is in my more candid photographic work
205
-                                         205 Spread out on the desk:  map of Sweden showing the factory sites and other Vanger holdings - and one she made earlier where the nine women were murdered
Dots appear at the same locations on both
On a handwritten list of the victims, she puts a check next to Rebecka Jacobsson, 1949, Hedestad - moves on to Mari Holmberg, 1954, Kalmar - begins sifting through the mountain of Vanger Industries clippings from that year - 113

206
'  -                                    206 bony Nazi pouring tea in a shadowy room with you is bad, but the rabbit-print tea cozy only makes it worse
Blomkvist tries to ignore him settling back in his worn leather chair with his chipped cup, and sifts through an old shoebox of unsorted photographs: holiday at Lake Como, early 1950's judging from the cars; a Vanger family gathering long ago; some men posing by a slain wild boar dangling from a rope
Harald holds out a pack of cigarettes
Blomkvist comes over, pulls one out
Blom
kvist
(lights the cigarette) With an `o' - or a `u
' `o
' An `o
'   Blom - kvist
Harald doesn't say it, but his nod means, `not Jewish then
Good' Blomkvist returns to the photos, glancing up occasionally to the smoke curling up past Harald's face as he examines the journalist at work
'm not a recluse
don't close my door to anyone
They just don't visit
Perhaps if you redecorated
Hide the past like they do
Under a thin, shiny veneer
Like an Ikea table
(Blomkvist shrugs) 'm the most honest of all of them
The family
Sweden
Blomkvist opens another shoebox
Lying on top is a photograph of the bridge accident, and, under it, a few more
He takes them out and angles them toward a lamp
114
114
Two point eight
Pardon me
The Zeiss Tessar on my Hasselblad
Excellent lens
Blomkvist tries to nod appreciatively, but the bridge photos don't tell him anything he doesn't already know
He finds several more that appear to be a hunting expedition - men and blood hounds - but then sees Morell in one, more policemen, and a stricken Henrik in boots and raincoat, and realizes this is the search party
Off to the side, a young man, head turned half away, wearing a dark blazer with a gold patch, which that 2
8 Zeiss lens makes clear is a prep school insignia
lion
Landscape
Some nice landscapes there
No, it's -  can't tell who it is from this angle
He takes the photo over to the Nazi who only has to glance at it a moment to recognize his late nephew's son: That's Gottfried's boy
Martin
Harald nods, hands it back, smokes
It's not unusual Martin would have joined the search party - it would be unusual if he hadn't - it's his sister that's missing - but this blazer he's wearing troubles Blomkvist - Handsome but useless young man, Martin
Like his father
207
-                                      207 The archive manager shoulders her purse, locks her anteroom, and approaches Salander
We're closing
115
115
(without looking up) Nowhere near finished
'm not staying late
am
And  need access to all the rooms, including any that are locked
(nothing from the woman) Call Frode
208
-                                      208 As Henrik naps and Martin clears his dinner tray, Frode listens to the caller on the room phone - / She wants to look at everything don't like her and  don't trust her
There's something wrong with her
Hang on a second - (to Martin) 'm going to let you decide
It's Ms
Lindgren again
(takes the phone) Yes, Ingrid, what's the problem
/ This girl wants a set of keys now
To my room as well
It's outrageous
It's fine
Just tell her to make sure to leave the keys with security when she's done
209
-                                      209 Having found nothing of interest in the 1954 files, Salander moves on to the 1957 killing of Rakel Lunde
The older woman comes back
Drops a set of keys on the desk
Stay all night if you want
Leave the keys with the guard
The woman leaves
Her footsteps echo and fade
Salander reads a yellowed clipping from a Landskrona newspaper: 116
116
It's about Vanger Industries hiring a local contractor, Carlen Construction, to build a plant
Gottfried Vanger - here to sign the contract
But all that really interests Salander is the date
The article was published one day after the paper printed the story of the discovery of Rakel's battered naked body
Salander flips through the handwritten notes she made during her talk with the retired detective in Landskrona - and finds that part-time palm reader Rakel's main job was as a cleaning woman for Carlen Construction
The detective interviewed her co-workers, but no one from Vanger Industries, including that firm's representative in town for a few days, Gottfried Vanger
Gottfried Vanger
which one was he again
Salander brings up on her laptop photographs she took of the wall of the cottage: the Vanger family tree
Gottfried Vanger, Son of Margareta & Richard the Nazi Husband of crazy Isabella, Father of Martin and Harriet Of all the Vangers - at least back in 1950 when Harriet was born - Gottfried was the most handsome
Clark Gable good looks
She puts a check next to Rakel's name and returns to Mari Holmberg and the 1954 Vanger files
210
-                                      210 Blomkvist flips through one of Morell's reports stating everyone's whereabouts on the day Harriet's disappeared
: Across from Martin Vanger's name it reads: "Arrived on 4:30 train
" He brings up the Photoshop-enhanced Brannlund parade photo on his laptop - : The figure with the blazer and pocket patch standing near the watch repair clock, which reads: 2:00
And the photo Harald let him take with him of `Gottfried's useless boy' - : Young Martin with the search party, the emblem clearly visible on his blazer pccket
He shuffles through copies of articles in Salander's victims' files
Looks at the last one, Lena Andersson, 1967
The photo is a school wallet photo - 117
117
: She's wearing a sweater with the same Uppsala Prep School lion emblem as Martin
He looks at Mildred's parade photo of the figure standing near the watch repair clock
It reads, 2:00
And the photo Harald let him take with him of `Gottfried's useless boy' with the search party
In it and the parade photo, he's wearing the same blazer
He shuffles through copies of articles in Salander's victims' files
Looks at the last one, Lena Andersson, 1967
The photo is a school wallet photo - in a sweater with the same Uppsala Prep School lion emblem as Martin
211
-                              211 Knowing what she's looking for now, Salander finds it fairly quickly:  clipping about a timber company Vanger Industries bought in Kalmar and an interview in its local paper with Gottfried, two days after Mari's murder
She jumps to 1960 - Magda Lovisa Sjoberg - Karlstad - and an article in its local paper - this time with a photo of Gottfried - about a union dispute at its factory there
212
-                                      212 Blomkvist comes out with his cell phone, tries to make a bar or two materialize on it
Dials but only gets a beep that asks him if he wants to `retry
' He doesn't
Instead, under the darkening sky, he looks off to the point
Martin's house is small in the distance, but he can see there's no car in the driveway and no lights on
He stares at it for a long time
213
-                              213 Salander pulls a 1962 Uddevalla paper from the files
Same day this time, the same page of the newspaper: Lea Persson's horrific murder and an story quoting Gottfried about an expansion project to the town's harbor
She regards Gottfried's newsprint photo: His face looks more than 8 years older than the one in Kalmar but that's what drinking to excess, and murder perhaps, does to you
214
-                                      214 Blomkvist lays the Lena Andersson article - and the photograph of the figure at the parade - atop the rest of the junk on the desk - and quickly scrolls through photos on his laptop, leaving on the screen for Salander to see when she returns: Martin's recent Vanger Industries portrait
118
118
215
-                                      215 Salander has hit a snag
Gets up
We stay to have a look at the problem she leaves: the victims list - now with "Gottfried" jotted down next to all but one name: 1967 - Lena Andersson - Uppsala Next to it, the newspaper article about the murdered girl, with a school photo
And, next to that, the reason there's no "Gottfried" notation: his obituary in a Hedestad Courier clipping: 1965
We listen to the fading echo of Salander's footsteps - 216
-   -                          216 As annoying as the older woman was, it was less creepy with her around
Salander is alone in the old building now, wandering through it looking for vending machines
She finds some
Drops coins in one
cup fills with coffee
She gets a candy bar from another
The coffee machine finishes
The place again plunges into silence
She starts back with her snack down a hallway - 217
-                                 217 Trying to look like he's just out for a stroll, Blomkvist walks past Martin's dark house, then turns around, walks up the front path to the porch and makes a show of knocking on the door, just in case anyone on the island can see him, which is doubtful in this darkness
He tries the door
Locked
Comes down off the porch as if leaving, but then veers off the path and walks around to the side of the house
He peers through a floor-to-ceiling window, but can't see much inside
Comes around to the back and looks in another window
Tries the back door
Unlocked
218
'  -                           218 He can't see a lot in the dark, but doesn't dare switch on any lights
He crosses through the kitchen, but we stay behind to regard a closed basement door
We pick him up again as he comes into the living room, follow him to a wall of glass
It's pitch black outside
We follow him down a hallway - but stop at a bedroom doorway as if this is as far as we care to go
We stay at the threshold and watch him go in and look around
As he begins rummaging around the recesses of a closet - 119

218B
'  -                              218B Blomkvist comes back to the wall of glass
Still no lights out there
Heads off to the hall again
218C
-                               218C The car parks fifty yards from Blomkvist's cottage
The headlights blink off
Someone climbs out
218D
'  -                              218D Blomkvist comes into a study
Lots of books and framed photographs
He begins looking around
218E
-                               218E The headlights come up the road leading to the point
218F
'  -                              218F Blomkvist approaches a gun case in the study
Hunting rifles
Three of them - and an empty space for a fourth one
The trees outside the study window flare with light moment later, Blomkvist hears a sound of tires on gravel
Martin is back, and Blomkvist is in his house
We rush back down the hall with Blomkvist
Hopefully Martin will enter through the front door because we're going to try to get out the back one - Blomkvist trips over something in the dark and we go down with him
Then up again - through the kitchen - past the basement door - grabs a knife from a drawer - shoves it in a back pocket - hurries out the rear door - 219
'  -                          219 Blomkvist tries to steady his breathing as he slinks around the side of the house
As he passes a window, it lights up - and we again hit the ground with him
He hurries across the yard, trips over something in the dark - a sprinkler
- and goes down again into wet muck
He gets up and starts down the road as if returning from a leisurely evening walk - which would be more convincing without the limp - not daring to look back as he goes
120
120
/ Hello
Mikael
Blomkvist stops
His heart pounds
Martin comes down his porch and walks toward his car
Your evening stroll
Hi
How are you
Martin pulls a golf bag from his trunk and shoulders it
stopped at the hospital on my way home
Henrik asked me to ask you something
What
Come on in, 'll make you a drink
Naturally, this is the last thing Blomkvist wants to do, but it would be more suspicious if he refuses
He heads back to Martin's house, trying not to limp
220
-                                        220 Finished with her candy bar and coffee, Salander opens the 1967 files, looks through the clippings for anything of note in Uppsala, where Lena was killed
She finds no news of factories opening there that year, but she does come across a  newsletter about a winter retreat for fifty employees and their families
There's a photo of Henrik presenting someone with a Best Worker of the Year plaque
And another taken at a dinner for twenty guests and Vanger family members: The camera has captured Henrik presiding at the head of the table, putting on a brave face, raising a champagne flute - as everyone else does the same - except for the young man at the far right foreground
He looks sullen
But what teenager wouldn't at an event as boring as this
Salander would look even more sullen
She checks the caption and reads: far right, Martin Vanger (19), currently studying in Uppsala
121
121
Uppsala
Same place as Lena - though it's what young Martin is wearing that strikes her: an Uppsala private school blazer with a lion on its pocket - the same as on Lena Andersson's sweater in the photo of her in the article about her murder
221
'  -                               221 It's not as eerie with the lights on - except for the fact there's a killer in it
Martin sets the golf clubs down and begins emptying a grocery bag in the kitchen
What happened to you
When
Now
Blomkvist's clothes
The fresh mud stains
fell in the dark
You don't have a flashlight
'll give you one
just wasn't being careful
Martin smiles, but Blomkvist isn't sure what he said warrants one
Martin begins rummaging through a drawer for a flashlight
The knife block - with one missing - is right there
How's the investigation
Nothing new to report
Blomkvist notices a drop of blood from his pantleg on the stone floor and covers it up with his shoe
Martin, not seeming to notice, finds a mini-Maglite in the drawer
Dirch says Ms
Salander is clever
Maybe she'll turn something up
Maybe
122
122
Martin hands Blomkvist the mini-Maglite
Thanks
222
-                                      222 Salander scrolls through laptop photos to the one at the parade taken by the Brannlund woman on her honeymoon; the people across the street and the blurry figure wearing the blazer with the "pocket square"
Hello, Martin
223
'  -                              223 Martin pours Scotch
Hands one to Blomkvist
What did he say
What
You said Henrik asked you to ask me something
just did
What
How the investigation's going
That was his question
Oh
Blomkvist's eyes only dart to a rifle bag leaning against the wall next to a box of shells, but Martin follows them
You hunt
We should go hunting together sometime
Sure
They drink
Listen to a silence
123
123
Nothing at all
(Blomkvist doesn't know what he means) New
To report
No
Martin regards Blomkvist in another silence
Then - can see you're anxious
No
To get home
After your walk
suppose  am
To have dinner
With your girlfriend
My assistant
Yes
We'll have better luck with a gun
Sorry
When we go hunting
Martin pulls open a bar drawer and takes from it a handgun
gun
Rather than a knife
He gives a little gesture with it to the handle of the knife protruding from a back pocket of Blomkvist's jeans
There are fresh drops of blood on the floor next to his shoes
You just couldn't stay away, could you
Blomkvist doesn't know what to say
Martin's demeanor, even in this situation, remains cordial
124
124
want to show you something
Bring your drink
Leave the knife
Blomkvist's hope of getting out of here unscathed is pretty much gone now
He pulls the knife from his back pocket and sets it on a side table
224
-                     224 Salander strides past the napping night watchman without leaving the keys or bothering to tell him she's done
225
-                     225 Crossing the empty parking lot, she tries Blomkvist on her cell
Gets his voice mail
Kick-starts her bike
226
'  -                               226 Martin "leads" Blomkvist from behind back to the kitchen, switching off lights as they go
You know what's harder than shooting someone
Just missing them
That was a very good shot up at the cabin
It didn't work
'm here
Mikael, it did work
You're here
They come through a pantry, at the end of which is a door
Open it
Blomkvist does
Sees steps leading into darkness
As they descend Martin flicks a switch and bare fluorescent tubes flicker on to reveal:  furnace
Washer
Dryer
Old discarded furniture
And another door
steel one
As they approach it, Martin presses a little remote and the lock on the steel door clicks
Push it open
227
-                       227 As Blomkvist steps across the threshold - 125
125
Switch is on the left
Blomkvist flips it and a row of overhead fluorescent tubes flickers on - one after the other - revealing a subterranean torture chamber: Metal eyelets bolted to the concrete walls and ceiling and floor - table with leather straps - bed with leather straps - steel-mesh cage - work bench with handsaws and other tools - Blomkvist takes it in with one glance and immediately turns to try to smash the glass in his hand into Martin's face - which is covered now with a plastic oxygen mask he holds to it
Gas plumes down on Blomkvist from above; the glass comes out of his hand, shattering on the cement floor - 228
-                                  228 The Honda's single headlight shudders as Salander comes across the bridge onto the island
228A
'  -                         228A Blomkvist comes to on the floor, handcuffed to a chain that runs through a metal eyelet
He sees Martin behind a video camera on a tripod, focusing it - a shelf full of Betamax tapes - and a  monitor on which his own image then appears
Note: the steel door if we were close enough to it to notice - which we aren't - is not locked
It's not even completely shut
Satisfied with the framing of the shot of his guest, Martin takes a seat on a comfortable armchair upholstered in clear plastic
It squeaks
He regards Blomkvist calmly
Sips his drink
Then almost sighs
Why didn't you just go home
assume you mean the opportunity for that has passed
Martin smiles, appreciating, perhaps, Blomkvist's "easy" manner in this dire circumstance
How'd you do it
What did you find
126
126
Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 Blomkvist doesn't say
Martin looks like he has all the time in the world to wait, and does
Then - We can talk or we can just get on with it
It's really up to you
Nothing from Blomkvist
Martin shrugs `okay,' gets up, goes to his workbench and takes a plastic shower curtain from it
As he's laying it on the floor around his victim, Blomkvist changes his mind - found a picture no one had seen before
Of
You
In your Uppsala prep school blazer
Martin doesn't see the significance, but is pleased Blomkvist has decided to "participate
" He rewards him by suspending his shower curtain work to return to the chair
It squeaks again
What does that say
That you lied about where you were that day
Or rather when
Did
If  did, so what
People lie all the time
It also said that Lena Andersson was a schoolmate
Lena
(he has to think back to remember her) Lena was a long time ago
(pause) Where's this picture now
With all the other junk on your desk
print is
Digital copies are on a secure photo site
127
127
That's a lie
How much does the girl know
Blomkvist isn't sure how to play that question
Let's hope it's as much as you
That'll make it more fun
Where is she
Stockholm
She went there this morning
And that's a lie
She's sitting in our offices looking at more old crap
Our archives manager called me - very perturbed with this girl
Lisbeth
like that name
Lisbeth
When Lisbeth leaves 'll get a call from security, so  can be at your cottage to greet her when she arrives - He holds up the keys he took from Blomkvist's pocket when he was out cold
can't thank you enough for bringing her to me
228B
-                                     228B As Salander gets the door open with her key and comes in - Mikael -
He's clearly not here
She goes to the closet
Takes out the surveillance
Puts it on the desk - next to Blomkvist's laptop which is now displaying - not the photo of Martin he left for her - but the Apple default "light spider" screen saver
As Salander begins rewinding the captured surveillance images backwards at high speed to get to earlier in the day - 229
'  -                        229 Martin reframes the video camera to include part of himself in the shot, sits again and crosses his leg like this is a talk show
128
128
Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 So what would you like to know
There are so many things, but also no point, so Blomkvist says nothing
You're the journalist, ask me something
Nothing from Blomkvist
Which is okay with Martin; he can do this alone - What do  do with my guests
Is that the question
Well, before -  do what we're doing
Relax, have a drink, converse
like that part a lot - having a chat when you both know one of you is going to die
After -  simply get rid of them
Out to sea - (points off) - unlike my father leaving them scattered all over the place like trophies
That's not smart if you ask me
That's just garish and loud
But he was a garish and loud man
Frankly, he got what he deserved
Nothing from Blomkvist, but he is wondering now what happened to Gottfried if the drowning wasn't accidental
You can't be a sloppy technician like that
You can't drink to excess like he did
This takes discipline
It's a science of a thousand details
The planning
The execution
The cleanup
'm sure  don't have to tell you you're going to make quite a mess
Nothing from Blomkvist, but Martin nods
("How do you do this and still function in normal society
") That's the interesting thing
Because most of the time  am just like everyone else
just have a bigger secret
It's wonderful really - standing there waiting for a train - or on a street corner as people brush past me
You know what  mean; () 129
129
Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 (') you have secrets
You had one when you came up here
It made you feel - special
Didn't it
Blomkvist doesn't say
Martin is a little thrown by Blomkvist's next unspoken comment - ("Yes, but my secrets aren't rape and murder") No
'm not a rapist
Of course do that too - and at one time it was enough - but - (gathers his thoughts to explain it) rapist, Mikael, gets off on domination
need
(discards a few other words before:) - destruction
Martin gets up and sets about the business of immobilizing Blomkvist further with a block-and-tackle contraption of chains and straps
Can  ask you something
Why don't people trust their instincts
They sense something's wrong - someone's walking too close behind them - yet they don't cross the street
You knew something was wrong - you even knew what it was - but you came back into the house
Did  force you
Did  grab you and drag you in just offered you a drink
(pause) You'd never think the fear of offending could be stronger than the fear of pain - but you know what
It is
They always come willingly
It amazes him
It always amazes him
He keeps working
And then they're here
They know it's over like you do - and still somehow think they have a chance
"Maybe if  say the right thing - if 'm polite - or  cry and beg - maybe 'll survive
" (regards Blomkvist) And then the moment comes when they realize
no, all hope is gone
() 130
130
(') And when that happens - when  see the hope draining from their face like it is from yours right now - (whispers like it's just between them) - well,  feel myself getting hard just watching it
Silence
Say something
You are a sick fuck
Is this an interview or an editorial
Blomkvist, of course, doesn't answer, or comment, yet Martin considers what the journalist hasn't said
("Martin, civilized people don't do what you do
") You're right, this behavior is unacceptable
know that
But we're not completely different
We both have desires
Satisfying mine just requires more towels
Martin regards Blomkvist in a silence
Then - Anything else you want to know
(pause) You sure
(pause) All right
Whatever you say
He yanks a chain that feeds through the pulleys that lift Blomkvist up onto his feet - 230
-                                      230 Salander watches the surveillance images, forward - Blomkvist leaving the cottage and property on foot
Blomkvist returning to the cottage, going back inside
Blomkvist coming out and attempting a call on his cell
Blomkvist going back inside the cottage
Blomkvist coming out again and leaving the property
Blomkvist not coming back
Nothing but the sky darkening to night
Then - 131
131
Headlights coming through frame
figure appearing on foot at the front gate
The figure just standing there, looking at the cottage
The figure approaching it, and, as it's trying the locked front door, the motion detection light snapping on and illuminating Martin
Martin moving to the side, looking in a kitchen window, coming around front again, walking to the gate, turning around, looking back, then walking out of frame
231
'  -                           231 Blomkvist hangs from the block-and-tackle rig, leather strap around his neck now, fed through a ceiling eyelet
With a big sewing scissors, Martin cuts through and removes Blomkvist's pants and underwear - It might amuse you to know that while you were over here having dinner with me and Liv - who, by the way, finds me very conventional - Irina was down here in the cage
Who's Irina, you ask
girl  met in Belarus
Just another girl
Another immigrant whore
Who misses them
He returns to his work bench to lay out various tools next to his gun and a desk phone
Your sister wasn't just another girl
Martin comes back quickly and yanks a strap that cinches the noose tighter around Blomkvist's neck as it lifts him onto his tiptoes
What happened to her
You're choking me - You found her
You killed her
Martin just stares at him confused
Then - You useless fuckin detective
132
132
He lets go of the strap and Blomkvist's feet come back down to the floor
As Martin returns to his workbench, Blomkvist is not only scared to death, but confused now
Did Martin not kill her
Then Martin is back in front of him with a roll of cellophane, pulls on the strap again until Blomkvist is balancing on his tiptoes, and ties it off
Too tight to talk
It is
Blomkvist can utter no sound but a gag
Good
'm tired of talking to you
He wraps Blomkvist's head in cellophane, completely cutting off his ability to breathe, and calmly watches him struggle
Would you like me to do something about that
Blomkvist desperately nods as he's about to suffocate
Martin watches another several moments
then pokes a finger through the cellophane into Blomkvist's gasping mouth
See
'm not a monster
He frames a wide shot of his naked prey
Turns on some music
Takes a moment to collect himself from all this strenuous work
Brushes back his hair like he wants to look presentable in the shot
Then smiles pleasantly - You know, 've never had a man in here
've never touched a man as a matter of fact
Except my father, of course
But that was my duty
Harriet's, too
The circulation to Blomkvist's head is being cut off by the strap
His fingers behind his naked back claw at the concrete wall to try to relieve some of the weight on the noose, but can't get a grip
Martin watches the struggle calmly, and just as calmly offers: It's time
don't want to be late for my date with our girlfriend
133
133
Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 He puts on a plastic rain poncho
painter's mask
Plastic goggles
Surgeons gloves
Picks up a hunting knife
Steps up to Blomkvist
Looks at his eyes
Brings his own head close to his victim's - Goodbye, Mikael
He pulls the strap, lifting Blomkvist's toes off the floor, closing off his air again
and is about to gut him like a wild boar
when he hears a sound like some kind of animal behind him
He turns and sees her - coming at him from out of the shadows by the steel door - He darts for the gun he left on the workbench - Salander just as quickly swings a 5-iron - his 5-iron - like a baseball bat
Its metal-wedged end arcs through the gloom and slams into the side of his head, sending him tumbling to the floor
He struggles up to his knees, and she swings the club again, splitting flesh and crushing bone as he crumples the floor
She takes the gun from the bench and shoves it in her other back pocket
Grabs the hunting knife and shackles key and hurries over to Blomkvist who only witnessed part of the spectacle before losing consciousness - She saws through the leather strap around his neck
Unlocks the chain
As he sinks to his knees on the floor, blood rushes to his head, bringing him back to life just enough to see what she can't behind her - Martin, blood streaming from the gash in his head, getting to his feet
But he's not coming at them; he's trying to get out - Blomkvist tries to say her name to get her to look
Lifts a hand to try to point
She turns and glimpses the monster as he disappears out the steel door
Looks back at Blomkvist, still handcuffed on the floor, and, like a child asking a parent for permission - May  kill him
Nothing in his life would allow him to agree to such a thing - until now
Now it's as if her years of violence and degradation have been passed to him
He nods
134
134
She puts the hunting knife in his hand
Pulls the gun from her back pocket, checks the clip, flicks off the safety, and turns to leave - He has more guns in the den - know
She comes up the basement stairs, leading with her gun
Distant thunder rumbles
She crosses through the kitchen to the living room, and down the hall to the study
She eases around the doorway - the room is empty - looks to the gun case - sees there are only two rifles there now
She hears an engine start outside
Hurries back through the house
Sees out the picture window the taillights of Martin's car receding fast down the road as clouds burst
She bangs out the front door
Runs halfway down the hill in the rain to where she left her motorcycle, jumps on and kick-starts it
232
-                                  232 She roars onto the bridge, chasing the taillights
Guns the bike to full throttle
Comes alongside him
He swerves to try to crush her against the railing - but she hits the brakes, avoiding the impact - She accelerates again and comes up on the other side of the car
He swerves again at her, but this time the bike pulls ahead of him
Now he's chasing her - He gains on her as they near the end of the bridge
As they race off it, he goes in for the kill, but she veers hard to one side, leaving him headed straight for the gas station Blomkvist makes his pay phone calls from - and the tanker truck parked there - Martin hits the brakes - hydroplanes into the truck - and its, or his own tank, or both, explode - Salander circles back
Regards the fire engulfing the car
The rain does nothing to dampen it
She could probably brave it to pull Martin out - but doesn't
As the flames burn his clothes, he manages to get his hands on the rifle he took from the den, turns its barrel to his bloody head - but before he can pull the trigger, she hurries over, yanks it from his grasp and stands back again
It's much more cathartic to watch him burn
135
135
233
'  -  -                         233 She finds Blomkvist in the living room
Sitting in a chair, his coat wrapped around him
The hunting knife in his hand
Distant sirens echo
He can still just barely manage to speak - Where is he
Dead
234
-                                        234 Reminiscent of the last photographs taken on the Hedeby Island bridge forty years ago, police and firemen finish up at the crash site
winch drags Martin's charred black wreck of a car onto a tow truck
235
-                              235 Blomkvist is asleep in the bedroom with what looks like a neck tattoo - the black and blue mark left by Martin's noose that nearly strangled him to death
He doesn't hear the knock at the front door, nor - / It's open
Frode comes into the cottage looking shaken
Salander is the picture of calm, drinking a cup of black coffee
Where's Mikael
Asleep
Coffee
There's no milk
Frode absently shakes his head no
have some very upsetting news
Martin was killed in a car accident last night
Sad
Frode isn't sure he heard right
Regards Salander sipping her coffee
What
136
136
said it's sad
(pause) What do you know about this
She doesn't say any more
Frode gets up and starts toward the bedroom - have to talk to (Mikael) - Let him sleep
It's not a request; it's a command
236
-  -                            236 Frode is ashen as he leafs through a binder Salander brought from Martin's chamber of horrors late last night: scrapbook of murder
death book
Photos of women cowering in his cage, tied to the bed, dead on the table - along with souvenirs of painted fingernails and locks of hair - all carefully taped into the `album
' The older photographs are Polaroids; the newer ones digital prints
With little to no discernible emotion, Salander watches Frode wince as he turns the pages
Frode can't take it anymore
Closes the book before reaching the end
Just sits there
What are we going to do
We're going home, Mikael and me
don't know what you're going to do
'm going to the police
Show them the videos while you're at it
The - Salander points to a stack of video tapes
137
137
Would you like to see them
No
236A
-  -                       236A Blomkvist half-wakes to find Salander lying next to him, fully-clothed, watching him
Is she actually there, or part of a dream
He looks at her a long moment, then tries out his voice - How is it someone who's 23 is a ward of the state
'm mentally incompetent and can't manage daily life
He smiles, thinking it's joke
It isn't, he realizes
Since when have they said that
Since  was twelve
Something happened when you were twelve
She doesn't say
Just studies him
It's all right, you don't have to tell me anything - tried to kill my father
burned him alive
Got about 80 percent of him
(pause) Oh
Silence
Then - We need milk
237     -
-  -                              237 138

-                                            238 She pours milk in her coffee from the carton she just bought
Pushes over two faded Polaroid photos
He picks them up: One shows a young girl about 14, naked from the waist up, head turned half-away from the camera
The second shows her on her stomach on a bed, completely naked, face turned to the photographer, frightened
Harriet
think so
Blomkvist can't look at the photos long
Sets them down
Something's troubling him - Martin didn't deny killing anyone
But when  mentioned Harriet, he was confused
He was angry - at me - for not being able to tell him what happened to her
(pause) He didn't kill her
And his father was dead the year before
(pause) What if she did somehow get away
Could she have done that
Could she have done it alone
He goes up to his wall of suspects
Is she's alive, there's only one person in this family who would know where she is
He takes the photo of Anita down from the wall
239
-                                           239 Henrik sits in one of the chairs
Blomkvist in another
Salander prefers to stand
Eventually - Poor Martin
Clearly, he hasn't been shown the death book, or been told the tale of Blomkvist's night in Martin's dungeon
139
139
have to go away for a couple days
When  come back,  hope to have an answer for you
Such a possibility stuns the old man
He regards Blomkvist a moment
Then Salander
Would the young lady mind giving us a moment of privacy
She's my partner, Henrik
She should stay
tiny, tiny, tiny smile finds its way to her face at the mention of the word `partner
' What have you found
'm not sure
Don't treat me like a child
Tell me
can't
don't know
need a week
Vanger studies him
Then - 've waited forty years
can wait another week
240
-   -                               240 Blomkvist and Salander read magazines in a pair of coach seats
Across the aisle - occupying two seats - is one 300-lb
sleeping figure: Plague
241
-  -                                     241 They drink pints in an unpopular, almost-empty pub Cure song plays
always liked this song
(nothing from her or Plague) You don't
140
140
don't like classical music
strange-looking young man comes in, regards the strange- looking trio at the table, comes over
To the fat man - Plague
Trinity
Wasp
Blomkvist starts to offer his hand before realizing no one else has or will
Mikael
Trinity sits
None of these people have much experience with human interaction
They all look at Blomkvist, but he isn't sure why
The money
Blomkvist takes an envelope from his jacket, hands it to Trinity
He begins counting it - 242
-                                        242 Alone in the back of a parked van amidst electronic components he doesn't understand, Blomkvist anxiously stares out a tinted window at a dark row house
Headlights flare down the street
An approaching car
He hopes it passes, but it instead pulls up to the garage - waits for the door to go up - pulls in
Fuck me
He watches Anita Vanger get out of the car - the garage door come down - light go on inside the house - then dark figures hurrying along the side of the house: Trinity, Salander, and finally Plague
They climb into the van with their tools, firewires, a laptop
None speaks as they tether cables to computers in the van
Blomkvist just watches
Finally, to him - It's your turn
141
141
243
'  -  -                         243 Blomkvist knocks on the door
Anita pulls it open
It's me
Sorry to bother you
She doesn't invite him in, but doesn't shut the door in his face either
What do you want
No one's called you
About
Your cousin
She has two, but doesn't ask which - Martin
What about him
He died last Thursday
car accident
'm sorry
(nothing from her) There's going to be a memorial in Hedestad
know you haven't been back there in a long time, but - 'm not interested in any memorial
understand
What do you understand
That you don't really care for any of your relatives
Still,  thought you should know
Now  know
And now, she closes the door
142
142
244    :
'  -  -                  244 245
'  -  -                          245 Blomkvist returns to the van
Climbs in
How'd it go
Okay
think
He sits and watches them monitor the phone and computer taps they installed earlier
One of the laptops, without anyone touching it, blinks on to a Google screen
She's on
screen name and password characters on a Gmail page type themselves
They expect her to go to "Compose," but she opens one of the messages - spam - deletes it - marks a couple more and banishes them as well
The only new thing left in the inbox is an eBay alert
Clicking it takes her to an auction for a triple-strand faux-pearl Jackie  necklace: 49 pounds
The cursor clicks the Buy-It-Now button
As the screen switches to Anita's Paypal account, Blomkvist and Salander exchange a confused glance
246    :
-  -                          246 246A
-  -  -                    246A Salander's laptop is monitoring Anita's computer, her hard-line phone and cell
Blomkvist emerges from the bathroom, rests a hand on Salander's shoulder to peer over it at the screen: In one of the windows, cards are dealing themselves
She's playing solitaire
(Salander nods) And she still hasn't called anyone
No
Do we have her cell, too
Salander points to one of the windows on the screen
His hand comes off her shoulder
143
143
was so she'd lead us to her
Put your hand back on my shoulder
He does
They watch the solitaire game together
There's only one reason she wouldn't call Harriet
She can't because Harriet is indeed dead
247
-  -  -                        247 It's strange perhaps, but he does some of his best thinking during sex - was just thinking
What if - Ten more seconds
That's fair
She finishes
They lie there
Then - Okay, what
was just thinking, there could be one other possibility
248   :
-  -                        248 249
-  -                             249 Blomkvist taps on Anita's open office door
May
What is it now
He comes in and sits
want to show you something
He tugs his shirt collar low enough to reveal the black and blue "tattoo" around his neck
Anita is taken aback by the sight
It's hard to imagine how anyone would end up with a mark like that
144
144
Before he died, your brother hung me from a hook
Harriet
250
-  -                                    250 They sit together on a park bench
Anita married in Stockholm in 1967
It's recorded in the Swedish General Register
But the family never knew, did they
(she confirms that with a shake of her head) 'm guessing she then came here on a passport in her married name, and you followed on her maiden name passport
Actually, it was the other way around
She thought it safer for me to travel with Spencer myself
What did he think about that
Nothing
Only that he loved her
She said, If you love me, you'll do this and not ask why
He never did
They both died twenty years ago
car accident
You found that, too
Blomkvist nods, reaches for something in his jacket pocket - changes his mind - changes it again and pulls it out
Is this you
He hands her the less graphic of the two Polaroids Salander found in Martin's basement - the young girl, face turned half-away from the camera
was 14 the first time he raped me
Martin
145
145
No, my father
He took this picture
Martin didn't start until he died
Blomkvist can't hide his horror even after all he's seen
Why didn't you tell someone
did
My mother
Blomkvist stares
Finally - Henrik would have done something
Would he
don't know
almost told him
But  was afraid because of what  did
(pause) You still don't understand
He doesn't
She studies him, and perhaps sees in him what Salander did long ago - that he can be trusted
year after the first time - after many times during that year - my father got drunker than usual one night and started bragging about women he'd killed
He quoted from the Bible as he tore off my clothes
He wrapped a belt around my neck
He wanted to kill me
251
'  -  - 1965                     251 Harriet makes it out of the cabin in torn clothing, trying to get the belt around her neck off
Her father can heard inside ranting something from the Bible
/ made it out of the house and down to the dock
He came staggering after me - Gottfried emerges from the cabin and stumbles down the hill in pursuit of his almost-naked daughter
/ could never fight him off in a small room, but  was strong enough out in the open to deal with an old drunk
146
146
As he comes onto the dock, she waits for the moment, and smashes him in the head with the flat side of an oar
It stuns and sends him toppling off the dock into the water
He surfaces, reaches for the dock planks
As he takes hold of them to claw himself from the water, she brings the sharp edge of the oar down, burying it in his head like an axe
He stares up her, uncomprehending
His fingers slide away from the dock
His body goes limp and sinks out of sight beneath the water
/ When it was finally over  looked up, and Martin was standing there - She sees her brother up by the cabin looking down at her
/ With a little smile
252
-  -                                 252 He dragged me back to the cabin
All 'd accomplished was substitute one rapist for another
253
-  - 1966                              253 Young Harriet and her school friends walk along the town's main street past crowds lining it, and we realize we're seeing what we've only seen in still photographs
/ couple months later, Henrik sent him off to school in Uppsala
And thought maybe - maybe - the nightmare was over
Until that day
The float with the harem girls comes past, and we watch the smile on young Harriet's face change to fear as she notices something off to the left
/ There he was - across the street - looking at me with that same little smile on his face
clear shot of young Martin in his Uppsala blazer, standing by the corner, smiling at her
/ It wasn't over
147
147
254
-  -                              254 How'd you get away
Anita
255
-  - 1966                             255 Anita, framed in the bedroom window - like in the photograph - looks out at the activity on the bridge
Behind her, Harriet packs a few items of clothing
Don't take anything
Harriet puts the clothes back
Picks up her purse
Leave that, too
256
-  - 1966                           256 The dinner that night
Vanger noticing Harriet's empty chair
And Anita saying nothing, taking a bite of food
257
-  - 1966                            257 The searchers scouring the island
The boats moving along the shoreline
The crane lifting the truck from the bridge
Anita climbs into her car outside her father Harald's house
Drives down the road toward the bridge
Stay absolutely still
The blanket covering Harriet on the backseat floorboard moves slightly, then is still
policeman on the island side of the bridge waves the car across it
As it heads along the mainland service road toward the highway - / She saved me
258
-  -                                    258 Silence
Then she gestures to Blomkvist's neck
How did you get away
Someone saved me, too
148
148
He gestures off to the thin, strange girl sitting on another park bench too far away to hear them
Harriet does something she hasn't done since they met: smile

-                                     259A Blomkvist, Salander and Frode wait in Vanger's       study tea service tray sits there untouched like the       first time Blomkvist came here
Anna pushes a wheelchair        into the room with Vanger in it
There's a file on his        lap
How are you feeling
'm fine
Thank you, Anna
Anna leaves
Closes the doors
Before Blomkvist can say anything else - made you a promise
Whether you found out anything or not
He holds out the file
Blomkvist takes it and sees: : Wennerstorm's name typed on it, and a fairly recent photo of him clipped to it
Now
What do you have to tell me
259B
-                                     259B car pulls up the drive
Parks
The back door opens
Harriet climbs out
Looks at the manor
Then walks toward the front door - 260
-                             260 Vanger propels his wheelchair down the main hall, but stops when he sees Harriet coming in the front door with Anna
He stares, trying to reconcile how she looks now compared to when he last saw her, or maybe to convince himself she's really alive
She sees him
Hi, Henrik
He begins to weep
She walks to him and places a hand on his hunched shaking shoulders
Frode, Blomkvist and Salander watch
One of them isn't particularly moved

-  -                               261A As Frode leafs through the file that Blomkvist has already read - don't even remember Wennerstrom working here, much less being fired
Why would you
It was a long time ago
Which is more to the point than the money he embezzled
don't think 'm seeing the point
Yes, you are
(another look at the paperwork) It happened in the 1970's
Salander watches the two men from across the room
() (regarding the documents) swear  didn't know this was what Henrik had on him
If  had,  never would have let him bring you up here
But he wasn't trying to deceive you
Come on, he knows you can't try somebody for this 35 years later like Henrik, but he knows that
Frode disagrees - man's reputation used to mean something - he still believes that
'm sure he thought you could destroy Wennerstrom with this in the court of public opinion
The "court of public opinion," Dirch, makes celebrities out of girls who shop
Henrik promised me Wennerstrom's carcass on a plate
This isn't even the plate
can't do anything with this

Fuck these people
Yeah
Harriet most of all
Excuse me
If she'd done anything but run, Martin wouldn't have been able to kill all those women
She had no idea he was doing it
She should have killed her father and him
That's what you would've done
Not everyone's you
She's not sure she likes the comment

Takes her arm away from his shoulder
That was meant to be a compliment
Put your arm back on my shoulder

got something from an anonymous source, who 'm sure now worked for him
It was fake
Which he easily proved in court
Not a good day, that

Would you feel the same about Wennerstrom
He regards her, uncertain what she means

As Erika looks at it - Wennerstrom's Swedish assets are genuine, but they're the only things that are
The rest is funneled through companies in Gibraltar, Colombia, and Macao
These companies produce no products and provide no services
They're shells
They launder money from arms and drug sales, and crime syndicates in Russia
And that money - which accounts for all but 5-percent of his holdings - ends up in accounts in the Cayman Islands
It's a completely illegal, criminal empire
How do you know this

This time you don't want to know
This time  do want to know

She isn't happy to hear that explanation
And how do you have that
could have gotten it from a source inside the company
But you didn't
But that's what you'll say
But what will you say to me
That depends on if you really want to know

Who gave you access

Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 In the current issue of Millennium magazine, he now charges the same company that successfully sued him - The Wennerstrom Group - of criminal activities on a global scale - backing it up with internal financial reports, bank records and emails - annotations almost as long as the article itself
The cover of the magazine features a head shot of Wennerstrom, and, rare for the magazine, a tabloid-style title:
Salander leafs through the article as Blomkvist brushes his teeth in the bathroom
He'll call it a personal vendetta but it won't work
can't ignore banking and securities fraud like this
The police can't ignore the organized crime stuff
They'll both have to investigate
Then
We'll be back in court, but this time it'll cost him
That's probably it, though
These guys never to prison
Salander nods, but it's not really in agreement
Or maybe it is
In any case, she's not as enthused about all this as he is
What's wrong
It's embarrassing

'  -                            297 perfect Christmas card vista that actually turns out to be a Christmas card:  snowy rural landscape scene
It's stupid, but she's writing under the pre-printed "Merry Christmas" inside, a personal note that's more sincere than she thought herself capable
She blows on the ink, puts the card in its envelope, neatly writes "Mikael" on it, gets up - 298
-                                    298 Snow's falling, but unlike the brutal winter storms last year, it's just heavy enough to dust the city in white powder that reflects the Christmas lights in the trees
The beauty of her city pleases Salander as she rides through it on her motorcycle
Or maybe it's something she's feeling as she turns onto Blomkvist's street
She parks
Gathers the garment bag and card, walks under construction scaffolding toward his apartment building
From around the corner ahead, Blomkvist and Erika appear
He says something and she laughs, puts her arm around his waist and lays her head against his neck scarf
Salander stops mid-stride, ducks into an alcove under the scaffolding, waits as long as it should take them to get inside the building, then peers out again - They're not inside
They've stopped just outside the building's entrance
They're embracing
And the longer they stand there together, the sharper the pain stabs at Salander
Finally they separate, but only to allow Blomkvist to unlock the door
Erika takes his hand then, and they disappear inside
165
165
Salander   can't move
Waits for the pain to subside - which it   eventually does - but only to be replaced with a sense of   helplessness
Then that subsides, replaced with a facade   of insouciance
The richest girl in Sweden emerges from the alcove and walks back the way she came - tossing the garment bag and card into a construction dumpster - climbs onto her Honda - starts it - and drives off - Probably forever
