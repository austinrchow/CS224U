Scream 3 - early draft 2nd  - 2, 1999 : big dramatic crescendo as we -- : -  - Friday night traffic as usual
Things appear to be backed up all the way to the valley
cacophony of car horns rise up on the soundtrack as we slowly : - new 99' Explorer sits in the midst of the gridlock
Behind the wheel is hot teen heartthrob and Hollywood everybody
Ben is handsome, studly, in his early 20s
However, aside from being just another pretty face in the city of angels he's also a cocky, arrogant prick
Ben's in the middle of a heated argument on his cell with his Agent, Cathy
(into cell) God dammit Cathy  have no time for this crap
'm supposed to be at the premiere of  2 right Now, arm and arm with my girlfriend cause she's got a bit part in that over advertised piece of shit and 'm just going to humor her
You mena to tell me that in all your squandering the best you can do for me is bit role in  3:
Come on
It's just another cheap slasher flick
How dare you offer me such a role
've done Shakespeare
've worked with directors like DePalma and Scorcesse and you offer me this crap
It's insulting
should fire you and go to
(
) (off phone) Ben,  will not sit around and listen to you bad mouth me
Without me you would've never gotten as famous as you are today
The least you can do is show me a little god damn respect
(into phone) You want Respect, Cathy
Here's your respect
You're fired
(Ben hangs up) Unfucking believable
Ben socks the steering wheel out of frustration
The horn blares uncomfortably

Hon, although  got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie
Heh heh  bet they are babe

Look, my battery's dying
But of course, we notice Ben's battery is fine, he's just trying to cut the conversation short
(
) Alright Hon, talk to you when the lights go down
Ben smiles
Sure thing
Ben hangs up
He reclines back in his seat
Camera slowly pans out the windshield revealing the huge traffic pile up awaiting him
He's not going anywhere
Ben opens the glove compartment
Papers scatter out
Ben reaches for a card
- small white business card:   1-900--4- Ben smiles, begins to dial out when suddenly,
The cell comes to life in his hand
(startled) Jesus
(answers call) Hello
Hello
Who is this
Who is this
At this point we know who the caller is
It's the nightmarish deep voice we've all come to know and hate from the first two films
It's never sounded so evil
So sexy
Well what number are you trying to reach
don't know
think you got the wrong number, buddy
Do
(peeved) Uh-huh
Look bro, my battery is running out
Really wish  could chat, but  can't so, later
Wait, wait

You almost sound like that guy from '
Ben
Ben Damon
(smiling profusely) Well ya got me
That's me

Really
You're such a talented actor
(loves the praise) Thanks
Now let's see you act your way out of this one
The voice seems to have changed tones
It now sounds a lot harsher, angrier if you will
What do you mean

Your girlfriend Christine is in there
She's all alone
Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start
(laughs coldly) 've got my knife
*: At this point we intercut shots of the empty lobby and halls of the shot standing outside the   door
(turning pale) Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke
More of a game really
What kind of a game
You seem to be familiar with the  movies
Here's how we play
ask you a question
You get it right, your girlfriend lives
You answer wrong, she dies
swear to God if you lay a finger on her 'll fucking kill you
Maybe so, but right now, we play the game
First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in  2
Ben groans
He bangs his head against the steering wheel, if only  he'd have paid attention to Christine he might have known this
Come on
Don't you know
(hesitating) It's
Cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie
Very good
Now we play  2

Now we're taking the game to a whole new level

The killer hangs up
Ben looks ahead, traffic is picking up

His car screeches down the off ramp

Nope

He begins to walk towards the sign when suddenly -- Ben answers the call
(into phone) Yeah
Very good
You follow directions well
Now for the final part of the game
Put down the bat and approach the sign, slowly
Ben makes a disgusted face, tosses the bat into the bushes
He approaches the sign, keeping his eyes trained in all directions
(into phone) Where are you
Closer than you think
(into phone) Alright 'm here
What the fuck do you want from me
To see your reaction
Reaction to what
Ben passes under the huge, pallid "" in the sign
What seems at first like a gentle raindrop, beads down Ben's forehead
He rolls back his head, his legs turning to jelly, his eyes widening in horror

She has been fastened to the cross-bar in the "" with heavy rope
Her lifeless body sways ever so gently in the Southern California wind
Utterly horrified, Ben staggers into the shadows, not seeing -- as he rises from the void, knife in hand
In one quick, brutal stab, the knife is driven into Ben's spine
Ben screams as he's turned around, face to face with his attacker

Good morning Hollywood
And today officially starts the Summer movie season
Opening the box office this week is Jeff Bridges and Tim Robins in Arlington Street,  Eugene Levy and Jason Biggs in American Pastry, and Tori Spelling and David Schwimmer in  2, based off my best selling book the
pans across the audience
Many of them are dressed as the
sea of white screaming faces
Very eerie and unsettling
Well  see a lot of the audience has dressed to the occasion
Today we have director of the upcoming  3:   , Roman Bridger
Why don't we give Mr
Bridger a nice welcome to the set of Total Entertainment
The crowd goes wild with applause and faux-knife slashes as  , ravishingly handsome, 29, tall and stocky, enters stage dressed in a flashy white suit
He sits down on a chair beside Gale's desk, places a  3 coffee mug beside Gale's hand
Good morning Gale
Pleasure to be here
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman
(addressing audience) Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre
And  must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the  trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here
Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers  believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way
(a beat) Honestly though, (smiles) tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie
(a long pause) Honestly, my life
eclectic hush falls over the crowd
Roman appears somewhat sinister in this light
Gale gazes deeply into Roman's eyes
Your life
Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick
Roman smiles
The true costumed horror film buffs in the audience break into applause
Gale, somewhat distracted, other what not caring what this second rate director has to say, gazes at a costumed individual at the far corner of the set, watching from a half-open exit door
Now it could be just her imagination running away with her and her atmosphere but it almost appears as if the figure is pantomiming slitting his throat with a gleaming blade
Gale is startled out of her skin
She looks up at a sign hanging over the stage
" " is illuminated in flashing red light
Gale sighs, looks back to the exit
The  is gone
She turns to Roman
Would you excuse me for a moment
(smiling) Sure
Gale bolts for -- -    - Gale races around the corner of the set, smashing right into - ,

Handsome with piercing eyes
He grabs Gale by her shoulders, shepherding her aside
Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me
'm sorry Miss Weathers
Allow me to introduce myself,  ,
(flashes badge) Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress
Well  interviewed Damon once for the show
He was a real obnoxious fuck
Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she
She was playing
Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign
Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films
So is that why you're here
Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide 'm not even involved in
wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more
The killer left a note

Detective Kincaid reaches into his back pocket, pulls up a newspaper clipping in a ziplock evidence bag
He holds the bag up For Gale to see

b/w photo of Sidney's mother Maureen stands hauntingly before the camera
(
) That's Sidney Prescott's mother
(
) There's more
Kincaid flips the article over
Someone has scrawled in black marker across the back ""
've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden
You're my one and only hope in finding her
Her life may be in grave danger
'd love to help, really  wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but honestly don't know where Sidney is
After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth
The only other person that might know is, (gale hesitates), not going to talk
And who would that be
: - red  convertible speeds through the back lot
Behind the wheel is Former Police Officer, turned Technical advisor on the red hot set of 3:
All around the lot are promotional banners and posters for the film
Dewey parks his car outside a soundstage, exits
: 3  - huge replication of Woodsboro in a building about the size of an airplane hanger
In one corner we've got the Macher and Prescott homes
In another corner stands the infamous Becker house where the nightmare all began
In other regions are sights like the Town Square and Market, an exterior for the Woodsboro Police Station,     news van, etc
, Enters set, bumping into his movie alter-ego -- , a Hollywood poster boy
Very cool
Not so debonair
shoddy copy of Dewey at best
However, the conversation between the two is friendly, and they exchange greetings
Hey Dew, did you hear
No, what
Somebody iced Ben Damon and his girlfriend
That's Hollywood Tom
One day you're making movies in the hills, the next day you're posing for the coroner downtown on a slab
Dewey's obviously gotten a lot colder since the last film
He walks past a clique of  3'  : There's: : 30, playing a 25 year old bimbo
Very hot
Very blonde
Ample cleavage
: 20
Extremely nadve looking
She won her part in  3 playing Sidney through a phone in radio contest
She's timid, with short dark hair
Out of the entire cast, she is the closet to Sidney, they got
And also the loveable : late 20's, African-American, all attitude
The three flip through pages of the  3 script, conversing freely about the production
Goddamnit  am getting so fed up with these re-writes
It's like every five minutes there's a new script
God, and you just know this all because of  2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting
And still the film is Number One at the box office this weekend
Beat out American Pasty and Arlington Street
think Jeff Bridges is getting tired
Nah  think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced
just hope none of us end up dead
Oh that's right
Those poor poor people
God Ben Damon was such a hottie
(sighs) And that  chick wasn't that bad either but 'm really concerned about my safety now
What are you talking about
The murders were a completely isolated incident
(reading from script) 32
'   -
"What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident"
Would you give that script a rest
It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you
'm just saying, though
What if there's someone out there stalking actors
Huh
Then what
There's always someone out there stalking actors
Look at that woman from the Commish
Melinda McGraw
No, the other one
The one who played his wife
know who you're talking about
Rebecca something
Yeah  think
Anyway, point is, she had a stalker
Sonny Bono had a stalker
David Letterman had one too
So did Heather Langenkamp, Brooke Sheilds, Jody Foster, -- Listen Miss ingenue, your cheering me up to much, Give it a break
Tom walks into frame, sits down next to Angelina, subtly putting his arm around her
She shoves him away
What
What'd  do
Relax your crack sweetheart didn't rip those two fucks up last night
Jeez
(lights up a smoke) So what are you doing tonight
Totally repulsed, Angelina gets up, races off set
Talk about moody
Tom leans back seductively, his crotch in full view, staring at Sarah with bedroom eyes
And how about you good looking
Got any plans for later
Eww yeah, finding a guy to have sex with that doesn't look like you
Sarah, following suit laid by Angelina, scampers off set
Tom looks up at Tyson, smoke blowing out his nostrils
Oh no
ain't into that shit
Tyson races off set
Tom laughs, covers his face
: They walk through the set
Gale's mesmerized
Kincaid is all business
Dejr vu-do
The pair come to a halt on the driveway of what is supposed to be the Macher Residence
Everything from the smashed beer bottles in the garage, to the boat on the driveway is mimicked to a perfect t
Even a foam dummy Of dangles from the doggy door, head squashed a bloody mess
stares at the swaying dummy, haunted
(
) Well well, someone dies and Gale Weathers comes running
What a shock
looks up
stands beside her
Mr
Rielly
My name is Mark Kincaid
'm with the
Are you aware	of last night's Events
Yeah
real tragedy
Dewey stares daggers through Gale
There is a real bitter coldness between the two
Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney
We need to know where she is
What so you can just exploit her again with another book
Sid doesn't need you Gale
(to Kincaid) Show him
Mr
Rielly, this was found alongside the bodies of Ben and his girlfriend
Kincaid hands Dewey the ziplocked clipping
Dewey examines it, his fear slowly growing
promised Sid 'd keep her in seclusion
promised her nobody would ever find her
If you don't mind Detective, 'd like to approach her with this on my own and see what she'd like to do about it
Kincaid nods
That's fine Mr
Rielly, but if anyone else should die, 'm going to have to get a warrant
Understood
(a beat) If you'll excuse me Detective
(coldly) Gale
Dewey walks off camera
Kincaid puts his hand on Gale's shoulder
'm going to have a little chat with the producers
Don't wander off
may need you
Gale nods as Kincaid disappears into the backdrop of the set
Shrill voice (
) Oh my God
Jennifer Jolie, an ambitious young starlet, playing  in the latest Stab, rushes towards her, with arms wide open
She's decked out in the flashy neon green ensemble Gale wore in the first film and even sports a fake shiner on her right eye
Gale is obviously pissed
She knows this actress and doesn't really want to be in her company very long
Gale Shit
Jennifer Listen,  know we've never met, and don't mind you never returning my calls, but  have to tell you that after two films feel like  am in your mind
Gale Well, that would explain my constant headaches
Jennifer (defensively) You know 'm sorry that things didn't work out on '60 Minutes ', but 'Total Entertainment' that's a pretty good fall back
Gale Thank you
'm sorry that things didn't work out with Brad Pitt, but being single, that's a pretty good fall back
Jennifer Gives me more time for my work
After all, Gale Weathers, you're such a complex character
Gale And to be played by an actress with such depth and range
Dewey steps back into the picture, cell phone in hand
Dewey No answer at Sid's
Where'd the Detective go
(excitedly) Gale stares at the couple, just processing things in her head
Jennifer (fondles Dewey's butt) Gale,  think you'll really appreciate my character work in this one, someone's helped me understand the real you
Gale Someone
Jennifer The ruthless ambition, your private self-loathing, and that lost and lonely little girl inside
Gale Lost and lonely what
Jennifer You heard me
(takes Dewey's cellular) Thanks Dewey
'll return it
Gale Lost and lonely what
Dewey Little girl inside
Gale thought you were supposed to be in Woodsboro
Dewey Well, 'm surprised you thought about me at all
Listen  gotta get back to trying to get hold of Sid
Besides, she's more important than you ever were
Gale Wait
Dewey we can work on this together
As a team
Like in the past
Dewey No really Gale, that's a sweet offer, but this time 'd like to catch the killer before the body count gets any higher
(a beat) Toodles
Dewey walks away leaving Gale alone
Kincaid enters frame, 	talking to two producers
The elder, sixty-five year old  , a towering, hefty man with gray hair
The second, bigwig horror producer  , a creepy fifty-something with penetrating eyes and a menacing demeanor
The two talk, ignoring Gale the entire time
She's almost eavesdropping on their conversation
can assure you that security on the set will be at an all time high
Again, the deaths are sheer tragedy
Well, 'd hate to see the production shut down
(laughs) myself am a big  fan
Really
(smiles) Have you ever thought about acting
You've got just the right face
am kind of dedicated to my job
Although  do enjoy taking acting classes on my weekends
grew up around these studios anyway
know my way around
My Uncle was a screenwriter for
Really, what was his name
Before Kincaid can finish, Gale buts in
Excuse me Detective,  think we have some business to attend to
(flabbergasted) What are you doing here
No press on the set
(to security) No press, no press on set
Get that woman out of here
(approaching) Yes, Mr
Milton
No, Mr
Milton, Miss Weathers is with me
Milton nods his head, flags down the guard
He walks away
Well then,  guess 'll be leaving then
Oh come on
Why the hostility
Listen Lois Lane,  love your show and all but last month  happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because 'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls
It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions
(shit-eating smile on her face) They're the ones who approved it
Milton storms off camera, Buddy following close behind
Gale looks up at Kincaid
Alright Kincaid, no where to
go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers
Oh
thought you wanted me to stick around
Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call
Here's my card
'm always there
Kincaid hands Gale his card, begins to walk out of the building

Doubt that

Sarah continues further down the hall when suddenly -- comes reeling out of a doorway, a huge knife jutting out his back, blood trickling down his mouth
Sarah lets out a bloodcurdling scream while Tyson breaks into hysterics

Bridger
No answer
The guard nods, backs out of the offices, locking them with and the killer inside
: - Sarah's waiting on eggs as a digitized pre-programmed commissarymenu for Sunrise Studios drags out
Shit
Sarah momentarily glances behind her, just noticing, a pair of black work boots stepping off the costume rack
Before Sarah has a chance to scream, the ghost jumps down and shoves the rack hard sending a screaming Sarah into the next room
She goes flying out, slamming into a metal table covered with prop weapons
-- Stomps into the second prop room, knife raised
Sarah leaps up, starts to chuck the prop knives at her attacker, screaming furiously
knives, hit the ghost, and bend as they bounce off his body and onto the floor
The killer shakes his head angrily, stalks towards his prey
(screaming) No
No
Noooo
The ghost drives his knife into Sarah's chest, once, twice, and delivers a final killing blow to her Adam's apple
She staggers forward
Her killer grabs her by her long buxom hair, and hucks her into a glass door
, '  falling through, shards of glass tearing out her back
, stands in the shattered doorway, bloody knife in hand
An alarm resonates in the b

The killer wipes his knife clean, races off screen

- The highway is desolate
It's late
Sidney speeds into frame in her : - Sidney's tapping her thumbs nervously against the steering wheel as an eerie song filters off the radio
The only light comes from the unsettling neon green digital clock/radio read-out
Sidney increases speed

The lot Is crawling with police vehicles
: 3   - Kincaid and Gale stare at Sarah Darling's corpse as it's zippered up into a black rubber body bag and carried off by forensic technicians
That's  3, Miss Weathers
It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway
Shit
Sarah Darling
(a beat) interviewed her too
God, it's happening again isn't it Detective
Yes well we have a suspect, so don't get that worried
Gale's eyes light up
She grabs Kincaid's shoulders
Who
'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers
You're no longer working with the
don't even know why you're standing in here right now
By all means  should have you thrown out
But you won't
You're a good man detective
We think alike
know you need my help
And  know you know  need your help
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective 've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers
Please, call me Gale
Deal, but 'm still Detective Kincaid,ok
Gale smiles
, Kincaid's cohort and partner
He's in his late thirties
Family man
Wallaceenters frame with a folder in his hands
Mark, Bridger's in custody
We traced his phone records
He's the last person to speak to Sarah Darling before she died
Or at least call her home
Wait a minute, Roman's your suspect
Listen, Diane Sawyer, this here is classified information
Why don't you go investigate the bad meat at the
This is police work, not Pulitzer material
Hey, fuck off
No, cool it Wallace
She's working with me
(cocky) Well then
Looks like 'll go dust for finger prints with Barbara Walters
Wallace arrogantly walks off camera
Gale looks at Kincaid
So, what now
: -   - frazzled Roman is seated at a long conference table while Wallace and Kincaid grill him with questions
Mr
Bridger, you didn't tell us you spoke with Sarah Darling before she died
That's because  didn't
The guard said she was there for a meeting with you
What meeting
We talked to her roommate, too
Says you called Sarah and told her to come down to the studio
Roommate answered the phone, says it was you
Wait a minute
never called her
never told her to go   anywhere
Roommate says she knows your voice, Mr
Bridger
Well, she wasn't speaking with me
Look,  did not call   Sarah Darling
Sarah Darling said you did
Someone is trying to ruin my movie
Someone wants to kill   my movie
Hey, look at it this way, if anything this'll be something interesting to put on the director's commentary for when the film hits
(dry laugh) Ha
Too late, studio's shutting down production
Called my film a risk
Do you believe this shit
They're actually shelving my film because there's been one ensie little murder
God, three people died during the filming of The Exorcist
Well  doubt they were stabbed to death and strongly doubt the killer of them left messages on the scene for the police to find
Camera pans through a two-way mirror into
-   - stand, gazing through the two-way mirror
Roman can't see them
They watch nervously
They found another note
Uh-huh
Another News clipping
Another one about Sid's mom
Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past
You mean  past as in Me and Sid
This has nothing to do with you Gale
This has everything to do with me Dewey
was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway
'll be damned if 'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again
Do you really mean it this time Gale
Yes
Look, let's get something straight Dewey,  got into this shit cause the police came looking for
Not cause 'm out to make the
Why would the police come to you
Again,  am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders
(a beat) What about you
What about me
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real
'  But now you're here
Not with me
Dewey,  took care of you
waited until you were well
couldn't stay there,  mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else
So it's off to London for a week
New York for a month
Forever
It was fucking '60 Minutes '
couldn't say no could've been the next Diane Sawyer
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers
liked her
It didn't work Dewey
We tried,  we're different
You used to say that was our strength
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate -Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you
All of what Dewey
You do know something, don't you
Off the record
Always
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'
She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research
And
The boys said no
She wouldn't give her name
month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked
Someone stole Sid's file
already removed it
think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason  came here
To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything
(whips out cellular) 'm sorry, this is too good
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand
Right
Sorry
(a beat) Do you think he did it
(: ) (his beeper goes off) 've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person
And who is that
But Dewey doesn't answer
Again, he's staring daggers through Gale
Years and years of bottled up resentment is finally surfacing
Jennifer needs me
Jennifer
Wait, where are you going off to
'm on duty
Dewey races out the room
Gale pauses, stares at the interrogation
Wallace has reduced Roman to tears
It's pathetic
Gale bolts after Dewey
: - The wind rushes past the camera
huge panoramic view of hangs in the sky
coyote howls in the near distance
: '  - nice low ranch tucked away in the valley
Dewey rolls up Jennifer's driveway in his truck
Gale follows behind in her
(noticing Gale) Stop following me
happen to work for the police god dammit
You're not a detective
Neither are you, Magnum
Gale, your engine's still running
Fuck
Dewey shakes his head in disgust, disappears into the house
Gale runs back to shut off her car
From out of the bushes lunges -- , loaded off his ass, still holding a half-filled bottle of in his hand
Gale Weathers
What a surprise
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual
That's a shocker
Hey  really liked that piece you did on me last month
The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how  faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket
Heh, well, that's  journalism for ya
Stage the news to boost ratings
Really, cause that stunt lost me the lead role in Roman Polanski's latest picture
Huh, what a coincide  was picked up by Roman Bridger
Well, not exactly the Roman  wanted
Get my point
3 is bullshit
Fuck, because of your big mouth 'm here, drinking piss water  with Second rate fucking celebrities like Jennifer Jollie and yourself
(a beat, subtle) Hey,  just got an idea
Maybe  should Have a look at your break line
That your car over there
Gale pushes Tom's chest
Stopping him
think we should go inside
have to have a talk with the cast
(laughs) You mean what's left of us
(tosses empty bottle aside) Yeah 'm running on empty anyways
Gotta refuel
Tom and Gale walk into the house
Something stirs in the bushes
: '  - Gale and Tom enter
Jennifer is crying hysterically in Dewey's arms
She sees Gale, looks up with anger written all over her gaudy, over rouged face, her make-up running in a comical, almost homage to Mimi on the Drew Carey Show
You
How can  ever get any fame playing you
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now
What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting
God damn you Gale Weathers
Don't you see
The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script
Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed
So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me
Wait a second, whoa
Calm down
Number one there were five different versions of the script given out
Ben Damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role
It only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script
And what,  die in  3
Everyone is silent
Dewey nods his head
Gale rips the script from Jennifer's hands
(reading script) This is complete bullshit
Who wrote this piece of crap
know right
It was kinda weak
That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it
The script was written by some new guy
He wrote Arlington Street
Still that was a much better movie, saw it at the premiere last week
God, what the hell am  getting sidetracked with this shit for
We've gotta get down to business
teary-eyed Angelina Tyler rises up from the couch, approaches the group
(crying) What are you talking about
Because of this shit 'll probably never act in a Hollywood film again
Tom throws his arm around Angelina, squeezes her tightly
Hey good looking, if you play your cards right, may be able to sit you down on my casting couch and try you out for a few films my  production company is working on
(a beat) How do you feel about a   remake
Angelina squeals in disgust, elbows Tom, racing out of the house
Tom groans, follows after her
'll be right back
: '  - Tom walks out into the darkness, looks around
Angelina's nowherein sight
(calling out) Angelina
Hey
Where the hell are you
was only playing
Hey look,  can really get you a bit part
Just come on out
Ok
(pauses) Damn it
There goes my chances of getting some head from her
Tom whips out a joint, pops it in his mouth
He lights it, walks around the side of the house
noise catches his attention
low, muffled squealing
Aaaangelina
Tom turns to a guest house
The door is half open, darkness  spilling out
Tom smirks, steps inside
: - The entire small interior of the   / '  ' Tom cockily waltzes about, not noticing one of the black shadows peeling off the wall
'
Angelina
Tom stops in his tracks
He looks down
Lying in a pool of blood at his feet is
Tom screams, staggers backwards right into the arms of -- -- You fucker
The  slashes open Tom's arm
Tom screams, backs up into the kitchen
The ghost grabs him by the throat, begins choking him mid-air
He slowly begins to lift him off his feet, angling the knife, readying to make the kill blow
Tom gags
He can't even scream, the killer's crushing his voice-box, causing a trickle of blood down his lips
(gagging) Fucker
brings the knife down, piercing Tom's heart, pinning him to the closet
Tom kicks around for a moment before finally going limp
The steps back, admiring his work
: '  - Jennifer, Gale, and Dewey are pacing around nervously
Shit
Where the hell are Tom and Angelina
don't know
Screw them
Look, what's important is that we stick together
No matter what
If anyone is next it's you or me Jen
What about Sidney
What about her
Suddenly, a knock at the door
The three are startled
Dewey looks at the front door
Ssh
Maybe it's Tom or Angelina
'll get it
What if it's the killer
Oh use your brain drama queen
Do the killers ever knock on the fucking door
Ever see Jason do that before burying an axe in some big titted blonde's head
Or maybe Michael or Chucky
Huh
Jennifer sticks her tongue out at Gale
Dewey reaches into a holster tucked away under his jacket, drawing up his 9mm
Don't worry
'm prepared for anything
Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door
Dewey nods his head, slowly makes his way towards the door
Gale and Jennifer huddle together, follow close behind
Do you smell something
(smirking) It's Gale
She farts when she gets nervous
Gale makes an angry face, slaps Dewey upside the back of his headplay fully
Dewey steps up to the front door
'
He reaches for the knob, turns it when suddenly -- Alright don't panic
Just a fuse
Dewey throws open the door
'  drops into the doorway Hurry
Everyone out the back way
Now
Dewey, Gale, and Jennifer race for the French doors in the living room leading outside to the pool and backyard
somewhere in the house
Who's phone
Oh shit it's my cell
Answer it
Jennifer answers her cellular
(into phone) Hello
Hello Jennifer
Wanna play a little game
It's him
It's the killer
Gale rips the phone out of Jennifer's hands
(into phone) Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want
What's your favorite scary movie Gale
dunno but  can tell you that your's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass
Now come out and fight like a real man you pussy
(
) just might
comes running out of closet, knife swinging wildly
Jennifer screams, races for the patio door
The ghost lunges for Gale
Dewey draws up his gun, fires
The  takes six slugs In the chest
He goes smashing through a coffee table, motionless
Dewey backs into Gale's arms, smoke rising fromthe muzzle of the gun
God damn it you two
Run
Hurry
He's dead
No
He's not dead
He's still breathing
Look
Gale he's dead
Come on
Let's get out of here
Dewey turns Gale towards the patio door
noise
Dewey pauses, turns around -- Dewey looks to the patio door
-- What
(screaming) The ghost barrels out from under the couch, knife raised
Dewey winds back, kicks a chair out in the Ghost's path
The ghost trips, goes crashing through the chair, coming smashing down onto the floor, knife burying into the hardwood
Dewey and Gale run for the patio when suddenly -- comes dodging out of the kitchen wielding a butcher knife
(screaming) Jennifer slips on something, goes backflipping to the ground
Gale grabs her
Helps her up
Come on
comes to life, grabbing a lighter off an end table
He lights  a trail of gasoline, running from the floor to the kitchen (i
e
the smell Jennifer mentioned earlier and what she slipped on seconds ago)
flame trail lunges towards the two women
They scream
: - '  - Jennifer, Gale, and Dewey take off out the patio doors when suddenly -
The three dive into the swimming pool as debris rains down onto the Earth
-- ,
, : - '
:"  " : '  - paces around his room
battered and bruised Dewey and Gale sit beside his desk in Police Uniforms (since their old clothes has obviously been drenched)
Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher
mean, they even told Sidney how they did it
Yeah, but, if 'm not mistaken, you said in your book that Sidney got it wrong before
She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother, and he was sent away for it
Maybe there is a third killer
Sidney Might know something Kincaid's eyes appear as if questioning Dewey
told you,  don't know where Sidney is
And even if there was a third killer, Sidney doesn't know about it
That is for me to decide
need to talk to her Mr
Riley, she is a key element in this case
have a press conference in an hour, and  need to explain why there are four dead celebrities
Four
There are five
Ben Damon
Christine Perkins
Sarah Darling
Tom Prinze
That's four, last time  learned how to count
What about Angelina Tyler
She was there too
Police are still searching through the debris
Could be days before we find her
that is, if she's even there
Kincaid seems to be getting a morbid charge out of all of this
He smirks ever so nefariously at Dewey
, look
We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'
What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott
Actually, there was more this time
This time, we found a picture too
/ (together) What
Kincaid holds up a second ziplocked evidence bag
Within is a blurry 5x4 of exiting a motel room with
Kincaid turns it over
Also, written on it's back is '  ' Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture,  , is out of the country on business
His alibi checks out
Seems he's got a  show in Australia, 100%
It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point
What does this have to do with Sid
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter
Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen
(chiming in) What's your problem
Last night you were almost charcoal
You gonna help us or what
Do you wanna have this conversation with a polygraph
Is that a threat, Detective
When it's a threat, you'll know it
(a beat) Is that a threat
Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later
The issue is Maureen Prescott
Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott
And either Mr
Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her
So, where is she
: -   - Dewey is on his cell phone
'  (
) (off phone) Hi, you've reached the machine
Leave a message, talk as long as you'd like
Sid it's me, this is the sixth time 've called
(Sid turns the corner, is ushered down the hall by a cop) Please pick up,  wanna make sure you're Okay
(Dewey notices Sidney approaching him) Sid
The two run into each other's arms, embrace tightly
What are you doing here
told you to stay hidden
It's not safe for you up here
Well it's not safe for me up there either
The killer found me Dewey
He called me last night
What
figured 'd be safe If  was at least up here with the people  care about
(a beat) Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about
found this place from a 5
Heh
Follow me
Dewey walks Sid into Kincaid's office
'  - Detective Kincaid
What Rielly
There's someone here who wants to help
Oh my God
Sidney, you ran fast or what
Hey
Hi, Gale
'm glad you're all right
For a change, instead of an exchange of fists, the two share a warm hug
Thank you
Sid, this is detective Kincaid
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney
The killer called her
What
When
What'd he say
Oh, you know, the usual small talk, "What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die
" Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner
Did you call her from the set
No
Do you have her number stored in your memory
(Dewey thinks) Phone memory
Oh
Yeah,  guess  do
Has anyone else every used your phone
Just Jennifer
(To Kincaid_) And you
Hey, 'm the cop here
You're in my office, Riley
Sidney notices the clippings and the photograph of Maureen
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney
Recently he's also left a photo of your mother
Why didn't you tell me
This is my mother, Dewey
Why didn't you say something
was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding
Listen, Detective,  wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down
Are you sure
Absolutely
: - Kincaid and Dewey's cars drive through the lot
They drive over towards a row of trailers, park
disappears to do something else while , , and Sidney get out of Dewey's truck
Alright Sid, over there is the  3 Production offices
That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night
Mm, what a waste of Silicone
(a beat) What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey
We're a long way from Woodsboro
figure lunges out of nowhere, startling all three of them
It's a young, scrawny goth girl in  heavy make-up
This is  , 22
She holds something in her hand, a video tape marked   101
Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me
What are you doing here
Who's this
Karen Colcheck
From Woodsboro
She was Randy's only girlfriend
ever
(smiling) That's me
First and Last
Sidney hugs Karen
So does Dewey
It's been a while
You still working at Bradley's
Nope
They opened up a Hollywood Video down the street
It pays better
Anyway, 'm here because  heard on the news about the murders and well,  found this while rooting through Randy's things
Karen holds up the video
: -
-- ,       1 and 2 Told you 'd make a movie someday, huh
: -   - Sidney, Gale, Karen, and Dewey are gathered around the inside of the small, cramped trailer watching the tape
Oh  god
Well, if you're watching this tape, it means as  feared,  did not survive these killings here at Windsor College
Anyway, the reason am here is to help you, so that my death will not be in vain
That my life's work, will help save some other poor soul from getting mutilated
If this killer does come back, and he's for real, there are a few things that you gotta remember
Is this simply another sequel
Well, if it is, same rules apply
But, here's the critical thing
If you find yourself dealing with an unexpected backstory, and a preponderance of exposition,  then the sequel rules do not apply
Because you are not dealing with a sequel, you are dealing with the concluding chapter of a trilogy
trilogy
That's right
It's a rarity in the horror field, but it does exist, and it's a force to be reckoned with, because true trilogies are all about going back to the beginning and discovering something that wasn't true from the get go
'Godfather', 'Jedi', all revealed something that we thought was true, that wasn't true
So if it is a trilogy you are dealing with, here are some super trilogy rules
One, you got a killer who's gonna be super human
Stabbing him won't work, shooting him won't work, basically in the third one, you gotta cryogenically freeze his head, decapitate him, or blow him up
Number two; anyone including the main character can die
This means you, Sid
'm sorry, it's the final chapter
It can be fuckin  'Reservoir Dogs' by the time this thing is through
Number three; the past will come back to bite you in the ass
Whatever you think you know about the past, forget it
The past is not at rest, any sins you think were committed in the past are about to break out and destroy you ,Never, ever under any circumstances go running off by yourself, cause if Friday the 13th has taught us anything, it's that the next time we're gonna see you, you're gonna have a fence post jutting out from your back
So in closing, let me say good luck, God Speed, and for some of you, 'll see you soon, cause the rules say, some of you ain't gonna make it
didn't, not if you're watching this tape
: - Sidney and Karen are hugging
Thanks Karen
You be careful
Don't worry Sid
got tickets to see Family Feud
did have a somewhat ulterior motive for driving all the way down here
Karen smiles
She hugs Sidney one more time, scampers away
've got an idea, 'll hook up with you guys later
Do you want us to come with you
work better alone
Why don't you do some snooping around the set
Gale runs off
can see nothing's changed
No
: - Gale's banging on the door trying to gain access
Nobody home
Gale notices the card lock and the sign reading  '  '
Gale smiles
Since when has this ever stopped her before
She reaches into her pocket book, pulling out a couple of credit cards, a video store card, etc
She tries them in the lock
hand reaches down, grabs Gale from behind
She lets outa blood curdling scream
It's only
Geez
What the hell are you doing
Being Gale Weathers
What the hell are you doing
am Gale Weathers
Here's how  see it
've got no house, no movie, no gun, and 'm being stalked
Because someone wants to kill me
No, because someone wants to kill you
So now, starting now,  go where you go
That way, if someone wants to kill me, 'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you
Make sense
None
You know in the movies,  play you as being much smarter
And as a sane person
For you that must be quite a stretch
That's funny
Ha
Maybe  should join
Need to get in that building
(sarcastically) No really
There a story in that building
Possibly
(flashing a Sunrise Studios Key Card) Gale Weathers would find a way
(she swipes and opens the door) Jennifer opens the door, steps in first
Gale follows, door closing ominously behind them with a loud
: -  - Gale leads the way down the dark hall
Basements creep me out
Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview
Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic
Look who's talking Moneybags
You got more homes than  do
(smiling) Oh  wish  got that one on tape
It'd put a smile on my face everytime 'm down
(underbreath) Bitch
The two turn the corner, stepping into - -  - , an aging, former actress in her late forties, early fifties, sits behind a desk doing paperwork
Sensing someone else's presence she stops what she is doing and looks up at Gale and Jennifer
Can  help you
'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for
Maybe you've heard of me
Bianca shakes her head "no"
don't watch  and  hate books
Whatta you need
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you
Nope
(groans) Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you
Gale reaches into her pocket, slams down the picture of Sid's mom on Bianca's desk
Bianca looks up, totally unenthused
Listen, 'm busy
Nobody has access to those files except studio execs
Can you please go away now
Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president
Gale slaps a twenty dollar bill on the desk
Bianca looks up, a bit insulted, slides the money back
The president
of the studio
Twenty dollars
Who are you Nancy Drew
Jennifer turns to Bianca, slides off her ring
She slams the ring onto the desk
It's absolutely stunning
Go ahead
It's worth three grand easy
(to Gale) My Gale Weather's will stop at nothing to get the story
How can Bianca resist
She smiles, takes the ring, slips it on her finger
Follow me
Gale reaches for her Twenty
Bianca slaps her hand, takes it, folding it up, sliding it between her cleavage
: -  - (staring at picture, flipping through file cabinet) know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor  suppose, myself included
If you're looking for Maureen Prescott -- (interrupting) It may be Maureen Reynolds -- Well you'll find neither
Rina Reynolds, however, You will
(smiling) Rina Reynolds
What a stage name
You should talk, Judy Jurgenstein
Gale takes the folder from Bianca, opens it up
Inside are 8x10 headshots of when she was younger
Behind the pictures is a Xeroxed listing of the films she's starred in
What are these movies
'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'
Horror flicks
-Movies from Milton's heyday
/ (together) What
You know,  , the horror producer
Those were some of his early flicks
: -   - Sidney stands beside Dewey and Detective Wallace
Listen Dewey  have to go to the bathroom
Do you want me to come with you Sid
mean, remember what Randy said
No 'll be ok
've got my mace
My knife
(smiles, raises up her fists) These two lethal weapons
Sure you don't need a police escort
That's what we're here for
No really, 'll be fine
Dewey and Wallace nod
Sid begins to walk towards the soundstage
'll be right back
: -   - Sidney stands at the sink washing her face
She shuts off the water reaches for a paper towel when suddenly, something catches her ear
Almost as if a man's whisperedher name 'Siiiiiddney'
Sid turns around, stares at the empty bathroom
-hello
Anyone there
Silence
Sid reaches into her pocket book, draws out a Gravity Knife
She flips open the blade, crouches down on her knees, scanning the row of stalls for feet
What a relief
none
Sid smiles, dismisses what she thought she heard when she sees -- Sidney goes back to drying her face when suddenly -- (
) (whisper) Sidney
This time it's apparent
There's somebody else in the bathroom
Sid begins to make her way towards the bathroom door when suddenly -- door flies open
charging out at full-force
Sid hits the deck, sliding across the floor, deflecting the blow from the knife as the killer buries it into the sink counter
Sid races for the door, killer hot on her trail
-- The storage closet door flies open and a second  comes charging out, knife gleaming
He dives for Sid
Sid takes up her knife, buries it in her attacker's shoulder
The  goes reeling back into the closet
Sidney slams the door closed on him
She dives for the door knob when suddenly, the first ghost comes running back at her
She ducks as he swings his knife, burying it into the bathroom door
Sid bolts across the bathroom towards a tiny window in the far corner of the ceiling
Using the trash as a booster, she leaps up, slides open the window, and dives out, just as the deadly pair of attackers come back for more
: - Sidney comes charging around the corner of the soundstage building
She looks up, realizing she's just ran herself into a dead end
(crying) Shit
An exit door flies open
The  comes charging out
Sidney screams, runs for a wooden fence
She begins to scale it, dropping over on the other side just as the killer pierces through it with his knife
Sid takes off running for  and
, , spin around, drawing out their guns
Wallace looks at Dewey
(re:gun) Don't worry, 've got a permit for it
(hysterical) Jesus Christ Dewey help me
They tried to kill me in the bathroom
The killers
Wait a second
Killers
There's two of them now
Aw shit
Wallace whips out his cellular, dials a number
Sidney falls into Dewey's arms, collapsing like a house of cards, crying hysterically
(into phone) Yeah this is Wallace
We got a problem   down here on the Sunrise Studios lot
No not another one
At least not yet
Yeah we've had an attack
(to Sid) Do you need medical assistance
(Sid nods her head 'no') No
Oh really
Alright, see you in a minute
Wallace closes up his phone
What
Well  got some good news in a way
Roman Bridger didn't make those calls To Sarah Darling
Police let him go
Here's the bad news: The cellular was cloned, it's untraceable
We now have no suspects
(
) Dew
Dewey and Sidney turn around to see an excited Jennifer   and Gale race into frame
Sidney, what happened
Nevermind, what'd you two find
We did some researching in the archives
Sid, something dawned on me when  wrote the book on your mother's murder
For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth
What are you talking about
We've found out where she went
She was an actress Sidney
Minor -Movies
But now we have a new suspect in this twisted fucking web
John Milton
The head of the studio
It makes sense doesn't it
It's his big grandiose swan song from the genre
What a better way to end than with a bloodbath
Sidney, what happened
was attacked in the bathroom
Wallace, shouldn't you be investigating the bathroom
(looks at building) 'm waiting for back-up
don't carry bullets in my gun unless  know 'm gonna use em
Dewey nods suspiciously
Kincaid comes rushing into  frame
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened
got a call on my cell from home
They told me that someone was attacked
And what made you think it was Sidney
(glaring) Sid, get in my car
You're coming back to the station with me where it's safe
Dewey, Jennifer,  think we should pay John Milton a little visit
/ (together) Agreed
: '  - Milton's on the phone with Roman
(into phone) Roman  know you're upset
But there will be other movies
know
Ah,  called you a Pariah
Well fuck them
got a great script on my desk
It's called and it was written by John Sayles
'm thinking you for Director
What
(knock at the door) Come in
(into phone) No, not to you Roman
Look 'll talk to you later
Bye
Milton hangs up as Gale, Jennifer, and Dewey barge intohis office
So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother
Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this
've got important calls to make
run this studio
Answer the question
You knew Sidney's mom
Who
Rina Reynolds
Do you know how many actors have worked for me
Hundreds, thousands
Nobody said she was an actor
Good twist
What's your point
No point, 'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call
remember her
She was a bit player in a couple of my movies
nobody
So what does it matter
Oh, Come on
You have made millions off the story of her murder
You're obsessed with  and you're obsessed with her
Settle down Beavis
(to Milton) Why don't you tell us the truth
What the hell are you guys getting at
make horror films, that's what  do
The Studio came to me with 'Stab'
They came to me, check it out
But you know who she was
When we did the first 'Stab"  realized 'd known Maureen Prescott before,  mean as Rina
couldn't tell anyone
Can you imagine the press
And now
mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing
Get real, that would make me a suspect
Just because you knew her
Yeah
don't think so
Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood
Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go
It's dead and buried
Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago
Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National
Why don't you start talking
It was in the 70's, everything was different
was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were
It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression
Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards
Are you saying she was- 'm saying things got out of hand
Maybe they did take advantage of her
Maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence
No charges were brought
And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds wouldn't play by the rules
You wanna get ahead in Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home
: '  - Kincaid stands at his desk trying to put the pieces of this puzzle together
Sidney's seated beside him, staring at a stack of books on '  and '
What do you know about trilogies
You mean like, movie trilogies
You seem to like movies, Detective
Call me Mark, would you
Cause 'm gonna keep calling you Sidney
'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective
All  know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off
(noticing a huge file on her) Did you request this case
No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business
grew up here, and  know my way around the studios
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people
To me Hollywood is about death
Excuse me
'm a homicide detective, remember
When you see what  see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted
think you know about that
What do you mean
know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away
To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone
Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts
Can't arrest ghosts
But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people
You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott
Hmm
What did you know about your mother
used to think  had the perfect mom, perfect family
Till  found out  was wrong
She had a secret life, and  tried to understand that, and soon as  thought  had, more secrets
don't' know who my mom was
(a beat) Sometimes  feel like 'm just learning about my mother for the first time
You know, with  and those movies and what not
God sometimes  feel like 'm just learning about myself for the first time
Like 'm watching my life instead of living in it
(a long beat) Here's the deal, 'm off to search the soundstage
That's good news
How is that good news
Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer
And  know how to handle guys like that
Oh yeah, how
Catch him, or kill him
Kincaid readies himself to leave
He snags up his holstered gun, his car keys, jacket, etc
Hey Detective
What's your favorite scary movie
Detective Kincaid pauses, he leans over Sidney's chair, his penetrating eyes glaring right into hers
(sotto) My life
Kincaid exits, door slamming shut behind him
beat, then -- Mine too
: - '  - Milton steps out of his office into his reception area
Secretary's gone for the night
Milton starts out of the office, disappears
The door creaks open
Gale, Jennifer, and Dewey emerge from the darkness
Jennifer is gagging
Oh God Gale, Dewey was right
Stop getting so nervous and you might stop causing me to gag
/ (together) Jennifer's quiet
think Milton's the killer
think he just went out to kill another cast member
Milton's not a killer
He's a pervert
He probably went out to buy more   for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino
(smacks her forehead out of frustration) Do you get any of my witty humor
mean, you did play me for three movies
(a beat) His two hands, dingus
Ssh ladies
Dewey leans into Milton's office door, slowly opens it
Darkness spills out
The three disappear inside it
: -  - Milton's walking down the hallway
It's dark
Desolate
tracks along the paisley velvet carpet as a phone rings
' '
He answers it, pushes the elevator 'up' button anxiously
(into phone) John Milton
Wanna play a game
Who is this
You tell me
You bankrolled three  movies about me
It's you
The saboteur whose been fucking up my movie
(a beat) swear to God if you don't stop 'll find you and have you killed
shut down production on that piece of shit  3
We had a no talent director and the lousiest Sidney Prescott on the planet but that was besides the point
You still killed  movie
John Milton film
And if you ever try and cross me again you'll be sorry
My next movie is gonna be a grandiose step up from this slasher shit
It's a film written and directed by John Sayles
Milton's going rapid fire
Oh poor John
There's not gonna be another film
Well, at least not for you
with a ping
flash of silver and in an instant, John's throat is slashed open, spilling blood
His corpse thuds to the ground
pair of gloved hands drag him into the elevator
moments pause and then-- storms out, disappearing down the hall
'
: '  - Gale's trying to get a locked drawer on Milton's desk open
It won't budge
Dewey steps into frame, flashlight in hand
He shines the light down on the lock
Hold on Gale, 'm a pro at this
Dewey leans in, bumping his head with Gale's
Oh Dewey 'm sorry
The two look at each other and smile
Dewey laughs sweetly
Gale reaches up, rubs his head
Here
Let me -- , chimes in
Clearly annoyed
Excuse me Gale
What the hell do you think you're doing
Gale and Dewey can't help gazing into each other's eyes
In an instant it almost seems as if a long lost love has been sparked back to life
(shaking it off) Let's get this drawer open
If it's locked, there must be something inside he's trying to hide
Dewey takes the butt of the flashlight, brings it down  hard on the locked drawer
The lock's smashed off
Shit
That's gonna leave a mark
Gale slides open the drawer, reaches in
She pulls up a manilla folder
Dewey shines the light on the folder as Gale opens it up and reads what's inside
What
What'd you find
Gale's eyes widen
Paternity test results
Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is
Who is it
(nervously) Guys
got a bad feeling
/ (angrily, together) Guys there's someone else in the fucking room
Huh
Dewey and Gale look up and scream as -- rushes out of the shadows
Jennifer bolts for the door
The jams his knife in her back
She lets out a blood curdling death scream, drops to the floor motionless
and  share a terrified scream
The killer wipes his blade clean, lunges for them
(frantic) Gale run
Dewey jumps in the killer's path
The killer winds back, cracks the base of the knife across Dewey's skull
Dewey drops to the floor unmoving
(screaming) Dewey
The Killer's blade glistens in the moonlight
He charges for Gale
Gale screams, races out of the office door, slamming it closed on the killer sending him flying onto his back
: -  - Gale races down the hallway, frantically trying every door she passes
All of them locked
She reaches the elevator, hits the "down" button
The door opens with a ping
Gale unleashes a horrendous scream -- -- --has been strung up from the ceiling ventilation duct, gutted from knob to gullet
His entrails lie in steaming heaps at his feet
staggers away from the elevator, speechless
She screams again
is coming straight for her
fakes out the killer, dives into the elevator
He runs ahead, briefly, giving Gale enough time to trip him sending him landing flat on his face
Gale races out of the elevator doubles back down the hallway towards a door marked "stairs"
She bolts through the door
: -  - Gale races down the stairs, nearly tripping and falling
She races out onto the ground floor
: - Gale races out of the office building
car horn blares
She screams
jams on his breaks, gets out his car
He draws up his gun
Jesus Gale what happened
(frantic) He killed Milton
The killer's  inside there
Oh God
(realizing) Dewey's in there too
He needs medical help
He's hurt
Alright, calm down
'm going to radio in for backup right now
(
) Not so fast
We're not finished
Kincaid spins around
Gale screams
The  comes charging out of nowhere, slashes open Kincaid's throat, stabs him in the chest
Kincaid drops onto the hood of his car, dead
pauses
She's screaming hysterically
The killer raises the knife menacingly
wouldn't run if  were you Gale
It's only gonna end up with you getting Skewered like a fucking pig
need you
(nervously) Awfully late time to be doing an interview
need you as bait
For Sidney
Gale closes her eyes, cries as the killer stalks towards her
: '  - Sidney sits in Kincaid's office flipping through the folder marked ' ' It's loaded with newspaper articles and police reports and is basically a scrapbook of obsession
Sidney smirks
Kincaid has drawn little magic marker hearts around a picture of her
She's awakened from her daydream
The phone rings
Sid answers it
(into phone) Hello
' (
) (off phone) Hello
Who is this
(
) Who is this
Um wh-who's calling
(
) Um wh-who's calling
Gale, Dewey, whoever, um, call me back, can only hear myself
{ a click } only her you too, Sidney
Who is this
The question isn't who  am
The question is, who's with me
(screaming) Sidney, stay away
Sid's face floods with fear
She rushes towards the office door when suddenly, the voice draws her back, angrily and cautioning
Don't do it
If you do one thing to attract attention, one thing, 'll kill them both
Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone
Yes
Go there
Sidney stands up, goes into an inner office, Wallace's
Always hard being friends with you, Sidney
When you're friends with Sidney, you die
Well these friends don't have to, Sidney
It's up to you
How do  know their voices are -- Are real
How do you know you're not hearing things
How do you know 'm not someone in your head
Somewhere, you know
(frantic) Don't come here Sidney
We hear the killer haul back and hit Dewey hard
Dewey
No
Or do you
You're dead
don't want them,  want you
It's simple
You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die
Oh God
Oh God
Don't you want to know Sidney
Don't you want to know who killed her
Don't you want to know who killed your mother
(
) Have you seen Kincaid
2(
) But Wallace is around
Where
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together
'll call you, when you're on your way
Click
The killer hangs up
Sidney breaks down crying
Fuck
Wallace's keys rest on his desk
Sid ponders, takes them
She stands up when something inside her makes her open Wallace's drawer and dig around
She pulls up a fully loaded handgun
That's the ticket
She closes the drawer, slinks out the side exit
: '  - Sid speeds through rain-slicked streets
Her cellular rings
(into phone) Yeah
You follow directions good
Now let's wrap this production
Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot
'll call you when you get there
Click
The killer hangs up
: - Sid parks Wallace's car alongside the studio gates
She gets out, stands on the hood of the car, begins to scale the wrought-iron fence
: -   - Sidney creeps through the darkened, abandon lot
Again, her cellular rings
Again, she answers it
(into phone) Alright, 'm here
Now what
You're doing real good
Can't you figure it out
wanna finish this where it all began
Woodsboro
thought you wanted me here
Click the killer hangs up
Sid pockets her phone
She looks up, and is startled out of fright
Posted alongside the sound stageis a huge production poster for  3 with a life-size  wielding a big knife
Sid knows she's in the right place
The door leading inside is half-open
Sid taps the holstered gun, slowly steps into the darkness
: 3  - Sidney enters
She pauses
As a million things rush through her mind
To her this is like the ultimate return
Everything appears as she last remembers
Sid steps through the dark sets
Her phone rings
She answers it
(into phone) Alright 'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this
It's good to see you again Sidney
was growing real impatient
Go ahead
Explore
'll catch up with you later
The killer hangs up
Sid pockets the phone
She walks past the set
Instead of a foam  body dangling from the doggy door, it's ' Sidney flinches, covers her eyes
She walks on
-  - Sid steps through the living room of the  set
It mirrors the house perfectly
Everything from the shattered patio door to the burnt Jiffy Pop is there
Sid's phone rings
She answers it
Yeah
(
) (off phone) Help me Sid
The killer's got me
Dewey
Where are you
(
) Sid  can see you
Where are you Dewey
(
) 'm out back
Tied up
Hurry Sid
The killer's looking for you
Quick untie me
Sid bolts through the shattered patio door out onto the backyard set
Seated before a heated in ground pool, tied to a patio chair, beaten and gagged, is He's unconscious and almost appears at first glance like from
Sid's jaw drops
This can't be possible
She looks down at the phone
(
) Good work Sid
Sid screams, dropping the phone out of fright
She turns around coming face to face with -- in the patio doorway
monstrous version of the voice-changing box in hand
He raises up the box, clicks a button and speaks
(Sid's voice) You play a good game Sidney
Now it's time to get down to business
Who are you
(click-now he's Maureen's voice) Your other half
The  rushes Sid
She screams, takes off running
She bolts across the darkened set, running straight up the front porch of a mock-up of her own childhood home
She swings open the front door, slams it closed
-  - Sid locks and bolts the front door
She backs away from it as the killer begins to pounce against it, struggling to get inside
Sid hears something upstairs
Like muffled cries
She races up to investigate
: '  -  - Sid enters the set of her bedroom, slowly drawing out the gun she stole from Kincaid's office
on the bed, bound and gagged, is -- Sid races over, removes the gag from Gale's mouth
Christ Sidney hurry up
That fucking lunatic is coming
Sid fumbles with the bindings, manages to untie Gale
Gale sits up
Gale he's got Dewey
know
He killed Kincaid
know
Let's get out of here
(screaming) -
The  launches himself through the upstairs window
Gale and Sidney bolt for the bedroom door, killer hot on their tails
: -- Dewey comes around
He lets his head loll for a moment before finally beginning to pull and tug on his bindings
on Dewey freeing one of his hands from the heavy duct tape
: '  -    - Gale and Sidney run into the master bedroom set, slamming the door shut and locking it
Sid looks around, her head already swimming from the chaos outside
However, what's inside utterly horrifies her
The walls, the furniture and the bed are splattered with blood
On the bed lies a corpse in a black rubber body bag (supposedly Maureen's body)
The door buckles under the killer's blows
Gale and Sidney scream
They can't hold out much longer
Jesus Christ Sidney get out of here
He can't get us both
knife splinters through the door, inches from Gale's face
She screams
Sid backs away, hysterical
She raises up the gun, fires into the door
Gale ducks out of the way
Silence
The door ceases to move
-- and the second  emerges, knife in hand
The girls utter horrified screams
Sid raises up the gun, goes to fire when suddenly -- The bedroom door's kicked down and the other killer enters, grabbing Sid by her shoulders, batting the gun from her hands
Sid screams, punches her attacker in the chest
He winces
The second Ghost grabs Gale, holds the knife to her throat, stopping her in her tracks
Sid makes a beeline for the window, leaps through the glass
Sid comes flying out onto the patio awning
She rolls over onto the astro-turf grass, momentarily motionless
And then she comes to
Her eyes flickering open, blurrily staring up at -- , leering out the shattered window frame
stands up, takes off running towards -- : -    - Sid races into the foyer, slams the door closed behind her
Again, locking and bolting it
She looks around, everything is once again the same as it was in Woodsboro
This is where the climax of the original battle between good and evil wasfought
It's dejr vu all over again
Footsteps
(
) (weakly) Sidney
Sidney turns around -- staggers through the living room doorway, gun in hand
(eyes lighting up) Dewey
Sidney embraces Dewey
Where's Gale
They've got her
Sid  want you to stay here
'll be right back
'm not gonna let them get Gale
Dewey unlocks the front door, swings it open
across the set is  , knife raised
(tightening grip on gun) Hold it right there you fucker
Dewey goes to fire
Out of bullets
(nervously) shit
winds back, launches the knife
It swirls through space before embedding into Dewey's arm, launching him back through the doorway
Sidney screams
Dewey's unconscious again
The  races for the open door
Sid screams, kicks it closed
Locking and bolting it again
crash
Sid turns around -- rolls down the staircase, covered in blood
It comes to a halt at Sidney's feet, an unmoving, rumpled figure
'
She's been brutally stabbed
(crying) Oh God
'
on her lips
She pulls out a gun, aims it at Sidney's face
Time to sort things out
Whatta you say
: -  - Angelina walks Sidney into the living room at gunpoint
Gale's been handcuffed and tossed onto the couch
-- of   plays
It's you
All of this is because of you
No
Not all of it
Sid, someone really wants to meet you
Sid tries to run, Angelina trains the gun on her
Causing her to stop in her tracks
Uh-un Sid
You're not gonna run off
Not now
(
) You're not going anywhere Sidney
It's time you came to terms with me, and with mother
Maybe you never knew her at all, Sid
Maybe you can't get past the surface of things
The  enters frame, ripping open his costume to reveal a  bullet proof vest
Who the hell are you
The other half of you
searched for a mother too, an actress named Rina Reynolds
tried to find her my whole life
And four years ago  actually tracked her down, knocked on her door, thinking she'd welcome me back with open arms, but she had a new life and a new name, Maureen Prescott
You were the only child she claimed Sidney
She shut me out in the cold forever, her own son
rips off his mask
'
Sidney's deathly quiet
Roman Bridger, director
And brother
(a beat) She slammed the door in my face, Sid
Said  was Rina's child and Rina was dead
And it struck me, what a good idea
So  watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film
Seems Maureen, mom, really got around
mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key
Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies
Didn't like it at all
And once  supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers
Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie
All the nightmares
All the hell  went through was because of you, you spineless bastard
'm a director Sid,  direct
For example, Angelina over there, (Angelina smiles) She's my partner
can convince her to do anything
We've been dating since  met her in Woodsboro
(dryly) Oh my God, Angie Crick
From English class
That's me Sid
always idolized you
You were always my hero
That's why 'm here Sidney
wanted to make you proud
And  kinda keep her around cause it's a bit of a turn-on
You know, in the movies she's you Sid, so every time  jump her bones, 'm doing , technically
(repulsed) Listen,  have no time for this
've heard this shit before
So lets get on with it
Wait a second Sid
Don't you go jumping the gun
You haven't seen the best part
(pulls out tape recorder) With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice
(presses play) Ain't it cool
Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body
(off tape recorder) can't take it anymore
This Hollywood exploitation of the nightmare  lived has to be stopped
did this to make you all repent for your sins, and now 'm pleased 've got my message across
Good-bye
Sid squirms
(clicking off tape recorder) Awesome
What'd  tell ya
Heh
Did youknow that John Milton, was my daddy
Yep, he's the one who fucked mommy dearest in the long run
His parties, his flings, exploited the Hollywood nobody
That's whyI had to make him pay
Daddy dearest is dead
Mommy's dead
Looks like 'm an orphan all alone in this world
What a good reason to -- Roman stabs himself in the arm
He screams, goes stagger back into Angelina's arms
See Sidney, as amateur as Billy and Stu were, they laid the groundwork for this
See Sidney, they also set the stage for you
Introducing to the world Sidney the victim
Sidney the survivor
Sidney the star
Roman continues stabbing himself
In the shoulder
In the side
In the leg
Bleeding and hazed, he hands the gore drenched knife to Angelina
See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it
The part where we win
Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win
Roman knock it off
Do you people even know why you kill people
You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason
(screaming) Roman make her stop
Make her stop baby she's freaking me out
(screaming) God damn it Sidney
Roman lunges at Sidney
Sid screams, takes off through the kitchen
Gale rolls herself off the couch
Angela runs over and kicks her in the ribs
(coughing) Hey bitch, don't ever use prop cuffs to restrain Gale Weathers
Gale pops off the handcuffs
(leaping up) know all the tricks
Gale barrels into Angelina, tackling her into the coffee table before she has a chance to move
Angelina struggles to raise her knife
-- , --chases Sid into the foyer
She races past the spot where Dewey fell earlier
He's gone
Roman jumps at her
Sid disappears into another room continues
, Continue the fight
Gale's slamming Angelina's head against the hardwood floor
Angelina swipes, slashing Gale along the side, deeply
Gale screams, begins to crawl away
She kicks Angelina in the face
Angelina drops the knife
Gale stands up, begins to back away
-- Comes rounding into the foyer again
Roman's right behind her
, The laundry room door swings open and the  emerges,  in hand
He buries the knife deep into Roman's chest, sending him flying backwards
Sidney screams
The ghost stops in his tracks, pulling off his mask -- '
He can barely stand up
He's bleeding profusely from his wounds
Dewey and Sid embrace
Dewey my God  thought you were dead
Don't worry Sid 'd never leave you like that
'
Sidney and Dewey race into -- -- Gale's got Angelina in a headlock, right beneath the
(screaming) Gale releases, leaps up, she pushes the  set down onto Angelina's head
Angelina screams, her body trembling from the electric shocks and high voltage
and  stand in the doorway, breathless
Gale approaches them
She and Dewey embrace tightly
's twitching corpse goes limp
, spots a gun on the mantle
She grabs it, cocks it
-- -- Sid looks down at Roman's corpse
Watch out Sid
Randy said the killer's always superhuman
He wasn't superhuman Dewey
He wasn't superhuman at all
rips through the air
comes racing out of the living room, face a blackened, Kentucky-fried mess
Everyone screams, one epic last scream
Sid raises up the gun, fires, hitting Angelina dead center between the eyes, sending a splash of blood and brain matter onto the wall behind her
Sid turns to Roman's lifeless body
-- (pissed) This shit is really getting repetitive, you know
scrunches up her face in anger, pulls the trigger '
Sid drops the gun, walks off set
: - The police, fire, and ems are all on the scene of the crime
Dewey's wheeled out of the studio on a stretcher, loaded into an ambulance
Gale's right beside him on a stretcher
She leans over, takes his hand
Gale,  know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again
The whole relationship thing
(smiles) Sure, why not
You did Save my life,Mr
Rielly
Dewey smiles
The two kiss feverishly
: exiting his car
He surveys the damage
Sid passes him
Jesus Christ what happened
leave for two seconds to take my kid to the doctor,  come back and it's the fucking
It was just something that's been itching to be completed for the past four years
guess so
Take care Detective
Give my regards to the wife and kids
Wallace nods his thanks as Sidney walks off through the studio gates, the sun rising overhead, as calm and as casually as if nothing's happened
, we crane up to an aerial looking down upon
