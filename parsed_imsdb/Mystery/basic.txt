Basic by Jamie Vanderbilt 27, 2000 : The sound of   slicing through the air
(
) Jesus, God
: An   as it soars over the thick
Lush and green only a day ago, the foliage below has been ripped to shreds
The kind of damage that can only be done by nature
:,  2 - 0630  - 32 , () -- Sitting next to the  is
Mid- 40's, normally gruff, but completely cowed by the damage below
The , unfazed
Hurricane Beth, huh
Had    an ex-wife named Beth, this is pretty   much par for the course
This area    got the worst of it,  hope these   guys are all intact- That's enough, Lieutenant
'
-  through the underbrush - ducking branches, pushing through bushes, splashing through streams
wheezes over the sound track
We're headed for a
() -- The Pilot pushes his stick forward, descending to tree level
Coming up on the pick-up
-- emerge from the underbrush at a run
The carrying the wounded   over his shoulder
Both in ragged army cadet fatigues - ripped, muddy, and bloody
The Bigger Man lowers the Smaller Man to the ground and unshoulders his -16
Face panicked
The sound of the  approaching
2
() -- The unmistakable    from below
Holy shit, that's live fire
As the Helicopter comes over the clearing, Styles and the Pilot squint down through the windscreen to see the Two Men, huddled together as   kick up  around them
Who's shooting at them- The Bigger Man raising his own his weapon and
The Smaller Man frantically waving the Helicopter down
can't see- Below, the Bigger Man still shooting and then he lowers his rifle and there's only
No return fire
And then Styles sees why
Lying by the treeline
Chest torn open by gunfire
Obviously dead
His clothes - the same fatigues the first two men are wearing
That was one of their own, he just Shot one of their own men- Who was trying to shoot them- Get us on the ground
-- As the Helicopter comes in for a landing, the Bigger Man kneels next to the Smaller Man, who bleeds from a bullet wound to the arm
His face, pale, sweating
The Bigger Man wipes the Smaller Man's brow and speaks softly and seriously
Are you ready for this
The Smaller Man nods
-- full on shit-kicking dive
Nearly empty, given the hour
plays the morning    news over the bar
Only two inhabitants - one a ,    the other the lone , smoking and picking at a plate    of criminally runny eggs
3
Tell the truth, Vic
You made these with a blender, right
He grins and we get our first good look at - Three day stubble, dark rings around his eyes, but a with strong jaw and steady voice
Not your average barfly
Somebody who maybe used to be somebody
Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me
You know that was like a quadruple negative
The Bartender takes the plate away from him
Can  at least have a drink
It's ten thirty in the morning
Yeah, if you've slept
You know the law - no liquor before noon
Could lose my license
Don't you mean "don't need no liquor license not taken away from me"
The Bartender smiles
Hurricane kept you up, too
Yeah, and  could've used the sleep
'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going
He stops, his attention suddenly on the
: is expected to announce the grand jury indictments in the Guissepe Torres police corruption case as early as tomorrow afternoon
Speculations abound that up to ten former homicide detectives could be named in the proceedings- 4
The Bartender turns the  off hastily
Embarrassed: Sorry
Hardy just looks away
The Bartender puts an empty glass down and fills it to the lip with bourbon
Hardy nods a "thank you" and reaches for the glass when the on his hip goes off
He checks the number
Bill Styles
Who
Old friend
Haven't talked to him in- 911
Can  use your phone
The Bartender hands him a cordless and Hardy dials
Hey, Bill, it's Tom
Long time no
whoa, whoa, slow down
Yeah
yeah, of course 'll come
An hour
He hangs up and hands the phone back to the Bartender
What was that
Hardy, obviously shaken by the call
gotta go out to McKinley
-- Establishing
sprawling five square mile compound nestled in the Louisiana backwoods
Also damaged by the Hurricane
loaded with emergency supplies land and take off,   work feverishly on damaged buildings, all while   complete morning drills around them
This is still a boot camp after all
: 1130  - --   -- Styles stands waiting nervously just beyond the with     - early 30's, attractive, close cropped hair and icy eyes
In the middle of protesting
5
This is totally unnecessary- He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman
But this guy you called, he's not even Army- He's former Army and the best 've ever seen in a room
Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here
(off her look) You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack
He's not Army, it's not official- Then it's unofficial
He takes a hit from an  , as a '71 drives through the gate and pulls up
Hardy emerges
(re: his appearance) Doesn't get any unofficialer than that
The two old friends embrace
How are you
Been better
(pause) read about what's been happening With you
should have called- What kind of trouble are you in
Styles looks at the ground
Momentarily flustered
That bad
Would  have called you if it wasn't
If there was any other way- 6
Tell me what  can do
You can get us some answers
Hardy takes off his sunglasses, noticing her
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, The closest thing we have to an in- House investigator
And here you are going out of house
How's that make you feel, Jules
Hostile and uncooperative
Fantastic
You want to tell me what's going on
-- Hardy follows Styles and Osborne
They pass replacing broken windows and sweeping up glass
The official term for it is "Clusterfuck"
By the time Beth hit us, 'd canceled all off base exercises save one - a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush
We're missing three and the Sergeant
The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names
But the Sergeant
It's not West, is it
Tell me it's not West
Styles' look tells him it is
Ah, Christ You knew Sergeant West
He was our Drill here
Man's older than sand
7
few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military
He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country
Well, he's a good soldier
Osborne nods, agreeing
didn't mean that as a compliment
Sergeant West's served for twenty- Three years
He's the public face of the modern Army
And you notice 'm not in the Army anymore
They round a corner
The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions"
Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning
And the problem is you only got three
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk
The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up
'm assuming that's what made him the dead one
Cadet Roberto
Nunez
Killed right in front of me
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup
If they're hurt and we can get to them in time
8
called the  Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to
On a transport leaving here at 1700- Which gives us about five hours
Why'd you call me
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop
And 'm the closest thing to it, right
Styles stops, turning to his friend
Tom, bottom line:  let those kids go out there
If  shows up and don't have any answers for them, my career is finished- 'm not gonna let that happen
Styles exhales, relieved
Thank you
Osborne will brief you on the cadets
And Tom
(half-smile) It really is good to see you
-- '  -- Osborne and Hardy enter, stepping over broken glass and hurricane debris
Hardy looks around
Gotta be honest,  love what you've Done with the place- You and the Colonel go back
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff
owe him
You're the Tom Hardy 've been reading about in the papers, right
New Orleans  fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres
9
It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording- Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, 'm not comfortable having you involved in this
Subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, Osborne
Osborne opens her mouth to reply but Hardy cuts her off
Three things
First - You don't have a choice
Second- 've never taken a bribe in my life
And Third - 'm still a little drunk from last night, so if  skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense
Tell me about the two guys
Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags
Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall- Levi
Who names their kid Levi- OSB0RNE Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio
Christ
Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone- Kendall Junior is still  in surgery, so he won't be available  to answer for his name or anything  else for another hour - the cadet  we're talking to first is Dunbar
He's in interrogation
Yes
Move him
10
Why
Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease
Is he cute
Excuse me
Is Dunbar cute
(pissed) That is the most unprofessional- Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight - these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute
Osborne stares at him
She finally nods
Thank you
At some point in there 'm gonna rub my nose
When  do, go at him with everything you got
Good cop/bad cop
Something like that
She starts to go make preparations
Oh, and Osborne
You have any donuts around here
--  -- As two
's escort   (the "Bigger Man") into 11
-- small cluttered room with the shades drawn
folding table has been set up in the middle of it with a chair on each side
Dunbar takes a seat in the far chair
Takes in his surroundings as the 's leave, locking the door
--  - Hardy and Osborne head towards the Coffee Room
questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound
You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you
, Ten bucks says  have him talking in under three minutes
Osborne starts the timer on her digital watch
Go
-- Dunbar looks up as they enter
Hardy smiles, cheerily
Cadet Dunbar, good morning
'm Tom Hardy and  believe you've already met Officer Osborne
understand you had a rough time of it last night
No response
Hardy takes a seat across from the cadet
Not talking, huh
You probably just want to get some food and some sleep
They feed you yet
No response
Hardy reaches into his pocket
Pulls out a Dunbar eyes it, wary but definitely wanting it
Go on
You can eat in front of someone and still not talk to them - my parents did it for years
Dunbar grabs the donut, wolfing it down
Want another one
No response
Osborne looks to her watch - it's been a minute
12
Maybe later
Ray, let me say this up front - 'm not a cop
Dunbar turns away, no longer interested
Hardy continues: used to be, but that's beside the point
Who  am doesn't really matter; what matters is that right now, you're in a shitload of trouble
You understand that, right
No response
Now,  don't know if you did what you did in self defense and frankly don't really care
'm just doing a favor for Colonel Styles because he wants to know if anyone else who's still out there is in need of assistance
To be honest with you, though,  don't care about that either
Dunbar looks up at this, surprised
don't know those guys, you do
They die, to me, it's like seeing a couple people died in a fire on the news - tragic, but it doesn't affect me
The only thing  care about is agreed to do a favor for a friend and try and talk to you till your transpo shows up
You like baseball
No response
Osborne looks at her watch - two minutes
could talk baseball for   days
Batting averages, 's,    got statistics in my brain,    don't know how  remember them
It's    freaky
You wanna talk baseball
Dunbar, completely confused
Come on Ray, we're gonna be here five hours, we gotta talk about something
So who do you like
long silence and then: 13
don't like baseball
Hardy grins as Osborne stops her watch at 2:41
Why not
asked for a policeman
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen
What's wrong with baseball
It's
too slow
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty
just don't like it
What do you like then
As they continue, we  under the table to reveal a '  -- Styles and an
listening to the Coffee Room conversation
' , over the speaker: (
) don't know
like the Army
(
) 'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic
'll tell you straight, hated it here
-- You did Basic here
Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West
Piece of work, that guy remember, he used to have these two silver
45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd () 14
(') knock you on the head with one of them
He still carry those guns
He Dunbar nods
was also his " knife dummy"
(to Osborne) See, West used to say he could slit a man from stem to sternum in three seconds
He'd use this length of pipe to demonstrate and if you were the knife dummy, you'd spend all day getting a pipe rammed into your balls if you weren't fast enough to defend yourself
That was a loooong day
Hardy laughs at the memory and turns back to Dunbar
Incidentally, Ray,  promised them 'd ask where West and the others are
Can we get to them
He looks to the floor
There's no need
They're dead, aren't they
Dunbar looks back up at Hardy
Yeah
'  -- Styles lowers his head at this
-- You kill them
No answer
Hardy rubs his nose
Osborne steps forward
The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, You're a murderer- See, Ray, this is what we call "good cop, bad cop"
() 15
She shouts,  stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established
Osborne, stunned by this
But  don't want to play games
That's why you're not in an interrogation room, with one of those two way mirrors - everyone knows those things are two way, right
Dunbar looks at him good nods slowly
Right
Now, 'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay
Okay
Hardy smiles at him, gets up, and leaves
--  -- Osborne follows him out into the hall where Styles waits
Baseball
Believe somebody owes me ten dollars- You made me look like an idiot- Oh, 'm sorry,  didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop - by admitting it appeared trustworthy
You think he did it
No- Yes- They stop, looking at each other
16
You've got four hours and forty-five minutes to find out
-- Hardy returns, another donut in hand, Osborne behind him
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray
'm not telling you what happened
Okay
but  would like to know about the other cadets
What they were like - nice guys
Dunbar takes a deep breath
Some
Tell me about them
As Dunbar begins to talk, we
--   -- Row upon row of freshly shaven headed  stand at attention
Their first day of boot camp
(
) First day was when  met Pike
Sarge hated him from the beginning
man with a face of granite strides up and down the lines
Two ivory handled pistols on his hips
His lifeless cobalt blue eyes take in the Cadets
This is
You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives
You have chosen to join my Army
This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and  will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me - give me a sir, yes, sir
Sir, yes, sir
17
Those who  deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit  will kill
You ever hear of a training accident - Give me a sir, yes, sir
Sir, yes, sir
In my time  have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense
This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that  will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand - Give me a sir, yes, sir
Sir, yes, sir
So forget what you've seen on Sixty fucking Minutes about the kinder, gentler military - you will either succeed, quit, or die by my hand
He walks over to a tall black cadet in the front row
My power here is absolute, isn't that right, nigger
Sir, yes, sir
West hauls off and  Pike across the face
hail from Biloxi, Mississippi where we string greasy coon necks up from tree branches when the mood strikes us you have a problem with that
Sir, no, sir
West grabs Pike by the neck,
The others Cadets Pike goes down on his knees, the loss of air is so great
He reaches up automatically to try and save himself
18
What the fuck is this
You lay a hand on me while 'm trying to do my duty and rid the world of you
He      and releases him
Pike goes fetal on the ground, , as West stands over him, screaming
Get the fuck up, you're still in formation, get the fuck up
Pike somehow gets to his feet, vomit streaking his clothes
What the fuck have you done to that uniform, take it off, take it off, take it off
Pike, still gasping, can't move fast enough
West slaps him again and tears the man's shirt off
Get those fucking pants off,  want you buck ass naked, you don't deserve to wear these beautiful United States Army issue clothes
Pike struggles off the rest of his clothes until he is
West turns and spies Dunbar in the line
Cadet, what's your name
Sir, Dunbar, sir
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar
Sir, yes, sir
West draws one of his  and gives it to him
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours
He is not to be given food, water, or clothes
If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear
Sir, yes, sir
19
The rest of you, fallout for physicals
The rest of the Cadets fallout, following West away to one of the buildings, leaving Dunbar and Pike
One with a gun, the other naked
(
) Fifteen guys quit that day
But not Pike
--    -- The , navigating a log spanned over a
(
) Time went on and the Sarge started singling people out
One of the Cadets, a small man named , falls from the log
Screaming, West dives into the pit and pulls Anderson out, knocking him on the head with a pistol
--    -- Anderson stands naked, his arms straining to hold up, perpendicular to his body as West berates him
He'd zero in on a fella and ride him till he quit
--    -- Anderson, now in civilian clothes, gets into a
Quit
--    -- West, screaming at a weasely looking cadet named
(
) Those who wouldn't quit, he'd put in what he called Section Eight
--    -- horribly dilapidated quarters
Four cadets, Dunbar, Pike, Childs, and  sleep in rickety bunks
(
) Washout rejects, guys he said were , "dumbfucks too stupid to know they were dead"
He separated us from the rest
We slept alone
20
--    -- The same four Cadets, eating    as the other members of the Cadet Corps chow at tables
(
) ate alone
--    -- The four Cadets fallout on a run shirtless, with heavy packs and rifles held over their heads as the rest of the Cadet Corps files into their barracks for sleep
(
) and trained long after the other guys got to turn in
--    -- The Cadet Corps, mustered
West zeroes in on  (the "dead one"), whose t-shirt has a spot on it
(
) Fellas lived in daily fear of being Sectioned and with good reason, too
West pulls Nunez out of line by his ear and kicks him over towards a separate muster of our Four Section Eighters
They figured we were the boys who'd meet with a "training accident"
Nunez takes a place among them
Looking absolutely terrified
-- Osborne leans forward
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you
No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit
Making it through was kind of an honor
Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class
That's not exactly true
(off their looks) 'm living proof
How did you get Sectioned, Ray
21
Dunbar gives a look that almost resembles a smile
That first night with Pike
made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out
There were six of us
--    -- The six members of Section Eight on a forced run through the rain
We focus in each face as Dunbar describes them
First up is  a tall Aryan looking blonde with a square jaw
(
) Mueller was from Tulsa, a real good ol' boy type
One of those "his Daddy's Daddy's Daddy died at Bull Run and no bleeding heart Yankee was gonna take away his scatter gun"
He idolized West
Muller, grinning, as West kicks his ass to pick up the pace
Next to him is , a strapping hulk of a manchild
(
) And Nunez idolized Mueller
Big fella from New Mexico
After he got Sectioned he just followed Mueller around like a lap dog
He wasn't mean like Mueller, though, didn't have it in him
Next to Nunez is , small and weasely with feral eyes
(
) But Childs did
Didn't talk to anyone, but you got this feeling something was wrong with him, like real wrong
Type of guy you felt uncomfortable going to sleep near
Behind Childs runs Pike
(
) Pike  told you about
He took the brunt of it from Mueller and West
Once they found it out he was a convict they were merciless
() 22
(
) (') He'd been busted for Auto Theft, judge gave him the option of jailor the Army
He made the wrong choice
Next to Pike, Dunbar and  run side by side
Kendall is short like Childs, but also weak
Wheezing
Finally Kendall and me
Kendall was a smart guy, we got along okay
Pike and  tried to help him, but
Kendall falters and Pike stops to try and help him up
West smacks the him away, practically kicking Kendall to his feet
(
) He was sickly
Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy
(
) Epilepsy
(
) Yeah
Spent half his time in the infirmary
Only reason he enlisted was his father
West didn't section him till last week
-- And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you
Yeah
And that's all 'm saying
Hardy leans back in his chair
You smoke, Ray
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it
You don't give me a cigarette till  tell you more
No, actually,  just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some
Dunbar studies him for a moment and then pulls a pack of Dorals from his pocket and puts them on the table
My brand
Must be my lucky day
23
He takes one and lights it
Dunbar does the same
Let me ask you one thing
You seem like a good guy, Ray
You carried Kendall wounded to the pickup
So what  don't get is what you did to make Nunez want to kill you
Dunbar just looks at the ground
at the door
Hardy and Osborne turn to see an
stick his head in
Sirs
--  -- Hardy and Osborne emerge to find Styles waiting for them
He's not done by a longshot,  can get more out of him- He can wait
Kendall's out of surgery
() -- Hardy and Osborne sit in the back of the open car as it rumbles across the grounds, headed towards the Base Hospital
They sit in silence until: Why'd you join the army
Osborne looks at him, annoyed
You really want to make banal chit- Chat like that now
You're right
We should sit in silence
We're in the middle of a murder case- Best time for banal chit-chat
He slips something into his pocket
What is that
24
Microrecorder for Kendall - didn't have- time to wire his room
Now tell me why you joined the army or 'll jab this pen through your neck
Osborne smiles in spite of, herself
Typical army brat story
Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse
There was never any real doubt of joining up
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib
Something like that
You
lost a bet
Osborne laughs
You're kidding
Yeah
That's just the story  tell the girls to get them into bed
Truth is
don't know
The whole honor and duty thing
Make a difference in the world, crap like that
Didn't really work out
Osborne studies him
bet    that's the second story you tell    the girls to get them into bed, after    you make them laugh with the first    one
Hardy just smiles
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it
The very same
You do understand that there's absolutely no way  could ever be attracted to you, right
25
plan to grow on you
You're off to a late start
So noted
They pass an
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there
What do you think of Dunbar
He's telling the truth, up to a point
What point
Hardy doesn't respond, instead looking out as they pass the Something wrong
Being back here
Gives me the willies
Not the happiest of memories
-
bunch of young Cadets, Hardy and Styles among them, doing forced push-ups by the barracks in the rain as West randomly berates and
- As he looks away and shakes it off
No
--   -- leads Hardy and Osborne down a spotless white hall
Normally we wouldn't let anyone see him this soon, but Colonel Styles said it was urgent- 26
It is
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy
Kid gloves
Got it
-- '  -- Kendall lies in a bed, a network of tubes in his arm
He is awake but pale, still weak
He studies his visitors
You
've seen you around the Base
But you
(  ) You're not Army, are you
Coast Guard, special detective detail
We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk
Kendall's laugh turns into a cough
Placing Hardy
That's it
You're that policeman with friends in low places
Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days
Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer- Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room
suggest you talk to us
Kendall smiles again, not losing any of his cool
've done nothing wrong
(gestures to his wound) 'm the victim here
But not the only victim, right
My, my, my, how did things turn so hostile so quickly
If  didn't know better, 'd say you two were out to get me
27
We just want- What, "The Truth"
Please
There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees
Things are not what they seem
Hardy stares at him for a moment and then gets up to leave
It's too early in the day for me to give a shit about some pissant cadet's bad version of "intrigue"
You want to talk to us, send word over to the brig
Let's go
Nonplussed, Osborne follows
Hardy turns back at the door
You're working too hard, Levi can tell cause you're sweating
And you're sweating cause you have no idea what Dunbar's already told us
--  -- Hardy and Osborne walk to the '
That was kid gloves
Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight
He pulls a cigarette from his pocket and lights it
But we have to question him- (noticing) Thought you didn't have cigarettes- lied
Wait for it
Osborne just stares at him, not knowing what to say next
The  at the Nurse's Station rings and a  answers
Listens for a moment, hangs up, and turns to them
Cadet Kendall- We're on our way
28
'   -- Hardy and Osborne sit across from Kendall's bed
Sergeant West is dead isn't he
Kendall nods
And the other three Cadets
Kendall hesitates, then nods again
Feel free to elaborate
Kendall takes a breath and begins, all trace of bravado gone
My father is a powerful man
Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain
unpleasantries
(deep breath) am a homosexual
Senator Daddy must be thrilled
He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea
He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and  have done my best to oblige him
However, in the last four weeks,  began a relationship with another cadet
What do you think of that
think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water
The Sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled
My father interceded, so instead, West Sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that  was gay
He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own
He wanted more than that
29
More intrigue, Levi
Kendall stares at them, dead serious
Yes
-- The six Cadets asleep, all except Kendall, who stares up at the patchwork ceiling
(
) It was the regular Tuesday night drill
He'd let us sleep for an hour and then wake us up, drag us out to the bayou, and work us all night, separate from the others
The door  , revealing West
Get up, get up, get up
We're going on a little night hike, boys - muster in five on the south tarmac
He leaves as the Sectioners rise, groaning
Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out
Toughens us up, Pike
You don't like it, quit
Pike pulls on his pants and shoots him the finger
Maybe we shouldn't go
The faggot speaks
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller
(mocking gay lisp) You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller
Mueller and Childs laugh, but Nunez looks concerned
You really heard this
30
You know Popham, works in the kitchen
He told me it was on the radio
He stops, listening
They all hear the ,  outside
We should tell him we're not going
Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out - we don't want to get rained on
" He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland
He pulls on his rain poncho and is out the door, Nunez right behind him
The others, getting ready, all except Kendall
Dunbar comes over and puts a hand on his shoulder
He's right
We don't have a choice
--  -- The six cadets, mustered in front of West and a West hands out -16's, sidearms, and grenades while yelling above the wind
rifle, a pistol, and three phosphorous grenades to a man
This is live fire, so keep those safetied until we touch down;  don't want anyone shooting their dick off
Some chuckling
Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming
American soldiers do not wait for good weather - they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty
An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy
Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me
Sir, yes, sir
is two clicks North of a cabin, you are to split into teams of two () 31
(') and work your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find
Each area has twenty targets, first team to take all twenty and find the cabin wins
Teams are as follows - Dunbar and Nunez, Pike and Mueller, Kendall and Childs
Mueller groans
will be in the areas monitoring your progress and if  see anyone drag ass  will personally slit you stem to sternum and leave you for dead
Fall out
The Cadets board the Transport Chopper
Kendall gets on last, passing West who leans in and whispers to him: You're gonna die tonight, faggot
'   -- Osborne looks up
He said what
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot"
Clear as day
No one else heard it
He whispered it in my ear
Hardy scratches his temple
Levi,  don't know   if you're familiar with investigative   work, but we have this little thing   called "motive" and you just gave   yourself one
You said you wanted to know what happened- 'm telling you the truth
What happened to "degrees"
32
Didn't kill him- Then who did
() -- On Kendall, sitting among the Sectioners in silence
terrified he looks like he's about to throw up
(
) wanted to tell someone what he'd said, but  couldn't
Mueller would just laugh
Nunez and Childs wouldn't care
Pike and Dunbar were okay, but
When West outed me, he isolated me
An outcast among outcasts
And 'd just been told tonight was the night 'd die
The Chopper touches down on the edge of the
The door rumbles open as West points out different team directions in the blackness
First team, second team, third team, go, go, go
The click of rifles being unsafetied as the cadets pour out of the helicopter
-- We track with Kendall and Childs as they head away from the Landing Zoe, rifles up, heads down, side by side
Moving the brush quickly and quietly, eyes scanning for targets
(
) knew Childs a little, we worked at the  together
The wind is picking up and it's started to
Their ponchos flap loudly against the elements
(
) started getting it in my head that maybe West had paid him, maybe he was the one who was supposed to give me a training accident- The  of
Kendall turns  towards it, for a moment
Until he sees Childs  lower his  smoking rifle, a   on a tree in front  of them
He looks down, noticing has his own weapon
Childs steps forward, knocking Kendall's rifle away
33
Don't you ever point a gun at me
'm- 'm sorry
Kendall, terrified
Shaking
beat
Childs picks up the rifle from the ground and hands it back to him
Come on, let's move
-- Kendall and Childs, moving through the bayou, Childs taking out targets
It's raining harder now
(
) All  could think of was West, out there somewhere in the dark
Maybe watching the others, maybe watching me
And waiting to make his move
Childs speaks, and Kendall almost jumps out of his skin
Christ, am  alone in this world
Shoot something- from the left
Kendall panics, pivots, and
Into
No target, no West, no nothing
Kendall, really freaked out now
target, Kendall, cap a fucking target
What's wrong with you
(
) thought  was gonna have an attack
Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou
Childs could tell  wasn't right
Just safety your shit and get behind me, okay
'll take care of this
Kendall nods and lets Childs walk ahead
Staring at Childs' back as they move on
On Kendall's face, thinking
(
) Maybe it was a trick
Maybe this was when they'd get me, when  felt safest
'  - Clicking off the safety again
Moving towards the trigger
34
(
) But if  struck first and took out Childs, then maybe  could make it out alive
Kendall raises the rifle
Sights Childs' back
moment of utter silence and then
'   -- Maybe  shouldn't tell you that
Maybe  should tell you  wasn't scared at all
But  was
(long pause) Enough to almost kill him
But you didn't
No
Poetic justice, though
Why
No reply
Hardy smiles, understanding
Because Childs is the one who shot you
Osborne looks up, surprised
Kendall nods
But that came later
-- As Kendall safeties his rifle and lowers it
The  of a tremendous  comes from their right
Kendall and Childs knocked off their feet as the sky momentarily with the blast as a
Over there
Childs points to the right, where the dim shine of can be seen through the trees
He drags Kendall to his feet and the two take off running towards it
Kendall panting and scared, ducking branches and leaping ditches as the two sprint towards the dying glow
Hello
- 35
The sound of
Childs  Kendall
They hit the deck, face down in mud
It takes them a second to realize the shots are not directed at them
Fuck, what the fuck is going on- What do we do
Whoever it is isn't shooting at us
He trails off
The gunfire and screaming have stopped
Silence now, save for the wind and rain
Don't want to go- Fine
Childs rises and heads towards where the sounds were
Kendall, lying in the rain and mud, shivering
Alone
After a moment he gets up and follows
--  ,-- The   and  smolder under the rainfall
Kendall finds Childs, standing down by the creek
Something lies by his feet
What's- He stops, seeing
Oh, Jesus
Literally spread out on the ground, dead
Eyes open, face half blackened, he has been ripped in two at the torso
horrifying sight
Kendall stumbles back from it
Did- Did you- It was the grenade you fucking idiot
Look at him
36
Kendall can't
He sits, sobbing
Part horror, part relief
This isn't our area
Whose area is This- Can anybody hear me
Childs pivots at the sound of Mueller coming over the ridge
Hey, - (seeing it) Holy fuck
,
holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do
We found him like this- Mueller raises his rifle at the weeping Kendall
You killed him you fucking faggot- We found him like this
Kendall was with me the whole- Listen to me
Mueller, finally seeming to understand
Lowering the gun
Jesus, Jesus fucking Christ
Muttering to himself, walking in circles
Where's Pike
No response
Mueller, where's Pike
Mueller looks up
We got-  don't know, we got separated Before or after the explosion
(no response) Mueller- don't know
37
How can you not know- Mueller comes at him, screaming: Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the  - Mueller stops, eyes crazed
Childs looks to the sky, which is becoming worse by the second
We have to get out of this
To find the cabin
He helps Kendall to his feet
What about Pike
Maybe he'll be there
Either way, we have to go
Kendall nods, slowly
The two start up the hill
Shouldn't we-  mean, we shouldn't just leave him here
He points down to West's body
Childs looks at it
You can carry him if you want
He and Kendall continue on
Mueller lingers a moment longer and then turns, following them up the hill
-- Kendall, Childs, and Mueller make their way through the bush
The  and  have conspired into a
The three men are practically stumbling now, leaning in against it to stay on their feet
Kendall spies something through the maelstrom
It looks like
He points: There
-- Wooden, one story, and large, it resembles a solidly built shack
It is being thrashed by the storm
38
The trio stumble towards the front door
-- Obviously abandoned
Bare of any furniture save for two wooden chairs next to an empty fireplace
and  shout in surprise as the three men practically collapse into the cabin
Dunbar runs to bolt the door against the elements as Nunez helps them up
What happened to you- What happened to you
We finished the course and came here, Then heard an explosion- (to Mueller) Where's Pike
We don't know
West is dead
Silence
Dunbar and Nunez stare at him
Mueller jerks a hand towards Kendall and Childs
They found him
Poor fucker was Practically blown in half- Poor fucker my ass
You better watch it, faggot, 'm not Sure you and Childs didn't do him- What about you, wandering around Alone
At least we have an alibi- What do you mean, alone
Pike and  got separated- Yeah and he doesn't know when- remember now, it was before the Explosion- 39
Oh, you remember now- 'm about two seconds away from seeing If fairies really can fly- What about Pike
Mueller stops, as the others turn towards the big man
Silence
They realize what the question means
He wouldn't kill anybody
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict
You know how much he hated West- hated West, Childs hated West, everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but that doesn't mean we killed him
What if it wasn't one of us
What if it was a local- He was blown up by a phosphorous grenade, they don't exactly sell those at 7-11
Look, here are the facts - Roberto was with Dunbar, Queen Kendall was with Childs, and Pike's the only one not here
He did it
The others nod, becoming convinced
He is the only one unaccounted for
Maybe he's dead too
Maybe you killed Them both, Mueller- Shut up
(to Mueller) Let me see your grenades
Why
40
We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one
Mueller angrily digs into his sack and pulls out his grenades
See
Three
Now can we please- He stops
Hearing a  outside
Through the wind and rain,  on the porch
They all turn to the door
Waiting
The
Pike
Covered in
Hey, guys
They stare at him as he calmly closes the door and walks over to the empty
Finally: Whose blood is that, Jay
West's
Any kindling for afire
He looks around for kindling
beat
What do you mean, West's
mean  killed him
(pause) Isn't that what we all wanted
'   -- He admitted it
Right in front of us
Mueller went after him but we held him back
Pike surrendered and volunteered to be tied up
So we roped him to a chair and tried to ride out the storm
Why would he just surrender
Kendall turns to her and smiles
Because he had a plan
41
--   -- Pike, tied to a chair by the fireplace while the others look for, food in the
Alone, Kendall walks past Pike: Hey, Kendall, talk to you for a sec
Kendall looks around - there seems no harm in it
You hated West as much as  did
'm not saying what  did was right, but you can't tell me you're not glad the motherfucker's dead
Kendall says nothing
Pike looks around, makes sure no one is listening and then whispers: The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here
You turn me in Tomorrow and we're both fucked- What are you talking about
gay Senator's son who let his Sarge get fragged on a training exercise
The press'll crucify you and your father
His career will be over and it'll be your fault
But we do this different and you come out a hero
On Kendall, thinking about it
beat
How
Mueller
He's as bad as West and we both know   it
Now  can't do it, cause 'm   tied up, but we get the others to   go along- Don't think  want to hear this- Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you
Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead - the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers
() 42
(') We'll   move the bodies out to the creek   and say we came over the hill right   as they fragged West, all we gotta   do is tell the story right
Kendall stares at him
Disgusted
You're sick, Pike
He turns and walks away
Pike watches him go
(
) Later on
saw him talking to Dunbar
They had been close
was in another room when it happened
-- Kendall, looking through the empty cabinets for food when -- From the living room
As Kendall bolts towards the noise, the air is filled with the sounds of and
He pushes through the door
--   -- Kendall, coming through the door as we -
Mueller, sprawled out on the floor, dead
Pike, tied to the chair, bullethole in his forehead
Nunez, wounded, stumbling out the front door into the hurricane
And a badly wounded Childs, pistol out,  towards the and
Kendall's arm,  with a , and he starts to go down
- -- On Kendall's form, falling
(
) don't think he meant to do it
It was just reflex - he'd already been gutshot
must have passed out cause next thing  knew
-- The sounds of   and
Kendall's eyes flutter open
He's on   Dunbar's back, being carried through the woods
The sound   of  and a next to them
Someone   is chasing them
Trying to kill them
Nunez
43
Dunbar bobs and weaves as another volley of bullets comes from behind and we can now hear
-- As Dunbar bursts into the sunlight, carrying Kendall
The entire thing dreamlike, what we saw at the opening, but from '  -- the helicopter overhead, Nunez behind, Dunbar turning and shooting,
'   -- And that's it
Hardy is silent
Staring at him
Nunez was chasing Dunbar
Because he'd shot Mueller
But you didn't see it, right
Like  said,  was in the kitchen
When  came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone
Why did he come back for you
honestly don't know
Maybe to have someone to cover for him
And wish  could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men
Silence
Kendall's got nothing more to say
Okay
think that's it
He rises and walks to the door
Mr
Hardy
Hardy turns back
What did Dunbar tell you
44
Hardy smiles and pushes out the door
'  -- Hardy and Osborne stand before the Colonel, filling him in
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez
Who killed Pike
Someone must have got a shot off
He wasn't exactly a moving target
Styles turns to Osborne
What do you think
It's too neat
"Too neat
" How long have you been an investigator
don't think that has anything to do with- That means under a year
Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me - murder is basic
There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people - it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat
Dunbar's our guy
Osborne struggles to put it into words
just
He came back for Kendall
don't think he's capable of murder
Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne
Osborne turns, making her case to Styles
45
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez
He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies - he didn't see any crime committed
Well, 'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have Tried harder to witness it for you- West's body isn't in the creek bed
They stop arguing, turning to look at him
We've already been over the terrain twice
Nothing
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it
Habeas Corpus - you have to have a body to have a crime
Okay, then let's widen the search 'to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car- Without the body we have no physical proof
We need a confession
From Dunbar
hate to break this to you, but  don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty
Nevertheless- Nevertheless what'
Kendall will testify and that'll be enough
Not for me
beat
Almost accusingly: 46
You mean not enough to save you
gets here in three hours
Try for the confession
-- Dunbar looks up as Hardy and Osborne enter
(cheerfully) Hey, Ray
Just had a nice talk with your buddy
Kendall - seems you killed three people
That son of a bitch
That'd be my reaction too- He's lying
Well, why didn't you say so
We'll Just drop all your charges, then- 'm serious- Hardy leans across the table
Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it
Did Kendall tell you about the
He said he worked there- No, did he tell you about it
About the business Childs ran
What business
47
Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain- So Childs made some side money, so what
People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you- Didn't shoot West- Yeah, we know, Pike did
Dunbar stares at him
You think you know everything, don't you
You haven't even scratched the surface
Hardy leans across the table, looks Dunbar dead in the eye
know enough to know you got two choices - you can sign a confession, in which case you'll probably spend the rest of your life in a military prison, or you can tell us to fuck off, in which case you'll probably get the gas chamber
(smiling) Am  scratching your surface yet
Dunbar stares at him for a moment and then at Hardy,
Tackles him to the floor,
Osborne, pulling her sidearm, and   Dunbar in the head
Dunbar goes sprawling off Hardy as
's rush into the room,  him
Hardy gets up, gasping, and stumbles to the door
Hardy
But he's already gone
--  -- Hardy, walking angrily towards the front entrance, wheezing and massaging his neck
Osborne, runninq to catch up
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints
48
don't know
Styles appears at the end of the hall
Tom, where are you going- Home, 'm done
What about the confession
Hardy stares at him
You want a confession
Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it
Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault- What the hell are you talking about- 'm talking about West
We had him, Bill, we were there
You're the fucking Base Commander, you knew what he did to Cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has- Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend- You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by
It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what
He deserved it
There's your confession
He pushes past a shocked Styles and walks out the door
--   -- Hardy storms across the grass
Osborne, still following
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave- Watch me
49
You said you owed Styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him
Hardy whirls on her
West was a monster
Fifteen years ago,  was here,  was Section Eight, was Pike
Fuck being the knife dummy- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night
He did that every year, he did that to me
Fifteen years ago,  wanted him dead, and now 'm supposed to care that somebody offed him
Sorry, no can do
tried
You did more than try
You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal- Phenomenal at taking bribes, right
beat
Osborne shakes her head
was starting to believe you, you know
That you weren't who everyone Said
guess  was wrong- Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit
This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne
Everyone thinks 'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that
Nobody will ever know what happens here- But you will
Hardy stares at her
Why do you care
Because it's my job
Because people are dead
Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that
(pause) We can do this, Hardy
50
Hardy looks at the ground
Two and a half hours
That's all 'm asking
Two and a half hours to maybe get the truth
Silence
Hardy looks back up at her
Speaking softly: didn't shoot West
What
Dunbar
He said he didn't shoot West
West wasn't shot, Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body
They stare at each other for a moment
-- Hardy and Osborne enter to find Dunbar in
Apologize- You saw West's body
Of course- Where
The creek bed- And he'd been shot
Yeah- What about the phosphorous grenade
One went off, yeah, but it didn't Touch him-  thought you knew this- 51
Tell it to me
--   -- Dunbar and Nunez  towards the glow of phosphorous and sound of
They come over the hill to see Childs and Kendall, standing over '
Dunbar stops, shocked
Holy fuck
Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do
We found him like this
Dunbar edges closer, looking at West
With
His chest, riddled
Somebody emptied a full clip into him- (
} Stop
-- Kendall told us Mueller was the one who found them with West's body
He's lying, then
We didn't see Mueller till we got to the cabin
-- Dunbar, Kendall, Childs, and Nunez push through the door to find Mueller in his undershirt, a  burning in the hearth
Jesus, what happened
(breathing hard) West
he's dead
(
} Back up
-- Mueller was alone in the cabin
52
Yeah
-- : Pike and  got separated
then heard gunfire
Close
So did we
Why didn't you come
Mueller looks down, scared
was afraid
Mueller voice as he continues to talk
(
) didn't buy it
But Mueller had all three of his grenades
Mueller shows his three grenades to the others
-- At least you and Kendall agree on that
What happened next
Dunbar shudders
Pike came back
-- Pike, staggering in through the door
The others get up from where they are sitting - it's been awhile since they arrived
Pike shouts at Mueller: What the fuck happened to you- What the fuck happened to you
One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas- Where have you been, Jay
53
Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place
It's gettin' bad out there- (looking around) Where's West
Yeah, right
Shut up
(to Pike) West's dead
beat
What
Silence
All of them staring at Pike
Where have you been, Jay
Pike, suddenly understanding
Fear creeping into his face
Oh, no
no, fuck that- He moves to the door, but
Hey
Nunez, with his  out
Trained on Pike
Roberto, what the fuck
We just want to check your pack- Why
Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first- Blame the nigger, then, huh
Someone turns up dead, you just look for the Darkest face in the crowd- You know it's not like that- 54
Do
The  as Nunez pulls back the pistol's hammer
Let him check your pack
Pike stares at them and then throws his pack down, angrily
Dunbar goes to it, opens it, and reaches in
Pulls his hand out
Only
Looks at Pike
Sadly
Tie him up
-- Later
The fury of the storm has increased
Kendall, Childs, Nunez, and Mueller, in the  looking for food
Pike, tied to the chair
Dunbar sitting in a corner, listening to the hurricane rage outside
Pike watches him
Just like the first day, huh
You standing guard on me
as the cabin  on it's foundation
Dunbar looks up at the roof, scared
It holds
This place ain't gonna hold much longer
Dunbar doesn't reply
Still staring nervously at the roof
Pike looks to make sure the others out of earshot, then: You and me are friends, right
No reply
Right
Yeah
Pike takes a deep breath
You gotta untie me
(off Dunbar's look) didn't do this thing, Ray
55
You hated West more than any of us
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer- You're the only one missing a grenade
Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper
Were you watching your pack on the ride in
Dunbar starts to get up
Ray, this is my life    here
ain't gonna pretend 'm not    happy West is gone, but you know     couldn't have done this
It's not     in me
If not you, then who
Mueller
Oh, come on- We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone
Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away- That's exactly what he says about you
Who you gonna trust, Ray
Him or your friend
Dunbar stares at him
You hated West, Mueller loved him- Enough to go to prison
Childs' Scam, Mueller was in on it- Bullshit
56
Look in my pack
Why
Just look
Little pocket
Dunbar walks over to Pike's pack and unzips it
Checks the little pocket
Pulls out a  and a
Combat grade morphine
Mueller sold it to me
You're lying- Pull up my sleeve
Right arm
Dunbar does to reveal a cluster of
That look like a lie to you
been using solid for the last eight weeks
Dunbar sits down
Not knowing what to say
After that first night on the parade Grounds with you,  was bad - Exposure, malnutrition, the works
needed something to keep me from crashing
Mueller found me
-- Empty except for Pike
He sits, nude, curled up on the tile, as the nozzles blast   down onto his shivering form
approaching
Mueller
He leans down next to Pike, speaking to him
Kindly
(
) He said he knew guy who had an in at the , could hook me up
This is before  knew what a dick he was
As Mueller produces a  from his pocket
--  -- covert meeting among stacks of supplies
Childs stands with Mueller, talking to a gaunt Pike
Behind Pike are a group of other   , all jonesing
57
Later on Childs got assigned there, started running the shit out to every cadet who needed it
But  was our class's first customer
Pike hands the smiling Mueller a
-- Dunbar staring open mouthed at Pike
Shocked
Why
why didn't you tell me
Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast
Only Mueller and Childs know
beat
Dunbar gets to his feet
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him
You saw West, right
How was he killed
Full clip to the body- From up close or far away
His chest was hamburger- That's close range
You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood
Look at my uniform
Nothing
Dunbar looks
Not a speck of blood on it
And where's Mueller's
When  came in, he was only wearing a t-shirt
Dunbar looks over to fireplace, where ashes are smoldering
- When Dunbar first entered the Cabin: Mueller, standing there in a -, a  burning in the hearth
58
Way  figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first
(softly) They
Mueller and Childs
One of them must've taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper
() -- The Sectioners sit, stonefaced, staring out the window
- Mueller's hand as it snakes into Pike's pack and extracts a phosphorous grenade
-- Mueller and Pike, twenty feet apart, scouring the brush for targets
Mueller looks to Pike and then slips away
(
) Then Mueller ditches me during the exercise and heads for the creek
--  ,-- Mueller stands on the hill and pulls the grenades pin, tossing it down the embankment
(
) He blows the grenade to frame me and gets West to come running
The grenade , setting the entire area
-- Kendall and Childs, turning towards the sound
Note: Each shot of Kendall and Childs in this sequence should correspond exactly to Kendall's Flashback
--   -- West emerges from the bush at a sprint
What the fuck is going on
Mueller runs down the embankment toward him
59
Don't know, sir, - Six feet away from West, Mueller suddenly raises his rifle and
-- Kendall and Childs, running in the direction of the grenade
Childs' job is easy, he only has to delay Kendall long enough for Mueller to get away
Suddenly   shatters the night
He tackles Kendall into the mud
--   -- Mueller, smoking rifle in hand, uniform covered in blood stands over '
He turns and runs off moment later, Childs and Kendall come into view at the top of the embankment
(
) Now all Mueller has to do is get rid of the evidence
-- Mueller, still covered in blood, enters the dark cabin
He strips of his shirt and throws it in the fireplace
Striking a match, igniting the bloody rag
(
) And wait for everyone else to arrive
Mueller, watching the evidence burn
-- Pike sighs, finished with his story
don't know
What don't you know
This is a lot of information to be Getting
have to think- 60
The hurricane outside   as the Cabin  again
The sound of
Pike stares up at the roof
There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here
You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it- No
no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the
's- We wait and 'm a dead man
got a black face, a criminal record, and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much  hated West - my court martial will take six minutes
It's either me or them, Ray, and you gotta decide right now
The cabin  again
Dunbar stares at him
Untie me
Dunbar doesn't move
Untie me, Ray
long beat
The two men stare at each other
And then Dunbar pulls his knife from his boot and leans down to cut Pike's bonds
Thank God
(
) What the fuck are you doing
Dunbar freezes
Caught
He looks to the open kitchen door where Mueller stands
Guys, get out here
The others enter the room
Dunbar, kneeling there, knife inches away from severing Pike's ropes
This place is going, Mueller
We gotta move- 61
Shut the fuck up
(to the others) He was gonna cut him loose
The others stare at Dunbar
Why
Cause  didn't do it
Childs motions to Dunbar
Get away from there
He's serious
Dunbar moves away from Pike
We all know what you did, Pike don't know what kind of nigger voodoo You been working in here, but- Where's your shirt, Mueller
Used it to start the fire- Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it
Not a bad trick for a murderer- you said you burned yours
The others begin to look at Mueller with new eyes
Was freezing from the hurricane- So you took off your shirt
To start a fire, goddammit
(pointing to Pike) What about him, huh
Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack
'ever think of that
Go ahead, cut him loose
First chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they work- The hurricane, reaching   outside as  begins leaking in through the roof
62
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of Here- We're not going anywhere
: Cadet Michael Mueller,  hereby place you under military arrest for the Murder of Sergeant Nathan West- The fuck are you talking about- You are to be stripped of all weapons And placed under guard- Bullshit- Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body- Shut up
Mueller pulls his  and
Mueller, what the fuck- Don't do this- Pike,   with Mueller
Continuing: test will no doubt link you to the Killing- Put it down
Tell him to shut up- -failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself- 63
Pike, please- Although that won't matter much when Coupled with the murder charge- - Pike leans forward
You stupid white trash motherfucker, saw you do it- And Mueller
Pike's head
The gunshot,
Then, for an eternity,
Nobody moves
Nobody breathes
As if time has stopped
Oh
my God
Mueller lowers his arm, the pistol clattering to the floor
His face, as shocked as the others
He wouldn't
stop talking
He takes a step forward towards Pike
hole in the middle of the black man's forehead
(softly) So you killed him
Almost mechanically, Dunbar begins to reach for his own gun
The unmistakable sound of a two rifles' magazines being simultaneously
Dunbar turns to see Childs and Nunez, their -16's in hand
Levelled at him
Get that hand away
Dunbar does
Looks to Nunez
You too
64
We can still come out of this okay
Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us
That's the story
Mueller collapses on the ground
Head in hands
West was one thing, but this- Shut up, Mueller
You framed-him
None of that matters now
We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them
You're either with us, or against us - which is it
Dunbar and Kendall, looking at each other
It's clear what the wrong answer will mean
long beat, until Okay- He is cut off as the  outside  - the mounting to it's   - and the   , showering Childs, Mueller, and Nunez with glass
Dunbar's hand flies to his pistol,
Mueller, , trying to claw the glass from his
Childs, seeing Dunbar move,
And the cabin is filled with the    as Kendall goes down, clutching his
, hitting Childs directly in the chest
Childs, still shooting, falls back, his random spray of bullets    who jerks like a marionette
Nunez, drawing a bead on Dunbar, about to shoot, when
great  of   and overtakes them and the '
-- Hours later
The rain has lessened and the Hurricane has begun to lift as Dunbar pulls himself from the debris
Hearing a   from his left
65
Kendall
Half conscious, his arm, bloody
Dunbar slings the man across his shoulders as the rising sun begins to peak through the clouds overhead
-- Dunbar, carrying Kendall towards the clearing when comes from behind
He turns to look
Nunez
The only other survivor from the Cabin
hundred yards back, rifle in hand, coming after them with a vengeance
Dunbar, sprinting towards the clearing, bullets at his heels and as he bursts from the tree line he looks up to see a (
) And then  killed the last of them
- Nunez, chest blown open, going down
-- And we're back to the interrogation
Dunbar, stubbing out a cigarette and looking up at Hardy and Osborne
Can  have some coffee
Osborne blinks, like a trance has been broken
Yeah
yeah, sure
She goes over to the machine and pours a cup
You shot Childs and Nunez
They would have killed us both
You want me to write a confession, 'll write a confession
You saved Kendall's life- But not Pike's
Osborne hands him the coffee
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place
66
Would you have believed me
Their faces say "no"
Osborne spreads a  out on the table
Where's the cabin
Don't know on a map
West told us it was there, we just found it
Maybe the hurricane took it away
Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony
Otherwise this is just another story- Mr
Hardy,  joined the army for college money
didn't ask for any of this -  tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed
You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them
don't want to die
--  -- Hardy and Osborne, walking and talking
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or ho hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike
And they're smart about it
They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness
Dunbar
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned
You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events
67
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the Cover story- Kendall maybe would have agreed, but The hurricane buttfucks the cabin- Buttfucks the cabin
And all hell breaks loose
lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber
That bugs you too
Little bit
Let's go talk to Bill
'  -- Hardy and Osborne stand in front of an agitated Styles
He tries to take a hit off his asthma inhaler and gets nothing
Frustrated, he tosses it away
Fucking asthma
This whole thing's driving it nuts
beat
What  said before- 68
Was dead right
You think Dunbar's on the level
Yeah
Does Osborne agree
Yes, sir,  do
Hardy lays a piece of paper on Styles' desk
Dunbar's confession
It should be enough to get you out of trouble
Styles looks at it and then slowly up to Hardy
You want Kendall, don't you
He tried to burn Dunbar to us
You don't do that if you're not involved
Hardy nods, agreeing
Styles stares at them
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong
it's not just me in the hot seat anymore
We know
(to Hardy) 'm giving you a chance to walk away
We know
Styles nods and looks to his desk
Almost to himself: You don't get to be a Colonel without compromising
Without getting out of the way of the bigger dogs
You politic, play it safe, think of the career first
And when things get dirty, you just look the other way
He looks back up at Hardy
His eyes, steeled
69
Four of my men are dead
You think Kendall had something to do with it, then you go get the son of a bitch
'   -- Kendall lies in his bed, looking worse than before
Hardy and Osborne enter
Pike never confessed
We've been making progress,  see
Osborne looks to her watch
Kendall notices
Running out of time, are we
Tick- Tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop
Fifty minutes
Not much time to solve the crime
Tell me, detective, how did it feel taking blood money from Guissepe Torres
Did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar- How many murders did you cover up
One
Five
Maybe an even ten
(to Osborne) Can  go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot
Kendall begins coughing
think they're giving me the wrong medicine
This isn't a very good Hospital, you know- Hardy sighs and goes to the sink to get him some water
70
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system
Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer
My heart weeps
He returns with a    and hands it to Kendall
Pike never confessed
No, but it got you interested, didn't it
Got you to dig
Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong
Is it the truth
There's that word again
(smiling) As  told you,  wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting
Dunbar says you were
Then he's mistaken
You know, really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning- Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi
You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life- So  should stay silent about his misdeeds
The guns went off,  ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun- Dunbar was running out the door
Ohhhhhh
See that's where  was confused, because  thought you said Nunez was running out the door
71
No
said Dunbar
Huh
You know,  really thought you said Nunez
thought you said "Dunbar was gone," My fault,  gotta check the tape on that
(off Kendall's look) Oh, yeah we taped the last interview
This one too
Cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie
Silence
They wait for Kendall's reaction
He looks momentarily flustered by this
and then he smiles
believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide
" Well
Sorry to disappoint
'm on painkillers for the injury - they cloud the mind
You're right, it was Nunez
Any more questions
Hardy doesn't know what to say
That was his ace card
Don't get me wrong, Mueller and Childs were quite the pair, the type of guys you didn't feel comfortable going to sleep around
Completely capable of murder
But as  said, didn't hear the exchange before the shooting
wasn't in the room
Osborne furrows her brow at this as Hardy continues
Dunbar will testify that you were
Then we'll leave it up to the courts - His word against mine
What does his father do again
Steelworker
(smiling) Doesn't matter, 'm sure justice will be served
In any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son
He's quite protective
72
Osborne turns to Hardy
need to talk to you outside
--  -- Osborne and Hardy, exiting the room
Whispering: We're fucked,  know- They got their stories straight
What
What Kendall said - "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around
" That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter
Are you sure
Positive
Hardy, they planned this
She grins
He grins back
Not bad for hostile and uncooperative, eh
'   -- Hardy and Osborne reenter, smiling
Kendall chuckles
Something funny, Levi
was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you
Hardy pulls the out  and hands it to Osborne
Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second
Good idea
73
Smiling, she stops the tape
Then turns to Kendall
You and Dunbar got your stories straight
Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you
You think you're just going to slide out of this
You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're Going to jail- You can't threaten me- Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not- Didn't do anything- Osborne laughs
It doesn't matter, Levi
We're going to find those bodies and when we do, 'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon- What
That's a fantastic idea- See,  just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then  call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission- (beginning to panic) It won't work- It will and you know why
() 74
Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights
So 'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you 'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off
She finishes, breathing hard
Kendall, totally cowed
Hardy, trying to suppress a smile
Osborne rises for the door
Enjoy your flight to Washington- Wait- What
Silence
Kendall takes a deep breath
Dunbar's telling the truth
Wrong answer- We did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone
(pause) It was because  threatened him
Why
Because of what  saw
(pause) Who really killed West
Osborne holds up the microrecorder and starts the tape again
Who killed Sergeant West
Kendall stares at the recorder
long pause
Who, Levi- Childs
75
How do you know
Because  was standing next to him
He pauses, taking a shaky sip of water
was in on the  thing
He and Mueller and me, we were making thousands
West found out
Childs said we were just gonna scare him - Use my Dad's clout
had this whole speech prepared about how if he ratted us, his career was over
We met him in the creek bed but before  said anything
--   -- West stands in front of Childs and Kendall, facing them
Kendall opens his mouth to speak, but Childs steps forward and raises his rifle,
'   -- swear,  didn't know he was gonna do it
After, he told me we were gonna pin it on Pike, one of our biggest customers
-- As they   to the, chair
(
) Nobody'd believe the word of a black junkie ex-con against ours
Childs gives Kendall a look that says "Stay quiet"
(
) He told me 'd better keep quiet, or 'd end up the same as West
Pan over to Dunbar, who binds his friend, sadly
(
) Dunbar didn't know anything about any of it
Everything he told you was true, except after
76
-- Dunbar pulls Kendall from the cabin's wreckage
As Kendall begins to talk to him, Dunbar's eyes widen in shock
(
) told him what had really happened to West
Told him to keep quiet about it or 'd destroy him
Because if it came out that  was involved with the whole  scam, my father would be finished
'   -- scared Dunbar into silence
He's been trying to cover for me the whole time
We got here, you came to  see me
didn't know if  could trust him with that kind of secret- So you framed him
The same way Childs was going to frame Pike
Kendall nods
Crying a little
Little advice, Levi, next time you frame a guy, pick someone who can't defend themselves
Kendall says nothing
What happened with Nunez
He came after us
And  told Dunbar he had to kill him
-- The helicopter, hovering overhead
Dunbar, carrying Kendall, spinning his rifle to face Nunez, sixty yards away
Dunbar hesitates before firing, not wanting to
Do it
Dunbar's rifle
'   -- And he did
77
Kendall finishes, wiping his face
Osborne turns to Hardy
That's how you do good cop/bad cop
Hardy smiles and gets up
Walking slowly to Kendall's bed
Childs did it, huh
Kendall nods, still a little teary
First Pike, then Mueller, now Childs
When are we getting to the others
When are we gonna hear about Nunez
- , in the creek bed,
Or Dunbar
- Now ,
Or you, Levi
When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him
- ,
didn't- But you can't prove it
You can't prove anything until we find the bodies
Kendall, crying harder now, beginning to shake
You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them
don't know- Where are they
Maybe- - 78
- And then
His mouth
Teeth cracking together over and over again like a metronome on speed, and his body , going horizontal,
Osborne, leaping to her feet
Get something between his teeth
Hardy grabs a fork from the bedside table and tries to shove it into Kendall's chattering mouth
His teeth, on the metal and Hardy's hand, drawing blood
Shit
The Nurse bursts into the room
What is- He's an epileptic
The Nurse runs to the bed, pushing Hardy aside
As more runs into the room, they usher Hardy and Osborne to the door
You're going to have to wait outside- He's a witness
It doesn't matter, outside- ------Fuh- Osborne tries to move to him, but the Doctor blocks her path
He's trying to say something- Out,
Fuh-Fuh-Fuh-Fuh-Fuh- Osborne knocks the Doctor down and runs to Kendall's side
79
Kendall looks up, focusing on Osborne, a slight moment of clarity in his eyes
Fuh-Fucking Pike
And relapses into   as   drag Hardy and Osborne from the room
--   -- Later
Hardy and Osborne sit in silence, eyes downcast
Waiting
Hardy pulls his last cigarette from the pack, lights it, crumples the pack and tosses it into a garbage can
pushed him too hard
You couldn't have known- Yeah,  could've
Should've
You wanted to get the truth
No,  didn't
wanted to humiliate him
For what he did to Dunbar
For fucking over the little guy
You mean the falsely accused
Hardy looks up at her and nods
You wanted to break him
Yeah
So did
She looks back to the floor
Hardy takes a drag from the cigarette, and then tosses that away too
The door opens and Styles walks into the room
Somber
It's over
Time of death was 4:42
() 80
(') 's been notified and  called the Senator myself
My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable
you two had no culpability in the matter
That's horseshit and you know it
Maybe
But it's my fault and 'll carry it
He sighs and takes a seat next to them
We found the cabin
Demolished, like they said
No bodies
Hurricane like that coulda scooped 'em up, dropped them down two counties over
We'll find them
Hardy says nothing
You think you could explain all this to me
wouldn't know where to start
(pause) guess it was about one man framing another
He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings
Styles nods, understanding
What happens to Dunbar now
Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done
You'll understand if  don't walk you out
Hardy gets up to go and then stops
Realizing something
They're taking your command, aren't they
The Senator
He points to Kendall's hospital room
81
'm sorry, Bill
Don't be
'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world
You're a good soldier, Bill
thought you said that wasn't a compliment
Hardy smiles
This time it is
--   -- The sun, beginning to dip in the sky, as Hardy and Osborne exit the hospital
Your car's in the motor pool
'll walk you over
They walk in silence, for a bit
So what now
Now  go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened
Think it'll work
Nah
They pass a    doing drills
Hardy, watching them
Almost looking wistful
You know, you never told me why you left the army
It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority
and all  did here was follow orders
It didn't add up
82
[') Plus,  got kicked out
For what
That's gonna stay my secret
-- Hardy and Osborne make their way towards Hardy's car
We were close to something with Kendall
Maybe
Maybe we were nowhere near
Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries
(pause) haven't by any chance grown on you, have
No
Good, just making sure
Osborne turns to the
We're going need a vehicle release
The Sergeant nods, walking up with a clipboard
Sign here and here
(recognizing them) Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night
Yeah
Terrible tragedy
One of those Section Eight boys worked in here
Pike
Heard he got out okay
Hardy signs the clipboard and hands it back
Hate to be the bearer of bad news, Sergeant, but he didn't make it
83
The Sergeant scratches his head
Funny
swear  saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar- You mean Ray Dunbar
Well, that ain't right
Why not
saw 'em get off the chopper
White guys, right
Two So
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black
Hardy and Osborne stare at him
Shocked beat
Did  say something wrong- (to Osborne) What runway's that transport leaving from
Four- Get in
--   -- as Hardy's car      , across the grass towards the far side of the base
Hardy, white knuckling the wheel, doing his best to steer around anyone who can't get out of the way in time
-- Large   sits on the runway waiting as three 's and a   lead Dunbar/Pike (who, for purposes 0 continuity, we will continue to call ) out to it
84
The    as Hardy's car  around the corner of the nearest building and  to a halt by the plane
Hardy and Osborne, leaping out, running towards Dunbar and the
s
We need to talk to him- Sorry, Officer, we have a schedule To keep- We need to talk to him now
Hardy grabs Dunbar by the arm
We're not finished yet- You wanna bet
's, escort this man off the base
(smiling) Sorry, detectives
Time's up
As the
's grab Hardy, dragging him away
Osborne, trying to stop them
Dunbar, climbing the stairs onto the plane
Osborne pulls her , levelling it at him as Hardy yells: James Randall Pike,
Dunbar stops at the hatchway
Slowly turning back to them
Seeing the gun
The
's release Hardy
Nobody moves
Let's go have a talk
-- Hardy and Osborne roughly lead Dunbar into the room, the Lawyer trailing behind, shouting: This is your entire career here- Fuck off
She slams the door and  it
Turns to Hardy
85
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down
Right back where we started
You want to talk about baseball now
Hardy practically throws Dunbar into a chair
No more games, right, Pike
It was you who West singled out
-  on the parade grounds, now strangling on the first day
You who got hooked by Mueller's morphine
- Now  in the showers as  hands him a syringe
You who did it all
Hardy steps forward and   Dunbar's right sleeve, revealing the
You wanted revenge on West, revenge on them all, so you killed them
-- Dunbar standing in the Cabin; Mueller, Childs, and Pike, dead at his feet
(
) But that wasn't enough
You needed a new identity, because no one was going to believe James Randall Pike, convicted felon, had acted so nobly in the face of danger - you needed a name people could trust, one that hadn't been to jail, one that hadn't publicly been West's bitch boy
He stares down at the bodies in the cabin, his eyes focusing on the black man's uniform
The name on it reads - ""
As he reaches for it
86
-- You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end
You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too
Can't do that now, though, can you
You walked into the army a convicted felon with a sentence of five years in a uniform and were going walk out eight weeks later with a different name, a clean record, and an honorable discharge - a guy who did "everything he could" to save his friends
Dunbar looks at them
One to the other
Slowly
Is that what  did, now
And of course, you can prove all of it
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar
Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself- Did  ever claim  was Raymond Dunbar
Was  ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record
No
You assumed who  was, because was wearing this uniform
Don't believe me
He reaches under the table and rips out the
Check your tapes
Hardy and Osborne exchange an uneasy glance
We don't need the tapes- Oh, you don't
What else do you have on me
You haven't found any bodies yet, have you
We've found all of them
87
Dunbar chuckles at the bluff
Ohhhh,  don't think so
How do you know that
Just a guess
Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be
Maybe somebody moved them
Habeas Corpus - no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense
Face it detectives
you have nothing
Hardy, knowing he's right
In a flash he reaches down '  and grabs Dunbar,  him up against the wall, pressing the weapon
Not true, Cadet, 've got a gun- (terrified) Jesus
Hardy, what are you doing- Isn't this how your story goes
Pike annoys someone so much he gets shot in the head- Please, please don't- on the locked door
Hardy ignores it
We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you- Hardy, for Chrissakes- ' '
(practically in tears) You'll never find it- Hardy  the pistol as Dunbar screams: 88
You'll never find it cause ' as the door's lock  and
's  into the room
Styles and the  Lawyer behind, taking in the scene
What in God's name is going on
Hardy releases Dunbar, who slides to the floor, gasping
He- He made me do it- Do what
Hunting- we had to hunt him- Sergeant, arrest these men
You mean the exercise
There never was an exercise
Never targets, never teams,  don't even know if there's a creek bed out there- As the
's grab Hardy and Osborne, pulling them away
What did you do
That's enough- Goddammit, what did you
'
He breaks down sobbing
Styles holds up a hand to the
's
Hang on
Colonel- No
want to hear this
89
The  Lawyer glowers as the
's stand down
Dunbar tries to pull himself together
To Hardy: You're right
was the one he singled out
Beat me morning, noon, and night, ran me ragged
When Mueller found me,  was gone
He gave me a little taste
-- Mueller showing the syringe to the naked Dunbar
Dunbar's voice over speaks in unison with Mueller: (
) got a friend with an in at the , can hook you up
-- What  didn't know, was his friend was West
He ran the whole thing
You're lying, son
You think it's easy to have all that morphine just disappear without a higher up authorizing it
Check the requisition orders, 'll lay money it's his signature on them
-- Dunbar, alone, sleeve rolled up, arm tied off: Sliding the needle into his vein
(
) That was his game, see
Ride the cadets so hard they'd need something to stay on their feet
Then he'd send Mueller or Kendall to them, waving around their magic needle promising to make it all go away
He hits the plunger, injecting
His face goes tranquil
-- It wasn't a new thing either
He'd been doing this for years
() 90
Every nine weeks, a new class of cadets, new potential customers
The amount of money involved over that period of time
this was some high stakes shit
He takes a deep breath, looking at them
Dunbar moved his through the kitchen
worked in the motor pool and hooked all the mechanics
By the time the hurricane hit, we were all in
Some using, some pushing, some both
But then something happened
West heard one of us was about to talk, to blow his whole operation
He figured he'd made enough money, had enough of the army, maybe it was time to disappear
But first he was gonna teach us one last thing
-- West, entering the,barracks, shouting the cadets awake
(
) The Tuesday Night drill was the perfect cover
The hurricane made it even better
--  -- The cadets, climbing aboard the chopper
(
) He put us on the chopper and flew us to his cabin
And then he told us
-- The six men stand in rigid formation, eyes on West
Gentlemen
It has come to my attention that there is a traitor in our midst
Someone who was going to break the code of fraternal brotherhood that  have endeavored to create in all of you
Perhaps that failure is mine
But we take care of our own
And this traitor must be made to pay
He walks down the line of the six men, eyeing each of them
Finally stopping at one
Putting a hand on his shoulder
91
Nunez
Run
Sir,  wasn't- know you were
Cadet  Mueller found the letter you'd written to the Colonel in your locker
You were going to betray us all
Now, run
He points to the door
The hurricane,  outside
Nunez looks to the others, then the door, and understands
He takes off running out the door
Gone
West walks over to a table covered with a tarp
Pulls the cloth aside to reveal -16's, , and
Now we'll see whose training's paid off the most
You are to hunt Cadet Nunez down and bring his body back to me
If you fail and he escapes, we all go down together
The remaining five cadets, understanding there is no place for friendship or kindness here
This is life and death
They walk to the table and gear up
-- Lightning, thunder, and rain as Nunez runs unarmed through the thick brush
- The other five fan out, rifles up, following his trail, ready to kill
(
) It was insanity
We were hunting a man down to kill him
Making his way down embankment, -l6 out, ready for anything
From behind him,
(
) He got Mueller first
Nunez   at full speed, feet  on the wet hill, and the two  head first into a
Punching, kicking, biting, anything to stop the other man
92
Nunez,  Mueller as he strains to reach his gun
Roberto
With a , Nunez
Mueller lies still
(
) He took his gun
Used it on Childs
Nunez spins, seeing
He  as Childs fires
Hits the ground in a roll, comes up with Mueller's rifle, and  -    against the wet rocks
(
) can't imagine what it was like
Having your friends try to kill you
Nunez slumps against the gully's wall, breathing hard
In agony over what he's just had to do
(
) But you do what you have to survive
Closing his eyes, Nunez steels himself
Wipes the blood from his hands and climbs out of the gully
, creeping through the foliage
Trying to listen for sounds of movement through the storm
His eyes narrow as he hears a
The bullet hits his forehead dead center
He crumples
- Nunez in a tree, thirty meters away
Lowering his rifle
He climbs down
(
) Kendall and  found Dunbar a couple minutes later
: Dunbar and Kendall come upon Pike's fallen form
They gaze down at the uniform emblazoned with the name ""
(
) It came to me in a split second
Change clothes, change identities
If James Pike gets discharged he goes right back to jail
But if was Dunbar,  could walk away from all this with a new life
But then
As he reaches down for the uniform, a
93
, wounded in the arm
Dunbar raises his rifle to find Nunez, standing ten yards away, gun trained on him
: Put it down
Mexican stand-off
The rain continues to fall
just want to go
Nunez shakes his head
You were gonna kill me, Pike
Thought you were my friend
Dunbar, torn
He can't bring himself to shoot, but he can't surrender either
have to get Kendall to a hospital
He was gonna kill me too
Silence
The two men still facing each other
{') snapped Mueller's neck
He was my best friend and  had to snap his neck because he was gonna shoot me for drugs
For West
We don't have to do this
You go that way, 'll go this way
Nunez laughs
You'll shoot me in the back
You killed three people
Isn't that enough for one night
More silence
Neither moves
The sky above, a maelstrom
don't want to die out here, Roberto
Do you
Nunez, staring at him
Deciding
94
If you even twitch
Dunbar nods
Nunez begins backing away, rifle still trained on him
And then Dunbar spies something behind and to the left of Nunez
West
Staring down at him from behind some brush
Watching
Nunez, slowly backing away
He pauses as his foot catches on a fallen branch
Looks away from Dunbar for a split second to step over it
West nods to Dunbar as if to say "Go on
" Forgive me
And Dunbar
Nunez, caught by the burst,
The echo of the gunshots, swallowed by the storm
Dunbar lowers his head in agony
West walks down
Congratulations, Cadet Pike
You get the gold star
Dunbar stares at his Sergeant through the rain
Fuck you
West smiles
Tilts his head to Kendall
You'd best get him out of here
Don't worry about the bodies, they'll be taken care of
Dunbar doesn't move
This is where we part ways, Cadet
You tell them  died out here, or 'll come back for you
Tell them one of the others did me
Mueller, Childs,  don't care who
You and Kendall, you tell them a story
(smiling) You can tell a story, can't you
Dunbar doesn't reply
West laughs and flips him a salute
95
Dismissed
And West turns and walks away, stepping over Nunez
Giving Dunbar a clear shot at his back
Dunbar raises his rifle, wanting, needing, dying to shoot the old man
But he can't
West disappears into the bayou
from the ground
Kendall
Dunbar's reverie broken, he leans down, beginning to unbutton the Dunbar Uniform
-- Dunbar stubs out a cigarette, finished
Hardy, Osborne, Styles, and the  Lawyer gaping at what he has just said
guess Nunez wasn't dead after all
He came after us with a vengeance
(to Styles) You know the rest
And the bodies
You won't find them
Won't find West, either
He's too good
No bodies, no West
No death certificates
No crime
Just four people
Silence
The  Lawyer steps forward
You'll testify to this, the corruption, the drug scam
Dunbar says nothing
We can cut a deal for you on the Nunez killing
don't want any deals
96
If you're telling the truth, the requisition records will prove it- All the proof you need will be when West comes back and puts a bullet in my brain
But 'll do it
'm a dead man, anyway
Like Kendall
(looking at Hardy) We both should have died out there with our brothers
know that now
Silence
The  Lawyer looks to Hardy, all anger gone
'll take him now if you don't mind
Hardy nods
Dunbar rises and slowly walks to the door
Turning back to Hardy
Tell me, detective
Did you get what you wanted
Hardy shakes his head, sadly
Not even close
They leave
Styles walks over to Hardy
Tom- Hardy holds up a hand, cutting him off
Styles nods, understanding, and leaves, closing the door behind him
Hardy and Osborne stand there
Not speaking
It's done
-- '  -- Several hours and bourbons later, Hardy sits at the bar, drunk and alone
Out of place, the only one not in uniform
Osborne walks in, locates Hardy, and strides over to the bar, a sheaf of papers under her arm
Her face, stoic
We need to talk- Seven
He takes a slug of his drink
What
97
Seven guys
What was it you said
You were "just starting to believe wasn't the guy people said"
He chuckles
{') Seven
That's the answer to Kendall's question
How many
Seven
Osborne looks at him
Realizing what he's saying
This isn't the time- This is the perfect time
You know what makes a good detective
The number of confessions they get
You're a good detective, Osborne
So now you get mine
What if  don't want it
Tough
He pours himself another drink
Thing about    taking money is, you don't have    to do anything
You just sit there
Maybe you don't return a phone call
Maybe you don't follow up a lead
But that's it
Keep the money, your    work's done
Osborne stares at him
Seven unsolved murders
And you know what
It didn't weigh on my conscience
Not one goddamn bit
He takes a slug from his glass and grimaces
That's not true
There are degrees of truth, officer
Always degrees
98
You're a good man, Hardy
Really
Far as 'm concerned, whatever you did in the past can stay in the past
Hardy stares at her
may not be growing on you, but you're sure as hell growing on me
He motions to the bartender for another glass, but Osborne takes his hand, stopping him
And because you're a good man, know you'll do the right thing
Hardy looks at her, questioning
Osborne takes a deep breath
Pike never made it to
Somebody took him off the plane before it left
My guess is he's already dead
Hardy stares at her
West
Nobody saw
But  don't think so
She puts the papers on the bar
These are the requisitions from the , the ones used to release the drugs to Mueller
West signed half of them - Pike was telling the truth
Look who signed the other half
She taps the bottom of the paper
Hardy, not wanting to believe it
He looks up at her, pained
Do  have a choice in this
Yeah
can wait till you're off the base and do it myself
99
Hardy stares at his glass
Deciding
Fuck it
Let's go finish this
'  -- Styles, finishing his paperwork
He rises and turns off his desk light, bathing the office in
He's about to leave when he notices a  in the doorway
"You have to get out of the way of the bigger dogs"
That was good
Styles squints at the figure
Tom, is that you
Hardy steps forward, into the office
It was so good,  actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now
The Base Commander
The one in control
You couldn't let him testify, could you
What are you talking about
If you let him testify then it would have all come out
West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear
But it got messy and people got killed
So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you
You're drunk- 'm not going to cover for you, Bill
Not for this
Styles, realizing what Hardy's talking about
Look- He begins to move from behind his desk
100
Stay where you are
Or what
You've gone round the bend- West had a partner
Someone who knew how to get things done
Hardy throws the papers onto Styles' desk
What  can't understand is why you signed these
If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless
So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too
That's preposterous- Toxicology report came back
Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it
It's for asthmatics
If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them
checked with the nurses at the hospital - you're the only other person who visited Kendall
Wanted to see if he was okay- You poisoned him, Bill
You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike
'm not even going to dignify that- No
You will stand there and you will listen
What happened to you, Bill
You were the one who joined up to do good in the world
You were the one who believed in it- 101
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character
The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct
There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you
Not for long
He walks towards the desk
No more witnesses
West's a ghost
But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report
And that'll be enough
You're crazy- You can't duck this, Bill
may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but  won't let this happen
For the last time,  have no idea what you're talking about- (squinting) Get your hands away from the desk
In the darkness we see Styles
Osborne, gun
Hardy  to the floor - Osborne in the doorway, raised,
Muzzle flare lighting the room for a split second as Styles is   against the wall
Hardy gets to his feet and flicks on the
Styles lies slumped in the corner, two holes in his chest
Dead
Osborne lowers her weapon, shaking
Hardy points to the top desk drawer, which is open
Inside it sits an
Fully loaded, safety off
It's presence tells them everything they need to know
102
It's West's, isn't it
Hardy nods and then turns to look down at Styles' body
Now it's over
--   -- The aftermath
Flashing blue and red lights from parked Military Police vehicles illuminate the grounds as
' string crime scene tape around the front entrance of the building, securing the site for investigation
Hardy takes in the entire scene from afar
Standing by his , watching as several
's finish questioning Osborne
When she's done she spies Hardy and walks over to him
What are you doing out here
Leaving without saying goodbye
What are you gonna do
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened
Think it'll work
Nah
Want company
Osborne smiles
word of advice about women - that first hour or so after they kill their boss
Probably not the best time to hit on them
should probably write that down
Yeah
Hardy pulls a card from his pocket and hands it to her
Your phone number
103
In case you need me to testify about the shooting
They'll clear you
beat
He was your friend
Yeah
But he was a lot of other things, too
Thanks
She nods
An awkward moment
Finally: 'll see you
He turns away
Walking towards his car
Hey, Hardy
He turns back
She walks up and holds something out to him
ten dollar bill
owe you this
He looks down at the money
You saved my life tonight
Keep it
(pause) Actually, don't keep it,  need the money
He takes the bill and Osborne laughs
He climbs into his car and starts it
Grinning at her through the open window
You're one of the good ones, Osborne
Don't sweat the details
He puts the  in gear and drives off
She watches him go, then looks down at his card
Smiling
Maybe she will call
'  -- bottle of Scotch at her side, Osborne slips a tape marked "   -
" into her
Settles back to watch it
West's face fills the screen
Welcome, Cadets
The art of warfare is simple and complex
Simple in its goal, complex in its execution
104
'  () -- It's started to rain
Hardy drives in silence
As Sun Tzu writes, the true warfare is deception
up ahead
Hardy pulls over for him
'  -- Osborne, drinking and watching
At all times you must confuse your enemies, surrounding them with uncertainty, giving them false hope
'  -- The Hitchhiker gets into the car
At all times, you must mask your true intentions
Hardy, smiling at him, because the Hitchhiker is not a Hitchhiker at all
(
) Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray
The Hitchhiker is Dunbar
(
) They got their stories straight
--   -- 24 hours ago
The hurricane rages
pulls the  on a phosphorous grenade and
It blows, frying brush and nothing more
West comes over the hill, running to investigate
He stops at what he sees
Nunez stands unarmed in the creek bed, by the other Section Eight Cadets
prisoner
What the fuck is going on
Your weapons, Sergeant
West doesn't move
Kendall walks over and  West, pushing him into the circle next to the terrified Nunez
105
Is this about that little drug business you all are running
Yeah, know about that, Roberto told me- Shut up
Look, we won't say anything- Fuck that
You little pissers really think you can throw a scare into me
Dunbar raises his rifle and
He goes down, twitches once and lies still
Dead
West looks at Dunbar
You're gonna have to do a lot better than that, son
(
) How about this
And with that, Tom Hardy emerges from the brush carrying, a West's eyes sparkle with recognition
Didn't  kick your ass out for this drug thing fifteen years ago
Hardy just smiles
Should've known you were involved in this
Come on then
Let's see you try and stick me- Moving faster than   West thought imaginable, Hardy moves and the knife ,      stem to sternum
Hardy grips the older man   by the shoulders, lowering him to the ground as he dies
Whispering in his ear: Stem to sternum
You taught me well, Sarge
And
moment of utter silence and then begin coming back to us: (
) You think you could explain all this to me
Kendall walks over to Hardy and hands him a
(
) wouldn't know where to start
Kendall holds out his arm, gritting his teeth
106
(
) guess it was about one man framing another
And Hardy  Kendall once,
-- Mueller and Childs lay 's   out in the brush
The sound of the Helicopter approaching
: Dunbar raises his rifle and  towards the tree line
Aiming at nothing
The Helicopter comes into view overhead
around Dunbar and Kendall - bullet hits
(
) When you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy
'  - Watching this through the windscreen
(
) The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up
- Hardy, concealed in the woods,  at Dunbar and Kendall's feet to simulate Nunez shooting at them
Dunbar, shooting towards where Nunez's body lies
Making it look like he just killed Nunez
-- Hardy arriving at the Fort,
And for that to work, you have to have a witness
to , watching
(
) Someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned
-- Of Hardy and Osborne, investigating the case, talking to Dunbar, talking to Kendall
You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe
107
'  -- Osborne, showing Hardy the requisition forms
(
) They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent
-- After shooting Styles, Osborne gives her story to the
's
(
) And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the world
'  -- Osborne, watching the taped West
Your greatest weapon will by your allies
-- Hardy, taking a cigarette from Dunbar's pack
My brand
Must be my lucky day
'   -- Kendall, coughing fit
Hardy, getting him a
(
) some of which you may have to sacrifice for the greater good
Hardy, secretly dissolving a  into Kendall's water
(
) We got the toxicology report
'  -- Hardy, confronting Styles in the dark
(
) Make no mistake, the innocent will die
Osborne,   into Styles
As he hits the wall 108
(
) Next time you frame a guy, pick someone who can't defend themselves
But it will not be in vain
Sometimes, you can trick the enemy into doing your work for you
Osborne, staring down at '
(
) He still carry those guns
'  -- Earlier
Alone, Hardy plants West's pistol in Styles' desk
(
) if you engage in a clever enough subterfuge
--  -- Hardy stands behind Kendall and Dunbar, overseeing them as they fill out requisition forms
Kendall signs West's signature, Dunbar signs Styles'
(
) What  can't understand is why you signed these
As we move into a   on Hardy: (
) You never told me why you got kicked out of
(
) The army kicked you out for drugs
(
) got a friend with an in at the , can hook you up
(
) There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you
'  -- Osborne, watching the tape of West's speech
Which brings us to the simple goal
For the true warrior, the one and only objective is to emerge from conflict unscathed
109
-- The  pulls into a space and Hardy and Dunbar get out
(
) promised them 'd ask you where West and the others are
(
) Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"
(
) He's telling the truth up to a point
They walk towards the bar's entrance
(
) You can't prove anything until we find the bodies
All we gotta do is tell the story right
(
) You haven't found any bodies yet, have you
As Hardy and Dunbar push through the doors into the bar
(
) -- table of   look up as Hardy and Dunbar enter
Mueller, Childs, Pike, and the Motor Pool
All drinking beer, having a grand old time
(
) Habeas Corpus - you have to have a body to have a crime
Hardy and Dunbar smile and go to join them
'  -- As the taped West concludes his speech
Thank you
110
The screen cuts to
Osborne turns off the , extinguishing the last source of light
: (
) You can tell a story, can't you
-- Silence
We slowly move towards Hardy's parked
(
) Murder is basic
Focusing on the
(
) There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings
-- ' , stuffed into the trunk of Hardy's car
Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne
-- Dunbar lays the wounded Kendall down as the Helicopter carrying Styles comes in for a landing
Dunbar wipes the sweat from Kendall's brow and asks him seriously: Are you ready for this
