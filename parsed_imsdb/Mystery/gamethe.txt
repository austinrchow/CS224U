It's a game of pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey
The dizzy boy is given a strip of felt, and the  follows as he stumbles toward a large cardboard donkey
He pins the tail on its nose

He's a serious-looking child, who adjusts his glasses as he poses for a shot with his mother,
, a stiff-looking society matron
brings over an  and gently places the baby in Schuyler's arms
Schuyler is ultra-careful, over- whelmed by the responsibility of holding his tiny  ()

and the other children sit spellbound, watching a magic show in the front -- a  waves a colored handkerchief, a

, a pinched, depressive man of about 40, wearing glasses
He stands on a high balcony at the top story of the mansion, in a bathrobe, smoking a cigarette
The unseen photographer   jerkily on the man
When he realizes he's being photographed, Mr
Van Orton turns his back and goes inside the house
The film  and runs into -- : 6
-      ( ) Early morning, the same mansion (ideally an ornate Victorian or Arts & Crafts)
The landscaping has changed, there are some modern touches, such as an iron gate surrounding the carriageway, a black 500-class  in the drive
,  to a     as the where we'd seen Mr
Van Orton earlier
it's now  and -
We move

- a large master bedroom; neat, masculine and Spartan, free weights, a treadmill
Atop the bed a   runs -  plays , a familiar (we'll assume  )
The Bang & Olufsen , 6:30 am;   now  with the  report

- In the steam-filled bathroom, we make out   , now 38
He's handsome, fit and apparently in complete control of his world
He steps out of the shower, wraps a towel around himself and grabs the
(on phone) Van Orton
Yes, it is my birthday, Bob, is that why you called
Ah
No, 'm not carrying Alan Baer another inch, fuck him,  Lumber is history
As he speaks, he continues his morning ritual-- hair combing, - tips, etc
(Schuyler is a man in almost constant motion
) 9
- The black Mercedes moves quickly through morning traffic
10
'        - is on his car phone,    in , maneuvering aggressively through traffic
His laptop  in the passenger seat, its cellular antenna up
(on carphone) Ignore the rumors, Alan, you know me, of course 'm behind Baer- Grace a hundred per cent
great, see you at the shareholders' meeting next month
He hangs up and  at another driver, displaying no emotion
11
- through an elegant suite of offices
He passes a discreet sign: "
"  Schuyler is on a cell- phone, carrying the laptop, trailed by , his middle-aged secretary
She bears paperwork and patiently awaits his attention
(on cellphone) 've got buyers for the  paper mill, goose the lawyers, final papers in three weeks
sure it's sad, but an old dog loses its teeth and pisses itself, you put it to sleep
As Schuyler walks, he's  by passing , whom he ignores
He   the phone, Maria hands him a couple of items, follows him into his office
Carol from the museum called
She's sending architect's sketches of the wing
12
'           - The office is large, tasteful, reeks of old money
window overlooks the San Francisco skyline and the Bay
That Business Week reporter called again-- Tell him to fuck himself
Nicely
(awkwardly) --and, um, somebody who identified himself as, um,
Willy
at this, stares at her
Sorry,  figured it was a crank, but he swore you'd know who he was
He wanted to meet you for lunch,  told him you had appointments all-- Cancel
Cancel the whole afternoon
But you-- Do it
Did he leave a number
No
He just said he'd be at Leo's in the Haight
At noon
Maria hands him a slip of paper, lingers, awaiting explanation
That's all, Maria
She heads out quickly
Schuyler stares at the slip, then turns to look out the window, lost in thought
: 13
'   - working class bar, an  or two, pinball machines
sits a table near a window, checking his watch, it's not his kind of place
arrives in a too-small uniform-- young, multiple earrings,  according to her name tag
Can  take your order
haven't seen the menu
Oh, right
Here, see ya
She hands him a menu and starts off
Schuyler calls after her
An iced tea, please-- She waves a hand, "yeah, right," without looking back
Schuyler sighs and opens the menu
Suddenly, someone  the side of his skull, he assumes a defensive posture
Schuyler sees his brother:
Yo, Sky
Happy birthday
(rubs his head, annoyed) Thanks, "Pee-pee
"   never get tired of that
slides into the seat opposite him
He's in his early 30's, good-looking but unkempt, wears bright, funky clothes, an earring and a perpetual grin
There's an intense, edgy quality to him which Schuyler has some trouble readjusting to
Well
long time
Yeah, since Mom died-- what, five years
So how you been
Business as usual
How's Elizabeth
Any kids
little girl
Congrat-- It's not mine, she married a pediatrician in Sausalito
You're divorced
(off Schuyler's nod) Too bad, she was actually interesting
She stopped drinking,  guess getting rid of me was the 13th step
So you're all alone in the House of Pain
redecorated
Where have you been
All over
Nowhere in particular
Didn't your fucking gumshoes keep you informed of my every movement
called them off two years ago, David
You'd kicked the heroin, you'd left the ashram, you were windsurfing somewhere in Central America
It's gorgeous down there
you should go sometime
Look, are you in trouble, is there anything you need
You can't have gone through the trust fund
(looks at him, hurt) That's not why 'm here, Sky, just wanted to see you
even brought a gift, for a change
You didn't bake me a cake, did you
You can't still be mad about the hash brownies
Schuyler's unamused by the memory
David grins and pulls a small envelope out of his pocket, tosses it on the table in front of him
Happy birthday, bro
What is this
It's a bomb
Open it
Schuyler shrugs, opens the envelope and shakes out-- in  and :  "
" The ,  and  are , a   at the bottom
picks up the card, fingers it
Consumer Recreation Services
can't tell you very much about it, that'd ruin the surprise
Just promise me you'll give 'em a call
don't get it
Just call 'em
look, it's simple, really
They entertain you
Is this an escort service
No, it's nothing like that
They're a business, they're for real
They guarantee just one thing-- you won't be bored
Schuyler gives him a bored, blank look
David throws up his hands
They make your life fun
Fun
You've heard of it
Christine the waitress has shown up with Schuyler's iced tea
She puts it down hastily, spilling some across the table
Schuyler shies away, grabbing a napkin and blotting it up before it can drip into his lap
Cracking gum: Sorry
She moves off as Schuyler tries to order, raising a finger-- Just a cheesebur
how'd you find this place
Old connection used to meet me here
So you gonna call 'em
(a sigh, carefully) You know, David, this is sweet, but it's an awfully busy time, 'm in the midst of a delicate liquidation-- (mimicking him bitterly) " delicate liquidation," God, you would do this
David-- We can't get together once without you making me feel like shit
That's important to you, isn't it
What are you talking about
Forget about it, don't bother
David slumps in his seat, won't meet Schuyler's eyes
Are you still on medication
David glares at him
With the impeccable timing of all waitresses, appears, chipper
You guys know what you want
Go away
She curls her lip and departs before Schuyler can open his mouth
He sighs, resigned to the idea of not eating
Calmly: just thought you'd like it
did, it was a blast, best thing that ever happened to me
And for your information, 'm not on anything anymore, 'm not even seeing a shrink, 'm in a better place than 've ever been, 'm even happy -- but that's something else  wouldn't be able to explain to you
, , 'll give them a call
Whatever
Look, take a pill
Just be normal for thirty seconds and tell me what this is
hate surprises
know
David , puts a finger to his lips-- not another word
as Schuyler slips the brightly-colored  into his pocket

on a high window, one of the few at this hour
We hear the

continues to
as he punches the : Van Orton
(on speaker) Hello, Schuyler
is Schuyler's ex-wife-- an earnest woman, a stranger to subtlety
, who half-smiles, looks at his watch
Eleven forty, you almost didn't make it
(on speaker) always call on your birthday
How was it
Oh, the usual, big party, circus clowns, naked lady in a cake
(on speaker) (slight chuckle; serious) How are you , Sky
She has the concerned, forthright tone of a "recovery person," someone who's been through a lot of therapy and wants to reach out
Schuyler , then mimics the tone: 'm just fine
How are you
(on speaker) It wasn't a trick question
Thirty-eight,  thought that might be a-- a difficult year for you
Hm
Just another birthday, another year closer to death
(on speaker) meant-- because of your father
Oh that's right,  guess he was 38, wasn't he
hadn't thought about it, to tell the truth, but thank you for the reminder
(on speaker) Why do  call you
honestly don't know, but it's a nice change of pace from talking to your attorneys
So, still working at the hospice
(on speaker) Mm-hmm, couple days a week
Great, that's great
Well, give my regards to Dr
Mel and the baby-- (on speaker) She has a little brother on the way
we just did the ultrasound
Really
Congratulations-- two kids, an official nuclear family, you must be very happy
(on speaker) We are, Sky
Very happy
Well, you deserved someone who wanted the same things you did-- Are you Happy
hates this question
He quickly changes the subject
Speaking of little brothers,  saw David today
(on speaker) Really
He asked about you
He's on a new kick, some personal improvement cult
'm gonna check it out, 'm sure he's getting fleeced again
(on speaker) Who knows, maybe it'll be good for you
Send David my love
Right
Well, thanks again for calling, Elizabeth, take care
(on speaker) You too, Schuyler--  mean that-- Mm, good luck, bye
He  off the phone in the middle of her "Good-bye
"  Schuyler returns to his work, as if the call hadn't taken place-- but a few seconds later, we see his concentration is completely shattered, he leans back in his  deskchair

He settles back on the sofa,
He despairs of this quickly, points the remote at his own head-- ,
He closes his eyes

He looks skyward one last time, then suddenly in a head-first dive
We hear what sounds like a -- : 25

The vehicle passes to reveal  striding toward a postmodern building in the financial district; a ramp leads to a parking garage beneath
Casually dressed, he glances up at the facade for a few moments, then goes in

- The very new, dramatic structure is built around a central twelve- story atrium narrowing to a  above
There's still some minor construction underway on the ground floor, scaffolding about
Schuyler crosses to a bank of lobby elevators
27
- Schuyler looks out the glass elevator as it rises vertiginously
as the atrium shrinks below him
28
- Partitioned work areas, terminals, clutter and disarray
Office doors open off a reception area
move about hectically
Schuyler enters, wanders about for a moment, confused
friendly female  glances up from her desk
Can  help you
Is this Consumer Recreation Services
have an appointment, the name's Van Orton
The woman flips through an appointment book with a logo, ,   pays a    for a
Hm
don't seem to-- Schuyler Van Orton,  called last week
The woman shakes her head
slows as he crosses past Schuyler, carrying the bag
He's 30-40, a no-nonsense engineer, looks a bit dull, but he exudes competence and trustworthiness
Problem
This gentlemen says he has an appointment, but
Feingold glances at Schuyler, shrugs
Van Orton, huh
'll take him
(shakes his hand) Jim Feingold, v
p
in charge of engineering and data analysis
The man leads Schuyler to a row of open boxes on the floor, looks in a couple, then finds what he's after
He snatches up a couple of pages, hands them to Schuyler
Then he finds a clipboard on the floor, tosses it to him like a frisbee
Sorry about the chaos, we're still in the process of moving
follow me, 've got an office around here someplace
He reaches into a box of , passes one to Schuyler
-- the

'          /         - modern, dramatic office
Swoopy furniture, imposing , all very cool-looking
Feingold moves behind the desk, unpacks a couple of white cartons
can't remember the last time  ate in a restaurant, all  do is work
sits on a couch, looking at the forms
know what you mean
Look-- what is all this
The fast-talking Feingold moves energetically through the office, occasionally picking at his food or poking at the air with chopsticks-- he's a bit hyper and fidgety in general
Application,  and  tests, financial statement
(indicating food) Want some
Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown
(as Schuyler shakes his head) The tests serve a threefold purpose
First off, are you right for us
Are we right for you
Unfortunately, there's a limited number of slots-- Let's back up here-- (over him) , we need an idea of your abilities and limitations, what turns you on, and off
Numero tres, our insurance company requires it
(a beat, studying Schuyler) You're familiar with our service, aren't you
Not at all
What are you selling
Well
it's a game
game
Recharges the batteries, gets you off the treadmill, it's an experience
Sort of a-- vacation for the guy who's been everywhere
This really doesn't sound like my sort of-- Feingold sits on the edge of his desk, arms crossed, nodding and smiling condescendingly-- he raises a hand to stop Schuyler
What's so amusing
Nothing
know who you are
You're David Van Orton's brother, he got you in here
So
(remembering fondly) David was-- impressive, one of the better 've seen
But frankly, can see you're not the type
The type
You know, a player
'm not a player
don't mean anything personal by it-- know you're an important guy, powerful guy, you're used to being on top
It's just, this isn't for everyone
Not everyone can handle it
(nearly losing it) What kind of fu-- game is this
The ultimate fucking game
wish could tell you more, but it's different every time
(rising) Thanks for coming in-- (doesn't move) 'm not an idiot
see what you're doing
First the vague yet intriguing pitch, then 'm supposed to feel like my manhood's in question because 'm not up for, what, some motivational role-playing fantasy nonsense-- Interesting, you don't know the first thing about it but you've already decided what it is
Listen, don't wanna waste any more-- Please, Jim, cut the hard-to-get shit
've got the afternoon free, 'll take your silly tests
Feingold cocks his head, reappraising him
Then, with a smile, he calls to an attractive young  passing in the hall; Schuyler, meanwhile, flips through the pages of the tests
Ms
Nelson, are you busy
We need someone to run Mr
Van Orton
This way, sir
As she leads Schuyler out the door, Feingold  at him
'll catch up with you after the physical
Schuyler reacts-- a physical
He throws up a hand and follows the woman into the hall
Alone now, Feingold cracks a fortune cookie and glances at the slip of paper inside
He furrows his brow with concern at the fortune-- then tosses it aside

Sorry to keep you waiting, a client's head exploded
(grins) You can get dressed, we're done
He throws open a closet door
Schuyler reaches inside for his clothes, which are neatly folded and on hangers
Feingold turns his back on him as he , perching on the examination table and studying the unburst print-outs
Looks promising at this point
You test well, you're in decent shape for someone in your tax bracket
Hm, some resistance to the psych questions, but we got the general idea
He heads out, beckons for Schuyler to follow
32
- Feingold leads him through the office--  and other pack up at the end of the day
We design the game around your schedule, you're free to give it as much or as little time as you wish
And of course, you can call it quits at any point
This was actually a gift
Did my brother pay in advance
You'd have to ask our billing department
the price varies
But our service comes with a guarantee
If you're not satisfied, there's no charge
And we've never had an unsatisfied customer
You mean dissatisfied
(looking at a form) Mm, that's right-- you're a left- brain word fetishist

Feingold smiles tightly and leads Schuyler back into his office

So 'm supposed to sign up for a game when  don't know the rules, don't know the object,  don't know how much it costs
It's a leap of faith
But at this stage, there's no commitment-- we just need to process your application
And if you qualify, you're in for the ride of your life
What have you got to lose
Schuyler  the ballpoint pen, they both lean over the papers
Initials-- initials-- sign here
Schuyler's about to sign when Feingold grabs his wrist
In blood
(a ) ---Just kidding
, as Schuyler  on the dotted line
snatches up the forms, suddenly seems in a hurry for Schuyler to go
Very good, Mr
Van Orton
Please, keep the pen
Schuyler shrugs, sticks it in his breast pocket, starts out
When can  expect to hear-- We'll be in touch
Feingold gently shuts the door on schuyler's face

) Oh, shit, sorry Sky,  spaced-- next Tuesday

What do you think John, will ever go public
(laughs) Not likely, would you
Schuyler slows down, eavesdropping, then moves toward the bar, addresses the  with a nod toward John and Pete
New members
believe so
This round's on me
Schuyler moves casually toward the men-- : 38()

Pete, the friendlier (drunker) of the two, puffs a  as he speaks: last time  played Pebble,  swore 'd never pick up a club again
The others  knowingly
Schuyler sips his drink, blinking and coughing discretely at the smoke; there's a slight pause
Great thing about golf, the way it takes you out of your life
Speaking of games--  take it you two are familiar with
Uh-oh
Time to piss
He slides off his stool
Pete studies Schuyler, sizing him up
Why do you ask, Schuyler
couldn't help overhearing-- We don't usually talk about it
only bring it up because, well, recently tested for it
Did you
Kudos
just wasn't sure if they're for real, whether it's worth it-- Worth it
Gee,  dunno
they did save my fucking life
Sorry
Look,  don't know you, you don't know me, but
hit a certain point, nothing meant anything
My work, the wife and kids-- hell with 'em,  was sick of it all, y'know
But
they changed everything
"Are they for real
"  Who cares, maybe nothing is
(raises his glass) To reality
Schuyler raises his glass, numbed by this outpouring
Pete drains his drink, chuckling to himself
His friend comes back, looking concerned, takes the man's arm
'mon Pete

You'll need it
Schuyler stares after the two men dubiously as they move off

No is not an option

Alive or dead, he doesn't want to have anything to do with this person
Shit, shit, shit

Schuyler sighs,

-               - comes out of the gate with the garment bag and a briefcase
He joins up with a  carrying a sign that says , the man takes his bag for him
'm expecting a package with some documents
Did it arrive
The man shakes his head, Schuyler, exasperated, whips out his cell- phone and dials
As he and the driver move through the , they pass a red-eyed, dredlocked, homeless-looking   in a outfit with knit cap, hassling other
He turns his attention to Schuyler and begins walking alongside
Ay mon, got sometin' fo you mon
(to the rasta) Get lost, pal
No can do
(on phone) Bob, it's Sky, what the hell is going on
No, the papers aren't here, you'll have to fax signature copies straight to the  offices now
Yeah 'll hold
The driver and Schuyler climb into a little white people mover cart, the driver starts forward,  at folks in the way
The rasta man continues to badger Schuyler
You want what  got, mon
(hand over the phone) No thank you
Dere are many paths to enlightenment, but you must choose one and stay on it-- or you will surely die in the darkness-- 'll take my chances
The rasta man jogs alongside, holds up a stained, newsprint religious , Schuyler glances at it without taking it-- -- we see the words ", ,
"  The letters , Rand  are printed in a different color from the rest
-- Schuyler ignores the tract, he's talking to Bob again on the phone
The driver   as they pass a guard, entering a restricted access area

Fire their asses, that's it
The Rasta Man runs out of breath as the cart
He calls after Schuyler: Jah Love mon, dat's the key, dat's the key

The little white truck emerges from the terminal, crosses the tarmac, heading toward an  , where is stops
From the chopper,   emerges-- he's an elderly, muscular man, bluff, once blue-collar
He gives Schuyler a firm handshake
They have to  over the  : Alan
What's wrong with a car-- 'm giving you an overview of our little operation
You gotta see the new breed of high yield saplings
looks uncomfortable with this prospect
The driver is already loading his bag into the chopper
Baer claps a hand on Schuyler's shoulder, leading him under the wash, into the chopper

He watches the   with a half-smile

How was your flight
Fine
Schuyler looks out the window

Everyone wears a stricken expression, Schuyler's tone is matter-of-fact
You've been planning this for months, haven't you
Sandbagging me like this, selling us for scrap
lumber is not profitable and hasn't been for years, my duty is to salvage what  can
These are the closing papers, in ten minutes 'm going to present the sale terms to the shareholders and elect my new management team
As he speaks, Schuyler moves to the fax machine has come through, he picks up the sheaf of papers
was friends with your father, you bastard,  watched you grow up, and now you kick me in the balls-- Schuyler squints at the papers in his hand, flipping through them
, the entire transmission has been
The words all incomprehensibly, it looks like a child's scribbles
(
) That's not how you play the game
turns on him, a suspicion forming
You could've fucking told me
What game
Schuyler studies the   for a moment then puts them down, shaking off his apprehensions
Never mind
we'll just have to go with the earlier draft
In , one exec picks up a page,  to an , who moves out of the room
Schuyler moves to his briefcase
It's He starts patting his pockets
Can't find your keys
Baer has a malevolent expression
Schuyler looks at him
Where are they
Up your ass
couple of execs stifle chuckles
Schuyler's suspicions mount
Up my ass, very funny
His eyes drift to a piece of   on the table in front of him
He picks it up: -  -  we see a handscrawled note: "
"  We don't see what's written below
is reeling, paranoia confirmed
don't--
, you're with
Baer stares at him blankly
Schuyler puts a hand over his eyes, seems disoriented, trying to piece it all together
So the game, it's just a screen, to blow this deal
'm not following you
Like hell you aren't
How did you get my brother involved, that's unforgivable
The assembled execs are looking at Schuyler in utter confusion
As he speaks, the  returns with some
Schuyler stares at him menacingly
Hesitantly: Um
sorry to interrupt
We've been having some trouble with this fax, so they re-sent the material
It's all  now
The assistant comes over, cheerfully places the crucial documents in front of Schuyler
The assistant fishes in his pocket
Oh and Mr
Van Orton-- are these yours
The pilot found 'em on the floor of the chopper
Schuyler gingerly takes the  which the assistant holds out, looks from them to the paperwork
Then he glances back at the handwritten note on the table: :  It actually reads "

He rises, anxious to put the last few minutes behind him
Everything seems to be in order
Please disregard my last comments
The shareholders meeting is about to get underway
Shall we
He heads for the door
As he leaves, the execs exchange looks

His manner now has changed, he eyes every , especially the

Suddenly a leg is thrust out from behind an advertising kiosk, Schuyler  and goes sprawling
The Rasta Man steps out, now wearing  with
Shit mon sorry oughta pay more attention
Schuyler gets up, dusts himself off
As calmly as possible: Listen,  quit
Free at last
you won't be needin' this, then
He snatches up the briefcase, dances back a few paces
Schuyler speaks as if to a child
No, cretin
'm quitting the game
The rasta man keeps backing away, puts a hand to his ear
Wha's that, mon
didna hear you
Schuyler is pursuing the man, walking faster and faster
said -- shit
The rasta turns and , Schuyler bolts after him, unable to believe this is happening
They draw a lot of looks during the brief chase through the terminal, the suited businessman, garment bag flapping behind him, in pursuit of the crazy rasta
Help, help
The mon is crazy
He runs into a ' , Schuyler follows a moment later

'         - Schuyler has the rasta cornered now-- but he doesn't have the briefcase
Both are out of breath
look wary
Where is it
Got something better
The rasta men holds out a   on a chain
Schuyler narrows his eyes, he's trying not to lose control of his temper
realize you're just some bit player, but 'd like you to get a message to your employers
This bullshit is interfering with my work, it's breaking my concentration and  can't allow that to happen-- makes a sad face, , still dangling the key
If  take that stupid key, will you give me back my briefcase and go away
The rasta nods with a big grin
Schuyler steps forward, hand extended
The rasta flings open the door of a  beside him and hurls the key into the
Instinctively, Schuyler moves to grab it, reaches into the toilet, pulls out the chain, his hand and sleeve
The key is missing from the end of the chain
What the fuck am doing Don' worry, mon, it's a world a shit
He drops the rasta schtick, speaks with an Ivy League accent: So try looking at it through rose- colored glasses
here
He takes off his sunglasses, folds them and tucks them in the pocket of Schuyler's suit
Then he reaches above him and pulls down the briefcase, which was perched on top of the stall
Schuyler grabs it from him, raises his voice: told you, this is over
quit
They all say that at first
He gives Schuyler a hearty  on the back and strolls off, Schuyler leans against the wall, shaking his head
He puts down his luggage, pulls the sunglasses from his pocket
-- there's the image of a tiny   embossed on each of the arms
puts them on, looks around for a moment, catches a of himself in the mirror-- he looks silly
He quickly takes them off
As Schuyler heads out the door we see him from behind
the Rasta has slapped a colorful  that reads " " on his back

'   - and   as a  plays a   with a lot of body English
, stuck at a table right next to the machine, winces at the noise, checks his watch and rises
He makes his way through the lunch hour  to the bar, leans toward the bartender, a gravelly-voiced woman--
was supposed to meet someone here, a David Van Orton--  was wondering if he'd left a message
'Fraid not, sorry
He drums his fingers, then whips out a , spins around quickly as he starts to dial-- --and  into Christine the waitress as she emerges from the kitchen carrying a tray-- -- gets hit in the chest with a   , colorful ,  , etc
He stands there, stunned and
Fuck me
She starts picking up plates and silverware, oblivious to Schuyler's own plight; Ronnie charges out from behind the bar
After the first shock, Schuyler  with annoyance
He wipes the phone clean, pocketing it
Oh this is cute
Very cute
What happened here, you
It was an accident-- No it wasn't
Ronnie gives Christine a look as she starts wiping at Schuyler with a rag
He picks at his chest, examines the  , tastes it
Schuyler addresses the kneeling Christine: What's next, a giant banana peel
squints up at him, puzzled
Huh
Oh  get it-- you're nuts
Chrissy, just apologize
Dickhead here was on the phone , he walked right into me
Drop the act, you've been waiting all day for this moment
Shut the fuck up
Go home, you're fired
What
You heard me
Fuck you too
She  a plate on the ground, it shatters, then storms off into the kitchen
Schuyler  angrily, pushing through the slop on the floor with his shoe, looking for something
Let's get this over with
Where's the next key
Does she have it
Ronnie stares, uncomprehending
Schuyler goes after Christine
55
'            - He crosses past a short-order  in the grimy industrial kitchen, pulling a cube of  out of his lapel pocket
He finds Christine in an alcove with a couple of lockers, as she finishes changing into her street clothes
Her brown uniform hangs from a locker door, the nameplate "" prominent
as his fingers touch the  of -- they even look a bit brighter than the  and the

Asshole, just send me the goddamn dry-cleaning bill
Could you--
She waves a hand at him, "go away" and ducks out of view, finishing dressing into punk-grungy street clothes
She  the locker, starts to push past him, pulling on her backpack bag
Don't you have something for me
Uh-huh sure, here you go
She puts her hand into her side pocket, pulls it out with her middle finger extended, moving away from him in a hurry
Schuyler's face falls-- he made another mistake
Wait, you really work here-- Not anymore, thanks to you
She's out the  kitchen door
Schuyler absorbs his blunder for a moment, then hurries after her
56
'   - Schuyler catches up as Christine hurries toward a  station, a cigarette
few  come off the steps from the arriving elevated train in this residential  neighborhood
Slow down-- you don't understand, thought it was a gag
No, you don't understand
carry mace and  know how to use it
She reaches into her purse/backpack, Schuyler backs off
was only trying to apologize
Shit, it's in here somewhere-- Fine
He starts to move away, then they both hear
-- , a  , 60, in a coat and tie has collapsed, struggling for breath, very pale
Christine and Schuyler are the only pedestrians around now
Shit-- She rushes to help the guy, loosening his tie-- he
looks up at them dubiously, brushing a scrap of food still clinging to his suit
reaches in to clear the guy's throat, starting
She shoots a look at Schuyler
You got a fucking phone, call an ambulance
Schuyler approaches slowly, pulling out his phone, studying the guy as Christine gives him mouth-to-mouth
This is just too weird-- it can't be real-- You really are insane
leans close to look at the man
' -- sweating, contorted, unnaturally pale, his eyes rolling back as he  his last
grabs the phone away from Schuyler, dials
We need an ambulance, guy's having a heart attack near the  station at 5th and Market-- (to Schuyler) What's the number on this thing
don't give it out-- (off her horrified look) 731-5723-- 731-5723-- yeah, thanks-- She stuffs the phone in a pocket and pumps the man's chest, returns to the mouth-to-mouth
Schuyler looks around uncomfortably, starting to believe this is a real heart attack
Is there anything  can do
ignores him, all attention on saving this guy's life

as an  pulls up,
couple of hurry out with a stretcher

Both have small  that look like hearing aids, with wires into their clothes
Throughout the following, there's a lot of -- feeding the victim , giving him , etc

Schuyler, looking out the back, is extremely pissed, makes a fist and almost punches the wall of the ambulance
Chill, will you

Neither do , now siddown, get outta their way

Oh, this day keeps getting better

Schuyler pulls out his keyring and tries the gold  key-- nope

In the matchlight, we see Schuyler fumbling in his pockets, pulling out the   from the Rasta

She starts to pull him upward, but-- Where are the glasses
Fuck the glasses
We can't get out of here without them
He steels himself and rummages amidst the bugs, about to get sick, finally coming up with the glasses
He shakes them free of and clambers out to join Christine, who's  and brushing the bugs off of her

They're rubber

Fine, stay

Nice to meet you

It's a company called Consumer Recreation Services,

Well, who does
Until recently,  had a pretty good idea
Duck
The   has led them into a  , soon they're crawling on hands and knees
So are you like a serious masochist, or just really, really bored
'm sorry, you shouldn't have been dragged into this
Well
have to tell you something
Some guy came into Leo's yesterday, showed me your picture, offered me 250 bucks to spill that food on you
Ah
Said it was a practical joke figured what the hell,  can use the money--  got him up to 500
hated that fucking job anyway-- Wait, so the heart attack, you knew that was a joke too-- No
It scared the shit out of me-- But that  routine-- used to be a lifeguard

There's even a tiny bit of now
He takes off the glasses, gives them to her

How do we get up there

This is really sick

Maybe you can't play alone-- Who says  want to play

There's something in here  need
He climbs inside, dives in
and pops up again in a moment with-- --  -
Sure enough, there's a embossed on the side

What's that for

To a : What are you looking at
Schuyler heads straight for the  doors, the large numbers 636 printed above-- it's
He tries his little   on a deadbolt, it's  of course
This is their offices
We must have been in their garage

She looks good, clearly she put some effort into her make-up
Your turn
(moving past her) Find everything you need
You're outta conditioner
My apologies, 'll have it taken care of
Help yourself to the fridge
He points to a -, shuts the door, a moment later we hear She looks around the office, letting down her facade
She seems quite impressed, and intimidated, by the place
She looks back toward the bathroom door-- maybe this guy isn't so bad after all
From this point, she takes a more seductive tack

/      - , Schuyler has cleaned up, is finishing dressing, pulling a pair of jeans over boxer shorts, tucking in a sport shirt
Christine talks through the closed door
(
) So um
how rich are you anyway
(amused) Rich enough
Bit forward, aren't you
(
) Well, what exactly do you do
Manage investments, some venture capital, 'm on the board of a number of publicly traded companies
(
) So you just like, move money around

'           - Schuyler emerges, shoes in hand
Basically
Beats working, huh
Christine sits on his desk, with her bag slung over her shoulder, eating an
She slides off the desk, flirting rather bluntly
You don't look so bad, without the tie
Look,  hope you haven't been too put out
could probably get you another job,  have a stake in a couple of restaurants-- 'm not much of a waitress, really
'know, today's been kind of-- Can you type
Kind of a turn-on, you know
(getting no response) didn't mean-- just, the danger
Like fucking in a graveyard
Mm
So where do you live
Christine realizes her come-on is falling flat, she pulls back, tossing her unfinished apple in the trash
Out in Concord, with my folks, unfortunately
They're never gonna believe that 've been hanging out with a guy like you
What do you mean
Nothing, just-- most of the guys see have tats, y'know
(off his confused look) Tattoos
Of course
We'd better head downstairs, the limo's waiting
Christine nods disappointedly as Schuyler moves to the door
: 64
- Schuyler and Christine ride in silence in the back seat
Mind if  smoke in here
Yes
(leaning forward) Up here on the left
As the limo pulls over, he and Christine turn to each other
It's a somewhat awkward moment
So what's our next move
mean, in the game
Obviously we need to figure out what that crank thing is for-- 'm not playing anymore
(disappointed) Why not
have a life
Jack'll take you home, or wherever you want to go
Yeah, maybe 'll get in a little ballroom dancing before bed-- The limo has stopped now
Schuyler has started to open the door
Wait, what about your clothes
Forget it
'mon it's a brand new sweatshirt
So saying, she pulls it off
She's wearing a black bra
a is tattooed on her shoulder
Schuyler can't help but react
She thrusts the shirt at him, he's half out of the car
No, it's not-- just-- back from the cleaners
(throatily) You dry clean your sweatshirts
He nods slightly
as he reaches to take it-- -- leans forward, cups the back of his head and gives him a ,
, middle-aged and trustworthy, turns and catches a glimpse of this, quickly turns away
breaks the kiss, sinks back against the red leather seat, waiting for Schuyler to make the next move
See ya
Schuyler nods again, torn
She's looking at him expectantly
He's clearly aroused, but this is such an inappropriate female
Sadly, he waves a hand
Good night

'   - Schuyler shuts the door, sweatshirt in hand, the dome light slowly out on the crestfallen Christine-- we see her mouth a Schuyler moves toward his , the limo
He's about to get inside when he sees a     under the windshield wiper
He -- insult to injury-- tosses it on the dash as he climbs in
66
'        - He sits behind the wheel, watching the lights of the limo disappear
He sniffs the sweatshirt a moment, then  at the sound of a   across the street
-- an  the same year, model and color as Schuyler's-- pulls away from the curb, Schuyler gets a glimpse of something    in the window of the car-- a gun
camera with a long lens
The car makes a quick -turn and drives in the same direction as the limo
, curious,    as if to pursue
Then he glimpses the envelope on the dash out of the corner of his eye
He doesn't put the car in gear, picks up the envelope instead
-- The words " " are printed in on the outside
He opens it quickly-- there's no ticket inside, but he shakes out a -  in a clear wrapper and a  in  :  "

He hurries around to the passenger door and jumps in, looking haggard, scared, a man on the run

Jesus, David, you scared the shit out of me-- 'm sorry Sky, just drive, please-- pulls forward
Where were you today
almost didn't make it at all been in the bar for hours, waiting for you to come back to your car-- Jesus,  can't believe  did this to you, 'm so sorry-- Slow down, take a breath-- what are you talking about
The game
It just doesn't stop
thought 'd finished playing a long time ago,  paid the bill, then it started all over again, they won't leave me alone-- (slowly, evenly) Calm down
What are they doing to you
Everything
It just doesn't stop
Look
That's crazy
Yes, it's a pain in the ass, but why would they keep playing once you paid them
don't know
paid them  to make it stop, God help me  even gave you to them
but they won't leave me alone
He sees the crumpled note on the floor, picks it up-- What's this
It was on my windshield-- Oh shit, oh  they must be following us-- He cranks his neck around, looking for pursuers
Schuyler looks at him for a beat--
He almost loses control of the wheel

'        - David's losing it, looking around
They're shooting at us
David, get a grip, it's just a flat tire
He picks up the phone, punches buttons, gets nothing
Damn it, the phone's not working-- Of course not
(climbing out) Fine, 'll change the fucking thing myself
Just hurry-- 'll pop the trunk
David reaches for the glovebox
No, you can't do it from-- -- it   and
There are at least fifty of them jammed in there, all kinds, silver and gold
and all have  stamped on them
leans closer, intrigued
David's eyes go wide as he fingers a few of these keys
What the fuck are those-- (whirling on him) Like you don't know
Sonofabitch, they got to you first, didn't they
Um, David-- hello

- David gets out of the car in a hurry, amidst the greenery in the park
now
It's more than that isn't it
You're part of it, you're one of them
Of course, it makes perfect sense
They planted those keys
don't know what the hell they're for-- Schuyler tries hard to be rational, but David is over the edge
You're behind the whole thing aren't you
You and your sick fucking friends set it up-- What
What friends
Get a grip, David-- why would  do that
don't know, out of boredom, to get back at me-- For what
For being a weirdo, for trying to be happy
Well, congratulations, you win
Now make it stop
(grabbing him) can't
Listen to me-- Fuck you
David   in the face, Schuyler staggers back, clutches his nose
David runs, full tilt, into the woods near the Japanese Tea Garden
pursues amidst the trees and vegetation, running out of breath, calling after David, who's vanished
He leans against a tree, , dabbing at his bleeding nose with a from his pocket
He hears a  , moves toward it, emerging through bushes near the

He passes other  en route to the park exit

He moves faster, freaked
At the edge of the park, he snatches one up-- (on phone) What have you done to my brother, you bastards
This is over, 'm not playing anymore-- (beat) Hello, is anyone there-- If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and dial again-- if you need help-- slams the phone down

His back is turned as the girl climbs down, opens her raincoat-- only a   beneath
She could be a Playboy centerfold
Uh, no

He turns slowly, just as the girl reaches behind her
Sure  can't do something for you
She  as she lets her top drop
Schuyler smiles strangely
She takes this for lust, approaches him with open arms
He her by the hair
Menacingly: am finished playing
Let go
She pounds at him, tries to kick
He wrestles her to the floor, kneels on top of her
He seems about to hit her
This has got to fucking
You're hurting me
Who are you
just got hired to show you a good time
'mon please get off me
Schuyler gets his rage under control, horrified at himself
He climbs off her, she scrambles away, afraid, covering herself
am not into this kinda shit
Who hired you
don't know, the service set it up
The service
'know, Fantasy Girls
They said you had this wild fantasy, should just wait in the boat
Schuyler realizes he's not going to get anything more out of her, pulls on a shirt, grabs his wet clothes and leaves the cabin

The girl, pulling the raincoat on, leans over the deck

No sign of the boat or the girl
Divers got the cab's vehicle , the company junked it a month ago
Gallo, who'd been talking on a phone  , approaches
The numbers you gave us are disconnected, sir, this was the only address the phone company had
And we found your car-- it's in impound

You said your brother sent you to these people
It's not his fault, he's unstable, he didn't know what he was doing-- And they were supposed to show you a, a good time
(a cautioning look at Barnett) My guess is this Feingold guy's using an alias
is there anything else you can tell us about him
Schuyler spots an empty    crumpled in the corner

Mmm
it was

Of course, sir
It was a white house,  remember

with one of those, you know, tire swings
Jack, 'm serious

Kaminsky-- 109

Hi, Sky

Well, 'm gonna get back to that carburetor

She rolls her eyes, but mouths, "thanks," and then moves to sit beside Schuyler in the modest, over-knick-knacked living room:  religious pictures and statues, family photos, etc

Christine reaches across him to   a lamp
Last night, when Jack dropped you off-- did anything happen
No

thought-- eh, you don't wanna know
Come on-- thought they kidnapped you, tortured you-- What
Who
saw pictures, girl with a tattoo on her shoulder like yours-- (touches her shoulder) Ssh, my folks don't know about that yet
So, what-- they wanted ransom from you or something
No,  thought they were trying to frame me, they planted evidence
Why would they do that
have no idea, nothing they do makes any sense
Forget it, it's just a game
So that's the only reason you came out here to East Hell, your stupid goddamn game
was worried about you
wanted to see you again
(thinks for a beat) If you pretend to mean that, 'll pretend to believe it
Well, looks like your pals are trying to keep us together
Buy me dinner at least
Sure, why not
(rises) look like a slob, let me change
She hurries upstairs
Schuyler sighs, wondering what the hell he's doing here
He glances at a   statue, squints-- then unscrews the head, it's a decanter
He takes a sniff and puts it back with a bemused expression
He takes another sniff, noticing something else in the air
rises from the lamp Christine turned on
peers beneath the shade
On the table is a framed of a   who could be Christine in a frilly white dress, holding flowers

He   the tap, looks around for a towel, shaking his hand-- the paper towel dispenser has no roll on it
He pulls open a kitchen drawer-- -- completely empty
, curious now, opens a cabinet, absently drying his hand on his shirt-- also empty
He tries another couple of drawers, finds nothing but scraps of paper, matches
No utensils
He exits, a disturbing thought forming

:  Schuyler slips the picture from its cardboard mount-- it's an  clipped from a glossy magazine, printed on the portion previously unseen
quickly returns the clipping to its mount, puts the photo back on the table as Christine comes downstairs, dressed and made- up for a night on the town
Can you get us into Chez Panisse always wanted to eat there-- Schuyler nods casually toward the photo as she sits beside him
Is that you
(quick glance) Mm-hmm, First Communion
(touches his hair) What's the matter, you look a little green around the gills-- He grabs her hand away
Icily: Don't touch me
His tone alarms her-- he stares at her with hatred
silent between them, each tries to assess the new situation
She realizes he's onto her
She swallows, makes a quick decision
Suddenly she leans close to him, reaching around him to   the table lamp
She leaves her arms around him and  in his ear-- she drops her lower-class accent, speaks in a clipped, educated voice: Don't be stupid
Don't say anything, not here, they're watching
(sickened; to himself) God damn it
She kisses him, he doesn't open his mouth, neither shuts their eyes
Then she gets up quickly, moves to a corner of the room

She glances up quickly to indicate something on the ceiling-- , a large   with a  , a cable from it-- there's a small  in the center

No, enough already

Listen to me you bastard--  know what's going on

And please don't do that in here-- Second-hand smoke is the least of your problems
(blows it in his face) Shit, they really screwed up,  can't believe they didn't take the time to get the house right
Wait, how did-- before the game, you were working in that bar-- They planted me in advance, your brother set you up
Oh God, David's in on it
It's not his fault, he thought it was the only way out

How the hell did they think they were gonna get my money

Oh my God-- don't know what kind of jerk-off con games you've played in the past, but now you're in the big leagues, hon
You just helped sabotage a small portion of the national economy-- and destroy a whole lotta lives

Never drink it

Fisher,  know it's short notice but we were hoping your husband could come in for an audition today, he's perfect
looks annoyed at what he's hearing
Isn't there any way we can get in touch with him now
see
He makes a quick -, the tires
176-179 180
- Late afternoon
to find  buying a ticket and hurrying in
181
, Schuyler prowls the crowd with manic energy
' -- - gazing at the Feingold/Fisher, wearing casual clothes, eating a popsicle
He's doing his best to supervise   , two boys and an older girl
He's just another dad at the zoo, far from impressive-- the Wizard of Oz after the curtain's been pulled
When he makes eye contact with Schuyler, he pales, trying to herd the children together as Schuyler moves in on him
he can't get away
Schuyler grabs the man's shirt
Bill Fisher, hi
really admire your work
Oh please
got my kids here
Schuyler releases him, Feingold sheepishly avoids his eyes
Schuyler casually shows him the gun, the man's eyes widen
Get rid of them
(to the kids) Hey, everyone-- here's a twenty
Snack time
He dangles the bill over their heads, the  , leap like dolphins after fish
The girl's tallest, grabs the cash, they run for a nearby concession
Schuyler and Feingold stroll together
Look, buddy, it was just a job-- nothing personal, y'know
play my part, improvise a little, that's what 'm good at,  still do a little stand-up-- 've seen your resume
'm sick of foot soldiers, 've gotta get to whoever's in charge
Of
Christ, nobody knows, nobody gets the big picture-- (looking away) Jason, Tommy, cut it out
'     at the monkeys
They give their father a look and saunter along
's not interested in the zoo drama
Goddammit, why do they do that
How do  find them
Their offices were abandoned-- They own the whole building, they just move from floor to floor
Schuyler takes this in for a moment, thinking
They know you, you've worked for them
You're going to get me inside
(shaking his head) Uh-uh, 'm sorry and all, but-- Tell them anything, tell them the cops are after you, you've gotta talk to someone or you'll blow the whistle
No way, it's too dangerous
Schuyler cocks his head, steps in front of him
Right in his face: You don't seem to understand
Right here, right now-- 'm the danger
Feingold gets the message
: 182
- in the building
battered   rounds a corner,  before the ramp to the garage entrance-- the same garage he and Christine were once tormented in
183
- drives, looking very tense; a kiddie seat strapped next to him, junk galore; he's apparently alone
We're here, Sky
They said they're on the twelfth floor
-- Schuyler crouches under a blanket
Drive in, then
Look-- what are you gonna do
Really
Really--  don't know
Improvise
Go
183A
- The station wagon stops at the bottom of the ramp behind glass glares at Feingold, who waves timidly
The and the station wagon drives in
parks near an elevator bank; a handful of , a few white    and  parked nearby
Feingold climbs out, trying hard not to look scared and a beefy, frightening-looking   in a suit steps out
He looks around carefully as Feingold joins him
He takes Feingold's arm and pulls him toward the elevator
They wait
'  from the back seat-- just as the  , the Gate Guard steps up behind Feingold, puts a gun in his back
You're not authorized to be here
-- Schuyler glimpses a   , Feingold collapses
The Security Man grabs the body as it falls, starts dragging it out of sight while the Gate Guard puts a hand to his ear, talks into a mini-transmitter in his other hand
He follows the Security Man out of sight
The elevator doors remain open
With the guards out of sight, Schuyler rises slowly
He looks stunned and sickened as he lets himself out cautiously, sneaking behind vehicles
The main gate is sealed, he has no idea how long the guards will be gone
beckon
Schuyler crawls on his belly the last few yards, starts, finding-- , a   on its back
creeps military style, on hands and knees, the rest of the way to the elevator
He puts a hand in some of Feingold's , winces, then gets in the elevator
184
- presses the button for 12-- the top floor
-- nothing happens, the button  for an instant but again
The elevator won't move
's getting exasperated
-- he tries  allover, same story
Yo
-- the gate guard jogs  the elevators, pulling his gun
starts to panic, pulls his own gun and , who freezes and raises his hands
Behind him, the Security Man approaches Schuyler from a different angle, his gun out
Schuyler can't get a bead on both of them
You're a dead man
Schuyler looks one more time at the elevator panel-- , a gold keyhole
-- the letters  are printed beneath it, very small
shakes his head-- it couldn't be; but what else can he do
-- the guards are fanning out and getting closer
reaches with one hand for his keys, fumbling for the small gold key he received at the start of the game
-- his hand shakes as he tries to insert the gold key
it fits into the hole; he turns it and    for 12
-- as the  , both guards train their guns-- but too late
Schuyler's on his way up
184A
through completely blackened spaces
stares at a   in the back of the glass elevator, a remnant of Feingold's murder
He holds the gun in front of himself in both hands
then he closes his eyes, steeling himself, almost in an attitude of prayer
185
- but for the   ascending swiftly through the darkness
Schuyler, like a solitary spaceship pilot, looks upward toward his unknown destination
186
- The   slows as it comes to 10, 11 and  at 12
comes out of his trance, slips the revolver back into his jacket pocket, keeps a hand there, and stands against a wall of the elevator as the   -- 187
1 2                       - -- ,
Schuyler keeps the gun concealed as he steps out of the elevator-- nobody here is paying any attention to him anyway
There's a cafeteria style counter along one wall, people  and  at Formica tables
amongst others, everyone from his game appears to be here
there's the , the  with the   ,  and from the men's club, the  from the boat, the   and also the   , the   from his house, the  and the
and a lot of
inches into the room, meets the eyes of-- , who's just come away from the cafeteria counter with a tray of food
She nearly drops it, looks over her shoulder to see if anyone is watching
Suddenly, Schuyler is in front of her, backs her into an alcove-- she holds the tray between them as if to protect herself
What are you doing here
For a moment, Schuyler's not sure
His voice is flat, monotonal: 'm back from the dead
Listen, everything's , nobody touched your money, nobody stole a thing, that's impossible-- don't give a fuck about the money, wanna know who's behind this, who did this to me, how, why-- It's just a game
Even though she's keeping a surface cool, he notices the  and on her tray
She starts to move toward a table, he blocks her path
You're not going anywhere
Feingold, or or Fisher, was that just a game too
What are you talking about
watched him die
Schuyler shows her his -
Christine looks utterly perplexed, then shrugs, finding a place to put down her tray
Seemed like a nice guy, actually, father of three-- Well, look, 'm sure it's just another stunt-- that can't be real, taste it
You taste it, you fucking vampire
He pushes his palm in her face, she flinches, swipes him away, then puts a finger to her ear as-- and the guard and security man from downstairs burst into the commissary
Suddenly the  , many others are touching their ears
They all  in the direction of Schuyler and Christine
The gate guard gestures at Schuyler, attempting a smile
Could you come with us, please
You're not authorized to be here
Schuyler grabs Christine, wraps an arm around her throat, puts his to her neck
Back off
Everybody back off
He uses his knee in the small of her back to push her brutally toward the nearest door, she  and
188
- The door shuts behind them, the stairs only lead
Shit, how do we get out-- Christine  his foot and  his gut, breaks free and bolts up the stairs
Schuyler catches his breath and pursues
Beneath him, the stairwell door opens,
189
- surrounds the roof on all four sides, a at each side as well
The  "636" is painted large for helicopters; there are air conditioning vents, ducts, etc sounds as Christine bursts through the door, followed by Schuyler
She spins, her back to the  of the atrium, a black pit in the center of the roof with a sunken  , a white  around it
Schuyler  the door, a large number 1 painted on it in
He throws the
He and Christine circle each other warily, his gun trained on her
from the other side, that can't be heard
For the first time, Christine focuses on the gun in his hand, then clutches the railing
Wait a minute
What's that
Schuyler addresses her as if speaking to a child: It's my gun
We didn't give it to you
Where did it come from
gun store
We searched your house
Guess you fucked up again
Christine touches her ear, listening to something, then puts her hand to her mouth, speaks urgently
He's armed, he's got a real gun
Real Situation, real-- Schuyler steps forward and violently wrenches the   and away from Christine, the wire tears her blouse open
Yeah, it's real all right
Schuyler this is all fake , tricks, it's all part of the game-- Stop it
Every word out of your mouth is a lie-- Christine's desperately panicked, fumbling for words
The key
They, we gave you a key to the elevator
Why would we do that
We wanted you to come up-- Of course you did
So you could kill me or, or frame me for murder-- No, no, it's
Blanks, squibs, high-tech special effects, none of it's real
Just open that door and 'll show you
Schuyler hesitates a moment, looking in the direction of the door
open the door and  die
--  , but the   out the sounds of  on the other side
turns quickly as she takes a step towards him
He points the gun at her again
He looks ready to use it
The following overlaps and collides, growing  -- You move again  swear 'll kill you, you bitch
They followed you every step of the way, the cab, in the trunk, we had a diver-- They
We
--the guy in Honduras, the cop on the train, there was always a safety net, always-- Shut up, shut the fuck up
the metal door, which
He looks at the monitor in his hand, the one he tore from her body, putting it in his own ear, letting the rest of the device dangle
(filter) --just hang in there, keep talking him down, we're on our way-- We've been trying to end it since you got back, our people came to your house, they tried to bring you in from the subway, you kept running, you weren't supposed to keep getting lost-- You just said you wanted me to come here-- you're making this up as you go along
Please Sky, please
Take a breath and think about it
Stop
Fucking
With my head
Schuyler runs a hand over his sweating forehead, the gun in his hand
Christine's regaining control
Schuyler's mind whirls, he , almost crying as he considers for the first time that she might be telling the truth
She steps closer
You're all right, it's , just relax
(filter) Are you there
How's he doing
Please
when you open the door, the game ends
just open the door
Bill Fisher's out there, he's fine, nobody got hurt
Why would we do the crazy things we did, if it wasn't part of a game
We thought you knew that
He looks at her, almost ready to lower the gun
He raises his bloody hand to his lips, about to taste it
(filter) --we're at the North entrance, Number 2, just a few more seconds and we'll nail him-- Schuyler's eyes dart toward-- , on the other side of the atrium, like the one that's bolted
The number 2 is painted on it in
The handle starts to  just as-- --    to wrest the gun away
comes to his senses, struggling
The   , the report should be
He spins, points the gun at Door #2 and  again, several times
--
Christine , falls backwards onto the ground, clutching her - stomach
Schuyler just stares
Dark blood from her mouth as she  in pain
Oh God
blew it
we blew it
#2  and-- steps through
He wears a brightly colored, silly looking , carries a magnum of  bearing a huge  that reads, "
"    from
He , which
David collapses amidst the broken glass
the deadbolt and Door #1 flies open behind Schuyler
is the first of a group to come charging through, he wears a  with a  in the lapel, holds the axe
spins, points the gun at this axe-wielding man, then, utterly stunned, lowers it in disbelief
looks from Schuyler to the wounded Christine-- her agony is painful to watch
He drops the axe with a  and runs to her side, kneels
His voice
You shot her
No
(looking toward David) Qh God no
and   come out on the roof looking very disturbed, followed by the  and a few
Many are dressed for a party now
Feingold looks to their horrified faces
He fucking shot them
'll call an ambulance
The Rasta dashes downstairs
Schuyler backs away, drops the gun, staggers over to David
He's  for breath give the brothers a wide berth, move toward Feingold and Christine
David, David, no, no-- Oh God, Oh God, Sky, save me, don't wanna die,  don't wanna-- You're not gonna die
'm here, you're not gonna die
David's already , eyes wide, body limp
and
He holds his colorful cummerbund over her stomach to staunch the bleeding
She  in pain
Hang on, just hang on, you're gonna make it-- That stupid
They stare over at Schuyler, registering David's death
Schuyler is now drenched in his brother's blood, rocking him in his arms
Most of the assorted  people move to get out of the building before the cops show,  amongst themselves in fear
Oh God
thought you could handle it
All the tests
they said you could handle it
yells at Schuyler, unable to stand-- You fucking psycho, you piece of shit, how could you-- gently lowers his brother and rises, like a zombie now
The big security man picks up his gun and backs away with it, keeping it out of his reach
Schuyler backs away from the body, starts to , looks as if he really has lost his mind
Feingold  aloud
God, why-- there was no point
It was supposed to be fun
Schuyler looks back and forth from the wounded Christine-- who silent curses, beyond speech-- to David's body
He slowly turns to the Atrium pit directly in front of him
He's strangely calm
Fun
: moves for the edge of the atrium pit
react in ,  "
", lunging
'  suddenly , he
leaps onto the safety barrier around the atrium pit
jumps to her feet, perfectly alert, a hand extended, , just as-- , and-- ,
sees this, too late-- make terrified, helpless eye contact across the void, arms outstretched
Schuyler has time to register his irrevocable error as he seems to hang suspended above the glass skylight for an agonizing
190
- through the skylight, -- surround him like stars as he , ,
191
-- the , 's face,  and as ,  's head striking the landing
These so rapidly we can't quite process them
192
:   ,
'  as he experiences the epiphany that comes before the end
suddenly illuminates him, his eyes roll into his head, closing-- -- the  are real, they've   to show-- ' -- he  on his back, arms outstretched, eyes squeezed shut-- --and is swallowed by an     that covers the floor of the atrium
in the cushion a few times, gradually coming to a rest, harmless bits of   showering down around him
He doesn't move a muscle, his eyes still closed
muscles twitch
His eyes open
--  the now illuminated tunnel formed by the walls of the building around the atrium
in the very center through the hole in the glass
All the lighted     , packed with people
stares upward, mouth open, motionless
comes running from an elevator, leaps up onto the cushion and bounces over to Schuyler, a huge smile on his face
Hey, bro, how you doin'
Getting no response, David hops closer, squats by Schuyler's side
Admit it, you weren't bored
remains motionless, David's worried now, grabs his arm and starts shaking him
Jesus
Sky, c'mon Sky-- begins to , a tremendous catharsis
laughs too, greatly relieved as he helps Schuyler to his feet
clutch each other for support on the surface,
have gathered around the cushion, and
wipes his eyes, shaking his head with amazement
Then he hauls back and   in the jaw, sending him flying onto his back on the cushion
from the crowd, as if they were watching a boxing match
: 193
- from Handel's "Messiah" plays
and enter together from the atrium, the  deflates behind them
David licks blood from his lips, rubs his jaw
You've been wanting to do that for a long, long time, haven't you
Schuyler half-smiles
The   unlocks Schuyler's handcuffs, giving him back his gun, which Schuyler stares at
Like they'd really leave a loaded gun lying around
They went over the whole place with a metal detector, then packed that thing with blanks
They turn a corner into the main lobby, Schuyler absently pockets the gun, looks up in wonder
' -- a  :   ,  and , a  ,  and (mostly ordinary-looking office workers)  and  for Schuyler
They wear  , blow
eager to offer  surround him
He's pretty shaky, like a newborn calf
and  shake his hand
Good one, buddy, really had you going, didn't we
Wait'll you try level two
(a wink) Joke
The   his back, Schuyler instinctively looks over his shoulder for a gag message
That look on your face up there
Shit, man,  almost lost it
The   a bottle of Dom Perignon, hands it to Sky
Awesome game-- best 've seen
Not knowing what else to do, Schuyler takes a slug
The  from the boat  his cheek
, men with -, the  from the asylum, the  , , , all want a piece of him at once
The ""  and an  &   breaks into   as Feingold approaches and sticks a  in his mouth,  it
Sure glad you jumped, compadre
Otherwise  was supposed to throw you off
(whispering) It's not strictly legal, so don't tell anyone
(a beat, off Schuyler's look) The cigar
It's a Monte Cristo, straight from Havana
Christine approaches, wobbly and dazed herself; she touches his arm
Her voice is soft for the first time, accents gone
Hey
you all right
(nods slowly) think so
You
Little shook
'm pretty much a method actress, y'know
What's your name
Susan
Susan Waters
Nice to meet you, Susan
Can  have a puff
He gives her a  on his cigar
Look,  have to know
Who's really in charge
She shrugs, blows a   and sticks her finger through it
God
She winks and strolls off
Schuyler smiles, looking after her
is starting up
clutch of non- people approach tentatively-- including , ,  and
They all look very confused
What is this, Sky
We got a call from your brother, said there was a surprise party
Kind of late for your birthday, isn't it
Schuyler , gives her a hug, surprising her
He still has a giddy smile plastered on his face
If you wanted to borrow my car, you could've just asked-- know, Liz, 've been an idiot, and 'm sorry
You
Yeah-- 'm good, really
Happy to be alive
Listen, it's great to see all of you, thanks for coming-- but there's something  have to do
Excuse me
He moves away quickly
194-197 198()
'         - and moves away from a urinal
David waits a few feet away by the sinks and mirrors; Schuyler starts slightly
So what's the object of the game
(a beat) What game
Very good
(rinsing his hands) Is it always like this
Mine was a little weirder
Tell you about it sometime
David pulls out   , slips it into Schuyler's shirt
Schuyler looks at him curiously as he dries his hands
The bill
It's itemized
Don't bother opening it now
(opening it) thought it was a gift
Well, no, the card was the gift, the rest was up to you
as David hurries out of the rest room, Schuyler behind him, flipping pages of a long, long bill-- 199()
- --we rejoin the , which is now in full swing
Schuyler stands alone at the periphery of the dance floor with the bill
He hits the bottom line
he blinks and
appears, taking his hand and pulling him away
What
Where are we going
Does it matter
They move into a stairwell and start climbing
, their hands all over each other
We hear the  and  continuing in
for a beat on a  painted on the wall with an arrow upward:  " 2
