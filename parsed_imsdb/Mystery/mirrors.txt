Mirrors are the gates through which death comes and goes
Tell no one
" Orphee, Jean Cocteau 1                                                             1 1A
-                                1A subway screeches by at full speed revealing a station platform somewhere in Harlem
man runs for his life in the deserted space
He's an African American male in his forties wearing a security guard uniform
He turns into an empty corridor, climbs a set of stairs towards the exit, but- The gates are down and the station is closed
Desperate and out of breath, he is forced to trace his way back, searching for an exit or a place to hide
He sees a door to the public restroom and runs inside
1B
-                               1B The place is deserted as well
One of the mirrors is smashed while the others are covered by graffiti and dirt - The neon lights are flickering, bringing the place in and out of the dark
The man checks each stall one at a time
His face lights up as he looks inside the last one- He steps onto the toilet seat but the window is shut too tight
After a brief struggle, he swings it open, only to discover- wall of bricks
Panic returns to his eyes
He slowly opens the stall door, fearful of what could be waiting outside
is heard
He quickly shuts the door, holding his breath
Frozen
Silence
His heart racing, he exits the stall in the direction of the sound
The place is empty
The room is revealed by flashes of flickering neon lights
He moves closer to the sinks and the spiderweb cracked mirror
His image is fragmented and deformed
It resembles a Cubist portrait

wasn't trying to get away
He talks to his own reflection in the mirror- (') No, please don't
He approaches and starts crying like a child
His head resting against the mirror, he pleads for his life
Then, seeing the dirt and grime on the mirror, his behaving shifts to another extreme
He starts cleaning it frantically with his hands
Too frantically- piece of the spiderweb cracked mirror falls on the ground
Immediately, he bends down to pick it up but- , Looking up, the man realizes his reflection has become independent
separate being
Terrified, he slowly stands staring at his stationary double
The pointy and sharp piece of broken mirror in his hand reflects the neon lights just like a knife blade
His eyes turn cold with fear when- ,       , ,
Void of any facial expression, the man's reflection slices his jugular from end to end
In reality, the man chokes on his own blood which splatters on the mirror-

Ominous
The softness of the sun's rising light is contrasted with the eerie, haunting music

The blinking digital numbers of the alarm clock reflect off the wooden floor of the apartment
The sunlight is diffused through the drawn curtains of the living room
Seen in the reflection of the -set, a man is sleeping on the couch
He switches off the alarm and rises to go into the bathroom

The shower turns off

His eyes reflect the hardships of life
life, that from the lines on his face, we suspect hasn't been easy
On his chest and shoulder, Ben changes his razor blade and starts to shave his 3 day old stubble

Go back to sleep
'll call you,
Yeah,  won't be working until later tonight
He comes to kiss her on the forehead
She opens a sleepy eye and smiles
(') You shaved
She strokes his face gently
(') like it
It makes you look younger
Ben slips on his old military parka before leaving
(') Good luck
See you later, Angie

-                                       5 Ben walks down the hallway
The building is old and clearly not well maintained, cracks and graffiti cover the walls

Have you been waiting long

They shake hands
You look awful
Thanks Larry

Come in
Ben follows him into the office

- ''                                     9 Larry takes a seat and briefly looks over the messages and files that have been dropped off on his desk- So did you find an apartment yet
No, not yet
You need a place to stay
No, 'm staying at my sister's, in Queens
didn't know you had a sister
What does she do
She's a bartender
That's not too good for you
Anyway, you know you are always welcome to stay at our house
Larry looks up at Ben, slightly uneasy- () 6

How are things going between the two of you
Ben remains silent
He obviously doesn't want to get into that subject
(') So, why did you want to see me Ben
You know what  want
'm ready to come back, 'm feeling much better now
Listen Ben,  can't bring you back on the force
Nobody in the squad wants you around right now
'm sorry but have to be honest with you
You understand, right
Larry, 'm telling you, 'm ready
If it was up to me,  would bring you back tomorrow, but 'm not the only one who decides
Listen,  think 've got something else for you
know a guy at the Mayflower corporation and they need someone to watch over one of their department stores
What
Come on Larry, a security guard job
'm not ready to retire yet
Hey
'm just trying to help here know you're over qualified for that position but it's a good opportunity for you for the time being
until the situation here quiets down
Also the money is not that bad
Ben is having a hard time to contain his anger
(') You need the money, Ben
You're in the middle of a divorce and you've got child support to cover
If you want to see your kids, you've got to get a job, any job
Deep inside, Ben knows Larry's right

We are a world away from the Hollywood cliches of neatly laid out, immaculate cadavers
Here, some of the corpses have reached a state of advanced decomposition and others are still frozen in contorted positions, expressing their ultimate agony before dying
From the homeless man fished out of the river, to the woman killed by gun shots, each corpse tells his own story
Amidst the group of doctors 35-year-old , deeply immersed in an autopsy, is interrupted by her cell phone

You have reached Amy Carson
am not available to take your call
Please leave a message and  will get back to you as soon as  can
" Caught in the pouring rain, Ben has taken shelter under the scaffolding at a street corner
He plugs his ear with his finger to block the traffic and city commotion - (on Amy's voicemail) Amy, it's me
just wanted to let you know that  got a job today
It's nothing special, just a security guard job
If you still want to go ahead with it, we can sign the divorce papers
mean, if that's what you really want
(he hesitates) 've been thinking about Michael's birthday tomorrow
It would be nice if we could celebrate it together
You know, for the kids' sake
Call me
Please
Ben hangs up the phone
He lingers under the scaffolding for a moment, watching the falling rain

-                                              12 The glass skyscrapers mirror the black clouds in the sky above as they slowly break up, giving way to the sun
13
-                             13 On 38th Street, just off of Broadway, the Mayflower has withstood the passage of time and the huge fire that forced it to shut down- The damage from the fire is still noticeable on the facade of the building- The fire appears to have started on the ground floor and seems to have spread all the way up to the top
Some of the windows are shattered, while others are boarded up
What was once an impressive ornate building, a fine example of 1920's architecture standing on one of Manhattan's most dynamic streets, now gives off a feeling of devastation and desolation
What is left of it is a mere ruin, a sort of neglected ghost ship, abandoned in the heart of the city

14
-                                           14 The last beams of daylight shine through the broken windowpanes
Inside the department store, everything has remained the same since the fire, as if time stood still
The display cases, the departments, the mannequins, and even the clothes are all burnt or blackened by the fire
thick coat of soot covers the floor and rainwater drips down all over the place
(
) It's been five years and they're still in a legal battle with the insurance companies
Even cleaning up that mess is impossible
In his dark brown uniform, the daytime security guard, , 60's, seems pleased to guide Ben through what was once a temple of beauty and vanity
You know, the Meredith family acquired this building after St
John's Hospital closed in 1952
It was the very first Mayflower to open on the East Coast
On the cracked walls,   1920  that have survived the flames reflect merely the remnants of the past
The customers are long gone and have been replaced by pigeons flying in and out of the gaps in the roof
(') The company wants us to patrol the premises every couple of hours, but do my rounds every three hours and that's more than enough
Anyway, you'll see, there's not much going on
It's pretty calm around here
Ben follows Lorenzo through the burnt display counters
He listens but his mind has drifted elsewhere
This place makes him uncomfortable
It's not only the lingering smell of a fire, but also a sense of death that hangs over it
The whistling of the wind through the store's old ventilation system sounds like faraway voices
Ben and Lorenzo appear at the top of the staircase of the 2nd floor
(') Here you go
Men's department, or what's left of it anyway

14   :                                                      14 Ben observes the surroundings- Yet another spectacle of devastation
(') Thank God you didn't show up any later
This place gives me the chills at night
No electricity, and all these mirrors
You know,  live in Brooklyn near a Jewish neighborhood, and when someone dies, they cover all the mirrors in their house
Some say that it's just to renounce all vanity during the mourning period, but others say something else
They say it's to keep the soul of the dead from being trapped in the mirrors
Believe it or not, there's always a bit of truth in any superstition
Am  right
Amused and skeptical at the same time, Ben contemplates the mirrors that surround him- (') guess you just have to keep your eyes away from them
Unlike the rest of the scenery, Did you clean them
What
The mirrors, why are they so clean
Lorenzo smiles- That's Gary Lewis, the fellow who worked here before you
He was completely obsessed with these damn mirrors
He'd spend the entire night polishing them
Why did he leave
No idea
Just didn't show up one night
take it he's found a better opportunity somewhere else

Could never be bothered to say hello or at least ask "how are you doing

You, on the other hand, seem like a nice guy
How long has it been since you left the
Almost a year
Why did you resign from the force
You were a detective, is that correct
was wounded during a holdup
It kind of changed my perspective on things
Ben and Lorenzo reach the next floor
Third floor
Ladies' department
You gotta be careful here
When the wind blows, sometimes the tiles fly off the roof and they'll just snap your ear off, if you follow what 'm saying
Lorenzo checks the time on his watch
(') Well, 'll let you get acquainted with the rest of the store on your own
They turn around
(') Follow me, 'll show you our "headquarters" and 'll get you one of these uniforms

-  -                   15 It's almost night
Ben and Lorenzo have finished their visit and exit the department store
We were a pretty big team working here before the fire
When you stop to think that of all the department stores in New York, this one was the most beautiful, the most luxurious
It breaks your heart, it really does

(') Here you go
This is where you'll be spending most of your time
At least you've got electricity in here
It's nice and warm, and there's even a

-                                 16 Cartoons flicker on an old television set
All bundled up in a coat, and wearing a woolen hat, a young boy is watching
Lorenzo and Ben enter the mobile home- Lorenzo Junior, my grandson
Say hello Lorenzo
Hello
Lorenzo and  are going to the movies tonight
Lorenzo strokes his grandson on the head and proceeds to the back of the mobile home, leaving Ben alone with the child
The boy looks almost hypnotized by the images on
How old are you, Lorenzo

Lorenzo Jr
shifts his attention from the cartoons and stares Ben in the face- (') Do you work in the department store
do now
Grandpa says there are ghosts in the store
Is that true
Ben smiles
think your grandpa just wants to scare you a little

Lorenzo, put your coat on
We are already late
(to Ben, on the sly) There's a drop of Jack Daniel's in the cupboard
To keep yourself warm
Lorenzo hands over the keys- (') Well, Ben, the place is all yours
He's about to leave when- (') Oh
forgot the most important thing
the flashlights
You'll be needing one of these at night
We've got two of them
They run on batteries
Don't forget to charge them
See you in the morning, Ben
See you tomorrow
Lorenzo and Lorenzo Jr
exit the trailer
Through the window, Ben sees them walk out to the street
Ben inspects the trailer- scattered with knickknacks, the decoration of the place corresponds well with Lorenzo's personality - warmhearted and humble
The clock on the wall shows 7 p
m
long night lies ahead
Ben grabs a flashlight and turns it on
The beam of light is dazzling- : 17
-  -                            17 The flashlight sweeps across the dark entrance hall
Wearing the security guard's uniform marked with an embroidered "", Ben makes his first round of the store
The pigeons perched on the roof seem to observe him
Ben proceeds slowly up the stairs

The ever-present mirrors magnify the space to infinity

He examines the remains of the charred garments sagging on the hangers
The silhouettes of the burnt mannequins emerge in the gloom of the night

-                                           19A Wide exterior shot- By night, the department store's ornate facade takes on an entirely different appearance - more menacing, almost evil
19B
-                                           19B Ben continues his rounds
We follow his path through reflections in the mirrors- Then- For the first time, we discover another perspective, another It feels ominous, slightly detached
The sound is muted
Ben crosses back the third floor- The second floor
20                                                             20 21                                                             21 22                                                             22 15
23   -     -                                   23 In the reflection of one of the grand mirrors in the entrance hall, we see Ben come down the stairs
He stops for a moment, facing his reflection in the mirror
He fixes his collar and looks at himself in his new clothes- Not quite an  uniform
Suddenly, his eyes freeze
Intrigued, he comes closer to the mirror and leans forward- ,  ,
He touches it with the tip of his fingers and tries to rub it off, unsuccessfully
He picks up a rag from the ground, spits on the mirror, and rubs the mark fervently
The print remains
This confirms his hunch- By angling the flashlight, another handprint is revealed
Another
And yet another- , As he looks back up in the mirror he sees- Ben turns around
His gaze freezes- ,   ,
Ben swings his head back and forth, between the shut door in reality and the opened door in the mirror
What is happening
Is he dreaming or hallucinating
Ben walks backwards towards the basement door, keeping his eyes fixed on the mirror
As he goes to reach for the handle, he sees his reflection reaching for the handle of an invisible door
Ben opens it- Ben tries to reenact the phenomenon
He opens and closes the door over and over, while observing his reflection, but the mirror is no longer deceitful
The staircase leading to the basement vanishes into the dark
Ben hesitates

-    -            36 Ben walks down the stairs, step-by-step, lighting his way with a flashlight
The beam of light dims, the battery is almost dead
He gives it a few taps to make the light reappear
Last step- Fuck
few inches of water cover the basement floor
One of the water pipes must have burst due to the cold

Along a wall, Ben finds a fuse box and pushes some of the switches
Further down in the corridor, a couple of fluorescent lights flicker to life- two tiny sources deep inside the darkness

-                                          37 It's been snowing all day and a white coat of powder outlines the trees and houses
On the front lawn of their house, 5 year old  and 7 year old  are building a snowman
Why did they say on  that it wasn't supposed to snow today, but tomorrow instead
Why did they lie
Sometimes they make mistakes, Michael
It happens
Grown-ups don't make mistakes
Only little children do
Slightly annoyed, the little boy places the eyes on the snowman
Daisy's face lights up with a big smile when she catches sight of her father's car approaching- Daddy
Michael turns around and sees Ben exiting his 1986 Oldsmobile, with a big wrapped package in his arms
The children abandon their snowman and rush towards their father
Ben takes Michael into his arms- (pointing to the wrapped present) What is that

Is it for me
Maybe
(to his daughter) Daisy, has Michael been a good boy
Does he deserve his birthday present
Michael nods
No
Yesterday he finished the whole bag of candy when mom had told him he could only have one piece
Not true
Yes it's true
No, it's not true
She's lying Daddy
've been a very good boy,  promise
They enter the house
Is mom back
Not yet
Rosa came to pick us up from school today

-  -                                   38 In the kitchen, , the nanny, is rinsing the dishes from the afternoon snack- Hello Rosa
Hello Senor Carson
How are you
'm good, very good
What time will Amy be back
() 19
38   :                                                     38 Not before six, Sir
, 'll wait for her
Do you want me to fix you a snack
No, thank you
'll be fine
Ben takes off his coat and joins the kids in the living room
He hands over the present to his son
Daisy is sitting in the armchair, holding her cat, , in her arms
(') Happy birthday, Michael
What is it
Duh, open it stupid
Michael tears away the wrapping paper and discovers a remote control car
The little boy is on cloud nine
39   -     -                                     39 Through the front window, we see a Volvo station wagon park in front of the house
Amy gets out of the car, loaded with shopping bags
She enters the house and hands the groceries over to Rosa
Hi Rosa
Where are the kids
Upstairs
(in a low voice) With Senor Ben
The expression on Amy's face shifts
Noticeably irritated, she goes up to the second floor
Michael's remote control car drives at full speed down the hallway
Ben shows his children how to operate the remote control while the bathtub fills up
He seems as excited as the kids by the new toy
Ben turns around to find Amy watching them
() 20
39   :                                                     39 Hey Amy
Look Mommy, look what Daddy got me
It's great, you will have to show me how it works
It's so fast Mommy
Ben, can  talk to you, in private
Ben puts down the remote control- (to his kids) Ok kids, it's time for your bath
No fooling around
Ben follows Amy into the bedroom
She closes the door behind them
40
-                                40 Amy is not equally pleased to see him- She's beside herself with anger- What is this
already asked you not to drop by without calling, didn't
do, but you never take my calls
don't need your calls in the middle of the night
'm better off without them
haven't had a drink in three months but, then again, how would you know
don't want to know, Ben
don't want to hear about it
It's not my problem
You're not my problem
You've done more than enough harm already
You don't think people can change
() 21
40   :                                                      40 We are not talking about people, we're talking about you
How many times did you tell me you were gonna change and nothing happened
It only got worse
Ben moves closer to his ex-wife- Just give me another chance
She smiles- How many other chances did she already give him
Behind the firmness and intransigence she conveys, we sense Amy is torn
She still loves him as well
need more time, Ben
Listen,  will never stop you from seeing your children but we have to set up some rules
Out of nowhere, Ben hits the wall with his bare fist- '  ' , 41
-                               41 In the bathtub, Daisy and Michael cannot avoid overhearing their parents arguing
In denial, Michael blocks his ears with his hands and lies back under the water
42       -                                           42 Amy seems distrustful of Ben, scared of how close he is to the edge
We can see the anger in his eyes
Look at yourself
You're still carrying around so much of that anger
He catches a glimpse of his reflection in the mirror- and of the desperate violence in his eyes
Ben steps back
(trying to calm down) 'm sorry,  didn't mean to yell at you
Things could be so different between us
Yes  know, but it's up to you Ben
() 22
42   :                                                    42 Yeah
Anyway,  wasn't planning on staying
My shift starts in an hour
'll just kiss them goodbye and then 'm leaving
Ben exits the room
Amy is left alone- Through the window, she watches Ben exit the house and get into his car
When she turns away, she discovers Michael and Daisy standing outside the bathtub dripping wet in their towels
She smiles, and quickly comes to dry them
Mom
Yes, honey
Is Daddy coming back to live with us
She smiles gently
don't know sweetheart
don't know
43
-                           43 The beams from the flashlight are reflected in the few inches of water flooding the basement corridor
Since yesterday, the water level has continued to rise
The outline of Ben and Lorenzo's silhouettes appear in the staircase leading to the ground floor- haven't managed to find the source of the leak
My guess is it doesn't come from the store
It must be a municipal pipe that blew with the cold
'll call the company tomorrow morning and have them come take a look at it
44
-                               44 On the gas stove, a kettle is whistling

44   :                                                     44 Ben rummages through the cupboards and the drawers
He finds some instant coffee next to the bottle of Jack Daniels
He briefly hesitates between the coffee and the whisky
He grabs a cup and pours the boiling water into the instant coffee
In the reflection of the clock, we see Ben watching
It is past midnight
Ben gets up and grabs his flashlight- It's time for his rounds
45
-                               45 Through the shattered panes of the central dome, we see Ben walking through the store
Since the mysterious occurrences of the night before, his attitude has changed
He avoids, as much as possible, looking into the mirrors
He is on guard, fearing another supernatural manifestation
The shadows, the mannequins, and the shapes in the mirrors are all disturbing and unsettling
Even what remains of the sculptures on the top of the marble columns seems alive in the dark
As he crosses the entrance hall, a glint of light catches his attention
Despite himself, he stops and gazes into the mirror- , , How is this possible
Ben turns around to see the same spot in the real world-  '
Ben glances back at the reflection in the mirror- The vision of the past prevails
Unable to ignore it, Ben decides to check it out for himself
Ben wanders off towards the far end of the store, a landscape of dust and desolation
, ,       ""- We follow him in the mirror- Ben has left the night behind and enters the "daytime" department
Everything is in perfect order and unspoiled
Ben continues his journey into the past
() 24
45   :                                                       45 The customers jostle one another while shopping during a big sale
Children run wild in the aisles
Women fight over articles of clothing
Ben stops dead in his tracks when he notices, around his shoes, a transparent liquid spilling out on the floor- He bends down and dips his fingertips into the liquid-
Gallons of flowing gasoline gradually spreading over the floor of the department store
Ben turns around and sees, under the shelving, - The lighter falls to the floor in slow motion
The liquid bursts into flame instantly - , , Frightened, Ben steps back- The flames spread quickly to the escalators where the crowd has rushed to escape death- ,
In the midst of the flames through the heat waves, Ben spots the face of the firestarter-
Ben has no time to react
In a split second, his uniform catches fire
Panicked, he attempts to put out the fire with his hands- : , He comes back to reality- Ben catches his breath, trying to come to his senses
What's happening to him
What he just experienced certainly felt real
During his panic, the flashlight rolled under one of the counters
Ben bends down to pick it up
The beam illuminates the ground and throws light on an object a bit further away- () 25
45    : (2)                                                   45 He stretches out his hand to pick it up
The leather is worn-out but the absence of dust establishes that the wallet has landed there recently
Ben examines the object with the experienced touch of a professional accustomed to handling evidence
Between the collection of cards and scraps of paper, Ben finds a driver's license belonging to-  , 55 years old, a sturdily built African American man ,
The name rings a bell for him- 46
-                                 46 Ben returns to the trailer and rummages through the closet- He stops when he finds another uniform
name is embroidered on the shoulder- :  , ' , The wallet rests on the table and piques Ben's curiosity
He cannot hold back his police instincts
He finally empties out the contents on the table- Blockbuster card, restaurant receipts, a driver's license, Phillips' business card from Mayflower, cash and a sheet of paper folded in four- Ben unfolds the sheet of paper and sees, written in ink- Ben chews over these seven letters
Is it somebody's name place
code
Initials
He folds it up again and puts everything back, neatly, in the wallet that he stows away in one of the drawers
48                                                              48 48A
-                                           48A busy street under the subway overpass
We see a neighborhood bar on the corner- 49
-                                              49 At this time of day the place is deserted

49   :                                                    49 Sitting at the bar, Ben is nervous, tense
He removes the steeped tea bag from his cup
Ben stares at himself in the mirror, behind the bottle display shelves
It is not his mirror image that he is observing
His gaze seems to pierce through his own reflection, to dive beyond, into the very depths of his soul
Angela interrupts, across from him, behind the bar
She works here
(intrigued) What are you looking at
Nothing special
(playfully) Come on, you've been looking at yourself for more than half an hour
You never used to be so vain
You can't avoid them
They're everywhere
What are you talking about
The mirrors
In the department store, at every street corner, in the windows of every fucking building in this city
feel like 'm not the one looking into the mirrors, but rather they're looking at me
Angela smiles, not sure if he is serious- You need a drink
No, 'm serious
Don't you think you're being a little bit paranoid
Ben observes the palm of his hand
(') Mirrors are just glass and silver, Ben
() 27
49   : (2)                                                49 Angela smiles at him and continues to polish the drinking glasses

-                                 50 In the darkness, a rat glides peacefully on the water surface
In the basement, the water level continues to rise
With a flashlight in hand, and his feet submerged in the water, Ben moves deeper into the tunnel
He is searching for the source of the leak
The beam of light sweeps across the walls and the piping
Ben crosses an intersection
In the corner, on the tiled wall, he barely discerns an old inscription ingrained with decades of dust and dirt
He sinks his hand into the water and wipes it off, revealing an arrow pointing to,  ' He continues his exploration of the subterranean passageways
Suddenly, he notices a darker area on the wall
He comes closer and discovers a brownish damp-spot, covered with mold
The humidity has pearled into droplets
He has found the source of the leak
His hand brushes the wall, causing it to crumble instantly
Ben digs into the plaster as if it were butter, bringing a cracked water pipe to light
The leakage has damaged the wall in which the tubing was embedded
Ben hears the echoing sound of streaming water, as if there were another room on the other side of the wall
He pushes against the saturated wall, and pierces through it with his arm
He removes his arm
For a moment, he observes the gaping black hole that he has just left behind
Ben peeks through the hole with his flashlight, but he cannot make out what is on the other side
He makes the hole bigger, until the passage is large enough for him to crawl through- , - ,   , One of the mirrors is opened, ajar- It's a door
He enters
() 28
50   :                                                      50 His image is reflected in all directions and from infinite angles
Ben moves towards the center of the room- , It's a well-built man
He too is wearing the blue security guard's uniform
From where he stands, Ben can only see the back of the man's head
As he moves in closer, he can make out the name embroidered on the man's shoulder- '  ,
Gary
The silhouette remains still
(') Gary
Ben comes a bit closer
His gaze freezes when he realizes that Gary is not standing in front of the mirror with his face pressed against it, but- ,
Ben steps back, terrified
He doesn't know how to interpret this new phenomenon
Ben gathers his courage and returns in front of the mirror- Knock, knock, knock
He hits the mirror with his fist, as if it were merely a glass window behind which Gary Lewis was standing, on the other side- No reaction
Ben strikes the mirror harder
Knock, knock, knock
The former night watchman turns around slowly towards Ben, revealing his face little by little

Somebody is knocking at his door
Ben gets up from the couch- Coming
Ben opens the door to a  deliveryman holding out a package- Mr
Carson
(Ben nods) Would you mind signing here, please
Ben signs for it and takes the package
(') You have a nice day, Sir
Ben shuts the door and examines the  box
He's not used to getting many deliveries
He flips it over to see who it is from- Ben grabs a kitchen knife to open the parcel
He tears away the cardboard and empties out the contents onto the living room table- ,   ,
More or less recent, all the articles relate to the department store and the fire that burned it down
Gary has meticulously cut them out and sent them to Ben
But why
52
-                                            52 Ben's car parks in front of the fence that encloses the entrance to Mayflower
He runs into Lorenzo who exits the trailer, ready to go home from work- 've just been through the craziest day here
No kidding
Your ex- colleagues came to pay us a visit
What happened
() 30
52   :                                                      52 You know Gary, the guy who was working here before you, the cops found him dead in a subway station in Harlem never liked him too much, but poor guy, he didn't deserve to go like that
Did they mention the cause of death
No
they wouldn't tell me
Lorenzo hands him over the keys
(') Well, Ben
better get going, Mrs
Sapelli is waiting for me at home
Have a good night at work, Ben
Oh, and by the way, about that leak, they're sending someone over to work at it the beginning of next week
Have a good night, Lorenzo
Ben remains standing on the landing of the trailer for a moment, his gaze fixed at the department store- ,  ,  ,    , ' 53
- -                           53 - -
, The beam from the flashlight appears in the distance- Determined, Ben crosses the entrance hall in the direction of the basement door
He goes down- 54
-                                   54 Ben appears at the bottom of the stairs with his flashlight, and follows the subterranean passageway

54   :                                                       54 Suddenly he is struck by a frightening feeling of deja-vu, , - In the darkness, the rat glides peacefully on the water surface
He crosses an intersection and, once again- He recognizes the half-visible Psychiatric Department sign on the tiled wall
The beam from his flashlight sweeps across the walls and the piping, bringing to light, in the distance- -
(to himself) Damn
What is happening to me
The moisture has pearled into droplets
Slowly, his hand comes closer
The wall crumbles at the slightest touch
Pushed by curiosity, Ben begins to dig a hole in the plaster, just as he had done in his nightmare
He hears the echoing sound of streaming water, coming from the other side of the wall
It confirms the existence of a hidden room
Ben begins to dig frenetically in the saturated wall, creating a large enough opening to access the other side- He inspects the interior with his flashlight, revealing- , He enters
His image is reflected in all directions and multiplied into infinity
His dream was foreboding
Everything is perfectly identical to the nightmare, with the exception of Gary Lewis- The former watchman is not there but
,  ,   ' Sensing something wrong, Ben turns around
In the silence he faces his infinite reflections, all of them identical-
Taking a closer look Ben notices one of the duplicates' faces bearing an expression slightly different from the others' () 32
54    : (2)                                                 54 Knowing that it has been noticed by Ben, the "rebel duplicate" turns his face towards Ben, eyeing him with an evil gaze- We can hardly recognize Ben's image
The duplicate takes a step forward from the line of the other reflections and slowly walks towards Ben
Instinctively, Ben closes his eyes in an attempt to make the vision disappear
When he opens up his eyes again- - Ben steps back terrified
: 55
- '                                      55 Under the dazzling neon light of the  coroner's premises, Amy is in full swing submitting her conclusions on a homicide to the police inspectors in charge of the investigation
She is interrupted by somebody who enters the room- There is someone for her at the reception, who insists on seeing her urgently
Amy excuses herself, removes her examination gloves, and exits the autopsy room
We follow her down the corridors as she passes men in police uniforms and doctors in white coats, in the endless comings and goings between the police station and the hospital
The atmosphere here is highly charged, reflecting the excessive activity of this particular department
There is no doubt- we are in New York City
55A   '   -                            55A Amy comes to the reception desk
Ben, who clearly hasn't slept since the night before, is pacing back and forth
Are you
What's happening
What are you doing here
Amy,  need you to do me a favor

55A   :                                                   55A Listen,  am in the middle of work, don't really have time now
need your help
It won't take more than twenty minutes
Please, Amy
From his pocket, Ben takes out Gary's driver's license
He shows it to her- (') You picked up this guy yesterday morning
need to take a look at him
It's very important
Why do you want to see him
He used to work at the Mayflower as a night watchman, before  replaced him
Where did you get his driver's license
found his wallet in the department store
need to find out how he died
You are no longer a cop, Ben
This isn't your business anymore
He sent me a package before he died, with newspaper articles about the Mayflower
think he was trying to tell me something
don't know him
've never even met him, Amy
need to figure this out

young doctor escorts Ben and Amy down the corridors of the morgue
As he is walking, the doctor flips through the register, in search of a name

Gary Lewis
Oh, there he is, 58B
He slashed his throat
(to Ben) There you go
There's your answer
Your man committed suicide
You know a lot of people who cut their own throats
(interrupting) Well, all  know is that the cops are still investigating this one
That's why we still have the body
People can be very creative when it comes to suicide
'm sure it's not the craziest thing you've seen
The young doctor stops in front of the number 58B
He opens the door to the refrigerated compartment bay and pulls out the tray carrying the corpse, wrapped in a white sheet- (') Gary Lewis
He lifts the sheet, revealing Gary Lewis' upper body- Gary's eyes are rolled upwards and his throat is wide open
His skin has become translucent, almost purple
His contorted corpse is frozen in a deadly expression of profound suffering
His flesh has started to decompose and putrefy
Ben stares at the body, in search of a hint, a clue, any useful information
Amy becomes impatient
've got to get back to work, Ben
They're waiting for me upstairs
How
What did he slit his throat with
The doctor checks the report
With
with a piece of mirror
Ben looks up

56   : (2)                                                 56 (') He must have smashed it into pieces to have something to slash it with
The doctor, has a smirk on his face- (') Seven years of bad luck
Suddenly, reflected in the stainless-steel door of the compartment bay, Ben sees- ' ,      - Ben jumps out of his skin and backs away, terrified
Neither Amy nor the doctor saw anything, of course
They gaze at him with a puzzled look- Are you , Ben
What's going on
Ben looks at the corpse and its reflection again- Gary is frozen in the same contorted position, as if nothing ever happened
(coming to his senses) need to see his files
What
Ben raises his voice
Come on, Ben, what is it you're after
am not supposed to show you any file
You're not even allowed to be here
could get fired for this
The doctor senses that the conversation is taking on a more personal turn
Well, 'll be off
Amy, you know where to find me if you need me
Amy is left alone with Ben

Sitting behind Amy's desk, Ben is studying Gary Lewis' file
He flips back and forth through the different documents, photographs, and police reports
Amy observes him, perplexed
We sense that she is concerned about Ben's strange behavior and over sensitivity
Look at this picture
Come and see, Amy
He shows her a snapshot taken by the police
We see Gary soaked in his own blood, the throat slit open
The picture is real, crude
He lies outstretched, facing a mirror shattered into several pointy pieces, like a spider web
In his hand, Gary still holds the piece of glass that he used to cut himself
(') Look
What
Ben points to the reflection in the mirror- Look at the piece of mirror in his hand
In the reflection of the mirror it's covered in blood, and look- in reality, it's clean
Not a drop of blood
So what
Don't you find it strange that this mirror doesn't reflect an exact image of reality
() 37
57   :                                                     57 can't see the difference
It must be an effect of the angle from which the photograph was taken
What is it you are you trying to prove
What if the mirrors were showing us something different
What
For Christ's sake, listen to yourself, Ben
What are you talking about
What if the mirrors were reflecting something that goes beyond reality
(irritated) This is way over my head
don't have time for your barfly theories
Ben realizes that he will not succeed in convincing her
Not today
Thanks for your help
He's on his way out, when she holds him back- You should go home and get some rest
This guy probably just killed himself because he couldn't live with himself anymore
It happens to thousands of people, you know

-   -                            58 The steam has fogged up the mirror of the medicine cabinet
Ben grabs a towel and steps out of the shower
He watches his blurry reflection
With his finger, on the surface of the fogged mirror, he writes- He contemplates the dripping letters for a long moment, trying to interpret their meaning

Angela is standing behind him in the door opening- 'm off
Amy called me today, she's worried about you
What's happening, Ben
Please, not you
'm your sister, you can talk to me
Is it your new job
That place, the Mayflower, has bad vibes
It's getting under your skin
Just think about what told you
made a deal, Angie
can't just walk out on them like that
need this job,  need the money
'm not going to sleep on your couch for the rest of my life
You won't have any trouble finding another one
daytime job, a regular job
While she's talking, we see the scene from another point of view- from inside the mirror- As if Angela leaves the bathroom
Ben brushes his teeth
He leans over to rinse his mouth, and when he straightens up- , - Ben steps back and loses his balance, knocking down a shelf
Angela rushes into the bathroom- (') What happened Ben
Are you all right
He refuses her help

His reflection is back

Sorry to bother you
My name is Ben Carson
worked with Gary, at Mayflower
Could  come up and talk to you for a few minutes
Silence

Lewis

The entrance door of the building opens

'                                 60 is at least 80 years old, and almost blind behind her thick glasses
She lives alone in the small apartment that she used to share with her grandson
We sense that she is distraught by Gary's death
My Gary hadn't slept at home for three weeks
At first  figured he had found himself a girlfriend, so didn't worry much about it
It's terrible
The policeman told me that he was living in the streets
They found his body in the subway
Why
He had everything he needed here
Every morning  would have his breakfast ready when he'd come home from work
() 40
60   :                                                     60 Did he use any drugs
Gary
Huh-huh
Never
He was a good boy
Did you notice anything different, the days prior to his leaving the house, anything unusual in his behavior
Oh yes, but that goes way back to when he started working at Mayflower
What kind of changes
He didn't care much for anything anymore
Before, we'd sit up and watch television together
But once he started that job as a night watchman, he'd spend all his time-off locked up in his room
Sleeping
He hardly slept anymore
He was way too busy
Busy doing what
That,  don't know
never knew what he was up to
She reaches for a picture frame on the chest
(') Look, in this picture he was twelve years old
Is that you standing next to him
Yes, back in the days
Mrs
Lewis,  found a note that Gary wrote

Does that mean anything to you
Esseker, is that what you're saying
The old lady dwells on it for a moment- (') No, that don't mean a thing to me
She sets down the picture frame
May  see his room
Yes, of course
Come, follow me, it's down the hallway, the door at the very end
Ben follows Mrs
Lewis to her grandson's room- It looks nothing like the room of a fifty-year-old man, but rather like that of an old teenager
From what we can see, Gary grew up in here, and each object recalls a stage in his life
Everything is clean and in its proper place, it is perfectly tidy
Do you mind if  stay in here for a moment
Mrs
Lewis smiles at him
She too, likes to gather her thoughts in Gary's room
Ben scrutinizes the room in search of a clue, a hint that might help him on the Esseker lead
He opens the drawers and looks through the papers- Nothing is of any help to him
The only place left that he hasn't searched is the walk-in closet, whose half-open doors seem to invite him to enter
What Ben discovers inside is beyond anything he could ever have imagined- The closet has been emptied out completely, and , - It's a miniature replica of the hidden room that Ben discovered back in the basement of the department store
He would spend hours looking at himself
Mrs
Lewis steps up behind him- () 42
60    : (3)                                                60 (') To look at oneself too much is a sin
terrible sin
Do you know sir in the Garden of Eden in order to seduce Eve, Satan did not keep the appearance of a snake
Satan reproduced the young woman's traits in such a way that Eve would only see and listen to the image of herself
As in a mirror
61
-                                         61 Night has fallen
The department store is calm and silent
We move down each floor to the entrance hall
The basement door is open and, in the darkness, we see the gleam of the flashlight
Ben must be down there
,
There is a woman, somewhere in the store
Ben runs up to the entrance hall at full speed
The shrieks resound through the department store again
They seem to come from one of the floors above
Without hesitation, Ben dashes up the stairs- He arrives on the second floor and searches through all the departments
Impossible to tell where the cries originate from
He climbs up to the third floor
The beam of the flashlight sweeps past each nook and dark corner- Somewhere in the store, the woman continues to scream and wail to death
(shouting) No answer
Ben goes up to the fourth floor
The shrieks are heard again, but this time, coming from one of the floors below
Ben dashes for the Ladies' department- (') '
61A
- '                   61A The screams come closer
Ben passes the counters and enters the dressing rooms - or rather, what is left of them since the fire
The woman must be in here, hiding somewhere
() 43
61A   :                                                  61A 'm here Ma'am
Short of breath, Ben inspects the dressing rooms with his flashlight
The woman seems to have vanished
(') Ma'am
'm right he
,
He turns around- No one there
About to leave the dressing rooms, Ben catches sight of a mirror
In the reflection he sees the row of empty rooms- , Ben runs to it, but finds it empty , ,
Ben stops to think- If he can somehow move the mirror to have it face the last booth, he might be able to see what truly happened inside
Ben unhooks the mirror
It is way too heavy and bulky to carry
He lets it slide down the wall
Inch by inch, Ben hauls the mirror across the floor
He reaches the last dressing room- Through the reflection in the mirror, he examines the interior of the cubicle
In the dark he catches sight of The torn, half-burnt curtains conceal the rest of the body
With his eyes fixed on the mirror, Ben walks backward towards the dressing room
He is scared of what he is about to discover
He gives the curtain a quick yank, revealing- , ,

He walks towards the trailer, while keeping a fixed eye on the facade of the building
The scene he just witnessed in the dressing rooms has shaken him up
He goes inside
Through one of the windows we see him pick up the phone and dial a number- 65
-   /
-     65 Angela is in the bathroom when the phone starts ringing
She turns on the tap of the cast-iron bathtub and goes to answer
Hello
Ben
(
) Sorry 'm calling you this late
Were you sleeping
No, no,  just got home from work
What's wrong
You sound strange
On the phone, Ben struggles to put his feelings into words- (
) Don't worry, everything's

(
) Actually, no
think maybe 'm losing my mind
What happened
(
) You were right about the Mayflower
'll quit tomorrow
That's the smart thing to do, Ben
You deserve better than that
You should come back here and get some sleep
(
) No, 'll wait till the daytime guy gets here to tell him
Are you sure
(
) Yeah, sure
See you later, Angie
Be careful
Love you
Love you too, sis
She hangs up the receiver and stays in the dark for a moment, concerned
The sound of the pouring bath brings her back to reality
We follow her into the bathroom
She dips her fingers into the water to check the temperature
The bathtub is almost full
Angela undresses in front of the medicine cabinet mirror
When she turns around to climb into the hot bath, , Unaware, Angela soaks into her hot bath
The water continues to pour from the tap
Angela shuts her eyes- It's been a long day

In a sudden jerk, it pulls open its jaw- , ' , ,         , - ,   , The mirror cracks by itself
The bathtub overflows with red water spilling out on the white tiled bathroom floor
66
-     -                      66 The camera flashes illuminate the crime scene
Angela's body lies afloat in the bathtub
The apartment is entirely flooded
Two men in police uniforms close off a security zone, to keep the intrusive neighbors away
detective is interrogating an old Puerto Rican couple- the downstairs neighbors
They were the ones who alerted the police, after having noticed the water leakage
The old woman explains how "it was raining blood into her living room"
Amongst the police officers and the legal medical squad, we find Larry
He is in charge of the case
Leaning over the bathtub, Larry examines the visible parts of the corpse
Angela's face is concealed by her own long black hair, floating in the murky water
Larry slips on an examination glove, pulls up his sleeve and sinks his arm into the blood-red bath
He feels around for the chain of the plug in order to drain the bathtub
The water level begins to recede, gradually revealing Angela's naked corpse
With the tip of his fingers, Larry lifts away the few strands of hair covering Angela's face- () 48

Larry removes his glove, wipes off his bloodied arm and starts to leave the bathroom when something else catches his attention- He comes closer to the spiderweb cracked medicine cabinet mirror
is dripping from one of the cracks
Strange
He turns immediately- The bloodied bathroom is still and silent
Angela's destroyed body lies in the empty bathtub
police inspector in the next room, calls out to him- Larry
Take a look at this
What is it
Come take a look for yourself
Larry exits the bathroom
The police inspector in the living room holds a picture frame in his hands
He turns towards Larry- Look
Isn't Ben Carson in the picture
: 67
-   -                      67 Still wearing his uniform, Ben is sitting alone in one of the interrogation rooms of the police station
His haggard face expresses great grief
His sister's death has left him distraught
He fiddles with an empty plastic cup in his hands
The classic two-way mirror facing him, throws back his reflection
Ben knows that he is being watched
Behind the two-way mirror, Amy observes him
Larry is standing next to her
The water has obliterated most of the marks
No trace of struggle or broken entry, the entrance door was locked

67   :                                                     67 (') The person who did this must have had the keys to her apartment, or otherwise it was somebody she knew
He would never have laid a finger on her
When their father died, Ben took care of his sister
Angela meant the world to him
Listen, so far, his statement is pretty consistent with the facts
We checked it out, he did place a call from work at 12:30, and the woman's downstairs neighbors claim they started noticing the water leakage at around two in the morning
The daytime security guard, Lorenzo Sappeli, confirms he came on after Ben's shift at seven a
m
The only strange thing, and it may just be a coincidence, is that Ben told Sappeli that he had decided to quit his job, as if he was planning to go away somewhere
Did he mention anything about it to you
No, lately, communication hasn't quite been our strong point
(she smiles) only found out yesterday that he was staying at his sister's
What are you going to do with him
figure we'll let him go
At this point we haven't got any real reason to keep him here
And,  think he's had his share for the day
You know what's gonna happen if you let him go
He won't stop here
know him, he won't stop until he finds who did this to her
Listen, where we stand now, we got nothing, not a single clue
'm sure he can help us
What kind of friend are you
You are using him
He's not a cop anymore

Amy comes closer to the two-way mirror
She looks at her ex- husband on the other side
He seems overcome with grief and confusion
She can see the distress in his eyes
(') Try to keep an eye on him
: 68
-                                           68 Ben has been released
Under the pouring rain, on the front steps of the police station, Amy tries to reason with him- You have to see someone Ben
You cannot stay in this situation any longer
You need help, psychological support
Ben is not listening
His mind is elsewhere
(') Why don't you
if you want
come spend a few days at home, with the kids
No,  don't want to put them in any danger
What do you mean
've got things  need to deal with
Ben, look at me
don't want you to get into any trouble
Think about Daisy and Michael
You are not going to solve this case
Please, stay out of it
She asked me to quit and they got to her
What
Who are you talking about

In that case, you have to tell them everything
They wouldn't believe me and neither would you
Goodbye
Ben walks away, leaving Amy alone on the steps of the police station Ben, wait
Ben does not turn around
The rain is beating down harder and the thunder grumbles in the distance
The first lightning flashes light up the sky
Another flash- 68A   -   -                                            68A Ben ignores the crime scene's restriction perimeter and enters Angela's apartment
Without turning on the light, he goes straight for a leather pouch stashed among his cardboard boxes
Inside-
357 , his former cop weapon
Another flash- 69
-                                           69 The lightning bolts illuminate the facade of the department store

-                                           70 The rainwater pours through the openings in the roof, penetrating the interior of the deserted department store
It dribbles down the cracked walls and over the half-burnt mannequins
71
-  -                      71 We hear the echo of the roaring thunder outside, but in the gloom of the flooded basement, there is another blaring sound- () 52
71   :                                                     71 It gets louder and louder, closer and closer as we advance towards the opening to the mirror room- Inside, we find Ben, out of his mind, throwing a chair against the mirrors with all his strength, in an attempt to demolish them- He's exhausted and he's forced to stop
Not a single shard of glass, not even a scratch, the mirrors seem completely indestructible
Ben is not through with them
He drops the chair to the ground and pulls out the gun from his belt
Without a moment's hesitation he opens fire- , In the spiderweb-cracked mirror, his image is deformed
Having found a weak spot, Ben savors his sweet victory when, suddenly, something inconceivable unfolds before his very eyes- Ben's shock and disbelief give way to rage
He fires, in a fury, emptying the entire clip this time- Again, the bullet holes vanish, leaving Ben alone, face to face with his own reflection
He breaks down nervously- Why did you do it Silence
(') What is it you want
What do you want from me Suddenly, one after the other, letters, start appearing in one of the mirrors, as if an invisible finger were tracing them in the dust- Ben turns around, and in the reflection of the opposite mirror he recognizes the inverted word- the same word he found on the note in Gary's wallet, the word Ben himself had traced in his bathroom mirror- () 53
71   : (2)                                                     71 : 72
-                                        72 Back in the Queens apartment, Ben still hasn't gotten any sleep
On the wall, he is assembling all the newspaper clippings, articles and photographs that Gary sent him
Each and every mirror in Angela's apartment has been covered with sheets, blankets, old rags- anything he could find to neutralize the reflective surfaces
With the phone cradled between his ear and shoulder he is in the middle of a heated conversation- Look up Esseker
Yes, Echo, Sierra, Sierra, Echo, Kilo, Echo, Romeo
Esseker
No idea, my guess is that it's a name
No,  haven't got a first name
Yes, in New York
Over the past five or six years
know it's hazy but that's all 've got
already looked it up in the phone book
also called someone at the  and at the , but nothing there
It's very important Larry
You'll call me back
Ok
Ben hangs up the phone and remains in front of the wall covered with clippings for a moment
Now he can have a clear overview of Gary's investigative research
All the articles date back approximately to the same period and are all related to the fire that ravaged Mayflower five years ago
But not a hint of Esseker
Ben studies the newspaper clippings, trying to piece the story together- " Deadly Fire at Mayflower- 29 dead and 78 wounded " "   Brutal Massacre- Mother and her three daughters slaughtered
" "
the children, drowned, in the bathtub
" "
the throat slit open
" " Mayflower's security guard taken in for questioning
" () 54
72   :                                                     72 " The night watchman confesses to setting the fire but firmly denies the accusation of murdering his family
" " Terrence Berry confesses but claims the mirrors are guilty- The security guard at Mayflower finally confesses
He started the fire in the department store with the intention of destroying the mirrors, responsible, according to him, for the death of his wife and three daughters
" Ben observes Terrence Berry's face in one of the archive photographs
He looks like a perfectly normal guy, rather kind, surely he was a good father
Ben can't help but empathize with him
As he looks up, Ben catches a glimpse of his reflection in the window- What if he too lost his mind and went on to slaughter his family
Or what if the mirrors would do it
The phone rings- (') Yes, so, what'd you find out
Nothing under that name
Shit, shit, shit, shit
Can you look up Berry, Terrence Berry
Ben holds on the line, for a moment
(') Got anything
Great
No,  already know all that
Is he still alive
No
Can you find out where he was committed before his death
Wait, 'm writing it down
Ben sits down on the bed and scribbles down the address on a piece of paper
(') Roosevelt Psychiatric Detention Center
Yeah,  know where it is
Thanks
He hangs up the phone
Under the blanket, next to him, he spots the -shirt that his sister was wearing the other night
The pain is too strong
He cannot hold back his tears anymore and starts crying

The hot chocolate set in front of him is getting cold
His sister Daisy pours herself some more orange juice
Amy, shaking a box of cereal, interrupts the little boy in his dream state- Do you want the cereal in your hot chocolate or in a separate bowl
The little boy does not answer
(') Michael
In the chocolate
In the chocolate, please, mom
(repeating after her) Please, mom
She pours the cereal in his hot chocolate
Yuck, that's gross, how can you eat that
Come on, come on, let's get going, or you're going to be late for school
Michael begins to eat his breakfast, his gaze still fixed on the weatherman's forecast on
As Amy fills the cat's bowl with pellets, Tiger rushes over to join the rest of the family
Mom
What is it sweetheart
Do you know that Michael has a new friend

Really, what's his name
(to his sister) You promised not to tell
Does he go to your school
Michael doesn't answer
Daisy shakes her head
(') (pretending to be indifferent) Very well
If you don't want to tell me about it
The little boy stays quiet
He doesn't want me to talk about him
Amy suddenly becomes more concerned and sits down next to Michael- Why doesn't he want you to talk about him
Is he a grown up
No
So, he's a little boy your age, then
Michael gives a reluctant nod
Amy is reassured
He finishes his mug of cereal and goes to place it in the sink
Amy gives Daisy a questioning look- (') (to Michael) Does he live in our street
Is it one of our neighbors
Michael remains silent and Daisy answers for him- He lives in the mirror in our room
Daisy bursts out laughing
Michael glares back at her, furious
Puzzled, Amy reflects briefly on Daisy's remark- () 57

Michael remains silent
(') Michael, answer me
Did your father talk to you about the mirrors
No Mommy
Amy questions him with her eyes
Michael lowers his
Come on, come on guys, let's get our teeth brushed, and our coats on
The first one in the car is the winner
The two kids dash up the stairs
Amy is left alone to clean up breakfast
She casts a glance at the front hall mirror
Daisy's comment lingers in her thoughts
Dressed in their coats, Michael and Daisy come running down the stairs and rush out of the house
Amy exits the house
The car drives away
Daisy's cat leaps onto the kitchen table and directs his gaze to the mirror- , : 74

) You know, Mr
Carson, when one starts to perceive one's own reflection as a completely separate being, one is suddenly confronted with two entirely separate egos, two entirely separate worlds that can surface at any given moment- 58
75
-                  75 , the doctor who had once been in charge of Terrence Berry, escorts Ben down the corridor- feeling of self-hatred, generally triggered by a psychological shock can split the personality in two, hence creating two or more personalities with distinct memories or behavior patterns within the same individual
The patient then has a faulty perception of the existence of two distinct worlds, which are principally the "real" word, and the world "inside the mirror"
The two men pass a number of guards and security check-points as they head down towards the hospital's film and video archive- Did you consider Terrence innocent
Dr
Morris swipes his magnetic card through the electronic device, unlocking the door to the archives
In my opinion, he was convinced that he was telling the truth when he claimed he didn't kill his family too am convinced that when it happened, Terrence was not himself, but rather his double, his mirror image, one might say
He enters the archives, followed by Ben- 76
- -        76 Dr
Morris' finger glides across several -tapes dated 2001 in search of one particular tape- These recordings are from Terrence's trial
You will find that they speak for themselves

He keeps his face down, never looking into the camera
, ' ,
(') Why did you set the department store on fire
In order to
to destroy the mirrors
Only fire can destroy a mirror, isn't that right, Doctor
What made you think you absolutely had to destroy those mirrors, Terrence
Terrence remains silent
Dr
Morris repeats his question- (') What made you want to destroy those mirrors, Terrence
They killed Helen and my three little girls
For what reason
Why would mirrors want to kill your family
Because  didn't
Terrence breaks out in tears
Didn't do what
With his eyes fixed on the video monitor, deep inside, Ben already knows the answer that Terrence is about to give
They asked me to find Esseker
Like they did with the others
Who are the others you're talking about
wasn't the first one they asked

didn't succeed

Ben realizes that he's in the exact same situation- Amy
(to Dr
Morris) have to go
He stands to leave
The monitor keeps playing the old footage- Tell me about Esseker, Terrence
Terrence doesn't speak
(') Who is Esseker, Terrence
Suddenly, Terrence's behavior shifts to another extreme
He stands up, and flying into a rage, he becomes brutal and hysterical- '
' ,  '
Terrence becomes uncontrollable
He wrecks the folders lying on the desk and throws himself, head first, against a wall mirror that shatters to pieces

After seeing the video footage on Terrence, he has been struck with fear and panic for his family- Before the perplexed gaze of Rosa and his children, Ben agitatedly comes and goes in the hallway of the second floor
He is removing the mirrors from each and every room
He tears away the bathroom mirror, unhooks the one in the far end of the hallway, and removes some from Amy's room

78   :                                                      78 Rosa fears more and more for the children and takes them under her protective arms
Amy is not back yet
The only mirror left that Ben cannot remove, is the one in the children's room
He rushes down to the basement and comes back with a bucket of old paint
He immediately begins to paint the wall mirror in order to neutralize its reflection
What are you doing dad
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong
Everything is
But why are you doing that
'm doing it to protect you
79
-                           79 At the same time, Amy's car pulls up in front of the house
As soon as she sees the front door open, and the mirrors laid out on the landing of the front steps, Amy rushes into the house, panic-stricken
80
-   -                          80 She races up the stairs to the second floor, barging into the children's room where Ben is painting the mirror
She signals Rosa to take the kids out
Do you mind telling me what the hell you're doing
Focused and determined, Ben does not answer her question
(') Ben
Look Amy, you've got to trust me, know what 'm doing
It's for your own good
want you to stop what you're doing and get out of our house right now
() () 62
80   :                                                     80 (') You're scaring the kids acting like this
Ben continues to paint the mirror
(') If you don't leave immediately, 'm going to call the police, Ben, and warn you, you will never see your children again
Do you understand what 'm saying
Ben stops- You have to trust me Amy, 'm not completely crazy
These mirrors are dangerous
At first,  thought it was only the ones at the store, but now know they can get you anywhere
They got Angela
promise 'll leave the house once 've taken them all down
Do you realize what you're saying, Ben
What is wrong with you
know that what you're going through isn't easy
Angela was a part of our lives too, but you have no right to do this to us
Ever since your obsession with these damn mirrors the kids are scared to death
Your son has nightmares
He's scared Ben
Your behavior is starting to rub off on him
He's only 5 years old
And  have to protect him
Ben can see that she is very upset about the situation
He sets down the paint bucket on the floor- Come Amy, come with me,  want to show you something
He leads her back down, through the first floor, and out on the front steps of the house- 81
-   -                         81 Look, you'll see
Ben pulls his Magnum out of his belt and points the gun at one of the mirrors he has dragged outside
Amy steps back, terrified- () 63
81   :                                                     81 What are you doing with that gun
Put it down,
Without a moment's hesitation, Ben opens fire
The mirror shatters to pieces- (') Ben smiles, all excited- Wait, look, you'll see
Through the front window, Daisy and Michael witness the scene- , Ben keeps a piercing gaze as the bullet impacts the mirror, waiting for the magic to do its trick and for the cracks to dissolve again- ,
Behind the front door, Ben notices Michael, watching him, in tears
Without any evidence, Ben is in over his head
But
swear to you
saw
Amy
The neighbors, alerted by the blast of the gun, come out of their houses to find out what has happened
Ben stands alone, looking like a mad man
Amy holds back her tears and tries to stay in control- Get out
now
don't ever want to see you here again, Ben
And 'll have the lawyers make sure the same goes for the kids
You are insane, Ben, and dangerous
You've got to get help
With gun in hand, Ben walks away, dismayed, as he gradually becomes aware of the situation he has just created
He enters his car and drives off at top speed

-  - '                                   82 Ben drives nervously
He feels guilty about his conduct in front of the children
thousand thoughts rush through his head, leaving him in an utter state of confusion
He doesn't know what to do nor what to think anymore
Ben reaches for his cell phone and dials Larry's number- Hello, Larry
It's me
'm going to need your help again- (
) Come on, Ben
For Christ's sake
What are you doing
Mayflower used to be a hospital before it became a department store
St
John's Hospital
Do you have any idea where all the medical records could have ended up after it closed down
(
) How am  supposed to know that
Go to the city hall archives
They must have something considering it was a public hospital
(
) 've got others things to do
can't go to City Hall today
've - Larry, Larry stop it
If  could go myself,  wouldn't be asking you
Go to the City Hall archives, and ask them to look up Esseker among the former patients
Please
(
) Ben, for god's sake, what are you trying to prove
Please, do it for me
(
) You know you're a real pain in the ass
() 65
82   :                                                      82 Talk to you later
Ben hangs up
He glances back at the rear view mirror and sees ' ,
Startled, he loses control of the vehicle
truck approaches at full speed in the opposite lane
He barely avoids the collision
Two other cars appear
Ben zigzags in and out, just barely avoiding a fatal crash
He stops along the edge of the road
Ben closes his eyes and rests his head against the steering wheel in an attempt to clear his mind
He looks up into the rear- view mirror again- '
Behind her long black hair, she fixes him with a milky gaze
Ben flies into a rage
- ,
Ben is alone and lost
(') What have  done
don't understand
What have  done
Insert on what is written on the side rear-view mirror- "       " 83
-  -                 83 Under the pouring rain, the police patrol cars come and go in front of the police station
bit further away we recognize Ben's Oldsmobile, parked on an adjacent street
Ben is waiting inside
man approaches, knocks on the car window and enters the vehicle
It's - The rainwater drips down his raincoat
Under his arm he holds a file of documents, wrapped in a plastic bag
This ought to make you happy
(handing him the file) Anna Esseker
() 66
83   :                                                     83 Ben nervously tears open the plastic wrapping- (') wasn't quite sure what you needed, so  got all of her medical records
Perfect, Larry
That's perfect
Ben skims through the pages
He cannot believe that he has finally discovered who Esseker is
Everyone's real edgy up there
You're still a fuckin' murder suspect
People are wondering why  let you out
You have to tell me more
What does the history of the Mayflower have to do with the death of your sister
don't know exactly
can't tell you, but some really fucked up things started happening to me when  took the job over there
Nothing makes any sense to me either but  have to follow my instinct
Larry notices the broken rear-view mirror- What happened
Did you have an accident
Ben is too absorbed in the records
He doesn't answer
Anna Esseker
Where did you find her files
Did you go to City Hall
No, you were wrong about that, they had nothing
All the medical records from St
John's Hospital are still up there with the unclassified cases
Ben squints at him
(') She was a patient at St
John's in the psych ward run by a Dr
Kane, between March and September 1952
She was only twelve years old when she died
Ben freezes- () 67
83   : (2)                                                 83 What
When the nurses went on their rounds, first thing on the morning of October 6th, they discovered that all the patients had left their rooms during the night and gathered in the main room
All of them were dead, including the girl
Apparently, they had killed one another
slaughter house
After that they shut down the place
Nobody ever found out what really happened
What about the doctor
Dr
Kane
He was arrested
They found him dead on the first day of his hearing
He had slit his wrists with a piece of his cell mirror

-  -                        84 Ben heads home with the file containing Anna's medical records
He walks through the lobby of his building

-                                      86 Angela's apartment is plunged in total darkness- Ben lays Anna Esseker's file on the coffee table and aims the desk lamp at his "research corner" on the wall
He turns the lamp back at the file and sits down to study it
'
'
On an index card filled in by Anna's parents in September 1952, Ben finds a Pennsylvania home address
Dr
Kane's first diagnosis is irrevocable - "Despite her young age, Anna Esseker suffers from severe schizophrenia, leading to withdrawal from reality, delusional and violent behavior
" () 68
86   :                                                       86 He shuffles through the first few pages of various administrative documents
His eye lands on several photographs of Anna taken at the time she was admitted to the hospital- She is just a child, yet, six male nurses were needed to restrain and immobilize her in front of the photographer
Her face is hardly discernible as she struggles like a wild animal
high-pitched sound of cracking glass is heard from behind
Ben turns around- Another loud crack - It comes from one of the covered mirrors in the apartment
Ben rises slowly to his feet and comes closer
He removes the sheet hanging on the frame- crack has appeared in the upper corner of the mirror
Ben casts his eyes over the reflection
His glance comes to rest on Anna's file laying on the desk- He goes to fetch the photograph of the little girl and presents it to the mirror- - the crack in the mirror spreads, as if some kind of pressure were applied on the other side of the mirror as a reaction to the photograph
You're still alive, aren't you
All of a sudden, Ben realizes something
He runs back to the file on the table and goes through the documents again, one by one
He stops on a carbon copy of a hospital release form and checks the date
(') You're wrong Larry, you're wrong
His eyes light up- (') she left the hospital on the 4th
According to the document, Anna left two days before the massacre

The little girl is humming as she watches herself in the mirror
Amy comes out of her room- Come on, come on
Let's go
Daisy, Michael
She passes in front of the children's room and stops- , Amy listens closely, but she can only hear Michael's voice
On the other side of the door, the little boy bursts out in laughter- 88
- '                                          88 She opens the door and finds her son squatting in front of the mirror, talking to his own reflection
What are you doing Michael
Come on, we're going to be late
The little boy does as his mother says
He gets up and dashes out of the room
Amy's glance freezes in horror
Terrified, she almost loses her balance- '      , Amy attempts to speak but can't- The mirror image of her son remains silent
Amy steps closer to the mirror and, in the reflection, behind the boy, she discovers- ,

Right away
What
Amy cannot get the words out
The convulsive sobs overtake her voice
'm so scared, Ben
What's happening
There's something in the house
Something in the mirrors
Where are Daisy and Michael
Are the kids all right
They're with me
They're right here with me
Come over, please
Get out of the house
'll be right over

-'                                             90 Ben runs to his car and throws the Esseker file on the passenger seat
He drives off at full speed and disappears at the far end of the road

'm right here, Amy
'm here now
Thank god you're alright
Ben comforts her, holding her tightly with all his strength
We can't stay here, we have to leave the house now
We can go to my mother's or to a hotel
Anyplace is gonna have mirrors or windows
Anything you can see your self in is dangerous
We have to make the house safe
The only way is to cover all the reflections
If we keep them in the dark we can avoid them
We need paint, we need tape
: 93
-   -                         93 Ben has brought up some more paint from the basement
With Amy's help he paints over all the mirrors in the house
In the face of this hardship, all the arguments seem far away
We can feel a connection between the two of them
The windowpanes and picture frames have been wrapped securely with newspaper and tape
Every inch of reflective surface in the house, such as the - screen and the shiny taps, have been "neutralized" with strips of masking tape
, : 94
-                                         94 The front door of the house opens
On the landing of the front steps, Ben kisses Daisy goodbye
When will you be back, Dad

He kisses Michael who hugs him back- love you, Dad
He strokes Michael gently on the head and goes to his car
Daisy and Michael watch their father leave
Amy walks him to the vehicle- What if you don't find her
Maybe she doesn't live there anymore
Maybe she's really dead
They want her, 'm gonna find her wherever she is
We don't have any other choice
Ben holds her tightly in his arms and plants a tender kiss on her forehead
(') 'm sorry about everything 've put you through
didn't want to
Amy interrupts him
know
Ben gets into the car
Amy,  want you to stay here with the kids until all this is over
All the mirrors are covered, there's no more danger
'll come back as soon as can
Tears well up in Amy's eyes
He takes her hand- (') Hey baby, everything's gonna be fine
love you
She smiles tenderly
Ben drives off

Anna's medical file lies open on the passenger seat- At the top of the page we can read her old address in Pennsylvania

We glide over the treetops, diving deeper into the forest, to follow the main road that zigzags along the slope of the hill

On one of the mailboxes standing on the edge of the road he spots the name Esseker- 100
-                                      100 The wind blows over the land
In the winter season, the muddy fields have little to offer to the few starving crows flying over them
feeling of desolation and solitude hangs over the deserted landscape
Ben's car has left the asphalt road behind, driving through the countryside down a winding dirt road
() 74
100   :                                                   100 An old farmhouse stands at the very end of the path
If it weren't for the parked pick-up truck and the few piglets running wild, one would think that the farmhouse was abandoned
Ben gets out of the car and goes to knock on the door
His shoes sink into the mud
He walks up the steps of the porch and peeks inside the house through the front window
In the dark he discerns the silhouette of a person who is watching
He can't help but notice all the mirrors have been covered or turned towards the wall
big dog barks behind the window
Ben steps back, surprised
The front door opens before Ben has even made his presence known
young man stares at him in silence
Hello
Is this the Esseker farmhouse
The young man nods
woman's voice is heard from inside- ' What is it Jimmy
don't know Mom
(to Ben) What can  do for you sir
am looking for Anna, Anna Esseker
The young man looks at Ben questioningly
Apparently he has never heard the name before
(to his mother inside) There's a man who's looking for
(back to Ben) You said Anna
(Ben confirms) Anna Esseker, Mom
Jimmy's mother, in her fifties, an obese woman who has trouble moving around- shows up in the opening of the door - ' What is it you want with Anna Esseker
She catches him unaware
Ben makes up a false identity- () 75
100   : (2)                                             100 huh
am doing some research for a book on the history of St
John's Hospital, in New York
Jimmy's mother stares at him for a moment with a suspicious look- ' Jimmy, go tell grandpa that there's a man here who'd like to talk to him about his sister
101
-                                  101 We are in the dark basement, under the farmhouse
The door to the first floor opens, letting the light in
Ben appears next to the silhouette of an old man-  , 80 years old, Anna's elder brother
Robert walks down the steps, signaling Ben to follow him- You know, up to this day, the visions of Anna's fits still haunt me at night
They walk through the basement towards an old wooden door
(') helped my father fix up this part of the basement, especially for her- The old man turns the key in the padlock
Slowly, the door swings open, revealing- (') Her fits were too violent
My mother couldn't take her screams anymore
What's left of a very primitive child's room, Rather than a cell, it more resembles a - , As he's talking, images flash on screen- painful memories from that time come back to him- Anna being carried to the basement, her innocent eyes full of hate
It's even hard to recognize the face of a little girl
Her howling screams
Her nails digging into her own flesh
Her unnatural strength and the violent thrashing of her arms and legs
() 76
101   :                                                 101 (') We had every priest, doctor, healer, coming from all over the state, one after the other
But no one could help her
Ben comes closer to the iron bars of the cage
He can see Anna's scratch marks next to the bed, giving his imagination a taste of her plight and suffering
(') Finally, Dr
Kane from New York answered my parents' cry for help
He rejected the idea of demonic possession, said he didn't believe in it
He was convinced that Anna suffered from a rare form of personality disorder
He wanted Anna under his care, at St
John's
My parents were very poor, but he agreed to cover all the hospital costs
In less than five months, Dr
Kane had cured Anna
It was unbelievable
She was her old self again
real miracle of science
And after the hospital
You don't know
She died there with all of Kane's other patients
Ben takes the old release form out of his pocket and shows it to Robert
Anna left the hospital two days before the massacre
Kane changed the records to make her disappear
You're not a journalist, are you
What do you want
want to know
After St
John's, where did she go
Robert stares at Ben, unsure of saying what he's about to reveal to this perfect stranger- Anna came back to live with us for a while
() 77
101   : (2)                                             101 For a while
Robert lowers his eyes
(') And after
Why did she leave
Because
Because strange things started to happen in the house
With Anna
No, not with Anna
The old man obviously doesn't want to get into the details
The memories are too painful
With the mirrors
Robert stiffens, eyeing Ben with a dark look- How does he know
(') Mr
Esseker, tell me where  can find your sister
It's very important
It's a matter of life and death
Robert hesitates - Before he died, Kane sent us a letter asking us to keep Anna away from mirrors and that whatever happens she should be in a place where the mirrors could never find her
Where is she now
To protect us, she left the house and joined the monastic orders, where mirrors are forbidden
St
Augustine's monastery, on the road to Midwich

He sits down on the steps, and wipes his glasses
The crows fly low in the sky- It's a bad sign
: 103
-                                     103 The nuns come and go under the arches of the monastic courtyard
deadly silence prevails over the monastery, where time seems to stand still
All these women have taken vows of poverty, obedience and chastity to serve god
On the other side of the cloister wall, a small winding road zigzags between the pine trees
Ben's car draws nearer
He parks in front of the entrance to the monastery
104
-                            104 Ben pushes open the heavy front door
The place is dark and silent
He goes to the front desk- Behind a wooden screen he can barely make out the two nuns in charge of admissions
They are the only nuns granted exposure to the outside world
For the rest, physical and visual contact is strictly prohibited
Yes, how can  help you
Hello Sister
have come to visit a member of your community
Sister Anna

No, not really
Are you a relative

Please, tell her that  came all the way from New York and that  work with Dr

John's Hospital

She stands up and escapes through one of the back doors
The other nun behind the screen, observes Ben with curiosity
Time goes by, and Ben grows impatient

-                                        107 Inside the house in Jersey, Amy has isolated herself with the kids in the parent's bedroom
She's reading them a bedtime story
Even if all the windows, screens, and  are covered by newspapers or painting, Amy acts in front of Daisy and Michael as if nothing has happened
In the rest of the house, everything has been meticulously covered, wrapped, painted or reversed
Still, here and there, a barely audible rustle pierces through the silence- In the children's room, the paint covering the mirror slowly begins to flake off
The newspaper wrapped around the windowpanes begins to rip
107A
-                           107A Ben is losing his calm
Time is running out
The nun reappears behind the wooden screen- Sister Anna has agreed to talk to you, you may proceed to the parlor next door
Ben crosses the hall and opens the door that the nun gestures him to
He enters the parlor alone

St
John's closed down in 1952
Who are you
Ben sits down
Even at a short distance he cannot discern the face of Anna Esseker, who is now Sister Anna
My name is Benjamin Carson
work as a night watchman at 1229 West 38th Street in New York City, what used to be St
John's Hospital
What is it you want Mr
Carson
need your help
My help
don't quite see how  could possibly be of any help
My wife and children are in danger
What is threatening my family is asking for you
For a split second, Ben makes eye contact with Anna behind the screen
She has understood
(') If you don't help me  may lose the only thing that matters to me
cannot leave the precincts
It's impossible
Tell me why are the mirrors from the old hospital so determined to find you
Sister Anna remains silent- (') must know, Sister
It is not the wish of the mirrors to find me, but of what is imprisoned inside them
The mirrors are merely windows on our world

For what
For whom
At the time that  was at St
John's, Dr
Kane's therapy for personality disorders consisted of locking the patient up in a mirrored room for several days on end, in order to force him to confront his own image
spent the darkest days of my life in that room
On the 6th day the nurses found me lifeless, almost dead
Since that day,  have never had another fit
But deep down inside 've always known the truth
What truth
There is no cure for schizophrenia, it was something else, Mr
Carson
And whatever it was, it entered the mirror
We can feel the emotion in her voice
(') thought that after fifty years, this would have all gone away
They would have disappeared from the mirrors didn't know
'm sorry but if agree to go with you and return to that place,  will make it possible for them to cross the threshold back into the real world
Everything is now making sense for Ben- It entered with you and they need you to get out
The consequences of such an act, Mr
Carson, would be more devastating than letting them suffer where they are now
'm going to pray for you and your family
That's all  can do right now, Mr
Carson
God bless you
She stands to leave

Please, listen to me- Terence Berry, Gary Lewis and many others before me
Those are the people who died trying to find you
Because they failed, their families died too
My sister was murdered two days ago
My wife and kids will next if you don't come with me
Look- From his wallet Ben takes out a wrinkled photograph of Michael, as a baby, in Amy's arms
Daisy stands next to them in the picture
Ben presses the photograph against the grating for Anna to look at it
(') My wife and two children
They're all 've got
They're innocent
Please
Anna stays quiet a moment behind the screen and leaves

It's almost nightfall
The bells from the monastery begin to toll
The cross above the monastery reflects upside down in a puddle of rain water
Frustrated, Ben walks back to his car and dials his home number on his cell phone - 106

In the distorted reflection, we see Michael's silhouette approaching

Sister Anna is back in her cell
The way her hand shakes as she carries the match from one candle to the other betrays how upset she is by the confrontation with Ben- It's been too much time that she's carrying the guilt
She runs the rosary nervously between her fingers and kneels down in front of her bed to pray when- loud muted sound followed by a sudden wave of agitation is heard outside the cell
Someone has broken into the monastery
She recognizes Ben's voice- Like a mad man, he's looking for her everywhere and threatens the other nuns to show him the way
Anna stands up when Ben bursts into her cell with his gun in his hand
Behind him, the other nuns are terrified
Ben points the gun at Anna- My kids are not going to die tonight

She is suffocating
At the last minute, she turns her head to gasp for air

The blade glides over her skin
In reality,       '
Instinctively, Amy throws herself against Daisy, tearing her away from the grip of her own reflection
They land on the floor and crawl to the corner of the room, safe from the danger of the reflections
Amy tears off a piece of her clothing, which she presses against Daisy's throat in order to stop the bleeding
Oh my god, don't move baby, don't move
Amy is out of control, holding Daisy tightly in her arms

Fortunately, Daisy's wound is not deep
The blade did not reach the main artery
Amy saved her life at the very last minute
Daisy is half conscious from the loss of blood

But for now, we have to get out of here

Yes, he'll be here soon as he can
bit further away, in the scraped section of the mirror, we can see Amy's reflection, on its knees above Daisy who lies on the floor- , Amy's double has killed her own daughter
Using the scissors, she's "working" on the dead body
What exactly is she doing to the little girl
She turns toward us, revealing '         , , , the forces of the mirrors are determined to get them

As she passes the bureau, she grabs the first-aid-kit from one of the drawers
She sets her daughter down in the walk-in closet, away from the mirrors
The little girl has trouble moving
Amy examines the cut on Daisy's throat
Quickly, with a professional touch, she disinfects and bandages the wound
Listen to me carefully Daisy

Daisy is terrified and with her remaining strength, she holds on to her mother tightly
(') You have to be brave, sweetheart want you to stay in here and not get out until  come back, no matter what happens

She is anxious, and even with her eyes shut, she can sense the threatening vibes sent off by the mirrors
Ben is focused, gazing straight ahead as they cross the ground floor in the direction of the basement door
Yet, from the corner of his eye, he cannot help but glimpse the mirrors

Above the sink, the newspaper on the windows had been ripped as well and the hot steam is now covering the glass The forces are everywhere
Amy steps back and runs out of the kitchen
The sound of rapid, splashing footsteps catches her attention
Amy turns around and leaves the kitchen- Michael
Michael's reflection sweeps over the water surface

Daisy curls up in the corner of the closet, overtaken with fear- It's only the cat who enters the room with a meow

We are no longer in the New Jersey house, but in the subterranean passageways corridors of the department store
Ben and Anna's silhouettes appear, walking down the stairs
Ben turns on his flashlight
The lights along the corridor are too weak
Watch your step, a water pipe has burst, the whole basement is flooded
Ben guides Anna, with her eyes still shut, through the tunnels
The beam of the flashlight sweeps across the walls, and the piping

In the silence, he waits
He must establish beyond a doubt that it's all over
He aims his flashlight at the surface of the water- Everything seems to be back to normal
His reflection is deformed by the slight stir of the water, slowly becoming placid
Ben steps over the rubble to enter the mirror room- All the mirrors have been pulverized leaving behind only the metal cage that was holding them in place
The floor is covered with thousands of pieces of mirror floating in the water, shimmering in the shadows
The beam of the flashlight sweeps the room in search of Anna, or her dead body- Nothing
Ben inspects all the dark corners behind the metal structure - The woman has vanished
He aims his flashlight at the ceiling
The beam of light instantly reveals a dark shape hanging above him- It's her, or at least what is left of her-  , ,

He drops his flashlight to the ground, trying to resist her as much as he can
, Ben manages to pin the creature against the wall
"Anna" spits blood in his face
He applies all his strength to immobilize her- the shards of glass dig deeper into the elderly woman's flesh, which only seems to provide her an intense pleasure
"Anna" froths at the mouth
Her speech has become a deep, animalistic, incomprehensible gurgle
In an effortless movement, "Anna" pushes him away
Her demonic strength is ten times his
Ben is merely a puppet, a rag doll that she sends flying into the air, only to crash violently against the brick walls
Blood squirts onto the surface of the water
Ben smashes into the wall separating the mirror room from the underground passageways
On the other side, he lands on the ground, in the dark
He strives to regain consciousness
Ben takes advantage of the brief respite to pull out his gun but- "Anna" appears from the dark and, in a flash, she strikes a backhanded blow that sends the gun off into the air
She lifts Ben up and throws him across the room
He rams into the wall
With the absence of light in the basement, Ben is defenseless
He cannot see his assailant
Ben is caught by the leg and dragged backwards
His hand struggles to catch on to anything that could hold him back
Suddenly, under the water, his hand lands on the gun
He grabs it, turns onto his back, and fires point-blank at "Anna"
The bullets go flying through her body, but they don't stop her

He manages to grab hold of one pipe after the other, trying to hold on, but the pipe gives way and breaks off from the wall,
Once again, Ben is sent flying down the tunnel
He struggles to get back on his feet- Apart from the sound of the flowing gas, a disturbing silence surrounds the subterranean passageways
Ben makes out "Anna's" silhouette, hiding behind the leaking gas pipe
With his bloodied face, Ben is no longer the same man anymore- Something in his eyes has shifted
Rage and violence have replaced the terror and dread
He is determined to put an end to the creature, no matter what happens
He slides the weapon in his belt and steps, with his bare hands, towards what once was "Anna"
Crouched over in the water, the demon looks up, ready to charge
Ben takes another step forward with the same determination
The creature thrusts itself against him- Ben uses all his strength to keep his assailant's jaw at a distance
In a swift movement, Ben turns around   "" - Despite being momentarily immobilised, the demon seems unaffected by the near total destruction of its outer shell
On the contrary, it struggles more violently to escape from the trap
Ben moves away, keeping an eye on "Anna"
He takes his gun and aims it at her
Ben is exhausted
With his arm outstretched, he is ready to shoot, waiting for the right moment
The silhouette suddenly emerges from the dark
Ben stands by- The demon goes through the cloud of gas- Ben fires- ""
Ben throws himself to the ground to avoid the flames

Totally burnt, flesh charred, "Anna" is enraged by her prey's resistance
The blazing demon runs after Ben

Amy is unable to bring back her son
Nonetheless, she continues with the same determination, refusing to accept reality
She finally breaks down, pleading with the sky above
129B                                        129B Lost and floating in this strange and unfamiliar place, Ben turns and sees Michael's body/soul which is also trapped in this parallel dimension, on the other side of the mirror
In the distance, he can see the surface leading to the hallway of the New Jersey house
Above it, Amy tries to resuscitate Michael

-                                        131 The sunbeams slice through the windowpanes of the glass dome above the entrance hall of the department store
The pigeons fly in and out
The burnt mannequins are still standing in the middle of the ruins
,         1920's The floor has completely subsided
It looks like there was just an earthquake under the building
In the middle of the pile of debris, something in the rubble begins to move- - It's Ben
He gasps for air
Wounded and covered in dust, it is a miracle that he has survived

131   :                                                 131 He struggles back to his feet and climbs over the blocks of concrete to regain the ground floor
Limping, he crosses the entrance hall
His discovery of the absence of mirrors on the walls brings a smile to his face- He has finally triumphed over the mirrors that he once believed to be indestructible

-                                           132 Ben steps out of the department store, walks out of the closed off area, and reaches the street
Police cars, fire trucks, and ambulances with spinning lights have surrounded the fencing

He needs medical attention
He catches sight of Lorenzo, talking to some policemen
Ben stops dead in his tracks- ,    , Ben glances at the police vehicles and their license plates- How is it possible

Ben turns around towards a glass building where a homeless person is sleeping- His eyes fill with horror- () 104
133   :                                                   133 Ben presses his hand against the glass
The reflection of the world surrounding him is the right way around in the mirror but he remains invisible
He removes his hand from the mirror, leaving a clear and well- defined handprint on the reflective surface
Ben slowly comes to realize what is happening to him - , - : 134

Its fingers suddenly twitch
Was it the bumpy road
The dead fingers twitch again and- , '
It turns its head- '    ,
