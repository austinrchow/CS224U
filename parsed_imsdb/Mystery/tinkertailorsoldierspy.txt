-  - 1973 -                           1 Budapest skyline, looking towards the Parliament building
From here the world looks serene, peaceful
Then, as we begin to  , we hear a faint whine, increasing in volume, until it's the roar of two MiG jet fighters, cutting across the skyline
The   reveals a watching the jets, exclaiming excitedly in Hungarian
2
-                                     2 down a bustling street, as the jets scream by overhead
Pedestrians look up
All except one man who continues walking
This is
: More pedestrians
We're not sure who we're supposed to be looking at - the short stocky man
The girl in the mini skirt
The man in the checked jacket
car driving beside Prideaux accelerates out of the frame
Across the street the girl in the mini-skirt peels off into a shop
The stocky man turns and waves to us
But it isn't Prideaux he's greeting but another passerby, who walks over, shakes hands
Now we're left with Prideaux and the Magyar in the checked shirt, neither paying any attention to each other
Just as we are wondering if there is any connection, the two reach a corner and the Magyar, pausing to cross the road, collides with another passerby
He looks over and sees Prideaux has caught the moment of slight clumsiness and gives the smallest of rueful smiles
tiny moment of contact between the two
Then both men walk on around the corner, just two strangers headed in the same direction
3
-                                         3 Shooting up the steps of the exit to the imposing building on the corner ahead
Prideaux and the Magyar walk up the steps, still paying no attention to each other, and head towards
4
-  -                                  4 formerly grand arcade
Many of the shops are now closed, the one's that are open don't have much to sell occupies the middle space under the high vaulted ceiling band rehearses in one of the nearby disused shops, incongruous in the window, music muffled by the glass
Customers sit around tables playing chess, drinking coffee, a mother breast-feeding, the hum of chatter
The ordinary world
2
We find Prideaux and the Magyar sitting at one of the tables
(Hungarian, subtitled) And porkolts
You know porkolts
(Hungarian, subtitled) Yes, 've had it
It's very good
Better than goulash
But you won't get it in Budapest now
Why's that
All the pigs have gone to Moscow
He gives a sly laugh
Prideaux smiles, draws   on his cigarette, nonchalantly examining the people   at the tables around them
arrives, belly bulging   out of his grubby shirt, hair plastered to his head
He   puts two wizened-looking sandwiches in front of them
'
-     trickles from the Waiter's face, drips onto the table top
The Magyar catches Jim looking at the droplet and gives a wry smile - "nice service
" Jim smiles back but a bell has begun to ring inside him
When do  get to meet your friend
The Magyar chews on his sandwich, notices Prideaux is ignoring his
'll take you to him
Not eating
Prideaux pushes his sandwich across the table, his manner still easy, but his eyes flick after the Waiter, who stands at the entrance to the coffee shop, arguing with another man
He looks around the Galeria again, looking low - checking the feet of the other customers
Then raising his gaze, he checks the windows of the apartments above which look down into the arcade
'
- An   stands in the shadows by a window above
She is watching him
Catching his gaze she shrinks back into the darkness and disappears
3
Prideaux's expression doesn't change but he sets his coffee cup down and casually stands
The Magyar looks up in surprise
Would you excuse me a moment
He starts to walk towards the exit of the Galeria
Behind him his chair teeters for a moment, then slowly falls back and lands with a , sending pigeons fluttering up to the domed ceiling
The  starts, turns, sees Prideaux leaving
Panic flashes across his face, he draws a  from the back of his belt, aims after Prideaux and  - the shot echoing in the cavernous space
The shot misses,  off the tiled wall and Prideaux keeps walking, fighting down the impulse to run, as behind him, out of focus - an image from a surreal : the other  stop what they are doing, like actors at the end of a scene, and begin to rise, some drawing guns
We hear a muffled voice shouting distantly in Russian
No firing
Ahead of Prideaux   more figures appear, blocking the exit
He looks over his   shoulder just as another  rings out - this one catching   him above the shoulder blade and sending him flying out of   frame
From around a corner a tall, over-coated man -  - strides towards the scene, still bellowing in Russian
(') Who told you to fire
Who told you to fucking fire
have stopped playing and are staring at the ground, arms at their sides, anxious not to see anything
In the   - the   slips back into sight
- Prideaux lies face down in the arcade below
As we watch one of his arms slides out, leaving a slick of blood
Then he's still
- The  Man has grabbed the Waiter and started to beat him
(') Fucking Hungarian amateur
We wanted him alive
4
Behind him we can see the breast-feeding
She's dead, a bullet hole in the centre of her forehead from the ricochet
The baby continues to suckle on, undisturbed
Through the cafe window we can see a , partly obscured by the crowd in front of us, the only man still seated
He lights a cigarette
as he replaces it
We can make out an inscription: "To George, from Ann
All my love
" In the Galeria the  Man continues to bellow at the Waiter
The baby begins to

middle-aged woman, one of the secretaries or "" walks past, pushing a trolley of documents
She nods at Connie mournfully
Connie looks stricken
The Mother walks on into

-   -                            5 long conference table
We are looking at an at the head of the table
He's sitting on a rather ornate carving chair - a little like a throne - and he looks ill
He is signing documents, his signature a simple "," scrawled in  , aware all eyes are on him cigarette burns away in an already loaded ashtray
This is the head of the Circus - known as
Around him are four lieutenants - the inner circle of the intelligence service -  ,  , and
Beside him, his right-hand man -
From the thick and embarrassed atmosphere we might guess we are at the end of a coup, the final ousting of a King
All we hear is the ticking of a loud clock and the scratch of the pen
Smiley looks up to find Alleline's gaze fixed on him
Alleline quickly looks down at his hands
5
- as he examines the others, gauging the occurring in the room
- Bill Haydon - handsome, urbane, frowning with tension, pulls on his cigarette
- Roy Bland - heavy set and moustached, flicking a guilty look up at Smiley and away
- Toby Esterhase - immaculate hair and suit, eyes on Alleline, watching for a cue, like a dog told to `stay'
No-one will look at him
- realising there is no hope
Control finishes, puts the pen back in his pocket
He hands the file to the  who, red-eyed, walks with it out of the room
(Scottish accent) wish  could have done more, Control
(Coolly) You did all you could, Percy
(Beat) Well, a man should know when to leave the party
Beat
The clock suddenly gives a discordant chime as it sounds the hour
hint of bitter amusement on Control's face, as though he's been waiting for this wrong little note to make his move
He grinds his cigarette out
Toby can't wait any longer
What about Smiley
Control looks at Smiley
His gaze impersonal
- the faintest flicker in his eyes as he tries to prepare himself for the shock of dismissal
Smiley is leaving with me
6                                                          6 7
-   -                                7 Control and Smiley as they walk down the corridor

Alleline and the Lieutenants are waiting for them horribly awkward moment
Toby pulls open the cage lift doors for them, as if to hasten the eviction
Haydon looks at him with contempt
You little prick Esterhase
Control sweeps past them and the lift, determined to walk every step of the way
Smiley follows
8
-  -                                  8 Control and Smiley, begin their descent through the rigid hierarchy of the Circus
As we  with them, we see that each floor is its own
The two men walk past the fourth floor  - the vast archive of intelligence, staffed by
Smiley and Control pass down another flight and along the third floor -   - heads poking out of offices, amongst them
Down to the second floor -  - the muscle of the Circus
The boredom of an air-port lounge, a sunken sofa and pool-table
The Scalphunters watching them go in respectful silence
On down to the first floor   - staffed by pretty young society girls - the  - who watch open-mouthed, as their Chief passes them for the last time
And finally down to
9
- -  -                         9 An ancient doorman -  - feeling the moment must be marked in some way - leaves his sentry box and opens the main door for Control
Control acknowledges the salute with a flick of his eyes and we push through the doors
10
-     -                        10 Alleline and Bland stand smoking, watching Control and Smiley emerge onto the pavement
11
-                                             11 and  stand on the street
They stare at each other for a moment
This is goodbye
They shake hands
Perhaps there's a little reserve in Control's manner, a lack of warmth
From the expression on Smiley's face we see that he is pained by this
7
Control puts his collar up and walks away
Smiley stands forlornly as Control disappears into the crowd
12
-                               12 - still, glassy
' head breaks the surface - Smiley swimming through his retirement
He takes a breath and submerges again
Beyond him we see a straggled diagonal line of elderly heads, bobbing through the water
13
-                                     13 Smiley dries himself under the trees, pink and raw in the cold fresh air
He smooths his hair down, feeling a little less ridiculous
He looks over to where a is being helped into the water - little more than trembling bones
Is this his world now

-   -                               14 unloads a stack of files from a  shaft and places them into her wheeled safe
piece of is wound along the trolley
We track with her through the - atmosphere of the fifth floor, behind her the conference room - a glimpse of Alleline in Control's chair, surrounded by his lieutenants - smoke and whiskey - engaged in the business of the world
She pushes on into Alleline's  - loads the new files into the   there, locks and spins the combination

He turns a page, examines the illustration of a knight and a dragon - holds it at arms length, trying to focus on it

One of them is applying lipstick, prior to leaving
She doesn't react as we track by

Through the window she catches a glimpse of the Mystery Man's legs passing, the briefcase in his hand as he walks up the steps towards the front door
Calmly she dries her hands as the doorbell rings and her  begins to bark furiously
25
-   -                       25 Mrs McCraig opens the door and the figure passes her and the barking dog without a word and begins to walk up the stairs

He walks towards the house
29
-   -                       29 The Mystery man settles at the table, sorting through the contents of the briefcase as, from down below, we hear the sound of the door bell, the dog barking and footsteps on the stairs
Polyakov walks into the room and joins the Mystery Man at the small table
He picks up the camera with a smile

As we watch her we hear stealthy footsteps approach
Then a steps into frame, his back to us, watching the girl through the window
He taps on the glass with one hand
Jackie looks up, surprised
As we pull back a little we see the man has his other hand behind his back
And in it is a long, bone-handled
Behind Jackie we see a string bean of a man,  , tying his silk dressing gown as he cautiously approaches the window
On the other side, the intruder stands, smoking
(through glass) This is private property
Who are you
He takes in the man before him - filthy and bearded, you could mistake him for a tramp
But beneath the grime he's tanned and his eyes have a dangerous, feral edge
This is Minister Lacon
He smiles
What do you want
want to talk to Control
And want breakfast

Handsome, boyish, bored
He hears a  behind him
It's Haydon, one foot up on his pedal, scootering along the corridor
Guillam waits for him
He likes this man
(of the bike) Has that been cleared
'm not bloody chaining it outside
Mind you, probably no safer in here, with you bunch of cut-throats
They arrive at a half-paned office cubicle
Inside is a very pretty , a new , being shown the ropes by an older woman
Thought 'd get a glimpse of the new girl
Before Bland gets to her
He seen her yet
Oh yes
Down first thing
'
- as Haydon and Guillam pass, staring in at her, cropped above the waist
Haydon appears to be gliding supernaturally by
He gives a little wave
: You may fuck me, Belinda, but you still have to call me sir in the morning
Guillam grins
Haydon glides off, hand raised in farewell as Guillam turns into the Scalphunters arena

pool ball thwacks the window, cracking it
At the same moment the  begins to ring
Guillam jerks upright, looks over at the pool players, too bored to be angry
(
) Sorry Peter
Guillam answers the phone
Peter Guillam
He listens to the voice on the other end
After a moment he turns away from his colleagues, his former drowsiness abruptly gone

(Surprised) Hello, Peter
They stare at each other
Smiley takes in his expression - this is not a social call
(') Have  time to change
Guillam nods, following Smiley into the house
He glances at a painting on the wall - a muddy
He crosses to examine it and then notices the bundle of Ann's unopened letters
39
'  -                                 39 Guillam enters the kitchen, notes the single place set for dinner
It dawns on him that he really has invaded Smiley's privacy
Smiley appears in a coat behind him, taking in Guillam's awkwardness
He gives a thin smile
Are we going far
39A
'  -                                39A Smiley and Guillam sit in silence, as Guillam drives through London
It's a Citroen , all sleek leather and mahogany interior

We pan up and through the open window see an anxious Lacon is leading Guillam towards the house
Smiley follows, talking to Lacon's daughter
How's your mother
Very well
(referring to the window) Is this where he got out
14
Mmm,  came back in and it was wide open
(beat) Do send her my love
Apologies for singling you out, but
very sensitive matter
He gives an uncomfortable bark of laughter
(') If one can't trust one's own nephew
You know who he was
Ricki Tarr, sir
One of my scalp- hunters
He's been on the wanted list for a year
Last job was Istanbul, bit of coat-trailing for a Russian convention
Why is he on the wanted list
(beat) He killed our man in Istanbul
Cut his throat
Been on the run since then
If possible, Lacon looks even more shaken
My God
In my own home
my family
The bloody animals you people employ
41
'  -                                  41 as he leads Smiley and Guillam down the hall, gesturing for his  to take Jackie away
He attempts some social niceties, but his tone is strained
And how are you George
Missing one's work, one's buddies
Oh,  think  manage pretty well, thank you
They reach a large room, minimalist apart from a grand piano framed by vast glass windows
tall, well built young man - - stands on guard
Lacon gestures to him and Fawn opens the french windows and he and Guillam walk out onto the terrace beyond
15
Behind them, unnoticed, young  creeps back into the room and slips behind the sofa
Your wife, the lovely Ann
She's in the pink, and so on
Very well
(Beat) Very bonny
Fawn closes the french doors behind him and Lacon is suddenly all business
Do you know this man Tarr
(Mildly) recruited him actually
In Penang
Good with women
Likes to talk
What did he say to you
He said he had some intelligence for Control
Had no idea he was dead
The news obviously hadn't reached Wonga Wonga land
Then he said he would only tell it to someone outside the Circus
If he couldn't have a Minister, he would settle for the Under-secretary
Lucky me
Lacon lights a cigarette, smokes a moment, building up to something
Smiley waits him out
The room has become very still
(') He said there's a mole
Right at the top of the Circus
And that he's been there for years
Smiley absorbs this
The moment is suddenly broken by a few stray notes from the piano
The two jump slightly and turn to where Jackie sits at the keyboard, smiling triumphantly
42                                                         42 43
'  -  -                          43 Smiley and Lacon stand on the terrace alone
Lacon glances anxiously at Smiley, trying to read him
was sad to see you go, George thought it was shabby, very shabby
() 16
(') But the Minister agreed with Sir Percy
New broom, clean sweep, wheat from the chaff and all that
And to be fair, Percy has had some marvellous results since you and Control left
Realizing how this sounds, he glances at Smiley to see how much damage he's caused
(') Anyway, it does mean you're rather ideally placed to look into this matter for us now, doesn't it
Outside the family
Smiley looks blandly back at him
am retired, Oliver
Silence
Lacon looks uncomfortable, something he hasn't yet said
Thing is, some time back, when Control was still alive, he came to me with a similar suggestion
Smiley looks at him, surprised
(') He never mentioned his suspicions to you
No
just thought
with you being "his man", so to speak
What did you say to him
(Beat) 'm afraid  thought his paranoia had got the better of him and he was pulling his own house down
That does happen in your business
And that bloody mess in Budapest
Smiley stares out over the rolling countryside, inscrutable
(') Damn it, George, this is your generation, your legacy
() 17
(') If there's any truth in this you'd think you'd want to
He controls himself
(Beat) 'll keep Peter Guillam
And there's a retired special branch man
Mendel
'd like to have him
Lacon exhales, his relief palpable
Yes, yes
Do your own housekeeping
Good man
He glances back at Guillam and Lacon's daughter, picking out a melody on the grand piano
(') Damn thing cost a fortune
Three years of lessons and all  hear is Edelweiss
You and Ann never had children, did you
No, we never did
We hear the piano playing on as we

Smiley raises a hand
The Apiarist steps away from the hive and removes his hat to reveal a long thin face, keen eyes -

'  -                                     46 Mendel, now in an overcoat and carrying a battered briefcase, climbs into the back of the car with a nod to Smiley and Guillam in the front
He begins to roll a cigarette as Guillam drives away
18
stow-away  appears from somewhere and begins to buzz around the car
Guillam and Mendel swat at it clumsily
Smiley stares ahead in silence
He winds down the window and the bee flies to safety

Smiley's new landlady    is supervising a gormless teenager -  - who is struggling into the room with a rickety card table
Mendel and Guillam take it from him and set it into the room
From the next room comes the unmistakable sounds of someone having sex
(re the table) It's Georgian,  shouldn't lend it to you but since Mister Mendel recommends you
She gives the table a sentimental tap, raising her voice a little to drown out the excesses from the room next door
(') You will love it for me won't you
It belonged to Mister Pope- Graham
She glances at Smiley who has his back to her looking out into the London street
'
looking out at rooftops opposite and a travel agents sign which reads
(
) My friend just wants peace and quiet in order to work, Mrs Pope- Graham, no disturbances
And that's what he shall have
You want anything you can ask Norman, can't he, Norman
And they leave

Finally his face relaxes a little

New arrival, eh
Middle of year
What's the story
Roach hesitates
(Blushing) My mother and father
my father's left, so
He doesn't know how to explain his misery any further
Prideaux pretends not to notice
Bill
The unpaid Bill
Anyone ever call you that
No sir
Known a lot of Bills
They've all been good `uns
What you good at
Roach tries desperately to think of something

Nothing sir
The boy's eyes start to
Prideaux looks down, busies himself with brushing at something on his shirt
You're a good watcher though eh
Us loners always are
No one else spotted me when  turned up here
Best watcher in the unit, Bill Roach is, 'll bet
Long as he's got his specs on
Right
(Gratefully) Yes sir
Prideaux finishes his drink, nods to Roach
Free period, isn't it
Don't waste it down here
Roach sets off up the dip
He looks back and sees Prideaux has walked into the caravan and stands with his back to him, rubbing his aching shoulder

How long have you been here
Few days
Needed somewhere to hide
Smiley notices the pile of letters for his wife Ann - they've been disturbed

Smiley fights down his anger

There's every chance they're watching it

Calculated risk Mister Smiley wanted to see you, figured you'd turn up here sooner or later
What do you want Ricki
There's a woman

Her name's Irina

Boris lies, unconcerned, reaches for his cigarettes
Irina walks past him and we track with her as she enters a The glass window here is two-thirds frosted and we lose her as she bends over a basin

Then a car sweeps past on the road below and there's a flash of light behind Ricki's head - the headlights reflected in the lenses of the now visible Irina absorbs this
Above everything else, anger at her humiliation being observed

As we watch he draws the curtains along the length of the room, obscuring our view

Tarr walks in and stops
Tufty lies on the floor, in a pool of blood
He's been tortured, one eye gouged out
The other manages to convey a rather touching amazement at the violence worked on him
His throat has been slit wide open
Tarr absorbs this, looks at the knife in his own hand, turns and runs

paranoid Ricki watches from the back of the hall
He notices a child react to something - follows his gaze

- behind glass panels - a glimpse of three men wheeling a gurney - a bandaged figure upon it
Just before the figure disappears, a hand moves a little
Tarr watches Irina's departure, sick with guilt

He stands up abruptly, heading for the door
Where are you going Ricki
You said yourself, Karla will be looking for you

Who's going to keep you safe

He looks what he is
man who knows he's
Across from him the  stands, an almost malignant presence
Alleline stares at it, a light film of sweat on his forehead

Alleline walks along the courts, new racquet in hand, uncomfortable in his too- tight white shorts
He reaches a court
Inside  and the  are playing a furious game of squash
127
-                                   127 The three men stand talking within the transparent cube of the court
Lacon and the Minister are still sweating from their game
The Minister is smoking
Percy has always resisted suggestions of wider exploitation of Witchcraft's intelligence
Drop the bloody jargon, Lacon
've refused to share Witchcraft with our allies, so far, Minister
Greedy boy
My goal has been to establish his track record beyond all doubt think the time has come to approach our American brothers-in- arms
The Minister considers this with some excitement, takes a drag on his cigarette
You think they'll take us back into bed
'm not interested in a one-off trade
want on-going access to American intelligence
This stops the Minister
He turns to face Alleline
Do you think we can get it
Alleline senses he has just risen several rungs
He slashes inexpertly with his racquet

The tinkle of glasses from a happy Christmas party

) (mock out-rage) Percy

We find Control - arm outstretched, finger pointing
Percy
Did you do this
Christmas Party of the past
Control, at the height of his powers, a punch glass in hand
Noise and music: the normally earnest atmosphere of the Circus released in an unexpectedly boisterous gathering
(') You penny pinching Scot
Can you not take a bloody order
No one is to tamper with the recipe
It's going to take us five hours to get drunk on this piss water
Alleline tries to smile
followed the recipe
He glances nervously at his wife, a vivacious alcoholic, just beginning to make a show of herself
She puts a - party hat from the cracker onto Alleline's head
He brushes it off, anxious not to appear the fool
(') (Muttering) For God's sake Mary
, wearing a crown from the cracker at a rakish angle, appears in the nick of time, leads Alleline's wife out for a dance, teasing the sullenness from her
They're good dancers
Alleline relieved, crisis averted
58
129A
-    -                     129A We find Smiley trapped in a conversation with an earnestly drunk deb
Control raises his arm above the melee
He's still at the punch bowl
Smiley
Where's Ann
Get me a lady of taste
Ann will sort it out
(grateful to get away from the deb) 'll go find her
Smiley threads his way through the party, walking amongst his colleagues, enjoying himself
Jerry Westerby and Connie Sachs are arm in arm, singing along to a song - "The Second Worst Spy in the World
" They link Smiley to them for a verse, others joining in around them
The song segues into the Russian National Anthem
The crowd sing lustily, many of them Russian-speaking, enjoying the chance to sing with vigour
Smiley walks on
Behind him the song ends to be replaced by the   song we heard earlier

Smiley takes a turn with her, and extricates himself
Still smiling
130
-    -  -           130 he walks down a dark corridor, the noise of the party fading away behind him
He stops seeing something in the shadows of an office
For a moment he doesn't understand what he's seen
Two shapes locked in an embrace
Smiley stands, nakedly absorbing the body blow
Then he turns and walks back to the heat and noise of the party
59
131
-  -                         131 Smiley and Guillam sit on a bench
Smiley has his towel, hair wet from his swim
You look tired
Smiley considers telling Guillam about Tarr's visit, but an instinct for secrecy wins out
Yes
didn't sleep well
(Beat) want you to get something for me, Peter
need the duty officer's log book for last November
'm sorry, but 'm going to have to send you up a floor, into the Lion's den
(Beat) If you have the slightest reservation
Is feeling sick to your stomach a slight reservation
If you're caught, Peter, you can't mention me
'm sorry, but you're alone
Guillam nods
He gets up and walks quickly away
After a moment a  rises from a nearby bench and saunters over
It's Mendel
You're clean
Nothing on your back
Nothing on your conscience

He springs up the four steps
133
- -  -                       133 Guillam is at the security gate at the dingy lobby
The security guard, Bryant, steps from his box
Beyond him is the row of lifts
Mister Guillam
How's the family
60
Fine, Bryant
Up to Registry today
Okay sir
Yellow one for the bag sir
Bryant stamps a  chit and hands it to Guillam, pulling open the lift cage
He gives him a yellow slip for the bag
Guillam climbs inside and begins to ascend, rattlingly slowly
As Bryant's head disappears
Time you oiled this thing, isn't it
(
) We keep asking
Guillam examines the chit
He wipes his hands
For the first time we realize how  he is
Polished shoes appear as they reach the floor, then the uniform trousers of a short man
self-important
Guillam steps out and the Janitor checks Guillam's pink and yellow chit and motions him through a turnstile
Then he stops him short
He gestures for Guillam to raise his arms
You're kidding
New rules
Guillam is briskly frisked
Mind the jewels
Pen and watch sir
He holds up a box and Guillam hands him his fountain pen and watch
The search over Guillam sets off down the corridor, unnerved by the task ahead - betraying his own kind
(
) What the hell are you doing up here
Guillam freezes
Then he turns
It's Bill Haydon standing in a doorway, frowning at him over his spectacles moment
61
You don't look pleased to see me, Bill
Why would  be
You bloody pariah
Then Bill grins, the grin transforming his face
Guillam smiles back, relief mixing with real warmth
(') We like the Scalp-hunters to know their place
On the second floor
Doing some research
Makes a change from sitting on my arse
Heard it was quiet down there
As the grave
When're you going to give us something to do
Haven't you heard
Technology's the future
No need for you apes anymore
can get you a posting to Northern Ireland if that helps get the blood racing
Thanks anyway
Stick to sitting on my arse
They've reached the end of the corridor
Haydon peels away, a hand raised in farewell
134
-   -                            134 Guillam arrives at a counter which serves to block entry to the vast archive of files beyond
Janitor appears in the entrance
He pushes a book towards Guillam to sign
(re: Guillam's bag) Want me to look after that for you, Mister Guillam
Thanks
62
Gotta give you a chit
The Dolphin'll kill me if  don't
New Rules
So, chit me
The Janitor grins, slaps a chit on the bag, raises the counter and Guillam enters
135

Guillam is filling out requisition slips
Behind the desk, a woman - - watches him
What you up to this weekend
(rakish) Visiting aunts
'll bet
She takes the flimsy's from the back of the slips and posts them into her desk

She hands him back the top copies

He looks at his watch
137
-  -                                  137 The   we saw earlier is being raised from the floor by a Janitor at the winch
Another janitor is removing files from it
Radiating out from the lift cage are the shelves of files that make up the reading room
63
We find Guillam moving along the shelves reading the fluorescent number cards
He takes a file out, leaving his green slip in the brackets provided by each file
Guillam looks across at his real objective
row of anonymous looking files on the next aisle - the archived  ' -, spines bearing the year and month they cover
And in his way - a  perched on a ladder, a  mending a radiator
The Man turns round and stares straight at Guillam
Suddenly he
For a moment Guillam freezes, unnerved
Then he glances over his shoulder and realises the Man is communicating with another behind him
Abruptly, Guillam walks over to the file and swaps it, keeping the title close to his chest
He goes back to his desk, a light film of sweat on his forehead
He sits, a pencil clamped between his teeth, waiting
From somewhere nearby comes the sound of a  , then being answered
Moments later
(To Guillam) Telephone sir
(as though distracted) Oh to hell, who is it
Outside line, sir
Someone rough
The garage,  think, regarding your car
Guillam walks over to the counter, the stolen file hugged to his chest
on a trolley is wheeled towards him and is opened to reveal the

(Beat) Well, damn
Can't you do the bloody repair

The plays, insidiously working its way into her head
She idly taps her pen along to the tune
(
) Have you got the number
141
-   -                           141 Well, hold on
He cups his hand over the mouthpiece
(') Alwyn
Chuck me the bag a minute, will you
Alwyn gets Guillam's bag and brings it over to him
(') Thanks
Alwyn goes back to his post
Guillam, still hugging the phone, takes out a  file from his bag and switches it with the one against his chest
He takes an address book from the bag and finds a number
(') (Into phone) 946-0335
Thanks
He hangs up, hands the bag back to Alwyn and steps back into

-   -                           142 Guillam retraces his steps, placing his dummy file in the pink stack, replacing the one he placed there in its original shelf, remembering to take the green slip from the bracket
It's done
Guillam takes the green slip and hands it to Sal, who signs it and puts it on its spike
Guillam turns

Unfriendly eyes
Could we see you Peter
For a second Guillam can't speak
(') Percy would like quite an urgent word with you
Can you come now to the fifth floor
That would be so kind
Of course
Esterhase turns and Guillam, mind whirring, follows him back out through the counter
(') (to Alwyn, inspired) You might just throw that into the lift for me, mark it for the second floor, save me filling out more bloody chits
Will do sir

) (shouting from the other room) Esterhase, 'll have no phone calls, tell them
The Chief will take no calls, please, ladies

Toby holds the door open for Guillam
We are having a conference

Haydon on his right
Esterhase trots over to his seat
Guillam takes in the  they all seem to have spread out in front of them
(Reading) Well now young Peter Guillam, are you ready for me finally
Guillam, affecting ease, leans against the wall
(') What are you getting up to down there these days, apart from chasing our virgins
Guillam catches a smirk from Esterhase - mocking him
Couple of Arab ploys look quite promising
Other than that, getting quite good at ping-pong
Arabs
You can rent one but you can't buy one
Right Bill
He looks up from the report
Here it comes
(') How's Ricki Tarr these days
(Not missing a beat) Fine
We have tea at Fortnum's every afternoon
require the matter of your discussion with Tarr
Guillam shrugs
'll tell him
He'll be thrilled
Alleline lets the silence build, rather like a bad actor
Everyone is staring at Guillam
(Quietly) What's that shrug for
He  a hand on the desk, tea-cups rattling, a sudden roar
67
(') 'm talking to you about a murderer
'm talking to you about a defector from your own damn section
'm accusing you of consorting with an enemy agent behind my back
Don't damn well shrug at me
How'd you like a term in prison
Guillam's own temper comes to his rescue
But  haven't been seeing him
So get your facts straight and get moment, while the room digests this
relaxation of the tension, as if he's passed some kind of test
So if  told you that Tarr had recently arrived in Paris would you be surprised
Nothing would surprise me about Tarr
And if  told you we happen to know that thirty thousand pounds mysteriously appeared in his bank account last month, would that surprise you
This  shock Guillam, but he manages to hold on to his sullen expression
(') Your man's a defector, Guillam
Got turned by the opposition months ago and now they've sent him back to us
What for
Never mind what for
To muddy the water, that's what for
Spread a whole lot of damn nonsense to get us chasing our tails
The point is this - he's heading for home
The first peep from him you come to the grown-ups, understood
Anyone you see at this table
But not another damn soul

Behind him   is walking down the corridor
He peels off, turning left, humming a tune to himself - the same   that was playing at the garage in the background of Guillam's call
Guillam reacts as he keeps on walking, trying to work out if this
We track with him as his anger and  grow
146
-                                            146 Guillam drives down an alleyway full speed, screeches to a halt as he reaches a group of children playing, edges past them and on into the car body repair shop
He gets and strides past the elderly   we saw earlier
(German, subtitled) He's waiting for you
Guillam strides on, nerves at snapping point, to the other end of the workshop where a Vauxhall waits
Behind him the Mechanic and his  are already beginning to strip the plates off Guillam's car
147
-                                            147 Mendel appears by Guillam's side as they walk towards another waiting car, Guillam simmering with rage

The hotel

Mister Smiley isn't at the hotel, sir
Change of venue
148
'  -                                    148 Tarr sits in Control's green velvet armchair watching
There's a large tape recorder on the table behind him
We hear the door to the flat opening
(
) George
69
Guillam hurries into the room, stops, seeing Tarr
Tarr gives his sunny grin but he's sweating, his eyes full of tension
Hello, Mister Guillam, sorry took so long to come back
Guillam punches him in the face, drags him from the chair, the two struggling
Behind them Smiley and Fawn appear
Smiley watches coolly for a moment then signals Fawn, who drags Guillam off Tarr, expertly pinning his arm
Excuse me, sir
Guillam pulls free angrily
Ricki's been helping us Peter
(Indicating  ) He's been telling us all about his adventures
(To Smiley) He's a double, George
There is no Mole
The whole thing's a pack of lies thought up by Moscow
Karla's bought him for thirty thousand pounds
He pulls the   out of his file
(') (To Tarr) stole that, because of you spied on my own
Do you know how that makes me feel
Smiley holds out his hand for the log book
As you did take the trouble to steal it
Guillam hands him the book and Smiley leafs through the pages
(') Ricki, you said you sent the Circus a telegram concerning Irina's information
Tarr sits up, wiping blood from his mouth
70
(Sullenly) 'right
What was the date
Tarr hesitates, considering
He doesn't know because there was no telegram
The whole thing
November 20th
It would have been November 20th
Evening
Smiley has found the right month
He flicks through the dated pages - 18th November, 19th November
He holds up the book - the next page has been cut out
November 20th is missing
(Beat) Someone is covering their tracks Peter
Unless you think that's just a coincidence
Guillam looks thrown
What about the money
Thirty thousand isn't so much for Karla to pay if it protects his Mole
'm afraid someone in the Circus knows all about Mister Tarr and is doing everything they can to discredit him
Guillam takes the log book from Smiley, runs a thumb down the razored edge of the missing page
He notices some writing on the next page
(Reading) "Enquiries to the fifth floor
" Smiley takes the book again, examines the note
You recognize that handwriting
(Beat) That's Toby Esterhase
71

-                                   149 Smiley and Guillam pull up in front of the hotel
They sit, in weary silence, staring up at the unprepossessing building
Why didn't you tell me
That you had Tarr
Smiley looks at him
Guillam reads the look correctly
(') In case  didn't make it out of the Circus
Secrecy is a habit
Guillam rubs his eyes
should get some rest
And suppose you should get your reading done
Smiley nods
Doesn't move
150
- '  -                     150 The two men are finishing off a bottle of Scotch
Unusually, Smiley is drunk - a result of the alcohol and the lack of sleep
Guillam lies on one of the single beds, staring at the of the four suspects Smiley has pinned on his chessmen
'm sorry
What for
wanted to believe Tarr was lying
(Beat) All this time, thinking 'm fighting a war
It's a sham
Karla won years ago and we didn't even know it
Smiley watches Guillam, estimating how badly all of this is affecting him
(Beat) met him once
Karla

Moscow Centre was in pieces
Purge after purge
Half their Agents were jumping ship and  travelled around signing them up
Hundreds of them
Guillam raises himself up on an elbow, listening

He was on his way back to Russia, and we were pretty sure he was going to be executed

Smiley stares at the room around, projecting his memory of the Delhi cell onto their present surroundings

He points to an   in front of him

He holds up his right hand

Come to the West and we can give you a comfortable life
After questioning
Or you can catch your plane and fly home and be shot, like Bykov, Shur, Muranov
He stares at the  as if expecting an answer, and slightly drunkenly Guillam finds himself turning to the for a response
73
(Beat) What did he say
Smiley doesn't answer -     - the silence stretching - it's all becoming a little surreal
(To the chair) Think of your wife
You have a wife, don't you
brought you some cigarettes, by the way
He mimes placing cigarettes on an invisible table, between him and the chair
(') Use my lighter
He mimes placing the lighter beside the cigarettes
(') "We could arrange for her to join you, we have a lot of stock to trade
If you go back, she'll be ostracised
Think of her
Think about how much she
" He breaks off in sudden impatience with himself
(') Kept harping on about the damn wife
Telling him more about me, than
Should have walked out, of course, but for some reason
it seemed important to save this one
(Beat) So  go on
"Know you're a chain-smoker, help yourself," "We're not so very different you and

something unsettling about it, as if somehow it is acquiring the

Don't you think it's time to recognise there is as little worth on your side as there is on mine
74
Silence
Smiley sits back, dropping the game
(') Never said a word
Not one word
Next morning he got back on his plane, gave the pack of cigarettes back to me, untouched - this was a chain-smoker, mind - and flew off to what he presumed would be his death
He kept my lighter
It was a gift - "To George, from Ann
All my love
" Guillam is still staring at the chair, a little awe-struck
That was Karla
And he flew back to die rather than give in
Yes
(Beat) And that's how  know he can be beaten
Because he's a fanatic
And the fanatic is always concealing a secret doubt
What did he look like
That's the thing
(Beat)  can't remember
He stands up, crosses to the window, embarrassed by what he has to say next
(') After today, Peter you have to assume they're watching you
If there's anything you need tidied up
now's the time
Guillam stares at him, realising what he's talking about
151
'  -                                  151 Guillam and his boyfriend  sit at the table, Richard working his way through a stack of essays

(Braking) Time sir
Prideaux and the rest of the class stand at the "finishing line," but Prideaux is staring down to a line of beech- trees, where a  is walking
It's
(Quietly) Got your specs on Jumbo
Yes, sir
Who's the fellow down there
Roach stares at the stranger eagerly
(Disappointed) Don't know sir
Who is he
Beggarman
Thief
Why doesn't he look this way

Doesn't he like boys
Anyone sees him again, let me know
Don't hold with odd bods hanging about

They dissolve into laughter, but Roach is still anxiously watching Prideaux, noting how his expression has darkened

Guillam accepts the blows with a bloody grin
Something of the school yard fight about it, as the other Scalphunters gather around, ostensibly to break it, up but clearly enjoying the distraction
One of them is trying to pull Kaspar off and, caught by a blow, joins in - the fight escalating as others join in the struggle
Keep your bloody hands off her
He kicks at Guillam, who falls
Belinda gives a shriek of alarm
Christ's sake, don't fight over a bit of skirt
Guillam lies on the floor taking another kick, but his face, turned to us, registers only relief
Job done

Yes
Control asked me to man the phones that night
Said someone was doing a special job for the service
He wanted someone from outside he could trust
If anything came in,  was to tell him and only him

You rang my house

What did you say
Just that there'd been a bit of a crisis
She said you weren't back yet
That was it

All hell broke loose - military yelling about Hungarian tank movements on the border, Lacon and the Minister baying at the door

Sir there's a stranger parked down on the road
He's just sitting there
He dissolves into tears
Prideaux crouches beside him
(Gently) It's alright, old fella
Don't cry
Nobody ever watched like you, did they
Off you go, now
Are you going to have to leave
Prideaux stares at him
'll be fine
You get back to bed
Roach wipes his eyes and leaves
As soon as the door is closed Prideaux crawls under the little chest of drawers, grimacing with pain, working an arm further in

The   of  fixed to the before him
Control, a walking corpse, lowers himself into the armchair, motions Prideaux to take another seat
86
You weren't followed
Prideaux sits, presuming the question is rhetorical
(') Trust no-one, Jim
Especially not in the main stream
What Hungarian identities do you still have running
Andras Benedek, Hungarian journalist based in Paris
Control nods thoughtfully
Then
If you're caught, you keep me out of it
You were acting alone, bit of Private Enterprise
Understood
Prideaux watches him, very still
(') 've had an offer of service Hungarian General
Wants to come over

He has information  need, Jim
What information
Rocketry
Ballistics
Bit of politics
Something in his manner alerts Prideaux
What else
(Beat) Treasure
He has treasure
The name of the Mole Moscow Centre has planted at the top of the Circus
Prideaux's face doesn't change, but he's wondering if the rumours could be true and Control really has gone mad

He's drinking vodka
Which means  was
You were Beggarman
Smiley nods
Just a flicker of the eyes shows us that this is painful for him to hear
What did you make of it, Jim
Control's theory
(Stiff) thought it was madness
To think any one of you could have been a traitor
madness
Smiley is watching him intently - sure he's hiding something
But still you went
Risking your life for a mission you thought was absurd
Why
Prideaux doesn't answer
(') Perhaps some part of you wanted to know if Control was right
Wanted to know if there was a Mole, who it might be
Prideaux shoots him a dangerous look

(Hard) went because Control asked me to go
It's called doing one's duty

The Waiter puts down Prideaux's plate, a drop of sweat from his forehead hitting the table
He looks at the droplet, fakes a smile for the Magyar, looks after the Waiter, scans the floor around him
- There it is - one of the women is wearing the Her coat is different and she's wearing a fur hat now - but the shoes are the one thing the surveillance agents don't have time to change
Prideaux glances up at the apartment windows above, sees the old woman, starts to rise

Those shoes again, stepping in the water and blood on the floor, passing us at eye-level
Grouping and regrouping as the operation comes to an end

Faintly, a baby is crying, an ambulance siren is wailing

Smiley seems to have been thinking about something else, looks at him, puzzled

Did they get out
(Beat) No
They were blown
The story is you blew them to save your own skin

Prideaux nods, makes an odd gesture as if he's about to rise, but doesn't move
His expression hasn't changed, but inside him something has just been decided
(') What was your last line of defence
The Mole
Control's crazy theory
was going to bury that so deep, they'd never get it out of me
Which was a joke
Why
Because they already knew
They wanted to know how far Control had got in his investigation
What else
Circus gossip
Was Percy's wife still drinking, who was Bland screwing in the office
That sort of thing
Did they ask about me at all
One of them did
Smiley becomes very still
What did he say about me
He had a cigarette lighter
Kept flashing it round for me to see
Showed me the inscription
"To George, from Ann
All my love

Smiley doesn't flicker

The sound of a door opening and someone being led in

She looks at Prideaux and gives a small polite smile, as though good manners are going to save her

How on earth did Esterhase hear about "Tinker, Tailor

94
(Over headphones) She said there was a General, work-name Polyakov who was stationed in London
And that Polyakov's real job was to service the mole
He meets him regularly and takes back information the Mole gives him for Karla
Smiley presses
He presses -, watches the tape spool
He goes too far, presses -, watches the tape
And, at this moment, we can tell from his expression, a piece of the jig-saw falls into place

Perfectly, Minister

(Calmly) It's Lacon's advice 'm following
(To Lacon) You told me to follow in Control's footsteps
95
(Snapping) Well,  wouldn't consider that sound advice, after the bloody mess Control left us with
It's taken Alleline - and, if  may say so, myself - this long to get us back into the race
'm glad you take some of the credit
Lacon glances sharply at Smiley - there's something different about him, his tone
(') The man Alleline and the others meet is called Polyakov
You believe his role is to bring information from Witchcraft to you
His real role is to receive information from the Mole to take back to Karla
He has the Minister's full attention now

That's
that's not possible
Made possible
By you
When he steals our secrets he does it under the very nose of the Circus, in the house which you persuaded the treasury to pay for
'm sure you'll be able to take full credit for that
(Appalled) Witchcraft's intelligence is genuine
It's been gold
Just enough glitter, amongst the chicken-feed
Control didn't believe in miracles and he didn't believe in Witchcraft
But you were lazy and you were greedy and so you hounded him out of the Circus and you let Karla in
His voice is still calm, but it's clear what's different now
There's a quiet fury in him
The Minister is ashen
96
Oh God
We can't be made to look like fucking fools again
Forget Europe, if we have the black men getting to hear about this on Walla-Wallah News
What if we find the Mole and we move him sideways, some department where he can't do any harm
Is the Kremlin likely to boast about this
Not in their interests sir
They need the Enemy to look like a threat
Well, tell them to play the game
We don't go crowing about their fuck-ups
In their panic, both men are addressing each other, momentarily forgetting Smiley
(Suddenly) We are not the prize
We're the bait
They turn to him
(') You've opened negotiations to exchange intelligence with the Americans
What they tell the Circus, they'll be telling the Kremlin
Witchcraft's information, the "gold" Karla let you have
It wasn't to lure you
It was to lure the Americans
Now, do you want to take credit for that

What can we do
We have one thing the Mole wants

) One's gone
Smiley puts the receiver back on the armchair
He goes to the window in his stockinged feet

The mole is coming

Then the star of light spilling into the darkness from the air vent
236
-   -                     236 Smiley, calm and contained, hears the sound of a drawing up outside
pair of footsteps on the path
Scrape of a key in the door
pale rim of light appears around the kitchen door
And outside the sound of a second cab drawing up
Someone else enters the house
Movement in the kitchen
Two men's voices start to speak in Russian
Smiley gets up,  in one hand, and guided by the line, makes his way through the darkness to the door of the kitchen, groping, rather like a blind man walking towards the light

(
) (In Russian) What is your cover story in case we are disturbed
The sound of  voice answering in Russian from further back in the room
Smiley inching across the room

Tarr can be found and liquidated

He turns, his nerves taut, searching the shadows for movement
For a moment he's certain he's being Then, from the house, the signal he's been waiting for
Three long flashes
Guillam starts to run

He's here

want absolute calm
cab appears and Mendel jumps out
Mendel and Lacon hurry towards the house, Guillam sprinting ahead

The sounds of the house amplified
No one talking
Perhaps the faintest of coughs

Smiley sits in a chair,  in hand
Absurdly, still in his And opposite him sits
They all turn to look at Guillam who stands panting in the doorway
as his nerves and excitement and any hope he might have had of a sense of victory  , leaving him with just an odd sense of embarrassment and shame
243
-                                          243 Nissan huts surround a cricket field
Two cadets run laps
Smiley walks towards one of the huts, stops as Alleline walks out
Alleline, a broken man, can barely look at him
With a nod he walks on
244
-   -                             244 An unshaven, exhausted Haydon stands outside the Sarratt building in a small fenced enclosure
We see Smiley walking towards him
He's brought a box of cigarettes
245
-                                          245 Haydon is weeping quietly but without emotion
Smiley offers Haydon the box of Cigarettes
was assured there would be no coercion
Haydon waves it away
Smiley hands him a clean handkerchief

It's almost funny George
know the Inquisitors little bag of tricks
taught most of them
Don't mind the tears
Just a reaction
An over-reaction, if you like
Craddox says 'll be off in a few days
keep thinking how 'm going to miss the cricket in Moscow
He weeps again
(') rather hoped you would do a little light house-keeping for me
If  can
There's a girl
Would you give her some money for me
Give her a good cover story
If it helps tell her love her
It's all here
Of course
There's a boy too
Bung him a few quid to shut him up
Take it out of the reptile fund
did have one or two questions
About Prideaux
Damn it
got him back, didn't Yes, yes you did
That was good of you
(Beat) 'm surprised Karla didn't shoot him
Or do you think he held back out of delicacy towards you
No response
Smiley looks carefully at Haydon's profile
(') Did Prideaux come and see you before he left on his Hungarian mission
Yes, as a matter of fact he did
111
To say what
Haydon stares at him
For the first time the tears seem real
Guilt and grief
He looks down
long pause
(') (almost to himself) To warn you
Because he knew, deep down, it was you all along
So did you
Haydon stares out, lost in thought
(') had to pick a side George
It was an aesthetic choice as much as a moral one
The West has grown so very ugly, don't you think
Smiley doesn't answer
moment of silence
Did Karla ever consider having you take over the Circus
For a moment Haydon looks rattled
'm not his bloody office boy
What are you then
Haydon turns to Smiley, a flash of hauteur
'm someone who made his mark
Smiley watches him, feeling him shrink in stature before his eyes
Haydon lights a cigarette
(Quietly) Is there anything you want me to pass on to Ann
For a moment Haydon looks genuinely puzzled
Oh, that was nothing personal, George,  hope you understand that
Karla said you were good, the one we had to worry about
But you do have a blind spot
() 112
(') He reckoned if  was known to be Ann's lover you wouldn't be able to see me straight
And he was right, up to a point
Up to a point

'  -                                    246 The flat is now empty, cleared of Control's possessions
Smiley looks around, places a   on the piano
We see the piece bears the name
(Quietly) "Tailor

'  -                                    248 He stops still inside his doorway
The little figure on the console table is in the wrong position
Smiley puts his hand on it, but doesn't right it, listening to something from somewhere inside the house

Through the     we catch a glimpse of a beyond

Smiley stands with his back to us, still in his coat, staring through the door at his wife beyond
Something of a Vermeer in the image
He's absorbing the different atmosphere - home
Deciding whether to go in
Or not
Suddenly we hear  -  , singing a disco version of   - very seventies
: 249
-    -  -               249 The same lively Christmas  at the Circus we saw earlier
, a little drunk and happy, works his way through the packed room, dancing to the Iglesias' track, a drink in each hand, a little tongue-in-cheek, singing along

The  continues as we find
and sitting a little apart, talking
Haydon is still working his way through the party
We    and his
Alleline looking fretful and hoping no-one is noticing the scene she is making
Haydon grins at all his comrades, feeling fond of everyone, but heads on to his destination
sits watching him come with a drink towards him, shakes his head, but can't help but smile fondly at the idiot Haydon is prepared to make of himself

-  -                          254 The music continues as we see two cadets are running on the circuit, their white t-shirts only just visible in the dark
Haydon sits on his bench, smoking, watching them flit by
He smiles to himself, remembering
He senses something, turns and looks back
Prideaux stands in the shadows behind him, some fifteen foot away
The two men stare at each other, then Haydon turns back to watch the runners
We   on his face as Prideaux approaches, the only sound the soft wind and his hushed footsteps growing loser
Finally
(Of the runners) Just like us Jim
(Beat) Best days

rifle is placed on the side of his head - the same execution shot that we saw used on Irina - the force blowing him sideways out of the frame
As the music continues we
: 255
-                                          255 Frost on the grass
We find a  staring down at the corpse of Haydon leaning against the back of the bench, outlined in silver frost
The music ends

'  -                                256 Prideaux sits on his bed
From outside - the sound of a football game
Someone taps on the door
Low
Taps again
Prideaux, coiled with grief and anger, suddenly gets up
257
'  -                                257 Roach stands in the doorway, carrying a gift - a boot- scrape made in woodwork
made you something
Prideaux stares at the boot scrape
don't want you hanging around here
Keep away from me from now on
Go and join the others
Roach stands frozen
(') Just bloody join in
Go and play damn you
He watches Roach walk to the edge of the field and stand mutely at the side
ball rolls towards him
Roach goes to kick it
Misses
He tries again,

He stops to light a cigarette
woman in a  dress appears, reflected in the glass
She's holding the hands of two children
For a moment it looks like Irina

Tarr spins round, but the woman has disappeared
He stares after her, hoping to catch a glimpse of her again

He examines the   in his hand
We see it is labelled
He toys with it for a moment, then places it on the table in front of him, clears his throat
Shall we begin
Through the open door Smiley's new inner circle begin to enter and take their place at the table around him
