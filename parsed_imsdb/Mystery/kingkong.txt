Seven years ago, me and Mr Hayes - we were working our passage on a Norwegian barque
We picked up a castaway - found him in the water - he'd been drifting for days
His ship had run aground on an island, way West of Sumatra
An island hidden in fog
He spoke of a huge wall, built so long ago - no one knew who had made it
wall a hundred foot high
as strong today as it was, ages ago
Why did they build the wall

The castaway - he spoke of a creature, neither beast nor man, but something monstrous, living behind that wall
