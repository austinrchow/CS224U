(

There's no way
Sand dunes stretch to the horizon
Nowhere to run

Then a second

The other like

You the best

Mid 30's, black and solid
Eagle tattoo on right bicep, his    '  tattooed on his left
Currently mock offended
: The Pooch don't cheat
The Pooch may lie, the Pooch may steal-- 2
--the Pooch may refer to himself in the third person-- --but the Pooch will not cheat
The Pooch can rest easy,  was referring to Cougar

He doesn't say or move much
Ain't no rattling him

as he asks the question and   : Roque
30's
Close cropped black hair
If Lance Armstrong bred with Darth Vader
Doesn't smile much, but he's smiling now
The four are in -- Open air, the guys sit in the back
In the middle of the desert with nothing to do but wait
Roque holds the deck
Cards
The four take them
Lick the back, slap them to their foreheads -- two deuces (Jensen and Roque), a three (Pooch), and an eight (Cougar)
Pitiful cards
Got a feeling about this one, Roque
Your mama had that feeling too
At which point,
and tosses it into the center of the circle
Roque responds by tossing a
357  from his belt in

(') Raise you
() That the one with the hollow points
Yup
Oh, shit, 'm definitely in then
He puts in a Desert Eagle
Jensen pulls a second, meaner looking knife
Twirling it
This even me up
Exactly how many knives do you have, anyway
Jensen grins and   down into the pot
Cougar - your bet
The Silent Man stares at the others
Two deuces and a three
He shakes his head at them
Before he can bet
(
) Hey, losers
to Clay
Mid-30's
Their leader, and you gotta be a bad- ass to lead this crew
Tired eyes
weariness to him already
And hands faster than you can imagine
It's time
: () -- Pooch drives, Clay shotgun, others in the back
Passing a   to Jensen: 4
Authenticate and backtrace
() Send us out to the middle of nowhere to "wait for instructions"
( ) We're good, this baby came out of the Kandahar Spook Station, controller's codename is Max
He hands the tablet back
() This is an Agency gig
We don't get to pick what needs to be done
(reading from tablet) Quaeda-wannabe name of Fadhil is running a terrorist assembly line out around the Khyber Pass-- 'm shocked
Shocked,  say
We find it, we paint it for a laser targeted bomb
No muss, no fuss
For that we had to put on a blindfold and turn around three times
You'd rather take on fifty mujas with 's
He upshifts a gear as the Humvee drives on
: -- terrorist looking fellow talks with another
We are

-- Our guys, now in full on Black Ops Special Forces combat desert fatigues, perched high above what looks like a Roque with the field glasses: got eyes on Fadhil
Paint it
Pooch fires up the   and aims it at the compound
high pitched whine as he does
Call me Michelangelo
Cougar sights down the   of his
Just taking in the scenery
Jensen, into a field radio: Dropkick, this is Pinball, confirmed eyes on, target is designated
-- , enroute to target
(
) () Roger, target acquired, exfil chopper is enroute
to fireworks is eight minutes
-- Roger, we'll break out the earplugs
(to the others) So who wants to get a game
We got eight minutes- And then, for the first time
With concern: Boss
Clay immediately looks    -- 6
- on the ground   , being led off a truck
The others look too
Reacting: Call it in
( ) Dropkick, children are at target site, repeat, we have eyes on children at target site - advise
(
) Hold the line
Seconds tick by
(
) (') Acknowledged, maintain position
Maintain position
Colonel- ( ) Dropkick, we strongly recommend cancellation of payload delivery- (
) Abort order can only come from - Clay    from Jensen: Mission Controller is Agency, Codename Max, repeat, Codename Max, so get him on the horn and- (
) Already have, Pinball, your orders stand
Prep for exfil

The others stare at Clay
Cougar
Cougar takes the butt of his rifle and Clay, into the radio: 7
(') Dropkick, this is Pinball, targeting equipment has suffered system failure, am calling an abort
Then, a  : (
) Well, that was stupid
The voice is even
Distinctly unmilitary
Almost stoned
Who is this
This is a secure -- (
) Very stupid, Colonel
Franklin
Clay
Clay blinks - no one uses names on comms
Max
There are children on site- (
) And you think  didn't know that
Not the sharpest of knives in the drawer, are you
We locked coordinates the moment you painted; delivery will occur on schedule
Max out
Clay hits the send button to respond - gets a Cursing, tossing the radio to Jensen: Shit
Jensen, call the General at the Firebase, get him to abort- Can't, they're jamming us- Then contact the plane directly- (trying all channels) Negative, we're screwed
( ) There's nothing we can do
8
His face, stricken
They all are
And then: There's something we can do
Clay hefts his rifle
The others stare at him
Automatically begin checking their own weapons
Roque runs it down for them: Five against a fortress, and we've got maybe six minutes before an airstrike sets the world on fire
So
So, 'll drive
: -- firing wildly as our guys' through the
guess we're going with the fifty mujas with 's option after all
-- We see just how good these guys are
Cougar on his knee in the back -- snipes    -- takes out
Roque pulls to a halt in the center of the compound -- Bad Guys, coming out of the woodwork with
As the guys hop out: Pooch and Jensen, get a truck for the kids, the rest of us will be out in five- ( ) -airstrike's in four and change- -out in four
On me

Clay leads   toward the building -- Roque and Cougar run middle --
Images fast and savage as these men
-   - Roque calmly kicks in the door -- kills   sitting around a table with    in the middle -- the terrified girls run to him
The   have no chance -- Fast
Precise
Our crew takes the fort
a tight hallway, they find the children locked in a large empty room
They start leading them out
One   stops Clay
In : Clay checks the time
3
(to Roque and Cougar) Get 'em out
Roque and Cougar hustle the kids toward the exit while Clay moves  into the darker sublevels
--   -- Clay kicks in a door to find   - Looming over a Unbuckling his pants
The Man pales
Realizing the American understands what he was about to do, backing away,   : Omar '
Instead, he eerily raises his hand and wordlessly
In the corner
And Clay hears a  emit from it
Omar lowers his arm
Goes upstairs, dragging his bear
10
Clay turns
Approaches the cell
Looks down into it
it's clear from Clay's face that it's
shooooot meeee
You're American
Max sent you
() How do you know that name
was  Field Ops hunting rogue agents
Max caught me
He torture rasps and spits small chunks of death
Max is rogue
Something Horrific leans forward out of the shadows
You're off-mission aren't you
Clay just stares
(') What's the mission
Fadhil
Max doesn't care about Fadhil
He's cleaning up the mess
You're his mop
'm the mission
Clay's just staring into the burning, crazed eyes of Something Horrific
(') Kill me
can get you out- 11
Already dead
Kill - pierces what used to be left of Something Horrific's
Not fired by Clay
(') Thaaaank
And he dies
Clay turns -
Lowers his rifle
Speaks one word
Mercy
Holds up his watch
40
Speaks another: (') Run
-- Clay and Cougar  from the fort,  and towards the commandeered
As they leap into the back, Pooch hits the gas: Jesus, you stop for coffee in there
As he   two Bad Guys trying to stop them at the gate
The sound of a
Roque to Jensen: What kind of blast radius we looking at
Jensen, calculating on the computer tablet
Shows an animation mock-up to Roque - huge blast radius
To Pooch: (') -- The Fort and the retreating Truck below us mere specks as the     and
moment of silence as it falls
and then  below, an orange
12
() -- Ripping across the dunes,   behind them
think we're in the clear- As the fireball
() -- : All Pooch can see is through the  as they plow through the destruction
Glances in the -: Uh, Coug
Cougar's sleeve,
He casually rips it off and tosses it out the back
- The fire clears
to reveal a 30
The guys scream as they
The Truck buries itself nose first in the sand
-- Silence
Smoke rises from a crater that was once the Fort
The doors of the truck creak open
Most of the Fun ride
As the guys help them out: Yeah, that was great, wasn't it
My favorite part was when we were completely on fire
What was yours
Sounds of a
Exfil incoming
How are we gonna explain the kids, Colonel
Clay doesn't seem to hear him
(') Colonel
(Clay looks up) The kids
What do we tell 'em

beat
Clay seems to shake off his daze as the sets down
Walking up to the chopper: Lieutenant, you're to evac these civvies to the Firebase immediately- Negative, our orders are to transport a five-man team only
Clay's eyes dart down to the Pilot's neck hangs around it
Clay, softer: You really want to leave twenty three kids in the desert to die
beat
Not enough room for them and you
Then it's them
The Pilot nods
Our guys begin loading the kids on
Clay helps Omar on last
The kid looks at him
He knows perfectly well what Clay saved him from in that basement
Clay nods
beat
The Pilot pulls the stick back and the
The kids wave goodbye to our guys
Omar, holding Clay's gaze as they rise
Only broken as the chopper begins to recede into the distance
The last Clay sees of him is that ratty little
Cute little buggers
Hope they can make it to our court-martial
14
Relax, Pooch, we're not going to be court-martialed - if anything, we're going to die of thirst wandering the desert, right Colonel
( ) Jensen, see if you can cut into that Blackhawk's chatter-- want to know if he rats us out
As Jensen tunes his radio
So, how we getting back
Hitchhike
Magic carpet
say magic carpet
() Guess they hustled up some air support after all - that's a Pakistani MiG up there
Jensen's tuning into the 's frequency
Looking nervous
Guys
This is bad
: (
) Max, Cobra One
Bandit locked, twelve o'clock low
Their eyes go wide with understanding
(
) Understood, Cobra One
Kill Bandit
Clay and Cougar have    towards the receding chopper on the horizon
As the (

The Blackhawk's tail rotor  , the chopper spinning and falling but still intact

Burning, spinning

Clay tries to dive into the flames, but
No use, anyway
Nothing's alive inside

" He set up the Operation- There was no operation
You were never radioed orders
talked to him
16
You kill a friendly Afghan warlord, probably lose us the support of half the tribes in the region, and your alibi is "
" () Wait - are you saying you're Max
What
Colonel, Max is an Agency code for a rogue agent or operation- What are you talking- (
) There is no specific Max
The   finally steps out of the shadows
Special Forces, like our guys
They know him
"Max" is catch-all for exactly what you've been accused of
Terminology's been around since the 50's
Silence as the guys take this in
We didn't kill those kids, Wade
Wade studies him
Finally: believe you
Fennel sighs
Stay here
We'll be back
They watch Wade and Fennel leave
Now alone
After a bit, Pooch looks down
Under a little table
Wade left his suitcase
17
It hits them all at the same time
Ah, shit
They  for the door
Run to the window
and it has
(nodding to the case) Jensen
'm not good with bombs, man- don't care--Roque, Pooch, get those bars off
Roque and Pooch - attachments, slotting them into the  that hold the barred   in place
Jensen   the briefcase
Wires and dials aplenty
Oh, shit
Oh, shit

First set of screws out, moving onto the second
It's a remote detonator--enough for them to get clear, maybe ten - - told you, 'm not good with bombs
How are those bars coming

Shut up
Hurry
Shut up
Third set out, ripping the frame from the window

Debris flying far enough to shower the open air bazaar being held two blocks East

Tears in their eyes

Clay's got , following the action on the track -- Muscle shredded greyhounds tearing over the dirt
One crosses the Roque checks their ticket
Yawns
() You lost again
We lost again
Clay's got the binoculars up, slow-checking the track
You placed the bet
You gave me the money
20
Well, that was stupid of me, wasn't it
Clay drums his fingers along the binocs as he scans
We see on his right hand, between his thumb and index finger - Looks just like Omar's
(') That makes, what, three in a row
Four
Something glint-flashes
catches Clay's eye
He looks across the track, towards the
You know where you're messing up
You're putting all our money on the dogs with the best odds
Yeah, 've just gone crazy with that approach
--    in tight jeans walks towards a black pick up, carrying a
Never play a longshot, you're never gonna win
Clay doesn't respond
Watching her
Roque exhales
(') We're at a dogtrack at 10 a

- could this get any more sleazy
Maybe if we were drinking
Roque takes a pull on his straw
You're not drinking
-- '   -- Clay and Roque wolf Big Macs in a 1988 Chevy Crew Cab

play like hamsters in tubes
21
We'll stay two more days, try to get some of the cash back
Then what
Miami
Jai-Alai
Various  walk to and from their cars
Clay and Roque shield their faces from them instinctually
can't take much more of this
We're on the run
It occasionally - 'm serious
Grinding out lunch money on five dollar sports bets, wincing everytime some overly Aqua- netted cow stares at my face for more than two seconds- () 'm at the point where 'm thinking we ought to try to reach out to the Company
All we did was say the word "Max" and they blew up a building even gets a whiff of where we're at, they'll call in an airstrike
(shakes his head) Until we figure out how we can take Max down and get clear, we lay low
Metro Dade   rolls into the McDonald's
Clay watches close as it pulls into a parking spot
Due respect, you're nobody's Colonel anymore
Anytime you want to move along you go right ahead- 22
Like the others
Least  still talk to them
You pushed them away
"Max this, Max that" - we never even saw the guy, Clay- We heard his voice
Guy with a voice is a guy with a throat
And if he's got a throat
( ) We're hiding out in the parking lot of a goddamn McDonald's--You actually think we're in any position to take on some shadowy  super- spook
- No, it's a stellar plan - we can use this as our base of ops
(gestures to the ) Pooch can run the motor pool out of the ball pit and Jensen can set up communications by the slide
Clay, seeing one of the  say something to the other
Go
Roque     as the  get out of the cruiser
Pulling smoothly into the street
-- Roque pulls up to their shitbeater Motel
Tension still between them
He gets out, turning back to his friend: was there too
remember
But he won
We lost
() Maybe it's time for a new game
23
With that, Roque heads to the Motel
Clay looks down at his quarter eaten burger
He needs some real food
'  & Clay at the bar, eating a steak and drinking alone
Honky- tonk on the juke, mix of sawdust and blood on the floor
enters - she's hot, feels familiar
Clay eyes her as she orders a drink, dodges several
Yabba Dabba Doo
She catches Clay's eye
Rolls her eyes
Clay's paying more attention to his -Bone than the girl
She slides up next to him
Her name's
Men
Clay turns back to his food
Not used to attractive women instigating conversation
Aisha watches as Clay eats
(') How's the steak
Meaty
She's still watching him
It's getting annoying
(') Want a bite
don't eat red meat
Why not
Slows me down
Okay
Aisha studies Clay
If we've been paying close attention, we might  her as the race track binocular chick
We're not sure if Clay does
24
You got nice arms
(turning to her) know you
Relax, slugger
like arms
That's all
Do  not look relaxed
No
() Think we can change that
: ,
-    - Clay and Aisha enter his motel room
Aisha checks out the sparse accommodations
() Wow, it's everything a girl could dream of
Got a bathroom
No,  specifically requested the only hotel room in the world that doesn't have a bathroom
You lookin' to turn a "yes" into a "no" here
Clay points to the bathroom
,  -   -  / Aisha checks herself in the mirror
touch of lip gloss
So what brings you to Florida
Clay
Leans over - stretching his hamstrings
Does a few subtle twists - Loosening up
25
Convention
(
) Convention for what
Shit
Clay looks around
Weakly: Air conditioners
- Aisha studies herself in the mirror
Stretching her arms, prepping for some physical activity
They have whole conventions devoted to air conditioners
You'd be surprised
Aisha comes back out
Both now stretched and loose
Bet  would
Where were we
They study each other
Aisha slowly moves towards Clay
You were about to tell me how much you enjoy spending time at the dog track
Aisha smiles, tracing her fingers down his stomach
Saw me there did you
Clay strokes her cheek
Uh-huh
Didn't see me at the McDonald's though
Their lips, inches from touching
26
(') have a proposition for you
Clay
She   --   up and out and -- Clay ducks left --   with his forearm -- sends her  across the room --
Both breathing hard
Staring at one another: (') Just hear me out
don't want to hurt you
You're not going to
Yes,  am
He foot-plants, spins, re-attacks and : tearing the room to utter shreds
Fists , plaster
She  a twenty six inch color  at him
This  against a wall
Sparks give to flame as the room starts to burn hot around these two warriors
They continue to fight like

Noticed
What do you want
Your life
Back
Clay spits blood and sucks air
You want to clarify that
Max
can help you
27
This clearly has effect on Clay - Substantial Effect
Clay stares up at Aisha
'm listening
,   -- Clay and Aisha walk away from the
How'd you find me
It's not too tough if you know where to look
You guys aren't exactly subtle
screams past them towards the burning hotel, as if to illustrate her point
How'd you know  was alive
Counted the number of teeth found in the safehouse debris in Karachi
Not nearly enough for five men
Who else knows
That you're alive
Just me
So what's to stop me from putting a bullet in your head
You want Max and  can tell you how to get him
Max is up to something big, isn't he
Agency wouldn't have sent you otherwise
She gives a little smile
28
Nice try, but 'm working alone here
If  wasn't,  wouldn't need your help
Ready for the important part
Clay nods
(') There is a plane
Okay
This plane contains a truck
Okay
This truck contains a cargo
Right
This cargo is very important
Is this a riddle
( ) This cargo belongs to Max
You steal the cargo, Max comes looking for it, you grab Max
What a brilliant plan, and oh, so simple too
What's the cargo
Aisha just smiles
(') Right
So you want me to steal some super secret cargo known only to you and the bad guy, and 'm supposed to do this because you know the name Max and look good in a pair of jeans
Sorry, sister
29
He turns
Begins walking away
She calls out after him
Hey
(he turns back) You really think  look good in these jeans
Bye
Cargo's heroin
Max uses it to fund his off the books ops
And it comes straight from the poppy fields of the late Jamal al-Fadhil
(knowing full well) Oh
does that name mean something to you
beat as Clay stares at her, realizing
(') He used you to kill Fadhil and take over his operation, that's right
What did you think you were doing there in the first place
Fighting for truth and justice
Clay stares at her
How do  know  can trust you

We're not mercenaries

You're not gonna get another
You want Max, this is it
He takes it
She hands him some papers along with it

You know we cannot do this
We cannot do what you ask
Tell me - is this a moral issue or a financial issue
moral issue
( ) Really
You object morally to this deal
Yes
'm sorry
Please leave
Max takes a moment
Thinks
Okay, here's what 'm hearing
'm hearing "No
" 'm hearing "Leave," and 'm hearing "'m sorry
" Is that what 'm hearing
Please
you must leave
Max nods to himself
He thought so
Right
Okay, so that is what 'm hearing
Now,  want you to listen
Listen carefully because  want you to hear this
Wade

Wade hauls him up the
Without hesitation, he walks him over to the large glass window looking down above Delhi and
through the glass
As the poor bastard The other scientists scream at the sight
Max turns to Wade, bewildered: (') What the hell was that
You gave me the nod
"hit him in the face" nod, not a "throw him out the window" nod
thought that's what you wanted
At most--at most that was a "break his fingers" nod
(slams his fist) mean Jesus, Wade, the man was scientific genius
Granted his weight signaled that he had certain impulse control issues, but that's no reason to throw his fat ass out a fifty story window
Sorry
(as if to a child) think  speak for everyone here when  say that your actions were excessive and, yes, more than just a little wasteful
Max looks over at the cowering scientists
(') then again, it seemed to have had the desired effect - toss Short Round out next
Wade starts for the Short Scientist
33
Wait
Wade stops
(') We have a different moral perspective than our late colleague
The hell you say

One to test
Of course one to test - you think trust you
We will need much money
You will have much money
Max and Wade are up and out

Clay and Roque take a look around it

When you slip, it's always cause of a woman
Name one time that- () Carla
Carla wasn't the problem, Carla's husband was the problem- Carla's husband wasn't the one who - Okay
Yes
She shot me

What about Emma
Emma doesn't count, we never slept together
Because she put a bomb in your car
admit, that took some of the romance out of the relationship
35
And now this chick, first time you meet her, burns down our hotel
Also, she kills people for a living
These are not good signs

(looks up at them) "Codename: "
moment as this sinks in
They want to wet her cause she's lookin' into Max
That sounds familiar
() Could those files- (finishing his question) -have been planted for us to find
(shaking his head) timestamp, digital watermark
Someone would've had to go to a lot of trouble, and  mean a lot, to fool me
Clay nods
Looks to the others
say we go with her
Pooch

Pooch nodding: 'm in
Jensen

Hell yeah
Cougs
Cougar nods his assent
Only one left
They all turn to him

For now
Jensen smacks his fist on the table, excited: Hot damn
Back with the Colonel, doing another bid for God and - Country turned her back on us, and God can screw
This one's for us
And anyone who calls me "Colonel" better be ready to take a beating or an order
We ain't soldiers anymore
( ) So what's the plan, my civilian brothers
Sleep
We start tomorrow
Start where
We're going bird hunting
: -    - White Bell -139  glides into frame -- over a small series of white sanded jungle islands
(
) It used to be so simple
post 9/11 world
39
: taunt-scream up as the chopper slow-circles over the beautiful deserted island
Outer Fijian Islands
(
) (') As a country we spoke with one voice, moved with one purpose
We had a wicked boner for doing the right thing, and now look at us
-139 - Max wearing a Hawaiian shirt and Raybans
on his nose, rubbing suntan lotion on his forearms
To Wade: 90 percent of the globe is tooling up to whack us and we're too busy losing our nerve to notice
It's Us versus Them and right now my money would be on them
out of the chopper -- low --   a howler monkey up a   -- Then airborne as the monkey leaps twenty feet to another
(
) (') Wasn't it Thomas Jefferson who once said the tree of freedom must be watered with etcetera, etcetera
We need to wake people up, Wade
We need to hit them in the face, angry up the blood, give them their balls back
We   our lead monkey up to something very un- monkey like
Something
metallic, trunk- like object
Flashing lights and transponder devices
(') We need to give them a ten megaton reality check
(ala John Lee Hooker) Boom Boom Boom Boom
half-millisecond breath
Then,
-- Trees, earth, water are sucked in then --   in a series of and fire balls

, as the chopper shudders from the blast
When the   clears
Stunned silence in the chopper
Then Max whoops like a 10 year old who's just seen the world's best fireworks show
(') think it's safe to say it works
Wade, not quite as enthused
Max notices
His face falls
(') Jeez, talk about hard to impress
-- Max and Wade, stepping off the chopper as it powers down
Max walks towards his office
Wade, calling after him: The Company's with you on this
Kinda
Sorta
Wade raises an eyebrow
(') You know the drill, they don't like to know how the sausages get made
What do you care
don't
Just want to make sure everyone gets paid
The money's coming from our Afghanistan operation
And what the Company doesn't know won't hurt them
Unless they're within the blast radius
Max puts his hand on Wade's shoulder
Earnestly: 41
We're gonna saving our country, Wade
The United States of America will benefit greatly from what we're doing
was born in Quebec
Jesus, fine - we're saving North America, does that make you happy
Just get it done
Max stalks away

Takes a breath, centers himself, then
Base One, this is Cavalier 415
We have been in a collision with a civilian vehicle
Carvey's dead an' Freeman's hurt bad
He's messed up his neck
He can't move
Oh god, it's horrible
We need medevac immediate

(
) Roger, Cavalier 415
We're scrambling a chopper, hang in there
Jensen, all smiles, looks up at Clay
Robert De Niro who
Pooch and Roque have the four drugged soldiers laid out on the sand
All four are clearly breathing
Sleeping like babies
What about their ride
Clay steps off the trailer with a heavy duty air hoist
Flip it
of the air ram attached to the undercarriage of the Humvee
The tires start to lift off the ground
higher
Four pairs of hands start rocking the truck
Pooch and Jensen, on one side
Quietly: What do you think's up with that "don't call me Colonel" stuff
Classic loss of identity
Clay defined himself by his place in the military structure
() 44
(') It was his way of measuring the good he did in the world
Without it, he's just another loser like the rest of us
Pooch blinks, impressed
Then: (') You know there's a website where you can download MP3's of donkeys farting
How cool is that
and the Humvee
' : (
) Cavalier 415 this is Medevac Delta
Be advised, we are airborne and in- bound to your position
All right, everyone get into character
: Jensen and Roque     by the flipped Humvee
Lot of work to bum a ride
Shut up, Jensen
You shut up, Roque
You're dead, 'm the spinal injury - Spinal injury can talk, dead can't
Stop talking or 'll break your neck for real
Seriously, you have to get more into your role
Dead guy
No talking
Dead guy
Clay leans against the truck
In the distance, the faint outline of a massive

Here we go

We have visual on Cavalier 415

It lands on the road EMTs leap out and race towards the fallen soldiers
The first  kneels by Jensen
Alright buddy, we're gonna get you patched up in no time
-you ever treat anyone who'd been gut shot
Sure, in Iraq
What a mess
Jensen pulls his , presses it up into the 's
Means you know what's coming to you if try to play hero
Now, lose the radio mic, Bones
- The two pilots wait behind full reflective face shields What are they jawing about out there
We're burning fuel-- -
The pilots turn as    jam up on them from out of the darkness
Pooch and Cougar
You heard of car-jacked
You've just been chopper-jacked, my man
46
You're robbing the  Army

The Pilots slump
Pooch, to Cougar: When he says it out loud, it does sound kinda ridiculous
Clay pops his head in: Where's my wild goose
Pooch reaches in and rips the chopper's

The transponder takes off
Beautiful
Let 'em chase that

) Medevac Delta, this is Base One
What's your situation, over
Pooch gets up behind the wheel
Time to move
The team gets into the big double cab
Pooch fires up the engine and the heave rig tears out onto the highway
'  -- On one of the drugged soldiers
Trying to sit up
He looks around
: Seven soldiers out cold on the side of the road
Alone
47
Well, shit
-- Our guys are prepping
Pooch and Clay check out maps
Cougar, in full face mask, spray paints something big
no, what you want is a gas turbine generator running a force- fed rectifier unit, hook it up to the fuel tank
Aisha sits, watching in silence
Jensen approaches her
So, you grew up in the Hindu Kush, huh
That must've been rough
(watching the chopper) Uh-huh
Got any hobbies
Aisha, never taking her eyes off the chopper: When  was a girl,  collected human ears
had over three dozen pairs when a feral dog came into our camp one night and took them
The dog was good eating, though
beat
'm gonna go somewhere else now
He departs
Aisha stands, walking over to the chopper
Are small arms gonna be a problem
Clay and Pooch look at the new girl
It's taken care of - we lined the hull with half inch steel plate
48
Roque steps forward
Which brings us to our next question
He  a   and   at Aisha's skull
(') What's your angle in this
Aisha just smiles
Clay, more annoyed than worried: Roque
'm giving you a chance to get even
That's all you need to know
Roque stares at Aisha
Neither backing down
'm gonna shoot her, Clay
No, you're not
Yes,  am
No
Right now
He thumbs back the hammer
And then Roque lowers the gun
See
She's coming with us
And if anything feels like a set-up, put a bullet in her skull
( ) Sound fair
49
Oh, completely
Now, if you'll excuse me, it's time for prayers
You're Muslim
You know, you are a sharp one--and don't let any of these other boys tell you different
With that, she turns and walks away into the shadows
Roque lowers the weapon
beat
To Clay: don't like this
picked up on that
'm with Roque, man
Agency thinks we're dead
We show up alive and kickin', start waving our dicks around in public, they're gonna make it their business to bury us
They'll call us terrorists, all - What do you think we are now
(to all of them) Best case scenario, this gets us face to face with Max- What if it doesn't
What if we never get face to face with him
Are you gonna be able to live with that
Ever
Clay doesn't reply
pall, cast over the guys
Finally: Hell, let's just say it out loud
() We do this, we're declaring war on the Central Intelligence Agency
Silence, as the guys take this in

Fennel blinks, surprised to see him alive
Nevertheless: 56
Eat the ground, or they blow your head off
don't think so
First and only warning, Clay
Clay calmly : The soldiers, wide eyed
Gasoline
Muzzle flash
Think about it

Now, let's see what kind of cargo you got in there
Clay, no bullshit - you open that box and we all die
Clay steps up to him
Near nose to nose

Knocking him cold

It must be how he moves the drugs
Great
The super evil bad guy is in bed with the world's largest oil company
That's just fabulous
Pooch hefts a tire iron
Smacking it into his palm
You want me to go ask Fennel the combination
Nah,  can bypass no problem

You ever hear of a clock radio that exploded cause you unplugged it--pull out all the wires
With no other options
The clock,  : 3, 2, 1

Then
Opening it without the code must have triggered the timer

And then Roque
Levelling it at Aisha: Did you know
just saved our lives- ( ) Did you know
61
Of course not
Clay  , stalking towards the Chinook
() Where the hell are you- Fennel
--   -- The Losers stand around Fennel, who's been
Urine stain on his pants
Sniveling, spilling his guts rapidly: Max thinks the country's lost it's way, gone soft in the War on Terror
This is his solution
Clay    to his temple
Elaborate
He wanted us to nuke a
target, pin it on the ragheads and boom - freedom is on the march again
The same people who want us to pull back will be screaming to turn the place into a parking lot
What was the target
'- Clay  -   Fennel's
Fennel (') The Mall of America

They stare down at him in disbelief

It's his sense of humor
He told us we could choose between there and Epcot Center

() Holy shit, it's like we were framed by Dr
No
What about Goliath
Yeah, what would an oil company want with the Middle East
( ) The ships that service their offshore oil rigs are exempt from Customs
It's how Max gets the drugs in and out of the country- This is conspiracy theory bullshit- It's not
There's proof
Where
Max's heroin operation - Goliath keeps accounts of the shipments
Come on, dude, they'd be morons to keep records of shit like this- It's on a stand-alone hard drive
It's their insurance policy against Max - they know he's crazy, this way they have something on him
63
So this hard drive - it contains evidence of what Max has been doing
Yes
Our guys exchange looks
Can you get us this drive
Fennel goes even paler
don't know where it is
They don't let me have access
But- Fennel goes pale when he sees Clay   : (') No, wait
Please don't kill- Clay plasters   over Fennel's mouth
Stepping outside the Chinook
The others, going with him
-- The Warhead, still sitting there
Nobody speaks for a bit
Then: say we hit Goliath headquarters
And do what - go after this non- existent hard drive
We find out if it exists
If it does, we steal it and trade it for immunity
Roque stares at him
That's your plan
You got a better one
() 64
(') Max gives us back our lives or we upload the data to the net, show the American people what's being done in their names
Why risk our lives again when we already have something to trade
He gestures to the
Clay, shocked
You want to give it back to him
want to at least discuss it before signing up for another suicide mission on the say-so of some flunky- It's not happening
Roque blinks at Clay's abruptness
Pissed
So you want to take down Goliath now
Then who
McDonald's
American Airlines
Microsoft
You don't want Max to pay
want my life back
This is supposed to be us getting clear - not saving the world
- We're not the goddamn good guys anymore
love you guys, but had a life before this shit, and sure as hell am not going to risk getting it back because you came down with a case of the Dudley Damn Do-Rights
65
Don't raise your voice at me- will raise whatever the hell want - you got a death wish because you got beat by a voice on a radio- Clay throws a   to Roque's jaw
Roque, surprised and staggered by the blow
Then he through the blood,   : (') 'm gonna cut your head off
This got serious quick
Pooch steps between them

You want your life back, you're gonna have to steal it
We hit them in two days

Don'tcha hate it when Mom and Dad fight
Cougar grunts in response

agree
Now that we know each other, know, please, that if you come near me with any more of that Yankee Doodle tough guy bullshit, you will be fed to my dogs
Small smile from Wade
Fair enough, Doc
Can we now move past the verbal aggression and get into some business
You want another device
One billion dollars is now the price
One billion dollars cash
Wade stares at the scientist
That's going to be difficult
Life the way you people want to live it is very difficult, Mr
Wade
You want less difficult move to my country, study Hinduism
Meditate
Cultivate serenity
Much less difficult
You want to buy atomic bombs

Change of plans

Kill them
Or fire them, whichever's easier
Honestly
Firing them
Fine, fine, 'm not a detail guy
What  need- wait
Did you give them intel on Clay's people
Well, yeah
Aaaand we're back to killing them

Touchy, touchy
Jeez, what are you related to them
Actually, one of them, yes

After
Looking out at the city
So, what really happened to you in Afghanistan
Clay looks over at her
Down at the   tattoo
And shakes his head

She traces her fingers over it

Aisha, taken aback by the suddenness of the question
He's a bad man
Isn't that enough
No

She looks at him
When you tell me about Afghanistan
'll tell you about Max
Fine
It's hot
There's lots of sand
Your turn
Aisha smiles at this
Shaking her head
Why were you alone when  found you
That takes Clay off guard
Looking out at the city
The guys got sick of it
Sick of what
73
Of hearing about Max
Of hearing me say we had to do something when there wasn't anything to do
They wanted to be around their families
Jensen has a sister
Pooch has a wife and daughters
And he hasn't told them he is alive
Would you
The people you loved the most, would you put them in that kind of danger
Aisha, side-stepping the question: So Roque has no one
He's got me
And you have
Enough hate to get us both through the day
He stuck with me when no one else would
And  ain't the easiest guy to stick with
Aisha studies him
If you two really fought, he would kill you,  think
You think
'm almost sure of it
Why
74
Because you care what happens to the others
You wouldn't put them at risk to save yourself
And you think that's a weakness

There's something in his voice

() Okay
Put a fire team together
You're sure
You're not going to call me in two hours and have me kill them

: -- The team gathers around as Jensen downloads the Goliath security specs off his computer
Everything on Goliath - security, personnel history, the works
Aisha's brow furrows at this
Only we notice
Where's the drive being kept
Jensen spins the laptop around to show them Port of New York, baby
Total stand alone facility, and they're spending 30K a day on onsite security - you don't drop that kinda green to just guard oil
83
What are we up against
Jensen, typing: Let me check, --oh, shit
What's "oh, shit"
Jensen looks up at them
Softly: They've hired Par-Sec

This clearly means something bad to all of them
() Oh, shit
Who's Par-Sec
Paradigm Security Services
Ex- Special Forces
Basically guys like Cougar but without the warm and cuddly side
Cougar just glowers
Goliath must have brought them in after we hit their truck
Silence as they ponder the significance of a Par Sec security force
Our drive is being guarded by military trained, trigger repressed, blood thirsty, stone cold killers
Am  the only one who's thinking maybe we just chill out and go to Six Flags
Silence

Comb that drive for every last scrap of info
We're on a plane for New York tomorrow

Knock at the door again
Aisha again
Oh, hi
She covers his mouth with hers
- Jensen and Pooch sitting at a table
Both with laptops
Jensen tapping his keys
Roque enters, carrying a coffee
Stops short, seeing the others
Surprised
Thought you guys'd be back at the hotel
Couldn't sleep
Me neither
Grabbed a coffee from the machine - you want one
He slides into a chair
No thanks
You won't believe how detailed these files are
Every Goliath executive they've ever insured, their policies, their payouts- Life insurance
Yeah
What's the biggest payout
85
( ) Gotta be wrongful death
Pretty much what we're gonna be risking
( ) What are you doing up
Jensen hacked a satellite for me earlier
The hell you need a satellite for
Pooch shows him the screen of his computer - from earlier in the day

They both watch for a bit
The only sound, Jensen's typing
Then: When we first went over in 2001, Jolene and my oldest Tina wanted to do the yellow ribbon thing, right
Only problem was there was no yellow ribbon to be found - all the stores had been cleaned out
Military neighborhood
No doubt
And Tina's four at the time, and what she can't understand is why the ribbon's gotta be yellow
So Jolene sings her the song, right
To show her where the idea comes from
And when she's all done, Tina, four years old, looks my wife dead in her eye and says "that's the dumbest song  ever heard
" () So my wife and my four year old ended up tying a frilly purple ribbon round the old oak tree in our yard to bring Daddy home
86
() Thought that counts, right
Yeah
: (') Jolene dated a guy last summer
Didn't turn into anything and sure as hell can't blame her, but that man was in my house, Roque
know you're not a hundred percent on this op, but if it can get me back to them
hear you, man
moment between them
Broken by: () Okay, biggest payout on a Goliath exec ever - 14 million and it was wrongful death - Vice President of Operations in Afghanistan, three years ago, paid to his daughter
Looking to Pooch and Roque: (') We're going to need to drive fast

She traces her fingers along his Teddy Bear tattoo
Clay looks down at her
She gives him a smile
Mixing just the right amount of sensitivity and curiosity
You really want to know about Afghanistan

You think she's gonna kill him
(various versions of) Uh-uh
No way
Yeah,  think so too
- And this man you found in the basement - he was your true target
Max's true target
Yeah
And you spoke with him
He knew we were off mission
He knew Max wanted him dead
Did he beg
Clay blinks
Excuse me
The man in the basement
Did he beg for his life
He begged to die--why are you asking me this
Aisha smiles, trying to recover but -- The door   and -- Freeze

Roque and Pooch behind him,
Aisha's hand dips into her purse and comes up with a  faster than you can spit --  - : (') She's his daughter, Clay
The guy in the basement's daughter and she's got a gun and it's pointed

Her gun is pointed at my dick
() Would you rather  pointed it at your head
know it makes no sense, but actually yes
Aisha , pointing it at his head
As she does, the bedsheet falls away from her
We don't see the goods, but our guys in the doorway do
Aisha watches them
Nobody moves
Nobody breathes
And then
Jensen's eyes
Just for a millisecond but Aisha pulls the trigger
Jensen, falls back screaming,     -- Aisha, moving and firing, running for the bathroom nude -- The guys    -- she dives through the doorway -- behind Clay's head as she through the drywall -- Clay, diving to the floor below the crossfire -- Aisha kicks the    -- And suddenly '
Silence as clips are slapped into weapons until

Somebody shoot something
Cougar
Setting up shop in the back
Sighting the choppers through his scope
Jensen, excited, and a little delirious from blood loss: think Cougar's got a plan
Coug, do you have a plan
(to the others) He's got a plan
(trying to steer) Stop yelling at the sniper
-- Cougar sights the   of the chopper on the left
Smiles,
And we see how one bullet can bring down two helicopters
The bullet strikes the tail rotor   -- it and spins off -- sending the chopper itself into a spin -- with it's   on the right -- they both twist and hink up -- their -- both Our guys

He claps Wade and the shoulder and heads down the steps

The Indian has been beefed-up to about   , Do you have the money
Jesus, always with the money
So impersonal
How are you
How have you been
recently attended the funeral of my best friend who you had thrown out a window
How have you been
Can't complain
'm thinking of getting satellite radio in my car
think you're a freak
Too much Ronald McDonald
Too much fantasy football
Max smiles and spreads his arms
Hey, 'm all about the bombs, baby
We have your ordinance
You have twenty four hours to get the money
Max looks over to Wade
Time to go make a withdrawal
92
As he turns back to the plane
New change of plan
You stay
've got to go get your money
He'll get your money
You stay right here
as Max contemplates this little twist
God, are you short
Twenty three hours, fifty nine minutes
Max looks at Wade
Get it done
Wade heads for the jet
Max watches him go
As Wade boards the jet Max takes a big sigh
For the first time, looks like a guy who might not be quite as sure of things as he would like
Max Looks back to the Short Scientist
(') How much do you weigh
Seriously
do not think you are funny
Where the hell is my bomb
The Short Scientist points to a large flatbed pick-up strapped to the back
You do not get it till  get the money
For a guy who's all about transcending materialism, you talk about money so much

If you keep talking, Pop-Amm will cut your mouth out of your face
Fine

Roque climbs inside
Goes to the front and unlocks it for the others, who carry a   in
They lay him on a table
She burned us, Clay

The whole op is compromised- know
Hey, fallen comrade here
Blood flowing out of his body
( ) Precious, precious blood
(: ) Cougar
Cougar nods
Gathers gauze, needle, thread, and a Comes over as Jensen looks at the last one
What's that for
Cougar    '  as an answer
So we split up again
Right
Clay doesn't respond
(') Right
94
Pooch
( ) Goddammit, Clay, whatever she knows, Max knows
It's over
His words echo through the room
through the dowel as Cougar sews him up
This is how low they've sunk
Clay finally looks up
() Okay
We split up
Some of us should go international
'll do that if nobody else wants to- So we just run again
Clay turns to him
There's nothing else we can do
Silence
Then: There's something we can do
beat
Excuse me
Three years is enough
If there's a drive at that port that we can use to get clear- What part of "he knows we're coming for it" do you not get
They're gonna be waiting for us
Par-Sec is gonna waiting for us
95
So figure out a way around them; you're good at that shit, Clay
He turns, addressing all of them: (') We run now, we're gonna be running forever
This is our one chance to get our lives back
( ) To steal them back
And 'm prepared to do anything to any one to make that happen
He looks Clay dead in the eye
(') Never play a longshot, you're never gonna win
long beat
Clay, not breaking his look with Roque: Pooch, what's the minimum time to scout the patrols, get an accurate head count on-site at the Port
48 hours, but Aisha knows that- So we hit them in twelve
Roque smiles
Pooch blinks
Twelve hours from now
You mean-- you want us to go in blind
Last thing they'll expect
Yeah, cause it's dumb
Jensen's already got the layout, and Cougar can spot on site
Right
Cougar nods
He's in

Yeah, cause gettin' shot is awesome, 'm totally up for doing it again
He gives a weak thumbs-up

You gave me no choice

Looks to Cougar, who's shredding his skin to the bone trying to claw out of the cuffs
That's a nice hat
He steps forward to take it, but Cougar is too quick for the man,
He reaches for Cougar again
Again, Cougar evades
The guards laugh at their colleague, who continues trying to grab Cougar's hat

Cougar scoops up two rifles and tosses one to Jensen - they give her covering fire as she comes
As he shoots, to the wounded Pooch: (') Can you stand

Clay, about to respond when: (

It was mercy
But you're his family, so  understand

Why'd you stick with those losers for so long

Shaking his head
No such thing

Headed straight for him

Hi, Wade
Roque turns to the Pilot: Declan, start the plane

Flips
Smashing end over end, finally coming to a rest on it's side
Climbing out, groaning: Next time, remind me - car crash first, then get shot
Sounds less painful that way
Clay looks across the tarmac to see the plane begin to Taxi
stands in they back - loading ramp still down
Cougar and  are going after that plane
The rest of you, get Wade
Me and legless Pooch are on it
(: ) Where the hell is she going
Aisha is heading off to the fenceline
Clay and Cougar run for Wade's
Cougar slides behind the wheel and starts her up,   after the plane
You call me legless Pooch again, you're gonna be Headless Jensen
What, it's a cool name
It makes you sound like a pirate
(off his look) Fine, let's go kill Wade

Cougar guns the engine, catching up to the Clay leans out the window, shooting at Huddled in the plane's  ,

We don't have enough runway to take off - we're going to have to turn around and come back to get up to speed

Pulls a The two men stand there
Sizing one another up
Gotta admit,  always wondered how this would play out
Aisha thinks you kill me
It's a distinct possibility
They begin circling one another
Clay, still weaponless

Don't need one
Bit of as longshot for you
() No
It's not
Roque
But Clay does have a knife
He   and into Roque's belly
Roque, stunned
Staggers back
For most men, that would be the end of the fight
But not these two
Roque gives Clay a bloody grin
113
Now  really am gonna cut your head off
He
And now it is
The blades whip up and down - almost too fast to see Roque gets Clay with a left cross, then buries his knife in Clay's shoulder
Clay twists free, slashes at Roque
Ten seconds in, the men separate again
Breathing hard
Clay sees Roque doesn't have his knife
Looks - realizing it's still embedded in his own shoulder
Pulls it out, They stand there, both panting
Then     full tilt
Here's how it ends
And pay attention,   : Clay goes low -- coming up to grab Roque's knife hand, which is arcing   '  -- Clay manages to   , blade inches from his Adam's apple -- and there's a moment where Roque could overpower him and actually cut his head off
But Clay and  '
And for the first time, Roque
Which seems to make Clay happy
So he  '   too

Our guys
Bloody, eyes bitterly triumphant
Clay stares at the sight before him
Only one word for it
(') Outstanding
Jensen approaches, supporting Pooch
Not to rain on everyone's we killed all the bad guys parade, but we should probably get gone - legless Pooch has a Learjet all gassed up for us in the Hangar
(off Pooch's look) It's a cool name- From the smashed up bike Wade was driving, ' Clay gets off the hood of the Vette and Cougar and Aisha help him hobble over

Looking stunned
The Short Scientist has run out of patience
Time is up, Stretch
Max looks at the Short Scientist
Stretch
That's a good one
But he doesn't look like he's very amused
Because you are so much taller than

We think it's the end
But then we hear Blowing through trees
Crickets
The soft sound of evening television
Somewhere suburban
: -- nice quiet neighborhood
Outside the kitchen window Pooch's wife , doing dishes in the sink again
Jolene looks up this time
She obviously heard it
She puts down the dishes and goes to the door
Opens it and looks out to see
Nothing
Not even by the swingset
She sighs
About to head back inside when she spies By the oak tree in the front
She steps outside
Walks down until she sees what it is
Her breath hitches in her chest
frilly purple ribbon is tied around the old oak tree
And now there are tears in Jolene's eyes
Because she knows what it means
Her husband is alive
And he will make it home
Someday
