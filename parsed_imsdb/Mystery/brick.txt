Written by Rian Johnson Over a grimy concrete wall creeping by
We emerge from
- gaping hole in the concrete side of a freeway
On the embankment beside the hole   squats, shoulders hunched
His dark eyes behind thin glasses watch the shallow stream of water which flows into the tunnel
not more than six inches deep
Just beneath the surface a young woman's pale blue arm in gaudy bracelets bats against the edge of her body like a docked boat
pebble plinks into the water beside it
1 :         "2  " - single locker
That same arm, bracelets and all, slips a note through the slats, then leaves quickly
As the cage empties a lone figure slumps to the locker
Opens it
The note falls to his feet
The figure is Brendan
He unfolds the note (folded in a triangle) -- "12:30  & "
Pico and Alexander
2 12:43
Brendan looks up from the watch
- He sits on the curb of a wide suburban street, eats lunch from a brown bag and watches a phone booth on the corner
He shows no surprise when it begins to ring
Brendan goes to the phone and puts the receiver to his ear
Silence for a moment, then a thin female voice from the phone
Originally Dode was later revealed to have been hiding above the tunnel
The street names were changed in production to match existing streets (we couldn't afford to create custom street signs
) (over phone) Brendan
Emily
(weakly) Yeah
How's things
(slow, deliberate) Status quo
Yeah
Uh huh
That's good
Her voice thins to a high, strained breath
She is crying
What's going on, Em
(through strained crying) It's good to see you, Brendan
Brendan's eyes glance around the surrounding street
Emily is crying again
(') (cont'd) It's been some time
Two months
Yeah
didn't even know your locker had to ask Brain
More crying noises
Em, why don't we meet somewhere
can't
Why not
screwed up real bad
really screwed up
Screwed up how
(blubbering, fast and incoherent) did what she said with the brick, didn't know it was bad, but the pin's on it now for poor Frisco and they're playing it all on me- Slow down now, what
You gotta help me Brendan  think tug- Oh
With a sharp breath the line clicks dead just as a black mustang roars by
Brendan drops the receiver and spins out of the booth
There, another pay phone up the hill -- empty
Brendan turns to the black mustang, far down the street man's hand drops a cigarette butt from the driver side window
1 The mustang turns the corner, gone
Brendan walks after it, finds the cigarette butt on the street
Still smoking
pale blue arrow is printed on the filter
In the distance the class bell rings
- The high school is open air - the hallways are alleyways between buildings
short kid with eyeglasses the size of Because of the orientation of the street, this was all flipped when we shot it, and the hand came from the passenger window
The dialogue in the ending field scene was changed to match, causing mass confusion for about half an hour on set
Volkswagen headlights sits against the wall
Brendan enters, leans on the wall beside him
Brain
Hey Brendan
It's been awhile
Where you been eating
Back of school
Huh
Yeah, no one's seen you
What's it been, a couple months
Yeah, it's been awhile
You gave Emily my locker number
few days ago
Was  wrong
What
To give it
No
It's been so long,  don't know you two's stats
It has been awhile
Who's she been eating with
(uncomfortable) dunno
It's hard to keep track
Is it
(shrugs) Can be
The Brain avoids Brendan's gaze
Uh huh
beat
She hasn't been doing too good
Yeah well
'm not looking for a patch up
Em's life is her own
But she asked for my help
Help with what
don't know
don't even care, it's not my business
just want to know she's ok, so 've got to find her
That's all this is
Well
know she was poking in with the Ivy-bound cheerleading elite
Laura Dannon's crowd
Across the parking lot a beautiful girl with dark long hair kisses an football player
Laura Dannon there with the Rabbit
Yeah
Brad Bramish with her
Cream on the upper crust
Brad laughs heartily
(softly) He's a sap
Know him
By sight
won't argue then
Anyway Em tagged after them for a bit, but it didn't work
So she picked her way down the food chain
Last  seen she was with whasshername, that drama vamp
Small time dealer, augh, the evil one, the one you dated- Kara
That's my bus
You know her locker number
Kara's
Em's
239
Thanks Brain
Keep your specs on, find me if she shows
Sure
The Brain trots off
In the distance Brad and Laura laugh, and he kisses her
Her hair blows in the wind
- Empty
Locker 239 is open, its door swinging gently in the wind
- Brendan sits against the massive building, flipping through loose papers
He finds two photographs, one of Emily hugging him, the other of Emily with a beautiful sharp-eyed girl at a party, drinks in hand
Sorting more papers, he finds a red card with a sequined mask on the front
The bottom edge has been torn off
- Sixth period has broke
Masses of students pile into busses
- huge chunk of brown building
Brendan strides towards it
- Drama people sit on the floor facing the stage
Brendan steps behind one, the sharp-eyed girl from the picture
She holds a freshman boy's head in her lap
Pets it like a dog
She looks back at Brendan, her face in shadow
(through a mocking smile) Hello, Brendan
Kara
Come to see the show
Kisses the freshman's forehead, purring
No,  didn't
(nudges the freshman with his toe) Lapdog, blow
The freshman sits up, looks to Kara like a spooked puppy
(to the lapdog) Stay
(to Brendan) Don't be mean
'm all friendly
(to the lapdog) Watch your head, kid - that thing bites
The dog pops up again
Kara pulls him down and nuzzles his ear
(') (cont'd) need words
'm listening
About Emily Kostich
She stops nuzzling a little too quickly
(to the dog) Get me my purse
(he goes) Hurry
He breaks into a trot
Kara smiles at Brendan
Still picking your teeth with freshmen
You were a freshman once
She slides her fingers up his arm
He growls and pushes them away
Way once, sister
You and Em were tight for a bit
Who's she eating with now
Eating with
Eating with
Lunch
Who
You're a cutie
You gonna tell me
Guess you're up from the underneath then
The whole Jerr thing blown over
Lucky strikes, you and your partner get bulled, you come up clean
But  guess you were always the brains of the outfit
1 One of many instances of an allusion to the Jerr backstory, most of which were trimmed back in the editing process for clarity
The author has threatened to write it as a stand alone short story, but probably never will, so in a nutshell: when Brendan and Emily were still an item she started hanging out with Jerr, a small time dealer
Brendan didn't approve, so he partnered up with Jerr then ratted him out to Trueman
Emily found out, and that led to their breakup on the field, which we see in a flashback
Where's Emily
Sometimes  wonder why  dumped you
(standing to go) God
don't know where she's at, Brendan
know you do, so why don't you want me to find her
Maybe 'm looking out for you
(going) Well  appreciate that
Brendan
you looking to get back into things
could use you
He is gone
Behind Kara, the play goes on
- The play is seen in shadow-play through the backdrop
Brendan slips in through an exit door, crosses the backstage area and enters the dressing rooms
- Cramped and empty
Pictures of Kara with friends are stuck in the mirror
Brendan roughly searches drawers, bags, pockets
nothing
He stops
red edge behind one of the photos - the same red card with a mask on it, but whole
Across the bottom in small print: "Halloween in January - Call for  - 555-2394" '  - Brendan pulls a phone across his desk and dials the number on the flyer
10 ' (over phone) Hello
Brendan hesitates
Hello, ma'am, this is Tom, 'm a friend from school
Could  speak to
He trails off
' (over phone) Oh, hi Tom
Laura's here, hold on
' (over phone) Yes
'm calling for details
' For what
Details about the party
' Who is this
don't think we've met
' Well then  don't think you're invited to my party
It's a rather exclusive gathering
can imagine
(she starts to speak, he cuts her off) You should really work on your invite management
That might be a personal 'room for improvement' area in your life
But discretion of your invite sending aside,  have procured a certain someone's invitation, and would like details
beat of silence
11 ' You think you're cute, whoever you are
Wait'll you get a load of my felt fedora and spats
' Who are you
Or 'll hang up
You don't know me - 'll save you some time
' know everyone and 've got all the time in the world
Folly of youth
Ask whose invitation 've got
' (slightly) What you said

' 15 Bush street, up in Stockton Cove
Buzz 42 at the gate
Nine o'clock
But who- Brendan hangs up
He folds his hands under his chin and stares at the phone, perfectly still
The clock on his desk says 4:53
: 7:37 Brendan at his desk, tapping away at Tetris
: 8:30 The desk is empty, Tetris paused
shower runs behind an ajar door in the background
12 - An imposing private community gate
Brendan coasts up on his bike and ditches it in the bushes
He checks the call box directory: "42 -- " Using the call box as a hand hold he hops the gate and walks briskly up the street
- Shiny cars line the curb
Party noises come from an upscale two story house
Brendan takes a short breath, then strides up to the front door
Large and clean, with a two story ceiling and a railed staircase at one end
Fifteen or twenty clean people, some in costumes, mill about in cliques
Brendan comes in as if he doesn't mind who sees him coming in
He gets a couple odd stares, but no one stops him
With non obtrusive confidence he cuts through the crowd to the beer keg in back and draws half a cup
- Richly adorned, crowded, lit with bright pools of light
Brendan drifts in and stands in the back, deep in shadow
The music comes from a baby grand piano set against one wall
Laura Dannon leans against it
She wears a red kimono, and is striking against the velvet black piano
Laura's kid sister, 11 years old with glasses, sits at the piano playing "All  do is Dream of You"
Laura sings, lovely and soft but with strength
1 Brendan watches from the back, his face obscured in shadow, but his eyes gleam
Through the darkened window behind him a match flares up, and someone standing outside lights a cigarette
Laura finishes the song
The room applauds, and she ruffles her kid sister's hair
Brendan ducks out, and into By the time we got around to production this had changed to "Someone to Watch Over Me," but the publishing rights proved too expensive (i
e
not free
) We chose the Gilbert & Sullivan song, which besides being lovely was also in the public domain (i
e
free
) 13 - Brad Bramish, the jock who was kissing Laura in the parking lot, sits slouched on the couch in a dense crowd
He holds a cup and speaks much too loudly to a guy named Biff at his elbow
If the coach wants to play me 'll play, but  can't put my best game in if 've got to worry about whether 'm going to be in there
Halftime last game, coach is pissed  ran it on a pass play, out on the field he says to me 'you gotta think about the team and you gotta' you know and 'if you run that ball again you're out', and  said to him you gotta let me play
'm out there, let me play, and he's saying 'no you're out' and kept saying 'Let me play
Let me play
Let me play
', just right in his face- He was
Just 'Let me play
Let me play
Let me play
' 'No you gotta' 'No, let me play
Let me play
Let me play
' Brad hunches forward, his face swollen purple, yelling that over and over
Tom steps in front of Brendan, blocking his line of sight
Brendan scans the rest of the room
His eyes catch on Laura, leaning against a divan
Her bright, sharp eyes cut through the room, straight into Brendan
He wags his eyebrows at her
She looks away quickly
Brendan turns back to Brad, still shouting 'let me play'
Tom stands between them
Tom
Brad falls silent
Most of the room follows suit
Tom turns around
Brendan smiles good naturedly
(cont'd) Could you step aside, please
'm trying to follow Brad's story, and it's difficult when  can't see his face
14 The room watches Brendan
Tom mumbles something and steps aside
Brad stares at Brendan stupidly
Brendan flashes a dopey grin and tips his glass
(stumbles) He doesn't give me a play to make, what can  do, you know
He falls into awkward silence
Biff starts babbling
Brendan looks at Brad, who is staring back at him
Brendan then slowly drags his gaze over to Laura, staring at him too, her eyes slightly amused
Brendan cocks an eyebrow
The slightest hint of a smile takes the corner of her mouth, and she wags her eyebrows once at him
Brendan glances back at Brad, looking at Laura now, not amused at all
Brendan stands to go
Biff chatters on
Brad cuts him off
(cont'd) Hey
Hey
What are you doing here
Leaving
Oh yeah
Uh huh
Unless your anecdote's got a 2nd act
Why don't you leave
(leaving) That's what  was doing
With a lit wet bar at one end
Brendan goes to the bar, puts ice in a glass and cracks it with liquor
(
) Whiskey
Brendan pauses, glass touching his lips
15 Jameson
He downs half of it
like a man who knows what he's drinking
That's a pretty sick thing to be attracted to
Brad's not a good guy to get on the wrong side of
Uh huh
They stare at each other in silence
She studies his face
The broken light of the bar makes her features seem liquid
Fearless flyer
Quit your yappin and fix me one
and slips out a sliding glass door
He fills another glass with whiskey and cuts his with water
- Brendan joins Laura, hands her a drink
Suburban lights fill the valley below
Laura sips her drink
'll never get through all this
Uh huh
She sips more
knew your old partner Jerr since grade school
Tough break
How long were you two joined up before your operation got the sting
16 few months
Could have helped himself out by turning me in, but he took the heat
He was a good guy
Solid
Was he
You knew him
Yeah  did
So why are you here tonight
'm looking for Emily
She wasn't invited
She had an invitation
Well like you said, 've got to work on that
Em's been  for a good month, nobody's seen her
saw her yesterday
Nearly nobody's seen her
So what did she tell you
(winces) Score 0 for finesse
Listen, you're scratching at the wrong door
wasn't with Emily enough to know details of what she was in,  just got wind of the downfall, and  didn't get any details of that, except that it was bad
So now that we're showing some cards
If you haven't got a finger in Em's troubles, why'd her name get me into your rather exclusive party
17 Keep up with me now
don't know, but it sounded like you did, and a body's got a right to be curious
Now 'm not so sure
Well 'll put that body to bed
don't know a damn thing about whatever troubles, and that works for me
just want to find her
long beat
Laura studies Brendan's face, then seems to come to a decision
Coffee and pie
The words hang in the air a moment
look of recognition from Brendan
Coffee and pie oh my
And you didn't hear it from me
He sips his drink
voice calls from the glass door
Another girl
Laura flashes Brendan a look and goes to her
They have quick, quiet words and the girl leaves
Laura turns back to Brendan
(') (cont'd) Will you wait here for me
Sure
You'll stay right here and wait -- 'll be five minutes
Yes
The moment she leaves Brendan runs across the lawn and hops the fence, into the neighbor's yard
Brendan runs to the edge of the neighboring house and peeks around
Laura comes out the front door, cuts across the lawn and sidewalk and trots out into the street
Brendan 18 begins to follow, but a noise from behind the fence stops him - a match being struck
Brendan creeps towards the fence and peers through a splintered hole
'  - brightly lit window in the side of Brad's house, and through the window the party
dark figure wearing a long coat and broad rimmed hat, all inky black
The figure smokes a cigarette and watches the party, absently stroking his cheek
Brendan steps back -
twig
The figure freezes
Then, making no noise at all, it spins to face Brendan, a towering black form against the window
The glowing cigarette falls to the grass
metallic glint, and a clicking sound not unlike a gun
Brendan throws himself backwards onto the grass
beat
Through the hole the black of the figure's cloak whips away
Brendan hesitates, then hops the fence
'  - Brendan lands on his feet
No black figure to be found
The cigarette still smolders on the ground
Hand rolled, plain paper
Brendan gazes through the window, catching his breath
Then he breaks the trance and creeps towards the street
- Peeking around the house, Brendan sees Laura cut across the lawn and trot into the street
Using parked cars as cover, Brendan follows
Between cars, Brendan sees a lanky kid in baggy jeans and engineer boots with a clean shaven head leaning against a black Mustang
Laura goes to him and speaks quickly
19 The dark figure in the hat emerges from the shadows
Laura says something to him
Grunting something angrily, he gets in the car with the bald kid and peels off
Laura turns and slowly walks towards the house
When she is gone Brendan stands, throws a look back at the house and walks off down the street, towards the guard gate
The two drinks, where Brendan left them
Laura takes hers and drains it
The suburban lights twinkle like stars
- The sun rises over Carrows family restaurant, a squat structure backed against the weedy edge of the runoff tunnel ravine
banner from 1973 in the window - "Coffee and Pie oh my
" pack of six pale stoners slump against the rear dumpster
Their beady eyes follow Brendan in sync as he approaches
He goes to the nearest one
Where's Dode
1 Dunno, bra
Silence and blank stares
Brendan calmly moves to the next stoner
Dode
2 Uh uh
Brendan moves to the next one
thin head pokes from around the dumpster
Hey Brendan
Maybe you shouldn't be here
Brendan steps around the dumpster
Dode slumps against the wall, thin and delicate in dusty black
Slivery eyes, pale lips, muffled intelligence
20 Kara told me you know where Em's at
Uh huh
And why are you looking for Em
She asked for my help
Uh huh
Listen man, 've got plenty on my plate without dealing with some jilted ex
It's not about that
Whatever it's about, act smarter than you look and drop it
Where is she
She's with me, and right now that's the best place for her
Leave the low life to the low lifers and dangle
You're on the bright side of dim, Dode, but if  thought you had this half- handled 'd be eating lunch
Where's she at
Better get while it's good
Brendan doesn't
(cont'd) Heel it now, dig
The 5 big stoners appear behind Brendan, threatening
Dode turns his head away to light a joint
Brendan's fist slams into his face, sending the joint spinning
Brendan slams Dode's frail frame against the dumpster
The 5 stoners stand in the exact same position, deer in the headlights
One makes a half hearted motion to intervene
21 Back off
Throw one at me if you want, hash head
've got all five senses and  slept last night, that puts me six up on the lot of you
Just easy- Brendan slams Dode into the wall
(to Dode) Where's Em
(deliberate) She's with me
She was tight when she called you, man
Came to and freaked
She told me to shake you if you came by
Said you'd only make things worse
Brendan covers how shaken he is by this statement fairly well
He drops Dode
1 (
) Put him down, man
Deal with whatever this ain't about and drop it
(to Brendan) Nothing more here, bra
Tell Emily  want to see her
Tell her if she still wants my help or not that's her business, but  want to hear it straight from her
She don't - Brendan walks away
Today
She knows where  eat lunch
22 When Brendan is a safe distance away the biggest stoner shouts with conviction And stay out, punk
- Brendan hides behind a tall clump of bushes
moment later Dode hustles away from Carrows
Brendan follows
- The sun is rising as Brendan tails Dode through the twisty suburban streets
Brendan takes cover as Dode stops by a white hatchback
girl gets out of the car and embraces Dode
Her wrist is adorned with the same cheap plastic bracelets as the dead girl's arm
Dode speaks quickly to her, she nods and speaks back
He hands her a slip of paper, which she tucks into a brightly colored address book and slips in her jacket pocket
They embrace again, Dode walks off and the girl gets in her car
Brendan stumbles after the car, but it is quickly gone
He watches it go, then follows Dode back towards school
- Dode slumps into the front door of the brown building
Brendan watches him from a distance, eyes thoughtful
After a beat he turns and walks off into the thickening crowds of students
: - Brendan eats lunch alone on a concrete wall beside a long, empty utility road behind the school
Reclining on the wall, reading "Lord of the Flies"
He raises his eyes, and sits up suddenly
23 Off in the distance on the utility road a tiny figure approaches, stumbling
Brendan jumps and hits the ground running towards the figure
Meet the girl with cheap bracelets, the girl Dode spoke to, the dead girl, Emily
He catches her just as she stumbles and falls and carries her into the shade of a covered hallway
- Emily and Brendan sit in silence
She is very pretty, but she looks bad
Too much makeup, not enough sleep
She sniffles, speaks to her shoes
must have sounded pretty crazy on the phone
Yesterday
She taps her shoes together lightly, eyes fixed on them
(cont'd) It was dumb,  got paranoid over a really stupid thing
was high,  went crazy for a little bit, but now you have to forget about it
Please
That's how you can help me now, forget about it
She turns her weak eyes to Brendan for the first time
His stare is unwavering, searching
She pushes on
(cont'd) Brendan,  know you're mad at all these people, cause you think  went away from you and went to them
But you've got to start seeing it as my decision, stop being angry because where  want to be at's different from where you wanna be at
(angry) Who fed you that line, Em
She looks back at her shoes
And stop picking on Dode
He's a good guy
The Carrows rat
24 He's a good friend
So what am
(strained anger) Yeah, what are you
Eating back here, not liking anybody, how are you judging anyone
loved you alot but  couldn't stand it,  had to get with people couldn't heckle life with you,  had to see what was what
beat
She taps her clogs
One has a hole worn through the sole
Her face contorts, seizes up, and she is sobbing
(cont'd) 'm sorry Brendan
She buries her face in his shoulder
He has a hard time speaking
You've got to come back to me, Em
No
No
Never
'm sorry
Never
can't love on your terms, Brendan
can't do that, 'm not like you
You're in a spot,  can get you out of it
Come back to me, and whatever heat follows you 'll deal with
No
You're not hearing me, no
don't want to be put away and protected
No
(cont'd) No
Tell me about the trouble, the brick and the pin - You gonna fix things like you did with Jerr
No
came to say goodbye, for good
Whatever you have to do to let me go, do it
'm gonna let you go, 've 25 decided that
Make sure that, you've got to, promise you won't torture yourself, that you'll let me go
She embraces him, enveloping him in her jacket
His face is a frozen mask
(cont'd) Let me go
As she pulls away he mechanically slips an address book from her jacket pocket
He watches her as she walks away
Brendan sits in the back, flipping through the address book
The teacher drones on about the significance of the pig's head in "Lord of the Flies"
1 Illegible scribbles, names, numbers, nothing that stops his search - then the note Dode gave her, a corner of loose-leaf paper which looks like this: Brendan studies the paper intently
- The Brain studies the paper
Busses pull into the parking lot behind them
Brendan is distant, lost in thought
Hm
Do you know anything else about this
Our one and only scene in a classroom was moved to Brendan's lunch spot to save us a location change
The degree to which the lack of classroom time in the film has been commented on has always bemused the author, who cannot for the life of him remember a single interesting thing that happened in a classroom in high school
26 (shakes his head) Mm
Slim pickings
Why'd you let Dode fly when he came back to whose-her-name, at the theater
(shrugs dismissively) Kara
It's their turf,  couldn't hear them without being seen, and that would only biff their play
Best to know it's there, let it ride and see what comes of it
(touches the paper) But anyway
Hm
Well, if this is what  think it is, it didn't come straight from Dode, less he's playing out of his league
(beat) can only give you my best guess
Yeah
When the upper crust does shady deeds they do them in different spots around town
know under the pier's one, down by the bike trails in the state park's another
There's alot of them
The pitch is they've got little symbols for each one, and that's how they tell each other the place, so word won't get around
So this might be that
But Dode wouldn't know it
This is upper crust
Dode's pie pan grease
Brendan studies the symbol
Call anything up
27 How many places start with ''
Or if it's a shape, or just a random symbol
Anyway, even if you figured it out, what good could you do
She's smart, she knows the play, she's gunning to square things
Yeah
You said her business was none of yours, so she's alright, forget it now
Go home, sleep
'  - Sparsely furnished
Brendan plays Tetris on his computer, staring off into space
His mom's voice calls "Good night" and the hallway light turns off
10:30 by the clock radio on Brendan's nightstand
The slip of paper rests beside it
Brendan lies in bed, staring at the symbol on the paper
His eyes tense
Growing larger, burning with a searing intensity, then folding into darkness
Water rushes overhead, over concrete, concrete with a hole in it -- the runoff tunnel, just for an instant, then back underwater, screaming
Brendan choking, screaming, plunging upwards
woman with no face falls from the darkness and kisses him, her long hair sweeping around him then pulling away
As the last strands slide off his face he wakes up with a start
The clock says 3:46
Brendan drips with sweat, breathing raggedly
He takes the paper and a pencil from the nightstand and shades the symbol to look like this: - The runoff tunnel, lining up perfectly with the now shaded symbol
28 His eyes turn uneasy as he removes his glasses and clicks off the light
'  - Brendan walks off into the hazy pre-dawn light
Brendan stops at a high wall of weeds, listening to the low gurgle of moving water
Slowly, robotically he pushes through
' Face down, bobbing gently in shallow water
Bluish white
Red foam clings to her
Silently, as if lowered by a string Brendan sinks down, squatting in the mud
His lungs empty in one choppy breath
He pulls his glasses off sluggishly
' Lifeless, pale
' contorted, frozen mask, eyes wet
' Stringy, flowing gently in the water
' Dazed, drifting
then suddenly snapping to attention
noise
From the tunnel
Brendan freezes
The inky blackness of the tunnel mouth opens like a vacuum
silent, but then - The scrape of a shoe against concrete, then echoing footsteps running away
Brendan springs like a cat, sprinting into the tunnel
29 Nearly pitch black
2 sets of running footfalls
Brendan is chasing, running full speed into the blackness, heart pounding - we almost don't notice that Brendan's are now the only footfalls
Brendan notices
He stops
Silence in the darkness, except for Brendan's breath
and someone near
Brendan takes a fist in the cheek and goes down
An inky black figure steps from the shadows and kicks him in the stomach
Brendan curls on the ground, the figure over him
(low whisper) Your little Em
The figure runs off
Brendan raises his head painfully - the figure is silhouetted briefly against the distant bright end of the tunnel, then is gone
- Emily's body is still there
Brendan crawls out of the tunnel and collapses in the shallow water, beside the body
He rests his head on his arm, eyes on Em's hair
- Cold and barren, nearly empty
Brendan limps across the barren lawns
line of phone booths on campus
Brendan nearly collapses against one
He dials, still in a stupor
Saint Clement police
Brendan stares into space, eyes burning (cont'd) Saint Clement police, hello
Hello
Brendan hangs up
- Early morning mist below a squat brick building
30 Warmly lit, sheltering the few souls scattered here and there at tables
The Brain sits at one of them reading an impossibly large book
He watches curiously as Brendan approaches him
Hey, Brendan
Brendan falls into a chair
The Brain looks him over
(cont'd) You're up early
(thick, distant) couldn't sleep
(nods, back to his book) Find Emily
Brendan breathes out softly
(cont'd) You alright
Yeah
What, are you here for zero
Nah,  gotta take the early bus, cause the others don't run by my street
Bad break
Eh
Time to read's nice
So what's the word with Em
She's gone
Can't raise her
No,  can't
So what now
31 Now
don't know
guess it's don't know
Brendan takes a long moment
He stares down at his glasses, wet with condensation
(cont'd) Brain,  can't let her go
was set to but  can't
don't think  can
You think you can help her
No
You think you can get the straight, maybe break some deserving teeth
Yeah
think  could
Well
Brendan rubs his forehead
Kara tried to rope me
She came right out and asked
She was scared
Tell me to walk from this, Brain
Tell me to drop it
Walk from it
Drop it
(grins) You're thick as what-all, Brendan
Yes  am
Brendan cleans his glasses
He looks Brain in the eye, and his mannerisms come back into focus
(cont'd) 'd need you to Op
Like on Jerr, but that was cake to this
And unlike Jerr, there's not much chance we'll come out clean
Twenty four seven on this one
You okay to op for me again
32 The Brain barely smiles
What first, tip the bulls
Brendan puts on his glasses, stands to go
No, bulls would gum it
They'd flash their dusty standards at the wide-eyes and probably find some yegg to pin, probably even the right one
But they'd trample the real tracks and scare the real players back into their holes, and if we're doing this  want the whole story
No cops, not for a bit
So what first
don't know
Your mom still have the cell
In her car
Borrow it for a few days, get me the number
(stands to go) Wait for my word, and cover for me first period
'm going to be a little late
- vast field of asphalt segmented by a dozen basketball courts outlined in cracked paint
1 Brendan trudges across it, his steps heavy
He stops and stands very still, staring at the ground for a beat then raising his eyes to Flat, gray, pin straight
Brendan's voice starts speaking rapidly, confident and clear
This describes the location at my school that the "showdown" scenes were originally written for
Between when  wrote the script and when we shot it, however, the school expanded and built portable classrooms on the basketball field, and so we reluctantly moved these scenes to the football field
33 (
) Yeah it was personal
Jerr spooked some decent gees and ran around some what was straight with him, but 'm nobody's bull runner
This wasn't a business sit
But yeah
bulled him
Got in tight, partnered up and sent him over
to reveal
He looks different, edgier, more alive, wearing different clothes and a thin goatee1
He keeps talking directly at us
(cont'd) 'd bull the lot of them, Em, 'd burn down the whole party if they tried to play you again
Jerr and whoever's next
want to keep you safe
An  swings into frame, wearing cheap plastic bracelets and pale blue fingernail polish
It slaps Brendan hard in the face
He catches it
Emily wrenches her arm away and stumbles backwards onto the pavement
Brendan grabs her sleeve
She twists away
He grabs her shoulder, grabs her waist, she resists, and suddenly they are struggling with violent pent up intensity until with a shout she breaks away and falls to the ground
beat
Gulls cry in the distance
You can't keep me safe, Brendan
'm in a bigger world now, and you can't hide me from it, and you can't beat it
Not if  don't want you to
Brendan's face looks lumpish, while Emily's is strong
She stands and walks off into the distance across the barren field
' Watching her go
It is back to present day, pale, clean shaven, sullen
His eyes are cold with resolve
- Brendan sloshes down into the water
Without delicacy he lifts Emily's body and pulls her back into the tunnel
Which Joe would not even consider, thank god
34 Pitch back
Brendan lays the body down
Two beady eyes peer at him from the darkness - he freezes
The eyes hop forward - a gull
The two watch each other for a moment, then the gull squawks and flutters out the bright mouth of the tunnel
Brendan follows it without looking back at the body
1 - Brendan and the Brain lean against a wall
The Brain slips him a piece of paper
There's the cell number
Keep it on vibrate
(pats his jacket pocket) Yeah
Better stop meeting me in the open too
'm going to start getting visible, and need you on the underneath
'll call
Trueman asked for you
Wants words in his office
bet
Keep him off me - stonewall him, he won't bite, just keep him away from me
'll try
So what's first
Make Em's troubles mine
'm going to throw a few words at you, tell me if they catch
Brick
No
very early draft held on the tunnel after Brendan left, and revealed a dark figure (Dode) creeping away from the top of the tunnel, causing the pebble described on page 1 to plink into the water
35 Or bad brick
No
Tug
Tug
that might be a drink
Drink
Vodka and milk or something, or maybe not
Poor Frisco
Frisco
Frisco Farr1 was a sophomore last year,  think
Real trash, maybe hit a class a week
Didn't know him then, and haven't seen him around
Pin
Pin
the Pin
The Pin, yeah
The Pin's kind of a local spook story
You know the Kingpin
've heard it
Same thing
Supposed to be old, like 26, lives in town
All apologies to Frisco Farr, who the author did actually go to school with, and who was neither a druggie nor `real trash', but was a great guy who simply had a very cool sounding name
He is now (the author was horrified to learn) practicing law
36 Jake1 runner, right
Big time
maybe
Ask any dope rat where their junk sprang they'll say they scraped it from that who scored it from this who bought it off so, and after four or five connections the list'll always end with the Pin
But 'll becha you got every rat in town together and said 'show your hands' if any of them've actually seen the Pin, you'd get a crowd of full pockets
You think the Pin's just a tale to take whatever heat
(shrugs
Beat) But what's first
show of hands
Brendan strides past forest scenery and drama geeks, through another door and into sunlight
- Kara smokes a cigarette
Brendan leans beside her
(annoyed) Hey Brendan
Here for the show
No
Would you go then, honey, cause 've got this headache
Try smoking like a chimney, 've heard that helps
In an admittedly paltry concession to clarity, this was changed to `Dope runner' in post production
37 Brendan grabs the pack of cigarettes
(cont'd) Isn't this Dode's brand
Kara snaps her head towards him, a flash of anger
She catches herself and smiles cooly
You don't know Dode's brand
Oh  do now
Angry again, Kara snatches the pack from him
(cont'd) 'm going to start shaking things up
Give me the story and you might miss the bite
The story about what
Alright
He turns and walks away
The story about what
don't want to play games if you've got a headache
Get me if you want to spill it, but  can't guarantee safe passage after tonight
don't know what- At the stage door, not slowing
Tell the Pin that Brad was my calling card, and  need words
Brad Bramish
Through the door and into the theater
38 - He spins to see Kara's face just before the door closes
She's worried
- The Brain walks out of a classroom and Brendan swings behind him
(fast and low) Tail Kara through lunch
She's got rehearsal but she'll blow early
She goes home, drop her, else wait for my call
The Brain turns and Brendan's gone
- Brendan wanders through the thick lunchtime crowd towards a cluster of 3 or 4 flashy luxury cars set aside at the far end of the lot
Brad Bramish sits slouched in the front seat of his convertible, front door open
small crowd hangs about Brad, his crony Biff at his elbow
That's all 'm saying, is put me in the game and 'll do what needs to be done, but they don't put me in, what needs doing don't get done and don't come crying to me, man
Get off my grill man, you didn't put me in, don't come to me if you didn't let me play
They didn't
Brendan scans the rest of the cars
His eyes catch on Laura Dannon sitting in another convertible, off to the side
Her bright eyes cut through the crowd, straight into Brendan
He wags his eyebrows at her
She looks away
Brendan walks into Brad's direct line of view and obviously leans against one of the cars
Hey
What are you doing here
39 Listening
Uh huh
Alright, you got me
'm a scout for the Gophers
(not amused) Oh yeah
Of all things, yeah
Been watching your game for a month, but that story just now clenched it
You've got heart, kid
How soon can you move to Minneapolis
few snickers around the crowd, but nowhere near Brad
(flat with anger) Yeah
Cold winters, but they've got a great public transit system
Yeah
Yeah
Oh yeah
There's a thesaurus in the library
'Yeah's under ''
Go ahead, 'll wait
Who invited you
To the parking lot
Well gee  kind of invited myself
think you'd better leave then
40 No, 'm having too good a time
Just the same
Brendan smiles slightly, and very deliberately crosses his legs
Brad's face tenses
(cont'd) Maybe you want to go someplace more private
With you
Brad says 'who else
' by lifting his arms
(cont'd) (as if he's been asked to the movies) Sure
Brendan stands and walks off
Brad follows and the rest of the crowd trails after him
He leads them behind a parked  van and turns to face Brad
People gather around in a wide circle
Brendan pulls his jacket off as Brad hangs back, mumbling
You know what's good for you you'll just beat it
Beating a small frye won't win me anything and it's not going to do you any good- Laura pulls up in her convertible, behind Brad, watching
In the next moment Brendan cuts Brad off by putting his fist in his face
Brad grunts but doesn't lose ground
Brendan throws his short stocky frame into Brad's larger one and tenderizes his midsection with jabs
Brad tags Brendan in the ribs, then smacks the palm of his hand into Brendan's face, shoving him back onto the pavement
He comes at Brendan with his big fists clenched
Brendan kicks Brad full force in the shins
41 Brad tumbles, and Brendan comes up fast, connecting hard with the point of Brad's chin
Brad gets his balance fast, and before Brendan can throw another he throws one himself, then another, both into Brendan's stomach
Brendan pulls back and kicks Brad's shin where he had kicked it before
Brad roars and hits Brendan very hard in the face
Brendan bounces back like a rubber ball and throws his weight into a square punch right into Brad's nose
The sound of eggs breaking, and Brad falls backwards like a board
He stays down, holding his face
Brendan staggers back, breathing hard, and looks up at the small crowd
Some stare at Brendan, some at Brad, but nobody seems about to do anything
Brendan runs his sleeve over his face and walks unsteadily off, pushing past the last few people rushing over
Hey, is there a fight
Yeah
He throws a last look at Laura, who meets his gaze and drives off
- Brendan walks away from the lot, towards the school
Laura pulls up beside him in her car
Hey
Brendan ignores her and b-lines for the school
Laura brakes hard, parking by the curb
- Brendan limps down the hallway
Laura appears behind him, trotting to catch up
You're quite a pill
Uh huh
42 Where are you going
Home
Why did you take a powder the other night
Same reason 'm taking one now
Hold it
(he keeps walking) don't get you
That's a chilly heel to be giving a girl who's where you want to know about
'll get where 'm going just fine
want to help you
Go away
Silence behind him
He stops, turns wearily
She looks genuinely hurt
(') (cont'd) Look,  can't trust you
You ought to be smart enough to know that
didn't shake the party up to get your attention, and 'm not heeling you to hook you
Your connections could help me, but the bad baggage they bring could make it zero sum game or even hurt me, so 'm better off coming at it clean
wouldn't have to lead you in by the hand- can't trust you
Brad was a sap, you weren't, you were with him and so you were playing him, so you're a player
With you behind me 'd have to tie one eye up watching both your hands, and can't spare it
43 You're not Brad
No, 'm not
He turns and walks away
She doesn't follow
- Brendan slumps against it, receiver to his ear, licking a bruised lip
He wears dark glasses
(on the phone) You didn't call
Sorry
Kara went home though, didn't she
Yeah, but she stopped at a payphone and made two calls that she didn't want on her phone bill
Get the numbers
No
Sorry
'alright
Are me and Brad front page news
All the buzz
You really do that
Yeah
Why
Is Brad the Pin
Brad's a sap
downed him on his field and his crew didn't bite
So now  know he's a sap and anyone who acts like he isn't is profiting by it
That's not why roughed him, though
44 For kicks
Economics
Brad's the school's biggest jake buyer, so if this Pin is behind all the selling,  just got his attention
Anyway, now's just shaking things out
Look, you know a kid around the burgh, lanky, short, shaved head, turns a black tang
told you before  don't know the car
Those types are a nickel a pound, but nobody  know that you don't
And Trueman again- Keep him off
And keep your specs on - need to find that kid
Okay
Brendan hangs up and turns sluggishly
lanky kid with a short shaved head and engineer boots punches him in the face
Brendan hits the pavement
The lanky kid is over him in a split second, beating his face and body with short, heavy blows
Flashes of the lanky kid - a shiny scar shaped like a thin triangle runs down the side of his face
After a brief silent thrashing the kid walks off with several other blurry figures
car peels out and roars off Brendan lies still
The class bell rings, very distant
Legs criss cross before his eyes, each blurring the world a bit more until it is completely smeared
: Brendan sits with an ice pack against his head in a tiny office
man in his early thirties behind a wood colored 45 desk and name plate, " , " plays with a pencil
You didn't know this boy
No sir, never seen him
And he just hit you
Like  said, he asked for my lunch money first
Good thing  brown bagged it
Trueman trains a good natured dubious eye on Brendan
Alright Brendan
've been looking to talk to you
Brendan doesn't react
(cont'd) You've helped this office out before
No
gave you Jerr to see him eaten, not to see you fed
Fine, and well put
Accelerated English, Mrs
Kasprzyk
Tough teacher
Tough but fair
Mm
Anyway then, we know you're clean, and you've, despite your motives, you've been an asset to us
think you're a good kid
Uh huh
46 want to run a couple names by you
Brendan stands to go
(cont'd) We're not done here
(angry) was done here three months ago
told you then 'd give you Jerr and that was that, 'm not your inside line and 'm not your boy
That's not a very helpful- (anger builds) You know what 'm in if the wrong yeg saw me pulled in here
What are you in
No
And no more of these informal chats - if you've got a discipline issue with me write me up or suspend me and 'll see you at the parent conference
Hold it,  could - hold it - could write you up for talking back to a
For looking at me in a threatening way
'd exercise a little more tact, Mr
Frye
You can't pull a play like that unless need you for something
So do
Maybe
So maybe you're gonna need me too
Maybe
Alright,  need you off my back completely for a few weeks
There might be some heat soon
47 (interested) If it's something  can't cover,  won't go to bat for you
If  get caught like that it's curtains anyway -  couldn't have brass cutting me favors in public
'm just saying now so you don't come kicking in my homeroom door once trouble starts
Trueman bites a thumbnail
Okay, here's what  can do
won't pin you for anything you aren't caught at
'll ride it a little while, as long as it doesn't get too rough
But if anything comes up with your fingerprints on it,  can't help you
Also, if  get to the end of whatever this is and it gets hot and you don't deliver, The Veep will need someone to hand over, police- wise
And 'll have you
There better be some meat at the end of this like you say, or at least a fall guy, or you're it
Sure  am
Got one more favor to ask
- Gary Trueman throws Brendan out
Get the hell off my campus, punk
Brendan glances around, and limps off
- No stoners, no Dode
Brendan breathes uneasily
- Brendan leans against it
No, Dode's  all around
48 'm 9 of 10 that Kara's got him, but who knows where
shook but she's not spilling
No more job offers
So she's got a play
And  know enough about Kara to let that worry me
Alright, keep your specs on for him
Any other news
Some
Laura Dannon came to me looking for you
(considers this) She did, huh
Fourth period, nearly shook me upside down
Can't say  didn't enjoy it, but why'd she come to me
She's tapping Kara, and Kara knows you know me
Yeah, well
She's some piece of work
If had known where you were  might have told her
That's the spirit
Ask around for Dode, tail Kara again at lunch
got knives in my eyes, 'm going home sick
'll call you tonight
- Bordering a supermarket
Brendan trudges along
Suddenly he stops
Parked in the supermarket parking lot is a black mustang
- The sun hangs low
Brendan approaches the car and walks around it slowly
He peers inside
tuft of paper pokes out from under the seat
He pulls the door handle, locked
49 Brendan picks up a broken chunk of concrete from the ground, waddles over to the car and holds the chunk above his head, ready to drop it through the window
He stops
His eyes catch something in the distance
The lanky shaved-head kid, whose name is Tugger
Coming towards him fast
Brendan stands there for a moment, then lets the chunk fall to the ground
He casually leans against the car, removes his glasses, puts them in a hard case and puts the hard case in his pocket
Tugger hits him like a train and throws him across the pavement
Tug turns back to the car and takes out his keys
Brendan gets up and comes towards Tug, his face stiff
Tug turns and pops him once squarely in the mouth
Brendan falls to his knees
While Tug unlocks the door Brendan stands up woozily
Grunting, Tug spins and grabs Brendan's jacket, pushing him back while he slaps him hard in the face, back and forth, three times
When Tug lets go Brendan drops like a stone, catching himself on his hands and knees
The car door slams
The mustang drives about a hundred yards out into the parking lot, spins around and stops, facing Brendan
Its motor purrs deeply
Brendan begins to limp towards it doggedly, head up, eyes fixed
crackling roar and short squeal of tires spit the mustang forward
It comes straight at Brendan, rumbling like a tank
Brendan stops walking and stands very still, eyes steady
The gap between him and the car closes in no time at all
It speeds past him not six inches to his left, brushing the edge of his jacket
Brakes squeal behind him
Brendan turns and lopes towards the mustang, idling about fifty feet away
He stops at the window
Tugger eyes him curiously, with some respect
want to see the Pin
(nods slightly) Yeah,  guess you do
50 Twisty and narrow
The black mustang flies through them at impossible speeds, roaring past like a bullet
Loud engine noise, jostling, grunting
Then a metallic jangle, some scraping, and a
- The trunk pops open, revealing Brendan holding a jack rod
- Tug is putting a tape in the deck, eyes down
Behind him the trunk pops open, then pulls down out of sight just as he looks back up
Brendan holds the trunk about three inches open, just enough to see which street signs pass by
Loud music plays from the car -- "Sweet Baby James" by James Taylor
1 The car zooms on
' Through the ajar trunk
The mustang slides to a stop beside an elaborate wooden mailbox carved as an eagle's head
Brendan closes the trunk
- small one story house, slightly run down
Tugger opens the trunk and drags Brendan out, covering his eyes with a palm, slams the trunk and goes inside
When they are gone the broken trunk drifts open
very dim narrow hall with a steep stairway at one end, dark doors down the length of it and a lit door at the other end
Tugger drags Brendan down the stairway, drops him and goes into the lit room
Unfortunately Mr
Taylor flatly refused, which, given the context, was probably wise
51 Brendan lifts his head painfully
Surrounding him in the darkened doorways are dozens of boys, some dressed like Tugger, others dressed in black
Tug pokes his head out
Alright
Arms pop out of the darkness and drag Brendan towards the lit room
' small room, amazingly messy
Clothes strewn about, groves of empty bottles, precarious piles of books
The overall impression though is not of jumbled chaos, but of a nest, comfortably woven and very worn in
slim figure with wispy hair sits facing the wall at a small desk, writing under a green bookkeeper's lamp
Brendan is shoved into the center of the room
Tug and his clones slump against the surrounding walls
Brendan watches the thin figure's back
For a beat the only noise is the scratching of the thin man's pencil
Then he sighs and swivels around
Mid to late twenties
Sallow features, tired eyes
His clothes are so richly black it is difficult to make out specific items -- he is just one inky black mass from the neck down and eyebrows up
You the Pin
Yeah
(beat of silence) So now 'm very very curious what you're going to say next
Maybe 'll just sit and bleed at you
The Pin shifts in his seat, bored
Helled if you're gonna go breaking my best clients' noses and expect me to play sandbag
Anyway you've been sniffing me out before then, sniffing for me like a vampire bat for a horse 52 with a nick on its ear he can suck on
They do that
(Brendan blinks) So now you got Tugger to bring you here, which he never does, and you got me listening, so 'm curious what you've got to say that better be really, really good
Call Ms
Dannon in from the hall first; she oughta hear this
(amused) No dice, soldier
Would have been a neat trick, though
(shrugs, then slowly) was going to make up some bit of information or set up some phony deal, anything so you'd let me walk
Then was going to go to the vice principal and spill him the street address of the biggest dope port in the burgh
The Pin's eyes shoot to Tugger, who doesn't flinch
He knows zippo
1250 Vista Blanca, the ink blotter at the desk in the den in the basement of the house with the tacky mailbox
The world turns on its side as Tugger pushes Brendan's head down into the carpet
You gonna do what now
The Pin walks towards them
One of his shoes is twice the size of the other
No good, soldier
The cronies around the room begin cackling
Tug's face is a mask of rage
Brendan can't breath
His face swells
53 (cont'd) Alright, let up
But Tug doesn't let up
Brendan's world grows hazy, the cackling laughter reverberates, then a clean voice pierces the din
() Tug, stop
Tug's face breaks for a moment, and he lets go
Brendan's head lolls to the side
Laura stands in the dark doorway
Brendan sees Tug's knuckles and a flash of white for a split moment as Tug hits him in the face
The Pin's black body spills out across the frame, leaving us in black
Brendan wakes up curled on a mattress on the floor
bare light bulb hangs from the ceiling
Tugger sits five feet away, watching him like a hungry dog
Brendan stares back at him through thick, glazed eyes
Where are my glasses
(Tugger grins) Hell with ya then
Which wall's the door in
Tug points, amused
Brendan heaves himself up, and Tug shoves him back down
Brendan winks at him, stands and lurches towards the door again
Tugger grabs his shirt and slams him into the wall, but freezes when he hears a door latch click
Sneering, he drops Brendan back onto the mattress and sits against the opposite wall
Sounds of a door opening and closing come from the darkness
Light footsteps clack on the cement floor
Suddenly Tug vanishes -- the room's darkness just seems to swallow him
The thin whispery voice of the Pin speaks softly
Sorry about this kid, but what the hell with what you said before
54 His disembodied face appears a few feet about where Tug had sat
(cont'd) Where you were at, with all of us and the Tug a fist away, you've got to use your nut
Allay the situation, So yeah, you're not scared of me,  got it, but 'm also thinking you're a little nuts now, so you've got that trade off with your standing
But nuts isn't all bad, so maybe it was a good play
don't know
He is standing in front of Tug
His black clothes and broad rimmed black hat blend perfectly with the dark room, such that his face seems to bob about in space
Brendan stifles a cough
(cont'd) So, Laura talked me down
Let's get you upstairs, back with the living
- Brendan sits at a breakfast table eating cornflakes
The kitchen is on the first floor of the Pin's house, or rather the Pin's mother's house
She is a soft old lady in a pastel cotton dress, currently bent over the fridge mumbling
thought we had orange juice, Brendan, 'm sorry
How about Tang, or that's more like soda isn't it, or not soda but it hasn't got any juice in it, it can't be very fortifying
Water's fine, ma'am, thanks
Now just a moment, we have apple juice here, if you'd like that, or milk, though you've got that in your cornflakes,  don't know if drinking it as well might be too much
Apple juice sounds terrific
It's country style
55 That's perfect
She shuts the fridge
Tugger and the Pin sit behind her, looking comfortably bored
The Pin, a sharp black hole against the soft yellow kitchen, eats oatmeal cookies with small delicate bites
'll even give it to you in a country glass, how'd that be
Boys
'm fine, Mrs
Thanks, mom
The Pin kisses her on the cheek
Okay, well 'm going to go, um, do something in the other room now
She shuffles out
(to Brendan) So hows bout we take another snap at hearing your tale
don't know
It starts out same as before, and this floor ain't carpeted
We're cooled off
Yeah well, your muscle seemed plenty cool putting his fist in my head
want him out
The Pin grins thinly, uncomfortable
Looky, soldier- The ape blows or  clam
56 (stands violently) So clam
What've you got  can't beat out of you back in the basement
The Pin and Brendan are perfectly still, watching each other
Give us a few minutes, Tug
Tug turns to him, but Pin keeps his eyes on Brendan
(cont'd) 'll call you if whatever
Beat
Tug stomps off, slamming the narrow door hard behind him
The Pin goes back to gnawing his cookie
(cont'd) So
Brendan sets down his spoon
About a year ago  had a small time dealing partnership with Jerr Madison
Know him
Till he took the fall for you
Yeah well
didn't ask him to, but he was a straight player
got out clean - almost
Nothing on my official record, but the VPs play it like  owe them one
When  made it clear  wasn't playing their hound dog, well they didn't like it
They keep calling me in, badgering me
Gee that's tough
don't like being told whose side 'm on
So now they think 'm on your trail, 'm in a nice spot to know their movements and feed them yours
gotcha
57 You haven't got me yet
What, price
Considering the benefits my services could yield,  don't think that's unreasonable
And what are your services exactly, just so  can be specific on the invoice
(shrugs) Whatever serves your interests
The Pin stands
Fair enough
'll have my boys check your tale, and seeing how it stretches we'll either rub or hire you
You'll know which by end of the day tomorrow
Brendan stands but doesn't follow as the Pin opens the narrow door Tugger went through and descends the dark stairs behind
(cont'd) We're done
The moment the Pin vanishes into the basement's murk Laura comes up out of it
She takes Brendan's hand
'll drive you back
'   - They zig zag though the twisty suburban streets
Brendan stares sullenly into space
Just drop me at school
(they take a hard turn) How long was  out
Half an hour
It took all of it for me to cool the Pin down
58 (flatly, but sincerely) Thanks
They drive on in silence
- Laura's convertible stops, and Brendan climbs out painfully
He studies her face for a moment
You trust me now
Less than when  didn't trust you before
If you can tell me your angle in this, maybe  can
Come here
1 Brendan leans on the car, his face close to hers
(') (cont'd) 'm on the in, top level of the tower and  know everyone, but  don't know all what goes on
knew Em when she tried to get with me and Brad, and liked her
She was smart
But she wasn't us, and it didn't work
When she left she took some souvenirs, dirty habits she wasn't strong enough to control and a connection to the Pin to keep them going
With me
So far
few months go by, and the next  hear the Pin's raging over a situation with some certain junk Em was partial to, and the downfall's coming on Em's head
You think Em scraped the junk off the Pin
Not to weasel in a plug, but the original version of this scene (shot as written) is on the deleted scenes section of the
Available at fine retailers everywhere
59 don't know, but whether she scraped or copped or just ran her tab around the world and into her own back, it must have been grand
've never seen the Pin so hot
This all helps but it's not what asked
What's your angle in all this
don't know
'm usually pretty sharp, but
maybe  see what you're doing for Emily, trying to help her
And  don't know anyone who would do that for me
Now you are dangerous
Throwing the car in gear, she peels out and leaves him standing alone in the fading evening light
Brendan pushes through the gloom, past forest scenery, deeper and deeper until he comes to a door
' Hazy and cramped
Everything blends into the color of flesh
No walls are visible; it is all billowy piles of costumes
Brendan pushes in
Kara sits at the mirror, putting on eyeliner
(sing song) Brendan Brendan Brendan
Where's Dode flopped
(she makes a face) know you two are cozed up, so you'll tell me or you won't
Oooh, getting feisty
(giggles) Last time we talked you were giving ultimate-tims
60 It worked
You went to Laura, didn't you
Told her my tale
All part of your plan
Turned out to be
feel so cheap and used
Gol,  must seem a real cad
Sometimes just hate myself
Kara grins dreamily
Whatever happened to us, Brendan
Where's Dode flopped
She turns to face him
We were a pair and a half for a few months, weren't we
Sometimes  miss having someone  can talk to
You ever miss having someone
guess you must
Brendan's face is a mask
need to hear Dode's tale about Emily
It's important
(darkly) You better be sure you wanna know whatcha wanna know
Brendan stands, coughing
Uh huh
Laura's working with me now, and 'll have the Pin and Tug in my corner soon
The sooner  get the truth from Dode or the truth about Dode from you, the safer you'll both be
No
Pass it on to Dode anyway
Maybe he'll have the 61 sense to get out from under you before he gets hurt
You didn't, did you
Brendan leaves without looking back
'  - Brendan's at his desk, on the phone
(on the phone) So what happens now
Now we wait for the Pin's answer
Unless his crew spotted  Truman's social call this morning, it'll be yes
'd give us 70/30
If we're in  get under his skin and see what's what
You stick to Kara, keep your specs peeled for Dode and stay away from Laura
The Brain is quiet for a beat
think she's with us, Brendan
(too sharp) 'll let you know when she is
beat of silence
Okay
Brendan gently replaces the receiver and sits for a moment in silence
- The class bell rings, and the cage quickly empties
Brendan limps in, opens his locker
note falls to his feet
It is folded into a star
He pulls it open
"   & "
He fishes the old note out and compares them - different handwriting
62 The locker cage is now empty and silent, except for the steady sound of heavy footfalls
Brendan looks up from the notes
lug with a lumpish face is coming towards him
He wears a black trenchcoat over bulbous shoulders, and his black hair comes down over his eyes like a sheepdog's
You the Pin's
No answer
The lug keeps coming
(cont'd) So what's his answer
Closer, not slowing
Brendan tightens his hand into a fist
Then
and a long slender switchblade gleams in the lug's right paw
Brendan jumps back as the lug swipes the blade at his torso
Before the lug winds up for another slash Brendan is running
- Brendan runs through the empty campus square, the lug follows
- Wind rushing, sweating, the lug very close
Their footsteps clatter on the cement
Brendan swings around a corner, doubles back and stops with his back to a wall - he's lost sight of him
Brendan sweats, listening
The lug's footsteps echo through the hallways, coming from all directions at once
Then it seems clear - he's down the hall on Brendan's right
Brendan dashes left
Wrong
The lug looms over him, his knife hand flashing
Brendan's jacket shoulder tears open, and the white filling inside turns red
He stumbles back blindly, gets his footing and scrambles out of reach
Brendan sprints away, down the hall, gaining about thirty feet on the lug before turning the corner
Brendan drops to a sitting position
Running fast
63 Kicks his shoes off and clambers to his feet
The lug's footsteps are impossibly loud
Just about to round the corner
On his socked feet running silently back towards the corner
The lug's footsteps crash like symbols as they both come around the same corner in opposite directions at full speed
Brendan slides like a baseball player, tangling his legs into the lug's
The lug pitches forward with frightening momentum
He hits the hall's metal handrail with his arms and head
hollow gong reverberates through the hallway, and the lug falls like a puppet with his strings cut
wallet with a couple of twenties and a student  ( ), three hash pipes, fifteen joints, a baggie of weed and a large brownie in another baggie
Brendan leaves it all on him and staggers off
- Brendan breathes heavily into the phone
Chuck Burns, big lug with hair like a sheepdog
(on the phone) Yeah  know him,  just can't pin him to any crowd
He's definitely not muscle for anyone
He taps the Carrows crowd but doesn't hang with them
If you've got a guess  could check it out- The Pin
If he's with the Pin everything's kablooie and  gotta blow the burgh
'll check it
'm in third now- Brendan spots the Pin's Cady pulling into the parking lot
64 Never mind
If  don't call by three call in the bulls
Brendan hangs up and begins walking at a normal pace along the sidewalk
The cady pulls up beside him, and he stops walking
The door swings open and a voice comes from inside
Get in
With no perceivable hesitation, he does
- Brendan sits beside the Pin
The windows are tinted and the car is very dark
The seats are pink vinyl
The car lurches forward
Brendan and the Pin are silent for a beat, not looking at each other
So
So
Tangles
stocky kid in the front seat turns, and reaches into his jacket
For a moment he stays like that, hand in his jacket, eyes on Brendan
Brendan's face is placid
Tangles pulls out an envelope and drops it in Brendan's lap
(cont'd) That's what you'll get every week for your services
Less of course there's a specific job involved, in where you get sliced in with my crew
Square
Yeah
Silence
The Pin holds his hat in his hands, fingering the rim
We're doing a thing down at the Hole tonight
Know it
65 South of  Street, yeah
It's sort of a welcome you in thing
Eight o'clock
The car stops
- Brendan climbs out of the car on the exact spot they picked him up
The Cady drives off
Brendan checks his watch
' 12:32
phone begins to ring
&  - Brendan looks up from his watch and answers the payphone, holding the receiver to his ear in silence
(on the phone) know what you did
saw what you did
1 The voice is low and garbled, filtered through something
So
Anyone  tell, it would ruin you some way
And 'm going to tell someone
Are you making an offer
Maybe
Or maybe 'll just do you in
Hire another hash head to blade me
Originally the source of this call was supposed to be a mystery, but during post production we decided it was one layer too many, and identified the caller as Dode
Brendan's first line was overdubbed in post to say `Dode
" instead of "So
" 66 Don't need no blades, shamus
just gotta squawk
What do you want
Just to see you sweat
Brendan replaces the receiver and stands still for a moment
Then he inserts a coin and dials
(on the phone) Brendan
Yeah
You alright
Yeah, 'm fine
Keep digging on the Burns lug, but the main thing is to find Dode
He set up whatever Emily walked into, it's getting more and more urgent we talk
Alright
Trueman was looking for you
Trueman and the
No, just Trueman
Asked for me
No, but looked
That's not good
Alright, keep me posted
Brendan hangs up
67 - NIGHT1 bonfire burns about a hundred feet off
Figures jump through the blaze to thrash music
The Pin and Brendan wander towards us on the dark beach
So 'm going to start you on the dope circles, cleaning up the Turkish dues, pulling in the strags
Small fries
Yeah, well
Just to see how you handle
Anyway there isn't much else doing
'm tailing out this big deal, but that's almost done
Oh yeah
What was it
Big time
Biggest  ever done, and there was a snag in it, but it's almost done now
What was it
It's over
Almost, you said
It's over enough
You're gonna make me curious, being so curious
They sit in the sand, facing the breakers
(cont'd) gotta lay something out
You're coming into a certain situation, and 'm bringing you in sort of because of it
If ever you want to witness a look of pure horror, shoot a micro budget feature film and tell your cinematographer that there will be an extended scene on a beach at night
Turns out it's difficult to light up a beach without very large and expensive equipment
Who knew
Shooting at sunset proved a fortunate and less horror inducing solution
68 (beat) didn't tell Tugger to hit you for the Brad Bramish thing
Laura and , decided  oughta hear what you were gunning for before  made an enemy
Tug just did it, though
He was hot, and he just hit you
He's been doing that
Yeah
He's got my best interests,  know, he's loyal, he just gets hot
Muscle you can't control's no good at that
You're working for me, not Tug, that's all
Alright
moment of silence
The breakers crash
Things can get, you know, it's tough sometimes
Twisted, complicated, watching all the,  don't know
Everyone's got their thing
(silence) You read Tolkien
What
Tolkien, the Hobbit books
Yeah
His descriptions of things are really good
Oh yeah
69 He makes you want to be there
The waves crash
Behind them, with no warning at all, a train shoots by
Tug stands with his hands jammed in his pockets, flashing lights and gleaming metal streaking and squealing behind him
'  - The clock radio blinks 5:34
The phone is ringing
Brendan half wakes and puts it to his ear
(on the phone) Don't go to class
What
Fifth period Trueman and the  come in asking for you
Agh
Did they call your mom
Probably
got home late
Get out of there too, then
Meet me behind the library
've got some stuff
- cold gray morning
The Brain hands Brendan a photocopy of a newspaper clipping, "  " Frisco Farr was found on a sidewalk outside Pinkerton's Deli three weeks ago
He was in a coma, his stomach contained a sausage sandwich, a horse dose of Heroin and traces of Choleric Tricemate, a poisonous chemical found in laundry detergent
Frisco's still under 70 and nobody's talking, so nothing's come of it
No, the chem the junk must have been cut with put him down
Huh
Bad junk
Bad brick
could that form of Heroin be called 'Brick'
No -- it was a concentrated powder, its street handle's 'whip' or 'rock' or 'brock'
(fishes a note from his pocket) Here
From Laura
told you to stay clear of Laura
You tell her to stay clear of me
He gives the note to Brendan, who unfolds it roughly
(mutters) gotta get voicemail
The note reads "Meet me at the southeast corner of the school at 9:30
" Brendan crumples it into a ball
(cont'd) No
Tell her 'll be at the Pin's at one
Any luck with the lug
No
The Brain lays out a local newspaper with Emily's picture - "  "
Uncomfortable silence
This isn't good
The Brain looks hard at him
Brendan stares off into space for a beat, then takes the Brain's cell phone and dials
71 (cont'd) (into phone) Mr
Trueman please
Brendan compares the two notes from his pocket with Laura's - distinct handwriting on each
(on the phone) This is Trueman
What the hell are you doing asking for me in class
What the hell are you doing out of class
What
(very deliberate) The  and  needed to ask you a few questions about Emily Kostich, who you might have heard is missing
It's a very serious thing
The police are involved
The  and  knew you two were close, so the  and  came to ask you questions, but you were truant
If you don't have a valid excuse- Brendan hangs up
What
've been cut loose
'm not safe here
We shouldn't have met in the open
Alright, lay low, but ask on the underneath for Dode
That's all that matters now, find Dode, but do it on the underneath, got it
What are you going to do
'd like to have played it safe, but there's no time
The Pin's not letting 72 anything drop, so  gotta push things a bit
How
don't know
Just find Dode
'  - The bird of prey mailbox looms ominously
Brendan knocks on the front door
No answer
He presses lightly on the screen door, and it gives
- Empty
Brendan crosses the warped linoleum and gently opens the narrow basement door
He descends into inky gloom
- Deathly still and silent
Barely breathing, Brendan goes to the lit doorway at the end of the hall
'  - Empty
Brendan floats through the room like a ghost, to the Pin's desk
Slowly, then with greater confidence he rifles through it - papers and trinkets, meaningless
He reaches beneath the desk, knocking it gently with his knuckles
Quickly he removes the top drawer and reaches down into the desk frame
Brendan draws out a stack of hundred dollar bills two inches thick
He pulls out another
Another
Another
Thumbing the stacks -- pure hundreds
Something creaks in the hallway
Brendan freezes
Silently he replaces the money and drawer, his eyes on the doorway
He creeps towards the door on the balls of his feet
- Still empty
Brendan creeps towards the stairs, passing other doorways, all open but for one
He stops for a moment, listening - silence
73 - Brendan enters the room - pitch black but for a small high window
Brendan pulls the curtains aside
beam of sunlight spills just enough light to reveal a figure in the dark
Brendan jumps back, and his reflection in the large mirror jumps as well
white bird nesting in the window flutters into the dark room
Brendan walks the large mirror into the beam of light, reflecting it around the room like a flashlight
More junk, a mattress, then a strangely bare corner with a single white lump in it
The white bird stands behind the lump, its dark eyes caught in the bare light
The bird flies out the window
Brendan goes to the white lump, a small brick of white powder
White chalky residue patterns the floor -- there were other bricks there before
Behind Brendan, in the mirror, something moves
Someone else, in the room
Tugger
He throws Brendan across the room, then heaves him into a wall
What with the poking, genius
Maybe you're poking for your bull friends
Don't be a sap
can't even face up at school, the 's so hot for me
Yeah well
Maybe you're looking to make good
'm looking to find this big game the Pin's played, not to gum it, but just so when its tail jams in my back 'll know who to bill for the embalming
You oughta ask him what you wanna know
did
He didn't tell me
74 Tug loosens his grip
Brendan gasps for air
(cont'd) When a gee 'm paid to side with won't give me the straight that makes me nervous
Makes me angry
Tug draws back a bit
Yeah, well
That's understandable
- Tug sets a country glass of orange juice in front of Brendan
He paces
There was ten of them
don't know where he picked them, he didn't tell me
(sympathetic) Huh
So we get ten kils of brock, there aint enough marks in the whole burgh to eat that
So he unloads eight of em up way north, even up to the docks
don't know who
Didn't tell you
Yeah
That was eight
So that's the tenth in there
We gotta break it into doses, sell em off round the high, maybe some by Shorecliffs
What about the ninth brick
Ah yeah
There were problems with that
Yeah
It, uh
75 He stops, thinking harder than he's used to
His scar reddens slightly, then he jerks out of his trance
(cont'd) (quickly) It disappeared
Someone skimmed it
We started raising hell with all the likely suspects, and whatayaknow, it came back
But it came back bad
One of ours took a dose off the top, and it laid him out
Frisco
Yeah, poor Frisco
You heard about that
We'll track down the rat
Just takes time
heard something fell with Emily Kostich
Emily who
Kostich
Don't know her
Huh
quiet pause
Tug's scar reddens a bit more
Has the Pin talked about her
Not to me
Yeah, he might know something
Ask him
Tell me what he says, cause if you heard something, you know,  wanna check
Sure
The screen door swings open -- enter the Pin
If he's surprised he doesn't show it
76 Pow wowing
Just shooting the shat
Yeah, just shooting it
Good
His big foot clunks on the linoleum
He eyes a very sick looking Brendan
(cont'd) You alright, soldier
Brendan moves a hand dismissively, sniffling
(cont'd) So, Tug,  got a call
Someone who says they know something about Emily
Emily
Emily Kostich
Where she's at now
Says we'd want to know
Wants to meet
(uncomfortable) Yeah
So we'll meet him
Four o'clock
(to Brendan) Emily was Tug's girl for awhile
You know Emily, didn't you
while back
You've heard she's missing
Yeah,  heard that
So maybe you want to come along too
77 What has Emily got to do with you
(looks at Tugger) Show, maybe we'll find out
He gives a slip of paper to Tugger
(cont'd) Four o'clock
Tugger glances at the slip, then slides it to Brendan
It has the symbol drawn in pencil: horn honks outside
That's my ride
The Pin calls after him as he leaves
Four o'clock
'  - Brendan falls into Laura's idling car
(roughly) payphone, anywhere
What- Brendan throws the car into drive, and they jerk forward
- The mobile customer you have called is away from the phone- Brendan slams the phone down violently and walks back towards the car
His legs quiver, and a coughing fit hits
78 Hacking and spluttering he falls to his knees
Laura's arms wrap around him, except it isn't Laura, it's Emily
Brendan spins backwards into Emily kissing his mouth, her hair around him, but it isn't her hair, it's Laura's
Brendan shoots upwards '   - and sits up with a jolt
Laid out in the back seat, Laura dabbing his head with a wet napkin
(barks shakily) What time is it
Lie down, Brendan- What time- You've got a fever, you've got to go to the hospital or- What time is it
Three forty
You've got to rest, you're feverish
He throws himself out of the car
- Brendan falls to his knees, coughing
Laura follows
Get back in the car, 'm taking you home, you're sick, you need- Shut up
Shut up
Shut up
He keeps yelling that until she does
His head spins
(cont'd) Okay, you've got to, what you've got to do is drive around to the Carrows lot
79 'll be up on the, the blacktop, the basketball field
So you've got to go by you or me to get down there
If you see anyone but the Pin or Tugger or their crew go down into the ravine, honk four times, long short long short
But don't be seen
Get back in the car
Do it
Will you do it
need you to do this
need you, here
Please
He holds her shoulders
beat, then her face registers resignation
- flat plane of pebbly asphalt with a dozen basketball courts faintly outlined across its surface
Brendan stands crooked, watching the barren horizon
The wind blows bitterly, and the sky is dark
Then, a speck
Coming towards Brendan, across the field
Brendan slumps towards it
Closer
Still a dark dot
Closer
Brendan's face snaps into recognition
What are you doing, Dode
Dode grins
He holds a newspaper
You gonna stop me
What do you think you're doing, Dode
saw you
saw what you did
What'd you see
saw you
What'd you see me
80 You were with her, dead, and you took the body
Yeah,  did
That's all you saw
What about before
Before what
Did you see who killed her before  got there
(face ashen) You killed her
found the body, Dode
You,  thought you didn't, but we figured out,  got the news on ya, cause you hid the body, why wouldn't- Who's 'we'
Shut up
You're always talking, always this and that smartso, you're gonna shut up now
didn't kill her, Dode
You're not going to talk this
Dode,  know you're thinking of Em, know you tried to help her- Shut up
You're gonna shut your Brendan staggers, the world blurs out for a moment, then snaps back
(cont'd) put it over real nice- 81 -so 'm telling you now you're in over your head, you don't want to put your hand in this- Dode shakes the newspaper at him
Shut up
She's dead, you- Why was she scared, Dode
She came to me, who was she scared of
think know why,  just gotta know who
Dode throws the paper, which scatters in the wind
You're trying to confuse me
Dode
You couldn't stand it
Your little Em
She was gonna keep it, it was mine, and you couldn't stand that
What was yours
had you pegged
What was yours
loved her
And  woulda loved the kid
'm gonna bury you
Brendan's face is empty
Dode walks stiffly away
Brendan puts a hand on his shoulder, but shrinks back in a coughing spasm
Dode grabs Brendan's wrist and hits him in the face
Brendan hits the pavement
82 - Bright clouds, sharp light
Emily flies towards us, glowing, then dimmer, her wings splutter out, the clouds turn gray, and we are looking at Emily's picture in the newspaper article
- Brendan pulls the newspaper off his face, lying in a fetal position
Dode is nowhere to be seen
Slowly, painfully, Brendan hoists himself up
He coughs and splutters, barely able to keep his footing
He limps across the field
Every step is agony
The wind blows against him
The black field seems impossibly long, still he keeps limping forward, towards the ravine
- Brendan slides down the embankment, landing on his feet
Gathered around the drain tunnel entrance are Tugger, the Pin, five of Tugger's flunkies and Dode in the middle
Everyone looks at Brendan
long silence
Brendan clears his throat
What'd  miss
More silence
Dode here says Emily Kostich is dead
Nobody reacts to that
Brendan's face is placid
Oh yeah
Yeah
He says he knows who did it
He says he knows where the body's at
(beat of silence) And he says he wants more money than think the information's worth
That so, Dode
(to the Pin) 83 So walk
What's the info have to do with you anyways
Plenty
Plenty, he says
Uh huh
And he wants cash on the nail
He's a pot skulled reef worm with more hop in his head than blood
Why pay for dirt you can't believe
You'll believe this
(shrugs) Maybe you will
You'll believe it, cause it's someone close to you
Real close
The Pin looks up at Brendan, whose face is loose and nonchalant
Maybe it's hot, but it's Dode, you can't trust it
Real close
Tugger's eyes are locked on Dode, his scar the color of raw liver
Brendan laughs and turns away
'm getting my shoes wet for this
Let him milk you if you want
(to Brendan) Stay
(to Dode) It's still too much
No it's not
You won't complain when you hear it
84 Tugger twists a stick in his hands
Brendan watches him, curious
(murmurs) So maybe you should
You had her against the wall with the brick - know my business
It's still too much
(with growing confidence) It's not, cause that's not why she was killed, and it's real important to you, cause the person who killed her's real close, and cause he's got a lot to lose, and he knows if  don't bury him by spilling to you  spill to the bulls and bury him for real, and he's really really scared - she had a kid in her and he couldn't stand - Tugger springs like a cat
He grabs Dode's hair and knees his face
Brendan stumbles towards them
Tug, it's alright
Tug has Dode on the ground, kicking his stomach and chest
Tug, stop
Tug backs off
Dode raises his head
Tug pulls the gun from his jacket
Brendan yells, slips and falls into the shallow water
Tug levels the gun at Dode's head and fires one shot
The back of Dode's skull comes off
The rapport reverberates through the black tunnel behind them, and birds fly out
Dode remains upright for a moment, then falls limp into the water
85 The Pin's face is stupid, lifeless
Tug turns to him, gun in hand
(cont'd) (thickly) Tug
Tugger fires - dirt kicks up, and the Pin scrambles back
Brendan crawls towards Tug, yelling for him to stop
Tug fires twice more, both misses, and the Pin is away
Distant sirens
Brendan's vision blurs
He stumbles and falls into the shallow water
: Spinning gently
Brendan's eyes open, watch it sleepily, then sharpen
'  - Brendan sits up in the bed
Tugger sits in a chair bedside, smoking
Brendan watches him for a long moment in the room's dim light
She sprung it on me, just
That's a hell of a thing to spring on a guy
don't remember much
Laura talked me down after, said whatever, she knew her, said it wasn't true, but  still think sometimes
think bout it being true
Bout it being mine
And maybe  did it cause  thought it was true
hell of a thing
Brendan stares at him through cold, empty eyes
(cont'd) You up
You weren't doing too good there for awhile
Laura said take you, you know, hospital, but  couldn't
What's the stats
86 Everyone's just laying low
You're here with us, at my folks place
They're gone
The bulls got Dode fore the tide took his body
Tide
Yeah, strong tide, would've taken the body, like out to sea
It can do that
But the fuzz got there first
Brendan nods
(cont'd) So everyone's assuming it's war, but no one's said it yet
Everyone's lying low
War
You're with us
The hell  am
Brendan swings his legs over the bed
Tug steps in front of him, staring him down
(cont'd) Alright, 'm with you
So just lie low
Sleep some more
Laura, she said you should sleep
Tugger exits
Brendan runs his fingers through his hair, steps into his shoes and hobbles out of the room
'   - About ten more kids dressed like Tug are cleaning guns
Brendan nods to them
Hey
87 They nod back, not paying much attention as he goes out the front door
- On a lamplit street corner Brendan leans against a payphone
(on phone) Brendan
Yeah
Are you - what, man, have you heard about Dode- was there
You- Where were you yesterday
called
Kasprzyk took my phone, turned it off just now got it back
Alright, listen- Are you okay
Just listen
Is my name in the papers with the story
No
Alright
Is it just Dode in the papers
Yeah
What do you mean
88 Listen, 'm going to be calling you tonight, probably late
Sleep with your phone on
Could you get a car if you needed to
If it's late enough  could take my mom's- Be ready then
'll call
Alright
- Brendan kicks in the door
Kara sits in front of the mirror in a soft pink robe, a boy on the floor beside her
She gasps
Brendan
Did you hear about Dode
You scheming tramp
You set that poor kid up, you hid him, fed him your tale
You got info from Laura and held Dode like a card till you could play him
For money
Brendan throws a chair
The boy stands
don't know what you're talking about
You'd bury me at the same time, but it was mostly for the money
You got Dode thinking Em had his kid, thinking  did it, and that was enough for him, but he stuck to the money cause you had your claws in him, cause he couldn't come away from the deal without it and make you happy
Sit down, you're a mess
Russ, go get my shoes from the wardrobe locker, would you sweetie
89 He goes, trying to look mean at Brendan
Brendan and Kara watch each other like caged rats
(cont'd) Still wish you knew what you wanted to know
If it's any consolation, it probably wasn't Dode's kid
It might have been Tug's, but frankly  wouldn't bet a horse - it was a crowded field there at the end
Brendan grabs a clock and throws it
Kara's mirror shatters, revealing a grimy dark wall behind
(cont'd) Meany
You want my tale, Brendan still know what Dode was selling, but 'd play it smart
quick call from a payphone to copland, they drag the tunnel and you're through
She comes very close to him
Her robe falls open slightly
(cont'd) Five thousand
Cash
know you can get it from the Pin, but even if you can't want it by first period tomorrow, or play my hand and bury you
She turns away, lets her robe fall
1 (cont'd) Now get out
Brendan's eyes burn
He lunges at her
- Drama geeks sit in groups
The dressing room door flies open and Kara flies out, stark naked
Brendan flies out after her
What are you doing
Showing your ace
Brendan storms out
Also on the
Fine retailers everywhere
90 '  - Brendan walks past the bird of prey mailbox
voice from the screen door - Far enough
The Pin
Everyone's paying social calls
Laura here
Beat of silence
So
So what are the stats
The stats are war, soon as the press heat dies
And if you're with him, you're with him
Tug got hot
He panicked
Tug's been after my digs from the get go
No
He's been anxious cause he thought if you found out he killed Emily you'd turn him over
He was right
Yeah, well
told him to get the straight, no roughing
wasn't even there
91 Alright
So he's a hot head
So you don't want him on your side, at least let's have a pow wow fore we start digging trenches
Maybe we can all walk away amiable enemies
What would it take
don't know
We'd have to square everything between us
He owes me some money
Alright, but we can talk
Yeah, alright
Four o'clock
Tomorrow
Tonight
Let's clear it all before it boils up again
Four tonight
You'll be here
Yeah
Brendan turns away
() Wait
She comes out of the house with her purse
(cont'd) 'll drive you back
'  -  - Laura drives, Brendan stares at the passing lights
What's going to happen
Brendan coughs
92 (cont'd) Do you feel better
(weak) don't know
'   - Brendan stumbles in
Tug's hands grab him roughly
For a smart guy you aint too smart said lay low
Laura enters
Tug
He drops Brendan
Laura kneels beside Brendan, feeling his forehead
She was at the Pin's
Yeah, she's our go-between
Uh huh
So here's the sit
You and the Pin are going to pow wow, four o'clock tonight, his place
Take all the muscle you want, you won't need it
He wants to talk straight, and you're going to work with him for whatever he needs, cause you don't want war
Hell  don't
The Pin's sitting on the brick profits - hitting him now would be post
Make peace and wait for your chance
He's right, Tug
Smooth it out
93 (between coughs) Besides, he's got you on the Dode thing
War'll mean you vs
him and every bull in the burgh
Tugger turns away, thinking
Yeah, we'll talk
(to Brendan) You going
Yeah
She nods
Brendan stumbles into the bedroom
'  - Brendan lies on his back
Sweat stands on his forehead
Spinning dizzily from Brendan's
Then the fan is still and the room is spinning, then the fan, then the room
Brendan clamps his eyes shut
door creaks open
(croaks) Go away
Laura floats across the room to him
Her hair falls around him
Brendan shrinks back
She puts a pale hand on his clammy forehead
Brendan tries to speak, but cannot
He fingers slide over his face
She pulls off his glasses
Her hands all over his face
Brendan's throat contorts in a hard swallow
His eyes are wet
Her hair, her hands all warm and gentle, touching him
'm sorry Brendan
Brendan breaks
In silent sobs first, then shivering with an almighty release he cries like a baby in her arms
94 Spinning above them
Laura lights a cigarette
They lie beside each other
Don't go tonight
've got to make sure it plays out smooth
It'll play however it plays without you there
've got to make sure
Why
Cause if there's war, 'm in it too
Well let's just,  mean why not just run away
Go somewhere
've got a car
(Brendan gives a wry look) 've got an aunt in New Orleans, she wouldn't care
(Brendan grins) Yeah, it's a stupid thing, but think about it, why not
What, school
'mon
Family
Alright, stop
Her smoke drifts into the fan
wasn't serious, but we could go for awhile
Just until everything clears
Brendan watches the smoke
She stubs the butt out in an ash tray on the table and curls against his chest
Stretching his arm across the table, he nonchalantly spins the ash tray around with his finger
His glasses lay on the table
Through the left lens the cigarette is magnified
Pale blue arrow on the filter
95 Laura's arm stretches across his chest
He looks at it, then up at the fan, spinning
Brendan slips out of bed
glowing clock radio reads "3:16"
'   - swarm of silent activity
Tug's flunkies prepare various weapons
Brendan goes to Tug
Tell your boys no knuckle business
They're just ready
Your folks left a car here
Yeah
Take it and Laura's
(Brendan tosses Tug the keys) 'll go first in yours
The hell- 'll take the scenic route to draw off any tailers
They'll think it's you, they might even radio back that you're alone
Get it
Mr
Smarts
He tosses Brendan his keys
Alright
Got a cigarette
No
don't smoke
've seen you smoke
96 don't smoke cigarettes
Give me fifteen minutes, then go
'  - Brendan slides into the black mustang and gutters off into the night
- Overlooking a twinkling valley of suburban lights
Brendan talks at a payphone beside the curbed mustang
(on phone) Yeah
Alright,  warned you
Can you get the car
Yeah
Go to 2014 Clancy, off Pico west of La Grange
Park outside and wait
Laura's inside
She hasn't got a car, but if she blows on foot or gets a pick, tail her
Alright
(silence) Alright
Okay
'll call you when it gets light
(silence) Thanks, Brain
, Brain hangs up
'  - Brendan pulls the mustang into the driveway, limps up to the front door and knocks
One of the Pin's boys lets him in
97 - Crowded with tense looking punks, half dressed like the Pin and half like Tugger
The Pin's mom is shuffling about, pouring them milk
- Several more punks from both camps crowd the hall, and more lean in the darkened doorways
Brendan passes through quickly
'  - The Pin at his desk, flanked by two of his boys
Tug sits in the center of the room, two of his punks beside him
Brendan saunters between them and leans against the dresser
Talk
want full assurance that any heat from Emily and Dode is gonna be on just you
don't even want my name pulled in the shindig
Second, you owe me six Cs, no rush, but  want your shake that it'll come home in not too much time
Tug's eyes burn, his scar reddens
(to Tug) That's square
You did them after all
Lay low it'll blow over
Stick on this, one of you'll dish it to bury the other and you'll both get the rap
As to the six, did you borrow it
Yeah
Then you owe it
Shouldn't need a shake on that
Tug looks at the Pin
Alright to both
98 Good
Let's seal it up and blow for keeps
Third thing
The last brick
Brendan looks up sharply, taken off guard
It's yours
That aint the point
'm gonna start selling it
How do  know it aint bad
Why would it be
Why was the last one
Cause someone got greedy
Tug here's had the means to swipe half and cut it bad for a long time
Now we're splits my loss of trust's retroactive
Did you, Tug
(eyes hot on the Pin) No
Alright, so let's shake and blow
Not good enough
Tug shoots to his feet, kicking away his chair
What would be good enough
wanna see him dose it
Just to prove it
Then we're square
Hell for that
didn't touch your junk, that's it
99 wanna see it
To hell
Your not wanting to dose it's telling me something right here
Yeah, it better be
It's telling that 'm out from your thumb, that  aint playing lapdog to no gothed up cripple no more
Everyone in the room is on their feet
Brendan steps forward
'll dose it
All eyes to him, unbelieving
What
If it'll shut you two apes up 'll   take the dose, and if  don't die we're   all right as rain, and if  do die you   two have your war, so long as you keep   it off my grave
Deal
Fine
Tangles
Johnny, go with him
They go
Tug just stares at Brendan, then tosses his hands up slightly and turns away
They all wait
from the next room
Everyone freezes
More breaking, then scuffling and shouting
The two punks look at their bosses, then run out
Tug starts to follow, but Brendan holds him back
100 The noise through the wall grows tremendous, a full brawl
The ceiling pounds and shudders with footfalls and bodies hitting the ground
Then, from not too far away, a gunshot
The Pin stands and goes towards the door, but Brendan shouts (cont'd) No
and slams it shut
few tense seconds
Another gunshot
Footfalls, then Tangles falls through the door, his chest red
The Pin bends over him
(gasping) The brick, it's gone
The brick's gone
Tangles stops gasping
The Pin stands, eyes blazing at Tug
Make peace, huh
Talk it out
Get your boys in my den soes you could snag it under my nose
Tug's scar is fiery red
He coils his body, snarling
Alright
No, that's not- Was it bad, Tug
Snag it so  don't know, or sell it off to flat the war odds
(shouts) Pin, think about it- Alright,  did all that
Tug blows past Brendan like a train and slams the Pin into the ground with his fist
He punctuates his words with hard straight blows into the Pin's face
101 (cont'd) cut the brick,  stole the money, faked a peace,  snagged your junk, did it all
He pulls the gun
Brendan shouts and throws himself on Tug's arm, wrenching it sideways
The gun clunks onto the carpet
The Pin flips Tug   over and for a moment Brendan is caught between them, hit   and torn, rolling over the gun
Tug grabs it, Brendan grabs   his wrist and the gun goes off, firing into the ceiling
Plaster sprays
Brendan screams, thrashing wildly, and manages to slip out of his bloodied jacket and out from between the two
The Pin is on top, pinning Tug's gun hand to the carpet, straining to keep it there
Brendan leaps to his feet, staggers, then winds up and kicks Tug in the wrist with all his strength
terrible crunching popping sound
Tug roars
Brendan takes the gun from his limp hand
Do him
Brendan backs off a few steps
The Pin strains to keep Tug down
(cont'd) Do him now
Brendan stumbles back
Tug roars, flips the Pin over and beats his face mercilessly
Brendan stumbles out into the hall
- Empty
From the darkened doorways and the thin ceiling relentless sounds of fighting
Brendan walks backwards as if in a trance, eyes glued to the Pin's door
Inside wild shadows splay across the walls, and the Pin shouts Brendan's name
Light flashes from another darkened doorway and the wall beside Brendan splinters
Brendan spins on his heel and fires three shots into the darkness, which falls silent
102 He turns the gun back on the Pin's doorway
With a spray of sparks the doorway turns dark
They broke the lamp
The dark doorway looms up before Brendan, inky black
Horrible sounds come from it, blows, breaking bone, screams
The Pin screams Brendan's name over and over, calling for help
Pleading
Brendan steps back
Time slows down
Brendan drops the gun
It thunks on the carpet
In one motion Brendan kicks the gun down the hall into the Pin's doorway, turns and runs into the room where he found the brick
Dark
Brendan runs through, clawing past dark fighting shapes, running like a man possessed
He breaks through the darkness and heaves himself up through the small window
'  - Brendan scrambles out, slips on the grass and hits the ground hard
Two sharp gunshots come from the house
Everything is suddenly still
Brendan stands slowly
He notices a light from the Mustang - the trunk has drifted open
Inside, a pale blue arm lies tangled in black plastic
Blue fingernails
Cheap plastic bracelets
Brendan shuts the trunk solidly, then walks off down the street and vanishes into the inky night
moment later police cars pull up, sirens blaring, lights turning the dark streets bright as day
: - The morning is cold and clammy
Brendan slumps against the payphone
103 Hey
Where are you
(on phone) Library
Where are you
Did she blow last night
No
Stayed there till six thirty, then walked to school
You didn't give her a ride, did you
No
But she came straight to school from Tug's
Yeah
She there now
Yeah
Not with me, but here
Alright
Tell her  wanna meet up on the basketball field in half an hour, then go home and get some sleep
Alright
Brendan hangs up, then pauses, lost in thought
- Brendan sits against the massive gym building, writing on a piece of looseleaf paper
- Brendan slips the paper under a door stenciled " Offices"
104 - Cold, barren
Wind whistles softly and jangles the metal mesh basketball nets like windchimes
Brendan stands crookedly, hands in pockets, eyes trained on the cold black horizon
speck appears
Brendan waits for it, bracing himself against the wind
Laura
She puts her arms around him, a warm embrace
Brendan draws back
(softly) Did you see it all
With Tug and the Pin
Brendan looks at her a moment
No
took your advice and didn't go
(confused) No
What happened
Laura looks at him strangely, a little uneasy
The papers say six dead, three around the house, one girl in the trunk of Tug's car, and the Pin and Tug
Brendan's face is frozen in an ambiguous frown
Yeah
Tug tried to shoot his way out when the police got there
They tied him to Dode, too
Same gun
And the girl
Huh
Well good thing you weren't there
105 Yeah
Laura's face softens a bit
You think the girl was Emily
Probably
Laura embraces him again, and doesn't let go
You loved her
(distant) Yeah  did
You did all this cause you loved her
And now it's finished
(tightens her embrace) love you
No
Laura pulls back, looks at his face
It is a mask
What
No, it's not finished
Tug pulled the trigger on Em and he got the fall, but the bulls coulda found that out without me
Laura pulls back more
(cont'd) set out to know who put her in the spot, who put her in front of the gun
That was you, angel
(drifting back further) What are you talking about
106 It was you
What, you want the whole tale
You want me to tell it to you
(bewildered) Tell it to me
Alright, from the top
You had your fingers in Brad Bramish for appearances and to keep him buying from the Pin, who you were hooked with
Emily came to you and Brad, you saw her for what she was, an insecure little girl trying to get in
She goes on the backburner
Meanwhile maybe you're getting bored, maybe just greedy, so when the Pin scores big with the bricks you take your shot
You hook one, take half, and cut it back to size, but you cut it bad
Maybe accidentally, maybe to down the Pin's operation, doesn't matter
You put it back, but poor Frisco doses off it and lands in a coma
(voice strengthening) So now the Pin's fuming, maybe he's jealous of Brad, so he comes to Brad's crowd looking for blood, or at least a scape
You know trouble
There's going to be a war over this
And there's Emily
She trusts you
She wants in
It's duck soup
(murmurs) No
You frame her for the bad brick, then you cut her loose
You turn on your heel and bite her in the throat
Last week on the payphone, Pico and Alexander, she saw something she was scared of
Tug's car driving by, the Pin driving, but she wouldn't have seen the Pin
No, she was across the street, angel
She saw the passenger side
She saw you
She saw you and ran like she saw some devil
Laura's face is very still, quivering
107 Brendan, why are you- And she took the hit
Dode hid her away, but the Pin was on to her, tracked her down, told her to meet him, that they would make good
Gave her a time, and a place
And sent Tug
Just to get the straight
But maybe you had talked Tug up, or maybe he just blew a fuse, but Em sprung it on him that she had her kid, and he did what anyone could count on Tug doing - he hit her
She took the hit for you
You let her take it
Stop it
That's the tale
Stop it
You're going to tell me it's not
It's not
Look at me
She crumples against him, looking him straight in the eye
You know me
've only helped you
How can you - It isn't true
She sobs through a tensed, straight face
Brendan holds her stare, but his eyes are distant
hope it isn't
want you to have been on my side all along, not just trying to get me under your thumb like Brad and the Pin and Tug
No- 108 But  think you knew that meeting was going to blow up
think that was your final play
But  hope 'm wrong
hope everything  wrote in the note  dropped at Gary Trueman's office this morning is wrong
About your and Brad's involvement in the Pin's runnings
hope you didn't steal the brick last night
In your purse
(breathes) didn't
That's good
That means you didn't let me walk into a slaughterhouse
You didn't lead Tug and the Pin and their crews to the slaughter
And when Trueman reads the note, takes my cue and searches your locker, he won't find a damn thing
Something changes in Laura's eyes
- Trueman and several other men force Laura's locker open
From its dark interior the chalky white brick falls out, spins through the air, and shatters silently on the locker cage floor
- moment of silence between them
The basketball nets jangle
Laura steps back
She looks as if she has been punched in the face
(murmurs) Brendan
don't
(gently) It's done
Her face does strange things, subtle contortions
She watches his eyes
He doesn't look at her
Her voice shakes
109 Done
Well
That's most of it
9 out of 10
told Em to tell Tug it was his
Told her it would soften him up
She said she wished she could keep it, but she didn't love the father
was going to drive her down the next day, we'd found a doctor
Most wouldn't
She was starting to show
3 months
You know whose kid that makes it, or have you known all along
Slowly, steadily, she straightens up
Her figure takes back some dignity
She steps towards him deliberately
Closer
Right up against him
She brings her head to his, puts her lips to his ear, breathes warm breath, and says two words
The first is (cont'd) Mother- the second is low, guttural and lost to the whistling wind
She turns and walks briskly away
Brendan watches her go across the dark, barren field of asphalt
Metal jangles
Brendan turns to see the Brain hopping a chain link fence
Brendan turns his eyes back on Laura
You get your straight
Yeah
wouldn't have- 'alright
Yeah, well
Chuck Burns came to
The knife guy
Spilled it all to the bulls, guess Brad Bramish hired him
On his own, just a grudge thing
(nods slightly) Fits
You did good, Brain
Go sleep
Yeah, you too
110 The Brain starts to walk away, but turns back
(cont'd) What'd she whisper to you
She called me a dirty word
Alright, you don't have to tell me
Thick
As what-all
Brendan stands alone on the asphalt field, watching Laura until she reaches the end of the field and walks off behind a twisted chain linked fence
The first period bell rings, and Brendan walks back towards campus
