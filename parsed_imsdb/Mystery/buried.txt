Written by Chris Sparling : - Darkness
Silence
After a long beat, we hear movement, confined and contained
We then hear the sound of a man,  , groaning, making confused attempts at words
We hear his movement; short, abrupt shifting, ending almost immediately with the sound of his body banging against wood
He screams, though it's clear from the sound that his mouth is covered by something
After attempting to sit up, he immediately bangs his head against something
It's terribly warm and his breaths are labored
He attempts to move to his left and right, only to find that he is confined on those sides, as well
He frantically shifts about, only to discover, by touch, that he is encased in something
Something is very wrong, and he doesn't need to see to know that
Finally, we see him, lit by the flame of the Zippo he holds in his hands, which are bound together in front of him with rope
rolled-up, dirty rag is tied tightly around his head, stretched across his mouth
Dried blood stains his hair and forehead
We see that he is lying in an old fashioned, wooden coffin
Nothing more than a few rotted-out planks of wood nailed together
Realizing the same, Paul is struck by an overwhelming, instant panic
With great difficulty, and while still holding the lit Zippo, Paul removes the muzzle from his mouth
What
What is this
His words become almost unintelligible as he flails about, though fear is understood in his every utterance
He screams aloud, but his voice is captured by the coffin walls
2
Oh my God
Help me
Help me
He kicks and slams his hands against the top and sides of the coffin, all to no avail
His violent movements cause small grains of sand to trickle in through the space between the sides and top of the coffin, as well as a small gap that exists between one of the coffin's broken wooden planks
Sweat cascades down the side of his neck, dripping from his dampened brow
The heat inside the extremely close confines of the coffin is stifling
(') Somebody help me
Please
Paul continues with his futile efforts to pry off the top of the coffin
The sides, the top, the bottom -- all are too thoroughly reinforced by the force of what surrounds the coffin
Sand
It becomes clear to him that he is buried
He tries his best to calm himself, though he has trouble catching his breath
It takes him some time, but he eventually achieves some semblance of calm
Getting a good look at him for the first time, we see that Paul is somewhere around 37 years old
Unshaven and physically unremarkable, he embodies the blue-collar American everyman
He coughs
The minimal amount of oxygen in the coffin makes it hard for him to breathe
His eyes widen a bit upon seeing an exposed, rusty nail
He tries desperately to use the nail to cut through the old, frayed ropes that bind his hands
Doing so is no easy task
The incredibly tight quarters makes his every action nearly impossible
After a lengthy struggle, the rope snaps
Paul quickly frees his hands
small victory
Very small
The heat is unbearable
Paul takes off his button-down shirt, leaving him in a -shirt
His body battles against the walls and the ceiling of the coffin with every move he makes
He tosses his button-down shirt down by his feet
His undershirt is drenched through with sweat
Still trying to calm himself, but having little success in doing so, Paul looks around the coffin
His feet, though only his body-length away, seem miles from him
3
He looks at the top of the coffin, and then back at his feet
With great difficulty, he shifts his body so that his feet are pressed against the top of the coffin
He attempts to use his leg strength to push the top off of him, but it doesn't move even a millimeter
After several failed attempts, and with his legs exhausted, Paul drops his feet from the top of the coffin
He lay for a moment in silence, followed by an outburst of crying
Close to his head, on the corner of the floor, we see there's another broken plank
small hole
He closes his cigarette lighter, extinguishing the flame
In total darkness, he continues to cry
(') What is this
With his sobbing slowly subsiding, the coffin soon grows eerily silent
The sound of Paul's labored breaths are all we hear, softened under the blanket of absolute darkness
After a beat, the silence is interrupted by a subtle buzzing sound
The muted sight of strange, blueish light flickers in the coffin, by Paul's feet
He is extremely startled
The buzzing continues, as does the minimal splashing of light
It's coming from underneath his discarded button-down shirt, down near his feet
He lights the Zippo to get a better look
Pulling the shirt away, he realizes that what he is hearing and seeing is the vibrating ring and display features of an older model cell phone
He frantically reaches for it, though the coffin is far too small for him to reposition himself so easily
To his dismay, the phone stops ringing
But, his efforts to reach it continue
He uses his feet to search for the phone
After some trouble finding it, he eventually locates it
Clamping the phone together between his clasped feet, Paul then painfully angles his body so that he can reach his feet with his hands and grab it
He is soon able to reach it
Immediately thereafter, he flips open the phone and puts the receiver in front of him
4
We see that there is a Text Message waiting for Paul on the phone
However, Paul barely notices
The time on the phone reads 6:12pm
While the numbers and display screen icons are familiar to Americans, all the words are in Arabic
What he does notices is that the phone barely has one bar of signal strength
Worse yet, there is only half of the battery life remaining
He tries to remember the Safe Number he was given
With the phone open and ready to be dialed, Paul struggles to recall the information
(') Come on, come on
What was it
Getting only two digits into dialing the number, he cannot remember much more and closes the phone
He wedges the lit Zippo into sand, which is compacted against a small hole in the wall of the coffin
Paul reaches into his pants pocket, frantically searching for something
He hastily removes a prescription pill bottle and a small, metal flask
Both are not what he was looking for
He then reaches to his back pocket and removes his wallet
It's empty
His license, his credit cards, his cash and, most importantly at that very moment, a piece of paper with the Safe Number written on it, are all missing
(') No
Where the hell is it
Son of a
Come on
He screams aloud again, hoping greatly that someone can hear him
His frenzied maneuvering puts out the flame of the Zippo
(') Help me
Please
Somebody help me
His words barely make it pass the coffin walls
With the cell phone still in hand, and laboring to reclaim the breath he just expended, Paul turns to desperation
He dials the international code of 001, and then dials 911
911  answers almost immediately
5
911 911, please hold
The Female 911 Operator places Paul on hold
No
Wait
Paul accidentally bangs the cap of the Zippo against the coffin wall, putting out the flame
She quickly returns
911 911
What is your emergency
Hello
911 911

Paul is so incredibly panicked that he has trouble remaining coherent
After a few sparks, the Zippo is re-lit

Sheriff's Department
No

( ) forget it
Realizing that his conversation is both lengthy and useless, Paul ends the call
He checks the battery life on the phone
It still holds steady at two bars
He immediately dials another number, one that he can recall with ease
He again enters the 001 international code before making the call
Paul then dials his home phone
It rings several times, so far unanswered
Come on, come on
Pick up
Please
After sitting through the agony of a few more rings, Paul is met with the answering machine
The voice of his young son, , is heard on the answering machine greeting
Thanks for calling the Conroy's
We're not home right now
Please leave a message at the beep
Thanks
At the sound of the Beep, Paul leaves a frenzied, rambling message
Linda, honey, it's me
Listen, need you to contact the National Guard right away
Or the Pentagon
Tell them we were attacked in the Diyala Provence, in Baqubah
() 9
(') They have to find me
Please help me, baby
Please help them find me
Paul hangs up
He dials his wife's cell phone right away
After several rings, her cell phone voice mail picks up
We hear the sound of Linda, Paul's wife, on her outgoing message
Hi, this is Linda
Please leave a message
Thanks and have a great day
The Beep sounds and Paul immediately tears into his voice message
Linda, it's Paul
need you to call me right away
This is an absolute emergency
Call the number that comes up on your phone
Call me at that number
If  don't answer, call the Pentagon or the don't know what the hell is going on, but 'm buried in a box
Hearing himself say those last words gives him pause
The gravity of the situation fully takes hold
(') can't breathe in here
Make sure you call me right away
Please, baby, please call me
Paul ends the call
He nervously looks at the amount of battery life remaining on the phone
Still holding strong at two bars
He notices the flickering light of the Zippo
It, too, appears to be using up small amounts of oxygen
He closes the lid, extinguishing the flame
Total darkness
Silence, save for Paul's increasingly heavy breaths
He begins to hyperventilate
He knows that preserving oxygen is paramount, so he does his best to calm himself
The healthy swig he takes from his flask helps
10
He flips open the cell phone
The light of the display screen partially illuminates his face and some of the coffin with a blueish hue
Paul again enters the overseas dialing code, this time dialing 411 information
The 411  answers
411 What city and state, please
Um

Paul reaches for his button-down shirt
Fishes for pens stashed in his lapel pocket, while keeping the phone pressed to his ear with his shoulder

don't care, any city
Just connect me to the

Paul writes the digits of the phone number on the top of the coffin with his pen
But, after the first three numbers, the pen stops working
He hurriedly reaches back into his shirt pocket to remove the other pen, which is actually a click-up pencil
Click-click-click-click
He writes the last seven digits, followed by the word "

He presses the number one and is connected directly
After a few rings,    answers

Special Agent Harris

May  have your name please, sir
Paul Conroy
(saying it as he writes it ) Paul Conroy
(back on the phone) Okay, Paul, explain to me what's going on
12
Paul attempts to center himself so that he can accurately tell his story
Alright
Me and a convoy of other drivers were delivering kitchen parts to a community center
As we got closer, a bunch of kids started throwing rocks at our trucks
Then an  went off up ahead and blew up one of the other trucks
These guys came out from behind the houses with guns and started shooting everybody right there on the street
Were you shot at

must have got hit in the head with one of the rocks and got knocked out
That's the last thing  remember
But now just woke up, and  was tied up and buried in a coffin
Who put you there
guess whoever ambushed us
Special Agent Harris sounds slightly skeptical of Paul's claims
bunch of kids
No, you're not listening
The kids threw the rocks at us, but then some Iraqi guys -- maybe insurgents,  don't fucking know -- popped out of nowhere and started shooting at us
thought you said they didn't shoot at you
13
They didn't,  don't know
But they shot them
Sir, you're going to have to stop shouting if -- 'm shouting because you're not listening
need you to help me
Please
Hmmm
Paul takes a moment to center himself
Can you trace my call
or something
Why is it that they didn't shoot you
have no idea
They didn't, that's all  know
What's your social security number, Paul
Why
Who cares
'm buried in the middle of the fucking desert
Who cares what my social security number is

Just send someone to find me
Do you know where you're lo

The cell phone starts breaking up
Hello
What
can't hear you
Bet

near
14
Suddenly, Special Agent Harris is not heard at all
Hello
Hello
Paul checks the phone's display, where he sees that the call has been lost
(') Shit
Cell phone service temporarily goes down
Paul lights the Zippo to help him see the cell phone screen
He tries to make a call, but nothing happens
He shakes the phone, moves it around the coffin, all in desperate hope that he will get a signal
He soon does
He looks at the number for the
that he has written on the wall, thinking about calling them back
He then checks the battery life on his phone, which remains at two bars
Paul then decides to make a different call, this time to a phone number he has committed to memory: his employer back in the
, Crestin, Roland and Thomas ()
He closes the lid of the Zippo, extinguishing the flame
After a few rings, a   answers
Thank you for calling Crestin, Roland and Thomas
How may direct your call
Somebody,  need to talk to someone right away
It's an emergency
Who is this, please
Paul Conroy

'm going to put you through to Alan Davenport
Davenport
Who's that
Director of Personnel
Please hold
Personnel
No,  need to talk -- Paul is placed on hold
Synthesized soft rock plays in the background of the phone, maddening Paul further
Over the music, a   is heard, speaking a recorded testimonial during the on-hold message
At , we work with our clients to provide effective and sustainable solutions to the challenges they face in our fast-growing, global economy
As the premiere
The message is interrupted by  's outgoing voice message
You've reached Alan Davenport, personnel director at Crestin, Roland and Thomas
Please leave your name and number at the tone and  will return your call as soon as possible
The  sounds
Paul is confused as to why he was patched through to someone in human resources, but leaves a message nevertheless
16
This is Paul Conroy, 'm from Hastings, Michigan

by insurgents or terrorists

Please send help
'm begging you

Please send help right away can't breathe in here can't
please
'm begging you
don't know who else to call
Paul notices that his phone has again lost signal
(') () fuck
Paul drops the phone to his side, the screen still emitting its glow
He explodes with a mixture of rage and fear
He screams and flails his feet and hands wildly, banging them against the walls of the coffin
His animalistic outburst causes the phone to close
The coffin returns to pitch black
After a long beat, Paul lights the Zippo, which remains wedged in the sand compacted against the small hole in the wall of the coffin
Paul takes a few moments to catch his breath
He looks again at the cell phone
Remembers receiving a Text Message
The icon on the phone's display indicates that he does, in fact, have an unread Text Message waiting for him
Paul quickly scrolls through the phone's menu, which is all written in Arabic, until he reaches what appears to be the Text Message option
Opening it, he sees a series of ten numbers
Using his click-up pencil, he scribbles the numbers onto the top of the coffin
Next to the number, he writes the word "
" Noticing that his phone has again picked-up a signal, he dials the number
17
It rings once, but then the reception begins to falter
After only two rings, the call is ended
Paul's frustration mounts
He is barely able to fight off another fit of hysterics
He dials the number again
It rings once
second ring
In the middle of the third ring, someone answers -- but they do not say anything
Hello
Hello
Is anyone there
Hello
After a beat, Paul hears breathing on the other end of the phone
He also hears a discordance of background sound; the din of a room filled with Arabic-speaking men
(') Hello
Who are you
Please, you have to help me
Still, Paul's words are only met with slow, measured breaths
(') Who is this
Hello
The person on the other end eventually speaks
An Iraqi man, , talks forcefully and aggressively in broken English
Breathe no breathe, American
Ah
Breathe no breathe
What
don't know what you're saying
Who is this
American can breathe no breathe
No,  can't breathe
Please get me out of here
Get out
Yes, please get me out
Help me
Soldier
18
No, no 'm not a soldier
'm a truck driver
That's it
'm not a soldier
'm a contractor
Contractor
Yes, that's right
contractor
Not a soldier
Blackwater
No, not for Blackwater
'm not a security contractor
Truck driver, 'm a truck driver
That's all
You are American
Yes
Then you are soldier
Despair falls upon Paul
It becomes clear that Jabir is responsible for all of this
As such, Paul crosses out the word "
" Closes the lid of the Zippo, leaving only the cell phone display screen to illuminate his face
No, 'm not
'm here unarmed
But, you still shot at us
In head and in throat, so you tell no more lies
'm not lying
We were all drivers
Drive what
Trucks
The big trucks you see driving around with the supplies
That's us
That's me
We're not soldiers
19
Five million money
What
Five million money tonight by nine or you stay
Buried like dog
Five million dollars
From who
Your family
My family doesn't have five million dollars
If they did,  wouldn't be here
From Embassy
don't know, yes, the Embassy will pay you
If you let me go, they'll pay you the money
Silence on the other end of the phone
(after a long beat) Nine , five million money
Jabir hangs up the phone, forcing Paul to instantly come to grips with the fact that he is being held hostage
He lays back in the coffin, shell-shocked
Physically spent, the cell phone falls from his hands and onto the floor
The display screen casts a dim light throughout the coffin
: - The Zippo lights
Paul holds it in his hand, using it to illuminate the inside of the coffin
He attempts to push it into its now customary resting place, but the sand has loosened, making it difficult for the Zippo to stay in place
It almost falls to the floor
20
Looking around, Paul sees there is a crack between two planks, located on the opposite wall of the coffin
He wedges the lit Zippo into the crack
With his hands now free, Paul haphazardly positions himself so that his back is facing the top of the coffin
His every move is arduous; the claustrophobic nature of the coffin bearing down on him
Paul positions his bent knees underneath his chest, with his shins and feet pressed against the bottom of the coffin
Using the strength of his legs, he attempts to lift the top off the coffin with his back
Trickles of sand fall in from the side of the coffin, sprinkling against the wooden base
He fails, only to immediately try again
And again
And again
Exhaustion sets in
Staring ahead, the phone sits in front of him
He notices that the battery life bars are still at one solid and one blinking
He grabs the cell phone, staring at it, trying to think of someone else to call
The battery life is limited
Every call has to count
He tries to remember some phone numbers, but has trouble recalling the information
( ) Come on, what's her number
He cannot remember the number he's thinking of
He notices that the flame of the Zippo flickers, indicating its use of his much-needed oxygen
Paul closes the lid, extinguishing the flame
second later, we see him, lit by the cell phone display screen
He dials the international code for the United States, followed by 411 information
411  answers
411 What city and listing, please

Paul is switched to an
The number you requested, 269-948- 1998 can automatically be dialed for a charge of twenty-five cents by pressing the number one
Paul writes Donna's number and name on the top of the coffin and then presses the number one
He is connected
Her phone rings and rings
Paul's frustration is evident
Come on
Where the hell is everyone
The phone rings some more
Paul checks the battery life -- still at one and a half bars
eventually answers
Hello
Hearing her voice, Paul hurriedly places the phone to his ear
Donna, it's Paul
Hey, how's it going
22
Where's Linda
She's not answering her phone
need to talk to her, 've been taken hostage by
Donna interrupts
We realize, as does Paul, that her voice was actually coming from her answering machine
() Fooled you
'm not really home
But if you leave a message, 'll get back to you as soon as  get in
Bye-bye
His hand falls to his forehead, defeated
Donna,  need to talk to Linda
It's an absolute emergency
Have her call me
Use star sixty-nine and find out the number 'm calling from and have her call me
Donna picks up the phone
Paul
Donna
What do you want

Don't fucking yell at me, Paul
'm not yelling
Yes you are
Just like you did last year at the cookout
'm not going to tolerate -- () Just get me the fucking number
Get me the number, get me the number
Donna hangs up on him
Realizing this, Paul bangs his fists and claws at the top of the coffin, bloodying some of his fingers and knuckles in the process
He violently tosses and turns and screams at the top of his lungs, like an animal trapped in a cage
Tears spray from his eyes as spit shakes free from his mouth by the force of his shudder
He eventually calms quite a bit
Sniffing away tears and taking notice of the damage he's done to his hands, Paul slows his breathing as best he can
24
He lies there, motionless
The silence is almost comforting
Paul closes his eyes, regretfully accepting what appears will be his inescapable fate
After a beat, he calls Donna back
Knowing it is Paul calling, she answers right away, attitude at the ready
What
It takes every ounce of Paul's being to keep himself from going off the deep end
He takes a beat to compose himself and then finally offers a very delicate and deliberate response
Donna, 'm very sorry  yelled
But, 'm only going to ask you once more to get me this number
If you don't get me this number, 'm going to die
What
don't have time to explain
Please

We hear Donna put down the phone

After a beat, she picks the phone back up

202-134-4750
Yeah
Paul writes the number on the top of the coffin, beneath the man others
He writes the initials "

25
What the hell's going -- Paul hangs up on Donna mid-sentence
He dials the number the State Department right away
answers after a few rings
United States Department of State

Yeah, in a coffin, a wooden box
It's an old coffin,  think

But the people took it
26
The people holding you hostage
Yes

Let me connect you

No
Wait
Paul is placed on hold
As he waits, his eyes wander around the coffin
He looks at the numbers he has written
After a moment,  , a State Department official, picks up the phone
Rebecca Browning
Hello
Yes, hello
was just informed of your situation
Yeah, my situation
'm running out of time and you people keep putting me on hold
What the hell is wrong with you
'm sorry
Don't be sorry
Just help me

You've got to be kidding me
It's important that  get this information
It will make a rescue -- 27
Wait, wait, wait
how did you know my name
'm sorry
never gave you my name
don't think  gave it to the other guy, either
Rebecca is silent on the other end of the phone
(') What the hell is going on right now
(after a beat) We received a call from a representative at
You left him a message
Yeah
He contacted us right away
Well, since you know what the hell is going on, what have you done to get me out of here
There's little we can do from Washington
So, that's it
'm just supposed to rot in here because there's little you can do
No
Then what
need to know where you were when your convoy was ambushed
28
In the Diyala Provence
In Baqubah
Okay
And has contact been made with the kidnappers
Yes
The guy told me that he wants five million dollars by nine o'clock tonight
Or else
Or else he'll bring me to Sea World
What do you think, lady
Even faced with Paul's sarcasm, Rebecca remains stolid
Professional
We'll do everything we can
So you'll pay them
() No
That we can't do
Wait
what
It's the policy of the United States government to not negotiate with terrorists
To hell with that
It's easy for you to worry about policy, you're sitting in an air conditioned office somewhere, probably finishing up your sandwich from lunch
You're not the one stuck in a coffin, buried in the God damn desert
understand your frustration -- 29
Frustration
Lady, 'm going to fucking die in here
Understand that
Rebecca is silent on the other end of the phone
Paul wonders if she is still there
The idea of being alone again scares him terribly
(') Hello
Worried, Paul lights the Zippo
The reflection of the flame dances on his frightened eyes
'm here
Momentary relief
After a beat: Well, then say something
Tell me how you're going to get me out of here
What's the number on the phone you're calling from
don't know
Did it come up on your end
No
It's listed as unavailable
Do this -- take down this number
Paul takes out his pen
Go ahead

Paul writes the number onto the top of the coffin
Who's that
Dan Brenner
He's the commander of the Hostage Working Group over in Iraq
30
Paul writes "
" next to Dan's phone number
Hostage Working Group
We formed it in 2004 to deal with situations such as yours
Paul shakes his head in disgust
Situations
love how you keep calling it that
Did you write down the number
Yeah
Good
Hold on, 'll connect you with him now
He should be expecting you
What about the news
'm going to call them
No
Do not,  repeat, do not contact the news
Why
It will only complicate things further and threaten your chances of rescue
Paul doesn't buy it
That's bullshit
You're just covering your ass
No, 'm covering yours
Everyone who needs to know about this does
31
You don't go looking for something if you don't know it's missing
That's why you need to contact Dan Brenner right away
Paul still contemplates contacting the news, but soon acquiesces to Rebecca's pleas for him not to
Fine
'm transferring you now
Rebecca's gone
Paul waits
Several beeps sound as he's being transferred
Paul hears a faint sound coming from behind him, outside the coffin
While the beeps continue to sound, he lights the Zippo, circumspectly looking behind him
He doesn't see anything
With the Zippo still lit, Paul takes a deep, centering breath, followed by another
few more long beeps pass before a ring is heard
After two rings,   answers
Brenner
Dan Brenner
Dan is quick to figure out who it is that must be calling him
Is this Paul Conroy
() Yes, yes it's me
It's Paul
Paul,  was informed of what's going on
want you to know that we're already working on trying to get you out of there
32
Paul is relieved
His first glint of hope has appeared
Tears of joy instantly escape his eyes
Oh, thank you, God
was told that we have until 9pm
Is that right
That's what he said
Alright
That doesn't give us a whole lot of time
And just so have this right, the kidnappers buried you in the ground
Yeah, in an old, wooden coffin
Okay
My guess is that since you're able to get a cell signal, you're no more than a few feet underground
don't know
Maybe
What about battery life
How much does the phone have left
Paul looks at the display to find out
Less than half
Okay
You have to conserve that battery
Our best bet of finding you is by tracking your cell signal
Is the ringer set on a sound or vibrate
Vibrate
Press and hold down the asterisk key to change it to a ring tone
It will use less power
33
What about my Zippo
You have a lighter
Yeah
Use it to look around for markings, a logo -- whatever you can find
Won't it use up oxygen
Not much
Don't worry about that now
Try to find -- It's really dark in here without it
understand, Paul
Try to find anything in there that might indicate where that coffin was made
You guys have to hurry
We're working as fast as we can, Paul
Do you know if there were any other survivors
From your convoy
Yeah
That's still unclear at this point
just wanted to do right by my family
That's all
() 34
(') didn't know it was going to be like this over here
don't think any of us did
While on the phone with Brenner, Paul gets another call coming in
He checks the display and reads the number
Matching it against a number he wrote on the top of the coffin, he sees that is Jabir calling
It's him
He's calling
The kidnapper
Yeah
What do  do
You know his number
Yeah
Give it to me
What about the call
Give me the number first
The phone has rung several times
Paul fears that Jabir may hang up
He's going to hang up
Take the call
-- Take the call
Now
Paul complies with Dan's demand and switches to the other line
35
Hello
Two hour, six minute
Paul looks at his watch
Indeed, he has but two hours and six minutes until the time reaches 9pm
You have to give me more time
You talk to embassy
They give money
Yes
No
talked to
someone
Government
They said that they won't pay the money
No pay
No
They said that they don't negotiate with terrorists
Terrorists
am terrorist
Yes
You are terrorist, you son of a bitch
You are terrified, so  am terrorist
What did  ever do to you
Ever do
Yeah
'm here because it's a job, to make money
That's it
have job until you come
Now, my family have nothing
36
That's not my fault
Jabir retorts with a spirited conviction similar to Paul's
Nine, one, one was not my fault, but still you are here
Saddam was not my fault, but still you are here
told you, 'm only here to work
To help rebuild
Rebuild what you destroyed
Paul cannot handle his stress any longer
He begins to crumble under the pressure
Stop
Just please, stop
'm just a guy
'm just a truck driver
Okay
'm nobody that makes decisions about anything
just want to go home
Silence from the other end of the phone for an extended period of time
You make video, ransom video
This surprisingly comes as good news to Paul
Yes
Please
Get me out of here and 'll make the video
No
You make video now
What
How
You use video on phone
Paul's hopes are dashed
His sanguine head falls back onto the coffin floor
37
(') Near foot
You read note near foot in box
Paul shines the flame of his Zippo lighter toward his feet
He doesn't see anything
Where
don't see -- Near foot
Read note inside box
Paul repositions his legs as best he can
He can vaguely see the corner of a small metal box, partially sticking out of a broken plank on the bottom of the coffin
The video
if  make it, will you let me go
Only if we get money
Nobody's going to pay five million dollars for me
We take less
One million money
If they pay it, will you let me go
(after a beat) One million money
Jabir hangs up, ending the call
Paul sits motionless for a moment, soaking in all that Jabir has just told him
He again looks down toward his feet
He can see the protruding corner of the metal box, but it's positioned in such a way that it will clearly not be easy for him to reach it
Paul then tries to clasp the box with his feet, but after several unsuccessful attempts, he realizes that a new strategy is necessary
38
He makes efforts to reposition himself in the coffin, so that his head and feet will ultimately switch places
He struggles, inch by troubled inch, to make this maneuver
Sweat pours down the side of his face
The extremely tight quarters of the coffin make the repositioning nearly impossible
After expending a great deal of energy doing so, Paul eventually completes the turn of his body
He examines the small, rusted metal box
On it is a cartoon picture of a small Arab boy and girl playing with a red rubber ball
Skeptical at first, Paul carefully examines the box and shakes it gently
Items are heard rummaging inside
He carefully opens it
fluorescent green light shines from inside
Paul looks inside and finds a lit, green glow stick, fluorescing brightly and now illuminating much of the coffin
He closes the lid of the Zippo
Removes the stick
Looking into the small box again, he finds several other items: a small, disused flashlight; a second, unlit glow stick; a jackknife; and lastly, a folded piece of paper
He slowly unfolds the piece of paper
We see that his ransom message is written in an unintelligible mix of English and Arabic
Paul shakes his head and lets out a sigh of disgust
He crumbles up the paper into a ball and listlessly drops it to his side
He covers his face with his hands, his labored breaths echoing in his palms
Under the low-light of the green glow stick, Paul picks up the phone and dials his home
Per usual, he gets the answering machine
His son, Shane, is heard on outgoing message
Thanks for calling the Conroy's
We're not home right now
Please leave a message at the beep
Thanks
Paul's eyes well up with tears
He smiles at the sound of his son's voice
The Beep is heard
Paul hangs up without leaving a message
He looks at the time
It's 7:02pm
Battery life is holding steady at one and a half bars
He remembers something
39
Shit
Paul presses and holds down the shortcut button on the phone that changes the ringer from vibrate to an audible tone
The glow stick begins to slowly fade
Paul dials Dan Brenner
After a few rings, Dan answers
Paul
Here's his number
Paul presses the green key, bringing up the last numbers dialed and received
Hold on
Alright, go ahead
It's 07902-24-921
Dan says something to someone who is in the room with him, and then returns his attention to Paul
This is huge
Unless they're using a cloned line, we should be able to find where this is coming from in minutes
What about me
Can you track my cell signal
We're having a lot of trouble with yours
Seems to be an  line, probably through one of the Egyptian carriers
What does that mean
That
it's not going to be easy
He wants me to make a ransom video
40
No
Hold off for as long as you can
If it's going to get me out of here, 'm making it
The last thing we want is for this to end up all over Al Jazeera
We
Paul becomes angry, again sensing that more emphasis is being placed on containing the situation than rescuing him
This can't turn into an international incident
That's all you people care about
But what about me
Don't you care about me
We do
That's why we're -- No you don't
You people don't care about any of us
've had eight friends killed out here, six of them today
We don't have any guns, any armor
Nothing
You're not soldiers
Tell that to the people who put me in this box
Tell that to the people who shot my friends
We're doing the best we can
No, you're not
All you people understand are your secret plans and your back room politics
() 41
(') If  were some diplomat or something, maybe even a hostage working group leader -- or whatever your fancy title is, 'd be out of here by now
Wouldn't
But 'm not, so 'm just supposed to keep my mouth shut and die
need you to stay focused, Paul
Fuck you
Dan's heard enough
Paul, listen to me: finding you is our primary concern
Bottom line
And we're searching just as hard as we would be for a four-star general, so don't literally waste your breath suggesting otherwise
Paul does not respond at first
Dan's retort clearly has an effect on him
Who are they
The people who put me here
They're just that -- people
No different from you and me
'm no terrorist
Neither are they
How do you know that
If you were homeless, starving
actually,  take that back
If your family was homeless and starving, what would you do for them
wouldn't kill someone
42
How can you be sure
( ) What difference does it make
They're criminals, desperate ones at that
They don't care about anything other than getting the money
So pay them, then
Trust me, if it was an option, would do that in a heartbeat
How many others have there been
Since  got here
Hundreds
Journalists, contractors, soldiers
hundreds have been taken
It's one of the only functioning businesses out here
How many have you rescued
Dan is reluctant to answer the question
(') How many
() Not many
Tell me their names
Who
Any of them
Make me know they really do matter to you
Mark White
43
Who was Mark White
kid from New Hampshire
Twenty- six years old
Med student
Came over here to help out local doctors
What happened to him
Insurgents grabbed him
When
About three weeks ago
Paul writes " " on the top of the coffin, below the list of phone numbers
He circles the name
You remember his name
remember all their names
(afraid to ask) Did he
Is he
The glow stick begins to fade
Yeah
Yeah, Paul, he's alive
Hearing this affords Paul some semblance of relief
Paul shakes the glow stick, returning it to its full strength
Where is he
Home
Probably happy to be back at school
want to get out of here
44
We found him; we'll find you, too
How
We already have a solid lead on the number you gave us
You do
unit's on it's way over there now
This news calms Paul's nerves
That's
that's good
Yeah
What should  do in the meantime
know it's hard, but try to relax
The more worked up you are, the more air you're going to use
can't help it
'm always anxious
take pills for it
Do you have them with you
Paul checks his pants pockets
He removes a small, orange pill bottle
Yeah
Take them
You need to preserve your oxygen level any way you can
Okay
45
Is your Zippo still lit
Not now
Good
feel nauseous
You have to calm down
'm trying
And you need to save that battery
We're expecting some intel in about ten minutes
Call me back then
Okay
Just hang in there, Paul
The glow stick begins to slowly fade
Paul shakes it, causing it to brighten only momentarily before dimming again
Yeah
'm trying
Dan ends the call
Paul lets out a deep breath, finding it difficult to lay claim to its replacement
He looks at his watch
It's now 7:18pm
The ticking sound of the second hand turning is inordinately loud, due to the extreme silence of the coffin
Just then, the cell phone rings
Checking the number on the display, Paul sees that it is Jabir
Paul answers
What
Did you make video
46
No
Jabir yells something in Arabic to the other Iraqi men we hear in the background
Collectively, they do not sound pleased
Slightly panicked, in fact, though it is difficult to tell for sure
( ) You make video
Let me out and 'll make it
No
You make video now
In box
can't
can't read the paper
Make video now
can't
don't know what you want me to say
can't read the paper
Jabir is heard speaking with the men we hear arguing in the background
Although they speak in Arabic, it is clear from their tone that they are becoming worried and increasingly hostile
Jabir returns his attention back to Paul
You make video now
Jabir ends the call
Paul closes the phone to help conserve battery life
He then reopens the phone and scrolls through the menu options
Everything is written in Arabic
He eventually comes across an icon with a movie camera -- the video function
He turns it on
Looks at himself though the viewfinder
After a beat, he closes the phone, clearly frustrated and growing more panicked
His breaths grow heavy and rapid, utilizing a great deal of oxygen
47
'm never getting out of here
Paul begins to freak out, restlessly squirming inside the coffin and pressing against the sides and top
The glow stick fades out almost completely, offering very little light
Paul shakes it, but with no change to its brightness
Moments later, it dies
Paul tries the flashlight
Click-click
Click-click
Nothing
He bangs it a few times with his hand
The white light turns on, but quickly turns back off
He twists the top, which causes the flashlight to switch bulbs
red beam emits momentarily
Paul twists the top again and gives the flashlight a few good whacks
It turns on
White light shines dimly on his face
He takes a breath
In efforts to calm himself, he once again removes the orange pill bottle from his pocket
He pours two into his hand
He then removes his small, metal alcohol flask from his back pocket and takes a large swig, swallowing the two pills in the process
Still, Paul's heavy, labored breathing continues
He drops four additional pills into his and swallows them with yet another generous pull from the flask
He sits and waits
Nothing is happening, except that his extremely limited time keeps passing
After a moment, Paul picks up the cell phone
He holds it in front of him, hesitant to make a call
After some consideration, he dials
After a few rings, a    answers
Mountain View Nursing Home
was hoping  could speak with Maryanne Conroy, please
Um
okay
Ah
let me bring the cordless phone to her room
Hold on a moment, please
We hear the Nurse walk down the tiled corridor floor
She soon reaches Paul's mother's room
48
(') Misses Conroy, you have a telephone call, dear
Here, you can use this phone
Paul's mother, , answers
Her voice is pleasant but confused
It's clear that she suffers from advanced stages of Alzheimer's Disease
Hello
Mom
it's Paul
Who
It's Paul, Mom
Your son
My son
It's okay, Mom
How are you
'm fine
That's good
Who are you
It's your son, Mom
It's Paulie
Paulie
Yeah
Remember
We lived over on Colfax Street, in the duplex
Remember
( ) Paulie
That's right, Mom
49
Is this Paulie
It is, Mom
It's Paulie
How's everything at the home
Very nice
Your father and  have been playing gin rummy every night
It's almost too much for Paul to take
He cries silent tears over a heartbroken smile
Yeah
don't think Pop's there with you, Mom
How are you doing, sweetie
Not very good
This
uh, this may be the last time  talk to you
That's nice, honey
Did you get the flowers  sent a few months ago
Flowers
Yeah,  sent
never mind
Listen, 'm going to go now
just wanted to talk to you, you know, just to say bye
love you, Mom
Maryanne doesn't respond
(') Did you hear me
Mom
told you
do you want to tell me you -- Yes, dear
Your father and  have been playing gin rummy every night
50
(after a beat) Okay, Mom
Tell Pop  said hi
Paul ends the call and instantly begins crying his heart out
He lays there, sobbing relentlessly
After a long beat, the cell phone rings
Decidedly different than his past reactions to an incoming call, Paul seems hopelessly disinterested
The ring is maddening
He mindlessly presses the shortcut button, resetting the ring to vibrate mode
He eventually picks up the phone, but there is not anyone on the other end
It's then that he sees that it was not a call that came in, but instead was a picture message
Pressing what appears to be the Accept button, the incoming picture begins to download
Several seconds later, the picture downloads and an image appears on the display of Paul's cell phone
It's of a woman -- bound and gagged, a gun pressed against the side of her head
Oh no
No, no, no
Paul frantically dials the number to reach Jabir
As soon as the phone connects, Paul begins his desperate plea
Video make
Let her go
Please
Please don't hurt her
The Woman is heard in the background of Jabir's phone, crying muffled words through her muzzled mouth
We shoot her if you no make video
No
No, please no shoot
No shoot her
You get money
American million
51
will,  promise
Just don't shoot her
She's a mother, she's got two kids
Two kids
Yes
She has two kids
have five
Now only one
You make video
Now
Wait
No wait
give three seconds
can't read the paper
Three
No
Wait
Two
don't know what you want me to say
One
Okay
Okay, 'll make the video
Just, please, don't shoot
Jabir does not fire his gun
Paul attempts to catch his breath
(') need to hang up to make the video
Okay
Is that okay
You have three minute to send video
52
Jabir hangs up, ending the call
Paul reaches for the balled-up piece of paper that has the ransom script written on it
It takes some trouble for him to grab it, but he is soon able to
Placing the flashlight next to the paper, Paul is again reminded of the incoherent nature of the script
(re: the script) Fuck
He drops the paper to his side and opens the phone, setting it to the video record function
He places the flashlight close to his face so as to make his image more visible on the small, phone display screen
He presses the record button
(speaking at the phone) My name is Paul Conroy
'm an American citizen from Hastings, Michigan
'm a civilian truck driver for Crestin, Roland and Thomas
've been taken hostage somewhere in Iraq
and  need one million dollars by nine o'clock tonight, Baghdad time, or else 'll be left to die in this coffin 'm buried in
've been told that if
The flashlight goes out
Paul continues speaking in the darkness
After a few quick smacks, the flashlight turns back on
(') the money is paid,  will be let go
If it's not,  will die in here
These threats are real and will be followed through on
Trying to think of more to say, Paul soon opts for not saying anything further
He saves the message and then sends it to Jabir
We see that the screen displays an icon confirming the video has been sent
Paul places the phone on his chest
Still rubbing his temples, his eyes begin to flutter a bit
He tries to control his breathing and remain calm
53
He opens the phone and displays the photo of the Woman
He stares admiringly at her, hoping dearly that she will not be harmed
The effects of the anxiety pills finally taking effect, his eyes soon close and he drifts off to sleep
: - Darkness once again
We hear the sound of Paul slowly awaking, followed the sight of Zippo sparks
It doesn't catch
The second glow stick is snapped, illuminating the coffin with a fluorescent green hue
Paul starts to move, but suddenly freezes
His eyes widen
His pupils dilate
Something is clearly very wrong, though we cannot see what
His eyes slowly shift downward, as if watching something move down his body
Beads of sweat form across his brow
His measured breaths are held for as long as they can be
Moving excruciatingly slow, Paul lowers the glow stick toward what he is looking at
shape moves across his stomach, underneath his -shirt
Paul's eyes are fixed on whatever it may be
He cautiously, slowly, moves the glow stick even closer
The shape disappears just as the light of the glow stick shines on whatever it may be
Still, Paul does not dare make any sudden move
Paul's pant leg moves slightly, starting at the top, slowly undulating toward his cuff
Paul leans the glow stick in further
And further
Carefully
Moving a millimeter at a time
He shifts the position of his head slightly, charily, to see next to his feet
He leans in even closer with the glow stick
But then -- -- his wary movement comes to immediate stop
It's a snake
two-foot, saw-scaled viper
It has positioned itself in the corner of the coffin, inches from Paul's feet
54
His terror evident, Paul very slowly pulls his feet back toward his upper body, away from the snake
The confined space offers little room for safety
The snake turns its muscled neck to face Paul
Their eyes meet for the first time
The snake hisses, poised to strike at any moment
Paul raises his foot
Steels himself
Prepares to preempt the snake with a solid stomp
more sensible plan soon prevails
After lowering his foot, Paul cautiously removes the flask from his pocket
Slowly unscrews the top
Splashes a small amount of alcohol on the floor, close to the snake
The snake recoils slightly, but then menacingly twists itself into a new posture, ready to attack
Paul lowers the Zippo to the small puddle of alcohol
After a few sparks -- -- it lights
flash-fire
The snake flails and hisses wildly at the other side of a small fire wall
The flame soon goes out
Paul moves fast
Throws more alcohol, this time some of it lands on the snake itself
He places the already lit Zippo against the puddle of alcohol near the snake
Another flash-fire, this time burning the snake
It hisses loudly
Threateningly
It swings back and forth, challenging the small wall of fire
The fire soon extinguishes
The snake burrows into the hole from where it likely entered the coffin, disappearing into it with haste
Paul hurriedly stuffs the hole with his discarded button-down shirt
He then pours a small amount of alcohol over the shirt and temporarily puts the flask on the ground, but does not screw the cap on securely
He then wedges the lit Zippo between a small space between two wooden planks
With the snake situation handled, Paul finally lets out a sigh of relief
Rubs his eyes
Tries to regain his faculties
Looks over the list of phone numbers written above him
Suddenly, the cell phone vibrates
Paul frenziedly searches for it, but he cannot find it
He then notices it has fallen into the small hole near his feet, out of his reach
He makes several attempts to grab the phone with his feet, but he is unable to do so
It continues to ring
His next efforts involve repositioning himself in the coffin so that he completely turns to face the opposite end
55
Struggling through each move, Paul painstakingly begins to turn himself
While turning, however, he inadvertently kicks the Zippo from the side of the coffin -- landing it on the floor, up against the glow stick -- and knocks over the flask
We see that the flame of the Zippo slowly melts the plastic glow stick, causing it to dim slightly
Worst still, and completely unbeknownst to Paul, a stream of alcohol slowly makes its way from the flask and toward the flame of the lighter, threatening to set the coffin ablaze
Inch by inch, the flammable spirit gets closer
Still in the midst of his repositioning, Paul looks back and sees the alcohol nearing the flame
In a panic, he attempts to reach and grab the Zippo
But, he finds himself stuck in the middle of the coffin
He can't budge either way
No, no, no
Desperately straining every muscle in his body, he extends his arm backward toward the Zippo, hoping to move it away from the spilled alcohol
He still can't reach it, yet he tries with all his might
The phone stops ringing
He has missed the call
He tries blowing at the flame, but his head is too far away and his breath is not strong enough to do much more than cause it to flicker
With the alcohol now mere inches away from the flame, Paul reaches for his shoe
His odd positioning makes reaching his foot almost impossible
He struggles to undo the laces and remove it from his foot
With his face beet red from the force of his strain, Paul finally removes his shoe
The mere inch of leg room this creates allows him to slide his leg out from under him
The trail of alcohol is just about to come into contact with the flame -- -- but Paul deftly maneuvers his body just in time to awkwardly kick the Zippo out of the way and close the lid
Paul breaths an enormous sigh of relief as he sits in the dim light of the damaged glow stick
He notices another hole in the coffin
As a precaution, he stuffs it with the cloth that had previously been used to gag him
56
Just as he is about to grab the phone, he hears what appears to be the faint sound of a Muslim call to prayer being announced over the citywide  system
The sound barely makes its way through the hundreds of pounds of sand that envelop the coffin
sign of hope, as well as a point of reference for his location -- albeit a very vague one
He listens further as the call to prayer continues
The light of the glow stick dims further
Paul then opens his phone
Sees that he missed Jabir's call
He starts to call Jabir back, but stops
He instead navigates through the various display menus
He soon reaches what appears to be the Tools Menu, though it's difficult to tell because everything is written in Arabic
He becomes frustrated as he fails to find what he is looking for
On the verge of mental surrender, he sees something that gives him pause
smile crosses his face
(re: the phone screen) There you are
We see, on the display of the phone, that Paul has found a listing of languages
He scrolls past many -- ", , " -- stopping at "
" Presses the button, instantly making all the text on the screen readable
He quickly navigates to the Tools menu
Scrolls down
Locates the number of the cell phone he is using
He scribbles the number onto the top of the coffin
Then a second pass, making it bolder than the others
Paul then dials his wife's cell phone
After only a few rings, he is met by her voice mail
(
) Hi, this is Linda
Please leave a message
Thanks and have a great day
The beep sounds, and Paul frantically proceeds right into his message
Linda, here's the number for the phone
just found it out
It's 07902-42-884
You have to use the international calling code first
() 57
(') Please call me as soon as you get this
love you
love you
Call me right away
Please
Paul hangs up
He looks at the battery life left on the phone
One bar
He then checks his watch
It's 8:19pm
Both are not good signs, and he knows it
(') Oh shit
He begins to panic
Grabbing the pocket knife that was left inside the metal box, he slides the blade in the space between the sides of the coffin and the top
Paul grabs the glow stick
But, because it was partially melted to the floor, the stick snaps in two
Liquid oozes out of the small portion of the stick that remains stuck the floor
Son of a
Paul grabs the flashlight
Turns it on
It works for a second, but then goes out
Shaking it only produces intermittent beams of light
He turns the top, switching to the red bulb
It works
The coffin fills with a reddish hue, but then it, too, goes out
Growing incensed, Paul switches back to the white bulb
It works
He returns his attention to the coffin
His efforts to use the knife as a fulcrum are futile
Still, he tries
Bending the blade well past its design, it nearly breaks off its handle
The flashlight turns off
After a good shaking, it turns back on, emitting white light
With oxygen levels extremely diminished, efforts of this kind are all too much for Paul to take
He has to stop and try to catch his breath
As he endeavors to get his wind back, the cell phone rings
Not a call this time, but instead a video message
It has been sent by Jabir
Paul's trepidation is evident
He fears what the incoming video may show
58
After a beat, he presses the Accept button and the video downloads
Within seconds, the video plays on his phone display screen
We see, in the video, the American Woman that previously appeared in a picture message that was sent to Paul
She is still bound at her wrists, but her gag has been lowered
She sits on her knees
Standing behind her are three men, all with their faces shielded by Arab headdresses
They each hold -47 assault weapons
Paul watches in horror as the terrified woman speaks, through her tears, into the camera
My name is Pamela Gorham
'm a food service worker at
Anaconda, employed by Crestin, Roland and Thomas
My captors' requests for ransom have gone unanswered, and -- The Woman, Pamela, looks off-screen to her right
Someone is fast approaching her
She cowers, protectively holding her bound hands in front of her face as she screams
(') (to the person) No
wait
Please -- no
Another Iraqi man steps into the camera's line of site, a handgun already brandished
Without as much as a moment's hesitation, he fires two rounds directly into Pamela's head, killing her
The video message ends immediately thereafter
Paul is in complete shock
He screams aloud, slamming his closed fist against the bottom of the coffin
No
No, no, no
Still in the throes of emotional torment, Paul vomits on himself
He doubles over, only to vomit once again
His body, taxed almost to the point of complete physical breakdown, gradually slows and levels itself
With his vomit- smeared face pressed cheek-down onto the bottom of the coffin, Paul stares into nothingness
59
After a beat, his eye catches a glimmer of light -- the blade of the knife, reflecting off the beam of the flashlight
Paul reaches for the knife
Lying on his back, still suffering enormous mental strain, he places the cutting edge of the blade against his neck
His jugular vein
His hand shakes, his lips tremble
The hand that holds the blade tightens its grip on the handle
It, too, shakes
Paul closes his eyes
small amount of blood begins to drip from the side of his neck, where the blade of the knife rests, ready to open his vein
After a great deal of consideration, Paul throws the knife to the foot of the coffin
He can't do it
The flashlight falls from Paul's chest
It turns off upon landing on the floor of the coffin
Paul sits in darkness
His breaths echo off the coffin walls
After a beat, he turns on the flashlight
It turns off after less than two seconds
This time, however, he does not shake it, nor does he hit it
moment later, we hear a click, followed by the sight of a red light beam emitting from the flashlight
It holds steady
Paul shines it onto the names and phone numbers written on the top of the coffin
He stops at "
" After a beat, he lowers the flashlight to his side
He picks up the phone and dials Brenner
After one ring, Brenner answers
He's clearly not pleased
Paul, however, is surprisingly calm
Detached
Almost disturbingly so
Why the hell did you make that video
It's all a bunch of lies
60
What is
What are you talking about
All of it
All of what
Nobody gives a shit about any of us
We're nothing to you people
We're going to find you
By looking the other way
You can't start breaking on me now, Paul
You have to stay strong
You let her die
(after a beat) No  didn't
They shot her
and you didn't do anything
We didn't even know she had been taken hostage
She sent three videos
That's what they told her to say
Why
don't know
What do you know
61
That your ransom video already has 47,000 hits on YouTube
And all the major networks are playing it, including Al Jazeera
So, now your captors have no choice but to follow through
found out the number to this phone
How
found a way to change the display language
figured that out, and you didn't
Why
Because  didn't
Just like you and every other person on this planet, there are some things know and some things  don't
Then how are you ever going to find me
Their signal was cloned, like we figured
But, we're close
Real close
What about mine
We're working on that, too
'm near a Mosque
could hear the call to prayer over the
Good
That means that we're in the right area
You're nearby
62
spoke with soldiers from the third  who were escorting your convoy
They're alive
After a beat: Not all of them
Both Bradley tanks were hit with IEDs
The rest got caught in small arms fire
() What the hell happened out there, Paul
Paul doesn't answer at first
(') Paul
After a beat: We had just left Anaconda, everything seemed okay
We knew that a bunch of our  radios had been stolen and that the Iraqis were listening in, so we made sure to switch from our usual channels
Pam was riding with Jeff Breer, the convoy commander
She wanted to ride with me like she usually did when she hitched a ride from base, but it seemed safer for her to be with the
As we headed down the road, all these kids came running into the street
Dozens of them
It almost seemed like they were expecting us, except we got there faster than they thought we would
So they run on up in front of me, and  slam on my brakes
The rest of the drivers were already further up ahead, so they kept going
Next thing  know, one of the lead trucks got hit by an hear Tommy Wilkes on the radio saying, Sandman's hit, Sandman's hit
He's
he's everywhere
() 63
(') That's when the Iraqis came out of their mud huts from the side of the road and started shooting everybody
couldn't believe what was happening
It seemed like slow- motion, like  was watching it on People -- my friends -- were getting killed, and all  could do is watch
didn't even notice that the kids were throwing bricks and rocks at me until one split my windshield
Sort of snapped me out of my trance
But then,  guess got hit in the head with a rock, `cause  blacked out
Do you happen to remem
mo
nea
The cell phone service begins to cut out
Suddenly, the coffin begins to vibrate slightly, dropping sand granules through the crack and onto the wood bottom, followed by the faint sound of an explosion
Within seconds, the explosions grow louder and more proximate
The vibration becomes so intense that it violently shakes Paul around the coffin
The sound of jet plane engines are heard coming from above, flying by as the massive explosions continue
Sand seeps in through the crack between the top and sides of the coffin as it shakes
Paul does his best to brace himself, but the bombardment is far too powerful
large crack forms in the wooden cover to the coffin, spanning almost its entire length
Sand immediately pours through the concave shaped crack, seeping in onto Paul like an hourglass
Fearing that the top of the coffin may collapse under the immense pressure from the sand above, Paul positions himself underneath it and presses with all his might
He grunts and screams loudly, using what little strength he has left to keep the top from caving
The shaking soon stops, though the steady flow of sand continues
64
In efforts to prevent the sand from filling the coffin any faster, Paul removes the button-down shirt from the hole and stuffs into the area where it enters with the greatest volume
He removes the balled-up cloth from the other hole and does the same with it
Both offer very little help
The flashlight falls to the floor
The red light beam turns off
Darkness
The sound of sand steadily pouring down
() Oh no
no
Paul clicks the flashlight to a different setting
White light shines, but then goes out
He shakes the flashlight and it stays on, shining its normal white beam
He assesses his situation, noticing that the coffin is already filled with a small layer of sand; a situation that is only going to get worse with time
This can't be happening
We see that Dan Brenner is no longer on the phone, and that the display menu shows an icon of a phone with a line through it -- No Service Available
Once he feels it is secure enough, Paul slowly moves his body away from the crack
Although slightly caved, it does not show any more signs of possible collapse
Sweat drenches his face
His eyes affixed, in utter disbelief, on the sand as it spills into the coffin, filling in around him inch-by-inch
He grabs the cell phone, only to see that he does not have a signal
(') No
Come on
Please work
He shakes the cell phone and moves it all around the coffin, hoping that it may somehow help
His efforts are futile
The flashlight goes dead
He hits it, shakes it
It turns back on
The brightness is diminished
Still the sand continues to fall, drowning him deeper and deeper in a pool of granules
Then, very surprisingly, the cell phone rings
Paul answers right away
65
() Hello
Hello
Who's there
Alan Davenport answers calmly from the other end
Is this Paul Conroy
Yes
Yes, this is Paul
Who are you
Paul, my name's Alan Davenport, 'm the personnel director here at Crestin, Roland and Thomas
left you a message
You did
also heard from Rebecca Browning over at the State Department
Are you able to speak on the status of your situation
It's worse
There was an explosion or something
The coffin's breaking, there's sand pouring in from everywhere
only have a half an hour before -- Okay, okay
Slow down
You should try to stay calm
Tell me something, Paul, who have you spoken to
The hostage takers, Dan Brenner from the hostage working group -- Okay, Paul
'm with you
How about the media
know your ransom video leaked, but have you spoken directly to anyone about what's going on
The flashlight goes out
Paul hits it a few times and it turns back on
66
No
That's good
It needs to stay that way
It's important that we keep this situation as contained as possible
Paul finds Alan's obvious concern with doing damage control to be infuriating
About three inches to my right, there's a wall
Three inches to my left, there's another wall
And about four inches above my head, there's a roof that's about to collapse and drown me in sand think this situation is pretty contained
know you're upset -- Help me
Help me
What are you going to do to help me
know you're upset
And, from what 've been told, steps are being taken to get you out of there
So, hopefully it won't be much longer
Thank God
Yes, thank God
() 'm going to switch on a recorder right now
Just a second
Paul's visage expresses his confusion
click is heard in the b
g
of Alan's phone, followed by a low, steady hum
Alan's speech becomes very laconic
His questions are clearly being read from a Human Resources handbook of some kind
67
(') This is Alan Davenport, Personnel Director for Crestin, Roland and Thomas, Incorporated
The date is October 23, 2006
am speaking with Paul Conroy
Mister Conroy, are you aware that 'm recording this conversation
What
Please answer the question
The flashlight goes out again
Shit
Paul hits it, but it does not catch
He sits in darkness
Mister Conroy
Yes
Yes
And do  have your permission to do so
Why do you need my permission
What is all this
need you to answer yes or no, please
Yes
Alright
Yes
Paul hits the flashlight
It turns back on
Thank you
Now, Mister Conroy, when were you hired by
About nine months ago
Around January of 2005
Why are you wasting time with this
68
have your official date of hire as January 4th, 2005
Is that correct
Who cares
This is fucking crazy -- January 4th, 2005
Is that correct
Yes
And during your initial training, before being sent to Iraq, were you made aware of the dangers inherent to the position for which you were hired
You mean when  came down there to Dallas and you guys said that all of the trucks would be armored and have bulletproof glass
The flashlight dims
Paul angrily shakes it, returning it to full strength
(') You mean when you told us that things were safer than ever over here
Is that when  was made aware
need you to answer yes or no, please
() Yes
The flashlight begins to slowly dim
During that time, did you also receive and sign an employment contract with , which thoroughly explained company policy as it pertained to your specific terms of employment
69
Yeah,  signed a bunch of things
Yes or no
Yes
signed the contract
Yes
It's our understanding that you were taken hostage in Iraq two hours ago, is that also correct
Yes
That's completely correct
What is the point of all this
Alan breaks from the
handbook script, though his tone remains just as matter-of-fact
The flashlight continues its steady, slow dim
Our legal department requires that we obtain a sworn affidavit from employees, confirming that they understand the reasons for their forced separation from the company
As of this morning, your employment with  was officially terminated
Wait, wait, wait -- The flashlight dims even more
It was brought to our attention that you were engaging in relations with a fellow  employee -- Pamela Gorham
No
Wait -- Stipulated in your contract was a fraternization clause, in which it was stated quite clearly that any relationship, be it romantic or sexual in nature, deemed inappropriate by  senior officials is grounds for immediate termination
70
We
we were just friends
Our records indicate differently
This is bullshit
We're also legally required to inform you that because you were technically no longer under the employ of  at the time of your abduction, we cannot be held accountable for any injury that may befall upon you after your official date and time of termination
Therefore, in your case, that includes this incident or any consequences that may result from it
Paul sees where Alan is going with this
He's thunderstruck
What about my insurance money
My family will need that money
Given that you were alive up until the time of your termination -- You son of a bitch
You can't do this
Do you understand everything -- You can't do this
Alan takes a second before trying again
Do you understand everything you've been told, Mister Conroy
Paul does not answer
(') Mister Conroy
71
After a long beat: Go to hell
That concludes our interview with Paul Conroy
am now turning off the recorder
click is heard
The humming ceases
You people can't just wash your hands of this
You bastards put me here
'm sorry
Alan ends the call
Paul looks at the phone -- it is still holding a steady signal
Battery life, however, is running quite low
All that remains is one blinking bar, indicating that Paul has very little battery life left
He shakes his hand free of the pile of sand that now covers it and looks at his watch
It's 8:31pm
The flashlight bulb dims until it goes out completely
Only the light of the cell phone display lights the coffin
Come on
Wasting little time, Paul dials Jabir
The phone rings and rings, but Jabir does not answer
Checking to make sure the he dialed the correct number, Paul matches it against the phone number he wrote onto the wall of the coffin
Seeing that he did, in fact, dial correctly, Paul again tries to call Jabir
While he waits through the many rings, he tries relighting the Zippo
Spark
spark
it catches
No one answers
Paul's disquietude is evident in his increasingly erratic behavior
Answer the phone
Paul tries Jabir once again, but still he does not answer the phone
72
(desperate, exhausted) Why won't you answer
It's then that something occurs to Paul
He stares at the crack in the top of the coffin and the sand that pours in at an alarmingly fast rate
The crack has split Jabir's written phone number in half
The aerial bombing
He wonders how it may have affected Jabir and, consequently, his own chances of survival
He places his hand under the point from where the sand pours in most, allowing it to collect on his palm and slip through his fingers
The flickering Zippo flame tells of the diminished amount of oxygen
Paul attempts to control his breathing, realizing full well that there are not many more breaths he will be able to take
He then calls Dan Brenner
After a few rings, Brenner answers
Paul is surprisingly serene
Paul, is that you
They're dead
How do you know that
just do
Three -16s levelled parts of the city a few minutes ago
know
felt it
Did they know was here
The Zippo flame flutters
Weakens
(after a beat) Yeah
73
Did they care
Dan does not answer
(') These people that took me -- if they're dead, they can't tell you where  am
We can still try to track down your signal
You tried that already
We can try again
Paul appreciates Dan's effort, but he knows there is little hope left for him
(') It's over, isn't it
After a long beat: No
Paul doesn't say a word
He knows that Dan is lying
After a beat, Dan comes clean
(') Yeah
The flame of the Zippo becomes smaller
It clearly has little life left
What should  do
don't know
That's right -- just like everyone else on the planet, there are some things you know and some things you don't
74
wish this could have gone differently
Yeah
me too
After a long beat, Paul ends the call
He forces a smile to his lachrymose face
Utterly hopeless, he opens the phone and turns on the video feature
He turns the phone to face himself, projecting his image on the display
He presses Record
(') This is Paul Steven Conroy
Social Security number 048-32-1198, date of birth 3/19/68
This video will serve as my last will and testament
To my wife, Linda Conroy,  leave the seven hundred dollars in my personal savings and whatever  have left in my annuity
To my son, Shane Conroy, don't know
don't have anything else
My stuff, like, my clothes
wish  had more
wish  had done more
Your dad wasn't really much of anything, Shane, 'm sorry
Maybe if  was a famous baseball player, or a guy who wore a suit to work,  would have more to leave you
But, you can be one of those people if you want
You can be whatever you want
Just promise me that when you get older, you'll take good care of your mom
And promise me that you'll always try to do the right thing, no matter what
love you very much, Shane
Maybe  never said that enough
maybe  did,  don't even know
That probably means didn't
() 'm sorry, Linda
should have listened to you
Paul ends the video and closes the phone
He carefully places the phone into his pocket, where it may hopefully be found if he ever is
75
He lays back, staring at the almost completely extinguished Zippo flame, as the sand continues to rain on him
Down and down it pours, the sands of time passing might and main through the cracks
The Zippo flame goes out
Paul sits in the darkness, resigned to what apparently will be his fate
Hold on black for several seconds
until -- -- suddenly, from inside Paul's pocket, he hears a faint vibration
It's the cell phone
He looks at the number of who is calling him
Shines the light of the cell phone on the list of numbers written on the top of the coffin
He can't believe what he's seeing
Paul answers immediately
You're not dead
Jabir is heard speaking frantically in Arabic to the several other people in the room with him
(') Hello
Hello
Jabir turns his attention to Paul
Where is money
don't know
What don't know
don't know where the money is
Liar
'm not lying
swear
Swear
'm telling the truth
76
Sounding panicked, Jabir again speaks in Arabic to the other people in the room with him
They respond accordingly
Paul tries to turn on the flashlight
It doesn't work
Jabir returns his scornful attention to Paul
From Embassy, you get money now
can't
You will
need more time
Please
Paul shakes and hits the flashlight
It still does not work
No more time
There's sand pouring in here can't
it's everywhere
Please, let me out of here and  will get you the money
Jabir utters something in Arabic to someone standing next to him, seemingly asking a question and getting an answer from the same individual
Paul unscrews the top of the flashlight
Switches the positioning of the batteries
Screws the cap back on
Hits the switch
Nothing
Jabir returns to the phone
(') You show blood
What
Paul unscrews the top of the flashlight again
Removes the batteries
Bites down on them a few times
Blows hard inside the flashlight tube
You show blood, they give money
77
No
You cut off thumb finger, send video
'm not doing that
Yes
Paul puts the batteries back inside the flashlight
Begins screwing on the cap
No
No
That's right, no
You let me out of here, and 'll cut off my whole God damn hand if you want
Jabir again says something to someone in the room with him, returning to Paul after a brief moment
Paul finishes closing the top of the flashlight
You have wife
Click
The flashlight turns on
Paul considers Jabir's question to be a potential sign of compassion
Yes,  do
And a son
young son
want to go home
to see them
Please, sir
Sir
Yes
Sir
say that out of respect
to you
78
243 East Walnut Street
Hastings, Michigan
() That's my
why did you say that
You show blood
or they show blood
That's
you're lying
You're nobody
all of you
You can't get to them
No
No
You're peasants, criminals, that's all
You don't even know where Michigan is
Detroit
Ann Arbor
Even this basic knowledge is enough to make Jabir's threats that much more real
You looked at a map
That's all you did
You show blood, or they show blood
Send video by five minutes
Jabir ends the call
Realizing that Jabir is gone, Paul quickly dials his wife's cell phone
After several rings, her voice mail picks up
(
) Hi, this is Linda
Please leave a message
Thanks and have a great day
() Linda, listen to me: you and Shane have to go somewhere
anywhere
() 79
(') Don't stay at the house, whatever you do, do not stay at the house
The guy
the kidnapper, he knows our address
He stole my license and now he knows where we live
Go to the Sheriff's station if you have to, just don't go home
Paul hangs up
He takes a moment to look around, noticing that the coffin is almost halfway filled with sand
(') (re: the sand) Holy God
Paul then dials Dan Brenner
After only one ring, the call goes directly to voice mail
The flashlight starts to dim
Paul shakes it, causing it to regain its strength
This is Daniel Brenner
Please leave a message at the tone
The beep sounds
Paul delivers a frenzied message
Brenner, where are you
He's alive
He just called me
Call me right away
The fucking guy is still alive
Paul hangs up the phone
Unsure what to do next, Paul's heartbeat races
He fidgets, nervously shaking and tapping his thumb against the phone
He questions the validity of Jabir's threats toward his family
( ) They can't find them
They
can't
There's no way
Paul opens the phone and brings up the photo of Pamela, bound and gagged
The image causes Paul to second guess himself
The flashlight goes out
The cell phone's display illuminates Paul's face
80
He then replays the video in which Pamela is seen being shot
Reliving the experience is extremely painful, though his concern is more on his own family at this point
However, the video is enough to convince Paul of Jabir and his cohort's convictions
Paul tries the Zippo
Nothing
Only sparks
He tosses it aside
His breathing grows erratic and labored
His eyes dart from side-to-side, his throat groans involuntary noises of fear
Paul then looks at the knife, and then at his watch
He has less than two minutes to send the video to Jabir
Fearing for the safety of his family, he must meet Jabir's demands
He hits the flashlight a few times
Click
It turns on
Paul opens the phone and sets it to take video
He places it flat onto the surface of the sand, which by this point is already filling the coffin halfway
He then reaches for the knife
(') Oh my God
Oh my God
He places his hands against the side of the coffin, spreading his fingers
He stares intently at his thumb
With the extremely sharp knife in hand, Paul slowly lowers it just above his thumb
He inhales and exhales deep breaths, almost hyperventilating
(') Holy shit
Paul then reaches into the sand and finds one of the expired glow sticks
He shakes the sand off of it and places it across his mouth, biting into it hard
His heart races, his breaths are the deepest he's ever taken
After placing the flashlight on the ground, to ensure that the camera picks up the image, he presses the record button on the cell phone
Grinding his teeth into the glow stick and letting out a primordial scream, Paul closes his eyes and chops down with the knife
We see, through the display screen of the phone, Paul sever his thumb with a swift chop of the blade
81
small spray of blood spatters onto his face as he screams out in unfathomable pain
He falls to his side, still screaming and writhing
He reaches for his discarded outer-shirt, which is still stuffed in the crack to help slow the influx of sand
Removing the shirt from the crack instantly causes the sand to fall into the coffin more rapidly
Paul wraps the shirt around his hand
The blood quickly soaks right through it
He is fading fast
His blood loss is great
Shock sets in
He musters up the strength to send the video to Jabir
To secure his shirt over the wound, Paul removes his belt from his waist and pulls it tight over his wrap
Growing increasingly more pale, Paul teeters on the verge of consciousness
Everything becomes blurry to him
The phone falls from his hand
He shivers
His lips turn a light shade of purple and his face ash white
Everything becomes more and more blurry
He fights with every last ounce of strength to remain conscious
While laying against the side of the coffin, the phone vibrates once again
To Paul, the vibration against the wood seems so distant, so foreign
The vibration grows louder and louder in his mind, sounding more and more like the sound of rotating helicopter blades
He then hears what sounds like , yelling from on top of the coffin
#1 He's down here
#2 Get him out
Keep digging
#3 Paul, we're here
The cacophony of voices form a mosaic of sound in Paul's head, each overlapping the other in distant echoes
Shovels, digging deep into the ground, are heard banging against the top of the coffin
The top of the coffin is torn open, sending a brilliant ray of white light onto Paul
He stares into the light, crying, eking out a tortured smile
82
Suddenly, Paul is back in the same predicament
The voices, the shovels, the light -- it was all a hallucination, brought upon by his loss of blood
He's still alone
He's still in the coffin, which continues to fill up with sand
He is too exhausted to display his disappointment
The phone continues to vibrate
It soon stops
Paul is in too poor condition to show any concern
After a beat, the phone begins vibrating once again
After several rings, Paul languidly picks it up
He barely recognizes the number through his extremely blurred vision
He's so weak, he's barely able to formulate words
He spits out stray particles of sand from his mouth
Yeah
Paul, it's Brenner
Paul doesn't have the strength to answer
(') Paul
Are you there
Paul
'm
here
We're coming for you now
You hear me
We know where you are
This news serves as somewhat of an adrenaline rush for Paul, who musters up even the modicum of strength he seemingly did not have left in him
You're coming
We are, Paul
We're almost there now
How do you know
Coalition forces picked up a Shiite insurgent just outside of Baghdad
() 83
(') Said he knew where an American was buried alive
He agreed to show us where if we let him go
You're coming for me
We're practically there already
An impossible smile fights its way to Paul's lips
His momentary joy is just that, however, for the sand has almost completely filled the coffin by this point
You have to hurry
We are
No
you have to hurry
The sand
it's filling up fast
Just hang in there for three more minutes
This will all be over soon,  promise
Paul is very hopeful that Dan is correct in his assumption
Okay
believe you
Thank you
Thank you
beep is heard
Paul has another call coming in
He's visibly elated upon seeing who it is
Three minutes
Try to -- have to go
Paul, no -- Call me right back
Paul
84
Call me right back
Paul switches to the other call, despite the fact that he has a mere eight inches left before the entire coffin is filled with sand from top-to-bottom
He holds the flashlight just above the top of the sand pile, allowing it to illuminate what little unoccupied area remains
Linda
Linda is in hysterics, which is evident in her speech
Paul
Paul is that you
Tell me it's you
It's me, sweetie
Oh my God, Paul
What are they doing to you
Please tell me you're okay
'm
okay
just saw the news
What
oh my God, baby
The flashlight dims
Paul shakes it, regaining a bit of its strength
It's going to be okay now
missed all your calls
left my cell phone at home
just found out what was going on
That's okay
It's all okay
They're getting me out
Who
85
The people
Americans
They found out where  am and they're on their way to get me
() They are
Oh thank God
Oh dear God, thank you
The flashlight flickers
Paul hits it
It flickers some more
It's all going to be okay
How do you know for sure
Oh God, please tell me you're okay
The flashlight continues to flicker almost like a stroboscopic light from this point forward
'm okay
was so afraid  was going to lose you
You're not
Linda breaks down in joyous tears
love you so much
love you so, so much
( ) love you, too
() 'm sorry
should have listened to you
It doesn't matter
should have never come here
You were right
'm sorry
86
Sweetie,  don't care
just want you home
Please come home to me
will
Swear it
will
swear  will
Paul then receives a call on the other line
He checks to see who's calling
It's Dan Brenner
(') They're here
The people
They're calling me right now have to go
Call me right away
will
love you
love you
Swear it again
swear
have to go
Paul clicks over to the other line, where Dan Brenner waits to speak with him
We hear Dan yelling to people who are with him
great deal of commotion and action is heard through the phone
Move
Move
Let's go
Brenner
Paul
Paul
87
It's me
We're here
Dan yells to one of the soldiers who are with him
(') Corporal, get your men over here
Dan gets back on the phone with Paul (') He brought us right to you
(') (to the soldiers) Start digging
Let's go, let's go
The flashlight fades
Paul hits it, momentarily returning it to full strength
Meanwhile, the sand inside the coffin has almost reached the very top
It continues to pour in from the crack, seemingly faster than ever
Paul struggles to keep his head above the sand, giving him only a few inches between his face and the top of the coffin
You have to hurry
It's almost full
Just hang in there
Hurry
Please
(to the soldiers) Dig
Dig
Dig
Paul fights to keep his head above the sand
The flashlight dims
can't
are you close
We're almost there, Paul
We're almost there
(to the soldiers) () 88
(') Faster
( ) We're almost there
We're right above you
The level of sand grows even higher
Paul spits away falling sand that threatens to suffocate him
can't hear you
Where are you
We're almost there
is heard - in the b
g
of Dan's phone
(
) There it is
(to the soldiers) Keep digging
Hurry
Please
We see the coffin
Just hang in there
Paul coughs out sand
He has a mere inch left above his head
Hurry
Where are you
don't hear you
Please hurry
The Soldier is again heard - in the b
g
Of Dan's phone
It's clear
(to the soldier) Open it
Nondescript noise is heard through the phone, until it comes to an abrupt stop
() Oh my God
89
What is it
'm so sorry, Paul
What
