Nope

Welles takes out cigarettes, lighting one, takes out a small  and makes notations

Welles' wife, , smiles when she sees him
She's plain and pretty, holding one hand on a   beside her
Welles comes to her, embracing her, appreciating her
Welcome home
Do you know how much  missed you
They kiss, but Amy pulls away, sniffs him
What's this
have you been smoking
Smoking
'm not smoking
Your clothing reeks of it
You know, Amy, 've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy

Before you even "hello," you accuse me
'm not accusing you
Well, 'm not smoking, okay
Okay,  believe you
We've been all through that

He kisses the happy child, holding her in one arm
Let's get my bags and get the hell out of here
Welles pulls Amy close and kisses her again, leads the way
Amy follows, pushing the stroller
How's the detective business

You better not be smoking, that's all  can say
Honey, 'm not, please

Amy covers herself

What's all the trouble, Cinderella
What are you crying about, huh
He lifts and cradles Cindy, comforting her

Welles sits by the Pennsylvania state flag, watching
show the Young Republican and Gaudy Woman in Miami: leaving the Art Deco hotel, the Discotheque, a restaurant
Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night
(clears his throat) The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman
It's unpleasant,  know
apologize
None too discreet, is he
No, sir, he is not
He's an imbecile
tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do
The politician shakes his head in disgust

He takes three steps, releases
Down the lane,

He shouts back at them, laughing, grabbing his beer and drinking, waiting at the ball return

Welles and Amy eat at the kitchen table with Cindy in a high chair
Amy feeds Cindy between bites
Welles is still in his league shirt
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend
Sure

You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it
'm not using him again for anything
He was worthless

Betty's out of town so we're playing next week

(into phone) Hello
sorry,  was switching phones
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Mrs
Christian
(listens) Yes
Yes,  understand
tomorrow evening should be fine
Welles listens, clears space on his desk, taking notes

Far across the room, an old, sad woman,

Mister Welles
You're very prompt
try to be
Welles crosses towards them
It takes a while
appreciate your coming on such short notice
Mrs
Christian holds out her hand and Welles takes it
This is Mister Longdale, my late husband's attorney
Welles shakes Longdale's limp hand, looking him over
Uh huh, pleasure
Apparently Mr
Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and  speak
Yes,  do have something to say insisted on being here as soon as heard Mrs
Christian contacted you
'm listening
As Mr
Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend
Of what sort
You are a private investigator
That's right
Well, whatever reasons Mrs
Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, should certainly be a party to
But, since she feels differently, can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval
Yes, how theatrical
So you've gone on the record, and now perhaps you should just be gone
Longdale's irritated, but has no choice
He walks away
Have a pleasant evening
(to Welles) Will you have tea, Mister Welles
Thank you
Mrs
Christian begins pouring tea from the service on a table
Welles watches Longdale exit
He's odd
He's a lawyer
(offers tea) Please, sit, here
Welles accepts a dainty tea cup and saucer, taking a seat
've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey
Asking about you
must say you have friends in influential places
've been privileged to provide services for people  admire
You are highly recommended
Praised for your discretion
your strict adherence to confidentiality
Welles nods, sipping tea
As you know, my husband passed away recently
Two weeks ago now
My condolences
His passing has left me with
something of a dilemma
terrible, terrible dilemma
'll do whatever  can to help
Mrs
Christian studies Welles

Christian and Welles enter
This office has been lived in for a lifetime
Giant
Walls covered in old b+w  and

Welles looks up at the   over the fireplace:
, a powerful, old man, posed with a dark, teeming, industrial landscape behind him
Not many people have been inside this room
Welles examines  of Mr
Christian visiting various ,   and ground-breaking ceremonies, shaking hands with , with
Pittsburgh
Mostly
That's where he started his empire building
(looks up at portrait) He was a good man
Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated
He wanted to be legendary
He succeeded
We were married forty-five years
Hard even for me to imagine
We had our troubles
There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and  to him
loved him deeply
Welles waits
Do you carry a gun, Mr
Welles
wear a gun when  can tell a client expects me to
Other than that, there's never any reason
Just curious
Mrs
Christian crosses to take down a , revealing a The safe is ajar, burnt and scarred, broken into
My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe
knew about it, but as far as  was concerned it was none of my business
Not till now, that is
You hired someone to open it
'll bet the lawyer loved that
There was nothing he could do
My husband left everything to me
(looks at safe) prevented anyone from seeing the contents
felt these were my husband's private things didn't
didn't realize
Do you want to tell me what you found
Cash, stock certificates, and this
She takes something from her pocket, puts it on the desk: a plastic bag containing a short 8MM  on a plastic reel
It's a film
of a girl being murdered
'm afraid  don't
This is a movie showing a girl being murdered
She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her
and he begins to cut her with a knife
(pause) only watched what  could
Welles picks up the film, looks at it
didn't know what to think can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband
To know that he watched this
this atrocity
But,  can't go to the police
Mrs
Christian
please, will you sit down a moment
(leads her to a chair) want you to listen carefully
What you're talking about is a "snuff film
"  But, from what know, snuff films are a kind of
urban myth
Like, red light district folklore
There's no such thing,  can assure you
Mrs
Christian shakes her head
Please, believe me
This is probably a stag film
Simulated rape
Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic
fake blood and special effects
No
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away
you'd see the tricks they can play
'm telling you it's not that
'm sure it is
(smiles) It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke
More than likely he never even watched it
Will you watch it and see for yourself
Of course
But, 'm certain it's nothing to worry about

Looks like a hotel room
We only ever see three walls
The once beautiful girl looks worn, drugged, dark circles under her eyes, staring blankly
The ' tungsten  casts long, shifting shadows as the camera moves, but the girl still stares oblivious
The bed is wrapped in  and The floor is covered by
Welles watches, crossing his arms, already uncomfortable
: a door opens behind the girl, looks like a bathroom, and a   enters
The Masked Man wears a garish, Mexican   with eye holes and a mouth
The mask covers his entire head
He's naked except for red shorts, his body scrawny, oiled, pale
The man goes to stand in front of the girl
He seems to be saying something to her, but the film is silent and the   is the '  sprocket hole It's all one long take
The   to favor the girl
Welles sits straight in his chair, wary
: Masked Man raises his open hand and  the girl, knocking her back on the bed
Welles grimaces
: Masked Man pulls the girl back to a seated position
The girl's like a rag doll, face reddened, eyes closed, but she remains upright
Masked Man uses his thumbs to open her unseeing eyes
He touches her mouth with his fingers, presses his lips to hers
Then, Masked Man backs away, leaving frame, till the   to find Masked Man standing at a table with  large   laid out
Masked Man runs his fingers over the blades
Welles rises slowly, still watching
: Masked Man selects a huge Bowie knife and moves back towards the girl
Welles crosses his arms tight, disbelieving, fearful
, but Welles does
In the flickering, reflected light, Welles backs involuntarily away from the horrible images, holding his fist to his mouth, breathing hard
Welles keeps backing away, till he's backed against a wall

Welles is sickened, sweating, still watching, till he finally shuts his eyes

Mrs
Christian sits waiting, troubled
The door to the dining room opens and Welles enters from the dark, visibly shaken
Mrs
Christian watches him, her sorrow now shared
You
you need to go to the police
told you  can't, not yet
You don't have any other choice
(stands, shakes her head) No
For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name,  need know that whoever did this will be punished
If you can find them,  will take their names to the police
'll say my husband confessed on his death bed
'll say  didn't have courage to come forward at first
It won't work like that
Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously
've thought about it and there's no other way
If you can't find them
if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well  can't let that happen
'm telling you won't
If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then 'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her
Welles sits, rests his head in his hands

You've found missing persons before
Nothing remotely like this
know what 'm asking
Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk
You'll need cash to buy information, and 'll provide it

Welles sits
What can  do for you, Mr
Welles
Call me Tom
Alright, Tom
What 'd like, very simply, is access to your archive
And, now understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens
There are reasons for the way we do things here
Absolutely
Of course 'll abide by whatever decision you make, but 'd appreciate if you'll hear me out
The director sits back in his chair
Few days ago,  was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife
What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe
They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city
Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone
Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself
(snaps fingers) That's the last they saw her
The reason they came to me for help, the reason 'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch
(shows the he photocopied) They want to see if  can
this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright
Why not go to the
or figured you share information
We do
For whatever reasons  thought you might be more receptive
Why don't they come to me
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved
They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either
You and  both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run
Molestation, whatever
Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal
'm not so sure about this
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear
can give you my card, if your clients want to call me
Welles accepts a , disappointed
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them
Well, that's all  can do
Sorry
Welles looks at the director, stands, hangs his head
Who knows
maybe she's already given her parents a call, right
Welles leaves
,    -- Welles comes out the front doors, pissed
Fuck
He tears the card in half and drops it as he heads for his car
After a moment, the director comes out after him
Excuse me
Tom, hold on
Welles looks back, walks back, glances down
makes sure he stands on the torn card, hiding it underfoot
Listen, maybe  can help after all
Why don't you come on back in
we'll see what we can do

Secretaries tend to the files
This is it
It's not much
(points at computers) We've got less than five percent on computer and we lose that funding in December
'll have someone show it to you anyway
Other than that, 'm afraid it's the wet thumb method
Welles looks to the many, many file drawers
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance
We try to keep the children and adults separate
No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall
Any good
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me
You're sure you don't mind
It's good what you're doing

Christian
Tom Welles
Here's where we stand
checked the film stock and it's called Supra- lux 544
The company that made that stock discontinued it in '92
(listens) Yeah, about five or six years ago
Anyway, do what you can to dig up your husband's old financial records, look for anything out of the ordinary

: endless  of
The in (
, cont) Nobody really uses eight millimeter film anymore, so we can assume there are reasons our guys did
First, they could develop it themselves if they had any sort of expertise
Obviously, this isn't the kind of movie you can just drop off at the one-hour photo
'  --  -- Welles just stands, staring at the  of the
(
, cont) Second, the film that went through the camera is what we've got
There's no negative
Unlike video, it wasn't meant to be duplicated
No reason for them to risk having more than one copy of their murder floating around

He's moved on to the physical files, at one table, looking through  of Secretaries tend to other files
(
, cont) It's okay for yours and your husbands fingerprints to be on the film, but you'll have to use me as a middleman if you go to the police
That way  don't have to explain why my prints are on it
'  --  -- Welles sits with the  , watching the film again
(
, cont) There were three men
Two are obvious; the man in the mask and the man running the camera, but  caught a glimpse of a third man in a mirror
It's nothing that can be used for identification, but he was there, watching
: Masked Man touches the girl's mouth, presses his lips to hers
Masked Man backs away, leaving frame, till the   to find Masked Man standing at a table with  large   laid out
Welles notices something, puts the projector on
(
, cont) So, there were three
They would have kept it small, wouldn't have let anyone in on it they didn't have to
That's all for now
except, feel  should tell you
with this looking like it happened at least five or six years ago
Welles walks to the frozen  on the wall
It shows the Masked Man's hands in frame, fingering the blades

He backtracks to the pretty  with the ribbon in her hair

He reaches into his pocket, hands shaking a little, takes out and unfolds the  he printed of the girl from the snuff film

Welles compares the two pictures
She's prettier in the card catalog photo, but it's her

Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit
If you have any time over the next few days, 'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter

'm sorry, let me explain, the is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington
'm sure you've dealt with them before
Yes, but
These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement
The
brought me in to review their investigations
(holds up clipboard) fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different
'm here for a few days, before  head back up to Virginia
These reports go to the Justice Department eventually
spoke to your
contact a few days ago, uh
Welles pretends to look for the name on a Jiffy Lube page
What was the name
've got it here somewhere
Neil
Neil Cole
(pretends he found it) Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me
He didn't call
No
(looking on legal pad) Well, 'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair
Born April 24, 1976
Missing June 11th, 1992 runaway, that's how she's listed
Is this information correct
Mrs
Mathews stares, nods
'm sorry,  know this isn't easy
Is there a more convenient time
(looks at watch) Can  buy you lunch, would that be alright
Mrs
Mathews looks him up and down
-- Welles and Mrs
Mathews eat at a   on the patio
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations
It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts
All 'm saying is, please know, 'm not here to create any false hope
They hired you
You're like, a private detective
That's exactly what  am
Mrs
Mathews chews, staring off into the distance
didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on
You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat
Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses
Want to know what it's really like
It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him
Glamorous, huh
And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her
Mrs
Mathews smiles
It's refreshing to actually sit down and meet someone face to face, someone nice like you
Welles smiles
Mrs
Mathews takes out a cigarette
Welles lights her, joins her in smoking, refers to his clipboard
So, she didn't leave a note
She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left
No
She just seemed
depressed
She didn't seem herself
For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it
One night we went to bed
the next morning she was gone
She took some clothes
What was she running from
don't know
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but  have to ask
Your husband
he committed suicide
Yes
September 4th, 1993
About a year after Mary disappeared
We were divorced by then
Things fell apart
he was living with a friend
Why do you think he did it
It got to be too much for him
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances
with your daughter
(pause) Were there any indications of
any sort of abuse
There wasn't anything like that
The police and the  people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never
My husband
his heart broke when Mary left
didn't mean to
You try going through what we did
Bob couldn't take it, that's all
Christ, there's times when it still seems like  can't either
had to ask
apologize
No one knows what it's like
You can't even imagine how much it hurts
Welles is miserable
few  walk past, looking at Mrs
Mathews
She tries not to notice then noticing
People remember me from the news
(pause) Can you drive me back now
Of course
, '  -- Mrs
Mathews enters
Welles follows
This was the girl's room, exactly as she left it -- of  on the wall, many   on the pink sheets of the carefully made bed
Perfectly preserved
This is her room
Welles looks around, uncomfortable
Shelves have  of  with female friends, a collection of   of  and
The police made a wreck of it, but put it back exactly how it was
Just how she likes it
Welles takes a few steps into the room, looks down at a where there are  brightly wrapped
Those are for her birthday
One for every year she's missed
They'll be waiting for her when she comes back
Welles is nearly overwhelmed by sadness, struggling to hide it
He backs to the door, looks at his watch
shouldn't take anymore of your time
Maybe we can finish tomorrow
'll call tomorrow
Okay
-- Welles escapes to his car, climbing in
He starts it up
Welles drives, tears welling up in his eyes
He has to pull over and park, wiping his tears, fighting for composure
'  -- Welles has unpacked
He's on the bed, on his
(into phone) You should be able to take a shower and still have hot water left, honey
(listens) Call him back and tell him  said so
The goddamn thing's still under warranty
(listens) 'm okay
It's hard here
It's hard
(listens) 've got a lead  have to follow through
To be honest,  don't think 'm going to get very far
miss you
love you
,  -- Welles sits at the kitchen table
Mrs
Mathews makes coffee
The home's decor is cheap and flowery
We weren't religious
We never forced religion down her throat, like 've seen some parents do to their kids
We never made her go to church
But, after Mary was gone, that's when  got religious
Mrs
Mathews brings two cups of coffee, sits
Doesn't make much sense, does it
When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother
Then, something horrible happens
that's when you start praying all the time
That's when you start going to church
We're all like that
Are you religious
No
You should be
Mrs
Mathews drinks coffee, stares into the cup
've got what  need for my report
There is
there is one thing that bothers me though
What
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either
See,  know a little about missing persons
When kids run, they almost always leave a note
It's guilt
They want to say goodbye
There wasn't one
The police looked
Do you think the police did a good job
don't know
think so
It is possible
and  know this isn't something you want to hear
Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it
She might have wanted to tell you something
No
You don't have any reason to think that
If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place
Mrs
Mathews is getting upset
How
how can you say that to me
Will you let me look
My husband never laid a hand on her
She would have told me
she would have told me
You're probably right, and probably won't find anything
don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go
Police are just as human as you or
They could have missed something
They probably didn't
(pause) Wouldn't you rather know
Mrs
Mathews thinks about it, tortured, shakes her head sadly
Go ahead and look if you want don't care what you do

Mathews gets up and walks out of the room

He goes to the substantial , picks up a porn tabloid, pages through it
He selects sex  and , choosing about twenty-five

guess so
Can  interest you in a battery operated-vagina
Pardon me
My boss tells me  have to do more suggestive selling
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one

Max shoves everything into a bag and hands it over
Thank you for shopping at Adult Bookstore

What's your name, if you don't mind me asking
Max
Well, here's the deal, Max
This thing 'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography

Your education begins tonight
-- Against the backdrop of downtown 's bright skyscrapers, Welles' rental car heads into the lower bowels of the city, smaller, older, darker buildings
-- The only people on the street are  and Welles' car makes its way to a big deserted There are a few cars parked in one corner
Welles parks near the other cars and gets out
Max stands against a chain link fence
Welles goes to meet him
Come on
Max leads the way, across the lot, towards dark alleyways
-- Max and Welles move through this filth strewn alley between decaying brink buildings
They cone to a  leading down to pitch dark
-- Max enters through a crooked door, heads into a narrow, labyrinth hallway lit by bare bulbs
Welles follows
They come to another  leading down
At the bottom, a thick-necked  stands guarding double doors
Are you a law enforcement agent or in any way affiliated with law enforcement
Fuck you, Larry
Max heads to the double doors, waits for Welles
(to Welles) Are you a law enforcement
No
-- Max and Welles enter through the double doors, into a kind of small, underground porn flea market
It's incredibly quiet
About fifteen   are set up in rows
The behind the tables and the thirty or so "" looking through the merchandise make those in the previous porn shops look like high society
These are - , most balding, some with pot bellies, in shorts and tube socks, in sweatpants and Members Only jackets: plain men, but with a look of desperation in their eyes, glancing around nervously, greasy and afraid
We're shutting down in fifteen minutes
Fifteen minutes
Welles makes his way to the tables, wary
One table is covered in dirty cardboard boxes, filled with  of of young children, mostly boys, naked
Each photo is wrapped in plastic, censored by masking tape
Welles swallows back disgust
The next table is piled high with used pornographic There are baggies with   laid out
-rated Polaroids wrapped in rubberbands
Max follows behind, unaffected, smokes a cigarette
Another table offers   with no identifying marks other than hand written labels with numbers written out, two, " " sixteen, " " five
"  And many bootleg  with grainy, homemade labels showing  in extreme
Welles watches out the corner of his eye as the beside him pays for a thick stack of kiddie porn pictures
Welles waits till the man moves on, addresses the angry looking  who's counting money
(points to numbered videos) What are these
Mixed hard bondage
Rape films
Sick shit
Buy five, get one free
Welles looks around, wipes sweat off his top lip
Anything harder
There's nothing harder
Snuff
What you see is what  got, mister
You know where  can get it
have a lot of money to spend
There ain't no such thing as snuff
Why don't you fuck off
The dealer sits and keeps counting cash
Welles moves on Beyond the tables there's a Welles walks to it, enters
Folding chairs face a

hairy, overweight  lays face down on an examination table, naked, arms tied behind his back
In the darkness, a  shifts in his chair, grunting, obviously masturbating

approaches Welles from the dark
You have to pay to come in here
Welles backs away, shuts the curtain
-   -- Not many people in the place
Welles drinks coffee
Max eats a huge breakfast
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc
Nobody even considers them pornography anymore
Then, there's mainstream hardcore
Triple The difference is penetration
That's hardcore
That whole industry's up in the valley
Writers, directors, porn stars
They're celebrities, or they think they are
They pump out 150 videos a week week They've even got a porno Academy Awards
America loves pornography
Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying
Somebody's buying those videos
Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex
Know what else
It's only gonna get worse
More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution
Desensitization
Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive
Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out
Know what  mean
For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while
They have to be the biggest tits ever
Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally
Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films
People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds
There's nowhere else for it to go
Interesting theory
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend
We're talking about stuff where people get hurt
Specialty product
Child pornography
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal
Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites
it's beyond hardcore, but legal
This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love
Now, with some of the + and bondage films, they straddle the line
How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not
Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn
Rape films, but there aren't many
've never seen one
Snuff films
heard you asking
That guy wasn't yanking you around
There's no such thing
What other ways are there to get illegal films
Who do you see
First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer
It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet
Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants
It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks
They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em
But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where work sometimes
No one knows where it comes from
That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth
Those are zombies, hardcore junkies
Their hands are permanently pruned
They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister
Other than that, all know about is the mail
Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes
Secret couriers
Credit card orders to dummy corporations
Interstate wire transfers
Revolving
boxes
But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit
who knows
That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal
There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is
Welles watches Max eat
How old are you
Twenty-five
Where are your parents
don't know, where are yours
don't mean any offense
but what are you doing mixed up in all this
'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed
What are you talking about
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else
Yeah, 'm a real genius
What choices have  got
Fuck, just because  know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean  deal it work a job
It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers
You're telling me it doesn't get to you
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb
So what
Am  gonna go off and be a race car driver
Go to Harvard
Run for President
What about you, pops
What about me
see a ring on your finger
You have any kids
daughter
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania
what are you doing mixed up in all this

Come in
Make yourself comfortable
Welles shakes Dino's hand
Max looks up at the walls
; porn pictures, news photos, world leaders, autopsy photos, armies and insects, the naked and the dead
It's an honor to meet you
Thank you for seeing us
What can  do for you today
Welles sits
Shelves behind Dino's desk are piled high with , old  , big  of 16mm
and  are stacked everywhere
'd like to commission a work
'm a great admirer of yours
Flattering
And, who's your colorful little chum
fellow investor
Hmm
You're the only one still shooting film and transferring it to video
Nobody appreciates that kind of integrity anymore
the grain, the gritty look you get
Well, 'm glad you appreciate it
(to Welles) What would you say is your favorite piece
Welles considers
Max glances over, looks back to the walls
know if  had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil
" "Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but 'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite
Dino grins, showing yellowed teeth
You said something about money
Yes
What we're looking for is rather specific
Welles takes out an , puts it on the desk
That's five thousand dollars
Is it
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery
Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts
Hard bondage, or course
Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation,  have only two stipulations
And they are
want to watch you work
'll consider it
And the other performer
it has to be that monster you use
the man in the mask
Machine
If it's not him, there's no deal
Dino drums his painted fingernails on his lips
He might be interested
but it would mean another five thousand
We can do that
Well, well, 'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this
You'll leave the money as a deposit
(off Welles' nod) Very good
Dino stands, picks up a still  off his desk and comes to look at Welles, studying him
You have a beautiful face
the way the light hits it
'd like to take your picture
You don't mind
'd rather you didn't
What's the problem
'm camera shy
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture
Those are two different kinds of trust
(stands) Thank you for your time
hope we can do business
Welles leaves
Max goes with him
Dino watches them leave

large gathers
One windshield's shattered, blood spattered
The driver is slumped over the wheel, gushing blood

It will be his pleasure

) Brooklyn
Don't be late

Max and Welles sit in lawn chairs at the tiny pool
Welles smokes
Max drinks beer
They watch an   in a one piece bathing suit climb from the pool and walk to the diving board, diving in
What's next
'm trying to figure that out myself
have to see Machine without his mask
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing
Nope
The old woman climbs out and heads back to the diving board
Welles takes out a thick , hands it to Max
This is for you
Max doesn't understand, opens the envelope, finds about fifteen thousand dollars in the envelope
What's this
It's money
People use it to purchase goods and services
Max looks at it again, can't believe it
Look
that's awful generous and everything
It's not my money
The woman  got it from is never going to give it a second thought
Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay
(pause) Go be a race car driver
Go run for President
Whatever
Welles puts his cigarette out, stands
'll see you around
Welles walks away, heading to his room
Max watches him go, doesn't know what to say, looks in the envelope
The old woman climbs out and heads back to the diving board
-- deserted, war zone neighborhood of abandoned, graffittied buildings
few burnt out cars on the street
Welles drives through, watchful
Welles drives past a huge - , does a u-turn
He parks the car
'  -- Welles checks his gun, returns it to his holster
-- Welles climbs crumbling concrete stairs, looking all directions, crossing a   towards a
-- Welles enters slowly, trying to get his eyes to adjust to the darkness
vast, empty space looms before him
In the middle of the warehouse, Dino Velvet stands, in a powder blue suit, holding an archery  and
There you are
Come join us
There's a wrought   not far from Dino
is seated on the mattress, a huge man, wearing a leather + harness and the same   as in the snuff film
Welles gathers his courage, walks towards them
Dino pulls back on the bow, aiming away across the warehouse
He stands by a  with a  of propped up
He shoots an arrow toward a large
Strikes the target dead center, '-
As Welles gets closer, he notices several things
a 16MM  mounted on a , facing the bed, along with several movie several   are laid out on the table, beside a pair of
Machine is watching him as he approaches
Welles stops, not far from Dino and Machine, but keeping his distance
Dino's still firing arrows at the target
Machine's still staring at Welles
(to Machine) Hello
Machine just stares at him with bloodshot eyes
You brought the money
(takes out envelope) Right here
Dino lets fly another arrow
another bull's-eye, then turns to look at Welles with a smile
Excellent
Where are the women
They should be here any minute
Welles comes forward slowly, places the envelope on the table, beside Bowie knifes
He's sweating
(of the knifes) What are these for
Hmm
Oh, the knifes
They're just props
Nice, aren't they
Sure
Dino walks across towards the target
Machine and  were just talking about knifes
The beauty of knifes
Dino pulls arrows from the target
He was saying how fascinated he is by their simple ability to be sharp
The ability of a piece of metal to be so thin that it is almost nothing
Dino walks back to the table, replaces the arrows in the quiver, cueing another arrow in is bow
So close to nothingness that it cuts with minimum effort, because it's so non-intrusive
Flesh is fooled
It blooms open as the blade widens, but by then it's too late, because the knife's already doing its pure, simple damage
Dino shoots another arrow to the target
attracts Welles attention
Far across the warehouse, a   rolls upwards
with tinted windows drives in
The  who opened the door, silhouetted in sunlight, stays behind to close the door as the car pulls forward
Ah, ours guests have arrived
Machine stands
He is a giant
Welles takes a few steps back, wary, sweating hard now
The car parks across the warehouse, not far from the target
Dino puts another arrow in his bow, pulls it taunt, aims at the target
turns, aims the arrow at Welles
Mister Welles
would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person
What are you
Take out your gun
Welles brings his hand towards his holster
Slowly
Let me see it
Welles takes out his gun, looks across the warehouse
The   is walking this way
Can't tell who he is yet
Machine heads the direction of the parked car
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully
Look,  don't know what this
Shut up, cunt
Do exactly as  say, or 'll put this arrow through your throat
Welles obeys, helpless, dumps the bullets out on the table
The  ' getting closer
It's Eddie Poole
Is that him
(to Welles) Put the gun down, take the handcuffs
Handcuff yourself to the bed
Welles obeys, walks to the bed
Welles attaches one cuff to the bed's iron rail, fastens the other cuff around his wrist
Dino puts down the bow and arrow
(still to Welles) Didn't know what to make of you at first, and you certainly had Eddie on pins and needles
But, lo and behold, from out of the blue came an old business acquaintance to explain everything
Welles looks across to the car
The sinister lawyer, Longdale, gets out from behind the wheel and hands the keys to Machine, walks this way
This is the fucker
Motherfucker, doesn't look like anything
Eddie walks around the bed, studies Welles
Welles watches him
Eddie goes to stand behind Welles, rushes forward
Welles in the side of the head
Welles goes down, clutching his face
Doesn't look like shit
Eddie pulls Welles to his feet, throws him against the bed, frisking him from head to toe
Longdale comes to stand beside Dino, nervous, taking out a tiny  and pointing it at Welles
Welles looks up, holding his head, afraid, sits on the bed
(to Welles) You remember Mr
Longdale, don't you
remember him
Let's get this over with
Fine idea
Dino comes to sit on the bed beside Welles
You're going to go get the film you received from Mrs
Christian, bring it here and put it in my hand
And to save time, so we make this as efficient as possible, there's an incentive
Dino puts his fingers in his mouth, lets out a sharp
Across the warehouse, Machine uses the car keys to open the trunk of the car, pulls  out
It's Max, beaten bloody, bound, face swollen, gagged, hardly conscious
Machine throws him to the floor
No
Welles tries to go towards Max, yanked back by the handcuffs, pulls the bed a few inches, but it's heavy
Friend of yours
Look, he's got nothing to do with this
let him go
Can you guess what 'm going to say next
He doesn't know anything
he's got nothing to do with this
Bring the film, or we kill him
Sorrow and rage rises up in Welles, but there's no choice
'll get it
It's in a safe deposit box, in the city
How cooperative
Longdale will keep you company
Dino takes out  , throws them to Longdale
Longdale approaches Welles carefully, unlocking him
Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas
If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead
and so will Max
Move it, dirtbag
Eddie comes to  Welles
Welles stumbles to the ground, gets to his feet
Welles walks, takes one last glance back towards Max
Longdale follows
(watching them go) Do hurry
-- Welles' car moves in the slow flow of traffic into mid-town
'  -- Welles is at the wheel
Longdale is in the passenger seat, gun held in his lap
You were the middleman, am  right
Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy
And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film
That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege
That's trust
Mr
Christian trusted me implicitly
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything
Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money
was well compensated
That's why you got scared when Mrs
Christian hired me
You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe
How'd you find me
Never mind how  found you
Followed me
must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies
They're no friends of mine
Except, you're willing commit murder with them
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone
If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago
girl no one even remembers
Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name
Her mom remembers her
Welles looks at Longdale
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right
Wanted them to find you one
Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one
Shut up
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered
Shut your mouth and drive
Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up
Tell me, because really want to understand
Did he jerk off to it
You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched
Longdale jams the gun against Welles' side
You're making me very angry
Just tell me
Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared
What kind of degenerate pervert was he really
What the fuck did he want with a snuff film
You're asking me why
'm asking
Longdale sits back, wipes sweat from his face
man like Mr
Christian, a great man
all his money, all his power
a man who attained everything there was to attain
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered
Isn't it incredibly obvious
Enlighten me
Because he could
He did it because he could
(pause) What other reason were you looking for
Welles tightens his grip on the wheel, numbed
-- Welles double parks, puts his hazard lights on
'  -- Longdale sits forward, looks to the bank
You've got four minutes till  call Mr
Velvet and let him know there's a problem
Longdale takes a   from his pocket, shows it
Welles climbs out, heading to the bank
,    -- Welles and the    enter
They go to put their  in one drawer, unlocking it a pulling it out
May  show you to a booth
No, 've got it
Welles pulls the drawer open, takes the 8MM film out and hands the empty drawer to the manager, exiting
-- Welles comes out from the   , pocketing the film, crossing towards the entrance, looking around
at other  waiting on line
at a  with a  at his side
Welles detours, toward one of the
The behind the desk is occupied, on the phone
As Welles moves past the desk, he grabs a  of from a pencil holder and palms it, heading to the door
'  -- Welles gets behind the wheel
Longdale looks at his watch
You almost went over your limit
Fuck you
Welles puts the car in gear and drives
Give me the film
You'll get it when we get there
Longdale puts the gun to the side of Welles' head
Give me the film
Go ahead, shoot me
Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield
Welles keeps driving
Longdale sits back, stewing
-- The door is kicked open
Welles enters, takes the 8MM out and holds it in his hand
Longdale follows
As Welles moves forward, his face goes slack
Machine is seated on the bed, Eddie and Dino stand smoking cigarettes, and further on, Max is tied to the target, slumped over, three arrows in his chest Dead
No
Welles runs towards Max, crying out, tears in his eyes
Machine rises, goes to intercept Welles, grabbing him
Welles tries to break free, but Machine lifts Welles up and throws him brutally to the ground
Welles scrambles to get up
You fuckers
Eddie comes to  Welles in the face
Welles is sent sprawling, blood gushing from his nose
He lays there, stunned, weeping
Eddie pries the 8MM  from Welles' hand, tosses it
Dino catches the film
Machine comes to drag Welles towards the bed
Dino unspools the film, holding it up to examine it
Machine handcuffs Welles to the metal bedframe
Welles falls to his knees, holding his face
Eddie  Welles in the head
You're a dead man
Leave him alone
Fuck off
Eddie  Welles in the kidney
Welles tries to protect himself
Eddie raises his fist to punch again, but Machine catches Eddie's fist, throws Eddie back
What the fuck
promised him to Machine
Eddie looks up at Machine, who towers over him
sorry
First things first
You might want to watch this, Mr
Welles
Welles looks up through tears
Dino drops the 8MM  on the floor, takes a small bottle of lighter fluid from his pocket
Longdale comes to watch
Welles watches helpless, agonizing
Don't
please
Dino drops the film to the floor, sprays it with fluid, takes out matches, light one, drops it
The 8MM  goes up in flame
Welles watches, quaking, hysterical, trying to pull himself towards the flame, dragging the bed
The film is destroyed by flame
Welles gives up, presses his face to the floor, eyes shut
And so it ends
It's as if she never existed
Welles falls back, gasping, wiping blood and tears and spittle from his face, getting slowly, to his feet
Don't blame yourself
You were in way over your head
He looks to Max's corpse, to the smoldering film
Swallowing back his fear, panic and rage
Motherfuckers
Small time, motherfuckers
Tell me something
Welles spits blood, hangs onto the bed for support
know why you did it, Dino, Eddie
but, why'd the lawyer do it
Must have been a helluva lot of money, right
One fuckload of money
Welles sits on the bed, eyes burning with fury
So, what are you all still doing small time, huh
What are you still doing in the sewer, Eddie
Christian gave Longdale a million dollars to find him a snuff film
How much did you ever see
Eddie and Dino look to Longdale
What's he talking about
One million dollars, Dino
How much did he tell you he had
Longdale's getting very nervous
He's lying
Look at him
You think he played it square
How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself
Eddie walks towards Longdale
What the fuck's he talking about
Longdale takes out his gun, aims it at Machine, Dino and Eddie, scared
Stay away from me
What's going on, Longdale
Did this happen
You sell us short, you fuck
Stay back
You have a gun, Eddie, show it to me
Now
Eddie slowly takes out his gun, seething
Put it on the ground, kick it here
Eddie puts the gun down, kicks it
Longdale picks it up, throws it far away
You fucking lawyer
Move back
All of you
move
Machine, Dino and Eddie stand between Longdale and the car with tinted windows parked across the warehouse
What were you thinking
Welles watches as Machine, Dino and Eddie back slowly away from Longdale
Longdale's gun hand is shaky
Welles tries to drag himself towards the table where his gun and bullets are, dragging the bed, inch by inch
Longdale back away, trying to angle around the menacing trio so he can get to the car
Back off
Everything's been taken care of, and 'm leaving now
You're not going anywhere if you fucked us, lawyer
'm leaving
You got the guts, tough guy
Gonna kill us all, is that it
You betrayed us
Stay where you are
Machine edges forward, holding his hands in the air
Longdale brandishes the gun
Keep back
Machine, Eddie and Dino are held at bay
You're not gonna live through this
Welles still tries to get to the table, wrist bleeding in the cuff, bed screeching across the floor
Machine, hands up, slowly reaches behind his shoulder, touches the handle of a huge  sheathed to his back
Our business is done, 'm leaving, no one's going to stop me
Longdale glances towards the car, seems like he's about to make a run for it
Dino Velvet takes a step forward
Fuck you
Machine unsheathes the  and
The knife imbeds to the hilt in Longdale's chest and Longdale's gun
Dino Velvet flies backwards, shot in the face
Dino hits the ground, screaming, writhing, hands to his face, blood pouring out between his fingers
Longdale falls back onto his ass, sitting there, eyes bugged out in surprise
He looks down at the knife in his chest
Machine lets out a , runs to Dino
Machine falls to his knees and grips Dino, tries to hold him
Dino's screaming, squirming frantically
Longdale sits looking down at the knife in his chest, looks up, and gallons of blood pour from his mouth
Fuck
Eddie comes to look down at the Longdale
Longdale falls back, dead, blood still flowing from his maw
Welles drags the heavy bed, getting closer to the table
Eddie spins, looks across to see Welles struggling
Dino breaks free from Machine, runs blindly, still holding his gushing face, falls, tries to get back up
Eddie runs towards Welles
Dino stumbles forwards, writhing, then suddenly lays still
Machine rises, looking at Dino
Tears come out from Machine's eyes and roll down his mask
One last gasp and shudder from Dino's body; death rattle
Welles pulls the bed, practically pulling his arm from the socket, desperately clawing towards the table
The table is mere feet away
Eddie arrives,  Welles in the ribs
Welles recoils
Eddies  again
Welles curls into a ball
Eddie  again
(
) Eddie stops, looks to Machine
He's mine
Machine strides over the Longdale's corpse, puts his foot on Longdale's chest, yanks out the knife
Machine starts this way
Eddie backs from Welles
Welles looks up, trying to shake off unconsciousness, sees Machine coming
Welles bows down, on his knees, as if to accept his fate
Reaching his free hand into his suit pocket
No, no, no
please, don't kill me
please
Machine arrives, knife in hand, lifts Welles' head back by the hair, brings the knife hand back
Do him good
Welles rises suddenly, arm shooting forward, deep in Machine stomach
Machine , falling back, pitching forward
Machine's knife clatters to the ground
Eddie's eyes go wide
Machine hits the floor, clutching his guts
Welles pushes upwards with all he's got left, turns the iron bedframe onto its side, flipping the mattress off
Eddie moves forward, furious
Welles grabs Machine's knife, wielding it, holding Eddie off
Back off, Eddie
Welles drags the now lightened bed frame towards the table
Eddie's sorely tempted, but keeps away
Eddie turns, looks across the warehouse
There's his gun, lying there, far away
Eddie runs for the gun
Welles pulls himself to the table, reaches for the gun, knocks the table over
He's got the gun, but
Bullets hit the floor as the table falls
Welles struggles to open his gun with his sole free hand, gets it open, holds it between his knees
Welles grabs a bullet
Eddie's running toward his gun, gasping for air
Machine's on his knees, pulling the scissors out with trembling hands
Welles puts the bullet in the gun, flips it shut, rises, taking aim across the warehouse
Stop Eddie
Eddie's running
(pulls back the hammer) swear to Christ 'll shoot you in the back
Eddie stops, hands up, about ten feet from his gun
Machine stays on his knees, holding his bleeding stomach
Welles points his gun at Machine
Come back, or  put a hole in him
Eddie's looking at his gun, so close, so far away
You might make it to your gun, but not before  shoot Machine
And if have to shoot him because of you, and  don't kill him, right after he kills me, he's gonna kill you
Eddie turns, starts walking back
(to Machine) Take off the mask
Machine shakes his head
Take it off
You got one bullet
Welles looks to see Eddie heading back, keeps the gun on Machine, backs away, dragging the bed frame, looks to the behind him
The only choice you have now, is which one of us kills you
Welles backs away, drags the bedframe
Eddie's getting close
Welles points the gun at Eddie
Eddie slows
Welles points the gun at Machine, points the gun at Eddie
Welles puts the gun to the chain of his handcuffs,
breaks the handcuff chain
Welles bolts to the door
Get the gun
Eddie runs back towards his gun
Machine rises with a grunt of pain, moves towards the door, but agony doubles him back over to his knees

Welles drops the Thomas Guide on the coffee table, picks Eddie up, throws him back onto the couch
'm gonna kill you
Don't bore me with that bullshit
How'd you find me here
Welles  Eddie in the ear
Don't ask questions
Fuck you
Welles  Eddie in the same ear
Eddie's hurting
Welles rubs his aching knuckles
Starting to recognize a pattern
What do you want
Who is Machine

will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude
What the fuck am  gonna protect that freak for
He was Dino's boy, not mine
He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on
Nobody knows
Welles kicks junk off a chair, sits, takes out his gun
Okay, we'll come back to that
So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it
It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film
And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up
Yeah, the fucking lawyer
Told him you could get him a snuff film
Yeah
How much did he pay you
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker
That's all
Thirty each
That's all it took for you to murder her
It was a lot of fucking money
Welles stands and paces, despairing
He picks up a  and throws it,  a , keeps pacing
So
you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine
And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models
And she never walked out
Something like that
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up
What the fuck do you want from me
want to know
want to know exactly what you did to her
Fuck you then, you want to know talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star
told her  was gonna get her a screen test, and while 'm doing that,  got her a soda and dropped a mickey
When it was dark enough,  rang Dino and told him it was go time,  put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it
That's what happened
She's dead
She's been dead a long fucking time
Nobody fucking cares
Welles puts down his gun, picks up the Thomas Guide, holding it in both hands,  --  Eddie across the face
Eddie's stunned, lips bleeding
He faces forward
You wanted to know, now you know
Welles  the Thomas Guide --  Eddie's face again
Welles drops the Thomas Guide in a chair, picks up his gun, leaves the room
'  -- Welles enters, starts looking through , searching
He finds , selects a serrated
'   -- Welles returns, goes to grasp Eddie by the shirt collar, drags him to the floor, face down
Welles stands on Eddie's neck, uses the knife to cut the duct tape on Eddie's hands
That's right, motherfucker, cut me loose
Be a man
Welles tosses the knife, gun trained on Eddie, picks up the Thomas Guide and throws it at Eddie
Show me
Eddie, hands now free, pushes himself to a seated position, looks at the Thomas Guide
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it
Why
Because we're going there
134  -- Welles' rental car  down the highway, east towards Pasadena, leaving the City of Los Angeles on the horizon
-- Welles' car travels a winding  that serpentines up into the scenic, forested
-- The sun is low
Big Bear Lake is vast, surrounded by wilderness on all sides
Welles' car follows a - that runs along the lake's southern shore
Welles' car passes sporadic   and
-- Heavy forests border close to the road
Welles' car travels alone, headlights on, slowing as it comes to an overgrown gravel  with a rusty  strung across it
Welles leans forward to look up at an old  of broken neon and peeled paint: " Big Bear Motor Lodge
Welles pulls forward, puts the car in reverse
Welles' car backs up, angling, till the rear bumper comes against the chain,

Welles turns out headlights and parks
He gets out, walks to look up the driveway

Welles goes to his car, unlocks the trunk and opens it
Eddie's lying in there, arms and legs bound, gagged
-- The door is shoved inward, hanging crooked by one hinge
Eddie enters first, hands still bound behind him
Welles pushes Eddie forward, gun out
Welles turns on his penlight , shining it into the room
There dead leaves all over the floor
The room's empty except for a  lying on its side
Welles sweeps the room with the inadequate light
This is where Mary Anne Mathews died, vaguely recognizable from the snuff film, without the furniture
What are we doing here
Welles goes to the bathroom door, keeping the gun trained on Eddie, pushes the bathroom door open with his foot
The bathroom's cracked  reflects the penlight and Welles' palely lit face
That night
you didn't have to be in the room, but you were
(looks to Eddie) Why
Why did you watch
Eddie goes to the chair, tips it upright with his foot, sits
don't know
felt like it never saw anyone get done before
You enjoy it
Made me sick, but what did  care
What did  care if some hump wants to beat off to that
It was just something  was doing for money
Tell me what happened
What do you want to know
You saw it, you saw the loop
Nobody saw you bring her in
There wasn't nobody around
This place was a shit-hole
backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries
Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work
What did you do with her body
Took it out the bathroom window
Buried it in the woods
Show me
-- Eddie and Welles come around the corner of the abandoned motel, Eddie leading the way, Welles following with gun and flashlight, into the dense forest
What are you thinking you're gonna do
Welles shoves Eddie ahead
Keep moving
Where do you think you're taking this, huh
Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death
Gonna make everything right with the world
How you gonna do that
Welles and Eddie come over a hill, deeper into the forest
You can't go to the cops
All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing
Stop talking
You got absolute zero
Show me where you buried her
don't know
(nods to forest) out there somewhere
Where
Show me where
fucking don't know
What do you think
we weren't burying treasure
We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it
We dug a hole and we put her in it
Your guess is as good as mine
Welles walks ahead of Eddie, distraught, shining his flashlight ahead across the indecipherable forest floor
You'll never find her
Nobody ever will, and even if they did, it doesn't mean nothing
Bring in the cops, bring in the
, fuck 'em all
Without the film, it never happened
Don't you get it
It's over
You can't do anything
Welles turns, aims his gun at Eddie, furious
can kill you
can leave you out here, just like you left her
Eddie's not backing down
Do it
Don't think  won't
Do it
Put me out of my misery so don't have to listen to you whining anymore
You think it's so easy
Easy enough for you
never killed anyone
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it
"  Almost makes you worse
What do you want
You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby
Eddie walks towards Welles
Welles backs away
Where you going
You're the one with the gun
Aren't  defenseless enough
Come on
Eddie comes ahead, defiant, the gun inches from his face
Go ahead and kill me
Kill me with that gun, your gun, right, registered in your name
Dig the hole yourself, with your bare hands, bury the body with your bullets in it
Fucking do it
Welles step forward, presses the gun against Eddie's forehead, pulls back the hammer
Eddie just stares back at Welles with hatred in his eyes
Welles is terrified, unsure
trying to muster the courage to do it
gun hand trembling
finger on the trigger
-- Eddie's thrown face down to the floor
Welles comes to sit on Eddie's back, facing Eddie's feet, holsters his gun, takes out duct tape and grabs Eddie's feet, wrapping them
You pussy
Welles keeps going around Eddie's ankles with the duct tape, till Eddie's securely bound
He rips the tape roll free and gets up, walking out
Fucking pussy
-- Welles pulls the door closed behind him, walks to his car
Welles opens the passenger door and sits, shaken, at his wit's end
He opens the glove compartment, finds cigarettes, digs one out and lights it
He looks back to the motel room
He looks down to the glove compartment, at his After a moment, Welles picks up the phone, looks at it in his hand
Welles gets out of the car, gets up on the hood, lays back, staring at the sky
He closes his eyes, smokes
Welles opens the phone, looks at the illuminated numbers
He digs in his suit jacket pocket, takes out his notepad, pages through, studies one page
Welles sits up
He gathers himself, throws his cigarette, dials a number, puts the cellular to his ear, afraid

She wanted to be an actress

Tears comes to Welles' eyes
It's the hardest thing he's ever had to do in his entire life

Welles falls back against the car, holds his head, weeping
'm sorry, 'm so sorry
there wasn't anything anyone could do
Welles pushes disconnect, lowers the phone, drops it to the ground, utterly drained
He puts his forearm over his eyes, gasping, sucking air
He looks to the motel room, tamping down his sorrow, willing it to fuel his rage
He takes out his gun, hands unsteady, determined, opens the gun and pours the bullets out
He closes the gun and walks towards the motel room
-- Welles  the door aside
The door's hinge breaks and the door falls
Eddie sits propped up against one wall, turns to look
The door  to the floor
Welles moves forward, enraged, closing on Eddie, raising his arm with the gun grasped by the butt

Welles  the gun down at Eddie's head

We can't see anything but the through the open door of the room

Finally, Welles comes to the doorway, in shock, steadying himself against the door frame, shirt and suit spattered red
His gun hand and gun are soaked with dripping blood
Welles looks back into the room, backing away
He turns and goes to his car
Welles climbs in the driver's side, shoves his bloody gun into his holster, tries to wipe blood from his hand onto his shirt, revolted
He starts the car
' ,   -- Welles enters and crosses through
'  -- Welles goes to the kitchen sink, turns on the water, starts scrubbing his bloody hands, using dishwashing liquid, scrubbing his hands desperately under running water

The female   behind the counter types in her , stamps his ticket

Thirty- fifteen, Thirty Fifth Street
Where
Astoria, Queens
Welles is scribbling all this down in his notepad
-- relatively quiet residential street
are small, two story affairs, close together, each very much like its neighbor, some with tiny yards fenced in by brick walls
Welles' Ford comes slowly down the street
in school uniforms are heading off for the day in groups
Welles parallel parks
Welles turns off the engine
He's watching a  on the other side of the street
The house is brick on the bottom, aluminum siding on top, quaint, with brick staircase from the front door down to a underneath, plastic   on the small lawn
Cars pass in the street
Welles watches school children pass on the near sidewalk
He slumps down a little in his seat, adjusting the rearview mirror, adjusting his side mirror, rolling up the window
Welles takes a cautionary look around, takes out his gun, pours bullets out and pockets them
He picks up a off the passenger seat and opens it
He takes out a long, thin metal , pulling off the shrink wrap packaging, feels the file with his thumb
Keeping his open gun low under the steering wheel, Welles slides the file into the barrel, scraping gently all along the gun's inner barrel
: '  -- Welles sits smoking a cigarette, watching the quaint house
He looks in his side mirror
There's a large  coming down the block with its turn signal on
Welles slumps a little lower
The car passes, slowing
The   of the quaint house begins to open
Welles watches
Can't really see the driver of the car except for the back of his head, but he's huge
It's a good bet it's Machine
Beside him in the passenger seat is a
The car pulls into the darkness of the quaint house's garage
After a moment, the   comes from the garage, walks with a cane, wears glasses
She goes to the sidewalk, checks her , finds it empty
Welles watches
The old woman goes back to the garage
She goes inside
The garage door closes behind her
: '  -- Welles still watches the house
There's a light on in one of the second floor windows, curtains closed
Welles yawns, shaking his head, trying to stay awake
At the quaint house, a light comes on in the front picture window
Looks like a living room or dining room
The old woman comes to sit at a table
Welles takes binoculars off the front seat
The old woman says something to someone we cannot see
She's at the dinner table, with a place setting in front of her
After a moment, someone joins her
It's Machine, you can tell by his bulk, by his huge forearms
The lacy curtains of the window block part of our view, so we never see his face
Welles lowers the binoculars, still watching
Through the window across the street, Machine can be seen putting a plate of food in front of the old woman
The old woman smiles up at him, says something
Machine goes to light two candles on the table with matches, then goes back to stand beside the old woman
Machine is seen from behind, bends to give the old woman a kiss on the cheek, then leaves the room
The old woman starts to eat
: '  -- Dawn light is just breaking
Welles has fallen asleep, slumped low behind the wheel, snoring lightly
Welles awakens with a start, looking around, confused
He calms, rubbing his eyes, wiping sweat from his features
The quaint house's garage door begins to rise
Welles sees this, keeps low, watching
The big car backs out into the street
The old woman's behind the wheel, wearing a hat, driving away, alone
Welles watches the car head away in the rear view mirror
Welles gets out of his car, shuts the door quietly behind him
He starts walking towards the quaint house, looks all directions, making sure no one's around
Ahead, the garage door begins to close
Welles picks up the pace, trying not to look too conspicuous
The garage door's halfway down
Welles runs towards the garage, has to dive and roll to get there, but he makes it under the door just as it closes
In   of the quaint house, an eyeball is peering out from lacy curtains, then moves away and curtains fall shut
,  -- Welles gets up, takes out his gun, brushing off
The garage is dark, full of  and
Welles moves towards the door to the house

The dank basement is small

Welles leads with his gun
He moves around the sheets, looking behind them
There's a leading upstairs
Welles starts up, treading lightly, trying not to make a sound
-- Welles slowly opens the door to the kitchen, pointing his gun
No one here
The decor is feminine, neat and tidy
It's grandma's house, and it shows, with gaudy everywhere, every shelf displaying or
Very Home Shopping Network
/  -- Welles slowly opens the swinging door, entering from the kitchen, sweeping the room with his gun
No sign of Machine
The whole house is dead quiet
He passes the dining room  where he watched the old woman eat last night

Welles eases his way over to the closet

Pulls it open, steps back, gun up
Nothing
Just clothing
-- Welles crosses, opens the door across the hall, enters
, very slowly, Machine's head rises on the stairs, in the garish wrestling mask, peering
'  -- Welles stays near the door, looks around
There's a fuzzy sky-blue  on the bed, fuzzy blue  nearby
Lots of bottles of  on the bedside table
Welles lowers his gun, takes a step back, into the hall

The tip of the horrible knife is inches away
Welles bends his knees, crouching, trying to gain distance from the blade
Machine pulls Welles gun hand lower, brings it against the swinging    built into the wall, begins twisting Welles' hand back, trying to pry the gun loose
Welles looks out the corner of his eyes to his gun
Welles turns his gun hand, slowing struggling to aim the gun towards the knife, but it's awful close to his face
The knife's shaking, less than an inch from Welles' cheek
Welles shuts his eyes and turns his head, letting out a , his gun
The bullet  Machine's knife, knocks it away
Machine recoils for a millisecond, but brings his now free hand to Welles' throat, choking him
Welles' face reddens, bleeding from bullet fragments

The gun can be   down the chute

How much forgiveness do you think have in me
Welles comes into the kitchen, stands beside Cindy, puts his hand out and clasp's Cindy's tiny hand

Welles is suddenly overwhelmed by emotion, eyes filling with tears
He tries to fight it, but can't help himself
His face contorts with sorrow and he cannot stop crying, letting out a loud  of misery
--  -- Welles' car moves to the shoulder, brakes to a sudden
'  --  -- Welles takes great deep breathes and lets them out, over and over again, wiping at his tears
He lets out a little high- pitched  from far back in his throat
Why
why
He's wracked by
' , '  -- Amy's in a chair, reading a , not far from Cindy's crib
Cindy's asleep
The   of the house is and  from far off in the house
Amy looks up momentarily, then returns to reading
can be  coming through the house, getting Amy looks up from her book
The bedroom door's open a crack
The door slowly pushes open
Welles stands there, eyes red from crying
Tom
Welles comes into the room, stands before Amy
He gets to his knees, puts his head in Amy's lap, wraps his arms around her waist
Amy holds him, worried, eyes filling with tears
have to tell you
have to tell you what happened
have to tell you everything, but we can't tell anyone else
No one else can ever know
Amy runs her fingers through his hair, bends down to rest her head on his back, holding him with her eyes closed
Welles holds tighter
You're all 've got
You're all 've ever had
(pause) You're the only one who can save me
