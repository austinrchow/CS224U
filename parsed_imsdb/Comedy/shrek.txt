Written by William Steig & Ted Elliott Once upon a time there was a lovely princess
But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss
She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon
Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed
She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss
(laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen
What a load of - (toilet flush) Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play
Shrek goes about his day
While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go after the ogre
-  ' MAN1 Think it's in there
MAN2 All right
Let's get it
MAN1 Whoa
Hold on
Do you know what that thing can do to you
MAN3 Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread
Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs
Yes, well, actually, that would be a giant
Now, ogres, oh they're much worse
They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin
No
They'll shave your liver
Squeeze the jelly from your eyes
Actually, it's quite good on toast
MAN1 Back
Back, beast
Back
warn ya
(waves the torch at Shrek
) Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch
The men shrink back away from him
Shrek roars very loudly and long and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the men are in the dark
This is the part where you run away
(The men scramble to get away
He laughs
) And stay out
(looks down and picks up a piece of paper
Reads
) "Wanted
Fairy tale creatures
"(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder
) There is a line of fairy tale creatures
The head of the guard sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures to him
There are cages all around
Some of the people in line are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three little pigs
All right
This one's full
Take it away
Move it along
Come on
Get up
Next
(taking the witch's broom) Give me that
Your flying days are over
(breaks the broom in half) That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch
Next
Get up
Come on
Twenty pieces
(crying) This cage is too small
Please, don't turn me in
'll never be stubborn again
can change
Please
Give me another chance
Oh, shut up
(jerks his rope) Oh
Next
What have you got
This little wooden puppet
'm not a puppet
'm a real boy
(his nose grows) Five shillings for the possessed toy
Take it away
Father, please
Don't let them do this
Help me
Gipetto takes the money and walks off
The old woman steps up to the table
Next
What have you got
Well, 've got a talking donkey
Right
Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it
Oh, go ahead, little fella
Donkey just looks up at her
Well
Oh, oh, he's just
he's just a little nervous
He's really quite a chatterbox
Talk, you boneheaded dolt
That's it
've heard enough
Guards
No, no, he talks
He does
(pretends to be Donkey)  can talk
love to talk
'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw
Get her out of my sight
No, no
swear
Oh
He can talk
The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them
One of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head
He gets sprinkled with fairy dust and he's able to fly
Hey
can fly
He can fly
3 He can fly
He can talk
Ha, ha
That's right, fool
Now 'm a flying, talking donkey
You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but  bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly
Ha, ha
(the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh
(he begins to sink to the ground
) He hits the ground with a thud
Seize him
(Donkey takes of running
) After him
He's getting away
Get him
This way
Turn
Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek
Literally
Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him
Donkey looks scared for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path
He quickly hides behind Shrek
You there
Ogre
Aye
By the order of Lord Farquaad  am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility
Oh, really
You and what army
He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well and we see that the other men have run off
The guard tucks tail and runs off
Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and begins walking back to his cottage
Can  say something to you
Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here
Incredible
Are you talkin' to
(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me
(he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him
) Whoa
Yes
was talkin' to you
Can  tell you that you that you was great back here
Those guards
They thought they was all of that
Then you showed up, and bam
They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods
That really made me feel good to see that
Oh, that's great
Really
Man, it's good to be free
Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends
Hmm
But, uh,  don't have any friends
And 'm not goin' out there by myself
Hey, wait a minute
got a great idea
'll stick with you
You're mean, green, fightin' machine
Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us
Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very loudly
Oh, wow
That was really scary
If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks
You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time
(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand
)
then  ate some rotten berries
had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day
Why are you following me
'll tell you why
(singing) 'Cause 'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith
Stop singing
It's no wonder you don't have any friends
Wow
Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest
Listen, little donkey
Take a look at me
What am
(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh
really tall
No
'm an ogre
You know
"Grab your torch and pitchforks
" Doesn't that bother you
Nope
Really
Really, really
Oh
Man,  like you
What's you name
Uh, Shrek
Shrek
Well, you know what  like about you, Shrek
You got that kind of -don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing
like that
respect that, Shrek
You all right
(They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage
) Whoa
Look at that
Who'd want to live in place like that
That would be my home
Oh
And it is lovely
Just beautiful
You know you are quite a decorator
It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget
like that boulder
That is a nice boulder
guess you don't entertain much, do you
like my privacy
You know,  do too
That's another thing we have in common
Like  hate it when you got somebody in your face
You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave
There's that awkward silence
(awkward silence) Can  stay with you
Uh, what
Can  stay with you, please
(sarcastically) Of course
Really
No
Please
don't wanna go back there
You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak
(pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do
But that's why we gotta stick together
You gotta let me stay
Please
Please
Okay
Okay
But one night only
Ah
Thank you
(he runs inside the cottage) What are you
(Donkey hops up onto a chair
) No
No
This is gonna be fun
We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' 'm makin' waffles
Oh
Where do, uh,  sleep
(irritated) Outside
Oh, well,  guess that's cool
mean, don't know you, and you don't know me, so  guess outside is best, you know
Here  go
Good night
(Shrek slams the door
) (sigh)  mean,  do like the outdoors
'm a donkey
was born outside
'll just be sitting by myself outside,  guess, you know
By myself, outside
'm all alone
there's no one here beside me
'  - Shrek is getting ready for dinner
He sits himself down and lights a candle made out of earwax
He begins to eat when he hears a noise
He stands up with a huff
(to Donkey)  thought  told you to stay outside
(from the window)  am outside
There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that made the noise
He sees several shadows moving
He finally turns and spots 3 blind mice on his table
MOUSE1 Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have
MOUSE2 It's not home, but it'll do just fine
(bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed
Got ya
(Grabs a mouse, but it escapes and lands on his shoulder
) found some cheese
(bites Shrek's ear) Ow
Blah
Awful stuff
MOUSE1 Is that you, Gordo
How did you know
Enough
(he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house
(He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice
) Hey
(he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table
) Oh, no, no, no
Dead broad off the table
Where are we supposed to put her
The bed's taken
Huh
Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain
The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed
The wolf just looks at him
What
Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging him to the front door
live in a swamp
put up signs
'm a terrifying ogre
What do  have to do get a little privacy
(He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that all the collected Fairy Tale Creatures are on his land
) Oh, no
No
No
The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land
etc
What are you doing in my swamp
(this echoes and everyone falls silent
) Gasps are heard all around
The 3 good fairies hide inside a tent
All right, get out of here
All of you, move it
Come on
Let's go
Hapaya
Hapaya
Hey
Quickly
Come on
(more dwarves run inside the house) No, no
No, no
Not there
Not there
(they shut the door on him) Oh
(turns to look at Donkey) Hey, don't look at me
didn't invite them
Oh, gosh, no one invited us
What
We were forced to come here
(flabbergasted) By who
Lord Farquaad
He huffed and he puffed and he
signed an eviction notice
(heavy sigh) All right
Who knows where this Farquaad guy is
Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers
Oh,  do
know where he is
Does anyone else know where to find him
Anyone at all
Me
Me
Anyone
Oh
Oh, pick me
Oh,  know
know
Me, me
(sigh) Okay, fine
Attention, all fairy tale things
Do not get comfortable
Your welcome is officially worn out
In fact, 'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from
(Pause
Then the crowd goes wild
) Oh
(to Donkey) You
You're comin' with me
All right, that's what  like to hear, man
Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure
love it
(singing) On the road again
Sing it with me, Shrek
can't wait to get on the road again
What did  say about singing
Can  whistle
No
Can  hum it
All right, hum it
Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'
- masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man
He's continually dunking him in a glass of milk
Lord Farquaad walks in
That's enough
He's ready to talk
The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down onto a cookie sheet
Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the table
However when he reaches the table we see that it goes up to his eyes
He clears his throat and the table is lowered
(he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can
You can't catch me
'm the gingerbread man
You are a monster
'm not the monster here
You are
You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world
Now, tell me
Where are the others
Eat me
(He spits milk into Farquaad's eye
) 've tried to be fair to you creatures
Now my patience has reached its end
Tell me or 'll
(he makes as if to pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons) No, no, not the buttons
Not my gumdrop buttons
All right then
Who's hiding them
Okay, 'll tell you
Do you know the muffin man
The muffin man
The muffin man
Yes,  know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane
Well, she's married to the muffin man
The muffin man
The muffin man
She's married to the muffin man
The door opens and the Head Guard walks in
My lord
We found it
Then what are you waiting for
Bring it in
More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet
They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet
It is the Magic Mirror
(in awe) Ohhhh
Magic mirror
Don't tell him anything
(Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid
) No
Evening
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all
Well, technically you're not a king
Uh, Thelonius
(Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist
) You were saying
What  mean is you're not a king yet
But you can become one
All you have to do is marry a princess
Go on
(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes
And here they are
Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away
She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime
Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters
Please welcome Cinderella
(shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy
Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy
Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is
Come on
Give it up for Snow White
(shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava
But don't let that cool you off
She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain
Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona
(Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three
Two
Two
Three
Three
Two
Two
Three
Three
One
Three
Three
(holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord
Okay, okay, uh, number three
Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona
Princess Fiona
She's perfect
All have to do is just find someone who can go
But  probably should mention the little thing that happens at night
'll do it
Yes, but after sunset
Silence
will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king
Captain, assemble your finest men
We're going to have a tournament
(smiles evilly) DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking lot
The castle itself is about 40 stories high
But that's it
That's it right there
That's DuLoc
told ya 'd find it
So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle
Uh-huh
That's the place
Do you think maybe he's compensating for something
(He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke
He continues walking through the parking lot
) Hey, wait
Wait up, Shrek
Hurry, darling
We're late
Hurry
Hey, you
(The attendant, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek
) Wait a second
Look, 'm not gonna eat you
just - -  just - - (He sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows
The attendant runs into a wall and falls down
Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into DuLoc
) They look around but all is quiet
It's quiet
Too quiet
Where is everybody
Hey, look at this
Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box marked 'Information'
The music winds up and then the box doors open up
There are little wooden people inside and they begin to sing
Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your
face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place
Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture
Wow
Let's do that again
(makes ready to run over and pull the lever again) (grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No
No
No, no, no
No
They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena
Brave knights
You are the best and brightest in all the land
Today one of you shall prove himself
As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song
All right
You're going the right way for a smacked bottom
Sorry about that
That champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon
If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth
Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice  am willing to make
(cheers) Let the tournament begin
(He notices Shrek) Oh
What is that
It's hideous
(turns to look at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice
It's just a donkey
Indeed
Knights, new plan
The one who kills the ogre will be named champion
Have it him
Get him
Oh, hey
Now come on
Hang on now
(bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer) Go ahead
Get him
(holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint
Kill the beast
No
All right then
(drinks the beer) Come on
He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel of beer behind him
The beer comes rushing out drenching the other men and wetting the ground
It's like mud now
Shrek slides past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped
As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger beer barrels
It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll
Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud
There is so much fighting going on here 'm not going to go into detail
Suffice to say that Shrek kicks butt
Hey, Shrek, tag me
Tag me
Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys
Shrek gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd
Yeah
man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time and sees him
The chair
Give him the chair
Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back
Finally all the men are down
Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding sounds the end of the match
The audience goes wild
Oh, yeah
Ah
Ah
Thank you
Thank you very much
'm here till Thursday
Try the veal
Ha, ha
(laughs) The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on Shrek
Shall  give the order, sir
No,  have a better idea
People of DuLoc,  give you our champion
What
Congratulations, ogre
You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest
Quest
'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back
Your swamp
Yeah, my swamp
Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures
Indeed
All right, ogre
'll make you a deal
Go on this quest for me, and 'll give you your swamp back
Exactly the way it was
Down to the last slime-covered toadstool
And the squatters
As good as gone
What kind of quest
Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field heading away from DuLoc
Shrek is munching on an onion
Let me get this straight
You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place
Is that about right
You know, maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk
don't get it
Why don't you just pull some of that ogre stuff on him
Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make your bread, the whole ogre trip
Oh,  know what
Maybe  could have decapitated an entire village and put their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids
Does that sound good to you
Uh, no, not really, no
For your information, there's a lot more to ogres than people think
Example
Example
Okay, um, ogres are like onions
(he holds out his onion) (sniffs the onion) They stink
Yes - - No
They make you cry
No
You leave them in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little white hairs
No
Layers
Onions have layers
Ogres have layers
Onions have layers
You get it
We both have layers
(he heaves a sigh and then walks off) (trailing after Shrek) Oh, you both have layers
Oh
{Sniffs} You know, not everybody likes onions
Cake
Everybody loves cakes
Cakes have layers
don't care
what everyone likes
Ogres are not like cakes
You know what else everybody likes
Parfaits
Have you ever met a person, you say, "Let's get some parfait," they say, "Hell no,  don't like no parfait"
Parfaits are delicious
No
You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden
Ogres are like onions
And of story
Bye-bye
See ya later
Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet
You know,  think  preferred your humming
Do you have a tissue or something
'm making a mess
Just the word parfait make me start slobbering
They head off
There is a montage of their journey
Walking through a field at sunset
Sleeping beneath a bright moon
Shrek trying to put the campfire out the next day and having a bit of a problem, so Donkey pees on the fire to put it out
' Shrek and Donkey are walking up to the keep that's supposed to house Princess Fiona
It appears to look like a giant volcano
(sniffs) Ohh
Shrek
Did you do that
You gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off
My mouth was open and everything
Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead
(sniffs) It's brimstone
We must be getting close
Yeah, right, brimstone
Don't be talking about it's the brimstone
know what smell
It wasn't no brimstone
It didn't come off no stone neither
They climb up the side of the volcano/keep and look down
There is a small piece of rock right in the center and that is where the castle is
It is surrounded by boiling lava
It looks very foreboding
Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location
(laughs
then the laugh turns into a groan) Uh, Shrek
Uh, remember when you said ogres have layers
Oh, aye
Well,  have a bit of a confession to make
Donkeys don't have layers
We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves
Wait a second
Donkeys don't have sleeves
You know what  mean
You can't tell me you're afraid of heights
No, 'm just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over a boiling like of lava
Come on, Donkey
'm right here beside ya, okay
For emotional support
, we'll just tackle this thing together one little baby step at a time
Really
Really, really
Okay, that makes me feel so much better
Just keep moving
And don't look down
Okay, don't look down
Don't look down
Don't look down
Keep on moving
Don't look down
(he steps through a rotting board and ends up looking straight down into the lava) Shrek
'm lookin' down
Oh, God,  can't do this
Just let me off, please
But you're already halfway
But  know that half is safe
Okay, fine
don't have time for this
You go back
Shrek, no
Wait
Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance then, shall me
(bounces and sways the bridge) Don't do that
Oh, 'm sorry
Do what
Oh, this
(bounces the bridge again) Yes, that
Yes
Yes, do it
Okay
(continues to bounce and sway as he backs Donkey across the bridge) No, Shrek
No
Stop it
You said do it
'm doin' it
'm gonna die
'm gonna die
Shrek, 'm gonna die
(steps onto solid ground) Oh
That'll do, Donkey
That'll do
(walks towards the castle) Cool
So where is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway
Inside, waiting for us to rescue her
(chuckles) was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek
You afraid
No
But
Shh
Oh, good
Me neither
(sees a skeleton and gasps) 'Cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid
Fear's a sensible response to an unfamiliar situation
Unfamiliar dangerous situation,  might add
With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and breathes fire, it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little scared
sure as heck ain't no coward
know that
Donkey, two things, okay
Shut
up
Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs
Stairs
thought we was lookin' for the princess
(putting on a helmet) The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower
What makes you think she'll be there
read it in a book once
(walks off) Cool
You handle the dragon
'll handle the stairs
'll find those stairs
'll whip their butt too
Those stairs won't know which way they're goin'
(walks off) Donkey is still talking to himself as he looks around the room
'm gonna take drastic steps
Kick it to the curb
Don't mess with me
'm the stair master
've mastered the stairs
wish  had a step right here
'd step all over it
Shrek spots a light in the tallest tower window
Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where's the
(os) Dragon
Donkey gasps and takes off running as the dragon roars again
Shrek manages to grab Donkey out of the way just as the dragon breathes fire
Donkey, look out
(he manages to get a hold of the dragons tail and holds on) Got ya
The dragon gets irritated at this and flicks it's tail and Shrek goes flying through the air and crashes through the roof of the tallest tower
Fiona wakes up with a jerk and looks at him lying on the floor
Oh
Aah
Aah
Donkey get cornered as the Dragon knocks away all but a small part of the bridge he's on
No
Oh, no, No
(the dragon roars) Oh, what large teeth you have
(the dragon growls)  mean white, sparkling teeth
know you probably hear this all time from your food, but you must bleach, 'cause that is one dazzling smile you got there
Do  detect a hint of minty freshness
And you know what else
You're - - You're a girl dragon
Oh, sure
mean, of course you're a girl dragon
You're just reeking of feminine beauty
(the dragon begins fluttering her eyes at him) What's the matter with you
You got something in your eye
Ohh
Oh
Oh
Man, 'd really love to stay, but you know, 'm, uh
(the dragon blows a smoke ring in the shape of a heart right at him, and he coughs) 'm an asthmatic, and  don't know if it'd work out if you're gonna blow smoke rings
Shrek
(the dragon picks him up with her teeth and carries him off) No
Shrek
Shrek
Shrek
' Shrek groans as he gets up off the floor
His back is to Fiona so she straightens her dress and lays back down on the bed
She then quickly reaches over and gets the bouquet of flowers off the side table
She then lays back down and appears to be asleep
Shrek turns and goes over to her
He looks down at Fiona for a moment and she puckers her lips
Shrek takes her by the shoulders and shakes her away
Oh
Oh
Wake up
What
Are you Princess Fiona
am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me
Oh, that's nice
Now let's go
But wait, Sir Knight
This be-ith our first meeting
Should it not be a wonderful, romantic moment
Yeah, sorry, lady
There's no time
Hey, wait
What are you doing
You should sweep me off my feet out yonder window and down a rope onto your valiant steed
You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you
(smiles) Mm-hmm
Shrek breaks the lock on her door and pulls her out and down the hallway
But we have to savor this moment
You could recite an epic poem for me ballad
sonnet
limerick
Or something
don't think so
Can  at least know the name of my champion
Uh, Shrek
Sir Shrek
(clears throat and holds out a handkerchief)  pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude
Thanks
Suddenly they hear the dragon roar
(surprised)You didn't slay the dragon
It's on my to-do list
Now come on
(takes off running and drags Fiona behind him
) But this isn't right
You were meant to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying
That's what all the other knights did
Yeah, right before they burst into flame
That's not the point
(Shrek suddenly stops and she runs into him
) Oh
(Shrek ignores her and heads for a wooden door off to the side
) Wait
Where are you going
The exit's over there
Well,  have to save my ass
What kind of knight are you
One of a kind
(opens the door into the throne room) (os) Slow down
Slow down, baby, please
believe it's healthy to get to know someone over a long period of time
Just call me old-fashioned
(laughs worriedly) (we see him up close and from a distance as Shrek sneaks into the room)  don't want to rush into a physical relationship
'm not emotionally ready for a commitment of, uh, this - - Magnitude really is the word 'm looking for
Magnitude- - Hey, that is unwanted physical contact
Hey, what are you doing
Okay, okay
Let's just back up a little and take this one step at a time
We really should get to know each other first as friends or pen pals
'm on the road a lot, but  just love receiving cards - - 'd really love to stay, but - - Don't do that
That's my tail
That's my personal tail
You're gonna tear it off
don't give permission - - What are you gonna do with that
Hey, now
No way
No
No
No, no
No
No, no, no
No
Oh
Shrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings toward the dragon
He misses and he swings back again
He looks up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head
He pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps Donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him
Instead the dragon kisses Shreks' butt
She opens her eyes and roars
Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms a sort of collar for her
She roars again and Shrek and Donkey take off running
Very 'Matrix' style
Shrek grabs Donkey and then grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her
Hi, Princess
It talks
Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's the trick
They all start screaming as the dragon gains on them
Shrek spots a descending slide and jumps on
But unfortunately there is a crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin
His eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles off and walks lightly
Oh
Shrek gets them close to the exit and sets down Donkey and Fiona
Okay, you two, heard for the exit
'll take care of the dragon
Shrek grabs a sword and heads back toward the interior of the castle
He throws the sword down in between several overlapping chain links
The chain links are attached to the chandelier that is still around the dragons neck
(echoing) Run
They all take off running for the exit with the dragon in hot pursuit
They make it to the bridge and head across
The dragons breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn
They all hang on for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse
They are swung to the other side
As they hang upside down they look in horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to get them
But suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the dragon back and she's unable to get to them
Our gang climbs quickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a sad whimper as she watches Donkey walk away
(sliding down the 'volcano' hill) You did it
You rescued me
You're amazing
(behind her Donkey falls down the hill) You're - - You're wonderful
You're
(turns and sees Shrek fall down the hill and bump into Donkey) a little unorthodox 'll admit
But thy deed is great, and thy heart is pure
am eternally in your debt
(Donkey clears his throat
) And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed
hope you heard that
She called me a noble steed
She think 'm a steed
The battle is won
You may remove your helmet, good Sir Knight
Uh, no
Why not
have helmet hair
Please
would'st look upon the face of my rescuer
No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st
But how will you kiss me
What
(to Donkey) That wasn't in the job description
Maybe it's a perk
No, it's destiny
Oh, you must know how it goes
princess locked in a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight, and then they share true love's first kiss
Hmm
With Shrek
You think- - Wait
Wait
You think that Shrek is you true love
Well, yes
Both Donkey and Shrek burst out laughing
You think Shrek is your true love
What is so funny
Let's just say 'm not your type, okay
Fiona: Of course, you are
You're my rescuer
Now - - Now remove your helmet
Look
really don't think this is a good idea
Just take off the helmet
'm not going to
Take it off
No
Now
Okay
Easy
As you command
Your Highness
(takes off his helmet) You- - You're a- - an ogre
Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming
Well, yes, actually
Oh, no
This is all wrong
You're not supposed to be an ogre
Princess,  was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay
He is the one who wants to marry you
Then why didn't he come rescue me
Good question
You should ask him that when we get there
But  have to be rescued by my true love, not by some ogre and his- - his pet
Well, so much for noble steed
You're not making my job any easier
'm sorry, but your job is not my problem
You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly, 'll be waiting for him right here
Hey
'm no one's messenger boy, all right
(ominous) 'm a delivery boy
(he swiftly picks her up and swings her over his shoulder like she was a sack of potatoes) You wouldn't dare
Put me down
Ya comin', Donkey
'm right behind ya
Put me down, or you will suffer the consequences
This is not dignified
Put me down
little time has passed and Fiona has calmed down
She just hangs there limply while Shrek carries her
Okay, so here's another question
Say there's a woman that digs you, right, but you don't really like her that way
How do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned to a crisp and eaten
You just tell her she's not your true love
Everyone knows what happens when you find your
(Shrek drops her on the ground) Hey
The sooner we get to DuLoc the better
You're gonna love it there, Princess
It's beautiful
And what of my groom-to-be
Lord Farquaad
What's he like
Let me put it this way, Princess
Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply
(he and Donkey laugh) Shrek then proceeds to splash water onto his face to wash off the dust and grime
don't know
There are those who think little of him
(they laugh again) Fiona: Stop it
Stop it, both of you
You're just jealous you can never measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad
Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess
But 'll let you do the "measuring" when you see him tomorrow
(looks at the setting sun) Tomorrow
It'll take that long
Shouldn't we stop to make camp
No, that'll take longer
We can keep going
But there's robbers in the woods
Whoa
Time out, Shrek
Camp is starting to sound good
Hey, come on
'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this forest
need to find somewhere to camp now
Both Donkey and Shrek's ears lower as they shrink away from her
Shrek has found a cave that appears to be in good order
He shoves a stone boulder out of the way to reveal the cave
Hey
Over here
Shrek, we can do better than that don't think this is fit for a princess
No, no, it's perfect
It just needs a few homey touches
Homey touches
Like what
(he hears a tearing noise and looks over at Fiona who has torn the bark off of a tree
) door
Well, gentlemen,  bid thee good night
(goes into the cave and puts the bark door up behind her) You want me to read you a bedtime story
will
(os)  said good night
Shrek looks at Donkey for a second and then goes to move the boulder back in front of the entrance to the cave with Fiona still inside
Shrek, What are you doing
(laughs)  just- - You know - - Oh, come on
was just kidding
Shrek and Donkey are sitting around a campfire
They are staring up into the sky as Shrek points out certain star constellations to Donkey
And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields
Right
Yeah
Hey, can you tell my future from these stars
The stars don't tell the future, Donkey
They tell stories
Look, there's Bloodnut, the Flatulent
You can guess what he's famous for
know you're making this up
No, look
There he is, and there's the group of hunters running away from his stench
That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots
You know, Donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear
Hmm
Forget it
(heaves a big sigh) Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway
Our swamp
You know, when we're through rescuing the princess
We
Donkey, there's no "we"
There's no "our"
There's just me and my swamp
The first thing 'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall around my land
You cut me deep, Shrek
You cut me real deep just now
You know what  think
think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out
No, do ya think
Are you hidin' something
Never mind, Donkey
Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it
No, this is one of those drop-it and leave-it alone things
Why don't you want to talk about it
Why do you want to talk about it
Why are you blocking
'm not blocking
Oh, yes, you are
Donkey, 'm warning you
Who you trying to keep out
Everyone
Okay
(pause) Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere
(grins) At this point Fiona pulls the 'door' away from the entrance to the cave and peaks out
Neither of the guys see her
Oh
For the love of Pete
(gets up and walks over to the edge of the cliff and sits down) What's your problem
What you got against the whole world anyway
Look, 'm not the one with the problem, okay
It's the world that seems to have a problem with me
People take one look at me and go
"Aah
Help
Run
big, stupid, ugly ogre
" They judge me before they even know me
That's why 'm better off alone
You know what
When we met,  didn't think you was just a big, stupid, ugly ogre
Yeah,  know
So, uh, are there any donkeys up there
Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small and Annoying
Okay, okay,  see it now
The big shiny one, right there
That one there
Fiona puts the door back
That's the moon
Oh, okay
DuLoc - Farquaad's Bedroom The camera pans over a lot of wedding stuff
Soft music plays in the background
Farquaad is in bed, watching as the Magic Mirror shows him Princess Fiona
Again, show me again
Mirror, mirror, show her to me
Show me the princess
Hmph
The Mirror rewinds and begins to play again from the beginning
Ah
Perfect
Farquaad looks down at his bare chest and pulls the sheet up to cover himself as though Fiona could see him as he gazes sheepishly at her image in the mirror
Fiona walks out of the cave
She glances at Shrek and Donkey who are still sleeping
She wanders off into the woods and comes across a blue bird
She begins to sing
The bird sings along with her
She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles to keep up with her
Suddenly the pressure of the note is too big and the bird explodes
Fiona looks a little sheepish, but she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind
Time lapse, Fiona is now cooking the eggs for breakfast
Shrek and Donkey are still sleeping
Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona
Donkey's talking in his sleep
(quietly) Mmm, yeah, you know  like it like that
Come on, baby
said like it
Donkey, wake up
(shakes him) Huh
What
Wake up
What
(stretches and yawns) Good morning
Hm, how do you like your eggs
Oh, good morning, Princess
Fiona gets up and sets the eggs down in front of them
What's all this about
You know, we kind of got off to a bad start yesterday
wanted to make it up to you
mean, after all, you did rescue me
Uh, thanks
Donkey sniffs the eggs and licks his lips
Well, eat up
We've got a big day ahead of us
(walks off) They are once again on their way
They are walking through the forest
Shrek belches
Shrek
What
It's a compliment
Better out than in,  always say
(laughs) Well, it's no way to behave in front of a princess
Fiona belches Thanks
She's as nasty as you are
(chuckles) You know, you're not exactly what  expected
Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them
She smiles and then continues walking, singing softly
Suddenly from out of nowhere, a man swings down and swoops Fiona up into a tree
La liberte
Hey
Princess
(to Robin Hood) What are you doing
Be still, mon cherie, for  am you savior
And  am rescuing you from this green
(kisses up her arm while Fiona pulls back in disgust)
beast
Hey
That's my princess
Go find you own
Please, monster
Can't you see 'm a little busy here
(getting fed up) Look, pal,  don't know who you think you are
Oh
Of course
Oh, how rude
Please let me introduce myself
Oh, Merry Men
(laughs) Suddenly an accordion begins to play and the Merry men pop out from the bushes
They begin to sing Robin's theme song
Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo
steal from the rich and give to the needy
He takes a wee percentage, But 'm not greedy
rescue pretty damsels, man, 'm good
What a guy, Monsieur Hood
Break it down
like an honest fight and a saucy little maid
What he's basically saying is he likes to get
Paid
So
When an ogre in the bush grabs a lady by the tush
That's bad
That's bad
When a beauty's with a beast it makes me awfully mad
He's mad, he's really, really mad
'll take my blade and ram it through your heart, keep your eyes on me, boys 'cause 'm about to start
There is a grunt as Fiona swings down from the tree limb and knocks Robin Hood unconscious
Man, that was annoying
Shrek looks at her in admiration
Oh, you little- - (shoots an arrow at Fiona but she ducks out of the way) The arrow flies toward Donkey who jumps into Shrek's arms to get out of the way
The arrow proceeds to just bounce off a tree
Another fight sequence begins and Fiona gives a karate yell and then proceeds to beat the crap out of the Merry Men
There is a very interesting 'Matrix' moment here when Fiona pauses in mid-air to fix her hair
Finally all of the Merry Men are down, and Fiona begins walking away
Uh, shall we
Hold the phone
(drops Donkey and begins walking after Fiona) Oh
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hold on now
Where did that come from
What
That
Back there
That was amazing
Where did you learn that
Well
(laughs) when one lives alone, uh, one has to learn these things in case there's a
(gasps and points) there's an arrow in your butt
What
(turns and looks) Oh, would you look at that
(he goes to pull it out but flinches because it's tender) Oh, no
This is all my fault
'm so sorry
(walking up) Why
What's wrong
Shrek's hurt
Shrek's hurt
Shrek's hurt
Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die
Donkey, 'm okay
You can't do this to me, Shrek
'm too young for you to die
Keep you legs elevated
Turn your head and cough
Does anyone know the Heimlich
Donkey
Calm down
If you want to help Shrek, run into the woods and find me a blue flower with red thorns
Blue flower, red thorns
Okay, 'm on it
Blue flower, red thorns
Don't die Shrek
If you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light
& Donkey
Oh, yeah
Right
Blue flower, red thorns
(runs off) What are the flowers for
(like it's obvious) For getting rid of Donkey
Ah
Now you hold still, and 'll yank this thing out
(gives the arrow a little pull) (jumps away) Ow
Hey
Easy with the yankin'
As they continue to talk Fiona keeps going after the arrow and Shrek keeps dodging her hands
'm sorry, but it has to come out
No, it's tender
Now, hold on
What you're doing is the opposite of help
Don't move
Look, time out
Would you
(grunts as Shrek puts his hand over her face to stop her from getting at the arrow) Okay
What do you propose we do
Donkey is still looking for the special flower
Blue flower, red thorns
Blue flower, red thorns
Blue flower, red thorns
This would be so much easier if  wasn't color-blind
Blue flower, red thorns
(os) Ow
Hold on, Shrek
'm comin'
(rips a flower off a nearby bush that just happens to be a blue flower with red thorns) Ow
Not good
Okay
Okay
can nearly see the head
(Shrek grunts as she pulls) It's just about
Ow
Ohh
(he jerks and manages to fall over with Fiona on top of him) Ahem
(throwing Fiona off of him) Nothing happend
We were just, uh - - Look, if you wanted to be alone, all you had to do was ask
Okay
Oh, come on
That's the last thing on my mind
The princess here was just- - (Fiona pulls the arrow out) Ugh
(he turns to look at Fiona who holds up the arrow with a smile) Ow
Hey, what's that
(nervous chuckle) That's
is that blood
Donkey faints
Shrek walks over and picks him up as they continue on their way
There is a montage of scenes as the group heads back to DuLoc
Shrek crawling up to the top of a tree to make it fall over a small brook so that Fiona won't get wet
Shrek then gets up as Donkey is just about to cross the tree and the tree swings back into it's upright position and Donkey flies off
Shrek swatting and a bunch of flies and mosquitoes
Fiona grabs a nearby spiderweb that's on a tree branch and runs through the field swinging it around to catch the bugs
She then hands it to Shrek who begins eating like it's a treat
As he walks off she licks her fingers
Shrek catching a toad and blowing it up like a balloon and presenting it to Fiona
Fiona catching a snake, blowing it up, fashioning it into a balloon animal and presenting it to Shrek
The group arriving at a windmill that is near DuLoc
There it is, Princess
Your future awaits you
That's DuLoc
Yeah,  know
You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, which  think means he has a really
(Shrek steps on his hoof) Ow
Um, , uh- -  guess we better move on
Sure
But, Shrek
'm - - 'm worried about Donkey
What
mean, look at him
He doesn't look so good
What are you talking about
'm fine
(kneels to look him in the eyes) That's what they always say, and then next thing you know, you're on your back
(pause) Dead
You know, she's right
You look awful
Do you want to sit down
Uh, you know, 'll make you some tea
didn't want to say nothin', but got this twinge in my neck, and when turn my head like this, look, (turns his neck in a very sharp way until his head is completely sideways) Ow
See
Who's hungry
'll find us some dinner
'll get the firewood
Hey, where you goin'
Oh, man,  can't feel my toes
(looks down and yelps) don't have any toes
think  need a hug
Shrek has built a fire and is cooking the rest of dinner while Fiona eats
Mmm
This is good
This is really good
What is this
Uh, weed rat
Rotisserie style
No kidding
Well, this is delicious
Well, they're also great in stews
Now, don't mean to brag, but  make a mean weed rat stew
(chuckles) Fiona looks at DuLoc and sighs
guess 'll be dining a little differently tomorrow night
Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime
'll cook all kind of stuff for you
Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare - - you name it
(smiles) 'd like that
They smiles at each other
Um, Princess
Yes, Shrek
, um,  was wondering
are you
(sighs) Are you gonna eat that
(chuckles) Man, isn't this romantic
Just look at that sunset
(jumps up) Sunset
Oh, no
mean, it's late
-It's very late
What
Wait a minute
see what's goin' on here
You're afraid of the dark, aren't you
Yes
Yes, that's it
'm terrified
You know, 'd better go inside
Don't feel bad, Princess
used to be afraid of the dark, too, until - - Hey, no, wait
'm still afraid of the dark
Shrek sighs Good night
Good night
Fiona goes inside the windmill and closes the door
Donkey looks at Shrek with a new eye
Ohh
Now  really see what's goin' on here
Oh, what are you talkin' about
don't even wanna hear it
Look, 'm an animal, and  got instincts
And know you two were diggin' on each other
could feel it
You're crazy
'm just bringing her back to Farquaad
Oh, come on, Shrek
Wake up and smell the pheromones
Just go on in and tell her how you feel
- - There's nothing to tell
Besides, even if  did tell her that, well, you know - - and 'm not sayin'  do 'cause don't - - she's a princess, and 'm - - An ogre
Yeah
An ogre
Hey, where you goin'
To get
move firewood
(sighs) Donkey looks over at the large pile of firewood there already is
Donkey opens the door to the Windmill and walks in
Fiona is nowhere to be seen
Princess
Princess Fiona
Princess, where are you
Princess
Fiona looks at Donkey from the shadows, but we can't see her
It's very spooky in here
ain't playing no games
Suddenly Fiona falls from the railing
She gets up only she doesn't look like herself
She looks like an ogre and Donkey starts freaking out
Aah
Oh, no
No, help
Shh
Shrek
Shrek
Shrek
No, it's okay
It's okay
What did you do with the princess
Donkey, 'm the princess
Aah
It's me, in this body
Oh, my God
You ate the princess
(to her stomach) Can you hear me
Donkey
(still aimed at her stomach) Listen, keep breathing
'll get you out of there
No
Shrek
Shrek
Shrek
Shh
Shrek
This is me
Donkey looks into her eyes as she pets his muzzle, and he quiets down
Princess
What happened to you
You're, uh, uh, uh, different
'm ugly, okay
Well, yeah
Was it something you ate
'Cause  told Shrek those rats was a bad idea
You are what you eat,  said
Now - - No
- - 've been this way as long as  can remember
What do you mean
Look,  ain't never seen you like this before
It only happens when sun goes down
"By night one way, by day another
This shall be the norm
until you find true love's first kiss
and then take love's true form
" Ah, that's beautiful
didn't know you wrote poetry
It's a spell
(sigh) When  was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me
Every night  become this
This horrible, ugly beast
was placed in a tower to await the day my true love would rescue me
That's why  have to marry Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets and he sees me like this
(begins to cry) All right, all right
Calm down
Look, it's not that bad
You're not that ugly
Well,  ain't gonna lie
You are ugly
But you only look like this at night
Shrek's ugly 24-7
But Donkey, 'm a princess, and this is not how a princess is meant to look
Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry Farquaad
have to
Only my true love's kiss can break the spell
But, you know, um, you're kind of an orge, and Shrek - - well, you got a lot in common
Shrek
Shrek is walking towards the windmill with a sunflower in his hand
(to himself) Princess,  - - Uh, how's it going, first of all
Good
Um, good for me too
'm okay
saw this flower and thought of you because it's pretty and - - well,  don't really like it, but  thought you might like it 'cause you're pretty
But  like you anyway
'd - - uh, uh
(sighs) 'm in trouble
Okay, here we go
He walks up to the door and pauses outside when he hears Donkey and Fiona talking
(os)  can't just marry whoever  want
Take a good look at me, Donkey
mean, really, who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly
"Princess" and "ugly" don't go together
That's why  can't stay here with Shrek
Shrek steps back in shock
(os) My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love
Shrek heaves a deep sigh
He throws the flower down and walks away
Don't you see, Donkey
That's just how it has to be
It's the only way to break the spell
You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth
No
You can't breathe a word
No one must ever know
What's the point of being able to talk if you gotta keep secrets
Promise you won't tell
Promise
All right, all right
won't tell him
But you should
(goes outside)  just know before this is over, 'm gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy
Look at my eye twitchin'
Fiona comes out the door and watches him walk away
She looks down and spots the sunflower
She picks it up before going back inside the windmill
Donkey is asleep
Shrek is nowhere to be seen
Fiona is still awake
She is plucking petals from the sunflower
tell him,  tell him not
tell him, tell him not
tell him
(she quickly runs to the door and goes outside) Shrek
Shrek, there's something  want
(she looks and sees the rising sun, and as the sun crests the sky she turns back into a human
) Just as she looks back at the sun she sees Shrek stomping towards her
Shrek
Are you all right
Perfect
Never been better
- -  don't - - There's something have to tell you
You don't have to tell me anything, Princess
heard enough last night
You heard what  said
Every word
thought you'd understand
Oh,  understand
Like you said, "Who could love a hideous, ugly beast
" But  thought that wouldn't matter to you
Yeah
Well, it does
(Fiona looks at him in shock
He looks past her and spots a group approaching
) Ah, right on time
Princess, 've brought you a little something
Farquaad has arrived with a group of his men
He looks very regal sitting up on his horse
You would never guess that he's only like 3 feet tall
Donkey wakes up with a yawn as the soldiers march by
What'd  miss
What'd  miss
(spots the soldiers) (muffled) Who said that
Couldn't have been the donkey
Princess Fiona
As promised
Now hand it over
Very well, ogre
(holds out a piece of paper) The deed to your swamp, cleared out, as agreed
Take it and go before change my mind
(Shrek takes the paper) Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, for  have never seen such a radiant beauty before
'm Lord Farquaad
Lord Farquaad
Oh, no, no
(Farquaad snaps his fingers) Forgive me, my lord, for  was just saying a short
(Watches as Farquaad is lifted off his horse and set down in front of her
He comes to her waist
) farewell
Oh, that is so sweet
You don't have to waste good manners on the ogre
It's not like it has feelings
No, you're right
It doesn't
Donkey watches this exchange with a curious look on his face
Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless Fiona
ask your hand in marriage
Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom
Lord Farquaad,  accept
Nothing would make - - (interrupting) Excellent
'll start the plans, for tomorrow we wed
No
mean, uh, why wait
Let's get married today before the sun sets
Oh, anxious, are you
You're right
The sooner, the better
There's so much to do
There's the caterer, the cake, the band, the guest list
Captain, round up some guests
(a guard puts Fiona on the back of his horse) Fare-thee-well, ogre
Farquaad's whole party begins to head back to DuLoc
Donkey watches them go
Shrek, what are you doing
You're letting her get away
Yeah
So what
Shrek, there's something about her you don't know
Look,  talked to her last night, She's - - know you talked to her last night
You're great pals, aren't ya
Now, if you two are such good friends, why don't you follow her home
Shrek,  - -  wanna go with you
told you, didn't
You're not coming home with me
live alone
My swamp
Me
Nobody else
Understand
Nobody
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys
But  thought - - Yeah
You know what
You thought wrong
(stomps off) Shrek
Montage of different scenes
Shrek arriving back home
Fiona being fitted for the wedding dress
Donkey at a stream running into the dragon
Shrek cleaning up his house
Fiona eating dinner alone
Shrek eating dinner alone
' Shrek is eating dinner when he hears a sound outside
He goes outside to investigate
Donkey
(Donkey ignores him and continues with what he's doing
) What are you doing
would think, of all people, you would recognize a wall when you see one
Well, yeah
But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not through it
It is around your half
See that's your half, and this is my half
Oh
Your half
Hmm
Yes, my half
helped rescue the princess
did half the work
get half the booty
Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head
Back off
No, you back off
This is my swamp
Our swamp
(grabs the tree branch Donkey is working with) Let go, Donkey
You let go
Stubborn jackass
Smelly ogre
Fine
(drops the tree branch and walks away) Hey, hey, come back here
'm not through with you yet
Well, 'm through with you
Uh-uh
You know, with you it's always, "Me, me, me
" Well, guess what
Now it's my turn
So you just shut up and pay attention
You are mean to me
You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that  do
You're always pushing me around or pushing me away
Oh, yeah
Well, if  treated you so bad, how come you came back
Because that's what friends do
They forgive each other
Oh, yeah
You're right, Donkey
forgive you
for stabbin' me in the back
(goes into the outhouse and slams the door) Ohh
You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of your own feelings
(os) Go away
There you are , doing it again just like you did to Fiona
All she ever do was like you, maybe even love you
(os) Love me
She said  was ugly, a hideous creature
heard the two of you talking
She wasn't talkin' about you
She was talkin' about, uh, somebody else
(opens the door and comes out) She wasn't talking about me
Well, then who was she talking about
Uh-uh, no way
ain't saying anything
You don't wanna listen to me
Right
Right
Donkey
No
Okay, look
'm sorry, all right
(sigh) 'm sorry
guess  am just a big, stupid, ugly ogre
Can you forgive me
Hey, that's what friends are for, right
Right
Friends
Friends
So, um, what did Fiona say about me
What are you asking me for
Why don't you just go ask her
The wedding
We'll never make it in time
Ha-ha-ha
Never fear, for where, there's a will, there's a way and  have a way
(whistles) Suddenly the dragon arrives overhead and flies low enough so they can climb on
Donkey
guess it's just my animal magnetism
They both laugh
Aw, come here, you
(gives Donkey a noogie) All right, all right
Don't get all slobbery
No one likes a kiss ass
All right, hop on and hold on tight
haven't had a chance to install the seat belts yet
They climb aboard the dragon and she takes off for DuLoc
- Fiona and Farquaad are getting married
The whole town is there
The prompter card guy holds up a card that says 'Revered Silence'
People of DuLoc, we gather here today to bear witness to the union
(eyeing the setting sun) Um- of our new king
Excuse me
Could we just skip ahead to the " do's"
(chuckles and then motions to the priest to indulge Fiona) Go on
Some guards are milling around
Suddenly the dragon lands with a boom
The guards all take off running
(to Dragon) Go ahead,
If we need you, 'll whistle
How about that
(she nods and goes after the guards) Shrek, wait, wait
Wait a minute
You wanna do this right, don't you
(at the Church door) What are you talking about
There's a line you gotta wait for
The preacher's gonna say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace
" That's when you say, " object
" don't have time for this
Hey, wait
What are you doing
Listen to me
Look, you love this woman, don't you
Yes
You wanna hold her
Yes
Please her
Yes
(singing James Brown style) Then you got to, got to try a little tenderness
(normal) The chicks love that romantic crap
All right
Cut it out
When does this guy say the line
We gotta check it out
As the priest talks we see Donkey's shadow through one of the windows Shrek tosses him up so he can see
And so, by the power vested in me
Outside What do you see
The whole town's in there
Inside now pronounce you husband and wife
Outside They're at the altar
Inside king and queen
Outside Mother Fletcher
He already said it
Oh, for the love of Pete
He runs inside without catching Donkey, who hits the ground hard
(running toward the alter)  object
Shrek
The whole congregation gasps as they see Shrek
Oh, now what does he want
(to congregation as he reaches the front of the Church) Hi, everyone
Havin' a good time, are ya
love DuLoc, first of all
Very clean
What are you doing here
Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one wants you, but showing up uninvited to a wedding
Fiona
need to talk to you
Oh, now you wanna talk
It's a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me - - But you can't marry him
And why not
Because- - Because he's just marring you so he can be king
Outrageous
Fiona, don't listen to him
He's not your true love
And what do you know about true love
Well,  - - Uh - -  mean - - Oh, this is precious
The ogee has fallen in love with the princess
Oh, good Lord
(laughs) The prompter card guy holds up a card that says 'Laugh'
The whole congregation laughs
An ogre and a princess
Shrek, is this true
Who cares
It's preposterous
Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away from our "happily ever after
" Now kiss me
(puckers his lips and leans toward her, but she pulls back
) (looking at the setting sun) "By night one way, by day another
" (to Shrek) wanted to show you before
She backs up and as the sun sets she changes into her ogre self
She gives Shrek a sheepish smile
Well, uh, that explains a lot
(Fiona smiles) Ugh
It's disgusting
Guards
Guards
order you to get that out of my sight now
Get them
Get them both
The guards run in and separate Fiona and Shrek
Shrek fights them
No, no
Shrek
This hocus-pocus alters nothing
This marriage is binding, and that makes me king
See
See
No, let go of me
Shrek
No
Don't just stand there, you morons
Get out of my way
Fiona
Arrgh
'll make you regret the day we met
'll see you drawn and quartered
You'll beg for death to save you
No, Shrek
(hold a dagger to Fiona's throat) And as for you, my wife
Fiona
'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days
'm king
Shrek manages to get a hand free and he whistles
will have order
will have perfection
will have - - (Donkey and the dragon show up and the dragon leans down and eats Farquaad) Aaaah
Aah
All right
Nobody move
got a dragon here, and 'm not afraid to use it
(The dragon roars
) 'm a donkey on the edge
The dragon belches and Farquaad's crown flies out of her mouth and falls to the ground
Celebrity marriages
They never last, do they
The congregation cheers
Go ahead, Shrek
Uh, Fiona
Yes, Shrek
- -  love you
Really
Really, really
(smiles)  love you too
Shrek and Fiona kiss
Thelonius takes one of the cards and writes 'Awwww' on the back and then shows it to the congregation
Aawww
Suddenly the magic of the spell pulls Fiona away
She's lifted up into the air and she hovers there while the magic works around her
"Until you find true love's first kiss and then take love's true form
Take love's true form
Take love's true form
" Suddenly Fiona's eyes open wide
She's consumed by the spell and then is slowly lowered to the ground
(going over to her) Fiona
Fiona
Are you all right
(standing up, she's still an ogre) Well, yes
But  don't understand
'm supposed to be beautiful
But you  beautiful
They smile at each other
(chuckles)  was hoping this would be a happy ending
Shrek and Fiona kiss
and the kiss fades into
their wedding kiss
Shrek and Fiona are now married
''m a Believer' by Smashmouth is played in the background
Shrek and Fiona break apart and run through the crowd to their awaiting carriage
Which is made of a giant onion
Fiona tosses her bouquet which both Cinderella and Snow White try to catch
But they end up getting into a cat fight and so the dragon catches the bouquet instead
The Gingerbread man has been mended somewhat and now has one leg and walks with a candy cane cane
Shrek and Fiona walk off as the rest of the guests party and Donkey takes over singing the song
God bless us, every one
(as he's done singing and we fade to black) Oh, that's funny
Oh
Oh
can't breathe
can't breathe
