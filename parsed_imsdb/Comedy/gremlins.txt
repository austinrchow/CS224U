An American businessman
1-He wears a tas eful g3,y suit
He's thin, with distinguished good looks and thin brown hair
He's 56 years old
Rand looks around; fascinated by the vast array of people and merchandise
He stops at a booth

Rand gives her a polite smile

He is very old
Deep wrinkles
Long white hair
Ragged clothes

Overhearing Rand, the man stops to eavesdrop
(explaining to Oriental woman) 'm looking for a present
for my son
The woman nods
She searches through her wares
She holds up a basketball
Rand shakes his head
He's not really involved in sports
The woman puts away the basketball
She picks up a Sony "Walkman"
Rand again shakes his head
, No

reaches out and grabs Rand's arm
Startled, he turns
The Oriental man stands before him
He stares into Rand's eyes

He leads Rand away from the booth
offer something very different
Very unusual
Rand is puzzled
The Oriental leads him to a doorway
Follow me
He opens the door, motioning for Rand to follow
Rand pauses, skeptical
Come
Take a look
It will cost you nothing
(a beat) You won't be disappointed
The Oriental enters
Rand shrugs and follows
Rand follows the man up a narrow, dark set of stairs
At the top, they enter a room
Dark
No windows
No furniture
Filled with cardboard boxes and wooden crates
Rand crinkles his nose
It su,Qlls bad in here
The Oriental flips on a dim light bulb
He leads the nervous, apprehensive Rand to a dark corner of the room
The Oriental picks up a small, metal box echoes from inside the box

Rand is very puzzled
The Oriental rests the box on a stack of crates
He opens the box
is inside'
The animal is eleven inches tall and stands; upright on two legs
It has two arms, with small; four-fingered hands
Its body is covered with fluffy brown fur
The piercing eyes are big, sad
Its ears are long and pointed
tiny black nose sits above a wide mouth, with small, square teeth
The creature is smiling
It lets out a giggle
Rand is delighted and surprised
He's never seen anything like this
The animal is more charming than a Disney character
The Oriental claps his hands
The creature leaps from the box, onto Rand's shoulder
The animal licks Rand's cheek
' He laughs, amused by the creature
The Oriental claps his hands again
The creature hops back into the box
It stares at Rand with those cute green eyes'
(to the Oriental) What is it
It is called ' Mogwai '
(a beat) very rare and intelligent animal
found it in the fields near my home It will obey all orders
It learns fast
The Oriental looks at Mogwai and claps his hands
(Chinese,; English ) --Mogwai leaps to the ground
It scurries across the floor, to a wooden crate
Mogwai removes a raw tuna from the crate
It tears off a chunk of the fish and carries it to the oriental man
He takes the fish
Mogwai hops back into the box
Rand shakes his head
Amazed by the animal
he Oriental takes a bit from the raw fish
Juice runs own his chin
He smiles at Rand
And if you are ever in need of a song
He claps his hands to the creature
(Chinese; English ) Music
Mogwai begins to hum, in an unearthly falsetto
It's beautiful
Rand watches with wide eyes
He feels like a child again
- How much
One hundred American Dollars
Cash
Rand removes five twenties from his wallet
He gives them to the man
The Oriental smiles and claps his hands
Mogwai jumps onto Rand's shoulders
Rand pets it
Mogwai emits a cute giggle
It never sleeps
It will eat any- thing
but prefers raw meat
() It must always be kept indoors during the day
It lives in shadow
It hates bright light
Direct sunlight will kill it
Rand nods
He takes Mogwai from his shoulder and puts it into the box
Rand puts the box under his arm
The Oriental smiles Your son will enjoy his new friend
Rand smiles and exits
The Oriental takes a bite from his raw fish
:
Rand is on the pay telephon His baggage rests beside him
Mogwai is inside of a small plastic pet box
The creature's bright eyes shine from inside
(into the phone) Yes, Fred
The Tai-Chan account is definite
MmmHmm
My plane l eaves in twenty minutes
See you in Pennsylvania
He hangs up
He picks up his bags and walks to the check- in counter
- tags Mogwai's box and puts it on the conveyer belt
Rand watches the box disappear through the baggage chute
- Don't worry, sir
Your pet will be safe
Rand smiles

But he thinks of me as a lot more
So there's a possibility

They both laugh
Standing across the street, looking into the coffee shop window

they'll go to it
(a beat) Als , unless)th y're hunting for foo or water
they hate to be separated
t ied to move one from the others
They cried out
Clawing
Screeching
Yeah
that's what happened when tried to take one
If one is separated
The others will follow
Anything else
They qan't multiply by water if their environment temperature is below '25 degrees- (a beat) It's amazing
They have no bio- logical link with any other species of animal
in the whole world
Billy gives an uncertain nod

He takes the sword from the wall
He walks out of the

Sword in hand
The noises get louder

Nervous, Billy descends the dark stairs
He arrives at the bottom
He stops to listen
The sounds are coming from the living room
Billy enters
He looks to the floor
Beneath the'Christmas tree
The creatures surround Barney
They have killed the dog
Billy tries to move
He's frozen
The creatures are eating the dog
They look up at Billy
Their bright green eyes are fiery
Blood covers their mouths
They smile
They giggle
Billy screams
: - The bag moves
Squirms
Shakes
The creatures are inside
Rand carries the bag up a ladder that leads into the attic
36 Lynn and Billy stand a few feet away, in the hallway
Rand lets the creatures loose in the attic
He quickly latches the attic's trap door, securing it with a padlock
He climbs down the ladder
This should keep them out for the rest of the niht
Dark
The Mogwai cluster around the trap door
They scratch at the door
They want out
(0
) Tomorrow we'll take them out in the sun
and
finish them off
Lynn nods
Rand looks at Billy
'm sorry, son

Forget it
Billy stares coldly at his Father
Embarrassed, Rand looks away
We should all get back to sleep
Rand puts his arm around Lynn
They walk to their bed- room
Billy looks up at the attic door
The creatures' scratching is heard
: 37 - The sun rises behind the house
Snow is falling
The tr p door opens
Billy and Rand climb inside
They both carry flashlights
They s ine the lights through the attic, looking for the creatu es
They see nothing
Billy spots something
He nudges his Father
There are   , stuck to various places-on the floor
The pods are 16 inches long, 12 inches in dia- meter
They are wrapped with a vein-like wire and covered with a thick, syrupy glaze
What in the hell
Billy picks up a broomstick andl pokes one of the things
Won't budge
Hard as a rock
Damn things are stuck to the floor
Rand picks up a baseball bat
He raises it over his head and swings down, hard
Against the pod
The bat snaps in two
The pod is unblemished
Rand rubs his stinging hands
Billy and Rand just look at each other
Puzzled

Lynn pours them coffee
Roy has just examined the pods

1ND Like a butterfly
Exactly
Those things in the attic-are cocoons
Inside,
the creatures are going through some sort of change
a metamorphosis
Why did they attack my dog
Simple
They're animals
They were hungry
Aside from water, food is their main concern
How long until they hatch
week
a month
really can't say
() 'm not waiting around to find out
Billy, don't be hasty
You've stumbled onto a new life form
What comes out of those cocoons could be a major scientific discovery
Screw'science
want them des- troyed
Billy
Maybe Mr
Hanson's got a point
(stern, bitter) Dad, they killed Barney
Or have you already forgotten
Rand just looks'at his son
Lynn pops a valium in the background
39
- Red hot light
The flame of a torch
He's holding the gas torch, aiming it at the cocoon
Billy stands beside him
They're inside-theattic
Rand shuts off the torch
He touches the cocoon
It appears unharmed
Not even warm
(shakes his head, ) They're indestructible
Now what do we do

They'll come in next week and cut these things out of the floor
don't think we should wait
Let's do it ourselves
No

- Lynn decorates the cookies
She adds white icing to Santa's beard
She dips her butterknife into the large blender that has made the icing
The cocoons are bubbling furiously; as if they were being baked in an oven
Suddenly, a crack appears on one
Then another
And another
Cracks begin to cover all the cocoons
Green smoke seeps from the thin openings
slow soft hiss is heard
They're hatching
: Roland stands beside Billy
Mrs
Deagle patiently waits

: standing in the kitchen
Frightened
She downs two valiums from her bottle
Lynn exits the kitchen and slowly walks upstairs
: Nervous
Sweating
Behind the wheel of his car
He tries to drive fast, but the heavy snowfall and icy roads prevent it
Outside, the sun is going down

People need help
76 Shaky
Nervous
Behind the wheel of the police car
The creatures are making their way down  in Street
They are everywhere
On rooftops
Front lawns
Smashing through windows
Breaking into homes
Scattered human screams echo through the night
People are dying

It sways
He pulls harder
The ladder tilts to the ground
Falling
The three creatures are thrown to the ground, into the deep snow
Billy and Tracy ride the ladder down
The snow breaks their fall
The creatures dig their way out of the snow
They move towards Billy and Tracy
Billy snaps up his sword and jumps to his feet
Ready to fight
He keeps one protective arm around Tracy
The creatures surround them
Waiting for the right moment to attack
One of the creatures moves forward
Another leaps behind Billy
Billy lunges forward and spears the first creature
He quickly reels around, slicing the other creature in two
Both creatures lie in the snow
Dead
Billy turns to the last Mogwai
With two swings of his blade, he kills the creature
Billy wipes the green blood off his sword with his coat sleeve
Breathless, he looks at Tracy
Hair
hangs in his eyes
Blood runs down the side of his
sweaty, unshaven face
His dark brown eyes stare at Tracy
The transformation from meek bank clerk to sexy hero is complete
He embraces her
They run to the police car and get inside

He can see the shadows of the creatures
Crawling on houses
Running across the front lawns

leaps onto the car's passenger' side
The creature grabs Frank' arm
He tries to shake off the creature
Gary gl nce over
Shocked
Horrified
Mogwai takes a huge bite out of Frank's arm
He screams
Gary turns to help him
- slides on the ice
It slams-into a guard rail, flips over a ditch and spins to a stop
: ' Billy drives, as fast as possible through the heavy snow
He's headed out of town
Tracy sits beside him
She looks out the window
The rows of once peaceful, cheerful homes are now the scenes of frenzied horror
People run out into the night, screaming for help, only to be dragged to the ground by creatures
Ravaged bodies lie in the snow
Frozen
An ambulance is overturned on the roadside
Phone lines are town down
The creatures have made their way across town
They now attack the last few houseson the block

Tears fill her eyes
She's sickened by all of it
Billy holds Tracy's hand, comforting her

Gary puts his arm around her
Billy hops into the driver's seat
He rests the sword beside him

He needs her comfort
Billy just stares ahead, at the snowy road
: '   - Closed
But the upstairs lights are on
Someone is home
Everything here looks calm
Untouched
Safe
The police car pulls into the driveway
Billy turns to Gary and Tracy
We're just outside of town
Doesn't look like the creature's got here yet
(a beat) Let's go inside and warm up
They exit the police car

He sees the worn, hollow faces of Gary and Tracy
He sees the bruised and bloodied Billy
84
What the hell happened to you
Billy looks at Dorry
: '  - Dorry bandages Billy's calf
Gary sits with Tracy on the sofa
Billy finishes telling the full story to everyone
and they originate from this marketplace in Hong Kong
Dorrystands and shakes his head
Hard to believe
Like Satan's come to walk the earth
(looks at everyone) You see
they''re drawn to water
Now, if my hunch is correct
They'll be leaving town, and heading for the water tower-which means they'll have to pass by here tonight
(a beat) We have to get help
These things have to be kept under control
If they get to the water tower
they could spread all over the St ate
maybe the Country
They're like inhuman divining rods
Why didn't you think of that before, Peltzer
did
But nobody would listen
Maybe if you weren't such a nut people would believe you
85
Dorry intervenes
Nowt boys
arguing won't get us anywhere
Gary still glares at Billy
This is your fau t, Peltzer
That's not true
My brother's dead because of you
That isn't
The people in town
They're a dead because of you
() Stop it
You did it
You killed all those people
You're
a murderer, Peltzer
Billy lunges at Gary
They fall to the ground
Fighting
Dorry and Tracy break it up
If we want to stay
alive
We have to stick together
Billy turns away
Cooling off
Gary is comforted by Tracy
But she keeps her eye on Billy
Dorry looks at everyone
We should get in touch with the authorities
86 Yeah, and then 'd like to try and get in touch with my Dad
If we can
Total darkness
: ' Mogwai's claw tears at the wires in the electrical box
: - Gary's cigarette lighter illuminates the room
Everyone stays quiet
They listen
of several creatures echoes from outside
They're here
frightened Gary holds Tracy
Now what do we do
The giggling gets louder
Closer
Billy turns to Dorry
Do you have a place without win dows
place where we could be safe
Dorry pauses to think
The storage room The sound of breaking glass is heard
87 (clutching his sword) We have to hurry
Dorry leads everyone
out of the

Large area
Crowded wit

Frightened
Mischevious little devils, aren't they
No one disagrees
Tracy suddenly notices something
She cries out
(pointing to the ) Billy
' scratch through the thin wood of the storage room door
Thinking fast, Billy moves to a large cabinet
He turns to Gary
88
Help me with this
Gary and Billy slide the cabinet in front of the door
That'llkeep them out
We're safe now
Billy sits back
The i12oipjs contipue
Dorrylook at ever y on 've only been this scared two other times in my life
Once was when  got drafted
The other, was when  was six years old
(everyone listens) It
was Christmas Eve
My sisters and  were decorating the tree with our Mother
We were singing caroles
happy
excited
waiting for Dad to get home from work
(a beat) few hours passed, and we started to worry
Dad wasn't home yet
My Mother called the office
They said he left
() After about a week
the police gave up
My Mother was close to a nervous breakdown
The rest of us weren't eating
we couldn't sleep
Every- thing was falling apart
() It was snowing outside
The house was cold
threw some logs on the fire
--
That's when  noticed the smell
(a beat) The firemen came
They broke through the chimney top
We were all waiting, expecting them to pull out some dead cat or bird
Instead, they pulled out my Father
() He was dressed in a Santa Claus suit
He had been climbing down the chimney on Christmas Eve, his arms loaded with presents
) 89
(') He was going to surprise us
() The coroner said that he lost his footing
He slipped and broke his neck
Died instantly
His body was lodged in the narrow chimney shaft
() ,That how  found out there was no Sahta Claus
Everyone has a chilled look on their faces
Dorry just stares
Billy stands and clears his throat
Well
think you should all try and get some sleep
(a beat) 'll watch the door
Everyone agrees
Billy moves his chair in front of the door
Dorry relaxes
inhis rocking chair
Gary stretches out on the sofa, expecting Tracy to cuddle with him
Instead,"she walks:over to Billy
Billy
He looks at her
She gives him a comforting smile
just wanted to say thanks
mean
If it wasn't for you, don't know what any of us would have done
Billy smiles
is it okay if  sleep here
On the floor beside you
'd feel a lot safer
Billy nods
Tracy moves a carpet next to Billy's chair
She lies on the carpet
She closes her eyes
Gary watches from the sofa
Jealous
Dorry has fallen asleep in his chair
Billy sits
Sword on his lap
He guards the door
Sounds still echo-from downstairas,
throughout the antique store
- - The horror of it all finally hits him
His eyes fill with tears
He cries
Alone
: sleeping in his chair
His hand still holds the sword on his lap
The others are asleep
Billy's hand quivers
The sword drops to the floor
He wakes
Startled
He quickly grabs the sword
Everyone else wakes from the sound
(looking at their scared faces) Everything's okay
just dropped my sword
Gary rubs his eyes
What time is it
(checks his pocket- ) 9:15
Billy stands
He pushes the wood cabinet from the door The door is covered with scratches
Billy slowly opens it
91 The room is bathed with light, coming from a window facing the door
Everyone smiles
The light feels good
Safe
They exit-the storage room

Windows are broken
Curtains are torn
Billy, Dcrry, Gary and Tracy enter

Into the kitchen, the bedrooms, the hallways
Every room has been destroyed by the creatures
All of the antiques have been smashed or broken by the creatures
Dorry is shocked to see his store in this state
Billy walks to the front door
He tries to open it
It's jammed
He pulls hard
Finally
, it opens

covers everything
It snowed hard last night
Three feet's worth
Try

Dorry walks back inside
Gary flips on a transistor radio that has been sitting on the shelf

Dorry returns

Now
How
The nearest town is fifteen miles away

In this
You won't get far
- It's worth'a try
And-what happens when it gets dark
And you're on the road
Alone
Gary says nothing
No
We have to stick together and fight these things
At least until we can get help
Tracy folds her arms
'm cold
Gary puts his arm around her
She'd rather have Billy's
4/30/82 93
- There's a McDonald's about a block away
Okay
We 11 get something to eat
(a beat), Them we go 1 to wJork
: - The police car is parked outside
Many of the restaurant windows are broken
few deserted cars are in the parking lot
The creatures have been here
The dead body of an old man is slumped across a table
half eaten Big Mac is still in his hand
In a booth, sits a dead family: Mother, Father, boy and girl
Their food still sits-in front of them
Untouched
dead cashier girl lies on the counter
, , sit at a table in the rear of the restaurant
Away from the grisly sights
- They eat burgers and fries
Gary takes a bite of his burger and nods to Billy
Not bad, Peltzer
-didn't know you could cook
94
Could there be other people in town
Alive
It's
possible
But it's more important to get at the creatures
We've got the advantage now
It's daylight
You know where they are, Peltzer
No
But they're all gathered in one place
And the sun rose before they could make it to the water tower
So they must be holed up between here and there
The old church
(shakes his head) Too many windows
Too much light
it's got to be someplace dark
Totally dark
How about somebody's garage
Or tool shed
No
There's too many of them
They'd need a huge area
Ridge's movie house
Everyone pauses to think
It's a big place
No windows
Always dark
Pitch black
Billy nods to himself
That's the place
: 95
'   - The sun is going down

You used to work here, right
() When  was a kid
You're coming in with me

What are you going to do if they're inside
Blow up the theater
Everyone seems puzzled
Billy turns to Gary
This place has some kind of boiler room
with a furnace
right
() In the basement
(to the others) 'll use the gas lines as a bomb
The fire will destroy the creatures
Dorry looks at Billy
want to come in with you
You'11 need the extra hand
96 Well 'm not staying out here alone
It's getting dark
Billy nods
-They'll all go in together
Okay

We've got to stick together
And keep close to the flashlight
They're scared of the light
Everyone nods
Gary turns on the flashlight
Tracy takes Billy's hand
Gary is jealous
They enter the theater
Gary shines the flashlight
The candy counter has been smashed
All of the candy is gone
The popcorn machine is empty
The soda machine has been emptied and turned on its side
Billy walks to the theater entrance door
He looks into the small window
Countless pairs of green eyes shine in the darkness
The creatures murmur among themselves
Billy whispers to the others
They're inside the theater
The others peer into the window
(to Gary) How do we get to the boiler room
97
Damn
There's too many of those things
They'll- see us

The seven dwarfs are singing "Hi-Ho, Hi-Ho, it's off to work we go
" The song echoes through the theater

The light hurts their eyes
But gradually, they become interested in the movie
: The creatures are clustered in their seats
Puzzled
Fascinated by the animated screen 98 Billy and the others move through the darkness
They crawl on the floor, on the outside aisle of the theater, to the Exit door
They move carefully
Slowly
Silently
They make it to the Exit
They Crawl out

He examines the gas line
He finds the shut-of
f valve and turns off the gas
Billy takes off his coat and shirt
He removes his -shirt
He looks at Gary
Give me your -shirt
Gary reluctantly takes
off his -shirt
Billy ties the two shirts together
He winds them into a cord
He finds a connection in the gas line
He begins to pound against it with the handle of his sword
The
sounds of metal ring out
, ,
: The film's reel ends
The screen goes blank
The creatures are puzzled
Distracted
They throw their candy boxes and paper cups at the screen
The  of Billy's sword hitting the pipe is heard
Several of the creatures group together
They move from their seats, to the exit door
They follow the sound
99
Billy gives one final hit to
the gas line
The connection snaps
He stuffs the line with his and Gary's shirt

It keeps some of the Mogwai at bay
Fire creeps up the -shirt, getting closer to the gas line
Billy gets all-the creatures off Dorry
More creatures come through the door
Gary gets scared
He drops the flashlight and runs for the rear exit
