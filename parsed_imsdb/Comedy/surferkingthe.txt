-                             1 , a Jamaican looking fellow in his early 20's, arrives at Water World, carrying a dusty cardboard box
There are a few workers milling about, setting up the park for opening
He passes , a 25-something grounds worker with Down's Syndrome
Eddie
(smiling, nodding) Jaffa
They do a hand slap maneuver that they have obviously worked out some time in the past
proceeds up to the Customer Relations Kiosk, plops the box on the counter, and enters the kiosk
We see him open the box, it is full of 's
He pulls winter covers off of an overhead area to reveal a player and amplifiers
He starts pushing buttons he's pushed a thousand times, and lights come on
He pulls down a microphone, and clicks a button to see if it works
He reaches into the box of CDs and pulls one out
We see it is Sheryl Crow
He gets the , examines it, and pops it into the  player
He once again picks the microphone and flips the switch as he pushes the "play" button on the  player
His voice echoes through the park
"Soak up the Sun" begins playing
(smiling) Ladies and Gentlemen, Water World will be open in (checking his watch) twenty-six hours and forty-three minutes
- 2          -                                      2 , the park's owner/manager - a 50-something man who is portly and bald, and  , head lifeguard and another  are on the east side of Thunder Bay
There is a post with a box on top of it that has a winter cover on it
The  is standing there with a garden hose Page 2 of 81 holding it so the water goes into Thunder Bay
He is obviously tired, and has been standing there a long time
We look back at the massive size of the pool and get the joke
and  pull off the winter cover
The turns to look and the hose turns with him, getting wet
They object and he turns back to filling Thunder Bay
moves the  to a safe distance
blows the dust off of the box at the top of the post, and we see it is a large push button
looks at  who nods "go ahead" and then pushes the button
They both draw back as if something big should happen, but nothing
They look at each other and   motions for to go over to the wall housing the wave tank for the pool
waves , and   pushes the button again
When nothing happens,  whacks the side of the tank with his closed fist
Suddenly a huge wave rolls out
Nodding his approval,   checks off an item in his clipboard
3
-                             3 We see people working to open the park
The dressed in Water World uniforms is setting and arranging chairs in time to the music
They perform precision maneuvers with the chairs, as if rifles, and cross each other in a timed march to the music
4
-                            4 is standing under the Fun House structure with a clipboard
He is talking to
After talking to  ,  shakes his head affirmatively and walks off
He glances up to the two guards above, and grins
is looking at his clipboard
We see quickly the large water tank above is spilling water a bit, indicating it is full
The water tank spills over   drenching him
He stands there still, angry for a moment, then thinks better of it shaking his head and smiling, takes his pen and checks  on his wet clipboard for the fun house water tank
5
-               5 Two guards are looking down at   below
One guard begins motioning as if guiding a crane into place
The other guard has his hand poised on a large switch lever
is gesturing more emphatically now, closing his hands to indicate "almost there"
He closes his hands, and pulls the lever

-    2001                       6 We are on the road to Water World in Federal Heights, Colorado
is riding with his mother (sardonically) Yeah
This is great
love this plan
Drag me kicking and screaming from my happy home in California to some weird place in Colorado, and say hey, this'll be fun Robbie
Maybe we can go camping
Look,  know you're not happy about this
But it wasn't my idea for your father to have some kind of mid-life crisis and disappear with his secretary to Mexico with our life savings
"Administrative Assistant
" There's no such thing as a secretary anymore
Fine
Administrative Assistant
We couldn't afford to sit around waiting any longer to see if he was coming back was able to land a good job here
And now thanks to Uncle Bernie you have this job at the Water Park
(shaking his head) Grounds crew
What kind of job is that
It sound like the guy who cleans out the coffee pots
Bernie says you help keep the park clean, sweep up, that sort of thing
'm sure it won't be so bad
Besides, a lot of the kids who work at this park go to the same high school you'll be going to
You can start the school year with some ready-made friends
had friends in Oceanside
had something to do for the summer
They pass the main Water World sign
Hanging below it is a banner that says Opening Tomorrow
Hanging out at the beach surfing with your friends is not my idea of something Page 4 of 81 to do
This way you'll make some money and meet people here
You'd best get used to it
This is where we live now
We're staying
All thanks to Dad and his secretary
Administrative Assistant
Whatever
Some summer
They have arrived at the front gates of Water World, Kids are in a line leading to a check-in canopy kiosk that has a sign saying Employee Check In
Promise me you'll give it a try
please
(giving in to the inevitable) will
promise
See you later He shuts the car door and walks over to the end of the line
7
-                  7 There are about 40-50 teenagers in various default street clothes, shorts and tees mostly
Robbie takes his place in line behind an older, taller boy, , who seems to know almost everyone, and has made it his personal mission to greet them
(back still to ) and so  says 'll have the filet the lobster"
had to borrow twenty bucks from Fitzgerald just to get out of the restaurant
Two guys in front of Alex are laughing now
Further down the line however, another voice pops up
(waving to ) By the way
Where is that twenty bucks
(avoiding) Ohhh, hey Dougie
'll catch up with you later
(turning around to  as not to continue the conversation) Hey, how you doin'
Haven't seen you before
Page 5 of 81 looks in his wallet, as do we
It is empty
(nodding) 'm Robbie
Robbie Zirpollo
'm Alex
Where you workin'
believe it's with the Grounds Crew
What's the matter, can't swim
(surprised) can swim
Why
Well, you look old enough to be a guard
Almost 16
get my license in September
It's just that most of the guys on grounds are a little younger than you
Most guys your age that can swim are guards
Well,  just moved here
guess missed guard tryouts
You're a guard then
Oh, no no no
work concessions
at Aokee's Surf and Snack Shack
It's just as well
The guards are mostly stuck up anyway
The rest of us are the ones who know how to have fun
Can't swim, huh
(smiling) Nope
(listening to speaker on post above) What is that
(mimicking his perception of surfers) Surf tunes, dude
Page 6 of 81 (back to his own voice) You'll get used to it
You'll get to where you miss it
had to buy two 's just to get through the winter
They are now at the front of the line
teenage girl is sitting at the table with papers and a clipboard
(') (gesturing) Ahh
And here we have the fair Melissa, time clerk extraordinaire
(shaking her head no) Oh, Alex
Am  going to have to put up with your crap for another entire summer
(looking upward toward the sky) Dear Melissa
There's nothing about our relationship that couldn't be fixed by us spending a few moments together in the pumphouse behind Thunder Bay
Yeah, well from what  hear, it would be a  few moments
(wincing) Ouch
(not missing a beat) My dear, you cut me to the quick
Check off my name and that of my amigo here, Mr
Robbie Zirpollo
(handing them cards) Fill out these emergency cards, and turn them in when you pick up your uniforms
(pointing) over there
And Alex
(to ) She wants me
(turning back to ) Yeeees
(finger pointing) This year, let's clock in only our time card, shall we
Page 7 of 81 (head shaking, to , walking together) Some people have no sense of humor
8
-   -            8 and  walk up to yet another line of about 4 or 5 teens
At the front a teenage girl and a teenage guy are behind a counter and handing out uniforms based on a clipboard list
As  and  reach the back of the line, , a blond beauty and two other girls brush past them to the front of the line
(taken aback, breathing in through his nose) Whoa
who was that
(unimpressed, putting his hand on 's shoulder as if to hold him back, like a horse that is riled up) Eeeaasy there, big fella
Not in your lifetime
(wistfully, glancing over) Or mine
So who is she
Miss Tiffany Maxwell, daughter of Big Mike Maxwell, owner and operator of this here fine water park
and her two friends are quickly given their uniforms by the attendants, as they ignore the kids who have waited in line
(') See, Princess Tiffany and her friends pretty much have the run of the park
Her boyfriend is Dan Peterson, a guy we all call Cowboy, one of the lifeguards
Pretty decent guy from what  can tell
But she's a piece of work
Your best strategy is to steer clear of her and she won't cause you any trouble
Cowboy, huh
Big guy
Big
Guy
(takes in a deep breath) Page 8 of 81 Hmm
They are now at the front of the line
Hey Alex

Female Uniform Person has brought a blue Hawaiian shirt on a hanger
Rob Zirpollo
Uh, Robert Zirpollo (looks on clipboard) Grounds

She disappears to the back
(to ) So what is this grounds thing, anyway
Let's just say
you are critical and indispensable to the ongoing operation
and
flow of things here at the park
(he and exchange a knowing glance) Here you go, tiger
One grounds
Medium
You have a pair of green shorts at home
shakes his head "no"
(') Buy some
Tonight
Wear them tomorrow along with this shirt
You need to report to the area just south of Surf's Up
Look for a guy wearing Army pants and glasses
'll show him

They walk off
As they walk off we can hear  in the distance

-   - '  &         9 Aokee's is a restaurant near Thunder Bay
It seats about 50 and is lavishly decorated in a Hawaiian Surf and Ocean motif, with surf memorabilia, fish nets, surfboards, and the like
is a large 375 pound plus apparently Hawaiian man, late twenties, early thirties, wearing a purple Hawaiian shirt, blue shorts and a white chef's apron that says
him on a pay phone behind the counter
(to person on the line) David
how you do this to me

(listens, nods) Yes, yes
but The Gap
What you think you do there
Are there girls in swimming suits
Have you forgotten
(listens, shaking head) Tips

waves to him
He is obviously upset
(') (resigned) Well, come see us this summer, eh
You're a good kid
a good worker
Yeah, you too
hangs up the phone
Who
David
Seems to think there is future in retail
Now what  do
'm one person short
Park opens tomorrow
buries his head in his hands on the counter
(thinking) You know
just met a guy that's old Page 10 of 81 enough to work here, but he's stuck in grounds
(perking up) Good guy
Seemed like our kind of people
thinks for a moment
He glances up towards Surf's Up
It hits both he and  at the same time
We need to get him before he get his plunger
They take off running
10
-   -   '  'S10 and  are running together
They get about 50 feet before , large man that he is, runs out of breath
, like a boxer in training, sort of runs in place, keeping loose, ready for  to catch his wind
Off they go again, get another 50 feet, and the same thing happens
(out of breath) Alex
(wheeze) you got to go ahead
(wheeze) stall 'til  get there
(nodding, running in place) takes off, and  runs again
11
-   - '              11 several rolling trash cans lined up in a row, along with several janitorial carts filled with cleaning utensils and supplies
is standing, dressed in army fatigue pants and a Water World golf shirt, with a green Water World baseball cap
He is wearing black horn-rim glasses, thick lenses, and carrying a clipboard
Lined up as if an army unit are ten grounds kids, including , who is sixth furthest from
They are all younger than  except one, , whom we met at the beginning of the film
is standing tall and straight, proud to be there
He is nearest Page 11 of 81 (looking up from clipboard) Well, it looks like we have a good staff here
Yes
yes a good staff
It will be an excellent summer
Remember as we go through training today, our park is judged by the work  do
If we do it well, the people come back
(walking up and down the line) We have a little tradition here on the grounds crew
Rather than having to learn a lot of names, many of which  can never hope to pronounce properly, each grounds crew member gets a grounds crew nickname
You will be known by that nickname in every way except, of course, your paycheck and employee records
looks over his paperwork
(') Let's see, what do we    have
Hmm
yes
, first up is Eddie    Cochran
Your grounds crew nickname    will be
Eddie
smiles knowingly
This has been his grounds crew nickname for the last 8 years, mostly because he would never answer to anything else, and   gave up trying
(') Now crewmembers, listen up
Eddie here has eight years experience on the grounds crew
Why, 'd like to think there isn't anything, any situation that Eddie hasn't faced
Listen to him
Learn from him
Watch what he does
This man is the finest, most conscientious grounds crewman we've ever had
is beaming with pride now
pulls a brand new toilet plunger from the cart nearby and hands it to shoulders it as if it were a rifle
walks down the line
(') Let's see
Clark
Hmmm
Your grounds crew nickname will be
Sparky
It is all  can do not to laugh
goes on to the next kid,  who is tall, skinny and goofy-looking
' eyes are faced forward, but something catches them
His eyes follow an unseen object as we begin to hear a small mosquito
Finally his eyes follow it until he looks, cross eyed at his own nose
has taken note of this and is following it too
can take no more, and brushes it off his nose as he makes a face
Page 12 of 81 Sorry, sir
Mosquito
Hmmm
your grounds crew nickname will be
Skeeter
steps over the cart and gets another new plunger and hands it to  who follows 's lead
Next in line is a short, chubby lad,
As approaches him, a quick sound of passing gas is heard
is startled, and  makes a quick finger motion indicating the culprit is , next to him
(') (looking at the clipboard) Bradley, is it
, Mr
Bradley
your grounds crew nickname will be Snitch
shows his dismay with a frown
has run out of new plungers already and is forced to move to one of last year's leftovers, which look somewhat depressing
He gets one and give it to , who looks at it, makes a face, and decides not to shoulder it
is so depressed he looks like he's about to pass out
His worst fears have been realized
His summer is passing before his eyes
There's only one more person, a young 14 year-old girl, to go before
addresses her
(') Melinda Tally
Hmmm
your grounds crew nickname will be
(thinking) Suddenly  bursts onto the scene, and even he, at this point, is somewhat out of breath
Hello, Colonel
(thinking, staring) Alex, isn't it
Yes sir, Colonel
And what a fine staff you've assembled this year
Have you told them yet about your army background
Well, no,  didn't think it was
Page 13 of 81 (interrupting, to the grounds kids) The Colonel here is very modest
Did you know that he reorganized the entire process of cleaning and sanitizing an army barracks and its latrines
Well, it really wasn't much of a
(interrupting again) Wasn't much
(again, to grounds kids) Can you just imagine for a moment the germs and bacteria our American soldiers could pick up in an unsanitised army latrine
It's impossible to determine just how many lives have been saved thanks to the efforts of this one humble Army Colonel
Well,  suppose when you put it that way
(to the grounds kids) , too, came up through the ranks when at age 14,  began my service here at Water World learning from this great man
Yes
remember now
what was your grounds nickname
Not even sure  remember it myself, sir
But  remember much more
Did you tell them about the film
Film
(to  ) "Hygiene Makes You Happy" (to the grounds kids) Every enlisted man in the army has seen it
Some by choice
All from the mind of The Colonel here
(to himself) never forget a grounds nickname
has finally made it now, but is, of course, out of breath again
(') Page 14 of 81 (concerned) Aokee, good God, man
are you
gestures he is fine, and does a combination of charades and Hawaiian pantomime before he finally speaks
Colonel
terrible mistake
gets behind , deciding he needs some help, feeding him words
(quietly behind ) Bureaucratic bumble
Bureaucratic bumble
Lost paperwork
Lost paperwork
An error in the front office
Error in front office
Spiced applesauce

stops, turn and glares at , who merely smiles and shrugs
Good God, man, what are you trying to say
comes around from behind
It's Robbie sir
He was supposed to work at Aokee's and through some crazy mix-up, he ended up here
(looking at clipboard) Zirpollo
Well this is highly irregular
He is flipping though the papers, confused
(can't pass this up) Page 15 of 81 Most annoying
Most annoying
Never happened before
Never happened before
Spaghetti marinara
Spa
what
(exasperated) Well, if he was supposed to be assigned to you, we'll just have to let him go
has caught on and is quick to step out of line, and pick up his shirt to be ready to go
(to  ) was confused myself, sir
had heard was working for some Hawaiian guy
(reassuring) promise, we go straight to personnel, straighten the whole thing out
You won't need to worry
Very well
We'll just have to make-do
goes back to the girl  he was about to nickname before the interruption, but is staring after , and  as they walk off
He looks at
He looks back at  & company
It hits him
(') (remembering) Snafu
Sir
His grounds crew nickname
remember it now
Snafu
12         - -                              12 The entire staff of Water World is assembled for a pre opening pep talk from owner
He wears a Water World Golf shirt, shorts and a crew-style marine hat
Standing next to him is  , head lifeguard
The workers are sitting on the hill
Page 16 of 81 ,   and other "management" types are standing off to the side
and her friends are sitting up front
and  are sitting together towards the back, and 's grounds t-shirt is no longer in his hand, but has been replaced by a folded ' blue Hawaiian shirt
There is a lot of noise from everyone talking
(motioning to get everyone to settle down) Okay, everybody, let's quiet down for a minute
(they do, and he looks down at his clipboard) For those who don't know me, my name is Michael Maxwell, and
sort of run things around here
chant starts up, with affection
Big Mike
Big Mike
Big Mike
smiles, this has happened before, probably a tradition
(again motioning to settle down) Okay, yeah thanks
Now,  want go over a few basic things
First of all, make sure you've all filled out your paperwork with personnel, cause nobody gets paid unless they do
Come to think of it, suppose it's better for me that you don't fill out your paperwork, then  don't have to pay you
'll make it optional
If you want to get paid, fill out your paperwork
(looking at clipboard) Let's remember, the people who come here are our guests, and your job is to see they have a safe and fun experience here
Let's work together to keep the park clean and safe, and we'll have a great summer together
Now with a few words is our head lifeguard, Richard Thompson
Another cheer starts up, smaller this time, which starts
Big Dick
Big Dick Big Dick
(wincing some, but not Page 17 of 81 surprised, motioning to settle down) Yeah, yeah, very funny, we're all very amused
Okay, many of you have been in training for some time, and some of you still have a ways to go
a quick shot of some geeky younger guards wearing water wings, sharky goggles and noseplugs and looking less than confident
(') (glancing at the water wing group wistfully, almost to himself) a long ways to go
He looks down at his clipboard
(') but 'd like to take a moment to speak, mostly to the guards, but certainly everyone has a role in this
We can take everything we've learned and distill it down to two simple rules
Rule number one: He pauses, thoughtful for a moment, but building into a near rage for effect to impress on everyone
(') (loudly, emphatically, angry at the thought that anybody might
) Don't drown
He stops, composing himself
(') (almost quietly) Rule number two: Again, thoughtful but building to a rage at the thought that this could happen
(') (loudly, emphatically) Don't let anyone else drown
He stops again, and regains his composure
(') (almost quietly to the stunned crowd) Thank you
Have a great summer
There is stunned silence for a moment
They're not sure how to react
Page 18 of 81 (breaking the silence) Alright
Whoo whoo
, then everyone begins applauding
looks at quizzically,  just shrugs
The meeting breaks up
13         -  -    - '  &        13 Everyone is hurrying around, getting ready for opening day
, wearing his new blue Hawaiian shirt, is cutting pineapple
is busy hovering over everyone, and cooking chicken on the grill
walks in
(to ) Hey, hey lookin' good
Blue is your color
Beats that stupid t-shirt, huh
(unhappy, stressed) Alex
You are late
Come on, is opening day
finishes the pineapple and hands the tray to , almost spilling it
(') (to  and ) You two start setting tables
takes a pile of silverware wrapped in napkins, and points to  to grab a box of sugar packets to refill the dispensers
grabs it quickly, enthusiastically, but loses his grip and spills the packets on the floor
At that moment,  a girl in her teens who works at ' and is stacking plastic cups on the counter, accidentally knocks a stack of cups to the ground
, a teenage boy who works there is behind the counter
He bends over, disappearing, and we hear a crash of pots and pans
His head peers up from below the counter sheepishly
turns from the grill looking at all this, and has a worried look, but smiles and shrugs weakly
(') (to , gesturing) Alex
Come here a minute
comes up close next to him at the grill so they can talk
(') (with intensity) Alex, look
We falling apart
made you assistant manager this year
Go assistant manage
Page 19 of 81 (agreeing) No problem
pops a  out of the rack above the sound system, and puts it in the  player, stopping the standard pastoral Hawaiian music that has been playing
He turns up the volume some on the amp, and goes over to , a teenage girl working there, and grabs her grass skirt by the Velcro, removing it with a Velcro rip
(') Sorry, Sarah, but  need to borrow this
(surprised) Hey
How did you know  wear shorts under that
(mock surprise, rolling his eyes) Oh, Puh-leeaase
walks back out to the dining area, everyone is still working
(') (to all) Ladies and Gentlemen, may  have your attention, please
Everyone stops and looks at
(') In exactly 30 minutes, hundreds of dripping wet customers with fistfuls of money smelling of chlorine and suntan lotion will be walking in here
And what will they be looking for
(as if directing a choir) (except , who doesn't know any better) The best teriyaki east of the pacific
Annnnnnd
(Again except , who doesn't know any better) The finest smoothies in the state
Now, everyone's a little tense, except me, of course
So to help you get in the proper frame of mind and relax, we need Page 20 of 81 the right soundtrack
(to ) Maestro
hits the play button on the  player
(') This is little tune  like to call the Paradise Slide
(mouthing with the song as it starts) One, two, a one two three
The music starts and , now wearing 's grass skirt, launches into his version of the electric slide, Hawaiian style
gets the beat and begins working to the music
is using his spatulas as drum sticks on the overhanging kitchen tools
has inverted an empty pot and is beating it conga-drum style
has picked up the sugar packets and  is dancing and quickly (almost casually) tossing silverware/napkin rolls to  as  catches them (at first with some difficulty) and puts them on the tables
has re-stacked the cups, and is juggling salt & pepper shakers, placing them on the tables
chops onions to the beat
(on the chorus) Don Ho, Don Ho, Don Ho
Don Ho, Don Ho, Don Ho
has now taken all the chicken off the grill and comes out from behind the counter, dancing
The others form a behind him
(') (on the chorus) Don Ho, Don Ho, Don Ho
Don Ho, Don Ho, Don Ho
As they go by the tables they put on any missing items
They get into it more and more,  especially, swinging his huge, 375 pound guy hips
(') (on the chorus) Don Ho, Don Ho, Don Ho
Don Ho, Don Ho, Don Ho
As the song ends (abruptly),  bumps a surfboard (part of the restaurant's decoration) with his hip, knocking it and another one to the ground
Page 21 of 81 There is a loud crash and everyone pauses and looks at , waiting to see if he gets mad
looks down at his hip, and makes a puppy-dog face like " didn't know my hips were that big
" Everyone claps, laughing
takes a bow
14         -   - '  &                 14 and  are carrying bus tubs loaded with dirty dishes back toward the kitchen from the dining area
is sipping on a smoothie and leaning back on a counter
There are only a few customers in the eating area
They set the tubs down on a counter that passes to the back area
An unseen person takes them into the dishwashing area
(to  and ) You did good work today
Here
made you some of my special Power Smoothies
More customers later wanting dinner before park closes can't have you falling asleep on me
(') (to ) Alex, we are completely out of table stretchers and left-handed coffee pots
Take Robbie and go find some
think some at the first-aid station near Surf's Up pool
(nodding knowingly) Right
See you in a little while
They walk off carrying their smoothies
15         -   -                 15 and  are walking past Thunder Bay concessions area toward   carrying and drinking their smoothies
So that was a typical lunch crowd
Well, it's early in the season yet
We'll get busier
(incredulous) Busier
(laughing) Don't worry
You'll get used to it
And tips were good, right
Page 22 of 81 There's nothing like cash money in your pocket
What's that over there
They are coming up on   area
Oh, you'll find this ride interesting
16         -   -  -                         16 The walk up to   attraction, where kids are surfing in a high-water pressure river/ sheet of water
Surf music plays loudly here, and kids are doing all kinds of tricks
Some riders are good, some are not, and fall quickly
We also see  and , the tall skinny and short chubby grounds kids we met earlier
They are cleaning up around the exit area of
(as a rider falls) It's a lot harder than it looks
can't imagine it's that difficult
(to himself) no rudder on the board
Now this is a place of many wonders
See those guys in line over there
some guys that look a little stoned with unusual hair laughing and talking to each other
(') We call them "Wave Bums"
They all have season passes, and do little more than ride the wave all day long
Some of them get pretty good
Alex points up to a fence, behind which some smoke appears to be drifting up
(') That's where they hang out when they're not riding the wave
Don't get too close to them
No
(sniffing) Contact high
nods, understanding
points back to
Page 23 of 81 (') And there, my friend, is another one of The Wave's features
a pretty girl in line to ride
(') We call them "Wave Babes"
And there's a special secret to this ride
With that  walks over to , a guy in his late teens, wearing a Security Golf Shirt
He is standing and looking off in a different direction
(') Hey, Bob
can  borrow your radio a minute
Sure
He hands him the radio, and  is back with
(into radio) Hey Frank, it's Alex
waves and , the guard watching   waves back
(heard through the radio) Yo, Alex
(into radio) Listen you have a possible code 4
(to ) Means a "hottie"
(') (to radio) She's up next
free chicken sandwich and a smoothie if you bounce up the pressure a bit
(heard through radio) You got it bud
But two smoothies
"Volcanos"
(to ) He knows my weak spot

He reaches down and pulls something out, and turns to the walking away
(unaffected) Excuse me
Miss
(louder) Hello
excuse me
Finally she turns
We see her, but just a flash of her from the back, as the board covers her waist area
She is puzzled by this grounds kid
(') (holding up the bottom to her swimsuit) Is this yours
She looks down behind the board and reacts
She bites her lower lip, winces and nods yes
hands her her swimsuit, and she looks around and backs away towards a towel hanging from the fence nearby
is still frozen, stunned by what he's just seen, mouth wide open
waves his hand in front of 's face
No reaction
He's never seen a naked girl before
We're back to  and
(looking at ) You were right
was interested in Page 25 of 81 this
Well, sometime bring your swimsuit
We'll come back on break

And keep an eye out for Frank over there
We owe him

Both girls make an Eeeew face

He shuts the stall door, tosses the balloon up to , who places it strategically on the beam above the toilet

Eddie Enters
We see  cautiously checking out the restroom
He reaches up over the closed stall door and feels gingerly the fishing line
He smiles and shakes his head, and heads for the door

He stops to talk to two concessions girls and show them a magic trick that apparently involves a deck of cards, which he pulls from a place on his cart
We see him holding the cards so one girl can pick one

He sees Eddie in the distance about 5 minutes away, and putting a plastic liner in a trash can
He nods and disappears into the men's room

He presents a card for the Page 28 of 81 girls to see, and the both nod encouragingly, but as they walk off, they look at each other and shrug

Hey Eddie

You got this
Yeah

Listen,  know you're working but you hold on for just a minute

is out of earshot, loading a kid
hangs back a bit
(to ) Hi
We're looking for some table stretchers and left-handed coffee pots
What
Amy, this guy is looking for a table stretcher
(coming over) Aokee's huh
(surprised) Uh, yes
(to , seeing  in the background) They're all down at Big Mike's last saw
(to ) When you gonna tell him
Hi, Amy
Who's this
Katie, this is Alex and
(taken with ) Robbie
Ummm, Rob Zirpollo
Well, anyway, Big Mike's is where they are
Thanks
and  walk off
What a couple of losers
don't know
thought Robbie was kind of cute
Listen, you're new, so let me tell you how things are
First those guys were wearing blue shorts
That means Page 30 of 81 concessions
(uses her fingers to explain) The Water World social structure is organized on three levels
At the bottom are the Trash Rats
Trash rats
Bottom feeders
Grounds kids
Babies
They clean the toilets and empty the trash
Most are only 14 years old
It's the only job younger kids can do here
Next up is concessions
They're our "middle class"
We don't hang with them and they don't much hang with us
At the top of heap are the guards
You are a guard
Girl, if you want to go out with someone, stick with your own kind
(looking off at  and walking away) Aw, that's just silly
think he's cute
25         -            ' 25 This in an area where riders splash down from riding a tube down the River Country slides
and  are walking past the splashdown area
What did that girl Amy mean
About what
When she said, when are you going to tell him
'll tell you over a hamburger at Big Mike's
and  proceed to  's out of frame
in the background we see a tube splashdown from a slide and the 7 year-old girl riding in it falls out
Realizing she is no longer safely in a tube she screams and begins splashing as if drowning
guard nearby blows a single tweet of her whistle
we see four other guards throughout the area turn and react to the whistle
They begin running, style towards the scene
Page 31 of 81 Two guards are running and carrying a backboard
They converge in another  style slow-mo shot and line up along the edge of the splashdown pool
One guard in the middle has a rescue tube, and, still in slow motion, squats down slowly as if to jump in and rescue the girl
At the low end of the jump crouch, however he stops his face in close-up as he says
(slow-motion, voice distorted, to the girl) Staaaannnd Uuuuuuuupppp
The drowning girl stops splashing wildly, and realizes she can indeed stand up
She looks at all the guards lined up, smiles sheepishly, and walks out of the pool
26         -   -  '                               26 is standing outside of  's
is walking out of the restaurant
(Shaking his head) Aokee's not going to be happy
Nobody seems to know where these things are
(smiling) Yep
(now laughing) What
There's no such thing as a table stretcher or a left-handed coffee pot
What a dirty trick
(smiling) It's just Aokee's way of giving you a tour of the park without having to be there
Consider it a rookie initiation
(still mad) Humph
Time to make it up to you
Come on

-    '                                  27 Page 32 of 81 knocks loudly on the door

Alex
Hey Davey
how 'bout two for two
Malts
(looks at ) Chocolate
( nods) disappears for moment
(') Now, if he ever shows up at our back door, we owe him chicken and smoothies
But
don't we get an employee discount
Shouldn't we go in the front
Well
the discount is larger this way
is getting out money from his pocket, counting through it
shows up with two burgers and two malts, and hands them to , disappears and shuts the door quickly
is still staring at his money
(') Come on
let's go eat
They walk out of frame
28         - '                              28 and  are cleaning tables after another busy lunch
that  is filling up a bucket, and getting a scrub brush, and heads out the doorway
Oh boy
Here we go
What now
Aokee
The pigeons have been taking target practice on his trophy pedestal
Come on
They exit out the same doorway as
Page 33 of 81 29         -    - '                            29 is busily cleaning and cursing the pigeons
(speaking Hawaiian) Stupid Pigeons
They should all die
(to ) Happens every week
(to ) What is this thing for anyway
Someday, Robbie
Someday
He keeps cleaning
(to ) That stand is to display the coveted Surfer King trophy
Aokee seems to think that one day some concessions kid with more courage than brains is going to beat the lifeguards in the annual Employee Olympics
And what would this concessions kid have to do
Nothing, really
Just out surf the strongest guard of them all in the surfing competition
No big deal
Has it ever happened
guard always wins the surf competition
Know why
( and ) Because concessions kids can't swim
(still cleaning) Someday
They go back into '
30           -- '               30 is now behind the counter making smoothies
He puts Page 34 of 81 them up and the two kids waiting take them and walk away
In walk  and
(to ) Hi there
(blinking, smiling) Hello
On break
Yeah
Two Blue Crushes please
Coming up
He shakes a mix container, blends it for about 5 seconds and pours it out into two cups
He then puts in two umbrellas with pineapple
Oooh
Umbrellas
've never gotten umbrellas before
These are only for  guests
looks over to  and rolls her eyes
arrives at this point, and decides to provide a distraction
Amy
Have you ever seen the fabulous Cummings and Robbins 2000-
(shaking her head) don't think so
As he leads her back into the kitchen
It's incredible
It washes 2000 plates an hour
(to ) So
you're not from around here, huh
California
just moved here at the beginning of the summer
'll bet California's nice
've never been west of the mountains
Page 35 of 81 You'd love the ocean
And the sunsets are incredible
You can almost hear the sizzle as the sun drops into the ocean
(daydreaming a bit) Of course, we all know it doesn't drop into the ocean
No
(pause) 'm surprised you're not a guard, coming from the ocean and all
Let's just say  missed my chance, and Alex saved me from a death worse than fate
was very nearly a trash rat
(frowns) Oh
Good save
has distracted  all he could and they return from the kitchen
Well
That was exciting
Maybe next time you can show me how to scrub the grill
Come on, Katie
They leave
(to , interested) Well
how'd you do
(thinking) Mmmm
told her how beautiful the California sunsets are
Good job
You work fast
Hey it's time for our break
Bring your swimsuit
Yeah
The Wave
The Wave
love that water
looks confused
(') Can't swim
It's only three inches deep
(grabbing his suit and a towel) Ah ha
Let's go
Page 36 of 81 31         -  -                                31 and  have their swimsuits on, and are in line to get on
is coaching
Now, just take it easy, and don't expect too much at first
When you wipe out, your ride is done
is up now, and he grabs the board and jumps in
He is pretty good, but not nearly as good as the
He does a few tricks and wipes out
He gets up and walks up to the line to watch
(') (shouting) Just ease into it
takes the board and looks around
He jumps full force onto the wave
It takes him just a moment to get the feel of the board, and then he is all over it, making the look like rookies
Spins, rolls, everything that can be done he does
Finally, the guard blows a whistle indicating that his time is up
(') (meeting him at the exit) Gees
Where did you learn to do that
'm from Oceanside, California
was born on a surfboard
They start walking back
They stop for a moment to look at Thunder Bay
Just then a wave spews out, and kids on tubes are screaming as they always do
Think you could ride that
(looking right into 's eyes) In my sleep
just smiles
32         -    - '  &                32 is cleaning up behind the counter
is grinning like the cat that ate the canary
What you so happy about
Page 37 of 81 (shaking his head) You're not gonna believe it
Listen
Some guy came in today and try to buy a sandwich and pay with a phone card
Today  believe anything
took Robbie to The Wave today
(looking around) What
He drown
No
It turns out that he's from Oceanside
California
You know, where they always hold those surf competitions
Yeah
So
It turns out that he placed second in the state high school finals for the shortboard competition
As a Sophomore
Robbie
(laughing in disbelief, dismissive, then serious) Robbie barely walk without help
saw it myself
You wouldn't believe it
We hear a loud  from the kitchen
winces and gestures toward the kitchen
don' believe it
Our Robbie
Our Robbie
(thinking) If this true
this could be da year
That's what  was thinking
Well, go get him
We need to make ready
He not just walk in and win this thing
You heard it
He's in the kitchen
Page 38 of 81 goes into the back
sits at a table
Robbie comes out of the kitchen wearing a dishwasher apron
Robbie, sit down
Alex, make up a Volcano
This boy in training
(sitting down, worried) What did  spill now
the whine of a blender as  is working on the Volcano Smoothie
Robbie, Alex tell me you are some kind of surfer
This true
dunno
Yeah, surfing is usually how spend my summers
You know about Employee Olympics
Yeah
Some kind of trophy
Surfer King trophy
Very big
Very nice
(looking down) Concessions never win
arrives with the Volcano Smoothie
He turns a chair around and sits
They will gang up on him
dunno
seems kind of silly to me
It's a big deal
Every girl     wants to date you
Every guy wants to       you
Special privileges
we all     wear standard uniforms
The Surfer King     gets to be creative
You ever see the      cowboy hat Cowboy wears
It shouldn't be that hard
how good could this Cowboy be
He very good
His family go to Hawaii every year, two, three weeks
Good surfer
If you do this, you need to see Pipeman
Page 39 of 81 Pipeman
He's a myth
Oh, no
Pipeman very real
Works here in park
Low profile
You must find him and convince him to teach you the secrets of the Thunder Bay wave
This not the ocean, surf boy
(thinking) Pipeman
The Banzai Pipeline
get it
Some kind of legendary surf champ
Where do we find him
only see him once, maybe twice
Stay behind scenes
But here he is and find him you must
(to ) So
You do this
Robbie looks at them, thinking for a moment
: 33         -  - '  &                  33 quarters going ding ding ding into the pay phone on ' wall
The shot widens to reveal  is dumping quarters and  is holding the phone
He puts it up to his ear
(into phone) Hello, Grandma
No, 'm fine
Listen, Grandma
need you to send me a few of my things
and  are huddled around smiling
34         -  -  '                                   34 is standing, walking around as he speaks,  is sitting
Clearly she is being scolded
(angry) why you wouldn't believe the things 've heard
Just stupid things
Cutting in line
Demanding special treatment
Oh, and how about this one: (mimicking her) Princesses don't carry trash
(back to his voice) 've often thought it was a mistake to have you work here
Maybe  was right
Page 40 of 81 (trying to dance out of it) Oh, daddy
You know how jealous people get
'd almost believe that
But  was behind the First Aid station when you said the "princess" line
This park exists because the kids here work hard
They need to be treated fairly
They need to see you are just another lifeguard
(protesting) But 'm not just another lifeguard
(mad again) You won't even be that if this continues
If you want to keep coming here every day and driving that little convertible of yours,  need to see real, concrete changes in your attitude
All right
What do you expect me to do
For one thing, start mingling with "the commoners"
You'd be amazed at how nice some of the people who work here are
Make some friends outside that little group of yours
It's the work of the average teenager here that puts food on our table
Show some gratitude
(thinking a moment) Fine
'll work it
(softening, but firm) Good
Work on it
Please
(nodding, but we don't believe her) Oh, Daddy
Don't worry about a thing
35          -    -                          35 and  hook up and grab their time cards
There is a banner hanging that says, "Employee Luau Tonight", and and  have taken a 5 gallon bucket and are using it as a stepladder to attach something
is on the bucket with a stapler in his hand hands up the hand-lettered magic marker addition, which Page 41 of 81 staples on to the bottom of the banner while keeps a lookout
The addition says, "  '"
They scamper off, laughing
(looking up at the sign) This will be good
Aokee throws a great Luau
don't how much fun it will be
With Aokee hosting, we'll be working
There'll still be time for fun
Most of the work is setting up
Besides, we get paid, too
When was the last time you got paid to party
With that,  punches in, as if to punctuate the line
36         -  -    '  &               36 It is dark, but the place is lit up by little lights everywhere, Christmas lights in the fake palm trees, lights around 's, and lights lighting a stage where a band is playing, what else, surf music
Buffet tables line the area, and there is   set up
himself is behind the bar making smoothies, while  is playing bass in the band
is running around making sure all the buffet items are full
Everyone is wearing Leis, but the cheap plastic ones, except  and his staff, who have real ones flown in from Hawaii
(pouring out four smoothies to and ) You work hard, and we fine now
Your time to party
Here they are
Special Love Smoothies
Be careful
(to ) These never fail
picks up two Leis from a box behind the counter
He and Robbie walk over to  and  who are standing over near the buffet
(') (to , but if front of and Katie) Now this will never do
(agreeing) 'm afraid you're right
Something must Page 42 of 81 be done
and  set the smoothies on a nearby table
They remove the cheap plastic Leis the girls are wearing
Then they put on the real ones they carried over
steps back to admire his work
Oh, yes,    yes
Perfect
work of art
The girls look at each other and smile
and  grab the smoothies and hand two to the girls
sips hers right away
don't remember anything like this on Aokee's menu
They're
(interrupting) special smoothies
Fortunately, you know people on the inside
Onstage, the band had finished a tune before the dialog began above
Now  steps up to the mike
We'd like thank Aokee and his crew for hosting this evening's Luau
Everyone applauds,  waves
Alex raises a hand and waves off the accolade
nods and smiles as the  and clap as well
(') We'd also like to bring Aokee up to sing one of his Hawaiian specialties
Again, everyone claps and cheers him on
goes on stage
You girls want to dance
(grabbing 's hand and leading out to the dance floor) Sure
shrugs yes and goes out with
(onstage) Page 43 of 81 Mahalo and Aloha
This song is sung on my island for all young people in love
or about to be
Is called 'Mai, or, You Are Mine
begins singing the Hawaiian love song, " 'Mai"
Many couples are dancing; it is a slow song
, of course, is a goof
He dances slow, but every once in a while executes a deep dip, much to 's terror
is off to the edge of the dance floor, watching, longingly, and kind of swaying to the music
couple of girls walk by and he does a magic trick for them
He holds both hands up, palms open to show he has nothing in his hands
He also gestures that he has no sleeves (he is wearing a tuxedo t-shirt)
He reaches behind his back and pulls out a trick bouquet of flowers, but they don't quite open right, and are still unfolding as he holds them
smiles weakly, he knows that isn't quite how it was supposed to go
The girls appear encouraging, but as they leave look at each other and giggle
We pick up  and  dancing
So
How are things working out at Aokee's
Oh, he's great
Alex too
thought this summer was going to be a train wreck, but it's not turning out too bad
Well, of course this isn't California
No, but it looks like  will get a chance to do some surfing anyway
Really
Apparently there's some kind of surfing contest and Aokee is all over me to enter
You mean the Surfer King
You've heard of it
It's all the other girls seem to talk about
This is my first year, but Page 44 of 81 apparently it's a pretty big deal
Being from Oceanside, you should have a good chance
We'll see
It seems kind of stupid to me
surfing contest in Colorado
(laughing) My friends back home would never believe it
They continue to dance
talking to and gesturing broadly
is clearly not agreeing with what he is saying
is nowhere to be seen
Suddenly she throws up her hands and marches over to the dance floor where is standing alone, swaying a bit to the music
She whispers something in his ear, and ' eyes get real big as she leads him by the hand to the middle of the dance floor
She wraps her arms around  and they dance, all the while glaring at her father
knows a good thing when he sees it, and quickly settles in, Big Man on Campus
is taller than he is, so he happily puts his head on  shoulder
looks back at them, not happy with the way it happened, but satisfied
(twenty bucks ) is dancing with a girl when , doing some kind of fancy spin to , bumps into him
(to ) Alex
Got my twenty bucks
Oh, Dougie
You know,  left my wallet over in my locker
'll see you before we leave and get it to you then
Yeah, sure
You know, you could always come by Aokee's and  could give it to you in trade
Cash money, Alex
Cash money
No problem
grabs  and swings her into another fancy move that leads them away from
Page 45 of 81 The song ends, and everybody claps
bows
(to ) Hey, listen
Alex told me about this great spot on the other side of Thunder Bay that looks down on the party, but it's a little more quiet
Want to go for a walk
Sure
They pick up their smoothies and walk off into the night
37           -  -               37 is walking on the seawall that separates the bay from the sunning area, tightrope style
walks next to him
So
what made your folks pick up from beautiful southern California and move to Colorado
Not both my folks
Just my Mom
Aha
trouble in paradise
Let's just say my father had an eye for his administrative assistant, and now they're both somewhere in Mexico
Mom got a job here, some of her family's here, so they said "Colorady is the place you outta be"
It could be worse
Well,  must admit, 've met some very nice people
(looking down and smiling) In California, the attitude's a little different
Here, not everyone is out to prove something
Seem's like everyone just wants to have fun
have a theory
Sometimes it snows here so hard, that it's a challenge just to get to work or to school
Everything shuts down for a day or so
If your car gets stuck, people appear from nowhere to help pull you out and get you back on the road
Most people here don't just look out for themselves
lot of times, Page 46 of 81 they're looking out for you, too

All these switches feed sound throughout the park
Which reminds me
He pulls out a  and pops it into the  Player and presses He sees a flyswatter and begins waving it around like a sword
(') And this is for bad little girls who don't know how to have fun
He begins swishing it around,  is giggling

There
almost got you

closes in and seems like he will kiss her, but just starts gumming her neck, tickling her
leans back laughing and   her back hits the volume knob on the amplifier

-                           39 They have reached   the area to the west of Thunder Bay
It is simply a concrete   pad that overlooks the party below
We hear "Paradise is   in Your Eyes" by Michael Peace, which begins with a lot   of jungle sound effects
(looking down at the party) You were right
This is nice
(reacting to the jungle noises) But not necessarily quieter
Just a sec
He walks away slightly and gets on the radio
(') Hey, Alex
Give us break down here
Turn down the sound effects

Sorry
Hold that thought
Page 47 of 81 He grabs the radio
(') (into the radio) 'm on it
He turns down the volume back to normal
He also flips a switch
They hear the tune now, and  jumps off the counter, stands there and smiles
does an over-the-top mambo moving to her and they start to slow dance
41
-                                      41 has set down the radio, and is walking back to now, who is swaying to the music
He doesn't get too close to her, and actually stands off to her left
Since she has the room and is momentarily inspired, she begins a few dance moves, ballet, and then ballroom style
has seen this sort of thing before, and instinctively, almost without thinking steps in and becomes her dance partner
They proceed in a beautiful dance that almost seems rehearsed
Finally it occurs to them both
(quizzically) So where did you learn to dance like this
(smiling) Eight years at Miss Vickie's Studio of Dance
What surprises me is you
(somewhat embarrassed, keeps dancing) Can you keep my deepest, darkest secret
Of course
(hesitantly) When you grow up within spitting distance of Hollywood, every mother seems to think her child is the next Harrison Ford
So when  was about 12, my Mom started taking me to all these auditions for things
So are you the next Harrison Ford
Some days 'm not even the next Robbie Zirpollo
They continue to dance
After a few moments
Page 48 of 81 and
They stop and walk over to the railing overlooking the party
Turns out  get this part
They're selling some dish soap or something, and they think it will be magical to have two twelve year old kids dancing ballroom on this fantasy set with clouds and everything
They lock this girl and into a dance studio with a choreographer for two weeks, and then they shoot the commercial
Doesn't sound so terrible
You certainly learned how to dance
Yeah, but when it came out everyone in school saw it
couldn't go anywhere for six months without everyone in the room laughing their heads off
(touched, drawing closer) 'm not laughing
They kiss, then return to dancing
42
-    -  '  &  42 - and  discussing something; forming a plan
They are going to look for Pipeman
gestures in one direction, and  takes off
goes in another

The guard shakes his head "no"
walks off
44
-   -   -              44 is talking to a cashier in the store
She shakes her head 'no'
Robbie walks out hurriedly
45
-   -    - SURF45 is talking to Jaffa
gestures wildly, as if telling some big mythical story, but at the end throws up his hands as if to say, " don't know"
Page 49 of 81 46
-   -     -      46 We are in pitch darkness
We hear the sound of heavy scraping metal
Lights shine and we are looking up through a manhole cover being removed
bends over the hole and hollers "" and peers in
He shakes his head negatively and moves on
47
-   -  ' -    47 We are at the back door to Big Mike's
knocks, and the same kid as before, , pops his head out
appears to ask a question,  goes back in as  waits
comes out again and gestures, "no one knows"
starts to leave, but turns back and asks something else
disappears and comes back with a burger
shrugs, and walks away unwrapping and eating the burger
48
-   -               48 sees a door marked, " "
He looks down at his employee  and shrugs and goes in
As he enters we see he is pushed out by some unknown force
Out the open door comes "Wally" the Water World mascot, who walks off
Robbie has been knocked to the ground and looks up, shaking his head
He gets up and walks off
49
-   -     - SURF49 Now it is  who has separately come upon the same door, not knowing  has already been there
He enters, and the door remains open
We hear girls screaming and he exits quickly, followed by a volley of thrown girl's underwear, swimsuits and towels
50
-   -    - SURF50 This room is creepy
It is full of loud pumps and large pipes
is making his way through a labyrinth of piping and gauges and the like
He peers and sees a head with a red scarf, but it moves out of view
Surf music fades
There is a constant whine of the pumps
moves further in and finally comes across a man holding a large pipewrench, with his back to him
He is working to tame a small leak
(quietly) Hello
No reaction
(') (loudly this time) Hello
Page 50 of 81 This startles and kind of angers
Hey
You're not supposed to be in here
Yeah, sorry
Are you Pipeman
(recovering from the startle) Not on purpose
guess some people call me Pipeman
'Spose it's better than Carl
So you're real name's Carl
No
just said Pipeman was a better name than Carl
Oh
Well, my name's Robbie

Oh

That scrubsink at Aokee's leakin' again
Gees,  knew we shoudda replaced
It's not the scrub sink

With your advanced surfing experience, Aokee thought you might be able to help me
(to himself) Everybody wants to be the Surfer King
(to ) What advanced surfing experience
Well, you know
"Pipeman"
Hawaii's North Shore
Surfing the pipeline
Ohhh
Bad news, kid
hate to disappoint you, but this is the reason they call me Pipeman
'm the plumber around here
holds up the large wrench
Page 51 of 81 Oh, boy
See, 'm from California, and can surf,  just don't know what to expect from the wave on Thunder Bay
was just hoping you could help, really am sorry for bothering you
begins walking out, dejected
looks at him, and feels sorry for him
Wait a minute, kid
do know a little about surfing
also know a lot about the wave here
What exactly are you looking for from me
(perking up) need a mentor; you know like in Karate Kid
Karate Kid
He works at Big Mike's doesn't he
No, no it's a movie
Never seen it
Don't know much about this mentor thing
How's it work
Generally, you, as mentor, draw on some personal religious philosophy to first intimidate, and then later inspire me
What religion are you
(proudly) 'm Norman
Ah, Brigham Young and all that
No, no -
We follow the big fat guy on Cheers reruns
Okay
and your belief structure
Usually involves a lot of beer and corn nuts, but  don't think that's gonna work here
(thinking) Tell you what
Meet me at Thunder Bay tomorrow morning, Page 52 of 81 eight a
m
, bring your board and we'll work something out
(happily) Great, perfect
Thanks
won't let you down
(walking away, muttering to himself) What the heck is a corn-nut
51
-    -                        51 Thunder Bay looking east
and  are setting up lawn chairs
is lathering on suntan lotion, and puts on a large straw hat
puts sun block cream on his nose, and they both sit on the lawn chairs
They both have large smoothies
appears with his surfboard, and lays it up against the east fence at Thunder Bay
arrives carrying a small device in a plastic ziplock bag
approaches
Hi
Glad you could make it
(pointing to 's hand) What's that
This is how  trigger the wave
With that
garage door clicker
What did you think
Waves just happen
This is Colorado, kid
Now get your board and get in the water
Robbie gets his board and jumps into Thunder Bay, paddling over to the narrow side where the wave begins
goes down the stairs leading to near where  has positioned himself
(') You sure that's where you want to be
Should be about right
Aren't you getting in
Where's your board
Mentors don't get wet
looked it up
(pressing the clicker) Get ready
wave comes and  begins paddling
He misses it, Page 53 of 81 splashes the water angrily and turns back to paddle to position again
and  look at each other nervously
(') Want to know what you did wrong
(mad) Just gimme another wave
Oakey doakey
Another wave comes
paddles furiously and misses it again
Now he's really angry
(tersely) Okay
Please
Tell me what  did wrong
You're in the wrong position
The wave doesn't crest that soon
Move ten feet further away from the back wall
(to himself) The ocean never had a back wall
(to Pipeman) Thank you
paddles over to the spot suggested by and  are now sitting on the edge of the lawn chairs anxiously awaiting the next wave
It comes and catches it easily and begins riding it aggressively
He has a good run and kicks out at the end
and  high-five
(together) Yeee-haww
They settle back into their chairs to absorb some sun
52
'     -                     52 is behind the counter finishing up making a smoothie
, head lifeguard is on the other side; he will get the smoothie
(grinning) So
hear he's pretty good
Haven't seen him myself yet
(concerned, covering) Good
Good at what
Who you mean
Page 54 of 81 Come on
Your ringer from California
Everyone says he's gonna give Cowboy a run for his money
Robbie
Robbie barely walk without help
We hear a loud  from the kitchen
Gees
Ha
gestures back towards the kitchen
(') Your Surfer King
We just make a good show
Your boy have nothing to worry about
You know 'd feel a lot better if you hadn't taken most of my money in that poker game last Friday night
(dismissive) Poker
Not an island game
no good
(nods) Right
Tell you what
Sight unseen even money, twenty dollars on Cowboy
You want to bet with me
Take my twenty dollars, just like that
Humph
Not worth the trouble, twenty dollars
Now, maybe a hundred
hundred bucks
from the kitchen, this time pots & pans
(to kitchen) Robbie
, a hundred bucks
They slap hands to seal the deal
leaves, grinning and shaking his head
(to kitchen) Page 55 of 81 Robbie
That you
Come out here
(entering from kitchen) Sorry, dude, that tray was way off balance
Robbie, our secret getting out
You practice too good
(happy) 'm really getting the hang of that wave
Fall more
Make good show
(thinking) 'll try to remember to look and see who's watching
(pours the rest of 's smoothie) Good
Here, have a smoothie
You too skinny to surf good
smiles and takes the smoothie back to the kitchen
53
-                                 53 and  are in the middle of a practice session
is at the side,  is in the water on his board
(gesturing) , now this time, get up on the board more quickly
This is a wave pool and this wave dissipates quickly
You only have a little time to show your stuff
How will the judging work
You get a possible ten points
Three for your surfing, three for your style and four for the judge's overall impression of your ride
No one's ever gotten a ten
'm not really sure why
You've seen the competition
What does everybody do
Everybody just surfs, man and tries not to fall
The big reason Cowboy's done so Page 56 of 81 well is he goes to Hawaii for a couple weeks every year
But there he's mostly a longboarder
Your job is to figure out how to make the most outta this little wave
'm ready
The wave comes and  catches it and surfs it hard, kicking up high at the end
54
-   -              54 and  standing overlooking Thunder Bay
has binoculars and is looking through them
He's pretty good, 'll give him that
(concerned) How good
If  have an off day, he could win
(really concerned) That's terrible
You're the Surfer King
Well, some days you get the wave, and some days the wave gets you
This can't happen
What are we gonna do
don't know what you're going to do, but as me for me, 'm gonna schedule some practice time of my own
This may take a lot more than extra practice
Well,  don't know what else you expect
'll go out and do my best
If that's not enough, it's not enough
grabs the binoculars and stares down at Thunder Bay
gears turning in her head
55
-    -              55 and Alex are walking by
sees them
Page 57 of 81 Hey, surfer boy
got fifty bucks at three to one
Don't let me down, mon
(to ) Hey Jaffa
worries
(to , shocked) People are betting on me
Just a little friendly pool
No big deal
Helps make this more interesting
Concessions never had a chance before
've seen this Cowboy practice
His style is more longboard, and this is a shortboard wave, but he's still pretty good
could lose you know
Two concessions girls are walking by them
(together) Hi Robbie
How ya doin' (to Alex after they have gone by) See
How come everyone knows me by sight now
Ah, you're the next big thing
You'll survive it
The Employee Olympics are only a week away
What happens is we have this big opening ceremony where each team chooses a theme and we're judged on our spirit
Then different teams compete in contests that test their Water World skills
The next morning it all ends with the surf contest
You ready
Another group of concession girls calls  from one of the snack bars
He waves
suppose
've been working out a strategy to use if Cowboy has a real good day
It's risky
Just then they both nearly run headlong into
Well, hello Robbie
(surprised) You know me
Page 58 of 81 Of course  know you
It's my father's park,  try get to know everyone
(interrupting, eager) 'm Alex
Yes, 'm sure you are
(ignoring , back to Robbie) It's been a while since 've been to Aokee's
Do you suppose if  come down in a little while you could make some of that special chicken, what is it
The best teriyaki east of the Pacific
Yes
and one those smoothies  hear so much about
(stunned) Well, sure
'll be working all afternoon
It's a date then
See you later
She walks off
just stands there
starts walking, then comes back
Finally  pushes him on the shoulder
Come on, we gotta get back
(still shocked) Yes
Yes we do
56
'                              56 is wiping the counter alone
turns toward the kitchen
Alex
We need more large smoothie cups out here
continues cleaning up
shows up with a load of cups,  takes them and starts placing then
(') (to ) Look at that
in a far corner of 's  and  in an Page 59 of 81 animated, engaging conversation
(') Second time this week
Our boy Big Man on Campus, huh
Big something
hope he knows how to work without a net
Well
We all grow up sometime
He not drop a tray of dishes in days
Something going right
You think he ready
guess we'll both find out on Sunday sure hope so
and  again, and  is laughing loudly at some joke  has made
57           -                                     57 , ,  and  are clocking out for the day
clocks out first
drives up in her convertible
(waving him over) Robbie
goes over to talk to her
him go around to the passenger side
(shouting) Alex
won't need a ride tonight after all
Tiff's taking me home
jumps in and they drive away
,  and  are still standing on the porch of the  , shocked at what they've seen
(disbelief) Tiff
(grossed out) Tiff
(forlorn, stunned) Tiff
and  drive out the gate
We see walk slowly out of the park alone
As she is walking, we flash back to scenes of  and Page 60 of 81 together, dancing and laughing
This time the dance moves to the song of Allison Krause's "New Favorite"
We take a final look at  with the setting sun at her back and see she is crying
58
- '                 58 We see the rising sun behind 's head as he raises a conch shell and blows it like a horn
He is dressed like a Hawaiian prince
As the shot widens it reveals six males and two females dressed in Hawaiian native garb
And  are among several drummers with bamboos sticks in their hands that provide percussion for the Hawaiian war dance
Aie, noka moka kei kai ke alo
The drums begin and the male dancers, carrying spears begin the Hawaiian war dance
The drummers sing the Hawaiian folk tune "No ka moku Kiakahi Ke Aloha"
There are about 100 concessions kids in regular uniform sitting cross-legged behind them, clapping the beat in unison
The   circle each other in time to the beat, gesturing a story the seems to involve some invading army
The war dance progresses until the invading warriors are defeated and the folk song ends
At the end, the kids sitting behind raise their hand and shout
Concessions
Concessions
Concessions
Looking to the south side of the pool, we see about 50 grounds kids sitting in rows
In our foreground there are six large trash cans, with toilet plungers arranged next to them, 2 each
To our left are a line of six grounds kids in army fatigues carrying brooms as if rifles
The lead kid shouts: Company
Forward, march
team marches into full view
The grounds kids behind clap the march beat
The marchers stop in front of the line of trash cans
(') Company
Halt
They do
(') Present Arms
Page 61 of 81 The brooms come off their shoulders and are held forward
(') Company
Yes sir
Order arms
They begin a routine practiced with brooms, in a cadence, clapped by the grounds kids behind them
(') What do you do if it's wet and not yours
(in cadence) Don't touch it
Don't touch it
How do you deal with a full can of trash
We empty
We empty
Sound off
Trash Rats
Again
Trash Rats
Sound off, Trash Rats
Trash rats
Trash Rats
They stop
Their brooms are raised over their heads
Company
Brooms Ho
They allow their brooms to fall to their right side and march to the trash cans
They pull out bright blue ski masks, a la , and pick up the toilet plungers
The lead marcher holds his plunger high and shouts
(') Company
Begin
He counts a four beat rhythm and they begin a  / like drum routine with the trash cans
Page 62 of 81 Two grounds kids in regular grounds uniforms approach holding steel trash can lids by the handles (with gloves)
These become drums as well as two of the drummers switch from trash can to can lids using the stick side of the toilet plunger as the drumstick
competition erupts from the left and right sides of the line as they each set a beat and then the other matches
Finally, a show of unity as both sides join back into the beat for an ending flourish
They pick up their brooms and turn their attention to the kids behind them
They begin to march in place and the seated grounds kids clap for the tempo
(') (to the seated  ) What do you do when the table's a mess
(together) We wipe it
We wipe it
What do you do when a toilet's stopped up
We plunge it
We plunge it
Sound off
Trash rats

Trash rats
Sound off trash rats

Trash rats
They clap and cheer, and settle back down to sit
All is quiet now
concessions kids sitting, grounds kids sitting and we look to the west side of the pool and see lifeguards sitting
Everyone is looking around
Suddenly two lifeguards dressed as Roman Soldiers appear with horns
They bellow a Roman Call to Action, and two Roman drummers lead a column of other lifeguards
Page 63 of 81 First we see female guards dressed in togas filing in
Behind them are six gladiators with swords and shields, marching
They are followed by one female lifeguard with a basket of rose petals
She is throwing them into the path of the next group to enter
Next we see six more guards dressed as slaves carrying , who is sitting up on a First Aid backboard
is wearing laurel leaves and a toga, he is obviously Cesar
On the backboard is also the surfer king trophy
They all approach the area in front of the seated guards, and rearrange themselves so that  has a good view of the gladiators
The drummers count a cadence that sets the pace for a simulated battle between the gladiators
The simulated battle rages until three of the gladiators are on their knees before the three victorious gladiators
The victorious gladiators hold their swords over the fallen ones, and look to  for a yea or nay
generously waves and makes a thumbs up signal, and the swords are put away
The seated lifeguards all raise their fists and shout
(together) Lifeguards
Lifeguards
Lifeguards
The guards holding  set him down in front of an elevated platform that has a microphone
picks up the surfer king trophy and walks to the platform
He sets the trophy on a table next to the microphone, arranging it carefully
We see now there is a large banner hanging at the back of the wave pool that says " "
moves to the microphone and raises his arm in a regal manner and speaks
(to all) Let the games
begin
The seated crowd now stands and cheers loudly
We see a group of three people, two male and one female, adults we will later identify as
They nod approvingly and write something down on their clipboards
We see near them, smiling broadly
59
- '                 59 We see that the lounge chairs have been removed and the area is clear
There are scattered squashed up pieces of white paper lying about
Page 64 of 81 We look to the south and see that there are three boy/girl teams with one of their legs tied together, like a three legged race
The rub here is one team member has the dustpan and the other team member has the broom
triggers a starter pistol and they are off
The lifeguard team falls almost immediately, and the grounds team takes a early lead over the concessions team, who are trying to figure the dustpan/broom operation out
The two grounds people work tightly together and quickly advance
The lifeguards have gotten back up and are hobbling up to their first piece of trash
Concessions has figured out the dustpan, but are still well behind the grounds kids
Finally, the grounds kids win, with concessions up second, and lifeguards trailing in third
The judges note the finish on their clipboards
60
-                                60 We see three male participants standing in the shallow end of Thunder Bay, One red suit (lifeguard) one blue suit (concessions) and one green suit (grounds) on the rise to the west of Thunder Bay blows an air horn to start the race
They all rush into the bay and begin swimming furiously
The guard takes the lead quickly, followed not far behind by the grounds kid
The concessions kid is working hard and splashing a lot but not getting very far
As the guard reaches the back wall, he does an underwater racing turn and swims back toward the point where they started
Right behind him, the smaller grounds kid does the same thing
As they are returning, they pass the concessions kid, who still is splashing a lot but not going fast
After they pass him he stops, as he is tired out
Momentarily he can't even tread water any more, and a guard watching from the sidelines jumps in and pulls him out
The swimming guard has beaten the grounds kid, the concessions kid never finishes
61            - '                 61 There are three lines set up with several participants
It is a relay race, with the baton replaced by a tray full of drinks in paper cups, water
The colors indicate again concessions, guards and grounds
The race is already in full swing, with concessions in the lead
The last group of relayers are now getting their trays, and concessions is way ahead
Page 65 of 81 Everyone is cheering their team on
The final pass is made to  who works for 's
She takes the tray and moves gracefully to the final stop
There is a small table on which the drinks must be placed
She is clearly going to win when she suddenly stops
All concessions kids are shocked and plead her to go on
She does a nifty and graceful around the back maneuver with the tray, proceeds to the table, and sets down the drinks, tipping the tray sideways to show no water has been spilled
The  scribble furiously
62
- '  &                 62 Three picnic tables are set up in front of 's
dolly past each one to see that they are cluttered indentically with what appears to be the leftovers from lunch for four
Behind each table is a team of two guards, concessions and grounds kids
blows a whistle and we begin by looking at the lifeguard team
It is a boy and a girl and the girl is not too keen on this
They bring a trash can with them and begin gingerly clearing the table, acting as if they are afraid to get their hands dirty
We dolly left to see the concessions team a little ahead of the guard team
We dolly further left to reveal a grounds kid in a full rain suit with a face shield
tremendous force of water is clearing the table into the trash can which the rain-suited grounds kid is holding at it's end
We dolly further left to see  in full army fatigues with safety goggles on and wearing the biggest super-soaker water gun in the history of man
The table is quickly cleared, and at the same time washed
holds up the business end of the Super-Soaker gun and blows imaginary smoke from it's barrel, like an old Western gunfighter
The  take notes
63
- '                         63 The three different teams are gathered in groups waiting for the next challenge
One of each team is in full sweats, color coordinated by team
is the one in the sweats for concessions
Slowly the sweats people walk into the pool about waist deep and lay Page 66 of 81 down
The grounds kid is the littlest guy of all
blows a whistle and four members of each team run into the water and drag their now soaked sweat suited teammate out of the water
They lie them down on a clear area and begin
The guards have a nifty little plastic device that lets them blow air into the mouth of their victim, and they roll him quickly on his side to clear water and back to begin
They are fast and efficient, and clearly expertly trained
We move left to see the grounds kids, knowledgeable but inexperienced
One girl is using her hands to provide a seals over the mouth of her "victim" and another is clumsily pumping his chest while the others try to keep a count while reading some kind of instruction card
We move again to see the concessions kids, who are in trouble
is lying there dying, and they are arguing about who has to breathe into his mouth
They form a circle over him, pointing and arguing
Finally they all just walk off and  is still lying on the ground, eyes rolled back and twitching convulsively in a hilarious death scene
The  take their notes
64            -                 64 Once again three teams representing the three competing factions
Large stainless steel pots are bubbling on three propane cooking stands in front of the concession
The teams each have three members in cooking aprons, again, color coded
One from each team is stirring the team's chili while the others watch the  anxiously
Lines are forming in front of each pot, with people in line each carrying a paper chili bowl, but holding back, deferring to the
The  are each carrying three styro cups in which to receive the chili
They each get a portion from the guard team and take a sip
They smile politely to the cooks, but turn around and spit the chili back into the cup as delicately as possible, almost as if throwing up
concessions kid is there with a tray of waters, which they quickly take advantage of
They move on to the grounds team
They get their portions and taste the chili and nod, not bad
They take another sip of water to clear their palate and move on to the concessions team
The portions are proudly scooped
They take a taste, smile and take some more
They huddle for Page 67 of 81 a moment and then place a blue ribbon on the concessions pot
The lines quickly rearrange and merge themselves so that everyone is in line for the concessions pot
65            - '                  65 An obstacle course has been set up, and the event provides a background to the dialogue that follows
has some papers, and is talking to  and
(looking through the papers) This isn't good
(looking at  and ) It's the same as every year
Pretty much a dead heat going into the surf championship tomorrow morning
can't believe those guys screwed up the Hard to blame them
No one told them they had to put their mouth on yours until the last minute
Yuck
Bunch of babies
(to ) It's going to be up to you
We slip a little
You have to make up
That trophy need a new home
They look over at the obstacle course where a tiny grounds kid is jumping up and down and raising his arms -style
(') You need to make up
You ready
Tomorrow morning last event
You our last hope
just looks at both of them nods and sighs heavily as the other grounds kids surround our winner in the background
and  walk off
Suddenly  appears
Hi Robbie
(shy but still very much smitten) Oh
Hey
How's your team doing
Uh
,  guess
Kind of a tie
Page 68 of 81 Well,  think you're going to take care of that tomorrow morning
In fact, 've planned a little celebration in advance
We're going to this incredible party up in the foothills at some friends of mine
(intrigued) Party, huh
That sounds like fun have to work until nine tonight
That's perfect
'll come back here and pick you up
She starts to walk off
(') Oh, and Robbie
call your mom and tell her you're spending the night at Alex's or something
It's going to be a very special night
(hypnotised) She walks away
stands there a moment before waking up and leaving also

- '  &                        66 It is dark
We see  and  cleaning up from the day's food service
Is wiping down the smoothie area, is sweeping on the other side of the counter

Something's going on
(shaking his head no) Robbie know the right thing to do
He's a good boy
So how about this
He tells me 've got to cover for him if his mother calls
He told her he's spending the night at my house
He say that
Yes
Tiffany's got something up her sleeve and Robbie's too messed up to Page 69 of 81 notice
(reflective) Spending the night at your house
This very bad
Very bad
(') He should be done with the dishes by now
Tell him we want to talk
disappears back into the kitchen
goes to an empty table under the one light on in the dining area and sits down
comes back and  follows
Hey
'm done with the pots and pans
It's almost nine
Can  take off now
Robbie, please, sit
sits down
So does
Robbie looks at both and gets suspicious
Everything
That's what we gonna ask you
What you plan tonight
Well, Tiffany invited me to a little party up in the mountains
Robbie, you athlete
Big day tomorrow
You need sleep, not party
It's no big deal
'll be fine
Is big deal
Robbie
You good boy, smart, everybody like you, but
But
Face it
Only one reason Tiffany interested in you
She want to make you so tired and so crazy you lose tomorrow
(disbelief) Aw, come on
Page 70 of 81 Robbie
She's still going out with Cowboy
saw them together at the movies two nights ago
Maybe she's just letting him down easy
Robbie
things
things are not always what they seem to be
Like what
In this case, she acts like she likes you when really she wants Cowboy to win
Naw
You guys are nuts
She's not like that
She is like that
Look,  know what to believe and what not to
'm not that easily fooled
Aokee
(shaking his head) Go ahead
Tell him
trust him
Take Aokee for instance
Gentle, genial Hawaiian guy, right
Sure
He's great
love working here
Aokee, you've been real good to me
Then let me introduce you properly
Robbie Zirpollo, meet Manuel Ramirez
' head is down in his hands
Robbie looks stunned
(') Manuel's family snuck across the border ten years ago through Juarez, Mexico
(accent gone) My father refused to work for a drug lord who ran our town
They tried to kill Page 71 of 81 him
We barely got out with our lives
Aokee
(accent now Mexican) name  picked up reading an obituary in the paper
sent away to Hawaii and got his birth records and social security number
This way,  never have to worry about immigration
spent weeks watching tapes of Hawaii Five- just to get the accent right
"Book 'em Danno"
Huh
What's that all about
(to Alex) And you knew
nods yes
burnt my hand on the grill one day and started swearing in Spanish
(interrupting) And  said, boy, you speak Spanish like a native
uh oh
It's been our little secret
Now it's your secret, too
(looking at his watch) need to think about all this
(nodding) You do
Sleep tonight
Sleep well
(gets up, dazed) Right
Goodnight
leaves
and  just sit, looking at each other
67
-                                67 Hundreds of people are gathering on bleachers to watch the surfing competition
large highway construction type signboard has been erected and says "Grounds   93", "Concessions 93" and "Lifeguards 94"
It is almost a festival atmosphere
The  are standing Page 72 of 81 in a group, conferring, near a table that has the controls for the sign
The sign can be viewed easily from the bleachers
look over to the front of 's and see  and standing outside the restaurant
68
-   - '  &  68 (to Alex) Have you seen him
Not yet
They are looking to the north towards the crowd, but appears behind them
(looking in the same direction) What you lookin' at
We looking for you
How you sleep
slept fine
(pause as  and  wait) decided 'm not my father
don't run out on the people  care about just because some blond shakes her ta-ta's at me
(relieved) We go then
picks up his board, and they begin walking toward the bleachers
stops and turns suddenly
She shook her ta-tas
No one said anything about shaking ta-tas
(reflectively) This puts a whole new light on things
He is in 's way
pushes him with his board
Get going
69
-                                    69 ,  and  from grounds, who we met earlier and was conned into the contest because she said she surfed once on vacation, are all standing in front of the
One  explains the rules
Page 73 of 81 (looking down at clipboard) Alright, here's the deal
You get three tries; three heats
We judge each run and only your high score counts
If you fall you get no score for the run
Your score will be added to the total for your team, and the winner gets the Surfer King Trophy
Any questions
They all shake their head no
(') Then let's begin
Grounds is up first
grabs her board and begins paddling out
The wave comes and it's all she can do to stay on her board
She struggles and falls at the end
She will clearly not be a factor
The big screen shows a 0 in a column after the grounds score
We look back to the bleachers to polite applause, but the and the grounds kids are clearly disappointed
is out there now, the wave comes and he catches it easily
He rides the wave gracefully and well, and kicks out at the end
The big screen shows an 8 in the lifeguard row
The lifeguards and  are cheering now
is next
He catches the wave and rides it more aggressively than , but nearly falls at the end of his run
The big screen shows an 8
The concessions kids and are very enthusiastic
They can see they have a chance with
is watching from a far corner
begins her second run
She is a little more confident this time, but still seems barely able to stand and ride the wave
More polite applause, and the big screen shows a 5
catches his wave, and tries to imitate ' more aggressive style, but falls midway through the run
We hear a large gasp from the crowd as this happens
The crowd applauds politely, and the guards are supportive but disappointed
We see the  confer and the big screen shows a 0
gets his wave, and surfs it aggressively again, this time not nearly falling at all
The  nod approvingly and confer
The big screen shows a 9
The crowd goes wild, especially the concessions kids
Melinda begins her final run
She does better than the past two, but not significantly
The  confer and the screen shows a 5
The ground kids are very disappointed, they know they are out of it now
shakes ' hand and thanks her for her efforts
Page 74 of 81 gets his wave, and has clearly decided to go back to his original style; he rides the wave gracefully, but takes no chances
He kicks out at the end with a wave and a smile
The guards applaud, hoping to make it seem better than it was, and the confer and the screen shows an 8
snags his wave and rides it aggressively again, but loses his balance momentarily
It costs him; the confer and the screen shows a 7
The concessions kids applaud, and the point totals show "Grounds   98", "Concessions 102" and "Lifeguards 102"
is confused, there has never been a tie before Are flipping through papers, and   steps up to the microphone
(clearing his throat, flustered) It looks like we have a tie
This has never happened before, but  seem to remember we provided for this possibility in the rules
Hopefully our judges can help us figure out what to do
The   is reading to the other  out loud, slaps his hand on one of the papers and comes up to the mike
Reading from the rules, "
in the event of a tie at the end of three heats in the surf competition, the teams who are tied will participate in a sudden-death surf off
Additional heats will be run until a winner can be declared
" (looking up at the crowd) The "Sudden Death" heat will begin in five minutes
Everybody cheers
they're going to see some more great surfing
The  signal  and  to come over
The head takes a quarter out of his pocket and points to to call it
It lands and the  looks at it
points to
(') You want to go first or second
Second
Be ready in five minutes
70         -  - '  &                  70 Page 75 of 81 , ,  and  have gathered in front of 's to strategize
So what you do
Wait for him to go crazy and fall
Don't want to win with him falling
You could always go out and do your very best, take a lot of chances and maybe win this thing on merit
(dismissive) Don't be silly
That only works in the movies
(shakes his head) Actually, that's exactly what 'm thinking
It's the reason we're in a tie
've been too conservative
've got to do everything  can, or just forget about it
It's all or nothing
(pause) We gotta pull the fin
Pull da fin
You think you can hold it
(explaining) One time, these tourists from Japan on the beach at La Jolla offered me a hundred bucks to do a full spin at the top of the wave, and then slide down and cut back and do a full back flip pulled it off
friend of mine had a tricks board with just a single fin and foot pockets
We gotta pull the fin
What do we do about the foot pockets
You got duct tape
reaches into his tool belt and pulls out a roll
What kind of plumber would  be if didn't have duct tape
Water World Page 76 of 81 Platinum
Where do you want them
They place the board on a table
pulls off two small pieces of tape and places them on the board
Here and here
gets his screw gun out of his tool belt and begins removing the two outer fins of the board
He then begins looping duct tap around the board to create two foot pockets
This provides a background to the dialog below
So, help me understand
What you do now
Pipeman is taking the extra fins off my board
only need one to make a deep cut back
He is also putting some pockets to slip my feet into so when flip upside down,  don't lose the board
Flip upside down
back flip
You guys see it on snowboarders here all the time, 'm sure
Oh yeah, 'm sure  did that last winter
But not on purpose
Dude
You're either gonna win this thing or you're gonna die
(quickly, eagerly) It would be better if you won
Yeah, well, a tie is like kissing your sister
(mock anger) You stay away from my sister
We hear an air horn blast
They are ready to start
Ready
(to ) 'll need the biggest wave you can give me
(imitating Mr
Scott on Star Page 77 of 81 Trek) 'll give 'er all she's got, Cap'n
He hands Robbie the board
heads back to the bleachers area,  goes to the pumphouse in back of Thunder Bay
hangs back with  and speaks to him alone
(dropping his Hawaiian accent) Robbie
When you do this, do this mostly for Robbie Zirpollo
But do it just a little bit for Manny Ramirez, eh
smiles and pats him on the back
Robbie nods
They head for the bay
71
-   -                         71 is in the water paddling out to get his wave
It comes and he has apparently decided to stay with what has gotten him this far; a conservative style that keeps him looking good without falling
His ride is similar to the last one, but even more graceful and lyrical and he gets a 9
(to ) Looks like he's waiting for you to make a mistake
You sure you know what you're doing
'm just making this up as  go along
Works for me
Go get 'em
appears on the seawall holding his board and looking out first at the bay, then at the crowd
His mom, waves, and he smiles weakly
sees  and she looks hopeful
She hasn't given up on him completely
He smiles at her and gets into the water
He begins paddling
It seems to take forever for him to get out to the spot where he catches the wave, but he finally arrives
He sits there for a moment, collecting himself, then raises his hand to signal he is ready
The   have started to chant,
The guards are anxious, but even they can't help moving to the cadence of the chant
The wave comes and he catches it quickly, and slips his feet into the duct tape pockets
He misses one pocket at first, then gets it in
He rides it carefully and at the right moment slides up to Page 78 of 81 the top and executes a full 360 degree turn out of the water
On landing back on the downside of the wave, he slides down it quickly, and then turns around with a deep cut and heads straight into the wave
At the top he bounces and does a complete back flip in slow motion
We see the crowd also in slow motion
Is covering his eyes, he can't watch
's face is contorted with disbelief
Various faces in the crowd are in open-mouthed disbelief
are staring intently, focussed so as not to miss anything
lands the flip, and rides the rest of the wave
He waves to the crowd, and kicks off, exhausted
The place goes nuts
No one here has ever seen anything like this before
and  run into the water and help him out
People are still cheering
knows he's in trouble
confer only momentarily and the score 10 appears, and the word concessions starts flashing along with the word winner
nods in agreement
says something to him, and he appears angry
We can only hear part of his response, something like: (disbelief) You did
and  lead him up to the grandstand
also makes his way up there, and we see him talking to
nods in agreement and  goes to the mike as the crowd settles down
(') As last year's Surfer King, it's my privilege to present this year's trophy to the most amazing surfer on the water today
Robbie
Congratulations
shakes 's hand, and  speaks at the mike
(holding trophy) just want to thank Aokee, Alex and Katie for all their support
We see  clapping, crying
and  are clapping and smiling
(') And  have just one thing to say to everyone in concessions
holds the trophy high as everyone cheers

72 Grounds kids are stacking chairs in preparation for final closing
Tarps are being thrown over everything and tied down
Awnings are being taken down
Chairs and tables are being moved
We see  packing up his 's into that cardboard box also snaps the winter covers for the sound equipment into place

-                         73 banner hangs over the time shack, "Thanks for another great year"
, ,  and  are clocking out for the final time this summer
They all stop and look around one final time
Suddenly drives up in her convertible
Another summer gone
How about it Robbie
You gonna guard next year
They could use your help
They all walk closer to her car
don't know
we have a pretty good time at 's
You know, that's what  hear
Maybe should work there next summer
, ,  and  all say these lines pretty much at the same time
You wouldn't like it
That's a bad idea
And you're such a good guard
You'd be miserable
Maybe you're right
See you around
appears out of the time shack wearing his tuxedo t shirt
Page 80 of 81 (almost singing) Tiffany
He walks up to her driver's side
(feeling charitable, warmly) Hello, Eddie
shows there is nothing in his hands, then reaches into the car and from behind 's ear pulls a plastic Easter Egg out
He hands it to her, and she opens it
beautiful butterfly flies out and away
She is momentarily entranced
(') You know, that's one of the most beautiful things 've ever seen
(pause, thinking, what the heck) Hop in Eddie, let me give you a ride home
waves his hand for  to scoot over so he can drive
She is surprised, but does, almost reflexively
He gets in and he looks at , ,  and  grinning broadly as he pulls away
, ,  and  just watch in stunned silence as and  drive off
(collecting himself) Well
Just another summer at Water World
The group begins walking toward the exit gate, as we go wide and helicopter upward
They get smaller and smaller in the shot as we hear the conversation continue
You know Katie,  really am sorry  was such a jerk this summer
We'll be going to the same high school
You'll have plenty of chances to make it up to me
Let's see, there's Homecoming, the Christmas Dance, Valentines Day
and of course, the prom
Alex
Yeah
'm gonna need to borrow twenty bucks
Page 81 of 81 Yep
We helicopter up for a final shot over the whole park
