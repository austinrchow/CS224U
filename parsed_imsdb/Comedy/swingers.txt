Jon Favreau's "Swingers" by Jon Favreau Dec
13, 1994 Third draft 1
-                                           1 The soundtrack opens with Frank Sinatra's "Fly Me to the Moon"
basin
The pool of golden light disintegrates into the thousands of points which constitute it as we rapidly draw closer to the city
We are just above the tops of the highest buildings as we approach Hollywood Boulevard
Below is neon and the icy thrust of search lights rotating on the corner of Hollywood and Vine
We continue west, then quickly north
There is the momentary appearance of the moonlit sign as we pass the blinking red beacon of the Capital Records building and drop into Franklin avenue and over the 101
Architectural remnants of Hollywood's past whip up
We are heading east at treetop level
warm glow in the distance quickly grows into a modest commercial strip which includes cafes, bookstores, and a theater
We drop to eye level as we spy through the plate glass showcase window of the "Bourgeois Pig" coffeehouse, which holds the translucent reflection of the full moon

He sits in the window sprawled across a red velvet couch that once perfectly complemented a faux spanish foyer

And what if  don't want to give up on her
You don't call
But you said  shouldn't call if wanted to give up on her
Right
So  don't call either way
Right
So what's the difference
The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back
See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back
You can only do things to make her not want to come back
So the only difference is if  forget about her or pretend to forget about her
Right
Well that sucks
It sucks
So it's almost a retroactive decision
So  could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like just pretended to forget about her
Right
or more likely the opposite
Right
Wait, what do you mean
mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call - whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care
Unless she comes back first
Ah, see, that's the thing
Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore
There's the rub
There's the rub
Thanks, man
Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time
Hey man, don't sweat it
It's just that you've been there
Your advice really helps
No problem
Rob,  just want you to know, you're the only one  can talk to about her
Thanks
Thanks, man

Mike pushes the button
(synthesized voice) Hello, you have five messages
Mike's eyes light up
He paces in anticipation as the tape rewinds
(male voice) Hey, baby
It's Trent
hope you're feeling better about your old girlfriend
hope my advice helped
Mike fast-forwards to next message
(synthesized voice) Skipping message
(male voice) Whatsup, Mike
If you want to talk some more about Michelle

Tension grows with every inch of spooling tape
Did she leave a message
(female voice) Hi, Mike
Did she call yet
If she didn't then she doesn't deserve
(synthesized voice) Skipping message
The last one
It's a long shot, but he's got the faith
(elderly female voice) Michael, this is Grandma

told the whole family and they're very excited to know if

End of final message
(lighting a cigarette, defeated) Shit
(synthesized voice) You have to put things in perspective
(unfazed by the sentient appliance) know,  know
(synthesized voice) You've been through worse
You're right
know
(synthesized voice) Ever since 've known you
don't know about that
(synthesized voice) Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this
It didn't feel that way
(synthesized voice) That's because it was a challenge
You has control over you're situation
It was hard, but you rose to it
Okay
'll think about that
Bye
(synthesized voice) You really should
Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges
(growing irate) Enough
've got to use the phone
(synthesized voice) Are you calling Her
No
Stop, come on
The  goes black as the machine beeps off
Mike picks up the phone and hits autodial
Machine beeps off
Phone rings again, then is answered
(over phone) Hello
'up Trent
Lemme get off the other line, baby
We hear the clicks of call-waiting-hold limbo
The silence is interrupted
(synthesized voice over phone) You should call your Grandmother
Shuddup
(returning to line) That was Sue
We got two parties tonight
One's for a modeling agency
don't know
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there
Trent,  don't feel like going out tonight

Listen to you

You gotta get out with some beautiful babies
You can't sit home thinking about her
don't know
don't know,  don't know- listen to you
We're gonna have fun tonight
We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about
But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck
spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to
And it's like 'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack
Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes
'm not gonna be one of those assholes
It's fucking depressing
Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me It makes me want to puke
(beat) You got it bad, baby
You need Vegas
What are you talking about
Vegas
What Vegas
We're going to Vegas
When
Tonight, baby
You're crazy
'll pick you up in a half an hour
'm not going to Vegas
Shut up- yes you are
Now listen to Tee
We'll stop at a cash machine on the way
long thoughtful pause
can't lose more than a hundred
Just bring your card
Half an hour
Wait
What
What are you wearing

Oh
Now Mikey wants to be a high roller
No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit
Okay Bugsy
Twenty minutes
Wear a suit, 'm telling you it works
Be downstairs
You're beautiful

'  -   -                   4 Mike is dressed to the nines in classic vintage threads
He's trying to look at ease as he straightens his cuff links
He approaches Trent who suavely leans against his worn down ride
He's a tall, slim, good-looking cat
His sharkskin suit hangs well on his lanky frame as it tapers to his ankles
Sinatra's "Come Fly With Me" on the tape deck adds an elegance to the scene
They exchange an impish grin and depart without saying a word
Maybe this isn't such a bad idea

figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night
You gotta be cool though

'  -                                    8 The two swingers are starting to fray around the edges but are unwilling to admit it to each other or themselves
Frank has been replaced by talk radio

The needle is still buried

Wake up, baby
(stirring) Whu
Look at it, baby
Vegas, baby
Trent points out a mountain range
It is now the only thing separating them from their destination
The surreal glow of the desert sky is accentuated by the loud slashing of the cobalt and ruby lasers emanating from a source masked by the craggy peaks
Mike slowly stirs from his slumber
He is transfixed by this affrontation of nature
It is his first glimpse of the city without God
(in reverie) Vegas

-                                         11 The shrill cry of Basie's fat brass section heralds the arrival of the young swingers
Their eyes drink every watt of golden light as Sinatra's crooning urges them on
Mike has either had enough sleep or so little that it no longer matters
Either way, there's no turning back
They roll up to a casino valet
to a skull and crossbones which looms overhead
: 12
-                              12 The two guys walk and talk down a fluorescent hallway
It is well past midnight and the only patrons at this hour are tourists too drunk to sleep and compulsive gamblers who snuck out of their rooms without waking their wives
It is a weeknight and it is beginning to become painfully obvious that our boys are overdressed
The decor is nautical plaster
Castings of bearded men with primitive prosthesis clutching daggers between their teeth are everywhere
All of ye olde promenade shoppes are closed
(the first budding of crankiness) Pirates of the fucking Caribbean
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates
Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland
You gotta love the pirates, baby
The pirates are money The corridor empties into the equally kitch
This place is dead
thought this was the city that never sleeps
That's New York, baby
You should know that
Look at the waitresses
'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby
They're all skanks
Baby, there are beautiful babies here
Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six
This is the skank shift
What are you talking about
Look at all the honeys
Trent contorts his face at a cute  passing by with a tray of drinks
Arrrrg
The waitress cracks a smile as she crosses away
Mike is visibly embarrassed
Cut that shit out
She smiled baby
That's not cool
Did she, or did she not smile
It doesn't matter
'm telling you, they love that shit
You're gonna screw up our plan
We're gonna get laid, baby
First let's see what happens if we play it cool
What
You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us
Don't make fun,  think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around
Who's fucking around
'm not making fun
Let's do it, baby
The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free
Well, you look money , baby
We both look money Mike points to a semi-curtained, semi-roped-off area near the baccarat tables
The clientele is classier, but they're still obviously overdressed
(pointing) That's where we make our scene
You think they're watching
Oh, they're watching all right
They're watching
: 13
-    -         13 Mike is at a blackjack table with Trent at his side
The game has paused to observe the newcomers as Mike draws a billfold out of his breast pocket
They're pulling it off with only slightly noticeable effort
don't know,  guess 'll start with three hundred in, uh, blacks
Mike tries to hand the  a handful of twenties after counting them twice
On the table
Sorry
You have to lay it on the table
Uh,  don't want to bet it all
The other players grow impatient
You're not allowed to hand me money, sir
You'll have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it
(hastily laying down the bills) Oh
right
The dealer lays out the bills such that the amount is visible to the camera encased in the black glass globe overhead
Trent and Mike look up at it open-mouthed like turkeys in the rain
Blacks
Mike's attention is recaptured by the dealer, but Trent continues trying to peer through the smoked glass
Huh
You want this in black chips
Sure, that'll be fine
The dealer chirps out an unintelligible formality and the chirps the response
Trent's focus whips away from the camera as both he and Mike stare at the pit boss ten feet away
The dealer plunks down the measly   which represent Mike's entire cash reserve
Not quite the effect he had hoped for
The swingers stare at the chips
The players stare at the swingers
The dealer stares at the pit boss
Do you have anything smaller
Yes, but 'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet
Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables
The dealer indicates a -  across the room where an Hispanic woman deals to a , a , and a in matching Siegfried and Roy -shirts
The swingers look back to the dealer who is now flanked by the pit boss
The tense silence is broken by
Drinks
(then to Trent) How about you, Cap'n Trent looks over to see that it's the same  who flashed him a smile earlier
At first he begins to smile, then, remembering that he is locked in a high stakes battle of wills, subtly shakes her off
She smirks and starts to leave until she is interrupted by Mike holding up a finger
It's a balsy move, but everyone's watching
The kid's going for broke
(to the waitress, but never breaking eye contact with the dealer) 'll have a vodka martini, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry
Smooth
Trent is impressed, but masks his pride
(under her breath cynically as she writes it down) One "James Bond"
Ow
She exits
(regaining composure) No
Blacks will be fine
Mike throws a chip in the circle
Trent is shocked
That's a hundred bucks
Mike and Trent share a look
The dealer and the pit boss exchange glances
Bets are all down and the cards are meticulously dealt
The dealer has a two showing
Mike has been dealt a five and a six- eleven (hushed tones) Double down
(even husheder) What
Double down, baby
You gotta double down on an eleven
know, but
You gotta do it
but that's two hundred dollars This is blood money If we don't look like we know what we're doing, then we may as well
Everyone's waiting for them
know
The dealer, the pit boss, and all the players look on as Mike drops    in the circle with a barely audible, yet deafening, thud
(with all the nonchalance he can muster) Double down
bead of sweat
The sharp snap of a dealt card
It's a seven
Eighteen Disappointment twists their faces
Finally the dealer flips over his card
It's a king
Twelve Here comes the bust
Flick - four
Sixteen Here comes the bust
Flick - five
Twenty one Groans all around, except for the swingers who watch their chips slide away in silence
Mike breaks the spell with a plucky smile from the pit of his stomach
(to the pit boss) Sure could use some dinner about now
: Trent and Mike are wedged between the  and the At the
They share a pile of red chips
'm telling you, baby, you always double down on an eleven
Yeah
Well obviously not always Always , baby
'm just saying, not in this particular case
Always
But  lost
How can you say always In the meantime, the Bluehair has been dealt an eleven
This captures the swinger's attention
Hit
Four
Fifteen all together
Oh
don't know
Hit
Two
Seventeen Dealer has a seven showing
What the hell- hit
Four
Twenty one (with a warm smile) Twenty one
Polite applause from around the table which the Bluehair humbly waves off
Mike looks at Trent
Daggers
Trent shrugs
different   approaches
Would you care for some breakfast, ma'am
Well
No,  shouldn't
Maybe later
Thank you, though
(to Trent, under his breath) 'm gonna fuckin kill you
: 14
- '  -           14 Mike is presented a stack of twenties by the , who counts them out
Trent looks on
eighty
one hundred
one hundred and twenty dollars
We hope to see you back on the high seas soon
(polite smile) Mike throws her a disgusted look, then turns to go
Trent struggles to cheer him up
What's that
One twenty
You're up twenty bucks, baby
Mike throws him a disgusted glare
Well, you know, not counting the first table
Thanks for clarifying that
Hey, man, 'm down too, you know
Yea, how much
don't know, what
Thirty, Forty maybe
Don't give me that shit
You know exactly how much you lost
What'd you drop
Twenty
but  was down at least fifty
'm sorry,  got hot at the crap table
You won
There's nothing to be sorry about
You're a winner
'm the fuckin loser
should be sorry
Baby, don't talk like that, baby
Let's just leave
Baby, you're money You're the big winner
Let's go
(condescending) Who's the big winner
Mike looks away, shaking his head in disgust
(lifting Mike's reluctant hand from the wrist like a boxing champ) Mikey's the big winner
(shaking his head to hide a smirk) What an asshole
Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the big winner
The same  from before approaches the swingers as they are about to leave
There you two are
walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray
Sorry
We got knocked out pretty quickly
(sarcasm
) couple of high rollers like you
Could you believe it
Wait here, 'll get you that martini
Nah,  didn't really want it anyway just wanted to order it
Can  get you something else
mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free
No thanks
Why ruin a perfect night
(condescending) Bring a James Bond for me and my boy Mikey, and if you tell the bartender to go easy on the water
(holds up a half-dollar) this Kennedy has your name on it
Now run along, 'm timing you
The waitress smiles in spite of herself, shakes her head, and walks away
What an asshole
That was money Tell me that wasn't money
That was so demeaning
She smiled , baby
can't believe what an asshole you are
Did she, or did she not smile
She was smiling at what an asshole you are
She was smiling at how money am, baby
Let's go
'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it
Leave
The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails
What are you, nuts
You think she's coming back
know she's coming back
don't think so
Baby, did you hear her
"You shouldn't leave without getting something for free
"  She wants to party, baby
You think so
You gotta give Tee one thing
He's good with the ladies
'm too tired for this
Let's just go
Baby, this is what we came for
We met a beautiful baby and she likes you
She likes you Whatever
We'll see
Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend
We'll both get one
don't care if 'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends
don't know
You gotta get that girl out of your head
It's time to move on
You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat
The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them
That's bullshit
It's not
You're money Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you
It's just that 've been out of the game so long
Trent,  was with her for six years That's before
'm scared
don't know how to talk to them,  don't know
You can't think like that, baby
It's hard,  know
've been there
Not for six years, but  know
You just gotta get back out there
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new
who doesn't know what like
and you gotta wear a jimmy
gotta and then 'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who 'm not even really attracted to
Oh fuck that
You don't have to try and impress anyone
You think  give a shit
You think  sweat that skanky whore waitress
Tee is interrupted by the  who, thank God, barely missed his comment
(recovering, looking at watch) One fifty-nine, Two minutes
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water
Beautiful
What time are you off
(reads nameplate) Christy
Six
Mike can't believe it
Tee is just making it happen
Call a friend and have her meet the three of us at the Landlubber Lounge at 6:01
(Trent throws the half-dollar on her tray) : 15
-   -            15 Trent and Mike are looking at menus
They're smoking at the table because the can
That was so fuckin' money It was like that "Jedi mind" shit
That's what 'm telling you, baby
The babies love that stuff
They don't want all that sensitive shit
You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream
They know what you want What do you think
You think they don't
know
know
They know what you want, believe me
Pretending is just a waste of time
You're gonna take them there eventually anyway
Don't apologize for it
'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect
Respect, my ass
They respect honesty
You see how they dress when they go out
They want to be noticed
You're just showing them it's working
You gotta get off this respect kick, baby
There aint nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party
The    approaches the table
She's cute, but not nearly as hot as Christy
Are you ready to order
Coffee
(points to Trent, who nods) Two coffees
It says "Breakfast Any Time", right
That's right
'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment"
It goes over like a lead balloon
And you
'll have the Blackbeard over easy
'll be back with the coffee
She takes the menus and goes
(genuinely) Nice, baby
should've said Renaissance, right
It went over her head
Baby, you did fine
(disgusted with himself) "Age of Enlightenment"
Shit
Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference
How demeaning
may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones
"
Baby
It's just,  thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino
She would've gotten it, though
You did fine
Don't sweat her
We're meeting our honeys soon
You know Christy's friend is going to be money
hope so
(checks watch) We gotta go soon
Baby, relax
It's just down the hall
She's gotta change
we'll be fine
We didn't do so bad after all
Baby, we're money Mike tries to catch the attention of their waitress, who is passing with a huge platter containing a
Excuse me
We're in a bit of a hurry
Hang on, Voltaire
She passes their table and sets the   in front of the  from the casino who sits alone
said two lox platters
This isn't thirty dollars worth of food

This isn't my first time in Vegas, you know

-   -      16 Christy is at the bar wearing acid-washed jeans with a matching denim top
She's sexy in a pathetic mid-eighties sort of way
She's sitting next to a pretty brunette, , dressed in a similar fashion
There is something bizarre about her appearance
Her hair is tied into long pig-tails with powder blue ribbons
Her makeup job is almost theatrical, with bright pink/red lips
She can't be that out of it, or can she
The girls have already been flanked by a herd of potential The  saunter up to the girls in a smooth, - The girls notice them
The courtiers sense their rejection and part like the Red Sea for the swingers in perfect slow-motion choreography
Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you
Oh, are we late
There are no clocks in this town
Well, no harm done
This is Lisa
'm sorry,  never got your names
'm Mike
(with contempt) and this is my friend "Doubledown Trent"
(working the bit) Stop
(then to the girls) Ladies, don't you double down on an eleven
Always No matter what like splitting aces
Whatever
Hello, Lisa
'm Trent
What a lovely makeup job
Lisa works at the  Grand
(apologetically) 'm a "Dorothy"
(trying to sell her to Mike) Oh
a Dorothy Well
we're not in Kansas anymore
Another lead balloon
Uncomfortable silence
What do you guys do
'm a comedian
More uncomfortable silence
Do you ever perform out here
'd love to see you
No
You should
lot of comics play Vegas
Well, 'm afraid it's not that easy
Why not
There are different circuits
it's hard to explain
you wouldn't understand
Who's your booking agent
(flustered) Oh
You know about booking agents don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet
Well, who represents you back east
Actually, it's funny you
'm actually, uh, between What do you do, Trent
'm a producer
Wow
Oooh
Ahhh
Mike rolls his eyes at how full of shit he is
Listen, 'm not really allowed to drink here
We should go someplace else
How's my place

Fine

They've been drinking whiskey and long-neck Buds, judging by the recyclables
The pairings seems to be Trent/Christy, Mike/Lisa
The cramped compartment is filled with secondary smoke and laughter
No
no
The worst was when  went in for this After-School special and 'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids
see they're all signed in for the same role as me
They were auditioning for the same role as you
Wait
Wait
Listen
So,  check the time and place
'm where 'm supposed to be
call my agent
She says they asked for me specifically
What was the part
Oh
" love you
can't believe you're doing this
Drugs are bad
" Whatever
After-School bullshit
The role is Brother
"Big Brother", "Little Brother"
Wait
Wait
Just "Brother"
So  go in
"Hello
Hi
We loved your guest spot on Baywatch
blah blah blah
" Whatever
So,  start to read, and, Mikey,  was money
prepared for a week
It's a starring role
'm crying
The casting director, she starts crying
No
Yes
Oh my God
Did you get it
Wait
She's crying
finish
hold up my finger like "Wait a second"
They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes
look up and they all start clapping , and now they're all crying
Even the camera guy No
Not the camera guy
'm telling you
So what happened
So,  swear to God this is exactly what he said
The producer says to me
now he's still crying
he says to me that was great, that that was exactly what they were looking for
So give me the fuckin part
Right
that  nailed it
Whatever
Then he says it's just that 'm a little old 'm like "How old is the Brother
"
He's like, he says this with a straight face,  swear to God, he says Eleven " So, what'd you say to him
" Double down "
They all crack up even more
It's like, you looked at my tape
You saw my picture
Why did you call me in
You knew  was twenty-four
What an asshole
believe it
The room dies down
The girls settle into the arms of their men
There's a lot of body language and pheromones, but not a lot of words
How rude of me
haven't given you the tour
She gets up and leads Trent into the sleeping compartment to the rear
The door slaps shut
Mike and Lisa, in all her made-up glory, look into each others eyes

He's smooth
cascade of stuffed animals tumble off the bed with every thrust
Clothes start to peel off
Trent takes a breather
He takes a step to the door
Let me just check on my boy
Don't worry
He's in good hands
Trent cracks the door and peers through
The light is dim, but he can make out that they're starting to neck
He closes the door, satisfied
(coyly) What a good friend
can use a friend like you
(she beckons him back to bed) : 20
'  -   -                       20 What seemed like necking is actually Lisa and Mike huddled tight having an intimate conversation
(reassuring) 'm sure she'll call
Six years is a long time
You don't just break it off cleanly after six years
know, but she did
She's with someone else now
Already
You poor thing
It won't last
Why not
It's a rebound
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from Six years
Beat
Can  check my messages
have a calling card
Sure,  guess
The phone's in the back
Mike gets up and approaches the door
Sorry, it's just that
understand
Mike lightly knocks on the door
Trent
(knock knock) Tee
The door cracks
Sorry, man,  need
Trent pokes a  through the door
No, man
need to use the phone
What
gotta use the phone
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow
Please, Tee
have to use the phone
Sorry, man
Hold on
The door closes
(to Lisa) hope 'm not interrupting anything
They weren't in there that long
Lisa reassuringly shakes her head
Beat
Christy walks out wearing only Trent's sharkskin jacket as a robe
Trent follows with a towel wrapped around his waist
Trent glares at Mike as they pass
Daggers
(apologizing to Christy as she exits) 've got a calling card, there's no charge to your phone

(to Lisa) The poor thing
Six years
And she's with someone else
The poor thing
'll make some coffee
Trent is not happy
: 23
'  -   -             23 Mike is on the phone
(synthesized voice) She didn't call
Disappointment pulls at Mike's brow
: 24
'  -   -                       24 The girls clean up the bottles and ashtrays
The coffee is brewing
The shades are up
It's officially morning
Trent's chin is in his hand
He radiates the blue tinge of glandular congestion
He'll have no part of any of this
He's so sweet
He really said that
believe it too
He really just wants her to be happy
He is so sweet
Mike enters
The girls immediately stop their chatter and look at him in anticipation
Mike shakes his head "no"
The girls walk to embrace him in consolation
Awwww
Trent just shakes his head
He'll have no part of any of this

The speeding car is dwarfed by the expansive badlands

'  -   -                            26 She asked me what  was thinking about
What should  have done
Lie
You didn't have to get into it, baby
Sorry about interrupting
Don't worry about me, baby
just wanted you to have a good time
Christy was nice
didn't even like her, to be honest
She was hot
She really didn't do it for me, baby
How'd you like Dorothy
don't know
The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on
Does that makes me some kind of fag
No, baby
You're money
She didn't like me, anyway
She thought you were money
don't think so
heard them talking
They both thought you were money
Yeah, a good friend
Baby, you take your self out of the game
You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip
just don't think she liked me in that way
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you
Michelle went for you, right
That was different
How
was younger
It was college
You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like
You screw chicks you have no business being with
They're young, they don't know any better
That's just plain silly
Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else
But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad
It's no good, man
You gotta get out there
The ladies want to love you, baby
just need some time
Why
So you can beat yourself up
Sitting around in that stuffy apartment
It's just plain bad for you, man
It's depressing
You've come so far
Remember the first week
After she told you
You couldn't even eat
Don't remind me
You just sat around drinking orange juice
Now look at you
Look how far you've come in just a few months
You got that part in that movie
a day Whatever
It's work
You're doing what you love
What's she doing
Selling scrap metal
(smiles) See
And what does this guy she's with do
He drives a carriage
What
(smiling) hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something
Please
And you're sweating him You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey
hear she's getting real fat
Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight
Trust me, Mikey, you're better off
Trent cranks some Frank
"You Make Me Feel So Young"
Mike is finally, genuinely, smiling
He turns down the music enough to talk
'm gonna try
'm really gonna try
Trent just smiles and cranks Frank back up 27

Rob wears a Yale sweatshirt
Mike wears one from Queens College
Mets cap shades his eyes
Neither have shaved and, odds are, neither showered
They each carry a loose nine blade and putter as they wander to their lie
don't think 'm gonna take it
's a gig
mean,  need the money
You're an actor
Find the Zen in the role
It's definitely a step back for me
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town
There's just something about being "Goofy"
Any other Disney character would be fine
There's just this stigma associated with the character
What do you want
You're tall
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents
still haven't told them  didn't get the pilot
You tested over a month ago
'm sure they figured it out by now
It's like "Hi, Mom
'm not going to be starring in that sit-com and, oh by the way, 'm Goofy
Send more money
" They split up and both over-chip the green miserably
: 29
-      -           29 Mike and Rob putt
Haven't you noticed  didn't mention Michelle once today
didn't want to say anything
Why
don't know
It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter
What
Like, you didn't want to jinx it
Kinda
don't talk about her that much
Oh no
didn't mention her once today
Well, until now
Tend the pin
Mike pulls out the flag for Rob's putt
He misses
The only reason  mentioned her at all is to say that 'm not going to talk about her anymore
thought you'd appreciate that
do
Good for you, man
've decided to get out there
(re: the ball) Go ahead
Play it out
Rob putts the "gimme"
He misses by an inch
'm not making any more excuses for myself
Rob taps it in
He tends the pin or Mike, who misses
Good to hear, Mikey
Mike putts again, and misses
You want to hit the town tonight
shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight
What do you have
Pluto call back
Sure
Kick me when 'm down
Mike plunks it in
Count 'em up
The two of them count and recount as they revisualize each shot in their head
Throughout the process they count under their breath and point to different parts of the fairway and green
The two of them revolve, point, and mumble for an absurdly long amount of time until finally
How many strokes
don't know
Eight or Nine
'll give you an eight
(writes score) What'd you get
An eight
Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole
This is turning into quite a rivalry
Rob points to the far-off crowd of a dozen Waiting to tee off
You better replace the pin, Chi-Chi
The natives look restless
: 30
'  -   -             30 First of all,  is a guy , and a tough guy at that
He is wearing an
Kings home jersey
His sweater bears the sacred number "99"
Sue is lounging in front of the  in army surplus khaki cutoffs and untied Doc Martin boots
Sue brushes back a shock of straight, greasy, dirty blonde hair as not to obscure his view of the screen
His face glows with the reflection of the   game on the set
Sue and  are locked in a heavily contested battle of motor reflexes
Nothing moves but their eyes, thumbs, and mouths
Bitch
You little bitch
Chelios to Roenick
looks on
He is more captivated with the simulated sporting event than the Clippers game on the  across the room
Electric guitars blaze over the stereo
The room, like the guys, could use a spring cleaning
Pizza boxes, beer bottles, and full, full ashtrays
You can taste the smoke
You little bitch
Hey Sue
Gretsky's on his ass again
Because he's a bitch
That's so bullshit
This is so bullshit
You should play another team
The Kings are bitches in this game
Hey, man
took the Kings to the Cup against the computer They're a finesse team
They're a bitch team
Roenick Fuck That is so bullshit Give it up, Sue
The
Sue picks it up and balances it on his shoulder as he plays
Hello
(re: game) Shit (back to phone) Yeah
The elevator doesn't work
(he lets the phone drop
Then to Mike) It's Pink Dot
Buzz him in - hit nine
Mike picks up the phone off the matted shag carpet
He pushes "9", listens, then hangs up
wish the game still had fights so could bitch-slap Wayne
This version doesn't have fighting
No
Doesn't that suck
What
That was the best part of the old game
don't know
guess kids were hitting each other or something
You could make their heads bleed, though
Yeah
If you hit them hard their heads bleed all over the ice and their legs convulse
No
Yeah
It's kinda money, actually
Make someone bleed
No, man, we're in the play-offs
'll make Gretsky bleed, the little bitch
The   knocks on the door
Pause it
(Trent pauses the game) Give me the money
'll get it
While Sue gives Mike the money, Trent  the game and checks Gretsky into the boards, leaving him writhing in a pool of red pixels
You bitch Sue dives onto Trent
They wrestle a little too rambunctiously for indoors
Trent pulls the hockey sweater over Sue's head and starts wailing on his back
Mike crosses
The  follows him down a shallow hallway to the door
He unlocks it
delivery man of eastern-hemispheric decent is out of breath from four flights of stairs
He hands Mike a twelve-pack of Bud cans and three packs of Marlboro reds
He can , but  , the chaos ensuing in the living room
: 31
'   -                              31 Trent and Sue are flushed
They pause long enough to torment Mike
(feigning homosexuality) Is he cute Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail
(following suit) Is he brown : 32
'  -                                  32 Mike forces an apologetic smile
He is embarrassed
The delivery man doesn't seem to understand any of this
Mike, out of guilt, hands him a four dollar tip
This he seems to understand
He smiles and leaves
Mike crosses back to the main room
You guys are such assholes
(continuing the gag) Aww
He got away
(untangling himself from Trent) Gimme my reds
've been jonesing for an hour
Mike throws him a pack of smokes, which he unravels with surgical precision
Cans of beer are tossed around and cracked
What time's this party tonight
It starts at eight
which means no one will get there 'til ten
So, what
Eleven
& Midnight
'm gonna bring and old friend who just moved out here
Who
Rob
Yeah
You met him once
(approvingly) Yeah
He's a "rounder"
What's he do
He's trying to be an actor
What a surprise
How novel

-  -         33 and  walk down the dirty deserted alleyway
Mike is wearing baggy slacks, Doc Martin shoes, and an oversized Eisenhower-cut jacket with a vertical stripe inset
The collar is large and pointy, but definitely not seventies
His ensemble has more of an early sixties vibe
Rob hasn't been at it quite as long
He's wearing worn-in Levies over worn-in boots and, the nineties standby, an untucked flannel
Mike walks with purpose
He intermittently tries to pull open locked steel doors along the alley
Rob looks confused
So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten
To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven
Oh
(beat) Where is this place
(pulling handle) It's one of these
For some reason, cool bars in
have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front
That doesn't sound too good for business
(pull) It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing
It's kinda cool
It's like you're in on some kind of secret
You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it
The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there
You have to have someone come before
There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons
It's kinda like Judaism
Sounds more like Aids
That's probably a more appropriate analogy
At this point they come upon an unmarked   , which Mike successfully pulls open to reveal
34
" " -   -                           34 smoke-filled, windowless, black-walled room
There are several round padded booths lining the walls
The place is packed, and the funk standard "Brick House" throbs over the as the two guys serpentine to the mirrored bar at the far end of the room
Enshrined in its center is a framed photograph of  smiling in approval as he presides over the evening's activities
Mike proudly points out the photo to Rob
Kinda money, huh
(smiling) Classy
Mike catches the attention of a cute female
'll get a Dewars rocks
(looks to Rob) Bud
Dewars on the rocks and a Bud, please
She goes
can't get over how cute the girls in this city are
know
It's like the opposite of inbreeding
The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool
Darwinism at its best
've been around here six months and still can't get over it
It's like, every day see a beautiful woman
'm not used to that
'm used to seeing a beautiful woman,  don't know, once a week
can't handle it
Wait till summer
swear, you can't leave the house
It hurts
It physically hurts
can't wait till  actually get to touch one of them
Ah, there's the rub
There's the rub
The bartender serves them their drinks

Mike turns to see

He wears a black leather blazer over a black turtleneck
Just look up "cool" in the dictionary

Charles
What's up, man
Oh
You know
Did you, um, did you get that pilot
No, man
know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me
It wasn't that funny anyway
piece of shit
Listen, Charles, this is my friend Rob from Back East
Shake
Hi
My pleasure
Charles and me went to network on this pilot together
just tested for one
yeah, a month ago
Oh, 'm sorry
How'd your folks take it
haven't heard an official "no" yet
You haven't told then, huh
No
still haven't told my folks  didn't get " Deepspace 9 "
You'd think they'd'a figured it out by now, but Mom keeps asking
and boy does it hurt when they ask
don't even tell them about anything 'm close on anymore
not until you book it
and even then
you might get cut out
'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy"
Hey, man
At least it's Disney
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont
They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies

No, baby
got a better one
You gotta admit the steadycam shot in Goodfellas " was the money
through the basement of that restaurant
the Copa, in New York
through the kitchen
heard it took four days to light for that shot
Four days
don't know about four days
That's what  heard
Maybe
mean you gotta hide all the lights
It looked money
Not as money as the shot from Reservoir Dogs Which one
In the beginning
When they're walking in slow motion
How can you compare them
Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese
He's derivative You gotta admit, it looked money
heard they made that whole movie for ten grand What's the big deal
Everyone steals from everyone

The music, the conversations, all movement, everything
Everyone in the room  at them standing in the doorway

The music starts back up and everyone returns to their conversations
The swingers weave their way through the crowd to

The shamelessly paw at the top shelf brands
Who threw this party, anyway
Damned if  know
Beats me
came with you With that, the three of them peel off to work the room
What's that guy's name
Sue Sue His dad was big Johnny Cash fan
Oh, like that song
" Boy Named Sue"
think that's why he's such a bad cat
Him
He's a mean dude
've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb
He knocked out his teeth

He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom

He's a nice guy though

They scout the terrain
There are so many beautiful women here
It's unbelievable
got to at least try once
You're a better man than  am, Charlie Brown
No,  just promised myself 'd give it a try
gotta get out there sooner or later
Go for it, man
Mike spots a pair of beautiful  in black
They're wearing stretch bell-bottoms and tops that expose their mid- drifts
The seventies never looked so good
(indicating the ladies) 'm going in
Will you be my wing-man
'll be your winger
They make the approach
With a great deal of effort, Mike catches their attention
Good evening, ladies
only to be interrupted by the party  to check another entrance
Beat
The party  and the blondes redirect their attention to Mike
He is a little put-off but, God love him, he gets back in there
How are you ladies doing this evening
What do you drive
'm sorry
What kind of car do you drive
Oh
a Cavalier
The blondes immediately enter back into their conversation as if they were never approached
Mike and Rob exchange defeated glances
One more try
It's red
: 42
-  -                         42 Trent and Sue are trying to look like they're not paying attention to the group of ladies they saw across the room
Is she looking at me, baby
No
Now
No
Is she looking now
No She's not looking at you
She hasn't looked at you once Will you stop asking if
Wait, she just looked
See, baby
Mike and Rob walk up to Trent and Sue
How you guys doing
It's on
Which one
(indicated the group of girls with a subtle head move) Minnie Pearl
Mike and Rob   at the girls like a deer in the headlights
a big no-no
The one in the hat
She's cute
Trent and Sue react with frustrated disappointment
What are you doing
What
You looked right at her, baby
She didn't notice
Yes she did
Damn
Now  gotta go in early
'm sorry
Don't sweat it, baby

of the conversation
The   reaches its violent crescendo as the girl looks into her purse
Trent winks to the boys
Smooth
She comes up with a pen and writes our her phone number
Trent crosses back as the music dies away
Using his body as a shield so the girl can't see, but so his boys can, he rips up and drops the number as he approaches them
Was  money
don't know
It was kind of a dick move if you ask me
Why, baby
What'd  do wrong
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up
She didn't see
That doesn't matter
That was pretty cold, dude
What was cold about it
The door opens
The party  to look, then
She offered me her number
What should have said
"No"
That would've hurt her feelings
This way she feels like the winner
Trent smiles and waves to her across the room
She coyly waves back and makes a "phone sign" with her hand
Trent nods and smiles
Tee can't roll with that, she's "business class"
"Business class"

can't believe you

don't know what to tell you
mean, does it have to be " Goofy "
was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud
Trent and Sue are involved in a different conversation
They are observing two   at another cocktail table
The girls are wearing short plaid skirts with black stockings pulled up to midthigh
It's the "catholic-school-girl-gone- bad" look
The girls are a little too touchy-feely with each other, suggesting a certain sexual open-mindedness

Baby,  know it is
It's a black diamond trail
double diamond
but it's worth the risk
True or false:  It's worth the risk
True
As they get up to leave

They cross to the ladies
Mike's
The girls seem at first cold, the receptive
Trent and Sue join their table and share some laughs
Mike half-heartedly looks on
He is obviously not happy with where he stands on the bell-curve of masculinity
Mike, looking for any kind of escape, crosses to the bar

(to himself) can't even get this guy to notice me
cute  sitting at the bar chuckles at his comment
Mike is at first self-conscious, then pushes ahead
You like laughing at the misery of others
'm sorry,  couldn't help it
Let me make it up to you
She raises her finger and the bartender immediately approaches
What can  get you
'll have a Dewars on the rocks
He goes to fix it
Thanks
've seen you somewhere
Where have seen you
You ever go to the Kelbo's
On Pico
maybe
Monday nights
host an open mike
You're a comedian
Yeah
What's that like
(trying to bluff, not an ounce of sarcasm) Well, you know, it's tough
lot of traveling
lot of hotels
but, you know, it's a dream
and the money's really good
think  might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas
(politely interrupting) know
Starbucks
served you an espresso at Starbucks
Are you sure
Maybe
Yes
Remember
You asked me for an application
introduced you to the manager
(trying to pull out of the dive) Oh, yeah
Boy, that must've been a while ago
'd say about two weeks
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever
(smiling at him) You better pay the man
Mike notices the bartender, who has been waiting patiently with the drink
(fumbling with the money) Oh
Sorry
She chuckles
He pays and throws down a two-dollar tip apologetically
(tactical retreat) Well, thank you
Nikki
Thank you, Nikki
He walks away kicking himself
He is interrupted by Trent and Sue, who both hold up cocktail napkins with scribbles
We got the digits, baby
What a surprise
What's wrong
saw you talking to that beautiful blonde baby
She was cute
She didn't like me
made a fool of myself
Baby, don't talk that way, baby
You are so money, and you don't even know it
That's what  keep trying to tell him
(to Mike) You're so money, you don't even know
Please, don't mess with me right now
We're not messing with you
we're not
You're like this big beer with claws and fangs
and big fuckin' teeth
and teeth
And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner
shivering
And you're just looking at your claws like "How do  kill this bunny
"
You're just poking at it
Yeah
You're just gently batting it around
and the rabbit's all scared
and you got big claws and fangs
and fangs
and you're like " don't know what to do
How do  kill this bunny
"
you're like a big bear
Beat
Mike smiles
You're not just, like, fucking with me
No, baby
honestly
you're money you're so fuckin mmmoney Now go over there and get those digits
You're money
(pulling him aside, dead serious) Now when you talk to her,  don't want you to be the guy in the -13 movie that everyone's pulling for
want you to be the guy in the rated  movie who you're not sure if you like
Mike nods and, energized by the bombardment, crosses back to the bar and right into the fray
Trent and Sue rejoin the other swingers
Swinger's
of Mike decisively engaging her in conversation
She laughs
Out comes the pen and the cocktail napkin
Bingo
Mike crosses back to the swingers' table and, using his body to shield Nikki's view, pretends to rip the napkin
This breaks the guys up
Mike sits down and, after admiring the blotchy numerals, delicately folds the napkin and pockets it
See, baby
It's not that hard

Everyone reacts favorably to this area code
How long do  wait to call
day
Tomorrow
No
Tomorrow, then a day
Yeah
So, two days
Yeah
guess you could call it that
Definitely
Two days
That's the industry standard
(to Sue
shop talk) used to wait two days
Now everyone waits two days
Three days is kinda money now, don't you think
Yeah
But two's enough not to look anxious
Yeah, but three days is kinda the money
(interrupting sarcastically) Why don't  just wait three weeks and tell her  was cleaning out my wallet and found her number
then ask where you met her
Yeah, 'll tell her  don't remember and then 'll ask what she looks like
(pause) Then 'll ask if we fucked
How's that, Tee
Is that "the money"
The guys laugh
Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party
Don't listen to him
You call whenever it feels right to you
How long are you guys gonna wait to call your honeys
& Six days
: 51
-   -   -                51 The swingers are leaving through the back door
The doorway is congested with another group of guys who are entering
with a goatee brushes by Sue
Watch where you're going, asshole
What'd you say, bitch
said watch where you're going, bitch
That's it
Now they're squaring off in the empty parking lot
All the bald guy's boys fall in behind him
All the swingers fall in behind Sue
The swingers are not happy with Sue at all
The two cliques contrast each other in every way
The bald guys all have facial hair and multiple pierced extremities with the odd neck-tattoo thrown in for good measure
Baggy denim and boots
Pot leaves and Pumas
Long, heavy key chains
Vintage 1994 whiteboy faux-gansta
They do, however, look big and mean next to our boys
The early sixties style sweater jackets and blazers over button down shirts and tapered slacks don't quite have the same fear factor, but the boys do look classy
The word "bitch" is growled out by the two of them a half dozen more times until
Sue pulls a  out of his belt
Everyone is
Especially the swingers
Now what, bitch
Now who's the bitch, bitch
The bald guys     and slowly back up to their ride
Hey, man
'm the bitch
'm your bitch, okay
We're just gonna leave
Okay
'm the bitch
'm such a bitch, can't even begin to tell you
They jump in the car and
Sue belts the gun and stands tall like Clint
What the fuck
What an asshole
Didn't you see "Boys in the Hood"
Now one of us is gonna get shot
He's a bitch
He ain't gonna do nothing
You asshole
You dick
What'd you want me to do
Back down
He called me a bitch
We kept our rep
Fuck rep, 've got a callback tomorrow
Charles leaves
Yeah,  gotta be up early tomorrow
Rob leaves, shaken up
You asshole
Why are you carrying a gun
What
In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg
Hey, man, you're not from here
You don't know how it is grew up in Anaheim
Whatever
Things are different here
It's not like New York, Mikey
Yeah
Here it's easier to avoid trouble
It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day
Nobody's mugging you on no subway
In New York the trouble finds you
Out here you gotta go look for it
People get carjacked
Oh, who would jack your fuckin -car
He's right, Sue
You don't need no gat
Listen
Just because  was the only one with the balls to stand up to them
Oh yeah, like "Cypress Hill" was gonna do anything
You live in such a fantasy world
What about you, Mikey
At least  got balls
You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago
It was six months, and she didn't dump
Whatever
You're like a whining little woman
Big deal
You got a fuckin' number
Whoopee
You'll fuck it up
Sue
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here
Did you fuck once
Shut up, Sue
know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it
Your like a little whiney bitch
Sue
No, Trent
He's right
Mike walks to his car
Mikey
It's too late
He's leaving
Sue starts to open his mouth
Don't even talk to me

That's it
No expectations

There's no turning back

Could you just call me when you get in
'll be up for awhile, and 'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all

Mike
don't think this is working out
think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other
It's not you, really
It's me
It's only been six months
(Live, in person
she picks up the line) Mike
Nikki
Great
Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along

Wow,  guess you were home

Pick up, Mikey
Are you home
He is
He is sitting in the same corner, smoking, with a two day beard
He is surrounded by full ashtrays and empty Tropicana containers
Billie Holiday's "Maybe you'll Be There" draws to a close on the
player
(Trent's voice) guess you're not home
Why don't you come out tonight, baby
We haven't seen you for two days
We're gonna play hockey at Sue's house til ten thirty then we're either going to the Lava Lounge for Sinatra night, or the Derby for the Royal Crown
We might also check out Swing Night at the Viper
If we're not there we'll be at the Three of Clubs
So come meet up with us
We'll see you there, gorgeous

(Rob's voice) Mikey
It's Rob
Pick up, buddy
His shoulders slack with
It's not Her
(Rob's voice) 'm downstairs
Buzz me in
know you're home
Your lights are on and your car's here
Come on, buddy
Open up
Mike picks up the phone, pushes "9", and hangs up
He lights a cigarette
knock at the door
Mike opens it, and Rob walks in with a brown bag
He surveys the scene
He's seen this before
He moves some laundry off an armchair and sits down
He pulls a pepperoni and a loaf of seminola out of the bag
He hands Mike a pint of orange juice
Thanks, man
No problem, buddy
You eat anything today
Mike shakes his head, "no"
Yesterday
Mike shakes his head again
You haven't been drinking, have you
No
Just
Rob cuts into the pepperoni with his Swiss army knife
Mike drinks his juice
Sorry about what happened at the Dresden
had no idea
Don't sweat it
Now  got an
gun story
You should hear the way  tell to the guys back home
He had an Uzi
Mike half-smiles
Beat
You want to talk about it
What's the point
It's been two days
You should call that girl Nikki
Mike grabs his head in pain
Uuuuugh
Oh boy
'm such an asshole
She wasn't your type anyway
Beat
think 'm gonna move Back East
Well, that's dumb
What's dumb about it
Well, you're doing so well
How am  doing well
host an open mike and  played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie
Big fuckin' deal
'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians
How good am  doing
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy
They turned you down
They went for someone with more theme park experience
woulda killed for that job
Mike lets it sink in
See, it's all how you look at it
If your life sucks, then mine is God awful
mean,  moved out here partially because  saw how well you were doing
You got in the union, you got an agent
thought if you could make it, maybe could too
didn't make it
That's your problem, man
You can't see what you've got, only what you've lost
Those guys are right
You are "money"
Mike smiles, then
(starting to cry) Then why won't she call
Because you left, man
She's got her own world to deal with in New York
She was a sweet girl but fuck her
You gotta move on
You gotta let go of the past
The future is so beautiful
Every day is so sunny out here
It's like Manifest Destiny man
mean, we made it
What's past is prologue
That which does not kill us makes us stronger
All that shit
You'll get over it
How did you get over it
mean how long 'til it stopped hurting
Sometimes is still hurts
You know how it is, man
mean, each day you think about it less and less
And then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling
It's kinda weird
You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long
And the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile
We see that Mike has been   at Rob's pepperoni and semolina as he listens intently
You miss the pain
for the same reason you miss her
You lived with it so long
Wow
(finishing the loaf) You wanna grab a bite
(smiling) Sure
He helps Mike up
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight
(smiling) You always know the right thing to say

We ran into them that night at Roscoe's

All the baldies howl and slap hands at something funny Tee said
But most important, man, 'm sorry about what  said

Real cute
She glows
There's something fresh about her
She's dressed nice, but different
She definitely is not a regular
She throws Mike a half-smile, then looks away
He looks away

He shakes his head to himself
No

When he gets to her she has reverted back to human form
Hi
Hi
'm Mike
Hi, Mike
'm Lorraine
Like the quiche
(smiles) Yes
Like the quiche
like quiche
thought real men don't like quiche
My reputation seems to have preceded me
Why
You're not a real man
Not lately
: Trent points the conversation out to Sue from across the room
Trent and Sue's
of Mike and Lorraine having an unforced, enjoyable conversation
It's on it's on
: : so  thought, what the hell, they make movies in
, not in Michigan, so moved here
Just like that
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah
How was it hard
Well,  left someone very special behind
Tell me about it
You too
Yeah
(lights up) thought  was going to die
It's been six months and 'm just starting to get over it
Oh, God
That's two more than me
Tell me it gets better
(smiles) It does
How
Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single
(coyly) Like what
What what
What advantages
You said there are advantages to being single
want to know what the advantages are
(playing along) Well
You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you
: Trent and Sue are watching from across the room
It's on
it's definitely on
: What else
What else
Let's see
You have complete freedom
To do what
don't know
To grow, to go out
Whatever you want
Anything
Anything
Like if  meet a handsome young man and wanted to ask him to dance
can do that
Uh, if the guy wants to
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with
Yes
mean, no
mean, maybe he would find her,  mean you attractive
Maybe he doesn't like to dance
Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either
Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of
(smirk) No
Maybe that's not the case
Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to
Mike
She gets up
She's beautiful
She is beautiful
Will you dance with me
She's in great shape,  and look how classy her vintage dress looks
vision from the forties
She's too good for this place
She belongs on the nose of a -52
What can he say, but
Sure  will
He awkwardly leads her to the unusually empty dance floor
They
It's a slow song and they boringly rock back and forth
Mike is self-conscious, but her touch
Oh her touch
: Trent and Sue watching in disbelief
It is on it is so on
: The couple's dance is cut short as there were only a few bars left of the slow ballad
Mike smiles politely in relief and begins to lead Lorraine off the floor
She pulls him back
He's not getting off that easy
She wants a whole song
He politely holds her, poised for another slow number
They're alone on the floor
Much to Mike's dismay, the song begins with a This cues every hep cat in the Derby that the big one's coming
They all flood the floor for the last dance of the night
Mike pleadingly shakes his head at Lorraine
It's too fast
Her eyes narrow as her grip tightens
No sympathy here
The band breaks into the full-tilt swing number and the dance floor writhes around them
They stand motionless for what seems like an eternity
Gut check
Fuck it
Sink or swim
Mike grabs her like a man grabs a woman
It's just a simple six-count swing step, but they're in perfect harmony
Mike and Lorraine look into each others eyes
It's on, baby
As Mike's courage grows, the moves start to flow
spin at first
Then a double twirl
It's not long before he's throwing her through combinations that stand out even among the pros
: Trent and Sue, mouths agape
: Mike is whipping her smoothly through violent-looking combinations without a trace of hesitation, and, boy, can she follow
The set ends with a flourishing crescendo
They're frozen in a final dip, panting through a glaze of clean sweat
Mike and Lorraine smile and look into each other's eyes
The smile slowly disappears
Will they kiss
They're close
Really close
Lips almost touching
Mike tries to muster-up the courage, but it's been so long
He can't do it
He lets her up
The floor clears
Exhausted dancers push past them
Forget it
The moment's gone
What the hell
They had a great time
What's the hurry

Me too
would love to see you again sometime
'll be around
That's not good enough
want to make plans to see you
Let me get a pen out of my car

Mike hands her a business card
(looking at it) You're a comedian
Yeah
And an actor
'll have to come see you sometime
If and when  get a real gig 'll call you
It's not going to well
When  lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport
got off the plane in
six months ago and all got to show for it is a tan
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career
Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into
Neither is acting
Not if you're serious about it
(She writes her number on the card
) Can  have one of these
Why, you like the duck with the cigar
(hands her a card) Yeah
Nice touch
It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right
Good eye
Not one club owner got it
They all ask me why  got Donald Duck on my card

Can  give you a ride to your car
Nah

Which one
The red piece of shit over there
well, it suits you

Mike leans in and slowly gives her the sweetest, softest, most innocent kiss
He backs up
She's got that goofy look as she unlocks her club and starts the car
Bye
She drives off
He watches her go

Yeah
What kind of things
You know, us

It doesn't matter
think about you every day
Really

Why didn't you call

Do you know how hard it's been not to call you
pick up the phone every night
Whenever that commercial comes on
the Micheline commercial
Yeah, with the baby in the tire
One time  started to cry right in front of Pierre
Pierre

Pierre

Listen  don't want to talk about him
That's a whole other headache

He clicks to the

(click) Mike  , cutting Michelle off mid-sentence
Hi
Sorry about that
You didn't have to get off the other line

That's okay

Mike holds his palm over the receiver and looks at the answering machine
Beat
(to answering machine) Do you realize that 've been waiting for that call for six months and  cut her off
(synthesized voice) You're money, baby
Mike smiles
Back to Lorraine
of Mike through his window as he looks down onto Franklin avenue and talks on the phone
Hi, Lorraine
Thanks for holding on
Listen, Mike
You really didn't have to get off the line
just wanted to ask you one thing
know  shouldn't have called,  mean, my friends said  should wait two days
Oh God,  probably sound like such a schoolgirl
It's just that it's tonight only
mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "The Room"
Do you know where that is
It's impossible to find if you've never been there
don't understand why none of the clubs in Hollywood have signs
Anyway, 'm so bad at this, if you're not busy  thought you might
Mike smiles as the    from the window and backwards down Franklin Avenue in a reverse of the first shot of the movie
The soundtrack kicks in with Sinatra's "Here's To The Losers"
Here's to those who love not too wisely, no, not too wisely, but too well
To the girl who sighs with envy when she hears that wedding bell
To the guy who'd throw a party if he knew someone to call
Here's to the losers
Bless them all
We rise and pass the glowing Hollywood sign
It's still a full moon
Here's to those who drink their dinners when that lady doesn't show
To the girls who wait for kisses underneath that mistletoe
To the lonely summer lovers when the leaves begin to fall
Here's to the losers
Bless them all
Past the blinking red beacon of the Capital Records building
Hey Tom, Dick and Harry
Come in out of the rain
Those torches you carry
Must be drowned in champagne
Up and over Hollywood Boulevard
High above the city
Here's the last toast of the evening
Here's to those who still believe
All the losers will be winners
All the givers shall receive
Here's to trouble-free tomorrows
May your sorrows all be small
Here's to the losers
Bless them all
It's all just a pool of beautiful golden light
