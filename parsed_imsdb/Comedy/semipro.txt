Oh, that's nice -- Ha Ha Ha
Good one, Commish

sign says
Jackie pulls into the lot and parks
He looks in the mirror one last time
Your Mom would be proud of you today
- Not-quite-Rich guys surround a large oak table
is by far the youngest of the owners
33
'm sure each of you have heard the rumors
And 'm here to tell you, the rumors are true
The will be merging with the  at the end of this season
(to an old guy) ,
(fists to the ceiling) Our league is sold
And the agreed to all of our financial demands
Now Jackie turns inward, more quietly intense
This is, without question, the greatest moment of his life
(to himself) You're a real owner
You're in the Four of our teams will be absorbed into the  family, the rest of you will terminate operations
Exactly
You know it
(now hearing) 'm sorry, wait, what
The Nuggets, The Nets, The Spurs and the Pacers will play in the next year
The rest of us will dissolve
Dissolve
Dissolve, like, how
How do  dissolve into the
The winning owners look at each other, not sure how to handle Jackie
What's happening
34
'm sorry Jackie
We all know how
emotional you get
We waited until the very last second to tell you
Jackie pounds the table
No
He kicks over his chair
We know you're upset, Jackie
But you'll be very well compensated
#1 Everyone's agreed to a very large sum
don't want a sum
want my team
(to the losing owners) 'mon you guys, you're not going to just sit here and take the money, are you
They are
(to winning owners) What do the Spurs have that we don't
huge fan base
brand new stadium
solid economic growth package, including strong tax incentives
Oh, c'mon, that's
The  is taking four teams, Jackie, there's nothing  can do
Jackie goes quiet, thinking
An epic idea hits him
The best four teams should go
35
What
Forget the huge fan base, the stadiums, the economic
(a little lost) Growing
package
inventions
#1 (correcting him) Economic growth pack-- (to the room) The four teams with the best records should merge
#2 He's right
#1 Yeah, that's the fairest way
These four teams  have the best records
Flint's only won six games all year
So far
The season isn't over
#2 Yeah, maybe we should finish the season first
This plan sounds like a lot of fun, but it's too late
The commissioner, me, has already decided
#2 Actually, the terms of a merger can only be approved by a league mandate
That's right
What he said
36
#1 move that we vote on the terms of the merger
- The team sits around the parking lot, sitting on their duffle bags, dejected
Jackie is having a team meeting
'mon you guys, let's try to stay psyched
This is a chance to become a real  franchise
There's no way we can make it to fourth place
It's mathematically impossible
ran the numbers
All we have to do is win about eighty-two percent of our remaining games
Eighty-two percent
Isn't that a lot
Oh, c'mon
We just gotta start hitting our threes
(guys look around, unsure) Listen,  know this seems like bad news, but it doesn't have to be
This is a big road trip for us
We've just got to start playing solid Flint basketball
- don't know
We suck, man
(re: The slap) Sorry
,
We do not suck, okay
We just have to want it
37
Pumped, Jackie walks around with his hands on his hips
What do you think, Monix
All eyes turn on the grumpy one
think we suck
Well
See, now there's some team unity
Now let's load up the jet
:     has the words '
' Spray- painted in graffiti letters with a palm tree next to it
(as they load up) Now we've got a special treat
You know  take care of my family
Today, the Jet is catered
had Downtown's Mom pack us some hot dish
Ms
Quincy's hot dish
Sweet
- The guys load up
It's so packed it's ridiculous
Everyone tries to stuff their gear somewhere and sit down
Jackie carries a big pot of hot dish, accidentally burning Scootsie's back
- Ah, watch the hot dish, man
Sorry Scootsie
Hey Jackie, there's some dude out there, wants to talk to you
: Out the window, we can see , the full court shot winner, holding his   and looking into the bus
He's still shirtless, with a star-spangled headband
- Jackie and Dukes are next to the bus, discussing the check
38
tried Jackie
They won't take it
They said it's 'symbolic
' What does symbolic mean
don't know
But they said  need a real check
don't know what your bank is talking about
That is a real check
signed it myself
It's written in glitter, dude
Can't you just give me, like, a regular sized one
don't get it
People are usually able to cash these
Maybe you should try another bank
(trying to wrap it up) If you run into any more trouble, let me know
Okay Jackie, thanks man
Any time, congratulations
Jackie turns away from Dukes and exhales, walking back to the bus

, Jackie reaches up into a special bin and takes out some beef jerky, then yells out the window
(out the window at a car) --- , Pan back to see the whole team crammed into tiny seats
Vakidis has his knees pointing straight toward the ceiling
Twiggy Munson is reading '70's pornography
Clarence is sewing a new name onto his jersey
The rest of the guys are eating their hot dish
So, Clarence, what's in this 'hot dish' anyway
My Mom cooked your ass a whole Damn meal, why you gotta go asking what's in it
It's a compliment
It's good
If it's good, then it's good
Why do you gotta know what's in it
What's in hot dish
Hot dish is in hot dish, asshole
and  look over the seat, facing them
Hey Monix, what were the Celtics like
They were fast
- Fast
No one's faster than me should be on the Celtics
(pointing to his mind) Fast up here
40
You're supposed to be Mr
Smartball
Why'd you get bounced
Well, you have to be able to jump too
- Hey, let us see that ring again
Not right now, okay Twiggy
Isn't it a little embarrassing wearing that thing everyday
Embarrassing
You call yourself a Celtic
You sat through every single playoff game
You didn't see action once
And now you walk around wearing the ice like you're Bill Russel
Well you ain't
Oh, you're just jealous
- Yeah, Monix played solid minutes, for lots of teams
He's played in the , that's more than you can say
Whatever
At least  never sat on the bench and then called myself a champion
You didn't do shit for that Celtic team
If  was Dave Cowens, 'd yank that ring right off your neck
That was a pretty heated exchange
Monix looks like he's got something to say, but he doesn't
Clarence has the last word
He doesn't wear it on his finger because he knows he didn't earn it
He didn't even play
41
Monix looks out the window
#1 - 'The Jet' is parked outside the arena
(
0
) We're just a few minutes away from game one of the Tropic's 6 game road trip
With talk of an merger hitting the league, there's a new electricity surrounding tonight's game
'   - Jackie addresses his team before tip off
Alright
Now, a lot of people out there are writing us off
lot people are saying things like 'Jackie Moon is an offensive liability
' They're saying 'Flint's turnovers led to sixty fast break points per game
' (Making this up) They're saying 'Bee Bee's retarded brother is so retarded that his eyes look too big,
Like a French Bulldog
No one said that, man
(trying to motivate) Yes they did
And we're going to use it as motivation, okay ' ' - '
:
1)   sprints across the floor tries to get two f eet planted in the lane
It's not even close, The ref whistles a blocking foul
42
, '
Where's the charge, Father Pat
Both feet weren't planted
, That's it, you're out
What
What did  say
Jackie takes a ball and drop kicks it,   high up into the rafters
:  111  92
2)  drives the lane, fast and smart --  no-look pass hits Scootsie Double-Day in the shoulder
- :  90  70
3)  and   jog back on Defense
ain't guarding my guy anymore
Why not
He's too'Damn sweaty, man
(re: his wet uniform) Look at me
Gross
Well,  ain't guarding him
Monix notices this discussion
Quit talking and play defense
The sweaty guy backs in on Clarence, posting up top
44
5) Jackie Moon plays great defense, rejecting a shot
Monix grabs the ball and dribbles on a fast break
Clarence trails, in perfect position
Right on
'm open baby
Try a behind-the-back
Monix delivers a nice two handed bounce pass, but Clarence isn't ready for anything fundamentally sound -- The ball hits him in the nuts
Ah, shit
:  105  91
- Angle on a big hotel with fancy lights -- but then we pan to reveal:  shitty motel
The 'Jet' is parked at the cheap place
- Two twin beds in a crap-box motel room
Monix has the phone to his ear, but it just keeps ringing
He'd leave a message for Lynn, but answering machines haven't been invented yet
He hangs up, looks in the mirror, and now takes his Championship ring necklace off
He looks at the ring in his hand
And shoves it into his duffle bag
(
) brought us some ice
Monix is startled
Clarence, his roommate for the night, enters
Ice
What for
don't know, it's free
Clarence takes some ice, pops it in his mouth and starts crunching
Want some
45
No thanks
Now   enters, yet another player in the small room
That Root Beer machine took my fucking change, man
White people are assholes
Monix ignores this
Laying back, he focuses on the : are playing
Their trapping defense is a thing of beauty
Clarence walks over and flicks the channels, until he stops at 'Love American Style
' You turned off the Celtics
don't watch people play basketball
They watch me
With that, Clarence pulls out a  and lights it
(re: the marijuana) What the Hell is that
(as he inhales) It's a fucking Egg-McMuffin
Monix opens the window, clearing the pot smoke out of his face
the bathroom, having just taken a shower
He's wearing a very small robe
This is now the fourth player who's sleeping in this tiny room
Why don't you shower in your room
My wife is using it
'll be crashing with you guys tonight
() Ice
Awesome
(as he eats ice, re: ) Love American Style
Turn it up
46
Jackie doesn't say a word about the pot
Instead he keeps his eyes glued to the , then reaches for the joint and Jackie, have you ever even slept with your wife
() What
Are you kidding
Try, like, every weekend
She's so hot
Sounds like a great arrangement
You guys need to wake up
Quit living like it's the 1950's, man
Live it up
(showing off) Hey Clarence, let's have some of that smoke, bro
'm pretty sure we have a game tomorrow
(as he inhales) This stuff won't affect you
It's premium
Jackie finishes inhaling, then holds it out for Monix
He stares at the joint, then around the room at his teammates
Well, if this is really going to be my life,  might as well be stoned like everyone else
Well said
Monix takes the stupid joint
The instant Monix inhales he What the Hell is this
What do you mean
47
It's harsh
Take that back
Take what back
His Mom grows it
Yeah, in the yard
Your Mom grew this
It's sweet grass
Well, 'm finished, thanks
What's wrong, my Mom's weed ain't good enough for you
guess not
'mon man, have some respect for his Mom's weed
That's it,  ain't sleeping in the same bed as this motherfucker
-    6 - Television cameras are being set up
camera man cleans the lens
Jackie studies the cameras, mesmerized by the idea of television
He speaks with the Amigo's manager
You want all the fans to sit on one side of the stadium
48
Yeah, just move all those people over to this side
() See, the  cameras are going to face this way, right
Well, if we fill the seats on that side, we'll look sold out
Actually, that's not a bad idea
,   : Both teams are warming up
Clarence now has a new name on his Jersey
There are so many words, there is barely space for a number
It's a mess
(re: Jersey, new name) Check it out
sewed it on the bus
- (struggling to read it) What's it say
Jumping Johnny Johnson
The asshole, , wanders over near the Tropics side of the court
Yo, Granny Yarn Barn, how's the needle point going
Kiss my ass, Petrelli
(re: the Jersey name) Hey man,  think you spelled 'Flint sucks balls' wrong
() This guy's the next Betsy Ross
Aren't you Clarence
The guys laugh
walks up, defending his teammate
No one calls him Clarence
His name -- () What's your name
49
Jumping Johnny Johnson
His name's Jumping Johnny Johnson
(nose to nose) You got that
Jackie hurries over
Alright, break it up
(to his team) Everyone huddle up
Where is he walking to
() Fuck it
Listen up, we're on National  tonight
And you all know what that means: The league needs a good clean game
Oh, that's a bunch of dog shit
Hey
You guys want to merge or not
Because the fastest way to screw this up is to start punching people in the face while the commissioner is at home, watching the game with his kids
Children are very impressionable
Their minds are not yet soiled by the cruel realities of this world
What
No punching
Behind the huddle,
Both teams turn to watch this strange thing
The Amigos manager leads the herd, Jackie helps out, directing them across to the other side

50
'  - The optical illusion has worked
The game does indeed look crowded
The game is in full swing

) This sold out crowd is loving this one, the Amigos up by twenty-six here in the second
Monix drains a nice jumper, but out of nowhere, Petrelli, the guy we hate, throws a hard shoulder, knocking Monix to the floor
That's a moving pick Father Pat
'mon
Play on
Monix can't believe it
Petrelli taunts Monix
What's wrong Monix, cat got your 'nads
Monix faces off
() Not with the cameras
(miming the commish') He's watching
Monix looks around and thinks
What about commercials

Commercials, what about commercials
Jackie thinks about this, then nods 'good idea

Off camera, Monix delivers a secret punch to Patrelli's spleen
- Jackie runs the half time talk, standing in front of the chalk board
Okay, solid first half guys, but we're going to have to make some -- Monix interrupts Jackie, pissed
He addresses the team, stepping in front of Jackie Moon
--This is bullshit guys
They're kicking our ass in basketball and they're kicking our ass during the commercials, too
Does anybody here understand the concept of the pick and roll
Because they're going to keep double teaming at the top of the key until somebody rotates the Damn ball
Yeah
'mon guys
Rotate the ball
Monix looks at this group and gets even madder
53
Does anyone in this room have any pride
Don't you realize, this is thelast four weeks of basketball anyus are ever going to play
Is thishow we're really going togo out
You'd think we'd want toend ourcareers battling, hustling after every loose ball
Boxing out under the boards
Setting picks for our teammates
But we haven't done shit out there
Twiggy Munson and Scootsie Double-Day hang their heads
We're a bunch of selfish assholes -- And 've got news for you, we aren't going to finish in fourth, we're going to finish dead last
Monix paces in front of the guys, a man possessed
One day, you're going to look back on your life
And you're going to look back on this time
And you're going to realize
Monix is staring right at Clarence
And Clarence is actually listening
You're going to realize you never even played basketball
moment of silence after the intensity
Monix waddles to the door
Now, you guys have fun out there in the second half
If anyone needs me, 'll be in the training room, draining my knee
Monix limps off, everyone's head is hanging low
- He's right
54
Of course he's right
But what the Hell are we supposed to do about it
We don't even have plays
'  - We're back in Flint
Jackie is back in his office, speaking on the phone
(into phone) Dukes
don't make the rules
If they can't cash it, maybe you'll have to go out of state
() would if  could, but if  give you another check, that would be two checks
That would be $20,000, not ten
What are you trying to pull here
(the other line rings) 've got to take this other call Dukes
Bye
-- (hits a button, answering) Flint Tropics hot line
Oh hey Commish
- On the floor, instead of a basketball court, the stadium holds an ice-rink
'Welcome to the Flint Ice Capades' sign is being removed
The entire basketball team is on their hands and knees This is a lot of work
Clarence hits his thumb with a hammer
Why do we have to put the court together
- guess the Ice Capades sold out
Yeah, kids love that stuff
Although,  find the wild-life masks realistic and frightening
Monix should be here helping us
55
(
) Guys
The guys look up to find Jackie
He does not look happy
The commissioner just called
What's wrong
looks like we've got ourselves a situation
We've got some new 'terms and conditions' for this merger deal
- What'd he say
Basically, we've got to average at least 2,000 fans per home game for the rest of the year
2,000 people
Every home game
He said the  will only take a franchise that has fans
Shit
Winning is going to be hard
But getting 2,000 people to watch is going to be impossible
Let's try and stay positive
My Mother always believed Flint was a town of destiny
And  believe that
Now, 've already started work on a huge idea to promote us
What kind of huge idea
- Jackie's place is empty
Monix is drinking alone, totally blasted in the middle of the day
He hangs his head, barely able to order
56
Two more Johnny Walkers
And another pack of Kools
You could use some fresh air, Monix
You want to take a nap in the back of my truck
() Just the drinks and the smokes, alright
() Do you have any idea where Lynn is these days
She asked me to tell you to quit going to her house
Well, tell her that's just fine with me
Okay
Sorry man
(
) Monix
: Clarence
Well, well, well, look who it is
(to the bartender) Brian, 'd like you to meet Jumping Johnny Downtown Funky stuff Boner- time finger-blast Fag-erton
(to the bartender) Johnny for short
(to Brian, re: Monix) Two coffees
So, what brings you to the The Kremlin
Listen,  know you and  haven't always been the best of buddies
57
But 've been thinking about what you said the other night
This is gonna be our last chance
If 'm ever going to get into the , it's going to be with the Tropics
hate to break it to you, Clarence, but the Tropics will never play in the
So maybe we won't
But like you said,  don't want to look back on this with any regrets
know what you think of me
But 'm willing to put our differences aside
'm telling you right now, 'll do whatever it takes to win
You mean, like, pass
(with a smile) would consider passing, yes
Sorry kid
Even if  wanted to play harder, this knee won't let me
'm not just talking about you playing point guard
'm talking about you teaching us
Monix could not be less interested
Monix, you know more about basketball than any man who's ever set foot in Flint
Monix drinks, not into it
All 'm saying is, instead of getting so pissed off at us all the time, why not just show us what the Hell you're talking about
Coach us a little
mean, we can't get any worse
58
And why should  give a shit about the Tropics
know you
You've got all that basketball shit stored up in your head
know you're dying to pass it down to somebody
Why not us
What about Jackie
He's the coach
Jackie's got his hands full, trying to sell tickets
He's obsessed

Monix ignores Clarence

So that's the way it's going to be
Monix doesn't answer, he just drinks
Clarence gets the hint and walks out
: '  - Monix looks like shit, laying on the couch, as if he hasn't moved for days
Apparently he's been drinking and smoking, but not much else
Someone's at the door
:  lets herself in
Monix is so depressed, he is non-plused
Looking good Monix
Thanks
You too
Ms
Quincy told me the Tropics asked you to coach them
60 '  - :
Lynn is draining Monix's knee
It looks painful
know what it takes to be a real team, Lynn
(re: his knee) Stay still
() And that's the reason you won't coach them
It doesn't matter
The truth is, hate basketball right now
Do you really hate basketball
Or do you hate yourself
Why would  hate myself
Well, for one, you cheated on me
You hate me for that
Not me
Lynn just stares at him
Okay, maybe  hate myself a little
You don't wear the ring around your neck anymore
(no response) Where is it
rode the bench through the playoffs, Lynn
Monix, that was greatest moment of your career
And you look back on it like some kind of embarrassment
61
Riding the bench was the greatest moment of my career
You did more than ride the bench, Monix
What else did  do
Every practice, you took your team to the limit
know you did
was the one draining this stupid knee of yours every night
The Celtics were practicing against you, Monix
And when you ran that scout team, you were running Milwaukee's offense better than their first stringers ever could
Lynn continues the business of disposing fluid into the toilet and preparing another syringe
By game time, your team knew where Milwaukee was going to be before their own players did
The Celtics made the right adjustments to win that series
And those adjustments came from you
So,  should be proud of running the scout team
Dave Cowens put that ring in the palm of your hand
And he told you to wear it with pride, because you were a champion
And he meant it too
He was being a nice guy
The bench is the bench
Your whole life, you've bitched about people playing selfish
It takes a team to win, right
62
That's right
But when you're on the team, your effort doesn't count
Is that it
() If you weren't on the Celtics that year, would they have won it
Watch that needle
Answer me
Would they have won
don't know
Yes you do
You know
Monix looks away for a moment
Why are you doing this
What does any of this matter, anyway
What's it matter
You're drinking yourself to death
() God,  wish  hated you as much as you hate yourself
Lynn throws the needle
Monix dodges it
made sacrifices
How many years did  support you
And finally, after all of our blood and sweat and bullshit together, you got there, Monix
You made it, you won an  championship ring
It wasn't just about you, okay
And 'm sick of you acting like you're some kind of joke
You didn't blow it
You're not a fraud
You're not a fake champion
And all the time we spent together, fighting for you to get to that moment, was not a waste
You're a champion, you asshole
() 63
But if you want to drink yourself to death, go ahead
Fuck you
With that, Lynn is gone
Monix stands alone in the bathroom, then checks his knee
: - It's practice
But this isn't basketball, it's The entire team performs a complicated 'intro- dance
' () 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and turn like you mean it -- Bee Bee, Arch that back
Yes
Now, the waterfall
One by one, each dips down like a waterfall
And now a leg kick
Nice leg kick Kong
Those flexible hips are a coach's dream
() Now big finish -- and freeze
And then we start the game after that
Are we going to practice or what
This is practice, okay Clarence
We need to get two thousand people in here
Our intro dance has to blow people's minds
He begins pacing around, more passionate than ever
From now on,  want our afros bigger
And shinier
want our shorts shorter
And tighter
We're going to pull our tube socks up higher than we ever have before
The team seems to be looking off screen
What's wrong
64
: Monix has been watching this whole thing
With Monix on the court, everyone feels kind of stupid
Hey, you're back
Listen, you should probably chalk your hands up for this number
Jackie,  asked Monix to coach us
Coach
Jackie is totally thrown by this
He looks around at the team
Clearly, a decision has been made
What do you mean, coach
(truly hurt) What is this
What's going on
(staring his team down) It's a Mutiny
Jackie
Don't be like that
Hold on a second
Last time checked, we didn't live in Flint, Russia
We live in Flint, America
'm coach until a new one is elected
Don't make us elect Monix, man
(Jackie Moon holds firm) Alright, show of hands
Who wants Monix to step in as player-coach
Everyone feels bad, but they all raise their hands
Please God No
Sorry Jackie
(starting to cry) It's cool
get it
'm a big boy, can handle it
65
Jackie cries harder
Don't take it so hard, Jackie
You're a great owner
We all know that
Woah
Hold on
Did you just say 'great owner
' Yeah
Everyone thinks so
Now, when you said great owner, were you just saying that
Because it's not cool to mess with me about this
We mean it
For real
Monix is just more of an 's and 's kind of guy, that's all
Jackie is emotional
It's a bittersweet moment
He takes off his whistle, then walks over and hands Monix his whistle
(re: The whistle) Here
You may need this
Now he pulls out a bunch of crazy notes on loose paper written in ball point pen
The pages look insane
(handing him papers) And here are some ideas for plays 've jotted down
Just thoughts
Thanks Jackie
(to the team) The way  see it, any team in this league can put together a run
Most of our opponents are all flash
If we play unselfish, fundamental basketball, we can win games
like it
Unselfish, guys
66
Yes
Unselfish
Unselfish meaning tough team defense, full and half court traps, boxing your man out to help the team rebound
() Unselfish means sprinting up the floor on every fast break because you can get a  -- and get your   after the game -- but because if you sprint up the floor you might pull the defense out of position and free a teammate up for a high percentage shot
Wait, so, what's going on with the blow jobs
vote we keep the blow jobs
(raising his hand) All in favor
Everyone raises their hands in favor of blow jobs
Would everyone let the man talk please
Clarence is serious
This shuts everyone up
- The starters have gotten into position, guarded by the scout team, in blue jerseys
The most important work we do on the court is away from the basketball
Monix          , deflating it
This gets everyone's attention
(re: deflated ball) Until you start moving like a real team, you practice without a ball
67
He flings the deflated ball into the bleachers and snaps the knife closed
Alright, Clarence, run the offense
don't get it
Set a pick for somebody
Clarence jogs over and stands next a scout team opponent
Okay, that's kind of a pick, guess
Try standing on the other side of Scootsie's man, so you free him up to cut into the lane
Monix corrects Clarence, moving his body the way he wants him to stand
Widen your stance
Plant your feet
Hands back
Like this
Now Scootsie Set a pick for Jackie
Scootsie cuts across the lane
The team slowly gets i rotating faster
Now Jackie pick Bee Bee's man, and rotate to the rim like this
Everyone move to the open space
And Clarence you swing back out up top
They've completed the play
Monix stands there, smiling
The players look at each other, what's the big deal
You know what that was
What
flash to the high side post with an outside screen and a back door cut
Let's do it again
Ei 8
Hey, how come you don't have to run with us
You're a player, just like the rest of us
'm saving my knee for the games
Coach's decision
Clarence sets a screen for Scootsie and they perform the same basic rotation
(as they run) We're not just rotating, we're clearing out, making space
pass and cut can change defensive match- ups
Creating seams can give us back door looks
Down screens can make a team vulnerable to penetration
Hold on
'm lost
No shit
What's up with all of these fucked up words, man
Yeah, what are we, building some kind of basketball space
ship
You don't have to understand it yet
Just run it again
You heard me --
-  - It's many hours later
- The team is still doing the exact same thing
Nothing in their moves have changed at all
They're exhausted
We've been running this play for a long time, man
69
Yeah, maybe we could try, like, play number two
No
We're running this play
We're running this play until we puke
Basically, we have
Yeah, 'm pretty beat
'Until we puke' is not a figure of speech
We are literally going to puke
What does he mean by 'literally
' think he's talking about vomit
Not cool
Monix, can  talk to you for
a second
No
No talking
Wait
Jackie hangs his head, but then accepts his fate
He runs
(as they run) We need to get in shape fellas
And we need to learn some fundamentals quick
--
They run it again, getting more and more winded
-17 0
want you to be brain dead
Because someday you're going to be too tired, or too nervous to think - -
And when you are, this is the play 'm going to call
The play that your lungs and legs will have memorized
We will be able to run this in our sleep
Clarence tries to gag himself with his fingers
No sticking your fingers down your throat, Clarence,  saw that
You're going to puke
And it's going to be all natural --
: - We pan along a row of toilet stalls
Behind the doors, each player is throwing up
- He crawls across the gym floor, dying
Monix screams down at his deflated body
You're fired
Fuck you
Fuck you
Get up and run
You're going to puke like everybody else
Monix,  need to talk to you
We'll
talk after you puke
71
Jackie can't get up, but he crawls, dying
can't puke Monix
Yes you can
Go
Jackie crawls harder along the hardwood
Monix
You don't understand
've never thrown up in my life
What are you talking about
've never puked
Ever
That makes no sense
Everyone has thrown up before
haven't
swear to God
can eat anything
can drink anything
've been sick, but 've never puked
swear to God
That's bullshit
Keep moving, you're going to puke
don't puke
can't do it
It's the truth
swear on my Mother's grave
At this point, Monix can't help but be intrigued
What about when you were a baby
Babies throw up all the time
My Mom said  never did
swear
She said  was fascinating
No way
72
You can call my Dad
've never puked
When Jackie looks up at Monix, it's clear he is not lying
Isn't that kind of dangerous
What do you mean
What happens if you swallow poison
don't know
ate bad sausage before
But nothing happened
Stand up
Jackie manages to stand up
Have you ever been punched in the Jejunum
don't know
What's a Jejunum
It's part of your small intestine
don't know
doubt-- '    '
: Monix's knowing fist digs deep under Jackie's rib cage
It's the hardest punch ever filmed
' : He stands, beyond pain, empty of any possible air
The blood leaves his face andhis eyesbecome confused, watering strangely
Part of Jackie's brain wants tospeak,buthe feelsunhuman-- his lips separate only slightly
He wanders out of frame
73
-  - , ,    , , ,
, , , (to the sky) Mom
, ' stands in the doorway, watching this
You okay
Jackie is about to speak, but then takes stock of his feelings
There is now an air of tranquility about him
Reborn
He's almost Euphoric
'm beautiful
: - An intense game is underway
The Flint team works hard away from the ball
As the Monix voice over continues, we watch the team move just like in practice
Monix is playing too
Note: The team also looks 'hot
' Clarence plays with an even bigger afro
Jackie Moon sports a large perm, striped tube socks and the whitest thighs you've ever seen
(
) On offense, we share the ball
We look for the easy pass, not the spectacular pass
Jackie rolls off the pick and looks for it
For the first time in this sequence, we see the ball
Clarence has a clear passing lane -- He feeds Jackie for a lay up
74
(
) If a guy's more open than you are, he gets the ball
Instead of celebrating, Clarence hustles back on Defense
The Tropics execute a half court trap
As we watch Monix play, we continue to the voice over from practice
(
0
) On defense, we're going to learn to play together
We're going to use team traps to pressure people into turnovers
On the in bounds, Monix and Jackie Moon trap an opponent
Monix slaps the ball free
He flips to Clarence who fakes; the fast break dunk and dishes to Scootsie
(
0
) Can you believe that
Jumping Johnny Johnson actually passed the ball
(
0
) It was a great pass, too
The other team calls time out
(
) And Jackie Moon has made several great defensive plays down the stretch
tell you, Jackie's not afraid to knock people around in the lane
He's a monster
(
0
) Like a retard in a China shop
twenty-second time out on the floor, Monix huddles them up
(huddling up) Listen up
'll in-bound
Clarence, protect the ball and penetrate if you can
Kick it out to Scootsie or me and everyone crash the boards hard
Looking good, we're thirty seconds away from taking this one home
Let's bring it in
He's right guys
But remember, we want to win, but not by too much
'75
We don't want to win by too much
What the Hell is he talking about
He's worried about the corn dogs
What
If we score a hundred points, everyone gets a free corn dog
There are signs everywhere
'm sorry, Monix, but we don't even have corn dogs
don't give a shit
We're taking it to them
We're up by seven, Monix
Can't we just take it easy
We're talking about a lot of corn dogs here
There could be a riot
don't give a shit about the corn dogs, okay
We play hard every second
We're running the offense
Everyone got that
Everyone nods
(
0
) The Tropics are just one bucket away from the magic number
Listen to this crowd
They know what's at stake:  free corn dog
Monix has the ball in his hands
He in bounds to Clarence
Clarence penetrates and kicks it to Scootsie
Scootsie has an open look
He sizes up a jumper

Shit
- The daiquiri room is crowded with guys
is having a team meeting
asked you up to the Daiquiri room, because this is a private matter
(everyone looks around) As you know,  threw up recently
77
It was the first time in my life
And, well, it's made me feel guess you could say 've got a new clarity in life
(Everyone stares back) Since vomiting on Wednesday, 've been facing my demons
'm not going to be an imposter any more
() And  want you to know,  just mailed out 562 corn dog coupons
() And 'd like to bring somebody special in
Dukes walks in
He is still shirtless
Jackie hands him a duffel bag
In this bag, is ten thousand dollars
No way
Really
Actually, it's twenty three hundred
But 'm going to pay you the rest
The Tropics will not let you down
From now on,  want my conscience clear
Wow
Thanks Jackie
Can  confess something to everyone
It's something 've never told anybody
What is it
You know my song 'Love Me Sexy
' - Everyone knows that song
stole it
No
7 8 It's true
(turns away, dramatic) My Mom wrote it
Three weeks before she died
And  stole it
Even Monix is fascinated by this
Wait, your Mom wrote that
Was she a singer
No, she wrote it on a napkin duped the whole world
'm nothing but a fraud
() It's true, 'm a famous singer
And 've landed the hottest wife in the world
But, to be honest, we usually only sleep together once a year
On  day
Damn
day
That's cold
(ignoring Kong) And even on that day,  don't feel like it's me who's sleeping with her
What does that mean
She married me because of my song, but  didn't write it
So sometimes feel like it's not even me who's with her
(more emotional) Deep down,  feel like it's really my Mom who is making love to her
When  hold Lucy's supple breasts in my hands, they are my Mom's hands
When  eat a pair of edible panties off of her, they are my Mom's teeth
That's pretty weird
79
'm living in a prison, Dukes
Why don't you write a song yourself
Then you wouldn't feel like a fake any more
Oh please
could never write anything as brilliant as 'Love Me Sexy
' (standing tall) Listen to me, Tropics
Today is a new day
am going to be the greatest basketball owner you've ever seen
And we're going to make it to fourth place

It doesn't look like it
Wow
It's true, the ball girls are flashing the crowd with every kick

Fine, you can dance a little bit

Now the  (the league official) steps over
Hey Jackie
Oh, hey Commish
(a little worried) 84
didn't know you were in town this weekend
Listen, my office has been getting your numbers
You claim you've had over two thousand people at every home game this month
(dead pan) That's correct
The commissioner looks around, skeptical
As we scan the stands, it's clear the crowd is still not big enough
Well, we've counted only nine hundred and eighty three here tonight
What, you don't think people go to the bathroom
(Commish isn't buying it) Saturdays can be a little slow
You should have been here the other night, it was
Don't bullshit me, Jackie
The commish waves over a little bald man in a suit carries a brief case and never talks
From now on, Peekskill here will be attending every Tropics home game
You're going to have to get a real crowd here if you want to qualify for the merger
- Jackie Moon is being interviewed on a local talk show
So, the Tropics will be at a size disadvantage against the Americans
How do you intend to match up with their strong inside game
85
Tomorrow, at half time, , Jackie Moon, will wrestle a bear
Oh, well there's something
But, defensively, as a team, do you -- --That's tomorrow
One night only
See Dewie the wrestling bear attack me
He's killed people in public before
Okay, well, that's some half time show

Well, there you have it
Jackie Moon, thanks for stopping by
From channel 5, this is Mick Kenterman, signing off
Good night

As she closes the lid, she notices something
: Monix is standing in the yard
Well, if it isn't the toast of Flint Michigan
Shouldn't you be out signing autographs
Monix doesn't speak
He stares into her eyes for a moment
Will you marry me
86
What
You heard me
Technically, we're still married right now, Monix
You know what  mean
Do
Do you love me
Probably
Then let's do it
For real this time

Shit
know you need me, Monix
The question is, do  need you

Kyle pokes his head out of the screen door
He wears a Flint Jersey with Monix on the back

He's loyal
Dogs are loyal

Monix and Lynn meet eyes
Lynn tries not to smile, trying to be mad
Kyle pulls on some jeans and gets into his truck
Don't fuck with him
It's just rude

He slowly walks toward the bedroom

: His whole body goes numb, his face turns red
We hold on his face until: Monix
() Yes
Still undetected, Kyle settles in to watch the show, still wearing his Monix jersey
Lynn finally looks over and spots Kyle
We can't be sure, but his hand might be in his pants
Lynn can't believe her eyes
(having sex, whispering off to Kyle) Stop that
Stop what
(in pig Latin) Ixne-on-the-erking off-je
Monix finally notices his sex partner is having a conversation
He turns to see Kyle
Woah
What the fuck
Monix, you of dog
What the Hell are you doing
Hey, 'm the victim here
'm allowed to do as  please
This was an honor

What
Monix stands up, wrapping a sheet around him
'm outta here
Oh, c'mon man
Don't be like that
It's all cool
Believe me, this is not all cool
' Monix grabs his shit and walks out of the bedroom
'll call you
Okay
Not you, asshole
He was talking to me
- There's a real buzz in the air
People are pouring into the stadium tonight
Clarence is right outside the locker room, eating a Bit-o-Honey, watching with amazement
Hey is that Coffee Black
'm officer Miller, State Correctional, 'm a big fan, you can call me Jimmy
Nice to meet you
Jackie Moon ordered up a bus full of prisoners
Any idea where we all should sit

Next to a bus load of   from the hospital

We sold out, man
You did good
'm scared of bears, Clarence
What
hate these things
'm freaking out right now
If you're scared of bears, why the Hell are you wrestling one then
Look at this place
We're packed
It was a good idea
Well, don't worry, you'll pin him easy
It'll be fine
You don't understand
don't like bears
'm feeling dizzy
Jackie is seriously petrified
Clarence adjusts the collar of his ref jersey and looks around, worried about his friend
Maybe we should call it off
Look into my eyes
(Clarence does) You're the ref tonight
No matter what happens in there, do not stop the fight, okay
91 These people came to see a show
've got to make it through at least one round
Okay, until you finish the first round,  won't call it
Hey, how bad can three minutes be, right
(
) Are you guys ready
The bear handler is a large frizzy haired woman
don't know, are we ready
Yeah, let's do it
You guys want to give me a safe word
What's a safe word
It's a word for you to yell to the Ref, so he can stop the match
don't need a safe word
Tell you what, if you get injured or you really feel like you're in danger, yell, um,  don't know
Spumoni
Once  get a signal from the ref, 'll come in
What's Spumoni
It's an Italian Gelato, sort of like Almond flavored ice cream
Is it good
don't know, 've never had it
92
It's really good
(Jackie and Clarence nod) Okay, so Spumoni is the safe word then
No,  don't need a safe word, okay
Let's just do this
One round
(nodding to the bell man) The bell has rung
The crowd goes crazy
Clarence assumes his position as ref
Jackie walks slowly toward the bear, frightened
They bear scratches his belly, cute
Jackie immediately quits
(re: The scratching) Okay, fuck this
What
You can't quit already
'm out of here
You can't , all he did was scratch his nuts
Well, too bad, 'm -
Jackie looks around at the angry crowd
You gotta give 'em a show
'mon, the bear seems pretty tired, look at him
It's true, the bear is pretty docile
The bear's indifference gives Jackie a glimmer of confidence
Just test him out a little
Maybe it won't be so bad
Jackie nods, then hops around with his dukes in the air
Now he does a shuffle for the crowd
After dancing a bit, the bear is still motionless

Jackie
Oh, hey Commish
Good game huh
And a packed house too
need to talk to you
And the rest of your team
Alone
- The whole team stands solemnly
96
'm sorry, but even if you beat the Spurs on Friday, we just can't have an  franchise in Flint
What are you saying
It's just not good business
Flint isn't a big enough media market, okay
This stadium is small and, frankly, it needs to be torn down before someone gets hurt
'm sorry but nobody ever thought you guys could ever get this far
Well tough shit
This team did make it this far
Rules are rules
Rules are rules
Until the expansion committee makes new rules
Then those rules are the rules
Everyone looks at each other
Jackie's brain has slipped into a deep trance
He is no longer inside his body
Don't take this personally, Jackie
These other teams have strong markets, new stadiums
It's just not going to happen for you Flint boys
'm sorry
The devastation of what is happening is palpable
Nothing has ever hurt this bad before
know you're going to punch me, Jackie
So let's just get it over with
The commissioner stands brave, eyes closed, chin out
Jackie is too confused and devastated to hit anything
He stumbles out of the room like a zombie
The team follows
The commissioner opens his eyes

Suddenly  darts in and squeezes the commissioner's balls with a kung fu grip
Ah

This can't be happening
They can't just do this, can they
- We can get a lawyer, dude
We can fight this
Can't we
Monix
Monix just looks to the ground, as in 'it's over

Please

Jackie opens his mouth
He tries to speak, but he can't
Are you crying

- The morning sun shines down on the sad town of Flint
Monix walks home in the street
He stops and right in the middle of the road

Lynn pokes her head out of the car
What the fuck are you doing
Oh
Hey Lynn
'  - Monix is on the couch, drunk
He gazes at the  and swigs his beer
Now  walks in

Maybe you could put some pants on and go piss off somebody else
Fine, maybe  will
() Where are my pants

Tell me something, Monix- No
Whatwereyou trying to accomplish thisyear
You never really gave a shitaboutthat  merger, did you
Monix doesn't say anything
The merger, Monix, did you ever care about it
Monix still stays quiet
Tell me, if you didn't care about the merger, what the Hell were you playing for
wanted fourth place
Okay
That was the whole fucking thing
Well, guess what
Fourth place is still sitting there, waiting for you to win it
Monix doesn't look at her
Think about it

Listen up

And we all know that this game doesn't matter anymore, right
Right
Well 've got news for you
This game does matter
It matters because this is the last real basketball game any of us is ever going to play
Ever
The guys nod, solemn
103
Tomorrow night,  say we leave it all out there on the floor
Because there's nothing else for us to save it for
Clarence or no Clarence
or no
Merger or no merger
We decided we are going to win fourth place
And that's what we're going to do
Jackie is moved
The guys look at each other and nod
Over the past five weeks, we've become a team
And that is no small thing
Jackie, have you ever been on a real team before
No sir
How does it feel
It feels pretty good
All your lives, you've dreamed of playing in the
Well, guess what
Tomorrow night, you are
You're playing an  team
And for one night, the world is going to know that you belong
() Look,  tried to pretend like it didn't matter to me if we made it to fourth or not
Monix turns inward, speaking with an emotion that is pure
But the truth is,  want this more than anything 've ever wanted in my whole fucked-up life
() And  think you do too
think you can taste it
Because we earned this
We made this happen
And we're four quarters away from making our dreams come true

What exactly is your motivation
(with a gleam in his eye) We

It's as simple as that
That alone should make people want to show up and root for us
