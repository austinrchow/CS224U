" " Written by John August Based on the novel by Daniel Wallace Final Production Draft This is a Southern story, full of lies and fabrications, but truer for their inclusion
: We're underwater, watching a fat catfish swim along
This is The Beast
(
) There are some fish that cannot be caught
It's not that they're faster or stronger than other fish
They're just touched by something extra
Call it luck
Call it grace
One such fish was The Beast
The Beast's journey takes it past a dangling fish hook, baited with worms
Past a tempting lure, sparkling in the sun
Past a swiping bear claw
The Beast isn't worried
(
) By the time  was born, he was already a legend
He'd taken more hundred- dollar lures than any fish in Alabama
Some said that fish was the ghost of Henry Walls, a thief who'd drowned in that river 60 years before
Others claimed he was a lesser dinosaur, left over from the Cretaceous period
'  -  (1973) ,  3, listens wide-eyed as his father , 40's and handsome, tells the story
In every gesture, Edward is bigger than life, describing each detail with absolute conviction
didn't put any stock into such speculation or superstition
All knew was 'd been trying to catch that fish since  was a boy no bigger than you
(closer) And on the day you were born, that was the day  finally caught him
-  (1977) few years later, and Will sits with the other as Edward continues telling the story to the tribe
Now, 'd tried everything on it: worms, lures, peanut butter, peanut butter-and-cheese
But on that day had a revelation: if that fish was the ghost of a thief, the usual bait wasn't going to work
would have to use something he truly desired
Edward points to his wedding band, glinting in the firelight
(confused) Your finger
Edward slips his ring off
Gold
While the other boys are rapt with attention, Will looks bored
He's heard this story before
tied my ring to the strongest line they made -- strong enough to hold up a bridge, they said, if just for a few minutes -- and  cast upriver
-  (1987) Edward is chatting up Will's pretty  to the homecoming dance
She is enjoying the story, but also the force of Edward's charisma
He's hypnotizing
(') The Beast jumped up and grabbed it before the ring even hit the water
And just as fast, he snapped clean through that line
, now 17 with braces, is fuming and ready to leave
His mother  -- from whom he gets his good looks and practicality -- stands with him at the door
You can see my predicament
My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish
(low but insistent) Make him stop
His mother pats him sympathetically, then adjusts his tie
' What did you do
followed that fish up-river and down-river for three days and three nights, until  finally had him boxed in
Will regards his father with exasperated contempt
With these two hands,  reached in and snatched that fish out of the river
looked him straight in the eye
And  made a remarkable discovery
(  14) -  (1998) , now 28, sits with his gorgeous bride
This is their wedding reception, crowded with their friends and family
They should be joyful, but Will is furious
Edward has the floor, ostensibly for a toast
The room is cozy and drunk
This fish, the Beast
The whole time we were calling it a him, when in fact it was a her
It was fat with eggs, and was going to lay them any day
Over near the doorway, we spot Sandra, just returned from the restrooms
She looks gorgeous
She couldn't be any happier if this were her own wedding
Now,  was in a situation
could gut that fish and get my ring back, but doing so  would be killing the smartest catfish in the Ashton River, soon to be mother of a hundred others
Will can't take any more
Josephine tries to hold him back, but he gets up and leaves
Edward doesn't even notice
Did  want to deprive my soon-to-be- born son the chance to catch a fish like this of his own
This lady fish and , well, we had the same destiny
As he leaves, Will mutters in perfect unison with his father -- We were part of the same equation
Will reaches the door, where his mother intercepts him
Honey, it's still your night
Will can't articulate his anger
He just leaves
Now, you may well ask, since this lady fish wasn't the ghost of a thief, why did it strike so quick on gold when nothing else would attract it
(closer; he holds up his ring) That was the lesson  learned that day, the day my son was born
He focuses his words on Sandra
This story is -- and has always been -- about her more than anyone
Sometimes, the only way to catch an uncatchable woman is to offer her a wedding ring
from the crowd
Edward motions for Sandra to get up here with him
As she crosses, we can see that thirty years of marriage has not lessened their affection for each other
As they kiss, Edward tweaks her chin a special little way
The crowd
Edward toasts the happy couple
Josephine covers well for her absent husband, a smile as warm as summer
Edward downs his champagne in a gulp
14 - We come into the middle of an argument on the sidewalk
Occasional  take notice, especially as it gets more heated
Both men are a little drunk
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son
(disbelieving) am a footnote in that story
am the context for your great adventure
Which never happened
Incidentally
You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day  was born
(shaking his head) Jesus Christ
Friend of yours
Did you help him out of a bind
Come on, Will
Everyone likes that story
No Dad, they don't
do not like the story
Not anymore, not after a thousand times
know all the punchlines, Dad
can tell them as well as you can
(closer) For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom
It revolves around me and my wife
How can you not understand that
long beat, then
(low) Sorry to embarrass you
Will won't let him get the last word
You're embarrassing yourself, Dad
You just don't see it
Edward
Fine
hand to wave, enough of you
He walks away
Will, still fuming with righteous anger
It's then we
(
) After that night,  didn't speak to my father again for three years
() - typically busy day
On hold with the phone cradled under an ear, Will sorts through a bundle of mail dropped on his desk
( ) (without pauses) William Bloom with the Associated Press if  could just
He's put back on hold
Returning to the mail, he finds a hand-addressed envelope
Rips it open
(
) We communicated indirectly  guess
In her letters and Christmas cards, my mother would write for both of them
- At the table, Sandra talks on the phone while Edward fixes a sandwich
(
) When 'd call, Mom would say that Dad was out driving
Or swimming in the pool
Edward takes a seat, starting to eat his sandwich
True to form, we never talked about our not talking
- Sandra stands by the window, watching as
-  [] Edward swims laps in the family pool
He's born to the water
(
) The truth is,  didn't see anything of myself in my father, and  don't think he saw anything of himself in me
We were like strangers who knew each other very well
- Edward stares intently into the water, a lion in wait
(
) In telling the story of my father's life, it's impossible to separate the fact from the fiction, the man from the myth
The best  can do is to tell it the way he told me
We   at the river, where Edward's reflection is caught in the dark water
As the water ripples past, something changes
Sure enough, as we   again, it's a younger  , 20's, staring into the water
He's not just handsome, not just charming
It's as if all the forces of the natural world had conspired to create him
(
) It doesn't always make sense, and most of it never happened
Suddenly, this Edward thrusts both hands into the water, grabbing hold of He brings the catfish up to his face
Looks it right in the eye
beat, then the Beast spits out Edward's gold ring
(
) But that's what kind of story this is
Smiling, Edward takes the ring, then throws the Beast back into the water with a splash
: - Young Dr
Bennett stands between the Wife's legs
She's flustered and sweating, but the doctor has a comforting bedside manner
Now, Mrs
Bloom, 'll need you to give me one good push
On three
One
Suddenly, we hear a  as a slimy mass of human being rockets into the doctor's unprepared hands
Bennett tries to hold tight, but the infant is slippery like a fish
It shoots up into air
The  and the Husband try to grab the baby, but no one can hold it
As the newborn sails upward  , we can see a   on its face
As it falls, the newborn knocks over a tray, which provides it a ramp to slide right out of the room
Everyone races after it
- Bursting through the doors -- Grab that baby
finally scoops up the slippery baby
Everyone lets out a collective sigh of relief
(
) My father's birth would set the pace for his unlikely life
No longer than most men's, but larger
And as strange as his stories got, the endings were always the most surprising of all
-   - () Over the sound of rain, a phone  on a chair
By the tone of the ring, we know we're not in the
-- it has that insistent European sound
As it keeps , we look to see the apartment is mostly empty, just a few half-unpacked boxes
cradle is still in its carton
in the lock
in the hallway
The door swings open to reveal a drenched Will (29) carrying four sacks of groceries, the bottoms collapsing from the rain
His wife Josephine (28) pushes past him to get the phone
Allo oui
Will begins stripping out of his wet clothes, each layer unleashing a new drizzle
He plays it up, trying to get a reaction out of Josephine
(on phone) Yes, he's here
She hands the phone to Will, concerned
It's your mother
Half-stripped, Will takes the phone
This won't be good news
(on phone) Hi
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
As Josephine takes off her rain coat, we see she is very, very pregnant
She listens carefully to Will's side of the conversation, trying to gauge how bad the news is
(') What does Dr
Bennett say
Okay
No, sure, let me talk to him
'll wait
He covers the mouthpiece
Looks over to Josephine
It's bad
It's more than they thought
They're going to stop chemo
You need to go
Probably tonight

'm going with you
You don't have to
(a simple fact) 'm going with you
747 - As the plane continues boarding, a  recites the welcome spiel in French
Will has a window seat in coach
Josephine sits beside him, putting on hand lotion
Taking his hands, she rubs the excess into him
There's an effortless intimacy between them
She can pinpoint what he's feeling before he can
747 /  - Hours later, and the lights are dimmed
Most of the are asleep, including Josephine
Her head is propped against Will's shoulder, her hands tucked under her belly
Will watches her sleep, brushing back her hair
beat, then he notices a   in the next row over
Off the glow of the reading light, the boy is using his hands to cast shadows on the seat back
The kid is pretty good, making a convincing bird, a passable monkey, and finally a dog
We   on the silhouettes
(
, ) So which one's it gonna be
The Monkey in the Barn, the Dog in the Road
Focusing on the final shadow, we
: - come to find Edward making the shapes
Will (6) sits in his pajamas on the floor next to him
The endtable lamp lies between them, its shade off to cast big shadows on the wall
The one about the witch
Your mom says  can't tell you that one anymore
You get nightmares
'm not scared
Edward looks around for a beat, seeing if his wife is in earshot
He then leans in, complicitous
Neither was
At first
Will smiles, excited to hear the forbidden story
This all happened in the swamp outside of Ashton
Kids weren't supposed to go out in the swamp, on account of the snakes and spiders and quicksand that would swallow you up before you could even scream
But there were five of us out there that night: Me, Ruthie, Wilbur Freely, and the Price Brothers, Don and Zacky
Edward holds up his hand, counting the names on his fingers
Not a one of us knew what was in store
As his hand moves past the light, we : flashlight  past
We are
- The night is  and , alive
The moon hangs low, casting long shadows
Five kids walk past in silhouette
Four have flashlights on
The fifth keeps tripping, crashing into   (10)
Zacky, turn your flashlight on
don't got any batteries
Red-headed   is 10
His brother   is 12, and a lot bigger than the others
Then why'd you bring it
don't want to be in the swamp with a witch and no flashlight
, also 10, is the black asthmatic son of a sharecropper
Redheaded  , 8, is happy just to be there
Is it true she got a glass eye
heard she got it from Gypsies
What's a Gypsy
Your momma's a Gypsy
Your momma's a bitch
You shouldn't swear
There's ladies present
Shit
Damn
Screw
(whispering) Turn off your flashlights
She'll see 'em
behind the kids, we find ourselves at the gates of

) Now, it's common knowledge that most towns of a certain size have a witch, if only to eat misbehaving children and the occasional puppy who wanders into her yard
Witches use those bones to cast spells and curses that make the land infertile
We  , and , revealing more of the Gothically creepy house: its broken windows, strangling vines, and eerie gargoyles half-buried in the dirt
Even bats are afraid to fly over it
In the moonlight, the house is especially sinister
Who knows what is lurking in the shadows
(
) Yet of the all the witches in Alabama, there was one who was the most feared
For she had one glass eye, which was said to contain mystical powers
We finally come to the kids, staring in through the gate
hear if you look right at it, you can see how you're gonna die
That's bull-s-h-i-t, that is
She's not even a real witch
You're so sure, why don't you go in and get that eye
heard she keeps it in a box on her nighttable
Edward looks back at the spooky house
Or are you too scared
'll go in right now and get that eye
Then do it
Fine,  will
Fine, you do it
Fine, 'm doing it
He hands Zacky his flashlight, then starts climbing the gate
Edward, don't
She'll make soap out of you
(to Ruthie) That's what she does, she makes soap out of people
Edward drops down on the far side of the gate
Truth be told, Edward is scared, but he forges ahead anyway
Wilbur looks to Ruthie, and they're in complete agreement
They get the hell out of there
Zacky would run too, but Don holds him by the collar
Edward curves around the tall bushes that hide the front door
Anything could jump out of them
He steps on the porch

Catching his breath, Edward reaches the front door
The doorknob is ancient brass, two projections that look like horns
Yet Edward extends his hand, reaching closer and closer before he finally Impossibly fast, the door opens, revealing an   with a patch over her left eye
She looks like she's been dead for years, but too stubborn to lie down
(calm and straightforward) Ma'am, my name is Edward Bloom, and there's some folks'd like to see your eye
- Zacky and Don Price wait for Edward, each moment more convinced he's already dead
But suddenly, he's back at the gate
You get the eye

(dubious) Let's see it
The Old Woman steps out of the shadows behind Edward, flipping up her eye patch
When their flashlight beam hits her left eye, it shines with a hellish glow
We   on Zacky, who is paralyzed by what he sees

Suddenly, the ladder gives way and he falls
Dead
- We   on Don Price

Very much dead
- Don and Zacky both tremble with fear
The latter has tears in his eyes

wasn't old at all
The brothers suddenly bolt
Still standing next to the Old Woman, Edward smiles
'  - Edward helps her back inside
He could leave now, but curiosity gets the better of him
was thinking about death and all
About seeing how you're gonna die
The Old Woman turns to him slightly, still not facing him
mean, on one hand, if dying was all you thought about, it could kind of screw you up
But it could kind of help you, couldn't it
Because you'd know that everything else you can survive
The Old Woman smiles a little, a crooked grin of broken teeth
guess 'm saying, 'd like to know
The Old Woman turns leaning her face right in front of his
And on a silent count of one, two, three -- Edward looks into The Eye
This time we don't cut
Instead, we   Edward as he witnesses his death
He stares transfixed, perplexed and amused
Whatever he sees, it's not as dire as the other boys
His future has something strange in store
Huh
That's how  go
The Old Woman nods
Still a little overwhelmed, Edward turns and leaves
(
) From that moment on,  no longer feared death
And for that,  was as good as immortal
As Edward leaves, the door swings  on its own

- () The front door opens to reveal Will and Josephine on the porch with their bags
to Will's mother Sandra (53), surprised and a little annoyed
How did you get here
We swam

We rented a car

You just didn't

Starting over
Hi, Mom
He leans in and hugs her
She surrenders, squeezing her son tight
Will and his mother are cut from the same cloth -- strong-willed but practical
They've always been close
'm so glad you're here
That hug finished, Sandra pushes past her son to her daughter- in-law
Seeing the size of her belly -- You shouldn't have flown
But
They hug
It's good to see you
You look beautiful
It's not flattery
It's the truth
Thank you
'll bet you need to -- Yes
Down the hall on the right
The door sticks
You have to really pull it
Josephine squeezes past, a smile to her husband -- be nice
Will heads back to the rental car to retrieve luggage
Sandra follows him
Coming down the driveway, we get to see the house for the first time: an older suburban home, three bedrooms, big for the neighborhood, and nicely grown into the lot
are playing on the street
Is that Dr
Bennett's car
He's up with your father
Heading back to the house
How is he
He's impossible
He won't eat
And because he won't eat, he gets weaker
And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat
How much time does he have left
You don't talk about those things
Not yet

He's still the town's best physician

He judges her belly
You're seven months
(impressed) To the day
He leans close to her, whispering in her ear
It's a boy
She smiles, surprised but not doubting
Will looks over -- what did he say
Josephine shakes her head
Back to the main subject
You don't think he looks any worse
No
would say he's the same
And in the silence that follows, a lot is said
It wasn't the upbeat reply Sandra was hoping for
Can  see him
Absolutely
Be good for you to talk to him

Sandra hands Will a squat can of Ensure from the case on the counter
Get him to drink one of these
He won't, but tell him he has to
- Coming out from the kitchen, Will slowly climbs the stairs
They  with every step
The wall is filled with family photos, happier times
Most of the pictures are of Will, starting when he was an infant and ending at his wedding
As he climbs the stairs, we can see him growing up with every step
- crack of sunlight spills around the half-open door at the end of the hallway
Will walks towards it, running a hand along the wallpaper
Almost at the door, he stops for a beat
Gets his breath
Then goes inside
- Edward Bloom, 61, lies asleep on the bed
Although he's not the vibrant man we've seen before, it's not as bad we feared
The illness has been quick, and left him largely intact
There are no
's, no monitors, nothing
Coming up to the bed -- Dad
Edward cracks open an eye, a beat before he focuses
He tries to say something, but no words come out
He looks over at a pitcher on the nightstand
Will pours him a glass of water, helping him hold it to his parched lips
Finished, Edward sets down the glass by himself
very long, tense beat
Will almost speaks again to fill the silence
Finally
You -- (he points) -- are in for a surprise
Am
Having a kid changes everything mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings
Did you do any of that
No, but  hear it's terrible
Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine
You think 'm up for it
You learned from the best
Will doesn't rise to the challenge
beat, then he remembers the can of Ensure
Holds it up
Edward recoils
Just drink half the can
'll tell her you drank the whole thing
Everyone wins
beat, then Edward rolls his eyes
Fine
Will cracks open the can, finding a straw on the nightstand
People needn't worry so much
It's not my time yet
This isn't how go
Really
Truly

The Old Lady by the swamp
She was a witch
No, she was old and probably senile
Maybe schizophrenic
saw my death in that eye
And this is not how it happens
So how does it happen
Surprise ending
Wouldn't want to ruin it for you
Edward slurps down as much of the Ensure as he can stand, then pushes the can away
He swallows with difficulty
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when  came out of this coffee shop near the office
Okay
And every day  gave him a quarter
Every day
Then  got sick and was out for a couple of weeks
And when went back there, you know what he said
What did he say
You owe me three-fifty

When did you ever work in an office
There's a lot you don't know about me
You're right
Edward gives a wry smile
He walked into that
Your mother was worried we wouldn't talk again
And look at us
We're talking fine
We're storytellers, both of us
speak mine out, you write yours down
Same thing
Will won't commit to Edward's assessment
Dad, 'm hoping we can talk about some things while 'm here
You mean, while 'm here
'd just like to know the true versions of things

Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool
If you wanted to you could
will
You know where the chemicals are
used to do it when you were gone, remember
used to do it a lot
He didn't mean for that to sound so pointed
Taking the half- empty Ensure, Will gets up to go
He's at the door when
was never much for being at home, Will
It's too confining
And this, here
Being stuck in bed
Dying is the worst thing that ever happened to me
He smiles at his joke
thought you weren't dying
said this isn't how  go
The last part is much more unusual
Trust me on that
- Shutting the door behind himself, Will drinks the rest of the Ensure himself
Edward was right
It tastes horrible
Heading for the stairs, Will walks past an open door
As he leaves frame, we   to look inside

Outside, buzzards squabble over the remains of the giant's feast: broken barrels, bones picked clean
In his most serious voice, Edward calls out: Hello

Because 'm not much for pain, really
Edward closes his eyes, hands at his side, ready to be eaten
Karl just stares at him, not sure what to do
After a beat, Edward opens his eyes a tiny bit, just to see what the giant is doing
Relieved to see he's not licking his chops -- Look,  can't go back
'm a human sacrifice
If  go back, everyone will think 'm a coward
And 'd rather be dinner than a coward
Karl sits down with a , dejected
Here, start with my hand
It'll be an appetizer
Reaching up, Edward shoves his hand into Karl's mouth
But the giant spits it back out
don't want to eat you
don't want to eat anybody
It's just  get so hungry
'm too big
And that's the sad truth
Karl is less a monster than a freak -- a giant man, but in the end, just a man
Edward takes a seat beside him
Did you ever think maybe you're not too big
Maybe this town's just too small
mean, look at it
Circling behind them, we look down at Ashton -- a tiny town in a tiny valley
Hardly two stories in the whole place
Now 've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em
Really
Wouldn't lie to you
And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets
You can eat a lot, can't you
can
So why are you wasting your time in a small town
You're a big man
You should be in the big city
Karl smiles, but then it fades
certain sad suspicion -- You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you
That's why they sent you here
What's your name, Giant
Karl
Mine's Edward
And truthfully,  do want you to leave, Karl
But  want to leave with you
(closer) You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition
can't see staying here a day longer
You don't like it
love every square inch of it
But can feel the edges closing in on me
man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this
(beat) So what do you say
Join me
Karl thinks a moment
Then -- Okay
Okay
They shake on it
Now first, we gotta get you ready for the city
- , Karl cuts his hair with hedge clippers, while Edward cuts up a surplus army tent to make him a shirt
- Spirits buoyed by the high school  , all the good  of Ashton are gathered to see off Edward and Karl
There's a few tears amid the familiar faces
(loudly, for the crowd) Edward Bloom, first son of Ashton, it's with a heavy heart we see you go
But take with you this Key to the City, and know that any time you want to come back, all our doors are open to you
Edward ducks a bit so the Mayor can put the key around his neck
The crowd
And with that, Edward and Karl start walking, waving as they go
Only  , smoking on the corner, isn't sad to see Edward go
He crushes his cigarette under his heel
He wishes he could crush Edward
Many of the townfolk come onto the street to hug Edward or shake his hand
(
) That afternoon as  left Ashton, everyone seemed to have advice
Find yourself a nice girl
Don't trust anyone in Kentucky
Watch your pride, Edward Bloom
(
) But there was one person whose counsel held above all others
As the crowd parts, he finds himself face to face with The ruckus slows and quiets, as if a strange spell has been cast
She motions for Edward to lean down, so she can whisper something to him
Although we're  , we can't hear her voice
(
) She said that the biggest fish in the river gets that way by never being caught
The advice only succeeds in confusing Edward
(to the Old Woman) Okay
Thanks
Edward and Karl keep walking
The Old Woman shuffles off, somehow knowing her advice will go unheeded
What did she say
Beats me
- We   from the road to reveal Edward and Karl walking out of Ashton
Each wears a backpack with all his earthly possessions
(
) There were two roads out of Ashton, a new one which was paved, and an older one that wasn't
People didn't use the old road anymore, and it had developed the reputation of being haunted
Edward and Karl come to a bend, where the paved road veers left and an overgrown dirt road runs straight
The old road is blocked with signs and warnings of danger
(
) Since  had no intention of ever returning to Ashton, this seemed as good a time as any to find out what lay down that old road
Karl looks at the dirt road, wary
You know anyone's who's taken it
That poet, Norther Winslow did
He was going to Paris, France
He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again
(beat) Tell you what
You take the other way and 'll cut through here
Meet you on the far side
little paranoid
You're not trying to run away
Just to be sure, you can take my pack
Karl perks up, even though it means more for him to carry
- The road is overgrown, but not altogether creepy
The sun is still shining, and the birds still
Spinning the Key to the City, Edward , because it's a day meant for whistling
- The road has narrowed to a rough path
Spikes of sunlight break through the thick canopy, catching particles in the air
Still, Edward
Coming around a bend, his   as he sees thick, thorny vines growing across the path
He stops
For the first time, he realizes the birds have stopped singing
The forest is dead quiet
He looks back the way he came
It's tempting to go back
It would be easier to go back
But Edward presses on
He carefully steps through the thorns
His trouser legs catch on the barbs
We can hear the fabric
scratched and sweaty Edward waves off various flying at him, finally whipping off his hat to swat at them
Just then a  crow swoops down and grabs the hat right out of his hands
You stupid sonofa
He stops his swearing, but grabs a rock and throws it
The stone ricochets off a tree and into a '
The swarm roars out
Edward high-tails it, each step still precarious
-  [] Edward is bruised, battered and bee-stung
half-broken sign lies in the road
Edward picks it up
Reads it: Sure enough, up ahead he sees the path is overgrown with thick cobwebs, heavy from the rain
(
) There comes a point where a reasonable man will swallow his pride and admit he's made a terrible mistake
The truth is,  was never a reasonable man
Edward tosses the sign and forges ahead, into the spiderwebs
And what  recalled of Sunday School was that the more difficult something became, the more rewarding it was in the end
/   - Edward emerges from the forest, brushing the last cobwebs off and shaking the spiders from his shirt
One is stuck in his sleeve, and he has to dance to get it out
Even then, he still keeps twitching, convinced another one is left behind
At his feet, the gravel road has returned, smooth and dusty and comforting
Ahead lies a tiny one-street town -- smaller even than Ashton -- with powerlines emerging from the woods to feed it
Dangling from the line above he sees two dozen pairs of shoes, their laces tied together
He passes a sign that reads "Welcome To Spectre
" - It's a main street with stores on each side: Cole's Pharmacy, Talbot's Five and Dime, Al's Country Store
Everything is old, but this isn't a ghost town
In fact, there's a group of about 20  spilling out to see Edward approach
Most are smiling
There are even a few tears of joy
What's more, all of these people are barefoot
' Friend
forty-year old man named  comes out of the seed store to greet Edward
Friendly but a little drunk, he's the closest thing the town has to a mayor
He's carrying a clipboard
Welcome to ya
What's your name
Edward Bloom
Beamen checks the clipboard
Not finding the name, he flips forward a few pages
Still looking
Bloom like a flower
Yes
Oh
Here
Right here
Edward Bloom
We weren't expecting you yet
Still confused
You were expecting me
Not yet
helpful woman named  chimes in: You must have taken a shortcut
did
It nearly killed me
Mmm-hmm
Life'll do that to you
And truthfully, the long way is easier, but it's longer
Much longer
And you're here now, and that's what matters
Beamen's daughter  (8) hides behind her father, peering around to look at the handsome stranger
What is this place
The town of Spectre
Best kept secret in Alabama
Says here you're from Ashton, right
Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow
The poet
What ever happened to him
He's still here
Let me buy you a drink
'll tell you all about it
Hell, 'll have him tell you
No
've gotta meet somebody
'm already running late
He didn't mean it as a joke, but for some reason, everyone's laughing
Son,  already told you
You're early
'  - Sitting at the kitchen table, Edward takes a second slice of apple pie
He and Beamen are joined by   (30), who fancies himself a cultured artist, though he's never left the state
Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate
It truly is
Young Jenny is stealthily untying the laces on Edward's shoes
Everything here tastes better
Even the water is sweet
Never gets too hot, too cold, too humid
At night the wind goes through the trees and you'd swear there was a whole symphony out there, playing just for you
Suddenly, Jenny   Edward's shoes
She races for the door
Hey
He chases after her
/   - As she runs, Jenny ties Edward's laces together
Reaching the edge of town, she tosses the shoes up and around the power line -- a perfect throw
There's no way he's ever getting them down
The gathered citizens of Spectre  for Edward, who is confused and overwhelmed
The women hug him
Men shake his hand
Still focused on his shoes
Wait
need those
There is no softer ground than town
That rhymes
He is our poet laureate
The townsfolk continue to congratulate Edward
(
) Sometimes in a dream, you'll visit places that seem instantly familiar, filled with friends you've never met
- Edward sits with Norther Winslow
The fireflies are out
Thousands of them
(
) man might travel his entire life and never find a place so inviting
My journey had scarcely begun, and had arrived
Norther hands him his noteboook
've been working on this poem for 12 years
Really
There's a lot of expectation
don't want to disappoint my fans
beat
It's only three lines long
Norther grabs his notebook back
This is why you don't show work in progress
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris
can't imagine any place better than here
You're a poet
You oughta be able to
And maybe if you'd seen more, you could
Norther doesn't answer
Just goes back to his notebook
- By the light of the full moon, Edward soaks his feet in the water, trying to make sense of it all
The Key to the City dangles around his neck
He stares at himself in the reflection
He smiles
It's then that a  emerges at the far side of the river
No telling where she came from -- she must have been swimming underwater
We never see her face
She stands in the river with her bare back to Edward, squeezing the water out of her golden hair, oblivious to his presence
Edward is breathless
It's the first woman he's seen in her natural state, and he doesn't dare move lest he frighten her away
Then he sees the snake
It's a cottonmouth, has to be
It leaves a break in the water, its small reptilian head aiming for her flesh
There's no decision to be made
On pure instinct, Edward dives in
He swims as hard as can, just as it's about to strike
The woman dives back underwater, understandably terrified that a man is coming at her
No, it's okay
got it
got the snake
As the splashing subsides, Edward looks at what he holds in his hands
Which isn't a snake at all, but rather a common stick
And a non-threatening one at that
While Edward ponders his mistake, he looks around to discover that the Girl in the River is gone
He never even saw her face
Wait
'm sorry
Hello
Edward keeps expecting her to surface, somewhere, but she never does
He stands alone in the river, wondering what tricks his eyes are playing on him
-  - '  (
) There's leeches in there
Edward looks to the bank, where young Jenny Hill is watching him
Did you see that woman
What did she look like
Well, she
uh
Was she nekkid
Embarrassed to admit it
Yeah
(matter-of-fact) It's not a woman, it's a fish
No one ever catches her
Given the day he's had so far, Edward isn't inclined to follow up on the issue
He starts to wade back to the bank
(') Fish looks diff'rent to diff'rent people
My daddy said it looked like the coon dog he had when he was kid, back from the dead
Edward climbs up onto the shore, completely drenched
He pulls up his pant legs to reveal three shiny leeches clinging to his skin
Shoot
He starts to work pulling them off
- Edward and Jenny walk back
How old are you
Eighteen
'm eight
That means when 'm eighteen, you'll be 28
And when 'm 28, you'll only be 38
(a little wary) You're pretty good at arithmetic
And when 'm 38, you'll be 48
And that's not much difference at all
Eager to get off this subject
Sure is a lot now, though, huh
- As Edward and Jenny approach Main Street, they find "downtown" has been transformed
Lanterns and streamers hang on cables across the street, and a small stage has been built at one end to hold
The whole town is there in celebration of its newest citizen, Edward Bloom
Before he can protest, two  have grabbed him by the arms, pulling him in to dance with them
The resulting dance number seems both choreographed and complete chaos
From  to ' , everyone wants to dance with Edward, who finds himself tossed around like a stick caught in a whirlpool
Still, he's having a blast
Jenny grabs both his hands, and they spin wildly
Beamen plucks his  daughter away to dance with her
Then Mildred cuts in to dance with Edward
It's hard to hear over the
Jenny thinks you're quite a catch
We all do
(not hearing) What
said you're quite a catch
Edward stops dancing
beat, then he heads for the edge of the crowd
Beamen is there, with Jenny on his shoulders
have to leave
Tonight
Why
This town is everything a man could ask for
And if  were to end up here, 'd consider myself lucky
But the fact is, 'm not ready to end up anywhere
No one's ever left
How are you gonna make it without your shoes
suspect it will hurt a lot
And with that, Edward walks down Main Street
The townspeople stop dancing, disbelieving, some shaking their heads
Poor Edward Bloom's gone crazy
(calling after him) You won't find a better place
don't expect to
Jenny runs to him
She'd tackle him if she could
Promise me you'll come back
promise
Someday
When 'm really supposed to
It's not good enough, but it will have to do
Edward keeps walking
- : Edward negotiates the thorns in his bare feet
It's horrible
Almost unendurable
And then it gets worse
The trees ahead are moving
At first, it just seems to be the wind blowing the branches, but as we hear the wood and , there's no mistaking it: they're trying to block him
Snake-like   shoot out of the ground, grabbing for his ankles
He leaps up, kicking off one tree trunk to grab another one's branches
He swings off, lands and rolls
Now all the trees are moving to block him, their dark shapes towering over him in the flashes of
(
) As difficult as it was to reach Spectre,  was fated to get there eventually
After all, no man can avoid reaching the end of his life
As he ducks under branches, the chain holding the Key to the City gets caught
He's almost strangled, but the chain finally breaks
The silver key disappears into the mud
Scrambling forward, he looks for a way out
But the trees have encircled him, their spiky crowns bending down to crush him
He  up at the night, until his breath is gone
And then  realized, this wasn't the end of my life
With a sudden calm
(aloud) This isn't how  die
Another lightning , and suddenly the trees are back where they've always been
Edward is lying shoeless and torn in a muddy puddle, staring up at the rain
And
- His bare foot steps onto asphalt
Friend
Edward turns to see to his right, coming down the larger, paved road
What happened to your shoes
Edward looks down at his muddy, bloody feet
They got ahead of me
With that, the men start walking down the larger road
: - Edward and Will sit at opposite ends of the table, with Sandra and Josephine in the middle
Although Edward has a small plate of food in front of him, he hasn't touched it
He's exhausted from the trip downstairs, but determined to maintain the family dinner ritual
The other three eat awkwardly, each  and  of a knife or fork resonating
Will finally breaks the silence
don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek
Really
That's wonderful
spent a week in Morocco for the story
It was incredible
We'll have to pick up a copy
beat
As Will scoops out another serving of potatoes, Edward suddenly speaks: don't know if you're aware of this, Josephine, but African parrots, in their native home of the Congo -- they speak only French
All three stop to listen
(amused) Really
You're lucky to get four words out of them in English
But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French
Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion
Taking the bait
Why not religion, Dad
It's rude to talk about religion
You never know who you're going to offend
beat
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year
Oh, so you know
- Will shakes a shopping cart free from the pile-up while his mother checks her list
Sandra starts to bag string beans
Mom, would you say you understand Dad
Of course
What  mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head
Yes
How is that possible
mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories
(decidedly) You can't honestly say you know him
Yes, Will,  do
And don't presume things you don't know
She's more amused than annoyed, but Will is entering dangerous territory
Would you say you understand Josephine
Yes
But that's a different
No it's not
It's exactly the same
Your father and  met, we dated, and we married -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some fundamental level
Just the same as you two
She moves on to the carrots
Josephine and  have a lot in common
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man
(beat) The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife
And 've been his wife longer than 've been your mother
You can't discount that
True
But 've known him my whole life, and  don't feel like  know him at all
Or ever will
With a look, Sandra acknowledges the stakes
know it's not easy
Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son
You just ended up together
You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same
If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all
But  understand you, Mom
always have
Well, clearly you don't
But 'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now
- Reaching the , Sandra hands over her coupons
Will is approaching with a Newsweek magazine
Two checkstands over, an    in her 50's is getting her change
Though she's Sandra's generation, she carries herself like a much younger woman, with blue jeans and sneakers
She accidentally makes eye contact with Will as he passes
We   the woman, who tracks Will as he reaches Sandra
It's hard to read her reaction: does she recognize him, or just find him attractive
Will notices the gaze
The woman turns away
Will racks his brain -- does he know this woman
Before  forget, your father has papers in the basement 'd like you to go through
wouldn't know what's important
(distracted) Mom, do you know who that is
Blonde hair
Sandra looks
After a beat, the Blonde Woman turns again, semi-casually
Noticing that both Will and Sandra are looking, she smiles a little before taking her cart to leave
(no idea) Was she one of your teachers
No
But it's weird
She seemed to recognize me
(to the cashier) Do you know who that is
The Cashier turns to look
He can only get a profile as the woman leaves
Never seen her before
Pretty, though
- portable fan quietly  in the corner
Turned low, the on the nightstand is playing a call-in  sports show, just a wash of background chatter
Edward lies asleep on his back
At the window, Josephine quietly lowers the shade
She reaches over Edward to switch off the radio
He stirs from the silence -- he wasn't fully asleep -- and sees Josephine stretched over him
(playfully lecherous) Hello
She smiles
Hi
How are you feeling
was dreaming
What were you dreaming about
He tries to recollect, but it's already gone
Josephine motions, is it okay for her to sit on the bed
He nods
don't usually remember unless they're especially portentous
You know what that word means, portentous
She shakes her head
Means when you dream about something that's going to happen
(beat, gathering) Like one night,  had a dream where this crow came and told me, "Your Aunt is going to die
"  was so scared woke up my parents
They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed
But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead
That's terrible
Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power
Wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, "Your Grampa is going to die
" Well,  ran right back to my parents
My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but  could see there was trepidation
And true enough, that next morning my Grampa was dead
He sits up a bit in bed, his strength returning
For the next couple weeks,  didn't have another dream
Until one night the crow came back and said, "Your Daddy is going to die
" (beat) Well,  didn't know what to do
But finally  told my father
And he said not to worry, but  could tell he was rattled
That next day, he wasn't himself, always looking around, waiting for something to drop on his head
Because the crow didn't tell how it was going to happen, just those words: your Daddy is going to die
Well, he went into town early and was gone for a long time
And when he finally came back, he looked terrible, like he was waiting for the axe to fall all day
He said to my mother, "Good God
just had the worst day of my life
" (beat) "You think you've had a bad day," she said
"This morning the milkman dropped dead on the porch
" Josephine smiles, a half-laugh, which gets him smiling too
long beat
Then, deadpan
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman
No,  understand
He was slipping her a little extra cream
She nods, a bit more of a laugh
He was filling her basket
He was making deliveries around back
As Edward continues, she can't help but laugh harder, especially as the metaphors get more vulgar
He was buttering her rolls
Pumping her churn
Splashing milk in her box
Stop
They were squeezing the cheese
Clanking the bottles
Licking the popsicle
She's starting to cry from laughing
Cracking the eggs and making an omelet
With that, he stops
She regains her composure
Spooning the sherbet
(interrupting) Can  take your picture
You don't need a picture
Just look up handsome in the dictionary
Please
He rolls his eyes, why not
Josephine leaves, heading down the hall to get her camera
We   Edward in bed
(
) have photos from the wedding to show you
There's a great one of you and my father
had an extra print made
Edward grimaces, a flash of pain
Around others, he's hiding how much it hurts, but alone we can see how bad it is
He controls his breathing, trying to push through it
want to see pictures of your wedding
've never seen any
She returns with her camera
Edward smiles, doing a good job masking the pain
That's because we didn't have a wedding
Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me
She was engaged to somebody else
(loading film) never knew
Will never told you that
(she shakes her head) Probably just as well
He would have told it all wrong anyway
All the facts and none of the flavor
Oh, so this is a tall tale
Well, it's not a short one
devilish smile
Pushing past Edward, we settle on the whirling fan
: held by a
He's slumped over his 's shoulder, being carried towards a big-top tent
We are
- where the second-rate carnival is parked for the moment in an Alabama field
To the left, we spot Edward, 20-ish, halfway through a bag of peanuts
He's still carrying the backpack we saw earlier, and scratched up from his trip through Spectre
(
) had just left Ashton, and was on my way to discover my destiny
Not knowing what that would be exactly, explored every opportunity that presented itself
Joining the crowd, he heads into the big-top
- troupe of -  finishes their act to tremendous
As the performers clear away, the circus' owner-and-ringmaster (50) approaches the stands
He may only be four feet tall, but Amos has a titanic presence
Ladies and Gentlemen, you may think you've seen the unusual
You may think you've seen the bizarre
But 've travelled to the five corners of the world, and let me tell you, 've never seen anything like this
From behind Amos,  start rolling a massive ball towards the crowd
When  found this man, he was picking oranges in Florida
His fellow workers called him El Penumbra -- The Shadow -- because when you were working beside him, he blocked out the daylight
He could take a whole tree in his hands and shake off the fruit
had to pay his crew boss $10,000 just so could take him with me
Amos comes up to a -  in the first row, a quieter moment
Not to alarm you, Ma'am
But if this man wanted to, he could crush your head between his toes
(she trembles) But he won't
(a long beat) He's not going to hurt her, folks, because he's our own Gentle Giant
Ladies and Gentlemen,  give you Colossus
The carnies back away from the ball as a deep begins
moment, then the ball starts to bulge from inside
foot suddenly bursts out from within
from the crowd
That foot is massive
In the stands, Edward looks closer
Intrigued
As the drum beat intensifies, a second foot breaks out
Followed by hands
Shoulders
Finally, the head
This is From a very  , we look up to see just how massive he is
He seems to fill the Heavens
With his shaved head and giant club, he seems more ogre than man
In the bandstands, a  's jaw drops in awe
Colossus walks down the row, letting the crowd get a better look at him
Some reach out to touch him, disbelieving
tight spotlight follows him, revealing faces in the crowd
Colossus passes Edward, who seems unimpressed
He leans with the spotlight,  to get the big man's attention
He points to the edge of the stands, where his friend is sitting on the dirt -- stands up, so big the spotlight has to widen just to hold him
He's a good foot taller than Colossus
There's a from the crowd, along with nervous anticipation -- what will happen next
Amos, stunned, megaphone dangling
Colossus, realizing the gig is up
With a resigned shrug, he rests his club on his shoulder and walks away into the shadows
: - -  / As the stands empty, Edward and Karl talk to Amos
What's his name
Does he talk
It's not important
Karl
Tell me Karl, have you ever heard of the term "involuntary servitude
" Karl shakes his head
"Unconscionable contract
" Nope
Great, great
That's fantastic
(
) It was on that night Karl met his destiny
And  met mine
Almost
-  - As Amos pulls Karl aside to give him the hard sell, Edward notices a    (16) leaving with her family
She's wearing a blue dress and hat
For no good reason, she looks back at Edward
The two make eye contact
And as they do, all motion
fiery baton remains mid-twirl, flames locked in place spilled box of popcorn hangs in mid-air, each kernel like a snowflake
Even the elephant is mid-poop
Only Edward is free to move, winding his way between the frozen bodies, ducking underneath arms to get closer and closer to this woman
(
) They say when you meet the love of your life, time stops
And that's true
What they don't tell you, is that once time starts again, it moves extra fast to catch up
Suddenly, everything
The crowd becomes a blur, and the young woman is lost in its wake
Now it's Edward who's frozen, helpless in time
- Edward checks in windows as cars pull out, searching for his fated love
Not finding her, he becomes more frantic, running down the rows
: Colossus is thumbing for a ride
The last pickup truck stops and lets him climb in back
As the truck pulls out, it passes a dejected Edward
He'll never find that girl, the love of his life
- - Amos leans over so Karl can sign a contract on his back
He spots Edward walking back into the tent
Hey kid
Your friend just made himself a star
That's great
Amos hands off the contract to a
() My attorney, Mr
Soggybottom
Good to meet you
Mr
Soggybottom  his horn, then waddles off
What's the matter with you, kid haven't seen a customer so depressed since the elephant sat on that farmer's wife
(beat) Get it
"Depressed
" Karl chuckles
See
The big guy likes it
just saw the woman 'm going to marry,  know it
But then  lost her
Tough break
Most men have to get married before they lose their wives
(with absolute conviction) 'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her
That or die alone
Jesus, kid
(realizing) Let me guess
Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat
Yes
know her uncle
Friends of the family
Who is she
Where does she live
Kid
Don't waste your time
She's out of your league
As Amos starts to walk away, Edward hurries to catch up with him
Karl follows as well
What do you mean
You don't even know me
Sure  do
You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat
You don't have a plan
You don't have a job
You don't have anything but the clothes on your back
've got a whole backpack full of clothes
He points to the bleachers, where no backpack is to be found
(realizing) Someone stole my backpack
Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond
This here is the ocean, and you're drowning
Take my advice and go back to Puddleville
You'll be happy there
Getting in front of Amos, Edward stops him
Wait
You said  don't have a plan
do
'm going to find that girl and marry her and spend the rest of my life with her
Amos smiles, amused
don't have a job, but  would have a job if you gave me one
And  may not have much, but  have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet
Sorry, kid
don't do charity
'll work night and day, and you won't have to pay me
You just have to tell me who she is
Amos takes a long look at him
Ultimately, there's no way he can say no
He shrugs
What the hell
Every month you work for me, 'll tell you one thing about her
That's my final offer
Edward shakes Amos's hand before he can retract the offer
We move into a : - Edward, smiling nervously
His head is tilted to the side, and as we  , we see why: he's holding it in a  's open mouth
The beast's sharp teeth are just poking his skin
If the lion so much as flinches, Edward is dead
The  applauds, which makes the lion antsy
Which makes Edward antsier
(
) From that moment on,  did everything Mr
Calloway asked, and a lot of things he didn't
'd go three days without stopping to eat, and four days without sleeping
- His eyes droopy from lack of sleep, Edward mans the whirling amusement park ride
(
) The only thing that kept me going was the promise of meeting the girl who would be my wife
Nodding off, Edward falls backward, into the path of the spinning arms
One of the Hydra cars hits him square in the gut, throwing him up and away, sailing 200 feet through the air
- Edward chases a costumed pig, tripping over tent cords, falling in the mud
His hunt leads him through the back of a tent, where he's unwittingly stepped in front of a line of motorized birds
To the left,  are shooting with rifles
He dodges four  that knock down the birds around him
He catches his breath, lucky
Then a half-blind   pulls her trigger, hitting him in the shoulder
- Karl the Giant bandages Edward's arm as well as he can
Amos is walking past
Mr
Calloway
It's been a month today
Amos stops, looks at the young man
Finally
This girl, the love of your life
Her favorite flower is daffodils
He walks away
We   on Edward, enraptured by the concept
Daffodils
(to Karl) Daffodils
- Edward shovels shit in the nastiest stables you've ever seen
But all he can think about is
(to himself) Daffodils
The wonder of it
He goes back to shoveling, a smile on his face
(
) True to his word, every month Amos would tell me something new about the woman of my dreams
- Edward, lost in quiet reverie, pondering his latest bit of information
College
She's going to college
sudden  as Edward is shot
-  [] out of a giant cannon
- Under a full moon, Edward feeds the animals
(to himself) Music
She likes music
like music too
(
) Over the months,  learned a lot about the woman  was going to marry, but not her name, and not where to find her
That time had come
couldn't wait any longer
'  - Under a full moon, Edward walks up to the battered camper, and is about to knock when he notices it's rocking
lot
Not just that, there's  coming from inside
But Edward  anyway
Mr
Calloway
It's Edward Bloom need to talk to you
Suddenly, the rocking and moaning stop
beat, then the door handle begins to
It seems to be stuck
Edward turns the knob
Suddenly, the door
Edward is knocked down by a massive black dog, biggest you've ever seen
It has green glowing eyes and a lick of fire for a tongue
Edward wrestles with the beast, its mouth snapping at his throat
Blocking with an arm, Edward tries to push himself free, but the creature's hands -- it has hands instead of paws -- hold on tight
Entwined, they roll across the dirt
The other nearby scatter for cover
Mr
Soggybottom pulls a revolver out of his clown suit
Loads a silver bullet
Edward finally succeeds in throwing the beast off
He rolls to his feet
The hell hound squares back on its haunches, , ready for another leap
Mr
Soggybottom sheds a clown tear, aiming the revolver at the dog
At the last moment
No, wait
Edward moves just as Mr
Soggybottom
The bullet catches Edward in the shoulder, knocking him down
The carnies
Licking its chops, the dog approaches the helpless Edward, who feels the ground around him, looking for some kind of weapon
He finds only a small stick
He waves it at the dog, ready to strike it
Like magic, the dog's whole demeanor changes
It bounces excitedly, ready to play fetch
Seeing an opportunity, Edward throws the stick as far as he can
The dog bounds after it, It returns a beat later with the flaming stick, which it drops at Edward's feet
Its tail whips back and forth
It was that night  discovered that most things you consider evil or wicked are simply lonely, and lacking in the social niceties
Edward throws the stick again
The dog takes off in a new direction
: - - Exhausted from playing fetch all night, Edward throws the stick into the woods
The still-spry dog goes after it
It's gone for a long time, long enough that Edward becomes concerned
He follows it into the woods
- Amos Calloway stands up behind a bush, buck naked and hairy
He still has the stick in his mouth, which he takes out as Edward approaches
Didn't kill anything, did
few rabbits, but  think one of them was already dead
That would explain the indigestion
Edward tosses him his jacket to cover his privates
was wrong about you kid
You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of
You could get any girl
There's only one  want
beat
Her name is Sandra Templeton
She's going to Auburn
The semester's almost over, so you better hurry
Thank you
Good luck, kid
Edward walks away
Then starts running
He has to get there as soon as possible
Amos sits down and scratches his ear with his foot
- Edward shakes Karl's giant hand
They hug
(
) After saying my goodbyes,  hopped three trains to get to Auburn that afternoon
- We   the main quad, to find Edward Bloom dunking his head in the fountain
He changes out of his grubby shirt into a new one, just out of the package
It's the mid-1960's, but by the conservative dress of the passing , it could be any era
- Edward stands with a bouquet of daffodils in front of a half- open door
Through the crack we can see the edge of a , talking in hushed tones with another girl we can't see
Finally, a decision is reached
The door opens to reveal the woman of Edward's dreams, Sandra Kay Templeton
She's effortlessly beautiful, pure and simple as sunlight
He can't believe he's finally reached her
He half-laughs, nervous
That makes her laugh, not sure what's going on
You don't know me, but my name is Edward Bloom and  am in love with you
've spent the last three years working to find out who you are
've been shot and stabbed and trampled a few times, had my ribs broken twice, but it's all worth it to see you here, now, and to finally get to talk to you
Because  am destined to marry you
knew that from the first moment  saw you at the circus
And  know it now more than ever
, overwhelmed
All she can finally think of to say is
'm sorry
Don't need to apologize to me mean, 'm the luckiest person you're going to find today
She puts her hand on the door frame
On her left ring finger, we see a diamond
No 'm sorry,
'm engaged to be married
as his heart falls 20 floors
He tries to suppress the reaction, put on a brave front
Oh
But you're wrong
do know you, at least by reputation
Edward Bloom from Ashton
See, 'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton
Don Price
He was a few years older than you
: -   - Young Don Price shines his flashlight on Edward
93 Recapping earlier football, baseball and basketball highlights, we find Edward beats Don every time
/ smoking Don Price crushes his cigarette as Edward leaves town
: /
- Edward is dumbstruck
With all the strength he can muster
Well
Congratulations
'm sorry to have bothered you
He turns and walks down the front steps
She stays in the doorway for a few beats, feeling genuinely horrible for what's happened
But eventually she goes back inside
We hear  from inside as her sorority sisters get to the bottom of this
Stop it
It's not funny
That poor boy
We  Edward as he walks away, tears just starting to form
(
) Fate has a cruel way of circling around on you
After all this work to leave Ashton, the girl  loved was now engaged to one of its biggest jerks
He  , leaving only the sorority house in the background
(
) There's a time when a man needs to fight, and a time when he needs to accept that his destiny is lost, that the ship has sailed, and that only a fool would continue
beat
Edward steps back  , looking at the sorority house
(
) The truth is, 've always been a fool
We  as he shouts: Sandra Templeton
love you
And am going to marry you
- Sandra and her  peer out through the curtains
Is this guy crazy
- The tweedy   continues his explanation
Sandra isn't paying a lot of attention
He switches on the overhead projector without looking at it
There's a  from the , but he doesn't notice
classmate nudges Sandra, who looks up
Written on the projector is " Love Sandra Templeton
" She's horrified and excited at the same time
The professor finally notices what's written there
- Walking with her books, Sandra shakes her head, disbelieving
We look up to the blue sky, where a giant sky-written heart floats in the wind
'  - [ ] At her Sisters' prompting, a just-woken Sandra looks out the second-story window to find the lawn filled with Edward stands amid the sea of flowers
He's waited there six hours
- Sandra walks out to him
She's smiling, confused, joyful and scared
All down Greek Street,  are coming out to see the display
Daffodils
They're your favorite flower
How did you get so many
called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way could get my wife to marry me
Out of nowhere, a tear drops down Sandra's cheek
She wipes it off
You don't even know me
have the rest of my life to find out
From down the street
' Sandra
It's Don
Promise me you won't hurt him
If that's what you want,  swear to it
The adult   arrives
He's 230 pounds of football- playing, Skynyrd-loving, fraternity-proud muscle
And he's pissed
gang of his  walk behind him
Bloom
Don
What the hell are you doing
This is my girl
Mine
didn't know she belonged to anybody
Don Price decks him, knocking him down
Edward gets right back up, but makes no move to defend himself
Unfazed, Don slugs him again
Stop it
(ignoring) What the matter, Bloom
Too scared to fight back
promised  wouldn't
beat
Don shrugs, fine
Then proceeds to kick Edward's ass nine ways to Sunday
(
) While  took the beating of a lifetime, it was Don Price who was ultimately defeated
As the ass-whupping continues, we : -  [] Sitting on the can, Don Price pinches a loaf while reading the new Playboy
(
) All the physical activity had worsened a congenital valve defect
Put simply, his heart wasn't strong enough
Don Price squeezes down hard, trying to shit the unshittable
Suddenly, he grasps his chest and collapses face-first on the tile
: '  /  -  [] The same image of Don's dead face on the tile is reflected in The Eye
: - The thrashing continues
Edward somehow fights his way back to his feet, ready to be knocked down again
Don
Don is about to slug Edward again when he turns
Sandra pulls off her engagement ring
There's an audible from her sisters, and an
from Don's brothers
will never marry you
beat
Don stands stunned, his mind reeling
Edward, whose eyes are swollen almost shut, keeps waiting for the next punch
Where is it
What's going on
What
You love this guy
He's almost a stranger and  prefer him to you
She hands him the ring
Another beat, then Don storms off
But not before decking Edward one last time
Sandra leans over Edward's broken body
His head lies on the daffodils
How can  convince you to stop
Go out with me
He smiles, his teeth bloody
Okay
As the crowd of students  and , we above the flowered battlefield
(
) As it turned out, Sandra was able to keep her same date at the chapel
Only the groom had changed
As the  reaches a crescendo, we suddenly
: -  [] thought you said you didn't have a church wedding
Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication
He reaches for his glass of water, but Josephine already has it for him
She watches him while he slowly drinks the entire glass, thirstier than he imagined
While he's drinking, we
: -  [] Will, back from the grocery store, reaches the top of the stairs
He hears voices coming from the bedroom
(
) Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty
(
) Truth is, 've been thirsty my whole life
Never really known why
Will quietly approaches the door, not exactly sneaking, but not exactly announcing his presence
The door is open a few inches, letting him look in on his father and his wife
/ There was one time when  was eleven
(gently) You were talking about your wedding
didn't forget
was just working on a tangent
See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either
like your stories
And  like you
He doesn't let the moment linger with undue sentimentality
There's a story to be told
Now
The thing about working for a circus is you don't have a regular address, and after three years  had a lot of undelivered mail
In the hallway, Will shifts to a new position, letting himself listen to the story one more time
During the four weeks  was in the hospital, the postmaster finally caught up with me
- Bruised and bandaged, Edward sorts through a big bag of mail with help from Sandra
He rips open an official-looking letter
Reading it, his face drops
and , music rising to a military cadence
(
) It turned out that while my heart belonged to Sandra, the rest of my body belonged to the
Government
- With a buzz cut and paratrooper gear, Edward squats with a dozen other
The noise of the  is deafening, but Edward is engrossed in an Asian phrasebook
(
) hitch in the Army was up to three years at that point, and having waited three years just to meet Sandra, knew  couldn't survive being away from her that long
So  took every hazardous assignment  could find, with the hope of getting my time down to less than a year
The   yells
One by one the men jump out, their chutes clipped to a main line
When his time comes, Edward leaps
but he's stuck
His cord is caught up in the assembly
He twists and struggles, trying to free himself
Looking down, he can see the white parachutes disappearing into the darkness
They're already long gone
Digging a knife out of his pocket, Edward gets to work cutting through the cable
It finally
Edward jumps from the plane
- sit, bored, watching the equivalent of a
show
is on stage with his Communist puppet
We have no idea what they're saying to each other, but every act is fundamentally the same
The  comes on to usher him off the stage before he's finished
The Ventriloquist protests, but finally gives in
The Emcee makes a "shoot him in the neck" motion to one of the   off-stage
- We   with Edward, who is drifting right for the stage
He can't steer
He's helpless
But then, a  of fireworks from the sides of the stage
The lights go out as a   begins
It's just enough cover for Edward to remain unseen
He lands with a  on the lighting catwalk above the stage
He barely grabs on, disconnecting his chute just as the curtain goes up
Edward looks out at the sea of excited soldiers
Every one of them would kill him
He's the legless cricket left on the anthill
The curtain rises to reveal  (27) at a microphone
She's as gorgeous a woman as you'll ever see
She stands with her hips turned in profile
Her body is a knockout, dress cut to reveal skin
The soldiers are on their feet,  and
, Edward is surprised by an
The two men begin to
starts, a vampy torch song
Ping sings melody while an off-stage voice carries perfect harmony
Sometimes a girl can feel so alone Without a lover to call her own
Sometimes it's so bad, she wants to explode
Wants to grab the first man she sees and tear off his clothes
from the soldiers
She knows what they want
Still fighting, Edward jumps for a pole on the far side of the catwalk, sliding down it to end up His determined opponent follows him down
(') But she won't
No, she can't
She needs a special special different unusual man
Because that girl, Who looks like me, She has wants, but she has needs
(speaking) Any of you got needs
The soldiers  ,  on the bleachers
Backstage, the two men are still fighting
(chorus) 've had twice the adventure, Cried double the tears
Two times the bad times in half the years
need a strong man, because 've got Twice the love to give
For the first time, Ping turns, and now we see why she was standing in profile
Ping is one-half of Her identical twin is , who's been singing harmony all this time
They are two separate women who join at the waist, one set of perfect legs beneath them
Edward sees the twins from behind, does a double-take
It costs him a punch to the jaw
Say hello, Jing
Hello Jing
(to the crowd) 'm Ping
She's Jing
She's the good one
(closer) 'm the bad one
As the  builds towards the climax, Edward finishes the fight, knocking the guard out with a right hook
As Ping and Jing reach the last chorus, they strike a final pose in the shape of a heart, their arms forming the arches, their backs forming the curves
Edward slips behind curtains, trying to get away
The soldiers are  for an encore, lighters waving
The curtain slowly lowers, revealing '
The  dies, replaced by a concerned
The Emcee yells for the Guards to search
Ping has no idea what's happening
Jing reaches into her cleavage to pull out her eyeglasses
- As   search the halls below the stage, Ping and Jing shut the door to their dressing room
At the closet, they start to change outfits
Off-stage, their personalities become quite apparent: Ping is brash, bitchy and ambitious, while Jing is quiet, sweet and bookish
In Chinese, subtitled
How could you miss your cue
You make me look like a fool, out there alone
You weren't alone
Ping , turning her back on her sister
Jing reaches deeper into the closet to find a new dress, exposing Edward's hiding place
She
Ping turns to look
Who the hell are you
(in Chinese) 'm not going to hurt you
Damn right you're not
(yelling) Jing grabs her, a hand over her mouth, but it's too late rifle-toting  looks in
Pretending to be her bitchy sister -- Tell your men not to bother us
And lock that door
The guard obeys
Ping shakes her sister off
Desperately flipping through his Asian phrasebook, he finds
Please,  need your help
What makes you think we'll help you
Edward pulls a photo out of his flak jacket
It's Sandra
: (
) Over the next hour,  described my love for Sandra Kay Templeton, and the ordeal that brought me before them
As it had always been, this love was my salvation
It was destined to be
Hearing the story, Jing wipes away a tear
Even Ping is a little affected
(
) We put together an elaborate plan for escape, involving a whaling ship to Russia, a barge to Cuba and a small, dirty canoe to Miami
We all knew it would be dangerous
Still subtitled: And what are we supposed to do when we get to America
can get you bookings
know the biggest man in show business
Bob Hope
Bigger
: - Sandra checks the mail, hoping for a letter from Edward
(
) And so the twins and  began our arduous journey halfway around the world
Unfortunately, there was no way to send a message back to America
black car pulls up
Two   get out
(
) And so it was no surprise that the Army believed  was dead
Hearing the news, Sandra
The pain of her shout makes church bells
- Sandra hangs sheets to dry on the clotheslines, forming a tunnel of fabric
(
) After four months, Sandra had gotten over the worst of the nightmares
When the phone rang, she didn't think it was somehow me calling her
When a car drove past, she didn't get up to check out the window
Pulling a dress out of the basket, Sandra looks up to see ' on the sheet in front of her
She freezes, watching the shadow ripple across the white fabric, blowing so softly in the breeze
She knows it can't be him
He's dead
She turns away
With all the strength she can gather, she hangs up that dress and digs another one out of the basket
Looking up, she sees not a shadow but Edward himself standing before her
She , disbelieving, but his hand is real
It is destiny
Without another moment's hesitation, she kisses him
: filters through soft sheets
We're under the covers, where a man's hand traces the curves of a woman's bare back
beat, then she turns over in bed, revealing her to be She blinks slowly, just waking up
Will is watching her
He's been up for a while
We are actually
'  - where the couple stays cocooned under the sheets, a kind of limbo
kiss good morning
Legs entangling
Neither wants to get up
talked with your father last night
Did you
look to say, should  be worried
You never told me how your parents met
They met at Auburn
What about the details
How they fell in love
The Circus
The War
You never told me any of that
That's because most of it never happened
But it's romantic
beat
(non-committal) Mmm
Mmm, what
Mmm, what
know better than to argue romance with a French woman
He moves his head out from under the sheet
She follows him to the "outside
" Do you love your father
Everyone loves my father
He's a very likeable guy
(repeating) Do you love him
Will doesn't want to answer yes or no
You have to understand
When  was growing up, he was gone more than he was here
And  started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else
With another house, another family
He leaves us, he goes to them
Or maybe there is no family
Maybe he never wanted a family
But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better
And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place
But it's not true
What is "true
" 've never heard my father say a single true thing
Off her silence
Look,  know why you like him know why everyone likes him
But need you to tell me 'm not crazy
You're not
need you on my side
am always on your side
And  think you should talk to him
- The family finishes eating breakfast off  trays set up around the bed
For his part, Edward is looking better
Certainly not recovered, but there's an optimism to his expression
And for the first time, he's actually hungry
He watches as Sandra puts the cap back on the syrup
Did  ever tell you about how
(interrupting) Yes
Edward is startled
The maple tree and the Buick
We heard it
(re: Josephine) think someone hasn't
The tree fell on the car, spilling the syrup, which attracted the flies, which got stuck to it and flew off with the whole car
beat
(undeterred) But the real story is how  got the car
You see
(interrupting) Dad
Son
Can we talk
Sandra  the cap back on the syrup
'm going to get started on dishes
'll help you
Both women quickly gather plates
Will and Edward both smile
The women clearly want this to happen
It settles for a beat after they leave
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad
Do
saw an iceberg once
They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside
The woolly kind
mammoth
(interrupting) Dad
What
'm trying to make a metaphor here
Then you shouldn't have started with a question
Because people want to answer questions
You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is
" (frustrated) The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them
The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it
And that's what it is with you Dad
'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water
(joking) What, you're seeing down to my nose
My chin
have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact
've told you a thousand facts
That's all  do, Will
tell stories
You tell lies, Dad
You tell amusing lies
Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime
They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty
And the thing is, believed you
believed your stories so much longer than  should have
And then when  realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything
--  felt like such a fool to have trusted you
You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined
Just as charming and just as fake
You think 'm fake
Only on the surface
But that's all 've ever seen
Edward looks away, angry and disbelieving
Dad, 'm about to have a kid of my own here
It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me
It would kill you, huh
Finally -- What do you want, Will
Who do you want me to be
Yourself
Good, bad, everything
Just show me who you are for once
have been nothing but myself since the day  was born
And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine
- With a skimmer pole, Will cleans the leaves and debris out of the pool, but it's a fool's errand
The pool has long since gone native, a shiny slick of algae on the surface, slime covering the cemented rocks
Suddenly, an underwater shape  against the water's surface
Will is so startled that he drops the pole, which disappears into the murky water
beat
He looks around, relieved that no one saw that
He casually walks away
- The doors open to reveal Sandra, Will and Josephine, staring into the mouth of oblivion
The storeroom is a museum of hasty decisions and half-finished projects: partially built outboard motors, dead bonsai trees, Frankensteinian lawnmowers
We also find boxes of products Edward used to sell
Clearing a path, Sandra leads Will to a roll-top desk, its ribs covered in dust
Two beaten metal file cabinets sit beside it
Your father decided he needed to have an office, and it wouldn't do to have it in the house
You'll know better than me what's important
With some effort, Will forces up the desktop
With a , a neighbor's cat makes a run for it
Will's getting used to being startled
-  [] Will, Sandra and Josephine have worked through two trash bags of papers to throw out
Looking through a new file, Sandra makes a small sound
memory
What is it
Sandra hands Will a yellowed telegram
He shares it with Josephine
It was during the war
Your father went missing
They thought he was dead
Will can't believe what he's reading
That really happened
Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication
beat, then Sandra stands
'm going to check on him
need to lie down for a bit
Go
Josephine kisses him, then follows Sandra
Will re-reads the telegram, still bewildered
Looking for a place to put it, he tucks it into a strange mechanical hand on the desk
It clamps down automatically
Will smiles, a memory
He hasn't thought about this device in years
We slowly   on the telegram, held in the hand
Edward's  begins as a memory
(
) After the war, the sons of Alabama returned home, looking for work
Each had an advantage over me
They were alive, while  was -- officially -- deceased
-  [] Edward shakes hands with his new boss, a
The company is called "Confederated Products
" The all love Edward
(
) With my prospects few,  took a job as a travelling salesman
It suited me
If there's one thing you can say about Edward Bloom, it's that  am a social person
-  [] On a low platform, Edward pitches a brilliant new product to the crowd
've travelled from Tennessee to Timbuktu, and if there's one thing people have in common, is we could all use a hand around the house
Edward sets down a contraption, which looks something like a metal lava lamp
Like a flower, it unfolds to reveal five fingers and a thumb
This is the Hand Around the House
() Why, with this product you can
as he demonstrates: Open a jar
Open a letter
Scratch yourself while wearing mittens
Hold a book
Hold a baby
Hold the dog away from kittens
It's strong enough, you can do a handstand with no hands at all
Indeed, a remarkably agile Edward is able to support his entire weight on it
The crowd
You can use it to point out important information
Or dangers
Or beautiful women
The hand points a finger at an
We're still working on that one
The crowd
- Edward drives, his hand out in the wind
(
) Soon  added other products, and other cities, until my territory stretched from the coast to western Texas
- Edward kisses his pregnant wife goodbye, as much in love as ever
(
) could be gone for weeks at a time
But every other Friday, 'd put all the money 'd made into an account set aside for a proper house with a white picket fence
&  - Establishing this Texas institution, we come
&  - The bank is busy with the lunch-hour crowd
Taking his place in line, Edward fills out a deposit slip
As the line snakes around through the ropes, the man in front of him gets a look at Edward
Edward
Edward Bloom
The man is none other than
It's me
Norther Winslow
(
) was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas
The men shake, disbelieving this lucky coincidence
don't believe it
want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes
There was a whole life out there that  was not living
So  travelled
saw France, and Africa, half of South America
Every day a new adventure, that's my motto
That's great, Norther
'm happy for you
can't believe  helped
He's genuinely proud
So what are you up to now
'm robbing this place
Reaching the front of the line, Norther pulls two pistols out of his coat,  both into the ceiling
all around
The skinny   makes a halfhearted reach for his gun, but Norther waves him off
The guard takes out his gun and slides it over
(to Edward) Would you mind grabbing that
There's nothing threatening about his delivery -- he might as well be asking for a Budweiser
Still, Edward senses it would be best to do as he says
He takes the guard's gun
(to the crowd) Now,  want all of you to lie down
'm gonna be cleaning out the cash drawers, and my associate here is going to handle the vault
(pointing to a Teller Woman) You help my friend, okay
The   nods
Edward, not sure what to do
He has a gun, but he truly doesn't want to shoot Norther
The Teller Woman is already waving him to the back
He decides he better go
- The Teller Woman is crying as she works the combination
Edward feels horrible
Look, 'm really sorry
just don't want anybody to get hurt
It's not that, it's just
She pulls open the vault door
- The inner sanctum of the Horizon Savings and Loan holds exactly one folding chair
Nothing else
there's no money
We're completely bankrupt
(
) It turned out the savings and loan had already been robbed -- not by armed bandits, but by speculators in Texas real estate
(dead serious) You gotta promise you won't tell anybody
: '  - Edward drives the getaway car, though truthfully they're going just a little over the speed limit
No one's following them
It's an empty country road for miles
Norther  with body-tingling joy as he counts the money
Sixty
Eighty
Four hundred dollars
Not bad for just the drawers
Let's see what you got from the vault
Edward winces, but doesn't say anything yet
Digging through the vault bag, Norther is surprised to find only a single deposit envelope
He rips it open, revealing just a little cash inside
Even some dimes and pennies
This is it
The whole vault
'Fraid so
Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it
Caught, Edward has to confess
Look,  just didn't want you to go empty-handed
There's something you should know, Norther
You see, the reason why
Edward continues his narration
(
) told Norther about the vagaries of Texas oil money and its effect on real estate prices, and how lax enforcement of fiduciary process had made savings and loans particularly vulnerable
Hearing this news, Norther was left with one conclusion: - Norther leans in the driver's side window
should go to Wall Street
That's where all the money is
Edward looks over at Norther, the reality sinking in
(
) knew then that while my days as a criminal were over, Norther's were just beginning
The two men wave at each other as Edward drives off
At the last moment, Norther calls out: Edward, thank you for the hand
He's talking about his Hand Around the House
We Norther for a beat, dreaming of his future
(
) When Norther made his first million dollars, he sent me a check for ten thousand
protested, but he said it was my fee as his career advisor
[/ '70'] - Sandra is watering the garden
Will (5) runs past her to greet Edward, just returned from another trip
(
) Ten thousand dollars is no fortune to most men
But it was enough to buy my wife a proper house with a white picket fence
We reveal the Bloom house, the nicest one in the neighborhood
Edward kisses his wife
(
) And for that, it was all the riches a man could ever want
Sandra drops the hose, letting it run on the lawn
: -  [] Edward's hand as he turns knobs
water  into the claw-foot bathtub, which begins to fill
Still wearing his pajamas, Edward climbs into the tub
Carefully lowers himself
As the water reaches the third button up on his pajama shirt, Edward suddenly slides Bubbles rise from his nose for a few beats, then stop
It's quiet, except for the distant  of water from the spigot
Edward's eyes are closed
long beat
Another
Then the  water goes silent
Edward opens one eye
The other eye
He sits up to find sitting on the edge of the tub
She doesn't seem particularly worried -- her husband has always done this
was drying out
see
We need to get you one of those plant misters
We can spray you like a fern
He smiles, then pulls his knees up, making room for her in the tub
beat while she considers
Sandra steps out of her sandals and climbs into the tub, facing him
Her dress is soaked, but she doesn't mind
He leans forward and kisses her
When they separate, she has tears hanging in her eyes
Come now
He wipes them away
don't think 'll ever dry out
- Perched awkwardly on a canoe, Will's made it through another file cabinet
He goes through the folders page by page, but usually ends up tossing the whole thing in the trash
He's about to toss a file when he stops
Takes another look
Something doesn't make sense
/  - Will is headed upstairs when his mother comes around the corner with an armful of laundry, including her wet dress
Is he awake
He just fell asleep
Josephine's with him
She passes him
He turns
Mom
Yes
Will quickly debates whether or not to ask her
Did you and Dad have any other property
(thinking) suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on
But we sold that right away
Your cousin Shirley bought it
So you never bought any land
Heavens no
We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place
Will nods, just curious
He continues heading up
'  - Will changes his shirt
Takes his keys off the nightstand
- Will's rental car drives past a sign reading, "Ashton, 10 miles
" '  -  / Will checks the address on one of his father's files
- Will talks to the , who points him in a direction, then gestures a series of left, right, left, rights
- Will drives down a road that seems somewhat familiar
And then we realize why: a roadsign reads "Welcome to Spectre
" - Sitting at the edge of a swamp, the little two-story feels lonely, set deep in its lot
Dapples of light break through the trees, a light breeze swaying the branches
As Will walks from the car, the  of cicadas grows
He checks the number: 33
This is the house
It is surrounded by a white square-picket fence, identical to his mother's
Will notices this
Reaching the porch, we hear a  playing inside
Badly
Re-checking the number on a form he's carrying, Will
The piano stops
'  (
) Go back to the start
Right hand only
The piano starts again
The door opens to reveal a blonde woman in her 50's -- the woman from the grocery store
Her name is Jenny Hill
She and Will are startled to see each other
Oh
Oh
Hello
wasn't expecting you
Confused, Will checks the name on the form
Are you Jenny Hill
am
And you're Will
've seen your picture, that's how  recognize you
almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward
(a beat) Like this
The  , a black boy of eight, has stopped
He's watching the conversation at the door
Speaking of awkward
(to the student) Listen, Kenny
Why don't we skip the lesson today
We can go again next week
She hands him five dollars out of her pocket
Do  have to give it back to my Mom
won't tell her if you won't
You don't have to tell him twice
He's out the door in a flash
'  - While Will sips his iced tea, Jenny flips through a form she never expected to see again
She hands it back to Will
How did you know my father
This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time
Everyone in town knew him
beat
Not flinching
Were you and my father having an affair
(taken aback) Wow
Wow, you just said it
was expecting to dance around this for another half hour
've seen him with women
He flirts
He always has
On some level, presumed he was cheating on my mother
just never had proof
She moves, trying to get out of the corner he's boxed her into
Once she's finally free
Can  ask you a question
Why did you come here today
If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie
Because he's dying
long beat
Jenny is taken back by the suddenness of it
She's a tangle of conflicting emotions
Look,  don't know how much you want to know about any of this
You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it
Especially this late in the game
My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and 'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about
'm just trying to reconcile the two
Fair enough
Jenny takes a seat across from him at the table
The first thing you have to understand, is that your father never meant to end up here
And yet he did, twice
The first time, he was early
The second time, he was late
'  /  - It's late, and Edward is pensive
(
) Those days, your father was working for himself
If there was one thing you could say about Edward Bloom, it's that he was a social person, and people took a liking to him
One night he was returning from three weeks on the road, when he hit a thunderstorm unlike any in his life
The first raindrops hit the windshield
Edward turns on the wipers
'  -  - [ ] Suddenly, a deluge descends
It's not even rain anymore -- there's no space between the drops
It's like being caught in a waterfall
It's that loud
No choice, Edward stops the car
Puts on the handbrake
Just as suddenly, the sound changes -- no longer pounding, but softly
The world is close and echoing, because -- '  - -- the car is underwater
The tires are still on the road, but where there used to be air is water
Three catfish swim in front of his headlights
- Realizing his plight, Edward tries to remain calm
Water is trickling in through the crack between the window and the door, but very slowly
For now, he's fine
That's when he sees her -- The Girl in the River
She's swimming outside the car
While we never see her face exactly, she remains just as beautiful, just as mysterious, as the first time we saw her
She puts her hand to the windshield
He puts his up to meet hers
And smiles
: - It's morning, and the sun shines brightly
Birds
Trees drip and the grass shines, still wet from last night's rain
Edward gathers the clothes that have spilled out of his suitcase, which broke open when he dropped it from , which balances precariously ten feet up in an elm tree
As Edward gathers his last pair of socks, he notices a shiny piece of metal sticking out of the dirt
He pulls it out, rubs it off
It's a key
It's the Key to the City he lost years ago
(
) Fate has a way of circling back on a man, and taking him by surprise
- Carrying his busted suitcase, a tired Edward walks toward a one-street town in the distance
We pass a rusty sign
"Welcome to Spectre
" - Amazed and disbelieving, Edward walks down the center of the road, no cars coming from either direction
He looks up to find his faded shoes still dangling from the power line, along with the rest of the town's
(
) man sees things differently at different times in his life
This town didn't seem the same now that he was older
- We look around the town, on and off Main Street
There are " " signs in many of the windows (
) new road had brought the outside world to Spectre, and with it, banks, liens and debt
Almost everywhere you looked, people were bankrupt
- We slowly   a foreclosure auction to find Edward watching
Two very corporate   , stick out among the bidders
(
) Two different corporations were looking at buying the town, if they could get the price low enough
One wanted to open a chicken processing plant
The other, a municipal dump
Either way, Spectre would be destroyed
Edward raises his hand
Fifty-thousand
Everyone turns to look at this new bidder
(
) And so Edward Bloom decided to buy the town, in order to save it
'  - Edward pitches his plan to Norther
(
) He was never a wealthy man, but he had made other men rich, and now he asked for their favors
/
- : Expressive and passionate as always, Edward talks to Ping, Jing and Amos Calloway
(
) Most of them had never seen Spectre -- they only had Edward's words to describe it
That's all they needed
He sold them on the dream
You can structure it as a historical trust
But you'll need every contiguous piece of property
It's all or nothing
As Edward takes notes
(
) So first he bought the farms
Then he bought the houses
Then he bought the stores
'  - Finishing up with , Edward shakes hands
(
) Whatever he bought, the people were not asked to leave or pay rent or anything
They were just asked to keep doing as they were doing
In that way, he could make sure the town would never die
- Edward climbs out of his car, the road having literally stopped
The sun is shining, but it can barely penetrate the trees' thick canopy
(
) Within six months, his trust had purchased the entire town
With one exception
In the distance, he sees a shack, so old it's nearly fallen
He walks toward it, the marshy ground  up around his feet, soaking the hems of his trousers
We hear a  playing from inside the shack
Edward on the half-hung door, which swings open by itself
- The inside is nicer than you'd think, a real home
fire burns in the stove, and curtains hang in the windows
With her back turned to him, Jenny Hill plays the piano
Edward doesn't recognize her as the little girl who used to have a crush on him
Without turning, she says
You must be Edward Bloom
How did you know
She keeps
No one would come out here unless they had business
And no one would have business with me except for you
You're buying the town
Apparently 've overlooked this one piece of it, and 'd like to remedy that
You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety
So 've heard
'll offer you more than it's worth
And you know you won't have to move
Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word
Jenny stops playing, her piece not quite finished
She turns to face him
Edward still doesn't recognize her
Now let me get this straight
You'll buy the swamp from me, but 'll stay in it
You'll own the house, but it'll still be mine
'll be here, and you'll come and go as you please to one place or another
Do  have that right
Strange to hear it put that way, but -- In so many words, yes
Then  don't think so Mr
Bloom
If nothing is going to change, 'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time
It's not like you're going to lose anything
You can ask anyone in town
've been nothing if not generous want the best for everyone
long beat
Mr
Bloom, why are you buying this land
Some sort of midlife crisis
Instead of buying a convertible, you buy a town
He looks at her, puzzled and surprised
No one has really asked before
Helping people makes me happy
'm not convinced you should be happy
'm sorry
Have  offended you
She finally turns to face him
No, you did exactly what you promised
You came back
was just expecting you sooner
: - Young Jenny Hill watches barefoot Edward leave Spectre for the first time
: - Finally realizing who this woman is
You're Beamen's daughter
Your last name is different
(realizing) You married
was 18
He was 28
Turns out that was a big difference
Before he can say anything more
won't be selling you this house, Mr
Bloom
see
thank you for your time
bit bewildered, Edward tips his hat to her as he leaves
/
- Edward pulls the door shut behind him as he leaves, but it breaks off in his hands
It's not the clean exit he was hoping for
Inside Jenny looks out, surprised and annoyed
Edward tries to lift the door back on the hinges, but they off
The door frame buckles and the whole shack
'm sorry
He tries to lean the door against the frame, but it keeps slipping
It's okay, just leave it
can get it
can just
He leans the door a different way
It holds for a beat then falls in,  a small table
Lord, 'm sorry
Please
Go
Just go
'll
Go
She's dead serious
Weighing the scales of chivalry, he finally backs away
Turns and heads back towards his car
We   Jenny, watching him go
She's furious, but there's something more in her feelings for him
Something softer
(
) Most men in that situation would accept their failure and move on
But Edward was not like most men
- With Karl the Giant's help, Edward unloads a brand new door from a pickup truck
- While Jenny watches, half-annoyed, half-amused, Edward tries to set the door square
Karl pushes against the side of the house until it fits
- Holding nails between his lips, Edward puts in new windows himself
Jenny is making soup, laughing at the story he's telling
(
) As the months passed, he found more and more things to fix, until the shack no longer resembled itself
- Edward and Karl cut down a tree, letting in a flood of light
Through the golden pollen hanging in the air, we   to see the shack is now we saw before
It's tiny and white, with black shutters and a steep roof
white picket fence
In every detail it is impossibly charming
'  - Edward is screwing a hat rack into the wall in the foyer
Jenny leans against the doorframe listening to his story
And watching him with deepest affection
Of course, the best part was creating new material
By the time the twins and  got to Havana, we had a whole new routine worked out for them, with just a ukulele and a harmonica
Finished with his work, he takes his hat off the chair and hangs it on the rack
Perfect
beat
look between them
With that last job done, there's no reason for him to be staying any longer
suppose  should
He takes his hat off the rack
You can leave it there
beat
Does she really mean it
She comes closer
Edward holds his ground
She takes his hand, lifting his hat up to the peg
She's very close -- just a half-inch from kissing him when -- -- Edward gently holds her back
No
She freezes, stunned and humiliated
She pulls away
Don't
Don't be embarrassed
should never have let you think that
(beat) am in love with my wife
know
And from the moment  saw her until the moment  die, she's the only one
Lucky girl
'm sorry, Jenny
am
With that, he begins to leaves
Wait
Edward
She finds a pen and hastily signs the deed to the house
Hands it to him
With a look, he thanks her
Then goes
- Edward takes a final look at this perfect little town
(
) One day, Edward Bloom left, and never returned to the town he'd saved
He climbs in his car and starts the engine
'  - As we watch, the swamp begins to overtake the house, swallowing it in a tangle of vines and mossy branches
Shoots burst up through the planks in the porch
Snakes slither through the marsh
Day becomes night
(
) As for the girl, the common belief was that she'd become a witch, and crazy at that
She became something of a legend herself
We  to find   looking in through the rusty iron gate with flashlights
beat, then they run away
(
) And the story ended where it began
'  - Will and Jenny are still sitting at her table, a pitcher of iced tea between them
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young
No, it's logical if you think like your father
See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else
You didn't become crazy
Well, therapy
And one day  realized was in love with a man who could never love me back
was living in a fairy tale
Will smiles to hear it called that
People aren't like they are in stories
They hurt each other without meaning to
They are kind and unbelievably cruel at the same moment
Like me, now
'm not sure  should have told you any of this
Her composure is starting to break
No,  wanted to know
'm glad know
long beat, both staring at their iced tea
Jenny is working herself into more of a state by not talking
wanted to meet you for the longest time
did
(a smile) envied you so much
The way Eddie would talk about you when you were at Missouri, that award you won
Congratulations, incidentally
And when you got the job at the
, everything, he was so proud of you
mean, that's the thing
Every moment he loved you
She's fighting tears, not the first ones she's shed over this
And as brightly as the sun would shine when he was with me, every time he left it disappeared
wanted to be as important to him as you were, and  was never going to be was make-believe and his other life, you, were real
Will, sorting through his swirling thoughts
You knew that, didn't you
: '  -  / Will skips through the stations on the radio, but ultimately turns it off
He's trying to think
- Will walks up the front steps
There's a subtle change to his expression, a dark cloud lifted
He unlocks the door
- It's half-dark and quiet in the house, no talking, no
Will sets his keys on the table
- Will looks in
Empty
(calling out) Hello
Mom
Dad
- We follow Will, looking into his and Josephine's room
He aims for the guest room at the end of the hall
- Looking over his shoulder, we see his father's bed is empty
The sheets are in a tangle on the floor
beat, then Will half-runs back down the hall
Back down the stairs
- Headed out, Will grabs his keys off the table
We  , where the "" light blinks on the answering machine
- The hospital is so new, it's not even finished -- thick plastic hangs from exposed framing
There's no one at the information desk, so Will forges ahead
- Will reads a directory board, trying to decide the best place to start
Then, behind him -- (
) Will
He turns to see his wife at a payphone
She hangs up
She was calling him
What happened
Your father had a stroke
He's upstairs with your mom and Dr
Bennett
Is he going to be okay
beat
How can she answer
He half-smiles, realizing the idiocy of his question
Of course his father's not going to be okay
What  mean is, will he get back to the way he was when
She cuts him off -- No
He won't
'm sorry
And like that, it's done
We   Will, reeling from the news
- Edward sleeps peacefully, just an oxygen tube under his nose
There are no beeping monitors, no blinking lights
It's mercifully quiet
Sandra squeezes Will's hand tightly
She's holding herself together, but it's been a tough day
Dr
Bennett has just gone through the details for the third time
don't suppose one of us could stay with him
In case he
(beat) In case he wakes up, one of us should be there
'll stay
Why don't you go home with Josephine and 'll stay tonight
(to Dr
Bennett) That's okay
It's fine
(to Will) You'll call if
will
'll call
beat
Mom, do you want some time with Dad
Yes
Thank you
nod, then Will holds the door for Dr
Bennett and Josephine as they leave
Sandra is alone in the room with her husband
She neatens his hair
Holds his hand
As she kisses his fingers, she tweaks her chin with them -- his signature move
: - Sandra waits outside the women's restroom
Her face is a study in strained composure -- acknowledging the inevitable but refusing to surrender to it
Josephine emerges
'm sorry
It seems every hour have to
know
It was the same when  was carrying Will
Like clockwork
The two women start to walk, no hurry
Do you like it, being pregnant
do
loved it
It sounds peculiar, but loved every minute of it
did
Eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but  felt like  always had a piece of him with me
little part of his soul inside me
could feel it
It was alive and kicking
Sandra has accidentally evoked a storm of emotion
She struggles to keep it in check
Almost a whisper
really miss that
With a few breaths, Sandra tries to hold on
Hold back
Don't stop
Don't
beat, then Sandra finally melts
Josephine holds her
The two women stand together in the hallway, letting the moment be
- Will sits in a chair beside the bed, working through the crossword puzzle
as Dr
Bennett enters with his overcoat and bag, ready to leave for the night
Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk
It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them
My father and  have an advantage
We never talk
Dr
Bennett smiles as he checks Edward's chart
How long have you known my father
Thirty years
Maybe more
How would you describe him
(re: chart) Five-eleven
One-eighty
Regulated hypertension
(beat) How would his son describe him
Tables turned, Will searches for an answer
He doesn't have one
Dr
Bennett hangs the chart back on the bed
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born
thousand times
He caught an uncatchable fish
Not that one
The real story
Did he ever tell you that
(suddenly interested) No
Your mother came in about three in the afternoon
Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in Wichita
You were born a week early, but there were no complications
It was a perfect delivery
Now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so  can't see as it would have been much different had he been there
And that's the real story of how you were born
long silence, just the sounds of the hospital, doctors being paged
Not very exciting, is it
And suppose if  had to choose between the true version and an elaborate one involving a fish and a wedding ring,  might choose the fancy version
But that's just me
Will half-smiles
Patting Will's shoulder, Dr
Bennett leaves
We   Will and his father for a long time, then Will takes his pen and starts making a list
- Will flips to a new page
The list keeps getting longer
He smiles, remembering something
On his fourth page, he looks up at his motionless father
beat, then we slowly : - - It's very early morning, and the first blue light of day is glowing through the vertical blinds
Still in his chair, Will wakes up a bit at a time
The notepad is on his lap, the pen in his hand
He cracks his neck, crooked from sleeping on it wrong
What woke him up
He looks to his right
Holds his gaze for a breath
Dad
His father is awake, silently  for breath
His eyes are open, scared and confused
Dad
Do you want me to get a nurse
Edward shakes his head unambiguously
Will already has his finger on the orange "nurse call" button, but doesn't push it
What can  do
Can  help
Can  get you something
Water
Edward nods
Will pours a glass from the pitcher on the nightstand
He holds it to his father's lips, but Edward won't drink
He pushes it away
He wanted something else
(whispering) The river
The river
It takes Edward all his strength to put together each thought
It's like he's only half-there, fighting to hang on to this world
Tell me how it happens
How what happens
How  go
, realizing
You mean what you saw in The Eye
Edward nods
Yes, that's what he was trying to say
long beat
don't know that story, Dad
You never told me that one
Will pushes his fingers under his father's heavy hand, and holds it
There's nothing else to do
Edward looks around, confused and increasingly scared
He sees the end approaching, but doesn't know exactly what's coming
Without the story, he's lost
Fighting the urge to panic -- can try, Dad
If you help
Just tell me how it starts
Like this
Okay
Okay
Will looks around the room, increasingly desperate
He looks to the nurse call button
He really wants to press it
, waiting for Will to begin
Okay
It's morning, and you and are in the hospital
'd fallen asleep in the chair
wake up and  see you, and
: -  [ ] Dad
It's dawn, and the first golden glow is shining through the vertical blinds
(louder and concerned) Dad
We   to find a nimble Edward sitting up in bed, combing his hair
Let's get out of here
(
) Somehow, you're better
Different
You're getting ready to go
And say
Dad, you're in no condition to
But Edward throws back the covers
There's a fold-up wheelchair in the bathroom
Wrap a blanket around me
As soon as we get off this floor, we'll be in the clear
Will heads for the bathroom
Sure enough, the wheelchair is there
Hurry
We don't have much time
- With the blanket draped over his head like a ghost, Edward points for his son to steer the wheelchair thataway
Faster
They pass a  , who turns to look
Rounding a corner, they nearly crash into Dr
Bennett
Will
What are you doing
Before he can answer, Will spots Edward rolling the chair himself, pumping both arms
Will dashes to catch up with him
The Heavyset Nurse leans out of Edward's hospital room
Security
Stop them
At the elevators, Sandra and Josephine step out to find Will and Edward barreling straight at them
No time to explain
Follow us
Seeing   heading their way, a quick-thinking Sandra shoves a nearby cart into them, bowling them down
- Will brakes hard, sliding with both feet
The chair nearly crashes into the back wall as the doors close
- Will races Edward down the row, finally reaching the Chevrolet
Will lifts his father out of the chair
(
) pick you up and you hardly weigh anything
can't explain it
Will sets him in the passenger seat
Water
need water
Scrambling in back, Will finds a liter of Arrowhead
Hands it off
Edward unscrews the cap, but instead of drinking it, he douses himself
Soaks the blanket
Will pops the trunk
Starts to fold up the wheelchair
Leave it
We won't need it
as the car peals out
: -  [] Will, trying to hold back tears as he talks
And we have to take Glenville to avoid all the church traffic, because those damn church people drive too slow
Edward, enjoying that detail
He's focused completely on Will's story
ask
: -  [ ] The Chevy slaloms through the Sunday-morning traffic
(
) Where are we headed
(
) You say
- The River
Will stops short, the traffic backed up
He , trying to get around the jam
But it's no use
Then, up ahead, the cars start moving, shoved aside by massive hands
It's Karl the Giant, clearing a path by brute force
Edward leans out the window and waves
Karl waves back
- The same stretch of the river where it all began
of more than 100 waiting
(
) As we get closer to the river, we see everybody's already there
And mean everybody
Amos Calloway is here with the circus folk, including Mr
Soggybottom
We also find Edward's Mother and Father, the Mayor, and many others from along the way
No one has aged a day since we saw them last
While Ping scans the horizon, Jing nuzzles with her boyfriend, Norther Winslow
It's Ping who first spots the Chevrolet
He's here
The crowd
The Ashton marching band
Jenny Hill smiles
So does the Old Woman
We   on the Old Woman's glass eye, where we see
reflected
This is what he saw
- Amazed, Will turns to his father
It's unbelievable
Story of my life
- Will gets out of the Chevrolet, overwhelmed by the crowd
Behind him, Sandra, Josephine and Dr
Bennett pull up
Karl comes just after that
Crossing to the passenger side, Will lifts his father out
Strangely, he's gotten even lighter
Will carries him easily
Edward pulls off his shoes, tying the laces together
He hands them to Josephine
She throws them up at the powerline
They loop over
