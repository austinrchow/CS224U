Man, don't you listen to him
Having a baby is not going to ruin your life
It's not my life 'm worried about ruining
It's the kid's

Shrek stops and holds Lancelot above his head
Lancelot tries to regain his dignity

Lancelot points across the school yard
That dork over there is Arthur
He points to the  , skulking away across the school yard

One of the female students steps in front of Shrek
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 38
Ahem
This is like totally embarrassing, but my friend Tiffany thinkest thou vex her so soothly
The other girls giggle
And she thought perchance thou would wanna ask her to the Homecoming Dance or something

She's just totally into college guys and mythical creatures and stuff
She pops her gum

Oh Arthur
Come out, come out wherever you are

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 39
1 We're here for the Mascot Contest
2 Grrrrr
The Hall Monitor waves them in
Shrek gets an idea
(pleased with himself) We're here for the Mascot Contest too
The Hall Monitor reaches out and starts painfully pinching and pulling Shrek's skin
Shrek tries to hide the pain
() This is a costume
() Aaaiyyyy
worked on it all night long
The Hall Monitor lets his face snap back into place
Shrek struggles not to scream in agony
Hall Monitor is still suspicious
Looks pretty real to me
If it were real could  do this
Puss's claws snap out one at a time like jack-knives and then Puss jabs all the claws deep into Shrek's butt
Or this
Donkey kicks Shrek hard in the groin with his hind legs
Shrek winces and sweats
( ) He's right
If it were real that would have been agonizingly painful
Now watch this
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 40
(; ) That's quite enough boys
- Principal Pynchley presides over an assembly for the entire student body
He speaks through a megaphone
Thank you to Professor Primbottom for his invigorating lecture on how to just say "nay"

One is dressed up like a dragon and the other as a griffin
And now, without further ado, let's give a warm Worcestershire-hoozah to the winner of our "New Mascot" contest
the-- Shrek bursts through the double-doors of the gym
(') --ogre
The students gasp as Shrek marches forward
That's right
'm the new mascot
So let's really try and beat the other guys
at whatever it is they're doing
The band plays Smashmouth's "Rock Star
" This is indeed all a bit unorthodox
Without breaking stride, Shrek grabs Principal Pynchley's megaphone
Now, where can  find Arthur Pendragon
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 41
The students all point
to the basketball hoop, where Artie hangs helplessly
Shrek, Donkey and Puss turn and look up and see the freshly wedgied student
The students laugh
In the front row, Lancelot bumps fists with Bohort
Classic
Donkey turns to Lancelot
You should be ashamed of yourself
didn't do it
They did
Lance points to the & nerds
They are beside themselves with nasal laughter
Nosebleed boy starts bleeding again
Shrek reaches up and pulls Artie down to eye level
Please don't eat me
() Eat him
Eat him
Even Principal Pynchley gets caught up in the excitement
Eat him
Shrek yanks on Artie and pulls him off the hoop
'm not here to eat him
It's time to pack up your toothbrush and jammies
You're the new King of Far Far Away
What
The students react with surprise and disbelief

The tuba player plays a Wha-wha-wha
Burn
Everyone laughs

Absolutely
Now clean out your locker, kid
You've got a kingdom to run
So wait, 'm really the only heir
Shrek pauses for just a moment, then
The one and only
Give me just a second
Artie turns back to the crowd and delivers a heartfelt speech
My good people,  think there's a lesson here for all of us
Maybe the next time you're about to dunk a kid's head in a chamber pot, you'll stop and think, hey, maybe this guy has feelings
Maybe should cut him some slack
Because maybe, just maybe
this guy's gonna turn out to be, uh dunno
a King
And maybe his first royal decree will be to banish everyone who ever picked on him -- that's right, 'm looking at you, jousting team
Artie points and Lancelot and his buddies look horrified
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 43
And Gwen

You
You can't lie
So tell me puppet
Where is Shrek
Pinocchio thinks
() Well,  don't know where he's not
Prince Charming gets in Pinocchio's face
You're telling me you don't know where Shrek is
Pinocchio is still a little nervous
It wouldn't be inaccurate to assume that  couldn't exactly not say that is or isn't almost partially incorrect
Pinocchio thinks he has the upper hand
So you do know where he is
On the contrary, 'm possibly more or less, not definitely rejecting the idea, that in no way, with any amount of uncertainty that

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 55
can't believe it
me a King
mean  knew  came from royalty and all, but  just figured everyone forgot about me
He looks out to sea, disbelieving
Oh no, in fact, the King asked for you personally
Artie smiles
Really
Wow
Look,  know it's not all gonna be fun and games
It really is all fun and games, actually
Sure, you have to knight a few heroes, launch a ship or two
By the way, make sure you hit the boat just right with the bottle
Boat with the bottle
Any idiot can hit a boat with a bottle
Shrek chuckles sheepishly
Well, 've heard it's harder than it looks
Whoa
This is gonna be huge
Parties, princesses, castles
princesses
It's gonna be great, Artie
You'll be living in the lap of luxury
They got the finest chefs around waiting for you to place your order
Puss jumps up onto the railing next to Artie
And fortunately you'll have the royal food tasters
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 56
()) Oh yeah
What do they do
They taste the food before the King eats, to make sure it's not poisoned
Poisoned
Shrek senses trouble and immediately steps in
Or too salty
Shrek turns to Puss and Donkey, trying to shut them up
( ) Don't worry about it
You'll be safe and sound with the help of your body guards
Body guards
All of them, willing at a moment's notice to lay down their own lives out of devotion to you
Really
Si, and the whole kingdom will look to you for wisdom and guidance
Behind Artie, Shrek mouths "shut-up" to Puss and Donkey
Just make sure they don't die of famine
Or plague
Oh, plague is bad
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 57
The coughing, the groaning, the festering sores
Shrek interrupts with a mock laugh
Oh
Festering sores
Hey, you are one funny kitty cat
What did  say
We don't want Artie here getting the wrong idea
Shrek motions to Artie, but he's gone
They all look around
(') Uh, Artie
The boat suddenly pitches to the right
Shrek braces himself
Puss and Donkey tumble away
Whoa
Artie swings the wheel around, sending the boat back in the direction of his school

The drunken Ship Captain slides by
Whoa
Oh, there goes my hip
Artie
Shrek turns the wheel the other way
(') What are you doing
The boat veers again, heading back toward Far Far Away
Artie falls to the ground and slides to the back of the boat
shuffle board stick slides next to Artie

What does it look like
He jams it in the boat's wheel
The boat lurches
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 58
He swings the boat back in the other direction
Shrek rises up and grabs the wheel and turns it
This really isn't up to you
Artie falls underneath the wheel
He stands up shoving the wheel back the other way
But  don't know anything about being King
You'll learn on the job
Donkey and Puss roll across the deck
Whoaaa
Shrek grabs the wheel and swings it around
Artie yanks the wheel
They wrestle for control
Sorry to disappoint you, but 'm going back
Back to what
Being a loser
As soon as the word leaves his lips, Shrek knows he's gone too far
Stung, Artie lets go of the wheel, leaving Shrek to yank hard on it
He pulls the steering column from the decking
(') Now look what you did
Look what  did
Who's holding the wheel chief
Donkey climbs up onto the railing
He is seasick and is about to puke when he sees jagged rocks ahead
(; ) Shrek
Shrek desperately sets the wheel back down and tries to steer the ship clear of the rocks
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 59
The camera pans past the boat
Off-screen we hear the boat crash into the rocks
(
) Land ho
- Shrek, holding Puss and Donkey, staggers onto a small beach
He glares at Artie who pulls himself out of the surf
Shrek drops Puss and Donkey
Puss, tired of being wet, shakes himself vigorously
His fur puffs up into a fro
He drops his head in shame
How humiliating
Oh, nice going, Your Highness
Oh, so now it's "Your highness
" What happened to "loser
" Huh
Hey, if you think this is getting you out of anything, well it isn't
We're heading back to Far Far Away one way or another, and you're gonna be a father
Artie raises an eyebrow
Puss and Donkey stare at Shrek uncomfortably
What
(clearing his throat) -hem
You just said father
You're
said king
You're gonna be King
( ) "You're gonna be King
" Yeah right
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 60
Artie shakes his head and marches down the beach toward a path into the woods
Where do you think you're going
Far Far Away
from you
You get back here young man and mean it
Artie keeps climbing
Uh boss,  don't think he's coming back and maybe it's for the best
He is not exactly king material
Shrek looks towards Artie
When were you planning on telling him that you were really supposed to be King
Oh c'mon, now why would  do that
Besides, he'll be ten times better at it than me
Shrek starts off after Artie
Donkey jumps in front of Shrek
Hey, woah ho ho, Shrek
Then you're gonna have to change your tactics if you want to get anywhere with this kid
Beat
You're right, Donkey
Shrek picks up a piece of driftwood
What about this
Donkey shakes his head in disgust
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 61
Shrek
Shrek tosses the log
Oh c'mon
It's just a joke
() Still
Shrek walks off, trying to catch up to Artie
- Artie marches up the mountain trail
Shrek thinks for a moment and then tries a different tactic with the kid
He catches up to Artie
Listen Artie
Artie looks back over his shoulder
He sees Shrek and just keeps going
(') If you think this whole mad scene ain't dope,  feel you dude mean, 'm not trying to get up in your grill or raise your roof or whatever, but what  am screaming is, yo, check out this kazing thazing bazaby
Puss and Donkey glance at each other
Artie notices a cottage in the distance and heads toward it
mean, if it doesn't groove or what 'm saying ain't straight trippin', just say, oh no you didn't, you know, you're gettin' on my last nerve
And then 'll know it's
then 'll know it's whack-- Passing a tree, Artie nonchalantly releases the branch, striking Shrek square in the face and takes off running

Hello
Suddenly, a burst of light shoots through a candle box that is hung on the door
bright, colorful image of an old wizard's head is projected out
Donkey is terrified
() Greetings cosmic children of the universe, and welcome to my serenity circle
Shrek watches
() Please leave any bad vibes outside the healing vortex
And now prepare
With a "" and a "", the image disappears
The door opens and a tiny old man, Merlin, comes out
knew  should of gotten that warranty
Merlin smashes the security device with his little fist and is promptly zapped in the head
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 63
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow
Mr
Merlin
You know this guy
Yeah
He was the school's magic teacher until he had his nervous breakdown
Uh, technically  was merely a victim of a level three fatigue, and at the request of my therapist and the school authorities,  have retired to the tranquility of nature to discover my divine purpose
Merlin smacks a fly that has landed on his head
Shrek and Artie stare in astonishment
Now, can  interest anyone in a snack or beverage
Uh, no
Merlin offers up a baking dish full of rocks
Sure you don't wanna try my famous rock au-gratin
Merlin takes a bite and chews loudly
His gums are bleeding from eating rocks
It's organic
They both stare at him uncomfortably
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 64
Oh, thanks,  just ate a boulder on the way in
What we need are directions back to Far Far Away
What's with the "we"
Who said was going with you
Oh,  did
Cause there's a lot of people counting on you so don't try and weasel out of it
If it's such a great job, why don't you do it
Understand this kid, it's no more Mr
Nice Guy from here on out
Oh, so that was your "Mr
Nice Guy
" know, and 'm gonna miss him
You know what
Why don't you go terrorize a village and leave me alone
Oh, is that some kind of crack about ogres
You get your royal highness to Far Far Away before kick it there
( ) Now which way am  kicking
Oh,  could tell you
But since you're in the midst of self- destructive rage spiral it would be karmic-ly irresponsible
Self-destructive ra
( ) Look, are you gonna help us or not
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 65
Most definitely, but only after you take the journey to your soul
Yeah,  don't think so
Look pal, it's either that or some primal scream therapy
Ahhhhhhhhhh
Shrek grabs Merlin's mouth and closes it
Alright, alright
journey to the soul
: '  - fire blazes
Merlin throws a handful of dirt into the fire, it flares
Now all of you, look into the "Fire of Truth" and tell me what you see
Yah
Ha
(Wild war cry) Woo-looo-looo-looo
He points at the smoke and it starts to form objects (i
e
Rorschach inkblots)
Puss and Donkey, excited, sit by the fire
Ooo
Charades
Okay,  see a dutch fudge torte with cinnamon swirls
Okay
Monster, go for it
Shrek glances at the fire
The stroller from his nightmare begins to take shape in the smoke
He blows the image away
He covers his fear and changes the subject
see a rainbow pony
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 66
Excellent work
() Now
The boy
This is lame
Merlin whacks Artie on the back of the head
Ow
You're lame
Now just go for it
He tosses more dirt and flames burst up
Artie studies it
Okay
There's a baby bird and a father bird sitting in a nest
Merlin starts beating a drum
Artie's expression starts to change as he stays focused
Yes
Stay with it
Stay with it
Wait, the dad just flew away
Why did he leave the little bird all alone
Shrek starts to take this in as he watches
Artie gets more worked up
It's trying to fly, but it doesn't know how to
It
it's gonna fall
Suddenly, Artie catches what he said
As the smoke drifts away, he looks and sees everyone else staring back at him, stunned
Whew, proper head case you are, aren't you
Really messed up
Whoa
Merlin goes back inside
They all stare at Artie
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 67
Yeah, yeah, okay
get it
The bird's me
My dad left
So what
Donkey gives Shrek a nudge to go over and talk to Artie
Shrek hesitates and Donkey insists
( ) Look Artie
um- Just as he's about to get going, "That's What Friends Are For" starts playing loudly from Merlin's security device drowning out any conversation
They all turn toward the shack where Merlin peeks out
(loud, over the music) Just thought  might help set the mood
'know for your big heart to heart chat
Everyone stares at him
He sheepishly turns off the device and shuts the door
It's quiet again
know what it's like to not feel ready for something
Artie looks at him
Even ogres get scared
you know, once in a while
know you want me to be king, but can't
'm not cut out for it and never will be, alright
Shrek takes this in
(') Even my own dad knew  wasn't worth the trouble
He dumped me at that school the first chance he got and never heard from him again
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 68
My dad wasn't really the fatherly type either
Well,  doubt he was worse than mine
Oh yeah
My father was an ogre
He tried to eat me
Artie looks at Shrek
Now,  guess  should have seen it coming
He used to give me a bath in barbecue sauce and put me to bed with an apple in my mouth
Artie chuckles at this
Okay
guess that's
pretty bad
Artie laughs and then pokes at the fire
You know, it may be hard to believe what with my obvious charm and good looks, but people used to think that  was a monster
And for a long time,  believed them
Artie looks up at Shrek
(') But after awhile, you learn to ignore the names that people call you and you just trust who you are
Artie gently pokes at the embers with a stick for a moment
You know, you're okay, Shrek
He tosses the stick into the fire
You just need to do a little less yelling and use a little more soap
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 69
Thanks Artie
The soap's because you stink
Really bad
Yeah
got that
The camera slowly booms up and away from the group as the fire continues to burn
: - The Princesses, Fiona and the Queen are surrounded by darkness as they tiptoe down the steps and into the catacombs below the castle
They round a corner and step onto a ledge with Fiona leading the way, holding a torch
Oh this place is filthy
feel like a hobo
Fiona tries to keep her frustration in check
'm sorry but this just isn't working for me
Sleeping Beauty, still being carried by Doris, wakes up
Everything's always about you, isn't it
It's not like your attitude is helping, Snow
Well maybe it just bothers you that was voted fairest in the land
You mean in that rigged election
Oh, give me a break
(gesturing toward hair) () Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 70
(cont'd) "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down thy golden extensions
" Ladies, let go of your petty complaints and let's work together
Snow White and Rapunzel share an indignant look
Fiona travels deeper into the catacombs
The other Princesses follow
So  guess the plan is we just wander aimlessly in this stink hole until we rot
No, we're gonna get inside and find out what Charming's up to
know he's a jerk and everything, but  gotta admit, that Charming makes me hotter than July
Ew
Ugh
Finally, Fiona spots what she was looking for
That's it
Fiona, the Queen and the Princesses run towards a long ladder and climb up through a grate into the main castle courtyard
- They peer around a corner and see the construction of an outdoor theater is underway
Two stagehands walk by carrying a large dragon set piece
Evil dwarves are busy painting the set
The finishing touches are put on the stage tower
The Princesses hug the wall as a group of guards march by
Rapunzel takes off in the other direction, and signals the Princesses to follow her
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 71
Come on, this way
Rapunzel
Wait
Fiona and the Princesses race after Rapunzel
They spot her sprinting into the castle and follow her
They burst through the doors and see Prince Charming holding Rapunzel by the arm
Charming, let go of her
large group of armed Far Far Away Guards surround them
Prince Charming smiles at Fiona
But why would  want to do that
Grrrr
Woof
He looks back at Rapunzel lovingly, and the two share a long kiss
Fiona and the other Princesses are shocked
What
Say hello ladies, to the new Queen of Far Far Away
Cinderella claps excitedly
Yaaaaaaaaay
The Princesses stare her down
Rapunzel, how could you
Jealous much
Prince Charming eyes up the Princesses
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 72
Soon you'll be back where you started
scrubbing floors or locked away in towers; that is, if let you last the week
But Pooky, you promised you wouldn't hurt them
Not here, "kitten whiskers
" Daddy will discuss it later
Now forgive us, we have a show to put on
Shrek will be back soon Charming, and you'll be sorry
He stops and flashes a sadistic smile
Sorry
Don't you realize --once Shrek sets foot in Far Far Away he's doomed
Prince Charming leads Rapunzel out
She looks back at them apologetically
Everyone wears a look of defeat
The guards march them off
Fiona and the princesses are locked away in a prison cell
Fiona looks through the bars of the cell, feeling helpless
: - Shrek startles awake
He sits up and scratches his head, looking around
He realizes it's morning
Behind him a peaceful bird lands on a tree branch
Suddenly, the tree branch that was holding the bird flicks it off
Shrek senses the movement behind him and turns around to find everything is normal
He turns back around to wake up everyone
The trees start to advance toward Shrek
The log Artie is sleeping on suddenly sits up, knocking Artie, who is still asleep, to the ground
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 73
Ow
The tree turns around to reveal an Evil Tree
Donkey finally wakes up
Ahhh
The Evil Trees continue to advance
piano is heard
The trees part and Hook is revealed to be playing the piano
The music builds to a dramatic finale
Captain Hook turns away from his keys and faces them
Look out
They've got a piano
Kill `em all
Except the fat one
He stares hard at Shrek and aims his hooked prosthetic
King Charming has something special in mind for you, ogre
Shrek is perplexed
"King Charming
" Attack
Pirates charge forward, swinging in from the tree branches
One lands and gets his peg-leg stuck in the ground
The pirates close in
Shrek grabs one and throws him to the side
One pirate raises his sword and prepares to swing at Artie
Artie, Duck
Shrek pushes Artie's head down and the sword narrowly misses him
The pirate prepares to swing again and Shrek lifts Artie above his head
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 74
Still in the air, Artie uses both legs to kick the pirate to the ground
Shrek and Artie share a satisfied look
pirate charges Donkey
Ahhh
Puss draws his sword and begins fighting off the pirate, protecting Donkey
Ha-ha
Argh
Argh
Argh
The camera pans across the back of the piano to reveal Merlin happily playing along with Captain Hook
He notices and rudely elbows Merlin out of the way
pirate runs at Shrek, only to be tripped by Artie
The pirate bounces off Shrek's belly
Ready the plank
wooden board is thrown on a stump, creating a makeshift "plank
" The pirates back Shrek onto the plank
Several pirates with swords force Shrek onto the plank
He is backed up to the edge of the plank and falls into a waiting treasure chest below
Several pirates try to shut the lid on him
Puss, Donkey and Artie are trying to hold off the Villains
Suddenly, two Evil Trees come into frame and scoop Puss, Donkey and Artie up in a net
The pirates aim the cannon at Puss, Donkey and Artie
Artie starts to panic
Puss extracts his claws and tries to cut through the netting
The cannon fuse is lit
Shrek bursts open the treasure chest and stands up with the chest still stuck to his behind
Shrek
Help
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 75
Shrek sees the lit fuse and quickly formulates a plan
He grabs two pirates and shoves them into the treasure chest
He tosses the chest onto the other end of the plank and catapults himself over to the cannon
At the last second, Shrek is able to aim the cannon in the opposite direction
The cannon fires and hits Captain Hook's piano, blowing it into pieces
Realizing their defeat, the Evil Trees drop the netting that holds Donkey, Puss and Artie
The Evil Trees and Pirates take off running
Captain Hook turns and sees his army running off
He shakes his hook in the air
Ya cowards
What has Charming done with Fiona
She's gonna get what's coming to her
He raises his hook threateningly but it gets caught on an Evil Tree's branch and is dragged away with the rest of the Villains
Ahhh
( ) And there ain't nothing you can do to stop him
, filled with worry
Nothing else matters to him now
Artie, Puss, and Donkey run over to Shrek
We've got to save her
But she's so far far away
Shrek thinks for a moment
Get yourself back to Worcestershire, kid
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 76
No, Shrek
Hold on a second
've got an idea
'  - Merlin is sitting cross-legged, deep in meditation
Artie approaches him
() 'm a buzzing bee, buzz, buzz, buzz
Mr
Merlin, they need a spell to get them
mean, us, back to Far Far Away
Merlin stops meditating and looks out of the corner of his eye at Artie
( ) Forget it
don't have that kind of magic in me anymore, kid
How about a hug instead
Hmm
That's the best kind of magic
Artie tries a new approach
Mr
Merlin please
know you can - said, forget it
- Merlin turns and starts to walk away muttering under his breath
(') Mumble, grumble, interrupt my healing
Mumble, mumble
Artie thinks for a moment, staring at Merlin
Artie starts to sob
Merlin stops and turns around
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 77
Oh
What, what's with you
Artie continues to cry
It's just so hard
You know
They really need to get back `cause their kingdom's in trouble `cause there's a really bad man and it's just so hard
Merlin is visibly uncomfortable
'mon, take it easy
Artie's blubbering becomes frustrated and unpredictable
No
don't think you understand
There's a mean person doing mean things to good people- Oh, have a heart old man
Artie grabs him, now desperate
And they really need your help to get them back
So why won't you help them
Oh
Artie speaks one last, indecipherable line
Merlin is stunned
He doesn't know what to do
Uh, Okay
'll go and get my things
Merlin goes into his cave
Artie immediately recovers
Shrek is impressed
Piece of cake
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 78
Well, well, well
You want some eggs with that ham
Shrek smiles
Merlin returns holding a spell book
Now,  am a little rusty, so there could be some side effects
Side effects
Don't worry, whatever it is, no matter how excruciatingly painful it may be, it'll wear off eventually
think
Merlin cracks his knuckles
bolt of lighting shoots out his hands and blows up a rock next to Donkey
Ah
Oops
Donkey and Puss shoot Shrek a pleading look
Are you sure this is a good idea
Look, if Artie trusts him, that's good enough for me
Even if his robe doesn't quite cover his- Alacraticious expeditious, a zoomy zoom zoom
Let's help our friends get back, um
soon
Magic rays shoot out of Merlin's fingers
Shrek, Puss, Donkey and Artie disappear in a puff of smoke
Woah
It worked
: Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 79
- They reappear and fall out of the sky and bounce through the canopy of a large apple tree
They ping-pong through the foliage and land in a heap at the base of the tree
(moan and groan) Donkey adjusts himself, feeling hung over
(') (in Puss' body) Oh man,  haven't been on a trip like that since college
Donkey
(in Puss' body) What
Is there something in my teeth
Donkey's eyes widen
He realizes his voice is coming out of Puss' body
(in Puss' body) Huh
What the
() Oh no
Donkey (in Puss' body) grabs Puss' hat
He looks down at Puss' boots
His tail begins to twitch
(in Puss' body) 've been abracadabra'd into a fancy feasting second rate sidekick
Puss (in Donkey's body) falls from a tree next to Donkey (in Puss' body)
(in Donkey's body) At least you don't look like some kind of bloated roadside pinata
You really should think about going on a diet
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 80
(in Puss' body) Yeah, and you should think about getting yourself a pair of pants
feel all exposed and nasty
Both Shrek and Artie stare at them
strained smile pasted to their faces
They burst out laughing
Donkey joins Puss, both of them scowling
(in Puss' body) Oh, so you two think this is funny
Puss is fuming
Shrek and Artie regain their composure
() 'm really sorry guys
Don't be
You got us back kid
Shrek motions to Far Far Away, just a few miles ahead of them
He turns back to Artie
Artie smiles
Donkey takes a few awkward steps in Puss' body
(in Puss' body) Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow
How in the Hans Christian Andersen am supposed to parade around in these goofy boots
Be very careful with those - Puss is shocked by this
He tries to recover
They were made in Madrid by the finest-
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 81
(in Puss' body) Oh, you'll learn to control that
: - Shrek, Puss (in Donkey's body), and Artie rush past a welcome sign to the town that has been boarded over so it now reads "Go Go Away
" Donkey (in Puss' body) struggles to walk
His tender new feet hurt in their tiny boots
Seriously man, you need some comfort inserts or arch supports or something
(noticing Rodeo Drive) Woah
Inside the kingdom, Rodeo Drive is trashed
There is graffiti everywhere
Suddenly a carriage driven by Evil Witches comes zooming down Rodeo Drive
Woohoo
The carriage zips around a corner on two wheels
drunken Evil Dwarf is almost hit by the carriage while crossing the street
Shrek is shocked by what he sees
crash is heard off-screen
#1 Hey

and 'm gonna keep going

carriage wheel on fire rolls by a marionette theatre with Pinocchio dancing in it
Pinocchio
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 82
Shrek
Shrek and the rest rush over as the curtain starts to go down on Pinocchio
He presses his puppet hands against the glass
Pinocchio
Help me
What's happened
Charming and the Villains have taken over everything
They attacked us but Fiona and the Princesses got away
And now she's- The time has run out
The cheesy music stops as the curtain goes down
She's what
She's what
Shrek looks at the marionette theatre and sees how much it costs per show
(turns to Puss in Donkey's ) Puss, loan me five bucks
'mon Puss, you heard the man, help a brother out
(in Donkey's body) Do you see any pockets on me
(in Puss' body) Hold on a second
Donkey (in Puss' body) removes his boot, he turns it over and a bag of money falls onto the ground
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 83
(in Puss' body) Aha
Donkey (in Puss' body) tosses the money to Shrek
(in Donkey's body) had no idea
really
swear
Shrek quickly dumps the change into the machine
The music starts and the curtain goes up again and Pinocchio dances
Quick, Pinocchio
Where is Fiona
Charming's got her locked away some place secret
You gotta find him
He's probably getting ready for the --- The curtain goes down again
Wait, wait, wait
Pinocchio
What show
Pinocchio's hand comes out from under the curtain and points to a poster on the wall
Puss reads the poster out loud
(reading the poster) It's  Happily Ever After, After All
Shrek's final performance
The picture shows Charming, sword raised in the air, with his foot pinning Shrek, tongue sticking out of his mouth, to the ground
(in Puss' body) Whoa, Shrek
You didn't tell us you were in a play
Well  guess 've been so busy forgot to mention it
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 84
#1 (
) It's the ogre
Get him
Shrek turns and sees a large group of Charming's royal knights, armed and ready
They drive them back into the alley
Puss (in Donkey's body) steps forward
(in Donkey's body) Don't worry, Jefe
got this
He whips his head towards the oncoming guards
His eyes are large and sweet
His lips pout
The guards are momentarily hypnotized by his cuteness, until they realize they're staring at a donkey
The guards recoil
#2 Ugh
Kill it
Puss (in Donkey's body) immediately retreats
Artie glances at the theater poster on the wall and steps forward, confronting the guards
Look, don't you know who he thinks he is
How dare you
Shrek picks up on his plan
Donkey, we're dealing with amateurs
The guards are confused
Artie tears the poster off the wall
Shrek glances at Artie, who steps forward, yanking the poster off the wall
He's a star people
Hello
'm so sorry about this Mr
Shrek
'm gonna lose it
assume you have everything ready for tonight
You did get the list for the dressing room
Donkey marches in
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 85
(in Puss' body) Yeah, the breakfast croissants stuffed with seared sashimi tuna
Oh, and please tell me you at least have the saffron corn with the jalapeno honey butter cause our client cannot get into his proper emotional state without his jalapeno honey butter
just lost it
#1 Uh
Maybe they should talk to Nancy in Human Resources
Shrek pushes the guards aside and continues on towards the castle
(in Donkey's body) Oh, we'll have much to say to Nancy,  promise
The guards look at each other nervously
: - group of enchanted trees work on through their dance number
Two dwarfs on bungee chords helplessly swing back and forth in the rear of the stage
The camera lands on Prince Charming reading his lines next to a Shrek stand in
(reading his lines from a ) With this sword,  do- No
He starts the line over
With this sword,  do smote thee
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 86
Without looking, Prince Charming stabs the stand in, who falls to the ground
( ) ) Is that the right word
"Smote
" "Smooote
" Is that even a word actually
Maybe  should just smite him
Unseen stage hands drag the stand-in away
Let's try this again
Now
Stagehands shove another stand in onto the stage beside Prince Charming
(playing the scene out ) Shrek attacks me,  pretend to be afraid
(he fake screams) Ooh
Prince Charming does a quick mime of being afraid and chuckles
say
(he riffles through pages) "Finally the Kingdom will get the happily ever after they deserve, die Ogre", blah, blah, blah
Without looking he stabs stand in #2
He falls to the ground
Prince Charming is still frustrated
Oh
It just doesn't feel real enough yet
He throws the sword to the ground and turns toward the dancing villains who are staring at him
Who told you to stop dancing
Uh
Wink and turn, wink and turn
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 87
He throws the script on the ground and notices the stand-in
And what are you laying around for
Get up
Honestly
Prince Charming storms off
: '   -- Prince Charming storms into his colossal gold leafed dressing room, its walls covered with posters of inspirational sayings and portraits of Prince Charming in different acting roles
Slamming the door, he plops down in his throne chair in front of a dressing table and large 3-way mirror
statuette of his mother is on the vanity
He looks at it intently
Our happily ever after is nearly complete, mummy
And  assure you, the people of this kingdom will pay dearly for every second we've had to wait
Charming adjusts the mirror, revealing a reflection of Shrek standing in the doorway
Artie, Puss and Donkey stand along side him
Prince Charming quickly stands up and faces Shrek
Break a leg
Or, on second thought, let me break it for you
He walks across the room as Prince Charming backs against his dressing table
Prince Charming fumbles behind his back and pushes a button under the counter
Thank goodness you're here
was beginning to think you might not make it back in
time
Shrek picks him up by the front of his shirt and scowls
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 88
Where's Fiona
Don't worry
She and the others are safe
For now
Shrek strengthens his grip
Suddenly, a group of guards burst into the room and quickly surround Shrek, Artie, Puss and Donkey
Ow
Prince Charming smiles
Shrek looks around and realizes he's beat
He drops Charming with a thud
Prince Charming brushes himself off as the guards surround Shrek
Prince Charming walks over to Artie
smile grows across his face
Let me guess
Arthur
Artie looks indignant
He raises himself up
It's Artie, actually
This boy is supposed to be the new King of Far Far Away
Laughing, Prince Charming draws his sword and holds it up to Artie's neck
How pathetic
Now, stand still so won't make a mess
Shrek steps in
Charming, stop
'm here now, you got what you wanted
This isn't about him
Artie is confused
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 89
Then who's it about
'm supposed to be King, right
Shrek hesitates and then gathers himself
You weren't really next in line for the throne, okay
was
But you said the King asked for me personally
Not exactly
What's that supposed to mean
Shrek becomes defensive
Look,  said whatever  had to say, alright
wasn't right for the job,  just needed some fool to replace me, and you fit the bill
So just go
Artie is stunned
You were playing me the whole time
Shrek fights back tears as he punishes Artie more
You catch on real fast kid
Maybe you're not as big of a loser as thought
Puss (in Donkey's body) is about to interject when Donkey (in Puss' body) covers his mouth and signals him to stay quiet
You know, for a minute there, actually thought you - What
That he cared about you
He's an ogre
What did you expect
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 90
Prince Charming signals the guards to release Artie
He stares at Shrek one last time and heads out
Shrek lowers his head in shame
You really do have a way with children, Shrek
Prince Charming smiles and the guards lead Shrek off
'  : Shrek is led by the guards down the hallway

She stares sorrowfully at the castle in the distance
- All of the Princesses, the Queen and Fiona are locked up in the same prison cell
Cinderella is frantically scrubbing a spot on the floor to a shine
Fiona looks out the cell window towards the castle in the distance
Behind her, Snow White paces around, complaining
Had we just stayed put like suggested, we could be sipping tea out of little heart-shaped cups
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 91
Yeah
yeah, heart shaped cups
Eating crumpets smothered with loganberries
Yeah
loganberries
Shut up Cindy
Yeah, shut up
Cinderella looks down at her reflection in the floor
() No
You shut up
Just stay out of this
Who cares who's running the kingdom anyway

Fiona steps forward and challenges them
And you should all care too
Suddenly, the cell door flies open
Donkey and Puss (in each other's bodies) are tossed in as the door is slammed behind them

Everything's a little fruity in the loops right now
But what happened is, we went to high school, the boat crashed, and we got "bippity-bopity-booped" by the "Magic Man

The cat turned into a little horse that smells like feet
What's to get
( ) Huh
Who dat
Where's Shrek
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 93
Charming's got him, Princess
And he plans on killing Shrek tonight in front of the whole kingdom
Fiona's lets out a breath
Alright everyone, we need to find a way out, now

Sleeping Beauty falls asleep standing up
Snow White quickly assumes her position by lying down and puckering her lips
Cinderella dusts off a spot, sits down and crosses her legs
What are you doing
Waiting to be rescued
You have got to be kidding me
Well, what do you expect us to do
We're just four
( ) mean, three, super hot princesses, two circus freaks, a pregnant ogre and an old lady
The Queen smiles and then casually walks by the Princesses
Hmmm
Excuse me
Old lady coming through
She walks right up to the brick wall, takes a deep breath and lets out a yell
Hiiiyyyiiiaaaah
She head-butts a hole right through the brick wall
Fiona and the Princesses are impressed
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 94
// Whoa
Mom
Well, you didn't actually think you got your fighting skills from your father, did you
Fiona beams at her mother and then turns to the Princesses
Snow White points to another wall behind them
Excuse me,  think there's still one more
The Queen turns and sees the another wall barring their way
Hmmmm
The Queen hurries to the other wall
Hiiiiyah
It crumbles, revealing the outside
The princesses wince
Fiona approaches her mother
The Queen turns around, this time a little woozy, singing softly to herself
Why don't you just lie down
The Queen continues to sing to herself as she walks away
Fiona turns to the others
Okay girls, from here on out, we're gonna take care of business ourselves
Snow thinks for a moment and then glances at the other Princesses
They nod
Snow looks determined
She rips off a sleeve, revealing a Dopey tattoo
