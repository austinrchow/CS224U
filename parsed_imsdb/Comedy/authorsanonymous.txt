/  --  - North Hayworth Avenue, off Sunset Boulevard
quiet, tree- lined residential street
Note the small apartment complex set back from the curb

(
) This is where where
Scott Fitzgerald died on December 21, 1940
of Fitzgerald
His work
His life
(
) (') Fitzgerald was one of the truly great American writers of the 20th century
Tender is the Night
The Last Tycoon
This Side of Paradise
And, of course, my favorite, The Great Gatsby
But Fitzgerald ended up out here
Writing movies that never got made
Drinking too much
Alienating people
Losing his way

/  --  - Henry stands on the sidewalk
Full of promise and hope
Wears a pizza delivery outfit as he stares at the apartment, more with reverence than curiosity
: (
) stop by here sometimes--out of respect
Fitzgerald had this amazing gift

/  --  - Henry crosses the street--heading for his parked Honda
He unlocks the car
Swings open the back door
(
) But he wasted it
He wasted his talent
Henry yanks a   out of the back seat and slaps it on the outside of the driver's door:
One last glance at the fabled apartment complex

'  --   - The man (40's) and woman (30's) sit on the couch in their tastefully-decorated San Fernando Valley home
Expensive taste in clothes
Her cleavage a bit too obvious
Both seem a little uncomfortable
Uncertain

& They look off to the side, speaking to someone off-camera
We thought this was going to be a reality series
You know, like the Kardashians
They listen
Here comes the bad news
Oh
Really
documentary
This is going to be a documentary about our writing group
The whole group
Not just us, right
Not that it should be just about us
Nervous laugh
No
They look at each other:  documentary
They try to mask their disappointment
So this is going to be like--like what  saw the other night on cable
About bees mating
Or that, um, that one about the Holocaust
Colette nods, remembering
(') Pretty
Pretty-- 3
--Powerful
Powerful
Yes
Powerful
We love documentaries
We do

) (Reading) consumed totally, completely, absolutely, by endless thoughts of Yuri fondling her breast, his other hand groping her womanhood, knowing
They sit around the dining room table
Colette, convinced she's the next Amy Tan, reads aloud from her
The others all have copies in front of them
We recognize Henry, the frog waiting to become a prince, making copious notes and Alan, oh-so-proud, hanging on every word
Beaming
Three others round out the group: Younger  (early 30s)
Unshaven
Always thinks he's the coolest guy in any room
Can't avoid glances at the camera
: The   of the group (over 60) sits with his arms folded as he listens, shifting in his chair
Captain Grumpy
: Finally, the young (mid-to-late 20s), angelic,  listening intently, the one who probably stopped to rescue a cat on her way here
: 4
(') Any second that she might explode, her chastity spraying across the ceiling
Spraying across the ceiling like passionate graffiti
Natasha never thought such a moment possible
"Have  satisfied you, Natasha
" Yuri had inquired after their fourth round of vodka-soaked lovemaking
"Nyet, Not yet," Natasha stated, exhausted, but grateful
Awkward silence around the table as Colette removes her reading glasses and waits
Alan clears his throat, looking cheerful
Well

'  -                                        6 Henry's sparse studio apartment
Minimal furniture
His laptop is set up on an old door, stretched across some blue plastic crates
There are  piled everywhere
All sorts of books
And -- pieces of paper, including letters and cards and printed emails, dozens of them, are taped throughout the small apartment
We are introduced to Henry the writer: pondering over his battered laptop, pacing up and down the floor, checking his nearly empty refrigerator, stretched out on his Goodwill couch, watching
Finally, inspiration
Henry rushes to his desk and taps out a sentence or two on his computer, feeling proud for his accomplishment
(
) graduated from the University of Illinois
English major
Taught high school for a couple years, but hated it
Moved out here to be a writer

- /                                             7 As Henry's voice over continues, we see him in uniform with pizza in hand at the front door of a house
Rings doorbell
(
) work two jobs
Delivering pizzas and cleaning carpets
Good jobs for a writer

- /                                             8 Henry cleaning the carpets as the heavily-tattooed points to a dirty spot: Over here
(
) You meet lots of interesting people
9
'  -                                        9 Henry points to the letters on the wall
picks up on phrases like "We regret to inform you," or "Sorry, but this story isn't right for us," or "The Baxter Agency currently isn't accepting new clients
" (
) have two unpublished novels
Working on my third, Pizza to Go
These are my rejection letters
Rejected by agents
Rejected by publishers
When you think about it, it's pretty amazing how many ways people can reject you
10
'  --   -                10 Henry, John, Alan, Colette, Hannah, and William sit around the table
Impressive buffet of cold cuts, cheeses, and shrimp has been set out
(
) Our writing group meets every Tuesday night
Mostly at Alan and Colette's
Sometimes we rotate
John helps himself to some shrimp
Then helps himself to some more
(
) (') love coming to the group
Everyone always has such constructive feedback
It's like we're all in this together
really like the way Yuri is developing, Colette
You do
Well, if you ask John
Butzin
Can't help looking at the camera
Making sure it's on him
6
(') You're still going to have to explain why this Natasha dame goes  on her husband
Still kinda iffy to me
Another glance at the camera: Did you get that
was bothered by that, too
Why would Natasha betray a reliable, dependable husband for a washed-up young punk
All eyes on Colette
She shifts in her chair
Uncomfortable
Oh
Well
um
um
An uneasy silence
Colette is blocked--nowhere to go creatively
Her face tightens up
Bites her lip
(') Oh God
've been rewriting and rewriting and rewriting and-- Poodles
It's
No
It's not
still can't explain Natasha's motive
What's the use
'm not a writer
William to the rescue
Whoa
Whoa
Time out
The dude's good in bed
Trust me, that's all the motive she needs
Roger that
Torpedo Chapter Three
Blow it up
Get the focus back on this broad--Natasha
--Yes
was thinking the same thing
Make it clear that Natasha wants to be closer
Colette makes notes furiously, nodding in agreement
7
(
) Writing can be such a solitary existence, so it's good to have this outlet where you can meet other writers and exchange ideas
Here it really is all for one and one for all
11
'  --   -                11 Later that evening
Meeting is over
Alan, Colette, Hannah, Henry, William, and John are all standing up now
William stretches
John reaches for more shrimp
Friendly banter
Laughter
Who wants coffee
Everybody does
William taps Henry on the shoulder
Lend me ten bucks
'm having cash flow issues
Sure
Thanks, bro'
You're the best
12
'  -                                        12 Henry sits at his desk, staring at the blank computer
Lost in thought
Emphasis on lost
(
) This new novel Pizza to Go is about Scott, a pizza delivery guy in
He comes across some interesting characters
like what  have so far, but it's only a hundred pages and 'm stuck
13
'  -  -                              13 Henry stands in front of the mirror in his apartment, wearing the Pizza Starz hat and shirt
Ready for work
(
) Haven't written a word in the last two weeks
Not one
Hannah teases me about having writer's block

14
'  --   -                14 to the last group meeting
Focus on Hannah
Her smile
Her warmth
She listens and comments
Actively engaged in the conversation
(
) keep thinking about her
She's all  think about
Really would like to ask her out
15
'  -                                       15 Hannah reaches for a pair of   and slips them on
Talks to someone
What do you think
On or off
Do they make me look smarter
need a new pair
She takes the glasses off
Puts them back on
Off again
Debating
Hannah prepares herself with a series of quick breaths and waves her hands in the air
Then she stares directly into the camera
(') Hi
'm originally from Prescott, Arizona
Followed my mom out here about four years ago
That's her back there
Camera picks up a wisp of a  (over 50)in the background, waving, with an equally pleasant smile

Not her fault

#1 -                                            16 William favors jeans and faded tweed jacket
Sits in the corner of a Valley restaurant, nursing a cup of coffee and talks to the camera
What do you want to know about me
'm 27
Single
virgin
He flashes that wicked, seductive smile
9
(') Just kidding
'm actually 28
Hometown is Modesto, California, sprawling junk heap of a town without a soul
Why did  come to
Um, because  knew you were here and that you'd loan me a hundred bucks if  needed it
Right
#1 refills his coffee cup
Her reward is that smile
(') Thanks, babe
She walks away
William admires the view
(') already got her number
Maybe 'll text her
Maybe  won't
Eyes back towards the camera
(') So 'bout that hundred bucks
What d'ya think
hint of desperation in his voice
(') What about fifty
'mon, bro'
Support the arts

'  --                                     17 Hannah continues talking to the camera
Maureen still in background
've always had this knack for telling stories
Ever since  was a kid
She's a natural
Moved here
Took a couple writing classes
Decided to go for it
24/7
Total dedication to my craft
The writing always comes first
My latest effort is called Sleeping on the Moon
It's about rejection
And pain
Not really about the moon itself

She searches for the word that escapes her
Maureen to the rescue
Metaphor
Right

#1 -                                            18 William continues talking to the camera
So
'm here because of Bukowski
Charles Bukowski
Greatest writer ever
Period
of Charles Bukowski

If 'm gonna be a writer, then  have to walk in Bukowski's shoes
Experience and capture the plight of the working class
He waves to  #1
(') like the people in the group
But they can't write worth shit
But, man, Hannah is something
She's the only reason  keep going
Not because 'm learning anything
Hell, no just think she's hot
19
'  --                                      19 Hannah leans forward towards the camera, as if to hear better
My favorite writer
Favorite writer
Favorite writer
Hannah goes blank
The smile disappears as her face goes into noticeable contortions
This is worse than Final Jeopardy
She turns quiet, squirming
(') Favorite
Wow
Hard to say
've studied Composition more than actual Literature
Gee
know Maureen enjoys Jane
11
Searching for a last name, Hannah looks back to Maureen for help
Jane Austen
That's the one
hear she's good
But my favorite writer
Let me think about that a bit,
Short beat
Hannah lowers her voice, almost a loud confessional whisper
(') didn't go to college

'   -                                    20 John is holding court at his mobile home, showcasing the finest in furniture from Sears
John stuffs his home with various  --photos, equipment, books
He's got it all
John talks to the camera
Everything John
Butzin knows about writing comes down to two simple words: Tom Clancy
Yes, sir
Tom Clancy
The man's a genius
Does his research
All those nitty-gritty technical details
Now that's writing
John
Butzin has one agent very interested in Roaring Lion
And a publisher up in Oxnard is looking at it as we speak
Plus a certain cousin's best friend has a neighbor who has an in with Clint Eastwood, so Hollywood might be calling soon
Don't know how the other members of the writing group will handle all this success by one person
They better not be pussies
21
'  --   -               21 Alan and Colette remain on the couch
Talking to the camera
All smiles
Much more comfortable with the camera
Well, 'm an optometrist in Glendale
And  write full-time
12
Our last name's Mooney
You could call us Mooneys
We get that joke all the time
The couple giggle at the joke
Forced
(') Which writer do  admire
Hmmm
How about John Grisham
Look at all that money he's made
Just teasing, John
We know you deserved every dime, but, hey, John, could you spread it around a bit, pal
Alan likes to tease
She gives her husband an affectionate squeeze
Colette, here, is the real writer
'm more of an idea guy
come up with great ideas, but don't always follow through
'll show you
He picks up his mini-digital Olympus  off the coffee table
Thinks for a second
(') (To recorder) Idea for romantic novel
Alan catches himself
(') No
Make that, idea for romantic ebook
He winks at the camera--showing he's hip to the jargon
(') Possible movie option, too: Frovers
They couldn't be friends
They couldn't be lovers
So they became Frovers
Satisfied, Alan turns off the recorder
22
'  -                                        22 Colette opens the sliding glass door and steps out into a beautiful garden area
Quiet and private
Camera follows her over to a solitary

This is where  come for inspiration

Write in my journal
Set out my creative path for the day
This is my Walden Pond
Colette sits down on the bench
Takes in the environment

'd have to say Joan Didion
Her writing sends shivers down my spine
Though Joyce Carol Oates has been known to bring me to actual orgasm

They exchange puzzled looks
25
'  -                                        25 Back to the present

Oh, this
keep Oprah out here for luck
She's done so much to help writers

Colette can already see the moment in her mind

Then she looks off-camera--listening to someone

Oprah doesn't have a  show anymore

Tonight's the night

Henry becomes lost in thought
Regroups

She likes me-- think
've got to take action
Still stuck on Page 100
So 'm asking Hannah out on a date tonight

'  --   -                  27 Alan sits in his favorite chair, talking directly to the camera
'm the group leader
After all, getting together was my idea
They're all my patients
That's how we met
First one published gets a free eye exam
Alan cackles a bit too hard at that joke
He listens to a question being asked
(') Why did  form the group
To help Colette
Oh,  certainly enjoy the creative process, but Colette
Writing is her dream
'd do anything for her because
because she's my dream
So there you have it
Alan reaches for his tape recorder
(') Possible names for future characters

No, wait
Make that Anthony
Gilmore
Much better
Slate McCoy

Alan, Colette, William, John, and Henry gather around the center table
The    poster is propped up against a nearby empty chair
Hard not to notice the   at the table
Hannah is missing
Waitress #1 pours coffee all around
Henry fidgets in his chair, focused on the empty chair
(To William) How come we never chow down at your place
This is my place
Close to the working people
John rolls his eyes
Where's Hannah
Anyone know
Nobody responds
Alan checks his watch
Time to get started
Shouldn't we wait for Hannah
Let's go, people
'm ready to read
William's right
We'll start
She'll show up
William starts passing out pages
Henry eyes the empty chair
Colette looks over William's pages
There are only three
She has a puzzled look
16
William, aren't these the same pages you read last time
Nope, they're different
They look the same
They're different
changed a word
One word
That's it
Writing is rewriting, Colette
Bukowski said, "Write five words
Rewrite seven
" No
Dorothy Parker said that
One word
Jesus
Christ
It's my creative vision, John
(Jumping in) Which we are here to support
This is William's decision
Let me just read
See if you can pick out the word
Tell me if it's better, or worse
(Muttering) One goddamn word
Henry continues staring at the empty chair

John stands up to stretch
Alan slides papers into his leather satchel
'  remains empty
Henry remains concerned

It's not like her to miss
The mystery is quickly solved
Front door opens
In rushes Hannah, dashing directly towards the others, looking harried
'm so sorry
'm so sorry for missing the meeting
What happened
Your car break down
You oversleep
Maureen
Is Maureen
People
'mon
Look at her
That glow
Hannah met a guy
She got laid
Hannah gives William a playful smack on the back
As a matter of fact,  did meet a guy
Told ya
His name's Brian
Check out Henry
He looks absolutely horrified
No
Hannah takes a deep breath and flashes a smile the size of the Grand Canyon
(') He's my new agent
She remembers the camera
(') (Directly to camera) An agent
've got an agent
Surprise and silence
The writers look at each other and then back at Hannah
Not quite sure how to react
18
Stunned as Hannah turns her attention back to the group
(') That writing class  took
Well, for the final project,  turned in the first chapter of Sleeping on the Moon
guess the teacher liked it
Then he gave it to his friend who's an agent
Brian
He called
Had to see me right away
Brian wants to sign me
Bet Brian wants more than that
Playful smack from Colette to William on the shoulder: Behave
That's so great, Hannah
salute you, young lady
And he does
Yes
Fantastic
Fanntasstic
Henry takes it all in quietly, unable to speak
Alan bounces up and gives Hannah a big hug as the others immediately start peppering her with questions

(Raising cup) To Hannah
Everyone clinks their cups together
Thank you
But  just want to remind everyone that we're all in this together
couldn't have come this far without the group
19
(Smiling) All for one
But our camera picks up on the individual writers and something is amiss
Everything seems a beat off
People appear happy, but a little subdued
The joy seems a bit too forced
'm merely the first one to get signed
But we're all going to have an agent soon
Well, as a matter of fact, there's an agent in Santa Monica very interested in John
Butzin
He's reading the manuscript as we speak
The others let John's remark pass without comment
William taps Henry on the shoulder
(Lower voice) Hey, can you lend me ten bucks
Henry is still a bit dazed by this unexpected turn of events
Sure
Thanks, bro'
You're the best
Henry's eyes can't leave Hannah

Alan carries his sign
William makes a move towards Hannah, but the the ever- protective Henry grabs her gently by her elbow, cutting William off
They start walking in one direction
William and John head out in the other
Meanwhile, Alan and Colette wave enthusiastically to Hannah
Congratulations again, Hannah
Yes, yes
Way to go, Hannah
20
(Calling back) Thank you
'Night
Alan and Colette continue to smile and wave until Hannah is out of ear shot
Well, Hannah's got an agent
Short beat
She must have slept with him
Of course she did

She unlocks the front door of her clunker-of-a-Ford as Henry waits
'm so proud of you, Hannah
Your turn will come, Henry
You're a better writer than  am
So much better
You went to college
Hannah looks directly into the camera, pointing to Henry
(') He's a great writer
Henry Obert knew him when
Henry, clearly embarrassed, puts his hand up to block the camera
Tries to change the subject
Listen
Maybe some afternoon we could go for a drive
There are some special places 'd like to show you
Sure

21
What
Four years
It's been four years since  moved here
And now  have an agent
It's the number four again
My lucky number
should have known this was going to happen
There is no one more deserving
Hannah rewards Henry's praise with a peck on the lips
And a warm hug
Hannah steps in her car, starts it up and rolls down the window
'm going to dedicate my novel to you

He sighs

My novel is called Nyet, Not Yet
It's about a Russian woman who comes to this country in search of love
It was inspired by a story  heard from one of my massage clients, Yuri
Yes, it's true-- used to do massage
In fact, that's how  met Alan, though certainly didn't give him the kind of massage he really wanted
At least not the first time
Colette allows herself a slight smile at the memory

Satisfied, Alan puts the recorder away and reaches for another pair of glasses
You know this great idea for a novel hit me this morning

Alan tries the second pair on Hannah

Then she shows Henry
They both shake their head: No
It is a funny moment between friends
They laugh as Alan reaches for pair #3

Could be a winner
Alan puts the third pair of glasses on Hannah
She checks herself in the mirror, finally liking what she sees
She looks over towards Henry

Poor Henry
She does look good
He's falling even harder for her by the moment

You look great, Hannah
Hannah can't decide
She studies herself in the mirror as Henry studies her

Question: You think your agent might be interested in this idea
Does he have a dog
(Evading) Oh

It could be a cat
Um
Sure
Probably could be
Think about mentioning it to your agent,

It's about hormone replacement for women
Do you think John
Butzin would write that
Must be from another goddamn book
So what the hell you going to do about this
You, sir, are dealing with a decorated veteran-- a combat veteran--of the United States Army
John waits for an explanation
(') Yes
'll hold
John looks again at his book in disbelief
Then he remembers the camera
Forces a faint smile

That's all
All that truly matters is that John
Butzin is finally a published author
But catch Sigrid's expression
She is quiet
More than a little concerned at what she is hearing

#2 -                                              61 Henry and Hannah at a table, sharing coffee
Eudora the waitress swings by with a refill, hair purple as ever
Hannah thumbs through her copy of Gatsby, looking interested
And pleased
Eudora notices the book
Great book
Classic
Henry nods in agreement
Eudora moves on
Oh,  needed this break
Thank you, Henry
You're welcome
It's just that 'm starting to feel the pressure, you know
There is so much riding on this first book
50
Don't be silly
Sleeping on the Moon will hit the bestseller list
You'll be the toast of the literary world
And 'll come over to Beverly Hills and deliver a pizza to you

Hannah still has her copy of Gatsby
Short beat
What a dear, sweet friend you are
Hannah graces Henry with another hug
Another quick peck on the lips
But wait--Henry wants more
He kisses her back
More than a peck
Too much more
Hannah, surprised, pulls back--her hand on his chest: Stop
(') (Gently) No distractions
The writing comes first, 'kay
Henry nods reluctantly: Understood
One last hug from Hannah before she heads for her front door, smiling back over her shoulder at Henry
Henry watches her leave, knowing that this was absolutely, positively, the best day of his life

Maureen, trying not to be in the way, goes from writer to writer, carrying a large
Alright
Whose turn is it to read
Henry
All eyes on Henry
He shifts uncomfortably in his chair

Oh
Um
Someone else go
don't have anything new ready tonight
Concerned looks all around
It's been weeks, Henry

Still can't focus
Don't be a pussy, Obert
Get writing
Complete the mission
Writer's block can be very serious, John
John scoffs in disbelief
Maureen offers William some veggies
He helps himself and checks out Maureen as she moves on to Alan
What's so hard, bro'
mean, you've got Scott and Christy
Two friends
Tell their story
That's the problem
think the story's changing
Changing
How so
Lately 'm feeling something much deeper, much richer
Scott and Christy, um, growing closer
The other group members appear puzzled
Christy's a beautiful, wealthy author in Beverly Hills
How close can they get
Follow me
Something happens
Christy has an epiphany
She-She realizes her feelings run much deeper now for Scott
52
Henry does everything he can not to look at Hannah
Short beat
Nah
Don't buy it
They're friends
Why muck it up
Don't put 'em in the same foxhole
Is this Scott wanting to go beyond the friendship
There's no way Christy would suggest it
What do you think, Hannah
Yes
Hannah, what do you think
All eyes go back to Hannah
She does not want to answer
Gee, - guess
really never thought of them that way
Never
Hannah shakes her head
Chooses her words carefully
No
It's always been a friendship
Henry takes a moment
Thinking
You don't see anything possibly happening between them
No
Friends
Nothing more
Exactly
'd be uncomfortable with any changes in the relationship
Message received
All eyes on Henry
Defeated
Thanks, everyone
'll try to have something on paper next time

Remember, Obert
Complete the mission

Writing group starts breaking up
William leans in close by Hannah
(Lowered voice) Got a sec
William motions Hannah over to the corner of the living room, away from the others
She follows, looking puzzled
Henry watches with curiosity
William starts speaking to Hannah in hushed tones, trying not to let anyone else overhear the conversation
How much
More hushed tones from William
Hannah shakes her head
(') But if  loaned you money, then wouldn't have it
Hey,  just figured, you know
You got that big advance
Help out a fellow writer
'm good for it, Hannah
Sorry
It's bad luck to loan money
, then, just give it to me
Henry makes a point of moving in and standing directly by Hannah, staring William down
Henry and Hannah make eye contact
Henry looks to her: Are we
Hannah looks away
Colette comes up next to William
How much do you need
William looks surprised

Hannah reads from her typed pages
Alan, William, Colette, and Henry hang on her every word
John is half-listening at best, more interested in the he's thumbing through
William     and gently squeezes Colette's hand
Surprised, she pulls her hand away
(Reading; with feeling) "Please come home, Michael
" "Why would you want to marry me, Kyra barely graduated high school
" "Michael,  don't care about some silly college degree
You're the most intelligent person 've ever known
You are my shining star
" Then Colette puts it back and squeezes William's hand
It's his turn to be surprised
Hannah slides off her new reading glasses, waiting for someone to react
The room falls silent
Alan steps in
Comments
Anyone
No response
Group members look at the pages
At each other
No one steps forward

We're all in this together, right
Nobody bites
(') Colette--Did the new scene work for you
Colette seems thrown by the direct question
56
Oh
Gee
Hannah
What

This is being published
But my editor wants rewrites
Am on track
Colette punts
Alan jumps in to save his wife
Of course you are, Hannah
You got the deal
You got the check
First one to be published
John    rather loudly: What about me, butthead
William ignores him
think what 'm hearing from the group is
is
you're fine
We all love it
Nothing here to critique
You don't need us--well, it's not that you don't need us, but, you know
Alan's voice trails off before he can dig himself any deeper
More silence as Hannah wrestles with this unexpected reaction
Finally looks to Henry for help
What do you think, Henry
All eyes on Henry
He hesitates
Then -- Yes
Actually, it is really good, but there are a couple things--little things--'d point out
For example-- Holy Douglas MacArthur -- All eyes on John

His tape recorder sits on the coffee table
Alan reaches for it
She grabs it from his hand and throws it
William sits at the counter of Restaurant #2, drumming his fingers on the legal pad, half-heartedly trying to write
#3 pours him some more coffee, trying to make eye contact with him
William ignores her
John sits in front of his computer screen, but he can't concentrate

Acts like the Terminator in his scanning of the area
Man on a mission
What is he looking for
He finds it almost immediately, zeroing in on Colette's bench
Alan marches over and grabs Colette's prized framed photo of Oprah
Clutching it in his hand, Alan looks at Oprah's smiling face, then back towards the house
Then he takes the frame and smashes it down on the ground as hard as he can
Next he jumps up and down on the smashed frame multiple times
Not satisfied, Alan bends down, picks up the photo and rips it to shreds with his hands

She's right
You act the part

You don't do the work

Her face is anguished
Finally -- (') This isn't a good time
Call me later
Yes
'll think about it
Yes
Bye
Hannah turns off her phone
Alan, Colette, Henry stand there, gaping jaws wide open
Amazing
This isn't fair
This just isn't fair
What
First, you get an agent
Then you sell your book
Then the big movie deal
Please don't
No
This isn't fair
And now Richard Benedict wants to have coffee with you
All this is happening to you
And only you
Isn't there anything -- don't know--some kind of cosmic creative crumb for the rest of us to nibble on
don't like what you're suggesting, Colette
You know how hard  work
How devoted  am
And  have been totally supportive of your writing
've encouraged you all along
72
You wouldn't introduce me to your agent
Brian didn't want to meet you asked
Hannah has earned her success
Butt out Mr
Idea Man
Hannah is a writer
She devotes herself one hundred percent to writing
Not one hundred percent to sleeping with writers
Henry steps in
Finally
Why don't you two just go on ahead
It's not fair that she be the only one
Go
'mon
Let's go
Colette marches off in a huff; Alan in pursuit
She looks over her shoulder, shouting back at Hannah

Hannah takes a breath and finally breaks her silence
Your writer's block
Yeah
It's because your focus is always on everything else
Gatsby
Fitzgerald
Me
Whoa
Henry isn't about to argue
(') Listen to me, Henry Obert
Your writing must come first
Take this passion you have
Put it on the page
Forget everything else
All you're doing is wasting

Hannah continues the lecture, speaking from the heart
(
) She's right
But  know what's really happening here
Hannah's telling me she has every intention of talking to Richard Benedict
She has every intention of seeing him

-                                          93 There
On the discount table up by the cash register lies a pile of Roaring Lion books under another handmade : 50% Sigrid stares at the pile of unwanted books in quiet contemplation
Heavy sigh
Sigrid glances up
Her boss watches her from the cash register with a certain longing
He smiles
Sigrid returns the smile
Back to business
Sigrid pulls a wad of   from her hip pocket
Counts quickly
Then picks up John's books, one by one
94
'   -                                      94 John looks like the proverbial kid in a candy store
In total shock as he clutches a handful of
Wow
All the books sold at the hardware store
Ja
Every one
John claps his hands together
There is a certain spring in his feet
Didn't  tell you, Strudel
Write it and they will read
John can't contain his enthusiasm as he paces the mobile home, his mind racing
Sigrid is more composed
(') Get some more copies down there
Maybe do another signing
Yeah
No
Time for a real tour
Fresno
Bakersfield
Stockton
Call a few bookstores
Let 'em know John
Butzin is coming
Lock and load

And he's off, leaving the frame, already planning his big adventure, leaving Sigrid alone
Facing the camera, she nods slightly
Then offers us a small wave

-                                       95 The small reception area for The Lois Piper Agency
Tastefully decorated
constantly chirping
The young   behind the counter, obviously paid to be patient, points to the framed sign on the counter, in large letters:
Colette and Dr
Xiroman will not be deterred
She holds a thick

Piper
We just need five minutes
1-2-3-4-5 minutes of her time
The assistant points back to the sign
(') Can you just please stick your head in her office, tell her that Colette Mooney is here
know she's busy, but she'll certainly want to see my manuscript
The assistant ignores her
(') (Flustered) 'm a graduate of Mills College
Behind them, coming from the inner office, we hear (
) If  have to read one more vampire story,  swear 'll drive a stake through my own goddamn heart
comes flying out of her office
Loose pages splatter everywhere in the main office
Lois Piper quickly follows
Older
Tired
Needs a drink
Now
: 76
(') Vampires
Zombies
Harry Potter knock-offs
People writing about their dogs
Just shoot me now
It is at that moment when Lois first notices the camera
Caught off-guard
What the hell
Colette cranes her neck over the assistant
Ms
Piper
Ms
Piper
Lois turns her attention to Colette
Who are you
Then-- magically--Lois changes
big smile replaces the scowl
She marches towards Colette, who is clearly not expecting a warm reception
Lois walks right past Colette and instead warmly shakes hands with Dr
Xiroman
Dr
Xiroman
can't believe you're here
How lovely to see you again
Dr
Xiroman nods his head in greeting
(') Just in the neighborhood
Please come in for a minute
Another glance at the camera
Then, taking Dr
Xiroman by the elbow, Lois guides him back towards her office, completely snubbing a bewildered Colette
(') My family talks about you all the time
You were so helpful to my sister
She's doing much better
Colette stands there helplessly, watching her future walk away
The assistant points in their direction: Get in there
96
-                                           96 Lois plops down behind her desk
Stacks of  cover her desk
Dr
Xiroman sits quietly in one chair
Colette sits next to him
(Sighing; Distraught) Look at my desk, Dr
Xiroman
Look at all this
Do you know what it is
Crap
It's all crap
Crap
Crap
Crap
hate my job
hate my life
77
Dr
Xiroman nods:  understand
(') Know what  feel like doing
She looks at the camera
(') Come in closer
want you to get this
Closer
'mon
More
Closer
Satisfied, Lois takes her free hand and off her desk, sending them flying on the floor
(') Wheeeeee
Colette looks aghast
Lois seems free at last
(') That was so
liberating
haven't felt this good since that night in Paris with Salman Rushdie
Lois growls like a tiger at the memory
(') envy you, Dr
Xiroman
Know that
Look at your life
Your work
You helped my sister
You've helped so many people
You have such a positive message to share
The camera picks up on Lois as the light goes on, the wheels start turning in her head
(') Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
positive message to share
Helping people
That's it
(Confused) What
Of course
Dr
Xiroman, you should write a book
This could be a whole series
But-- 78
--It's perfect
Television
Your own blog
Personal appearances
But-- Dr
Xiroman has no reaction
Colette can't believe what she is hearing
Getting from Xiro to One by Doctor Xiroman
Oh,  like that
But-- --In fact, as long as you're here today, why don't we just get you under contract
know just who to call in New York
But--But
What about me
Lois shoots her a look: What about you
Colette backs down-- not wanting to spoil the moment
Lois yells for her assistant
Finally a slight smile crosses Dr
Xiroman's face
97
-                                             97 Dr
Xiroman beams as he signs the standard agency contract so quickly drawn up for him
Lois and her Assistant appear equally excited
fidgets off to the side
Then Lois hands her the pen and points her towards the contract

) Co-Authors
Actually 'll be listed as junior author
It's not exactly what  wanted, but at least now finally have an agent
And a book deal

Checks his delivery list
Stares at the next address in sudden disbelief
Shit

Finally rings doorbell
Pause
Followed by Door swings open
Richard stands there, wearing only his jeans
His hair is a mess
You're late, Pizza Boy
Richard finally notices the camera
(') What the -- (Overlapping) They're with me
Your total comes to nineteen dollars and sixty-five cents
Richard pulls a crumpled twenty from his jean pocket
He hands it to Henry
Then reconsiders, calling inside
Babe,  need a single
No response
(') 'mon, babe
Got a dollar for Pizza Boy
' Coming
Richard gives a last glance to the camera
He's got better things to do
Off he goes
Short beat
Hannah comes to the door wearing Richard's shirt and little else, carrying a single dollar bill
Here you-- Her words freeze up as she recognizes Henry
Henry and Hannah lock eyes for a long beat
Poor kid
This is the moment
80
Reality smacks him in the face
Hard
Hannah starts to hand Henry the money
He puts his hands up: No thanks
Hannah doesn't press
Henry can't hold back any longer
No distractions
The writing comes first
He's making me a better writer
Yeah
bet he is
Quietly seething, Henry nods towards the camera
(') How much better are you, Hannah
Show us
Who wrote Slaughterhouse Five
'ya know
Henry
Don't
No, No
This could be quite educational
How about Native Son
Catch-22
Why isn't it enough that 'm your friend
Lord of the Flies
Portnoy's Complaint
Do you know any author
Harry Potter--You must know Harry Potter
Why isn't it enough that  believe in your writing
--Sophie's Choice
Anything published in the English language
--That  believe in you
You didn't read Gatsby, did you
Never even opened it,  bet
81
Enough
'm not-- She hesitates
Not for long
(') 'm not the one delivering pizzas for a living
Score one for Hannah
(') 'm not the one wasting my talent
You've read all those books, sure, but my book is being published
Is yours
Henry has no comeback
Hannah stares him down
The dollar bill drops from her hand on to the ground
She retreats back inside the house, firmly closing the front door, leaving Henry alone
Only then do we notice the number of the house: 4441
101
'  -                                    101 We've never seen Henry like this
He rips down all his Richard Benedict photos from the wall
Collects all his Benedict books
Stuffs everything in a
Next he turns his attention to all the rejection letters on the wall
Lot of rejection
Gives them a long look
Then he snaps up the photo of Hannah from near his computer
He takes the photo and tacks it dead center in the middle of all his rejection letters
Henry stares at the photo, oblivious to the camera, consumed by Hannah's radiant smile
His latest, and most painful, rejection
It's over
Henry understands what must be done
He goes over to his desk
Sits down at his laptop
One last glance over at Hannah's photo as he turns the computer on
He contemplates for a second
Then begins typing

Sigrid's chair is empty
John sits by himself
This is a softer, more reflective, John talking to the camera
Well, Strudel shipped out
side glance to the empty chair
(') Oh, she wanted to stay, but didn't have time for a relationship
Not with my book selling like it is
She, well, she became collateral damage
Hated to end it
What a dame

Sigrid
She had the smarts of my first wife
The body of my second wife
Thank god she wasn't anything like my third wife

Good acting, John
He looks back to the empty chair
Can't avoid reaching over and giving the arm rest a little love tap

Salutes himself

'  --   -                105 Meeting of the writing group
Not yet started
John, Alan, and Hannah sit around the table
No refreshments being served
No small talk
Everyone is quiet
Hannah looks fantastic
More makeup
Nicer clothes
Fidgets in her chair
Seems anxious
Stares at her new

approaching
It's Henry
Looks determined
Man on a mission
Carries a satchel
Sorry 'm late
83
John grunts something
Hannah remains quiet
Avoids eye contact with Henry
Henry reaches into his satchel and pulls out stapled, typed pages
Multiple copies
Hands one to each of the three group members
Puts another down where Colette will sit
Wutch you got here, Obert
New pages
'm ready to read
Way to go, Henry
Even Hannah looks surprised
She and Alan thumb through their copies
John sniffs at the front page
Henry slides in across from Hannah
Looks satisfied

Xiroman in tow
Xiroman
The others exchange puzzled glances
Christ
What's he doing here
've invited Doctor Xiroman to join our writing group
You must be joking, Colette
am not joking
And, as a matter of fact, 'll have all of you know that the doctor and  are soon to be published authors
We've signed with The Lois Piper Agency
Colette stands there, waiting for the applause and congratulations, but all she receives is stunned silence
You can't do this
Why not
With William gone, we have an opening
Henry's right
We all have to agree on new members
don't care about your silly rules

Surprise all around
Hannah avoids looking at Henry

Richard is going to mentor me
Today's the 22nd
Two plus two equals four and we all know four's
Her voice trails off
Why bother explaining
Just do it
(') Anyway, 'm quitting
There
She said it
Hannah looks so relieved
She's done
Indignant, Colette stares her up and down
85
Points to Dr
Xiroman
Well, in this case one plus one equals one very successful writing team can't believe you, Hannah
You're doing this just to upstage our news about landing an agent
Stop it
No, this is what it's all about
The spotlight always has to be on Little Miss Sunshine
Her agent
Her book deal
Her movie deal
John shoots to his feet
News flash for you all
John
Butzin is also saying Sayonara
Heading off on my international book tour
International
Damn straight
Tijuana
(Beat) 'm done with you pussies
John snatches up his folder and marches out of the house
Silence
Colette starts to sit down at the table--motions for Xiroman to join her
Final straw for Alan
Stares directly at Colette
Get out
Now
Colette can't believe what she's hearing
(') As the leader of this writing group, 've determined your actions are contrary to our stated purpose
Get out
You can't kick me out
live here
She's right
Alan considers his options
86
Fine
Then go to your room
Points to Xiroman
(') And take him with you
Won't be the first guy
Alan means business
Colette stands up straight
Gathers up her materials
We'll certainly have plenty to discuss in therapy
Go by yourself
'm done
Oh
Just like always--Alan finishes first
She grabs Dr
Xiroman's arm
(') Come, Dr
Xiroman
'm looking forward to working with a real doctor
On our new book
Colette and Dr
Xiroman disappear
Frustrated, Alan takes a deep breath
Reaches inside his coat pocket for his recorder
Turns it on
Idea for novel
Alan hesitates
Thinks for a second
Turns off the recorder
Slides it across the table to Henry
(') Here
Take it
Maybe you can use some of my ideas in your novel
Alan flashes a "thumbs up" sign to Henry and to Hannah
He starts to leave, but remembers the camera
(') (To camera) This was supposed to be a reality series
That's off his chest
Alan leaves Henry and Hannah alone at the table
Awkward silence
87
He stands up
Calmly puts his typed pages back in his satchel
Leaves Alan's recorder on the table, walks away without looking back
Henry
Don't waste your breath
He's gone

-                                               106 Hannah's book release party
Great turnout
Her professional adorns a  announcing the publication of Sleeping on the Moon
Boy, Hannah looks terrific in that photo
Richard hovers around the makeshift bar, drink in hand
Maureen, looking radiant, accepts the congratulations of well-wishers
prominently centered has piles of Hannah's novel, waiting to be signed
Hannah talks to the camera, looking especially radiant
This is her day and she is more than ready for her close-up
Totally different in wardrobe and appearance
Exciting, isn't it
'm so nervous
don't know half these people
Most of them are Richard's friends
Hannah waves to Richard
He waves back
Hannah glances around the room, as if looking for someone in particular
(') Nobody's showed up from my old writing group
Not one
Probably shouldn't be surprised
Haven't really heard from anyone in months
She is asked a question
(') Favorite writer
You keep asking me that
Too funny
Sorry
Still can't think of one
107
-                                               107 Hannah sits behind the table, signing books
Maureen stands behind her helping to orchestrate the line of people
Hannah acts very gracious
Signing a book, smiling and chatting up the guests
She seems at ease
Everything is going her way
She looks past the line
Her eyes light up and she jumps to her feet
88
Oh my God
Hannah bolts from the table, cuts through the line and finds Henry standing alone
Hi, Hannah
Henry
Ohhhhh
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you so much for coming
Hannah throws her arms around Henry, giving him a long heartfelt hug, almost smothering the poor guy--not that he complains
She lets go and gives Henry a friendly once-over
(') You're the only one from the group who showed up
Still awkward for them to be around each other
(') can't believe you remembered my signing
Well, pretty hard to miss that article about you in People magazine
Just wanted to say hi
And congratulations
Maureen comes up behind Hannah
Beams at Henry, and waves
Hello, Henry

Your public awaits
Go on
They need you
Please stay

(') Well, then
Guess you can't stay
Sorry
One sec
Wait here
Hannah runs back to the signing table, pulls out a book and scribbles something inside
She brings the book back over to Henry
(') This is for you

Take it
Henry accepts the book
Hannah gives him another long hug
(') Do you want to say hello to Richard
No
No, thanks

Horrified looks all around

Well,  did it
showed up to Hannah's signing
congratulated her
supported her, writer to writer
And  finally got introduced to Richard Benedict--formally
Sort of
Henry opens up his copy of Hannah's novel
He turns quiet, obviously moved
He holds the book up for the camera to see
(') Look
Hannah dedicated her novel to me
Just like she promised
Right beneath the printed dedication For Henry Obert, Hannah has written, For Henry, My Forever Friend xoxoxo Hannah

Snaps it shut

It eluded us then, but that's no matter-- (Surprised) --Tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further
