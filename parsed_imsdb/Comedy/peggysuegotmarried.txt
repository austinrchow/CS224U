Charlie starts giggling
We  fumbling and tickling
- First we see a woman's hand, on the floor
It is partially covered with flour
reveals  , in her early 40's, fainted from heartbreak while baking a cake
Flour is scattered on the floor
She recovers from her faint
Confused, she steadies herself and brushes the flour from her dress
-- Peggy's son, , 16, is playing an old reel to reel tape recorder
There are stacks of boxes filled with personal things and records
His sister, , 23, is packing
Boy, have they changed
Who gets it
don't know, just put it back
(
) Oh, gotta go
Here's a little makeout music
record starts: "You Belong to Me" by the Duprees
' , early 40's, singing the same song
He can't hit a high note, turns off the water and steps out of the shower
, his young, buxom girlfriend is in the bedroom
Goddamnit,  just can't hit those high notes anymore
You know Charlie, if you're serious about this,  know a great vocal coach
Charlie's perplexed reaction
- "Crazy Charlie's Discount Appliances" truck has parked in front of the house
are loading boxes of records, tapes, etc
Charlie pulls up, waves to workmen
/ Peggy is loading the oddshaped cakes into boxes
We note the grandfather clock tolling nine
Beth meets her father at the door
Hi Dad, can  have 100 dollars for a brake job
Did  hear 70 dollars
What do you need 50 dollars for
How's your Mom
Peggy comes out of the kitchen
Charlie has stopped conspicuously at the threshold
workman comes from behind Peggy
Coming through
Frank, watch the clock
Peggy looks outside
' Janet is seated in Charlie's car
There's something pathetic parked in front of my house
Come off it, Peggy
And what do you mean your house
This is my house
paid for it, 'm still paying for it
'm still waiting for the mortgage check
mailed it to you on Wednesday
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here
Jesus, Peggy
Take it easy
'm not used to that stuff
You always did the bills
Blame the damn post office
workman approaches carrying an old mono record player: black and white, a real fifties artifact
For a moment their mutual resentment melts, as they look at each other
That stays
The workman looks to Charlie for approval
Charlie nods
The workman shrugs, and heads back to the basement
You got a Tab
don't buy them anymore
You were the only one who drank them
Peggy leads the way
At the far end, she flips a light switch that turns on a wall sculpture of lava lamps
You don't want them
They're going to make a big comeback any minute
Mark my words, these lamps are going to
know
Put Scott through college
'll think of a way to sell, them
(beat) One day
Peggy opens a box filled with records
She closes it and moves to another
Charlie checks the contents of another box on the other side of the room
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight
'm not going
Scott calls from the top of the stairs
Come on Dad
Be right there
'll go through the rest of this stuff next weekend
Bye Mom
Bye sweetheart
Peggy and Charlie look at each other as Scott leaves
(with real, regret) never thought it would go this far
Charlie exits
Peggy looks around
She slaps the flap of a box down, to close it, but it jumps back up
: ' Peggy and Beth carry the cake boxes into the car trimming the hedge watches them lasciviously
Peggy and Beth drive off
Peggy's car rounds a corner into the business section of town
' Peggy pulls up to the front door of The Lovin' Oven, her bake shop
Bags of bread and rolls lean against the door
Beth jumps out and opens the door of the shop
Peggy stacks the boxes in Beth's arms and opens the door for her
If the pastries aren't here by nine thirty, call Monica and threaten her life
Peggy gets into the car, and blows a kiss to Beth
'll be back by noon
Peggy drives off as  drives up
She exits her car and begins to unpack cake boxes
Hi Monica
You just missed Mom
Sorry 'm late
My Bobo's back in town
' :	Sign: ' Peggy exits with a fifties flip
From a distance she looks like a fifties teenager
She nervously looks at her reflection
Maybe this was a mistake
Too late now
' Peggy is driving
On her car radio, we  a local '  (
) Hi
'm Dolores Dodge
We're taking calls today on surrogate mothers
Wombs for rent
want to know how you feel
Oh, Dolores
Peggy switches stations until she finds the news
Peggy stops for a red light
Her eye is caught by a Mercedes stopped next to her
Behind the wheel is a striking woman of her age,
They stare curiously for a beat, then: Carol
Peggy Sue
They pull over to the side of the road
Exiting the cars, they hug
haven't seen you in years
In all that time, haven't you at least tried another hair style
Peggy tries to laugh off her embarrassment
1 just did it for the reunion thought it would be fun
You're probably the only one who could carry it off
' Peggy and Carol enter as Beth finishes up with a customer
Peggy walks behind the counter as the customer exits
Where were you
You said you'd be back at twelve
This is my old friend Carol told you about her
Beth and Carol exchange hellos
r was worried about you  You didn't even call
You're always on my case if  don't call
How do you like my hair
It looks great
Don't change the subject
You know how busy Saturdays are
And  can't do the icing
always mess up the roses
You're not being very responsible
Peggy takes over the work of decorating the large pennant shaped cake in silver icing: 25th Reunion  Buchanan High
' Who's the mother around here
Sometimes  wonder
television studio set made up of platforms covered with black cloth
Placed around the platforms on different levels are projection TVs, regular TVs, microwave ovens and other expensive, futuristic appliances
Charlie sits at one of them (or a table) as a   rushes in and puts a tray of fortune cookies down
Here Charlie, extra fortune cookies
Good luck
Thanks
Charlie grabs a cookie and puts it on the table in front of him, smashing it with his fist
He picks up and reads the fortune: (manic) Next week you'll be selling Sanyo remote control VCRs for three hundred and ninetynine dollars
Oh no
(sings) Crazy Charlie
He grabs and smashes another fortune cookie
You'll give away Mitsubishi giant screen TVs for twelve hundred and ninetyfive dollars
Oh no
'll go broke
(sings) Crazy Charlie
He grabs and smashes another cookie
You won't be undersold on stereos, videos, microwaves or blenders
(sings) Crazy Charlie, Crazy Charlie, 'm not breaking cookies, 'm smashing prices
(rolling his eyes like Fabian) Crazy Charlie, he insane
The waiter hits a big gong
Beth laughs

Beth gets up from the bed and turns off the
Peggy enters from the adjoining bathroom, wearing a robe, and bobby socks with saddle shoes
She picks up a gold Locket from the dresser, and puts it on
When are you going to stop being so mad at Dad
How do you think that makes me feel
have a lot of unresolved feelings about him
don't trust him
Besides,  hate those commercials
'm sorry  asked
We don't have time for another heartto heart
Here, try on the dress
Peggy tries on the fifties dress lying on the bed
But  want you and Scott to understand
(beat) Do you think he loves Janet
Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies
Come on Mom
Give him a break
He's missing the reunion because of you
You know he wants to go
Then we'd both have a miserable time
What do you think
She looks exactly like a sixties teenager
Hey, you're a hip chick
You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine
Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask
Borrow
This was my dress
(beat) Maybe it's a mistake
What if 'm the only one
don't even want to go
Everybody's just going to say
(imitating commercial) Hi
Where's Crazy Charlie
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced
Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town

Arthur puts his arms around Beth and Peggy and leads them up the stairs
You two look like that soap commercial

It was Beth's idea

And the figure

How are you

Carol and Walter
They play a standoffish game, each noticing the other, but pretending not to
We  and  bits of conversations: (gleeful) can't believe how she let herself go
She was so beautiful in high school
Everyone's got a gold Rolex
had this one specially made in platinum
Richard is standing with three men
They hang on his every word
Beside them, a very   overhears: fifth generation core capacities are going to cause another shakeout in the smaller companies
(to Richard) Your damn computers put me out of business
You're a billionaire, and 'm a goddamn failure
Another man gently restrains the drunk and leads him away
Richard is shaken
Carol and Peggy
(chuckling) Welcome to the singles scene
don't know how you do it
've never even dated anybody but Charlie
You just have to remember
men are like houses and trade upwards
thought you had a pretty good marriage
We did for a long time
We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things
So he started having affairs, and you got depressed
Peggy nods
('
) You should have left here years ago, like  did
It's not the place
don't buy that
(melodramatic) Trapped in the same town forever
The price she would pay for her teenage lust
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you
She thought it was contagious
Oh, it's not so bad
have two wonderful kids, my own business
(beat) Still, knowing what  know now, if had the chance to do it all over again, 'd sure do things a lot differently
Wouldn't we all

Madeline Hutton and Arthur Nagle were high school sweethearts
Married right after graduation, they're still together
In this day and age, that's remarkable
Maddy, Arthur, how does it feel to have missed the sexual revolution
(incensed) What kind of question is that
It has nothing to do with the reunion
(thoughtfully  into mike) 'm glad you asked, Dolores
Four years ago Maddy and  found Jesus
Spiritual renewal
That's what reunions are all about
Familiar faces, forgotten memories, ancient dance steps and music

Carol Pritchard Heath and Walter Getz were high school steadies who went their separate ways
After twenty years and four divorces between them, they meet again Walter a successful dentist, Carol a mature career woman
Carol, why did you really come back for this reunion
Curiosity mostly

Too bad he's married
(cracking up) Whoa
Cat fight
Purse war
' : Dolores walks resolutely towards their table
Maddy and
Arthur leave the table as Dolores approaches, putting her tape machine on the table

Walter is dancing with Rosalie in her wheelchair
, Turns out  love business
Every morning  wake up, thank God 'm alive, and say Who am  gonna screw today
Let's play "Rate the Moment" give tonight an eightyseven
Better than sex, not as good as racquetball
Dolores has left
Walter lays out lines of cocaine on the back of the clipboard, as Carol watches
The best thing about being a dentist
Pure pharmaceutical grade
couple of lines of this,  can drill my own teeth
(looks at her for a moment) Hi
Hi
- (to his wife) Joe would have enjoyed this
God, still miss him
(to Carol) Peggy was a mess right after they separated, but  think she's coming out of it
It seems to be pretty friendly now
Sometimes it's easier when you hate them
can't remember
Did  make it with you in high school
Doesn't it feel like it was yesterday
Youth is like an amputated leg
Long after it's gone, you still feel it
My wife's a cow, my son has shit for brains, and my daughter's in India with Mother Teresa
My husband's a pig
But my son's in social work and my daughter, God bless her, is in India with Mother Teresa

Ask him to dance
Are we through Dolores
Good
Well
Richard stands and helps Sharon to a chair
(to Sharon) You'll be okay
Yes
You go ahead
Peggy and Richard head onto the crowded floor, and begin to dance
The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me
That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a foureyed worm
Well, you showed them
You're rich and famous and successful
And you have a beautiful wife
You were always friendly to me appreciated that
(beat) You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine
What was
Dancing with you
You're a sweet man, Richard
guess part of us never really leaves high school
You know,  never told anybody this, but  always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while
as Peggy and Richard become part of the sea of dancers, all Lost in nostalgic reverie
Charlie enters and stands by the door
He's tentative, looking around for his friends
Almost immediately he is joined by Arthur, Walter, Terry and Leon
They shake hands, glad to see each other
Here comes the life of the party
knew you couldn't stay away
Everyone's happy to see Charlie
His eyes meet Peggy's he gives her a tentative, sheepish wave
Terry looks at the band
You know, they could've at least asked us to sing
We'd refuse, of course, but they could've asked us
Looking at Charlie
Arthur walks onstage, placing a hatbox on the amplifier
He's a ChamberofCommerce type
(into microphone) Hello
Can  have your attention, please
The  in the room , Peggy and Richard head back to their table
know it's getting kind of late, and some of you have a long drive home, so the reunion committee decided it was time for the moment you've all been waiting for
You don't know what you've been waiting for because we didn't tell you, but the committee has selected a King and Queen
Now don't worry,  took care of it so the band's gonna keep playing for at least another hour, and my old pal Judge Crystal said that the bar can stay open as long as we want
Everyone applauds
At opposite ends of the reunion, but aware of each other
('
) And while you're at it, let's have a nice big hand for the Little Lady that did such a great job supervising all the decorations, Rosalie Testa
More applause
on Rosalie in her wheelchair
Now back to business
The members of the committee have given this a lot of thought and decided on the two people who best represent the spirit of Buchanan High's Class of '60
The king is someone who, in more ways than one, has come a long, long way since he left here
- ' They all look to Richard, knowing he's the obvious choice
We're proud to welcome him back, Richard Norvik
Come on up here, King Richard
The band  a  and

" (kidding) demand a recount
(laughs) Arthur places the gold cardboard crown on Richard's head as they shake hands
Sharon and  thank you all for making us feel so welcome
It's good to be back
as Richard steps back
Every king deserves a queen
Now, we had a Lot at worthwhile candidates
And  don't want any of you ladies to feel left out, 'cause you're all beautiful
But when we sent out the invitations, we didn't mention anything about this being a costume party
Peggy's embarrassed reaction, realizing everyone's looking at her
Maybe we should have, 'cause just looking at her brings it all back for us
Ladies and gentlemen, give you our queen, Peggy Sue Kelcher Bodell
Come on up here, Peggy Sue
The band begins the song
Peggy looks pained
She doesn't move
They're waiting
Come on
(close to tears) can't
It's all too much
Go on
You can do it
Charlie and Beth stand together: Beth is worried about Peggy
Peggy as she haltingly makes her way to the stage
As she does, she notices another blow-up on the wall: Peggy and Charlie, as King and Queen of the 1960 prom
Arthur gives the crown to Richard who places it on Peggy's head
He kisses her cheek and stands back, beaming
(into mike, overwhelmed) Thank you
Thank you very much

She's terrified
We  a smattering of background noises:  are , helping, etc
Looking up she sees: The
The  taking the  out of her arm, and placing a vial of blood on a tray with several others
Peggy sits up slowly, dazed and frightened
She looks at the nurse
Would you like your Twinkie now
Peggy takes the Twinkie, staring at it blankly
Looking around she  students giving blood to the Red Cross
Several have tubes in their arms
Nurses attend to them
Carol sits up drinking a cup of juice, waving weakly at Peggy
Maddy, now a brunette, slowly rolls down her sleeve
Arthur, Dolores, Walter and several others from the reunion
Everyone is younger but instantly recognizable
Charlie walks over to Peggy
He grins at her, revealing wax vampire fangs in his mouth, hair Brylcreemed to death
vant to suck your blood
also vant to suck your Twinkie
Charlie
Am  dead
No
You are the undead
You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie
(normal voice) Come on, let's have it
You hate them anyway
Mechanically, Peggy hands over the Twinkie
Charlie bends over to nuzzle her neck
The nurse's hand and grabs Charlie by the scruff of the neck, pulling him up
Young man, stop that
The
Hey

Now  want to make a withdrawal
think it's time for your next class - 'm changing banks
Charlie walks away towards Walter and Arthur
Peggy gazes after him, his body blocking her view of a portion of a banner hung on the wall
It reads: "Support the Buchanan High Blood Drive
" As Charlie exits, the final words come into view: "Spring 1960
" Peggy gasps
She begins to tremble
Lie back down and take a deep breath
What's going on
Where am
You passed out for a moment
Nothing to worry about
How did  get here
Maddy and Carol approach, carrying their books
Why don't you let your friends help you
(to Maddy and Carol) Take her into the washroom and splash some cold water on her face
That should perk her up
Yes, ma' am
They help Peggy up and lead her across the gym
' The girls enter
Carol immediately lights up a cigarette
Peggy crosses to the mirror
(to Peggy) Wanna smoke
That's the worst thing for her
No thanks
gave them up years ago
Maddy and Carol react as Peggy takes a closer look at herself and the girls' reflections
She places a hand to her throat, noticing the locket is gone
Where is it
Were taking you back to the nurse
Maddy, what did you do to your hair
Maddy looks in the mirror
- ' Maddy and Carol are waiting
Peggy exits the office, clutching a note which she hands blankly to Maddy
They walk towards the exit, Peggy glued to the wall for support
We're going to take you home
That's okay
'm sure 'll remember the way
The girls walk outside
Peggy looks around at the old cars i~ the parking lot
The most noticeable  a blue Chevrolet Impala convertible
Peggy stares at it for a beat, shivering with recognition, as she follows Carol and Maddy to a 1955 Ford
Maddy helps Peggy into the back seat
Carol drives and chats with Maddy, while in the back seat Peggy looks out at the world as it she were on a ride at Disneyland
She says things like "That's not here anymore"
- The car pulls up to the curb
Peggy gets out of the car
Maddy hands her the note and her books; she twirls her finger next to her head
'll call you Later
Yes
Let's stay in touch

Mom
Peggy embraces her mother, holding on for dear life, inhaling her scent
Chanel Number Five
That always reminds me of home
Of course, dear
You're home now
'm home now
' Peggy enters warily, looking around, a fifties museum of teenage artifacts
She walks around the room gently touching her old belongings including the record player from opening scene
She looks in the mirror to make sure she's still there
Suddenly, she turns around
Okay, 'm alone now
Is anyone here
She opens the closet door expectantly, then closes it shaking her head
No
This is crazy
Is somebody going to tell me what's going on
Why me
What happened
You don't have to show up

Come on
Mom said you were sick
You're never happy to see me

What dumb favor do you want me to do
On a small black and white , Dick Clark introduces a spotlight dance
Peggy and Nancy are sitting on the sofa, watching
Nancy is eating small candies, like &'s
It's unbelievable
The man never ages
Look at Kenny Rossi
Isn't he dreamy

She thinks she's so great
Don't eat the red ones
Why not
They're my favorite
They're bad for you
They cause
red lips
(red dye *2) Nancy react, as Peggy stands
to the den
Peggy opens the liquor cabinet and takes out a bottle of Scotch and a glass, noticing the family photos on the wall
Can't hurt
'm already dead
She belts down several drinks
(
) Peggy Sue
Hurry up
Fabian
Peggy steadies herself as   her back into the living room
Peggy collapses on the naugahyde recliner
Unexpectedly, it leans back, shooting Peggy's legs up
(from the kitchen) put your laundry on your beds
Don't forget to put it away
What's for dinner
Meatloaf
Yeech, not again
Peggy leans forward in the recliner eating the candies
Bemused, she looks at Nancy watching  and into the kitchen where her mother is slapping together meatloaf
-  - Peggy's father, enters the hallway
Girls
Evelyn
Who left this thing outside
He turns and heads back outside
What is it
Mrs
Kelcher and Nancy follow him outside
Peggy staggers to the front door and leans against the door jamb looking out at the family
' : The family admires a new red and white Edsel
What do you think
(disturbed) Oh, Jack
Like wow
Wait till  tell Diane
She's always bragging about her father's Cadillac
Peggy Sue, what do you think
Oh, Daddy
You were always doing things like that
(cracking up) That's funny
That's really funny
She staggers over to the car and falls against it laughing
Mr
Kelcher crosses to her and catches a whiff of her breath
Young lady, you're drunk
(laughing) Just a little
've had a tough day
don't see the humor in this
Go to your room immediately
You're grounded
(tipsy) Grounded
Ha
The story of my life
don't wanna go to my room wanna import Japanese cars
wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles
Jack, take it easy
She gave blood at school today
Maybe she's just a little lightheaded
This is not giving blood
This is drunk
Dad,  never knew you had a sense of humor
Evelyn, put her to bed
' Peggy lies in bed, her mother tucking her in
My little baby
Don't try to grow up so fast
Oh Mom,  forgot you were ever so young
She hears her mother walk down the stairs
(
) new car
We can't afford a new car
(
) Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump
(
) You have four seasons, you have four slumps
'  - Peggy emerges from the bathroom wearing a towel
At a full length mirror she drops the towel and happily appraises her eighteen year old body
Let's get physical
Let's get metaphysical
Nancy comes in dressed for school
Good morning
Nancy goes to Peggy's closet
Can  borrow this sweater
~ Yeah, but take good care of it
'm saving it for my daughter
She loves this stuff
- Mr
Kelcher and Nancy sit at the table eating breakfast
Mrs
Kelcher stands at the sink scraping toast
Peggy bounces her hair in her adult, natural look
" " all around
What happened to your hair
You have such a pretty face
Why are you always trying to cover it up
Oh
forgot
Mrs
Kelcher takes an elastic band from around the faucet and hands it to Peggy as she sits at the table
Peggy makes a ponytail
You're looking pretty chipper this morning
'm still here, aren't
may as well enjoy myself
'm going to go to school today
(beat) Dad,  want to apologize for yesterday
The car is a classic
Use it in the best of health
Thank you
accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again
That would be impossible
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits
Mom, is there any coffee left
Mrs
Kelcher begins to pour the coffee, then pulls back, spilling some on Mr
Kelcher
When did you start drinking coffee
Oh
Ah
recently
All the kids drink it
If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too
think 'm way ahead of them
Pass the toast, please
Peggy passes Nancy the toast
And the butter
You know, you two are wonderful parents
'm really going to try to behave myself
Well, at least you stopped calling me DaddyO
(correcting him) DADDYo
Mom, sit down for a minute
This is so nice, all of us being together again like this
Can  tell Diane that Peggy Sue got drunk or is that a deep family secret
(silence) Well
How does Diane like her braces
R31 She hates them
Nobody likes braces
Thy just call you junkyard face and Miss Metal Mouth
gotta go
Nancy jumps up, grabbing her lunch on the counter, as she exits
"' all around
We  a   outside a fivenote musical phrase
Oh yeah
Charlie
How am  going to handle him
What's the matter
Did you two have a fight
Sort of
What about
The house payments
Peggy exits the house wincing at the sight of Charlie's car, the blue Impala she'd seen the day before
Charlie sits, one arm on the wheel, the other over the back of the seat
How do you feel
Pretty strange
Peggy hesitates, unsure how to handle her accumulated ambivalence towards Charlie
Come on
Get in
can take care of that
Peggy warily gets in
Charlie leans over to kiss her, but she pushes him away
No dice
Not now, Charlie
've got a headache
Get used to the word
Roll it around your tongue for a years
Hey,  can take a hint
You look great today
Charlie starts the car, burns rubber and peels out
You drive like a maniac
call this the staccato
(does tricks) '    - (earnest) Not that 'm glad you were sick, but  had a chance to do some thinking last night
Oh yeah
You know
About what we said on Tuesday
It makes a lot of sense
Refresh my memory
How could you forget
We talk about seeing other people and you forget
Maybe  blocked it out
can understand that
But please don't start crying again
Charlie's car pulls up
It's not going to be forever figure three years is long enough
can see it the music pans out
(more tentative) And right after graduation we should start seeing other people
Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married
Know what  mean
Why wait
(surprised) Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties
We shouldn't upset our parents
They'll learn to live with it
Peggy exits the car and heads towards the school
Charlie sits, stunned
They are surrounded by friends as they head into school
Near the door Walter and Leon are having a contest, hoisting themselves onto the sign pole, trying to get their bodies parallel to the ground
crowd urges them on
We  taps on the bottom of Walter's shoes
Peggy stands bewildered in the hallway
Charlie walks back, takes her by the hand and leads her to a locker
You're more shook up than you want to admit
You'll get used to it, we'll still see each other 2, 3 times a week
Charlie opens the locker
Peggy watches carefully, memorizing tho combination
He takes out a few books as Peggy notices her schedule on the locker door
Want me to drive you home later
Would you
(growling) Would
Why  oughta
Unaccountably, this cracks Charlie up
He walks away laughing
Peggy looks completely puzzled
She is surrounded by a sea of people, who say hello
She can't remember their names
- We  Peggy, Maddy, Dolores, Arthur and Carol, singing They all mumble, except for Peggy who delivers a stirring rendition
The class thinks she's crazy
Peggy's decided to have a good time

Peggy stands at the door till most are seated
She sees an empty seat between Maddy and Dolores and, assuming it's hers, sits down
Did you study for the test
(horrified) Test
- , an officious little creep, is standing by his desk
All right, class
Time's up
He walks along the aisles collecting the papers
When he gets to Peggy he picks up her blank sheet
What's the meaning of this, Peggy Sue
(patiently) Mr
Snelgrove,  happen to know that in the future,  will never have the slightest use for algebra
And  speak from experience
The class gasps, a few students , and Mr
Snelgrove's jaw drops
is teaching The Old Man and the Sea (from reunion crosscountry photo) is speaking
He always wears black
Santiago comes back, with nothing there's no meat on the bone
It's Hemingway's ego defending itself again; he's trying to prove he can still perform
What Hemingway's saying, Michael, is that we are alone that when we go out too far we're vulnerable
The irony, that Santiago is beaten by the sharks, doesn't make him less of a hero
The class begins to exit
Over the weekend read the first four chapters of The Great Gatsbv
hope you enjoy it
Peggy hesitates
She walks up to Gilfond
Mr
Gilfond, can  talk to you
Sure, Peggy Sue
What's on your mind
just wanted to tell you how much enjoy your class
You taught me a lot and
you're a very fine teacher
That's very kind of you
Thank you
Thank you
Um,  also think you're underpaid
Walter, Charlie and Arthur sit at a long table
Why does your father take inventory on Sunday night
That's poker night
You always got out of it before
've got to string him along for a while
It's for his own good
But you're not going into his business
When're you going to tell him
Soon
can't tall everybody everything all at once
Peggy, Carol and Maddy walk over and sit down with trays
Peggy deliberately avoids the empty sear next to Charlie
They're uneasy with each other
Peggy looks with disgust at the slop on the tray
Strange rumors are sweeping the school about you
(wary) What do you mean
Prom what  hear, you really gave it to old Smellgrove
was there
She told the creep off right to his face
Atta girl, Peg
Arthur, please don't call me Peg
Why  oughta
Charlie, Walter and Arthur crack up
don't get it
That's because you' re not a total moron like they are
It's some stupid old movie thing they just started
That's enough out of you, little lady
'll throw the book at you
Why  oughta
The boys crack up again
The girls think they're hopeless
Peggy  Michael Fitzsimmons, buried in a book
He looks at Peggy with a penetrating gaze, then back down
Richard Norvik, also sitting alone, working with a slide ruler on a book of mathematical puzzles, dressed in early Nerd
Peggy gets up from the table
She looks back to Charlie and the table
'll be right back
She's not wasting any time
Peggy Sue and Mr
Square Root
He's a nice guy
You know he's writing a book
Oh, a book
Excuse me for a second
(fakes gagging) Peggy stands over Richard
He looks up nervously, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose, a constant habit
Congratulations on the math contest, Richard
It really wasn't that difficult
Doug Snell (of MerrillLynch, at the reunion) walks past
What're you doing, Peggy Sue
Fishing for foureyed worms
Get lost you macho shmuck
Doug and Richard react

It's very important
'm not doing any tutoring this year
'm too busy
It's not that
Can we meet after school
Please

With proper planning, a successful, inexpensive happy birthday party can be had by all
Including the mother
She walks back to her seat
That was very comprehensive, Madeline
Thank you
Now
(beat) Peggy Sue, your topic was 'How To Choose  Nursery School
' Are you prepared
All
Okay
Sure
Peggy walks to the front and faces the class, smiling primly
Choosing a good nursery school can be one of the most important decisions you can make
It will often determine your child's attitude towards education and schooling
(proud of herself) Of course, the lessons learned are primarily social  sharing, being considerate of others
(remembering) And they're so cute when they're little
They bring you back their Little masterpieces every day and you put 'em on the refrigerator door
They're so proud, and their names are all misspelled
Scott would always print his  backwards, and Beth would make her sweet little flowers
Peggy wipes away a tear
At the stunned reaction of the class and Miss Otto
' The baseball team practices
Michael Fitzsimmons runs laps with the track team
One lone boy kicks a soccer ball
- to  the baton spinning down, falling into the hands of a uniformed majorette who deftly passes it through her legs and twirls it back into the air
Another baton  it rises, spinning awkwardly and falls through Peggy's hands onto the ground
Six  in uniform are practicing
Dolores is one of them
(to Peggy) What a girl
What a twirl
You know, PegLeggy, you're gonna get demoted to hall monitor - Come on, Peggy Sue
Try it again
You haven't been practicing
Peggy gamely tries it again and manages at least to catch the baton and continue twirling
She continues, enjoying herself
Michael runs by, the lonely long distance runner
The group of majorettes heads toward the school
Peggy sees Charlie leaning against the car, waving her over
Looking good out there
Thanks
noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch
guess deserved it
've been thinking about my three year plan and think it's unworkable
must have been delirious
thought it had a lot of merit
In the abstract maybe
Get a grip on yourself
But when  imagine you going out with other guys, feel
ah
Rejected, worthless, miserable
Yeah
Like that
Good
Peggy turns, and walks away
Charlie looks miserable
Peggy enters and approaches Richard
He is too engrossed constructing an elaborate kite to notice her
What a great kite
'm writing a book on kite construction
What did you want to talk about
want to ask you a question
(beat) Do you think
time travel is possible
Are you doing some kind of science project
Sort of
Well
in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed
Peggy hasn't understood a word
And then, there's Richard's Burrito
What's that
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito
had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland
know what a burrito is
Well,  think time is like a burrito
Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other
What's inside
You can till it with whatever you want
From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes So you think time travel is possible
For people
Absolutely
People, dogs, elephants
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret
You can't tell a soul
Promise
Okay
promise
This is serious
Nobody can know
Ah, 've returned from the future
traveled back here 25 years
You probably are crazy
Wait a minute
Is this some kind of joke
know what you all, think of me
No
Really
You're the smartest person  know
It sounds unbelievable
But  can prove it
Oh yeah
You have a blind grandfather
One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people
read about it
You're going to be famous
You're going to invent a lot of things
How, did you know about my grandfather
Because 'm telling you the truth
know what's going to happen
There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants
And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon
On July 20, 1969
Holy Toledo
That's six years ahead of schedule
Peggy and Richard are walking, carrying their books
But when did you leave
Are you here until then
Were you there until now
What direction are you going in
Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past
Can anyone do it
don't know
Oblivious, Peggy and Richard walk by Shower's Cafe
Inside, Dolores and Carol see them
' 'd be very careful if  were you
You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain
That's why  was getting a divorce
(beat) What  really think is that  had a heart attack at the reunion and died
' You look pretty good for a corpse
Come on, Richard, 'm serious
You're giving me the creeps
Am  dead or not
There's one way to find out
Richard stops and throws down his books
He steps in front of Peggy, throwing down her books, dragging her to the curb
What're you doing
Confucious says, The way out is through the door
There's a truck
There's your door
large truck speeds towards them
Step in front of the truck
If you're dead, it won't matter
The truck'll go right through you
Go ahead
You're dead
Peggy takes one step off the curb
The truck is getting closer
The truck
No
don't want to die
' completely outfitted laboratory, kites decorate the walls
Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible
What if it's beyond science
What it it's God
Einstein said "God doesn't play dice with the universe
" 'm a scientist
believe that there's an order to things
Why would God bring you back as a high school girl
don't know
You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration
Maybe you've just got powers of precognition
Well, maybe you're just out of whack
told you, 've already lived my life
don't know how or why 'm here, but you have to help me get back
want to get back to my real life
All right, 'll work on it, 'll, do some research
But in the meantime, don't get crazy
'm trying
'll see you tomorrow
(heads out the door) What if you're not here tomorrow
Peggy comes home, enters hallway

She's served him tea
There are several, pieces of old jewelry spread on a cloth on the coffee table
The man is examining one of the pieces
Mrs
Kelcher seems surprised that Peggy's home from school
Peggy moves on into the kitchen
Peggy hears her mother let the man out
She enters the kitchen
Who was that man
It was nobody
Ah
he's a poll, taker
'm thinking of voting Democrat this year
But don't mention it to your father
How was school today
It was great to see everybody again
But it's so boring and regimented
Most of what they teach is useless
The worst thing was lunch

Would you get that, dear
Sure, Mom
(picking up the phone) Hello
Peggy gasps
Mrs
Kelcher turns to her
Peggy
What's the matter
Who is it
(shaken) It's Grandma
can't talk to her now
(into phone) 'm sorry, Grandma
Peggy hands the receiver to her mother and runs out of the room sobbing
Her first confrontation with mortality
Peggy climbs the stairs, in tears
(
) Peggy Sue
What is it
Forcing herself to regain her composure, she sits down at the top of the landing as Mrs
Kelcher joins her
What happened to you
had a dream that Grandma died
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine
told her you weren't feeling well yesterday
She called to find out how you are
She did
love her so much, and haven't seen her in such a long time
And Grandpa Barney
Is he all, right
Yes, he's fine, too
You saw them at Easter
'm sorry, Mom
'll call Grandma back and apologize
That's a good girl
hate to see you so upset
(beat) Tell me, sweetheart
Are you having problems with Charlie
You mentioned something this morning
'm confused about a lot of things right now
Charlie's only one of them
Two beats
Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing
What do you mean
Peggy, do you know what a penis is
(Peggy's jaw drops) Stay away from it
Charlie pulls up to the curb, opens the glove compartment, extracts a can of Old Spice aerosol, sprays the seat; and exits his car, throwing a kiss to it as he walks up to the door
He's wearing a hideous orange and turquoise sweater
Mr
Kelcher opens the door, Charlie enters
Hello, Charlie
Hello, sir
How are things at the hat store
Fine, thanks
Come on in
want to talk to you
Charlie and Mr
Kelcher into the living room
Mr
Kelcher sits on his recliner, Charlie, nervous, on the couch
Nancy is on the rug, studying
You may have noticed that Peggy Sue's been acting a little strange lately
She's distorted
Yes, sir
She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional
My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes
She's almost a juvenile delinquent
Mr
Kelcher gives Nancy a look and points to the door
Without her father noticing, Nancy creeps up behind him and makes rabbit ears behind his head
Charlie tries hard not to laugh
Nancy continues to clown
Yes, sir
But that's what  like about her
She's not like all the other girls at school
Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man
We've trusted you with our daughter
Yes, sir
Trust is a twoway street
In the past two years 've been pleased to note that you and Mrs
Kelcher have, uh, fulfilled your sacred trust of being good parents to the, uh, woman  plan to take off your hands
Mr
Kelcher looks as if he's witnessing the latest attack of teenage weirdness
' Peggy is changing a record
She sees the dress she was wearing the day before (and at the reunion) slung across a chair
As Peggy picks it up, a book of matches falls out
Peggy picks it up, excited
:  which reads: Peggy frantically searches the dress pockets and slowly draws out two joints
She stares at them for a beat
(worrying) Oh, Beth
There's a knock at the door
Peggy quickly hides the joints
Mrs
Kelcher opens the door
Charlie's downstairs
Why aren't you ready
For what
Maddy's party
don't feel very festive
You accepted an invitation, Maddy's one of your best friends, and baked the Rice Krispie squares
Peggy laughs
Enjoy yourself
This is the best time of your life
And the sooner you learn to handle Charlie the better
Get dressed
Mrs
Kelcher closes the door
We think this party might cheer her up
Just make sure you know what's expected of you
What would that be, sir
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself
(surprised) Of course
walking downstairs, surprised by Charlie and Dad talking
- Peggy and Charlie exit and walk towards his car
Peggy's holding a pan of Rice Krispie squares
Charlie slips Peggy's sweater back on her shoulder
He's trying hard to make up
Where did you get that sweater
Great, isn't it
It's really Fifties
You sort of clash with the world
Hey
What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird
And we're going to have fun tonight, right
Right
promised my mother
'    - Is this slow enough for you
(serious) Charlie, how are you
'm fine Peggy Sue
And how are you
Are we talking on the phone
Are we pen pals
Seriously
What's it like to be eighteen
Charlie looks thoughtful, then guns the engine
It's great
cleaned the car, do you like it
Oh,  got tickets for Fabian on your birthday, you like him, right
He's cool
Eighteen is half of thirty six
It's "Gentlemen start your engines", vroom, like 'm gassed up ready for the race
've got the girl, 've got the car, 've got the talent, but don't know
Do  date, get married, join the army, cut a record, go to college
got a million choices, but nobody teaches you how to choose
But it's different for a girl
You're Lucky
You just have to wait for me

Charlie sings lead, backed up by the other three
Walter dances insane, Temptationlike steps
The crowd huddles around them, clapping and grooving
Peggy is on the planet of lost innocence, removed and melancholy
Charlie really has a great voice
Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts
Don't get your hopes up
Come on, where's your enthusiasm
Charlie  directly to Peggy, grinning at her
In spite of herself, she smiles back at him
She's starting to realize why she fell in love with him
He's irresistible
He is kind of cute, isn't he
Yeah
You're so lucky
He really loves you, too
He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are
He does
The group finishes the song
Charlie blows Peggy a kiss

Dolores joins Peggy, Carol and Maddy
Carol and  saw you with that creep, Richard, today
First of all, Richard is not a creep
He happens to be an exceptional person
If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal
You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people
You don't even know the boy
If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion
Are you for real
Touchy, touchy

But  don't have to flatter you
It just feels right
You're the perfect girl for me

You mean sex

Last weekend you said
What time is it

But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married
And you were right
We should wait
(f1ustered) probably meant it when  said it
(beat; coyly) Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out
Who
Peggy starts to , realizing the absurdity of the situation
The more she , the more agitated Charlie gets
Peggy starts to unbutton Charlie's shirt
You know
Your love machine
the throbbing thrill hammer
your thing
You mean my wang
Listen, it's running real late
Charlie pushes her away, angry
What is this
What the hell is going on
One week you say, "If you love me you won't", now you say "If you love me you will"
(beat) Excuse me
That's a guy's line
Peggy realizes she's blown it
Charlie isn't ready for this
This is a mistake
We better forget it
You're damn right
Jesus
Peggy
You sure know how to spoil a mood
Charlie straightens himself up, starts the car and burns out
Charlie drops her off
'm sorry Charlie
Save it
Peggy watches him go
Looking at her darkened house, she turns and walks down the street
' Peggy peeks in the window
The kids from the party are eating and laughing
Rosalie Testa is dancing
Shaken by Rosalie, she turns away
In the distance she  the lights of: '
24
' few people linger over coffee
The waitress serving them is Monica (the same but younger woman from ' )
In a corner, Michael Fitzsimmons, in a red leather jacket, sits alone, reading
He looks up to check on his motorcycle parked outside
He's splendid in his isolation
Peggy enters, taking a seat at the counter, startled to see Monica, who doesn't know her
What would you like
Monica
Aren't you Monica Hines
Yes
Who are you
Ah
never mind
Can  have a coffee, please
And a cinnamon cruller
(sotto) How's Bobo
Peggy notices Michael staring at her
Peggy smiles, Michael doesn't
Monica brings Peggy her coffee and donut
Twenty cents, please
You're kidding
Picking up her donut and coffee, she walks over to Michael's table and sits opposite him
was impressed with what you said in English class today
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature
You don't
(contemptuously) He's a fisherman
The most overrated writer of the century mean, he's the perfect American author  fat, violent, drunk
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work
writer's life is his work
Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about
He's out there feeling, burning
grooving on life
Michael leans back in his chair
He's said his piece
Peggy studies him for a beat
The young man leaned back in his chair
No bulls would die today
What're you doing here anyway
Coffee and a donut
thought chicks like you traveled in packs
Hey, man, 'm a hip chick
' Long shot of the brightly lit donut shop
Michael and Peggy are clearly visible
Dolores and Terry are driving by
Terry, slow down
Okay
Terry
Slow down
What, why
'    ' : Peggy and Michael leave the donut shop, get on Michael's motorcycle
There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons
That commie beatnik
What's she doing with him
Wait'll  tell Charlie
First a nerd and then a weirdo
What a bunch of nose pickers
'll tell Charlie
- Peggy on Michael's bike, clasped around him
Her eyes closed, enjoying the wind blowing in her hair
They head out of town
Michael pumps gas
Peggy walks to the washrooms
Looking around she waits a beat, then enters the men's
' With all the aplomb of a divorcee, Peggy takes a quarter and deposits it in a condom machine
She puts the packet in her skirt pocket, pulls out the joints and stares at them for a beat
She checks her hair in the mirror and exits
Michael pumps air into the tires, bunched against a building
Peggy approaches him, holding up a joint, smiling conspiratorially
She lights it, inhales deeply, then passes it to him
He smiles back at her, a bit surprised, but still takes the joint and inhales
They drive up to a mountain top, Peggy wearing the leather jacket
She directs Michael with one arm
The motorcycle is parked
Peggy and Michael lie on the grass, staring down at the town lights below
Michael inhales the joint, then passes it to Peggy
This is great reefer
Yeah
'm surprised
It's really old
(inhales) Travels well though
(beat) You know, the world looks a lot better from up here
The world is fantastic
It's the ultimate absurd circus
am shot from a cannon into the energy
What are you shooting for
Maximum intensity
Yeah
can't wait to get out of here
'm gonna write
'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel
Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more JellO for me, Mom
' Don't you get along with your parents
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money
All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club
They care about you
They're just a different generation
Hey what's with you
thought you were cool
You rode my bike
You blew some pot
(beat) What's your scene Miss Majorette
You gonna marry Mr
Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life
already did that
want to be a dancer,  want to dance
Peggy takes off her sweater, kicks off her shoes and begins to dance
Her eyes are closed, her body silhouetted by the moon
Michael is transfixed
After a few beats, he walks over to her
He stretches out his arms and places them around her neck
They sway together for several beats, their bodies touching
Peggy opens her eyes and sees Michael gazing at her tenderly
You know,  had you pegged all wrong
Michael kisses Peggy
She responds passionately
ray of oneness piercing the solitude
Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh
You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire
Is that one of your poems
No,  just made that up
Do you want to hear one
'd love to
(eyes ablaze) Okay
Here's a new one
It's called Tenderness
(beat) couldn't sleep so  thought 'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness
In the madhouse of Dr
Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms (sees Peggy grimace; he calms down) 'm sorry
guess  was trying to impress you
(kisses her) Peggy is falling for it
He fumbles with her bra straps
Michael
you're as good as you looked
His other hand reaches to undo her skirt
'll respect you for eternity
(reciting tenderly) 'When you are old and gray, and full of sleep, And nodding by the fire, Take down this book, and slowly read, And dream of the soft look your eyes had once
" (beat) didn't write that
That's Yeats
Peggy is moved by the beauty of the poem
She sits up, leans over Michael, runs her hand through his hair, almost motherly
envy you
You have your whole life ahead of you and you know exactly what you want to do
(beat) But forget the rat puke; write something beautiful
Peggy lies back down on the ground
Michael takes her hand and kisses it
You know, this isn't really happening
to include the entire, perfect tableau: the starry night, the motorcycle, the clouds racing across the moon and the two lovers on the mountaintop
Michael stops at the corner of Peggy's street
She gets off the bike and kisses Michael goodbye
He takes off
Peggy walks up the path as the  approaches
Your parents are waiting up
You know,  see a lot of this in the spring
Good luck
Thanks, Ralph
Peggy enters, trying to be quiet
Mr
Kelcher stands in	the kitchen doorway in his bathrobe waiting for her, steaming
Peggy into kitchen
She grabs a cup of	coffee before sitting down
Where have you been
went for a drive
Up in the hills
Damn that Charlie It's not Charlie
It's me
(nervously) Peggy, let me ask you something
(beat) You're not
expecting are you
At my age
Don't be silly
Thank God for that
Dad
it's not a big deal
Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young
Yes but  was a boy
And  still had hell to pay
Calm down
Just listen for a minute
Please
All right
But this better be good
want to help with the family finances
want you to buy some stocks
And gold
By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce
Then you sell
Do you know how ridiculous you sound
First of all, it's illegal for
citizens to buy gold
And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government
think they're going to deregulate it
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change
Who's going to think for us
Our husbands
You know, you treat Mom like a maid
It's not entirely your fault
Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me
But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school
've heard just about enough of this lunacy
Go to your room
Listen Dad, please
Buy , buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer
No, no
Not yet
Buy Xerox
Evelyn, take her to her room
Peggy stalks out of the kitchen to the front door
'm not the maid
Way to go, Mom
The Kelchers glare at each other~
We  the
' Peggy and Richard sit in a booth
Richard's kite is hung on a coat rack
The way  see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world
'm just not the type
Besides, want to get out of here
But you have a vision
Don't you want to help your parents
tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me
'm talking about invention, no investment
know what people think of me
Mr
Spasmatician
Dick the Square Root
'll show them
You said  was going to be a millionaire
And you're gonna help
Richard, take it easy
No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick
Money is power
Money makes people respect you
How come you never ask me any important questions
Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war
Or a cure for cancer
What about your family
What about people
'm curious, but  don't want to know
Jeez,  hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them
Give me some credit, will you
Good
You're discreet
like that in a partner
Wbat're you talking about
Look it's very simple
You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and 'll invent it
We'll be partners
Fiftyfifty
Sixtyforty
That's not fair
Okay, find yourself another vision
You're taking advantage of a minor
When do we start
approaches their table
Do you know what you want
Ton on a Bun, with fries
And you
Quiche Lorraine, spinach salad and a Perrier
The street is filled with Saturday shoppers
Peggy holds the kite, Richard takes notes as they windowshop
They stop in front of a dry cleaners
Dry cleaners
No real change
Just higher prices
They move next door to a shoe store
Ah
This is a biggie
Forget sneakers
Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes
Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair
Come on
You can't be serious
There are major fortunes to be made here
Leisure time and lifestyles
Are you talking ~about exercise
Like gym
Not for you
Okay, there's lots more
They move along to the next window, an appliance store
The window is filled with old televisions, record players, large rotisseriebroilers, etc
The store sign reads: ' Another sign reads: Look at that stuff
It's like the dark ages
This is more your speed
And boy, do  know this business
Peggy peers into the store again and catches a g1impse of Charlie serving a customer
Peggy and Richard sit on the bench next to
Richard reads from his list
Let's see
(looking around) icrowavemays, ocketpay alculatorcays
The two ladies react
You don't have to use pig Latin
Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about
All right
These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature 's
Oh
And huge portable radios
Everything else gets small, but for some reason, portable radios get enormous
Peggy looks up and sees a lingerie store across the street
She heads towards it, calling: 'll be right back
Peggy enters the Lingerie store
After a beat, Peggy emerges from the store, excited and empty handed
Dodging traffic, she hurries back to Richard
Richard
They don't have any
They never heard of them
Isn't that wonderful
What are you talking about
The wave of the future
've decided on our first fortune
'll see you later
You just think high tech
High tech
like the sound of that
At the back is a small record department, complete with a listening booth
Charlie is waiting on a customer
Peggy enters
'  is waiting on a buxom  , his arm around her shoulder
He turns around as she enters
She has a shock of recognition
(to young woman) Look at that freezer chest
What capacity
(to Peggy, embarrassed) Hello Peggy Sue
Woody
How ya doing
Fine, just fine
Peggy gives him a big hug and a kiss on the cheek
Nice to see you
Charlie's in the back
Peggy walks towards the back as Mr
Bodell explains: My future daughterinlaw
Very affectionate girl
Charlie talks to on
'll just take the Ravel
Take the Shostakovich home and listen to it
Let it grow on you
Everyone that's bought it has come back and said, "This is definitive Shostakovich
Thank you for encouraging me to investigate it
" Well,  did enjoy the Dvorak you suggested
Young man, you talked me into it
Charlie points Peggy to the listening booth
You'll like it
kid you not
Peggy sits on the chair
turntable sits on a small desk
Record covers decorate the walls
Charlie enters and sits on the desk, his feet resting on Peggy's chair
What do you know about classical music
Nothing
Selling is selling
Charlie
About last nights
Forget it
've been thinking
Girls must go through that stuff too
Sometimes when  look at you feel like an animal
Maybe my dad's right
Teenagers are nuts
But 'm not
'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand
Yeah,  know
Girls mature faster than guys
But last night,  was the one who put on the brakes
And you know why
Why
Charlie cups her face in his hands, pouring out his heart
Because nothing else matters
That's the great thing about love
Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and  know that 'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end
Cause you're my baby and  love you
What am  going to do with you
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
'  - Alone in the store, Mr
Kelcher is going through some receipts
Peggy enters carrying a shopping bag
Hi, Dad
Doing some shopping
Peggy reaches into the shopping bag and pulls out a small wrapped box
For me
Open it
He opens the present
Inside are a pair of miniature golf ball cufflinks
Sweetheart, they're beautiful
But they must've been expensive
Across the street an ice cream truck pulls up
Mothers, fathers and children crowd around the back as the driver exit the cab
closed my Christmas club
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank
wanted to apologize for this morning
It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen
(looks out the window) Want an eskimo pie
Or a creamsicle
'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me
'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up
Quiet today
This morning was good
The hat business is in trouble
, that what all that nonsense was about this morning
You're worried about my business
Yes
That's very thoughtful, honey
It's just a slump
Things will pick up
But when John
Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats
Kennedy's a Catholic
He'll never win
(gravely; closing her eyes) He'll win
Richard Nixon's going to be President
Nixon wears hats
' Peggy is helping her sister Nancy with an art project
You think this'll cheer Dad up
Of course, he'll love it
You're a terrific artist
We  Mr
Kelcher arguing loudly from downstairs
The two girls freeze
(
) don't need your charity
don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -how could you do that
Please don't shout
Peggy opens the door, Nancy cautiously behind
(
) 'm not shouting
Have we ever starved
Have we ever missed a mea1
' : Mrs
Kelcher moves around the room, closing the windows
Does everybody have to hear
want everybody to hear because don't have anything to be ashamed of
Mr
Kelcher collapses into his barcalounger, red as a beet
Jack,  was just trying to help
We'll make it, we'll be fine
' Nancy is frightened
Does this mean we're going to be poor
Peggy leads her back into her room without letting her parents know they were there
' We  the song "Stranger in Paradise" from Kismet on the old black and white record player from opening scene
Peggy sits on the floor, surrounded by stockings, leotards and a sewing basket
She cuts the legs oft a pair of leotards
In one hand she holds up the top half of the leotards, in the other hand, a pair of nylon stockings
We  a  on the bedroom door
Peggy pushes everything under the bed as Maddy and Carol enter
All right
What's the scoop
On what
How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores
She's unbelievable
Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth
hear she does more than talk with her mouth
That's disgusting
(brushing her hair) ) Oh, Maddy, grow up
It says in that "the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it"
Page eightysix
Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts
Just what you underlined
You're kidding
Carol, you have beautiful hair
Come on
What's with you and Michael
Yeah
He's so cool and mysterious
He's very interesting
For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet
bet Dolores told Charlie
That loudmouthed little bitch~ Peggy Sue
You better watch out for her
She's after Charlie
Cool it kids
He's free to see other girls, if he wants
But  always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and  would marry Arthur
We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday
It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up
That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type
'm not going to marry him
just went out with him once
(beat) know
Why don't we go to the movies tonight
Just us girls
It'll be fun
Don't be silly
It's Saturday
Date night
Yeah
've gotta go
Arthur's picking me up soon
Okay
But let's have a girls night soon
Maybe a pajama party
Aren't we a little old for that
Sometimes you're so immature
- Peggy turns to face her parents, holding up her homemade pantyhose with a flourish
Ta da
Pantyhose
The death of the garter belt
Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this
What do you think
This is your great invention
(to Mrs
Kelcher) Would you wear those things
Would they go over my girdle or under
Instead of a girdle
And light as a feather
Jack,  think she's got something there
And we won't just sell them in department stores
We'll market them in drug stores and supermarkets
That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them
You need a partner
There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr
Fitzsimmons
've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night
Isn't that awfully forward
We've got to move fast
This is an idea whose time has come
You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr
Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea
Wrong, Dad
Your idea
' breeze blows through the open window Peggy sleeps fitfully, tossing off the covers
We   from outside her window
figure appears outside and silently climbs into the bedroom
Peggy mumbles Charlie's name
The man walks over to her bed as Peggy reaches out for him, tenderly, as if they were still married
Charlie
just had the strangest dream
(whispering) have to talk to you
Through her sleepclouded eyes, Peggy begins to focus on the face of the younger Charlie
Suddenly, she remembers
What are you doing here
(angry) Let's go down to the basement
Peggy enters, flicks on the light and leads Charlie in
Peggy senses Charlie's anger, and steels herself for the inevitable confrontation
want to know what's going on
Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons
bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night
didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride
(furious) Then it's true, dammit
had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you
When the Monotones did "Book of Love  Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance
" 'm thinking Did we break up
'Cause if we did,  don't even know about it
thought we cleared all that up yesterday
Did that Maynard
Beatnik give you what you wanted
You know  never could stand your sarcasm
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue
Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon
How come it always turns into an argument with you
Look, 've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth,  got the car
'm the lead singer, 'm the man
Charlie,
've been trying to postpone this
But what's the point
It's over
(crying) don't want to hurt you
This is very hard for me
'm doing this for both of us
really want you to be happy
will be happy if  have you love you
That won't make any difference
We just can't live together
And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet
What are you talking about
Who's Janet
just can't trust you anymore
What about everything  said to you this afternoon
That's just it
You can always get to me
There's this window in my heart and every time  leave it open, you climb in
Unless  close it now, nothing's ever going to be different
But what has to be different
Everything
have a good head for business,  should be franchising the bakery
And  want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college
And finish
What
What about the group and my singing career
What about me
'm trying to save you years of frustration
waiting for a big break
no
Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me
You don't know zip
You think 'm going to end up selling appliances like my father
Chasing women around the store
've got to give it a shot
Why are you trying to kill the two things that mean the most to me
Until yesterday you loved me and you loved us
(opening the door) ) What the hell has changed
For two years 've done nothing but love you
'll show you, 'm going to be just like Fabian
Charlie exits
Peggy slumps back, drained
Getting up, she crosses to the mounted swordfish
Standing on a chair she reaches into the mouth of the fish and pulls out a package of Pall Malls
She puts a cigarette in her mouth and picks up a table lighter and flicks it
As it lights, the tiny music box inside
- We  distant
Peggy sits down to scan the large Sunday newspaper
Seeing her mother's phone book, she finds the number she needs and picks up the phone
She dials slowly
(very nervous) Hello, Grandma
It's Peggy Sue
Much better
How are you
'm very sorry about the other day
' Peggy jogs towards Richard
He is watering the front lawn
(breathless) Hi, Richard
What are you doing
Jogging
was running, now 'm jogging
That's what you were talking about yesterday
Everybody does that in the future
Yep
It's going to be a law
(beat) broke up with Charlie last night
That's terrific
You did it
You really changed the course of your destiny
It was an unfair fight
He didn't have a chance
'm taking a real gamble
loved him for a long, long time
Cheer up
Now you can give some other guy a shot
Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht
For God's sake, forget the money
'm going crazy
'm a walking anachronism
'm a puddle of deja 'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death,  think my daughter's doing drugs again can't have any fun here,  don't have that innocence any more can't keep all this in anymore feel Like 'm going to explode
Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case
May  make a suggestion
Like what
(excited) Suggestion
Hypnotic suggestion
Why didn't  think o~ that before
What do you know about hypnosis
Everything
This is perfect
The subconscious mind remembers all
You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion
Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back
Look, 'm desperate
'll try anything
But what if you can't snap me out of it
No offense, but you're pretty out of it now
' Peggy sits in an old recliner
Richard holds a small, batteryoperated revolving disc up in front of Peggy's closed eyes, then puts it down and picks up a notepad and pen
You are completely relaxed
When count to three, you will open your eyes
One
two
three
(Peggy's eyes flutter open) We'll start with something easy
What is your name
(trancelike) Peggy Sue Kelcher
(beat) Or, Peggy Bodell
(beat) 'm not sure
Oh boy
Peggy, what are microchips
Ah
they're very tiny
they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set
What will they be made of
think it's called silicon
Charlie told me that
Silicon is from sand
We were lying in the sand
It was my eighteenth birthday
We were so awkward
would have married him anyway
Peggy starts to shift in the chair
Her shorts hike up, her legs spread slightly
This is not lost on Richard
Weird, guttural sounds begin to emanate from his throat
In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her
No
The Pill will change all that
Then he wouldn't have blamed me
We were just too young
You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex
No
The Pill will be for birth control
But girls do like sex
Maybe not the first time
Will you take of f your blouse
Yes, every day
(taking her blouse off getting spaced) Maybe  shouldn't have worn that dress
told Beth it was a bad idea
That's why they made me Queen
Peggy's meandering makes Richard nervous
'  (
) Richard, are you in there
Richard frantically tries to put Peggy's blouse back on
She's limp and unresponsive
(shouting) No
Yes
'll be right out, Dad
(urgent) Oh shit
Peggy, 'm going to snap you out of it
couldn't help it   loved him
One
two
three
(claps twice) You are now awake
Richard kneels on top of Peggy as she wakes up, fumbling the buttons at her breasts
Peggy comes to, as Richard jumps off
She buttons her blouse, furious
Richard
You should be ashamed of yourself
Me
You went crazy
You started taking your clothes off
was putting them back on for you
That's just perfect isn't it
Did it work
Did you find out why came back
think it has something to do with your birthday
You were rambling didn't understand the rest
God dammit
How'm  gonna got out of here
Peggy grabs a glass beaker and hurls it against the wall
Hey
Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost
usually charge for hypnosis
Oh, go feel up your hamsters hear rodents put out
Peggy storms out
Mrs
Kelcher stands at the counter preparing a pot roast
Peggy's making a chocolate mousse
You know, dear,  think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night
Just tell us
We'll believe you
Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta
What's pasta
Peggy and Mrs
Kelcher are setting the table, taking the good china out of the cabinet
dozen red roses grace the table
These roses are beautiful
And so romantic'
Who is this Michael
Is he a friend of Charlie's
She moves the Jell- mold
No, just a friend of mine
don't think he Likes JellO
What does Charlie think about that
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends
Besides, it's over with me and Charlie
(shocked) What
When did it happen
Your dad and  always expected you two to get married
Yeah,  know Peggy Sue gets married
Case closed
Period
Mom, if you could live your life over again, would you do the same thing
Get married and settle down after high school
Of course  loved your Lather
remember once being offered a scholarship to art school
But turned it down
Why
All the college girls  knew were so well, dressed
was worried that  wouldn't fit in
didn't have the right clothes
was so silly
But,  don't have many regrets, and besides, r don't have time to worry about the past
But Charlie
hope you know what you're doing
Michael,  and   sit at the table with the Kelchers
They have just finished dessert
Moose
never thought 'd have moose for desert
The adults laugh
Michael looks bored
Peggy Sue cooked the whole dinner
But Mom helped
You know, you should open a restaurant
It's incredibly difficult to make money in the restaurant business
You have to get up at five in the morning to go to the market, you have problems with spoilage, employee pilferage, and just try and collect from the credit card companies
They take months to pay
The whole table is astonished
How does a young gal like you know so much about business
Oh,  just picked it up from my dad
He's a wonderful businessman
Really
Peggy gives her father a go get him look
Michael's writing in a pocket notebook
Ah, Ed, why don't you and  adjourn to the den for a while
Peggy~ and Michael stand by Michael's motorcycle, passing a cigarette
That was quite an evening
Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid
shouldn't have put you through that
It must have been agony
Let's do something
Michael makes a move towards Peggy, with lust in his eyes
No
Something else
'm too full
Besides, it's a school night
- Michael and Peggy pull up on the motorcycle in front of Lena's Lounge, a seedy bar in the town's black ghetto
Half a dozen blacks are banging around outside
They eye Peggy and Michael suspiciously
' The room has a bar at one side, booths and tables in the rest of the room
stage is at the far end
On stage, an all black group, The FourMations, is performing the song ' The people in the club are dancing the Twist
Peggy and Michael sit in the last booth
Several people wave hello to Michael
Although Peggy and Michael can see the stage, their booth is not visible from the stage
Five more weeks of school
And ten minutes past graduation 'm gone
(he raises his glass) To freedom
(looking around at the crowd  clinking glasses) For everyone
Now listen, this is the plan
As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and
Utah
thought you'd be going to New York or Paris
What's in Utah
Rita
met her last summer
She's cool
You'll really dig her
She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens
'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us
(astounded) can't do that
Why not
Polygamy's legal in Utah
hate chickens
On stage, the FourNations have concluded their song
We
Thank you
Now we're happy to introduce, a friend of ours
He's one damn fine singer, Mr
Charlie Dell
We  the   the
But what about the other night
We were like two stars in the same constellation
Michael, you and  are light years apart
You should go, but not with me
But we had heat baby
Passion
Fire
We owe it to ourselves to fuse together
(beat) At least one more time
That's a terrific line
You're going to be a wonderful writer
You think so
Yes
We had a glorious night together
One day you'll remember and write about it
can dig that
Bittersweet perfection
Dogs of lust on leashes of memory
yeah
Suddenly distracted by the familiar voice, Peggy looks up to the stage and sees that the lead singer, Charlie Bell, is in fact, Charlie Bodell
' : (0
) It's Charlie
(0
) What a treat
- Michael observes Peggy's intimate reaction to Charlie's singing
Now  get it
Ssh
He's great
Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause
Charlie finishes the song as the audience goes wild
He beams
thought  knew everything about him
Can we split now
Peggy and Michael unobtrusively slip out of the club
Charlie leaves the stage
He's met by a greasy looking
They sit down at a booth to talk
Michael and Peggy pull up
Peggy gets off the bike and gives Michael a goodnight kiss
can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah
That's cool
But 've got to warn you about something
What
My father
He's not just the ultimate square
He's a total crook
Mrs
Kelcher finishes the dishes, with rubber gloves on
Mr
Kelcher sits, cleaning his pipe
Peggy enters
How did it go with the pantyhose
It's the darndest thing
Ed knew what they were immediately
As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now
Oh no
Didn't call, them pantyhose, though
What was it, Evelyn
Sheerotards
Catchy name, isn't it
Like leotards
He's a liar
He has no such thing
It's my own fault
should have had it patented first
He's a crook, damnit
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth
Mr
Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man
Oh, you're both so naive
Look young lady,  grew up through the depression
fought in the second World War
Six days a week get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors
And on the seventh day, when God rests,  don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool
You have a point, dear
' (
) Peggy lies in bed in the darkness, her eyes wide open
The bedside clock reads: 2:47
Peggy gets out of bed
Peggy into Nancy's room
Peggy looks down at Nancy sleeping
Gently pulling back the blankets, Peggy gets into bed with her
' Peggy walks down a residential street, much like her parents'
She stops when she sees Charlie's car parked in a driveway, and leans against a tree next to his car
Moments later, Charlie exits his house, a dog trailing behind him
The dog runs up to Peggy
Charlie is wary and distant
What're you doing here
wanted to talk to you, and  have one last thing to take care of at school
Then 'm going to
(pats dog) Good dog, Rusty
Good dog
Rusty's dead
That's Ajax Charlie throws a stick
Ajax chases it, never comes back
Oh
guess  always liked Rusty better
(beat) Could you give me a ride to school
Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell
How'd you know about that
was at Lena's last night
You were terrific
Not terrific enough
What were you doing in that part of town
Who were you with
What were You doing there
You never told me you were singing with an  and  group
Hey
guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other
Charlie and Peggy walking
'd forgotten how much music meant to you
That's real big of you
Stop being defensive
want to help you
wrote a song for you
You're kidding
You wrote a song
Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy
she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why
Peggy takes a piece of paper from her purse
Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit
Honest
Fat chance
You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night
He told me to forget it
You told me to forget it
My parents tell me to forget it
Just take a look at it
(hands him the lyric) If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, 'll take a look at it
But 'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music
wonder if people would still like me if  stopped being Mr
Excitement
Peggy and Charlie stand by their open locker
Does this mean you like me again
It means  care about you and what happens to you
That's all  wanted to hear
'Cause 'm never going to give up on us
It's easy to fall apart in a crisis
It's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck
But this is more than love
This is a mental decision
Just wait till tomorrow, when you see your birthday present
Then you'll understand
Charlie walks away as Peggy reaches into the locker for her books
Peggy,  have to talk to you
Peggy turns to Carol
They walk down the hallway together
What's the matter
It's that jerk Walter
What happened
After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing
Welcome to the singles' scene
What a  going to do for the rest of my life
don't have a boyfriend anymore
Look, Carol, maybe Walter's done you a big favor
You always said you wanted to get out of town
Go for it
And be happy, goddamnit, 'm rooting for you
Walter walks up to Charlie
Hey Charlie, what do you think of this
Walter does a totally demented dance step, finishing by strumming his leg like a guitar
He stands there grinning
Walter, maybe you should be a dentist
Peggy sits at her desk, organizing her books
We hear the end of the  over the
(
0
) And finally, our heartiest congratulations to our girls diving team for placing second in the county finals last Friday
And a special accolade to Rosalie Testa who placed first in every one of her events
We're proud of you, Rosalie
Everybody turns toward Rosalie and applauds
Peggy turns to Rosalie, trembling
The   as the class starts to leave, still crowded around Rosalie
Peggy stares after her, frozen in her seat Dolores approaches
What's the matter, princess
Lost your prince
Peggy looks up at Dolores and starts to seethe
She stands up slowly and faces Dolores
You know Dolores, there's a lot of things  could say to you, but you're not worth the effort
Peggy reaches down to	up her books
On the top of the pile is an open fountain pen, which she picks up, pul1ing the release lever, squirting ink all over Dolores's dress
Dolores drops her books, looks down at her dress, horrified
Sorry
These fountain pens are so tricky
(screams) Oh
You did that on purpose
hate you
Go gargle with razor blades
beg your pardon
Take a long walk on a short pier
Have a nice day
' Peggy sits disconsolate on a bench, watching the other girls changing into their swim suits
Rosalie is in the shower room, wetting down her suit
She accepts congratulations from a number of the girls
The   as the girls begin to exit to the pool
Rosalie
Wait
Rosalie turns at the door, smiling
They are alone
What's up
think you should give up diving
It's dangerous
Don't be silly, 'm the best in the county
know you are, but you have to stop
couldn't tell you before, didn't know if  should
But you have to stop before you hurt yourself
spend three hours a day practicing
have trainers,  know what 'm doing
But accidents can happen
Not to me they don't
'm going to win the State, then the
Nationals, and then 'm going to the Olympics
Rosalie, please, listen to me
You have to stop
You're sick
You should go to the nurse
'm going to tell Miss Dennis
Rosalie exits into the pool area
Peggy feels helpless
Peggy walks down the hall, a set of double doors, leading to the pool, just ahead of her through them she sees Rosalie diving through the air with the careless innocence of youth
Burdened with the inevitability of it all, she rushes through the hall, and is stopped by Richard
What's the matter
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out
Not true
think 'm making real progress on the microchip
You were meant to
You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to
have to get out of here
She starts to walk away
Peggy,  believe you
believe everything you told me
It's wonderful
You're the exception that proves the rule
She kisses him on the forehead
love you too, Richard
Thanks for trying
She continues down the hallway
- Peggy heads out the door, sees Charlie
Hey, Peggy
Wait a minute
Peggy stops on the landing
Charlie joins her, so eager
He doesn't notice how distraught she is
cut shop and did some work on your song
You know, it's not half bad for your first try
Of course, changed all the "yeahs" to "oohs"
Listen to this
Charlie begins to sing an & version of
Forget it, it'll never work
Okay
Listen,  cancelled the tickets for Fabian
thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres
Walter, Arthur, Maddy and Carol watch as Peggy runs away

- the bus, Peggy looking out the window, the rural scenery: pastures, barns, etc
, the other passengers
Peggy's grandparents,  and   , wait in the front of the station
Peggy sees her grandparents waiting for her
She grips the window rail tightly, trying to hold herself together
Everybody gettin' off at Dumont
Here we are
Peggy stands and reaches above to take down her suitcase
Nervous, she drops it
, getting off the bus, helps her, picking it up
Thank you
No trouble at all
The man gets off the bus
Peggy stands at the door of the bus, hesitant
Elizabeth and Barney approach the bus, waving and smiling up at her
Hello, Lilla
Peggy Sue
Peggy slowly walks down the steps, moved to tears
She approaches her grandparents and drops her suitcases
She hugs them tightly
The bus door closes and the bus pulls away behind them
Barney is behind the wheel of a 1951 Plymouth
Elizabeth is in front, Peggy curled up in the back, regressing
Quite a bit more rain than usual this year
hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb
've already got some in
was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight
(turning around to Peggy) How would you like that
(like a little girl) Fine
(beat) ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel
That's a day's work
But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday
/ - Peggy and Elizabeth finish up the dishes, chatting
fire blazes in the fireplace
grandfather clock stands prominently in the room
The clock from Peggy's house
Peggy sits with Elizabeth, learning how to knit
Barney laughs at "The Burns and Allen Show" on
Suddenly, Peggy places her hand over her heart and shivers with fear
What's the matter, Lilla
Somebody jump on your grave
Peggy shivers again and shakes her head
- Barney reading
Elizabeth enters, carrying a tray with cups of cocoa
They each take a cup
You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that  died
wish she hadn't
'm not afraid
know exactly when 'm going to die
Peggy is perplexed by her grandmother's apparent lack of fear
What's it going to be, Elizabeth
Seventyfive
Eighty
'm not telling
've been trying to drag it out of her for years
(beat) You know, dreams are fascinating business
'Specially where you see the future
Do you believe in all of that
Well,  like to speculate
This book 'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago
Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived
She was hypnotized
Big bestseller
remember that book
(beat) Grandpa, Grandma,  want to tell you something
Peggy and Elizabeth are making strudel
If you believe it, darling, then believe
Being young can be just as confusing as being old
The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday
But 'm remembering the future
Right now you're just browsing through time
Choose the things you'll be proud of
The things that Last
My children make me happy
miss them so much
(beat) Beth
Scott and Beth
(beat) 'm going to name my daughter after you
Peggy and Barney are washing the car at a standpipe, two hundred feet from the house
It's gonna rain again
Every time  wash the car, it rains
That never changes
(beat) You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone
never see the cousins anymore
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do
(jawing) 'd take better care of my teeth
Elizabeth is tying Barney's bow tie
Peggy is sitting with a jacket on
What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting
It's her 18th birthday,  want to show her off
Barney turns and winks at Peggy
It was my idea, Grandma
always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings
He won't tell me, but 've got my suspicions
And  don't want any of that
Don't keep her out late
Let's go
(hugging Elizabeth) Goodbye, Grandma
Have a good time
Barney and Peggy open the door and exit
Peggy and Barney approach the car
What does Grandma think you do at your meetings
Stag movies
Smokers
Peggy chuckles as they get into the car
The car proceeds along the driveway and turns onto the highway
Barney is at the wheel
may be an old fool, but  think we can help you
hope so
At least  got to see you and Grandma
(beat) Has it ever worked before
The last one was six hundred years ago
It's about time for another one
- onestory, pitchroof building
The sign over the entrance reads
:
Underneath the sign is a logo of a spreading sunrise
Peggy and Barney pull up to the front, exit the car and enter the building
Thirty old men are congregating around the cloak room
Most are already dressed in long, purple robes with the sunrise logo over their hearts
They either wear or carry tricorner hats
Peggy and Barney enter
Several men approach them
Peggy nervously clings to Barney' s arm
Welcome, Peggy Sue
It's nice to have you with us
Thank you
You know, you're a lucky girl
You could lay a bear trap in the aisle of the cathedral and never catch a better man than your grandfather
Ah
thank you
Let me take your jacket, Lilla
've got, to get my robe
Peggy hands him her jacket as he heads over to the cloak, room
You know, this is very exciting for all of us
We've been waiting a long time for someone like you
Barney rejoins them, wearing his hat and robe
The group begins to enter the main room
(nervous) Do you have to wear that hat
It wouldn't be a lodge without hats
Barney takes her hand and squeezes it
They walk slowly through the doorway
Don't you worry
'll be watching after you
large meeting hall
The room is draped, and brightly lit with fluorescent lights
At one end sits a large, gold painted wood throne
On either side are large candle holders, with lit candles
small table serves as an altar in front of the platform
On a footstool is a potted plane with an artificial bird perched on its top
The throne and altar look like a set left over from a summer stock "Macbeth"
Peggy and Barney enter
Several men lead Peggy away from Barney to the throne
One man places a go1den cape around her shoulders
They lead her up the platform to the throne
Hey, George
Get the lights
The  are
The room is lit by the candles
The men form a semicircle around Peggy
Old men at the end of their lives, they are serious and passionate about the possibilities of life beyond this world
One by one, four men from either end of the line approach the altar with offerings: a cup of wine; an egg; a gold coin; and a rose
The men rejoin the line
, a tall, whitehaired man, takes two steps forward
The other men begin to sing a Gregorian chant
(to Peggy) Are you ready, dear
Yes, sir
Leo steps back, closes his eyes and spreads his arms
Fasten your seat belts
Here we go
Lord of the Universe, Vast and Mighty One
Ruler of Light, King of~ the sun
Creator of earth, air, fire and water
(kneeling down) We adore thee and invoke thee
Grant thine aid
Look with favor upon us as we witness the regeneration of man
We behold the innocent endeavors of singleminded men and women
For we are the company of unbodied souls and immortal angels
We ask thy intervention, that this girl may return to thee on the wings of your Love
(sotto) This is never going to work
The old men form a circle in front of Peggy
They begin to circumambulate east to west, intoning together, their heads bowed
As Barney passes in front of Peggy, he winks at her
She smiles back
Fount of life, Chariot of the Spirit, Womb of the Mother, reclaim thy child of light
We  a clap of distant
Peggy trembles
The artificial bird falls off the plant
Peggy is struck with amazement
She begins to glow, poised to take off
The men continue to chant while: (
) The name of your love is sacrifice
We offer up this girl, that her soul may find its home
Suddenly a door is opened, a gust of wind pours in and extinguishes the candles, plunging the hall into darkness
(0
) Nothing to worry about
Somebody get the lights
The  are
All the men look to the throne
Peggy is gone
They are speechless for a couple of beats
(chipper) Well, the girl's gone
Let's play some poker
He smiles, happy that she made it
George crosses to the wall, reaches behind the drapes and presses a button
The wall slides open to reveal a fullyequipped card room
The men shuffle in
Charlie carries Peggy off towards his car, one hand covering her mouth
Peggy struggles
When they reach the car, he puts her down
She's still wrapped in her golden robe
What the hell did you do that for
What are you doing here
was trying to save you
They were going to vaporize you
Don't be ridiculous
They're just a bunch of harmless old men
My grandfather was in there
You're going to listen to me
Charlie tries to Lead Peggy into the car
'm not getting in that blue monstrosity
Charlie pushes her inside, Peggy climbs back out
Charlie takes her hand and drags her up a hill behind the lodge hall
Let me got
Where are you taking me
Right here
Now sit down
Charlie sits her down on the ground
She's impatient and hopping mad
Look
wanna tell you
forgive you for everything
know what you've been going through
You're just scared
was scared, too, but 'm not anymore
How could you possibly know what 've been going through
Thunder and lightning
It starts to rain
Because  love you, damnit
had a long talk with your father yesterday and we decided that the best thing for us to do is get married and settle down
Right away
Peggy jumps up, exploding to Charlie
What do you mean you and my father decided
Who the hell are you to plan my life
Let's get married and live happily ever after
Bullshit
got knocked up
had to marry you
never had a choice
What
You betrayed me, Charlie
You were never there for me or the children
And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared
" Of course 'm scared
If you knew what  knew you'd be scared shitless
You're crazy
You're really out of your mind
might be crazy, but 'm not crazy enough to marry you twice
There's a lot of things  can't change can't even think about them tried
But  couldn't even help Rosalie
(tears start) don't want to be bitter
'm a naturally optimistic person
But you took advantage of that
Charlie bends down to comfort her, in tears
He hugs Peggy and strokes her hair
Oh, Peggy
My poor Peggy
It's all my fault
'm so sorry
won't bother you anymore
promise
Please stop crying
Please
Peggy starts to compose herself
Will you take me back to my grandparents
Of course
Charlie helps her up
Be reaches into his pocket and takes out a small box, handing it to Peggy
It's almost your birthday
wasn't sure when you were coming back, so brought your present up here
With a slow, growing remembrance, Peggy opens the box
Inside is the gold locket Peggy was wearing at the reunion
(anguished) Oh, Charlie
It opens, too
Look inside
Peggy opens the locket
She shivers with recognition
- Two photos, one of Peggy, one of Charlie, as children
Scott and Beth
Where did you get these
Who's Scott and Beth
Your mother gave me our picture
That's you and me
So are Scott and Beth
Peggy leans into Charlie, throwing her arms around him, holding on for dear life
She looks up at him, their foreheads touching
(tenderly) love you
know
Charlie kisses her, passionately
The locket drops to the ground
on the locket, and
: - Charlie and Peggy are lying on the ground, gazing up
flash of lightning streaks across the sky
think we should get out of here
It's going to rain
(musing) Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed
What the hell is that
Flying high above them is an enormous, glowing, liquid neon kite
The center of the kite inscribed in lights, flashing like a marquee:
The kite begins to descend towards them
Peggy jumps to her feet and races towards it
She grabs the tail and starts to sail away with the kite
Charlie chases after her
Peggy
Where're you going
Come back
've got to go now
But  love you
'll love you forever
'll love you, too, Charlie
'll love you for twenty years
Come back to me
'm trying
As Charlie watches helplessly, a huge bolt of lightning strikes his car
Peggy smiles
The men from the lodge run outside
They look up and above the blazing car and see Peggy floating away
Peggy sees her grandfather in the crowd and blows him a kiss
Charlie begins to run, following the kite cord to its source
He finds Richard, struggling to restrain the runaway kite
Richard, do something
can't
It's out of control
Suddenly the cord breaks
Peggy floats away
Peggy
Charlie, Richard and the old men behold Peggy, bobbing and dipping playfully in the sky
We begin to  Charlie's singing "Peggy Sue"
Peggy looks down with wonder at the earth, and then like a comet, soars into the blackness
In an instant she becomes a star
/ - Moving from two to
Peggy, fragments of the reunion, the cake coming towards her, fragments of words in echo effect: 'Your heart stopped for a while
" Father's voice: 'You're a very lucky young lady
' Doctor: ' (explain) of the head
' Mom's voice: 'But you're going to be all right now, the paramedics got there
' Mom, 'We were so worried
" Echoing of, until once voice is left
Charlie
Sitting opposite her bed, as he has been every minute of her illness
He looks wan and old, worried sick, but trying to sing 'Peggy Sue' for her
(singing softly)
Peggy Sue,  love you, and  need you Peggy Sue
Charlie
Was  dead
thought you were
for a while
(affectionately) You look awful, like you haven't slept in days
And so old
But happy
Very happy, Peggy Sue
Charlie,  thought  knew everything about you
wanted to apologize
can't live without you
What about Janet
That's over
got tired of translating everything
She thought the Big Hopper was a hamburger
Charlie laughs uncomfortably and Peggy Sue looks around her hospital room
Who are all the flowers from
Charlie pushes himself out of his chair and moves toward the dresser
Everyone
Maddie and Arthur, Carol and Walter
Richard Norvick
And here's a book, by that guy from high school, Michael Fitzsimmons
He dedicated it to you
Charlie returns to Peggy's bedside and opens the front cover of the book
: the front page bears the title "The Pilgrim Soul" and the dedication reads " to Peggy Sue and a Starry Night "
Peggy smiles but shakes her head
It couldn't be me
hardly knew him
'll just set it right here
He places the book on her bedside table as he sits back down
Charlie,  had a strange experience
went back to high school
And  spent a lot of time with you
And you and Walter and Leon were singing " Wonder Why"
Oh, God, Dion
You were terrific
And  kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up
'll never give up
Then hold me
He holds her hand
loved you since the day  met you, and  haven't stopped
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell
Listen,  don't expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away
But  would do what  can
Charlie, please,  need some time
Well, 'll let you get some rest
so long
The    past the flowers
Charlie starts to exit
Checks himself in the mirror
Charlie,  would like to invite you to dinner at home, on Sunday, with your kids
will make a strudel
He hurries back to her, kisses her again
They hang on to each other as Beth enters the room
To be inserted after Dolores/Peggy scene and to replace the goodbye to Richard scene
- Empty except for Richard who sits alone in a study warren, surrounded by books
Peggy approaches
Be puts down the book he's reading
He smiles
You know, Peggy, there's so many things to look forward to in the future
Peggy leans over and kisses him, sadly, on the forehead
came to say goodbye
Goodbye
Where're you going
What about our partnership
'm making real progress with the microchip
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to
So are you
You've got a vision
(manic) Vision
'm a walking anachronism
've upset my parents
miss my kids
could be trapped here forever
And poor Charlie
got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married
Tomorrow's my birthday
've got to get out of here now
Did you break up with Charlie
Yeah, yeah
'm taking a big gamble
've loved him for a long, long time
Okay
Why don't we do something visionary
Change your destiny, Peggy Sue
Change your destiny and marry me
(slamming down book) No
No
No
Peggy Sue got married
Case closed
don't want to marry anybody
Goodbye Richard
Wait
'll go with you
You can't
You're going to be Valedictorian
