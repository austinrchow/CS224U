href <b>// --> </b> Fast Times at Ridgemont High : - From the outside parking lot it looks like an enormous beached whale
It is the prime hangout for all the teenagers in the area
Kids mill around the parking lot or stand by the mall entrance
There are three levels of stores underneath a massive fluorescent roof
Different music comes from each store
It looks seventies-modern, but already used and run-down
Groups of kids cruise the mall, eyeing each other and acting cool
' -  - The teenage waitresses in their peppermint pattie uniforms are rushing around, trying to keep up with their orders
good-looking man in his mid-twenties enters and sits
He wears a plastic name tag that says: "Pacific Stereo Audio Consultant,
" Two Swenson's Waitresses pass by with supreme indifference, and take their orders into the back kitchen
' #1 think he looks like Richard Gere
The two Waitresses discuss the issue at hand
One of them, Linda Barrett, is the seventeen year old, retired sex queen of Ridgemont High
#1 (') think he looks like
Richard Gere
(Bruce Springsteen) Did you see his cute little butt
third waitress enters
#2 Let's talk about -19
#1 We were
#2 think 'll drop over and change the shakers
No, be cool, that's Stacy's section
Through the entrance, we see Stacy Hamilton
She is the fifteen-year-old trainee, sweet-looking with just the last traces of baby fat
She puts down a glass of water for Ron, spills some and mops it up
#1 He's too old for Stacy, she hasn't even started high school yet
flustered Stacy enters the back kitchen
How's it going
Do you think that guy's cute
#1 In a blow-dryed kind of way
Does anyone else want to take his table
Don't you like him
Yeah, but  fucked up
You can take it
Really
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man
What should  do
Just take his order, look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny, laugh a lot
She fluffs up Stacy's hair and gently shoves her towards the door
Stacy reluctantly exits
' Stacy goes to Ron's table
So you working hard or hardly working
Stacy thinks it over, decides it's a joke and laughs (a little too late)
Ron looks at her soulfully
(') You look like you could still be in high school
know, everyone says that
He stares at her and she stares back uncomfortably
(') What can  get for you tonight
How about your phone number
Stacy smiles nervously
-  ' - teenage boy stands in front of an in-mall theatre across from Swenson's
He wears a stiff over-sized tuxedo suit
He is Mark "The Rat" Ratner, a ticket taker on the job
Mike Damone, a transplanted Easterner, bops over from the record store, eyeing every girl he passes
He stops at the movie theatre
Do you ever look at those girls who work at Swenson's
They're beautiful
And  have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week
You should work for yourself
Two Junior High Kids spot Damone, walk up to him
(') What can  do for you, gentlemen
#1 You the guy with the Van Halen tickets
could be
#2 What do you want for something in the first ten rows
Twenty bucks apiece
#1 Those tickets were only twelve fifty
So don't buy 'em
#2 (to friend) All the other scalpers are sold out, Arnold
Damone reacts indignantly
Scalper
You call me a scalper perform a service, my friends
The service costs money
Now do you want the tickets or not
The Kids look at each other
#1 Are you sure you can't go any lower
These are my special back-to-school prices
#2 We'll take 'em
Damone reaches inside his pants pocket for a wad of tickets
'
- At the other end of the mall is a neon-lit Carl's Jr
Hamburger Restaurant
If Swenson's was the warm up, this is the main attraction of the Ridgemont Mall
'
Back-to-school banners hang from the walls
Many kids are lined up at the counters
In the middle of the kitchen, directing all the orders, is a seventeen year old named Brad
He moves confidently, observing the fryer, checking cup supply, and giving an affectionate squeeze to a pretty cashier named Lisa
She lets him kiss her, but only once
teenage Customer shouts to Brad from the front counter
Hey Brad
waited till you came on
wanted your fries
Brad smiles, walks over to the fryer and discards the fries left from the previous shift
He shouts to the other employees as he puts in a new batch, "his" batch
We need fifteen Superstars, David
#1 Okay, Brad
'll take care of the fry orders
Just get me the Superstars
#2 Fish sandwiches
Brad spots three surfers sitting in the dining area
None of them are wearing shirts
Hey you guys
You had shirts on when you came in here
a bleary kid sitting at the head of the table
He runs a hand through his long, stringy blond hair
After a time, he speaks
Something happened to them, mon
Come on, Spicoli
Why don't you just put your shirts back on
See the sign
that reads: "No Shirts, No Shoes, No Dice" '
store manager, Dennis Taylor, bustles up to Brad
Any problems
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on
took care of it, Dennis
grumbling, putting shirts back on
It pains them
Dennis heads back to his office when he sees something in the trash bin
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton
They were left over from the last shift
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton
(glares at Brad) Perfectly good
But they weren't mine
Brad laughs, goes back to work
- It is closed and only a few janitors remain
Stacy and Linda walk through the large empty mall
He gave me his card
(lovingly) 'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant
' (amused) Should we buy a frame for that
Come on, Linda,  haven't had a boyfriend all summer
You promised when  started working at the mall that my life would change
Do you think he'll call this week
Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys
'll tell you
They're mostly chicken
Before  met Doug chased after every guy  thought was cute
thought if  gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up
Well, guess what
They don't call
So what did you do
called them
If  was sitting next to a guy and  wanted to sit closer, 'd sit closer
If  wanted to kiss him, 'd just do it
You want Ron Johnson
Grab him
can't do that
They pass a janitor cleaning graffiti that says: and
Face it
With some guys you have to make the first move
lot of guys are just
wussies
Really
Stacy, what are you waiting for
You're fifteen
did it when  was thirteen
It's no huge thing
It's just sex
If you don't, one of the other girls will
(cute) He was hot, wasn't he
If  didn't have a fiance in Chicago, 'd go for it
young Girl runs and catches up with Linda and Stacy
(breathless) Are you Linda Barrett
Yes
'm Carrie Frazier from Toys ' Us
Judy Hinton from May Company told me  could ask you something
Linda nods
(') have this situation with my boyfriend, and  wanted to
(looks at Stacy, then whispers in Linda's ear) Linda listens thoughtfully, then clicks into her "sex expert" mode
Okay, are you over sixteen
The Girl nods
(') All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly - several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's
And they don't call my parents
Not if you're over sixteen
Okay
Thanks a lot, Linda
And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either
The Girl thanks Linda again
Linda and Stacy get to the back exit of the mall and Linda uses a key to open the door
can't believe  start high school tomorrow
Believe it
They exit the mall, into the night
- We see all the elements of the first day of school
The students carry new books, explore new lockers, begin to stake out their ground
Someone has taken the steel letters from the green vanguard out front
It reads: " " The rest of Ridgemont High is covered with toilet paper
And a black spray paint message along the side of the front office building reads, " " - Brad pulls into the Ridgemont High parking lot
He drives a beat-up, four-door model  sedan
Three friends wait for him near his parking space
They are dressed in the same golf caps with brand logos on the front like ,  and
#1 Hamilton
#2 The cruising vessel
Hey -- Yooooo
Brad climbs out of his car and pats it admiringly
Six more payments, gentlemen
Brad joins his friends, and they walk towards the gymnasium
We see a shiny, new, blue Mustang whip into the parking lot
Students scatter from the parking space
Behind the wheel is football star Charles Jefferson
huge, black kid
The halls at Ridgemont part for Charles Jefferson
Rat and Damone are in the parking lot
Damone surrounded by underclassmen (customers) selling tickets
See that Mustang
gave Charles Jefferson that car when he was a sophomore
The underclassmen are impressed
They watch as Jefferson opens his car door and stands to his full height, over six-foot tall
He opens his trunk and pulls out no books, just a football duffel bag
He slowly walks by Damone, Rat and the underclassmen
(') How ya doing
That car looks great, Charles
Jefferson gives Damone a death glare
Don't
fuck
with
it
He moves on
Damone resumes selling tickets
Shit, that's my man
We see a clutching, smooching couple walk by
Cheerleader Cindy Carr and her boyfriend, Gregg Adams
- The Four Stoners (from Carl's Jr
) tumble out of a van in the parking lot
They head towards the gymnasium
- Standing by the ---- registration counter in the gymnasium, Brad waits to pick up his red ad card
He stands surrounded by his buddies
They nod vigorously at everything Brad says
As he talks, fellow students all say hello or pat him as they pass
One troubled-looking boy, Arnold, walks up to Brad
Brad, can  talk to you a minute
Arnold
What's happening
Arnold speaks confidentially to Brad
Brad,  really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man
Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill
You want to work at Carl's
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, 'd do anything for you
want to work with you guys
can probably get you in there
Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor
All right
Brad notices Stacy and nods with complete inner cool
Hi, Brad
Sis
' Hey, Stacy
Hi
Where's Lisa
Everyone wants to know where Lisa is
How should  know where Lisa is
(to buddies) What am  gonna do
Now my little sister goes to the same high school
The party's over
(to Stacy) So who do you have first period
History
Mr
Hand
Hey-yo
Hey-yoooooooooo
(concerned) What's wrong with Mr
Hand
Nothing
if you like 'Hawaii Five ' You better get in class, Stacy
That's not the one to be late to
Stacy hurries off
(as soon as she is gone) Your sister is really turning into a fox
You should see her in the morning
' Hey-yooooooooooo
- Stacy barely slips in the door before the final attendance bell sounds
She finds a seat just as the teacher's cubicle door opens at the back of the classroom
tall figure comes barreling down the aisle
He is Mr
Hand
The man makes a double-speed step to the door at the front of the class, kicks the door shut and locks it
The windows rattle in their frames
Stacy watches, wide-eyed, at her first high school class
Aloha
My name is Mr
Hand
Mr
Hand writes his name on the green chalkboard before his class
Every letter is a small explosion of chalk
(') (almost sweetly) have but one question for you on our first morning 'together
' (pause) Can you attend my class
Pakalo
Understand
History has proven us one basic fact
Man does not do anything that is not for his own good
It is for your own good that you attend my class
And if you can't make it
can make you
An impatient knock begins at the front door of the classroom
(') We have a twenty-question quiz every Friday
It will cover all the material we've dealt with during the week
There will be no make-up exams
It's important that you all have your Land of Truth and Liberty textbooks by Wednesday
At the latest
The knock continues
(') Your grade is the average of all your quizzes, plus the midterm and final, which counts for one-third
Got it
The mystery knocker tries a lazy calypso beat on the front door
No one in Mr
Hand's
History class dares mention it, much less answer it
Stacy grips her desk with the tension of her first day
(') Also
There will be no eating in this class
You get used to doing your own business on your own time
That's one demand  make
don't like staying after class with you on detention
That's my time don't like wasting it
Just like you wouldn't want me to come to your house some evening and discuss History on your time
Pakalo
Hand finally turns, as if he has just noticed the sound at the door and opens the door an inch
Jeffrey Spicoli stands in the doorway, red eyes glistening
His long, blond hair is still wet and streaming down the back of his white peasant shirt
He grins, oblivious to such trivial matters as attendance bells
Student sitting near Stacy turns to his friends
That guy has been stoned since the third grade
Yes
Yeah
'm registered for this class
What class
This is
History, right
saw the globe in the window
(appears enthralled) Really
Spicoli holds his red ad card up to the crack in the door
Can  come in
(swinging door open) Oh, please
get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and  don't see all my kids here
Spicoli laughs
He is the only one
Sorry 'm late
This new schedule is totally confusing
Mr
Hand takes the red ad card and reads from it with utter fascination
Mr
Spicoli
That's the name they gave me
Mr
Hand slowly tears the card into little pieces and sprinkles the pieces over his wastebasket
Spicoli watches in disbelief
His hands are frozen in the process of removing his backpack
(') You just ripped my card in two
Yes
Hey, bud
What's your problem
Mr
Hand moves to within inches of Spicoli's face
No problem at all
think you know where the front office is
It takes a moment for the words to work their way out of Jeff Spicoli's mouth
You
dick
In the tense moment that follows, no one in the class is sure what might happen
Mr
Hand simply turns away from Jeff Spicoli as if he ceased to exist and coolly continues his lecture
've taken the time to print up a complete schedule of class quizzes, and the chapters they cover
Please pass them back to the desks behind you
Hand begins passing out stacks of purple mimeographed sheets
all smelling the purple mimeographed sheets
Still standing in the doorway, hyperventilating with fifteen-year-old adrenalin, is Jeff Spicoli
After a time, he fishes a few bits of his ad card out of the wastebasket and huffs out of the room
- It's packed
The school's outdoor dining area is actually just a small courtyard lined with fast food machines and dominated by a large oak tree in the center
Standing at the center of lunch court, under the large oak tree, is Brad Hamilton and his golf-cap Buddies
You hear about the surfer in Mr
Hand's class
His Buddies shake their heads
(') Told Hand to fuck off
' Whoa
_ Brad sees another friend pass through lunch court
Thompson
Brad waits for him to pass
(') hear Thompson got canned at Bob's this summer
#1 Yeah
They hacked his hours, so he quit
Where is he now
#1 Making two eighty at Seven-Eleven
Man
(pause) They make you wear a fuckin' candy stripe suit over there
#2 Poor guy
Poor guy
-    200 near the outer rim of lunch court
Jeff Spicoli comes stumbling out into the daylight, surrounded by a small group of Ridgemont Stoners
Marijuana smoke billows out behind them
#1 It was so bitchin', mon
Everybody is talking about it
#2 Totally
The motherfucker pissed me off
#2 Totally
You don't have to take that shit
didn't take that shit
They all laugh, flip hair out of their eyes
#1 Tell us again
What happened after he ripped up your ad card
called him a dick
And then reached for his class notes, and ripped 'em up
said, 'Hey bud
Two can play this game
' The Stoners go wild
(') 'll tell you this
If he hassles me again,  can't be responsible for what happens
you know why
#1 Because he's a fuckin' dick
You got it
(pause) Gimme a dollar
One surfer digs out a dollar for Spicoli
They look out at lunch court, see it teeming with straight kids
They turn and walk towards the parking lot
- as they walk onto lunch court
They take a seat on the outskirts of the area and watch all the students crowding onto the eating area
hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr
Hand this morning
No way
He just called him a dick
God
People exaggerate so much at this school
The school couple, Cindy and Gregg walk by
Hi, Linda
God, you look so great
Hi, you guys
This is Stacy
Stacy, this is Gregg Adams and Cindy Carr
Hi, Stacy
Stacy smiles
Gregg and Cindy move on, repeating the same scene a few feet away
If there's one thing that never changes
it's a cheerleader
Stacy turns to see a girl with short, black hair passing by, wearing tight black spandex pants, and dark lipstick
Linda
That girl looks just like Pat Benatar
know
They watch her pass
(') Actually, there are three girls at Ridgemont who have cultivated the Pat Benatar look
Linda gestures out on lunch court
- wearing pink spandex pants and short-cropped black hair with dark lipstick
- wearing blue spandex pants and short black hair
She stands a good distance away from the other two
(') None of them talk to each other
Linda looks at them with bemusement but Stacy is wondering
Do you think guys find that attractive
Oh, give me a break, Stacy
You're much prettier than them
They sit and eat their lunches
Linda has her perennial diet lunch of yogurt and raw vegetables
Yeah but they look more sophisticated
You'd probably think they'd be better in bed
What do you mean 'better in bed
' You either do it or you don't
No there are variables that, like, might not be good at
What variables
(shyly) Like, you know, giving blow jobs
What's the big deal
Well  never did it
There's nothing to it
She takes out a carrot stick and eases it down her throat
Stacv tries one but chokes
(') You just have to practice a little first
(feels her throat) Relax these muscles
Think of your throat as an open tunnel
The girls try sliding the carrot sticks down their throats without gagging
at the next table; sees them and points them out to his companions
What happens
don't laugh at me, but when a guy has an orgasm
you know, like, how much comes out
Stacy stops practicing and looks horrified
Linda laughs
Just kidding
About 10cc
(enlightened) Oh
That's where that group got its name from
They continue practicing as the boys look on
Stacy manages to get almost a whole carrot down her throat to Linda's amazement
The group of boys break out in applause
Stacy looks very embarrassed
- The class is situated so that all students sit at Bunson burner tables lining the room
Pat is seated at one of the tables and Stacy takes a seat nearby; she looks at the ledge in front of her
It contains a pig embryo
She listens to the conversation next to her
'll tell you right now
'm not going
'll get sick or something
'm not going into a room with a bunch of dead guys
You'll go
It's part of the final
(a Pat Benatar) Have you heard what they do
'm serious
Have you heard
What
The bodies are dissected, Mike, and Mr
Vargas pulls out parts of the dead body and holds them up
Okay
You mean he reaches in and pulls this stuff out
Yes
Like a heart
Hearts, lungs, guts
Stacy strains to hear more, just as Mr
Vargas -- a diminutive man holding a coffee mug -- enters the class
Good day, everyone
just switched to Sanka
'm running a little slow today, so have a heart
He is riveted on Stacy Hamilton, swooning
: '  - We see Stacy's room, a young girl's room with posters and frilly pillows
Stacy is in bed, and her Mother is just leaving the room
Sleep tight, Stacy
Good night, Mom
Her Mother shuts off the light, exits
Stacy pulls back the covers
She is fully dressed
'  - We see the window to Stacy's room slide slowly open, and watch her slip outside
She hikes down a drainage pipe to the street
- brown  pulls up
Stacy jumps from the shadows and hops in
The car drives away
'  - Ron sits behind the wheel, humming casually along to the music on his car stereo
Ron has on a light-brown leather jacket
He looks like a contestant for "The Dating Game
" (a little nervous) Thanks for picking me up
No problem
He speeds off, turning up the radio to sing along
(') 'The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine Columbian
' (eyes Stacy) You look nice tonight
Thanks
So do you
Where do you feel like going
don't know
Wherever you want
How about the point
(nervously) The point sounds fine
(looks at her knowingly) All right, the point it is
We see Stacy's anxious face, as the car speeds up Ridgemont Drive, with music
- Stacy and Ron sit in the car, listening to music
The "point" is a natural lookout spot that lovers can "discover
" It is behind the baseball field and dugout of Ridgemont High School
Stacy and Ron get out of the car and walk to the baseball dugout
- They sit side-by-side
Above them, a single light bulb shines a very private fifty watts on things
That's a nice shirt
Thanks
Thanks a lot
Silence
They look at each other, look away
(') It's very warm out tonight
It is
It's very warm
wonder how long it will last
Ron leans over and kisses Stacy lightly on the cheek
Stacy sits quietly for a moment, thinking, was that the first move
Then she lunges at Ron and kisses him square on the mouth
At first surprised, Ron then holds her there and kisses her in return
After a time, he breaks away
Are you really nineteen
Yes
am really nineteen
They continue making out
think  better take you home
What about those other guys you live with
No
mean back to your home
But they make no moves in any direction
They continue making out
Ron begins unbuttoning her blouse and massaging Stacy's breasts
moment later, he tugs at her pants
Awkwardly, she starts to help him
He tilts her backward onto the concrete dugout bench
They kiss feverishly, her hand pulling off her shoes, then her pants
Ron goes to work
(') (whispers) Is this your first time
Yes
' as she feels a man enter her for the first time, we see the graffiti above her: Surf Nazis Lincoln was here --  Sieg Heil Led Zeppelin Dan y Roberto (Disco Fags) : - Stacy is standing by her locker, twirling the combination
She is joined by Linda Barrett
Was it great
It was okay
You'll always remember your first time
It was nice
So tell me, do you like Ron
Is it serious
Come on, Linda
It's just sex
Hey
That's my line
They both laugh and walk down the hall
- Stacy arrives home
The Hamilton home has that anonymous prepackaged tract look, like many others in this lower-middle class neighborhood
Brad washes his car in the driveway and listens to the car radio
Mom says to clean up the pool
Why can't you do it
Your friends use the pool
Your friends messed it up
Your friends use the pool too
take out the garbage
Don't strain yourself
Stacy bristles, and heads inside the front door
- The furniture in the Hamilton living room looks like it was gleaned for a sale at Pic ' Save
Through the living room, one can see a very small, kidney-shaped pool
Stacy checks an erasable telephone message sheet near the refrigerator
There are two names on it: /
Brad's side is filled with messages
Stacy's is empty
She notices a summer bouquet floral arrangement
Stacy reads the attached note
It reads: "Memories of You, Ron Johnson
" She quickly gathers it up and carries it back outside
She fans the door several times to dispel the odor
- Brad
Have Mom or Dad seen this
They're not home yet
Brad, what would you say if  asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work
'd say
who the hell is Ron Johnson
'll explain everything later
Brad nods, as Stacy pushes the flowers into his arms
'  - Damone expertly fills two glasses three-quarters full of Kahlua, then adds a few drops of milk
Music is playing on a nearby speaker
Damone hands The Rat a drink and checks himself out in his mirror
See that moustache coming in, Rat
There is only a hint of peach fuzz, but he grooms it anyway
(') See
You can almost press it out
Damone turns around
His friend is preoccupied
am in love
Damone takes a sip of his drink, looks at The Rat
You
are a wuss
Part wimp
Part pussy
What do you mean -- wuss
This girl is my exact type
It's her
Definitely her
(distracted) It's definitely your mama
Damone, you gotta listen to me
Damone quits puttering around his room with the Kahlua and milk
He grabs a chair and straddles it
All right
where did you see her
She's in my biology class
Did you get her number
No
Did you get her name
No
It's too soon
It's never too soon
Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes
Well, what do you want me to do
Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello
'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me
' (thoughtfully) would
Yeah
Really
can see it all now
This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer
You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her
(woeful) You tell me, Mike
What do  do
Okay
Okay
(sighs, but loves it) Here's what you do
Damone gets up, moves to the door
(') You start from the second you walk into biology
Don't just walk
move across the room
He saunters over to the chair
(') Don't talk to her
Let her know
Use your face
Use your body
Use everything
This is what  do just sent out the vibe and  have personally found that
girls do respond
Something happens
Of course something happens
You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen
That's the idea, Rat
That's The Attitude
The Attitude
The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays
Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'
When you are the cruelest and the coolest
then you have The Attitude
Damone knocks down the rest of his drink, and we
: '
- We see Brad operating at full throttle in the kitchen, and taking a moment to sneak a kiss with his girlfriend Lisa as she goes to the front counter to open up a cash register
She allows him only one kiss
Were those flowers really for me, Brad
Of course
How much did they cost
Don't worry about it
She gives him a kiss
on the cheek
(') Let's go to the Point tonight
She pulls away
What's there to do at the Point
Brad shifts his weight, tries to find the right words
What's there to do at the Point
God, Lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and
Brad
don't want to have to use sex as a tool
Tool
Tool for what
We've been going together almost two years
don't want to talk about it here, Brad
Brad prepares to respond
He squints his eyes, prepares for a truly sizzling comeback, when Dennis Taylor, short and prematurely balding assistant manager of Carl's Jr
, comes bustling out of his back office
He quickly surveys the situation in the kitchen
Hamilton
You have fifteen double cheese to box
Lisa returns to her cashier post, leaving Brad's last words stalled in his mouth
- We see the Hamilton's cul-de-sac home
All the lights are off in the house at this hour
Except for Brad's room
' Brad is alone in his room
He's prone on his neatly made bed, reading a paperback book entitled Power With Class
On the wall of Brad's room is a large framed photo of a Carl's Jr
hamburger
Brad hears a muffled knock at his door
Come on in
Stacy walks into Brad's room
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers
Don't worry about it
Who sent the flowers
It's just some guy  met at Swenson's
You don't know him
don't care it you tell me or not
got problems of my own
He begins pacing
Is everything okay at work
Are you kidding
Work is great kill at work
don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you
've been doing some thinking
It's my last school year
'm a single, successful guy
think  want my freedom
Why
Because she won't sleep with you
Where did you hear that
'm just guessing
Well
it's true
Maybe you just need to give her some time
She's so nice, Brad
Everybody loves Lisa
Everybody loves Lisa
Everybody loves Lisa
But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend
Suddenly, Stacy pops the question
Hey, Brad
Are you still a virgin
Why
don't know
was just curious
Maybe yes
Maybe no
You are a virgin
didn't say that
But your face did
They laugh
Then Brad turns serious
Are you still a virgin
Maybe yes
Maybe no
Don't give me that shit
know you're still a virgin
Stacy smiles and stands up
She playfully slaps her brother on the arm and walks down the hallway to her room
We can see there is less frill and lace in Stacy's room
The junior high paperbacks are gone
There are no dolls in sight
- Linda and Stacy walk past rows of cars
Stacy stops at a brown
There
There's his car
know he's at work tonight
He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house
My mother told him  was still at high school, after  told him  was nineteen
guess should tell him 'm fifteen
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again
Does Doug care that you're seventeen
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like
That's why 'm marrying him
If he ever calls again 'll say 'm eighteen
Boy  am so glad to be through with all these games
They enter the mall
- We are now several weeks into the school year
Mr
Hand is dropping test papers on desks like they are pieces of manure
three weeks we've been talking about the Platt Amendment
What are you people
On dope
piece of legislation was introduced into Congress by Senator John Platt
It was passed in 1906
This amendment to our Constitution has a profound impact upon all of our daily liv
Mr
Hand stops on a dime
He is like a champion hunting dog that has just picked up the scent
He scans the room
(') Where is Jeff Spicoli
There is silence in the
history classroom
(') saw him earlier today near the 200 Building bathrooms
Is he still on campus
Silence
(') Anyone
One student sitting next to Stacy raises his hand
(') Yes, Desmond
saw him by the food machines
How long ago
Just before class, sir
Mr
Hand snaps his fingers, Hawaii Five- style
Okay
Bring him in
Desmond hustles out the door
(') What is this fascination with truancy
What is it that gets inside your heads
Mr
Hand begins to pace the aisles as he speaks
Occasionally, for emphasis, he bends down to lecture directly into the students' faces
(') There are other teachers in this school who look the other way at truants
(points to attendance clip on the doorway) It's a little game that you both play
They pretend they don't see you, you pretend you don't ditch
Who pays the price later
You
Desmond returns to the room with a red-eyed Jeff Spicoli
Hey
Wait a minute
There's no birthday party for me here
Thank you, Desmond
(to Spicoli) What's the reason for your truancy
couldn't make it in time
(in top form) You mean, you couldn't
Or you wouldn't
don't know, mon
The food lines took forever
Food will be eaten on your time
(pause) Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr
Spicoli
Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this
don't know
Mr
Hand appears mesmerized
He then turns and heads for the board
He writes in long, large letters as he slams the chalk into the green board
He writes: " ' "
like that
He stands back and admires it
He turns randomly to Stacy
(') Don't you like that, Miss Hamilton
Yes, sir
really like that too
' don't know'
that's nice
'Mr
Hand, will  pass this class
' 'Gee, Mr
Spicoli,  don't know'
like that
think 'm going to leave your words on this board for all my classes to enjoy
Giving you full credit, of course, Mr
Spicoli
We hear the blare of the dismissal bell
Stacy and the other students get up to leave
Spicoli stays in place
He has just figured out a truly bitchin' comeback
and his mouth is forming the first word, when Mr
Hand cuts him off
(') You can go now
Hand turns back to his desk
The rest of the students have already left
Spicoli's audience is gone
He shrugs and lopes out the door
- It's Christmas time at the Ridgemont Mall
All three tiers are strung with neon lights, and we hear the sound of the bell-ringing Santas
' - Stacy and Linda are enjoying a brief lull in the Christmas season madness
They sit at the sundae bar
Stacy looks forlorn, almost red-eyed, as she makes a sundae
You've got to get used to working Christmas
People are always screaming and yelling
then they get home and they're all Christmasy
think Christmas brings out the worst in people
guess Ron hasn't called yet
Not since November
Linda nods her head, always the coach
Stacy, it doesn't look good for the relationship
Stacy continues making her ice cream, slapping the scoops onto the stainless steel dish
(sighs) Don't you think it meant anything to him
Even if  am fifteen
Stacy
What does it matter
He's a stereo salesman
You want to marry him
You want to have kids with him
You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on
Come on
who are seated at a back table, feeding each other
Stacy looks at her finished sundae
should quit this job
'm going to get so fat working here
nobody will ever take me out
Stacy
How many times do  have to tell you
You are really going to be beautiful
someday
Thanks a lot
Linda punches Stacy lightly on the shoulder
Hey -- Ron Johnson
It's his loss
We follow Stacy, as she walks into the dining room to serve the sundae
-  - We see a group of buzz-cut young toughs, walking in formation, hunched over, sneering and wearing sleeveless
Army fatigue jackets
None of these damaged-looking kids is over the age of fourteen
They pass to reveal this legend on their backs: Angle on Mike Damone and Mark Ratner, who are standing by the upcoming concert list posted on the door to Wherehouse Records
Damone sees the Surf Nazis pass, turns to Mark Ratner, who is still wearing his Cinema Four jacket
The business is changing, Rat
'll tell you, these kids today
they don't even listen to Aerosmith
hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now
There used to be three or four of those guys
Now we see 'em every time we come to the mall
Damone is approached by a couple of young ticket Customers
#1 Got any Blue Oyster Cult tickets
No Cult
ate twenty-four pairs of Blue Oyster Cult tickets last time around
was this close to working at 7-11
No Cult
Suddenly we see all ticket business stop
Damone and his customers see someone menacingly coming directly for them
The small crowd parts as Charles Jefferson, football duffel bag in hand, walks up
With him is a thick, tough, miniature version of himself
This is Little Charles
They both stop in front of Damone
(after long look) When is Earth, Wind and Fire coming
(respectfully) 'm really not sure
haven't heard anything yet, but 'll let you know the second there is the slightest news, sir
'm taking my little brother
Excellent
So that will be two tickets
All right
Fine, sir
Jefferson and
push past the customers
#2 Wow
He really lives here thought he just flew in for the football games
(gaining composure) Shit, he's my man
He knows where to come for tickets
Damone turns to The Rat
(') Well, Rat
Are you ready for the moment of truth
The Rat adjusts his jacket, and nods
She is immune to my charms
They walk together towards Swenson's, as The Rat drapes his aqua-blue Cinema Four jacket around his shoulders, like a French film director
Damone walks a few steps, then stops Rat
Hey, Rat
Yeah
Ace the jacket
The Rat considers the suggestion, gets rid of the jacket
They continue towards Swenson's
' - The Rat pulls open the door to Swenson's
He walks toward the counter to Stacy Hamilton
Hi
May  help you
The Rat feels the beginnings of cold panic, but barges through nonetheless
Yes
have two questions
was curious
His voice becomes a shade deeper
He begins to pull The Attitude together
(') What do you do with the jackets people leave here
(smiling) We keep them
You keep them
We keep them, in case the people come back
She reaches under the counter and pulls out a cardboard box with some rumbled jackets and other items
(') Here they are
You can look through it, if you want
The Rat chuckles to himself, struggling with The Attitude
It's cool
It would take too much time to go through all that stuff
'll just pick up a new one
Stacy smiles
He's obviously awkward, and she likes it
What's your other question
My other question is
can--have your-phone-number-so--can-ask-you out-sometime
To The Rat's surprise, Stacy continues smiling
Do you have a pen
This one's out of ink
Oh
yes
He pulls one out of his jacket pocket, gives it to her
Stacy writes her name and phone number on a scrap of paper and gives it to him
The Rat looks at the paper
(') Stacy
Nice to meet you, Stacy
My name is Mark Ratner
He sticks out his hand, and they shake
We see The Rat turn around and walk out of Swenson's
' - The Rat exits with ultimate cool
He sees Damone waiting just off to the side, talking to some girls
The Rat nods, gives him the thumbs-up
Damone returns the gesture
All-Attitude
'
- Carl's is happening tonight
There are lots of kids inside
We hear charging rock music -- "Girls Got Rhythm" by / -- coming from a radio in the back kitchen
'
- Inside the bathroom, Brad Hamilton applies the Carl's scrub brush to a felt tip graffiti message near the mirror:
He pauses and catches himself in the mirror
He adjusts his hair
(talking to mirror) Lisa
have something to tell you
Look, 'm a senior now
'm a single, successful guy and 've got to be fair to myself
Lisa
think  need my freedom
Brad pauses, looks at the mirror soulfully
(') Aw, don't do that
don't take it personally, okay
Please
knew you'd understand, because
The bathroom door opens -- it's Arnold, the boy who Brad got a job
Brad
know you're on your break, but would you cover me on register three
Brad nods, exits: ' Brad stands at the register
We see a prominent display over Brad's head: 100%
The last of many harried businessmen customers gets his breakfast order and takes his seat
Brad is joined by Dennis Taylor, the Assistant Manager
Come on
Clean that counter off Brad
Let's go
Play ball
Okay, Dennis
Brad begins polishing the counter and Dennis Taylor returns to his office at the back of the kitchen
Brad watches him disappear behind the door that says:
As soon as Dennis disappears behind the door, the one Businessman in the place rises and returns to the counter
(') (nervously) May  help you
The Businessman has short, curly brown hair
He speaks in a whine
Yes
This is not the best breakfast ever ate
The Businessman points to the huge display over Brad's head:   100%
(') And  want my money back
Brad begins searching under the counter
Well,  believe you have to fill out a form
There's a pad right around here
No
want my money back right now
Well, that's not the way it works, really
And you ate most of your food already, too
See that sign
It says 100% Money Back Guarantee
Do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'
Do they teach you that here
Give me my money back
Brad begins looking to the restroom
"Where's Arnold
" can't do that
But if you wait a minute
(as if talking to a kindergartner) Look
Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2
75 back
Okay
(looks at name tag) Please, Brad
'm sorry, sir
Just let me find the forms here
am so tired
am so tired of dealing with morons
How hard is it to
Brad looks up from under the counter
No amount of pay will make him take that kind of insult
Mister, if you don't shut up, 'm gonna kick 100% of your ass
Manager
"Bam
" The door to the Assistant Manager's office swings open, and Dennis comes hurtling out of the back
Can  help you, sir
Is there a problem
You bet there's a problem
Your employee used profanity and threatened me with violence
'm shocked, frankly
've eaten here many times and 've always enjoyed the service -- until today
Angle on bathroom door as it opens and Arnold starts towards the register
He quickly sees the incident with the irate Businessman and ducks back inside the bathroom
(') All  wanted was my money back for this breakfast
It was a little undercooked
And this young man threatened me
Now  plan to write a letter
plan to
Dennis wheels around to Brad
Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way
He insulted me first
He called me a moron
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way
Yes, sir
You're fired
Brad looks around, expecting his friends to defend him
Dave and Rich seem very occupied with their work
Brad is stunned
(') (to Businessman) 'm very sorry this happened to you, sir
Thank you very much
Then Brad unhooks his fryer's apron and throws it on the counter
He grabs a backpack and walks out of the place
On the way, he bangs the bathroom door with his fist
hope you had a hell of a piss, Arnold
: '  - He arrives back in his room and locks the door
He yanks the burger picture off his wall, dumps it into the trash
Then he takes it back out of the trash and cracks the cardboard picture and plastic frame in half
We are in the middle of a deep, dark void
After a moment, a pinprick of light appears in the distance
We head towards the light
We are being led somewhere important
As we draw still closer, curtains suddenly part to reveal a wildly cheering studio audience
We hear the voice of Merv Griffin
(
) Will you please give a warm welcome to
Jeff Spicoli
The Merv Griffin Show band begins playing a Merv Griffin Show version of /'s "Highway to Hell"
Someone hands Jeff Spicoli a microphone
He works the studio audience into a frenzy as he sings the words to "Highway to Hell": Merv Griffin show style
(singing) 'Layin' ladies
Drinkin' wine
You gotta dollar -- You're a friend of mine
Gettin' loose
Feelin' fine
You and me -- It's get down time
We're on the Highway to Hell
The Highway to Hell
' Spicoli finishes up with a spectular pump
The audience goes wild as Merv Griffin greets him warmly, and guides Spicoli to his seat
Spicoli motions for the cheers to die down
Griffin is obviously happy to see him
He touches Spicoli's arm lightly
How've you been
Outrageous, Merv
Nice to be here
feel great
was going to say
your eyes look a little red
've been swimming, Merv
The audience howls
It's a famous Spicoli line
(') Seriously, Merv, everything is great
was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains
(concerned) wanted to talk a little bit about school, if  could
School
(sighs) School is no problem
All you have to do is go to get the grades
And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time
How often do you go
don't go at all
The audience is howling again
He is Merv's favorite guest
hear you brought a film clip with you
Do you want to set it up for us
Well, it pretty much speaks for itself
Peter, you want to run with it
- The film clip begins
It is a mammoth wave cresting against the blue sky
(
) Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning
(
) Fascinating
tiny figure appears at the foot of the wave
(') Who's that
That's me, Merv
The audience gasps
(
) Are you going to ride that wave
Totally
We watch as Spicoli catches the perfect wave, and it hurtles him through a turquoise tube of water
What's going through your mind right here, Jeff
The danger of it all
Merv, 'm thinking
've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards
The audience is howling once again
when suddenly we hear the loud noise of a door opening, followed by a shrill voice
It is Spicoli's eight-year-old brother, Curtis
Jeff Spicoli's dream of glory evaporates
'   - It is a messy trailer, part of a trailer park by the sea
Spicoli's area is small, but he has made it his own
The walls are covered with posters, almost all of them naked centerfolds
It is obvious Spicoli's parents are not welcome in his room
Dad says you have to get up
Ugh
He groans, starts to struggle out of bed
(') Leave me alone
Dad says you're late again, you butthole
Leave me alone
Dad says
Spicoli reaches over to the floor next to his bed
He pulls a snorkel from the mess, heaves it at the door and his little brother
It bounces off the wall and doesn't even hit Curtis, but the kid starts crying anyway
(') Daaaaaaaad
Jeff threw a snorkel at me
Spicoli gets out of bed, groans again, and kicks the door shut
celebrating the big game with rival Lincoln High School
We see Jeff Spicoli stumble from the direction of the parking lot
He heads into the gym, which is already full for a mandatory assembly
-  - Spicoli wanders into the assembly, takes a seat on a corner bleacher
He sits just below Brad Hamilton and Lisa
On podium in front of assembly, Cindy Carr and another cheerleader, Dina Phillips, are making a presentation before the school
just want to say that we are not 'Spirit Bunnies' anymore
We always hated that name
It bugged the heck out of Dina and me
It's just such a put down
They don't call the Chess Club 'Checker Champs' or anything like that
We're going to go to everything this year, you guys
We're going to go to soccer, wrestling, basketball
everything
We know you've got a lot of spirit
Everybody -- riiiiiight
And we're gonna destroy Lincoln next week
Riiiiiiight
They don't respond
who is asleep in the bleachers
sitting nearby
We hear them over the drone of the assembly
Man,  don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again
If you'd apologize  think Dennis would take you back
Apologize to that wimp
No way
Fuck Dennis Taylor
They sit in silence for a moment
(') 'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because  need you this year
(sighs) Look, Brad, 've been trying to think of a way to tell you this
We're almost out of high school, this is our last year
think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people
Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing
' as he accepts the news
(
) (') But  still want to be friends
' as it falls slack
- We're going to be going to every game this year
We just want the crowd to participate and we want spirit from every little person in this entire school
Allll-Riiiight
There is unenthusiastic, minor applause from the assembled students of Ridgemont High
Vice Principal Ray Connors, a tough-looking man with an Haldeman crew cut, approaches the podium
He has a sour look on his face
Well, thank you, girls
People, don't forget, the big game is one week away
We'll see everybody back here on Monday and have a good weekend
For the first time during this assembly, there is a loud and hearty applause
57 We are suddenly watching a movie shown on a class projection screen
We see footage of a serene, middle-class neighborhood -- as seen through the glass windshield of a car
Judging from the other vehicles parked on the street, the film is from the early Sixties
We hear the narrative voice of Desi Arnaz, speaking in his inimitable Latin accent
Driving ess an important part of each and every one of our da-ily lives
Ees a responsibility like no o-ther and ess a matter of life and
ball comes rolling out into the serene street small child runs out after it
The driving of our vehicle brakes, but not in time
The film freeze frames on the terrified face of a child about to be splattered
(') Death
There is a swell of dramatic music
(') They have foun'
The Braking Point
The words flash on the screen and we hear a high school Driver's Training class groan in mock horror
- who are seated in this class
sitting together in the class
They are oblivious, lost in conversation
What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre
You know, Mark Ratner
Oh, come on
What is he
Fifteen
Sixteen
Linda looks nauseous
Just watch out if he pulls up in a van, and then puts on a Led Zeppelin tape
The film returns to another serene street scene as seen through another front windshield
The driver here has had jus' two drinks
Two drinks at the home of a frien'
We hear the very-present sounds of Driver's Training students
#1 He's fucked-up, Ricky
#2 They guys a drunk, Ricky
And although this driver thinks he ees drivin' well, he may be 'doing okay, but he forgets to per-ceive what ees real goin' on
In the film, another car comes barreling from the left, running a stop sign and exploding into the side of the two-drink goner
In the class, the Driver's Training students are howling
- The parking lot is full
Kids and shoppers stream through the entrance in groups of all sizes
All three levels are teeming with kids
where we see Jeff Spicoli manning the Missile Command machine
Spicoli wears a red bandana across his forehead
cigarette dangles from his mouth
He is surrounded by a fleet of young surfers who listen to him with reverence
Be noble
Be aggressive
The thing about Missile Command is to decimate before you can be decimated
Just like in real life
The youngsters hang on every word of the sage advice
walking in formation
walking the mall
Check it out, Rat
The Surf Nazis
out for a Sunday stroll
Damone and The Rat walk on
The Rat is barely interested
He appears deep in thought
What do  say after she gets in the car
Damone, obviously in his element here at the mall, stops to flash a winning smile at a well-built older housewife
No problem, Rat
What you need is my special Five Point Plan
As he talks, Damone passes a Country Farms shop
He plucks a free sample of cheese and sausage
Knock it off, Damone
need real help
What do you mean
Men have died trying to obtain this information
will give it to you for free
The Rat and Damone continue on
Okay
Tell me
What's the Five Point Plan
All right
Pay attention
The Rat nods, always the student, as they pass a Wherehouse Record store
Damone stops right in front of a seductively posed life-sized cardboard stand-up of Debbie Harry, the alluring rock singer
Damone begins his speech
(') First of all, Rat
never let on how much you like a girl
Damone turns to the cardboard cutout of Debbie Harry to demonstrate
(') (disinterested) Oh
Hi
(turns back to The Rat) ) Two
Always call the shots
He turns to Debbie Harry, who looks on with an inviting cardboard smile
(') Kiss me
(to The Rat) Three
Act like wherever you are, that's the place to be
(to Debbie Harry; debonair) ) Isn't this great
(to The Rat) Four
When ordering food, find out what she wants and then order for both of you
it's a classy move
(to Debbie Harry; Cary Grant) And the lady will have
(to The Rat) Five
And this is most important
When you get down to making out, whenever possible, put on the first side of Led Zeppelin
(to Debbie Harry; seductive) Why don't you put this tape on
It sounds great in the back of my van
why don't we listen from there
with the same inviting smile
(') And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat
Voila
You can't miss
think 've got it
Once  get going, 'll be okay
But
how do get started
mean,  hardly know her
You wuss
It's no problem
One person says something to the other and that's how it starts
Standing there in the front of the Wherehouse, The Rat nods his head and smiles
He's finally beginning to understand, and we
: '  - We see The Rat behind the wheel of a green Volvo
Stacy sits beside him
They are driving the streets of Ridgemont
' This is it
The Big Date
"Led Zeppelin " is on the car stereo of his sister's van
Finally
Thanks for coming to get me
Sure thing
Silence
' He rounds the corner of Luna Street, off the neon fast-food stand that is Ridgemont Drive
' Yet another silence has fallen
Then, after a time
This is a nice car
Yeah
It's my sister's
Silence
Do you have Mrs
George for English
Yeah
She is pretty good
Yeah
She is pretty good
- They pull into the parking lot of a steak and lobster house called The Atlantis
Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant
've heard that, too
The Rat finds a parking spot near the back of the lot, grateful that the long silence is over
He walks with Stacy to the front of The Atlantis
- The Rat and Stacy are escorted by the host to a nearby table
They are given large wooden menus
Do you know what you want
think 'll have the Seafood Salad Special
Excellent
The Rat leans back in the booth
He is starting to feel in control now
Then something hits him
The panic sweeps across his face
Slowly, The Rat reaches back to check his wallet
It's gone
Are you all right
(weakly) Oh yeah
Cool
Cool was the name of the game
Stay cool
(') Do you mind if  excuse myself for a moment
Not at all
Just as The Rat is about to get up, the Waitress approaches the table
Are you ready to order here
Well
sure
(settles back down) She will have the Seafood Salad Special
And  will have
the same
Anything to drink
Two Cokes
Okay
Thanks
The Rat gets back up again, looking paler by the minute
He excuses himself and walks over to the pay phone by the Atlantis toilets
The Rat dials a number
Damone answers
'  - He is sitting in a chair, leaning onto the back two legs, watching television
Yo
(
) Damone
It's Mark
Mark
What happened to your date
It's happening right now
'm here at the Atlantis
Everything's fine except
left my wallet at home
Did you go home and get it
No
It's too late
The food is coming and everything
Damone, 've got to ask you this favor, and 'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other
Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here
There is silence
(') Damone, are you there
(world-weary sigh) 'm really pretty busy
' as we see the flickering images of Leave It To Beaver
(') You owe me for this one
The Rat hangs up, mildly relieved, and returns to the table
: '  - The Rat and Stacy have finished the meal, and desert
as it sits in a little tray before The Rat
The Waitress approaches the table
It is clear she wants to make room for other customers and bigger tips
Are you sure there's nothing else can bring you
'll have one more Coke
Do you want another Coke, Stacy
(quizzical) ) Sure
'll
have another Coke
Two more Cokes
(sarcastic) Two
more
Cokes
as Mike Damone finally walks in
Damone looks over the diners, then feigns great surprise when he sees The Rat
Hey, Mark
Is that you
Damone
You come here
come for the seafood
It's great
Hey
you know what, Mark
found your wallet the other day
You want it back
Wow
've been looking for that thing
Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton
Stacy, this is Mike Damone
Stacy smiles politely, with the slightest sparkle in her eye, as the Waitress returns with the two Cokes
Well, 've gotta be running
Okay
See ya
looking strangely at the proceedings
Nice to meet you, Stacy
Nice to meet you
Damone leaves
The Rat takes a few quick gulps of Coke, and gets up to pay the bill
As he moves out of camera range, we see the strange look on the faces of waitresses and diners
'  - The Rat pulls up to Stacy's house in the cul-de sac
He stares straight ahead, like a zombie
had a really nice time tonight
Me, too
'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck
The Rat nods glumly
never thought it would happen at The Atlantis
Jeez
Do you want to come inside
Aren't your parents asleep
No, they're away for the weekend
Brad and  are watching the house
Okay
Sure
'll come in
We see a confused but interested look on The Rat's face
- They walk in the front door
The Rat stands uncomfortably in the doorway to the living room
Where's your brother
don't know
Probably out
Want something to drink
No
That's okay
Well, 'm going to change real quick
hope you don't mind
Naw
don't mind
Stacy turns her back and pulls up her hair
Will you unzip me
' as the wheels inside his mind start to spin
This can't be what it seems
He unzips Stacy, past her bra, down to the small of her back
It's the first time he's ever done anything like that
(') Thanks
She walks down the hall to her room, easing out of her dress as she walks
She leaves the door to her room open
(') You can come in, if you want
' He is completely unsure of himself, as he begins to walk down the hall
His heart pounds into his throat
He turns the corner and steps into Stacy's room
'  - Stacy stands there, looking gorgeous in an almost seethrough white robe
The Rat pretends not to notice
So
pretty nice house you've got here
Thanks
So
(puts hands on hips) What do you want to do
' as he struggles with the memory of Damone's words
"Always call the shots
" don't know
Do you want to see some pictures kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high
How stupid, right
Sure
Stacy goes to her closet, reaches up to grab the books from the top shelf
The Rat watches her robe slip up her legs
Then she sits down next to him
Her knee grazes his
It is almost too much for The Rat
Go for it
We see The Rat struggle with the action of putting his arm around her
He almost does, but then reacts as she says suddenly
This is me in the eighth grade
Did you have Mr
Deegan
(looking pained) Oh, yeah
had Mr
Deegan
Her knee grazes him again
Does she expect something
(') Look, Stacy,  want you to know that
The Rat struggles
Try as he might, he can't seem to cross the line
He can't make his move
He is woeful as he completes the sentence
(') 've got to go home
Do you really have to go
Well
it's getting kind of late
Suddenly, The Rat is seized with ambition
He reaches one hand around her right shoulder and plants the other hand directly on her left breast
It looks something like a wrestling hold
The Rat looks at Stacy
Stacy looks back at The Rat
The Rat is absolutely frozen
guess it is getting late, Mark
She shrugs him off, walks him to the door
- We see The Rat's forlorn face as he trudges towards his car
He stops
He takes a breath -- it wasn't that late, he really didn't want to leave
The Rat turns and begins walking back up the Hamilton steps
Just as he does so, Stacy's bedroom light clicks off
It was too late
He kicks at his car
You blew it, asshole
Behind him, recklessly speeding towards Ridgemont Drive, is Charles Jefferson's blue Mustang
/
- Jeff Spicoli is behind the wheel
Sitting next to him is Little Charles, "
", Jefferson's younger brother
They're smoking grass and holding Lowenbrau beers in between their legs
The radio is blasting the music of Rick James
Hey, slow down
This is my brother's car
thought he was out of town
He is
Then don't hassle it
They speed off down Ridgemont
Seen the new Playboy
Naw
Any good
Suzanne Somers' tits
All right
like sex
Spicoli sees something in the rearview mirror
Hold your beer down,
,  think it's a cop
Spicoli slows down
The car behind him slows down
(') This is a cop
He's definitely cruising me at busting distance
The high beams switch on behind Spicoli
(') What the fuck is this guy doing
The car behind Spicoli then advances to the point where it is now almost touching the blue Mustang
(') What the fuck is this guy doing
This ain't no cop
The mystery car bumps them lightly from behind
(') Hey
He's gonna scratch my brother's car
The two boys start yelling
High beams fill the Mustang with bright light and
/ Then mystery car pulls back, then up alongside Spicoli and
on the left
We hear the music on the radio of George Thoroughgood's "Ride On, Josephine"
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada
They're fuckin' with us
The drivers of the two cars eye each others
Then the Granada begins inching over, trying to force Spicoli off the road
(') My brother's car
All right
Die, Granada Jocks
Spicoli guns ahead, in a real bullet move, and easily overtakes the Granada
Spicoli is proud of himself
He checks himself out in the rearview and turns to
(') Would you roll your window up, It's messing my hair
Spicoli pulls way ahead of the Granada, while
rolls his window up
Spicoli looks over to
and smiles wickedly
Now Spicoli wants to show off
He pushes the pedal to the floor
We just missed the turnoff to the party
You know the thing  love about Mustangs
The steering wheel
Spicoli fingers the bubbles in the wheel
(') With a genuine Mustang steering wheel, you can negotiate a hairpin turn with ease, my man
/ on the word "ease", Spicoli curls his finger into one of the Mustang steering wheel bubbles and whips it clockwise
The idea is to turn off onto a side street and head back to the party
But instead, at the moment of the hairpin turn,
is attempting to switch the radio station
Spicoli crooks his finger farther into the bubble than he expected
The car swings in a complete circle, a circle that includes a bright yellow fire hydrant
The hydrant rips the side of the car open like a can of tuna
There is a silent moment of terror
Are you okay
There is silence
Outside the smashed car, the Granada Jocks pass Spicoli and
Fuck youuuuuuuuuu
Then
stirs and utters his first words
My brother is going to kill us
He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me
He's gonna kill us
Just be glad you're all right
My brother is gonna shit
Make up your mind
Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us
First he's gonna shit
And then he's gonna kill us
Will you just relax, mon
He's not gonna kill us
My father is a television repairman
He's got all kinds of tools
can fix-this car
You can't fix this car, Spicoli
waffled and mangled
It is just inches away from scrap iron
can fix it
as we see Ridgemont High gearing up for its big Homecoming Game against Lincoln
We see a series of shots of kids talking about it, wagering on the chances of a Ridgemont victory
We see the many signs and placards all over school, proclaiming Ridgemont revenge
We see students lining up to vote for Homecoming King and Queen in the gymnasium
It is the most spirit that Ridgemont has shown this year
: -  - From the back of the parking lot, we see a crowd around the flagpole
group of kids are staring at something
They sadly shake their heads at the sight, as if they are witnessing a funeral
As we draw closer, we see the center of commotion
It is an ugly sight
Someone had wrecked Charles Jefferson's Blue Scholarship Mustang and welded it to the flagpole
Spray-painted on the side was the message:
- The Ridgemont football bleachers are full of cheering students
We see the same basic groups from lunch court, and many more
The cheerleaders are on the field -- Cindy Carr, Dina Phillips and company -- and their cheerleader "husbands" sit directly in front of them in the stands
Linda and Stacy sit in the bleachers with some of the Swenson's girls
The Rat and Damone sit several rows above them, watching
The teachers sit together in another section
who is again sitting alone in the bleachers
Watching
Several old lunch court friends pass by, on their way to the concession area
#1 Hey, Brad
How's going
All right
#2 Where you working
Fish and chips place
#1 Which one
Just a fish and chips place
Brad says nothing more
The students look at each other
We'll be seeing you, Brad
(sullen) Later
-   - Everyone is cheering the amazing game on the field
Charles Jefferson is poised on the offensive line
He mutters a string of obscenities at the opposing Lincoln player
The ball is snapped, and Charles Jefferson comes directly at the player with both elbows up and angled to hit inside his helmet
The Lincoln player is hit and keels over
Charles Jefferson sets up for another play
The ball is snapped
Ka-boom
Down falls another Lincoln player
Jefferson doesn't know who it was who wrecked his Mustang, but he wasn't about to spare any of them
There is pure madness in his eyes
It has taken him over
The Ridgemont points rack up
Jefferson is single handedly maiming Lincoln for Homecoming
- We see Jeff Spicoli and
sitting calmly in the bleachers, watching
think we may have gotten away clean
The half-time gun fires and the score is 36-7
Ridgemont
Even the Ridgemont players steer clear of Charles Jefferson as they return to their locker room
-   - Linda and Stacy are sitting by the pool, dressed in string tie bathing suits
They are listening to the music of Tom Petty's "Breakdown" playing on the living room stereo
Linda luxuriously applies suntan lotion to her chest and legs, in long and writhing strokes
Stacy reads a book
It's called Total Orgasm
Several beats pass
sent a letter to Doug today
'll be so glad when he gets out here
(engrossed in book) You really ought to look at this, Linda
There's a drawing on every page
and all these quizzes
It's like school
Why don't you put your mother's secret book back
Linda continues regally applying lotion
Listen to this
'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones
' (automatic) Okay, penis, that's one, balls
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category
You're right
Probably penis, mouth and neck
All right
Here's another one
'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together
' Climax together
Does that ever happen
No
But it's a nice idea
Listen to this
it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't have real orgasms
' Linda stops applying lotion, considers that thought
Well
they obviously don't know about Doug
They laugh
Linda resumes applying the lotion
Stacy continues reading the book
couple of beats pass
How long does Doug take
don't know
Thirty to forty minutes
(pause) What's Doug do in Chicago
He works for the airline
He'll be out here
You'll meet him
Stacy looks at Linda, almost disbelieving
(') (wistful) He's no high school boy
There is a noise by the side fence leading into the Hamiltons' backyard
It is Mark Ratner and Mike Damone
They are already wearing swimsuits
Hey
We came over to help you with Math homework
Oh, really
Really
We figured you needed the help
On such a hot day
Stacy quickly stashes the book in a stack of towels beside her
She leans over to Linda and speaks confidentially
What do you think
think they're both virgins
Stacy smiles, gets up and goes over to the fence
didn't ask for any help
Did you, Linda
No
Well, that's exactly why  brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi
-kay, you guys can come swimming
But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home
Okay
Mike Damone yells "banzai
" and dives into the small pool
At one end of the pool is the jacuzzi, which is separated by a tile wall
Damone has already poured the Wisk into the jacuzzi, and the detergent has created a huge bubble bath effect
Damone surfaces and flips into the jacuzzi
Stacy, looking great in a green bikini, sits kicking her legs by the side of the pool
Linda stands on the board
She is poised to dive
The Rat treads water and stares at both girls
Inside the Hamilton living room, the family stereo plays the music of Deep Purple's "Woman From Tokyo"
Hey, Linda
'll judge your dive
'm a champion diver myself
Brad arrives home by the side gate and slams it behind him
He is home from a bad day at work
He walks out onto the patio and stands with his hands on his hips
For the first time, our former campus hero looks absurd
He is still in his uniform from Captain Kidd Fish and Chips -- it is a blue and white striped Pirates of the Caribbean outfit, complete with black plastic sword at the side, and a ridiculously large Ponce de Leon-esque hat
Brad carries the hat under his arm
Does Mom know you have company
It's just Linda
And Mark from school
Brad ignores the underclassmen, and notices Linda on the board in her maroon bikini
He smiles
Hi, Linda
Hi, Brad
Well, you guys, keep it down
've got some work to do upstairs
Brad turns and heads back inside
He is just out of earshot when they begin talking about him
God, he hardly even talks anymore
know
He hates to have to wear uniforms
Poor guy
Really
Stacy breaks the spell by jumping into the water, surfacing, and flipping over the tile wall into the Jacuzzi
She sits next to Damone, looking mischievous
talking while the others are at the other end of the pool
casually catching sight of them together from the other side of the pool
We can read the emotions on The Rat's face
He is still taken with Stacy, but his big moment for her appears to have passed
as they talk
Underneath the water, her leg accidentally knocks against his
Then he feels her continue
Damone feels Stacy's cool hand on his inner thigh
Moving upwards, stopping just short of the bulge in his trunks
' as it loosens and quivers just the slightest bit
This is uncharted territory, even for Mr
Attitude
who is now sunning herself by the side of the pool
She rubs her legs against each other, slowly, enjoying the hot afternoon
'  - who is watching Linda from the window in his room
We see him from behind, peeking out the curtains
- who smiles at Damone and flips back into the pool with a splash
Damone steals a look down at his swimsuit
He's popped a big one
Why don't you get up and do a dive, Mike
Go ahead
' and we know he can't get out of the water yet
No
don't think so
Not right now
Chicken
Linda, for one, loses interest quickly
Standing by the side of the pool, she jams a finger in her ear and wiggles it
Stacy
've got water in my ears
Do you have any -Tips
God,  don't think so
Better look in the house
Linda towels off and heads back inside the Hamilton house
She knows how to walk
'    - We see Brad's room
The Carl's burger picture on the wall is conspicuously missing
There is music playing from his stereo -- Pink Floyd's "You and Me"
We see Brad
He is kneeling on the bathroom floor, his back to us
His green -shirt is on, his underwear in a pile on the floor behind him
His arm is pumping slowly
Brad is jacking off
: - ' It features Linda Barrett, just as she stood on the diving board a moment ago
She is gorgeous
Her breasts seem even bigger than usual
Her nipples are hard, poking through the film maroon string bikini
Water rolls slowly down her cheeks, into the corners of her mouth
Her lips are parted slightly
Her eyes are filled with desire as she says
Hi, Brad
(pause) You know how cute  always thought you were
think you're so sexy
Will you come to me
in a nice shirt, his hair combed back and looking great
He walks to Linda
She reaches out and grabs him for a kiss, pulling him close
Then she pushes him away, so he can watch as she carefully unstraps the top of her bathing suit
The incredible Linda Barrett's breasts fall loose
She takes Brad's hands and places them on her, as she begins unbuttoning his shirt
They are just about to fall into passionate lovemaking when we hear
(
) (') Hey, Brad
Do you have any -Ti
The daydream evaporates and we see real life again with an
'  -   ' in the doorway of Brad's bathroom as she watches the sight before her
trying to cover himself and act nonchalant and keep his back turned at the same time
The words barely escape his mouth
Wait just a
minute
Sorry
didn't know anybody was in here
Linda turns and goes immediately, as if she wants to forget what she saw as quickly as possible
She closes the door behind her
still kneeling
It had all happened so quickly, so fast Doesn't anybody fuckin' knock anymore
He slams the toilet seat down and we
: - The third attendance bell rings, and Mr
Hand strides to the front of the class
He locks the door
Then he takes the front of the class and notices something very different
bright and clear-eyed, sitting in the front row
His hands are clasped in front of him on the desk
His textbook is open to the proper page
Mr
Hand is suspicious, but continues with class
Now in 1898, Spain owned Cuba
Outright
Think about it
Cuba, owned by a disorganized parliament 4,000 miles away
Cubans were in a constant state of revolt
Mr
Hand begins pacing the aisles as he talks
(') In 1904, the United States decided to throw a little weight around, and
There is a brief, sharp knock at the door
Mr
Hand whips his head around, like McGarrett
He approaches the door like a cat
(') (sweet voice) Who is it
Mr
Pizza
Again
Mr
Pizza, sir
Hand swings the door open, out of curiosity
In walks a young Man in a Mr
Pizza delivery shirt
Okay, who had the double cheese sausage and bologna
Jeff Spicoli speaks up
That's me
The Delivery Man takes the pizza, sets it on the desk, as Spicoli whips out some crumpled dollars
Then he produces yet another crumpled dollar, and presses it into the Delivery Man's hand
(') For you, my man
The Delivery Man thanks him warmly, just as Mr
Hand rages into the picture
Am  hallucinating here
Just what in the hell do you think you're doing
Learning about Cuba
Having some food
Mr
Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here
You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time
(cool and urbane) 've been thinking about this, Mr
Hand
If 'm here
and you're here
doesn't that make it our time
Mr
Hand is so furious he's almost shaking
(') So  thought 'd order us a pizza
Just leave me a lot of bologna
Mr
Hand snatches up the pizza, and starts to throw it in the wastebasket
Then he thinks better, and heads for the door
He opens it just as a gang of young Stoners walk past
#1 There's the pizza
#2 Totally
Mr
Hand pushes the pizza into their hands and slams the door
You better save some for me, you swine
And you, my friend
'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week
Spicoli eases back in his chair, shrugs
It was a good idea at the time
- Brad Hamilton, looks terribly uncomfortable in his Ponce de Leon hat and buccaneer uniform
He rings up an order for an older Customer
Why aren't you in school, son
go to school in the mornings have a work study program for the afternoon
He bags one final coffee and punches up the amount
$8
46, please
Here you go
have it exactly
(sets money down) Good luck
Thank you, and thanks for coming to Captain Kidd
Brad loosens his buccaneer scarf, and starts back towards the kitchen
He is stopped by the sudden appearance of Captain Kidd Assistant Manager, Harold
Hamilton
'll take over the fryer
Those boys at  need some Catch of-the-Day boxes, and  told them you would personally deliver them within the hour
'll reimburse you for gas
Brad dutifully unhooks his apron, to reveal the bottom half of his pirate suit
Just write me out a bill
While Harold leans down to tally up the fish order, Brad goes to a nearby employee's closet
He has completely perfected the art of changing back into his street clothes, and it takes less than a minute
He is just about to finish buttoning his street shirt when Harold sees him
Hamilton, come over here
What is that you've got on
This is how  dress all the time
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform
thought 'd take it off for the drive over to
It's kind of uncomfortable
Harold can barely fathom the idea
Come on, Hamilton
You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips
We have stores all over Southern California
Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms
You know that
You really want me to put all this stuff back on
Yes
think so
Show some pride, Hamilton
as he stands there, stoic looking
don't believe you're asking me to do this, but okay
He begins taking off his street shirt
He looks at Harold, looks at the boxes, and returns to the closet
Brad is driving down the freeway, listening to the music of Bruce Springsteen's "Out in the Streets
" He pries open one of the fourteen Catch-of-the-Day boxes on the seat next to him and pulls out a small piece of fried fish
Brad takes a bite
The look on his face says it is the worst piece of shit he has ever tasted
He throws the piece out the window, and drives on
Brad turns to see a girl smiling at him from another car
It makes his afternoon
He returns the smile with gusto
as she bursts out laughing and drives away
looking perplexed
Then he realizes that he hasn't taken his Ponce de Leon hat off
Brad drives on
' as we see the Cruising Vessel move down the highway
We see the Captain Kidd hat go flying out the window
Then the plastic sword, and the scarf
Then a couple boxes of Captain Kidd fish
Then the rest of them
We see Brad rip past the Building
: - School is out and kids are leaving campus, heading for the parking lot and bus stop
We see Mike Damone carrying some books, walking towards Ridgemont Drive
He is joined by Stacy Hamilton, who hurries to catch up to him
can't wait until  can drive next year
walk every day
It's such a drag
Get a ride with somebody
Sometimes  get a ride with my brother
But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself
What a guy
Damone turns to her after a moment, all Attitude
(') You know Mark Ratner really likes you
You like him
Mark is a really nice boy
Stacy walks along, then stops and looks at Damone
(') But  think  like you
They turn the corner
They have arrived at Stacy's house
There are no cars parked out front
No one is home
Do you want to come in for a second
The Attitude starts to weaken
After a long pause, Damone responds
Do you have any ice tea
Sure
Come on in
Stacy unlocks her front door, they go inside
Damone stands in the white linoleum Hamilton kitchen
Stacy opens the refrigerator door
guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon
Are you going to get one
don't know
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out
know what  look like
Stacy places a glass of ice tea in front of him
They are all alone in the house
Do you want to take a quick swim
Well
Brad probably has some trunks you can borrow
'm going to my room to change
Damone stares straight ahead
She's going to her room to change
Stacy scoots down the hall toward her bedroom
This is great ice tea
'  - In the middle of changing, she has caught her own reflection in the mirror
She pauses a moment, looking at the young girl looking back
- He continues staring straight ahead
(from other room) You don't have to shout
You can come back here to my room
Damone doesn't move
He pretends he doesn't hear moment later, Stacy comes bounding back down the hall in her green bikini
She grabs Damone by the arm
Come with me
know there's a suit in the changing room
She pulls him away
They enter the wood-panelled changing room next to the Hamilton pool
There are two swimsuits hanging from wooden pegs
Pick a suit
don't know
It's getting pretty late
She locks the door to the changing room and begins to walk towards Mike Damone
Are you really a virgin
Come on
He could feel his leg starting to shake the slightest bit
It's okay if it's your first time
She gives him a kiss
Listen
feel pretty strange here
Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend
He's my friend, too
She gives him another kiss
He kisses her in return
Standing there, feeling Stacy in her bikini, feeling her kiss him, Damone also felt some of his reservations slip away
You're a really good kisser
So are you
(pause) Are you shaking
(shaking) No
Are you crazy
It is clear that this is as far as Mr
Attitude has ever gotten with a girl
Stacy takes the initiative, rubbing her hands through his hair, rubbing his sides, kissing his neck, then pulling away
(whispers) Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike
You first
How about both of us at the same time
Damone nods, and watches as Stacy unhooks her top and steps out of her bikini bottom
She stands naked in the shadows of the afternoon sun
She sits down naked on a red changing room couch, and gathers her legs up to her chest
She watches as Damone struggles with his clothes
hopping on one leg, pulling first out of his pants, then his jockey underwear
Bashfully, he goes to sit next to Stacy on the couch
They begin to kiss, and it quickly escalates into heavy petting
Stacy pulls away
want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not
Let's continue
Stacy leans back and pulls him on top of her
He enters her and begins pumping so hard, so fast, that he doesn't notice he's banging the sofa into the wall of the changing room
But just as quickly as Damone starts, he stops
(whispers) Hey, Mike
What
Are you all right
think we're making a lot of noise
'm sorry
'm really sorry
He has a strange look on his face
What's wrong
think  came
Didn't you feel it
guess  did
They lay there, Damone still on top of her on the red couch
as we read the confusion on his face
He is embarrassed, a little confused
mostly he just wants to be alone
've got to get home
've really got to go, Stacy
as she looks up at him
She gives him a kiss
Damone gets up puts his pants and shirt on
He leaves the changing room
: - We see Stacy sitting at her usual seat, and she's wearing a bright spring dress with a slight amount of makeup
She looks at Damone's seat with anticipation, but it remains empty as other students file in
Finally, she turns to The Rat
Where's Mike today
Today's April 16th
Damone never comes to school on April 16th
What's April 16th
It's John Bonham's birthday
John Bonham
John Bonham
The drummer for Led Zeppelin
He died a couple years ago
Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded
It's like his own holiday
Oh
see
The bell rings, and Mr
Vargas enters the room with his Sanka cup
'  - Seated at the desk is Mrs
'Rourke
There is a knock at the door
The door swings open
Brad Hamilton holds out his yellow slip
' Have a seat, Brad
Brad have you got your list of college applications
Well, to tell you the truth Mrs
'Rourke, 've kind of been putting it off
'm not sure what  want to do yet
' (by rote) All right Brad
Let me ask you like this
If  were queen of the world, and  could make you whatever you wanted to be, what would it be
don't know
Burt Reynolds
There is no humor on Mrs
'Rourke's face
' realize it's important to have fun in your senior year, with your friends, but there comes a time when you have to get serious about your future, think about college, and put aside all this fun
Brad looks up suddenly
You know what, Mrs
'Rourke broke up with my girlfriend this year
lost my job at Carl's, and two other places
wake up at 5:30 to work at 7-11, then  go to school, then  go back to 7-11 have to pay rent, you know
My grades haven't been that bad, and now you're telling me that the fun is over
Well, 'm still waiting for the fun to start
' Brad, 'll see you when 'm through with the rest of the seniors
If you want to visit the career office, go right ahead
'll talk to you when you're more prepared
Brad gathers his books and opens the door to leave
Next
An absolutely exuberant Cindy Carr pops her head in the door
Hi-yeeeeeeee
: - The bell has just rung, and Mike Damone comes out of Youth and Law class
He has an absorbed, driven look on his face
He walks past the rows of lockers, and doesn't even notice as he passes Stacy Hamilton standing by her locker
She smiles, grabs his arm affectionately
Hi Mike
Damone turns to see her, is thoroughly unimpressed
Oh
Hi
didn't see you this morning
Look, 'm kind of in a hurry
'm in a hurry too
just thought could say hi to you
Hello
He pulls away, leaving a bewildered Stacy standing by her locker
She grabs some books and hurries in the other direction
- The bus pulls up to the front entrance of University Hospital
The students file out and collect next to the front door
Mr
Vargas gleefully addresses the class
This is his favorite field trip
Today we're going to explore how this hospital works to preserve human life
We'll be visiting every floor, every level where these fine doctors and nurses take care of us, in life
and in death
The class exits from a hospital elevator, onto another floor
They are now standing outside the maternity ward
We hear the loud noise of babies
Over thirty children are delivered here each day
The class moves on
The class exits another hospital elevator
This is part of your third quarter exam, and 'd advise you to take careful notes on what we're about to see
a young intern who has joined the class for the last part of their tour
May  just ask you one last time to conduct yourselves with the utmost maturity
The kids are beginning to get very nervous now as they are led down the hall to the "Cold Room
" The door to the "Cold Room" has only one sign on it
It reads:  --
Mr
Vargas opens the door, and the class seems to gasp
There are six examination tables in the "Cold Room"
Each of them contains a cadaver covered by a white sheet
Mr
Vargas has gathered the class around one table in particular
He fingers the edge of the white sheet as he talks
As you know, all the bodies in this room are recently deceased human bio-structures
student raises his hand
Yes, Randy
Who are these guys
Most of them were derelicts, Randy
They sold the right for medical examination of their bodies for money
Something like thirty dollars,  believe
Isn't that right, Doctor Miller
Twenty-five dollars
who turns to Stacy
Twenty-five bucks is pretty good
Now this gentleman here is named Arthur
Arthur died from heart failure last week and we are fortunate enough to view his body in its pristine state
Mr
Vargas suddenly pulls the white sheet aside and we see the body of Arthur
The students' eyes widen
Some gasp
Others cover their mouths
Others begin furious notes
Nobody speaks
The body of Arthur is smallish and withered
It is orange, flaky, and not quite real looking
deep cut has been made in Arthur's chest
Mr
Vargas bends Arthur upright for a better student view
He gestures to the deep cut made in Arthur's chest
The tension mounts
(') This incision allows us to pull aside the skin covering of the chest cavity and really observe the human organs as they exist in their natural state
and his shrunken face, which seems to say please don't
(') want all of you to take a look at the chest cavity for just a moment
Mr
Vargas grabs the two sides of Arthur's chest cavity covering, and rips it open
(') Here we have the human lungs and heart, which you can see is actually located in the center of your chest
With a squish, Mr
Vargas reaches inside Arthur and pulls out the human heart for display
The class stands in silent shock
Only one comment escapes from any of them
Bitchin'
who goes running out of the "Cold Room", holding her mouth
The Rat runs after her
Rat and Stacy sit side-by-side on some orange plastic chairs, by a nurse's desk
Stacy is shook up
made a fool of myself
Nobody noticed
Don't worry about it
We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in
What about the notes
'll get you the notes
She squeezes his arm
- The students file out of the hospital, looking like they've just been through a war
'  - It is night, and Linda and Stacy are watching Fantasy Island
You see, Tatoo, what this man doesn't realize is that he must one day leave Fantasy Island
And he must continue his life as an incurable leper
Stacy is fighting back tears
Linda looks angry
Telephone rings
Linda jumps to get it
Hello
Linda obviously is disappointed when she hears a female voice
(') Yeah
you're kidding
What did he say
What did you say
How much did it cost
Look, tell him he can have a relationship with you or a 'more open' relationship with someone else
Listen, Debbie, can call you later
'm waiting for Doug to call
She plops back on the couch with Stacy
(') 'll bet he forgets to call again
She notices that Stacy is crying over the  show
(') God, Stacy, it's not that sad
It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban
don't know, 'm just so depressed
Everything is just so
depressing
Linda shuts off the television
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks
don't know
just don't feel right
Linda sits down next to Stacy on the bed
What do you think it is
What do you think it is
It couldn't be
It could be
had a pregnancy test at the clinic
'll find out Monday
guess it was Damone
Of course it was Damone
If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here
'm not going to tell him
He's an asshole
hate him
But it costs money to have an abortion
Even at the Free Clinic
You tell Damone to pay for it
It's the least he can do
It's the guy's responsibility too
She puts the  back on and they watch
You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys
What
You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great
but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old
You're right
didn't tell you that
- Stacy Hamilton is walking towards Mike Damone on the football field
We see him from a distance, timing track runners
What's going on
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and  have to tell you about it
What
Now
He clicks off the time on a runner, and then turns to face her
(') Why don't you call me up tonight
Mike
want you to know that 'm pregnant
as she looks down
They are words she never thought she would be speaking
How do you know it's mine
We only did it once
know it's yours
as he realizes she is sincere, and he truly begins to panic
You made me do it
You locked the door
You made me do it
You wanted it more than me
She does not flinch
Take that back
All right,  take it back
He hugs his arms tighter across his chest, and decides to try a more mature tact
(') There's only one thing we can do
We've got to get rid of it
We've got to get an abortion
We've got to get an abortion
Yeah
My brother Art got his girlfriend one once
It's already planned, Mike
It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic
Doesn't sound free to me
(pause) So you want me to pay for it
Half
Okay
(bites back tears) Seventy-five dollars
And a ride to the clinic
Seventy-five dollars, and a ride
Okay
Stacy stands there, hands folded, nodding
: '  - He is working at his desk, counting through a wad of money
in front of him, which has a split line down the middle
People Who Owe Me -- fifteen dollars Rick
People  Owe -seventy-five dollars  Speedwagon tickets, seventy-five dollars abortion
Damone counts fifteen dollars into his stack, crosses out Rick
Then he counts through the money
Seventy five dollars exactly
He crosses out  Speedwagon tickets
This leaves him no money for the abortion
- Here, at the same corner where she once waited for Ron Johnson, Stacy waits for Damone
Cars pass, no Damone
- Stacy is on the phone, calling Damone
We see the phone messages sheet that lists two calls for Stacy, and none for Brad
The line rings four times, then it's answered
Hello
Hello
is Mike there
Hold on
Stacy sags, disbelieving, and looks at the clock on the kitchen wall
It's getting late
(') He says he's helping his father in the garage and he'll call you back
Stacy is stunned
(') Hello
Stacy hangs up
She punches out another number, quickly
(
) Hello
Hi, Mrs
Barrett
Is Linda there
(
) She went off to the beach
She'll be back later, though
Okay
Thanks
She looks at the clock again, then hears a noise in the driveway
(') Brad
Hey, wait a second
She runs out
- Brad and Stacy pull up next to the flea market
Yeah
This is it
have some shopping to do
See you later
Thanks a lot, Brad
really appreciate it
She gets out of the car
Stacy Hamilton watches her brother drive away
Then she looks to both sides, and walks on
She passes the entrance to the Flea Market
She walks around the corner to another building marked -
Brad follows her in the rearview mirror
Stacy is lying in bed wearing a paper dress
Her hair is stuffed in paper shower cap
She looks anxious
In a bed next to her an older girl is being affectionate with her visiting boyfriend
Nurse comes in with an
This is going to prick a little
She sticks the needle into Stacy's hand
Stacy looks pained but doesn't yell
The Nurse pats the rolling bed
(') Now scoot over here
Stacy moves onto it
Looking up from her point of view, we see the ride out of the room and into: Stacy gets wheeled in
The Doctor looks down at her
Hello, Stacy, 'm Doctor Bartell
Stacy moves onto the operating table as the Nurse and Doctor get ready
(') Any questions before we begin
This is going to hurt, isn't it
We'll use a local but you'll feel some pressure
It doesn't last that long
Does it hurt more to have a baby
The Doctor pauses and considers her question
Yes
but  think you mind it less
Stacy looks up at the lights and listens to the sound of suction tubes
The other girl and Stacy sit at a table eating toast and jelly
The girl is reading
The Nurse enters
How are we doing in here
Debbie, ready to leave
The girl nods and gets up
(') Right through here
Stacy,  can't let you go unless you have a ride home
Uh, my boyfriend said held be waiting downstairs
The Nurse studies her, decides she's telling the truth and allows her to leave
Stacy walks back out into the sunlight, slowly and weakly
She is surprised and amazed at who she sees standing outside, waiting for her
He stands, hands on hips, just outside the door
Brad
He puts an arm around her and leads her toward his waiting car
Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway
Brad
Please don't tell Mom and Dad
He helps her into the cruising vessel
He starts up the car and drives off
Who did it
Stacy stares out the window
Tears well in her eyes
(') You're not going to tell me, are you
No
All right, then
It's your secret
Stacy smiles at Brad
Brad smiles back
The car drives on
'  - Stacy is in Linda's room, sitting on her bed
Her eyes are red and moist from crying
Linda listens to her story
really thought he would show up
waited
and waited
and waited
That little prick
Then  called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father
That little prick
paid for it and everything
There goes your stereo for another year
Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick
'm not letting him get away with this
Don't do anything, Linda
'd rather just forget about it don't even like the guy
Stacy, he's not a guy
(loud) He's a little prick
Stacy lies back on the bed
- The front door to the Damone house opens, and out walks Mike Damone carrying some books
He looks troubled, burdened, and stares down at the walkway as he moves towards his car
He walks around, starts to pen the car door, then he sees it
There, in white spray paint across the driver's door, is the message:
Shhhhhhhhhit
He looks both ways, and starts back towards the house
Mike Damone travels down Ridgemont Drive, making the turn into the school parking lot
There is a large cardboard panel taped on the side of his car
' He arrives at his locker, where, in white spray paint, there is another message:
Several girls walk by, they laugh knowingly
#1 Hi, Mike
#2 Hi, mike
Damone backs up against the locker, with a sick smile on his face
Hi
girls
More students pass, looking strangely at the young man pinned against his own locker
'   - Damone exits the boys locker room
Just as he does, he is accosted by The Rat
We have never quite heard this tone in The Rat's voice before
Damone
What happened between you and Stacy
Damone feigns The Attitude, shakes his head
Damone sighs
Let me tell you something, Rat
Sometimes girls just go haywire
It was a month ago, 've been trying to think of a way to tell you ever since
We started messing around and
(shrugs) something happened
It's all over with
It's no big deal never called her again
The Rat says nothing
(') If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive
You understand what 'm saying
No Damone
don't understand
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway
Hey fuck you Damone
There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy
What have you got to prove
Jesus
'm sorry
always stick up for you
Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot --  say 'You just don't know Damone
' When someone says you're an idiot,  tell them 'Damone's not an idiot
You just don't know him
' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good
And 'm just finding out
Fine
Get lost
Damone starts to push past him, but The Rat shoves his shoulder hard
(') All right, Rat
You want to do something about it
Damone begins the classic high school fighting ritual
He throws his books down
He takes a step back
He goes into a crouch
He gestures towards himself
Then Damone says the universally recognized high school fighting words
(') Well come on
The Rat shows no fear
As other kids begin to crowd around the two boys, Rat throws his own books down
He takes a step back, goes into the crouch
He gestures toward himself
You come on
They stand there, gesturing, neither one of them wanting to make the first move
No
You come on, you wuss
Assistant Coach Mr
Sexton comes running out of the boy's locker room, and steps in front of the two boys
Hey
Knock this crap off
The Rat stalks off, disappearing into the crowd of onlookers
: - The Ridgemont Drive strip is filled with cars, cruising for parties
There is a lot of honking, and yelling out windows
Everyone is headed towards the beach
We stay on a lowly 7-11 store near the freeway entrance
7-11  - yellow Firebird slowly, menacingly cruises the empty parking lot
It does not stop
Then, around the corner, walks Jeff Spicoli
We see him in the neon 7-11 light, his hands stuffed deep into the pockets of baggy jeans
He walks inside the store
He is the only shopper
7-11 Brad Hamilton stands behind the counter in a red and white striped shirt and cap, making fresh coffee
Jeff Spicoli trudges up to the counter
He looks at Brad
Brad looks at Spicoli
There is an unspoken edge between them
Hey, mon, can  use the bathroom
Brad squints his eyes, looks at the sign on the back room door
sign which reads: Rest Room For Employees Only
Go ahead
Just make it quick
Totally
It's the first door on your left
Spicoli disappears into the back room
Brad sighs, looks at the clock
It reads: 11:15
Then he hears Spicoli from the back room
(
) can't find it, mon
It's the first door on your left
(
) On the ledge
First door on your left
(
) There it is
Brad sighs again
He loads a new filter into the coffee maker
/
7-11 moment later, the yellow Firebird pulls into the 7-11 parking lot
man in a windbreaker comes hurtling out of the car, into the store
He spray paints the scanning camera above the door
He hustles up to the counter, produces a
45 Magnum and points it chest high at Brad
There is a glazed and nervous speedy edge to his voice
want money
And  want it all -- now
Brad looks pale and young under the fluorescent 7 11 light
He speaks slowly
They empty and close the big safe here at midnight
(getting tougher) know this store
know where the safe is
He bangs the gun on the counter, hard
(') Over there behind the donut case
Now move
Brad slowly moves to the donut case, like a zombie
'm instructed to tell you that we are on a video alarm system and there are other hidden cameras in the store
Just give me the money
Move it
Okay
(legs are shaking) just started here, and they just taught me the procedure
'll give you the money, just let me figure this out
(very menacing) Move it
Move it
Brad opens the phony back of the donut case and fiddles with the strongbox combination
(') (more menacing) Let's go, stupid
Brad looks at the gunman
You motherfucker
Get off my fuckin' case
The Robber is about to react when the bathroom door opens and Jeff Spicoli starts out, wiping his hands on his pants
No towels, mon
The Robber turns to look at Spicoli, and that is all that Brad Hamilton needs
Just like it is the most natural thing in the world, Brad reaches for the hot, steaming coffee pot he has just made and throws it into the gunman's face and hands
Aaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrr
The
45 falls out of his hand and rattles to the floor
The gunman is still grabbing his face, and looking at his skinless hands in horror when Brad snaps up the gun
In the parking lot, the gunman's accomplice, poised behind the wheel of the yellow Firebird, spots the foul-up and screeches out of the parking lot
There goes your ride home
Brad pulls the under-counter alarm with newfound confidence
Jeff Spicoli stands there, mesmerized at the entire event
Awesome
Totally awesome
- Kids are pouring into the Ridgemont mall
Summer banners are already up
- In the midst of all the kids and shoppers, we see The Rat walking slowly down the promenade
He is wearing an Army surplus jacket, and his hands are buried deep in his pockets
Two girls pass his way
One smiles briefly at him, and The Rat turns to watch her pass
He is about to say something to her, then no
He walks on, sees Swenson's Ice-Cream Parlor up ahead
The Rat decides to walk the other way
' - The place is busy again, filled with shoppers and teenagers in summer-type clothing
We see Stacy Hamilton, once again, at the cash register wearing an Assistant manager name tag and a hostess gown
She handles a customer's bill, then stands there a moment, looking glum
Linda Barrett approaches
Another summer of working at Swenson's
Come on
There's lots of men around here
Keep your eyes open
You know, Linda
've finally figured it out
It's not sex want
Anyone can have sex
What do you want
want romance
Romance in Ridgemont
We don't even get cable
the back kitchen door, which swings open, and out comes Mike Damone in a peppermint Swenson's shirt
He wipes some grime on his pants
Mike
You have a mess on -9
All right
All right
just cleaned -8
Give me a break
Get going
The two girls smile, go back to their posts
'  - Jeff Spicoli sits in his room, and it is his castle
Clothes lie in disarray on the floor huge half-waxed surfboard is propped against the window
We see Spicoli dressed in a too large white short-sleeved shirt, attempting to tie his father's fat paisley tie
He stops to take a hit from his bong, all the while talking on the phone
The music of Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Freebird" plays on the radio
am
so
wasted, mon
What is in this shit
(pause) Doesn't that stuff cause brain damage
(pause) Bitchin'
Spicoli listens for a moment
He rubs his eyes, shakes his head
He is really buzzed
(') Hey, mon,  am going to Mexico as soon as school is out
Two more weeks, bud
Week from Wednesday
(pause) am gonna take both boards, my duck feet, many cases of beer, and just jam
(pause) No, mon, from school
'm leaving as soon as school gets out
'll be at Sunset Cliffs by nighttime
(pause) Totally
(pause) Later
Spicoli hangs up, and concentrates on tying his tie
He almost strangles himself
Then suddenly the door to his room flies open and Spicoli's little brother Curtis bursts in
Jeff you have company
Go away, Curtis
If you can't knock,  can't hear you
Curtis slams the door and leaves
moment later there is a knock
(') That's better
Come in
The door swings open and Jeff Spicoli sits in stoned shock at the sight before him
There, standing in the doorway of his room is Mr
Hand
(') Mr
Mr
Hand
That's right, Jeff
Mind if  come in
Spicoli can only nod
(') (calling downstairs) Thank you, Mr
and Mrs
Spicoli
Hand walks into Spicoli's room, takes off his suit jacket and lays it on the chair back
He stops a moment and catches the stare of Miss January Penthouse on the wall, then turns to Spicoli
(') Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff
Yeah
The Graduation Dance Mr
Hand
It's the last school event of the year
'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff
Did  do something wrong, Mr
Hand
Hand removes several copies of Oui Magazine from another chair and sits down
He sets his briefcase on Spicoli's dresser, next to a bag of pot, and opens it up for easy access
Do you want to sit there, Jeff
don't know
guess so
Fine
You sit right here on your bed
'll use the chair here
(pause) As  explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year --  don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases
'd rather be preparing the lesson
Mr
Hand takes a sheet from his briefcase and looks at it
(') According to my calculations, Mr
Spicoli, you wasted a total of eight hours of my time this year
And rest assured that is a kind estimate
He returns the sheet to his case and looks into Spicoli's weed-ravaged eyes
(') Now, Mr
Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me
Now  have the unique pleasure of squaring our account
Tonight, you and  are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular
Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr
Hand
Well, then, 'm glad  remembered to bring an extra copy just for you
Hand reaches in his case and produces the book
He hands it to Spicoli
: '  - Wearily, Spicoli is trying to grasp the material
so, like, when Jefferson went before the people what he was saying was 'Hey, we left this place in England because it was bogus, and if we don't come up with some cool rules ourself, we'll be bogus, too
' Right
who nods his head
Very close, Jeff
Hand reaches over and gets his case
(') think 've made my point with you tonight
Hey, Mr
Hand, can  ask you a question
What's that
Do you have a guy like me every year
guy to
don't know, make a show of
Teach other kids lessons and stuff
Well, you'll find out next year
(smiling) No way, mon
When  graduate
history  ain't even coming over to your side of the building
If you graduate
(panicked) You're gonna flunk me
Mr
Hand pauses a moment, then breaks into the nearest approximation of a grin we have seen all year
It isn't much, but it's noticeable
His lips crinkle at the ends
Don't worry, Spicoli
You'll probably squeak by
All right
Oh, yeah
Mr
Hand has now gathered all his material, and he stands to approach Spicoli's door
Jeff jumps up, extends his hand
(') Aloha, Mr
Hand
Aloha, Spicoli
Mr
Hand exits the room, and descends the staircase of the Spicoli household
Spicoli kicks the door shut, grins, and continues struggling with his tie
- Tight angle on the emotion-filled face of the lead singer in a cheesy high school band called the Birds
He is bathed in a blue light, singing the last verse of The Eagles' 'Take It To The Limit'
We pull back to reveal a large, clumsy banner reading:
Students are pouring into the gym for this event
Many have brought their annual yearbooks
On stage, the lead singer snaps his fingers and the band goes into Nick Lowe's 'Heart of the City'
Some students start to dance
Every one of our characters is either here, or about to arrive
From Charles Jefferson to Spicoli to Mr
Hand
For once, all classes are partying together
But, just as in the beginning of the year on lunch court, the kids are still cordoned off into their distinctive cliques
at the Last Dance
They see Mr
Hand signing annuals by the door
They all say the same thing as they pass, "Aloha, Mr
Hand"
He nods in return
surveying the growing mob of annual-crazed students
From behind her comes Linda Barrett in a low-cut black dress
Where's Doug
He's not coming
Not coming
What happened
He says he's got to stay in Chicago
(sighs) He says  should visit him sometimes
Sometime
Yeah, like maybe never
But what are you going to do
Well  might go to Dartmouth
Dartmouth
didn't tell anyone  applied cause  never thought 'd make it
can't believe it
But what about Doug
() There's a world of guys out there
just wish  didn't have to date any of them
Hey -- Doug Stallworth
It's his loss
in another part of the dance, by the Junior class sponsored food counter
Damone is standing, talking to several girls, gesturing and being Damone, Mr
Attitude
Sign my annual, honey
The girls look at each other, laugh
They walk away
standing nearby
You're losing it, Damone
You're crazy
Those girls love me
sprawled out in the bleachers with his surfer stoner buddies
He turns to one admiring stoner (Todd)
Hey, mon
Sign my annual
Spicoli slips the annual into the kid's crotch
The stoner winces in pain, but still opens the book and lingers on all the signings in Spicoli's annual
They are all drug-related messages from fellow stoners
After a moment, Spicoli's friend signs: "Thanks for the reds
Todd
" Hey, mon, good thing we're going to Mexico this summer
'Cause you're gonna get kicked out of your house when your parents read your annual
- Brad Hamilton pushes both doors open, and makes his entrance into the Last Dance
There is a lot of activity going on, but all nearby eyes turn to Brad as he walks into the dance
Fifteen kids immediately gravitate towards him
They all want Brad to sign their annuals, to talk about the 7-11 incident
Onstage, the -Birds play the Beatles' "It Won't Be Long"
We see Brad's old girlfriend Lisa push up to him
Her new jock boyfriend holds a protective arm around her
saw your picture in the paper
You had the greatest look on your face
Front of the Metro Section
'm telling my parents, ' know this guy,  know this guy
' Lisa's boyfriend pulls his arm tighter around her
Will you sign my annual, Brad
Brad smiles, nods
He signs, and gives her his
We then see Brad's three Buddies from Carl's Jr
come up, pat him on the back and grab his shoulder
Brad studies them warily
#1 Fuckin' manager of 7-11
#2 Get us jobs over there, Brad
You can do it
Since when do you guys want to work at 7-11
#2 Come on, Brad
It would be great
All of us together
Well, 7-11 is a tremendous operation
It's really changed, man
They've got great food, great magazines, videogames
it's class
Total class
#3 As soon as you can get us in there, we're gone from Carl's, Brad
#2 Yeah, man, all the little punks from junior high have taken over the place
Brad leaves his old buddies
He grins and notices someone across the crowded dance floor
Hey, Thompson
Wendell
Get a job
They laugh, flip him off
Brad is back in his element at last
He moves into the main dancing area, works his way across the room, past the bleachers, when he hears a voice
(
) Hamilton
Brad turns around, seen Spicoli sitting on the bottom rung of the bleachers
Spicoli looks back with true respect
(') Awesome
He throws Brad his annual
Brad gives him his
They sign
(') Easy, mon
Later
where several couples are passionately making out
Four teachers clomp up into the stands from different angles
They pin the couples in flashlight beams, like the main tower pinning an escaping prisoner
- onstage, singing the Rolling Stones' "'m Free"
- We see Jeff Spicoli leave the dance and come backing down the stairs with a stoner bud
His fist is in the air
Summer, mon
We're there
He turns to his stoner bud
(') Let's roll, my man
Spicoli backs right into a young buzz-cut kid
(') Hey, bud
Watch yourselff Spicoli turns around to see he's backed into a squad of eight Lincoln Surf Nazis
They are all standing on the steps, waiting
Are you Jeff Spicoli
Spicoli looks up and down the row of Surf Nazis
On the end, he sees
That's him
He did it
Hey, mon,  don't know what your trip is, but
Spicoli dashes off down Luna Street
and the Surf Nazis take out in hot pursuit, chasing him through the parking lot, past Ridgemont High, and into the night
They will never catch him
: School is out and it's summer business as usual at the Ridgemont Mall
We see the same stores, the same packs of kids roaming the three tiers
who stands against the railing in his Cinema Four jacket, gazing across the mall at Swenson's Ice Cream Parlor
He sees Stacy walk two girlfriends to the outdoor front tables, and almost look his way
The Rat turns away suddenly
Then he hears her calling out after him
Hey Mark
Turn around
Ratner turns around, affects total and complete cool
He waves across the mall to her
(') Come over here
He looks back at his post at the theatre, decides it's okay to step away
He walks across the mall
' Stacy is standing by the sundae bar
Next to her are two empty stools
After a moment, we see The Rat plop onto one of the metal stools
He pounds the seat next to him with the palm of his hand
You
Sit
Stacy turns to look at him, smiles
She sits
Hi, Mark
Hi, Stacy
How are you
'm fine
Mark, 'm so glad you came over here because  want you to know something
just thought would tell you that  really enjoyed getting to know you this year
The Rat maintains The Attitude
Yeah
About fifty people  didn't know wrote that in my annual
know everybody says it, but really mean it
The Rat looks at her from the corner of his eyes
Really
Yeah
want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what look like
And so you'll remember to call me over the summer
She withdraws a picture from her pocket, hands it to The Rat
Well,  don't know,  may be doing some traveling this summer
don't know how much 'll be around
(breaks down, takes picture) But 'll give you a call sometime
'd like that
She gives him a kiss on the mouth, gets up and walks away
The Rat sits there, smiling at the way things sometimes turn out
He slips the picture into his pocket, a satisfied young man
/
' The Rat is joined by Mike Damone, who has changed into his street clothes
She wants it, Rat
The Rat snickers, shakes his head
(') saw you
You had pure Attitude
The Rat turns to look at his friend
The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl
Whatever you say, Rat
They take off together, blending into the crowd of kids walking the mall
And
you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive
Sensitive -- what is that
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking
So what makes you so sensitive
Well, for one,  read
don't watch as much television as you
'm trying to feel things more
'm learning a lot about people
What do you read
What's the last book you read
Lust For Life
It's the story of Vincent Van Gough
(scoffs) Yeah, well,  saw the movie
That must mean 'm sensitive too
It's a way, Damone
It's a vibe put it out, and  have personally found that girls do respond
Damone laughs, shoves him hard
We lose sight of the two boys in the sea of kids
of Ridgemont Center Mall with music
