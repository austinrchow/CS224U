' Written by Maria Veltre & Jack Sekowski : - We fly high above heavenly clouds
Beneath a brilliant blue sky
'  greets us
(
) On any given day, your life can change in the blink of an eye
It's a cliche,  know
Descending through the clouds, we are caught for a moment in a dreamy gauze
We emerge to find ourselves gliding above a small town
Descending lower
And lower
To Xenia, Ohio
(
) But a lot of cliches get to be cliches because they're true
Your life  change in the blink of an eye
What  mean is, one day you're a regular chump, a wannabe something
You're not even totally sure  you wannabe
We pass over the town square
fine spring day in middle America
Red brick buildings with names like "Miller & Son Drugs," "Two Sisters Gifts," "Nelson Family Market
"   You can almost smell the rosy cheeks and moral fiber
(
) (') The next day the doorbell rings and some stranger's holding your ticket to being
Still flying over the town, we focus on a   on a Schwinn
We follow as he pedals his way to
three story building
Older, brick, sturdy
Meticulously maintained
(
) It happens every day
Dreams come true
And not just for those dim witted chain-smoking hillbillies you see on
You know, the ones who win the Super Lotto and spend their fortune on a truck full of Goobers and a new set of front teeth
It could happen to any guy, any time
even
- raises the American flag
It flaps proudly as the teenager chains his bike to a bike rack
He glances up at the flag, which is reflected in his uber-hip sunglasses
When he smiles, in  , his teeth seem to sparkle
(
) Uh, that's not me
'm over here
We   to another teenager, locking his bike
Meet our much less glamorous hero:   , 17
decent looking kid
Not hip enough to be cool
Not square enough to be tormented
He joins the other  heading into the school
(
) (') You're disappointed,  know admit,  was hopeless back then
The 'do, the shades, ugh
But always had good taste in women
-  - , 17, fills her cheerleader uniform in all the right places
We watch her at her locker
Also in
Which makes even her most mundane task seem graceful
Wow, just look at her stack those books
(
) That's Christy Malone
Head cheerleader, love of my life, lust of my loins
Christy glances off screen and  excitedly
Another cheerleader enters the frame, holding a newspaper called "
"  Christy reads the headline
"Health Teacher Flunks Her Own Lesson
"  No
It's Miss Pratt, smoking a doobie
Christy calls to Ted
(') Look at this, Ted
Imagine if we did  in the school paper
She shows him "Exposed
" Ted gawks
Happy just to be this close to Christy
But they are quickly interrupted by
(
) Hand them over
Immediately
, mid-50's, marches down the hallway, seizing copies of "
" from students' hands
We can see that it is a "homemade" looking newspaper
And there's obviously much ado about it
Christy winks at Ted as she hides the newspaper in her locker
Christy,
(
) Look at that smile
That wink
That's no platonic wink
That's a wink that says, " don't just want you, Ted
you
" So of course had to ask her to the prom mean, she was practically begging for it
-  - Ted ambles toward Christy
Struggling for nonchalance
She limbers up by stretching her leg high against the wall
She whispers to another
They giggle
Then Christy turns to Ted
Flashing that perfect smile of hers
Just the guy 've been looking for
Ted wipes his sweaty palms on his jeans
've been looking for you, too
Christy continues stretching
Driving Ted crazy with her contortionist moves
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing
(sotto) From your lips, to God's ears
You go first
Ladies first
insist
Well
The prom's coming up
Yeah
And  was wondering
Yeah
If you don't have
mean
She looks up at him with gorgeous blue eyes
Then blurts
(') Teddy
Would you please please please take me to the prom
Are you serious
Of course  will
of course
Christy joyously jumps into Ted's arms
Wrapping her legs around him in a passionate embrace
The entire room You are the most wonderful guy in the whole wide world, and  love you madly, Teddy Nelson
And just as she's about to plant one right on his lips
: '  -  - The shrill ringing of a    snaps Ted out of his reverie
large glass window separates Ted's - office from the rest of the school newsroom
We realize now that Ted has only been gazing through the window at Christy, watching her stretch those gorgeous limbs of hers
(
) Sorry about that
cheap trick, know
But it's my story and my fantasy
So cut me some slack
He follows the other students to
-    - Ted joins his schoolmates, lining up on both sides of the hallway
Far from any windows
They all know the drill
Christy's just across the hall from Ted
He can't take his eyes off of her
, 17, approaches Ted
He's got a camera around his neck and so much confidence, it's a wonder he can balance his head on his shoulders
Come on, bro
Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation
You and your pep talks
Don't get me wrong
We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives
Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon
But we're strictly hamburger guys
Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for
(
) That's Charlie
My best friend
He's into beef analogies, partly because he's a butcher's son, and partly because, well, he's just into beef analogies
What can say
He's also a photographer
-    - Charlie kneels by the sidelines
Shooting cheerleaders with his Nikon and an obscenely long lens
(
) a very gifted photographer
' : cheerleader's ripe buttocks, peeking out from beneath a short pleated skirt
As she kicks and jumps, her little red panties wedge themselves firmly between her cheeks
The camera skillfully tracks her movements, waiting until
The cheerleader's hand comes down
In  , her finger slips under her panties and tugs on the fabric, pulling it over her cheeks
Charlie's motor drive whirls
' (
) The senior class voted him, "Most Likely To Have  Restraining Order Filed Against Him
" But that's another story
Ted and Charlie lean against the wall
genuinely think she wants me feel a vibe
That vibe is from your wrist, pal
You've been over-tenderizing your meat, again
Christy catches Ted's eye and smiles a perfect smile
See
Did you see that
She smiles at everyone, Ted
She's like a newborn with gas
Charlie secretly shows Ted a nudie magazine
"
" with perfect breasts graces the cover golden halo over her head
Charlie flips it open
Points to a picture
(') The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April
(feminine voice) "Hi, my name's Ginger
love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback
My biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex
" Here's a tip:  set it on , honey, and don't be stingy with the lube
(winking at Ted) Don't knock it till you tried it
Were you always this sick
One thing for sure, Christy Malone ain't lookin  good naked
Ted takes a peek at Ginger
Then at Christy
Someday, 'll find out
You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip
Ted grabs the magazine and flips through more pages
Beautiful, naked women
Palm trees
Blue skies
Bubbling Jacuzzis
Red Ferraris
The stuff that fantasies are made of
Ted looks determined
defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents
That's crazy talk
defy any and all limits
Charlie can see the look in Ted's eyes
He's about to do something bold and daring
Something he'll regret
Don't do it, Ted
Don't do it
(walking away; defiantly) Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself
Ted starts to walk across the corridor, ignoring Charlie
'm warning you
This is an official warning
Danger, Will Robinson, danger
quietly attractive teenaged girl,  , watches Ted
She seems concerned, too
(
) There's one more person you should meet
Someone integral to my story
(
) That's Julie Conroy
Unlike the rest of these losers, she didn't grow up in Xenia, Ohio
just met her that day
But already, she had made a difference in my life
'  -    - Teachers mill around
Chatting
Snacking on donuts, coffee
bursts in, spilling a stack of "
" onto a table
Everyone freezes
Oh, Miss Pratt, Miss Pratt
What were you thinking
How could you be so careless
(reading) "Exposing Hypocrisy in the Morons who Teach Us
" That's the little bastard's motto
The teachers turn to
We recognize her from the cover of "
" (summoning courage) Principal Merkin,  realize we have to teach the children that recreational drugs are the devil's work, but that doesn't mean we don't dance with the Prince of Darkness ourselves, every now and again
Ah, well, bravo
That's just what we'll tell the school board
Suddenly, an   pops open and  on top of a coffee machine
,   , turns to look at
, her head framed by the air duct
She holds a digital camera in her hand
Her expression says: "Oh, shit
" Principal Merkin narrows his eyes at the "little bastard" who has been making his life hell
'  -  - Julie sits in a chair in front of Ted's desk
She and Ted size up one another
(
) Merk's punishment was cruel
Expulsion without appeal
Or working for me on the school paper
The school paper would be torture for a gonzo reporter like Julie and we both knew it
But what choice did she have
Julie leans back on the chair, rests her feet on Ted's files, and blows a huge bubble
So, William Randolph
Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale
That's just one example
My reporting has made a difference
Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof
The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable
My award winning expose changed all that
The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up
Julie deadpans
Is it true
Is ignorance bliss
Look,  loved "Exposed
" and  hate it that you got busted
know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not
Ted's eyes wander to Christy, who prances around the newsroom
Julie notices
Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there
Christy's a very talented journalist
see a Pulitzer in her future
didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job
Me-ow
Go ahead
Ask her to the prom
Get it over with
have absolutely no intention-- --Do it
triple-dog-dare you
Ted nears Christy
Students stare as he passes
They elbow one another
Whispering
(
) So you see, this is really about a triple-dog-dare
don't even know what it means
just know, unless it's a felony, a triple-dog-dare pretty much has to be met with immediate action
Ted seems unaware that all eyes are upon him
The cacophony of the corridor settles
He gets down on one knee in front of Christy
Christy looks down on Ted
Smiles that smile
Which freezes as her eyes dart
Realizing that everyone is staring at them with great anticipation
(') Uh, Christy,  was wondering
The corridor explodes with
Ted flushes with embarrassment
Christy looks mortified
(through gritted teeth) Ted, have you lost your mind
You like me
like you
guess it's pretty obvious to everyone
don't  you
We're But that smile
Oh, Ted,
smile at everyone since  got my braces off
So you'll think about it
Christy laughs derisively
You really don't get it, do you am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring
It's, like, a caveman thing
So that's a maybe
The answer is , Ted,
Except maybe in your dreams
Christy flees
Leaving Ted kneeling there
Alone
Unless you count the hoards of  who are watching and In my dreams
Of course
(repeating; chanting) This is a dream
This is only a dream
Julie approaches
Gives him a hand
Helps him up
No, Ted
This is an actual emergency
- '  - Ted pukes in the sink
tried to warn you, William Randolph
She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds
But you triple-dog-dared me
It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way
One word, my friend
One word
Ted lifts his head
Looks in the mirror
Distraught
There's gotta be more to life than meatloaf
- Not a hair above middle class
Home sweet home nonetheless
Dinner in progress
, , Ted, younger brother, mutt named  curled under the table
storm brews
Lightning in the distance
Thunder
Ted's Mom observes her son with unmistakable Mom-radar
She slides a slab of - rotten timing
-   onto his plate with an unpleasant thud
Ted shudders
If  never eat another bite of meat loaf again, it'll be too soon
Ted's Mom frowns
Jimmy explains matter-of-factly
Mom, Dad
Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in
He's what you'd call clinically bummed
Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil
mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store
Ted's parents look at one another, shake their heads
His Dad gently explains
We heard about Christy, son
Jimmy tries to stifle a grin
What is this
Does everybody know everything 'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day
No cursing in this house, young man
Use the strong vocabulary God gave you
don't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town
We understand your disappointment, Teddy
Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous
(catches himself) We
uh
we understand your disappointment
It's my private business
Mine
Can the tantrum, sweet pea
We're the good guys, remember
Mom, Dad
Don't allow this disturbing behavior to furrow your collective brow
Ted's just experiencing some post-adolescent turmoil, coming to terms with the whole "small town dynamic
" hate Xenia
hate my life
Ted charges for the front door
(
) (') And until that moment, this was the worst day of my seventeen and a half years
And then it happened
Three, two, one
- Ted bursts outside and plows straight into  , a short, rotund man in his mid-50s
Whoa
Sorry, mister
Zukerman's briefcase and papers are knocked to the ground
Ted helps to retrieve them
In a hurry, are we
was in the middle of a melodramatic exit
It wouldn't really make a statement if tiptoed out the door
What are you selling
Bad news
People pay good money for that
'm just a messenger
Ted starts to back away
Instinctively knowing the bad news must be for him
Oh no
No way
've had all the bad news  can take for one day
It's about your parents
Ted stops
Puzzled
My parents
What do you mean
'm terrible at this
blurt
'm a blurter
Your parents
They well
they exist no further
(off Ted's confusion) Skinny-dipping
The Amazon
Piranhas
It wasn't pretty
You've got the wrong guy
The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot
Well kid, 'm speaking of
your biological parents
- Ted sits on the couch, bewildered
Dad beside him
Mom pours coffee in her best china
Zukerman regards a wall of family photos as he takes a sip
The will reading is next Tuesday
Naturally all of Ted's expenses will be taken care of
Ted's parents look worried
Mom reminds Dad
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning
(explaining to Zukerman) We own a small family grocery store
How quaint
(quietly; moping) It's spring break
don't want to go to a will reading
That's part of growing up, honey
What
Having spring break ruined by will readings
You know what your mother means
All right,  can give you two tickets, prepaid, but you must be there
There's no other way
Mom, Dad
Allow me to accompany Ted
can assure you, 'll be the level-headed sidekick to your angst ridden teen
think Ted should take someone older, more responsible
What about Charlie
You boys could make it a little adventure
Charlie, at a will reading
What did  do to deserve this
Lightning strikes again
Thunder rumbles a second later
The lights flicker
And it's
'  - Candles light the dark room
Rain pours hard outside
Journalism mementos all over Ted's walls
News clippings
Magazine covers
There's even a faux Pulitzer, a Christmas gift from his parents
Ted's Dad sits on the edge of his bed
remember spring break of my senior year
Seems like a lifetime ago
Dad, please
Grandpa was so strong back then
Working from the crack of dawn
So proud of his peaches
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out  knew more than you
You're way ahead of me again
(proving it
) It was the year of the rhizopus rot
Grandpa almost lost the farm
You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival
And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow
The lesson being
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do
It's all part of growing up
And it usually works out peachy in the end
'm getting so good at this
Dad chuckles, but Ted's still moping
You guys are my parents
Of course we are
They didn't want me when  was born
Why should  care
if they're dead
Son
Well, why should
They had a rough life
Your father was a bouncer
Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper
There was no place for a baby
guess
They did do one great thing
They gave us our boy
Yeah
Be a sport
How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be
guess we could go to Disneyland or something
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks
Whatever helps you cope
guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face
There ya go
Always remember, focus on the peach
not the pit
Ted's Dad hugs him briefly, laughing
Always one step ahead of your dear old dad
- 747 lands screaming on the runway
- Ted and Charlie exit the plane
They walk tentatively through the sleeve towards the entry gate
wonder if this is what it feels like to be born
Ted gives him a look
(') Think about it
Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism
Poor Freud, turning in his grave
Seriously, it's like we're being reborn
We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said
Nobody knows about your massive humiliation
Nobody knows about your mental retardation
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation
And nobody knows you're a virgin
(after a beat) Aw, who are we kidding
Charlie's words echo loudly through the sleeve
(') '
People stare at Ted as they pass
think 'll reinvent a new best friend
-  - Ted and Charlie enter the terminal
Friends and family wait for loved ones
few chauffeurs hold signs with names
One stands out
Tall
Blonde
Gorgeous
In a short skirt matching low cut jacket
And a cap
She's stunning
And she's holding a sign that reads:
What are the odds of there being Ted Nelson on our flight
Astronomical
They grin at one another
Then approach the Chauffeur
(') Hi, 'm Ted Nelson
With a sad look, the Chauffeur hugs him, kissing one cheek, then the other
'm so terribly sorry for your loss
Your father was a great man
Ted's stunned
Charlie leans in and whispers
Who the hell was your father
Well, Dad said
- Ted and Charlie sit on opposites ends of the plush interior
Charlie eyes the control console with its slew of gadgets
They practically have to shout to hear one another
bouncer
Are you serious
Maybe he got promoted
Charlie continues playing with the console switches
(') Don't
Touch
Anything
Too late
Rock music pulsates through the limo
(shouting) This is the life, baby
We get ourselves some tail and we're talking
Cut it out, before you break something
For a guy about to try his first Dom Perignon, you are extremely uptight
He flips another switch
The bar opens
Revealing a bottle of Dom Perignon on ice
Charlie grins broadly
We can't afford that
Charlie grabs the bottle and starts to open it
Don't you know anything about limo etiquette
Everything in here is included for our pleasure
Wait a second,  thought we were hamburger guys
And like every hamburger guy knows, when you get your one big chance at the good life, you abuse every second of it until they figure out you don't belong there and kick your sorry ass out
The cork flies through the air
Bounces off the ceiling
And hits another switch
The sun roof glides open
Champagne overflows from the bottle
All over Charlie's crotch
Nice
Is that in the limo etiquette handbook, too
Charlie grabs a bar towel as Ted looks toward the sun roof
Beautifully blue Southern California sky greets him
With an occasional palm tree swooshing by
Ted rises
-  - Ted's head peeks out of the sun roof
Tentatively
Unsure
He takes in the sights as the limo cruises Sunset Boulevard
People stare at him
beautiful  smiles and waves
He waves back, very timidly
Charlie sticks his head out, too
Sun on their faces
Wind in their hair
This is how the other half lives, bro
Enjoy it while you can
- The limo passes through the ornate gate of what could only be a sprawling mansion
It comes to a sudden halt
The door swings open to reveal a group of
Clad in very short black dresses and even some black bikinis
Sad expressions on their faces
- The  embrace Ted
#1 Welcome, Mr
Nelson
You are so very very welcome here
#2 We feel your pain, so deeply
(to Ted) Something tells me we're not in Xenia anymore, Toto
""  - The beautiful young women guide Ted towards the mansion
Charlie follows
particularly   eyes him curiously
'm Charles
The handsome, devoted best friend
We're so close, we feel each other's pain
The voluptuous beauty notices Charlie's soaked crotch
He winks
(') See what you do to me, baby
Just then, the spry  McDOLE, 60s, emerges from the mansion
She approaches Ted and hugs him
Oh my, he would have been so proud
You're the spitting image of him
He never spits, ma'am
Ever
He can't even get a good hocker going
've tried to teach him
It comes from the diaphragm
(sharply; to Charlie) You're on the next plane home
(emotional embrace) 'm Helen McDole
Your father's executive secretary
""  -   - Ted takes a seat at the spacious conference table
Helen sits on his right
Charlie sits on his left
Zukerman and two other   wait at the head of the table
Finally Zukerman checks his watch and rises
We're running out of time
The kid's here
We don't need
Perhaps we could be patient for just a moment or two longer
They all watch a
Seconds pass, slowly, slowly
Then suddenly Zukerman rises
What did the doctor say to the nurse as they watched something black and white and red in a blender
(a wry smile) No more patients
Very dramatically, Zukerman slides a copy of "Heaven" magazine down the conference table
Right to Ted
(') Are you familiar with "Heaven
" 'm seventeen
know it like the back of my hand
Your fathered owned the entire "Heaven" empire
You own it now
Any questions
Ted's stunned, speechless
Charlie gawks
Everything
The publishing division, the real estate holdings, the retail outlets, the theme parks
As far as the eye can see
Zukerman presses a remote control
wall panel slides open to reveal a large monitor which springs to life
On the screen is a striking couple
Ted'
and
Heather, stunningly sexy and overflowing from her gold sequined halter top
Tom, very handsome in a Vegas showman sort of way
Oh, sweetheart
We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you
But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust
But don't worry
we'll be in heaven
The  heaven,  mean
Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being
Or not being
Who knows
Maybe we know now
If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead
Am right
Ted looks guilty
This is too weird
But we did want you
It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want
We knew you needed a real mom and dad
We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this
Heather holds up the first issue of "Heaven
" She's on the cover, wearing nothing but a halo
She looks almost exactly the same today, with a few extra nips and tucks
Can you believe that was me
Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation
The rest is history
So here we are
Dead
But we never want you to want for anything
That is, we want you to have everything
Everything
Heather leans forward and blows a kiss into the camera
Her strongest assets spilling forward
We love you, Ted
We always did
We always will
Charlie's practically slobbering
He elbows Ted
can't believe that's your mother
We're talking babe-a-licious chub fest, right here in the 501's
Perv
At that moment, the doors burst open
( ) sails into the room
Handsome in an unconventional way, he exudes passion and eccentricity
'm so terribly sorry
Am  too late
Ah, Mr
Deeds
You're just in time to congratulate your nephew
He inherited the empire
(a broad smile) Every morsel of it
It would appear so
Uncle Billy hugs Ted with great enthusiasm
Smashing
Welcome to the family, Ted
You are going to breathe some new life into this place
You are going to set the world on fire
You are going to
call me Uncle Billy
Please
(awkwardly) Uh, sure
Uncle Billy
have only one concern
Ted waits
Swept up by Uncle Billy's spirit
(') You do like girls, don't you
Of course  like girls
lot
mean, a whole lot
As much as possible
You're sure
(to the rescue) He likes them with the unbridled enthusiasm of a seventeen-year-old virgin who's been making mental beef jerky since he saw the bevy of tender young skirt steaks at his new hacienda
Uncle Billy grins broadly
That's my boy
""  -   - Uncle Billy leads Ted and Charlie through the cavernous room
Sexy, semi-clad oil paintings of Ted's biological mother adorn the walls
The parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy
Which is seldom
Seldom
No kidding
You said parties but you meant , right
(to Ted; quietly) Stick with me
know their codes
Uncle Billy winks at Ted
The orgies, exactly
Take a deep breath
You can smell it
Pure sexuality, oozing from the walls
Charlie takes a deep breath
Uncle Billy and Ted share a conspiratorial smirk
""  -   - The epitome of every boy's dream arcade
Everything from classic pinball machines to the most high tech virtual reality game that has yet to hit the market
Charlie shakes his head in amazement
Naked girls, wild sex, video games
No wonder it's called "Heaven
" This is a fun place
but we don't usually come here until after the orgies
(playing along) Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon
Indeed it is
During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel
As it were
Charlie continues to gawk
Ted's equally impressed but holding it together
""  -   - Uncle Billy leads Ted and Charlie by the indoor pool which is decorated like a tropical pond, complete with exotic vegetation, lava rocks, and a waterfall
They pass through a cave-like entrance and find themselves
""  -   - coming out by another spectacular waterfall
Which separates the indoor and outdoor pools
Numerous swim, chat, play water polo
Some topless, some might as well be
The boys watch in awe as one woman rubs lotion on another woman's back
Hello, girls
Have you met Ted
The women wave, ad-libbing warm greetings
Charlie leans towards Ted, confiding
This is like my every wet dream come true
don't even care that you're here, too, bro
Be cool
Fake it if you have to
Good advice, Ted
You have your father's instincts
"His father
" The words sound so strange
He never even met the guy
(') Just remember, you're not the man you were a day ago
And these girls, let's just say they'd be eager to please you
Ted gulps
It's hard to believe this is real
wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit
There are no wild sex orgies
Oh
Well
Maybe not yet
Not ever
Never
Never say never
Oh, god
Look
Look
Ted looks
beautiful woman sensuously rubs tanning lotion over her  breasts
The boys stare, riveted
(') really love your peaches, wanna shake your tree
Uncle Billy grins
Maybe she needs help, Ted
You should be a gentleman
(voice cracking) uh
think she's doing fine on her own
(having a moment) Oh baby, yes, yes, yes
Fuck me like you mean it
Ted elbows Charlie out of his fantasy
You kiss your mother with that mouth
'd kiss your mother with this mouth
mean, if she wasn't, you know
He means dead
So far away
In Xenia
Yeah, whatever
-   - Mom waits nervously for the phone to ring
Teddy
Is that you
Dad hurries out of the bathroom, hiking up his pajamas
Mom speaks loudly, as if Ted's in Siberia
(') How are you, baby
Are you all right
: '  - ""  - palatial suite
Very Louis
Ted throws a sheet over a nude sculpture of his biological mother
While holding a cordless phone in the crook of his neck
'm all right, Mom
'm not in Siberia, you know
Did you have a nice flight
Are they taking good care of you
Yeah, 'm doing fine
have so much to tell you
don't even know where to begin
Save it, honey
We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr
Zukerman's phone bill
It's okay, Mom
Trust me
Mom hands Dad the phone
Ted, it's your dad
have a question for you
don't know how to put it tactfully
You know 'm lousy with words
Just say it, Dad
know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all
Dad, let's just say  can buy anything  want in the whole bookstore
Including the bookstore
(not getting it) Well, good
Every little bit helps
Suddenly, Charlie bursts into the room with a pair of binoculars
Check this out
Hurry
better go, Dad
We'll see you soon
Have fun in
(trying to be hip) the land of fruits and nuts
'  - ""  - Charlie flips off the light switch and whispers
Hurry
(to Charlie) What is it now
Check it out
Charlie shoves the binoculars at Ted and guides him toward the window which overlooks the outdoor pool
Don't tell me
Another vision of incomparable beauty
Beauty
No
We're talking
' devastatingly  , , "Miss April,"  emerges from the pool, wearing nothing but a g-string
Her skin shimmers from the reflection of the pool lights
Rivulets of water stream down her body
She reaches for a towel and pats her body dry
An incredible aura seems to surround her
Separating her from the other spectacular beauties we've seen already
Ted lowers the binoculars
Entranced
get it now
You and me
We're dead
Dead
Our plane crashed
In the Grand Canyon
big fiery explosion
We never made it to
They needed dental records to identify us
And this place
This
Actually
Is
Heaven
Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate
And some really fast cars
""  -   - Ted and Charlie move like thieves in the night
Don't be such a pansy
All of this is
It's a lot to digest
Imagine how you'd feel
'd feel like staying up all night
Forever
Or at least till  got the of the land,
""  -   - Ted and Charlie enter
Flip the light switch
It was his parents' very opulent bedroom
Complete with more risque paintings of Ted's biological mother
feel like 'm entering a forbidden tomb
where they get all the really good porno channels on cable
Charlie pulls open a dresser drawer filled with Ted's mother's lingerie
(') Cha-ching
Jackpot
Charlie caresses a pair of red silk panties and inhales their powdery fragrance
Oh, how inappropriate is that
Take a whiff of heaven
How would you like it if  did that to your mother's panties
'd call you a sick, twisted fuck
But this is different
She wasn't your mother mother-- Give me those
Ted grabs the panties just as Charlie pulls away, ripping them in half
Just then the door opens to reveal a very proper
do apologize, sir
heard a noise
Ted and Charlie awkwardly hide the panty halves behind their backs
We were just-- -- completely understand, sir
'll leave you to your business
Good night
The Butler leaves
Ted glares at Charlie
Who shrugs
couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen
(sarcastic) Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails,   , at the orgies
""  -  - The garage is crowded with two dozen sporty classics
Ted runs his hands over the hood of a red Ferrari 575M Maranello
He pulls the door open and slides into the leather seat
(
) Wanna take me for a ride
Ted turns around and spots Ginger, the goddess from the pool, making her way towards him
He gulps
- don't have the keys
They're in the ignition, silly
Ted glances down
There they are
She hops in next to him
He doesn't know what to do
(') You do know how to drive
don't have much experience with a
uh
stick
Want a lesson
Ted blushes
He needs a lot of lessons
(') Press your left foot on the clutch
And turn the key
The Ferrari growls to life
Ginger places her hand over Ted's
(') Now release the brake
And slide the stick into first gear
Got it
Ginger moves her slender fingers on his knees
Showing him how it's done
Now very carefully apply some pressure to the gas pedal with your right foot as you release the clutch with your left
She squeezes his thigh and winks
""  -  - The Ferrari jerks out of the garage and promptly stalls
Ginger giggles
Could Ted be  embarrassed
The first time can be awkward
You just have to get on and try again
don't even know if  should be doing this
It's a very expensive car
It's your car
These are all your cars
Some of them have to be automatics
Your father liked shifting
He said it brought him closer to the engine
"Like a woman, purring with ecstasy
" Ted feels his temperature rising
He changes the subject
'm Ted, by the way
think forgot to say that
know
'm Ginger
Miss April
The one with the horses
That's me
almost didn't recognize you without
you know
that stallion between
your
uh
legs
Ginger blushes
(') That sounded so much better in my head
Ginger
Ted tries to hide behind his less than cool shades
Ginger notices
Hey, Ted
Wanna go shopping
Shopping, really
should tell my friend
Don't worry
He found the chocolate room
(big grin) Hi ho, Silver
He puts the car in gear
The tires scream as they take off
Gears grind as he shifts
Not exactly purring with ecstasy
Yet
- The Ferrari negotiates its way along Rodeo Drive
Ted seems to have gotten the hang of it
Tourists stare
One snaps a photo
Ted pulls up to
and then over
the curb
Well, he almost has the hang of it
- Ted emerges from a dressing room
Slowly starting to lose his boy-from-Xenia taint
He glances at the price tag, dangling from his sleeve
His eyes widen
Ginger strokes his arm
Whispers seductively in his ear
Your father always said, "Money matters only to the man who doesn't have it
" Ted listens
Trying to learn
- Ted tries on some snazzy sunglasses
Ginger approves
Ted still checks the price tag
Sorry, habit
Ginger looks into his eyes
As if she can see his soul
Who exactly  you
(uncomfortable) What do you mean
'm Ted Nelson
And who  Ted Nelson
Ted's not sure how to respond
He smiles awkwardly
(') Is he a small town boy, destined to live an ordinary life with an ordinary wife and a tiny house with a boring old white picket fence
The hamburger life
Now he can defy it
(') Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted
It's in your blood
always knew there was more felt it
Then remember, you are the heir to a billion dollar empire
You have a staff of literally thousands
Multiply everything you ever imagined by a million and you still can't even wrap your head around everything that is yours Ted slides on the shades
Slowly, purposefully
He grins at the
'll take the whole case

As they pass each cubicle,  pop up to check them out
"" cover every square inch of wall space
Ted and Charlie gawk
Who can blame them
Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month
It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right
Let me get this straight
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor
These are real, live women
(winking at Ted) We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine
But hey, if you think there's a market for it
God,  love being dead
Ted focuses on one particular picture
He removes the push pin that holds it to the wall
like her
We can see the concerned look on Helen's face
Does this kid have any taste at all
(relieved) Nice choice
There's only one problem
She shows Uncle Billy
You think she upgraded
They went in through the belly button
Uncle Billy nods
He explains gently
We don't allow , Ted
Tipping
Tattoos, implants, piercings, nose jobs
Our angels must be pure, unadultered, completely natural
Ted looks at the walls again
Carefully
He has a knack for this
He hands a picture to Helen
She turns to Uncle Billy and smiles
(') (emotional) You have your father's eye
His father
He just can't get used to that
Who was this guy
- ""  - Ted looks at the impressive collection of suits
Runs his hands along the fabrics
Picks a particularly stylish jacket and tries it on
It fits poorly
Too big in the chest and shoulders
Ted looks at himself in the full-length mirror
He's not half the man his father was
Suddenly there's a  on the door
Ted quickly takes off his father's jacket and puts on his own
He lets Uncle Billy in
momentarily pour into the room
There you are, Ted-baby
Everything all right
Yeah
Everything's cool
Ted's struggling with a silk tie
Uncle Billy helps him
You ready for your big coming out party
Everybody's dying to meet you
Just a couple of finishing touches
My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression
(puzzled) They said that
Really
(realizing) Oh, your parents
The Nelson's
Right, right
How midwest
like that
Ted wipes his palms on his slacks
Confiding
Truth is, 'm a little nervous
Nervous
Why on earth should you be nervous
All those people out there
It's a lot of pressure
Huh
You laugh in the face of pressure
do
You are a multi-media magnate
The Tycoon of Tits
The Baron of Bottoms
Ted chuckles
Uncle Billy's calming him
') You are the Emperor of every little girl who dreamed of growing up to see her naughty bits spread eagle, airbrushed to glossy perfection, with staples through her ass
Uncle Billy rubs his shoulders
As if pep-talking him for a big fight
You're the Sultan of Semen
The Monarch of Masturbation
The Merchant Prince of Lust
You
Ted
Are the King of Coitus
Me
The King of Coitus
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality
Whoa
But
that's the thing
(he whispers) 've never even actually
(interrupting) Why, look who's here
Uncle Billy swings the door open to reveal
and
Tall, beautiful, leggy
They smile warmly at Ted, each offering an arm
Ted holds his head high
Like the Sovereign of Sexuality
With the twins on either side of him, Ted struts down the stairs and into a sea of people
All so eager to meet him
Ted acts as if he's been doing this all his life
(sotto) The Potentate of Poon has arrived
And instantly, he's surrounded
People shake his hands
Women kiss his cheeks
Athletes, movie stars, models
Charlie watches, beaming proudly
- Charlie thinks he's Travolta
Dressed for disco
Twirling a Super Model
Ted dances among a dozen
They steal kisses and hugs, here and there
thousand Cinderellas, all after one Prince Charming
Ted's having the time of his life
Charlie dances up to him
Shouting in his ear
Ain't life amazing
week ago, you couldn't get to second base
Now you  second base
They high-five one another
An   grabs Ted and starts dirty dancing
Rubbing herself against him
Ted's clueless
So he improvises
People cheer him on
He thrusts his pelvis
Feigns various sex acts
Hilarious, goofy, but it works
- The party's over
Ted relaxes in the Jacuzzi, sipping champagne
Thrilled, elated, blasted
Uncle Billy sits across from him
Two  tenderize their shoulders
But as the scene continues the women take an even greater interest in each other
Stealing a kiss here
touch there
Ted attention is distracted as he chats with Uncle Billy
told you you could do it
was like a different person tonight
You were the new and improved you
would have been laughed right out of Xenia
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted
You can take that to the bank
It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days
You  home
But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do
In the meantime, 'll be your point person here on the magazine
Really
You'd do that for me
've been very lazy for a long, long time
You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy
(confiding) never finished school myself
Never had to
My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption
He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter
never struggled for a second
My parents always say hard work builds character
It's not like  didn't have ideas, had plenty of ideas
But  never even shared them with your father
Never had the guts
What kind of ideas
Well
for one thing
think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty
" You think we should be more open minded
The world is a big, beautiful place
We can open new markets in Africa and Asia
Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine
In other words, our scope is too narrow
At our press conference tomorrow, think we should announce our plans to explore the world
Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down
That's perfect
The Masseuses help Uncle Billy out of the Jacuzzi
They say their goodnights and Ted closes his eyes
When he opens them, Ginger stands at the edge of the tub
Want some company
Ted can barely nod
She unzips the back of her dress and lets it fall to her feet
The silhouette of her nude body is startlingly gorgeous in the moonlight
Ted watches as she descends, step by step, into the frothy water
Ted's paralyzed with desire and fear
Ginger descends deeper
wash of foam caresses her breasts
She continues
Until she's completely submerged
Ted looks startled
The "Jaws" theme echoes through his ears
He starts to rise
Concerned
When suddenly, he feels something
Whoa
His swimming trunks land next to him
He starts to rise out of the Jacuzzi, when suddenly he's sucked under
He thrashes
His hand grabs the edge of the Jacuzzi
But his fingers give out
And he slides under
Only to rise out of the water with Ginger
Attached to his lips
Kissing him passionately
: ""  - '  - Ted and Ginger in bed
Morning rays, satin sheets, what a night
Ted awakens
He stares at Ginger in awe, remembering what happened
Smiles big
Ted slides out of bed
Catches his reflection in the mirror
Takes a good look at himself
(posing; cool) Who's your daddy
- Press Conference
Lights, cameras, reporters, bedlam
Uncle Billy, Helen, and Ted sit at a makeshift dais
My brilliant, extraordinary nephew, Ted Nelson, has brought enough fresh blood to this company to make all of Transylvania happy for the next fifty or sixty years
'll give him the mike now and you'll see what  mean
This apple didn't fall far from the tree
Ted prepares to speak
little nervous from the spotlights, but hell, he's a man now
Uncle Billy gives him a reassuring look
(') (whispering) Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications
'm Ted Nelson
guess you already know that part
(proud of himself) For two years 've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio
've won some awards, made a difference
've always had journalism in my soul
Now  know why
He glances at Uncle Billy, who urges him to tell more
(') They tell me 've got my father's taste in women and cars

from the crowd
Uncle Billy gives him a "thumb's up" sign
(') And 'm really looking forward to the challenge of bringing "Heaven" magazine into the 21st century

You don't even have your high school diploma yet, Mr
Nelson

geeky high school picture of Ted appears on screen, as a  babbles
( ) The big question now remains: Will success spoil Ted Nelson, the straight- journalism student from Xenia, Ohio, whose life was transformed overnight when he found out he was rich, powerful, and certainly the most eligible bachelor in the entire nation
(shocked) Our Teddy inherited "Heaven
" He said he was set for book money
Jimmy turns to his parents
Mom, Dad
Forget about roller blades for my birthday
'd prefer a  test
Can you prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that  am not, for example, a Guccione
The door bell
Mom and Dad look at each other
This can't be good
Dad opens the front door to reveal a delivery man, holding a flashy new bike
Delivery for Jimmy Nelson
- Jimmy squeezes past Dad and jumps on the bike as Mom appears in the doorway
My goodness, who sent this
It's from "Heaven," ma'am
Ted
Of course
(riding around) love you, Ted
We can't accept it
It's much too expensive
Right, dear
Of course, dumpling
Its very nice of Ted but
At that moment,    and his  unload a large crate from another truck
They approach Dad and Mom
#2 Delivery for Robert Nelson
For me
What is it
#2 Appears to be tools, sir
Oh, no
Ted's gone completely overboard
Dad approaches the crate as the Delivery Man opens it to reveal a large scarlet and gray case of tools
Dad opens one of the drawers
Runs his fingers over the shiny instruments
Tears in his eyes
(') Sweetheart, what is it
always wanted Craftsman tools
He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors
Oh, honey
We can't accept this extravagance
Another delivery truck arrives
Then the local news vans
Neighbors rush out of their houses
The phone
Mom dashes inside

Teddy

As he talks, he flexes his muscles in front of a full length mirror
Well
Surprised
What is all this
When are you coming home
Just a few tokens of my affection
'll be back soon, don't worry
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive
Mom
Believe me
could buy all that  the factories they came from
Mom looks up as    wheels a washing machine and dryer into the house
#3 Where do you want them, lady
Mom's eyes light up
Oh, good lord

Only the best for my mother

Cars pull into the school parking lot
Students mingle in small groups
Making their way into the building

Suddenly, a helicopter swooshes through the air, circling the school as if to get everyone's attention, then landing on a grassy knoll
The helicopter is painted heavenly blue with a pattern of white billowy clouds
The door slides open and out hops Ted
In -
Looking seriously cool from the tips of his silver toed boots to his stylish Persol shades
Until he takes a second step and stumbles slightly, catching himself from falling face first into the grass
Charlie is right behind him
Looking great, too, but vaguely Mafioso in his efforts to be hip
He turns to the beautiful blonde  and plants a big wet kiss for everyone to see
Ted and Charlie strut towards the school as Principal Merkin bursts through the front doors, shouting
You cannot land a helicopter in my school yard
Get that blasted thing out of here
Ted raises his hand
The chopper rises as if on cue
Without a word, Ted and Charlie pass the ruffled Principal Merkin and strut toward the entrance
Classmates surround Ted
Congratulating him
Everyone wanting to be Ted's new best friend
Julie walks up to Charlie
What gives, Don Corleone
(smug) We reinvented ourselves
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers
That explains the emptiness that haunts me
Jealousy is so unattractive
Ted makes eye contact with Julie
Winking like he's Don Juan
She just stares at him, blankly
Second only to unfettered arrogance and the inability to see the irony therein
Charlie's baffled by that one
Wanna see my hickey from Miss December
Julie groans
'  - Principal Merkin paces dramatically
like you, Ted
You know that liked you before you were filthy rich
Thanks, Principal Merkin
'll be blunt
know you can take it
Yes, sir
'll brace myself
Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had
You don't need to be pandering flesh
It's nonsense
It's beneath you
You think  ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks
don't want your silly billion dollar empire
That's a good start, yes
very good start
Are you kidding
This magazine is my dream
It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream
never figured you for a pimp
Have you ever even looked at "Heaven
" What kind of sick question is that
'll be watching you, young man
Your money and power mean nothing here
Nothing
guess you won't be wanting that Rolex  sent you, then
Principal Merkin opens his desk drawer sheepishly
Caresses the watch
It kills him to return it
No
No,  won't
Thank you
For reminding me

Christy Malone props one leg against the wall
Demonstrating those contortionist warm-up moves that drove Ted mad with desire
Great jacket, Teddy Bear

It's so nice to have  like you, Christy
Christy pouts
Wishing she never said the "" word
Julie snickers
Ted takes Julie's arm and guides her to a private spot in the corner
What is it, William Randolph
Your balls need scratching
Your article sucked
In what sense
In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs
Ah ha
It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there
Come on, Julie
Don't screw up
You have some real talent
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago
'm trying to help
'm still better than you
Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account
That's not  true
Julie snaps her fingers, as if trying to remember
Oh, right
You're probably not a virgin anymore
But as far as being a hack, that much is status quo
Ted fumes
She really knows how to push his buttons
What do you want from me
'm trying to be fair
But  can't keep you on staff if you turn every meeting into an Agent Orange cover up

Jimmy's eyes widen as he chews
Mom, Dad
My trembling taste buds have just been assailed by the bittersweet knowledge of all they've been missing these past nine years
The chef turns to Julie
No offense, Wolfgang Puck, but dead flesh is dead flesh
This just happens to be better than most dead flesh on the planet
And finally, the Chef waits for Ted
Absolutely
heavenly
The Chef wipes a bead of sweat from his brow
Approval, at last, from the only opinion that mattered
Why, thank you, sir
Thank you
Ted has bettered our lives to the point where  can no longer see myself as "the old Jimmy"  was but a day or two past
You may all call me James
From this moment forward
Finally, some gratitude
We're grateful, Ted
It's not that
Those Craftsman tools
they're a dream come true
Your Dad and  were raised with a certain work ethic, that's all
Julie listens closely, admiring Ted's parents
We can't start living like we're the Rockerfellers or something
Mom, Dad
The Rockerfellers are paupers compared to my favorite brother, Ted
You don't have to work another day in your lives
But how would we pay our bills
We just barely have enough for your college tuition, son
Ted's frustration mounts
Don't you get it
In one day  earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue
Oh
Goodness
You're free
You can do anything you ever wanted to do
(after a beat) Like what
Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace
Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico
Now's your chance
But those are our dreams, son
We have to make them come true
Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part
No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives
But who would run the store
Forget the store
Think big
Dad looks at Mom
Forget the store
That stings
Ted, we put a lot of love in our business
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday
Something real and honest
We love our lives just the way they are
Disappointed, disgusted, Ted looks to Julie for support

Julie interviews Ted, complete with tape recorder
have to admit,  always felt
different
Different how
Different like a dwarf at a basketball game
Or different like a lesbian in pumps
don't get the distinction
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew
felt limited
felt confined felt like  was suffocating

So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist
guess
Interesting
Another   approaches
Warm peanuts
No thanks

She said peanuts, you cretin
You never know around here
Julie raises her eyebrows
Taking notes

Is this an gritty expose or a candy ass press release
Write what you want
Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me
(amused) Life must be peachy on Planet Ted
Funny you should say "peachy
" did my homework
Your grandfather was a peach farmer
My adoptive grandfather
Who knows what my biological grandfather did
Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort
Ted loves her spunk
And the chemistry between them
Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier
bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted
See
You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like 'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm
little respect would be nice, that's all
Julie snickers
Money can't buy respect, Ted
Saying what you mean
Meaning what you say
Being an honorable person
That's how you earn respect

Well
What do you think of her
You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax
You're implying she's, what, a gold digger
Julie shrugs
Isn't it obvious

Jealousy is so unattractive
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit

You've got enough people kissing your ass
Ginger returns with a rose
Here you go, cutie patootie
Rich guys always wear flowers
Julie gives Ted a look
See what  mean
- Jay Leno seems charmed
Ted behaves as if he does this every day
The rose from Ginger is pinned to his lapel
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia
Well, Jay
They've been exceptionally supportive
Are they hitting you up for donations
Asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee
Audience
'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy
Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols
What about the future
You planning to rock the boat at all
Stir things up in "Heaven

We know it's still  under all that Armani, but it sure does make him  different
Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and are planning to rethink the magazine
To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty

Matter of fact, Jay, 'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown, "The Girls of Xenia

'   -  - Principal Merkin drives to work, humming along to Liza Minelli's "New York, New York
" The song comes to an end and a radio spot begins
(
) How many times have people told you, "Jeepers, you look swell naked
" Well now's your chance to go straight to "Heaven
" Principal Merkin tries to change the station
But the ad seems to be on every station
(
) (') Come on down for "The Girls of Xenia" pictorial
Let's show the nation our cows aren't the only ones with great udders
-  - Students hover at the bulletin board, reading a poster advertising the "Heaven" auditions
Principal Merkin pushes through the crowd and tears the poster off the board
Completely incensed
- Hundreds of Xenia  have gathered for this meeting
Principal Merkin stands in front of the five members of the city council who sit at a -shaped table
He holds up "Heaven" magazine
Preaching with an evangelical passion
This, my friends, this is not "Heaven
" This flesh rag is a one way ticket to hell
We must voice our outrage
To remain passive in the eye of the devil is like inviting him to a pot luck in your own backyard and asking him to bring the three-bean salad
His supporters murmur agreement
(') For the sake of this community, and its impressionable young minds, propose this publication be banned from our city
His  of supporters
His opponents
Ted slouches nearby
lawyer next to him
The  bangs the gavel and the commotion settles
Thank you for that long-winded but impassioned speech, Mr
Merkin hope you can cut to the chase, Ted
Principal Merkin takes his seat
Ted rises
Playing the big shot lawyer
Julie sits in the crowd, taking notes
With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine
But he has no right to stop others
(to Principal Merkin) Ever hear of the First Amendment
(rising; an outburst) We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community
If that were true, this would be one seriously constipated town
Most guys in Xenia have been looking at naked girls in "Heaven" since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it under the mattress
bit of an  from the crowd
eye their suspiciously
Julie makes a point
Isn't it true, Principal Merkin, that you only care now because "Heaven" is suddenly too close to home
Indeed it is, Miss Conroy
make no bones about it
"Heaven" has gone too far
, another angry man from Principal Merkin's posse, jumps on the bandwagon
Principal Merkin is right
We can't let "Heaven" violate our own daughters, wives, sisters, mothers, girlfriends, aunts
Helen motions to Ted
He quickly locates a page in the report she prepared for him
He handles this like a pro
wouldn't want to name names, Mr
Needleman, or cause any undue embarrassment
But many members of this community have been loyal "Heaven" readers for the better part of the last two decades
Not to mention certain charter subscribers who have developed a voracious appetite for our video library as well
don't suppose, "Courtney Leaves The Convent" rings a bell to anyone
Mr
Needleman dissolves into his seat
Half the men in the audience seem to evaporate
Mr
Nelson, you are Beelzebub's henchman
You are single-handedly destroying the integrity of our community, and  will not have it
'll gather signatures
'll petition the courts
(sheepishly) You do what you have to do, Dick
But if there's a man among us who doesn't like to steal a look at some pretty titty once in a while, let him cast the first stone
The room is suddenly
Principal Merkin gives the Mayor a hard look
Merkin's face contorts in   as he proclaims
- Holding a stack of flyers, Charlie chats with Judy, Merkin's college-aged daughter
You're like a centerfold waiting to happen
And let me assure you, have some serious pull with the publisher
Judy smiles fetchingly
Stashing Charlie's "Heaven" flyer in her backpack
Her father suddenly appears
What the hell are you doing
'm an adult
can do whatever want
My roof, my rules, young lady
He grabs her arm while knocking the stack of flyers out of Charlie's hands
As Principal Merkin drags her away, Judy smiles back at Charlie
He winks
Send us a picture, sugar
We'll get back to you
The stack of flyers  over the railing and onto the ground floor, just as a group of    enters the building lobby
They excitedly reach for the flyers
-  - line of   - all shapes and sizes - snakes around the block and into a doorway
The women are dressed to impress, in very skimpy clothing
Ted pulls up in his convertible Ferrari
The women shout greetings as Ted heads for the door
- We follow Ted as he dashes up the stairs, along the line of women, towards an office
(greeting the women) Hello there
Looking great
Very nice
Charlie looks frazzled
You're late, bro
Sorry
Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic
You'll never believe who's in there
It better not be my Aunt Trudy
They enter
'  - sits with her back to the door
Sorry to keep you waiting
The woman turns towards Ted, revealing herself to be Christy Malone
Ted is momentarily stunned
Hi, Teddy Bear
Christy
You want to be in "Heaven
" turned eighteen over spring break
'm eligible
Ted doesn't know what to say
Charlie's equally stunned
Hell, it seems, has frozen over
feel like 've just been hit by a Mack truck
With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip
'  - Highly modified since the last time we saw it
large flat screen hangs on the wall
high tech computer system for video conferences dominates the room
Ted speaks with Uncle Billy and Helen
So far, so good
Some of them have real Angel potential
Really
So 'm doing
We're impressed but not surprised, Ted
You have your father's impeccable judgment
Dad passes the partially open door
Overhearing
He stops
My father must've been amazing
He was in a league of his own
Suddenly Ted feels his dad's presence, behind him
Sorry -- It's okay
You need me
(holding a list) Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores
Ted takes the list
Gives it a cursory glance
Nods to his dad, as if dismissing him
No problem, consider it done
(to Uncle Billy) had this idea of shooting on location
Outdoors, you know
Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks
You think that would be a problem
We'll send you the release forms, Ted
Our staffers will help in any way they can
You're the Titan of Tushies, the General of Jism
Don't you forget it, Ted-baby
Ted laughs
Completely ignoring his dad
Who backs out of the room
Unnoticed
Neglected
Hurt
- Mom drives up to the house
She stares, aghast
There are tall, beautiful,  everywhere
One cuts the grass
Another pulls weeds
Two others on the roof, cleaning gutters
Still others wash the car
with Jimmy handling the water hose
Drenching the women, more than the car
Shrieks and giggles all around
Neighbors gawk
Ted's dad guiltily enjoys the view, but quickly rushes to his wife
She gets out of her car and steadies herself on his arm
- Ted stands on an ottoman as a  fits him for a prom tuxedo
He towers over his parents who try to talk to him
We feel for them
They've lost control of their kid
You have to understand
This was a big shock, for all of us
One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud
The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son
Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family
Ted looks down at them, literally
paid off the mortgage
ordered that Winnebago you always wanted
Now you're ashamed of me
You ordered a Winnebago
Mom gives Dad a look
Stick to the script
Don't be swayed by presents
We're not ashamed of you, Teddy
We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend
But we can get past all that
We miss you
We miss our son
We miss our family
promised 'd finish high school and that's what 'm doing
What more do you want from me
Dad glances at Mom, hesitant
She nods, giving him the courage to continue
We think you should give up the magazine
Sell it
Let someone else run it
Whatever it takes
We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after
Ted laughs
is your dream, not mine
My dream is so far beyond anything could even imagine
Watch your tone, mister
Why don't you just admit what this is really all about
'm not your real kid and you can't control me anymore
Mom and Dad look stricken
Ted doesn't know when to stop
(') No wonder  was so bored
No wonder hated this one-horse cow town come from talented people who took chances and dared to imagine a life without limits
was never meant to be raised by
Ted storms away, unintentionally  into a on the end table
The frame shatters into smithereens
Breaking Mom and Dad's hearts hangs heavy in the room
- Prom night
Couples slow dance to a Marilyn Manson clone, singing a rock version of "Precious and Few
" Principal Merkin watches on the sidelines
Surprisingly calm
Suspiciously happy
Ted caresses Ginger's bare back as they dance together
His head nestled against her breasts
Not a care in the world
He spots Charlie on the dance floor
Making out with one of his dates, the   , while the other two patiently wait their turn
Teddy
was thinking
Hmmm
After graduation
maybe we could go away together
Whatever you want
notice Christy Malone dancing with her The perfect male specimen
Christy gives Ted a disappointed, longing gaze
But he's oblivious
bet St
Tropez in July would be paradise
For a honeymoon
Suddenly a  blinds them
It's Julie Conroy, doing her job
Following her subject
(') (snapping) You could have warned us
Oops, sorry
Warning: You've got lipstick on your teeth
Julie flashes the camera again
Capturing Ginger's panicked expression
We notice that Julie looks alluring in a deep purple strapless gown
Not so glamorous as Ginger, but far more appealing and natural
Wow
you clean up nice
Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph
'm on assignment
girl has to fit in
Ginger seems testy and jealous
Her true colors emerging
Teddy,  thought we were having a moment here
Of course we were
Suddenly the music dies
Everyone turns to the stage where Principal Merkin stands proudly
Holding a power cord
apologize for interrupting the festivities, but  have some good news
've been reviewing the rules and regulations set forth by the superintendent of schools
And it seems quite clear
(reading from manual) "Minors may not be accompanied to school functions by adults unless they are their parents or legal guardians
" spotlight suddenly finds Ted and Charlie's beautiful dates
(') So long, ladies
Prom's over
The crowd boos, hisses
Honestly, Merk
It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire
Rules are rules
Come on, it's our only senior prom
Deaf ears, Mr
Nelson
answer to a higher power
Charlie steps in like a hostage negotiator
Here's the deal, Merk
Forget the "rules and regulations" malarkey and we'll give you seven minutes in heaven with the Taylor Triplets
Out
Now
Ted realizes his high school reputation is at stake
He steps up on stage
Approaches Principal Merkin
Takes out his wallet
What's your price, Merk
How much will it cost to make you go bye bye
The crowd
You're crossing the line, Mr
Nelson
statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin
'm warning you
new pediatric wing at the hospital
presidential campaign
Name it
Anything
Principal Merkin trembles from the sheer temptation of it
Yet he could never succumb in front of so many witnesses
He has to maintain his dignity
That's it
You're out of here
From nowhere, a flock of beefy   emerge to remove Ted & Co
(') Good-bye, Mr
Nelson
Have a pleasant evening
The Marilyn Manson clone is rapidly whisked away, and replaced by six  in powder blue tuxedoes
As Security Guards carry them away
Ted
Do something
(restrained) What do you want me to do
This is humiliating
We're being ejected from a prom
Hang in there, 'll think of something
As they reach the doors
Well
guess
don't know
guess we should leave if we're not wanted
hear you, bro
We're Angus men in a ground round town
This is what  get for playing den mother in "Romper Room
" Take me to the airport, Charlie
Why don't you just hitch a ride on the horse you rode in on
Ginger storms away in an angry huff
(') (calling after her) Don't forget your broom
Ted experiences a moment of loss
thought  loved her
Chicks are like buses
If you miss one, don't sweat it
There's another coming 'round the corner
One of the Taylor Triplets bats her lashes at Ted
(') (whispering to Ted) Take your pick
They're
Ted grins broadly
He turns and  to his classmates
Everybody, listen up
This prom sucks
Let's party at my place
Responses are mixed
Some cheer, some are undecided
Until the new band starts playing, "Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree
" And   for the exit, following Ted
- muzak version of "Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree," continues
watches the numbers rise to the penthouse
Suddenly the doors open to reveal
- All four penthouse suites have been rented by Ted
It's party central
Very wild
Quickly growing out of control
Kids dance, play drinking games, Spin the Bottle, and generally trash the place
The pizza delivery guy wheels a dolly with a huge stack of pizzas into the party, only to be attacked by the prom-goers like starving beasts
Grabbing the pizzas
Devouring them hungrily
' Ted, Charlie, the Taylor Triplets and several buddies lounge around, drunkenly watching     on Ted's big screen
tacky   rotates on the screen
Ted swigs Dom Perignon straight from the bottle
He shouts orders into his cell phone
Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em
No, leave one
Somebody's grandmother might want one
And while you're at it, 'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads
love those springy head puppies
- Ted looks up as the elevator doors open
Principal Merkin has arrived
Ted confronts him
You kicked us off your turf, Merk
Don't rain on our parade
Mr
Nelson, you disappoint me
First you break our school board rules
Then you break the law
What law, Merk
Having fun
Letting down our hair on prom night
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking
You called the cops on us
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind
Suddenly the whole    appears, in full riot gear
The party's over
Everyone runs for the stairs
Ted gives Principal Merkin a spiteful look and joins the mass exodus
- Drunken teenagers pour out of the building
Dashing for their cars and limos
Ted's among them
Suddenly he's cut off by a Harley that stops right in front of him
It's Julie
Still in her purple strapless prom dress
With a black motorcycle jacket over it
Need a lift
Ted jumps on, wrapping his arms around her waist
Julie takes off
- Julie maneuvers the nighttime streets of Xenia, taking off down a country road
(
) Where are we going
(
) To the best hiding place in the world
'  - Now we understand
Julie's family comes from major bucks
The yard is massive
And resting in a sprawling oak tree is the best hiding place in the world
'   - cozy oasis
Books everywhere
whole series of flashlights hang upside down like lanterns
Giving the tree house a warm glow
can't believe your dad built this for you
He didn't
He had it built
Whatever
Not "whatever
"  It's two different things
He cared enough to want you to have it
He phoned it in
see
doubt it
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap
You're a poor little rich girl
The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted
You think my dad would have been like that if  knew him
You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball
Your dad taught you everything
mean my father
father is nothing but sperm, Ted
It takes a real man to be a dad
It's all so complicated
It's incredibly simple
feel like 'm being drawn and quartered
Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction
Eventually you'll let go
And then what
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you
You're amazing
know
Even when you infuriate me,  still want to kiss you
But you never do
If we were a team, we could do anything
mean, anything
Julie's eyes narrow
She should have known
Cut to the chase, William Randolph
Your audience is way ahead of you
In a word:
That's two words
And 'm out of the "exposed" business, remember need to graduate
Besides, Merk's a boy scout
There's gotta be something
We have to dig deeper
You forget,  dislike  at least as much as him
He shut down your paper
You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and  brunches
He's right, but
good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade
'm honing my craft
Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week
Julie groans
'  - Dressed in a old fashioned barber costume, complete with a handle bar mustache, Principal Merkin sings as part of a The senior citizens clap enthusiastically
Ted and Julie peek through a crack in the doorway
Disappointment on their faces
- Principal Merkin pours soup into the bowl of a shabbily dressed
Julie shoots Ted an " told you so" look
- Principal Merkin supervises a crew of kindergarten , cleaning up the roadside litter
Julie and Ted watch from
See what  mean
He's squeaky clean
He makes Gandhi look like a war monger
Ted steels himself
Somehow, they'll get him
-   - In the golden light of sunset, , a stunning "Xenia Girl," stands on the stairs that curve up around a huge water tower that overlooks the city
Her loose spring dress billows in the wind
Held on by only one button
Exposing in quick glimpses that she isn't wearing a bra
An  holds a portable strobe, attached to a reflector
Charlie shoots with his Nikon
Motor drive whirling
have a great idea
Let's lose the last button
Molly grins
Then unbuttons
We hear a round of "oohs" from below
Ted glances down, where
Hundreds of binoculars, cameras, and camcorders are poised on the scene
Men of all ages are milling around, gawking, focusing their long lenses
Women are conspicuously absent
Except for the gaggle of hardcore  with their placards, denouncing "Heaven
" One Feminist approaches the Mayor
The city tower belongs to the city, not to some pornographer
The library also belongs to the city
And guess what
It's going to have a new Ted Nelson wing with three thousand children's books
The Feminist tries to respond, but a helicopter swoops overhead, drowning out her words
The helicopter rises to the level of the photo shoot where the door slides open
And just when we think it must have been hired by some hard core fans who wanted a closer look, we find Principal Merkin frowning as he barks through a bullhorn
You should be ashamed, young lady
Your body is a sacred temple
Molly flashes him
Principal Merkin averts his eyes
Missing the sight of Molly's dress being blown off her body by the chopper's prop wash
The spectators below
They watch in amazement as her dress floats down to them
(') Young lady,  will pray for god's mercy upon your soul
Don't bother, Merk
'm already going to "Heaven
" (to Charlie) Get them together
(eyes lighting up) Brilliant
Molly, give me all you've got
For Merk
Molly gets the idea
She poses provocatively towards Principal Merkin, who suddenly realizes he's in a compromising position
Stop that, stop that this instant
But Molly pulls off her panties and flings them at him
'    -   - Uncle Billy chortles, his image glowing on a large flat screen monitor that hangs on the wall
Ted leans back in his chair
never saw anybody turn so many shades of red
can't wait to see the pictures
It was incredible
The light, the crowd, everything
Uncle Billy grins proudly at Ted
Such enthusiasm
Have  told you lately how proud  am of you
Seriously
'm doing all right
You're taking this bull of an empire by the horns, but you're still keeping your small town values
You're not letting all this "stuff" spoil you
Ted knows it's not true
He looks guilty
owe it all to you
Without your help 'd be lost
wish  knew you years ago, when my brother was alive
wish he never gave you up
Yeah, well, like my Grandpa used to say
you can't change your Christmas past, but you sure can exchange your Christmas presents
Uncle Billy forces a laugh
Why don't you come to town this weekend
We could play some golf, chase some skirts
Ted smiles at the appealing offer
'd love to, but  really need to crack the books
Final exams are coming up and 've been slacking
You're right
should work, too
Our first issue together is almost ready to print
Thanks, Uncle Billy
Thanks for everything
You're a great kid
Don't you forget it
With that, he's gone
The room is completely silent
And Ted is completely alone
the doorbell
'    -   - Ted opens the door
It's Jimmy, with his shiny new bike
James, what are you doing here
You can call me Jimmy again
Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know
She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother
It's really late
do your parents know where you are
Mom and Dad think 'm tucked safely in bed and that's all they need to know
Will this discussion be continuing in the hallway, or somewhere slightly more inviting
'    - Jimmy seems impressed by the opulence
He takes off his bike helmet, looks around
Impressive
This is bigger than our whole house
Most places are, Jimmy
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile
So, what brings you here at his hour
My new bike
Very funny
came to ask permission to take custody of your room
My room
Better view, more spacious, new carpet
It's a no-brainer
It's not up to me
Mom and Dad said it's yours
They seem to think you're coming home
You can have it, then
'm not going back there
Jimmy whips out a piece of paper from his pocket
If you could just sign right there
You want it in writing
Just a formality
Ted signs
Jimmy squirrels away the paper, excitedly
Starts to zip up his wind breaker
That's it
mean, you don't want to order room service or anything
We could play games and watch movies and stuff
Are you kidding
Mom and Dad discover 'm gone and 'll be doing hard time
Are they okay
Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better
miss them, too
You can't come back
That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine
You're a peach
Funny you should say that
My Grandfather was a peach farmer
Ouch
For the first time, that really smarts
He was my Grandfather, too
meant biologically
That's a crappy thing to say
Look Ted
'm cool with everything
You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town
You've always had an itch for the good life
'm happy for you
This couldn't happen to a nicer guy
Ted listens
(') But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas
You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us
Their kids
didn't forget
You ever look down on them again and call them "grocers" like it's a dirty word, and you'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks
Got it
Ted's stunned
Talk about tough love
Loud and clear
Suddenly the phone rings
Ted sheepishly explains
(') That's probably my office
'  - Well
Where the hell are you
He's on the move
got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati
Let's do it
'    -   - Ted hangs up the phone
Looks around
Jimmy's gone
But his is left behind
- Not much of a place
middle-aged   croons " "  Ted and Julie find their way to corner table
Keeping an eye out for Principal Merkin
don't know
This place seems pretty tame
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood
At least it's not another 4- meeting or a Big Brother barbecue
Amen to that
Their heads are very close together
conspiratorial tete-a tete
Look at us
It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night
We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart
'm trembling with excitement
That has more to do with your proximity to me
(playing along) My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh
have a bit of a goosebump fetish
Not many people know that
figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy
Shoes, if you want to know the truth
Shoes are my thing
Wearing them
Or humping them
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs
That's refreshingly deviant
What about you
'm very aural
Tell me more
Sounds, voices, music, humming
All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch
(feigning a deep voice) see
had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me
(jealous) Portuguese boyfriend
Sounds very "Cosmo
" You live and learn
realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh
saw that one coming
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever
At that moment, the   begins crooning "
" Do you trust me, Julie
Not a chance
Come on
Trust is something you earn, over time
You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire
Ted leans even closer
Looking into her eyes
Using his voice
Being as aurally seductive as he can
want you to trust me
Maybe someday
Julie, 'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth
've seen a lot of really beautiful girls
mean a lot
But none of them make me feel like you do
That's hard to believe
But absolutely true
Ted moves closer
Julie doesn't move away
The  seems to be performing just for them
(
) " feeling deep in your soul/Says you were half, now you're whole
" Just as Ted and Julie are about to kiss, Julie's eyes widen
She grabs Ted's hand
Simultaneously, they turn towards & It's the Mother Lode
That's not just any middle-aged torch singer
That's Principal Merkin
Dressed in drag as Barbra Streisand
And doing a mighty fine job of it
Ted pulls out his camera and fires away
Blinded by the stage lights, Principal Merkin sings and vogues glamorously
He has no idea his secret is out
/  - Ted and Julie rush down the street in the rain, giggling, totally euphoric
They stop to catch their breath
Their clothes are drenched, but they couldn't care less
In no time they've got their arms wrapped around one another, kissing and laughing
We just found the centerfold for "The Girls of Xenia
" Suddenly Julie sobers, pulls away
have to be honest with you, Ted
really despise "The Girls of Xenia
" know, their small town mentality can be maddening
mean your pictorial
It bothers me, profoundly
Aw Julie, it's my job
It's like being a doctor
Julie eyes him skeptically
You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades
You're quick
like that
You think you're working with chimps here
The thing is,  made a commitment
said 'd do it and  have to keep my word
Keeping your word is something can actually respect, Ted
: , - '   - Ted closes the back of his camera
Takes a deep breath
And forces a confident smile
He then peers into the
Where Christy Malone limbers up
Stretching her leg against the wall
Wearing her sexy cheerleader uniform
thought 'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear
do
mean, yeah,  do
have to admit,  am so totally turned on
We should do it
Now
Do it
You know
take the pictures
Christy does her warm-up contortionist poses for Ted
Clothes still on
As reflectors bounce strobes into the shower area
Years of being a merciless tease, paying off right here and now
Christy knows how to make love to the camera
remember the first time you walked into Mrs
Temple's class in 2nd grade
Blue gingham dress
Blond ponytail
Which you pulled, hard
That was code for " like you
" Christy giggles
Wanna unzip me
Ted slowly unzips Christy's top, catching a glimpse of her long, sensuous back
She resumes posing
Flashing a bare shoulder
coy look
She doesn't need direction
She's a natural
(') Remember dress up day
You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess
miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence
Things change
Now 'm taking off my clothes
all by myself
Christy slips off her cheerleader top
Lowers her skirt
Flings it aside
She's wearing only panties the size of a Band-aid
Ted is mute
Staring at her perfect body
(') Well
You have changed since second grade
mean, what do you think
You expect me to think at a time like this
There isn't a drop of blood in my brain
Oh, Teddy Bear, you're funny
Ted steps out of the shower
Out of Christy's sight, he squirms in his jeans
Trying to hide his enthusiasm
suddenly seems to come from nowhere
Nine Inch Nails
" Want to Fuck You Like An Animal
" (sotto) God help me
Ted steps back into the shower
Christy rubs an ice cube on her left nipple
heard they do this on photo shoots
Wanna to do the other one
She tosses him the ice cube
He fumbles
It lands on the floor
You're doing just fine, Christy
Believe me
Then 'm ready when you are
Ted looks through the lens
We can see him trembling
Music blasts as Ted's camera burns through film
They're both getting into it
Water pulsating over her body
Steam rising
Christy begins lathering her breasts
was always too shy to admit how much  liked you
Come on,  was hamburger
You were porterhouse
Maybe on the outside
But inside, deep down, 've always been dripping with special sauces
(she smiles, sexily) Are you hungry
Is he hungry
He's been working up this appetite for ten years
He can barely contain himself
God, you are so hot
Then you better get in the water, before you get burned
Ted calls her bluff
He sets aside his camera
Walks right into the water
Through the steam
Toward Christy
She wraps a leg around him, sucking face, wanting more
(') You and me, finally
This will be so fantastic, Teddy Bear
Trust me
Suddenly Ted stops
Remembering what Julie said about trust
'm sorry, Christy
've been crazy about you forever, and this is definitely a page right out of my palm pilot, but  just can't go through with it
He turns away, but Christy presses her bare body against his back
Wrapping her hands around his waist
Caressing his chest, his stomach
Sure you can
You're only human
It's not like you're made of steel
(she lowers her hand) Or  you
: Ted and Christy locked in a steamy embrace
Rolling on the floor
Hands, arms, lips, tongues, all in motion
As the shower drenches them
Suddenly, they roll into a pair of legs
Both look up
The steam clears to reveal Julie
Arms crossed
Hurt, but not surprised
What's up, doc
She doesn't wait for an explanation
Christy covers herself
Ted chases after Julie
Wait, Julie, wait
-  - Julie dashes out of the girls' locker room, passing a Ted follows, dripping water
'm sorry, Mr
Ted
She pushed right past me
(calling after Julie) At least let me explain
Julie darts into the girls' restroom
Ted stops at the door
Then realizes there is no one else around
He heads inside
'  - Julie's too proud to let him see her cry
But we can tell she's upset
Go away, Ted
Just go
Ted corners her near a row of sinks
Please believe me
It was just a kiss for old time's sake
've had a stupid crush on her since  was seven, but  never got closer to her than four feet and then there she was right in front of me, completely naked
Julie looks at him, pensively
She unzips the back of her summery dress
And lets it fall to the floor
She's completely naked and absolutely gorgeous
Ted gasps
He's been around dozens of naked women by now, but this one he can't just gawk at
This one he really cares about
Being naked is no big deal
It has nothing to do with emotion, nothing to do with love
You can be around all the naked girls you want and you won't be even one step closer to anything meaningful in your life
She puts on her dress, gracefully
As if nothing happened
(') See that
You don't know me even one ounce better than you did before
You and your stupid magazine
liked you better when you were sweet and kind and human, like the rest of us
At that moment, Ted's cell phone rings
Julie walks away, leaving Ted completely alone
He answers, lifelessly
Yes
(
) We've got a huge problem with the magazine, Ted-baby
Our readers hate it
We need to talk
- Ted walks down the hallway
Three  look through the new issue of "Heaven
" Laughing
They taunt Ted
#1 You got a great sense of humor love the three hundred pound Eskimo chick
#2 You like Eskimo pie, Teddy
#3 like the African chick with the big lip
You could stash a lot of weed in there
Maybe even a six pack
Ted's mortified, depressed
Charlie appears next to him with "Heaven" in hand
Holy stinkers, what were you thinking
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty
We wanted to showcase women throughout the world
Next time, make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold
Principal Merkin approaches
Also holding "Heaven" in his hand
Ted,  realize  owe you an apology
You're destroying "Heaven" much faster from the inside than ever could from the outside
Good job, son
Ted could not feel worse
""  -   - Ted, Uncle Billy, and Helen
Meeting with the Our advertisers are wigging out
Half of them are threatening to pull their ads for next month
The other half already did
It was nothing more than beginner's folly
Tell everyone to lighten up
It's a little more serious than that, Bill
The stockholders have requested a meeting
They want our guarantee that this will never happen again
(the words pain her) Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation
Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see
Next month we'll be back to normal
Another disaster like this could sink us
We've got thousands of subscribers requesting refunds
The kid came up with something that sounded good on paper
Who knew our readers wouldn't dig it
Ted bristles
The kid came up with something
We tried to warn you
Sometimes young people need to make their own mistakes
That's how they learn
Ted can see that Uncle Billy's playing this out differently than he imagined
Giving Ted all the "credit
" (firmly; to Uncle Billy) It won't happen again
It will never happen again
""  - '  - Ted sits at his father's desk
Going through paperwork
Figures
Charts
Reports
work
In the b
g
, he hears the   of women
Which distract him
Ted approaches the window and watches a group of girls splashing and playing in the pool
He looks sad
Helen enters behind him
He turns to her
always thought  wanted fame and fortune and beautiful women
But sometimes your dreams come true, and they cause you nothing but grief
just want to chuck everything and sell the stupid magazine
It's not worth the pain
Helen takes Ted's hand, comfortingly
Come, let me show you something
- Helen and Ted sit on old trunk
Helen holds a scrapbook in her arms
Explaining to Ted
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted
They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much
They knew they did the right thing
But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar
You mean they knew who  was
They kept this scrapbook of your life
It meant the world to them
We see baby pictures of Ted, taken through the glass of a nursery
newspaper photo of Ted playing a donkey in a nativity play
And clippings from Ted's high school newspaper
wondered about them, for so many years
wondered if  looked like them, acted like them
wondered why they gave me up
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did
When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late
All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours
My legacy
Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it
They're not my parents, Helen
My parents are back in Xenia and hurt them very much
understand
And the girl  love, she hates "Heaven
" If  keep it, she'll never respect me
But how can you respect yourself if you don't
- Ted's parents and Jimmy walk through the front door
They're stunned to find a huge 24x36 enlarged family portrait, hanging over the mantle
It's the same picture Ted broke in his childish tantrum
Mom and Dad are moved
Even more so when they see Ted
Waiting for them on the couch
Ted rises
Misty eyed
Everything  am is because of you
Can you ever forgive me
(hugging him) Oh, Teddy
We missed you so much
You were always our number one son
(rolling his eyes) Mom, Dad
This display of unconditional love is appalling
We are a
family, need  remind you, that ridiculed and left for dead
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy
will not have my boys arguing
So, when 'm seventeen, can  turn everyone's life upside-down, behave like a total piece of canine excrement, and then wipe the slate clean with a half-baked apology and a Kodak moment
& No
Which is precisely why  got the rights to my new room
(to his parents) need your help
'm really in deep shit
Don't say "shit," honey
Use the strong vocabulary God gave you
Besides, there's no problem too deep or too shitty for us to solve
- Dad reaches for a can of peaches from the shelf
Son, it's a simple fix
The only difference between my store and that magazine of yours is a bunch of zeros
Now, have  ever told you the story about the can of peaches
- "Heaven" stockholders' meeting in progress
Uncle Billy stands at the podium
Ladies, gentlemen
"Heaven" has gone to hell
Behind him are charts, wall graphs
We quickly realize he is a complete and utter turn-coat
(') loved my brother
stood by his wishes to let his son run the company
son he never knew
son that he and his wife gave away at birth
son who was raised in a world quite different from our own
Nevertheless,  was there for the lad
guided him as best  could
But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block
There is only one clear solution
(gesturing to himself) And  think we all know what that is-- (
) --
Ted bursts into the meeting with his Dad
Holding up a can of peaches
Suddenly hundreds of eyes are upon him
Curious, bewildered
Ted dashes to the podium, with passion in his soul and fire in his belly
What are you doing
My job
Back off, Benedict
Uncle Billy steps into the shadows as Ted looks out at the crowd
He's petrified
But he takes a deep breath and finds the courage to explain
(') The only man  called "Dad" owns a little grocery store in Xenia, Ohio
He learned a lot of cool stuff from my Grandpa, who was a peach farmer in his day
Grandpa knew the right thing to say in every situation, and it usually involved peaches
My dad's a lot like him
And he taught me, you have to focus on the peachy side of life, not the pits
Dad's eyes are filled with tears
He's never been so proud
(') There was a time when canned peaches were the hottest, greatest thing ever invented
It was like a little taste of summer, anytime you wanted
Grocery stores couldn't keep them in stock, they were so popular
And even though other canned fruits like pears, plums, and pineapples have come along, people still need to know they can get their canned peaches, on the same shelf, whenever they want them
It's comforting, you know
It fulfills their expectations
The stockholders are listening
Uncle Billy grins nervously
Unable to believe Ted is pulling this off
(') You're probably wondering if there's a point to all this and guess it's just that  goofed last month
not only moved the canned peaches,  restocked the shelves with kiwi, guava, and mandarin oranges in heavy syrup challenged people's expectations
And you can't do that to your customers
So,  ask you for one more chance to fix things and give our readers back their canned peaches
The stockholders  enthusiastically, giving Ted a standing ovation
Ted turns to Uncle Billy
(') Thanks for teaching me an important lesson
What makes a family is love, not blood
All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby
That's right
And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line
Aw, come on, kid
Throw me a bone
'm your uncle for gosh sakes
""  - Ted looks at pictures
Layouts
Reads copy
Listens to his staff
He seems confident
In control
Mature beyond his years
The magazine goes to press
In  , we hear Julie, reading the article about Ted that she wrote for the school paper
(
) "It's easy to fall prey to petty jealousy when considering the young life of Ted Nelson
But how would any of us behave if one day all our dreams came true
Would we handle it half as well
Would we find ourselves making the same mistakes for which we criticize him
" Someone hands Ted a copy of Julie's article
He reads the last portion of it aloud
"One can only hope that Ted Nelson will find bigger and better dreams upon which to set his sights as the years pass
And that he will remember, always, where he came from
" '  - Julie opens her front door
Charlie grins
He hands her a copy of "Heaven
" Page three
Intrigued, she turns to the page
We see a special dedication, "To Julie, My Partner in Crime, With All the Love in the World
" Julie's eyes fill with tears
She flips ahead to "The Girls of Xenia" pictorial, only to find-- Principal Merkin
Singing his heart out, in drag as Barbra Streisand
It's a series of shots from the Cincinnati nightclub
Other shots suggestively include him with Molly in the foreground, as if they posed together
Not bad for a hack
He has a future in yellow journalism
He kicked major ass and you know it
'   -  - Principal Merkin drives
The  plays in the b
g
As one song ends, we hear the  say
This one's for you Dick Merkin of Tecumseh High
From all your students
With hugs and kisses
The voice of Barbra Streisand fills the car
(  ) "People/People who need People/Are the luckiest people in the world
" Principal Merkin pales
He turns off the radio
But somehow, he can still hear the song
As he pulls into the school parking lot, students wave enthusiastically
He waves back tentatively
Anxiety rising
- Principal Merkin swings open his car door to be greeted by the sound of Barbra singing her heart out through the parking lot
Every student's car stereo blasts the song
Students Chanting:  "-, -, -
"  Principal Merkin turns crimson
- Graduation caps fall all around
People hugging, laughing, overjoyed
Ted searches for Julie, but she's nowhere in sight
/
'  - big graduation party in progress
But Ted sits in the corner, looking sad, dejected
Julie didn't show up
He blew it
Jimmy and Charlie approach, with cheering on their minds
Why so melancholy
You were born naked, wet, and hungry
Now you're hip, handsome, and rich
You are the coxswain on the ship of life
Eat, Drink, and Screw Mary
(proudly) taught him that
Great
From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster
You scored big
You got everything you ever wanted
Except the girl
The only one that really mattered
(
) And who might that be
Miss July
Miss August
Ted turns to find Julie
His faces brightens with hope
Julie, wow
was afraid you left
was afraid 'd never see you again
'm not going anywhere, Ted
You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams
decided to let Helen run the magazine
need to go to college, learn a few things, you know
Julie seems pleased
(') And  thought maybe 'd take up boating
've always wanted to be a "coxswain
" Very ambitious
like that
The thing is, 'll need a first mate
know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board
All kidding aside, he speaks from the heart
Julie, you were right
All the naked girls in the world mean nothing
It's the one you want to cover up with your coat that you really love
Julie smiles
Planet Ted
Five years from now
What's happening
graduated from college
Did great, summa cum laude and all
And 'm about to launch a brand new magazine called "

Julie grins

Yellow pages
Let your fingers do the walking
Suddenly the music changes
"People

They're playing our song

Ted and Julie begin dancing and kissing in the b

Charlie and Jimmy feign tears

And we start to  , above the  , into the clouds above Xenia

My parents didn't give up the grocery store
We descend through clouds and quickly find we're

He seems to be swimming in a sea of "Time-Life" style operators
