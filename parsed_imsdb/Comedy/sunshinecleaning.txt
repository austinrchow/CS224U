She passes small adobe houses, the Air force base, parched earth playgrounds, University cafes and other distinctive sights
On the   highway she passes under the freeway interchange, a tangle   of rust and turquoise ramps
The Sandia mountains rise in the   distance as Rose heads up to the nicer neighborhoods of the   foothills

-                                      2 Rose pulls up to an expensive looking Spanish style house and parks
She gets out of the car, pops the hatch and pulls out a vacuum cleaner and assorted cleaning supplies

-   -                        3 Rose drags a vacuum cleaner into a room where expensive decor collides with the debris of a recent party
She collects beer bottles from end tables, book shelves and house plants
Cigarette butts float in cocktail glasses
Rose plugs in the vacuum cord and glances out the sliding glass doors
group of twenty somethings frolic in the pool
lanky trust funder slides open the door and drips water onto the carpet as he makes his way to retrieve a cold beer
He brushes past Rose on his way back out
Rose turns on the vacuum and wonders if he even saw her

See, if we're talking that kind of volume  can absolutely massage the numbers a little
Seriously, you're not gonna be able to keep it on the shelf
Joe pulls out some order forms
Yeah, 'd need to look at some things before  can place an order
The owner looks at Joe's business card
How about  give you a call if decide to-- 'll call you
Not a problem
No problem at all
Even better, 'll swing by
You're on my route
How `bout that
'll swing by tomorrow
Yeah, tomorrow's not good
Thursday then
That's better anyway
That'll give you a chance to take a look see on those other stores
We'll put everything on one order and get you a good price break
The owner seems to consider the offer
Joe scans the shelves
My advice to you - weed out some of this weaker product to make more space for the corn
Like this
Joe reaches over and grabs a packet of organic fruit bar
Apricot Fruit Leather
Whose bright idea was it to stock that
mean come on, what self respecting kid asks his mom for apricot fruit leather

She takes the pencil from behind her ear and, in the way you'd poke a hamster to see if it is dead or merely sleeping, prods Randy's off screen penis

We were working a scene today where this guy offs himself in a sporting goods store
So they had this cleaning crew out there, right
You would not believe how much money they charge for that shit
It's ridiculous

The strap leads to an old pair of binoculars
Behind it, dusty books about birds

Where'd you get those
Up there
Oscar points to the book shelf
Something sad stirs in Joe
Come here
Oscar steps closer
Joe twists something on the binoculars and pushes the lenses closer together to accommodate Oscar's small face
Better
Those were your grandma's
She'd watch birds with those
Oscar walks around the room examining various objects and clunks them against a lamp in the process
Hey, hey
Careful
Joe holds out his hand to retrieve the binoculars
Why don't we put those away
Oscar doesn't want to
He hesitates
Joe raises an eyebrow

Because it's not a toy

How much commission you get on that popcorn

Really good

He sells off the parts of this cow to a bunch of restaurants

What'd he do with the brains and intestines

Lynn takes Norah's hand and examines it
Ow
Sorry
Lynn draws Norah's hand close to her lips
Smiles
Looks at Norah
Norah's a deer in headlights
Lynn kisses Norah's hand
Everything is still and tense
Better
Norah   stares at her recently kissed hand and nods
She looks up to   Lynn
Lynn kisses Norah lightly on the lips
tester kiss
Then again
Softly
Norah doesn't move, eyes locked on Lynn
All is good
Norah leans in and kisses Lynn's neck
Lynn's eyes are closed enjoying the moment
Lynn opens her eyes
The school photos of Lynn sit directly across from her on the shelf
Lynn stares at the pictures
Waves of recognition and confusion register in her eyes
Norah kisses Lynn's neck oblivious
Is that
Lynn pulls away
Are those

How do you have my school pictures

Where would you find old pictures of me

-                                 160 Rose and Oscar struggle to unload the super wet-vac from the van
Other equipment litters pavement around the van
Winston records serial numbers onto a clipboard
'm sure  can turn this stuff around pretty quick
Thanks
For everything
Are you coming to my party
Awkward moment
Rose looks from Oscar to Winston
We're going to Hinkle's Saturday for Oscar's birthday
It'd be great if you came
Sounds like a blast
Rose smiles at the sincere enthusiasm in Winston's voice

'  -  -                             161 Rose steps out of the shower and wraps her hair in a towel
As she walks past the mirror she plucks off the affirmation note and tosses it in the trash
162
'  -     -                162 Rose, Oscar, Joe and Winston sit in a carnival like restaurant
Oscar opens a gift in the shape of a binocular case
He beams with anticipation
Oscar snaps open the case and pulls out the old familiar pair of binoculars
Rose looks disappointed
Oscar looks confused
That other pair we looked at, full of gadgets and gimmicks

No weight
No history
Oscar nods
Joe points to the old binoculars
These here are the real deal want you to have them
Oscar smiles
Rose shakes her head
It's not like she didn't see this coming
But still
Dad, you promised him those others
From the store
He's been talking about it for weeks
Joe looks at Rose with new found confidence
No Rose,  want to him to have these
Winston eyes the binoculars
Wow, is that an old Zeiss
Joe nods
Porro prism
Joe nods full of pride
Eight by thirty Jenoptems
No marks on the objectives
Perfect bloom
Winston looks at Oscar
You got yourself some classic binoculars there
Norah walks in
Sorry 'm late
Norah noogies Oscar and drops a gift in front of him

162   : (2)                                                     162 (to Winston) Hey
Norah kisses Joe on the cheek and ignores Rose
Rose gets up
Where are you going
Rose walks to the bathroom
163
'  -   -                        163 Rose splashes water on her face
Norah walks in and leans against the counter
Rose makes no sign of acknowledgement
Norah grabs some paper towel and holds it out for her sister
Winston cleans up pretty good

She doesn't even look at Norah
She leans past Norah and gets her own paper towel
Norah tries again
read somewhere that beauty is really all about symmetry
Like having eyes the same size and all that
(pause) So, you know, when you factor that in he's like, hot
Rose won't play
She dabs her face and ignores Norah
Norah walks to the door, starts to leave, then turns around
Listen,  know  fucked up, okay
Like really huge and  know that and 'm sorry, okay
It's a bullshit apology
More defensive than sincere
Just the thing that pushes Rose's buttons
God, that drives me crazy
That whole `Oh, 'm sorry, 'm just a big fuck up' routine
Like that's a legitimate excuse
Norah's defensiveness loosens its grip
She steps towards Rose
This is hard for her
Sincerity is not her strong suit
really am sorry
But it really isn't all my fault, Rose
think there's something wrong with you
The way your brain works
mean, what the hell
It's like you can't be trusted with anything
You just screw around all the time like it's all a big fucking game
It wasn't a game, Norah
We're not all just here for your amusement
You should have been paying attention
You should have been focused on the job
Rose finally hears herself
It's all the same old stuff
She grinds to a stop
She knows it wasn't all Norah's fault

163   : (2)                                                 163 You finished

163   : (3)                                                 163 know
should have been there
What are you going to do now
got some ideas
was thinking maybe we could-- Norah shakes her head
've got my own ideas
Rose nods
As they exit, she turns to Norah
So, you really think he's hot
Winston
No

'  -                                  164 Rose and Norah return from the bathroom
Joe eyeballs the girls in silent appraisal of the situation
Seems okay
You gonna open my present
Oscar opens the package of fake tattoos
Cool
The guy said that if you're careful they'll last a whole month
And these aren't stupid kiddie unicorns and shit
They're all based on classic biker designs
Oscar picks up one of the tattoos

What's that say
Li'l bastard
Rose looks at Norah
Cool
Oscar slips his arm out of his sleeve and inside his shirt and stares at Winston admiringly
Rose whispers in Oscar's ear and he pulls his arm back into his sleeve
'm thinking of taking a road trip
Where
Shrug
How
Haven't worked it all out yet was thinking  could maybe take the van
Rose shakes her head
'm selling the van
Don't sell the van
Have to
Can't afford the payment
No, listen
just don't sell the van
Rose forces a smile and examines her pizza
She can't watch her father cling to another impotent dream

164   : (2)                                                   164 Just don't sell the van yet
Okay
Oscar slowly retracts his arm again
With his remaining arm he lifts the binoculars to his face
Rose tells me you make models
Yeah
Any money in that
Not really
The wait staff begins to sing a birthday song

'  - '  -                       165 Rose quietly kisses Oscar's forehead and pulls up the covers
She turns and steals another look before shutting the door

'  -   -                           166 Rose sizes up her stack of unopened bills
She opens one, sighs, sets it aside
She moves on to the next one
The  flickers blue light into the room
Rose stops and looks at the

'  -  -                          167 The phone wakes Norah
She fumbles for the receiver
What
(over the phone) Turn your  on
Channel sixty- five
Norah clicks on the  and watches slack-jawed as a hands menus to two hard nosed detectives
One of the looks up and smiles

Norah focuses on the flicker light of the

'  -                                        168 As if in a dream Rose watches the image of her mother disappear off screen
She smiles

'  -                                        169 Rose walks toward the van with a trash bag that swishes with each step
She takes one last look, then peels the Sunshine Cleaning door magnet off and drops it into the trash bag
She crawls into the front seat and tosses empty pop cans and candy bar wrappers into the trash bag
faint sound nags at her
She looks up to see the  on
Soft white static fills the van
Rose sits a long moment before taking the handset
Hello
Mom
Rose stops and looks around self-consciously before resuming
Oscar turned eight today
We had this whole big thing at Hinkle's
Winston came
After dinner Oscar and Norah got a high score on Centipede and put in  as their initials and got in trouble by the manager
(Pause) don't know if you're in heaven or what
But you're not here and that's too bad for you `cuz you've missed out
You've missed out on some really great stuff

'  -    -                       170 Rose pulls up in her Sentra
The Molly Maid magnet is back on the door and she's in her Molly Maid uniform
She gets out and sees Joe sitting on the steps to her house
Dad
There's something  wanted to talk to you about
Rose pulls a vacuum cleaner from her car
Okay
Well,  was wondering if  could move in with you and Oscar
What
Just temporarily - until  find a place
You lost the house
Oh my god, you lost the house
Dad how could you lose the house
didn't lose the house
sold the house
There's this business opportunity-- Not shrimp  hope

And  got a partner who has experience
'd learn from her
Rose's edge softens slightly
She's listening now
Joe points to where the newly painted Econo van is parked
In bold cursive:
Underneath in smaller letters:      1963
Nineteen sixty-three
Don't make a big deal out of it
Dad
It's a business lie, not a real lie
can live with that
And you'd be the boss
Thank you

She glances at a wind battered map
highlighted route cuts across the country
Destination - California
Norah bobs her head to the radio, sucks on a slurpee
She holds her arm out the window and lets her hand surf the wind

He watches a scrawny girl across the school yard

She glances over to Oscar
Oscar doesn't flinch
With school girl slight of hand, the pigtail rises and falls
It is a magical, flirtatious pigtail greeting
Oscar lowers the binoculars and pulls his sleeve up to reveal the Lil' Bastard tattoo
The girl smiles
Oscar smiles

-    -                  174 Norah walks down a corridor
The kitten clings to her
She turns the corner and walks though a set of doors to what looks to be a play room
Blocks and brightly colored plastic toys litter the ground
Sitting in the middle of the play area is an enormous black gorilla
She turns her massive head and looks at Norah
(captions) have a tooth ache
KoKo responds with thick hands
(captions) Me too
Norah smiles
