2012 75 - : cave painting of the Dreamworks logo
Push past the moon to the sun
Bright
Beautiful
The sun : Cave paintings of a family of cavemen -- we will come to know them as The Croods
(
) With every sun comes a new day
new beginning
hope that things will be better today than they were yesterday
The Croods scurry out of their cave like mice looking for food
Scared
Fast
The Croods are chased by beasts across the desert
They escape from creatures up trees
They hide behind rocks
(
) But not for me
My name's Eep
This, is my family, the Croods
If you weren't clued in already by the animal skins and sloping foreheads - we're cavemen
Most days we spend in our cave, in the dark
Night after night, day after day
Yep
Home sweet home
When we did go out, we struggled to find food in a harsh and hostile world
And  struggled to survive my family
The Croods are chased by beasts across the desert
They escape from creatures up trees
They hide behind rocks
(
) We were the last ones around
There used to be neighbors
The Gorts, smashed by a mammoth
The Horks, swallowed by a sand snake
The Erfs, mosquito bite
Throgs, common cold
And, the Croods
That's us
The Croods made it
Grug protects his family from a
(
) Because of my Dad
He was strong
and he followed the rules
shadow falls across their feet and Grug ushers his family home
2
(
) the ones painted on the cave walls
Anything new is bad, curiosity is bad, going out at night is bad
Basically, anything fun is bad
Welcome to my world
They all run back into the cave where Grug slams the rock door closed
But this time the light casts an ominous tone
(
) But this is a story about how all that changed in an instant
(
) Because what we didn't know, was that our world was about to come to an end
And there were no rules on our cave walls to prepare us for that
against the rock wall
They the screen
: 100 - , ,  forward, screaming, growling, and throwing handfuls of dirt in a He  in the bright morning light
He and  a large boulder
Raaaaar grooooOOOOoooowwwll Glaaaaaabbbbllllllllthhhh
As suddenly as he began, Grug stops
Panting, he waits for the echoes of his outburst to fade
Grug  to the cave entrance, he prepares to  a signal, but before any sound escapes his lips-- , , bursts from the cave
3
(') You're supposed to wait for my signal Eep
Eep
Eep scares a pack of nearby Liyotes away
They pounce on Grug briefly before scampering off
Eep spreads out on an overhanging rock
She
We've been in that cave forever
Three days is not forever
It is with this family
Eep would you come down here
You're being so dramatic
, , charges out next
Her display is more terrier-like
(') No, no, no Sandy, come back here
Remember the signal
Good girls wait for the signal
, , scrambles out next
She is mostly focused on catching Sandy, giving only cursory effort to her display
(') Ugga
As soon as  get Sandy, 'll go back in, and you can give the signal
No,  mean, you're already out now
(
) am waiting for the signal, dad
We  the voice of Grug's nine-year-old son from inside the cave
is eager to please his dad and emulates his every move
Never mind, Thunk
Just, come out
4
(not so fast) Uhh, but if you don't give the signal, how do  know you're my dad
The signal isn't so you know it's me, it's so you know  wasn't eaten by an animal
Beat
Then why is the signal an animal noise
mean, doesn't that just confuse things
Grug sighs
(') don't know
'm still waiting for the signal
Sigh
Hoo hooooo
Hoo hooooo
Thunk comes out growling, and barrels into Grug
Thunk picks up a boulder and throws it
It ricochets off the cliff wall and careens into Grug
Grug gets plowed over by the boulder
Mom, we're ready to leave
() Mom
Grug sits up and smiles
Still alive
Grug's face drops
It's still early
And you're still fat
Breakfast formation
The Croods form up in a flying wedge, with Grug in the lead
5
(') want to see some real caveman action out there
We do this fast
We do this loud, we do this as a family and never not be afraid
Go
,
- The Croods  out of Crood canyon, across the wide expanses of desert
: 150 -  & - Grug and the Croods come to a stop at the They are spent from a fifteen-mile run
() Yeah
breakfast
We see a nest with a huge unguarded blue egg
The Croods take shelter behind a rock
Grug  over the top
Who's up
Eep's hand  up
Thunk is less than enthusiastic
(') We'll flip for it
Grug  Gran on his hand, and  her up in the air
(') Call her in the air
Heads
Gran -, her head buried in the sand
Only her tail is showing
Tails
Thunk's in
(') Positions
6
The family fades back and splits up
They get into fighting/running position
(') Ok
Thunk
Go
Come on Thunk
Thunk
He dashes into the open, the egg
(') Hah
Way to go
Take it to the cave
Thunk  Grug and makes a bee-line for Crood Canyon
Gerf bird smashes Thunk and steals the egg back
(') Oooh
(') Release the baby
Eep and Sandy   on the bird
Sandy  at its heels while   up onto its head
She  the egg from its beak
Down range,
They  their shared tail across the Ramu's path like an arresting cable on a carrier
Ugga  to  the egg to Grug - the gerbils their tail around the Ramu like a bola
The Ramu hard
Ugga and the egg  forward
The Trip Gerbils  up the egg and make off with it
Get um Mom
Do it for the Croods
Gran's cane  the gerbils in the middle of their tail and  them up and over her shoulder
the egg down-range with her cane like a hockey player
from behind hoodoos
They in behind her
The Liyotes  Gran
They steal the egg, and They are
Old lady down
Eep, avenge me
7
Crouched in the shade of a scrubby bush, like a runner on the blocks - she has the Liyotes in her sights
Eep Eep runs after the Liyote with the egg, cutting him off in his tracks he slams into a cactus launching the egg into the air
Eep leaps into the air taking back the egg
Thanks
bunch of Jackrobats see Eep and swarm around her
She loses her footing and throws the egg to Grug
Eep
Heads Up
Grug catches the egg and runs by the entrance of a small cave
Thunk following close behind accidentally trips over the tail of a sleeping Bear Owl knocking Grug to the ground and fumbling the egg once again
Thunk catches the egg just as the Girelephant bears down on him from behind and lifts him onto one of its tusks
The family members meet up as they begin their long run back to the cave
An entire swarm of animals chase the Croods as they head back to their cave
The Bear Owl is awakened and goes after everyone on the chase
Grug protecting his family from the BearOwl tosses each family member onto the Girelephant's back
Grug dodges the BearOwl's attack and uses him as a launching pad to get himself safely on the Girelephant
Thunk is happy to see Dad is safe
Oh hey Dad, can we eat now
Just wait till we get home
Eep put on the brakes
The entrance to Crood canyon appears on the horizon
8
Eep hangs off the edge of one of its tusks as Grug takes over the other
Together they dig their heels into the ground, slowing down the Girelephant
The Bearowl continues the chase
The Croods maneuver the Girelephant to fend off the Bearowl
(') Eep
The Girelephant moving way too fast readies for the crash
The Girelephant crashes into the entrance of the canyon, sending the Croods flying in
They all tumble
Grug makes an extraordinary football catch
He holds tight to the meal as he slams into a rock
Grug holds up the egg
(') Who's hungry
Alright
Good one, dad
Here you go, Thunk
Drink up
Grug tosses the egg to Thunk, Thunk fumbles it and it cracks open
Sorry, dad
Looks like fast food tonight
The family passes the leaky egg around quickly, each Crood gets a taste
Thunk is the last Crood to get a mouthful, he hands it over to Grug-- the egg is empty
That's alright
ate last week
Grug's feet
He looks up - the sun is setting behind the canyon wall
He   his hand to gauge how much daylight is left
Two knuckle warning
Come on Croods
Go, go, go
: 9
200 - - Come on, come on
Darkness brings death
We know this
The Croods
Ugga picks up a heavy stick off the floor
The moon is full
Bath night
(grumbling, Gran tries to run ) You too, Mom
Run for your life
Ugga pulls Gran back
(') don't want to lose my protective layer
Mom, you've got ants
(hanging Sandy up) Whack
Like she's cleaning a rug, Ugga  Sandy hard with the stick
Dust and bugs fly off of her
(') See
Sandy doesn't fuss
Ugga  her hands together and Sandy knows to let go
She hits the floor and  away
() Aaaaaaaaaah
Grug enters and looks around the cave
Is she still out there
You know she hates the cave, Grug
clinging to the side of the sheer rock face above Crood cave
She    to `catch' a few more moments of sun
10
Please come back tomorrow
getting his `bath
' How can she not like the cave
It's so cozy
It is a little, dark, Grug
It's not that dark
Grug is finished with his bath
(') ( ) Eep
Eep
Eep begins to climb down the wall outside when she hears a sound in the distance
Curious, she begins to climb even higher
Grug leaves the cave, searching for her
(') Come on,  gotta close the cave
exiting the cave
Grug sees that Eep is at the very top
(') Eep
Eep continues to climb
Okay, okay
Come on
Behind Grug, the Bear Owl appears up the canyon
It Grug and the open cave and  to attack
Grug sees the BearOwl in full attack mode
(') Grug throws a rock which momentarily stuns the creature, allowing Eep to   and  into the cave
Grug barely gets the cave closed in time
11
(') : 210 - The Bear Owl  his paw through the narrow opening, and  around for the Croods
The Croods are like mice in this world
That was too close
was watching
was fine
What were you doing up there, Eep
don't know
What were you looking for
Nothing
Well then why did you go up there
() don't know
Why don't you know
Stop looking for things
Fear keeps us alive Eep
Never not be afraid
Eep climbs up on a ledge and curls up in the corner where a tiny spot of light seeps in
( ) What's the point of all this
Hmmm
What was that
12
(a little louder) mean, why are we here
What are we doing this for
No one said survival was fun
Nothing is fun
Hmm
Would you come down here
Eep
No answer
Grug  up
Ugga  Grug back down
Grug
Off
Yes
Grug climbs back up
Off
just don't see why she needs her own ledge
That's all
That's what this is about
She's working through some things and needs her own space
What things
How long is this going to take
Really
mean she already doesn't listen to me
pebble hits Grug in the head
It came from Eep's ledge
(') Hey
See
She's listening
13
If she wants to survive, she has to follow our rules
How about a story
Eep loves those
Grug brightens
() That's a good idea
How about a story, huh
Oh yeah, tell us a story
The Croods minus Eep gather in a semi-circle on the ground
Grug retrieves Sandy and her Krispy Bear from the bone-crib
Ok
Can  borrow that
Thank you
Eep
Your old favorite
haven't played with that thing in years
Tonight we'll hear the story of Krispy Bear
Grug sits and waits a beat for Eep to join, but she stays put
As Grug talks, he gestures at a rough sketch on the wall of the cave
(') long time ago, this little bear was alive
She was alive because she listened to her father and lived her life in routine and darkness and terror
So she was happy
But Krispy had one, terrible problem
She was filled with
curiosity
Grug
Ugga covers Sandy's ears
14
Yes
And one day, while she was in a tree, the curious little bear wanted to climb to the top
Wha
And no sooner than she climbed to the top, she saw something new and died
Grug  the painting
Just like that
Yes
Her last moments of terror still frozen on her face
Grug holds out Krispy Bear
The family is terrified
Oh, same ending as everyday
( ) get it, dad
get it
will never do anything new or different
Good man, Thunk
Pan across the walls to reveal they are covered with stories all seemingly with the same ending
Alright, everyone sharpen your teeth and let's pile up
All their worst fears confirmed, the Croods snuggle into one big heap, warm and comfy
Grug casts a glance to Eep's ledge
She doesn't budge
: 500 - 15
- The Croods sleep peacefully in their pile
Except Eep, who tosses restlessly on her
Outside, we hear the and  of prehistoric creatures fighting
But then,
And then cutting through the primordial night is a Unsettling
Unearthly
Eep creeps around her sleeping family and cautiously approaches the "door" to peer outside, when suddenly-- bright light blazes through the gaps around the boulder door, bathing Eep in an -
She chases the flash of light around the cave trying to catch it in her hands
Eep presses her face against the cold boulder, trying to get a look at what is outside, but she can't get more than a blurred glimpse of the canyon beyond - and the disappearing light
Desperate to see more, Eep braces her back against the cave and  the plug rock with her legs
Slowly, she shifts the rock, careful not to wake her father
It takes all of her strength, but she manages to move it just enough for her to   out
- Eep stands outside at night for the first time ever
Her heart races
The hot night wind blows against her face and through her hair
The forbidden sensation is exhilarating
The canyon beyond is quickly swallowing the light - it will be gone in another few seconds
With one of her hands pressed tightly to the cave `door', she steels herself
Eep   and  after the light, through the  , bounding from side to side
As she disappears into the darkness of the canyon, we
: The light ahead is growing brighter
Eep is closing on it
In her excitement, she missteps and  a stick underfoot
16
It was barely audible
Eep instinctively
huge  of a   is cast on the wall above her
Eep throws a rock at the shadow
She    the stone wall with unexpected speed
The Creature
Eep tops the wall and
: 550 - - Eep steps into a small clearing
Stuck in the ground, is a
As far as Eep knows, this is the thing she was following
Eep crouches down and cautiously approaches
- Eep can feel the heat from the fire on the palms of her hands and her face
But camouflaged against the rock wall behind her, something
stands upright and creeps up behind her
Eep reaches out to  the flame
The torch blows away from her
The wind has changed direction
The breeze at her back, Eep smells the Creature behind her
On her face, awe turns to determination as she wheels and grabs the creature
She  and  it over her shoulder
It hits the torch, knocking it to the ground
Eep jumps back,  a good-sized rock - she's poised to bash the Creature's brains in
Nuh
Nuh
The Creature defensively raises its arms, hands in front of its face
No
Hands
Eep , shocked to see   attached to this monstrosity
The Creature slowly puts his hands to the sides of his grotesque head, and  its mask
It's a boy
he's This is
17
Augh
Eep   a few paces,  the rock on Guy's foot
Shhh
Eep moves swiftly to silence him
She  on him and his head sideways
Guy is
He feels around for a stick and  Eep in the side of the head
(') Ow
() Air
You talk
'm a person, like you
Eep  the boulder aside and  Guy with one hand
(') Sort of
like you
Eep  Guy's mouth and pokes around inside
She at him
Turns him upside-down
(') Okay, could you not, hee hee hee, that tickles
Hey
Eep looks closely at , a sloth wrapped around Guy's waist
Belt's eyes
Augh
Eep  Guy on his head
Wow
-- Eep jams her foot over Guy's mouth
18
Quiet
'm not supposed to be out here
Guy  her foot
(') She  Guy in the stomach
He  sideways
Guy is getting the worst of this encounter
Eep kicks Guy off- frame
We  the fight continuing
: Grug is awakened by wind coming from the cave opening
He pushes the "sleep pile" off of him
Checks Eep's ledge
but she is gone
( ) Eep's gone
What
Grug
Stay in the cave
Grug stands outside the entrance to the cave
Peering into utter darkness
He steels himself
and then releases his hand from the "door
" : 560 -   ( ) Guy is still on his knees
(in pain, defeated) Wow
You're really strong
The flame
Guy  toward it
Eep him
No
It's mine
No, no
caught it
19
No way Guy is getting past her
It's dying
can fix it
Eep doesn't want to
(') Please
hate the dark
Eep sees a kindred spirit
She gets out of his way
Guy the torch and
Eep scoots closer to Guy, staying in the circle of light around him
As Guy brings the fire back to life, the relief on his face is familiar to Eep
This boy seems to have power over light itself
Eep is smitten
It does what you tell it
Well, yeah, sort of
The sun
No, no
Fire
(to the flame) Hi, fire
() It's not alive
But you said it was dying
Uh sorry,-- It comes from where you come from
No
make it
Eep  her fist,  Guy tightly by the hair
Make some for me
20
Ow
Okay, it doesn't come out of me
Make
Eep  Guy like a tube of toothpaste
You do this a lot
Something
Eep  Guy - he's broken
Are you dead
Can  have your fire if you're dead
Belt  two flat rocks together and places them on Guy's chest like defibrillator paddles
Guy upright
Hey, those are cold
Squirf
You think
Listening shells, activate
Belt  Guy use shells to  to the ground
(') concur
Tiger girl, we need to leave immediately
He tries to pull her by the arm
She stays put like an anchor
don't even know you
(pained, rushed) Ow
'm Guy
Guy
And this is Belt
Cook, conversationalist, navigator, also keeps my pants up
21
Hhiiyaa
Yaaa
What are "pants up
" Who are you
Eep
(cutting her off) Let me clarify, Eep
The world is ending
What
'm calling it
( ) The
End
Da da daaaaa
How do you know
Guy and Belt both do gestures to accompany the Da da daaaa
It seems very important to them
've seen it
It's coming this way
First, the Earth is going to shake
Then it breaks open
Everything falls in
Fire
Lava
don't mean to sound too dramatic, but Aaaaaaaugh
Believe me, everything we're standing on, all this right here, will be gone
Again with the gestures
It's a little weird to Eep
(') We've got to get to high ground
know a mountain, that way-- He points into the distance
22
(') It's our only chance
(extending his hand) Come with me
Guy and Belt reach out their hands to Eep
can't
Guy hands the shell to Eep
And Eep is mesmerized
Guy pulls his hog-mask back down
Okay
Here
If you survive, call me
Eep test-blows the shell
It makes a sound, she giggles
When she looks up to thank Guy, he is
Thank you
Hello
Hey
Eep  directly into Grug
(') Dad
Are you hurt
What took you
Nothing
left on my own
You
youuuuuuu
ww-what
Dad, let me explain
low  interrupts them
Sniffing around
It passes over a log
to reveal Grug hanging under the log by one hand, Eep dangling in the other
(') () You never let me talk
You're grounded
: 23
610 - -    - Grug and Eep move up the canyon
Eep furiously kicks a rock, it nearly hits Grug
Hey
Things are tense between the two
At the , they are met by the rest of the Croods
Eep
Mom
Grug
What happened
You know what,  am so mad right now, that  can't talk to her
Eep
You'll never believe it
found something new
New
The Croods all  up stones
They form a defensive circle
New's a big problem
Eep is trapped in the middle of the defensive formation
She  out
Wait
Wait
Eep
Stay inside the family kill circle
It wasn't bad
24
New is always bad
No
He was nice
What
Excuse me
He
Oh
Well,  thought he was a warthog, but then he turned into a boy
Strange
Usually it's the reverse
Grug  an eyebrow
Eep's got a boy hog
Eep's got a boy hog
Eep  Thunk in the back of his head
There was a boy
Watch, okay
'm gonna call him
Eep pulls out the
She  into the shell - the sound  the Croods
They  the shell from Eep's hand and  it with their rocks
Eep is incredulous
The dust clears - the panting Croods are satisfied the object is gone
(') What is wrong with you
It was dangerous
( ) It was beautiful
You want to see dangerous
Here
She pelts Thunk with a rock
Owww
My sniffer
25
Okay Eep, that's it
We're going back to the cave and you're going to stay in there until you're older than
her
What
You can't keep me inside forever
Eep throws a tantrum of epic proportion
She  a rock on the ground
It  to dust
strange  is heard from under the ground
Then a small amount of sand falls from up above
crack starts to splinter under their feet
(') He said this would happen
Then
The ground starts to
Get to the cave
The Croods  through the  , fighting their way through falling boulders and shifting ground, heading towards the safety of their cave
The Croods see the cave entrance
The canyon walls above their home start to crack
Grug sees that the falling rock will crush the cave
(') Look out
Stop
Grug leaps and tackles his family, protecting them from the mass of rocks crashing down
The top of the canyon collapses and the Crood's cave is destroyed
Everything is engulfed by dust
The earth settles
: 710 - The dust clears a bit - the Croods are in a tight ball, covered by Grug
Grug stands, all Croods were sheltered and safe under his mighty arms
(') Is everyone okay
Yes
Grug, the cave, it's gone
26
Grug looks back to Crood cave
It is gone
No
Grug searches the rubble for any sign that the cave might still be there
He finds one handprint, split in two
He carefully fits them back together
Emotional, he lowers his head
As Eep steps forward, a shaft of light filtering through the dusty veil from the wreckage crosses her face-- As the dust descends, Eep sees    beyond
You really need to see this
The dumbfounded Croods stare in awe at the beautiful world
The Croods look out at the new world
(') We should go there
No
No one is going anywhere
Grug pulls Eep back from the precipice
(') What else did that boy say
Suddenly, bursting from the New World is a giant flying creature - a
The Croods reel back as it sails overhead
They turn to watch the Turtle Dove as it flies away
They hear a familiar menacing growl
It's the
It roars and charges toward the Croods
Grug instinctively  a giant boulder and rolls it in front of his family
The Bear Owl runs and swats the massive boulder away like a ball of yarn
But the Croods are not behind it
They are running towards the New World
27
Grug
Just go
Go
Go
The Croods run towards the precipice with the Bear Owl closing in
They reach the edge
The Bear Owl dives
The Croods
They hang for a moment and begin tumbling down a steep jungle hill
: 776 - The Croods tumble through a twisty mess of giant roots and strange plants and land in a heap
They all lie on their backs, disoriented, but momentarily calm
Grug sits up first
He turns to the high, high, cliff above them -- to the top, where they have lived all their lives up to this moment
few loose pebbles continue to tumble down
There is no sign of the
The others stand up, and they take in this new place
Grug takes a deep breath and then quickly counts: One, two, three, four, five -- Grug smiles
Gran lands in a heap behind him
(') () Six
(winces in pain) Oh
Where are we
don't know, 'm not sure
Down
In a lower place
One thing's for sure, we can't go back the way we came
28
The Croods
They are disoriented
Sniff sniff sniff Grrrrrrrrrrr
(hushed, urgent) Sandy
What is it
Sandy  at something almost disappearing into a bush
Grug  catches Sandy by her leg
Grug  her back like a dog on a leash
No, no
Come back, Sandy
Sandy has a  in her mouth
Grug knocks it from Sandy's mouth
gaggle of mousephants run out from the bush and scurry away
(') ( ) We can't be out in the open like this
We need a cave
Now step where  step
They start moving
(') () Okay
Stay quiet
Hopefully nothing big knows we're here yet
- a huge colorful predator, senses something
He   and
moving fitfully through the strange forest
(') Wait
Okay
Wait
Okay
Wait
Okay
The Croods cautiously move in fits and stops through the middle of this thick, pre-historic rainforest
() So Dad, just to be clear, are we looking for the exact same cave
() 29
(') If it was me, 'm just throwing this out there, if it was me choosing the cave, would go with a smaller cave
As they trek, strange creatures ( , ) watch these foreigners
In the front of the line, Grug is freaked out
But in the back Eep is taking in the wonders
They pass through a curtain of hefty hanging pears
After they pass the "pears" all turn to watch the Croods
leaf  down
Wait
Eep and Grug
Dad
'll take care of this
Grug launches into his Threat Display - (') WWAAAAaaarrgghhaarrraaaarrgghhh
He flails his arms around and jumps about in front of the nearest Punch Monkey
No reaction from the Punch Monkey
Grug stops, confused
The Punch Monkey now breaks into a Then hauls off and -  - Punches Grug in the face
Grug reels back, surprised - turns
Right into another Punch Monkey
It winds up and -
- it hits Grug - Grug reels back - into another Monkey -
- Alright dad, go get `em
Oh, oh, now you got em-- Now they're really hitting you
Dad  got it, just stop running into their fists
Gran joins in and punches Grug in the nose
Hah, 'm loving this
30
Grug, when you're done, we should get going
Wide shot: Grug is being bounced back and forth like a pinball from one punch Monkey to the next
The Punch Monkeys are whooping and hollering - this is great fun
The Punch Monkeys let go of Grug and begin running away for no apparent reason
Grug staggers backwards into the family
That's right
You can't get past this
colorful 'bush' rears up - it's not a bush, it's a The Croods react, terrified Grug throws a rock at it
The Macawnivore catches the rock and
- Climb
Climb
Climb
Grug pushes and forces the Croods up a huge tree then as it steps away-- it is actually a giant animal
' :  cave
(') The Croods jump off the bird leg in hopes of getting to the cave
(') Come on
Hurry up, let's go
Come on
The Croods all    in the direction Grug pointed
They step inside the "cave
"
The front of the cave comes down
The Croods have jumped inside the  of a
31
Hey look
This cave has a tongue
Awesome
: 1250 - The Land Whale stands up and then  the Croods out through its blow hole
The Croods land in a heap
Okay, that's one, two, three, four, five
six
And seven
if we're counting Chunky the Death Cat
Grrrrrrrrr
The Macawnivore appears from behind some nearby grass
It looks at the Croods with delight
Suddenly, the shadow of the setting sky passes over the Macawnivore
It freaks out and retreats into the forest
Hah
It's scared of the dark
wait
we're scared of the dark
And for good reason, because as the  from the setting sun falls across the Croods
Suddenly, thousands of    from the grasses around the Croods and form a huge undulating cloud above them
It's a beautiful sight
The cloud of Piranha Owls then  on a massive Moments later, they fly back into the air - the whale is It  to the ground
Kill circle
The Croods form their defensive circle, brandishing rocks
Eep spies a  lying in the sand
She  for it
32
(') Eep
Eeeep
Eep breaks a horn from the skull and  on it loud and long
hearing the horn
He is happy to hear the sound, knowing it's Eep calling him
Then as Guy begins walking towards the sound, Guy notices the circling birds in the sky
Alarmed, he  off
Guy appears at the treeline
He spots Eep standing alone in the clearing
He sees the birds heading towards her
He runs and leaps off a   jumping right over the  who are huddled near the
Guy lands and in one fluid motion knocking the horn out of Eep's hand to stop the noise then  a spark with two
The birds close in, blotting out the remaining light
All goes
Then, a tiny leaf of flame  to life before Guy
He  two more handfuls of grass on it, and it The light  the onrushing red tide of birds like a knife
For a few moments the Croods are inside a of the tiny monsters
The mass
Grug  at one last smoldering bird  past
Grug  to see Guy,  his daughter
Grug's expression
He
Ta-da
(Sigh
) Grug pushes Eep aside and shows Guy his threat display
Auughhauhhhgggh
: 1275 -  , Suddenly, Guy and Eep are circled by the Croods
They are in defensive ape-like positions
Each doing their threat display
33
Raaarr, grOooOOOOowwllll, GLaaabbbllllellelller
Guy stands in front of Eep defensively
Cavies
Cavies
Cavemen
Stand back
They're practically animals
See their bony, sloping foreheads
Oh
yeah
The huge primitive teeth
Er
yeah
The excessive body hair
Oh, that one's got a tail
Uhhh
yeah
Guy  his knife
Close your eyes
'm going to have to take their lives
(slapping the knife away) No
It won't help
() They're my family
What
Eep nods toward Thunk
Ah, the sun is in his hands
34
The Croods keep circling
No
No
It's "fire
" Where did it come from
() He made it
Grug grabs him and squeezes him tight
Make some for me
It doesn't come out of him
Make
Make it
Guy's ribs are cracked for the second time
You know, you're a lot like your daughter
Guy falls in a heap
Great, now he's broken
(
) Oh, it's a baby sun
Grug turns to see Ugga, Thunk, Gran and Sandy are now sitting very close around the fire, transfixed
Whoa
Stay back
We don't know what it wants
As Grug moves around the circle, picking up sitting Croods and placing them a safe distance from the fire, he talks to them like a kindergarten teacher: (') Now we'll all sit here, and wait for the sun to come back
And tomorrow we'll find a new cave, and pretend today never happened
() 35
(') (looks at the fire) Isn't this fun, Eep
Grug looks around to see that Eep is kneeling beside Guy
(') Eep, don't touch him
Goodness knows where he's been
Suddenly, behind Grug, Sandy  the torch
She shakes it with her teeth,
Dad, Sandy's hurting fire
Grug reaches down and scoops up Sandy
(: From this point, Grug will hold onto Sandy, no matter how much she struggles, kicks and bites
) Sandy
No
Fire is not a play thing
Aww, what a cute little guy
Hey, stay back
The Croods snatch at the embers as they dance in the air around them
(') No, no, no, wait
One of the embers has caught onto Thunk's tunic
It likes me
(after a beat) Hey
'
Thunk takes off running like a maniac
The flame explodes into embers, which starts more fires in the grass around him
Grug looks at the growing fires with utter confusion
(') () Ow
You're not my friend
Stop, stop touching me
36
Thunk
Uh, try hiding from it in the tall dry grass
Thunk sprints through the grass, arms flailing, as a ring of fire blazes up
(pleading with fire) Stop please, please
'm only nine
Gran cackles at her grandson's misfortune, but then she realizes her
Angrily, Gran starts to slam the burning end of the stick on the ground, trying to put it out
But she only ends up making more small fires
Ooh, more fire babies
While Gran tries desperately to save her cane, Ugga starts throwing sticks on the small fires, which begin to grow in size
: Hi
So, your Dad, he's trying to kill me
Yeah
But  won't let him
: Eep and Guy witness the  : (
) Hold on son, come back
: is chasing  in circles, throwing rocks at his flaming butt
don't like you anymore
37
Sandy, who is still in Grug's arms, but facing backwards, is now holding onto a burning stick and lighting everything she passes on fire
Weeeee
Gran, who is still trying to put out her stick, is batting it into every tree and bush she can hit
Get out
Out
Ugga carries a  above her head and then tosses it onto the small fire
Eat up, babies
Ugga ignites a massive bonfire
The Croods appear like a bunch of violent, lunatic pyromaniacs
Gran is pounding her walking stick on the ground
- she is standing on the edge of a giant corn field that is slowly catching on fire
Die
Die
The fire on her cane has finally gone out
(') win
She smiles
And then -
The giant ear of corn explodes blasting Gran off frame who slams into Thunk
The speeding ear picks up Ugga, Grug
They're not so scary once you get to know them
Eep and Guy are  by the speeding corn
38
Who are you people
Oh, 'm sorry
We're the Croooooods
And you are
Uh, Guy
() Hi, Guy
The speeding ear  into a lone tree, sending Guy and the Croods sprawling across the tundra
The flying ears   and  like colorful fireworks
Wow
Looks like magic
And smells like food
Popcorn kernels   upon the Croods
They are Don't eat it, it's new
: 1425 - The Croods burst out of a mountain of popcorn
Still alive
(0
) Come on, keep eating
Squirf
Guy  out the side of the popcorn pile like a prisoner escaping Alcatraz
gasping for air (checks to see if he's been ) 39
Hey, where's Guy
Guy  for the mountain
Eep  on Guy like a tiger
No
Going somewhere
The mountain
High ground
End of the world, remember
That already happened
It destroyed our cave
() Noooo
That was just the beginning of the end
The end of the end is still coming
(as if to a dog) Eep
Drop it
Eep  him down
Guy  but discovers Eep hasn't let go of his hand
Guy is  backwards like he's been tied to a piling
We can't let him go
What if we don't find a cave before sunset
What if it takes a few days
What if the birds come back
We need his fire, dummy
Grug grabs Guy and throws him in a log
Fine
You're staying with us till we find a cave
Grug hoists Guy in the log onto his shoulder
40
Grug moves out,  from the mountain
The family falls in behind Grug
Thunk is carrying a huge piece of popcorn that he's snacking on
What
No 'm not
Don't make me part of this
Stay here if you want, but let me go
've got a dream, a mission, a reason to live
() Not anymore
( ) Umm
've got an idea
Let's go to that mountain
way in the distance
( ) It's too far
Dad really has his heart set on a cave
Uh, there, are, caves on that mountain
Have you been there
It's a mountain
Mountains are safe
Mountains have caves
And water
And sticks
Mom
Did you hear that
can get my own stick
Yes
Sticks
Caves and sticks
Crazy sticks
Let's go
On cue, a
This gets Grug's attention
Grug The Croods wait to see what's going to happen next
Mammoth  out of sight,  by the ground
Da da daaaaa
41
Sandy tries to attack Belt
Ugh
That thing is weird
Belt antagonizes Sandy by sticking his tongue out at her
Sandy goes at Belt again
No no, it's okay Sandy
That's just a belt
Grug takes a step back
Turns
've made a decision
We're going to, that mountain
Don't ask me why
It's just a hunch
It just feels right
don't know Grug
We've never really walked that far
don't think my feet can do that
'll never live long enough to get there
( ) Let's do it
() Oh come on, just think
Our whole family, packed together on a long, slow trip across country
Days and nights with just each other
We'll tell stories
We'll laugh
(glancing at Eep) We'll become closer as a family
Eep  one eyebrow
: 1460 - The Croods have not traveled far
The camera starts tight in on Thunk and Sandy
Sandy is harassing Thunk
Aaaaaaaaugh
Get her off
Get off
42
If you're not ready to challenge her, then don't look her in the eye
We follow Sandy as she moves past Gran
Could you keep your big giant arms on your side of the trail
Sandy moves past Ugga, Eep and Guy who is still stuck in the log and being carried by Grug
No more touching
No more touching
Isn't this fun
We're taking our first trip together
Thunk accidentally bumps into Eep
(') Stop shoving, or  will pull out your tongue
Do you want me to turn this family around
Do you
Because  will turn this family around so fast
The camera slowly pulls out from the family in chaos as they walk across the burned out landscape
- : The Croods are traveling across the dry land
The camera has pulled out from the family as they travel
Family chaos continues
Dad,  gotta go
Come on, you can hold it
don't think so
(') ( ) gotta go really bad
43
Thunk starts to
() Go behind one of those lumpy things and make it fast
Ow
Something bit me
() don't blame it
Maybe we should have stopped for water
- : Liyote turns to watch the Croods as they travel
Dad, can  take a turn carrying him
No
How about now
No
Now
No
(even louder)
can do this all day long
No, no, no, and still no
- : 44
Oh yeah, more traveling
Now we are in the Turkeyfish hunting grounds
The camera is so far away the Croods are only a speck in the frame
: Grug, exhausted, in the foreground with family chaos over his shoulder
'm not dying on an empty stomach
Grug, we're all pretty tired
'm pretty dizzy, so 'm just going to lay down for a minute
We'll eat when we get there
It's taking too long
'm grabbing a snack
Gran jumps up and tries to grab Belt
Belt pulls a bone knife and defends himself
No
No
No
Don't do that
He will cut you
That's not food, he's a pet
My pet
What's a pet
An animal that you don't eat
We call those children
No man should have a pet
It's weird, and wrong
It's-- (spies giant bird) It's food
No, no please
45
Not that
That
: 1075 - sound comes from the grasses ahead
giant raises its toothy head
Food fixes everything
Grug grabs Thunk
(') Alright, show me your hunting face
Arrgh
Eep shows her hunting face
Not you
You're still grounded
(') Come on, Thunk
My feet hurt
Leaning against a rock next to Gran, Sandy, Eep and Ugga
Guy notices Eep is agitated
She  in the direction the men went
You look tense
'm not tense
Angry girl wants to be doing what they're doing
Ow
wasn't ready
46
Thunk   the bushes,  by the Turkey Fish
Grug is being  behind
(') Hang on Thunk, 'm coming
Why are you doing this
What are they doing
Hunting
Get it off
You stay away from me
No seriously, what are they doing
The Turkeyfish squashes Grug into the ground
Then continues chasing Thunk
(to Turkey Fish) You've got a ton of eggs
Just make another egg
Thunk    and  against the rock
The Turkey Fish climbs to the top of a nearby rock and dives off
(') Now you're just rubbing it in
on a rock in front of the Croods
The Bronto Scorpion suddenly
There
Who's hungry for scorpion
The Croods  at the legs
They  and like lobster legs
What happened to the egg and the bird
47
( ) You know, we lost him
But when the bird stepped on me and pushed me into the ground, the scorpion grabbed a hold of me and one thing led to another and here we are eating him
Win win
The dismembered legs continue to
Guy looks ill
Not enough
Not enough
need more need more
Gran looks hungrily at Guy
() Oh, look at that
She's not gonna eat me right
You're too skinny
If she was gonna eat anyone it would be-- (') Owww
She's locked her jaw
Mom
Sandy gets up from the table
Someone get a stick
Get her off
Guy looks on, horrified
(') Oh you sick old monster
Hurry
Put the stick in her mouth
Belt gives Guy a "let's get out of here" look
Belt rolls Guy away from the family
Hold her still
Use a rock
Ugga would you just hit her legs
Guy
Eep chases him and pins him down
48
Why are you rolling away
Owww
just want something to eat
You have bug for dinner
Plenty of bug
Please
'll let you help me hunt
Really
Ahhh
They're all over me
Tell my story
- Guy lays a snare in the low grass
He  to the base of a rotund, spikey tree, unwinding more rope as he goes
He  the rope around the base of the tree
Then he hands the loose end to Eep
Belt stretches his arms Guy  jumping and points up to the top of the tree
Eep takes the cue
She  up and grabs the leaning top of the tree
Her weight gently  the tree top down to the ground
Okay
Guy carefully  the trigger
What do you call this
trap
What does it do
Guy makes sound effects to get his point across as he describes the trap
49
(explains with sounds) soft whistle Raargh, Thump thump thump, thubububububub soft whistle poom
Tadaaaaaa
How long have you been alone
Belt opens his arms wide showing Guy has been alone a long, long time
(') So what do we do
Guy pulls out a weird miniature
How's your acting
getting ready to eat the -
The Turkey  the creature to his mouth to  it, but he's  by a  sound
He  to see the silly little puppet dancing about
The Turkey Fish  his meal and cautiously  the puppet
working the puppet
Eep is having the time of her life
(') Oh, you're good at this
They are so into what they are doing, they accidentally get
(') Oh, sorry,
Just move your arm
no, your other arm
Oh, that one's mine
In their struggle to  themselves, Eep and Guy inadvertently insult the Turkey Fish
It
Eep and Guy don't notice
The Turkey Fish  the snare,  the rock and the fake bird off of Guy's head,  it
(') Uh
It didn't step in your trap-y, thing
50
Yeah,  noticed
Eep   in front of the bird
The Turkey Fish grabs Guy and tosses him high across the open field
He goes flying through the air, screaming
- hearing the commotion
Guy lands back in the log
Where's Eep
Eep is in full parkour as she runs from the Turkeyfish
She's awesome
Grug
He's going to  the trap
Eep
Dad, no
She  the snare,  Grug
The Turkey Fish  the trigger
The snare
The bird  at the cavemen, but comes up short
The Turkey Fish   into the air
He  a couple hundred feet up
and  down in a cloud of feathers
: 900 - / over an open fire
It looks golden and juicy
Grug is agitated
The Croods are devouring the Turkey Fish
It's an avalanche of flavor
are eating like wild animals
They practically  each other for scraps
and fill the night air
Guy is amazed and shocked at how the Croods are wolfing it down
51
Guy sits to the side, his ankle roped to a heavy rock
Guy and Belt share a concerned  as they politely eat their meal
Eep comes over and sits next to Guy
( ) Looks like we won't be having any leftovers
What are "left-overs
" () You know, when you have so much food to eat you have some, left over
We never have that much food
Grug is struck by Eep's words
Ugga sees Grug is hurt
Guy and Belt are struck by this as well
Grug, how about a story
That's a good idea
How about a story huh
Yeah a story, tell us a story
Croods gather around Grug
Once upon a time there was a little tiger who lived in a cave with her family
There were a lot of rules, but the big, simple one was to never leave the cave at night
And the door was so heavy, you'd think it would be easy to remember
So easy to remember
know
But, while everyone was asleep, she went out anyway
No
52
Yes
And no sooner than she did, her cave was destroyed and everyone had to go on this long, sucky walk, with some weirdo they met, and died
The end
Whoa
did not see that coming
Twist ending
My stories never end like that
Yes
Two stories in one night
The Croods  Grug and  around Guy
Guy is uncharacteristically dumbstruck
- Okay
But it won't be as good as Grug's
Um, once upon a time, there was a beautiful tiger
She lived in a cave with the rest of her family
Her father and mother told her, "You may go anywhere you want but never go near the cliff, for you could fall
" And die
Good story
Thinking the story is over, the Croods begin to get up
As Guy begins talking again they settle back down
But when no one was looking, she would go near the cliff, for the closer she came to the edge, the more she could hear, the more she could see, the more she could feel
Finally, she stood at the very edge, and she saw a light
She leaned out to touch it, and slipped
And she fell
And she flew
Where did she fly
53
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
place with more suns in the sky than you can count
It would be so bright
place not like today, or yesterday, a place where things are better
Tomorrow isn't a place, you can't see it
Oh yes, yes it is
've seen it
That's where 'm going
Grug studies Guy
Is he crazy
Eep though is entranced
Eep and Guy lock eyes
There is something growing between them
Grug and Belt see it too
Grug is not thrilled
Well,  are going to shut our eyes and sleep
And when we wake up we're going to find the place that has everything we want
Tomorrow
cave
Grug stuffs Guy neatly back inside the log
Grug by the fire with the      far away from Eep
: '
snoring, tossing and turning 54
Morning light kisses Grug's cheeks
He's sound asleep
to reveal that Guy's log is now teetering over a cliff edge - there was another subduction during the night, and half of the Croods' sleeping platform has sunk two hundred feet
Grug is still grasping Guy's log, which now hangs over the fresh abyss, and the still- asleep Guy is now  out of one end
In the nick of time, Grug  position, inadvertently  the log, and Guy starts slipping out the  end
Guy , looking down
: 1600 - - The Croods trudge behind Grug as he cautiously makes his way to the mountain
Grug , and  the ground - he moves like a man in a mine field
Meaning
Eep walks alongside Guy, who is still being carried by Grug in the log
That was too close
It almost caught us
was watching
We were fine
We've got to move faster
Do you people have any other speed aside from "wander
" 'll take a shamble at this point
Hey, do you have a minute
How did the tiger fly
only share when 'm outside the log
'm funny that way
() Leave this to me
55
Eep   behind Thunk, getting him between she and her dad
(') Hey Thunk, you have a spider on your face
Eep  Thunk in the face,  him into Grug, sending Guy and the log
Grug shoots Eep an annoyed look
(') () Oops
Grug sees Guy has  away
He's loose
Grug goes to retrieve Guy, and  on something sharp
(') Aaaaahhhhhh
Do not step on those weird, pointy rocks
You mean these rocks
Ahh owww
Do not step on these rocks
Thunk steps on the coral - it  under his feet
Step aside, girls
Gran steps out, and then
Hello
Nobody's listening
No one is listening
You cannot walk on those
Guy stands on the coral without flinching
(') Arraughrragh come back here now
Well, there goes our chance for survival
And our log
Grug must make the choice to go after Guy
56
Okay
Arraugh
Grug cringes and bellows with every step
Guy still locked inside the log, hops away as fast as he can
Grug leaps out and grabs the log only to loosen it as Guy jumps to a coral patch below
Ow, ow, ow
Guy now free runs and hides behind a giant shell
He looks back at the Croods as they try in vain to cross the field and feels pity for Eep
Ow
Jumping doesn't help,  mean, just briefly, but it doesn't get better
Ow
Do not walk on your hands, the hands do not help at all
Guy looks back at the stranded Croods
Then he looks again to the tall mountain
Belt sees that Guy is having a hard time leaving the Croods
He needs to make a choice
Belt makes it for him
Eeccoomme on
Belt walks Guy back to the Croods : , ' can help you, but we're going to have to make a few changes around here
The log ride is over
Drop the log
Grug grudgingly  the log
(') Now, kick it away
Grug   it
(') Farther
Grug  it a quarter-mile
57
(') Really
Okay, smart, Guy
now what
Guy
: - Everyone is now wearing "shoes" -- some made of leaves, sponges and some are actually fish
Ugga and Gran wobble on their new shoes
Thunk is covering his eyes, too afraid to look down
Thunk looks down at his horrifying fish shoes
They blink at him
Ahhhh
Good fish
Eep is covering her eyes
Okay
Now you can look
Eep peers down at her new boots
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh
love them
Where are my feet
They're still there
Oh, okay
Eep slips, and falls into Guy's arms
Whoa
You're really ( ) heavy
Really
Thank you
Grug walks over as the two fall to the ground
58
Hey, wait
Whoa
Whoa
() Okay
She's up
'm good
We're good
These shoes are great
Where do you get these ideas
Ah ha
On cue, Belt produces a piece of chalk
Guy stands Thunk against a wall
Guy stands next to him
Belt  them
Guy excitedly gestures to the silhouettes
(') 'm calling it, a brain
'm pretty sure it's where ideas come from
Dad
don't have a brain
We've gotten along just fine without brains till now
Cavemen don't need brains
We have these
Heeya
Haha
(balls his mighty fists) That's what 'm talking about
Ideas are for weaklings
Grug punches at the air in front of Guy making him wince
(') Now, let's get to that mountain
Ugga and Eep notice each other's shoes
/ Oh wow
love those
Good fish
Don't eat my feet
: 1710 -  ' 59
The Croods run, slowly at first, then faster
And faster
The shoes make the difference
Grug encounters a bunch of Punch Monkeys again
He readies himself for a fight
Guy hands out bananas
Grug throws his banana to the ground only to slip on it
Grug sees the Macawnivore down below in the crevasse waiting for his Croods dinner
Grug sees Guy making something out of sticks
Traveling by stilts over a crevasse
The family hobbles across a canyon on their stilts
Guy helps Eep from falling
So
How'd the tiger fly
He jumped on the sun and rode it to tomorrow
Grug doesn't like seeing his daughter so close to Guy
No, no, no
The family moves across, Grug is the last to follow
Grug spies Chunky the Death Cat below him
Grug Chunky in the face with a stilt
Chunky ponders the strange sticks Grug is perched on, then  a chunk out of them
Grug  down by a yard or so
Panicking, Grug  across the chasm, losing stilt height with every  of Chunky's paw
Grug doesn't make it across -  and  sounds emanate from the canyon
(') Ooowwwww
The Croods stand at the top of a cliff
60
Grug tries to maneuver his way down the cliff by clinging to the side
Guy and the other Croods sit on a giant leaves, sledding down the side of the canyon past Grug
They pass Grug up as he continues to make his way down by tiptoeing
Grug stumbles and falls down the slope
Hi dad
Bye dad
: against the Croods to reveal    hanging like a purple curtain before them
The Croods stop dead
The rain line   on them
Grug tries to  the drops
You've seen rain before
right
We don't get out much
Guy opens an Umbrella to cover himself from the rain
Belt pulls Eep under the umbrella to be close to Guy
Hmmmmm
Belt makes an Origami boat
He and Sandy sail across the rain puddles
Grug seeing Guy and Eep snuggling under the umbrella, grabs the umbrella away from Guy
Grug gets hit by lightning
The rest of the Croods open their umbrellas to take cover as they enjoy the
The Croods stand on a tiny island in a shallow ocean - Eep is pointing at her own reflection
() Eep, looks dangerous
61
Oh dad, you say that about everything
Eep goes to jump in the water
Guy  her
Careful
Oh really
Okay
Guy
Then
Eep tentatively  in
Guy  her
Then shows her how to move her arms in a swimming motion
Guy  Eep by holding one hand under her tummy
She begins to
Gran and Ugga  mischievously - a positive vibe is building
The Croods   at once
Grug is left alone
Belt uses Grug's arm as a diving platform
Gran, Sandy and Belt are doing synchronized swimming
Then Grug sees Eep and Guy  - Eep is on Guy's shoulders
This is too much for Grug
Augh
No no no
Not cool
Not cool
Not cool
Grug   to put a stop to any potential shenanigans
Grug's huge tidal wave  Guy and Eep
Grug  to the bottom
laying on the bottom
His family  above him on the tails of Fishcats, confident and free and buoyant
lone bubble escapes Grug's nose, like oil oozing from a sunken wreck
He's feeling mighty extraneous
Grug sees the Macawnivore swimming towards him
Grug swims for his life
Ends in a big splash
: 1725 - 62
So the bear says, "Your cave
" 've been dumping my bones here since last week
Last week, haha
That's a funny story
It's not a story
It's a joke
What's a joke
You know, just making something up
to make you laugh
Hah,  don't get it
: - The Croods stand motionless before an open plain, deeply sculpted with meandering grooves which form a massive Guy is handing out  to the Croods
Here you go, one for you, and this ones for you
Thanks
Grug is annoyed by everyone blowing their shells
Okay
Okay
That's enough
don't see why the kids need their own shells
So if anyone gets in trouble, we can call the others
Wait-- you're saying we should split up
We can try more paths at once
It's the fastest way through
63
Croods stick together
(') Your way isn't safe
They can handle it
We can do it, dad
No no no no no
It's my job to keep you safe
'm still in charge and we are not splitting up
(seeing Eep and Guy together) Except for you two
And that's final
Grug  down like a silverback gorilla
Just then,
The The Croods and Guy are   into the Maze each `falling' into a separate entrance
They disappear into the rift like a penny dropped down a drain
As Grug and Guy slide passed each other
Frustrated Grug, tries to punch Guy
Oh, hello
The
Everyone (now separated) gathers themselves
-- finding himself alone
( ) Hello
Is everyone alright
(trying to calm him) We're okay, Grug
Dad
'm freaking out a little bit
Just tell me what to do
Just what do do right now
64
Stay where you are
'll find you
No
Too slow
Everybody, keep moving forward and we'll get out
Dad
( ) Yeah
Okay
Looking very frightened
(
) (') Remember never not be afraid
(
) You can do this
It's gonna be okay
'm gonna pass out
Thunk   his shell, and tentatively makes his way, alone, into his branch of the maze
(
)-- in another part of the maze
She puts her hand on the giant wall to her
and see that they are actually in parallel `channels' but with the huge wall between them
Gran and Ugga - encountering carnivorous flowers
Thunk - encountering a croco-pup
Eep - finding a flower dropped on her path
Grug - reaching a fork
Ugga and Gran don flowery camouflage
Thunk  his shell at the Crocopup,
To his surprise the Crocopup returns the shell
Thunk plays fetch with this portly beast, which shows him the way through the maze

Eep   the flower, puts it in her hair, then finds a more flowers dropped on her path
She playfully begins hunting for Guy
Guy and Belt are secretly and playfully tossing flowers in Eep's path
Grug  out of a passageway - he's back where he began
He chooses another tunnel
Ugga and Gran pass unharmed through the flower grove - the colors and smells are overpoweringly vibrant
Eep surprises Guy and Belt in their hideaway as the two of them continue to throw flowers over the edge and onto Eep's path
You dropped these
Guy slips and falls onto a huge lilypad
He smiles up at Eep
They share a moment before Eep shyly vanishes again
Grug finds himself back at the entrance of the maze
He grumbles and enters a different tunnel
- Guy appears at the exit and puts his hand up to the setting sun that kisses the top of the mountain
Guy is amazed that he and Eep are both doing the same thing
He is smitten
Guy goes over to Eep
Guy takes her hand
Come with me
Eep and Guy turn to each other, just as Thunk emerges and tosses a rock for the Croco-Pup to fetch
Here boy, catch
shell note signals Ugga, Gran and Sandy's arrival
There is an obvious change in the ladies
(') Gran
Ugga removes her hat to reveal her new look
66
Mom
() Raaah raaah
loud shell blast interrupts
It is followed by two others
Grug
Grug lets out another blow on his horn
(') 'll go get him
still stuck in the maze
He holds his head in defeat, and  the shell down
- on Grug
: 1175 - a giant redwood tree
The Croods are gathered in a cozy crook of the tree
Belt mixes drinks while Gran relaxes in a hammock
Thunk is playing with his new pet
Good boy
Whose my good boy
You need a name, you want a name
'm going to call you - Douglas
Look at him
Can you do tricks
Roll over
Come on Douglas, roll over
Douglas  , right  the tree
(') Good boy Douglas
Belt  a drink for Gran
Sandy takes Gran her drink as she spins over to her on her starfish shoes
was in love once
He was a hunter, was a gatherer
It was quite a scandal
We fed each other berries
We danced
() 67
(') Then my father smashed him with a rock and traded me to your Grandfather
// Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Ugga and Grug approach
They hear the  coming from high above
Grug peers up and sees the , torch lights
() Croods
Come get down here
Grug, they're okay
Guy's with them
Oh, oh, `Guy'
`Guy' is with them
Well thank you for bringing me that interesting Guy update
- Ugga regards her husband Oh, okay
'm gonna go up and why don't you join us when you stop being a big drag
Ugga climbs up the tree to be with the rest of the family
Grug isn't thrilled with Ugga's shot at him
He picks up two rocks and tries to make fire
Sleep pile
How about a story, huh
Anyone
Grug listens intently
All he hears is laughter
Thunk, Sandy Belt and Gran are sitting around a torch, listening to one of Gran's stories
And then Torg said "Know it
drew it
" 68
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
That makes no sense
Ugga arrives and sits next to Guy
She takes in the scene
( ) know it was hard for you to bring us along, but they had the best day of their lives
Thank you for that
distracts Guy
He looks to the horizon and  on the horizon mark the leading edge of the collapse
Eep comes to his side
want to show you something
Guy    and leads the Croods up, up, to the forest canopy
Guy   his torch
The night sky is revealed in all its glory
The Croods are amazed
Music  as the spectacle  around the Croods
Perched on the canopy of the forest the Croods seem to sit at the very brink of the universe
More suns in the sky than you can count
Every sun that crosses our sky, comes to rest up there
Tomorrow
That's where we'll be safe
at the tree top
When he sees the stars he  back down, terrified
He overhears the rest of the conversation
Eep with tears in her eyes
'm going with Guy
69
Grug is beside himself with panic, sick at the thought of losing Eep
() No
Not my little girl
Come with us
can't go without Grug
Well, that makes one of us
Count me in
Really Mom
Now
Grug continues to listen in
Grug has no idea how to protect us
In fact, he has no ideas at all
No, that's not true
What about that one time when he a
Face it
If he actually had an idea of his own 'd, 'd have a heart attack and die
Grug smiles to himself
: 1550 - - Grug
The whole family is searching for Grug
He has disappeared
70
Dad
Dad
He's a big guy
How can he just disappear like that
Hey wait
Let's ask that ugly lady if she's seen dad
Yeah
Grug
He's wearing a rasta-style wig made from knotted grass
The sight  Ugga
Haven't seen him
Augh
with the family standing around him
(') () What are you doing
(Playing to Eep) Yeah, Wow
Like,  was up all night cuz like all these, ideas just kept coming to me
Grug  his tunic, a Boa Constrictor is wrapped around his waist
Is that a snake
Belt
New and improved
It's even self- tightening
Ow
The constrictor  Grug till he turns blue
Grug it and it relaxes a little
What is that on your head
71
It's called desperation
Grug strokes his weird, fake rasta-hair
(swings his long hair around) call it a "rug
" Rhymes with Grug
And this one
call it a "ride
" Rhymes with Grug
Grug regards a boulder as if it's a Ferrari
That, doesn't-- It's gonna get us places faster than shoes
Grug climbs on top of the rock, facing the wrong way
(') Yeah
Try to keep up
He
The "car"  downhill and through a redwood,  it
wish  had a ride
His face  with reddish mud
Painting is a thing of the past
call this, a "snap-shot
" Grug takes a huge flat stone and  it against Thunk, forcibly transferring the mud image to the rock
Grug shows the Croods
Let's do it again
think  blinked
Thunk
Wearing wooden sunglasses
They are effectively wearing blindfolds
72
call them "shades
" The sun doesn't hurt my eyes anymore
Where do you get these great ideas
Since  don't have a brain, they're coming from my stomach
Down deep below, and then up again into my mind
Thunk walks into a tree
All the other Croods  their "shades" in time to see Grug walk over a cliff
Grug
We have to keep moving
See,  got ideas,  got thoughts
Grug lifting a huge flat rock over his head
(') Like this
call it a "mobile home
" Isn't that something
huge    into the opening of the rock
Grug is smashed flat
Standing on one side of a primitive Teeter-Totter
(') And 'm calling this one a "lifterator
" Mom
know
It's bad
Grug tosses a massive boulder on the opposite end
Grug is  into the sky
Grug becomes a speck in the sky
He is  by
almost feel sorry for him
73
Grug falls back down onto the teeter totter dislodging the boulder from the other side
The boulder rolls back down onto Grug
(') Hah, no  don't
: 1950 - Guy is rowing a   with everyone inside
What are you trying to do Grug
Burned and battered, laying in the bottom of a turtle shell boat
Ugga is attending to his injuries
thought if  could have ideas like Guy, maybe Eep would listen to me
Maybe she wouldn't want to go with Guy
Ugga gets a  look on her face
Oh Grug, is that what this is all about
Ugga is about to confess her thoughts of going to Tomorrow with Guy when Grug interrupts her
And  also thought it would kill your mother
So you know
Win win
We're here
The view of the mountain is beautiful
Thousands of birds fly overhead darkening the sky
The shell boat hits the shore
The Croods step out onto land
An explosion goes off on a nearby mountain
of magma  from the water in the distance
Grug looks around for shelter and spots a cave
74
Cave
Everyone inside
Come on
Hurry up, let's go
Go, go
The Croods don't want to move
No
() No more caves, Grug
What
We're gonna jump on the sun and ride it to Tomorrow with Guy
Wait, so you're all going to do this
Silence from the Croods answers his question
(') Thunk
Sorry, dad
Thunk joins the others
It's the last straw
You have to stop worrying for all of us
It's my job to worry
It's my job to follow the rules
The rules don't work out here
They kept us alive
That wasn't living, that was just, not dying
There's a difference
Ugga, everyone, you have to listen to me
Ugga doesn't move
75
We would be dead if we listened you
Grug is
(') We have to follow Guy now
Grug slowly turns around to face Guy
He is smoldering
Guy
Guy, run
Grug lunges toward Guy,
Grug  Guy - they fall down an embankment
: 2100 - Grug  Guy across a  landscape
This is pointless
We're running out of time
Everything is collapsing
You're being irrational and counterproductive
Big words anger me
Keep talking
Countermeasures
Belt  fruit at Grug
The fruit  Grug square in the face
He's blinded
He doesn't stop
(') Remember how you were this morning
You changed, remember
Idea man
Modern man
Guy comes to a sudden stop - he's stepped in a small puddle of
Grug wipes his eyes clean of fruit

a
No, no, no wait
Guy and Grug do a slow-motion  over a tar-fall
As they descend Grug  at Guy, coating himself with tar
Grug's arms are held like glue
His punches stop well short of Guy's face
Guy and Grug arrive in a wide pool of tar
They  slowly
Hnnnnnngh
No
What is this stuff that saves you from my punches
() Tar
The tone of Guy's voice
Grug  his attack
(') Please Grug
You have to stop struggling
No
have to get back to them
Grug
Stop
Grug looks to Guy
(') No one gets out of this
Believe me know
Grug gets it
Your
Family
Yeah
Sorry
Grug looks at Guy again - he needs more than that
Guy takes a deep breath - this is going to be hard
77
was little when it happened
The last thing my parents told me was, "Don't hide
Live
Follow the Sun
You'll make it to Tomorrow
" This resonates with Grug
thread of light trickles through the storm, falling just near enough to Guy he can gather it in his palm
You followed the light
My daughter is a lot like you
No
She's like you
She loves you but always forgets to say it
Just like you forget to tell her
Grug ponders this
comes over Grug
He focuses on Guy
This hits Grug hard
() guess  was just busy keeping them all alive
Guy considers Grug
It's okay
That's what Dads do
Grug smiles
He regards Guy in a different light
He sees him not as a boy but a man
Someone good enough for his little girl
That's right
but we can't do that from here
We need one of your ideas
The music
(') Come on
You can do it
Buoyed by Grug's encouragement, Guy swings into action mode
Belt
Emergency Idea Generator, activate
Belt hits Guy in the head with a rock
78
(') Ow
() 've got it
: 2250 -  & We are tracking with the
Suddenly, the big cat stops
His eyebrows raise
'  - a
- Wow
Yeah,  know
But he's doing the best with what he has
Let's go
Grug and Guy are holding bones connected to the puppet
Belt  to Guy
(') There he is
Belt,  want romance, drama, sincerity
Move me
Belt makes music, which grabs the Macawnivore's attention
(') Okay he sees us
Belt plays a little melodramatic tune
Grug halfheartedly moves the bones he's holding
(') That's our cue
Now work it
The puppet starts shaking its tail
(') He's not coming over
don't think our puppet looks scared enough
Scared
'll show you scared
Hand me those acting sticks
79
Grug shakes the puppet and makes a frightening sound of terror
Suddenly, the Macawnivore leaps forward and jumps on the puppet
He grabs it and pulls it up out of the tar, bringing Grug and Guy along with it
Grug and Guy hang on to the bones of the puppet frame
The Macawnivore shakes the puppet, pulling it out of the tar along with Grug and Guy
Hold on
The puppet breaks apart, the Macawnivcore turns to Grug and Guy
He is not pleased
Da da daaaaaa
The Macawnivore dashes towards the pair
They try to run from him
The Macawnivore's paws slip slowly backwards into the nearby tar--he's stuck
The tar snaps him back and throws him far from Grug and Guy
Belt blows a whistle signalling a field goal
Yes
You did it
Grug  Guy on the back
Grug realizes his hand is stuck to Guy's back
The Croods come running to help them
Grug
Dad
Grug and Guy  to see the rest of the Croods
Grug waves to the family with Guy stuck to his hand
Hey, we're okay
The family stops to take this in
(') Yeah, we're okay
80
The ground shakes violently
Meteors stream across the sky
(') Grug
Your call
Grug knows his answer
Take us to Tomorrow
: 2925 - -
up the gun-sight into the bright rays of the sun
Hurry
Come on
We're gonna make it
When the Croods rush toward "Tomorrow," it is a golden, ethereal image created by a perfect alignment of sun, clouds, and mountain
From the Croods  it looks as if they can cross a solid bridge of clouds and climb onto a waiting sun
You were right
There it is
The sun
We can do it
We can ride it to Tomorrow
Even Grug is taken with the sight - it's there after all
The Croods stare at the open meadow across from them
Tremors violently  the ground
(') Run
When the rift  in front of them, the hot gasses and blasts of hot ash  the clouds from beneath
The debris shades the sun, revealing a very Earthly landscape beyond
From the Croods perspective, Tomorrow vanished before their eyes
81
knocks a large chunk of rock off the edge the Croods are standing on blowing them backwards
(') don't understand
The sun was right here
It was right here
gargantuan jet of ash  at the sky
Ugga the Croods away from the ledge
She herds them back toward the gunsight
We have to go back to the cave
Hurry, hurry, stay together
Let's keep moving
Move, move
Everybody hold my hand
Thunk let's go
Go
Let's stay together
But Grug doesn't join them
Instead, Grug takes a step the precipice, peering into the curtain of ash as if trying to burn a hole straight through it
(') Grug
What's wrong with you
Grug we'll die if we stay here
Grug spies a wispy shaft of light  through the ash cloud
He   his hand to feel it
beam of light settles on his palm
Grug is
(') (softly to Grug) Grug
Listen to me
We've gotta get back to that cave
Grug looks back at his family - huddled, terrified
The picture of what he would have wanted in the beginning
The sight bothers him
Grug  to face them
No more dark
No more hiding
No more caves
(') What's the point of all this
(') To follow the light
82
smile breaks across Eep's face - her dad has answered the question
(') can't change
don't have ideas
But have my strength
And right now that's all you need
No
We don't know what's over there
Maybe nothing
It's too risky
It's a chance
Belt wipes a tear off his face
'll take that chance
Grug  Guy above his head
You know, 've wanted to throw you away ever since  met you
Heh
That's a joke, right
What's a joke
Grug's comment freaks Guy out
shows Grug with a twinkle in his eye
Belt puts on his helmet for safety
With a titanic effort, he  Guy in to the void
The Croods wait an eternity
Then - a
He made it
He made it
Okay, Thunk
Your turn
You're not coming, are you
When you make it, so will
Grug  Thunk
83
Ugga  Grug
She whispers in his ear
You did good
Daddy
Grug wipes a tear from Ugga's eye
Then lifts her above his head
He  her across
Gran
Gran is next in line
No mush, just throw me
Grug  her above his head
(') Wait
You surprised me today
Lunkhead
Grug  and throws her next
(') (landing on the other side) Still alive
Another
cliff  away
Now the distance is even greater
Eep is next in line
Time to go
No
have too much to say to you need to fix everything and  don't have time
can fix it
Grug embraces Eep
This works good
What do you call it
was thinking of calling it a Hug
(clears his throat) () 84
(') Because it rhymes with Grug
But you can change it if you want
No
like a "Hug
" love you
Eep takes in the full effect of her dad's words
The ground begins to shake and break apart around them
(') Dad, 'm scared
Never be afraid
The gap grows wider
Grug lifts Eep and makes the greatest throw of his life
The tumult parts briefly
Grug can see his entire family safe on the other side
He waves a last goodbye
To his surprise, a shaft of sunlight has settled on his open hand
There
see him
The family waves to Grug to let him know they are okay
: 2750 - Grug is startled by another earthquake
The ground is ripping itself apart as meteors begin to fall around him
Grug dodges falling debris and lighting and manages to crawl into a nearby cave-- a familiar place for him
85
Grug grabs two pieces of flint and starts clicking them together, just as Guy did earlier
They ignite
Grug has created his very first fire
() Hey,  did it
Another earthquake shakes the cavern
Grug moves over to a wall and uses some nearby mud to paint a portrait of his family
He paints each member individually and then looks longingly at the family he will never see again
The torch begins to go out
Grug blows on it and is startled by the massive Macawnivore beast, growling at him
(') Ahhhh
Back
Stay back
Stay back
The Macawnivore blows out the torch
Another meteor hits the cave with a loud boom
The Macawnivore stops growling and starts blowing on the torch along with Grug
It is just as frightened as Grug
Grug reaches out and pets the now gentle carnivorous beast
Grug and the Macawnivore huddle together in a prehistoric armistice
When suddenly, Grug hears the dim tone of Eep's "shell signal
" He rushes to the entrance to the cave
He surveys the raging  outside the cave as the world is being torn asunder
He hears the   blow
His family is in trouble
They're in trouble
Hang on
'm coming
The scale of his problem sinks in
(') How do  get across
Gotta think
What would Guy do
What would Guy do
Something occurs to Grug
86
(') What would  do
He absent-mindedly hands the torch to the Macawnivore
(') Hold this
Grug   , and
The ember of a thought    in Grug's brain

Erm
: 2975 - Grug uses a log to wipe tar all over a giant rib cage
Grug runs out of the cave and into a nearby field and startles a pack of nesting
He turns back to the Macawnivore
The meat-eating birds begin to chase Grug
Run
Grug leaps onto the Macawnivore's back as the birds move in closer
The ground begins to break up violently as lakes empty themselves and entire forests turn sideways
The Macawnivore rushes into a giant rib cage that Grug has coated with tar
The Piranha Owls hit the rib cage and stick to it
As they fight to free themselves, the rib cage lifts off the ground
Grug takes a giant tree branch, ignites it, and uses it as a rudder, scaring the Piranha Owls and prompting them to fly in one coherent direction
(') Yes
As the cage flies, above the fiery landscape, Grug sees Douglas, sitting forlornly with the shell still in his mouth
87
(') Douglas
Grug doesn't even debate it, he runs back for the little monstrosity
(') Hey,  know that guy
Grug  out of the cage and rushes over to grab the gerbils
Then Grug notices a familiar Liyote hiding under a nearby rock
He  the Liyote
Grug sees the - stranded as well
Grug  the Trip- Gerbils around his neck like a scarf
(') Get up
behind Grug - the pyroclastic flow is closer
Grug   to the lumbering blimp-cage
He it to go faster

Finally, with Grug's strength, the cage  the edge of the cliff

Behind her, Sandy
Gran puts a comforting arm around her grandchildren, even she has a tear in her eye
The ground begins to shake softly
It's not safe here

Gran walks up to Eep
Eep continues to blow her shell horn
Eep and Gran share a moment
Eep breaks into tears
Gran looks at her shell horn and  it loudly
Eep is happily surprised
The whole family, even Guy, steps up next to Eep and begins  their shell horns
It's clear from Eep's expression she has no intention of budging

Ugga appeals to Eep
Eep, if your Dad were here, he would tell -- (
) Wow, you sound just like him
Ugga looks up
Guy
Everyone looks up

He's riding the Sun

Everybody out of the way
Grug  near the family
They run to meet him

Ahhh
Where's the danger
Who blew their shell
But all Grug sees is his astonished family staring back at him
Eep  to him,  him ferociously, nearly knocking him down

The rest of the Croods begin running to Grug
Grug hugs each of them like never before
One, two, three, four, five, six
Grug puts his arm around Guy

Belt wants to be acknowledged as well
Eerrghh
And a half
All the animals join in hugging Grug

Douglas runs up and licks Thunk
Douglas
Dad you saved him
Well, a boys gotta have a pet
Suddenly the group rises up as the Macawnivore stands near them

Grug notices a  sticking out of Chunky's mouth
90
(') Uh
No
Chunky   the -
He  sheepishly
The - run to Gran knocking her over in their excitement
You really need to see this
The whole family takes this amazing view in then looks to Grug for his decision
We should go there

On Eep, fixing her hair
We   to see the whole family preparing for a family photo
(
) This is me
My name's Eep
And this, is my family
The Croods
If you weren't clued in by the sun tans and pets, we're not exactly cavemen anymore
Grug has a wonderful picture making contraption they are about to experience
The slab of rock smacks them all in the face leaving the first family photo
Let's do that again

Our world is still plenty harsh and hostile
But now we know the Croods will make it

The liyotes are tending to her
Gran sips her drink

Well, sort of
Thunk breaks through the trees riding a
