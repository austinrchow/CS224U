(
) Let's give a hand to Rodney
Scattered  and
(
) Next up, we've got a little lady named
Joyful
(
) Yeah, Kate
" " : 1
-                                      1 :   -- late-20s, pretty and wholesome and,     * oh yeah, piss drunk
She stands on a tiny in the far corner of a half-empty dive bar
Kate holds a  and dances as she  a bad karaoke version of "
" What Kate lacks in talent she more than makes up for with charm and enthusiasm
At a table near the stage is -- --  : Kate's husband, late-20's, scruffy but      * handsome, also pretty damn drunk
He enthusiastically claps and points to Kate, making up a cheering section along with -- --   -- Charlie's younger brother, early-20's --       * who sings along with -- -- the small but energetic
Kate begins to ramble between verses -- and gleefully points to Charlie and Owen
For the moment, this drunk girl is the Queen of Karaoke
2
Kate finishes the song and drunkenly tumbles off the stage to join Charlie and Owen
That was so good, baby
Bullshit
'm serious
You sing like an angel -- a drunk angel
Owen and Kate
If you were writing about my performance for your blog, what would you say
'd say that, uh
my wife is the sexiest, most amazing woman alive
That would be such a shitty article -- nobody would read it
Kate and Charlie laugh and kiss -- and then Kate glances at Owen and makes a puppy dog face
(') (to Owen) Aw
we need to find you a lady, Owen
Yeah -- 've been trying to flirt with the bartender, but
can't tell
Owen motions to the -- --  , early 20's
* She's hot
What can't you tell
She looks like she could kick my ass
No way would she go for a guy like me
3
You're being a little girl -- just go talk to her
(clearly shy) don't know
forget about it
(not going to take "no" for an answer) 'll take point -- follow me
Kate stumbles to the bar
Charlie and Owen follow
Kate puts her arms around Owen and gets the attention of the bartender
(') want to buy a gimlet for me and a double-shot of whiskey for my brother-in-law `cause he's had a hard week
`Kay
The bartender quickly pours the drinks
(') That's fifteen
Wait -- don't you wanna know what happened to him
The bartender rolls her eyes and checks around the bar to see if there are other customers
It's pretty dead -- so she listens
(unenthused) What happened
He just got back from England -- because he went there for a girl preppy, bitchy girl
Diane Court
that was her name
He loved her so much that he went with her because she had a fellowship or something
He gave up being a kickboxer
kickboxer
* (sad) And she dumped him
4
The bartender sizes up Owen
The trio waits with anticipation to hear her response, which is -- (to Owen) You kickbox
(caught in the headlights) Yeah
And
that's all Owen's got
(jumping in) And he teaches kids at the kickboxing studio
Oh, they're so cute
The bartender glances back to Owen
(finally) lot of `em don't have parents -- so
it's kinda more than just a teacher/student thing
(beat) know it sounds silly, but  feel responsible for them -- like
(emotional) could be their parent
Kate slides down the bar to Charlie
(hushed) think  got him laid
Yeah
She seems totally game
Sure she just didn't want to get into your pants
Kate rolls her eyes
think 'm done for the night
5
Yeah
Owen wanders over, dejected
* She's seen "Say Anything
" Eh, well
what're you gonna do, huh
(beat) Wanna drive us home
No -- he needs to keep working it
* You guys stay here
don't want to watch my brother not score
want to go to bed with you and
(whispered into Kate's ear) you know
'll be home when you get there
We can "you know" then
(to Charlie) Yeah, man -- you don't have a job to wake up for in the morning or anything
Writing is a job
Not having to report to an office only makes work harder
(to Kate) Baby, you drank a lot
think Owen should take us home -- you're too drunk to drive
So's Owen
(suddenly focused) 'm not that drunk
Besides, you know  focus when  drive -- it sobers me up
Tell that to the cops
6
Kate kisses Charlie and hugs Owen
(to Charlie) love you, baby
'll be waiting for you in a nice warm bed
You have exactly one mission: get your brother laid -- and don't talk to any other women
Beat
That sounds like two missions
No, it's just one
(to Owen) It kinda sounded like two, right
(nodding) It did
Kate grins and slowly backs away towards the door
(really fast) GoodbyeIloveyouboth

She glances over and sees: drunk woman -- , 30s -- sitting on the curb
She again
Kate glances around the parking lot
Nobody else but her and Freda
You okay
(quick) Yeah
Are you
(taken aback) Um
sure
7
Good
(whispers) Hey, 'm not really okay
Oh
My bitch sister just took off and left me here so she could hook up with some asshole
Now what am supposed to do
Huh
don't have a car here
guess  could
You'll give me a ride
Oh my god
Thank you
Freda gets up quickly -- and almost falls over
* was gonna say "call you a cab," `cause, you know --  don't even know you
It's not far
Please
Pretty please
Kate looks dismayed
Not sure what to do

Freda glances down at the floor and notices a
* You know, you shouldn't drink and drive
wasn't -- Just kidding
Can  have a sip

Kate's speechless
(') 'm really thirsty
It's, uh
whiskey
Fuck yeah, it's whiskey
love whiskey
You're the real thing, huh
hardcore drinking bitch like me
Freda takes a swig from Kate's flask
don't know
No
Can  smoke in your car
(slightly annoyed) Okay, fine -- go ahead
Can you just roll down the window
Of course -- 'm not uncivilized
Freda takes out a -- --   and lights it, deeply inhaling crack smoke
(in disbelief) Kate immediately pulls the car over
(') Not what  thought you meant
Want a hit
No,
is that pot
(as though it's a ridiculous question) Of course not
What do  look like
stoner
() 9
(') (beat) It's crack
Oh, shit
No
no thank you
'mon -- it's good crack
don't, um
've never smoked crack
(surprised) Really
This stuff is the truth -- and it'll sober you up
Uh
think you should go
'm not getting out in the middle of nowhere
Do you know what could happen to me all alone out here at                     * night
don't know -- people might offer you crack
Seriously
It's not a big deal -- just take a little hit
Kate and Freda stare at each other
stand-off
said no
One hit won't hurt you
It'll sober you up
Kate glances at the pipe, which Freda wiggles in front of her
(') (high-pitched cartoon voice) Smoke me
Kate
10
One puff
Then we are both going home
Freda nods
Long beat
(') Fine
Freda puts the pipe into Kate's lips and lights it
Kate sucks in crack smoke
Her eyelids flutter
You've got money, right

They pass around
Freda is passed out on a   on the sidewalk
Kate is animatedly telling a story to the two guys -- who're still smoking crack
(mile-a-minute fast) 'cause  feel like  understand what it's like to be homeless, ya know
mean, if you didn't know me, if we hadn't connected tonight, you might think: "There's some upper-middle-class,  listening, self-congratulatory, insulated, lazy liberal bitch
Probably never had to worry about anything
" But that's not true at all
grew up poor, man
Single mother
McDonald's used to have one day a week where they sold 29 cent hamburgers, and another day where they had 39 cent cheeseburgers
My mom and me would go there and she'd get twenty burgers -- that was the limit, probably set up for folks just like us -- and then she'd put `em in the freezer and we'd microwave `em for dinner throughout the week

(') was kinda overweight until high school, to be perfectly honest
Eating used to be my thing
When started drinking, though,  kinda stopped eating so much
(back on track) But anyway, the point is: You and me, we're not so different
The two guys aren't paying much attention to Kate
They're more concerned with their crack pipe

-  -                                5 Kate is asleep on the curb
She looks awful
Suddenly, Kate's eyes widen

You smell funny
What do you smell like

Near the bar

So, why didn't you come back or call me
Charlie -- (beat) -- 'm fine
Well, maybe 'm not

love you -- and you know how you get sometimes
love you too
But 'm home
It's over

Kate rubs Charlie's hair and kisses his forehead
Don't worry so much

The students

Just look at that excellent penman -- Kate stops suddenly and raises her hand to her mouth

Oh, that's really good to know
'll have to thank him

Oh, please -- they're troopers
'm sure they've seen plenty worse
(beat) So -- how long have you been pregnant
Um
it's the first trimester
Well, it's very exciting
You must be thrilled
(nods) Uh-huh
Can  ask a
personal question
Okay
How's it
(beat) going for you
Huh
The pregnancy,  mean
Kate's not sure how to respond
(') Having kids wasn't in the cards for me
came close, but
Principal Barnes drifts off into thought for a moment, then catches herself and quickly shifts gears

(') mean, it's like 've got a couple hundred kids here -- (forces a laugh) -- but
don't fool myself
It's not the same
(considers her reply) Well
it's hard to explain
Of course
wouldn't call it a burden, but -- It's a responsibility
Beat
Yeah
Exactly
(nods) You're so lucky

touch it
Um,  don't
okay -- but it sleeps a lot
Of course

a lot
Principal Barnes gets up and kneels next to Kate
She places her hand on Kate's belly and closes her eyes

Can you hear me
You're a tiny miracle
Did you know that

-  -                        16 Kate walks down the hall and comes to the door of her classroom
Through the glass she sees -- -- Mr
Davies
He notices Kate and smiles (the concerned smile you give someone right after they've publicly embarrassed themselves)
Kate mouths the words -- (silent) Thank you
-- and gestures "come here
" Mr
Davies gestures   to the class that he'll be right back -- before he walks out   to talk to Kate
He's got a slightly nervous demeanor --   somewhere between " never became comfortable talking   to women" and Asperger's
Is everything, um
okay, Mrs
Hannah
Yeah, well
'm really embarrassed -- but  feel a lot better
And just wanted to say thank you
Mr
Davies glances down the hall
Look -- 'm not a fool
(whispered) know you were drinking this morning
Kate looks shocked
(') saw you
(taken aback) Oh, no,
Drinking when you're pregnant is really dangerous
21
know that
Oh, God,
(long beat) listen -- 'm not actually pregnant
What
'm just really hung over
The kids started asking me questions after vomited and  panicked
Oh
That's
not good
know
please don't say anything
Mr
Davies looks torn, unsure how to respond
Just
go home
Get some sleep
Before Kate can say a word, Mr
Davies heads back into the classroom

It's a bit early to be drinking, but hey -- why not
had such a crappy morning
Me too
spent like three hours at the post office trying to buy stamps and stuff
Kate takes a long sip of beer

told my class  was pregnant
Charlie looks up at Kate with a beaming smile
He leans over and grabs her hand
(excited and sort of confused) Oh, baby, that's -- 'm not
Pregnant
So don't worry
(deflated) Oh
(beat) `Cause it would be great news -- if it was true
(beat) `Course then 'd have to drink your beer
Well, it was a lie
just lied to my class
After barfing in front of them
(cringes) Ooh
Yeah, that's what they said
(long beat) Listen
can't do this anymore
look of complete terror and confusion passes over Charlie's face
What do you mean
dunno
think  might
drink too much
Charlie
Oh
That
Yeah
you kinda do
Charlie swigs his beer
23
know  do -- 'm a fucking mess
Baby -- that's not true
You're beautiful
And brilliant
And love you
wouldn't be married to a "mess
" left work after puking in front           * of little kids
And
now 'm               * drinking in the middle of the day
* Well, those things happen sometimes
(beat) mean, they shouldn't happen all the time, but
it's the price of, uh, truly living life
Isn't that like a slogan for some kind of beer or toothpaste or something
No
And it's true -- you and me, we're not just some boring couple in the suburbs who don't sleep with each other and have nothing to talk about except whatever  show they're currently into
(beat) We, like
still know how to party
Yeah
(beat) think  need to slow down
(beat) And  might need help
'll help you
know, but
might need more help
Yeah
Like a therapist
24
don't know --  just get stupid when 'm drunk, and 'm drunk a lot
We just like to have a good time
Yeah, well
(beat) you've gotta promise not to tell this to anyone
(curious) promise
That includes Owen
Of course
Well, last night  kinda, um
(hushed) smoked some crack
Some bar patrons glance at Kate and Charlie
After  left the bar, , uh, picked up this drunk girl and
don't really remember what came next, but ended up smoking crack with her
(confused) Uh
how's that even happen
(beat) You give someone a ride and she rewards you with crack
Well
she seemed desperate
She really needed a ride home
Where
25
Downtown
think she maybe lives in
a tent
What
Well
she might be homeless
Or a prostitute
Or just some lost sorority girl
(thinks about it) To be honest, 'm not sure
(disgusted) Oh, my god
you smoked crack with some random stranger
Did you
share a pipe
Kate doesn't answer
She doesn't need to
(') Ughhh
(beat) Just playing Devil's advocate, but maybe it's the crack-smoking you need help with and not the drinking
Kate gives Charlie a dirty look
(') 'm just saying
The drinking led to the crack- smoking
The drinking leads to everything stupid  do
(beat) mean
can you even remember the last time we had sober sex
Charlie begins to answer, but then
goes blank
He tries to remember
And can't
We'll chill out with the booze for a while
We can just be wine-with-                   * dinner people
(beat) How's that sound

-                                             19 Kate and Charlie joyfully ride  home from the bar
Maybe you should go to, uh
one of those meetings
They have `em over there
Charlie gestures to a (could be a church or different type of building where  meets)
Kate
Yeah, right
Remember when  was shit-faced and took that  &  pamphlet from there
(laughs) Holy shit
And we answered "yes" to like every question and at the end it was like, "If you answered `yes' to any of these you're an alcoholic
" Yeah
(nostalgic) that was fun, wasn't it
Kate smiles and nods
(') Hey -- Charlie gestures to the street
(') -- look out for that crack
Kate looks down but sees nothing
What crack
27
Oh, sorry --  thought there was a crack there
(grins) but you must have smoked it last night
Kate rolls her eyes -- and then jokingly swerves towards Charlie, trying to knock him over
He  and speeds away
Kate chases after him

"Have you missed days of work or school because of drinking
" Absolutely
"Do you envy people who can drink without getting into trouble
" Envy isn't exactly the right word
"Do you have `blackouts'
" Yeah, but who doesn't
"Has your drinking caused trouble at home
" No
We're great
Yeah
Definitely
But we still had a lot of "yes" answers
(refers to pamphlet) Yep
we still qualify as drunks
28
'm gonna go
(disbelief) Yeah, right
No -- 'm serious
'm gonna go
What time is it
Eight
Kate gets up
See ya
(doesn't believe her) Uh-huh
Kate takes a big sip of wine
(quite serious) This is me: going
Charlie  -- he doesn't buy it
You've been boozing
So
You should come too

Yeah, right
You can't go to wasted

Oh, yeah
Watch me

An   stands at the podium sharing her story

The room is filled with -- -- different groups of , all of whom sit with their "own group," like a high school lunch room -- but the people are adults
There are distinct groups of -- -- " " -- -- "  " -- -- "" -- -- and "
" As Kate -- who's slightly confused -- enters the building, a hip looking man -- , 30's -- stops her, extending his hand
(whispers) Hey, 'm Donovan
Welcome
Hi Donovan -- 'm Kate
Donovan "shushes" Kate
You must be a newcomer, huh
what
(whispers) Um, 'm not really allowed to talk to new chicks, but there are lots of women here who can help you out
(confused) Okay
(beat) Do  just sit wherever
The meeting already started so just try to find a spot anywhere
Kate drunkenly stumbles to the back of the room, saying things like "sorry" and " like that jacket" as she takes a seat next to two very
30
As the woman at the podium continues to speak, the women next to Kate quietly try to welcome her
* Are you new
To this
Yeah
Why's everyone whispering
* It's hard, huh
guess
* Everything's going to be fine
You're home
Kate doesn't respond -- just looks around with the fear anyone would have if they felt they had just accidentally joined Jim Jones' church
The room is   -- with over -
The tattooed man stands at the podium
Not to embarrass anyone, but so that we may get to know you better - - is there anybody here in their first thirty days of recovery
Several  scattered throughout the room stand up and introduce themselves as alcoholics
Kate stands up
'm Kate
'm
guess 'm a little drunk right now
People burst into
(') Do you want me to talk about my childhood or something
31
(painfully polite) You know, Kate, we actually ask that you don't share if you've had                  * a drink or any mind-altering substance in the past 24 hours
(not listening) can --  kinda hate my dad and don't talk to him
And my mom
oh, man
don't even know where to start
She's, like, stuck in the 80's and kind of a metalhead
Her last boyfriend called himself a drummer but really just gave drum lessons to little kids and -- (tries to shut Kate up) Welcome, Kate
(forces a smile) It gets better
(not picking up the hint) like drinking is the thing mean,  don't want to say you guys are wrong or anything
Kate nervously
Some of the  in the crowd look embarrassed for Kate
Thank you -- we're all here to help
We do have to move on, though
The woman next to Kate gets her to sit back down
* Don't worry, sweetie -- there'll be plenty of time to tell your story
young woman -- , 22 -- approaches the podium
Hey, 'm Amber, alcoholic
can't really believe that it's been five years
mean, my life was a mess back then
Now 'm back in school, have an amazing man,  love my parents -- it's crazy
32
(way too loud) How old is that girl
Can she even go to bars
(to Amber) How old are you, Amber
* Be respectful
Kate seems surprised at being chastised
(gaining intensity) Um
okay
It's because  did the work
got down on my knees and prayed every night
went to a meeting everyday
Everyday
It wasn't easy, but 've gotta say, owe everything to
Well,  -- and God, of course
The whole room
Everyone is standing, holding hands, and saying the God grant me the serenity to accept the things  cannot change -- courage to change the things  can - - and wisdom to know the difference
Everyone turns and looks at Kate
(') (embarrassed) Okay
think 'm good
Kate quickly leaves the meeting as clumsily as she arrived

So much for that
Kate and Charlie stand in their backyard, which is criss- crossed by    and has some old They drunkenly play
* Was it a bunch of old biker guys
No, it was

Enthusiastic people

Yuck --  hate enthusiasm
'm sorry it wasn't cool
Charlie thinks for a moment
(') can't really imagine never drinking
guess  don't have to, though -- (beat) -- you're the one with the problem
Kate nods in agreement
* (') Hey --  love you
don't want you to have to drink
don't have to drink
(beat) just really like to drink
* (sincere) Good -- `cause you're my favorite person to drink with in the whole damn world
Charlie leans in to kiss Kate
They make out for a moment, and then Kate
34
Charlie's lip
Charlie pulls back, shocked
Kate grins mischievously
(') Oh, no you didn't
Charlie lunges at Kate, who dodges him and
Charlie dives and playfully tackles Kate
They begin to wrestle in the grass -- it's cute and loving but perhaps a little too intense
23
& '  -  -                 23 Kate and Charlie are making out on the bed
Kate starts to unbutton Charlie's shirt
As it turns out, Charlie's extremely drunk (and it's apparent in his movements and voice)
Are you trying to have some sex
Kate removes Charlie's pants and takes off her clothing
She climbs on top of him and -- -- they start having sloppy, drunk sex
After a few beats, Kate notices that Charlie isn't moving
She looks down to discover that -- -- he's passed out
Kate pauses for a moment
then continues to ride her unconscious husband
24
& '  -  -                 24 Kate drinks what's left in the   as she drunkenly searches the fridge, counter, and cupboard for more booze
She finds a few sips here and there at the bottom of a couple   -- but she seems frustrated that there isn't more alcohol in the house
Kate puts on her slippers, robe and -- 25
-                                           25 Kate drunkenly rides a  down the street (still in her robe and slippers)

26
-                                26 Kate tries to open the  glass fridge where the  is kept
After several attempts, she gives up and grabs from a shelf
Kate sets the bottles on the counter
* The  -- a tired looking man in his 30's -- looks at Kate with pity
You know  can't sell you this, Kate
An   -- shopping for frozen food -- glances over at Kate
* What
You can't tell 'm 21
Come on -- 'm in here all the time
You know me
Yes,  do, Kate
And  know you're old enough -- but it's too late
The clerk holds up his  (which reads 2:45)
'mon -- we can just pretend it's before two
Kate reaches down and tries to rewind the clerk's watch
(not amused) Stop it
It's just a little wine
'm not driving or anything
don't think so
Sorry
Kate gives him a big, flirty smile
Come on, dude -- 'll let you have a sip if you want
Kate tries to do a "sexy" dance

It's the law

You know that
Why don't you give it to me, then
That wouldn't hurt anything
gift -- because we're friends
could lose my job
Kate doesn't have anything to say back -- so she glances at the Elderly Man in the frozen food section
* (to the elderly man; meant to be a whisper, but way too loud) You distract him, okay
The elderly man puts up his hands, not wanting any part of it
Look -- why don't you get a bottle of water or a coffee or something instead
Water or coffee
Fuck you
What -- just cause  won't suck your dick
(had enough) Oh my god
Okay, enough -- you gotta go
Kate doesn't budge
(') Seriously, Kate
You should go
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Kate is hysterical and her eyes are starting to fill with tears
(') This is bullshit
(beat) have to pee
37
Kate runs down the aisle and tries to open the bathroom door - - but it's locked
She hides from view, and then squats down and begins to pull up her robe
What the fuck are you doing
(caught) didn't mean to
Sometimes  just have to pee really, really bad
* (frustrated) Get outta here
(pleads) 'mon
can't we drink together
The clerk clearly isn't going to budge
Kate nods, resigned, and then
grabs a    and dashes out the door
27
-                                        27 Kate is passed out on the concrete bank of the Los Angeles River
The empty bottle of (screw top) wine is next to her
Kate's bicycle lays in some weeds nearby

Kate slowly wakes up, confused, and in a zombie-like state she gets up and trudges home, wheeling along her bike
28
& '  -  -               28 Kate is awakened by the deafeningly loud   and the sound of a news radio
She looks at the clock and realizes that -- -- it's 7:30
She jumps out of bed in a panic
Charlie
Kate pauses when she realizes her back is wet
She looks down at the bed, which is -- 38
--
(') (mumbled) Not again
Half-asleep, Charlie rolls over onto the pee-soaked part of the bed
Come back to bed, baby
have to go to work
You snoozed my alarm again
'm gonna be late
Well, you peed on me so  guess                     * we're even
* have a weak bladder
Well
can't go to work like this
You work from our kitchen
Yeah, but changing the sheets is my real job
(beat) Hey -- where were you last night
Huh
woke up at like 4 a
m
and you were gone
Where would  go at 4 a
m
alone
You must've been dreaming
Kate then glances down and notices -- -- that
She pauses, slightly alarmed, but continues getting ready
39

-  -  -            29 Kate's on her knees, puking into a toilet
Kate exits the stall to find -- -- Principal Barnes standing by the door
can only imagine the chemistry experiment that's going on -- Barnes points at Kate's stomach
(') (smiles) -- in there
30

Are you gonna have a boy or a girl
don't know yet
* When will you know
Not until summertime
You guys will be on vacation
If you have a boy what will you name him
Maybe
Woodrow Wilson
That's a name for a man -- not a baby
40
The children
Kate  too -- but looks a little freaked out
31
- '  -         31 Kate eats her   with Mr
Davies
Thanks again for covering for me
can't promise to cover for you every time you get pregnant
There won't be another time
genuinely hope not
Look -- didn't tell Barnes, but if anything like this happens again 'll have to
Mr
Davies smiles -- a sweet, genuine smile
(') Okay
Kate
(nodding) Okay
(not sure what to say) David
Beat
Dave
Kate tries to hold back a smile
(') know -- Dave Davies
yup
hah- hah
Anyway, uh, is everything okay with you
don't know
(beat) Um
no
() 41
(') puked in front of my class and then told everyone 'm pregnant
That's not really okay, huh
No,  don't think so
went to  last night
(slightly uncomfortable) Oh, yeah
What'd you think of it
It was awful
kept getting shushed
don't normally tell people  work with this
but -- Mr
Davies takes a  that says "Nine Years" out of his pocket and shows it to Kate
(') -- 'm a bit of an expert when it comes to these things
(shocked) You
Yeah, me
've lived a strange one
* 'm nine years sober,  and
(beat) used to drink cocaine
(off Kate's shocked expression) It's really cheap in the Philippines
Mr
Davies takes a beat to think about what he's saying
(') Listen, Kate
know meetings can be weird
Especially at first, but if you want to
you never need to feel like you have to
but the ones  go to are pretty small
Nice little groups
(beat) 'd be happy to take you
42
Maybe that would be good
don't know
No pressure, okay
That shit saved my life, though
Principal Barnes walks in
(') (switching gears) Well, 'm scheduled to observe Ms
Carol's art class
They're making macaroni art, so
'm pretty stoked
Mr
Davies gets up to leave -- discretely winking at Kate as he exits
Principal Barnes watches Mr
Davies leave, a puzzled expression on her face
(to Kate) Mrs
Hannah -- 've got something for you
Principal Barnes opens the   to reveal a huge jug of
(') Folic Acid
You need it now like never before
(beat) Thanks
bet your mother is over the moon, huh
Probably planning you a baby shower
Oh, well
she and  aren't that close
Oh, 'm sorry
Well, listen -- any motherly thing you need -- 'm                       * here, okay
Barnes hands Kate a large glass of juice
43
(') Now drink up -- that baby in there's thirsty
Okay
(takes a sip of orange juice) And
you're kinda the only person at school -- besides Mr
Davies -- who knows 'm pregnant
Could you
My lips are -- Principal Barnes mimes "zipping" her lips

next to him
An old record  on the record player
Hey
Howdy
Kate collapses on the couch next to Charlie and kisses him
How was your day
And what's that smell
Eh -- alright
Couldn't find oatmeal so  made ketchup soup
(cringes) Charlie
You need to eat
What
It's tasty
(beat) So
'm going to see that band                      * from Iceland with the triplets play                  * tonight
Want to come with me and Owen to check it out
44
Oh, that sounds fun, but
'mon -- Owen can't pick up girls without you
don't know
this guy  work with -- Mr
Davies -- The Vice Principal
Yeah -- turns out he's sober and invited me to a meeting
(surprised) Wow, that's
uh, cool
Charlie goes silent
What
Nothing --  just
didn't think you really loved the meeting you went to yesterday
In fact, it sounded like you hated it
So 'm kinda surprised you're going back
Well
this is a smaller meeting
It might be different
dunno -- think  want to give it a fair shot
Charlie nods
(') Besides --  was hammered last night
(beat) Go on and have fun out drinking with Owen tonight
Seriously
'm just gonna, you know, try something         * different
Charlie pulls Kate close to him
45
'm here for you, okay
Even though drink --  could slow down if you need me to
(forces a smile) 'm sure  could

-    -                        33 Kate approaches a small church
Mr
Davies waits outside
35
-    -  - 35 Mr
Davies walks Kate into a medium sized room where -- -- about   are getting coffee, talking, and setting Kate looks around the room, scoping out the people, who're very different from the crowd at the previous night's meeting -- -- several    -- -- : 40-ish, with dark hair and a confident, sort of        * tough demeanor -- -- a few  , and a
Mr
Davies directs Kate over to a table with  and This is a little more my speed
No one here is the slightest bit hip
Does everybody just
kinda, you know -- talk here
Pretty much
Someone leads -- tells their story
And then everyone else shares -- talks
So since you're taking me here does that make you my sponsor
46
No --  don't think  could do                     * that
(off Kate's expression) `Cause, um
(nervously searches) well, it could get weird
But                   * 'll help you find one if you want
(gestures to the seats) We should sit down
Kate looks around the room at everyone taking their seats
(takes a deep breath; to Mr
Davies) can't believe 'm really here
It gets better
Weirder, maybe -- but better
The meeting has begun and everyone sits in a circle of chairs
Jenny is midway through her speech
* * all  knew about taking care of myself was fucking people over and lying to get by
had no idea how to even look for a normal job or pay my bills on time -- or pay my fucking bills at all
(beat) Now  pay my bills online
The group
(')                           * And  found a love in cooking
've                * got my own catering business now
* And
maybe  just replaced alcohol with chocolate chips and cigarettes, but still
it's been years since  woke up in a park -- in a different state
Kate leans in towards Mr
Davies and whispers -- 47
kinda like her
Sponsor potential
Kate nods
(') Get her number at break
feel like you're my wingman
Kate grins at Mr
Davies, who smiles shyly and glances away
An older man --  -- stands and announces
* Arlo, Alcoholic
There'll now be a ten minute break
Smoke em' if you got em
As some of the  go outside -- -- Kate walks over to Jenny, who's getting a cup of coffee
* Hey,  liked your speech
* Thanks
All that dumb shit happened so 'm glad that now it's at least entertaining
(beat) What's your name
Kate
This is my first meeting
Or
first meeting where 'm not wasted
Jenny
* * Oh, yeah --  remember doing some of that
don't really know how this stuff works
() 48
(') But
could  get your number mean,  may not need it, but
* Yeah, of course
can help explain it to you -- and also, we can just talk
Okay
Yeah
(beat) You've been sober since you were 24
Jenny nods
* (') That seems really young
* didn't have much of a choice -- crashed my car into a nursing home
(beat) think the break is just about over
This meeting is the kind where everyone can share
Sharing always helps me, so
if it's not too weird -- try introducing yourself and telling the group what's going on
Everyone is sitting down and sharing
The woman () next   * to Kate is finishing up
* anyway, that's where 'm at today
Thanks for listening
Everyone looks at Kate
Okay, um
hello
'm Kate and
(long beat) 'm an alcoholic
Kate nervously
Hi, Kate
49
Sorry
don't mean to laugh -- it's just saying those words
(beat) think 'm an alcoholic, but don't really know
drink -- a lot
've always drank
Everyone know drinks a lot
never really thought  had a problem -- lately though it seems like maybe  do just want to be able to drink a beer without it turning into twenty -- or wetting my bed
(beat) It seems like every time  drink something awful happens
All the shit that  used to laugh off isn't really funny anymore
The dumb drunk stuff has gone from embarrassing to scary
(beat) 'm kinda
scared
Kate stops
Looks around self-consciously
: short, quick scenes: 35
-  -                       35 Kate sits at her desk grading papers
Kate's hand has an uncontrollable tremble as she tries to carefully make red checks on students' papers

Is there anyone here who has ninety days of continuous sobriety
Kate stands up -- she looks way more "together" than she did earlier
She gives Mr
Davies a hug -- and he hands her a "90 " 'm Kate
'm an alcoholic
Everyone
Hi, Kate
Kate sits down next to Jenny and gives her a hug

Davies, and several other  from

kinda can't believe it's been ninety days
(beat) The longest 've gone since high school without drinking was, like, a week
My first three months were such hell
think 'm only sober today because  just never want to go through that again
52
It's weird -- in after-school specials the getting-sober part was only like a minute of the movie and suddenly
daddy's all okay
Several people
(') But it's so fucking hard and weird and suddenly  have all these other problems now that drinking isn't the problem
* Like what
* Everything else
Work, my non- existent relationship with my mom
* When was the last time you saw her
(tries to remember) year, at least
* Well
maybe it's time
Maybe
(beat) And then there's my marriage mean, Charlie's great
Really great, he's supportive, especially at first
It's strange, though feel like alcohol was the thing that connected us and now that don't drink we lead these two very different lives
(beat) We haven't slept together in forever
(laughs) haven't pissed myself in awhile, though
So that's good
* It takes time
Kate gives an exasperated look
53
(')                    * (half-stern cheerleader tone) Keep working the steps
(glances at her watch) Let's grab coffee tomorrow, okay should actually run you home now and come back
need to start locking up
could stick around and help you
(to Kate) could take you home

'  -                  44   * Mr
Davies pulls up to Kate's house
My ex-wife -- she doesn't drink -- well, not like us, but as soon as got sober  started to change and she just
didn't
didn't know you were married
Beat
Yeah,  was married once -- (laughs) -- in my other life
But shouldn't be talking to you about this stuff
Why
don't know
Because you're a dude we can't talk
don't get that "men stick with men, women stick with women" stuff
54
Well, if you were sitting where 'm sitting you'd understand
Are you trying to tell me that you have a crush on me
What am , one of your students
* Crush
Yeah, crush
(long beat) kind of do, yes
have a crush on you
know that's wrong -- you're newly sober and married and shouldn't be thinking about you like that
But yeah,  should put that out on the table
(beat) Honesty
It's okay
think you're a really good guy
Oh, great -- good guys are the nerds that carry the pretty girls' books
Oh, c'mon
think you're beautiful
Kate smiles bashfully
(') And smart, and sexy, and cool
Mr
Davies moves slightly closer to Kate
(') And  know it's wrong, but -- in meetings  stare at your lips and your legs and all  can think about is fucking your moist pussy
55
Kate jumps back, aghast
(') (off Kate's horrified expression) Oh, crap
don't know why  just said that
'm really, really sorry
(genuinely sorry) Oh, that was a bad thing to say, right
'm so, so sorry
'm just confused, and  don't know how to talk to women -- Jesus -- you can't just go around telling people you want to fuck their "moist pussy
" (beat) Who even says that
'm really sorry
Kate gets out of the car, slams the door shut, then leans in to say -- have to go inside my house -- where  live with my husband
(beat) Thanks for your creepy version of honesty
45

You okay
56
(from under the covers) Yep -- 'm just pacing myself
The tortoise wins the race
Actually, 'm not really in the mood
* But  wanted to give you a 90 days gift
It's okay -- the 90 days was the gift
Sorry if  was doing a bad job -- 'm kinda hammered
It's alright
Charlie
(long beat) miss you
Huh
* Charlie comes up from under the covers -- and looks a bit     * tipsy
* mean
don't know
don't really feel connected to you anymore
Did  do something
No
(beat) We don't talk that much
We used to talk, but now you come home and go to meetings and by the time you get back 'm -- Kinda drunk
57
was gonna say "tired
" Silence
There's some stuff  need to do this weekend
think 'm gonna go up to Lake Arrowhead
Really
To see your mom
Kate nods
(') Why
(defensive) Do  need a reason
With your mom
Kinda
(beat) Is this the "amends" step
No
Well then why're you going
(beat) We send her checks
But we never actually see her
Sometimes it feels like 'm paying her to not be in my life
thought it would be nice to visit her
(beat) And Jenny thinks it would be a good         * idea
Charlie
(') What
don't know
mean, do you do everything your sponsor tells you to do
58
No
Do you think 'm brainwashed or something
dunno
it's been a long damn time since you've seen your mom
(beat) And you didn't listen when suggested we visit her
(suddenly gets that it's an ego thing for Charlie) Oh, baby --  listen to you
This just
it felt like the right time
(beat) With all the changes 'm going through
Well, can  come with you
It'll be like a little vacation
Um
think  should go alone
Come on, if you do that you'll just get depressed
If  go we can try to make it fun
Go hiking and stuff
Well, if you go, don't take this the wrong way but -- 'd like it if maybe you didn't drink
(beat) Just while we're there
(smiles) think  can handle not drinking for like a day

You're fine
Something, you know
Flowers, or
Wine
No
Definitely not that
They get to the door
Charlie looks at Kate -- who seems like she'd be okay if they ran back to the car
60

Charlie
(
) 'minute
(under her breath) Oh, God
The door opens, revealing -- -- : late-50's, wears an old shredded heavy metal band -shirt and tight ripped-up jeans, looks like she enjoys an afternoon drink or three

Rochelle wraps her arms around Kate
(') What're you doing here
left you a message, mom
Oh, you know  don't check that thing
(notices Charlie; slightly flirty) Hello there, young man
Hi, Ms
Foster
Well, then

Hell has frozen over

Come inside -- let me fix you both some drinks
Just water for me

Too much furniture thrown together in a chaotic manner
The walls are covered with framed     -- and there are  everywhere, filled to the brim with cigarette butts

Baker passed away and the kids put Mrs
Baker in a home, the people that moved in, oof

Rochelle hands Charlie a glass and then goes to Kate and puts a drink on the table in front of her

That's pretty wild, mom
Right
(notices that Kate hasn't touched her drink) What's wrong, honey
Think  forgot how to mix `em
told you  just wanted water
62
Oh, please
Where 'm from, "no" means "yes
" (to Charlie) Am  right or am  right
(forcing it) Huh-huh
That's actually why  wanted to come up, mom
(beat) stopped drinking
Rochelle  -- then realizes Kate and Charlie aren't joking
(quickly serious) Are you telling me 'm going to be a grandma
Rochelle tears up with joy
(') Oh -- that's so exciting
'm gonna be a grandma
(to Charlie) And you know that "no drinking when you're pregnant" thing is just a myth
drank plenty when  was pregnant with Kate -- and look how she turned out
Beat
'm not pregnant, mom
Oh
just needed a break
'm sober for the first time in years
Well
(dismissive) we'll see how long that lasts

It's been a while, actually
(chimes in) 90 days
(to Kate) You've sure picked the right partner -- (gestures to Charlie) -- for this little mission
(defensive) Hey -- 'm not drinking either
today
(to Charlie; slightly annoyed) Drink if you want to, Charlie
(to Rochelle) Charlie didn't stop drinking
'm doing it by myself
(beat) And
started going to 12-step meetings
Rochelle looks slightly disgusted
Ah
yes
Assholes Anonymous
(to Charlie) Katie's father went to those meetings a few years after we got married
Dried up
Left me
You can see how well that worked out for me
(Rochelle gestures to her living room) raised his daughter in this while he's somewhere in Florida with his shiny new wife and kids
(beat) Bastard
(long beat; to Charlie) You better be careful -- they change
Kate and Charlie exchange a glance
64
thought you'd be happy for me, mom
Oh
'm sorry -- 'm not being a good hostess, am
Rochelle gets up, takes the drink away from Kate, and chugs it
(') 'll microwave you your favorite
Charlie, Kate, and Rochelle watch a    -- while eating
* Rochelle rests her head on Kate's shoulder
(') 'm sorry if  acted like a bitch
It's okay, mom
know you can't help it

) in the middle of the woods
Creepy and nostalgic at the same time
Looks like the set of a Christmas horror film
Kate holds Charlie's hand as she leads him around
This place shut down a decade ago and then there was a fire and now it's basically abandoned
Charlie seems totally impressed by the weirdness of the place
(') We came here every year the week before Christmas
() 65
(') And then  worked here in high school -- selling hot chocolate
And they had real reindeer, too
They kept `em over there
Kate points at the remains of a
(') My mom worked here when she was younger
think everyone who grew                  * up around here worked at Santa's Village at some point
Charlie just nods and listens -- he's in awe of this place
(') This is what  think of when think of Christmas
(long beat) Thanks for coming up here with me
Of course
'm sorry my mom's so awful
(shrugs) She just can't handle her liquor
Kate and Charlie look in each other's eyes
Seem to have a moment
And then Charlie asks -- (') Did you ever hook up with guys when you worked here
Huh
You know -- sneak off with a co- worker and do it against a pine tree or something
Um
no
66
mean, if  were a teenage boy working with a stone cold fox like you 'd totally want to hook up with you here
Like
in the ginger bread house
Charlie puts his arms around Kate
(') You were probably the coolest girl in town -- and the prettiest
'm sure everyone was in love with you
Kate giggles
They kiss
It's sweet

Davies -- standing in the room, which has been decked out for a -- --
couldn't keep quiet
Sorry just had to tell everyone so we could celebrate
(shock) Oh
you shouldn't have
You don't have to thank me -- just open your presents
Kate looks at her desk which is stacked with  wrapped in pink and baby blue wrapping paper
There's also a
Wow
Go ahead
67
`'mon, Kate
You're gonna love what  got you
Is it a boy or a girl
Kate opens a present -- a
(seems nauseous) Oh, it's so
nice
(enthusiastic) It's to hang over the crib
Uh-huh
: Kate opens presents while the teachers
Eventually, Kate begins to  -- which everyone assumes are tears of joy
Principal Barnes takes a bite of cake
Mmmm
it's so moist
Kate glances at Mr
Davies, who cringes
54
-   -                   54 Kate walks to her car
(
) Kate
Kate looks back to see Mr
Davies running over -- but she doesn't reply or slow down
(') Kate
(stops) What
Listen --  am so, so sorry
You have no idea how much this has been eating me up
68
Long beat
What you said to me was really fucked up
know
What were you even thinking
wasn't --  was just
try to be really honest
get that
But you can't force your "honesty" on everyone you know
Mr
Davies nods
He looks really embarrassed
(') (changing tone) 'm flattered that you have
feelings for me
am
But 'm married
know
'm sorry
'll apologize to your husband if you want
No -- you don't have to do that didn't even tell him
But
you can't say that to a girl -- like, ever
Okay
Seriously
Consider that a rule of thumb
(beat) Someday, you're gonna meet a nice, available lady -- but if you say "moist pussy" to her, you will never, ever, ever get to see that part of her body
69
(even more embarrassed) Okay
(beat) Thank you
(nods) feel like this was a really good talk
Kate forces a smile

Hey, Kate

kinda thought we'd all eat           * it together

'm sorry
* * It was really good
* * We have plenty of tequila to make            * up for the cake
* * Kate's in  -- so she can't drink
* She hasn't drank in forever -- like          * thirty-eight days or some shit
* * Ninety-five days, actually
* * That sucks
Do you still smoke               * weed
* * No,  wasn't a big weed smoker               * anyway
* * You smoked crack though, didn't              * you

She stares at Charlie

'm joking around

He's drunk
really drunk
'm not mad at him -- 'm mad at you
You said you wouldn't tell anyone about what  did
'm
sorry
was drunk too when told him
Great
(beat) Why don't you guys just go to the bar now
You wanna come
'm hanging here
'm sure they have near-beer, baby
It'll be fun
'm staying in

That sounds like a lot of fun
Bye

love you
Kate doesn't say a word

Yeah
(long beat) love you too

-  -                  58 Kate stands at the  -- teaching addition and subtraction to the class
little girl --  -- raises her hand
* Yes
* Mrs
Hannah -- shouldn't you be more fatter
What
* `Cause of the baby
My mom got real fat
(taken off-guard) Well
"Shouldn't you be fatter
" is the correct way to ask that question
Kate goes back to the board -- clearly wanting to move on
73
(') Now, one day when you're very old and wise fourth graders, you'll learn about multiplication and -- * Mrs
Hannah -- Shouldn't you be more fat
All the students look at Kate
She's on the spot
Flustered
Well,
Kate searches for something to say
Anything
But then she blurts -- (') 'm not going to have a baby
Kate immediately looks like she wishes she could take it back
See --  was pregnant but, it wasn't my time,  suppose
Another little girl --  -- jumps in
* * Mrs
Hannah -- did you kill the baby
No -- of course not
* `Cause my mom says that when you kill a baby you go to hell and you can't even go to church to ask god for forgiveness
The students begin to  to each other
Another boy --  -- asks -- Mrs
Hannah -- are you going to hell
74
No
didn't kill my baby
Okay, listen kids -- we shouldn't be talking about this
But
(beat) sometimes women get pregnant and then early on -- before it's even a baby -- they stop being pregnant
* Because a doctor murders it
No -- not because a doctor   murdered it
(beat) It's called a miscarriage
That means it wasn't my plan --   it's just what happened
(composes herself) Does anyone want to ask me   any questions
The class nods but seems silently freaked out
(') Let's get back to subtraction -- or addition
Or both
59
- '  -         59 Kate sits with Mr
Davies eating lunch
Well, that was bound to happen at some point
Kids notice things like that
Kate nods
(') But  had no idea how pro-life little Winnie Reddy is
* (beat) Remind me to wear my "May the fetus you save be gay" -shirt to the next banana split night
Kate half-laughs
75
(') And just think: the kids got a lesson about life and death that nobody planned on
mean, you're years ahead of the standard curriculum for, uh, third graders
Does it matter that  lied
That was never pregnant
You want me to answer that as a friend or as someone who takes the twelve steps very seriously
Kate shrugs
(') Well, the good thing is that it's all over now
Principal Barnes will think you're a martyr for losing a baby
(beat) The kids won't ask about it anymore and as long as you don't toss your cookies again you won't have to deal with it
(long beat) And the bad news
You lied
To your boss -- and a bunch of small children
Who trust you
And rely on you to help them differentiate right from wrong
(slowly nods) That's all, huh
60
& '  -  /          60   * // -                                    * Kate and Charlie eat -  in
Kate texts on her   -- not even paying attention to Charlie
Well
(beat) () 76
(') gotta say -- this is the boringest meal 've had in about as long as  can remember
Kate doesn't look up
(') Who're you texting
(still looking down) Jenny
* She's like a parole officer
She's my sponsor
'm glad to know every little fuck- up  have is gonna become a topic of conversation with some chick don't even know
Kate finishes her text
Puts down her phone
(fake enthusiasm) So
what'd you do today, honey
finished some writing and met up with Owen to watch the game and toss a few back
Dear
(beat) You do anything special
lied to my class again
told them that  had a miscarriage
Charlie
(') That's not funny
Yeah, it is
Telling kids fucked-up stuff is totally funny
in, you know -- a kinda fucked-up way
77
Great, well -- 'm glad 'm not actually having a baby
God, Kate -- come on
What else were you supposed to do
Well,  feel like a piece of shit for lying
It's not that big a deal
Jesus
Is this what those meetings teach you
To make drama out of nothing
It's not nothing
lied to little kids and to my boss because  can't take responsibility for my actions
Why don't you go and tell the Principal that you were never pregnant
That the reason you puked is because you smoked crack all night
Would you feel better about yourself then
Beat
've been thinking about doing that, actually
(thinks about it) Yeah
think  would feel better about myself
Fine
Do it, then
guess you don't need a job
could be like you --  could stay home drinking all day and never do anything responsible
(hurt) never do anything responsible
What about buying this house that we live in
Or the food that we're eating
78
Having rich parents doesn't make you responsible
think it's pretty much done the opposite
Charlie looks stunned
* Oh, 'm sorry that  have a family that supports us -- and not the other way around
What the fuck is that supposed to mean
Nothing, Kate
But you can't be mad at me because my family has helped us out
You should be grateful we don't have to struggle
wouldn't care if we struggled with money
've struggled with money my whole life
(beat) 'd rather worry about where my next meal is coming from than if  - - in some drunken stupor -- married a man who just wants to party and meet bands
What the fuck are you talking about
'm talking about you being a baby
selfish baby
You know what
What
fucking hate
It turned you into a bitch
brain-washed bitch
At least 'm not drunk all the time
79
Yeah, you don't drink booze for three months and suddenly you're some saint
You have it all together and 'm just a baby
Kate doesn't answer
(') 'm trying, Kate
'm trying to understand you
But it's hard
You're different and maybe it's good that you're different
Maybe 'm bad and bad for you or something -- because  didn't think the person you were before was so awful
loved that person
Yeah, she drank a lot and she did some silly things
but she was my Kate
You loved that person
Do you not love me now
Yeah, of course
But it's different
You're different
Before  was a mess
(beat) 'm finally getting my life together -- and you loved me more before
Charlie looks at the floor
(soft) Kinda, yeah
Charlie looks like he immediately regrets what he said

normal right now

Everything in life isn't connected to being an alcoholic

We all have a lot of shit we carry around in our heads that doesn't make sense

* Yeah, steps -- and talking and listening and crying
have the crying part covered

You know
Kate nods

What you're gonna say
Kate shakes her head
81
don't know what 'm gonna do about anything
* Listen
you wanna stay in my guest                     * room tonight
You can watch movies, get some good sleep
You sure that's okay
* Yeah, of course
That's why  spent money on a guest bed -- so people could sleep in it

lost a child too

Looks like she feels terrible
'm
'm really sorry
It's okay
It was a long, long time ago
Still hurts sometimes
But eventually
you move on
You have to

That's how  found out about
you know
Frankly, 'm not sure why you didn't feel like you could tell me
freaked out -- a student asked why  wasn't fat and  just froze up and then another student was saying  killed my baby and didn't know what to do
'm not angry with you -- but need to be clear that this doesn't happen again
It won't
promise that
By "not happening again,"  mean that you don't discuss any controversial topics -- things the school board deems "family matters" with your class
(beat) No sex
No god
No drugs and alcohol
Okay,
Kate straightens up in her seat, takes a deep breath
She seems
exhausted
(') can't keep doing this
feel awful
(confused) know this all must be hard for you -- No
You don't understand
(beat) have to be honest with you
What do you mean
83
Principal Barnes
wasn't ever pregnant
Principal Barnes looks shocked
(') lied -- to the class and to you -- because  was scared
But
you vomited in class
know
And when that happened didn't know what to do because the truth is -- Oh, my god -- are you really ill
Is it cancer
No, well, yes
have a disease, but, um
(beat) it's alcoholism
Principal Barnes goes from concerned -- to angry
What
've been working on it
'm one- hundred days sober
When that happened 'd been out drinking and was hung over and -- You vomited in front of children because you were hung over
Yes
And lied, saying that you were pregnant
Well, a student asked if  was pregnant -- and "yes" just kind of fell out of my mouth
84
Principal Barnes looks disgusted
That's sick, Kate
know
No,  don't think you understand how wrong that is
To lie to me -- to the children
You know  felt so terrible for you when  found out that you had a mis --
(beat) -- how can you play with people's emotions like that
was sick
Jesus
you told us you had a miscarriage
'm sorry
threw you a baby shower
'm really sorry
am
've been wanting to tell you the truth because honesty has become really important to me
'm in  now and doing the steps and working with a sponsor and everything
(beat) It's really hard
mean,  think my husband might hate me, and -- 'm sorry, but what you did is totally irresponsible
know
(beat) can't have you here anymore
85
(surprised) Am  being fired
No, no -- the state wouldn't allow that without a report
'm not going to write a report
Because, frankly,  have no idea what that report would say
(beat) But 'm forcing you to take a leave of absence and  think it's in your best interest if you find a job elsewhere
Listen -- 'm really sorry, but 'm doing the right things now
believe you -- or  want to really do
But honey --  believed you before
(beat) 'll have a sub take over your class starting tomorrow
It's late enough in the year that we can just say you're having personal problems -- Principal Barnes looks at Kate
(') -- which seems to be the truth
Principal Barnes -- Not another word
'm upset right now -- very upset -- and  think 'm doing you a favor by not reporting you
Kate struggles to say something, to try to explain herself but no words come out until she musters -- Thank you
Kate stands, defeated, and leaves the Principal's office

Mr
Davies stops her
Kate -- what's going on
told Principal Barnes about everything
(terrified) What
Everything
Did you tell her about
Mr
Davies gestures to Kate's crotch
(confused) Huh
(gets it) Oh, God -- no
told her that 'm an alcoholic
And that  lied
And she fired me
(relieved) Oh
(but concerned, too) my god, Kate -- 'm sorry
've been going to  and trying to be sober and this is what it got me

Mr
Davies awkwardly puts his arm around Kate's shoulder
'm sorry

(confused) No, no -- you're a wonderful, smart woman Kate
You can't let this get you down

Mr
Davies takes Kate's box of things from her
Let me walk you to your car

Davies and begins to -- -- full-on

She nervously sits at the bar
The  -- a gruff looking guy with the sleeves rolled      * up -- approaches
What do you need
Whiskey
Double
The bartender gives Kate her drink
Kate immediately downs it
(') Can  have another one
88
Sure -- you gotta pay for the first one, though
Eight bucks
Kate puts a    down
The bartender pours her another shot
Kate has clearly been drinking for awhile -- she's curled up at the bar, nursing her
(') Look, Miss --  don't wanna be a downer or anything `cause  take it you've had a bad day, but um think you need to go home
Why
Cause you're pretty drunk -- and it's four p

What about him
Kate points to an old   at the other end of the bar
(') You're not kicking him out
'm just trying to be a pal
Stop it -- you aren't my pal just got fired, and  just quit
(beat) It didn't work
Oh, boy
You know what
was fine -- had a husband that loved me and maybe sometimes did embarrassing stuff, but it was a phase
() 89
(') go to  and sober my husband and start fighting and stop fucking -- and sober  get fired
Isn't that what's supposed to not happen
Wow, okay, well
'm real sorry
But this place gets a little nuts after sundown and  don't think a pretty girl who just left  should be here
(beat) 'm gonna call you a cab
don't want a cab
want -- (glances around) -- drugs
Can you hook me up
The bartender rolls his eyes
(') 'mon
let's go out back and smoke some crack
Lady, you're done
You think 'm above smoking crack
`Cause 'm not
And are you really gonna tell me you're not a little attracted to me
Kate leans across the bar, trying to look "seductive" -- but she just looks like she might fall off her bar stool
No
Just a teensy bit
Not in the slightest
Well
you might want to consider investing in glasses, buddy
`Cause 'm a
a stone cold fox
And 'm smart

Now are you gonna let me call a cab

You do that
'll call Mr
Davies
He has dreams about me
The bartender takes a long look at Kate -- as though he's trying to size up if she's insane
Hope that works out for you
Can't believe my luck
just want to get drunk and a bartender won't let me
(beat) Life is stupid
Kate stands up -- almost falling over -- and glares at the bartender

Life is Kate goes over to the old man at the end of bar, winks at him, then picks up his drink and chugs it

Oh, no
We got any drinks
Uh

Don't be cute with me

Okay, so let me see if this makes sense: you say you miss the old Kate -- the Kate who drinks and blacks out and has fun
(beat) Well
here she is
Kate smiles -- but she looks more desperate and drunk than fun
Baby,  didn't mean that
was just being a jerk
Fuck yeah you were
And what
Now you won't drink with me
don't know
Having a beer or something is one thing, but think you really may have a problem
Kate
Well thanks for all the support when  was trying to be sober
Kate takes another shot
'm sorry
didn't realize -- Of course you didn't realize
You don't fucking care about me
94
What are you talking about
Of course  care about you
love you
Kate takes a shot and approaches Charlie
love you too
Love is the easy part
It's the rest of the shit that's hard
Kate kisses Charlie
(') Take off your pants
Charlie gently pushes Kate away
Look --  think you should get to sleep
You're really wasted
don't wanna sleep
wanna fuck
Kate pulls Charlie -- who struggles -- down to the couch
and straddles him
Please, will you stop
No
want you to fuck me
Charlie calmly tries to move Kate off of him
Really
This is weird
Be a man and fuck your wife
Charlie -- who's creeped out now -- forcefully pushes Kate off
No
Jesus -- what the fuck is wrong with you
Kate has become quite angry and belligerent by this point -- and begins picking up   and throwing them at Charlie
95
With me
With me
What the fuck is wrong with me
try hard and  get shit on
Fucked up family, fired from my job -- this marriage
Nothing's wrong with me
What's wrong with
Kate, you need to -- What
What
What do  need
can't drink because 'm crazy or something and  can't stay sober because of you
You're blaming other people for your problems
Kate picks the tequila bottle back up, takes a sip, then -- -- runs at Charlie and tackles him to the ground
(') Stop it
You're acting like a freak
Kate rips Charlie's  -- -- and holds the bottle over his head while straddling him, as if she's about to hit him with it
(') No
What's wrong with you
Kate holds the bottle in the air and looks hard at Charlie
She begins to weep
can't be sober and be with you
Kate gets a flash of anger again and just as it seems like she's about to hit Charlie with the bottle, she -- -- upturns the bottle and begins to chug the tequila
Charlie tries to yank the bottle away, but Kate holds on tight
With the bottle at Kate's lips -- and tequila pouring down her chin -- the couple wrestles for control of the bottle

You tell me
Jenny walks over and tries the icing

-    -                           71 middle-aged  stands at a podium in front of a medium sized group of  -- about twenty-five or so, including Kate, Jenny, and Mr
Davies -- and says --                          * * At this meeting we give cakes to celebrate sober birthdays
We have one birthday tonight -- for Kate, for one year
(beat) Jenny and Dave are giving her the                         * cake
Kate hugs everyone -- then blows out   on a before standing at the podium
Hey, 'm Kate, alcoholic
Hi, Kate
97
've heard that your best day drinking is worse than your worst day sober
(beat) Well
that is  not true
had amazing times drinking, dancing, and laughing
feeling like the most adorable, charming girl in the world
And  was adorable
(beat) 'd piss my pants, but  was still cute
People in the crowd  a little bit
(') When  first tried getting sober, figured that as long as  didn't drink
everything else would just magically work out
But it didn't
(beat) My marriage fell apart
got fired from my job
And that shit happened never read that in any pamphlet
(shakes her head) that isn't what  signed up for
(beat) Um
so,  relapsed
Another shitty slogan 've heard in the rooms is that when you're sober for a bit and drink again "the disease waits for you, picks up where it left off
" (beat) 'm sorry you guys, but those slogans
They all sound like bumper stickers
But,  have to admit
for me, that last one is pretty damn true
(beat) When  drink
become another person
And that person is a pretty big asshole
Well, unless you want to give me drugs or buy me drinks -- then that person is awesome
People knowingly
(') wasn't happy being the "good-time girl," though
And honestly, wasn't very good at it
() 98
(') (beat) My life is really different than it was a year ago
live alone
'm bored a lot more
have a job that pays a lot less
(beat) 'm thankful for the program -- for my friends in here who took the time to help me and give a shit about me
Kate glances at Jenny and Mr
Davies
* (') There are people that used to be a part of my life that  miss -- a lot -- but
(long beat) 'm really grateful for this boring new life of mine
Kate smiles and steps down from the podium as people

Owen speaks -- but Millie seems way more into Charlie
was in North Carolina for a while                     * -- Durham -- playing minor league ball
had some real heat
That's when  met Crash, here
(gestures to Charlie) He'd been sent down to single- to teach me how to carry myself as a pro ball-player
We got involved with the same woman -- an older chick -- but Crash won her in the end
(beat) He's really taught me some
important life-lessons
Millie nods
Wow
that's a pretty crazy way to meet
Yeah
It is
99
You guys are sorta like that movie
what's it called
(plays dumb) don't know
Which one
(to Charlie) Do you know what movie she means
Charlie -- who's pretty hammered -- shakes his head
"Bull"
something
What is it
Charlie and Owen feign ignorance
(') Whatever
It'll come to me
(to Charlie; flirty) So
what do you do now, Crash
write about music
Really
Owen gestures to a  to bring
Yeah
do freelance for a lot of magazines
But print really is dead
So now most of my stuff winds up on websites
Which is depressing
`Cause you can't hold it -- you can just look at it
It's like
Charlie seems lost in drunken thought
Long, awkward silence
Millie puts her hand on Charlie's arm
Like what
Huh
You were talking about writing for websites and you kinda trailed off, honey
100
(trying to save the situation) So, Crash -- why don't you tell this nice lady about the 21 days you were up in "The Show," and what the crowds were like, and -- It was crazy
Charlie drifts off for a moment
(') (to Millie) 'm sorry -- 'm sure you're a great lady
You have lovely hands and hair but
Charlie begins to walk away, wobbly on his feet
(') 'm gonna go to the
'm just gonna go
Charlie stumbles off
(as Charlie leaves) You want a ride
Charlie exits the bar
(') (to Owen) Um
is he cool to drive
Yeah, he'll be fine -- on his bicycle
He rides a bicycle
Oh, yeah -- (smiles) -- as a teenager, he was a bike racing champion growing up in Bloomington, Indiana
He and his friends were called the "Cutters" -- and they beat a bunch of rich college kids in this big race
It was great
() 101
(') (beat) Back then,  was a kickboxing instructor

-                                          73 Charlie rides his  down the street
Swerving all over the place, he's obviously drunk
Red and Blue  flash behind him
Charlie turns to see -- -- a
* 74
& '  -   -              74 Charlie leaves Kate a
(into phone; seems sort of nervous) So,  got into a little trouble -- drunk in public
On a bicycle
(beat) Um,  was thinking
maybe  need to go to one of those meetings
'd like to go with you, though
If that's cool
(beat) Let me know if we could discuss it sometime, okay
Maybe you could come over to our -- um, my house
(beat) Uh
yeah
Thanks
Charlie hangs up the phone
(') (to himself) "Let me know if we could discuss it sometime
" (shakes his head) Such an idiot
75
& '  - /  -        75   * Kate and Charlie stand by Kate's car, which is parked in front by the street
She's just arrived
Awkward tension
Miss our house
102
Um
yeah
Sometimes
(hesitant) Miss me
Beat
Sometimes
(long beat) 've been sober for a year
Really
Yeah
Kate reaches into her purse and takes out her   , showing it to Charlie
They gave you that
Yeah
couple of days ago
Tuesday
Oh
wow
Congratulations
That's really
really
just great mean it
(beat) Tuesday is the night  got pulled over
(laughs) Parallel lives, huh
Kate rolls her eyes
(') So -- you dating anyone
(taken aback) Charlie
Are you
Silence
103
No
Charlie seems relieved
Me either
Owen keeps trying to get me to be his "wing-man" and it's ridiculous and these girls in bars are so lame and  just keep thinking how  wish  was meeting you in a bar for the first time and didn't come with any baggage and could buy you a drink and flirt with you all night and ask for your number
(beat) Wanna go out sometime
don't think it's a good idea
Charlie nods
Long beat
fucked up, didn't
Kate looks down, doesn't speak
(') Yeah,  did
know  did
had a beautiful woman who used to love me and now when  see her she doesn't even want to look me in the eyes
Charlie, please don't do this
miss you
miss the way you taste and smell and
miss things about you that used to drive me nuts
miss you liking shitty 80's music and fake punk-rock from the 90's
don't like shitty 80's music
(beat) like good 80's music
104
and all  want to do is touch you one more time to just, remember -- to make sure it was real
Silence
Kate looks Charlie in the eyes and gives him a slight smile
(') (changing course) Or
maybe 'm a just a delusional fucking idiot
76
& '  -  / -       76   * Kate and Charlie walk in -- it looks sort of the same, but a number of items are missing, and it's messier
In general, the room looks more "dude
" You look really thin
Yeah
When did you last eat
dunno -- like
'm not sure
(seems slightly concerned                           * that he can't remember) think, um
Should we order something
Sure, yeah -- or  could make a bacon and egg sandwich
don't know
haven't really been doing the meat thing
Jesus
It starts with alcohol
Then meat
(beat) Have you given up fun, too
Kate looks at Charlie -- he's half-smiling, not sure if she finds him funny
105
(') (off Kate) Sorry
Bad joke
Kate cracks a smile
Fine
Bacon and egg sandwiches
But 'm gonna make them
Charlie raises his eyebrows
Okay
Kate's at the stove, cooking bacon and eggs
Charlie goes to the  and gets a
Kate glances at him
(') Sorry
Charlie puts the beer back in the fridge
don't care if you drink a beer
You sure
Yeah
Whatever
(thinks about it) No
'm good
Kate stands by the stove and watches as -- -- Charlie -- who sits at the kitchen table -- wolfs down the bacon and egg sandwich
Kate seems pleased that Charlie enjoys it so much
77
& '  -  -           77 Kate and Charlie play croquet
* 106
They look a little tired -- like they've been playing a while
Kate seems to be much better than Charlie
Have you been playing a lot
haven't played in over a year
Then how're you beating me
don't know
Innate talent
They keep playing
haven't met anyone even vaguely interesting since we separated
Um
stick to the game, okay
Long beat
've been masturbating like crazy
Charlie -- miss you
Stop it
Okay
Fine
Beat
You could've been killed
(confused) What
Riding your bike -- drunk
107
But  wasn't
But is that really the point
What are trying to say
(beat) worry about you
(laughs) Yeah,  can understand that
used to worry about you
But now  know you're okay
(beat) That makes me happy
mean, it fucking sucks that you're better off without me but 'm glad you're doing well
No reply from Kate
(') Would you move back in if  came to meetings
You should go for yourself, not to make me happy
But, would you
'm not moving back in
That wasn't the response Charlie wanted to hear
(') Listen,  should go
It's gonna get dark soon
We can always turn the lights on
don't know
Beat
108
So, would you at least
let me take you out on a date
Kate says nothing
(') Maybe
Kate shakes her head
Charlie seems hurt -- but still determined
(') Okay
fine
0 for 2
(new direction) Last question: can we just
play one more game
Kate doesn't answer
(') 'mon
you keep kicking my ass
It's embarrassing
You've gotta give me a chance to redeem myself
(soft) Please
Kate thinks about it for a long beat, and doesn't say yes
but she also doesn't say no
There's a look of hope in Charlie's eyes
