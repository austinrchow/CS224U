Written by Joel Coen & Ethan Coen June 4th, 2007 White letters on a black screen: Receive with simplicity everything that happens to you
- : : The flakes drift lazily down toward us
Our angle looks straight up
Now an angle looking steeply down: the snow falls not quite dead away to collect on a foreground chimneypot and on the little shtetl street that lies maplike below us
It is night, and quiet, and the street is deserted except for one man who walks away from us, his valenki squeaking in the fresh snow
He carries bundled branches on one shoulder and has a hatchet tucked into his belt
We cut down to street level
The man walks toward us, bearded, and bundled against the cold
Smiling, he mutters in Yiddish-the dialogue subtitled
What a marvel
what a marvel
As its door opens and the man enters
Dora
Yes
The man crosses to the stove with his bundle of wood
The voice continues: Can you help me with the ice
The man dumps the wood into a box by the stove as his wife enters with an ice pick
expected you hours ago
You can't imagine what just happened
was coming back on the Lublin road when the wheel came off the cart thank heavens it was the way back and 'd already sold the geese
How much
Fifteen groshen, but that's not the story
was struggling to set the cart upright when a droshky approaches from the direction of Lvov
How lucky, you think, that someone is out this late
Yes, very remarkable
But that's the least of it
He stops to help me; we talk of this, we talk of that-it turns out this is someone you know
Traitle Groshkover
His wife stares at him as he beams
He takes the stare as a sign that she can't place the name
You know,
Pesel Bunim's uncle
The chacham from Lodz, who studied under the Zohar reb in Krakow
Still she stares
Then, quietly: God has cursed us
What
Traitle Groshkover has been dead for three years
Laughter erupts from the man but, as his wife continues to stare at him, he strangles on it
Quiet
Wind whistles under the eaves
The man says quietly: Why do you say such a thing
saw the man
talked to him
You talked to a dybbuk
Traitle Groshkover died of typhus in Pesel Bunim's house
Pesel told me-she sat shiva for him
They stare at each through a silence broken only by the sound of the quickening wind
rap at the door
Neither immediately responds
Finally, to her husband: Who is it
For some soup, to warm himself
The wind moans
He helped me, Dora
We are looking in from the outside as it unlatches and creaks in, opened by the husband in the foreground, who has arranged his face into a strained look of greeting
In the background the wife stares, hollow-eyed
You are welcome here
Reverse on  : a short, merry-looking fellow with a bifurcated beard and a silk hat and spectacles
He gives a little squeal of delight
You are too kind, Velvel
Too kind
He steps into the house and sees the wife staring at him
And you must be Dora
So much  have heard of you
Yes, your cheeks are pink and your legs are stout
What a wife you have
The husband chuckles nervously
Yes
ray of sun, a ray of sun
Sit
My husband said he offered you soup
Yes, but  couldn't possibly eat this late, or 'd have nightmares
No, no: no soup for me
knew it
laughs
see
You think 'm fat enough already
He settles, chuckling, into his chair, but Dora remains sober: No
dybbuk doesn't eat
stares at her, shocked
The wife returns the stare
The husband looks from wife to  , apprehensive
heavy silence
bursts into pealing laughter
What a wife you have
He wipes away tears of merriment; the husband relaxes, even begins to smile
assure you,  , it's nothing personal; she heard a story you had died, three years ago, at Pesel Bunim's house
This is why she think you are a dybbuk; , of course, do not believe in such things
am a rational man
is still chuckling
Oh my
Oh my yes
What nonsense
And even if there were spirits, certainly
He thumps his chest
am not one of them
Pesel always worried
Your corpse was left unattended for many minutes when Pesel's father broke shiva and left the room-it must have been then that the Evil One- She breaks off to spit at the mention of the Evil One
-took you
is terribly amused: "My corpse
" Honestly
What a wife you have
Oh yes
Look, husband
She steps forward to the Reb, who looks enquiringly up at her
They were preparing the body
Pesel's father shaved one check
As his eyes roll down to look at her hand, she draws it across his smooth right cheek
Then he left the room
He came back, and shaved the other
She reaches across to the other cheek,  's eyes following her hand- You were already gone
-and drags her hand across
bristly sound
laughs
shaved hastily this morning and missed a bit-by you this makes me a dybbuk
He appeals to the husband: It's true,  was sick with typhus when  stayed with Peselle, but  recovered, as you can plainly see, and now -hugh
The wife steps back
looks slowly down at his own chest in which the wife has just planted an ice pick
stares at the ice pick
The wife stares
The husband stares
Suddenly,   bursts out laughing: What a wife you have
The husband can manage only a shocked whisper: Woman, what have you done
again looks down at his chest, which again moves him to laughter
He shakes his head
Why would she do such a thing
He looks up
ask you, Velvel, as a rational man: which of us is possessed
What do you say now about spirits
He is unharmed
On the contrary
don't feel at all well
And indeed, blood has begun to soak through his vest
He chuckles with less energy
One does a mitzvah and this is the thanks one gets
Dora
Woe, woe
How can such a thing be
Perhaps  will have some soup
am feeling weak
He rises to his feet but totters
Or perhaps  should go
He smiles weakly at Dora
One knows when one isn't wanted
He walks unsteadily to the door, opens it with some effort, and staggers out into the moaning wind and snow to be swallowed by the night
The wife and husband stare at the door banging in the wind
: Dear wife
We are ruined
Tomorrow they will discover the body
All is lost
Nonsense, Velvel
She walks to the door
Blessed is the Lord
Good riddance to evil and shuts it against the wind
drumbeat thumps in the black
Music blares: the Jefferson Airplane
Grace Slick's voice enters: When the truth is found to be lies And all the hope inside you dies Don't you want somebody to love
An image fades in slowly, but even up full it is dim: some kind of round, dull white shape with a small black pinhole center
This white half-globe is a plug set in a flesh-toned field
The flesh tone glows translucently, backlit
We are drifting toward the white plug and, as we do so, the music grows louder still
pull back-a reverse on the preceding push in-from the cheap white plastic earpiece of a transistor radio
The Jefferson Airplane continues over the cut but becomes extremely compressed
The pull back reveals that the earpiece is lodged in someone's ear and trails a white cord
We drift down the cord to find the radio at its other end
As we do so we hear, live in the room, many voices speaking a foreign language in unison
classroom, apparently
The radio is on a desktop but hidden from in front by the book held open before it
The book is written in non-Roman characters
We are in Hebrew school
The boy who is listening to the transistor radio- Gopnik-sits at a hinge-topped desk in a cinderblock classroom whose rows of desks are occupied by other boys and girls of about twelve years of age
It is dusk and the room is flourescent-lit
At the front of the room a gray-haired man in a worn suit and tie addresses the class
straightens one leg so that he may dig into a pocket
With an eye on the  to make sure he isn't being watched, he eases something out: twenty-dollar bill
Mee yodayah
Reuven
Rifkah
Mah zeh "anakim"
Efsheh mashooach ba-avodah
At the cut to the light the Jefferson Airplane music jumps up full
The light resolves into a multi-flared image of a blinking eye
Reverse: the inside of a human ear
Fleshy whorls finely veined, a cavity receding to dark
Objective on the 's office: the  is peering through a lightscope into the ear of an early-middle-aged man,  Gopnik
The Jefferson Airplane music continues
10 Uh-huh
Close on Hebrew characters being scribbled onto the blackboard as the  talks
The , talking
bored child, staring off
His point-of-view: a blacktopped parking lot with a few orange school busses, beyond it a marshy field, and distant suburban bungalows
Close on another child staring at something through drooping eyelids
His point-of-view: very close on the face of a classroom clock
We hear its electrical hum
Its red sweep-second hand crawls around the dial very, very slowly
Gopnik hisses: Fagle
The  drones on, writing on the blackboard
's eyes flit from the  to the student sitting kitty-corner in front of him-a husky youth with shaggy hair
He hasn't heard the prompt
Fagle
The  turns from the blackboard and  leans back, eyes front, folding the twenty up small behind his book
Ahnee rotzeh lalechet habait hakisai
Mee yodayah
Misaviv tamid anachnoo tamid
The clock-watching child, eyelids sinking, is beginning to drool out of one side of his mouth
' 11 The light again flaring the lens
Reverse: looking into a pupil
Objective: the  looking through his scope into 's eye
Mm-hmm
bored child is excavating a bugger from his nose
The  turns back to the chalkboard to circle something
Fagle
Hamrah oomoh- He interrupts himself briefly to make a couple of phlegm-hawking sounds
He resumes: Hamrah oomoh meshiach oomshel zal
' The  palpates 's midriff, digging his fingers into the hairy, baggy flesh
's Voice Uh-huh
We'll do some routine -rays
young girl holds a hank of her bangs in front of her face, separating out individual hairs to examine them for split ends
Ahnoo ahnoo mah

The  begins to pace the desk aisles, looking back and forth among the students
Mee yodayah
The bugger-seeker, having succesfully withdrawn a bugger, carefully drapes it over the sharp end of his pencil, to what end we cannot know
, apprehensively eyeing the , slides the twenty into the transistor radio's cover-sleeve
- huge white rubberized cone, pointed directly at us
We hear a rush of static and the 's voice filtered through a talk-back: 's Voice Hold still
Wider:  is in his shorts lying on his back on an examining table covered by a sheet of tissue paper
The -ray cone is pointed at the middle of his body
There is a brief sci-fi-like machine hum
It clicks off
The clock-watching student's head is making descending bobs toward his chest
Nefsheh shelach hamilamid-eh
The 's circuit of the classroom has taken him around behind 's book lies face-down on the desk, covering the radio, but the white cord snakes out from under it up to his ear
The  yanks at the cord
13 The cord pops out of its jack and the Jefferson Airplane blares tinnily from beneath the book of torah stories
The  lifts the book to expose the jangling radio
Outraged, the  projects above the music: Mah zeh
Mah zeh
Some of the students are singing along; a couple beat rhythm on their desks
Shechet, talmidim
Anachnoo lo cam zeh b'bait sefer
Shechet bivakasha
Three other students join in a chorus: Shechet
Shechet bivakasha
The nodding student's head droops ever lower
Other students join in the chant: The nodding student's chin finally reaches, and settles on, his chest, and he gives a long snorfling inhale of sleep
' , now fully clothed, is seated across from the
The  is looking at his file
He absently taps a cigarette out of a pack and lights up
He nods as he smokes, looking at the file
Well, -sorry
He holds the pack toward
14 No thanks
Well, you're in good health
How're Judith and the kids
Good
Everyone's good
You know
The  takes a long suck
Good
Daniel must be-what
About to be bar mitzvah
Two weeks
Well, mazel tov
They grow up fast, don't they
The portrait, old, in an ornate gilt frame, is of a middle-aged rabbi with a small neat mustache and round spectacles
He wears a tallis hood-style and a phylactery box is strapped to his forehead
plaque set into the frame identifies the man as Rabbi Minda
Wider shows that the portrait hangs in the Hebrew school principal's office, a white cinderblock room
It is quiet
The only sound is a deep electrical hum
Just visible behind the principal's desk, upon which is a low stack of books and a name plate identifying the occupant as  , is the top of a man's head-an old man, with a few whispy white hairs where his yarmulka is not
, seated opposite, pushes up from his slouch to better see across the desk
We boom up to show more of the principal
He is short
He wears a white shirt and hoist-up pants that come to just below his armpits
He has thick eyeglasses
He fiddles with the transistor radio, muttering: Hmm
eh
nu
15 He experiments with different dials on the radio
nervously watches
You put the- The old man holds up one hand
In ivrit
(In Hebrew) Um
The old man looks down at the little earpiece pinched between two fingers
He examines it as a superstitious native might a Coca-Cola bottle
The source of the electrical hum: a wall clock whose red sweep-second hand crawls around the dial very, very slowly
The Reb continues to squint at the earpiece
sighs
He encourages: Yeah, you- The principal's tone is harder: In ivrit
This time his cold look holds until he is sure that the admonishment has registered
He looks back down at the earpiece
We hear the door open
The principal ignores it
An old woman walks slowly in with a teacup chattering on a saucer
She has thick eyeglasses
She wears thick flesh-colored support hose
She takes slow, short steps toward the desk
The principal is studying the radio
16 Mneh
The old woman continues to take slow short steps toward him
The tableau looks like a performance-art piece
She reaches the desk and sets the teacup down
She summons a couple of phlegm- hawking rasps and turns to go
She takes slow short steps toward the door
The principal raises the earpiece experimentally toward his ear
Close on his hairy, wrinkled ear as his trembling fingers bring in the earpiece
The i f ngers push and wobble and tamp the earpiece into place, hesitate, and then do some more pushing and wobbling and tamping
The principal keeps  fixed with a stare as his hand hesitantly drops from his ear, ready to reach back up should the earpiece loosen
mneh
Satisfied that neither the student nor the earpiece are about to make any sudden moves, he looks down at the radio
He turns a dial
Faintly and tinnily from the earpiece we hear the compressed jangle of rock music
The rabbi stares blankly, listening
slumps, looking warily at the rabbi
The rabbi continues to stare down at the radio
The compressed rock music jangles on
The rabbi is expressionless, mouth slightly open, listening
Tableau: anxious student, earplugged spiritual leader
Muffled, from the outer office, the hawking of phlegm
We are behind a man who writes equations on a chalkboard, shoulder at work and hand quickly waggling
Periodically he glances back, giving us a fleeting look at his face: it is 17 Gopnik
You following this
Okay
So
Heh-heh
This part is exciting
Students follow along, bored
continues to write
So, okay
So
So if that's that, then we can do this, right
Is that right
Isn't that right
And that's Schrodinger's paradox, right
Is the cat dead or is the cat not dead
Okay
is entering the physics department office
The department's secretary wheels her castored chair away from her typing
Messages, Professor Gopnik
He takes the three phone messages
Thank you, Natalie
Oh-
Come in
Korean graduate student who was been waiting on a straightbacked chair rises
' He is flipping through the messages
Absently: So, uh, what can  do for you
The messages: Dick Dutton Columbia Record Club 18 : "Please call
" Sy Ableman "Let's talk
" Park : "Unjust test results
" He crumples the last one
Uh, Dr
Gopnik,  believe the results of Physics Mid-Term were unjust
Uh-huh, how so
received an unsatisfactory grade
In fact: , the failing grade
Uh, yes
You failed the mid-term
That's accurate
Yes, but this is not just
was unaware to be examined on the mathematics
Well-you can't do physics without mathematics, really, can you
If  receive failing grade  lose my scholarship, and feel shame
understand the physics
understand the dead cat
() You understand the dead cat
19 nods gravely
But
you
you can't really understand the physics without understanding the math
The math tells how it really works
That's the real thing; the stories  give you in class are just illustrative; they're like, fables, say, to help give you a picture
An imperfect model
mean-even don't understand the dead cat
The math is how it really works
shakes his head, dubious
Very difficult
very difficult
Well,
'm sorry, but
what do you propose
Passing grade
No no, - Or perhaps  can take the mid-term again
Now  know it covers mathematics
Well, the other students wouldn't like that, would they
If one student gets to retake the test til he gets a grade he likes
impassively considers this
Secret test
wraps a hand wearily over his eyes
No, 'm afraid- 20 Hush-hush
No, that's just not workable
'm afraid we'll just have to bite the bullet on this thing, , and- Very troubling
He rises
very troubling
He goes to the door, shaking his head, as  looks on in surprise
He leaves
stares at the open door
The secretary outside, her back to us, types on
looks stupidly around his own office, shakes his head
He picks up the phone message from Sy Ableman-"Let's talk"-and dials
As he dials his other hand wanders over the papers on the desktop
There is a plain white envelope on the desk
picks it up as the phone rings through
ring is clipped short and a warm basso-baritone rumbles through the line: Phone Voice Sy Ableman
Hello, Sy,  Gopnik
() How are you, my friend
picks idly at the envelope
Good, how've you been, Sy
21 Inside the envelope: a thick sheaf of one-hundred-dollar bills
Oh fine
Shall we talk
reacts to the money
(into phone) What
Oh
Sorry
, uh-call back
He slams down the phone
He rushes out the door, through the secretarial area, and into the hallway, and looks up toward the elevators
Empty
He looks at the stuffed envelope he still holds
He goes back to the departmental office
The secretary sits typing
She glances at him and, as she goes back to her typing: Sy Ableman just called
Said he got disconnected
hand enters to knock
Man's Voice Out in a minute
, the sixteen-year-old girl who has just knocked, rolls her eyes
gotta wash my hair
'm going out tonight
Out in a minute
22 Jesus Christ
She stomps down the hall
Judith, a woman of early middle age, is at the stove
enters
is Uncle Arthur always in the bathroom
He has to drain his sebacious cyst
You know that
Will you set the table
Why can't he do it in the basement
Or go out in the garage
We are raking the exterior of an orange school bus as it rattles along
Hebrew characters on the side identify it-to some, anyway
We are locked down on  as the bus rattles like an old crate, squeaking, grinding gears, belching exhaust
and the children around him vibrate and pitch about but, from their lack of reaction, seem used to it
They raise their voices to be heard over the engine noise and the various stress noises in the chassis and a transistor radio somewhere that plays Jefferson Airplane
had twenty bucks in it too
Inside the case
23 Mark Sallerson Twenty bucks
How come
bought a lid from Mike Fagle
Couple weeks ago
still owed him twenty
Mark Sallerson He already gave you the pot
Yeah but a couple weeks ago my funding got cut off
Fagle said he'd pound the crap out of me if  didn't pay up
Howard Altar What funding got cut off
Where do you get your money
Another boy, with thick glasses, is Ronnie Nudell
Ronnie Nudell What happened
Mark Sallerson Rabbi Turchik took his radio
Had money in it
Ronnie Nudell That fucker
Yeah
think he said he was confiscating it
Ronnie Nudell He's a fucker
Where do you get your money
Mark Sallerson Mike Fagle's gonna kick his ass
Last week he pounded the crap out of Seth Seddlemeyer
24 Ronnie Nudell He's a fucker
Mark Sallerson Fagle
Or Seth Seddlemeyer
Ronnie Nudell They're both f ickers
hand enters to knock
Uncle Arthur's Voice Out in a minute
Are you still in there
Uncle Arthur , uh
Just a minute
've gotta wash my hair
'm going out tonight, to the hole
Uncle Arthur Okay
pulls into the driveway and gets out of the car
The purr of a lawn mower
He looks
His point-of-view: Gar Brandt, the next-door neighbor, is mowing his lawn
He has a buzz cut and is wearing a white -shirt
Another noise competes with the lawn mower: rattling, squeaking, gear-grinding
The orange school bus with Hebrew lettering pulls up across the street
Its door opens with a pneumatic hiss to discharge a passenger
25 sits in
His wife and two children are already seated
There is one empty place
projects: Arthur
muffled voice: Yeah
Dinner
Okay
Out in a minute
We should wait
Are you kidding
They start eating
Mr
Brandt keeps mowing part of our lawn
Does that matter
What
Is it important
shrugs
It's just odd
26 Any news on your tenure
think they'll give me tenure
You think
() Well,  don't know
These things aren't, you know
No,  don't know
Which is why  ask
- Mom, how long is Uncle Arthur staying with us
Ask your father
Twilight
is stepping onto a hose as he unwheels it from the drum of a traveling sprinkler, laying out an are to cover the back yard
Intermittent thwacks from next door: Gar Brandt and his son, who also has a buzz cut and a white -shirt, throw a baseball back and forth
Gar Brandt throws hard
The ball pops in the boy's mitt
Ow
walks over to the boundary defined by the fresh mowing
He sights down it
Gar Brandt looks over his shoulder at , looking
Gar Brandt is expressionless
He 27 goes back to throwing
Ow
Evening
Lights on
sits at the kitchen table, a briefcase open on the chair next to him
Blue books-examination booklets-are spread on the table in front of him
He reads, occasionally making marginal scribbles, grading
From off, faint and dulled by intervening walls, rock music: somewhere in the house is listening to the Jefferson Airplane
The clink of teaspoon against china as  stirs his tea
He looks up at a noise: enters
Honey
() Honey
Did you talk to Sy
Still absent, without looking up: Sy
-Sy Ableman
-That's right, he called, but - You didn't talk to him
No, - You know the problems you and  have been having
Sympathetic, but still absent: 28 Mm
Well, Sy and  have become very close
This brings 's head up
He focuses on , puzzled
She elaborates: In
short:  think it's time to start talking about a divorce
stares at her
long beat
At length, trying to digest: Sy Ableman
This is not about Sy
You mentioned Sy
Don't twist my words
We- divorce-what have  done
haven't done anything- What have  done
, don't be a child
You haven't "done" anything haven't "done" anything
Yes
Yes
We haven't done anything
And -'m probably about to get tenure
Nevertheless, there have been problems
As you know
29 - And things have changed
And then-Sy Ableman
Sy has come into my life
And now- Come into your-what does that mean
You, you, you, you barely know him
We've known the Ablemans for fifteen years
Yes, but you you said we hadn't done anything
suddenly is stony: haven't done anything
This is not some flashy fling
This is not about woopsy-doopsy
stares at her
Sy Ableman
From down the hall, a knock on a door
muffled voice: Out in a minute
Look,  didn't know any other way of breaking it to you
Except to tell you
And treat you like an adult
Is that so wrong
does not seem to be listening
His eyes roam the room as he thinks
Where do  sleep
narrows her eyes
30 What
Arthur's on the couch
Look
Sy feels that we should- Esther is barely cold
Esther died three years ago
And it was a loveless marriage
Sy wants a Gett
This derails the conversation
stares, trying to pick up the thread
what
ritual divorce
He says it's very important
Without a Gett 'm an Aguna
what
What are you talking about
She turns to go, shaking her head, peeved: You always act so surprised
As she leaves: have begged you to see the Rabbi
has fallen asleep at the kitchen table, face-down in a pile of blue books
Cold blue light sweeps across him and he looks up
31 short, balding middle-aged man in flannel pyjamas and an old flannel dressing gown stands in front of the open refrigerator holding an open jar of orange juice
He tips the jar back to drink, his free hand holding a balled-up towel to the back of his neck stares at him
enters the departmental office
His eyes are red-rimmed and dark-bagged
He has beard stubble
The department's secretary wheels her castored chair away from her typing
Messages, Professor Gopnik
He takes the two phone messages
looks at the messages: Dick Dutton Columbia Record Club : "2Ad attempt
Please call
" Sy Ableman "Let's have a good talk
" knock brings his look up
Yes-thanks for coming,
Park enters the office
32 Have a seat
uses a key to open the top left desk drawer
He takes out the envelope
We had,  think, a good talk, the other day, but you left something that- didn't leave it
Well--you don't even know what  was going to say
didn't leave anything
'm not missing anything
know where everything is
looks at him, trying to formulate a thought
Well
then, , where did this come from
He waves the envelope
This is here, isn't it
looks at it gravely
Yes, sir
That is there
This is not nothing, this is something
Yes sir
That is something
beat
What is it
You know what it is
You know what it is
believe
And 33 you know  can't keep it,
Of course, sir
'll have to pass it on to Professor Finkle, along with my suspicions about where it came from
Actions have consequences
Yes
Often
Always
Actions always have consequences
He pounds the desk for emphasis
In this office, actions have consequences
Yes sir
Not just physics
Morally
Yes
And we both know about your actions
No sir
know about my actions
can interpret,
know what you meant me to understand
Meer sir my sir
cocks his head
34 Meer sir my sir
(careful enunciation) Mere
surmise
Sir
He gravely shakes his head
Very uncertain
hand lays it onto a slowly spinning vinyl record
Through scratches and pops, a solo tenor starts a mournful Hebrew chant
Close on the sleeve: Rabbi Youssele Rosenblatt Chants Your Haftorah Portion 12 Rabbi Youssele wears a caftan and a felt hat and has sad eyes
They peer out from the dark beard that covers most of the rest of his face like owl's eyes peering out of the woods
Wider, on , in his bedroom, evening
He lifts the tone arm on the portable turntable
He chants the passage
He drops the tone arm at the same place; Rabbi Youssele chants the passage again
listens, eyes narrowed
He lifts the tone arm and chants the passage again
He replays the passage again; before he can lift the tone arm to echo it his door bursts open
Rabbi Youssele continues to chant
35 You little brat fucker
You snuck twenty bucks out of my drawer
Studying torah
Asshole
You little brat
'm telling Dad
Oh yeah
You gonna tell him you've been sneaking it out of his wallet
All right, you know what 'm gonna do
You little brat
If you don't give it back
We hear the thunk of the front door opening
stands, calling: Dad
is entering with his briefcase
As he stows it in the foyer closet 's voice continues, off: Dad, you gotta fix the aerial
Judith emerges from the kitchen
Hello , have you thought about a lawyer
Honey, please
emerges from the hall
36 We're not getting channel four at all
(to Judith) Can we discuss it later
can't get  Troop
, the children know
Do you think this is some secret
Do you think this is something we're going to keep quiet
enters
Dad, Uncle Arthur is in the bathroom again
And =m going to the hole at eight
She hits  on the back of the head
Stop it
What's going on
She keeps doing that
sits in a reclining chair in the living room, head back, listening to Sidor Belarsky on the hi-fi
On top of the music is a hissing-sucking sound
There is also the sound of a pencil busily scratching paper
We cut to its source: Uncle Arthur sits scribbling into a spiral notebook, his free hand holding the end of a length of surgical tubing against the back of his neck
The tube leads to a water-pik-like appliance on an end table next to him-the source of the sucking sound
After a long beat of listening to the music,  speaks into space: 37 Arthur
Uncle Arthur does not look up from his scribbling
Uncle Arthur Yes
continues to stare at the ceiling
What're you doing
Still without looking up: Uncle Arthur Working on the Mentaculus
Long beat
Music
Scribbling
Any luck, um, looking for an apartment
More scribbling
Uncle Arthur No
The doorbell chimes
enters, glances through the front door's head-height window, and-freezes, one hand arrested on the way to the doorknob
His point-of-view: framed by the window, yellowly lit by the stoop light, a human head
middle-aged man, a few years older than
fleshy face with droopy hangdog features, a five-o'clock shadow, and sad Harold Bloom eyes
opens the door
38 Sy
Sy, entering, thrusts out a hand
His voice vibrates with a warm, sad empathy: Good to see you,
He is a heavy-set man wearing a short-sleeved shirt that his belly tents out in front of him
In his left hand he holds a bottle of wine
() 'll get Judith
No, actually , 'm here to see you, if  might
He shakes his head
Such a thing
Such a thing
Shall we go in the
He is leading him into the kitchen but Sy, oblivious to surroundings, plows on with the conversation, arresting both men in the narrow space between kitchen sink and stove, and invading 's space
You know, -how we handle ourselves, in this situation-it's so impawtant
Uh-huh
Absolutely
Judith told me that she broke the news to you
She said you were very adult
Did she
39 Absolutely
The respect she has for you
Yes
Absolutely
But the children,
The children
He shakes his head
The most impawtant
Well,  guess
Of coss
And Judith says they're handling it so well tribute to you
Do you drink wine
Because this is an incredible bottle
This is not Mogen David
This is a wine, bawdeaux
You know, Sy- Open it-let it breathe
Ten minutes
Letting it breathe, so impawtant
Thanks, Sy, but 'm not- insist
No reason for discumfit
'll be uncumftable if you don't take it
These are signs and tokens,
'm just-'m not ungrateful, 'm,  just don't know a lot about wine and, given our respective, you know- He is startled when Sy abruptly hugs him
40 ' okay
He finishes the hug off with a couple of thumps on the back
'okay
Wuhgonnabe fine
We are dutch on a slit of a view through a cracked-open frosted window: the Hebrew school parking lot
The last couple of busses filled with students are rolling out of the lot
It is late afternoon
reverse shows  in a stall, standing on a closed toilet, angling his head to peer out the bathroom window opened at the top
The bathroom outside the stall: Ronnie Nudell leans against a sink waiting, sucking a long draw from a joint
emerges from the stall
Ronnie Nudell offers the joint
Ronnie Nudell Want some of this fucker
The bathroom door cracks open in the foreground
peeks out
His point-of-view: the empty hallway ending in a  with another hallway
janitor crosses, pushing a broom down the far hallway
He disappears
His echoing footsteps recede
and Ronny emerge from the bathroom
The photo-portrait on the wall of Mar Turchik's office lit by late-day sun
We hear a scraping sound
41 Wider: Ronnie Nudell looks over 's shoulder as , hunched at Mar Turchik's desk, fishes the end of a bent hanger into the keyhole on the top left drawer
After a beat, the hanger turns
They open the drawer
In it: squirt guns, marbles set to rolling by the opening of the drawer, a comic book, a Playboy magazine, a slingshot, a small bundle of firecrackers
Hands rifle the gewgaws: no radio
Ronnie Nudell Fuck
We are behind the two boys who sit side by side on the last pew, staring at the front of the empty sanctuary
Its stained glass windows further weaken the late-afternoon light
In deference to the location, the boys wear yarmulkas
long hold on their still backs
At length, some movement in 's back, his head dips, and we hear him sucking on the joint
He holds it, exhales, and passes it wordlessly to Ronnie Nudell
We are pulling  as he walks along the street, eyes red-rimmed, still wearing his yarmulka
It is dusk
After a few beats of walking, the front door of a house just behind  opens husky, shaggy-haired youth emerges on the run
The sound has alerted
Seeing Mike Fagle, he too begins to run
He reaches up and grabs his yarmulka and clutches it in one of his pumping fists
Pursued and pursuer both run wordlessly, panting, feet pounding
Mike Fagle is closing
But  is already cutting across the Brandt's front yard, approaching his own
He plunges into the house and slams the door
Mike Fagle draws up, panting, gazing hungrily at the house
42 Lights are on inside
The house is a warm yellow citadel in the dusk
After a beat we hear, faint and dulled, the Jefferson Airplane
Mike Fagle slinks away
shockingly blue sky with picture-perfect clouds hanging in it
After a beat the top of an aluminum extension ladder swings in from the bottom of the frame and comes toward us
We cut to a side angle as the ladder clunk against a roof
It starts vibrating to the rhythmic clung of someone climbing
Hands enter
's head enters
He climbs onto the roof
He takes a couple steps away from the edge and stands tentatively, making sure of his balance
He looks around
His point-of-view towards the front
An unfamiliarly high perspective on the street and the neighboring houses, almost maplike
Very peaceful
Wind rhythmically, gently waves the trees
gingerly walks up to the aerial at the peak of the roof
We are hearing a rhythmic popping noise
reaches the peak and straddles it
He looks down at the back yard
Ow
Foreshortened Gar Brandt and Mitch are playing catch in their back yard
With each toss the ball pops, alternately in father's mitt and son's
Precariously balanced,  reaches out for the aerial
He tentatively touches it
He grasps it
He twists the aerial
43 Something strange: as it rotates the aerial creaks-a high whine as pure as the hum sounded from the rim of a wineglass
Ow
Faintly, under the wineglass sound, and clouded by static, a high, ringing tenor sings in an unfamiliar modality
Cantorial music
drops his hand
Inertia keeps the aerial rotating slowly til it dies, the sound drifting away into the sybillant shushing of trees
reaches out again to turn the aerial
The same crystal hum
cantorial singing
and now, layering in, the theme from  Troop
Music
Crystal hum
Wind
Ow
's look travels: his point-of-view pans slowly off the steep angle of father and son playing catch, travels across his own backyard, and brings in the white fence that encloses the patio of the neighbor on the other side
Gar (off) Good toss, Mitch
On the enclosed patio a woman reclines on a lawn chaise of nylon bands woven over an aluminum frame
She is on her back, eyes closed against the sun
She is naked
Mitch (off) Ow
reacts to the naked woman: startled at first, he moves to hide behind the peak of the roof
But as he realizes that the sun keeps the woman's eyes closed he relaxes, continu- ing to stare
She is attractive
Not young, not old: 's age
Peaceful
After a still beat one of her hands gropes blindly to the side
It finds an ashtray on the table next to her and takes from it a pluming cigarette
The woman takes a puff and replaces it
44 Mitch (off) Ow
Troop
Cantorial singing
Blue sky and white puffy clouds
The sound of a pencil scratching against paper
pencil scratches equations into a lamplit spiral notebook
Sidor Belarsky comes in at the cut
So does the spluttering suck-sound of Uncle Arthur's evacuator
Wider on Uncle Arthur, in his pyjamas, propped up on the narrow fold-out sofa, writing with one hand as he holds the evacuator hose to his neck with the other
Squeezed into the living room next to the fold-out sofa is a camp cot of plaid-patterned nylon stretched over an aluminum frame
On the camp cot is , lying half-in, half- out of a rumpled sleeping bag
He stares at the ceiling, a damp washcloth pressed against his forehead
His face is flaming red
Arthur speaks absently as he scribbles: Will you read this
Tell me what you think
continues to stare at the ceiling
Okay
Uncle Arthur glances up from the notebook, focuses on
Boy
You should've worn a hat
45 The lights are out
Very quiet
Uncle Arthur lightly snores
still stares at the ceiling
He shifts his weight
The aluminum frame of the cot squeaks
He shifts again
Another creak
fishes his watch from the jumble of clothes on the floor: 4:50
, in his underwear, spoons ground coffee into the percolator
Uncle Arthur snores softly on in the other room
From outside, a dull thunk
pulls back a curtain
Next door, Gar Brandt is going down the walk, wearing camouflage togs and camo billed cap, a rifle bag slung over his shoulder
He is carrying an ice chest, its contents clicking and sloshing
The boy Mitch, also wearing camo clothes and cap and also with a rifle bag, has just closed the front door
He now lets the screen door swing shut behind him and follows his father down the walk to the car in the driveway
The twitter of early morning birds
Gar's voice, though not projected, stands out in the pre-dawn quiet: Let's see some hustle, Mitch
Its top sheet, densely covered by equations, has a heading: The Mentaculus Compiled by Arthur Gopnik After a beat 's hand enters to turn the page
The second page is also densely covered with equations
46 This brings 's look up from the Mentaculus
We are in 's office
Standing in the office doorway is Arlen Finkle
Hi Arlen
Arlen Finkle ,  feel that, as head of the tenure committee  should tell you this, though it should be no cause for concern
You should not be at all worried
waits for more
Arlen seems to need a prompt
Okay
Arlen Finkle feel  should mention it even though we won't give this any weight at all in considering whether to grant you tenure, so,  repeat no cause for concern
Okay, Arlen
Give what any weight
Arlen Finkle We have received some letters, uh
denigrating you, and, well, urging that we not grant you tenure
From who
Arlen Finkle They're anonymous
And so of course we dismiss them completely
Well
well
what do they say
Arlen Finkle They make allegations, not even allegations, assertions, but 47 'm not really
while we give them no credence, , 'm not supposed to deal in any specifics about the committee's deliberations
But
think you're saying, these won't play any part in your deliberations
Arlen Finkle None at all
Um, so what are they
Arlen Finkle Moral turpitude
You could say
Uh-huh
Can  ask, are they, are they-idiomatic
Arlen Finkle , uh
The reason  ask,  have a Korean student, South Korean, disgruntled South Korean, and  meant to talk to you about this, actually, he- Arlen Finkle No
No, the letters are competently-even eloquently written
native English-speaker
No question about that
Uh-huh
Arlen Finkle But  reiterate this, : no cause for concern
only speak because  would have felt odd concealing it
Yes, okay, thank you Arlen
48 Arlen Finkle Best to Judith
answers with a wan smile
He looks down at the Mentaculus
Day
Somewhere inside the school a bell rings
Its doors swing open and children emerge
Our angle is down a line of school busses, each with the the same stenciled Hebrew lettering, waiting to ferry the children home
We are tracking toward the busses to steepen the rake
As children sort themselves out and climb into their respective vehicles, the track brings the nearest bus into the fore- ground
It noisily idles with its signature squeaks and stress sounds, its low coughing engine ominously rumbling
Children start climbing on
Inside the bus, now moving
Engine noise bangs in louder and air roars in through open windows
We are on the driver, a sallow man in a short-sleeved white shirt with earlocks and a yarmulke
He pitches about, stoically wrestling with the wheel and gear shift as the vehicle bucks
The pitching children
Somewhere, Jefferson Airplane plays
gotta get my radio back
Ronnie Nudell Maybe the fucker lodged it up his fucking asshole
gotta get it back
Or Mike Fagle's gonna pound the crap out of me
Ronnie Nudell 49 Way up his asshole
And 'll still have to get my sister the money back or she's gonna break four of my records
Twenty bucks, four records
Howard Altar How do you buy all those records
Where do you get your funds
Standing in his yard
His eyes are darkly pouched
He is staring at something, it seems in distress
We hear a fluttering sound
His point-of-view: stakes are set out in the Brandts' yard
Red ribbon connecting them outlines a projection from the side of the house
The loose ends of the ribbon flutter in the breeze
Engine noise brings 's look around
car is arriving
It is the Brandts' car, oddly burdened
As it pulls into their driveway we see that there is a four-point stag strapped to the hood, its head lolling over the grille
Gar and Mitch get out of the car in their hunting fatigues
Blood is smeared on Gar's shirt
Go scrub up, Mitch
Uh, good afternoon
This brings Gar's look around
Apparently he is unused to talking with his neighbor
There is a short beat before his response
Afternoon
In the background of his angle is the dead buck, staring off through sightless eyes
50 () Been hunting
Yep
Is that a, uh
He is indicating the staked area
Gar looks around at it, looks back at
Gonna be a den
Uh-huh, that's great
Uh, Mr
Brandt- Gar barks at Mitch, who has lingered to listen to the grown-ups: said scrub up, Mitch
The child quickly goes
frowns
Isn't this a school day
Took him out of school today
So he could hunt with his dad
Oh
He nods
That's
nice
Gar stares at him with button eyes
Small talk is not his thing
clears his throat
51 Um, Mr
Brandt, that's just about at the property line, there
don't think we're supposed to get within, what, ten Property line's the poplar
the
Poplar
Well
even if it is, you're just about over it Measure
We hear two pairs of pounding footsteps coming up the street
don't have to measure, you can tell it's
Line's the poplar
He indicates
It's all angles
Gar Brandt turns and goes
turns, reacting to the pounding footsteps
One of the two pairs belongs to who arrives, slowing to a walk, panting, a bookbag over his shoulder
half-block back the pursuing boy also stops running
Husky, shaggy-haired, he watches, scowling, as  goes up the walk to his house
addresses 's retreating back: 52 What's going on
Nothing
As  enters
Judith (ofj) () Yeah
Judith (ofj) Did you go to Sieglestein Schlutz
No, -not yet
Appointment Monday
The thud of a car door outside
heads for the front door, pulling on a jacket
is surprised
Where are you going
'm going to the hole
At five o'clock
He looks out the front-door window
Four girls of 's age are coming up the walk 53 from the car
All have dark hair and big noses
We're stopping at Laurie Kipperstein's house so  can wash my hair
pulls open the door just as the doorbell rings
From the four dark girls: Hi, Mr
Gopnik
You can't wash it here
From somewhere in the house, Jefferson Airplane starts
As she brushes past : Uncle Arthur's in the bathroom
Out in a minute
Judith enters
Are you ready
Huh
We're meeting Sy at Embers
am
Both of us
told you
54 has his arms pinned at his sides by hugging Sy Ableman
How are you
Sy
Hello Judith
Hello Sy
Once Sy releases , all seat themselves at Sy's booth, Judith next to Sy, facing
Thank you for coming,
It's so impawtant that we be able to discuss these things
'm happy to come to Embers, Sy, but, 'm thinking, really, maybe it's best to leave these discussions to the lawyers
Of coss
Legal matters, let the lawyers discuss
Don't mix apples and oranges
've beamed you to see the lawyer
(teeth grit) told you, 'm going Monday
Monday is timely
This isn't-please
-Embers isn't the forum for legalities, you are so right
Hmph
55 No, Judith and  thought merely we should discuss the practicalities, the living arrangements, a situation that will conduce to the comfit of all the parties
This is an issue where no one is at odds
isn't sure where this is leading: Living arrangements
Absolutely
think we all agree, the children not being contaminated by the tension-the most impawtant
We shouldn't put the kids in the middle of this,
The kids aren't- 'm saying "we
" 'm not pointing fingers
No one is playing the "blame game,"
didn't say anyone was
Well let's not play He said, She said, either
wasn't
--- Aw right, well let's just step back, and defuse the situation, glares at Sy
56 Sy smiles at him, sadly
He reaches over and rests a hand on 's hand
find, sometimes, if  count to ten
beat
One
two
three
faw
Or silently
Long beat
Really, to keep things on an even keel, especially now, leading up to 's bar mitzvah- child's bar mitzvah,
Sy and  think it's best if you move out of the house
Move out
It makes eminent sense
Things can't continue as they- Move out
Where would  go
Well, for instance, the Jolly Roger is quite livable
Not expensive, and the rooms are eminently livable
This would allow you to visit the kids
There's convenience in its fava
There's a pool- 57 Wouldn't it make more sense for you to move in with Sy
Judith and Sy gape at him, shocked
After a long beat: , you're jesting
, there is much to accomplish before that can happen
Sy is sadly shaking his head
, ,
think, really, the Jolly Roger is the appropriate coss of action
He shrugs
It has a pool
: It sits in a large fishbowl filled with clear fluid
The brain, alive, pulses
Leads connect it to various pieces of gear outside the fishbowl
Brain and appurtenances sit on a dais of sorts dressed out with bunting
Oddly, the picture is scored with cantorial singing
The brain seems to be giving orders to people who wear imperfectly form-fitting 1950's uniforms of the future
After receiving their instructions the minions of the brain kowtow before it and leave
They are succeeded by two leather-helmeted thugs, big and heavy though lacking muscle definition, who escort a resisting handsome man before the brain
The handsome man, hands tied behind his back, gazes defiantly up at the brain which in some fashion addresses him
We hear blows and voices over the cantorial music: 58 Stop it
Creep fucker
Stop it
'm getting it
'm gonna get it
Wider shows that the brain is on television, which  has muted while he plays the Cantor Youssele Rosenblatt record and drills his torah portion
He and  are in a stand-off, hands tensed to either deliver or ward off blows
Brat
enters
What's going on
() Nothing
She closes the door behind her
What was that
Nothing
How's the haftorah coming
Can you maybe use the hi-fi
What
We hear the doorbell off
indicates the portable record player
59 Can  borrow this
'm taking some stuff
To, you know, the Jolly Rodger
Sure Dad
On , the handsome man shouts defiance at the brain
From off,  projects: Dad
Chinese guy
middle-aged Korean man, well groomed
He wears a nicely cut suit and a jeweled tie- pin
Culcha clash
He bangs his two knuckles together, illustrating
Culcha clash
He faces  in the driveway
's car is half-loaded with open boxes that are haphazardly stuffed with clothing and effects
is leaning against the hood, arms folded, gazing at the man, unimpressed
long beat
Finally he bestirs himself
With all respect, Mr
Park,  don't think it's that
Mr
Park Yes
60 No
It would be a culture clash if it were the custom in your land to bribe people for grades
Mr
Park Yes
So-you're saying it is the custom
Mr
Park No
This is defamation
Grounds for lawsuit
You-let me get this straight-you're threatening to sue me for defaming your son
Mr
Park Yes
But it would- Gar Brandt Is this man bothering you
Gar Brandt stands on the strip of lawn separating the two neighbors
He is giving Mr
Park a hard stare
Is he bothering me
No
We're fine
Thank you, Mr
Brandt
Gar Brandt, not entirely convinced, withdraws, glaring at the Korean
turns back to Mr
Park
, uh
See, if it were defamation there would have to be someone  was defaming him to, or
All right,
let's keep it simple
could pretend the money never appeared
That's not defaming anyone
Mr
Park Yes
And passing grade
Passing grade
Mr
Park Yes
Or you'll sue me
Mr
Park For taking money
So
he did leave the money
Mr
Park This is defamation
stares at him
Look
It doesn't make sense
Either he left the money or he didn't Mr
Park Please
Accept mystery
You can't have it both ways
If Mr
Park Why not
stares
We hear Sidor Belarsky music
62 Sidor Belarsky's singing crosses the cut
The tone arm of 's portable record player rides on a spinning
Wider shows  grading bluebooks at a small formica table crowded into a corner of his motel room
It is a depressingly generic budget motel room of the mid-sixties with cheaply paneled walls, thin carpet, formica night tables, plastic lamps, and twin beds with stained nubby bedspreads
The phone rings
Hello
He brightens
Fine, Mimi, how are you
Uh-huh
No, it's not that bad
It's not that bad
There's a pool
Arthur emerges from an alcove in the dim depth of the room that has a dressing-room mirror and apparently connects to the bathroom
He has a hand towel pressed to the back of his neck
Oh sure, that sounds great
Oh, great, then 'll bring The beach: families are crowded onto the small beach of a freshwater lake, children cavorting, adults lounging, much sun, few umbrellas
Red floats connected by red nylon rope define a swimming area; beyond it people dive from an anchored raft
Splashing and children's laughter slap off the surface of the lake
Above the lake
The beach noise has some distance
It also has a faintly bizarre canyon echo
There is a present, sybillant shushing of breeze in the trees
It is dark here with intense hot spots where sun sifts through the leaf cover
We are close on , who sits very still, leaning back against a tree trunk
63 After a very long beat he slowly exhales, a small amount of smoke feathering out with his breath
Gimme that fucker
passes the joint to Ronnie Nudell, who sits opposite
On a woodless rise above the lake
Each of the separate picnic areas consist of a redwood table and benches placed next to a firepit
Here in the sun both  and Mel Nudell, a man slightly older than , glisten with sweat
Mel, in the background, bounces a bag of charcoal briquettes to spill some into the firepit
sits at the table in the foreground with Mimi Nudell who alone seems unaffected by the heat-or by anything else in the physical environment
Her pale, gravely composed Giacometti face is shaded by a large-brimmed hat
No
Almost a year and a half since Touche Ross let him go
He's very good with numbers
think his, his social skills have held him back
Such a sweet man though
Arthur has a good heart
And he never complains, unlike me
Sometimes  don't give him enough credit
He tried to tell me about this thing he's working on, this, um
The Mentaculus
He says it's a, uh
a probability map
Of the universe
He asked if  could help him publish it
Um, it was a little hard for me to evaluate
64 beat
Does he go out socially at all
He tries
He's been going to the singles mixers at Hillel House
-Well,  should talk, 'm not doing any better
How is Judith
Fine
She's fine
'm the odd man out
Mimi smiles
Sometimes these things just aren't meant to be
And it can take a while before you feel what was always there, for better or worse
never felt it
It was a bolt from the blue
What does that mean
Everything that  thought was one way turns out to be another
Then-it's an opportunity to learn how things really are
broods
Mimi softens
'm sorry- don't mean to sound glib
It's not always easy, deciphering what God is trying to tell you
'll say
But it's not something you have to figure out all by your- self
We're Jews, we have that well of tradition to draw on, to help us understand
When we're puzzled we have all the 65 stories that have been handed down from people who had the same problems
guess
Have you talked to Rabbi Nachtner
Silence
Arthur is climbing the hill from the lake, dripping wet
He projects: Boy
The air out here is magnificent
Mimi, looking at , responds to his dark silence: Why not see him
Mel Nudell has finished spreading and lighting the coals
He now comes and sits next to Mimi, draping an arm over her shoulder
She strokes his hand, still looking at
What's the rabbi gonna tell me
If  knew 'd be the rabbi
He looks at her glumly
She laughs
Life is beautiful,
Nobody's sick
Nobody died
You just need help remembering how to enjoy it
She rests her head against Mel's shoulder
Where are the kids
Woods
Exploring
Uncle Arthur approaches, swim trunks plastered to his thighs, hair dripping, one hand 66 pressing his towel to the back of his neck
If somebody could bottle this air they'd make a million bucks
white title comes up: The First Rabbi Day
sits waiting
door opens and he rises
Oh-Rabbi Scott
Rabbi Scott Ginzler is the junior rabbi, a man in his twenties
Rabbi Scott Hello
thought  was going to see Rabbi Nachtner
Rabbi Scott He was called away on an etz monim: Ruth Brynn's mother is in the hospital and she isn't doing well
Rabbi Nachtner asked me to cover for him-come on in
' few minutes later
sits tensely hunched forward facing Rabbi Scott
And she wants a Gett
long silence
The hum of ventilation
At length: 67 Rabbi Scott what
She wants a- Rabbi Scott Oh, a Gett
Uh-huh, sure
feel like the carpet's been yanked out from under me don't know which end is up
'm not even sure how to react; 'm too confused
Rabbi Scott What reasons did she give
For the rupture
She didn't give-reasons
Just that, oh, you know, things haven't been going well
Rabbi Scott And is that true
guess
don't know
She's usually right about these things
Rabbi Scott Mm-hm
feel so
addled
Rabbi Scott Yes,  can see
was hoping that
Rabbi Nachtner
Rabbi Scott That he would
yes
68 Well, with the benefit of his life experience
no - Rabbi Scott chuckles
Rabbi Scott No, of course not
am the junior rabbi
And it's true, the point-of-view of somebody who's older and perhaps had similar problems might be more valid
And you should see the senior rabbi as well, by all means
Or even Minda if you can get in, he's quite busy
But maybe-can  share something with you
Because  too have had the feeling of losing track of Hashem, which is the problem here
too have forgotten how to see Him in the world
And when that happens you think, well, if  can't see Him, He isn't there any more, He's gone
But that's not the case
You just need to remember how to see Him
Am  right
He rises and goes to the window
mean, the parking lot here
Not much to see
It is a different angle on the same parking lot we saw from the Hebrew school window
But if you imagine yourself a visitor, somebody who isn't familiar with these
autos and such
somebody still with a capacity for wonder
Someone with a fresh
perspective
That's what it is,
Um
Rabbi Scott Because with the right perspective you can see Hashem, you know, reaching into the world
He is in the world, not just in shul
It souunds to me like you're looking at the world, looking at your wife, through tired eyes
It sounds like she's become a sort of
thing
a problem
a thing
Well, she's, she's seeing Sy Ableman
69 Rabbi Scott Oh
She's, they're planning, that's why they want the Gett
Rabbi Scott Oh
'm sorry
It was his idea
Rabbi Scott Well, they do need a Gett to remarry in the faith
But this is life
For you too
You can't cut yourself off from the mystical or you'll be-you'll remain-completely lost
You have to see these things as expressions of God's will
You don't have to like it, of course
The boss isn't always right, but he's always the boss
Rabbi Scott Ha-ha-ha
That's right, things aren't so bad
Look at the parking lot,
Rabbi Scott gazes out, marveling
Just look at that parking lot
: Our low angle looks across the lawn toward the front of the house
Someone's pounding footsteps approach and his feet enter just off the lens and he quickly recedes, cropping in as he races up to the house:
beat later pursuing feet enter, slowing-for  is already mounting the front stoop
's pursuer does not go deep enough to crop in but we might gather from the size eleven sneakers and the cuffed jeans that it is hulking Mike Fagle
70 We hear the front door being flung open and slammed shut, and in the background foyer appears, panting heavily
He gives one glance back toward the front door and then looks at his mother and sister eating soup in the foreground
His sister has a towel wrapped turbanlike around her head
She holds it with one hand to keep it from tipping off when she tilts her head down for the soup
(still panting) We eating already
'm going to the hole
enters the kitchen and sits at the setting across from his sister
He picks up his spoon
Some movement in 's body;  recoils from a kick
Ow
Cut it out
What's going on
The siblings slurp soup, neither answering
After a couple slurps: Isn't Dad eating
He's at the Jolly Roger
Oh yeah
More eating
71 , In a small windowless conference room lined by bookshelves filled with law reference books,  rises to greet Don Milgram, entering
Don
How are you, , Jesus,  am so sorry to be seeing you under these circumstances
Oh, well
always thought you and  were rock solid
This is so terrible,
This is devastating
Well, the way  look at it, it's an opportunity for me to really sit down and figure things out, and, and, look at the world afresh instead of just, you know, settling for the routine, tired old way of looking at things
Don Milgram stares at him
Really
() don't know
Maybe not
Well, legally,  have to warn you, it's never easy for the husband
Unless, of course, there's some question of the wife having violated the marriage contract
Oh no, nothing like that
She's planning to marry Sy Ableman, but they- 72 Sy Ableman
Yes, but they- Esther is barely cold
She passed three years ago
Well, okay, still-this changes the complexion,
Sy Ableman
Not in the sense that
there hasn't been hanky-panky
To my knowledge
Oh
No
'm fairly certain this is not an issue
And in fact they, uh, Judith wants a Gett
Beat
Don stares blankly at
clears his throat
ritual divorce
Oh
So that they can remarry in the faith- Uh-huh, sure, not really a legal matter
Okay
Well
My goodness
How are the children taking it
73 Oh, they're very
He gropes
resilient
Good
Well
On the other thing, the neighbor's property line, 've asked Solomon Schlutz to take a look
There's very little having to do with real estate that'll get by Sol
Okay
Good
How do you- guess 'm a little worried, how do you,  have money pressures and- Our fee structure
We bill by the hour

Gopnik
At home
You can take it here
Oh-eight-oh-nine
punches a button on a row of four on the conference-room telephone
Dad
74 Are you all right
Are you all-is everything- Troop is fuzzy
What
Troop is still fuzzy
stares
Everything okay
Wide on the motel room, dimly lit by weak sun starting to seep in around the curtain
sleeps in one of the twin beds; Uncle Arthur snores in the other
Uncle Arthur's breath snags and tangles on a snorfling inhale and it wakes him, gagging
He blinks, sits up, swings his legs out, gazes blearily around the room
He rises stiffly and heads for the bathroom
stirs
The sound of Uncle Arthur urinating
looks blearily around
stiffly rises
He takes the two steps across the room to the formica desk on which are spread papers for his class
As we hear the sucking sound of the neck evacuator in the bathroom,  sweeps papers together and mechanically stuffs his briefcase
is driving, hollow-eyed, to work
After a long beat of staring, the ka-ching of a bicycle bell
75 's eyes widen and his head swivels, tracking as he overtakes and passes: The bicyclist
young Asian man wearing a white traffic-mask
looks at him in the rear-view
He starts frantically pumping down his window, shouting: You gonna send your mother next
You little bastard
wanna see you
wanna- Crash
He has rear-ended someone
blaring horn, a quick second crash: wrenching steel and spattering glass
He has been rear-ended in turn
The ka-ching of the bicycle
Park cycles past without looking
enters the outer office, hugging his paper-stuffed briefcase to his chest
The secretary is just crooking the phone into her shoulder
Oh-Professor Gopnik
It's Dick Dutton again
() Dick Dutton
' He sits in and picks up the phone
76 Hello
Hello, Mr
Gopnik, this is Dick Dutton from the Columbia Record Club
'm calling because it is now, what, four months and we have yet to receive your first payment
-there's some mistake
'm not a member of the Columbian Record Club
Sir, you are Lawrence Gopnik of 1425 Flag Avenue South
No,  live at the Jolly Roger
Excuse me
No, -well, yes, okay
Yes you are Lawrence Gopnik
Okay
Okay means
Okay, yes, Lawrence Gopnik, yes
Okay, well, you received your twelve introductory albums and you have been receiving the monthly main selection for four months now- "The monthly main selection
" Is that a record
didn't 77 ask for any records
To receive the monthly main selection you do nothing
- That's right
haven't done anything
Yes, that's why you receive the monthly main selection
The last But - The last one was Santana Abraxis
You- didn't ask for Santana Abraxis
You request the main selection at the retail price by doing nothing
It is automatically mailed to you
Plus shipping and handling
You're about to- can't afford a new record every month
haven't asked - You're about to get Cosmo's Factory, sir
The June main selection
And you haven't- Look, something is very wrong
don't want Santana Abraxis
've just been in a terrible auto accident
Beat
'm sorry sir
78 Well-thank you
But - Are you okay
Yes
Yes, no one was hurt
Okay
Good
Well, you had fourteen days to listen to Santana Abraxis and return it if you weren't completely satisfied
You did nothing
And now you- didn't ask for Santana Abraxis
didn't listen to Santana Abraxis
didn't do anything
The secretary is sticking her head in
Sir
Sir
Please
We can't make you listen to the record
We- Professor Gopnik, your son
He said it's urgent
Okay, look,  have to call you back, this is, this is 'm sorry
He irritably punches a button on the bottom row of four
Dad
Did you join the Columbia Record Club
79 Silence
Um
, this is completely unacceptable
can't afford to- Okay Dad, but you gotta come home
Is it  Troop
Huh
No no
Mom's real upset
enters
We can hear weeping, semi-hysterical, from somewhere in the house
's Voice Dad
Yes
She enters
Does this mean  can't go to the hole tonight
Does what mean-what happened
Sy Ableman died in a car crash
's Voice 80 Hey Dad
What
enters
So are you coming back home
Can you fix the aerial
The weeping, off, grows louder and more hysterical
What
It's still, you know
Loud wailing
After a beat in black, a white title: The Second Rabbi The title fades
' We are close on
He sits hunched forward, hands clasped in front of him, staring at the floor, sadly shaking his head
After a long beat: It seems like she's asking an awful lot
But then- don't know
Somebody has to pay for Sy's funeral
Rabbi Nachtner, sitting opposite, nods
Rabbi Nachtner 81 Uh-huh
His own estate is in probate
But why does it have to be me
Or is it wrong to complain
says it is
But 'm so strapped for cash right now-paying for the Jolly Roger, and  wrecked the car, and 's bar mitzvah
Rabbi Nachtner Something like this-there's never a good time
don't know where it all leaves me
Sy's death
Obviously it's not going to go back like it was
Rabbi Nachtner Mm
Would you even want that,
No, -well yeah
Sometimes
Or- don't know;  guess the honest answer is  don't know
What was my life before
Not what  thought it was
What does it all mean
What is Hashem trying to tell me, making me pay for Sy Ableman's funeral
Rabbi Nachtner Mm
And-did  tell you  had a car accident the same time Sy had his
The same instant, for all  know
Is Hashem telling me that Sy Ableman is me, or we are all one or something
Rabbi Nachtner How does God speak to us: it's a good question
You know Lee Sussman
Sussman
think -yeah
Rabbi Nachtner Did he ever tell you about the goy's teeth
82 No
-What goy
Rabbi Nachtner So Lee is at work one day; you know he has the orthodontic practice there at Texa-Tonka
Uh-huh
Rabbi Nachtner Right next to the Gold Eagle Cleaners
We cut to: It dominates a small suburban strip mall
Rabbi Nachtner continues in voice-over as we cut to a smoked glass door that identifies Leon Sussman,
Rabbi Nachtner He's making a plaster mold-it's for corrective bridge work-in the mouth of one of his patients
close shot of a man's mouth biting down on two horse-shoe shaped troughs-an upper and a lower-that overflow an oozing white goo
Russell Kraus
He's a delivery dispatcher for the Star and Tribune with chronic mandicular deterioration
The grinding guitar solo from Jefferson Airplane's "Bear Melt" scores the narrative
The patient opens his mouth as a hand enters to grab the upper tray
The reverse shows Dr
Sussman, a balding middle-aged man, dressed in the the high- collared white smock of an oral surgeon
He carries the mold over to a drying table
Kraus is twisted over the side of the chair spitting into the water-swirled spit-sink
Well, the mold dries and Lee is examining it one day 83 before fabricating an appliance
Another day: Dr
Sussman is sitting at his desk examining the lower mold
He notices something unusual
He notices something unusual
Sussman reaches up for the loupe attached to his eyeglasses
There seems to be something engraved on the inside of the patient's lower incisors
He flips down the loupe
His eyes are hugely magnified as he stares
Sure enough, it's writing
Sussman squints
His point-of-view: Tiny incised Hebrew letters: smli12nn He confirms with a nod
Rabbi Nachtner This in a goy's mouth,
The Rabbi's narrative continues
Rabbi Nachtner Tet resh nun lamed nun shin tsayin
What is that-tiranu linoshets
"Help me"
Is that what it says
Or is it a name
It's not Kraus's name
Sussman flips the loupe away and looks off, haunted
He rises
He checks the mold, just to be sure
Oh, it's there all 84 right
dental mirror is dipped into the horse-shoe-shaped hardened paste of the mold
It pans tiny letters that stand out in relief, right-side around in the mirror: yw
rin Sussman leans back, thinking
He calls the goy back on the pretense of needing additional measurements for the appliance
Close on Kraus grinning as he shakes Sussman's hand in the reception area
Sussman gestures to invite Kraus back to the examination room
Sussman chats, affecting nonchalance
In the examination room, leaning over Kraus in the chair, the dentist is indeed chatting with seeming casualness
Notice any other problems with your teeth
Anything peculiar, et cetera
Sussman takes a dental mirror
No
No
No
Visited any other dentist recently
He looks in Kraus' mouth with the mirror: Ym nn Sussman frowns
There it is
"Help me"
He leans back
Sussman goes home
Can Sussman eat
No
Sussman sits at the kitchen table, untouched food in front of him
His wife chats volubly while Sussman stares into space
Can Sussman sleep
No
85 Sussman is in bed, pyjamas buttoned to the neck, staring at the ceiling
What does it mean
Is it a message for him, for Sussman
And if so, from whom
Does Sussman know
Sussman doesn't know
Back in the dental office Sussman pulls boxes containing other molds off the shelf
Sussman looks at the molds of his other patients, goy and Jew alike, seeking other messages
He finds none
He looks in his own mouth
Close on Sussman in front of a mirror straining to see the reflection of a reflection of the dental mirror he holds in his own mouth
Nothing
His wife's mouth
Sussman's wife lies asleep on her back, her mouth open, snoring softly
Sussman, in pyjamas but with his glasses on and loupe in place, lies over her in bed, supporting himself with one arm thrown across her body
He leans awkwardly in, carefully lowering a dental mirror into his wife's open mouth
Nothing
It is a singular event
mystery
The Jefferson Airplane guitar solo is heating up
But Sussman is an educated man
Not the world's greatest sage, maybe, no Rabbi Minda, but he knows a thing or two from the Zohar and the Caballah
He knows every Hebrew letter has its numeric equivalent
Sussman, still in his pyjamas is sitting at the kitchen table scribbling on a tablet of lined paper
Close on the paper: the Hebrew letters have been transcribed into their numeric : 496-2428 Nachtner continues in voice-over: 86 Seven digits-a phone number maybe
Sussman reaches for the phone
He hesitates a moment, then dials
Sussman dials
It rings
In a grocery store
man in short sleeves reaches for the phone
Rabbi Nachtner It's a Red Owl grocery store in Bloomington
Hello
Do you know a goy named Kraus
Russel Kraus
The store manager is shaking his head
Where have  called
The Red Owl
In Bloomington
Thanks so much
The manager, puzzled, hangs up
Sussman thinks, am  supposed to go to the Red Owl, to receive a further sign
He goes
In the parking lot of the Red Owl Sussman, wearing a short-brimmed fedora, emerges from his car
It is an unremarkable grocery store in a suburban mall
It's a Red Owl
Inside Sussman, in his fedora, gazes around
Groceries
What have you
service alley behind the store: dumpsters, wind-blown garbage, Sussman looking
On the wall behind the store, a stain
There is an old, rather nondescript stain of some liquid splatted against the back wall and long since dribbled away
Could be a nun sofit
Or maybe not
The parking lot again: Sussman gets back in his car
87 Sussman goes home
What does it mean
He has to find out, if he's ever to sleep again
Sussman again, in pyjamas buttoned to the neck, lies in his bed staring at the ceiling
He goes to see the Rabbi, Nachtner
He comes in and sits right where you're sitting now
Sussman is indeed sitting across from Rabbi Nachtner, just where we've seen sitting
What does it mean, Rabbi
Is it a sign from Hashem
"Help me
" , Sussman, should be doing something to help this goy
Doing what
The teeth don't say
should know without asking
Or maybe 'm supposed to help people generally-lead a more righteous life
Is the answer in cabalah
In torah
Or is there even a question
Tell me, Rabbi-what can such a sign mean
Nachtner-not the narrating Nachtner but the Nachtner in the scene-nods and considers
Staring at the Rabbi
He waits a good beat
He prompts: So what did you tell him
The Rabbi seems surprised by the question
Rabbi Nachtner Sussman
Yes
Rabbi Nachtner Is it
relevant
88 Well-isn't that why you're telling me
Rabbi Nachtner Mm
Okay
Nachtner says, look
We are back in the scene, narrated by voice-over, of the Rabbi silently advising the fretful Sussman
The teeth, we don't know
sign from Hashem, don't know
Helping others, couldn't hurt
's voice-over question plays over Sussman asking the same thing: (of]) But is that what it meant
-tet resh nun lamed nun shin isayin, was it "Help me"
or a number
Or was it Rabbi Nachtner (off) We can't know everything
Sussman stares blankly at the Rabbi
beat
(of]) It sounds like you don't know Mthing
Smiling equably at
He reacts to the ejaculation with a shrug
scowls
Why even tell me the story
Rabbi Nachtner () First  should tell you, then  shouldn't
89 , exasporated, changes tack: What happened to Sussman
In his office
Working on different patients as the Rabbi resumes his voice-over
Rabbi Nachtner What would happen
Not much
He went back to work
For a while he checked every patient's teeth for new messages; didn't see any; in time, he found he'd stopped checking
Sussman, at home, chats with his wife over dinner
These questions that are bothering you, -maybe they're like a toothache
We feel them for a while, then they go away
Sussman lies in bed sleeping, smiling, an arm thrown across his wife
Dissatisfied
don't want it to just go away
want an answer
Rabbi Nachtner The answer
Sure
We all want the answer
But Hashem doesn't owe us the answer,
Hashem doesn't owe us anything
The obligation runs the other way
Why does he make us feel the questions if he's not gonna give us any answers
Rabbi Nachtner smiles at  for a beat
90 Rabbi Nachtner He hasn't told me
rubs his face, frustrated
last question occurs to him: And what happened to the goy
Rabbi Nachtner's forebearing smile fades into puzzlement
Rabbi Nachtner The goy
Who cares
: The modern synagogue grafted onto a patch of prairie
An echoing voice rings out: Sy Ableman was a serious man
In close-up he gazes around, weighing the effect of the words just delivered
After a long beat during which he seeks to establish eye contact with as much of his audience as possible: Rabbi Nachtner Sy Ableman was a man devoted to his community
Wider shows Rabbi Nachtner up on the bema
He and the congregation face each other across a casket down at floor level
to torah study
sits among the congregants, his gaze fixed on a point off
91 to his beloved wife Esther until, three years ago, she passed
's point-of-view:  is visible from 3 behind
She sits a few rows ahead looking grimly up at the rabbi
and to his duty, as he saw it
Where does such a man go
tzadik-who knows, maybe even a lamid vovnik-a man beloved by all, a man who despised the frivolous
Could such a serious man
simply
disappear
The words echo
Again the rabbi gazes around, as if awaiting answer
: We speak of 'olam ha-ba, the World to Come
Not heaven
Not what the gentiles think of as afterlife
"'olam ha-ba
" What is 'olam ha-ba
Where is 'olam ha-ba
Well: it is not a geoaraphic place, certainly
Like-Canada
Murmured chuckles from the congregation
Nor is it the eretz zavat chalav ood'vash-the land flowing with milk and honey, for we are not promised a personal reward, a gold star, a first-class  lounge where we get milk and cookies to eternity
More chuckles
'olam ha-ba
is in the bosom of Abraham
'olam ba- ba is in the soul of this community which nurtured Sy Ableman and to which Sy Ableman now returns
That's right, he returns
Because he still inspires us Ableman returns
Because his memory instructs us Ableman returns
Because his thoughts illuminate our days and ways Sy Ableman returns
The frivolous man may vanish without a ripple but Sy Ableman
Sy Ableman was a serious man
92 sob echoes through the sanctuary
looks at Judith, who stifles further sobs with a handkerchief
As you know, the mourner's kaddish does not mention the dead
It praises Hashem; it praises what abides
And Sy Ableman, whose spirit will continue to assist us in tikkun olam, is with us even now, a serious man who would say as we now say Yiskadal v'yiskadash sh'may rabah
The congregation begins to chant along but it and Judith's weeping are cut off by: The front door to the Gopnik home
, still in his suit from shul and wearing a yarmulka, opens the door
He recoils in surprise edged with fear
Reverse: two uniformed policemen
1 Arthur Gopnik
is momentarily dumb
Inside the house we can see a corner of a card table set up in the living room with food laid out on it
sits with her back to us, head wrapped by a towel-turban
Arthur, on the far side of the table, his balding head domed by a yarmul- ka, half-leans out so that he may sneak looks toward the men at the door without totally revealing himself
From somewhere down the hall come Judith's muffled sobs
Are you Arthur Gopnik
'm
Laurence Gopnik
Cop Do you go by the name Arthur Gopnik
No
93 1 Is that Arthur Gopnik
Arthur ducks away
From inside the living room: (off) Dad
What's going on
Can you tell me what's going on
We're sitting shiva here
1 You're what
religious observance
We're
bereaved
The cop standing behind gazes in over his partner's shoulder
2 Who died
My wife's um
it's a long story
1 Look
Tell Gopnik-you know, Arthur Gopnik-he's breaking the law
We're not arresting him now but next time we will
Gambling is against the law in this state
That's just the way it is
All right
Go back to your
2 Sorry, sir
minute later
The family-except for Judith, whose weeping continues off-sits around the card table
long beat
At length: 94 Dad, we get Channel 4 now but not Channel 7
Arthur, how could you do that to this family
On Sy's
on Sy's- It's a victimless crime
That doesn't make it right
And you- He won a lot of money, Dad
The Mentaculus really works
's gaze swings onto his son
You knew about it
Well, um
They must have finked me out
They knew  could just keep on winning, so a couple weeks ago they blackballed me, and now they've- What did you do with the money you won
Silence
Arthur sneaks a look at
looks back and forth between them
What's going on
Arthur shrugs
95 didn't want it
said he could use it Unfair
What have you been- What's unfair is these guys saying  can't play in their card game
Why give him the money
You know what he spends it on
(knowing nod) know about the records
Records
You think he buys records from Mike Fagle
Movement in 's body;  recoils from a kick
Ow
Little brat
Hey
What's going on
At least 'm not saving up for a nose job
What
Brat
Nobody in this house is getting a nose job
You got that
96 Ali
Struck by a thought he leaps up and bolts from the room
You weren't excused
We're still talking
What a brat
What was this card game, Arthur
Some goys run a private game
We hear the  go on down the hall and the theme from  Troop
think they're Italians
, what's going on
He rises
enters to look down at 's back
Beyond him  Troop flickers on the
We're sitting Shiva
' , sitting across from Don, has his head buried in his arms on the desktop
She's retained Barney Silver at Tuchman, Marsh
This is a, uh--this is an aggressive firm,
97 () Uh-huh
These are not pleasant people
Judith is free of course to retain whoever she
take it you don't talk to her
raises his head, squinting against the light
It's hard
think she emptied our bank account
tried to ask her about it, very civilly
Mm
She, uh
Yeah, yeah you better open an account in your name only, put your paychecks in there from here on out
Til we know where we stand
Can
Oh, absolutely
That's not, um, dishonest
Oh, absolutely
You, uh- hate to say this, but  think she's also been sneaking cash out of my wallet
Ouch
Well, yes, this is definitely, um, adversarial
The 98 first thing we-are you all right
is wincing as he rubs a forearm under his shirtsleeve
Just a sunburn
've been spending a lot of time on the roof
For
perspective
He trails off and his head drops back down onto his arms
Don gives him an appraising look
Have you seen the Rabbi
(muffled again) Talked to Nachtner
You should talk to Minda
They told me Minda doesn't do pastoral work any more
Just
ceremonial
Mm
Congratulates the bar mitzvah boy every week, so forth
nods miserably
That's too bad
very wise man, Minda
raises his head
Getting old
Very old
No, me
99 , you're fine
It's a bump in the road
Was Nachtner helpful at all
gives a helpless shrug
Don rolls his eyes
What-did he tell you about the goy's teeth
knock on the door
Don projects: Yeah
The door cracks open
pipe edges in, followed by a peeking face: Solomon Schlutz
Oh, good
Sol, come on in
Solomon Schlutz is a large man in shirtsleeves and suspenders
He has the smooth impassive face of a sphynx with a pipe clenched in its teeth
He glides into the room, a sheaf of files tucked under one arm
Sol has been looking into the property-line issues
Solomon Schlutz seats himself at the conference table and starts sorting and arranging the files into three piles
It seems that you do have a real problem with the original survey
But Sol seems to think there's some kind of nifty way for us to-well,  haven't heard it myself, 'll let Sol map it out
Solomon Schlutz continues to arrange the files, his eye occasionally lingering on a specific page
When at length he is finished he carefully justifies the edges of the closest pile, takes the pipe out of his mouth, gives  a smile that seems to take some effort, and then taps the pipe in a large glass ashtray
He looks up again at , this time shocked
His stunned look on  holds for a long beat
returns a bewildered look
100 Solomon Schlutz, staring at  as if he were some sort of monster, emits one barking : Solomon Schlutz Gah
His stare holds
He reddens
Sol
Solomon Schlutz's face now passes from the red end of the spectrum to the purple
Solomon Schlutz Nnnnff
The pipe clatters out of his hand
The hand grabs at his own shirt front
Glufffl
Now his head pitches back
His backflung weight and twisting body send his chair tipping over, one hand still clutching at his chest while the other frantically waves
He disappears behind the conference table and lands with a floor-shaking thump
His writhing and gurgling remain audible
Sol
Sol
Don Milgram has risen to look down at his fallen colleague; now he flings open the conference room door and bellows into the office: An ambulance
Quick
Somebody call an ambulance secretary looks in and screams
Solomon Schlutz Garf
Nnlogl
101 walks into the outer office clutching his briefcase, eyes wide, shell-shocked
The secretary is at her typewriter but holding the phone, one hand covering its mouthpiece

sits in heavily behind his desk
beat
He opens the top left desk drawer
He withdraws the bulging white envelope and opens its flap
He runs a finger over the wad of bills
He looks up, startled
Arlen Finkle stands in the doorway
As you know, the tenure committee meets-are you all right
sits frozen with the white envelope in his hands
'm
fine
Arlen Finkle 'm sorry
know you've hit a rough patch
Thank you
'm fine
He puts the envelope in the desk drawer and closes it
102 Arlen Finkle Uh-huh
Well
As you know, the tenure committee meets next Wednesday to make its final determinations
If '- Arlen,  am not an evil man
Arlen looks at him, shocked
Arlen Finkle Of course not
am not- Arlen Finkle We don't make moral judgments
went to the Aster Art once

Arlen Finkle It's okay, , we don't need to know
The Tenure - It wasn't even erotic
Although it was, in a way
Arlen Finkle It's all right,
Believe me

Okay
Arlen Finkle Okay
Okay
We, uh, we decide on Wednesday, so if there's anything you want to submit in support of your tenure application, we should have it by then
That's all
103 Submit
What
What do you- Arlen Finkle Well
Anything
Published work
Anything else you've done outside of the institution
Any work that we might not be aware of

Arlen Finkle Uh-huh
Those anonymous- Arlen Finkle Yes,  know
Yes

Okay
Okay

Don't worry
Doing nothing is not bad
Ipso facto

104 We are close over 's shoulder as he scribbles symbols onto the chalkboard
and that means
so that
from which we derive
His glances back toward the class show that he is wearier, baggier-eyed, more haggard than ever
There is also something odd about his posture
He writes smaller and smaller so as to finish before hitting the right edge of the chalkboard
and also
which lets us
and
Wider as he finishes and straightens up, revealing that he has been stooping to write across the very bottom of the board
The equation covers every inch of the classroom-wide three-paneled chalkboard is an off balance figure at the right edge of frame
Reverse on the class: staring
Okay
claps chalk dust from his hands
The Uncertainty Principle
It proves we can't ever really know
what's going on
bell sounds
The students start to shake off their stupor and rise
projects over the wallah: So it shouldn't bother you
Not being able to figure anything out
Although you will be responsible for this on the mid-term
The thinning crowd gradually reveals one person still seated: Sy Ableman
He wears a prayer shawl and yarmulka
105 does not seem surprised to see him
Did you follow that
Sy Ableman Of coss
Except that  know what's going on
How do you explain
Well, it might be that, in, you know, in 'olam ha-bah- Sy Ableman Excuse me
Not the issue
In this world,
He nods at the chalkboard
'll concede that it's subtle
It's clevva
But at the end of the day, is it convincing
Well-yes it's convincing
It's a proof
It's mathematics
Sy Ableman Excuse me,
Mathematics
Is the art of the possible
's brow furrows
don't think so
The art of the possible, that's
can't remember
something else
Sy Ableman 'm a serious man,
know that
So if 've got it wrong, what do - Sy Ableman holds up one hand to silence him
Sy Ableman So simple,
See Minda
106 know,  want to see Minda
want to see Minda
They told me that oonh
Without our having seen him rise or cross the room Sy Ableman has body-slammed into the chalkboard
Now he grabs  by the hair and whips his head against the equation
As he slams 's head, again and again, the chalkboard chatters and the fringes on Sy's tallis dance
Sy Ableman See Minda
See Minda
fucked your wife, seriously fucked her
That's what's going on
See Minda
Very close on his eyes as they open
His head is on a pillow
Dull early light
hissing sound
looks blearily over
On the vanity table just outside the motel bathroom door sits Uncle Arthur's cyst evacuator
Its waggling hose snakes into the cracked bathroom door as the machine hisses
On a doorpost
hand enters to knock
long beat
The person knocking gives up and his footsteps start to go away just as the door opens to reveal an attractive woman the sunbathing neighbor, now wearing plaid shorts and a buttoned white blouse
Her point-of-view: , frozen halfway down the stoop, head turned back up toward the door
Mr
Gopnik
107 Oh
Hello, Mrs
Samsky
knocked, and then thought you weren't here
, uh
Mrs
Samsky's voice is soft and breathy: Mrs
Samsky It just took me a second to get to the door
was out back
stands nodding
He seems to need prompting
Mrs
Samsky does: Can  help you
Wanna come in
No, - One hand on the door, she steps back
Mrs
Samsky It's cooler
Oh
Okay
just wanted to let you know
He is entering
After the outside glare the house does indeed seem cooler looks around the living room, dim but neat
Wavering light sifts through closed vertical blinds which drift and click over floor-vented air-conditioning
Mrs
Samsky closes the door, shutting out all sound from outside
've noticed that Mr
Samsky isn't around, and - Mrs
Samsky He travels
108 Uh-huh
Yeah,  never seem to see him, so  thought should let you know, since you're somewhat new here, if you ever have, whatever, chores that you'd, um, or just help with something-'ve decided to help others-you know, in a neighborly way
She gazes at him with the least hint of a smile and waits for the speech to dribble away to silence
In the ensuing beat, quiet except for the clicking of the blinds, she is perfectly still
Finally, only her mouth moves: Mrs
Samsky How thoughtful
shrugs off the compliment
Oh it's nothing
It's just good to know your neighbors
And to help
Help others
Although  don't care much for my neighbors on the other side,  must say
Mrs
Samsky lets another smiling silence pass before responding
Mrs
Samsky Goys, aren't they
Mm
Very much so
Maybe it's not fair to judge;  have to admit - Mrs
Samsky Won't you sit down
Oh
Um
Okay
Thank you
Mrs
Samsky Iced tea
have some
She is already turning to the kitchen
109 Okay
He watches her and reacts to: The backs of her thighs
The flesh retains the broad cross-hatch of her lawn chair
She disappears into the kitchen, but calls out: Mrs
Samsky don't see you around much, either
Yes
Actually  haven't been home a lot recently, , uh, my wife and  are, uh, well, she's got me staying at the Jolly Roger, the little motel there on- Mrs
Samsky is reentering with two tall glasses of iced tea beaded with moisture
The click of the ice cubes joins the clicking of the blinds
Mrs
Samsky You're in the doghouse, huh
She hands him a glass as she sits on the couch next to him, not invasively close, one bare leg folded onto the couch, the other draped over it
Yeah, that's an understatement  guess,  -thank you-, - Mrs
Samsky Do you take advantage of the new freedoms
stares at her
Mrs
Samsky gazes back
Her look displays equanimity; his, not
: What do you mean
Her look holds for one more beat and then she swivels and opens the drawer of an end table
110 She turns back with a joint
Mrs
Samsky It's something  do
For recreation
She lights it
That's
Marijuana
Mrs
Samsky Mm-hmm
She hands the joint over
You'll find you'll need the iced tea
handles the bitty cigarette with trepidation
Is it
well
okay
Some minutes later
They drift and click in the air blown from the floor vents
stares at them
After a long beat: Maybe Rabbi Scott was right
Mrs
Samsky Who's Rabbi Scott
The junior rabbi
Mrs
Samsky The junior rabbi
111 Another long beat
Neither person feels compelled to speak as the blinds click
The joint makes another trip back and forth
: What did he say
He spoke of
perception
All my problems are just
just a
a mere
He trails off, listening
Is that a siren
Mrs
Samsky No
Some people get a little paranoid when they
Holy cow
That is a siren
The Samsky's door opens and  stumbles out
He stares
The police car has stopped in front of his own house next door, lights still flashing
Two cops are going up the walk with Uncle Arthur between them in handcuffs
, stunned, walks woodenly toward his house
Hey
Neither the cops nor Uncle Arthur has heard
They have rung the doorbell and now disappear inside
projects louder- -and starts to sprint
Mrs
Samsky has emerged from her house behind
takes the stoop steps two at a time
His door stands open and the theme from 112 Troop issues from within
Just inside the two policeman stand with their backs to us and handcuffed Uncle Arthur in between
The three men face , who addresses them, projecting over the music from the
Sort of
He sleeps on the couch
This is crazy
This brings the cops' look around
Uncle Arthur also turns, shamefaced, to
Does this man live here
didn't know what to tell them
They asked for my address
It's just mathematics
You can't arrest a man for mathematics
didn't know whether to say  lived here or at the Jolly Roger
You know this man
figured this would sound more
don't know
Mrs
Samsky appears behind  on the stoop
Dad, why is Uncle Arthur in handcuffs
It's all a mistake
mean, not a mistake, a, a- 113 Hello, Mrs
Samsky
-a miscarriage- Does this man live here
He sleeps on the couch
Look
What did he do
Nothing
didn't do anything
It folds out
Dad sleeps on a cot
You can't just- Sir, we picked this man up at the North Dakota
is brought up short
The North Dakota
But  didn't do anything
Dad, what's the North Dakota
Solicitation
Sodomy
Very serious
114 The North Dakota
We hold on 's shocked reaction as we hear , off: What's Sodomy, Dad
He wears a black armband
He sits thinking, bouncing steepled fingers against his nose
: What does Arthur say
He says he didn't do anything
Uh-huh
He says
he just went in for a drink
Uh-huh
Long beat
Does Arthur drink
No
Uls-huh
He says he was confused
115 Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Well
The North Dakota
Well
You'll need a criminal attorney
Okay
Who's- Ron Meshbesher
Is he good
Ron is very good
's gaze wanders
He becomes wistful
don't understand
He goes to mixers at the Hillel House
Mm
beat
would call Ron Meshbesher
Is he expensive
Ron is not cheap
Don focuses on
Cheerful change of subject: 's bar mitzvah is
This week
116 This shabbas
Great
He nods
It'll be okay
Try to relax,
Try to relax
' is making strenuous love to Mrs
Samsky
Mrs
Samsky So good
so good
She rolls on top of  to straddle him and, still humping, she lights a mentholated cigarette
moans
Oh my God, Mrs
Samsky
Beyond her head  can see the low cottage-cheese ceiling of the bedroom
Outside we can hear Gar Brandt mowing the lawn
Suddenly we hear muffled laughter and the front door opening
panics
He hisses: Who is it
Footsteps are approaching along the hall
Mrs
Samsky doesn't react; she looks calmly down at  even as the bedroom door opens behind her and Park walks in wearing a traffic mask
is mortified: , please
Wait outside
Mrs
Samsky blows smoke into 's eyes
The screen goes black
Close on  as he opens his eyes
shadow falls across his face
His point-of-view: a wooden plank is just being slid into place over his head
The bang of hammer on nailhead
In the black: 117 Sy Ableman's Voice Nailing it down is so impawtant
We hear the chanting of Kaddish and the sound of dirt hitting the top of the coffin
It drums a steady rhythm
Grace Slick's voice enters: "Somebody to Love
" In a break in the vocals right before the chorus: Mrs
Samsky's Voice It's something we do
For recreation
On the chorus downbeat, a crescent moon pops into the black
Gar Brandt traverses the sky, pushing his lawn mower
cow flies the opposite way
Stars twinkle
Sy Able- man walks across the sky dressed like a shtetl elder, a bindlestick over one shoulder
bolts upright in bed
Sudden quiet
Uncle Arthur is snoring in the tatty motel room's other bed
title burns in: He stands looking down in low shot
Above him is cheap Johnson-Armstrong dropped ceiling
Please
need help
've already talked to the other rabbis
Please
Reverse shows an elderly eastern European woman seated behind a desk, looking up at won't take much of his time
need help
need Minda
It's not about 's bar mitzvah
My boy This coming shabbas
Very joyous event
That's all fine
It's, it's more about myself, 've
've had quite a bit of tsuris lately
Marital problems
Professional
You name it
This is not a frivolous request
This is a serious- 'm a serious-'m, uh, 've tried to be a serious man
You 118 know, tried to do right, be a member of the community, raise the, raise the, , , they both go to school, Hebrew school, a good breakfast
Well,  goes to Hebrew school,  doesn't have time, she mostly
washes her hair
Apparently there are several steps involved
But you don't have to tell Minda that
Just tell him  need help
Please
need help
He lapses into silence, staring at the secretary
She stares inscrutably back
After a moment she rises, goes to the door behind her, opens it, shuffles into the dimness of an inner office
cranes to see past her
Her own body and the dimness interfere with a good view of the figure hunched behind the desk
The man is old and bent
His desktop is empty
Murmured voices in Hebrew
clock ticks in the outer office
looks around, waiting
Mysterious Judaica adorns the outer office
The old woman is shuffling back
She closes the door on the motionless rabbi and sits down, heavily, behind her own desk
The rabbi is busy
He didn't look busy
As she starts shuffling papers: He's thinking
Sidor Belarsky comes in at the cut
119 We are booming down on , asleep in bed
We hear weeping, soft, suppressed
stirs
He opens his eyes
After a groggy beat he reacts to the weeping
He looks over
Arthur
Arthur
Arthur is a dim mound on the next bed
His weeping continues
For no reason  continues to keep his voice to a whisper: Arthur
What's wrong
No answer
Arthur
It'll be okay
Arthur
We'll get Ron Meshbesher
It'll be okay- Shockingy loud, the scream is hard to interpret
Arthur flings off his bedclothes
He leaps from the bed and runs to the door
In boxer shorts and undershirt he flings the door open and runs out of the room
Arthur
leaps from his bed, also in his underwear
He goes to the door but pauses, peering cautiously outside
Satisfied that the courtyard is deserted, he plunges into it
The courtyard/parking lot is hardlit by ghastly mercury vapor lights
The pool, surrounded by chain-link fence, has been drained
Its white concrete interior is cracked 120 and weedy
Uncle Arthur is hunched weeping in a corner of the pool enclosure
() Arthur
He opens the creaking gate and scurries over to Arthur
You've got to pull yourself together
Arthur is suddenly angry
His voice bounces off the concrete: It's all shit,
It's all shit
Arthur
Don't use that word
It's all fucking shit
Arthur
Come on
Look at everything Hashem has given you
And what do get
get fucking shit
Arthur
What do  have
live at the Jolly Roger
You've got a family
You've got a job
Hashem hasn't given me bupkes
It's not fair to blame Hashem, Arthur
Please
Sometimes -please calm down-sometimes you have to help your- self
121 Don't blame me
You fucker
Arthur
Please
Hashem hasn't given me shit
Now  can't even play cards
He starts weeping again
looks around
Arthur
This isn't the right forum
Please
Not by the pool
Arthur weeps
Arthur
It's okay
It's okay
and Arthur are driving
We are looking at the two of them square through a windshield in which towering conifers stream by in reflection
It seems to be a glorious day
Is this it
Both men peer out
think so
yeah
there
He indicates the road ahead
The old-fashioned kind with wooden fingers pointing the different directions
One points toward
122 We tip off the sign as 's car passes and recedes
There is a canoe strapped to its roof
Beautiful, wooded, remote
The car is parked at water's edge, having backed down a lane of two tracks worn through the undergrowth
and Arthur are lowering the canoe into water
Okay
He straightens
Arthur straightens
hugs him
Look
They separate and  pulls a white envelope from his pocket and gives it to Arthur
This'll help you get back on your feet
Arthur looks into the envelope
Oh my God
Where did you get this
Doesn't matter
When you- This is a lot of money
It should get you started
This is a lot of money
Are you sure you don't need it
Arthur, 'm fine
Come on, get in
When you're settled
123 Arthur climbs into the canoe
let me know how to get in touch
He helps push the boat off
Arthur is twisted around, looking back
As he drifts off: Are you sure this is okay
It's fine
It's fine
waves
Arthur waves bravely back, then turns to pick up the oars couple of strokes and he turns back again with a last thought
He calls: 'm sorry
What  said last night
know
It's okay
lingering look from Arthur, and then he turns back to row
gunshot
Blood spurts from the back of Uncle Arthur's neck
He slumps forward, dead
Good shot
looks wildly around
He sees: Gar Brandt and Mitch in their camo fatigues, hard to pick out in the foliage
They are looking off toward the canoe, Mitch just lowering his rifle
Gar Brandt's look swings around, into the lens
He points at us: There's another Jew, son
124 Mitch swings his rifle toward us
He fires
Gasping awake in the motel room
He looks around
It is dawn
Arthur sits on the edge of his bed in his underwear, staring off into space, slackjawed, vacant-eyed, drained
gazes around the room, waiting for things to fall into place
Finally, blearily: Were we
out at the pool last night
Arthur, still staring off, responds in a flat, empty voice: Yes
'm sorry
blinks sleep away
After a beat: It's shabbas
Another beat
Arthur heaves a deep sigh
'll go drain my cyst
125 Day
two-urinal, two-stall men's room of old tile and yellowed fixtures
We are low
One of the stall doors is closed
Under it we see the dress shoes and dress pants of two young men standing inside
We hear a long sucking inhale
Ronnie Nudell's Voice Gimme that fucker
loudly projected echoing male voice: Ya'amod hab'rayshit
, seated in the second pew next to his parents and sister and Uncle Arthur, rises and shuffles along the row to the aisle
His eyes are wide and red-rimmed
The prelapped voice was his call to the torah
All eyes in the congregation, which fills the large sanctuary, are on him
In great echoing silence he walks to the steps on the right side of the bema and climbs
The right-side lectern is surrounded by a gaggle of old Jewish men
They busy themselves with the preparation of the pair of scrolls on the lectern, rolling them, pausing, rolling some more, muttering prayers, kissing the scrolls by means of their tsitsim
They pay  no attention
takes his place centered behind the lectern
His chin comes up to the bottom of the reading platform
Men continue to mutter prayers around him
pair of hands appear on his shoulders from behind
looks down at the strange hands
They pull him back
foot drags a small riser out from under the lectern
Hands push  up onto the riser
126 Booming up on the torah scrolls, still being busily rolled
Beyond it, a sea of faces
The yad-a molded tin pointer-is thrust into 's hand
The non-pointing end has a red silken tassel
looks at the bouncing tassel
He looks at the little pointing finger which is the business end of the yad
Men mutter around him, each a different prayer
They dip and doven
watches himself point the yad down at the scroll
The scroll is a dense swarm of Hebrew letters
squints
One voice separates from the murmurs around him
It chants, insistently, in a sotto-voce : Nefesh echad sheichayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot
is still staring at the end of the yad against the parchment scroll
Someone's hand enters and moves the yad to a different place in the text
The voice repeats: Nefesh echad sheichayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot
looks up from the scrolls
In the congregation Ronnie Nudell sits hunched-shouldered and squished between his parents
He returns 's red-rimmed slack-jawed stare
The insistent voice: Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot
looks over
From the surrounding scrum the prompter nods at him
He looks somewhat like Cantor Youssele Rosenblatt
127 Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot
looks back down at the scroll
hand enters to tap a pointing finger where the yad points
Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effa- suddenly erupts: Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot
Mm-hm
continues to boom out the torah portion
He moves the yad along the line of letters
In the congregation,  and Judith watch
We hear  chanting fluently and squeezes the hand Judith has laced through his arm
Juith whispers: 'm sorry that
things have been so hard for us
It's okay
Sy had so much respect for you,
He pats her hand
beat
He wrote letters to the tenure committee
The congregation is loudly singing 'Zos Hatorah
tallised man of late middle age 128 hoists the open scroll from the lectern and raises it high, turning his back on the congregation so that all may see it
has been ensconced in a highbacked chair upstage on the bema
His point-of-view of the man holding the torah is close and steeply raked
The man is sweating
The heavy scrolls vibrate slightly from his effort to keep them aloft
As the congregation continues to sing he mutters under his breath: Jesus Christ
stands behind the left lectern facing Rabbi Nachtner who holds a small kiddush cup out to him
Although Rabbi Nachtner seems to be addressing , he is projecting loudly
taking your place as a member of our tribe
You will go and see Rabbi Minda after the service
You will cele- brate in a reception downstairs in Schanfield Hall
And then you will be a member of 'Nai Abraham and of the Nation of Israel
Gopnik, the Sisterhood makes a gift to you of this kiddush cup so that you will remember this blessed day on the next shabbas and the next, and on every shabbas of a long and fruitful life, and, until that wonderful day when you stand under the chupa, we say
Amen
, still red-eyed, tries to focus
His point-of-view shows the kiddush cup large in the foreground, extended toward him by the Rabbi beaming above
His own hand rises into frame to grasp the kiddush cup
The congregation starts Adon Olam
129 Creaking open
The cut has snapped off the robust Adon Olam, leaving sepulchral quiet
, clutching his kiddush cup, hesitantly enters the dim study
Minda's elderly eastern European gatekeeper closes the door behind him
Minda is an old man staring at him from behind a bare desktop
His look, eyes magnified by thick glasses, is impossible to read
creeps to the chair facing the desk
He gingerly sits on the squeaking leather upholstery, self-conscious under Minda's stare
Minda breathes regularly through his mouth
It is the only sound in the room
long beat
The two sit face to face
Minda smacks his lips a couple of times, preparing to speak
Another beat
: When the truth is found
To be lies
He pauses
He clears his throat
At length: And all the hope
Within you dies
Another beat
waits
Minda stares
He smacks his lips again
Then what
doesn't answer
It is unclear whether the question was directed at him
Quiet
130 Minda clears his throat with a loud and thorough hawking
The hawking abates
Minda sniffs

These are the membas of the Airplane
He nods a couple of times
Interesting
He reaches up and slowly opens his desk drawer
He takes something out
He lays it on the bare desk and pushes it partway across
Here
It is 's radio
Be a good boy

Arlen Finkle (off was magnificent

Arlen nods
Arlen Finkle You'll be very pleased
stares at him
Thank you, Arlen
Over his back as he goes: Arlen Finkle didn't say anything
Mazel tov
Distant thunder at the cut
We are tracking behind Minda's female Caliban as she walks down the hall, stooped and shuffling
She holds a stack of papers in one hand
' 132 Mail in front of him
He opens an envelope from  ,
In it are two pieces of paper
Topmost is a letter headed Underneath is an invoice
The amount: $3,000
Arriving rain begins to patter at the window
The , Mar King, leads the class in drill
has a book tilted towards him on his desktop
It hides his radio
The door opens and the elderly woman shuffles to Mar King's desk
She hands him a paper from off her stack of copies
Mar King puts on reading glasses and inspects it
As he reads thunder crashes, closer
' He fingers the invoice
Close on a printed detail: : and, typed underneath: Upon Receipt
Wind is whipping rain hard against the window
Mar King taps on the desktop for attention
Mar King Chaverim, there's a tornado warning from the weather service

The students mill about
It is overcast dark, and extremely windy
Someone is fumbling with keys at the shul

Everyone's clothing flaps
Ronnie Nudell shouts above the wind: Ronnie Nudell That fucking flag is gonna rip right off the flagpole
We are looking through a windshield lashed by rain at , driving
His hands are clenched tight on the wheel
Wipers pump to keep up with the rain
The cars behind have their lights on
It has gotten quite dark
Passing streetlights rhythmically sweep 's face, their light stippled and bent by the rain on the windows

His head bobs in time to the music
His hair whips in the wind

Hey

From behind , over his shoulder: we see a funnel cloud in the middle distance

The tornado is approaching
At the first downbeat of its chorus the Jefferson Airplane song bumps up full
