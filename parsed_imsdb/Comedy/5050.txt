50/50 ('  ) Written by Will Reiser 7/2/08 : - It's another picture perfect day in San Diego
The beaches, golf courses, and yacht clubs are packed with hundreds of rapturous citizens
- pulls up and unloads it's passengers
We follow  (25), a kind faced, mild mannered, pragmatist - who despite his youth has the cynicism of an old man
He steps off the bus, crosses the street and approaches - Adam enters the Hospital
The mood is calm
All the chaos one would expect to find in a hospital of this size is tucked away behind the sterile and monochrome walls
Adam walks to the reception counter
The  is engrossed with the latest edition of  Weekly
She ignores Adam who just stands there awkwardly, unsure of what to do
Adam gives out a small cough to grab her attention
The Receptionist keeps her eyes fixed on her magazine
Can  help you
have an appointment
Name
Adam Schwartz
The Receptionist says nothing
Adam stands silent, not knowing what to do
He coughs again
Annoyed, the Receptionist looks up but says nothing
2
(') () Um, am  supposed to go somewhere
With her eyes the Receptionist points to the waiting area
(') Oh, should  go sit
The Receptionist rolls her eyes and returns to her magazine
Adam looks around the empty waiting room
He takes a seat and browses through a dozen outdated magazines: Highlights, Time, Life, Modern Maternity, etc
Only moments later, as though he hadn't just introduced himself, the Receptionist calls out: Adam Schwartz
Adam looks around the waiting room
There's no one else there
Again the receptionist calls out again - (') Adam Schwartz
Yeah, that's me
Follow me
The Receptionist leads Adam to a small changing room and hands him a hospital gown
(') Put this on
Do  need to take off all my clothes
The Receptionist stares blankly at Adam
(') 'll figure it out
The Receptionist leaves
Adam awkwardly undresses and slips on the hospital gown
Unsure which end of the gown is the front, Adam adjusts the garment a few times until he decides he has it right
Adam pulls back the curtain of the changing room to find , an overly cheery nurse
3
Hi Adam, my name is Joanne, so nice to meet you
Adam scratches his chest, the hospital gown is beginning to irritate his skin
You don't happen to have anything in a cotton blend
() Cotton
You're funny
Joanne hands Adam a giant specimen cup marked with a thick yellow line
(') Now 'm going to need you to fill this cup with urine
You think you can do that
You want me to fill this entire cup
Yup
Adam looks down at the cup in total disbelief
It's gonna take me at least a week to fill this
Can  take it home
() Take it home
You're so funny
The   to reveal a group of   taking diligent notes in the background
this time to the next room: Adam struggles to fill the cup
After a few beats, there's a knock on the door
(
) You okay in there Adam
4
Just another minute
Adam looks down at the empty cup in frustration
The to the next room: - Adam stands in front of an -Ray machine
The has him stand in a dozen uncomfortable positions for long periods of time: sideways, one arm in the air, then the other arm, on one leg, then the other, one leg in the air, then the other, and so on
Again we see the group of Medical Students taking notes
The to the next room: Joanne pulls out a giant needle
Here comes the choo-choo
In the back we see the Med Students still taking notes
The to the next room: Adam is lying on the gurney of an  machine
He is slowly drawn into the enclosed body scanner
() Now make sure you lie completely still
Otherwise we'll have to do it all over again
Which we're not going to have to do, right
- Adam lies perfectly still in the enclosed body scanner
Hello
Is anybody out there
There's no one there
He's been left unattended
The Technician is watching the Laker game in the next room
5
(') have to pee
The Med Students continue to take notes
- Through the window of the hospital the    and across the San Diego skyline
We watch as the Sun sets to night, then rises to morning
- : It's a gray morning as the thick spring fog slowly begins to lift
With no one in sight, the only sound that can be heard is that of the waves crashing onto the shoreline and then rolling back out to the Pacific Ocean
About a mile inland, we come upon: - Rows of identical two and three bedroom town houses with lawns groomed to perfection fill the community
This is Southern California Suburbia
The sound of the waves crashing gets increasingly louder and louder as we   : '  - The interior of Adam's house is spotless
Pictures on the walls: Adam and his dad sailing
Adam and his parents at his Bar Mitzvah
Adam and his best friend, Seth, at High School Graduation
University of Berkeley hat
National Academic Achievement Award in the Sciences
Curled in a fetal position, Adam sleeps peacefully next to (25), his loving girlfriend
Cute, charming, and artsy, Rachel is "Winnie Cooper" all grown up
The sound of the waves crashing stops abruptly
loud obnoxious alarm clock goes off
Startled, Adam jumps up
Drenched in sweat, and completely disoriented, he looks around in confusion
6
After a moment, Adam pulls an earplug out of each ear, and turns off the alarm
The sound of the crashing waves turns back on
Adam pushes a button on the alarm clock and the sound of the waves stops, but the loud obnoxious alarm returns
He pushes the clock again
The alarm turns off but now we hear the sound of crickets chirping
Again Adam pushes a button, this time we hear the sound of a loud thunder/rain storm, he pushes a button again, this time we hear the sound of loud clanging church bells
Rachel rolls over - (asleep and incoherent) Make it stop
() It won't turn off
Frustrated, Adam tries pushing all the buttons
This only makes it worse
We hear  of the previous sounds simultaneously sound off
Rachel rolls over and moans as she puts a pillow over her head
(') () Sorry
Adam reaches down and unplugs the alarm clock, bringing an end to the noise
He sits for a moment at the edge of the bed, collects himself
Adam looks down at Rachel and begins kissing her neck
Mmmmm
Rachel gently strokes her fingers through Adam's hair
Something catches her attention - a single strand of hair
She holds it up
(') Oh my god
What
think you have a gray hair
Really
'm gonna pull it out
7
No
Don't touch it
Adam jumps from bed
He rushes into the bathroom
Rachel rolls back to sleep
- Adam stands in front of the mirror and searches for the gray hair
Once he finds it, he holds it out for a closer look
It is in fact a gray hair
He smiles
- As Adam showers, he tries to squirt shampoo into his hand, but the bottle is empty
He looks over at Rachel's large assortment of shower products, finds one that smells pleasant, Fructis by 'Oreal, and squirts some into his hair
He then proceeds to lather his entire body in the product
- Adam dresses in front of the bathroom mirror
His outfit is well put together, but not what you would expect of someone his age - more of a Mr
Rogers look
He pulls out a and meticulously combs his cardigan
'  - (25), pulls up in front of Adam's house in his white Neon and  the horn
On the bumper is a sticker: "Let's put the Christ back in Christmas
" Overweight, well dressed, and wearing an air of confidence, Seth pulls out a massive joint, lights it and takes a hit
Just then Seth looks over at 3    and their  waiting for the school bus
The mother's jaw is on the ground in shock
Seth hides the joint and smiles in embarrassment
Hi kids
Beautiful day isn't it
The mother quickly moves her kids out of sight
Adam approaches Seth's car
He spots his neighbors  and (late 40's) getting into their car
They wave to Adam
8
Hey Adam
( ) Hey Andrew
Sorry about the noise last night
Adam shrugs as if to say "what the fuck
" Andrew and Missy giggle as they get into their car
'  - Adam gets into the car
Yo
Yo
What's that smell
( ) Are you wearing perfume
No
Well, you smell like the cast of Steel Magnolias
( ) ran out of shampoo
had to use Rachel's
For a second there  thought maybe you'd fucked Olympia Dukakis
Adam tries to close his window
The child safety lock is on
Can you unlock my window
There's a lot of pollen in the air
Seth ignores Adam and turns up the music
9
(') () Seriously, my allergies are flaring up
It feels like my nasal cavities are on fire
Adam begins to clear his throat, Seth turns the music even louder
Sorry music's too loud, it's making it hard for me to hear your whining
- We see the morning bustle as   and  stand in line waiting for their morning coffee
Adam and Seth stand at the end of that line watching the   in front of them who can't keep their hands off of each other
don't get it, that guy is clearly a total douchebag
He's wearing Capris
Rachel and  used to be like that; like two wild animals in heat
() guess it is only natural though, as we get older, more mature, things begin to slow down
() Sex every three weeks is normal
Right
( ) You haven't had sex in three weeks
() You think maybe she's mad cause haven't asked her to move in
What the fuck are you talking about
don't think she's waiting for you to ask anything
You're using her shampoo
Next thing you'll be using her tampons
10
Seth laughs at his own joke
(') But seriously, let me get this straight - she has her own place, yet she spends every night with you, in your bed, but she won't sleep with you
It's not that big a deal
So when does it become a big deal
Five weeks
Six weeks
year
My cut off
4 days
That's when begin to worry
Do you realize how lucky  am to be with Rachel
Look around, there are like a million Rachel's in this city alone
well, she's kind of hot, so maybe half a million
But they're not Rachel
don't know how to explain it, but being with her just feels right
And 'm not going to overlook that just cause we're in a lull
My parents are in a lull, which is what happens after 35 years of marriage
You've only been dating her four months
At our age sex is all we have
Every time she refuses to sleep with you a small piece of every man's soul dies
She's killing us Adam
You're a semi- smart, semi-successful, semi- average looking dude
Just based on that you could get with at least one third of the female population
Adam and Seth step up to the counter
They're greeted by the , who loves his job way too much
Morning gentlemen
11
( ) Would you sleep with my friend
Like, right now
No just in general
Yeah, 'd fuck him
The Barista yells to , the other Barista
(') Hey Demetri, (: ) Fuckable
Demetri examines Adam
He's not impressed with what he sees
'd let you blow me
( ) See this is what 'm saying
The Barista hands Seth and Adam two cups of coffee, they each leave a dollar
- Adam and Seth enter the museum
They pass  (30) at the information desk
Good morning Jenny
Jenny ignores them
( ) love you
(60), the museum's vivacious director approaches
Salutations gentlemen
Phil sniffs the air and looks at Adam
12
(') Are you wearing perfume
It's Rachel's shampoo
Phil goes in for a closer sniff
Then an even closer sniff
Adam looks uncomfortable
() Fructis by 'oreal
() My wife uses that
( ) What are you wearing
Seth's eyes open wide as Phil goes in for a sniff
(') What is that
Ah, mothballs
Seth spots a     with their assembled by the entrance
(') Looks like my group is here
Seth slaps on a button that reads "" and rushes off to greet the students
(') See you guys later
Phil turns to Adam
How's the Origins exhibit coming along
We're almost done with Upper Paleolithic
'm counting on you not to screw up
(looks into Adam's eyes) You're the only one  can trust
() () 13
(') The Board is talking about bringing in sponsors
We're a dying art Adam
Phil stares into Adam's eyes for what feels like an eternity
It's incredibly awkward
Phil
Yeah
should probably get to work
That's probably a good idea
Phil looks at the clock - 10 a
m
(') think 'm gonna go to lunch
Phil wanders off
- Adam and  (45), Adam's slightly moronic co-worker, place the finishing touches on the   exhibit - it's an elaborate life sized diorama depicting the life of a family of four Cro Magnons
Outside their hut it's snowing, but inside there's a large fire and decorative horse drawings on the walls
The  instructs his  to paint as the teaches her  to sew
We see Greg positioning the fossil of a  next to the mother and daughter
The dinosaur looks poised to pounce
Adam notices
Greg
What are you doing
It's a velociraptor
Where did it come from
The dinosaur exhibit
(off Adam's look) Why can't we just say it was the first domesticated pet
People love dinosaurs
14
Adam cringes in frustration
Greg you can't just
that's a 75 million year old fossil
just please, put it away before someone sees it
Greg reluctantly goes to put the dinosaur away
He flaps the dinosaur's arm in the air - waving goodbye to Adam
Seth leads his tour of second graders
He speaks like a tour guide at Universal Studios
Coming up here on our left is the "Origins of Man" exhibit on loan from the Smithsonian Institute
It won't be open to the public for a few more months, so you're one of the first groups to see it
( ) Adam
Adam looks up
He hates this part of his job
(') Everyone this is Adam, he's the curator of ancient civilizations here at the museum
Adam gives a reluctant wave
Hey kids
( ) Why don't you tell us what we're looking at
() This here is a family of homo sapiens who lived in Europe about 25,000 year's ago
In excitement, the kids move in for a closer look
Unaffected, the teacher stays back and files her nails
15
(') these Cro Magnon's as they're often called, are the closest in the evolutionary chain to modern day humans
1 touches the Cro Magnon father
Still talking, Adam steps in and moves Kid 1's hand off
(') What made Cro Magnon so advanced was their sense of community
they were the first to settle on a single plot of land, devote to one partner, raise a family, and take care of the sick
1 ( ) This is lame
thought you said we were gonna see dinosaurs
( ) See,  told you
Damage control
Seth points to a life sized holding a spear
( ) Who wants to hear about the caveman
Seth picks up the spear and pretends to charge Adam
(') Caveman
The kids cheer
Annoyed, Adam takes the spear out of Seth's hand
This is Homo Neanderthalensis - the Neanderthal Man
For over 150,000 years his ancestors dominated all of Europe
But then about 30,000 years ago, Neanderthals began to disappear, until one day, their entire civilization was gone
16
What happened
Greg you know what happened
do
Come on
Tell us what happened to the caveman
Well no one knows for sure
But it's suspected that because Neanderthal was a nomadic huntsman, he roamed the land, only fending for himself - never learning to cohabitate with others
So as Cro Magnon families settled into Europe, they took over the land
One by one, Neanderthal was pushed out
and never seen, or heard from again
(game show voice) That's quite a story
Thank you Adam
Seth and Adam look at the kids, they look bored
(') (Quietly to Adam) You really know how to win a crowd
(to the kids) But you never know, just cause they vanished doesn't mean they're gone
For all we know, there could be a Neanderthal walking among us right now
And by the looks of this guy - (points at Neanderthal) 'd say he probably plays defense for the Raiders
Adam's joke gets a small laugh from the teacher, but zero response from the kids
1 This sucks ass
17
Adam and Seth look at each other in shock
Seth chimes in - see dinosaurs
Seth runs down the hall towards the dinosaur exhibit
The kids follow in excitement
The teacher barely bats an eye as she takes her time slowly trailing after the group
- Adam enters the hospital
- Adam leafs through a pamphlet on Incontinence
The pedantic
enters and completely ignores Adam
Instead, he looks over Adam's chart, examines his  scans, and pulls out a  - (into the dictaphone) Patient has been complaining of excessive urination, back pain, and night sweats
Blood tests and urine analysis are normal
indicates a massive intraduaral extradural neurofibrosarcomas extending into psoas muscle with nerve root compression syndrome and bone erosion
We see Adam's face gradually look more and more confused, he slowly begins to raise his arm as if to ask a question
(') Growth extends from the L2 to L5
Cytotoxic antibiotics are recommended
Dr
Ross turns to see Adam holding his arm in the air
(') Yes
Questions
() have no idea what you just said
Is there something wrong with me
18
(points to ) If you look here on your , you see this cephalopod like object spreading down along your spinal column
Adam squints
It all looks the same
(') That is a massive schwannoma neurofibrosarcomas
still have no idea what you're talking about
It's a malignant tumor
What
tumor
No
'm afraid so
How is that possible
don't smoke
don't drink
eat healthy
even recycle
Well Adam it's actually quite fascinating
Your cancer is the result of an incredibly rare gene mutation in chromosome 17p in the p53 Gene that causes the growth of malignant cells in tissue around the nerves
In your case it's grown along the nerves in your lower spine
Adam looks at himself in the mirror
(still in denial) But, look at me
don't look sick
Cancer often has no specific symptoms
People can go years with out knowing they're sick
We're lucky we caught it before it metastasizes
() 19
(') () 'm going to put you on a 4 month regimen of chemotherapy
It's an aggressive dosage so you might want to think about taking some time off from work
This is real
Adam walks to the window and presses his face against the glass
He looks down at the city below
From 15 stories up, the people on the street look like miniature figurines
Adam turns back to Dr
Ross
Can't you just cut it out of me
Yes, that is an option
But because the tumor has spread to a such significant size
Cutting it out now would be risky
Well what are my chances of beating this
Dr
Ross puts on his best act of reassurance
His words are seemingly genuine, his tone is anything but
Ross Listen, you're in good hands
The best thing for you to do right now is to not worry
Let me do the worrying
Alright
Dr
Ross takes a long look at Adam's devastated face
(') Maybe you should talk to someone
Dr
Ross hands Adam a business card for the "Mount Sinai Psychology Group"
(') We have a whole department of psychologists here in the hospital
They specialize in cases
in these
sort of matters
They'll be able to help you
Not knowing what else to say, Dr
Ross looks at his watch, looks back to Adam, and moves to the door
20
(') Hang in there champ
- a computer screen: "Neurofibrosarcoma Schwannoma
Treatment Forms: Chemotherapy and Radiation offer negligible success rates
Surgical resection proven to be most effective
Risks of surgery: Amputation of limbs
Paralysis
Death
2 Year survival rate: 50%
If tumor metastasizes systemically, 2 year survival rate: 0%
" Adam sits staring at the screen
This is not good
The , a tall blond surfer type, taps Adam on the shoulder
Hey bro, time's up
Startled
Adam looks up at the librarian
Can  have just a few more minutes
Sorry bro
Twenty minute limit
() Rules
The librarian motions to the   of mostly waiting to use the computer
- Adam sits deep in thought
'  - The bus stops
Adam gets off, walks to his house, and takes a deep breath
'
- Adam enters the living room - it's empty
News is on the radio
Fresh paint dries on a canvas resting on an easel
The sound of someone cooking comes from the kitchen
21
(
) Adam
Is that you
Adam walks into the kitchen
Rachel is at the stove cooking in her underwear
Adam stands in the doorway watching her
God she looks sexy
Rachel turns - (') (in a Hungarian accent) Welcome home Mr
Adam
made vegetarian goulash
Like a ballerina, Rachel crosses to Adam on her tip toes holding out a spoon of her goulash
She holds up the offering to Adam's mouth
He takes a small bite and smiles, trying to hide his internal distress
His sad eyes tell Rachel another story
(') (still using accent) What is wrong
Nothing
(still using accent) Liar
This is not going to be easy
We need to talk
Rachel drops the accent
This seems serious
Why
What's going on
had a doctor's appointment today
() What kind of doctor's appointment
Adam has no idea what to say
Have you ever seen the movie "Beaches"
You mean with Bette Midler
22
Yeah that one
Not as good as "The Rose", but good
Remember the end of "Beaches"
() Yeah
Sad
What does that have to do with you
Adam just looks her in the eyes
Rachel gets it
(') Oh
Oh my god
In total shock, Rachel covers her mouth
(') What kind
don't know
You don't know
Well  do know, but  can't pronounce it
Neuroscharnoma or something
Well how bad is it
It's not good
Rachel hugs Adam
Soaking in the comfort, Adam rests his head on her shoulder
She gently strokes his hair
Adam's hand slowly moves down Rachel's back
He starts kissing her neck
He knows it's wrong, but can't help it, the only thing running through his mind is sex
After a beat Rachel pulls away
(begins to cry) You have cancer
23
Heart racing, Rachel opens the top pantry
She reaches back as far as she can and pulls out a cookie jar
She sticks her hand in the jar and pulls out an old pack of American Spirits
Adam looks at Rachel disapprovingly
(') Not now
just think it's an interesting time to take up smoking again
Adam 'm 24 years old
( ) You're 25
Rachel puts one of the cigarettes to her mouth, lights it on the stove and takes a drag
(') What are we going to do
don't know what to do
Rachel begins compulsively pulling drags from the cigarette
Adam takes the cigarette out of her hand
He goes to put it out, but takes a drag instead
He then hugs Rachel with one hand and opens the window with the other; he proceeds to discreetly fan out the cigarette smoke
Sshhhh
Everything's going to be alright Yammy
'm going to start chemo in a few days
() We're going to get through this
They embrace in total silence
beat
And then Adam groans with the realization - (') Ugh
and my parents are coming over for dinner
Do they know
Adam is clearly not in the mood to see his parents
No
24
: The sound of a doorbell
: - '  - Rachel and Adam stand in front of the door
3
2
1
Rachel opens the door
(') ( ) Hey
Adam's mother,   (55) enters
Edith is a short, portly woman with thick glasses and a bright red sweatshirt bearing a cross-stitched cat on it
If the borough of Queens and the city of Milwaukee had a child, it would be Edith
() There they are
Edith gives Rachel a big hug, and grabs for her left hand
(') can't wait to hear the big news
Where's dad
(58) enters the house carrying a
Due to a stroke 10 years prior, he carries a limp and is a little out of it
found your cat playing in the neighbors yard
Dad,  don't have a cat
Art drops the cat and it bolts out the door
So what's for dinner
25
'   - Everyone sits around the table
Edith pokes at her plate of vegetarian goulash, confused as to what she's looking at
If  had known you were coming would have made something else
'm just glad to finally be sharing a shabbat dinner with my son
(looks at her plate) So this isn't meat
No it's called sei-tan
It's made of wheat gluten
Edith looks more confused
But it's not meat
No, but it has a texture just like meat
Edith reluctantly takes a small bite of the goulash
() Mmmmm
It's Good
Edith puts her spoon down
She pulls a handful of pills out her fanny-pack and puts them in front of Art
(') Art, take your pills
Art picks up the pills and puts them in his mouth, but doesn't swallow
(') Swallow
As Art swallows, Edith eagerly turns her attention to Rachel
(') So
Did you set a date
26
() date
( ) Do not do summer like your cousin, remember how awful that was
Schlepping around in the heat like that
Plus the bugs and the gnats
(whispers to Rachel) What is she talking about
And now Rachel
know we haven't discussed this, but are you going to convert
(whispers to Adam) She thinks we're getting married
Mom
We're not getting married
Oh thank god
( ) No offense
( ) So then what's the big news that you made us rush all the way over here
Not knowing how to tell his mother the upsetting news
Have you ever seen "Terms of Endearment"
Oh jesus Adam, just tell her
Tell me what
Alright fine
But, before  tell you, you have to promise me you're going to stay calm
27
Oh Adam, don't be so overdramatic
Mom, just promise me
Okay
promise
You make me out to be some kind of irrational loon
Here goes nothing
() have cancer
What
() have cancer
( ) What is he saying
(takes a deep breath) have cancer
Cancer
What do you mean you have cancer
-  -
don't understand
Mom,  have a giant tumor in my spine
Edith sits motionless for what seems an eternity
The only indication that she's not dead is the movement of her index finger, which twitches uncontrollably
Adam sits uneasy, tying to anticipate his mother's next move
(') Mom
28
Edith calmly rises from of her seat and heads to the kitchen
Adam follows after her
(') Mom, what are you doing
Edith lights the stove, and puts up a kettle of Tea
'm making you green tea
Please, will you come sit down
Edith holds up the package of Green Tea
saw on the Today Show that it reduces your risk of getting cancer by fifteen percent
Mom,  already have cancer
Refusing to look at her son, Edith frantically rifles through her fanny pack
Here take these
Her hands now shaking uncontrollably, Edith hands Adam a large number of prescription pills
(') Aspirin, Zoloft, Lexapro, Lipitor, Flagel, Ditropan, Alka Seltzer
Mom, please, stop
don't need these
() Just take the god-damn pills
Adam take Edith's hand
Mom
Edith's a nervous wreck, frantic and hysterical
How could this happen
29
It's genetic
Genetic
It must be from your father's side of the family, they're always getting sick
Your uncle Bobby just got Crohns
Adam's father looks up from his plate of goulash
That's a disorder of the bowels, son
How are your bowels
The problem is not with my bowels
You're a lucky man
Thanks dad
'm moving in
What
No
Absolutely not
Adam, 'm your mother, and  need to be close to you in your time of need
That's a terrible idea
Well who's going to take care of you
Mom, 'm fine
think  have a right to take care of my son with cancer
It's nothing
Really
30
Nothing
You tell me you have cancer of the spine and now you tell me it's nothing
Adam looks to Rachel for support
Edith,  can't even imagine how hard this must be for you
But promise, there's nothing for you to worry about
'm going to be here every step of the way, to help take good care of your son
( ) You're a very lucky boy to be with such a good girl
You know that
You don't deserve her
Adam looks at Rachel and smiles
know
- Adam and Seth stand on an endless line of   and waiting for their morning coffee
Greg is at the front of that line - he's taking forever to decide what he wants
Adam impatiently looks at his watch
What's taking him so long
How hard is it to buy a cup of coffee
Seth ignores Adam as he stares at the cleavage on the behind him
(quietly to Adam) Look at how tight that shirt is
She's totally aware of how large her breasts look too
This morning when she got dressed, she said to herself - " have these things and want the world to see them
" Greg looks up at the menu of endless options
31
What about that frozen drink, what's that like
() The Bavarian Blender
It's absolute heaven
don't know
Does it have a lot of sugar
We've been here 20 minutes
What's he shopping for a car
Seth's eyes are still fixed on the woman's breasts
Why are you in such a rush
Adam looks around at all the stodgy business men all having menial conversations
Is this really how you want to spend the rest of your life
Wasting away in this place
Greg still hasn't made up his mind
Adam snaps
(') don't believe it
Why can't he just get a latte like he does every morning
Relax
We have plenty of time
No we don't have plenty of time
Life is finite
What the fuck is wrong with you
() have cancer
() Yeah right
32
'm serious
Get the fuck out of here
You have cancer
People in line look at Seth
Maybe a little louder, you can make a special announcement
() When did this happen
Yesterday
They found a tumor in my spine
Who
What do you mean who
Who found the tumor
Lewis and Clark
The doctors found it
When were you going to tell me
'm telling you now
If  had cancer 'd tell you right away
What do you want the Better Friend award
It's not an easy topic to bring up
Holy shit
Seth takes a deep breath
look of panic sweeps across his face
he quickly shakes it off
33
(') Okay, let's relax here
() think the best thing to do is to look on the bright side
The bright side of what
() This is your chance to do all the things you've always wanted
This is it
This is your time to live it up
( ) Plus, do you know how much pussy we're going to get
- Rachel pulls her car up to the front of the hospital
Adam kisses her goodbye and gets out of the car
He takes a few steps and then turns back
He gives her a nervous smile and then continues into the hospital
- Adam walks down the hospital corridor passing dozens of patients, none of whom are under the age of 40
In Adam's hand is the business card with "Mount Sinai Psychology Group" written on it
He finds the office and knocks on the half opened door
The office is small, cold and emotionless - with stacks of psychology books and files strewn about
An attractive young woman,  (26), sits behind a desk reading a file while she eats a rather messy sandwich
Katie takes her job very seriously, but has not quite mastered the art of speaking without sounding like a rigid grad student
Kate looks up as she takes a bite of her sandwich
(mouth full of food) Can  help you
have an appointment with Dr
McRae
34
Katie puts down the sandwich, rises from her seat and puts her hand out to shake Adam's
Please call me Katie
() You're Dr
McRae
You were expecting someone else
Katie wraps up her sandwich and puts the rest away
Aren't you supposed to be like sixty-five and wear earth toned sweaters
( ) Why
Did someone say that's what look like
No, no, no
was just expecting someone older
Sorry to disappoint you
No believe me, you're fine
Better than fine, you're Dr
McRae
you're a doctor
How old are you
Twenty-six
Twenty-six
What are you like Doogie Howser
Who
Doogie Howser
Off Katie's blank look
35
(') The teenage doctor
Does he work here
No
Nevermind
but aren't you young to be a doctor
'm actually in my final semester of medical school
(off Adam's look) This is a training hospital
So have you had many patients
You're actually my first
That did not help to ease Adam's anxiety
Oh
Please sit
Adam notices a dark stain on the couch
He sits as far from it as possible
Katie pulls out Adam's file and sits in a chair across from him
Adam looks anxious, this is his first time in therapy
(') Dr
Ross filled me in on your situation
Tell me, how have you been feeling
Honestly
feel fine
think that's great considering what you're going through
Yeah, but  tend to internalize everything so, who knows
36
You mean you repress as a coping mechanism
Is that what  do
That's what you just said
The way  say it sounds cute in a neurotic way
When you say it, it's like an indictment
The word "repress" - sounds so harsh
It's actually quite common
Oh good, 'd hate to think 'm anything but an emotional sheep
Don't think of it in those terms
It's not like it's been a conscious decision on your part
What's important now is for you to be aware of the way you treat your emotions and for me to help you make adjustments
So how do we do that
The first thing  want you to do is to stop looking at cancer as a burden
Cancer has come into your life to show you that your emotional and physical bodies are out of balance
This is your chance to correct that
You're not in a cult are you
Now, why do you say that
don't know, it was a bad joke
37
But there's a reason
You chose to use humor rather than express how you really feel
Katie is losing Adam
(') In order to heal the body, you must heal the mind
It's imperative that you free yourself from stress and anger
Get rid of all those negative emotions stored deep inside
Adam's mind drifts away from Katie
He focuses on all the clutter
The slanted clock
The wilting plant
The crumbled paper on the floor
The mess is driving him crazy
(') So today what  want to do is start you on some very simple relaxation therapy
Katie presses play on her iPod
We hear the soothing sounds of new agey flute music
Adam looks up in confusion
Huh
want you to lay back and close your eyes
Adam looks down at the coffee stained couch
Lay here
Yes,  want you to just lay back, and let go
Shouldn't we be analyzing my childhood
Or my days as a call girl
Another joke
38
() Oh come on
Nothing
That was funny
Ssshhhhh
Katie stands behind Adam and places her hands on his shoulders
Despite the fact that this is all too strange, he doesn't mind, in a weird way, Adam is enjoying the attention
He finally lies down, contorting his body so as to avoid the stain
(') Close your eyes and relax
Find a place inside yourself where you can escape the cancer
Adam closes his eyes
: (
) Keep your eyes closed
No peeking
'  - Adam is seated at the dining table with his eyes closed
can't believe you got me a present
() Is it that Prada handbag 've been eyeing
(
) Even better
What is it
(
) Keep your eyes closed
You know how  feel about surprises
Last surprise  got my parents told me  was adopted
39
(
) You're not adopted
Yeah, but sometimes  wish  was
Rachel crosses into the room and stands over Adam
Okay
Open your eyes
Adam opens his eyes to see Rachel holding a tiny - wearing a pink ribbon in it's hair
(') Surprise
Adam stares in confusion
() What is it
It's Noodle
It's so small
What do you do with it
() Adam, 's a he, and 's adorable
Having a dog is supposed to help with the healing process
Why, did it go to medical school
() thought you'd be happy
It looks like a gremlin
What happens if you get it wet after midnight
Rachel looks furious
Adam backtracks
(') () They're a lot of work
() 40
(') can barely take care of myself, don't think  can handle another living, breathing, needy, thing in my life
didn't realize it would be such a big deal
( ) can bring him back to the shelter in the morning
know what you're doing
No, you're right, it's not a good idea
Tomorrow 'll take him back where he'll be kept in a tiny cage with 10 other dogs who will bully him, and rape him, and then he'll eventually be euthanized
The dog looks at Adam
It's hopeless, there's no way Adam's going to win this one
Alright
Fine, we can keep the dog
Really
Really
Rachel's face lights up
She hugs Adam
This is going to be so good for you
Adam turns to see the dog shitting on the carpet
- The sun sets over the San Diego skyline
- It's Adam's going away party
Draped across the entrance is a "Bon Voyage" banner with an image of a Cruise Ship
41
Adam, Rachel and Seth enter to find a crowd of mostly unfamiliar faces
Phil, who has had one too many vodka tonics, approaches Adam - drink in hand
() There he is, the man of the hour
Here  am
Phil takes a sip from his glass, and then offers it to Adam
Martini
No thanks
Phil puts his arm around Adam and gestures wildly - causing his drink to splash on Adam
So cancer
Yup
The Big
Man
Phil tugs on Adam's hair
(') () Are you wearing a wig
Nope, this is my real hair
() 'm gonna miss you so much buddy
() 'm going to miss you too
Phil puts his head on Adam's shoulder
42
(') Excuse me for a moment,  think see someone over there from a previous life
: Adam is talking with his co-worker
Have you started chemo yet
No, not yet
Don't do it man
It'll fuck you up
That's like some Nagasaki shit
: Adam stands with
You want to know the secret
Ah, okay
Eat nothing but green foods
Like a specific kind of green food
No, any green food
It works, my sister's friend survived lung cancer
: Adam stands with
() So what kind of cancer do you have
Schwannoma Neurofibrosarcomas
Never heard of it
43
It's pretty rare
Yeah well, you don't look sick
Cancer often has no specific symptoms
People can go years with out knowing they're sick
() Huh
: Adam with Susan again
There's spinach, zucchini, broccoli, kale, cucumbers, green beans, snow peas, seaweed, kiwi, Zucchini, think you already said zucchini
() Zucchini
From across the room, Adam and Rachel lock eyes
He gives her a defeated look, as if to say "help me
" Rachel gives a sympathetic smile
(') Are you paying attention
(caught off guard) Uh huh
Cause 'm only trying to help save your life
From across the room, Rachel laughs at the entire episode, Adam sparks a smile
: Adam is talking with
44
() There's this guy on the beach who injects oxygen into your blood
Is that legal
No, but it's totally safe
: Adam with Susan
Brussel Sprouts, Turnip greens, Asparagus, Celery, Cabbage, Okra, Honeydew Melon, Limes, Green bell peppers, green chiles
: Jenny cries hysterically as Seth consoles her
() can't believe that he has cancer
know, it's crazy
've seen him every day for the past two years and 've never once made an effort to talk to him
Well 'm his best friend, so talking to me in a way is kind of like talking to him
Oh what does it matter
It's too late
Jenny walks away crying
Seth follows after her
Wait
It's not too late
: Adam makes himself a drink at the bar
Greg approaches
45
Hey Adam
(less than excited) Hey Greg
My uncle had what you have
Really
Man that was the worst
Your uncle had Schwannoma Neurofibrosarcomas
Yeah,  think so
It's the thing with the toe and the screaming, and everything tastes like olives
Right
Adam looks perplexed
'  - Rachel and Adam drive home from the party
They're in completely different moods
Well that was a nightmare
Adam, those people just threw you a party
They love you
Half those people don't even know me
The car stops at a red light
Rachel looks at Adam
She finds his pouting adorable
He sees her staring, (') What
Nothing
46
() What
love you
love you
Rachel takes Adam's hand
Everything's going to be okay
They look intensely into each others eyes and then kiss
: '  - Adam and Rachel make-out as they enter the house
'  - They make their way into the bedroom and clumsily undress one another
Adam looks at Rachel's naked body
You are so unbelievably sexy
'm totally yours, Suddenly there's a loud scratching at the bedroom door, followed by a loud whimpering
Rachel stops
(') Noodle
What
The dog
Adam continues to kiss Rachel
Ignore him
47
think he needs to go out
'll do it after
The two continue making out
The dog starts to bark
can't do this with him barking
'  - Adam stands on the sidewalk impatiently waiting for the dog to do his business
(to the dog) Come on
Today
If  don't get laid tonight because of you, 'm going to take your little bow and make a noose
The dog sniffs around, trying to find the perfect spot
(') () Please
need this
'  walks by with
He sees Adam yelling at the little Shi Tzu in ribbons
Adam looks up
(') () Evening
Nice dog
Once the neighbor is out of sight- Will you please just finish
The dog finally finishes
Adam runs back into the house
After a minute, he realizes he left the dog in the street
He runs back after the dog, scoops him up and then runs back inside
48
'
- Adam fumbles around in the dark as he tears off his clothes
He then climbs back into bed, spoons Rachel, and begins seductively kissing her neck
He slowly moves his hand downwards
Rachel takes Adam's hand, pulls it up, and clasps it tight against her chest
Hold me
( ) Mother fucker
The two lay silently with Adam's arms wrapped around Rachel's body
beat
(') Do you
want to move in
Do you want me to
was thinking it might be nice, now that 'm not going to work anymore
And with my chemo starting
Rachel turns to Adam
(') You're here all the time anyway
() Okay
Rachel kisses Adam and lays her head on his chest
() You wanna have sex
() In the morning
49
- Edith's car whizzes down the street and peels into the Beth Israel Synagogue parking lot
The car comes to an abrupt stop as it parks in the last empty space
Edith and Adam step out of the car and walk 20 feet before they realize Art is still in the car
Art come on
'm coming
Art, still in the car, doesn't move
Edith looks at her watch and walks back to the car
We're late
Edith grabs Art's hand
He slowly gets out of the car
- Edith, Art and Adam enter into the 600 seat synagogue
The service led by   (75) has already begun
Edith spots three empty seats all the way in the left corner of the first row
Prime seats, but a bitch to get to since the service has begun - getting there would mean wading through a row of two dozen people
The  approaches
Please take your seats
The Usher motions for Edith and company to sit in the back
What about those seats up there in the front
The service has begun
Please
My son has cancer
Adam's jaw tightens, he can't believe his mother just did that
The Usher looks at Adam, sizing up the situation
Adam couldn't be more uncomfortable
50
Please, follow me
The usher leads the group to the front and directs the people in the front row to let them pass through
Edith apologizes as each person they pass has to stand to let them by
() Sorry, my son has cancer
Adam smiles in embarrassment as he steps past
() Hi
Nice to see you
- Edith and Art stand in a crowd of 600 congregants socializing and conversing after the service
(60) approaches
() Edith
How are you
() Oh Rose
Things are not well
heard about the () cancer
can't tell you how hard it's been on me
My only child
God only knows what terrible thing  did to deserve this
've got a catatonic husband and a son with cancer
Not to mention my arthritis
don't know how 'll ever get through it
As Adam walks through the atrium, he notices everyone whispering and pointing at him
Rabbi Jacobs (75) exits the bathroom, pulls up his fly and spots Adam
Jacobs has the face of a leather couch from all the tanning and face lifts
He spots Adam
51
Ladies and gentleman, Adam Schwartz
Rabbi Jacobs
How are you son
Oh you know, just trying to live by the Covenant
Don't bullshit me
You were the worst student  ever had
bet you haven't even spoken a word of Hebrew since your Bar Mitzvah
don't like to brag, but couldn't speak it then
Your mother told me about your situation
Adam looks over to see his mother surrounded by a dozen sympathetic listeners as she tells them her horror story of having a son with cancer
'm sure she did
It's not easy for a mother to see her son go through something like this, Nothing is easy for my mother
Have you thought about trying to reconnect with the Torah
Honestly, 'm just here to make my mother happy
It was either this or had to go see my cousin perform in his high school theatre's adaptation of "You've Got Mail"
52
Well think about it
'm always here

The year is 1970
Hi there, 'm Alan Alda
Alan Alda walks down the hospital corridor
(') So you've been told you have cancer
Well, you're not alone
1 in every 3 people living today will experience some form of the disease
shot of people walking in Times Square, arrows slowly pop up over the heads of every third person
(') You may be wondering what is cancer
Well, cancer is a group of more than 100 different diseases characterized by the abnormal growth of cells
These cells form a lump or mass called a "tumor"
reddish freckle dissolves into massive tumor
(
) (') Cancer is treated through the use of a revolutionizing medicine called Che-mo-therapy
Shot of a very   being administered a small pill by a Nurse

Back on Alan Alda
(') Toward helping yourself begin to feel in control again
On behalf of all the great folks at Mount Sinai Hospital, 'd like to thank you for your time
make it a great day
54
- small group of patients, including Adam, have been watching the video
The people in the room applaud, Adam looks around baffled by both the video and the clapping
, a tall male nurse of Bahamian descent, enters the room
Adam Schwartz
Adam stands
(') Come with me my baby
Adam follows George into the elevator where they ride down into the bowel of the hospital: The Cancer Ward
Walking through the long ominous halls of the hospital basement, Adam passes dozens of sick patients who are being shuttled into Radiation Therapy, Chemotherapy and other various treatment rooms
sick, fat,    coughs as she passes
Adam winces in disgust
(') This way my baby
George leads Adam into a Chemotherapy Treatment room
- Adam is seated in a plush leather chair where he's hooked into a chemo drip
He's surrounded by a dozen gaunt, hairless patients
He is the youngest patient by at least 20 years
Completely overwhelmed, Adam spots    sitting quietly knitting
She's at peace with herself
Her Zen like state helps Adam relax
Adam skims through a catalogue of clothing intended for cancer patients until he notices  (50), a very small man sitting in a wheel chair which is attached to a respirator
Despite the fact that every breath Henry takes looks like it might kill him, he barks derogatory statements at the wall
Adam looks on in terror
The genial (85) notices
That's Henry
55
Is he okay
He's always like that
() Is that going to happen to me
Best not worry about these things
(84), the contentious old man sitting next to Mitch chimes in
( ) Want a hit
Adam looks down to see that Alan is holding a   full of weed
It makes it all a little easier to handle
() What if someone sees us
Don't be such an old man
Look at this place, it's like Death Row in here, they don't give a shit what we do
Adam reluctantly takes a hit
How old are you
Twenty-five
You're lucky
Life only gets worse anyway
Alan, stop it
( ) Don't listen to him, he's just messing with you
56
No 'm not
( ) It's all downhill from here
Trust me
First your hair's going to fall out, then your balls will shrink
You'll marry a woman, or man, who'll suck every penny out of your savings and then leave you for a fitness instructor in a teal Miata
Then, to top it all off, your kids will one day stop talking to you because their therapist, who you pay for, tells them you're the reason they're so fucked up
You'll have to excuse Alan here, he's going through a rough time
( ) 'm just being realistic
You want some advice
Not really
Don't end up a victim like the rest of `em
Life sucks, the earlier you accept it, the better off you'll be
got to tell you,  was really nervous about this whole cancer thing, and then  met you guys, and boy do  feel better
Alan and Mitch laugh
( ) like this kid
( ) 'm Alan Liebowitz: stage 4 lymphoma
Pleased to meet you

Adam Schwartz, schwannoma neurofibrosarcomas
What the fuck is that
Sounds like the greek dish  had for lunch
Adam is beginning to feel the effects of the weed
man this pot is really strong
Medicinal
Good shit eh
Adam stares off into space
He's really high, almost like he's tripping
The walls start spinning
: -  () Adam is standing on line for a Roller Coaster
He gets to the front of the line when the  stops him
Hey you
What do you think you're doing
Everything Adam says is in German and subtitled in English
want to ride
Read the sign
The Carnies points to a sign that reads "No Cancer
" don't have cancer
Then what's that
The Carnie points out Adam's -shirt, it reads "' " 58
Adam turns around to see a     eating cotton candy, his shirt reads ""
Adam tries to run away, but he's attached to the Giant Fat Bald Guy via an umbilical cord
The Giant Fat Bald Guy reaches out, picks Adam up, and swallows him
'  - Adam jolts out of bed
His clothes are drenched in sweat
He looks down to see Rachel sleeping peacefully next to him
He quickly gets out of bed and runs into the bathroom
And by the sound of it, throws up
lot
Rachel mutters something incoherent and then sprawls out, consuming the entire bed
'  - Adam looks worn and exhausted from the chemo
He's never felt worse
So how do you feel after your first treatment
feel like  was just gang raped by the Buena Vista Social Club
Is everything with you going to be a joke
'm serious
Have you heard their horn section
Adam, you have a responsibility to your mind and body
was just injected with three pints of kryptonite
Can we please hold off on the new agey stuff
You can't just sit there and ignore what's happening to you
You need to stop bottling everything up
59
What  need is for people to stop telling me what  need
Have you considered that this cancer is nature's way of telling you to change the way you live your life
(off Adam's look) There's an old saying - you can't change the wind, but you can adjust the sails
They teach you that in medical school
Katie's patience is waning
know you don't like to talk about your feelings, but you have to learn to find an outlet
() An outlet for what
have cancer
And how is your body ever going to fight the stress of that cancer if you can't even handle your own emotions
Adam snaps, rasing his voice
Well excuse me
You'll have to forgive me for not having a firm handle on my emotions at this particular juncture of my life
Katie's a little shaken by Adam's outburst
She stays firm
You don't have to be here
Adam knows he went too far
Plus, that little outburst lifted a little wight off his shoulders, and he knows it
'm sorry,  know you're only trying to help
() 60
(') This is all too much for me don't know what to do
Just tell me what to do and 'll do it
Katie looks at Adam, is he being for real
She's skeptical
want you to do some homework
Here's a list of books on mind-body therapy
They should help you get started
Katie hands Adam a sheet of paper with a list of books scribbled on it
: - : Adam and Seth browse through shelves of books
Seth is reading the author's bio from one of the books on Katie's list
( ) "Franz Schlegel is an American `medical intuitive' and `mystic psychiatrist'
Schlegel's teachings are widely recognized as a global spiritual awakening that is transcending individual and collective human consciousness"
You're actually going to read this shit
This guy is a fucking tool
Seth ditches the New Age book and picks up one on Mardi Gras
(') Let's go to Mardi Gras
Why would we go to Mardi Gras
Because it's Mardi Gras man
It's like a giant orgy of the sexiest women you can imagine all throwing themselves at you, screaming to be fucked
It's a fuck fest
61
'm getting chlamydia just listening to you talk about it
We need to go see the world
This isn't my bachelor party we're planning here
() Adam you can not let your cancer go to waste
Adam takes the book from Seth's hands and puts it down
'm not going anywhere
From across the store, Seth notices,  (30), an attractive employee stacking books
Well if you're not going to take advantage of your cancer, then will
Seth yanks the list of books from Adam and crosses to Claire
(') Excuse me
Yes, how can  help you
'm looking to buy a few books - Seth hands Claire the list of book titles
She reads
Oh
() Are these for
'm sorry it's none of my business
No that's okay
They're for my best friend, Adam
Seth nods towards Adam across the room
62
(') He's pretty sick
Claire shoots Adam a look - the way one looks at a dying puppy
Adam looks on in confusion
How awful
Yeah
Cancer, not cool
Poor guy
know it's been really hard
Claire leans in
It's bad isn't it
Honestly
( ) Sometimes  just wish it was me instead of him
to relieve some of the burden, you know
just just want to help
- Adam and Seth exit the bookstore
They pass Claire who gives Seth a big smile followed by the "call me" motion
What just happened
( ) 'll tell you what happened
Cancer happened, and you need to get on the train
'  - Adam and Seth smoke a joint as they watch "Planet Earth" on a brand new 50" flat screen
There are a dozen oversized boxes marked "Rachel" scattered throughout the house
Rachel yells from the bedroom
63
(
) Adam do you know where the dog leash is
Are you going to the park again
Rachel enters the room with the dog cradled in her arms
(') This is the third time today
He likes running around with the other dogs
He can barely make it to the door without shitting himself
Rachel finds the leash and then smells the joint
( ) Are you smoking weed
Yeah
Since when do you smoke
It's medicinal
Rachel's shocked, this is way out of character for Adam
You got a prescription for medicinal marijuana
No,  did
What's wrong with you
Night blindness
Rods and cones are off
Rachel rolls her eyes
Seth is ridiculous
Then she notices the new flat screen  on the wall and just like that, her demeanor switches
She looks pissed
64
Where did that  come from
The store
(off Rachel's furious ) It's medicinal
thought we already agreed that my painting was going there
(trying to reason) Why can't we put up both
You want me to put my painting next to a television
() Yes
() Art needs to breathe Adam
Do whatever you want
'm taking your dog to the park
And open a window
This isn't a dorm room
Rachel walks to the door, scoops the dog up in one arm and a bag of garbage in the other
(calls out to Rachel) Love you
The door slams
(') don't get it, they spend all day at the dog park
Great
Maybe she'll move there
Can you not talk about her like that
Seth nearly chokes as he inhales
65
Are you joking
Do you see the way she treats you
She's got some kind of creative block
It's her process
You have cancer for fuck's sake
If was your girlfriend, 'd be baking you cookies and blowing you every thirty minutes
Instead, she's yelling at you over some fucking painting
Her art sucks
You don't want to put that on your wall
It looks like someone threw up a shrimp cocktail and then used it to spackle the Berlin Wall
We're going through a rough patch
That's what happens in relationships
() Bullshit
She's fucking you in the ass Adam
This is the one time in your life you can do whatever you want
If you want to smoke weed, then smoke
You want a 50 inch flat screen , then get the fucking
And if you want to go to Mardi Gras, then '
We're not going to Mardi Gras
Seth takes a hit from the joint and hands it back to Adam
(as he exhales) You're totally missing my point
'  - Adam sits in Katie's office

Some of it

Adam is slightly taken aback by Katie's response

Sure, if you think it'll help

At the front of the group is the (50) - a short man with a long greying pony tail and a thick beard
All eyes are closed except for Seth and Adam's
Adam's hair is noticeably thin
Good morning class
Before we begin 'd like to introduce Adam and Seth, our two newest giggle gurus
The class laughs
Adam and Seth look around paranoid
(quietly to Adam) What are they laughing at
(quietly to Seth) Just go with it
Seth and Adam laugh along with the others
(to Adam and Seth) Now what you'll soon discover is the true miracle and gift of laughter
() 67
(') Learning to laugh at ourselves and others through non- judgemental means is far more effective than any prescription drug, or, rehabilitation center
You see, when we laugh, our bodies release endorphins that not only support the immune system, but also release deeply stored emotional pain, and give us a fresh new outlook on life
The Laugh Therapist opens his eyes and stares intensely at Adam and then Seth
(') We don't tell jokes here, we tell the truth - and we laugh at that truth
The Laughter Therapist closes his eyes
(') So let us share
Adam, why don't you tell us what brings you here
Adam looks around in fear of saying the wrong thing
(') We're all friends here in the Laughter Pagoda

The entire class laughs hysterically
Ah cancer yes
Yes

How come we've never met Rachel
Yeah
What the fuck
She's been really stressed lately, Adam looks around at all the sick people
(') If  brought her here, she'd probably freak out
Smart man
Save yourself the headache
Don't listen to him Adam
It's important to be with your loved ones in times like these
Bullshit
Women are nothing but trouble
() 70
(') They're selfish animals who only add to the misery in your life
You want to talk about a cancer
Listen to me Adam, 've been married 40 years and it's my Margaret who keeps me going
Mitch pulls out his wallet
He holds out a picture of his wife  (80)
(') She's my reason to live
That's precious Mitch,  almost want to wrap it up and tie a little bow around it
( ) Honestly,  don't give a shit
You can do whatever you want
It's your life
All  know is that 'm not going to spend my last days on this miserable planet pining over a woman
The day my wife left me was the best day of my life
Adam let's this soak in
- Adam's on his cell phone pacing in front of the hospital
(
) Hey, it's Rachel
must be doing something really important
'll give you a call when 'm done
yay
( ) Hey it's me, just checking to see if you're on your way
: - Adam paces impatiently
He calls Rachel again, it goes straight to voice mail
71
(
) Hey, it's Rachel
must be doing something really important
'll give you a call when 'm done
yay
( ) It's me again
Just checking to see where you are
In case you're looking for me 'm now on the other side of the parking lot
Call me
As Katie walks to her car, she sees Adam pacing and mumbling to himself
Adam
() Oh hey
What are you doing
Just waiting for Rachel to pick me up
What time is she coming
Uh, four
Katie looks at her watch
It's six thirty
She must be stuck in traffic
You want a ride
'  - Adam is seated in the front seat as Katie drives
The car is filthy - it's littered with papers, magazines, food wrappers, etc
Katie's body is pressed all the way up against the steering wheel with her eyes fixed on the road
72
Sorry about the mess
Adam picks up a copy of "Organizing Your Way to Success," which is lying on the floor
think you should ask for a refund
know,  know
What can  say
'm not good at getting rid of things
get easily attached
Yeah,  can see
Changing the subject
So you don't drive
Nope
But you have a license
Nope
() actually failed my test
No
() It's true
But,  thought you can re-take the test
Eh
Let's just say, that the state of California felt it was best didn't
Katie stares at Adam in shock
What did you do
73
kind of backed my mom's car down an embankment
Into the Balboa cactus garden
The garden with all the endangered plants
They didn't want to tow it out in fear of destroying more of the vegetation, so they had to use a giant crane
Katie lets out a tiny chuckle, but quickly contains herself
'm sorry
That's terrible
Unable to hold back, Katie continues laughing
This is the first time we've seen Katie let go of her rigid nature
() Stop the car
Katie looks at Adam nervously
Why what's wrong
Just stop the car
Katie stops the car
Adam grabs a handful of Katie's garbage and gets out
What are you doing
can't handle all this mess
Adam tosses the garbage in a dumpster and comes back to the car for more
Katie starts laughing, she can't believe Adam is cleaning her car
Wait, no, not that, that's my dinner
Adam leaves Katie's dinner and throws out the rest of the garbage
He gets back in the car and takes a deep breath
74
You can drive
'  - Adam and Katie arrive at Adam's house
Thanks for the ride
Adam looks at his house
The lights are out
He's really not in the mood to be alone
He looks back at Katie
(') Do you want to come in
For a beverage
Or something
It probably wouldn't be very professional of me
Come on, 'll let you analyze my Id
Katie is hesitant, but she also feels in a strange way that Adam is more than a patient
Uh, okay
But  can't stay long
'
- Adam and Katie sit on the couch playing an ultra-violent video game
Katie is destroying Adam
You know you are terrible at this
Adam is totally lost
He has zero sense of how to play
've never played before
This is your Playstation
Doesn't mean  play it
Games these days today are so complicated
(: ) () 75
(') There's too many buttons
can't keep track of what does what
() Perhaps you'd prefer something a little more simple
Maybe a nice game of Connect Four or Bingo
She has a sense of humor
Katie's face lights up
She's proud of herself for that one
(') Duck Hunt, now that was a game
You know why
One button
Katie laughs
(') You think 'm kidding
My dad and used to have Duck Hunt tournaments
He was actually really good
() Until he had his stroke
That must have been hard, seeing him lose his cognitive skills like that
This is the most emotionally honest we've ever seen Adam
Well the funny thing is that the stroke actually made him a better player, he just lost interest
Katie feels for Adam
You've never talked about your dad
Well whose fault is that
Doctor
Hey
The two continue to play
Adam wildly pushes every button as Katie's character pins Adam's character and repeatedly slams his head into the ground
76
Game over
Katie pats Adam on the shoulder
(') Rematch
'  - Adam holds out a tray of wheat grass as he prepares to blend wheat grass shots
You ever had this stuff
No, but it's supposed to be really good for you
Well it smells like my grandmother
You complain a lot
You haven't met my mother
It's a miracle  do anything but complain
try not to look at the world like that
The world would be a boring place if we didn't complain
Come on
There's got to be something
One thing, just one thing, that drives you nuts
Hmmm
() really don't like it when people at work finish all the coffee and don't refill the pot
It's infuriating right
77
wouldn't say infuriating
It's just not good work place etiquette
Adam is far more excited by this revelation
He hands Katie a shot of wheat grass and takes one last sniff of the awful smelling drink
He raises his glass to make a toast
To complaining
Adam downs the drink and cringes at the taste
Katie follows, and in total disgust, she spits her wheat grass all over Adam's face
Oh god, that's disgusting
'm so sorry
Katie grabs a towel as Adam stands speechless
(') Hold on
'm so sorry
Adam keeps his eyes closed as Katie wipes his face
Is it all gone
For the first time, Katie notices how cute Adam is
Adam opens his eyes to catch Katie staring at him
They lock eyes for a moment
Uncomfortable, Adam averts his look
Suddenly, Rachel walks through the front door
(
) Adam
Feeling a little foolish, Katie motions to leave
should probably be going
Rachel enters the kitchen
Adam
Finally
Where have you been
() hope 'm not interrupting
78
Oh, this is Dr
McRae, my therapist
() This is your therapist
Please, call me Katie
() Katie
What are you doing here
She drove me home
Ring a bell
Ugh
Shit
(/) Thank you so much for doing that
Life's been a little crazy lately, which 'm sure Adam has told you all about
love those shoes
Thanks
Awkward silence
The tension is thick
(') 'm going to go
'll see you at our next session Adam
Katie leaves
Where have you been
was at the gallery
() You were supposed to pick me up
8 hours ago
know
'm sorry
totally spaced
With the opening only three months away my head's just all over the place
(off Adam's look) () 79
(') Don't look at me like that
You know this is a hard time for me
You're right
Let me go back and talk to the doctor - see if maybe they can diagnose me with something that better suits your needs
() 'm not just some car service here to shuttle you around
And my house isn't a summer camp
You can't just come and go as you please and not take some responsibility
And what is it that 'm not taking responsibility for
This
Us
can't handle this
You make it sound like 'm your wife
You know what  thought the other day
That  might actually die without ever having sex again
'm sorry if your cancer isn't turning me on
Rachel begins to cry
(') You think this is easy for me seeing you sick like this
The past few months have been hard on me too
It's not always about you
() know
Adam tenderly wraps his arms around Rachel
80
beat
Why are you so good
You're my Yam
'  - Rachel stares at Adam as he sleeps next to her in bed
She slowly moves her index finger along Adam's arm and then seductively kisses his neck
Adam firmly grabs hold of Rachel and the two begin to go through the motions
Clothes come off
Adam gets on top of Rachel
And then stops
What's wrong
can't
Why
Adam looks down
don't know what's wrong
() It won't work
Adam rolls over onto his back
He and Rachel lay silent - neither making contact with the other
: : - Adam sits down next to Mitch, but notices there's no Alan
Where's Alan
Speechless, Mitch looks up at Adam and slowly shakes his head
Tears roll down Mitch's cheek
Adam's face goes white
81
- Adam and Mitch stand next to the
The tombstone reads "  (1923-2007)
" up to the sky, and then  to reveal: -  () healthy Adam is surrounded by dozens of energetic elderly people who are swimming, playing bocci ball, shuffle board, bridge, etc
Adam looks on in confusion as an   wearing an official looking badge drives by on a golf cart
Excuse me
The old man stops his cart
How can  help you
Where am
The After Life
This is Heaven
The old man scratches his balls
Pretty great huh
They've even got a frozen yogurt machine
The old man points to a long line of excited seniors awaiting their turn at a massive Frozen Yogurt Sundae Bar
sign in front reads ": 45 "
There are lines in Heaven
It's worth it
End Dream
82
'  - Adam jumps from bed in cold sweat
'  - Adam is seated in the Rabbi's office, he looks despondent
So you want to know what's going to happen when you die
think it's a fair question
Fair yes, but impossible for me to answer
Our deaths, like our lives, have meaning and are all part of God's plan
How should  know what God has planned for you
Maybe if you came to service once in a while
Well am  going to go to Heaven
Probably
What if  want to just die
That's it
No Heaven
That's like buying a ticket for a cruise and then not going
The Afterlife is where the fun begins
How can being stuck in some nonexistent void with my grandparents be fun
spent my entire life trying to get away from my family, now 'm going to have to spend an eternity with them
Adam, you can not look at death as a curse
Even in death we are all still part of God
Life on Earth is just the beginning
83
But that's not what  want
() Oy
Then find another religion don't make the rules
'  - Adam is lying on the couch staring at the ceiling
There is total silence
You're being awfully quiet today
Is everything okay
'm going to die aren't
What are you talking about
It's true
We don't know that
Adam sits up and looks at Katie
'm not getting any better
Don't say that, you're doing so well
Did you know that they found a Quasar 7 billion light years away
7 billion light years
It's more than 3 billion years older than our planet, and we're just seeing it now; and you think 'm going to live
( ) What are you talking about
84
Cancer is an epidemic
It killed Alan, it's going to kill me, and it's going to kill millions more after me
There's nothing anybody can do
This is really good Adam
Let it out
Will you stop
() can't do this anymore
It doesn't matter
None of it
'm going to die and with nothing to show for my life
100 years from now my legacy be will be that of just another person dead of cancer
That's it
This helplessness you're feeling is normal
These emotions you're holding onto are what make you human
But it doesn't mean you can just stop living your life
() Look at how you've grown over the past few months, you can't just throw it all away
Talk to me
know you're only trying to help, but this isn't working for me anymore
() 'm sorry
Adam leaves
Katie is left feeling as though she failed
- Adam lies on the bed of an  machine
His body is slowly drawn into the enclosed body scanner
'  - : Adam's stares at himself in the mirror
His health deteriorates even more
: 85
Looking at himself in the mirror, Adam takes note of his hollow cheeks and worn eyes
He looks awful, like an old man
There isn't any youth left
He's not getting any better, and he knows it
Noticing a few renegade hairs sticking up, Adam pulls out a lint brush and combs his head
Rachel enters and steps up on the scale
She examines herself in the mirror
need a new lint brush
Okay, 'll pick one up
And  have a doctor's appointment next Thursday
The big one
Rachel continues to examines her waist
Am  getting fat
Adam stares at Rachel
(') What
Are you listening to me
() Yes
So you'll take me
Of course
Rachel leaves
In frustration Adam weakly picks up the scale and throws it against the wall, smashing it
: '   - Adam sits alone in his empty house
It's a mess
He looks unhinged
86
He slowly pulls a hit from a joint as he watches Matlock on his flat screen , which has been moved to the floor to make room for Rachel's painting
Adam flips the channel to Martha Stewart, then to  Love Lucy, then to General Hospital, then to Body Building on He turns the  off
He's bored
Adam crosses to the answering machine
It reads "10 Messages
" He presses play
All the messages are from his mother
He hits delete
Adam reads through a stack of unopened letters
He comes across a postcard from the Museum advertising "Mountain Dew Presents: The Origins of Man"
: - : the "Mountain Dew Presents: The Origins of Man" poster in the Museum's main entrance
Adam enters the museum and walks up to the sign
People stop and stare, stunned by Adam's gaunt appearance - like a ghost haunting the grounds
Adam carries a wide smile, he's overcome with a sense of nostalgia for his old job
'  - Phil and Adam sit in Phil's office
You look great
Really
() Yeah, look at you
want to come back to work
( ) You want to come back
Here
What's so crazy about that
87
You could be anywhere right now, and this is that place
Yeah
Are you sure that's a good idea
Phil is treading a fine line
(') Given
your current health
You said  look great
Yeah for a guy with cancer
Adam looks dejected
Phil feels bad, he went too far
(') Alright, what the hell
'd love to have you back
Let's be honest this place is falling apart without you
Thank you Phil
( ) So you're really okay
mean, the cancer, is- Oh it's really good
We've come to an understanding
It takes whatever it wants and depletes me of my every will to live, and  let it
Phil, second-guessing his decision- Welcome back
- Seth leads a tour of   through the museum
He speaks as he did earlier - like a game show host
88
And if you look over on your left you'll see our newest exhibit "The Last Days Pompeii
" Buried in 79 by the catastrophic eruption of Mt
Vesuvius, Pompeii remained hidden and forgotten until 1748 when archeologists began to excavate the site
Here we see exquisitely preserved objects that offer a glimpse into the day-to-day life of this ancient city
Seth comes upon Adam who is working closely on a diorama
(') This here is Adam, one of our curators
Adam do you want to tell us what you're working on
() Gladly
This here is a depiction of what Pompeii's final 19 hours probably looked like
Adam's exhibit is a highly morbid depiction of Pompeii's final hours
The scene is total chaos
Ash flies through the air
Hot molten lava engulfs the town
Miniature men, women, and children run through the streets in horror
People are sacrificing whatever they can for the Gods
There's a wild orgy in the streets
And a giant   model devours a villager
(') According to Pliny the Younger - "You could hear women lamenting, children crying, men shouting
There were some so afraid of death that they prayed for death
Many raised their hands to the gods, and even more believed that there were no gods any longer, and that this was one unending night for the world
" The tourists take pictures
In shock, Seth quickly shuttles the group away
Ok
Moving along we see the beautiful watercolor paintings of John James Audobon
89
Seth looks back at Adam like he's lost his mind
- The sound of someone vomiting can be heard booming from the men's bathroom
crowd of Museum guests walk past in horror
They look at each other in fear
The toilet flushes
Adam walks out
Everyone stares
Adam smiles in embarrassment
() 'll be in Pompeii if anyone needs me
Adam walks back to the Pompeii exhibit
Phil approaches
You feeling okay
You don't look so good
Could be worse
Right
Phil notices the Pompeii exhibit
() Jesus
Phil feels terrible about what he's going to say next
(') Listen Adam
don't know how to say this
Phil places a comforting hand on Adam's shoulder
Don't worry
get it
You're a good guy
Come back when you're better
You know you'll always have a home here
- Distraught, Adam walks down the Hall of Evolution
Slouched in defeat, he passes the various dioramas depicting human evolution
He begins at   and walks backwards in time
90
He comes to the family of Cro Magnons, then Neanderthal man
He stops and looks at Neanderthal - their slumped profiles match
He continues down the hall towards the exit
- Adam walks along the boardwalk
He's surrounded by perfection
The beach
The water
The blue sky
Hundreds of beautiful men and women in their 20's and 30's: jogging, biking, surfing, skate boarding, playing volleyball, etc
He looks like a raisin among grapes
'  - Adam stands impatiently on his porch
He looks at his watch and then dials his phone
(
) Hey, it's Rachel
must be doing something really important
'll give you a call when 'm done
yay
Adam's face is red with fury
He does his best to hold back
() Hey, it's Adam
Where are you
Maybe you forgot, but my appointment is today
So call me back
Enraged, Adam hangs up
(') Fuck
Adam picks up his phone and dials again
(
) Yoooooo
Hey man,  need you to do me - (
) Not around
Leave a message
Adam hangs up and dials again
91
(
) () Hello, Adam holds the phone away from his ear and cringes
pang of regret runs through his body
Hi mom
- Edith, Art and Adam sit in the exam room, each reading their respective magazines - minus Art who is lost somewhere in his own world
The tension is thick
Edith looks at her watch and shivers
There's a knock at the door
enters
The Doctor wanted me to apologize for running late, he's just in with another patient, but should be out in a few minutes
You guys holding up alright
It's very cold in here
Is there anyway you can turn down the Air Conditioning
Unfortunately the temperature is controlled by a central thermostat
My son has cancer
( ) 'm sorry, really, if  could would, but there's nothing  can do
Adam's pissed that his mother has just involved him
(smiles to the Nurse) Don't worry about it
(Scowls at Edith) 'm fine
Are you sure
could get you a blanket
92
No, really, 'm okay
But thank you
'd love a blanket
(to the Cute Nurse) We're fine
Okay, but you let me know if you need anything
The Nurse smiles at Adam in sympathy, he smiles back
The Cute Nurse exits
(Re: the cute nurse) don't like her
Edith puts her hand on Adam's forehead
He looks at her hand and then picks up a magazine in an attempt to ignore her
(') You feel warm
'm fine
Edith pulls some pills out her fanny pack
Take these
() You're like some kind of deranged pusher
Do you know what it's like to fear losing your son
No
You don't
When you have children of your own we can discuss it
Now take the pills
Adam puts the pills in his mouth and pretends to swallow
Edith gets up from her chair
As soon as his mother turns away, Adam spits the pills into his hand
Edith paces around the room looking at the Doctor's various degrees on the wall
93
Adam looks on, annoyed at every step his mother takes
Edith closes in on one of the degrees and puts on her reading glasses for further examination
(') () Huh
What
Oh nothing
() What
It's nothing, he went to a state college
You're unbelievable
just worry that you're not getting the best care possible
Adam can't take it anymore
Well who needs a doctor when they've got you and your fanny pack
You can be a little shit sometimes, you know that
You think  don't know what's best for you
birthed you
You came out of me
am your mother, for better or for worse, so accept it
(Re: fanny pack) You don't like this, well 'm sorry
It's my own way of caring
() Well stop
You're driving me crazy
With the comments and the pills every five minutes
Just stop
'm not dad
can take care of myself
94
Edith turns away, Adam's words hurt
(') 'm sorry,  didn't mean it
Edith blows her nose as tears rolls down her cheek
Yes you did
drive you crazy
Adam gently puts his hand on Edith's shoulder
Mom
Edith turns to Adam helpless and scared
You're all 've got
Look at your father
We see Art sitting in the chair picking his nose
(') 've lost him
My true love, gone
'm never going see him again, at least not in this life
() He spent his whole life priding himself on his independence, always too stubborn to ask for help and now look at the son of a bitch
( ) You happy
You like shitting yourself
Mom
He was the greatest thing to ever happen to me
And then  had you, and that was even greater
So if hover and threaten your independence, so what
You have a mother who loves you more than anything
Is that so awful
No
It's not
Adam and Edith share a moment
Dr
Ross storms in the room carrying a stack of  films
He seems rushed
95
Sorry to keep you folks waiting
It's been one of those days
car got towed
Wife double parked it
Adam and Edith look at Dr Ross with blank stares
(') Anyway 'll cut to the chase
The cancer's not responding to the chemo
Dr
Ross places the  into the light box
(') As you can see
The tumor is continuing to grow here, along the nerve
Adam and Edith squint to see what Ross is talking about, but see nothing
So what do we do
We need to operate
If we don't remove it soon we risk metastasis
But you said surgery was too risky
We're out of options
Tears roll down Edith's cheek
Adam grabs hold of her hand
But he's going to be okay, right
You're going to fix it
Dr
Ross sits, he knows this can't be easy for a mother
This surgery is no guarantee
The risks are tremendous
And, even if we're able to remove the tumor there's still the chance that Adam, you'll never be able to walk again
Adam looks at his mother
He firmly grabs hold of her hand
96
Does that mean
can get handicap parking
Adam's line breaks the tension forcing a slight smile across Edith's face
'  - Distraught and emotionally worn, Adam enters to discover the smell of a home cooked meal
He walks through the house
'  - He stands in the doorway of the kitchen staring at Rachel cooking
Rachel turns around
She's in high spirits
Hey you
Rachel gleefully skips over and gives Adam a sweet kiss on the cheek
Smells good
The girls and  are having a movie night
somehow got suckered into cooking
(off Adam's look) Don't worry  left you some
Adam feigns a smile, hiding the pain of his heart breaking in a thousand pieces
Suddenly Rachel's iPhone
She picks it up, and reads her text message
Her face lights up as she reads
She quickly types a reply
() Who's that
Susan
She wants to know what time 'm coming over
(even more suspicious) That's what she just texted
() 97
(') She wants to know what time you're going over to her house
Rachel puts the phone down on the counter and returns to her cooking
Uh huh
Alright, well 'm gonna go lie down
might be out late so don't wait up
Adam walks to the bedroom
After a beat he moves back to the doorway and pops his head around the corner
He quietly watches Rachel cross from the kitchen into the living room
He stealthily steps into the kitchen, picks Rachel's iPhone off the counter and scrolls through her text messages
( ) What the fuck
Rachel enters the kitchen
What are you doing
Who's James
My art partner
(re: text message) He wants to know if you're still coming over tonight
Should  tell him you're having a girls night
( ) Oh wait, you already told him to bring the wine
( ) That's funny
It seems as though you've double booked yourself
can't believe you just invaded my privacy like that
98
( ) Oh, you just got another text from him
He says "Your skin is the canvas upon which my dreams are painted
Rachel reaches for the phone
Adam pulls away
() Give me back my phone
() "Hope you're not too sore from this afternoon
" ( ) He seems sweet
Adam, it's not what you think
Well now how do you know what 'm thinking
Don't be like that
didn't do anything wrong
() You've been cheating on me
Adam you're being ridiculous
Am
Adam holds up Rachel's phone to display a photo of Rachel naked, covered in red paint
(') What's this
Adam scrolls through an entire series of nude photos of Rachel - all ridiculously artistic
(') And this
And this
And this
There are over a dozen naked photos of you in here
99
Suddenly the back door swings open
Oblivious, Seth enters
Hey guys
Adam and Rachel say nothing
Seth can tell he just walked into some major shit
(') Bad time
Adam and Rachel say nothing
Seth takes a peak at Rachel's iPhone
(') () Whoa
Nice
Now that  would put on the wall
(off Adam's look) can see you're in the middle of something
'll just be in the other room
Seth crosses to the living room
Rachel picks up the conversation where they left off
It's a portrait series, commenting on post-colonial patriarchy in the Congo
(off Adam's look) That's it
Nothing more
Have you lost your mind
had the most important appointment of my life today and you missed it because you were off with your "art partner"
And what the fuck do you know about Africa
Rachel totally forgot about his appointment
The guilt runs through her body
Oh shit
forgot
Please, Adam, 'm so sorry
() What did the doctor say
Did you cheat on me
100
() Adam stop
Tell me what the doctor said
----
Like a child being scolded, Rachel's face says it all
() Are you going to break up with me
No
() 'm going to pretend you never existed
( ) Please
don't want to break up
You know, you have a pretty fucked up way of showing your commitment
told you  couldn't handle this
Rachel stares at Adam with her adorable green eyes
She takes his hand
(') 'm sorry
love you
They embrace
beat
Adam lets go
He looks Rachel in the eyes
want you out my house
Adam walks out the back door
Seth enters the kitchen and gets in Rachel's face
He stares her down
Shame on you
Seth exits out the back door
101
- Adam and Seth sit on the bow of a docked sail boat
The two have had a lot to drink
Adam is understandably upset
Your skin is the canvas upon which my dreams are painted
() know
() Is "dreams" a metaphor, for- Seth makes a masturbating motion with his hand
You remember the last time we came out here
Prom night
How could  forget
Jen Zabrowski went down on me right where you're sitting
That memory is so far from me, Jen giving me a blow job
No, prom night
It feels like a lifetime ago
know it happened, but that's it
It's like someone else's memory
Adam stares out at the ocean
Reality check
You okay
Adam throws his beer bottle into the ocean
can't believe this is all actually happening
The girl or the cancer
102
Both
It's some pretty fucked up shit
You know,  used to think that was actually going to spend the rest of my life with Rachel
granted that might not be so far off
(shakes his head) What a waste
Seth puts his arm around him
We need to get you laid
() Don't you ever give up
No
Seriously, who's going to have sex with me
Some girls are into it
look like Powder
() Plus  have erectile dysfunction
temporary
hope
Then let's go get me laid
Seth stands, and then stumbles
He's really drunk
think  should drive
You don't have a license
You're drunk
103
Do you even know how to drive
How hard can it be
Hard enough that you don't have a license
() This might be my last chance
Driving
You care about driving
We could be on Everest getting high on Ayahuasca with Sherpas, and you want to drive
Forget it,  give up
Drive
The two get off the boat and climb into Seth's car
Adam puts the key in the ignition
Without checking the mirrors, he backs the car up
the car slams into a giant statue of Neptune riding a sea horse
(') Hey Miss Daisy, will you please watch where your going
What
didn't see it
That's what the mirrors are for
Adam pulls out of the parking lot
(') Turn right
know what 'm doing
Adam turns left onto a one way street
It's the wrong way
Apparently not
' An oncoming car honks and swerves out of the way - only nearly avoiding a head on collision
104
(') Adam
Turn the car around
No
'm driving and  want to go this way
Another car swerves out of the way
What the fuck is wrong with you
For once can you just shut up and let me do this
So 'm driving the wrong way
Big fucking deal
Seth pulls the emergency brake
The car stops abruptly
You're an idiot
beat
Get out
This is my car
Adam looks like he's about to erupt
Seth looks at Adam speechless, and then gets out of the car
You're being a real douche
Adam locks the doors and sits quietly for a moment
He then proceeds scream at the top of his lungs
25 years worth of suppressed emotions come out
Adam pulls out his cell phone
Seth notices
He tries to open the door
It's locked
(') Adam, open the door
Adam ignores Seth and begins to dial
105
(') Don't you dare call her
Not after everything she's done to you
Adam gives Seth the finger
(') You're a pussy
Well you're a selfish piece of shit who cares more about getting his dick wet than actually being a friend
Seth looks hurt
Adam holds the phone up to his head
-   () The phone rings
dark figure in bed sits up and turns on the bedside lamp
It's not Rachel, it's Katie
() Hello
don't want to die
Adam
Katie sits up
She's awake now
'm 25 years old and 've never even been to Canada
haven't lived my life
() 'm really, really scared
know
'm sorry for the way  acted should have never stormed out like that
It was wrong of me to push you the way  did
wasn't listening
() 106
(') could never have handled all of this the way you have
You mean like a complete asshole
Katie laughs
And then silence, she really cares about him
think you're really brave
If  don't die,  think we should go on a date
Adam, 'm not sure if that's a good idea
Why not
Not only am  your therapist, but you're also my first patient, ever
What kind of precedent would  be setting
It makes for a nice incentive
can't date you
() Yes you can
No  can't
Yes, you can
No  can't
wise person once told me - you can't change the wind, but you can adjust the sails
107
() Adam  can't date you
() That's what you think
Suddenly Adam passes out
His head slams into the steering wheel
The Horn blares
Adam
Adam
Adam
: '  - Seth and Adam stagger into the building
'  - Adam and Seth enter the dingy studio apartment - it looks like it hasn't been cleaned in years
Adam scoops up some dust with his finger
Seth is unusually quiet
Both guys are being distant
Seth pulls down the Murphy Bed and the two awkwardly avoid eye contact as they undress
Adam climbs into bed
He notices a book called "Coping with Your Loved One's Cancer" on Seth's bedside table
The book is worn and has multiple book marks - indicating it's been read
Adam looks at Seth, he had him pegged all wrong
Seth claps his hands
The lights turn off
Good night
Night
Lying in bed, Adam hears a strange noise, he tilts his head to the side to see Seth breathing heavily and staring at him
() What are you doing
Watching you sleep
108
It's a little creepy
know
can't help it
Seth lays back on his pillow and holds onto Adam's hand
They both stare up at the ceiling - terrified about the future
- Seth's car enters the Mall parking lot and parks

(
) Hi Adam, this is Richard Mathesson, your family's estate lawyer
Your mother asked me to call
We need to talk about potential, ah, well just call me, there are some potential arrangements we need to work out
'  - Adam and Seth browse through racks of mens suits
Adam comes upon one he likes
The   approaches
Sir can  help you with anything today
(holds up suit) You think this is a good suit to wear to your own funeral
No, what you want is on level 3

(
) Adam, this is Dr
Ross
Good news, was able to expedite the wait for your surgery
Your scheduled for tomorrow morning at 7:00 am with Dr
Lamb
Please call my office if you have any questions
/ - , stout and dignified, with a slight British accent leads Adam and Seth on a tour of the cemetery grounds
Here at Linden we're more than just a stopping ground for the deceased
We understand that life is different for everyone, and helping families to see their loved ones off to the hereafter means approaching every funeral and burial with it's own dignity and care
funeral is a representation of the individuals time spent on earth, so  ask you to reflect on your inevitable interment and think carefully in choosing the service and tomb that best befits you
What about a Viking funeral
() 'm not familiar
(talking out of his ass) You know, we put him on a boat
cover it with
dirt and
branches
whatever you can find
We push it out
into the sea
or the ocean
and then shoot flaming arrows, boom
It catches on fire
And that's it
It's awesome
The Mortician stops and looks at Seth
He's not even going to dignify Seth with a reply
beat
110
(points to grave plot) Here you are, the Schwartz family plot
Adam and Seth look at the rows of Schwartz family tombstones
Up front is an empty gap, presumably where Adam and his parents are to go
Adam and Seth stare at the graves as we: : -  - Adam lies on a gurney
, the neurosurgeon performing Adam's surgery enters
He's wired on Espresso
Behind him is who looks like she'd rather be anywhere else
Good morning Adam, how are you feeling
Good
Good
Good
Good
Despite Dr
Lamb's already thick glasses, he holds Adam's medical chart right up to his to his face
(') So we're going to be removing your kidney
Right
Or is it the left
Just kidding
That's doctor humor
Adam forces a small chuckle
He's completely terrified
(') Nurse Wong here needs you to sign a few papers, so 'm going to leave her to do her job, and 'll see you after the surgery
Dr
Lamb exits
Nurse Wong hands Adam a giant pile of disclaimers to sign
What is all this
Hospital liability and disclaimer forms
in case they need to fuse your spine or remove any organs
You know, the usual
Oh, great
( ) () 111
(') Glad to hear there's nothing unusual about removing organs
Adam signs the documents and hands them back to Nurse Wong
You have some visitors
As Nurse Wong exits, Edith and Art enter
There he is
Edith pulls a strip of pills out of her fanny pack
She hands them to Adam like she's slipping him illegal drugs
(') Here take these
They're special got them from Canada
Adam looks closely at the pills - they read "
" () Mom, this is Nuprin
know isn't it great
Adam looks at his mother, perplexed by her logic
() What the hell
Adam downs the pills
Art whispers closely into his ear
gotta new coat
That's great dad
Brooks Brothers
Silk pockets
Feel
Adam sticks his hand inside the pocket of Art's coat
(') Feel
am feeling
112
Art grabs hold of Adam's hand and stares at his son
beat
love you son
love you too dad
Katie knocks on the door
Hello
Katie slowly enters holding a bouquet of flowers
Edith examines her
This is too awkward
Egh em
Mom
Mom
Adam nods for his mother to leave
Alright
Come on Art, let's go to the waiting room
On her way out, Edith turns to Katie and notices a around her neck
(') () Hmmm
Edith and Art exit
Adam is left alone with Katie
They're both nervous
brought you flowers
Not sure why,  didn't know what else- They're great, thank you
Katie sits on the bed next to Adam
So how you doing
'm a little freaked out
small   enters
There is something incredibly unsettling about her thick accent
113
Hello Adam,  am the Anesthesiologist
will give you shot to make you sleep
Adam holds Katie's hand
Will you be here when  wake up
'm not going anywhere
Now relax, this will take a few minutes to feel the effect
The Anesthesiologist injects the drugs into Adam's
() About how long
Relax, you will soon begin the sleeping
Well what if it doesn't work
How do you know  won't wake in the middle of the surgery
What if - Just like that, Adam's out cold
- Adam is face down on the operating table
Two Neurosurgeons, Dr
Lamb and
are in mid surgery
Alongside the two doctors are Nurse Wong and
'm telling you Sir Francis Drake was a Buccaneer
No he was a privateer
thought he was a pirate
114
pirate works for no one but himself
privateer has a mandate from a government
thought that was a buccaneer
No, a buccaneer is a butcher turned pirate
Then what's a mercenary
() Nurse Wong
Will you Google it
Standing to the side of the operating table is the group of Med Students from earlier
They're still taking notes
- Edith, Art and Seth sit impatiently watching the clock
Katie paces up and down the hall
Hours go by
Time can't seem to go by quick enough
: - Dr
Lamb finds Edith, Katie and Seth in the waiting room
We were successful in the extraction of the tumor
However, as you can imagine, with something of this magnitude
there were some unforeseen complications
The bone corrosion was much greater than initially anticipated
We had to remove part of the hip and pelvis, as well as most of the psoas muscle
We also had to remove a good amount of sheath tissue around the sciatic nerve, the damage to that nerve is considerable, which is going to hinder his ability to walk
He's in stable condition right now, but it's touch and go
115
- Adam's in his hospital bed - still asleep from the surgery comes in to change his
Adam slowly awakens
He is high on morphine
He stares, mesmerized by the nurse
That is the most beautiful dresses
Where did you get it
Dr
Lamb enters
Adam,  see you're awake
'm here
How are you feeling
feel wonderful
That would be the morphine
Dr
Lamb picks up a handle that's attached to the morphine drip and sticks it in Adam's hand
(') want you to push this little button any time you feel pain
It'll trigger the morphine
You think you can do that
Adam moves his hands really slowly in the air - Magic
Art and Edith enter the room
Adam reacts like a little kid being picked up from pre-school
(') Mommy
Daddy
() My little boy
116
Remember the time you walked in on me masturbating
That was so awkward
What hotel is this
We need to go on more vacations
Katie pops her head out from behind Adam's parents
(') You're here too
You're soooooo awesome
( ) Katie McRae, Katie McRae, Katie McRae
Mic-Rae, Dr
Awesome Mic- Rae
'd love to make you pancakes sometime
Suddenly the most excruciating pain runs through Adam's body causing him to scream in agony
(') Squeeze the morphine trigger
Adam squeezes the trigger
The morphine offers immediate relief
He lays back in total bliss, and then
- : door bell
hand reaches out
finger on that hand pushes the door bell
The other hand holds a bouquet of flowers
The hand belongs to Mitch's wife,  (80)
She stands on the porch of a small beach bungalow
The front door opens
Margaret looks straight ahead
Nothing
She then looks down, startled by Adam in a wheelchair
() Oh, hello,  didn't see you, ah down there
There's a glow in Adam's face - he looks younger and more jovial than we've ever seen
117
You must be Margaret
Yes, 'm looking for Adam Schwartz
That's me
(face lights up) You're Adam
The way Mitch described you,  always assumed you to be much older
About 50 years older
But, you're just a baby
Adam blushes
'm so glad you could make it
() 'm really sorry about Mitch
Me too
Please come inside
You're just in time
Adam leads Margaret inside, past a dozen oversized boxes
(') Sorry about the mess
just moved in
The ocean air is supposed to be good for my recovery
'   - Adam and Margaret enter the living room
Everyone's there: Edith, Art, Katie and Seth
Seth and Katie are playing a video game:
Edith sets food on the table
( ) We're having a Duck Hunt tournament
You play
118
() Me
Oh  don't know how to play video games
Adam holds up the controller - an old Nintendo Gun
It's really easy
One button does everything
Edith chimes in from across the room
This food's not going to eat itself
Everyone makes their way to the table
Visibly weak, Adam slowly lifts himself out of the wheelchair
He yelps in pain
Katie starts to help when Seth intervenes
got it
Seth grabs hold of Adam, and with his help, Adam takes a small step and then lowers himself into his seat at the table
Katie places a pillow behind Adam's back
Adam takes Katie's hand, she looks down at him, they exchange a smile
Adam notices and open window
( ) You mind
Seth ignores Adam as he fills both their plates with food
(') Please
think there's a red tide or something
My eyes are all itchy
It feels like someone is rubbing sandpaper on my corneas
(as he serves Adam) Nope
You don't have cancer anymore
No more special treatment
am still in remission
119
You gonna spend the rest of your life complaining
() like complaining
We  on the family sitting around the dinner table
