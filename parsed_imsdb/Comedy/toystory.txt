They are drawn up in crayon to look like a miniature Western town
The bedroom is lined with cloud wallpaper giving the impression of sky
One of the boxes has a children's illustrated "" poster of a Mr
Potato Head taped to it
is set in front of the poster
The of , a 6-year-old boy, can be heard acting out all the voices of the scene
(  ) Alright everyone, this is a stick- up
Don't anybody move
Now empty that safe
have been crowded together in front of the "" box
Andy's hand lowers a    in front of Mr
Potato Head and shakes out a pile of coins to the floor
Mr
Potato Head kisses the coins
(  ) Ooh
Money
Money
Money
(kissing noises) porcelain figurine of the shepherdess,  , is brought into the scene
(  ) Stop it
Stop it, you mean old potato
(  ) Quiet Bo Peep, or your sheep get run over
The companion porcelain sheep are placed in the center of a Hot Wheels track loop
( ) Heeeeelp
Heeeelp us
(  ) Oh, no
Not my sheep
Somebody do something
, a pull-string doll cowboy, enters into the scene opposite the inanimate spud
Andy's hand pulls on the ring in the center of Woody's back
( ) Reach for the sky
(  ) Oh, no
Sheriff Woody
( ) 'm here to stop you, One-Eyed Bart
Andy's hand pulls out one of Mr
Potato Head's eyes
(  ) Doooooh
How'd you know it was me
( ) Are you gonna come quietly
(  ) You can't touch me Sheriff brought my attack dog with a built- in force field
Andy places a  , with a  for a mid-section, in front of Mr
Potato Head and stretches him out
( ) Well  brought my , who eats force field dogs
Andy reveals a   , who stomps on the Slinky Dog
( ) --
(  ) --
( ) You're goin' to jail, Bart
Andy picks up Mr
Potato Head and places him in a baby crib in the room
cardboard sign is taped to the bars with the word "" written in crayon
( ) Say good-bye to the wife and tatertots
Andy's 1-year-old sister, , crawls over and picks up Mr
Potato Head
She sucks on him for a beat then proceeds to pound the toy repeatedly against the rail of her crib, forcing some of his parts loose
Andy, wearing a cowboy hat himself, picks up Woody off the floor
(pulling Woody's string) You saved the day again, Woody
( ) You're my favorite deputy
"'     " plays while Andy does various activities with Woody: -- Andy turns the Western town boxes around to reveal cows drawn on the other side
He grabs a jump rope and pretends Woody is lassoing the cattle
'mon, let's wrangle up the cattle
-- Andy then rides Woody around on an  (remote control) car, and herds the remaining "cow" boxes under Molly's crib
-- Andy places Woody on the top of the stairwell banister allowing the doll to slide downstairs
Andy races ahead and catches him at the bottom
-- Andy & Woody fall into the La--Boy chair and spin around and around
Next, Andy uses the La--Boy foot rest as a catapult
Andy flings Woody across the room to the sofa
(raising his arms) Score
Woody lies limp on the sofa while Andy is heard talking to his mother
(
) Wow
Cool
(
) Whadda ya think
(
) Oh, this looks , Mom
: , Andy's thirty eight-year-old mom, has just finished decorating the area with streamers and balloons banner is draped across the archway
It reads: "Happy Birthday Andy
" Woody's frozen face stares in the direction of the birthday decorations
Can we leave this up 'til we move
Well, sure, we can leave it up
Yeah
Now go get Molly
Your friends are going to be here any minute
Okay
Andy picks up Woody from the couch and runs upstairs
It's party time, Woody
'  - Andy and Woody enter the room
Molly is still banging Potato Head against her crib railing
Andy tips Woody's hat at her
Howdy, Little Lady
He deposits Woody on the bed and pulls his string one last time
( ) Somebody's poisoned the waterhole
(picking up Molly) 'mon, Molly
Oh, you're getting heavy
(to Woody) See ya later, Woody
Andy exits
Woody's eyes come to life
The cowboy doll sits up, his expression changing from a smile to worry
(to himself) Pull my string
The birthday party's today
Woody thinks
(to the room) Okay, everybody
Coast is clear
The bedroom comes alive
emerge from the toy box, the closet, the shelves, etc
in a flurry of activity
, his body parts strewn across the floor, sits himself upright and begins to re-assemble himself
Ages three and up
It's on my box
Ages three and up
'm not supposed to be babysitting Princess Drool
, the piggy bank, flips one last penny into his coin slot
Potato Head walks up to him
All his facial pieces are in the wrong slots
Hey, Hamm
Look
'm Picasso
don't get it
Hamm walks away
You uncultured swine
(to someone
) What are you looking at, ya hockey puck
Potato Head walks past, revealing a hockey puck figurine
Woody sits on the edge of the bed observing all the activity
He turns to a plastic green army man, , standing on the night stand
Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky
(saluting) Sir
No Sir
Okay, thank you
At ease
Woody hops off the bed
Hey, Slinky
(
) Right here, Woody
toy Slinky dog, , appears from under the bed pushing out a checker board set
He begins to place the checkers on the board
'm red this time
No, Slink -- Oh
well alright, you can be red if you want
Not now, Slink
've got some bad news
Bad news
Sh-h-h-h-h
Woody covers up Slinky's mouth, aware that the other toys in the room are watching
He leans in close to Slinky
(whispering) Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy
Got it
Slinky shuffles off
Be
Slinky perks up his gait and
Woody proceeds in the other direction
He passes a toy and  partially hidden under the bedspread
(to the room) Staff meeting, everybody
(aside) Snake, Robot -- podium duty
Robot and Snake come out from under the bed and reluctantly follow Woody
Woody walks past an Etch--Sketch, , going the other direction
Hey Etch
Draw
Both Etch and Woody whip around like gunfighters
Before Woody can fully extend his arm out, the Etch--Sketch etches a gun on its screen
(pretending to be shot) Oh
You got me again, Etch
You've been working on that draw
Fastest knobs in the west
Slinky passes a group of toys on the floor
Got a staff meeting, you guys, come on, let's go
Robot and Snake begin constructing a podium made out of Legos and a Tinker Toy tub while Woody searches the floor
Now where is that --
Aw, hey, who moved my doodle pad way over here
Woody spots the doodle pad on the floor by the desk and walks over to it
As he reaches down to pick it up
, the plastic dinosaur, jumps out to scare Woody
(unaffected) Oh, how ya doin', Rex
Rex suddenly turns timid
Were you scared
Tell me honestly
was close to being scared that time
Woody heads back to the podium
Rex follows
'm going for fearsome here, but just don't feel it
think 'm just coming off as annoying
crook suddenly grabs Woody's neck and jerks him towards , the porcelain figurine
(choking) Aach
-- Oh, hi, Bo
wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock
(blushing) Oh, hey - it was nothing
Whadda ya say  get someone else to watch the sheep tonight
(very flustered) Heh, heh
oh yeah, uh,
Bo saunters back towards her lamp stand, passing a stack of blocks
Remember, 'm just a couple of blocks away
Woody is left lovestruck
All the rest of the toys in the room are filing past Slinky
Come on, come on
Smaller toys up front
Woody remains lovestruck in the middle of the room
Hey, Woody
'mon
Woody snaps out of his trance and rushes over to the podium
The toys crowd together as Woody steps up to the podium
, a toy tape recorder, waddles up next to Woody and indicates his microphone
Ahem
(grabbing microphone) Oh, thanks, Mike
(to the crowd) Okay -- : (to Mike) Oh, whoa, step back -- Mike waddles back a step to stop the feedback
Hello
Check
Better
Great
Everybody hear me
Up on the shelf, can you hear me
Great
Okay, first item today
oh, yeah
Has everyone picked a moving buddy
The toys all
Moving buddy
You can't be serious
Well  didn't know we were supposed to have one already
(waving his arm out its socket) Do we have to hold hands
The toys  and
Oh, yeah, you guys think this is a big joke
We've only got one week left before the move
don't want any toys left behind
moving buddy -- if you don't have one, get one
(checking the pad) Alright, next
uh
oh, yes
Tuesday night's "Plastic Corrosion Awareness" meeting was,  think, a big success and we want to thank Mr
Spell for putting that on for us
Thank you, Mr
Spell
The words "You're welcome" scroll across Mr
Spell's display screen as he speaks
You're welcome
Ok, uh
oh yes
One minor note here
(under his breath) Andy's birthday party's been moved to today
(full voice) Next we have -- The toys all
What
Whadda ya mean, the party's today
His birthday's not 'til next week
What's going on down there
Is Mom losing her marbles
Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move
'm not worried
You shouldn't be worried
Of course Woody ain't worried
He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten
Hey, hey
Come on, Potato Head
If Woody says it's all right, then, well, darnit, it's good enough for me
Woody has never steered us wrong before
While Slinky speaks, Potato Head takes off his mouth and mimes kissing his own butt
'mon, guys
Every Christmas and birthday we go through this
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur
mean one
just don't think  can take that kind of rejection
Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced
This is Andy we're talking about
Woody steps down from the podium and walks towards the crowd
(continued) It doesn't matter how much we're played with
What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us
That's what we're made for
Right
Everyone is now looking down, sheepish
Pardon me
hate to break up the staff meeting, but '
Birthday guests at three o'clock
Stay calm, everyone
Too late
The toys  and stampede over Woody towards the bedroom window, leaving him alone on the floor
Uh, meeting adjourned
The toys all crowd around the bedroom window, trying to get a peek outside
Oh, boy
Will ya take a look at all those presents
can't see a thing
Unable to see over the crowd, Potato Head pulls his eyes out of his head and holds them up over the other toys
: '   ' file towards the front door carrying presents
Yessir, we're next month's garage sale fodder for sure
(panicked) Any dinosaur-shaped ones
Ah, for crying out loud, they're all in boxes, you idiot
The presents keep coming
They're getting bigger
Wait
There's a nice little one over there
At first, the kid's present appears to be a little box, but then the kid turns -- the present is four feet long
The toys
Spell the word "trashcan
" We're doomed
Down on the floor, Woody smacks his hand to his forehead in surrender
Alright
Alright
The toys turn inside and look down at Woody
(continued) If  send out the troops, will you all calm down
Yes
Yes
We promise
Okay, save your batteries
Eh, very good, Woody
That's using the old noodle
Woody jumps up onto Andy's bed and turns to the Sargent on the nightstand
Sargent
Establish a recon post downstairs
Code red
You know what to do
Yes
The green army man hops down to the floor where a " ' " sits
Alright men, you heard him
Code Red
Repeat: We are at Code Red
Recon plan Charlie
Execute
Let's move move move
file out of the bucket and march in formation across the bedroom floor
Andy's door creaks open and a lone army man ventures forth to make sure the coast is clear
Satisfied, he motions for the others to proceed
Squads of soldiers march into the hall carrying a baby monitor and a jump rope
The army men each leapfrog behind the stairway banisters and hold their positions while the Sargent surveys the scene below through his binoculars
: ' Directly below, Mrs
Davis passes through the hallway rounding up Andy and all his birthday guests
Okay, c'mon kids
Everyone in the living room
It's almost time for the presents
Once Mrs
Davis and the children are out of sight, the Sargent motions to his men with a silent hand signal
jump out through the railing, parachuting down to the floor below
- The paratroopers sweep the area with their plastic rifles, then give the "all clear" sign
The jump rope is lowered, and more soldiers rappel down
' The toys race towards the nightstand where Woody has placed the receiving half of the baby monitor
And this -- (turning on the baby monitor) -- is how we find out what is in those presents
The green army men march in formation across the floor when suddenly
: Can be heard approaching from behind the connecting kitchen door
Immediately the Sargent signals for his men to freeze in their various classic action poses
(
) Okay, who's hungry
Here come the chips
've got Cool Ranch and Barbeque -- The door opens and Mrs
Davis' foot comes down hard on top of a soldier
Owww
What in the world --
Oh, thought  told him to pick these up
With a sweep of her foot, she brushes the army men out of her path and continues on to the living room
' Shouldn't they be there by now
What's taking them so long
Hey, these guys are professionals
They're the best
'mon, they're not lying down on the job
As soon as Mom is gone, the Sargent motions for his men to proceed toward a nearby houseplant that looks into the living room
The Sargent then notices an injured soldier struggling to drag himself forward -- a casualty of Mrs
Davis' foot
The Sargent helps the injured soldier to his feet
(moans) Go on without me
Just go
good soldier never leaves a man behind
The Sargent motions to the remaining men above
They lower themselves via jump rope, riding the baby monitor
Once downstairs, they hustle the baby monitor towards the houseplant
Suddenly
bounces into the hallway, followed by the sound of footsteps and kid clamor
The Sargent, supporting his wounded man, reaches the plant, right on the heels of the squad with the baby monitor
They conceal themselves in the house plant just before the children run by
-   - While the baby monitor is set in place,   evaluates the wounded soldier and gives the "thumb's up" signal
The Sargent scans the party with his binoculars
: The pile of brightly wrapped gifts sits atop the living room coffee table
(
) There they are
' The toys perk up as  suddenly emits from the baby monitor
(
) (over monitor) Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo
This is it
This is it
Quiet, quiet, quiet
(
) (over monitor) Come in, Mother Bird
Alright
Andy's opening the first present now
(chanting) Mrs
Potato Head
Mrs
Potato Head
Mrs
Potato Head
(off Rex's look) Hey,  can dream, can't
(
) (over monitor) The bow's coming off
he's ripping the wrapping paper
it's a
it's
it's a lunchbox
We've got a lunchbox, here
lunchbox
lunchbox
For lunch
Heh heh heh
(
) (over monitor) Ok, second present
it appears to be
okay, it's bed sheets
Who invited  kid
: : : Oh, only one left
' (
) (over monitor) Okay, we're on the last present now
Last present
(
) (over monitor) It's a big one
It's a
it's a boardgame
Repeat
Battleship -- Battleship, the boardgame
The toys
Yeah, alright
Hamm gives Potato Head a congratulatory pat on the back, sending his facial features flying
Hey, watch it
Sorry there, old Spudhead
- (to army men) Mission accomplished
Well done, men
Pack it up, we're going home
' So did  tell ya
Huh
Nothing to worry about
knew you were right all along, Woody
Never doubted you for a second
- The platoon is preparing to exit the plant when
(
) Wait a minute
Oooh, what do we have here
The Sargent lifts his binoculars back to his eyes
: Mrs
Davis can be seen opening the closet and pulling out another large present
(indicating the baby monitor) Wait -- turn that thing back on
'  - (
) (over monitor) Come in, Mother Bird, come in, Mother Bird
All the toys tense up
(
) (continued) Mom has pulled a surprise present from the closet
Andy's opening it
-   - He's really excited about this one
It's a huge package
Oh -- get out -- one of the kids is in the way,  can't see
'  - (
) (from monitor) it's
it's a -- The sound of children  emits from the monitor, cutting off the Sargent
It's a
Rex grabs a leg of the nightstand and shakes it, making the monitor drop to the floor
The impact causes the batteries to roll out
Oh, no
Oh, ya big lizard
Now we'll never know what it is
(sarcastic) Way to go, Rex
Everyone rushes to the fallen monitor
Potato Head tries to correctly insert the batteries
No, no
Turn 'em around, turn 'em around
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards
Plus is positive, minus is negative
Oh, let me
Woody jumps down off the bed and shoves both Hamm and Potato Head aside
Let's go to my room, guys
The kids rush past the houseplant
(into the monitor) '  - Woody puts the last battery back in
There
(
) (over monitor) Juvenile intrusion
Repeat
Resume your positions
Andy's coming, everybody
Back to your places
Hurry
The toys  and scatter about the room
Where's my ear
Who's seen my ear
Did you see my ear
Outta my way
Here  come, here come -- Frantic, Rex slams into a trashcan and falls over
Everyone scurries to their places as the ' grow louder
Woody falls limp in his spot on the bed just as
Andy's bedroom door flies open and a flood of children's feet rush in
#1 Hey, look
His lasers light up
Take that, Zurg
Woody is flung off Andy's pillow and slides, unnoticed, down the gap between the bed and the back wall
#2 Quick
Make a space
This is where the spaceship lands
-- and you press his back and he does a karate-chop action
(
) Come on down, guys
It's time for games
We've got prizes
Oh, yeah
The kids all run out as fast as they entered, behind them
The toys slowly come to life and make their way toward the bed
What is it
Can you see it
What the heck is up there
Woody
Who's up there with you
Woody crawls out from under the bed
The toys are shocked to discover him there
Woody, what are you doing under the bed
(composing himself) Uh-h-h-h
nothing
Uh, nothing
'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all
Too much cake and ice cream,  suppose
It's just a mistake
Well, that  is sitting in your spot, Woody
(
) Have you been replaced
Hey
What did  tell you earlier
No one is getting replaced
The toys give each other a look of doubt
Now let's all be polite, and give whatever it is up there a nice, big "Andy's Room" welcome
Woody climbs slowly up the side of the bed, peeking over the edge
His eyes widen at the sight of
We see Buzz as Woody does - an expensive looking space age action figure, covered with buttons and stickers from head to toe
The imposing "
Joe-sized" doll stands heroically in the center of the bed, his back to Woody
Woody
Buzz comes alive and looks around
: ' While he scans the bedroom a " "   is heard
Buzz eyes it all suspiciously and pushes a button on his chest
: Buzz Lightyear to Star Command
Come in, Star Command
Nothing
He pushes the button again
Star Command - come in
Do you read me
(to himself) Why don't they answer
Just then, Buzz catches sight of his ripped packaging
The box is designed to look like a spaceship
() My ship
He runs up to the box and investigates the damage
Blast
This'll take weeks to repair
Buzz flips open a plastic compartment on his arm -- his wrist communicator
Buzz Lightyear Mission Log
Stardate 4072: My ship has run off course en route to sector 12
've crash landed on a strange planet
The impact must have awoken me from hyper-sleep
Buzz springs up and down on the squishy surface of the bed
(into communicator) Terrain seems a bit unstable
He taps the sticker of controls on his wrist communicator
(into communicator) No read-out yet if the air is breathable
and there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere -- : ' Woody's face suddenly pops into view
Hello-o-o
-
Buzz jumps back, taking a fighting stance
He presses a button on his arm that turns on a red "laser beam" light on his wrist
Buzz aims the red beam on Woody's forehead and holds it there
Aaaaaaah
Whoa, hey, whoa, did frighten you
Didn't mean to
Sorry
Howdy
My name is Woody and this is Andy's room
That's all  wanted to say, and also, there has been a bit of a mix-up
This is my spot, see, the bed here -- While Woody is speaking, Buzz notices the sheriff's badge on Woody's vest
(de-activating his laser beam) Local law enforcement
It's about time you got here
'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger, Universe Protection Unit
My ship has crash landed here by mistake
Buzz begins walking around the bed, surveying the situation
Woody tries to keep up
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot
need to repair my turbo boosters
Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion
Well, let's see, we've got double 's -- Watch yourself
Buzz shoves Woody down on the bed and re-activates his wrist laser
(continued) Halt
Who goes there
The other toys are peeking over the edge of the bed
Don't shoot
It's okay
Friends
(to Woody) Do you know these life forms
Yes
They're Andy's toys
Alright, everyone
You're clear to come up
Buzz walks over to the toys
am Buzz Lightyear
come in peace
Rex steps forward and eagerly shakes Buzz's hand
Oh, 'm so glad you're not a dinosaur
Why, thank you
(pulls away) Now thank you all for your kind welcome
Say
What's that button do
'll show you
Buzz presses a button on his chest
( ) Buzz Lightyear to the rescue
The toys all
Hey, Woody's got something like that
His is a pullstring, only it -- Only it sounds like a car ran over it
Oh yeah, but not like this one
This is a quality sound system
Probably all copper wiring, huh
So, uh, where are you from
Singapore
Hong Kong
Well
no, actually 'm stationed up in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector 4
As a member of the elite Universe Protection Unit of the Space Ranger Corps,  protect the galaxy from the threat of invasion from the Evil Emperor Zurg, sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance
As Buzz speaks, Woody glances down at the box in which Buzz arrived
:   ' There is a cartoon drawing of Buzz giving the exact, word- for-word spiel that Buzz is now giving
Oh, really
'm from Playskool
And 'm from Mattel
Well, 'm not actually  from Mattel, 'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out
Well,  don't really understand the financials, but
Woody walks over to Bo Peep
You'd think they've never seen a new toy before
Well sure, look at him
He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife
Slinky presses the button on Buzz's arm, activating his laser light
Buzz quickly pulls his arm away
Ah, ah, ah, please be careful
You don't want to be in the way when my laser goes off
Hey, a laser
How come you don't have a laser, Woody
It's not a laser
It's a little lightbulb that blinks
What's with him
Laser-envy
All right, that's enough
Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy -- Toy
--
Toy
Excuse me,  think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger
The word 'm searching for  can't say because there's pre-school toys present
Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you
Oh, uh, Mr
Lightyear
Now 'm curious
What does a Space Ranger actually do
He's not a Space Ranger
He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly -- Excuse me
Buzz calmly hits a button and wings pop out
Again the toys
Oh, impressive wingspan
Very good
Oh, what
What
These are plastic
He can't fly
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and   fly
No, you can't
Yes,  can
You can't
Can
Can't
Can't
Can't
tell you,  could fly around this room with my eyes closed
Okay then, Mr
Lightbeer
Prove it
All right, then,  will
(to toys) Stand back everyone
The crowd of toys make room for Buzz as he heads towards the edge of the bed and climbs up the bedpost
He poses like a high diver, shuts his eyes
To infinity and beyond
and leaps off the bed
Buzz plummets straight down, hits a big rubber ball and bounces right back up
He then lands on a Hotwheels car, which races him down the track, through the loop, and off a ramp
Buzz soars upward into a plane mobile hanging from the ceiling
Buzz becomes wedged between the plane's wheels
The impact turns on the '  making it (and Buzz) spin around and around
All the other toys watch from the bed, mesmerized
Finally the centrifugal force causes Buzz to separate from the plane, sailing him across the room toward the bed
Buzz makes a perfect landing right in front of Woody and then opens his eyes
Can
The crowd of toys rush Buzz, Whoa
Oh, wow
You flew magnificently
found my moving buddy
Why, thank you
Thank you all
Thank you
That wasn't flying
That was falling with style
Man, the dolls must really go for you
(aside) Can you teach me that
Woody stands alone at the other end of the bed, fuming
Slinky, caught up in the euphoria, approaches Woody
Heh, heh, heh
Golly bob howdy -- Oh, shut up
In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was
They'll see
they'll see
'm still Andy's favorite toy
:   plays over montage
'  - ) Andy plays with Woody: jumping up and down on the bed, running around the room
) Andy sets Woody down on the floor
Next he "lands" Buzz Lightyear on the floor opposite Woody
Andy shoots Buzz's laser at Woody and then smacks Woody across the room as if he'd been blown away by the laser
) Andy runs into his closet wearing his cowboy hat and cowboy pajamas
: Andy runs out of the closet clad in Buzz Lightyear pajamas and a homemade spaceman's helmet
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue
) Woody observes all the cowboy-themed items in the bedroom transform to space motif: the posters, the drawings on the wall, the pillow, the bedspread
) Buzz watches Rex execute a
The space ranger suggests a few tips for the dinosaur
Rex tries again, this time giving a " "
The roar blasts Potato Head's features right off his face
) Woody passes Etch--Sketch, who's sporting a portrait of Buzz
Woody looks across the room to see Buzz combing Troll Doll's hair, chatting away like a hair dresser
Woody angrily shakes Etch, removing Buzz's image
) Rocky, Snake, Troll Doll and Rex are lifting Tinkertoys as weights
Buzz works out on top of an upside down Robot, using his feet as a treadmill
Potato Head attempts to lift his Tinkertoy barbell but ends up tumbling backwards, leaving his arms connected to the barbell
) Woody looks under the bed for Slinky, finding only the checkerboard
Woody peeks around the corner of the bed to see Slinky and Robot, under Buzz's direction, setting Buzz's "ship" up on top of  blocks for repair
In frustration, Woody kicks the checkerboard, sending the pieces flying
One of the checkers ricochets off the dresser and boomerangs into Woody's mouth
) On Andy's bed, Buzz pets Slinky whose back end is stretched over to the other side where Woody sits
Slinky's wagging tail whacks Woody in the face repeatedly
Woody shoves Slinky's rear end off the bed, leaving his front end no choice but to eventually follow
) At bedtime, Andy loads his toys into the toybox until just Woody and Buzz are left
He deliberates as to which toy to keep and which to toss into the toybox
'  - Andy is sound asleep, with Buzz tucked under the covers next to him
Woody peeks out at them from the toybox and then sadly sinks back into the box, closing the lid to
/ The black screen splits horizontally to become
'  -  - ' All is clear -- no sign of Andy
Woody throws open the lid of the toy box
Finally
He takes a couple   of fresh air, then discovers that his hat is missing
(looking back into the toy box) Hey
Who's got my hat
The rubber shark pops up wearing Woody's cowboy hat
Look, 'm Woody
Howdy, howdy, howdy
(sarcastic) Ah-hah
Ah-hah-hah
(grabs the hat) Give me that
Woody leaps out of the toy box
(
) Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog
Let me show you something
It looks as though 've been accepted into your culture
Woody looks up to see Buzz chatting with Rex and Slinky
(continued) Your Chief, Andy, inscribed his name on me
Buzz puts his foot out so that Slinky and Rex can see the sole of his boot
The name "" is written on it in permanent marker
& Wow
With permanent ink, too
Well,  must get back to repairing my ship
Buzz walks away
Woody looks at  foot -- "Andy" is written on it also but in a much more childish scrawl, and is largely faded
(
) Don't let it get to you, Woody
Hearing Bo, Woody puts his foot back down and quickly straightens up
(nonchalant) Uh, let what
don't -- Uh, what do you mean
Who
know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you
(walking past) Yeah
Like the attic
Heh, heh
Alright
That's it
Woody angrily marches across the room
Across the room, Buzz's cardboard ship is still up on the blocks
Buzz lies down on a skateboard and slides under the ship like a mechanic
Snake and Robot stand by waiting for instructions
Buzz's hand reaches out from under the ship
Unidirectional bonding strip
Robot turns towards Snake who stands in readiness by a tape dispenser
Mr
Lightyear wants more tape
Snake rips off a piece of tape with his mouth
Woody approaches the skateboard, grabs hold of Buzz's foot and rolls him out from under the ship
Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy
He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me
What are you talking about
(to Robot) Where's that bonding strip
Buzz rolls himself back under
Woody rolls him out again
And another thing
Stop with this spaceman thing
It's getting on my nerves
Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command
Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh
Buzz stands up, face to face with Woody
Don't even think about it, cowboy
Oh, yeah, tough guy
Woody pushes Buzz in the chest, accidentally activating a button that makes the spaceman's helmet open
Buzz grabs his neck,
He drops to his knees and begins to writhe on the ground, holding his breath
Woody is unsure how to react
Suddenly, Buzz  the air
The air isn't toxic
Buzz rises and points an accusing finger at Woody
How dare you open a spaceman's helmet on an uncharted planet
My eyeballs could've been sucked from their sockets
Buzz closes his helmet
You actually think you're  "Buzz Lightyear
" Oh, all this time thought it was an act
(to the room) Hey, guys
Look
It's the Buzz Lightyear
You're mocking me, aren't you
Oh, no, no, no
(pointing behind Buzz) Buzz, look
An alien
Where
Buzz falls for the trick and turns around
Woody kneels over with
: Woody stops short
All the toys look to the bedroom window
(
) Yessss
Ah, ha, ha, ha
Uh-oh
Slinky hides under the bed
It's Sid
thought he was at summer camp
They must have kicked him out early this year
The toys rush over to the window
Oh, no
Not Sid
(
) Incoming
From out the window,  , a hyperactive ten-year- old, and his dog, , can be roughly made out jumping around in their backyard
tiny figure stands isolated in the center of the yard
Sid pummels the figure with rocks while Scud strains at his leash, barking wildly
Who is it this time
can't tell
Hey, where's Lenny
(
) Right here, Woody
Woody turns to see, , a pair of wind-up binoculars, approaching him from the other end of the desk
Woody picks Lenny up and looks through him to survey the scene
Oh, no
can't bear to watch one of these again
:    ' full size toy soldier is posed in a running stance in the center of the backyard
huge -80 is strapped to the doll's back with masking tape
Oh, no
it's a Combat Carl
(
) (plays under the next 5 lines) Just stay where you are, Corporal
Don't move, Carl
You'll blow up
know you're tired
know your leg is cramping, but you can't move
Do you hear me
Buzz breaks through the crowd
What's going on
Nothing that concerns you spacemen
Just us
'd better take a look anyway
Buzz grabs Lenny from Woody and looks through him
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device
(redirecting Buzz's view) That's why
Sid
:     , Sure is a hairy fellah
No
No, that's Scud, you idiot
Again, Woody readjusts Buzz's view
: He is sporting a skull t-shirt and
is Sid
You mean that happy child
That ain't no happy child
He tortures toys -- just for fun
Well, then we've got to do something
Buzz steps up onto the window ledge
The toys
What are you doing
Get down from there
'm going to go teach that boy a lesson
Yeah, sure
You go ahead
Melt him with your scary laser
Woody presses Buzz's laser button
It emits a Buzz quickly pulls his arm away
Be careful with that, it's extremely dangerous
While Woody and Buzz banter, Lenny witnesses Sid lighting the fuse of the M80
He's lighting it
He's lighting it
(
) ----
-----
Hit the dirt
The toys jump away from the window
: Dirt clouds and toy shrapnel rain down along the side of Andy's house
(
) Yes
He's gone
He's history
Andy's toys peek over the window sill
: ' large black scorch mark is all that remains where Combat Carl once stood
Sid jumps up and down victoriously while Scud resumes his
could have stopped him
Buzz,  would love to see you try
(gesturing to Sid's yard) 'Course 'd love to see you as a crater
Sid  and dances around the crater
The sooner we move the better
: '   - " " real estate sign stands in the front yard
Another sign reading "" hangs from the bottom
/' Mom opens the door to Andy's room and steps in
The room is full of packing boxes, most of them half full
Andy is playing with Woody and Buzz
To infinity and beyond
Oh, all this packing makes me hungry
What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet
Pizza Planet
Oh, cool
Andy throws the two toys on his desk with Buzz landing right on top of Woody
Go wash your hands and 'll get Molly ready
The minute the door is closed Woody comes alive and shoves Buzz off of him
(
) Can  bring some toys
(
) You can bring  toy
(
) Just one
Woody perks up with concern
(to himself) One toy
He glances over his shoulder at Buzz, who is walking away towards the opposite end of the desk
Woody picks up a Magic 8 Ball left beside him on the desk
With his back to Buzz, Woody quietly shakes the 8 ball
(whispering) Will Andy pick me
He tips the 8 ball over
The triangular oracle floats up to the surface
Its prediction reads: '
Don't count on it
Doh-h-h-h
Woody throws down the 8 ball in disgust
It rolls across the desk and falls behind it with a
Woody suddenly becomes interested in the back of the desk and peers down it
: The 8 ball is wedged way down near the bottom
The space is a black chasm, dark and deep, just big enough to fit
a toy
Woody looks across the desk at Buzz
He is    as he forages through Andy's pen/pencil tray looking for "tools" to repair his ship with
Right behind Buzz sits It rests on the desktop, pointing in the direction where the 8 ball fell, with the remote laying by its side
Woody smiles for a beat and then runs in a panic over to Buzz
Buzz
Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear
Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness
We've got trouble
Trouble
(looking around) Where
(pointing to the back of the desk) Down there
Just down there helpless toy
it's
it's trapped, Buzz
Then we've no time to lose
Buzz runs over and looks down the back of the desk
don't see anything
Woody picks up the remote for the  Car and switches it on
's eyes (headlights) open sleepily
Oh, he's there
Just, just keep looking
Woody hits the "" button on the remote and steers the Car straight for Buzz
What kind of a toy --
Buzz turns to see  headed straight for him
He dives out of the way as the  Car  into the base of
The impact forces pushpins to fly out of the board
Buzz ducks as pins land all around him, sticking into the desk like arrows
sits on the floor in the midst of a card game with Hamm
He looks up at the desk and  as the bulletin board slams down onto
knocking it out of its stand
The globe starts rolling right at Buzz
Woody stands frozen in disbelief at the chaos he's created
Buzz runs along the desk, the globe rolling right behind him, Indiana Jones style
Buzz gets stuck "log rolling" on a pile of pencils, but at the last second jumps out of the way onto the window ledge
The globe lumbers past Buzz and strikes a Luxo-style desklamp
The arm of the lamp swings all the way around, barely missing Woody
and knocks Buzz out the window
Buzz
Woody looks out the window
No sign of Buzz
All the other toys rush over to the sill
don't see him in the driveway think he bounced into Sid's yard
Woody backs away from the , unnoticed
() Buzz
(electric motor sounds) Whirrr
Whirrrr-whirrrr
Rex looks over at
The remote control car is bouncing up and down excitedly
Hey everyone
's trying to say something
The toys turn from the window to
(leaning down close to ) What is it, boy
(electric motor sounds) Whirrr
Whirrr
Whirrrrrr
He's sayin' that this was no accident
Huh
What do you mean
mean Humpty Dumpty was pushed
(pointing at Woody) by Woody
The toys turn to Woody who suddenly realizes how this looks
Wait a minute
You -- you don't think  meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head
That's Mr
Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer
Now, it was an accident
Guys, c'mon now, you
you gotta believe me We believe you, Woody
Right, Rex
(backing away) Oh,  don't like confrontations
The Sargent pops out of the army bucket next to Woody
Where is your honor, dirtbag
You are an absolute disgrace
You don't deserve to -- Woody seals the lid back on the bucket
Potato Head starts closing in on Woody
Couldn't handle Buzz cuttin' in on your playtime, could ya Woody
Didn't want to face the fact that Buzz just might be Andy's new favorite toy, so you got rid of him
Well, what if Andy starts playin' with me more, Woody, huh
You gonna knock me outta the window, too
Potato Head has driven Woody back to the very edge of the desk -- trapped
don't think we should give him the chance
Suddenly, the lid pops off the bucket of army men
There he is, men
Frag him
The army men yell  and pounce on Woody, while all the rest of the toys close in
Let's string him up by his pull- string
got dibs on his hat
Would you boys stop it
Tackle him
No, no, no, no
Wait
Wait  can explain everything -- (
) Andy, c'mon
(
) Okay, Mom, be right down
've got to get Buzz
Retreat
The toys all drop Woody and rush back to their places
Andy enters the room and heads straight for the desk where Woody is lying
Andy overlooks Woody and begins searching around the room
Mom
Do you know where Buzz is
(
) No,  haven't seen him
Woody painfully watches as Andy searches in vain for Buzz
(
) Psssst
Woody looks across the room
Potato Head and Etch--Sketch peek out of a packing box
Etch--Sketch scribbles a hangman's noose while Potato Head points an accusing finger in Woody's direction
Woody
(
) Andy
'm heading out the door
But Mom,  can't find him
(
) Well, honey, just grab some other toy
Now c'mon
Okay
He grabs Woody and walks out of the room
'  - Andy exits the house dragging Woody as he heads toward the family van in the driveway
couldn't find my Buzz
know left him right there
Honey, 'm sure he's around
You'll find him
next to the van begins to rustle
Hands part the foliage, revealing Buzz
He eyes Woody going into the van and does a slow burn
The van
Buzz races out of the bush, and with a mighty leap, grabs the rear fender of the van as it pulls out of the driveway
:   ' chain of monkeys falls into view, dangling a considerable distance above the ground
'   - The rest of Andy's toys have regrouped at the window, supervising the lowering of the "monkey chain
" It's too short
We need more monkeys
(holding up an empty barrel) There aren't any more
That's the whole barrel
Rex throws the barrel down and runs back to the ledge
(yelling out window) Buzz
The monkeys aren't working
We're formulating another plan
Stay calm
(beat) Oh, where could he be
- The Davis' family van pulls up to one of the pumps
- Andy sits in the rear seat with Woody lying next to him
Can  help pump the gas
Sure
'll even let you drive
Both Mrs
Davis and Andy exit the van while baby Molly sleeps up front in her car seat
(
) Yeah
(
) Yeah -- when you're sixteen
(
) (sarcastic) Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom
With Mom and Andy out of range, Woody comes to life
He stares out the sun roof, still reeling from everything
Oh, great
How am  gonna convince those guys it was an accident
Suddenly, Buzz appears over the edge of the sun roof
Buzz
Buzz jumps down on the back seat to face Woody
He is furious
Buzz
You're alive
This is great
Oh, 'm saved
'm saved
Andy'll find you here, he'll take us back to the room, and then you can tell everyone that this was all just a big mistake
Huh
No response from Buzz
Just an angry stare
(weakly) Right
Buddy
just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet
Oh
Oh, that's good
(getting in Woody's face) But we're not on my planet, are we
No
Buzz lunges for Woody
The two toys fly off the seat and out the open side door of the van
- Woody and Buzz hit the ground and roll under the van, locked in mortal combat
Ok
Come on
You want a piece of me
Buzz lands a punch that sends Woody's head spinning around
Woody lunges with all his might
He smacks Buzz in the face, making it  with every blow
Buzz closes his helmet on Woody's hand
Owwwww
Woody pounds on Buzz's chest with his free hand, activating '   buttons
: The toys stop fighting
Before they can react
(
) Next stop
(
) Pizza Planet
Yeah
The van drives off
() Andy
Woody starts to run in the direction of the van but it drives out of sight, leaving Buzz and Woody stranded
Doesn't he realize that 'm not there
(beat) 'm
Oh, 'm a lost toy
Meanwhile, Buzz checks the surroundings
He flips open his wrist communicator
Buzz Lightyear Mission Log
The local Sheriff and  seem to be at a huge refueling station of some sort -- Woody whips around, his expression changing from panic to seething anger
He charges at Buzz
You
: Just then the toys are bathed in the headlight beams of a behemoth tanker truck pulling into the station
Buzz dives off to the side while Woody collapses right where he stands on the pavement
The truck  over him
stops just millimeters from Woody's nose
Petrified, Woody inches away from the tire, moving back under the truck until he bumps into Buzz
(into wrist communicator) According to my nava-computer, the -- (whispering) Shut up
Just shut up, you idiot
Sheriff, this is no time to panic
This is the perfect time to panic
'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault
My fault
If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place -- Oh, yeah
Well, if  hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me -- Don't talk to me about importance
Because of  the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy
(incredulous) What are you talking about
Buzz walk to the edge of the truck tire and points up to the stars
Right now, poised at the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg has been secretly building a weapon with the destructive capacity to annihilate an entire planet
alone have information that reveals this weapon's only weakness
(pointing at Woody) And you, my friend, are responsible for delaying my rendez-vous with Star Command
Woody explodes
You aren't the real Buzz Lightyear, you're an action figure
You are a child's plaything
Beat
You are a sad strange little man and you have my pity
Farewell
Buzz walks off
Oh, yeah
Well, good riddance, ya looney
Woody walks away in the opposite direction
(to himself) Rendez-vous with Star Command
: (
) Hey, Gas Dude
(
) You talkin' to me
(
) Yeah, man, can you help me
Do you know where Cutting Blvd
is
(
) Just a moment
Woody looks in the direction of the bell
His face lights up at the sight of
(to himself) Pizza Planet
Andy
Woody takes a step forward and then stops
Oh, no
can't show my face in that room without Buzz
Woody runs back under the tanker truck
Buzz is at the far end of the truck, walking away from Woody
Buzz
Buzz, come back
(continuing to walk away) Go away
Woody looks back at the delivery truck in desperation and then eyes
: Atop the truck is a rocket with the Pizza Planet logo
No, Buzz, you've gotta come back
found a spaceship
Buzz stops walking away and looks back at Woody
It's a spaceship, Buzz
- The delivery truck's engine has stalled and is off
(
) 'mon, man, hurry up
Um, like the pizza's are getting cold here
Woody and Buzz eye the parked delivery truck from within the safety of a nearby oilcan display
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply
Uh-huh
And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you
home
Well, then let's climb abroad
Buzz makes a beeline for the passenger side door of the pizza truck
Woody chases after him
No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back
No one will see us there
Negative
There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area
We'll be much safer in the cockpit
In a flash, Buzz has scaled the front tire, grabbed the rear view mirror, and swung himself up and into the cab
(loud whisper) Yeah, but, Buzz
Buzz
(
) Ok, so that's two lefts, and then a right, huh
(
) Yeah
(
) Okay, thanks for the directions
(loud whisper) Buzz
: Woody runs around to the back of the truck, scrambles up the bumper and throws open the back hatch to climb inside
Woody lets out a , as the back hatch slams back down on his rear, sending him flying into the bed of the truck
- Woody peeks through the dividing window into the cab
Buzz is hidden from   's view by a stack of pizzas in their insulated covers
Buzz prudently fastens his safety belt
It'll be safer in the cockpit than the cargo bay
What an idiot
The driver shifts into gear and hits the gas, propelling Woody to the back of the truck
The pizza deliverer drives like a maniac, taking sharp turns and hills at high speeds
Woody is helplessly thrown around the truck
With every blow, Woody  in pain
The truck climbs a steep hill
Woody looks up just in time to see
barreling towards him
: - We   to reveal
- The delivery truck barrels into the parking lot and parks
-  - After the driver leaves the truck, Buzz peeks out from the passenger window
: Two imposing animatronic robots guard the doorway
As approach the front, the guards part their crossed "pizza spears," allowing the patrons to enter
You are clear to enter
Welcome to Pizza Planet
blare out from speakers: Next shuttle lift-off scheduled for -minus 30 minutes and counting
The white zone is for eating pizza only
The white zone is for
Excited, Buzz pries open the window between the cab and truck bed
Sheriff
Woody is gone
Just the toolbox and strewn trash
(continued) Sheriff
The toolbox falls on its side revealing Woody
He peels off the back of the truck and falls into a pile of trash
There you are
Now the entrance is heavily guarded
We need a way to get inside
Woody rises from the trash with a "-" cup on his head
Great idea, Woody
like your thinking
- In the f
g
sits a trashcan with fast food containers littered around it
approach the "guarded" entrance
You are clear to enter
Welcome to Pizza Planet
The front doors automatically swing open as the people pass through
Suddenly two pieces of trash -- a burger container and "-" cup stand up
(in burger container) The two disguised toys make a dash through the closing doors
(in container) Quickly, Sheriff
The airlock is closing
-   - Woody and Buzz just make it inside but then freeze immediately as a    run past, forcing the toys to pose as discarded trash
Once the coast is clear, Woody and Buzz resume walking
Buzz bumps into Woody
(using straw as periscope) Ow
Watch where you're going
(mouthing with burger box) Sorry
They sneak in between two long rows of video games and throw off their disguises
They then take a good look at
The space-themed arena is filled with hordes of children playing video games
sea of -  and lights overwhelm the place
Buzz is beaming with hope
What a space port
Good work, Woody
Woody is busy looking at all the children in the arcade, but none of the kids look familiar to him
Just then he
(
) Mom, can  play Black Hole
Please, please, please
Woody turns around and through the video games he spots
standing with Mom and Molly in her stroller
(to himself) Andy
What's Black Hole
Oh, it's so cool
The family begins to walk away
Now we need to find a ship that's headed for Sector 12 -- Buzz is about to head off in the opposite direction when Woody grabs him and quickly pulls him down the video corridor
Wait a minute
No Buzz
This way
There's a special ship
just saw it
You mean it has hyperdrive
Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro
uh, turf
The toys manage to get ahead of Andy
Woody peeks around the corner of one of the video games and waits for Mom and Andy to approach
(tracking Andy and family) 'mon, c'mon, that's it
Where is it
don't see the -- Buzz stops short at the sight of
It is modeled to look like a spaceship ready to launch
(continued) Spaceship
Alright Buzz, get ready
Buzz heads for the crane game, but Woody does not notice, his eyes locked on the approaching stroller
Okay, Buzz, when  say "go," we're gonna jump in the basket -- Woody turns and realizes Buzz is gone
He looks across the way just in time to see Buzz leap into the crane game through the "" slot
(loud whisper) Buzz
Woody turns back in the direction of the stroller
It has already gone past
Dooh
No
This cannot be happening to me
Woody runs towards the crane game, but is forced to hold back for a moment as some  children pass by
Buzz climbs over the partition that divides the deposit slot from the prize toys and leaps into a pile of
There are hundreds of them, all identical and way too cute
#1 (excited) stranger
#2 From the outside
Oo-o-o-o-o-o
Greetings
am Buzz Lightyear come in peace
Tell us
What is it like outside
The squeeze toys rush Buzz like  excited children
With the kids gone, Woody crosses the aisle to the crane game and dives through the prize slot
- Woody clambers up the side of the deposit slot
(
) This is an intergalactic emergency
need to commandeer your vessel to Sector 12
Woody peeks over the partition to witness Buzz surround by the cute alien toys
(continued; to the aliens) Who's in charge here
All the aliens point upward
The cla-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-w
Woody and Buzz look up
: It dangles directly above the toys
#1 The claw is our master
#2 The claw chooses who will go and who will stay
(to himself) This is ludicrous
(
) (laughter) Woody  at the recognition of Sid's voice
He turns to see Sid heading straight for the crane game
Oh, no
Sid
Woody leaps off the partition and tackles Buzz, pushing the two of them deep into the pile of aliens
Get down
Sid approaches the crane game and fishes quarters out of his pants pocket
(loud whisper) What's gotten into you, Sheriff was -- (loud whisper) are the one that decided to climb into this -- #4 (loud whisper) Sh-h-h-h-h-h
The claw
It moves
: It moves into position and hovers directly above the area where Woody and Buzz are hiding
The crane drops and grabs hold of the alien toy that is right on top of Buzz
#3 (whispering excitedly) have been chosen
Positioned with his back to Sid, the alien is lifted up by the claw
#3 (continued) Farewell, my friends
go on to a better place
Gotcha
With the alien gone, Buzz's upper torso becomes exposed, forcing the space ranger to freeze
Sid suddenly spots Buzz
Buzz Lightyear
No way
Woody, still hidden, frantically looks around for some way to escape
Behind him, through the aliens, he eyes
Woody swims through the alien squeeze toys toward the door
He grabs hold of the locking latch and, after a few attempts, is able to pry the door open
The shadow of the crane lines up over Buzz, lowers, and grabs his head
Yes
The claw begins to lift Buzz up
() Buzz,
Woody grabs hold of Buzz's feet
Woody and the claw begin to have a tug-of-war with Buzz
Woody pulls down hard, forcing Buzz to sink into the pile of aliens, out of Sid's view
(slamming his fist against the glass) Wha --
Hey
Still tugging against the crane, Woody is almost out the door with Buzz
Just then, the aliens at the bottom of the pile pull Buzz and Woody back inside
#4 He has been chosen
Hey
What are you doing
#5 He must go
Stop it, you --
Stop it, you zealots
He must go
Do not fight the claw
Do not anger the claw
He has been chosen
Woody and Buzz are pushed up to the surface and into the air, dangling lifelessly in front of Sid
Alright
Double prizes
Woody and Buzz are dropped into the prize door slot and snatched up by Sid
(looking at his two new toys) Let's go home and
play
Ha-ha-ha
:     ' - : '  - From out of the darkness appears Sid on his skateboard
He is  to rock music from his walkman while carrying his backpack in his hand
Sid leaps off the skateboard and walks up the front path towards the front door
Through the open zipper, Buzz peeks out of the backpack to see Sid's house
He recognizes Andy's house next door
- Buzz, Woody and a squeeze toy alien are scrunched up in the backpack
Sheriff
can see your dwelling from here
You're almost home
Nirvana is coming
The mystic portal awaits
(to Alien) Will you be quiet
(to both) You guys don't get it, do you
Once we go into Sid's house, we won't be coming out
: ' The front door opens to reveal Scud
The dog lunges straight for the backpack,
Whoa, Scud
Hey, boy
Sit
Good boy
The dog begrudgingly obeys
Hey,  got somethin' for ya, boy
Sid's hand reaches into the backpack
(loud whisper) The toys go still
Sid's hand grabs the alien out of the backpack
The alien is then placed sideways along Scud's snout
Ready, set,
In one quick motion, Scud flips the alien up, catches it in his mouth, and rabidly shakes it back and forth
Buzz and Woody react in horror
Hannah
Hey, Hannah
Woody and Buzz glance up to see , Sid's frail little sister, carrying her Janie Doll
What
Did  get my package in the mail
dunno
Whaddaya mean, you don't know
(insistent) don't know
(mock concern) Oh no, Hannah
What
Look
Janie
He grabs the doll
Hey
She's sick
(panic rising) No she's  -- 'll have to perform one of my
operations
--
Don't touch her
Sid bolts upstairs with Hannah in pursuit
Not Sid's room
not there
- Sid races to his bedroom door
Hannah is right behind
Sid
Give her back
Sid just
He charges into the room and slams the door in his sister's face
'  - (
) (pounding on his door) Sid
Sid
Sid carelessly tosses the backpack on the bed and walks over to a makeshift workbench
(as Doctor) Oh, no
We have a sick patient here, nurse
Prepare the
,
Sid  on a bare bulb dangling above his "operating table
" Woody and Buzz look on from the safety of the backpack as Sid places the Janie doll's head in a vise
(
) Sid, give her back
Give her back now
'm telling
(as Doctor) Patient is
(straining while tightening vise) pre-e-epped
Sid grabs a painter's mask from his toolchest and dons it like a surgeon's mask
(as Doctor) No one's ever attempted a double bypass brain transplant before
Sid grabs a toy pterodactyl from a nearby crate full of junk
(as Doctor) Now for the tricky part -- pliers
(whispering to Woody) don't believe that man's ever been to medical school
Sid struggles for a moment with his "patient" then stops
(as Nurse) Doctor, you've done it
(running to the door) Hannah
He opens the door
Hannah is standing there, looking worried
(continued) Janie's all better now
He hands her Janie -- her head has been replaced with a pterodactyl's
Hannah  at the sight of the monstrosity and bolts down the hallway
She's lying
Whatever she says it's not true
Sid throws the doll to the ground and runs after Hannah, slamming the door behind him
Woody and Buzz peer out of the backpack at their new surroundings
Heavy metal posters, discarded toy remains and power tools adorn the messy room
They are in Hell
toy Hell
We are gonna die
(bolting out of the pack) 'm outta here
Woody leaps from the bed to the doorknob and struggles to open it
No good
Woody drops to the floor
Locked
There's gotta be another way out of here
: Woody is startled by the noise
small yo-yo rolls out from behind a box and falls on its side
Spooked, Woody grabs a pencil from the floor and brandishes it like a weapon
Just then a shadow passes by Woody
He turns quickly but sees nothing
Uh
Buzz
Was that you
Woody hurriedly trades his pencil for a larger flashlight
He hears a  from under Sid's bed
Woody turns on the flashlight and shines the beam in the direction of the noise, illuminating
' Hey
Hi, there, little fellah
Come out here
Do you know a way out of here
The baby doll moves out from under the bed, revealing a one- eyed doll head atop a spider-like body made of erector set pieces
(
) The creature extends its legs and rises up taller than Woody
Scared speechless, Woody keeps his flashlight beam locked on Various other   begin to emerge from the shadows: a toy fishing pole with fashion doll legs, a skateboard with a combat soldier's torso screwed to the front end, a jack- in-the-box with a rubber hand for a head, (and others)
Woody leaps onto the bed and hides behind Buzz
---Buzz
Buzz and Woody look on as the mutants have a tug of war as they grab all the Janie and pterodactyl parts, dragging them off into the shadows
They're cannibals
Woody retreats back into the backpack
- Woody cowers in the corner as Buzz enters
He punches a button on his chest
May day
May day
Come in, Star Command
Send reinforcements
(pause) Star Command, do you copy
No response
Buzz adjusts his laser light
It emits a short
(aiming his arm out the pack) 've set my laser from stun to kill
Oh, great, great
Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death
'  - Rex points a flashlight out of Andy's bedroom window while Bo Peep, Slinky, Hamm and Potato Head look on
Some bushes rustle below
Hey, you guys
think 've found him
Buzz
Is that you
Rex points the flashlight beam at the shaking bushes
The annoyed  of a cat is heard
Whiskers
Will you get out of here
You're interfering with the search and rescue
: Rex turns off the flashlight
(whispering) Look
They're home
The toys duck behind the sill
The Davis' family van pulls into the driveway
Andy and Mrs
Davis get out
Mom, have you seen Woody
Where was the last place you left him
(searching the van) Right here in the van
Oh, 'm sure he's there
You're just not looking hard enough
He's not here, Mom
Woody's gone
The toys all look at one another
() Woody's gone
Well waddah-ya-know, the weasel ran away
Hamm, Potato Head and Rex walk away from the window
Huh
Huh
told you he was guilty
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities
Bo Peep and Slinky are left alone at the window, visibly crestfallen
Oh, Slink,  hope he's okay
: '   - (
) (as Interrogator) Oh, a survivor
Where is the rebel base
Talk
: '  - An inanimate Woody flies across the room, landing hard on the floor
Sid crosses to the window
(as Interrogator) can see your will is strong
Sid opens the window shade
Bright sunlight shines down onto Woody
(continued) Well, we have ways of making you talk
Sid pulls out a magnifying glass from his back pocket and focuses the beam on Woody's forehead
(as Interrogator) Where are your rebel friends now
Heh, heh
bright white hot dot forms on Woody's forehead and begins to smolder
'  (
) Sid
Your pop-tarts are ready
Sid pulls the magnifying glass away
Alright
Sid runs out of the room
As soon as he's gone, Woody jumps up , his forehead burning
He runs to a bowl of half-eaten cereal (with milk) on the floor, and dunks his head in
Buzz runs over to Woody, pausing to remove two suction cup darts from his person before pulling Woody out of the bowl
Two colorful Froot-Loops stick to each of Woody's eyes like glasses
Are you alright
(whacking him on the back) 'm proud of you, Sheriff lesser man would have talked under such torture
Woody looks at his reflection in the back of the cereal spoon and rubs the burn mark on his forehead
sure hope this isn't permanent
(checking his wrist communicator) Still no word from Star Command
We're not that far from the spaceport -- Woody's eyes light up
: Sid's bedroom door can be seen in the reflection
It's open
The door
It's open
We're free
Woody runs for the door
Buzz follows
Woody, we don't know what's out there
'll tell you what's --
suddenly appear and block their path to the doorway
Woody hides behind Buzz
They're gonna eat us, Buzz
Do something
Quick
Shield your eyes
Buzz fires his laser at them
The little red beam just flickers against Babyface's head
The mutant toys look confusedly at each other
It's not working
recharged it before  left
It should be good for hours -- Oh, you idiot
You're a toy
Use your karate chop action
Grabbing Buzz like a hostage, Woody fends off the mutant toys by pushing a large button on Buzz's back, making Buzz's arm involuntarily "chop" up and down
(to mutants) Get away
Hoo-cha
Hoo-cha
Hey
Hey
How are you doing that
Stop that
Back
Back, you savages
Back
Woody circles around the mutant toys to the open doorway, continually chopping Buzz's arm
Woody, stop it
Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled
Woody drops Buzz and runs out the door
- Woody races down the corridor
(to himself) There's no place like home
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
turns onto the top of the stairwell, down a few steps, and is confronted by
asleep on the landing
Woody freezes inches away from the sleeping beast
He slowly backs up the stairs
Suddenly Buzz appears and pulls Woody back against the hallway wall
He covers Woody's mouth with his hand
(muffled gasp) (whisper) Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed
(pulling Buzz's hand away) Don't tell me what to do
Shhh
Buzz checks to make sure Scud is still asleep and then darts across the stairwell opening to the other end of the hallway
Once safely across, he motions for Woody to follow
Woody cowardly crawls on all fours across the open area and meets up with Buzz
As he stands
' gets caught on one of the curls of the wrought iron railing
The toys begin to creep down the hallway, unaware that Woody's pullstring is being pulled farther and farther until -- It  off the iron railing and flies back towards Woody
( ) -
Both Buzz and Woody leap in surprise at the sound of Woody's voice box
: ' It opens
Woody vainly attempts to stifle the recoiling pullstring
( ) (continued) Giddy-up partner
, Scud starts up the stairs
( ) (continued) We got to get this wagon train a movin'
Woody and Buzz take off running
Split up
Two doors are ajar at the other end of the hallway
Buzz dives behind one while Woody jumps into
Woody slams the door shut just as Scud reaches the top of the landing
can be heard from behind the closet door, getting Scud's attention
Buzz peeks out from his doorway at Scud at the closet
Sensing movement behind him, Scud whips around and starts to enter Buzz's doorway
: The noise stops the dog in his tracks
Both Scud and Buzz look up to see
' '  - is asleep on a La--Boy recliner in front of the
Scud backs out and heads down the stairs
Buzz turns to exit the room when he hears
(
;  ) Calling Buzz Lightyear
Come in Buzz Lightyear
This is Star Command
Buzz Lightyear
Do you read me
Star Command
Buzz opens up his wrist communicator and is just about to speak into it when he is interrupted
#1 (
) Buzz Lightyear responding
Read you loud and clear
Buzz turns around to see
Buzz's space ranger logo is on the screen over a field of stars
The image quickly changes to two young boys playing in their backyard with a Buzz Lightyear doll
Buzz Lightyear, Planet Earth needs your help
#1 (into toy wrist communicator) On the way
(
) Buzz reacts with confusion at what he is watching
He walks slowly towards the television set
(
) The world's greatest superhero
Now the world's greatest
: The Buzz Lightyear doll is now out of the box and being displayed
(
) Buzz has it all
Locking wrist communicator
#1 Calling Buzz Lightyear
(
) Karate chop action
#2 Wow
With every feature demonstrated on the , Buzz compares the same feature on himself
(
) Pulsating laserlight
#2 Total annihilation
(
) Multi-phrase voice simulator
( ) It's a secret mission in uncharted space
Buzz presses the same button on his uniform
( ) It's a secret mission in uncharted space
(
) And best of all
(big "monster truck" voice) ---
To Infinity and Beyond
On the  screen, the Buzz Lightyear action figure appears to be launched through the air
The words: flash across the bottom of the screen
(
) (non-excited lawyer voice) Not a flying toy
Buzz slowly shakes his head in wide-eyed disbelief
(
) Get your Buzz Lightyear action figure and save a galaxy near you
(
) The image on the screen changes to a shot of hundreds of Buzzes in their boxes lining either side of a store aisle
(
) Available at all Al's Toy Barn outlets in the tri-county area
Buzz is stricken
He looks down at his wrist communicator and opens it
: Molded on the underside of the cover are three words: " " : "     " - Buzz walks dejectedly out of the den and down the hallway
As he passes the top of the stairwell he pauses to look up through the railing at
It is open, revealing the blue sky beyond
bird flies past
The taunting voice of Woody echoes in his head
(
) You are a toy
You can't fly
Buzz bows his head, defeated
Slowly Buzz raises his head, determination in his eyes
He slams the offending wrist communicator shut, as if to deny its message of "Made in Taiwan
" Buzz climbs up the railing to the banister
He pops open his wings, and aims himself towards the window above
To Infinity and Beyond
Buzz leaps off the banister
and falls
In   Buzz watches his square of blue sky pull farther away from him as he plummets to the floor below
' / - Buzz  on the entryway floor
Buzz opens his eyes to see
The broken arm lies a few inches away from his now empty arm socket
Buzz drops his head back in defeat
(
) -o-o-om
Mom, have you seen my Sally doll
Hannah walks into the entryway, and not seeing Buzz, steps on him
(
) What, dear
What was that
Hannah picks up Buzz (and his arm) and smiles
Nevermind
: - : The knob jiggles for a moment
Suddenly, the door flies open revealing Woody, entangled in Christmas lights, standing atop a pile of boxes to be at doorknob height
Woody and the rest of the junk topple over
bowling ball topples out, smashing Woody square on the head
Oo-o-of
(to the hallway) Buzz
The coast is clear
Buzz
Where are you
(
;  ) It's a secret mission in uncharted space
Let's go
Woody creeps down the hallway, dragging the Christmas lights with him
(
) Really
That is so-o-o interesting
Woody peeks into the open doorway of
' /  - Hannah is pretending to have a tea party
Her guests are dolls, headless dolls, that is except for
He is seated at the miniature table, dressed up in a frilly apron and fashionable party hat
(continued) Would you like some tea, Mrs
Nesbit
(under his breath) Buzz
Hannah has placed a tiny teapot in Buzz's severed arm and pours imaginary tea with it
It's so nice you could join us on such late notice
Woody steps back into the hallway
Oh, no
What a lovely hat, Mrs
Nesbit
It goes quite well with your head
Woody thinks for a moment, then takes a few steps further down the hall
He
(high voice) Hannah
Oh, Hannah
Hannah stops pouring tea and looks up
(yelling out her room) Mom
(to the dolls) Please excuse me, ladies
'll be right back
As soon as Hannah exits the room Buzz keels over face-down onto the table
Hannah passes Woody, hidden in the Christmas lights, and walks downstairs
What is it, Mom
Mom, where are you
Woody bolts into Hannah's room
Buzz
Hey, Buzz
Are you okay
Buzz lifts his head up and wails in drunken despair
Gone
It's all go-o-one
All of it's gone
Bye-bye
Whoo-hoo
See ya
Woody picks up Buzz's severed arm
What happened to you
One minute you're defending the whole galaxy
(pointing at other dolls) and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters
The headless dolls turn and wave
Woody removes the teapot from the severed arm and sets it on the table
think you've had enough tea for today
(helping Buzz up) Let's get you out of here, Buzz
(grabbing Woody) Don't you get it
You see the hat
am Mrs
Nesbit
(hysterical laughter) Snap out of it, Buzz
Woody presses Buzz's helmet open, slaps him across the face with his own detached arm, and then politely closes the helmet
Buzz sobers up and calmly takes his severed arm from Woody
Buzz walks out of the room while Woody follows
(sober) 'm sorry
You're right
- (continued) 'm just a little depressed, that's all
can get through this
Buzz reaches the center of the hallway and drops to his knees
Oh, 'm a sham
(loud whisper) Sh-h-h-h-h
Quiet, Buzz
Look at me
can't even fly out of a window
Woody stops short
He looks down the hallway in the direction of Sid's room
: ' Woody can see straight out Sid's window across the way to Andy's bedroom window
(continued) But -- the hat looked good
Tell me the hat looked good
The apron is a bit much, it's not my color
Out the window
Buzz, you're a genius
Woody grabs the coil of Christmas lights and drags Buzz towards Sid's room
(continued) Come on, this way
Years of Academy training
wasted
' /' Mr
Potato Head and Hamm are playing Battleship
Hamm's wearing Potato Head's hat
-3
Miss
-6
Ohhh
You sunk it
Heh-heh
Are you peeking
Oh, quit your whining and pay up
Potato Head reaches for his ear
No, no, not the ear
Gimme the nose
'mon
(pulling out his nose; nasally) How 'bout three out of five
He is about to hand his nose over to Hamm when
(
) Hey guys
Guys
Hey
Both toys look across the way
' /'   - Woody has just finished lifting Sid's window and waves to the toys
Son of a building block, it's Woody
He's in the psycho's bedroom
Hi
(into Andy's bedroom) Everyone, it's Woody
'  - Slinky, Bo Peep and Rex look to the window
Woody
You're kidding
Woody
' We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz
Buzz is not there
Woody looks down at the floor
Buzz is sitting on the floor, playing "bombs away" with his broken arm
'  /' The rest of Andy's toys gather around the window to see Woody
Hey, look
Woody
Boy, am  glad to see you guys
knew you'd come back, Woody
What are you doing over there
It's a long story, Bo
'll explain later
Here, catch this
Woody tosses one end of the Christmas lights over
Slinky catches them
got it, Woody
(overly excited) He got it, Woody
Good going, Slink
Now, just, just tie it on to something
Wait
Wait
got a better idea
How about we '
Potato Head grabs the string of lights away from Slinky
Hey
Potato Head
Did you all take stupid pills this morning
Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz
And now you want to let him back over here
No, no, no
You got it all wrong, Potato Head
Buzz is fine
Buzz is right here
He's with me
You are a liar
No, 'm not
(to Buzz) Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead
: He doesn't respond, preoccupied with peeling off the sticker on his wrist communicator
He crumples it up and tosses it aside
(to Andy's toys) Just a sec
'  - Frantic, Woody walks over to the edge of the desk
Buzz
Will you get up here and give me a hand
Buzz's severed arm comes flying into view and lands by Woody's feet
(insincerely) Ha ha
That's very funny, Buzz
(exploding) This is serious
(
) Hey, Woody
Where'd ya go
(
) He's lyin'
Buzz ain't there
' /' Woody reappears at the edge of Sid's window
He pretends to notice something out of the other toy's view
(forced casualness) Oh, hi Buzz
Why don't you say "hello" to the guys over there
' suddenly appears with Woody holding the end just out of sight
Woody throws his voice, pretending to be Buzz
( ) Hi ya, fellas
To infinity and beyond
Hey look
It's Buzz
(shaking the arm's hand) Yeah, hey Buzz
Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake
Gimme five, man
Something's screwy here
So, you see
We're friends now, guys
Aren't we, Buzz
(as ) You bet
Gimme a hug
Woody makes Buzz's arm grab his neck and pull him forward
(continued; as himself) Ha, ha, oh,  love you, too
See
It is Buzz
Now give back the lights, Potato Head
Wait just a minute
What are you trying to pull
Nothing
Woody innocently shrugs and throws both his hands up
exposing the severed arm
The toys all  in horror
Rex clasps his hands to his mouth and turns away to
Realizing his mistake, Woody tries to hide the arm, but it's too late
Oh, that is disgusting
Murderer
No
No, no, no, no
You murdering dog
No, it's not what you think,  swear
Save it for the jury
hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep
Potato Head drops the lights
No
No
Don't leave
Don't leave
You've gotta help us, please
You don't know what it's like over here
(to the other toys) Come on
Let's get out of here
Go back to your lives, citizens
Show's over
All the toys leave the window except Slinky
Come back
Slink
Slink, please
Please
Listen to me
Unable to look Woody in the eye, Slinky closes the blinds
(continued) No
No
Come back
---
: As storm clouds roll over Sid's house, Woody slumps over the window sill in defeat
'  - emit from behind Woody
He turns from the window to see
converging all around Buzz
Still holding onto Buzz's arm, Woody jumps down from the desk and runs to Buzz's rescue
Go away, you disgusting freaks
Babyface turns from the fray and charges at Woody with his erector-set pinchers
Woody cowers, shielding himself from Buzz's arm
Babyface clamps onto the arm and has a tug-o-war with Woody
Alright back
Back, you cannibals
Woody loses his grip on the arm and sails across the room, crashing into the wall
By now there is no sight of Buzz within the swarming mass of mutant toys
Woody attacks the mob with a vengeance
He is still alive, and you're not gonna get him, you monsters
He furiously throws the mutant toys aside, digging his way to
He is sitting up, his broken arm now newly-attached
Woody's anger turns to confusion
Hey
Hey, they fixed you
Woody shakes Buzz's arm to confirm what he's seeing is real when he looks to the mutants
(continued) But -- but they're cannibals
We saw them eat those other toys
The mutant toys part to reveal the recent victims of Sid's last "operation": The Janie Doll and Pterodactyl
Their heads have been taped back on the correct bodies
The mutants all innocently stare at Woody
Uh
sorry
thought that you were gonna
(laughs nervously) you know, eat my friend
Immediately, the mutant toys retreat back into the dark corners of the room
Hey
No, no, wait
Hey
What's wrong
'  (
) Sid
(
) Not now, Mom, 'm
Sid
approach the bedroom
Woody tries to pick up the still depressed Buzz, but he just goes limp
Buzz
'mon, get up
Buzz, you're
() get up
Woody begins dragging Buzz towards the bed, but their progress is too slow
He shakes Buzz hard
Fine
Let Sid trash you
But don't blame me
Woody leaves Buzz sitting alone in the middle of the floor and hides underneath a nearby milkcrate just as
Sid enters carrying a big box
It came
It finally came
Sid runs over to his workbench and rips open the box
(reverently) The big one
He pulls out a rocket with "  " written on it
(reading the rocket label) "Extremely dangerous
Keep out of reach of children
"
(looks around) What am  gonna blow
Man
hey, where's that wimpy cowboy doll
Sid spots the milkcrate and picks it up
No Woody
: Out of Sid's view, Woody presses against the inside, hanging on for dear life
: ' Sid looks down and notices he's stepping on Buzz, activating his laser
Yes
've always wanted to put a spaceman into orbit
Ha-ha
He places Buzz and the milkcrate on the workbench and throws a toolbox on top of the crate
The impact of the toolbox dislodges Woody from his hiding place
Woody quickly ducks under a magazine on the floor of the crate "jail
" Woody watches helplessly as Sid fishes out a roll of electrical tape from the toolbox and, with an , tapes Buzz to the rocket
: flash of lightning interrupts the moment
Oh, no
Sid crosses to the window to see a huge rainstorm commence
Sullenly, he smacks his head against the window
Aw, man
Woody heaves a  of relief
Suddenly Sid's face brightens
He turns his focus from the rain to the Buzzrocket
(as Newscaster) Sid Phillips reporting
Launch of the shuttle has been delayed due to adverse weather conditions at the launch site
Tomorrow's forecast
Sid smacks Buzz down on the desk, winds his alarm clock, and places it next to Buzz
Sunny
Ha-ha-ha
Sweet dreams
'  - Andy is being tucked into bed by his mother
She hands him his cowboy hat
looked everywhere, honey, but all could find was your hat
(groggy) But what if we leave them behind
Oh, don't worry, honey, 'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow
Andy's eyes shut
Mom turns out the light and quietly exits the room
moving box on the floor, with the words "Andy's Toys
" scrawled on it, begins to shake from side to side
(
) (muffled) Aaaah
need air
Rex pops out of the top of the box,  a packing styrofoam peanut out of his mouth
Potato Head appears beside him
(relieved) Aa-a-a-a-ah
() Will you quit moving around
'm sorry
It's just that  get so nervous before  travel
How did  get stuck with  as a moving buddy
Potato Head drops back down into the box
(following Potato Head) Everyone else was picked
peeks around the corner of one of the boxes and looks up at Andy fast asleep clutching his cowboy hat
Oh, Woody, if only you could see how much Andy misses you
'  - as rain pours down outside the spooky dwelling
' Sid is in bed fast asleep
Woody struggles to move his milkcrate jail, but with the weight of the toolbox on top it won't budge
Woody looks across the desktop at Buzz sitting dejectedly with the rocket strapped to his back
Ps-s-s-s-t
Psst
Hey, Buzz
No reaction from Buzz
Woody picks up a stray washer from the desktop and flings it at Buzz, striking his helmet
Buzz lifts his head and turns lifelessly to look at Woody
Hey
Get over here and see if you can get this tool box off me
Buzz just looks away from Woody and bows his head
Oh, come on, Buzz
Buzz, can't do this without you
need your help
can't help
can't help anyone
Why, sure you can, Buzz
You can get me out of here and then 'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house
Andy's house
Sid's house
What's the difference
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall
You must not be thinking clearly
No, Woody, for the first time  am thinking clearly
(looking at himself) You were right all along
'm not a Space Ranger
'm just a toy stupid little insignificant toy
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute
Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger
Yeah, right
No, it is
Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a
You are toy
But why would Andy want me
Why would Andy want you
Look at you
You're a Buzz Lightyear
Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you
You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a  toy
Woody pauses and looks at himself
(continued; depressed) As a matter of fact you're too cool
mean --  mean what chance does a toy like me have against a Buzz Lightyear action figure
All  can do is
Woody pulls his own pull-string
( ) There's a snake in my boots
Woody bows his head
Why would Andy ever want to play with me, when he's got you
(pause) 'm the one that should be strapped to that rocket
Woody slumps dejectedly against the crate, his back to Buzz
Buzz lifts up his foot
:    ' The signature "" reads through the dirt and scuff marks
Buzz gazes back at Woody
look of determination spreads across his face
Listen Buzz, forget about me
You should get out of here while you can
Silence
Woody turns around
Buzz is gone
Suddenly, the entire milkcrate begins to shake
Woody looks up to see
He is on top of the milkcrate, trying to push the tool box off
Buzz
What are you doing thought you were -- Come on, Sheriff
There's a kid over in that house who needs us
Now let's get you out of this thing
Yes Sir
Both Buzz and Woody push the milkcrate and together, they finally get it to move but it's slow progress
(strained) Come on, Buzz
We can do it
: The two toys stop to look out the window by the workbench
:  ' With the rain stopped and the sun beginning to rise
can be seen pulling up in front of Andy's house
Woody
It's the moving van
We've got to get out of here
Buzz braces himself between the tool chest and the wall
Using his legs, Buzz pushes with all his might
The toolbox begins to move
Woody notices that with every shove Buzz gives to the tool chest, the milkcrate begins to edge out over the lip of the desk
'mon, Buzz
Finally the gap is wide enough for Woody to jump through
Woody drops down to the floor below
(loud whisper) Alright
Buzz
Hey
'm out
Buzz doesn't hear Woody and continues to shove the toolbox (and milkcrate) farther out
almost () there () Woody looks up just in time to see the entire toolbox and milkcrate topple towards him
(nervous laugh) The toolbox  right on top of Woody
Buzz falls onto the desktop and glances over to Sid, who stirs
(in his sleep) wanna ride the pony
Sid does not wake
Buzz heaves a   , then peers over the edge of the workbench
Woody
Woody
Are you alright
Woody lifts himself out from under the rubble
(punch-drunk) No, 'm fine
'm okay
: It goes off by Sid's bed
Woody drops back under the toolbox and Buzz goes limp
Sid groggily sits up for a beat, then his eyes light up
Oh, yeah
Time for lift-off
Sid jumps out of bed, grabs Buzz and bolts out of the room
(
) Woody leaps to his feet, runs across the room, and catches the door just before it closes
As he swings the door back open Woody is confronted by
The dog barrels down the hallway straight for Woody
Aaah
Back
Back
Down
Down
Woody slams the door shut just in time
Scud at the door
(out of breath; to himself) Okay, what do  do
Come on Woody, think
Woody looks across the room
have appeared all around the room
Guys
The mutant toys all scatter and hide
No, no, no
Wait
Wait
Listen
Please
There's a good toy down there and he's -- he's going to be blown to bits in a few minutes all because of me
've gotta save him
(pause) -- But  need your help
No response
Woody then notices Babyface timidly peeking out of the shadows from under the bed
Please
He's my friend
He's the only one 've got
Babyface crawls out and bangs in code on the side of Sid's metal bedpost
The mutant toys emerge from the shadows, and gather around Woody
He kneels down into a huddle with them
(to Babyface) Thank you
(to the others) Okay
think  know what to do
We're going to have to break a few rules, but if it works, it'll help everybody
' cart out the last load
forlorn Andy clutches onto Buzz's "spaceship" box in one hand and his cowboy hat in the other
Andy scans the empty room and heaves a sad
Sid comes out of the she carrying a bunch of materials under his arm
(as Astronaut) Houston to Mission Control
Come in, Control
He drops the junk down beside an inanimate Buzz
(continued) Launch pad is being constructed
Heh-heh
' Scud is planted right outside Sid's bedroom door, poised to attack anything that exits
'  - Woody has created a little diagram of the house and yard out of dominoes and Scrabble tiles
He points to it with a pencil as he addresses the mutants
All right, listen up
need Pump Boy here -- Ducky here
Legs
, the toy fishing rod with fashion doll legs, steps forward from the crowd
(continued; to Legs) You're with Ducky
(to the others) RollerBob and  don't move till we get the signal
Clear
The mutants all give an affirmative nod
Okay, let's move
The toys all break
Legs and , a duck head Pez dispenser with baby doll torso and plunger base, rush over to a heating grate and pull the face plate off the wall
They disappear into the heating duct
- Ducky and Legs come to an intersection
Ducky  and they head down the right tunnel
' ---, the rubber hand in the Jack-in-the-box, stacks on top of several mutant toys to reach the doorknob of the bedroom door
Woody hops onto , a skateboard with a soldier's upper torso tied to its front
Wind the frog
, a Hot Wheels car with baby arms, begins winding up  , a tin wind-up frog with monster truck wheels instead of legs
' / bottom of wall insulation is pushed aside to reveal Ducky and Legs
They make their way towards a junction box sitting in the center of the floor
Ducky and Legs lift the loose junction box
' /  - suddenly lifts upward and disappears into the roof
Ducky extends his Pez neck out of the hole to check that the coast is clear
' All the toys have manned their positions and wait silently, their eyes fixed on Woody
Wait for the signal
Ducky takes the end of the line off Legs' fishing reel, hooks it onto himself, and is then lowered down through the open hole
- Hanging halfway down the front door, Ducky begins to swing
Eventually he swings far enough to reach his destination: the doorbell
Ducky presses it
: ' Woody throws his arm down
Go
Hand-in-the-box throws open the door and The Frog is let loose
The Frog zips through Scud's legs and down the hallway
Scud chases after it and follows it down the stairs
: (
) 'll get it
Woody helps the rest of the mutant toys onto the skateboard
Alright, let's go
Using his front arms, Rollerbob propels the skateboard and crew out into the hallway
' / : Hannah walks to the front door
'm coming
'm coming
and opens it
/
- Nobody's there
Hannah doesn't notice Ducky stuck to the porch floor by his plunger
zooms down the stairs with Scud  right behind
The Frog leaps off the last step, speeds through Hannah's legs and out the open front door
Hannah looks back inside at Scud
In that moment, Ducky catches the Frog and is quickly reeled upwards back into the roof
Scud bursts through Hannah's legs, knocking her over, and runs out onto the empty porch
(annoyed) Scud suddenly realizes he's been duped, but before he can get back inside, Hannah slams the front door shut
Stupid dog
Scud smashes into the closed door and begins  furiously
As Hannah storms off into another room she doesn't notice Woody and the mutants zipping off the stairs and round the corner, heading straight into the kitchen
- By now RollerBob has really picked up speed
He shoots underneath the kitchen table, through the maze of chair legs, straight towards
Lean back
The mutants all push back causing the RollerBob to do a wheelie
They smash through the doggie door
'  - and catapult into the bushes
The toys peek out from the bush to see Buzz strapped to the launchpad
Sid is still in the toolshed
(
;  ) Uh, Mission Control
is the launchpad construction complete
-- (simulated static) Uh, Roger, rocket is now secured to guide wire
We are currently obtaining the
ignition sticks
Countdown will commence momentarily
Stand by -- (simulated static) Ducky, Legs, and the Frog shoot out into the yard from a drain pipe
They exchange a thumbs-up with Woody
(to toys in the bush) Let's go
The mutants disperse to their designated places in the yard
(
) Hey, Mom
Where are the matches
Oh, oh, wait, here they are
Nevermind
Woody runs towards Buzz, who spots Woody approaching
(loud whisper) Woody
Great
Help me out of this thing
Woody stops a few feet away from Buzz
Shhhhhhh
What
(loud whisper) It's ok
Everything's under control
Woody deliberately falls down limp on the grass
Woody
What are you doing
Sid emerges from the tool shed
Buzz freezes
( ) Houston, all systems are go
Requesting permission to launch -- (spotting Woody) Hey
How'd you get out here
Sid picks up Woody, examines him for a beat and then smiles
Oh, well, you and  can have a cookout later
Ha-ha-ha
He sticks a match prominently in Woody's holster and tosses him onto the grill of an open barbecue
( ) Houston, do we have permission to launch
-- (simulated static) Uh, Roger, permission granted
You are confirmed at  minus 10 seconds
During Sid's countdown, all the mutants scurry into their final positions
Sid lights a match
(continued) and counting
Ten
Nine
Eight
Seven
Six
Five
Four
Three
Two
One
Sid grins menacingly as the match moves towards the fuse
( ) Reach for the sky
Huh
Sid pulls back from lighting the fuse
He turns to look at Woody still lying lifelessly atop the barbecue except for the sound emitting from his voice box
( ) This town ain't big enough for the two of us
What
Sid walks over to Woody and picks him up
( ) Somebody's poisoned the water hole
It's busted
He raises Woody up, about to throw him away -- ( ) Who are you callin' busted, Buster
Sid stops short and looks at Woody again
( ) (continued) That's right
'm talking to , Sid Phillips
We don't like being blown up, Sid, or smashed, or ripped apart
While Woody's voice box talks, Sid checks the pullstring
It isn't moving
Sid
-w-w-we
( ) That's right
(beat) Your toys
The remains of broken toys in the yard, led by the bedroom mutants, begin rising from the ground in " " fashion
The toys march forward, forming a circle around Sid
Sid is too frightened to scream or move
( ) From now on, you must take good care of your toys
Because if you don't, we'll find out, Sid
We toys can see
Woody's inanimate head rotates 360 degrees
( ) (continued) everything
For a split second Woody's face comes to life
(regular voice) So play nice
Sid drops Woody and bolts inside the house
Woody and all the toys
' Hannah has just come downstairs carrying a new doll when Sid rushes up to her
The toys
The toys are alive
Sid eyes Hannah's doll and pats it gently on the head
(continued) --Nice dolly
Hannah, sensing Sid's fear, suddenly thrusts the doll in Sid's face
He  and runs upstairs
Hannah chases after him, taunting
What's wrong, Sid
Don't you want to play with Sally
' The toys are all congratulating one another
Nice work, fellahs
Good job
Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch
That was a stroke of genius
Woody
Woody turns around and looks at Buzz, who's still affixed to Sid's launchpad
Buzz extends his hand to Woody
Thanks
They shake
: (
) Everybody say, "Bye, house
" (
) (depressed) Bye, house
Buzz and Woody look in the direction of Andy's house
: '  - Through the fence, Andy and his family can be seen getting into the van
Woody
The van
Woody quickly hoists Buzz off the pole he was tied to
(to mutant toys) We gotta run
Thanks, guys
With the rocket still taped to Buzz, the two toys sprint towards the fence
: Quick
Woody easily slips through the slats in the fence, but Buzz's rocket causes him to become stuck
'  - Woody has climbed up on to the rear bumper of the van before realizing that Buzz is missing
He looks back to discover Buzz stuck in the fence
Just go
'll catch up
Woody jumps down and runs back for Buzz
The van begins pulling out of the driveway
Woody tugs on a loosened slat and breaks Buzz free of the fence
The two toys run out into the street just in time to see the van driving off down the street
: Woody and Buzz turn around
drives right over them
Woody and Buzz , ducking just in time
After the truck passes, Buzz runs after it with Woody a few steps behind
Come on
: ' Scud is lying on the porch when he suddenly perks up at the sight of the two tiny toys running down the street after the moving truck
Scud bears his teeth and
Buzz runs up close to the truck with Woody still back a few paces
dangles off the back of the truck
Buzz makes a leap for it and grabs hold
He climbs up the strap and onto the bumper
Woody then lunges for the strap but it stays just out of reach
You can do it, Woody
Woody gives a mighty leap and catches hold of the strap
Whew,  made it
Woody begins climbing up when suddenly Buzz goes pale
Woody looks behind him to see
The dog leaps forward and bites down on one of Woody's legs
(kicking Scud with other foot) Aaaaaahh
Get away, you stupid dog
Down
Down
Scud tugs on Woody, pulling him down to the end of the strap
Hold on, Woody
can't do it
Take care of Andy for me
------
Buzz leaps off of the truck and onto Scuds snout
He grabs Scud's eyelids and snaps them hard
Scud , letting go of Woody
The dog bucks wildly with Buzz hanging onto his face
Buzz
The moving truck continues down the street leaving Buzz and Scud behind
Still hanging onto the strap, Woody scrambles up onto the bumper
He unlocks the back door of the truck and tries to lift up the heavy door
Suddenly, the family van and moving truck come to a stop at a traffic light
Woody slams into the door, causing it to fly upward taking Woody with it
Hanging from the door, Woody scans the inside of the truck until he spots what he's looking for
with the words "' " written on them in crayon
Scud flings Buzz off his face
Buzz goes tumbling under a parked car
Scud runs over to the car, but is too big to get under it
Woody rips into one of Andy's boxes
: All the toys wince and  as they cover their eyes from the sudden brightness
What
Are we there already
Woody
How'd you -- Woody's response is to slide the box aside and begin rummaging through the next box
Slinky, Potato Head, Rex and the other toys as they poke their heads up out of the first box
Ah-hah
There you are
Woody pulls the  Car and its remote out of the second box
Hey
What's he doing
Woody runs to the back of the truck and throws the  Car out onto the street
The other toys  in horror
He's at it again
-
/ Woody turns on the remote and steers the  car past Scud and under the parked car where Buzz is hiding
's motor  happily at the sight of Buzz
The traffic light turns green allowing the van and truck to cross the intersection
(pointing at Woody) Get him
All the toys pour out of their boxes and  on Woody
Ah-h
Ah-h
No, no
Woody continues to steer the remote while trying to avoid the angry mob of toys
Buzz jumps on to the  car and they zoom back towards the moving truck
Scud is right on their heels and is about to chomp down on Buzz -- Rocky picks up Woody and spins him over his head
No, no, no
Wait
(as Rocky spins him) Whoa-Whoa-Whoa
-- The  car suddenly swerves from Scud's jaws and starts doing doughnuts (matching Woody's) in the middle of the street
(spinning) Whoa-Whoa-Whoa
Rocky throws Woody to the floor
--  resumes his course straight down the street with Scud giving close chase
Hamm leaps off a pile of boxes and onto Woody
Pig pile
-- The  car hops up in the air, tossing Buzz up and off
Buzz manages to land back on , but facing backwards
: It changes red again and the wall of cross traffic resumes
Buzz and the  car drive straight into it
Scud blindly follows them into the traffic and skids to a halt just missing a car
The car swerves and  into another car
Soon there is a multi-car pile up that encircles Scud, entrapping the dog
Buzz and the  car emerge from the intersection safely on the other side
The mob of toys lift up Woody (still holding the remote) and head for the open back
No wait
You don't understand
Buzz is out there
We've gotta help him
Toss 'im overboard
No, no, no, wait
The toys toss him out into the road
As the truck drives off, the toys
So long Woody
- : Woody turns around and ducks just in time as a car passes over him
Shaken, Woody tries to get up again when
& come barreling towards him
Who-o-o-oa
Woody
The  Car sweeps up Woody and keeps driving
Woody finds himself sitting in front of Buzz (still holding the remote)
Well, thanks for the ride
(pointing ahead) Look out
The toys are about to slam into the rear tire of the car that had passed over Woody earlier
Woody  and gives the steering wheel on the remote a hard left, missing the tire by inches
The  Car moves up under the car
Now let's catch up to that truck
: Woody flicks a switch from "" to "
" The  Car speeds up towards the moving truck
The toys are busy  one another when Lenny, the wind-up binoculars, glances out the back and spots Buzz and Woody
Guys
Guys
Woody's riding
And Buzz is with him
What
The toys rush to the edge of the open truck
Bo picks up Lenny and looks through him
:     & It is Buzz
Woody was telling the truth
What have we done
Great
Now  have guilt
/ The  Car begins to gain on the truck
We're almost there
Rocky
The ramp
Rocky, the wrestler doll, rushes over to a lever on the side of the back
The sign above it reads ": /
" Rocky pushes down hard on the lever
The ramp begins to lower
Woody & Buzz look up to see the ramp about to come down right on top of them
Look out
The  Car pulls back just before the heavy ramp slams into the road
Sparks fly everywhere from the metal scraping the pavement
(to other toys) Quick
Hold on to my tail
Potato Head and Rex grabs on to Slinky's tail allowing Slinky's front end to jump off the truck and onto the ramp
Slinky leans forward with his paw outstretched to Woody
Woody hands the remote to Buzz and leans forward to grab Slinky's hand
:  & ' They grab hold of one another
That a boy, Slink
All of a sudden, the  Car begins to slow down pulling Slinky's front end off the ramp
Woody
His slinky middle begins to stretch and stretch
Woody
Speed up
(to Buzz) Speed up
The batteries
They're running out
's headlight eyes sag
The car slows even more
As Slinky continues stretching
The  Car begins to weave side-to-side like a water skier
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
With Mom and Andy preoccupied, baby Molly looks in her sideview mirror
: The  Car (w/ Woody and Buzz) weaves into view and then back out
Molly  with delight
/ With Slinky's mid-section stretched to the limit, he begins to lose his grip on Woody
can't hold on much longer
Slink
Hang on
Slinky's hand slips, sending his front shooting back into the moving truck and knocking over all the toys
The  Car sputters to a stop
Woody and Buzz watch in vain as the family van and moving truck disappear
Buzz tosses the remote to the ground in frustration
(sarcastic) Great
Woody
The rocket
The match
Woody pulls out the match from his holster that Sid had put there earlier
(continued) Yes
Thank you, Sid
Woody runs around behind Buzz, strikes the match against 's back tire, and is about to light the fuse when
whizzes right over them, blowing out the match
Woody clenches the burnt match in his hands and falls prostrate to the ground
No-o-o
No-no-no-no
No-o-o
Unable to watch a cowboy cry, Buzz bows his head, causing his helmet to block the sun from Woody
As Buzz's shadow passes over him, Woody stops whimpering and looks at his hand
like the one generated from Sid's magnifying glass, appears on the back of Woody's hand
Woody leaps up, grabs Buzz's helmet and aligns it so the white dot hits the tip of the fuse
Woody
What are you doing
Hold still, Buzz
The fuse lights
Ha-ha
You did it
Next stop
Andy
Woody jumps back onto the car then suddenly stops smiling
Wait a minute
just lit a rocket
Rockets explo -- : The  Car rockets forward
Speeding along the dividing line in the road, it easily passes car after car until the moving truck can be seen on the horizon
The toys are gathered around Slinky, his spring splayed out on the floor
shoulda held on longer
Lenny looks out the back again
Look
Look
It's Woody and Buzz
Comin' up fast
The toys run to the opening and
: The rocket is so strong that it begins to lift Buzz and Woody off the  Car
Woody manages to continue holding onto  -- but not for long
The toys  turns to  as they rush to get out of the way of the oncoming " rocket
" Take cover
Woody is forced to let go of the  Car
They separate, sending the two toys upward and  into the back of the truck
smashes into Potato Head, sending all of his parts flying
- The rocket hurtles upward higher and higher
Ahhh
This is the part where we blow up
Not today
Buzz confidently presses the button on his chest
jut out of Buzz, severing the tape that holds him to rocket
The toys separate from the rocket just before it
The toys plummet
(covering his eyes) Ah-h-h-h-h
Just then Buzz banks under some power lines and soars upward again
Woody takes a peek
They're flying
Hey, Buzz
You're flying
This isn't flying
This is falling -- with style
Ha ha
To Infinity and Beyond
They soar gracefully towards the moving truck, but then pass over it
Uh, Buzz
We missed the truck
We're not aiming for the truck
: Buzz and Woody fly right over the van's sun roof and then drop into the car
- Before anyone can notice, Woody and Buzz land in an open box in the back seat right next to Andy
Andy turns to discover the limp Buzz and Woody lying in the box
Hey
Wow
What
What is it
(picking up the toys) Woody
Buzz
Oh, great, you found them
Where were they
Here
In the car
See
Now, what did  tell you
Right where you left them
Andy hugs both toys
- They give each other a knowing wink
: '   -   - Through the gently falling snow, the Davis family can be seen around the Christmas tree unwrapping presents
Which one can  open first
Let's let Molly open one
'  /  - One of the Christmas bulbs moves aside to reveal
The plastic green soldier spies on the Davis family with his binoculars
He turns and motions back into the tree
baby monitor sits wedged between some branches supported by several green army men
One of the soldiers turns it on
' The receiving end of the monitor is atop Andy's night stand
It
(
) (over the monitor) Frankincense, this is Myrrh
Come in, Frankincense
Buzz sits on the edge of Andy's bed while Hamm rests on the nightstand alongside the monitor
They listen intently
(to the room) Hey, heads up everybody
It's showtime
Woody and the rest of the toys are  together like a typical office Christmas party
Oh
It's time
The toys all stop and run towards the monitor
Woody is about to follow when a crook pulls him backwards to reveal
Whoooooah
Oh
Bo
(rubbing his neck) There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention
Merry Christmas, Sheriff
She smiles and points her crook upwards to her sheep perched on a shelf dangling mistletoe
Say, isn't that mistletoe
Mm-hmmmmm
Bo drops her crook, dips Woody and  him
The rest of the toys have congregated below the monitor restless with "excitement" not fear
(to Slinky) Maybe Andy'll get another dinosaur, like a leaf-eater
That way, could play the, uh, dominant predator
Ha ha ha
Slinky  with Rex
Quiet everyone, quiet
(
) (over monitor) Molly's first present i-i-is
Mrs
Potato Head
Repeat
Mrs
Potato Head
Way to go, Idaho
All the toys  Potato Head
Gee,  better shave
Potato Head whips off his moustache piece
Woody climbs up onto the bed and joins Buzz
Lipstick now covers Woody's face
(
) (over monitor) Come in, Frankincense
Andy is now opening his first present -- () Buzz bangs on the side of the monitor
Nothing
Buzz
Buzz Lightyear
You are not worried, are you
(
) (over monitor) can't quite make out -- () (defensively) Me
No, no, no, no
(beat) Are you
(laughing) Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you
We   through the window to the
as we
(
) Oh, what is it
What is it
: (
) Wow
puppy
We   through the window to a   of Buzz and Woody
