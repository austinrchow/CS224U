Crickets chirping, sprinklers sprinkling
We  across one particular lawn, up one particular tree, where we see   (Jon Lovitz) sitting on a limb
He has a bottle of wine, some sandwiches, a Walkman
Suddenly the lights turn on
(whispering) Showtime
We see a young mother walk into the room outside the Peeper's window
She is wearing business attire
(') Rough day at the office Mrs
Dunleavy
(takes bite of sandwich) Well you'll feel better once you slip off those work clothes and get into some sweats
The mother sits on the bed and pulls off her shoes, rubbing her feet
(') Oh my -, yes
wish you would let me rub those feet
Of course  wouldn't use my hands
Heh heh heh heh
He sips some wine
The mother starts to unbutton her blouse
She takes it off, revealing a nice bra
(') Looks like Victoria just told me her secret
The peeper frantically writes in a dirty notebook
Mouthing the words as he goes
(') Thursday the ninth, eight-thirty p
m
, first brassiere sighting
(stops writing) will pleasure myself to this image for months
The mother starts to unbutton her pants
Her young son walks in wearing a scouts uniform
(') Young Scottie Dunleavy
What unfortunate timing
You mother was just getting comfy
The son talks to his mother excitedly
(') Yes, yes, 'm sure you tied many great knots today or whatever
Now get out
The son, not going anywhere, sits in a chair
(') Now what
This simply won't do
The peeper takes out a cell phone and dials
The son answers
Hello
Hello, Scottie
Why don't you go downstairs like a good boy and let your mother freshen up
Who is this
Just a little birdie
birdie who wants to see if your mother's panties match her bra
Oh my - Scottie
Is there a man up our tree
The peeper gets nervous
Tell her no
Tell her it's just a big bird
The peeper starts flapping his arms and making bird noises
We  Scottie with his sling shot
The mother nods yes
He shoots it
It hits the peeper square in the head
He falls to the ground with a thud
(') Mrs
Dunleavy, please come help me
And wear your bikini
The peeper looks up
He sees Scottie pushing a television out the window
It lands on top of the peeper
He's dead
: - The peeper is zooming down a hole, walls of dirt racing by on all sides
The peeper is falling down, down, down
The whole way screaming like a five-year old girl
' We see the tunnel turn into more of a slide now and the peeper races towards the opening which is lit by fire
He We see the /
We hear screaming
Wham
We see the peeper come flying through the flames and land in a heap in a shallow pit of coals
Dazed, he stands and we see other people shooting through the fire wall at different levels
(: All the arrivals clothes are now burned & shredded)
(
) Welcome
The peeper looks left to see the  standing at his station greeting the new  with mock cheer
Am  in hell
What do you think
appears and bites the peeper's crotch area
We leave the peeper in the pit and tilt up to
: "   " The  and insane kingdom of Hell
road leads toward it like the yellow brick road only with fire and coals
We see the black castle in the distance
The camera zooms into the castle, to one particular window
'  - Looks like an American teenager's room - models, a dresser, heavy metal posters (tons of  stuff) everywhere (but no bed - Devils don't sleep)
Nicky is air guitaring to the song
Over at the stereo, we see the cassette playing titled "'
" The head demon,   , opens the door, scaring who falls backward into the table, breaking it
(embarrassed) Hey
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room
Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'
- and  are playing darts
They're aiming for people's faces that are coming through the wall
knew it
He's finally retiring
've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years
He throws a dart that hits one of the heads in the forehead
Aaaah
If the old man picks me to take over Hell, 'll keep the torture going twenty four seven
No breaks
Well Dad says it's the breaks that make the torture
You have to let people feel a sense of relief
Cassius whips a dart which hits one of the in the eye
Aaaaaaaaaaaah
Then again, the beauty of Dad retiring is what he says doesn't matter anymore
Cassius pulls out the dart
The eye comes with it
'll take that
Cassius throws the eye on the ground and stomps it
It splatters like a grape
Was that really necessary
Nicky enters sheepishly
Hey, how's Daddy's little girl doing today
Good, thanks
Cassius snaps his fingers in Nicky's face
Hey
Hey
Hey
Wanna mind wrestle
Cassius' eyes start glowing red
Actually, 'll take a rain check on0 Nicky is slammed into a nearby desk as if by an invisible force
Got ya
(picking up his head) Yes, you got me
Nicky's head slams back down again
Got ya, again
(picking head up) Got me for sure, yes
He grabs a lamp off the desk and cracks himself over the head
Got ya
Now here's the big finish
Nicky frowns as he finds his own right hand heading for his own crotch
Oh no
Please Cassius
Nicky's hand is being possessed
It gets closer and closer until it latches on to Nicky's crotch
(') Aaaaah
Cassius concentrates even harder, making Nicky twist his own hand
Nicky screams even louder
Adrian smiles
They don't notice that , wearing a sweatsuit (and with very small devil horns), enters behind them
What are you boys doing
Cassius releases Nicky's hand
Nothing, Dad
Just re-arranging the furniture
Cassius, didn't  tell you to stay out of your brother's mind
forgot
Maybe this will help you remember
Dad's eyes flash red and Cassius punches himself hard in the nose, sending him back against the wall and down to the floor
Dad gives Nicky a wink
Nicky smiles
Dad has an air of confidence and power
(') Now everybody sit down
Hey, Dad, 'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape
really think it's a masterpiece
Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later
He leads the boys to the throne area
We see outside the window the peeper staring in sexily
Dad looks, shakes his head
Just then,   appears and attacks him
Dad closes the curtains
Nicky, Adrian and Cassius sit on little stools at the foot of his throne
Dad lights a cigarette with his finger, the tip of which glows red like a cigarette lighter and looks down at his three sons
(') My dad, your granddad, Lucifer, was thrown out of Heaven by -d and rules here in hell for ten thousand years
And after this ten thousand years had passed, he decided to abdicate his throne
Confused, Nicky sheepishly raises his hand
(') to step aside
(Nicky lowers his hand) and let me become the ruler of hell
This, as some of you might know, is my ten thousandth year as Prince of Darkness
So  think the time has come to discuss who will succeed me
Jimmy the Demon walks in
Knock, knock
Yes, Jimmy
He whispers in Dad's ear
(') No, no, that's not what  said
He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go
(turning to leave) Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock
Dad nods, and Jimmy shuffles out
Dad turns his attention back to his sons
This was a very difficult decision, because  have three wonderful sons mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless
And Cassius, so strong, so tough
And Nicky, so
so
Don't worry about coming up with anything
It's cool
Such a sweet boy
But after much thought and careful consideration, 've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be
me
(dumbfounded) What
Hallelujah
They all look at Nicky
(') mean
tough break
The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil
And  don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet
You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time
Dad
This is Hoyashit
Dad glares
Cassius goes
One of the Human Dartboards laughs
Cassius whips a dart and hits him in the tongue
Jimmy enters and points at his watch
Right
Right
Send him in
(to the boys) 'm sorry, boys
've got to get back to work
Nicky, Cassius and Adrian start filing out
Adrian stops
You sure about this decision, Dad
'm telling you, pal, it's the right thing to do
(in a French maid's outfit), is being brought in by Jimmy
They head towards the closet
Inside the closet is a crate of pineapples
Hitler picks out a relatively small one
Dad shakes his head "no
"  Dad walks over to the closet
Hitler picks out a really big pineapple
Dad nods "yes
"  Hitler sadly hands it to Dad
Jimmy bends Hitler over and as Dad raises the fruit
' As the pineapple's jammed up his ass
Holy schnit
- Cassius and Adrian are standing by the road still flowing with souls
Both are pissed
There's a big, ugly, Bigfoot looking  hanging out with them, kind of nodding along
You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that
And he's dead serious
It's just such a slap in the face
Adrian turns to the Monster
Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here
Yeah, get out of here
Beat it
Cassius insanely snaps his fingers in the Monster's face
The Monster shrugs and walks off
Twenty-thousand years ago, Grandpa Lucifer said, "It is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven
"  Well, 'm getting tired of serving in Hell
We need a place where we can rule
Cassius throws a rock at the Monster
He yelps, then turns around, motioning like he's thinking about coming back
Cassius sees this and gets enraged
Oh you wanna be a big man
Bring it on
Let's see what you got
The Monster, upon further reflection, throws his hands up in an "aw phooey" gesture and continues walking away
(') That's what  thought
(to Cassius) Could you concentrate for five seconds
am concentrating
Where can we rule
What do you think about
Earth
Cassius seems to think this isn't a bad idea
(') We could create our own hell there
You saying we go up there and kill everyone
Eventually, Cassius
But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them
their damned souls will be ours
It's our time, brother
The two look at each other
They start running toward the fire wall
Knocking souls out of their way
Hey, what are you doing
They get closer to the fire
(') You can't go through there
The fire flows in, not out
They dive through the fire wall
It
(') You know something
You guys suck
You really suck
Sirens go off
Dogs start barking
Lights flash
And we hear the sound of   hitting the back of the firewall hard
- Dad and Nicky are listening to one of Nicky's metal mix tapes
We hear the end of Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb
" Pause
Dad exhales
Now that was an experience
"You are only coming through in waves
"  That line blows my mind every time
Definitely
don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song
When it's over, that mood has been altered
Wow
Great shit
What's next
Well,  thought that after messing with your head, 'd give you a little kick in the keester
Hits the tape player
"Enter Sandman" blasts
Who is this, Metal-lick-a
Metallica, Dad
Come on
was just playing with you
Dad and Nicky dance to the song
- 'm sorry
After careful consideration, regretfully have to decline
'  :
'mon, man, 'm just asking for one Superbowl ring
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul
You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr
Marino
You did it for Namath
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways
Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that
This is bullshit, man
(gets up to leave) 'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you
Now you're talking
Dan exits
You're a good devil, Dad
And  also happen to be a Jets fan
Nicky and Dad share a laugh which is interrupted by faint sirens
The Gatekeeper enters in a hurry and falls to his knees
Your highness, Cassius and Adrian have escaped from hell
They went through the fire, and they broke it
think they took the New York tunnel
tried to stop them, but they overpowered me, sir
Oh, boy
Oh boy
Calm down
Get off your knees
The Gatekeeper stands up
Thanks for being so understanding, your worship
You're the man
You've always been the man
Dad's    as the Gatekeeper stands up
Two huge boobs grow out of either side of the Gatekeeper's head
We only see them from the front for a second
From behind the gatekeeper, we see the boobs but not the nipples as he talks to Nicky
(') (to Nicky) 'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right
Coulda been much worse
That's what 'm thinkin'
Dad is staring off
He looks shaken
This is bad, Nicky
How bad
'm gonna die, Nicky
If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means 'll start to deteriorate into nothing
enters
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises
Everything's fine, pop
Last time you said that the renaissance happened
Please, pop, just go back to your room
(regarding gateskeeper) Can  take him with me and have sex with his head
Sure, pop
Whatever you want
The gatekeeper walks towards Lucifer
Oh, this is gonna be a whole new lifestyle for me, isn't it
- We see the coals are cooling down on the road and the in hell are sneaking off
The  are baffled and don't quite know what to do
Dad, Jimmy and Nicky walk to the frozen fire
(
) What's going on
Where are we
We keep  people hit behind the frozen fire with loud thuds
Nothing's getting through that
The fire is solid as a rock
We gotta get this bad boy burning again
Ideas
To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way
So go get 'em, Dad
'm too weak
The process has already begun
Dad holds up his hand
His pink is hanging by a thread
We see the bigfoot  grunt disgusted by the sight
So go get 'em, Jimmy
'm just a demon, Nicky
don't got devil blood in me
'd last two minutes up there with your brothers
You're not saying it's up to me
The  puts his hands over his eyes shaking his head as if to say, "oh no
" (') 've never been to Earth
've never even slept over at some other dude's house
You're the spawn of Satan
You got it in you
Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here
Are you telling me  have to go to Earth and kill my brothers
Not go
They left together at the exact same time
They gotta come back together at the exact same time
Dad takes an ornate flask from his robe
Here
Get them drunk from this
One sip and they'll be trapped inside
Once you've got both of them, you bring the flask back through the gate
Dad's pinky is hanging
Jimmy pulls it off and examines it
The Monster gags
Your ol' man's got less than a week
Nicky looks petrified
No
This can't be happening
Son, just do your best
Nicky looks teary eyed
The moment is broken by the Monster, who runs in and pushes Nicky through the fire
Nicky goes through the solid fire wall
The Monster taps his own wrist and looks at Dad as if to say, "gotta get a move on
" - : 42ND to the darkened bowels of the old station, between two tracks, to a putrid puddle
Nicky breaks through the surface, sputtering
We hear a rumbling in the near distance
Okay
Earth
The Blue Marble
This doesn't look too bad
Nicky sees a fast approaching light, furrows his brow and - Nicky comes shooting through the solid fire wall and lands in the coal pit
His Dad limps back to him
You were gone ten seconds
What happened
got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal
That's a train, son
Don't stand in front of them
Well,  guess 'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one
Please, Nicky, get back up there
(his ear falls off) Try to hurry
Nicky climbs up and heads back toward the fire wall
- Nicky makes it back through the hole
Looks both ways and hops out of the hole
He carefully crosses the tracks and is stopped by the sight of a bulldog, , on the other side
In his mouth is one of those signs car service drivers use to identify their passengers at the airport
On the sign is scrawled "
" Nicky and Beefy stare at each other a beat
'm Nicky
Beefy drops the sign from his mouth
(voice of Sandy Wernick) Hey, terrific
Now get off the track and come with me, shitstains
-  - The throng of commuters making their way through the terminal are giving a wide berth to the filthy man who's looking around suspiciously, talking to the dog
My name's Beefy
'm an old friend of your father's
He's asked me to help you out
just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy
It's not gonna be easy
Your brothers can possess people
So they probably won't look like themselves
You have to be suspicious of everyone
Nicky looks at Beefy warily for a beat
Okay, "bro," this jig is up
(pulling out the flask) Just get in the bottle
Just slide right on in there
It's not me, moron
Oh
Sorry
- rants outside the entrance
People put money in his pot
Oh how the Lord loves you
All his children
(passerby puts in money) He thanks you for your kindness
(another woman puts in money) God bless, Ma'am
The Lord loves you
The Lord loves you
We see Nicky and Beefy walk up from behind
The sniffs
(') The Lord does not love you sense
pure evil
(thrusts his cross in Nicky's face) You make the Lord very nervous
(feeling hot) 'm burning
ahhh
(running away) The Devil walks among us
He runs off screaming, wildly bumping into people
(') Oh Lord, save us from Hell's beast
He gets off course and runs right into a subway entrance
He disappears
Beefy turns to Nicky
Makin' friends already
(shivering a little) It's freezing up here, Beefy
You're on Earth now, kid
Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has
We'll stop by -mart
Get you some warm clothes
also have this odd pain in my mid section
Kind of a hollow feeling
That pain is hunger
- -mart bag is next to a bench
to see Nicky wearing an extra warm
Sitting next to him on the bench is Beefy
Between them is a big bucket of ' Nicky takes out a drumstick
So far, so good
Now what
Put it in your mouth
Nicky puts it in his mouth
Holds it there
(') Move your teeth up and down
Nicky does
He chews for a long time
(') Now you gotta swallow it
Tilt your head back and let the meat slide down your throat-hole
Nicky does
He gets a looks of complete joy on his face
Hey
Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'
It sure is
Now eat it up
You're gonna need your energy
got energy up the ying-ying
Let's get cracking
stands with a drumstick and jogs off the curb right into the path of a moving bus
- The Monster is rubbing the gatekeeper's boobs
The gatekeeper is wearing a modified bra
He seems to be enjoying it
We hear a
They look down to see Nicky on the ground
(We didn't see him flying through this time
) The Monster and Gatekeeper immediately stop
Kind of embarrassed
Hey
That's a pretty brassiere
Thanks
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this
You got it
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this
You got it
Nicky turns and walks toward the firewall
As soon as his back is turned, the monster pantomimes to the Gatekeeper, " love your boobs
"  The Gatekeeper gives a flirtatious laugh (we don't see him morph back through the wall here
)
- Beefy is walking with him down the street
Nicky is crazy cautious
From now on
'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects
Great
Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side
But  misplaced it
: - Beefy is sitting on a bench/booth at a strip club
Champagne is on the table
Bills in his mouth
We see dancing for him
: Nicky and Beefy
So  found this other joint for you
But you're gonna have a roommate
- scruffy, thirtyish buy,  (Allen Covert), is on the phone in his small, bohemian apartment in the Village
(on phone) know exactly how you feel
The night Reagan was elected,  said to my mother, "Is this man going to blow up the world, Mommy
"  Then we both cried for like an hour
(knock at the door) Somebody's here
Call you later
Todd gets up and opens the door
It's Nicky, with Beefy by his side
Nicky is nervous, and his speech sounds practiced
Hello, friend, my name is Nicky understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice
Would it be possible for me to fill the slot
Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is
Nicky looks down at Beefy
Beefy looks up at Nicky
Both nod imperceptibly
Yes
What is rent
Eight-hundred, split down the middle
Tuesdays and Thursdays  rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits
Off limits
Right
And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40
Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy
(looks at Nicky) Aren't you boiling in that outfit
No
It's like eighty degrees in this hallway
You from the South
Yeah
The deep South
Nicky laughs a little too hard
Why is that funny
don't know
And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed
Todd turns and goes into the apartment
You'll be alright
Go on
Big day tomorrow
Don't forget to do that sleep thing  told you about
Got ya
(to Todd) Is it okay if  do the sleep thing
Yeah, your bedroom is right over there
The door closes
Beefy looks down at the welcome mat
It reads:  "heart"
Beefy raises his leg over it
' Nicky is sleeping on top of the hissing radiator, fully clothed
When he inhales through his nose, we hear that familiar snoring/snorting sound
But when he exhales, we hear disturbing "speaking-in-tongues", Exorcist-style voices
across the room to the doorway where Todd stands, looking concerned
- We  the bells toll
We see the beautiful exterior of a large church
an , kind looking
He ascends the steps to the pulpit and looks out on his large congregation
We see that  cameras are covering the  service
He gins his homily
In today's gospel, the Lord tells us who we are to live if we wish to attain the splendor of Heaven
or something like that
Jesus sure says a lot of stuff in the Bible
Moses this
Moses that
Abraham hit me with a whiffle ball bat
The crowd stares dumbfounded
We see that the Cardinal is standing on a steaming hot pizza which is still in the box with the top open
(') Yep, the Lord sure did say a bunch of hibbity-jibbity
But has he ever really done anything for us
Has he ever put a Jaguar  in my driveway
Has he ever given any of my enemies the herpes
No
He hasn't done a damn thing for any of us
-  stands up
- The Lord gave my son the strength to get off drugs
Ma'am,  know your son, and believe me, he was better off on drugs
He's a bore
At least when he was smoking hashish, he made me laugh occasionally
and his   stand up
After we tried for many years, the Lord finally helped my wife conceive a baby
No, your best friend Fitzie helped your wife conceive a baby
He helped her conceive it all night long
Fitzie, who's sitting on the other side of the Wife, starts to "raise the roof
"  Then thinks better of it
The Cardinal points to a well-dressed man in the front pew
(') How about you, Mr
Mayor
The Lord ever do anything for you
The Mayor has tinfoil on his feet
(standing) Well,  wish  could think of something, Cardinal, but to be honest with you, can't
Kind of makes you wonder if there even is a Lord
If there is any ultimate punishment for our so-called "sins
"  Maybe we should all just have fun and do whatever the hell we want
hubbub is raised by the crowd
Fitzie raises the roof again, this time energetically
Amen to that
Let the sin begin
The hubbub grows to a roar
Several  start fighting over the money in the collection plate
The Cardinal smiles knowingly at the Mayor
We hear the Cardinal's thoughts - in Adrian's voice
(
) Oh, this is delicious
He's smirking
his telepathic response
(
) (laughing) "Let the sin begins" - that was a good one
(
) Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell
How are things going down at City Hall
(
) lowered the drinking age to ten
(
) Brilliant
This is so much fun never want it to end
(
) Why should it end
Who's gonna stop us
The Mayor/Cassius laughs
As he does, his eyes slowly cross
- Beefy is taking a dump on the sidewalk
: Nicky, his pants around his ankles
He's trying to do the same
This is intense
And it happens every day
Sometimes twice
gotta tip my hat to you people
Look, it's okay for me to shit the street
But you gotta use a toilet
(pulling up pants) Okay, just point me in the right direction next time
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking
Well, let's rock and roll
Nicky looks at the next person walking by
It's a on a bicycle
Nicky clotheslines him, taking him off the bike in a sleeperhold/headlock
(') Get in the bottle
Dad's falling apart
You froze the gate and you're killing him
Drink
Nicky puts the flask to the Chinese Guy's lips
'm not thirsty
'm not thirsty
just get in the flask
The Chinese Guy breaks loose, gives Nicky a roundhouse kick to the head and runs away
Nicky gets up
(') Adrian and Cassius
You think a kick to the head is gonna make me throw in the towel
Well, in the immortal words of Judas Priest, "You got another thing comin'
" Beefy shakes his dog head and sighs as we see Nicky hold the bottle up to a few more
- Nicky approaches various people as they pass
(To be shot long lense, real people, real reactions
) ' - Nicky gets to the front of the line and tries to get the Cashier to drink
The Cashier yanks his head away and gives Nicky a dirty look
Nicky shrugs and points to the menu, ordering some chicken
- nicky walks up to a homeless man
He thrusts the bottle in his face
To Nicky's surprise, the homeless man gladly takes it and drinks
Nothing happens
Nicky is baffled
He tries to take the flask back, but the man won't let go
Finally he grabs it away from him
The man starts throwing garbage at Nicky as he walks away
- Beefy is looking around for Nicky
He spots him - inside the polar bear cage
Nicky approaches the bear holding the flask
- Nicky shoots through the firewall, having been killed again
The Gatekeeper is wearing tassels on his boobs
Bus
Beast
The Monster laughs
(to Monster) You like that
You think that's funny
The Gatekeeper swirls his tassels
(') How about that
You like that
The Monster howls with delight
- Nicky sits on the rocks, beaten and exhausted, eating a Popeye's drumstick
All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early
think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects
Now 'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown
Beefy hears Nicky's strange terrible snores
He's asleep
Beefy sighs
(') Kid's got a lot of evil in him, just begging to come out
Beefy walks away
- Nicky snores
Masses of birds fly out of the trees
Nicky snores
Squirrels run out of trees
Nicky snores
Staring at Nicky who continues to snore
Two - ,   , are listening to Danzig and doing a goofy dance
They hear something and turn the music down: it's the distant sound of Nicky's snore
Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time
'Bout time
Nicky snores
It sounds like " will eat your hearts
"  The worried people run away
Nicky snores
Children on the Carousel, going real fast, upset
Nicky snores
Peter and John walk over to a position near Nicky's bench
(') There's our man
Mr
Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side
sleazy   shuffles over towards Nicky
He eyes the flask which is half hanging out of Nicky's pocket
What's with that guy
Gotta be one of his disciples or something
Suddenly, the Vendor grabs the flask (and Nicky's half-eaten drumstick) and runs off
Yo, man,  think that devil guy just got ripped off
Should we wake him up
Yeah
You do it
Peter gets up and shakes Nicky who comes to with a loud Rise and shine, devil guy
Some dude just stole your shit
Nicky feels for the flask
It's gone
Oh nooooo
Fire shoots out of Nicky's mouth
(') Which way did he go
That way
Nicky is about to run off
Looks at John's shirt
Iron Maiden live double disc is simply phenomenal
He runs off
Did you check out the dragon mouth
The Dark Prince is here
- Nicky is searching the street for his flask
He walks past several   who have set up their wares on the sidewalk
Nicky comes walking back into frame as he sees his flask (and half-eaten drumstick) laying on the blanket of the
Hey
See something you like, my man
Yes
would like my flask back
The street vendor stands, very angry
You callin' me a thief, my man
No, 'm just calling you
a guy who has my flask
And if that is your so-called "flask," how would  have it unless  was, in fact, a thief
(not sure what the answer is) don't know
is checking out the flask
Yeah, how much for the silver flask there
Well, that's a very special item
The cap itself is one hundred percent plappium
It's a value is over three thousand dollars
Really
Where's it from
It was handcrafted in hell by Satan himself and is only to be used for the capture and containment of my blood brothers so that the firefall of Hades will burn brightly once again
Really
think we'll let you keep it then
He walks away
Okay, now you gone and done it
You done messed with my business bitch
Sir,  would prefer if you didn't raise your voice
It's making my muscles tighten
We see that Nicky's eyes are starting to glow red
Oh, you gonna go all crazy eyes on me
'll show you some crazy eyes
Let's get busy
The vendor makes an even crazier face at Nicky and starts swinging his fists around
Nearby, , an unsure, sweetly unstylish young woman, is selling clothes off a spread out blanket
She notices what's going on
Nicky's eyes widen in panic
Just then, Valerie steps in
Excuse me, does that flask belong to this man
(frustrated) Now you callin' me a thief
Damn
Look,  know you come out here and sell stolen stuff all the time
But today, the guy you stole from just happened to walk by and bust you
So why don't you admit today's not your day and give him his flask back
Or what're you gonna do about it
Ugly me to death
No, but maybe that cop over there might have something to say
Valerie points to a cop across the street
The Street Vendor ponders this for a second, then
Aw, take your dumb-ass canteen, goofy
(looking at Valerie) And you, take your raggedy-ass clothes and find a new corner
Before  show you what real crazy is
The vendor does crazy eyes again
Fine
will
Nicky picks up the flask and the drumstick
Hey, mister
'll be seeing you in a few years
Valerie gathers her blanket, starts walking away and Nicky follows her
(') That was amazing
Thanks so much
You didn't have to do that
That's okay
get messed with all the time and when  saw him doing that to you  just lost it
hate when people take advantage of tourists
It ruins it for the rest of us
You think 'm a tourist
'm sorry
just assumed
Your accent maybe
Where are you from
The South
Really
Yeah
Deep south
(laughs hard) She laughs along with him, not sure why
Why are you laughing
don't know, but  like it
Say
Your glasses are nice
They make your eyes look sparkly and big
It's fun to look at them
My dad's an optometrist
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart
'm sorry
It's really tough when your parents get older
If  don't save him,  don't know what 'm gonna do
Well, 'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out
Nicky is experiencing new sensations as he looks at her
He hands her the half-eaten drumstick
Here, have a Popeye's
This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'
That's alright
already ate lunch actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati
Could  come with you to getting a Gelati
If you want to
Want to
million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back
"Octopus people
" Uh, it's a deep south expression
Nicky laughs
- They exit the ice cream store, eating Gelati
It's freezing my hands
It's not that cold
Here, let me wrap it
Valerie takes a few napkins and wraps it for Nicky
Just then the  walks by
He quickly turns his head, sensing Nicky
Why do you taunt me with your darkness
Your evil is stinking up our streets
We're all gonna die
He takes off running right into a lamp post
This town is really going to hell lately
(Nicky nods) So what part of the city do you live in
have an apartment
don't remember exactly where
My dog knows, though
(laughs) You have a dog
What kind
'm not sure
'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts
- Beefy is screwing a female dog from behind
Remember, it's not the size of the boat, it's the motion of the ocean
Just finish
-  &   - 'd love to have a dog
But  go to school full time
It wouldn't be fair to the dog
School
Parsons School of Design
knew growing up  wasn't much to look at, so put my energy into making things that are pretty
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin
My perfume
He takes her wrist to his nose
He stares at it, licks it
(') (laughs) It's called "Comptoir Sud Pacific
" Which  think is the French word for coconuts
Nicky stops and looks at her
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach
Is that normal
Sometimes, sure
Good
was concerned
- The Gatekeeper is near the frozen fall
We hear loud wailing, moaning, etc
, coming from the other side
Doesn't sound very good behind there hope Nicky's kicking some ass on Earth
The Monster is smoking a cigarette and wearing a leather biker's hat
He nods along in agreement
Who's sitting over by a rock fishing in a small pool of fire/pond
You know,  was the one who created Hell
know, your wickedness
started slow, though
For years, was just giving people hot foots
Actually, you can give all the credit for Hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration
She was an ugly one, too
One day, she asked me if  wanted super sex
said 'll take the soup
The Monster laughs really hard
(') Take it easy there, Chewbacca
In fact, you look like her mother, except she had more hair
The Monster laughs even harder
(') You know what was in Hell when  came down here, Cassius
It's Stanley, sir
Nothing
No mountains
No castles
Looked like a giant parking lot
It wasn't even called Hell
What was it called, sir
Boogerland
That's nice, Grandpa
Why don't you just enjoy the fishing
can't enjoy anything
go fishing
catch nothing
go to orgies, catch everything
We hear the Monster laughing again as we   Grandpa's fishing line to: - We  a   squirming on the fish hook giant fanged fish engulfs the Peeper's body
Only his head is sticking out
deserve this
-    - Several  - stumble out, drunk
just stole twenty-five bucks off the bar
#2 How many beers did you have
# 3 Eight sips
had five
'm so wasted
They both high five, throw up and fall
over to sitting on top of a mailbox laughing as he sips from a bottle of
When an adult goes to Hell, that's terrific
But when a child goes
that's why 'm in this business
Adrian looks across the street and sees Nicky walking with Valerie
He's shocked
Valerie is holding up a pair of drawstring pants from her collection
So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store
Basically, yeah
Wow
Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles
Valerie laughs
You know what's nice about you
You just seem happy being yourself
You don't try to act cool
Thanks much
You know what's nice about you, Valerie
What
Up the street, Adrian's eyes redden
looks like he's been stunned by something
Your juicy, heart-shaped ass
What was that
(shocked and confused) don't know why  just said that
meant to say that
: Adrian's eyes flashing
(') 've always wanted to have sex with a gross pig
What do you say we go behind that dumpster, pull our pants down and see what happens
Valerie's very hurt
You're a jerk
She turns and walks away
Nicky looks over and sees Adrian
His inner voice speaks to him
(
) (
) You shouldn't have come here
(
) Please, get out of my mind
Adrian's eyes flash
(') Hey, Valerie
She stops and turns
Nicky  his fist to resist Adrian's force
It's too much
His middle finger comes up, giving her the "finger
" What the hell's your problem
She runs away crying
Nicky turns to Adrian who's still across the street
(
) Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell
Dad's sick
(
) He's sick
(
) Yeah, he needs souls to live
When you guys left, you broke the gates
We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies
Adrian processes this
(
) He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright
(
) Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him
(
) How about this
stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back
Nicky's body jerks around
(
) Adrian, please
Nicky, fighting control over his body, walks slowly and crazily into the middle of the street where he sees a large truck bearing down on him
and  get blood splattered on them
Peter looks down to see the "666" forms in blood on their clothes
Check this out
The number of the beast
They laugh and hi-five
- Dan Rather speaks to the camera
Over his shoulder we see a graphic of the Arch-Decon's face
(Arch-Decon is a made up religious figure that appeared earlier in the script
) Reverberations from Arch-Decon Donnelly's shocking speech are still being felt throughout the city
Today, some disgruntled cast members of the play  broke the fourth wall in a most hostile manner
few  are down in the aisle physically pushing around shocked audience members
But even that does not come close to what happened today on Live with Regis and Kathy Lee
The set of Regis and Kathy Lee
So  was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off
Oh, that's terrible, Reege
So  followed him
You followed him
followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car,  reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat
You keep a bat under your seat
Recently, yes
So  run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy
Did you ever see Yes, great movie
was DeNiro
The blue haired lady  is crying
The  turns off
We   to see that we are in
'  - Beefy turns to Nicky
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil
What can  do about it
You can't do jack shit
unless you learn your evil powers
Nobody's as evil as my brothers
Those dudes put the wick in wicked
Go get a soda out of the fridge
But those are my roommate's sodas
(high-pitched mocking) "But those are my roommate's sodas
" Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make
Nicky, ashamed, gets a Coke out of the fridge and places it on the coffee table
He and Beefy sit on the couch and stare at the Coke
(') You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid - engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss
You just have to release the evil within you
Release the evil
'm just saying, there's wickedness in you
can tell from your snores
Nicky stares at the can
(') Release your evil
Nicky frowns and bites his lip
The can rattles a little
What are you doing
Todd is standing in the doorway
Beefy runs to the fire escape
******************* (') know it's your living room night
But can  finish watching the Globetrotters' game out here
To me it's classic Comedia Dellarte
: '  - The  clicks on
We see  sit down and look at the
Nicky's behind him
- What an odd game, folks
The powerhouse 85-0 Harlem Globetrotters, who normal run circles around the 0-85 Nationals, seem to be struggling to find their groove in front of their hometown fans
Globetrotter makes a fancy pass to another player, who makes a fancy pass to  who starts doing some The  blows the whistle and makes the travelling signal
He's walking, get him a bus
Oh, another awful call
There is no way that was travelling
Ref takes ball from Cornrows, who gets in the Ref's face
What's with all these crazy calls
You gotta watch that shit, we haven't lost a game in 53 years
Technical foul
Ref snaps just like Cassius in the players' face
That guy in the striped shirt snaps his fingers like someone  know
The ref mind wrestles four globetrotters to simultaneously slam their heads on the scorers table again and again
(') It looks like the work of a brother
black guy
If it's Cassius, yes
Nicky races for the door
- As the ref taunts the crowd, a fan wearing a Globetrotter's shirt yells out
Get your head out your ass, ref
The kids came to see the Globetrotters win
Oh, so you wanna lip off to me
Unsportsmanlike conduct on the big mouth in the Globetrotter's shirt
Take ten points off for the Globetrotters
The Globetrotter's score on the board goes from 46 to 36
The  are crying
The halftime buzzer sounds
The Globetrotters walk off the court
The crowd
In all my years of basketball,  was never so happy to hear a halftime buzzer
Folk, 'm afraid if the second half doesn't get any better,  expect a full scale riot
spotlight points to an announcer at mid-court
It's time for the Globetrotter's halftime half-court heave throw, where one lucky fan will have a shot at ten thousand dollars
brick lands at the announcer's feet
(') And if he makes it, everyone in attendance today will receive a free pizza
- , wearing a big basketball jersey, looks nervous
He has a pass on
ain't goin' out there and taking the shot
These people have gone crazy
'll take the shot
- As Nicky runs out on the court, Peter turns to John
Look who's back from the dead
Six, six, six, pick up sticks
They high-five
The only happy fans in their section
'  - Todd's baffled, looking at his roommate on
Beefy is watching from the fire escape
What's Nicky doing down there
Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth
Todd looks over, suspicious
Did you just talk
No
- The court announcer covers his mic and whispers to Nicky
You better win these people some free pizza
Looks like they're about to start killing each other
pushes a very old   down an aisle of stairs
The court announcer hands Nicky the ball
He looks at it
Release the evil
His eyes get red
Staring at the ball, it explodes
(') Okay, too much evil
Bill Walton's hair is on fire
think that ball just blew up
And yes, my hair is aflame
(turning to sideline) Could  get another ball
The court announcer throws out another ball
Nicky stares at it again with red eyes
(') command you not to blow up and go into that metal circle
Nicky throws an underhand shot
The ball arcs through the air and is about to go in when the ref comes out of nowhere and swats it away
Get that crap outta here
The crowd
Nicky and the ref stare at each other
(
) know you're having fun, Cassius, but you gotta come back to Hell
(
) Look around you, Nicky
We're in Hell
The New Hell
We see , sitting between   , raising the roof
As the crowd , Nicky runs over and grabs the microphone
Listen up, New York
Your souls are in great danger
Nicky gets hit by a hot dog
(') Alright, how about this
get one more shot
The ref will cover me
miss it, the Globetrotters forfeit the game
make it, he doesn't ref the second half and we all start conducting ourselves like decent human beings again
The crowd is silent
(') And we get free pizza
The crowd roars
- Bill Walton's hair is now burnt looking
think it's safe to say we're all rooting for this bizarre and hideous looking man
Bill Walton reaches over to an old lady sitting near him
He takes off her wig, leaving behind her bald head, and puts her wig on his head in order to cover his burnt hair
The crowd starts
Nicky
Nicky
Nicky
John and Peter are yelling the loudest
The ref walks to half-court and hands Nicky the ball
You know, Dad got very sick when you left
heard
'm glad he's dying
It's my turn now
Nicky's eyes get red, he starts dribbling
'  - Beefy is watching, transfixed
Take him to the hole, Nicky
(Todd stares) mean, woof
Woof
Todd looks at Beefy, terrified
We see  and some other Globetrotters are coming back from the locker room
They stop to watch
-  - Nicky pushes the ball up the court while the ref plays extremely tight defense
Nicky fakes one way, then heads toward the basket
The ref stays tight
Nicky's eyes are redder than ever
He fakes left, he fakes right
He dribbles behind the back, dribbles between the legs, then takes his momentum up toward the basket
He jumps from the foul line and flies through the air
He emits a crazy, blood curdling, devil yell
: It reads: 666
Popcorn and sodas
Cornrow's cornrows  open into a
Nicky's head starts turning and does a 360 (like the Exorcist)
He ends his flight by slamming down a thunderous dunk, cracking the backboard's glass into pieces
He hits the ref on the way down
The crowd , finally happy again
Never doubt my skills
- Damn,  gotta learn how to do that
- Nicky sees the ref is lying on the basketball arena floor, covered in glass
He gets up slowly That's nuts
When'd you learn that shit
Sorry, Cassius
Maybe it was the super devil juice Dad gave me
thought might need it for just such an occasion
Super devil juice
Give it over
Let's go best two out of three
(pulls out the flask) No
No way
Dad said it was only for me
The ref rips the flask from Nicky and drinks
Cassius screams like bloody hell as he is sucked out of the ref's mouth and into the bottle
The ref slumps to the floor
Still quiet until John and Peter rush to Nicky and bow
Nicky peers into the flask
(
) Damn you, Nicky
There ain't no super devil juice in here
Nicky caps the flask
Nicky waves to the stunned, but appreciative crowd
'  - homemade cake is laid out
It reads: , , ,    are there
So your father's the devil, you're a talking dog sent from Hell, and you guys are who
Just a couple of big fans of Nicky and the work his Dad does
By the way, Nicky
Check this out
He spins his Black Sabbath backwards
(') What's Ozzy trying to say there
Absolutely nothing
The Blizzard always came straight with his messages
But wrap your minds around this one
Nicky gets up and we see his is sitting on a hibachi
He pus on a James Taylor album and plays it backwards
command you in the name of the Lucifer to spread the blood of the innocent
John and Peter look at each other, shocked
No wonder your uncle's so weird
gotta say this cake tastes a little funny
Oh,  dumped a fat sack of reefer in the mix
Tried to spice up the bash
Nicky takes a big bite of cake
What's reefer
: - from Popeye's laying everywhere
Everyone's laughing hard
Come on
One more time
Not again, fellas
It kind of hurts
Please
You got to
(resigned) All right
Nicky loosens up his neck and makes his head go around 360 degrees
Everyone cracks up, high fives
Even Todd
to Beefy, who has bloodshot eyes
used to get baked like this with my first girlfriend, Heather
We'd get so stoned she would forget  was a dog
She was human
Actually, she was a sewer rat
Man, that pissed my parents off
dated a Japanese girl once
My parents disapproved
Not cause she's Japanese, but cause she was only fifteen
'm only fifteen
thousand years old
Everyone cracks up
was in love one time but she said wasn't financially reliable enough
And she needed that
By she, do you mean he
No
Busted
(laughs) How you feelin' over there, Satan Abdul Jabar
little strange
can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie
Why
Did she hurt you
Do you miss her
Need a shoulder to cry on
Easy, Liberace
Oh, would you grow up
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass
Maybe you love her
But what do  know
'm baked out of my mind
Me, too
We're gonna get going
You guys want to stay
have a futon in my bedroom
That's a big pass, Elton John
We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now
Wanna come, Nicky
No thanks
'm afraid  wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then
Later on
See ya, fellas
They leave
(
) You better snap out of it soon, kid
Cause we're going after Adrian tomorrow
Seven
Nighty, night
He falls asleep and starts snoring
We hear the  of singing "Ring Around The Rosie" as he exhales
That is the most frightening thing have ever seen
Nicky stands and moves to the window
He looks out longingly over the sleeping city
achingly
behind him, we see Todd nodding encouragingly in the reflection
Todd
Which way to the Parson's School of Design
'    - Nicky walks around the corner
: "Parson's School -  Student Housing" Nicky is standing in front of the dorm rooms
He looks up
Scanning the windows, he picks up a scent
(he sniffs) Coconuts
Nicky goes to the fire escape and starts to climb
His nose leads him
He reaches the window, sniffing heavily
- is standing in the window draped in silks, feeling his nipples with his legs crossed like the guy in "Silence of the Lambs
"  The student is startled
Hello
You smell like coconuts
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific
"  Makes me feel like a hula girl
Which is kinda what 'm going for
Wanna come in
No thanks
'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts
Valerie Doran
Two floors up, one window over
Thanks, much
Good luck with the genital tucking
don't need luck
'm good
Nicky floats away
few seconds later, he floats back, holding up the flask
Adrian
Andrew
Nicky nods and floats off
'  - Nicky crouches outside her window and peers in
'  - Cool music
She is up late
Working by candlelight on a fantastic design
Something's not working
She drapes a beautiful fabric over another
She smiles at the combination
She is happy being creative
Nicky feels his heart swell as he watches her
He's so enraptured he leans forward trying to kiss her
His head bumps the window
She turns, startled
She sees the beaming Nicky
Hey
Nicky
Oh my -d
Stay right there
Pause
Valerie opens the window and sprays a can of mace right in Nicky's face
Oh that stings
My eyes are on fire
Nicky stands up and stumbles around
What were you thinking coming here
'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison
He bounces off the front rail, stumbles backward and goes flying over the back rail
'  - We see Nicky hurtling toward the street
Holding his eyes
Oh my -d, 'm so sorry
Suddenly he stops
Suspended above ground
Valerie doesn't hear the expected thud
(') Nicky
He floats up, but he can't see
Valerie
Are you dead
No
What are you doing
think 'm floating
Why would you be floating
don't know
Maybe it's because of your sweet voice
Am  supposed to not be freaked out right now
Because  am
He's floating up
He slows down
can't see you but  can smell you
And you make me feel alive in a way 've never felt before
he's floating outside the student's window
The student's dripping candle wax on his belly
You got the wrong window again, man
Oh
Sorry, Andrew
Valerie
Nicky resumes floating up
'm over here, Nicky
To the left
Nicky is parallel with her
He hovers in front of her, eyes still watering
She punches Nicky in the face, and he flies back ten feet
(') Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean 'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger
That wasn't me
was being possessed by my brother, Adrian
He's the one who call you a gross pig
What do you mean, "possessed
" Remember when  told you my Dad was in Hell
Yes
Well, that's because he's the Devil
And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years
Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad
"The Devil
"
to decompose
And  love my  Dad very much
So  came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and  met you and
well, my dog tells me  just might be in love with you
His vision is clearing and he can start to see her
She is totally in shock but still here
Okay, now  get that "deep south" joke
Nicky laughs
Valerie joins in
(') don't know if  should believe you
Nicky starts to drop
You gotta believe me
You gotta believe in the butterflies
Okay,  do
Get back up here
He floats up to her holding out his hand
Nervously, she takes his hand and suddenly she is lifting off and they are flying
-  - They fly past the
This is amazing
They soar past some more buildings
- The preacher sense something
He looks to the sky, then holds the cross from around his neck as high as he can
The hellbeast is above us
He's invading our skies
We're all gonna die
We're all gonna die
- He's kind of ruining the mood
Let me take care of that
- The preacher is still angrily shouting towards the sky
We're all gonna die
fire hydrant cap turns and comes off
powerful blast of water shoots out and hits the preacher,  him across the street into a plate glass window
- Can we go fly over Central Park
Next time
Tonight,  want to share the most beautiful thing  could possibly imagine
- They fly over it, away from
We're going to Jersey
East Rutherford
- They float high above the Meadowlands
There is an outdoor concert going on
We hear the Ozz on stage in his encore
He is singing "Mr
Crowley
"  Nicky turns to Valerie
never thought 'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead
(he looks at her) Please tell me you like metal
(sings along to song) "Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head
" Nicky's jaw drops as he stares at her
My dog was right
'm in love with you
They slow dance tighter
The music swells
John and Peter look up from their seats far below
Nicky sees them while he's holding her tight
They give thumbs up
: - Feeling great
Spring in his step, we see Nicky walking down the street
He stops and smells some flowers at a Korean Tommet
The point and seem agitated by him
Nicky gives them a friendly wave
(in Korean) Moo ya san jie bay
The Koreans just glare
Nicky's confused
: dissonant, nervous score accompanies the rest of the sequence
- leaves his cart and starts following
Nicky looks back a little, unnerved
screeches in front of him
The  gets out and goes after him
- group of school girls in uniform break loose from their teacher and start chasing Nicky
- gigantically fat guy sees Nicky run by
He thinks about going after him but decides not to and takes a big bite of a candy bar instead
- Ten guys playing wheelchair basketball see Nicky
They point and start wheeling after him
- Nicky is putting some distance between him and the mob
What's going on here
But when he heads downhill, the    start to catch up
They get closer and closer until
Nicky makes a last second right turn into an alley
The wheelchairs can't slow down and crash into a double decker tourist  at the bottom of the street
The  on the top level look over the edge to see the crash
- Nicky is panicking, out of breath
() rises up out of his cardboard box
The bum raises his bottle and thunks Nicky on the head
It doesn't break
Ow
what was that for
Fifty million dollars
The bum holds up a
It reads "
" And has a picture of Nicky
Nicky is shocked
Nicky turns to run out of the alley, but the mob is there blocking the entrance
He's trapped
They start running right at him
He closes his eyes
Release the evil
Nicky's body splits into about five-hundred horrifying insects, all with a miniature
The Nickysects run right at the crowd, and the crows immediately starts running the other way, completely freaked out
'  - Beefy and Todd are watching
They look over to see the insects scurry under the front door and morph back into one exhausted Nicky
seem to be in trouble, Beefy
The shit has hit the fan, kid
Take a look
Been breaking all morning
- We see Dan Rather addressing the camera
At a news conference earlier today, Chief of Police Andy Shaifer gave this beleaguered city its latest dose of bad news
He revealed that the man who caused a sensation at basketball arena last night is no hero
he is, in fact, a mass murderer
We see the chief of police behind a bunch of mics
He's holding up a picture of Nicky taken at the Basketball arena
'  - Nicky's outraged
didn't murder anybody Look
You were really high
Things happen
was with Valerie,  swear
This is Adrian's work
've got to find him
think you're looking at him
- We reveal that the chief is standing on a grilled-cheese press to keep him warm
(on ) This video shows what he did after he left the basketball arena yesterday
- Scarface shooting his -47
Nicky's face has been crudely superimposed over his
(Adrian's voice) My name's Nicky, and 'm gonna kill all you suckers for no reason
on "" - The Chief shakes his head
Difficult to watch,  know
In response to this vicious crime,  am authorizing the largest reward in law enforcement history: fifty million dollars to the person or persons who bring this man to me
'  - Nicky stands outraged
This is baloney
He superimposed your head onto "Scarface
" which is by far DePalma's best work
The pounding increases
'm not Nicky
'm not home
don't live here
Dude, it's us
Let us in
Nicky opens the door
Peter and John stumble in
There's like a total mob scene coming this way
We hear  of an approaching crowd coming outside
thought for sure  gave 'em the slip
Todd i s looking out the window
Looks like they're following a giant trail of bug shit
What'll we do now, Beefy
don't know, this is a little out of my league
(
) Come on
Let's get 'em
What would your dad do, Nicky
Good idea
kill me
Dude
Seriously
Yes
'll meet you at Grand Central at noon
Okay
Do me
command you
(psyched) Alright
John takes Nicky's head and slams it hard into the kitchen counter
Nicky is dazed
That just hurt a lot
've always wanted to kill someone
Can do it
Look at Queen Latifah steppin' up
- Nicky is in the bathtub being angrily drowned by Todd
John and Peter watch happily
Die, Grandma, die
Nicky's arm comes out with a thumbs up
Pause
The hand drops back in
He's dead
- Start on a   of Lucifer
He's holding cards, looking at his hand
Royal flush, you lose
Off with the bra
The Demons and Gatekeeper are sitting around playing strip poker
The Gatekeeper takes off his bra
From behind, we see his breasts flop out
(') Last time  saw a pair of jugs that big, two hillbillies were blowing on them
The Gatekeeper throws his hand down and storms out
The Monster laughs uproariously
Nicky enters and moves to what's left of his dad
Arms, torso, and a head (with one ear)
Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me
He's always a step ahead
What am gonna do
What are you gonna do
Look at me, Nicky
got no legs,  got no hips, got one ear
Dad's remaining ear falls out
(') got no ears
can't hear
Now he's got no ears
You happy, Nicky
Your father's got no ears
Uh, 'll do my best, Dad
Do you have any advice at all for me
can't hear you, Nicky
can't hear anything
Jimmy picks up the ear
Jimmy speaks into it
Check one-two
Check one-two
Put it back on my head
'm falling apart here
He's got 'til midnight tonight, Nicky
(putting ear back on Dad) You get your ass back up there
You save your father
Nicky looks very upset
- We see John and Peter enter frame
Looking very nervous
You sure you're down with this
Little nervous
Wanna puke
They approach the cops guarding the door
(') Looking for the chief
We know where to find Nicky
grab John & Peter and drag them inside
'  - Surrounded by prostitutes and criminals in a very hot room, the chief of police puts down his bottle of , stands up and looks at the two idiots
You have what  want
Sure do
You got what we want
Fifty million bones, bro
He nods to a  who gives them a briefcase of money
That's half of it
You get the rest when  get Nicky
Excellent
But  gotta warn you, man
He's not human
Really
We think he's the son of Satan
The chief , then everyone else does
He walks over and picks them up by their throats
Well, then  guess 'll have to be extra careful
Now where is he
- We see the   on the wall
minutes til
We see  and  (with the briefcase) walking into with the chief and twenty-five  cops
The chief bumps into a filthy bag lady drinking out of paper sack
Hey, watch it
Who do you think you are
(never stopping) Emperor of the New Hell
They march through onto the platform for Track 33
- We see Beefy and Todd waiting by the place where Nicky usually comes up
It is hot down there
Steam and smoke comes out of the tunnels
Todd is nervous
Where is he
He's late
He'll be here
Just keep your cool, kid
They hear
They turn and see the chief of police backed up by the huge police force
(') We've been ratted out
Beefy and Todd turn to see John and Peter looking sheepish
You guys
That was so uncool
We thought the son of Satan would understand a move like this
Peter and John high-five
Okay, take these two outside
can handle this
The police grab Todd and put a leash on Beefy
The cops lead their prisoners away down the tunnel, leaving John and Peter alone with the chief
(') Wanna see something cool
The chief inserts a finger into his nostril
Then he fits his hand up there
Soon his whole arm is up his nostril as he searches for something
John and Peter are impressed
The chief grabs something and starts to pull
Then out of his nose comes Adrian, who fully forms as the shell of the chief's body slumps to the ground
Ta-da
So what time is my brother expected back
Noon
They look at the clock
It's noon
(') ish
Peter is sweating, kinda nervous
So even though you're not really the chief, we still get the rest of the cash, right bro
You know what you'll get
An indescribably horrific torture administered by demons for the rest of eternity
But what about the cash
Can we keep it or what
Sure, why not
They high five
Adrian smiles and waits
It is real hot down there
We hear a train coming in the distance
fan circles slowly
They all wait for him
(mumbling to herself) Food stamps
They should call 'em "dude stamps
" Cause ever time  get one, some dude takes it away
We see the   down the platform stumbling her way towards them, drunk
Adrian scowls at her
(') Hey, studs
'll let you make out with me for a dollar
No thanks
but we'll take that bottle of booze
(grabs the bottle, laughs) Hey
that's mine
Peter pushes her away
Beat it, ya freak
John and Peter high five and John swigs from the bag
Schnapps
(takes the bag, swigs) Peppermint
alright
Adrian raises his eyebrows
We see that the homeless lady is actually  in disguise
She looks back, tense
John offers Adrian the flask
Wanna hit
Hands it to him
He takes it
Drink up
Here's to fifty million clams
To the defilement of Earth and the corruption of its people
Whatever
Knock it back, grab Nicky and let's get outta this hell-hole
Adrian smiles at John, then raises the bag
He stops just before it hits his lips
He looks at John curiously
It is awfully hot down here
How do you manage to stay so cool
Weed lowers the body temperature
(stuttering) read that
in, uh
er, science magazine
Adrian stares at John
He raises the bag again
This liquid will probably quench my thirst
Cool me off
Definitely
And give you a good buzz
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity
Uh
No it won't
John starts to tremble a bit
Oh, Nicky, 've missed you
Come on out and say hello
Urr
uggg
errr
(eyes getting red) 'm calling you out, brother
Adrian is mentally pulling Nicky out of John
Nicky/John wages an epic battle with himself as Adrian smiles
/ Urrr
uggh
(as Nicky) Oww
Adrian, this is very painful
Nicky comes flying out
John's body slumps to the floor next to the chief's
Adrian looks in the "Schnapps bottle" to see the flask wrapped in paper
He peeks inside
Hello, Cassius
(
) All right
Let me out
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan
(
) You mother
Adrian hands Nicky the flask
But Cassius could use some company for the rest of eternity
So get in the flask
He puts the Flask in Nicky's hands
-  - The police are escorting Beefy and Todd through the terminal
Beefy starts whining and stops
The cops look down
Beefy raises his leg
Oh, he's gotta pee
thick, yellow smoke shoots out of Beefy, enveloping the group
Beefy escapes and bolts back down stairs
Run, Beefy
Run
- Adrian stares down Nicky
won't drink
You can't make me
Adrian looks over at Valerie
Suddenly she comes flying over to him
He grabs her by the throat
We hear a train coming in the distance
Of course  can
Drink or she dies
(Nicky is scared) Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going
Let her go
hear a train coming
Drink
The train sound is coming
Valerie looks at Nicky
Nicky raises the flash to drink
Don't do it
have to, Valerie
We see Beefy skid to a stop, raise his leg and a full size archery arrow shoots out of his penis and tracks right into '
Ahhh
Now that hurt the both of us
Valerie is able to escape momentarily
Adrian reaches for her, grabbing her
They both spin and fall down onto the tracks
Right into the oncoming train
Valerie
Nicky leaps down onto the tracks, wrestles Valerie away from Adrian and tosses her off the tracks
Adrian looks at Nicky
See you in Hell
The train comes by, hitting both Adrian and Nicky
- Adrian comes flying through the solid firefall into Hell
He looks around
Confused, there's no Nicky
: - Nicky is lying in a huge field of tall, very green grass
He sits up, and feels his face to make sure it's all there
Nicky looks around, alarmed
He seems to be in a mountain vale, maybe in the foothills of the Alps
It's gorgeous
Off in the distance, floating in the air, is a giant birthday cake
Nicky stands up and the cottage seems to be floating down to him
- The cake lands softly in front of him, the door ajar
After a moment's hesitation, Nicky goes in
- Nicky enters the cake to find  and two friends: and
They are doing arts and crafts sort of things on a glass table in front of them
They stare at him
Angel rises
Oh
My
-d
can't believe you're here
Welcome
Can  just tell you, am so excited right now
So excited
She really is
That's terrific
Now could you ladies point me to the Black Palace
should check in with my dad
Nicky trails off as he sees the Angels laughing at him
'm sorry, you're just so cute
Do you have any idea where you are right now
The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades,
double toothpicks
Maybe try the opposite of that
The Angel and two friends laugh and high-five
Nicky's confused
(') Okay, can  just ask you something
What do you know about your mom
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat
Which would explain my chronic halitosis
(annoyed) mountain goat
That's really sweet
My mom wasn't a goat
Try an angel
An angel
Unh-huh
Which would make you half angel
Nicky is floored
Wow
What
what did she look like
Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair
The  start laughing
(') 'm sorry, 'm totally busting on you
'm your mom
Nicky is even more floored
Jenna has taken a picture of Nicky
'm sorry, but you just had the sweetest look on your face
You're gonna be so happy she did that
(stunned) How come you're not older
Angels don't get any older, son
can't believe you just called him "son
" Oh my -d
This is so wild
They laugh
Nicky is quite baffled
- Dad is just a pair of lips, with ears on either side held up by two forearms with hands attached, lying on the throne
Gatekeeper, Lucifer, Jimmy and a few other demons stand around
can't see shit
You're all still here, right
Adrian enters
They all cheer
Adrian's here
You'll be back to normal in a jiffy, sir
Yea
can't believe little Nicky came through
Where's Nicky
He came with you and Cassius, right
came through that gate alone
Sorry, sir, false alarm
Boooo
Somebody explain what's going on
Puts the Gatekeeper in a headlock
You'll get nothing out of me
Perhaps a titty twister will loosen your lips
He twists a breast
The Gatekeeper babbles out the information immediately
The only way to save your dad is for you and your brothers to pass through the gates at the same time before he deteriorates completely
How much time does Dad have before that happens
Adrian twists hard
Thirty minutes
And then whoever claims his throne will have unimaginable power
Adrian throws him down
All boobs and no balls
Thirty minutes
Hmmm
hope you don't mind if  take a seat while  wait for you
He moves to the throne and throws the lips off
Ahhh
He pushes Lucifer out of the way
don't get no respect
Ten thousand years
And  never once got to sit here
He sits on the throne and it starts to shake a little
He grins as two horns grow out of his forehead
(') Wow
And this is just a little taste of my power
Hell's gonna bust wide open
Demons, get him out of the chair
The demons approach
Ah-ah
Not so fast, demons
There are a couple of million evil souls on Earth ready to be harvested
Anyone interested
The demons stop
Now loyal to Adrian
All except Jimmy
- Everyone is sitting around drinking Diet Cokes
Are you Adrian and Cassius' mom, too
No, their mother's weren't angels
think they were hookers or strippers or something really porno like
There's a knock on the door
It opens and in comes Carl Weathers dressed as Chubbs from Happy Gilmore
Holly, Jenna, Christa
Time for your Mambo lesson
Oh, Chubbs
totally spaced
'm so sorry
have company
It's my son, Nicky
My son
Can you believe it
Wow, that's terrific
Nicky, this is Chubbs
He used to be a golf pro, but up here he's the dopest dance instructor
You mambo
don't think so
Remember, it's all in the hips
It's all in the hips
Chubbs dances as he leaves
Where did you meet my father
It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer
remember that night, you had like four daiquiris
Try four and a half
At first  totally didn't like him
He was really conceited
But  don't know, he was funny, he made me laugh, and  hate to say it but he had a really nice body
And that made you want to make a baby with him
The Angels laugh
Well,  really wasn't thinking about making a baby at the time
Her cell-phone rings
She answers it
(') Hello
yes, he's here with me now don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv
'll call you back
(laughs) Oh my -d,  will call you back, goodbye
(hangs up) That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi
" Well tell her  said "hi" back
Angel makes a motion towards the phone, then stops
'll call her later
You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life
That was so cool
That's why you came up to Heaven instead of Hell
Self-sacrifice automatically gets you here
How did you see me
We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth
Look
Angel and the girls clear the junk from the glass table in front of them
Angel touches the glass and it turns into a reflection of Earth below
'  - People are rioting in the streets
Looting appliance stores
(
) All these good people have totally been led astray
(
) Show him Central Park
- People are drinking and smoking and burning things
large circle has formed around two old ladies who are fist fighting
One old lady knocks the other to the ground, then jumps on her and starts wailing away
The spectators exchange money
(
) There's like a three day rave goin' on down there
No on is going to work anymore
Then suddenly we see the ground start to break up and Adrian on his throne start to be thrust upwards
Demons swarm around him
Welcome to the party
It's so nice to see all of you here
(
) Hey, that's Dad's throne
How did Adrian get that
Is Dad okay
(
) Let's see
: - are morosely talking to the Gatekeeper and Jimmy
was a good Devil, wasn't
You were the best Devil, boss, the best Devil
Absolutely
tried to do some interesting stuff
You did amazing stuff
don't know how you came up with some of it
Really
That means a lot to me
(
) Oh my -d
He looks gross
(
) can't believe  did it with him
She touches the pool again and the reflection changes to: - Adrian steps off his throne onto a small stage flanked by He begins addressing the crowd
'm very proud of you
You've taken to sin with minimal prompting
The crowd cheers
(') You're acting as if there is no Heaven or Hell
The crowd cheers
- We see John, Peter, Beefy, Valerie and Todd hanging on flagpoles by their underwear
Beefy is in a special fitted harness that looks like underwear
Well,  have some news
Adrian morphs into the Cardinal from earlier
There is most definitely a Hell
And you're all going there when you die
Which will happen in about fifteen minutes
- The   realize they've been tricked into being bad and they get scared
The Preacher, who is now more battered from his fall through the plate glass window (ask Steve), yells out
We really are gonna die
This kicks off a frenzy of the Scared Bad People trying to run away
But they are stopped and herded back by
- This don't look good
Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this
They castrated him
He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke
can't screw
(whimpers) can't screw
Valerie's crying
- Nicky is shocked
Valerie's crying
She's so nice
She goes to Parson's, right
would totally love to go there
But hear it's really hard to get in
gotta help her
gotta help Dad gotta help everybody
Yeah, you do
- Adrian is looking at a clock tower that reads 11:45
(
) At the stroke of midnight, my father will be completely deteriorated
And all of your souls will be mine
- Soon you will see things more horrible than you can even imagine
Adrian scans the crowd
He sees
- The Parsons  in the kimono dancing sexily
Adrian is thrown
- Not that horrible, but still pretty bad
Adrian motions to some of his guards
They nod
(') So while we wait, for your enjoyment, bring you a dear sweet man and an international icon
Henry Winkler
frightened   is lead onto the stage prodded by two
- The scared bad people finally smile
- Covered in bees
We see Henry Winkler is suddenly covered head to in a swarm of bees
- The crowd gasps
- Nicky is starting to panic
But how can  win
Adrian is stronger and smarter than me
Stronger, yes
Smarter, definitely
But you have something he doesn't have
speech impediment
The girls laugh
No, you have the inner light
You can totally use it
It's the best power of all
(he smiles) And in case you get in real bad trouble, -d told me to give you this
She gives him an ornate, jewelled ball
What is it
'm not a hundred percent on that
-d said when the time comes, you'll know what to do
-d's so smart
The smartest
Well, goodbye
for now
(looks at his face) Can  just do this
She licks her finger and wipes some dirt off his forehead
(') That was such a Mom thing, wasn't it
Totally
Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa
(to Angel) Would it be okay if  called you Mommy
It would be so okay
Nicky hugs his Mom
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause 'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane
(
) You're already there
- Nicky dissolves into walking
He checks his pocket to see the ball
He looks up to see fifteen Demons marching towards him, ready to attack
Nicky closes his eyes and concentrates
Release
the good
When he opens them,   are floating around the head of five of the
They stop approaching
And their facial expression changes to happiness
They wave at the butterflies
keep closing
(') Release the good
Five more are stopped by something
They look down and see fluffy white   at their feet
They start petting them
The   advance on Nicky
(') Release the awesome
then stop, their path blocked by a very large bucket of '
The Demons consider the bucket of chicken
One Demon takes out a piece
(') Put it in your mouth and let it slide down your throat-hole
The Demon bites into it
He can't help but grin a little
Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'
The   dig into the bucket
- Only ten minutes left
- The dudes on the flagpoles are chatting nervously
One thing  really regret is never having experimented sexually
You mean, like, experiment with a Bunsen Burner
What are you talking about
He means getting it on with someone like that freak
: The student dancing for a mesmerized Demon
,  and His name is Andrew
know that guy
Of course you do, Tommy Tune
- Nicky leads his small army of reformed Demons (followed by butterflies & bunnies and carrying the chicken bucket) down the path toward the rally
We see they have a golden light/haze of good around them
- Adrian is underneath Valerie
You know, from this angle, you're kind of cute
You think so
Why don't you come a little closer and 'll show you a better angle
He moves a little closer, and she spits on him
He smiles
Opens his mouth and catches her spit
He swallows
Yummy
Everyone is grossed out
Oh my -d, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit
That turn you on there, RuPaul
Keep it up and  just might make you my Queen for a night or two
You want a queen
Got one right here
John points at Todd
They laugh
Adrian gets closer to Valerie
Just then a big butterfly appears on his shoulder
He looks down to see: Nicky standing there with his army
(
) Little Nicky
Adrian, 'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask
Is this a joke
No
It's the inner light
And with it we can defeat anything you've got
(eating Popeye's chicken) It's true
Adrian glares down at the
His eyes shoot out an evil ray
The Reformed Demon explodes into a million pieces
His golden insides splatter on the crowd
The Army of Good is shaken
Another Demon lowers his chicken
It's not true
The    sprouts legs and runs away
Nicky steps forward bravely
Okay, Adrian, you've left me with no choice
Nicky leaves frame and he flies up towards Adrian
- Nicky lands on both feet standing before Adrian
Love lifts me up where  belong
Crowd reacts
Demons are ready to attack
Adrian waves them off
Not bad, little brother
Let's see what you've got
Nicky thinks, holds out his hands
rainbow shoots out onto the stage between them
We see that a cute little chipmunk is standing on it's hindlegs eating a nut
The army of good and scared bad people applaud as they see this
Adrian nods, holds out his arms and a red stream shoots out
He has made a terrible  that comes over and eats the baffled chipmunk in one bite
Nicky raises his hand and: turns the snake into a row of flowers
Adrian raises his hand and a crazed   with a lawn mower comes by and mows them down
Nicky turns the Gardner and his lawn mower into a pushing a    in a carriage
Adrian turns the baby in the carriage into an   who leaps out and starts beating up on the mother
Nicky turns the Mother into a
The evil Dwarf stops beating her up and holds her hand
(') Enough
'm going to kill you with my bare hands
Adrian punches Nicky hard in the jaw
He goes flying off the platform
Nicky's body falls towards the ground
It's about to hit, when a soft bed of posts and fluffy pillows break his fall
- We now see Angel, Jenna, Christa and watching the action on the table
totally had to do that
Yah you did
is there, too
- Nicky looks up to see Adrian flying down towards him
Nicky rolls away at the last second
Adrian hits the bed hard and bounces up
Nicky grabs him mid-bounce and slams him back down into the golden/brass headboard of the bed
Nicky holds out the flask
Now 'm asking you nicely, get in the flas
Adrian grabs a pillow and hits Nicky hard in the face, sending him flying off the bed
(') Oh, you wanna a pillow fight, do you
Nicky is an expert pillow fighter
He lands a series of awesome, almost Matrix-like pillow moves
Adrian is dazed
Nicky finishes him off by tossing the pillow high in the air to him
Adrian looks up to catch it and just before it lands, Nicky steps up and pops him in the face
Adrian goes down hard
Nicky towers over him
(') Now will you get in the flask
Absolutely not
Adrian turns to his demons
(') little help over here
bunch of Demons advance
We see Henry Winkler, swollen with bee stings, valiantly run over and lowers the five from the flagpoles
He looks up and glares at Henry
(') Henry
Henry's eyes widen
Oh no
He is covered in bees again
He turns his attention back to Nicky who is grabbed by demons
Adrian brings the flask to his lips, but he won't open his mouth
Adrian pinches Nicky's nose closed so he has to open his mouth
Goodbye, Nicky
We hear  banging against the walls
(
) Come on in, bro
Nicky can't hold his breath and opens his mouth
Adrian jams the flask in his mouth and Nicky starts to get sucked in
Adrian smiles
But just before Nicky is gone, he manages to grab Adrian's coat tail and yank him into the flask with him
As the flask hits the ground, we : (
) (') Thank you, Nicky
Cause now 'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open
(
) was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius
swear
(
) Sole ruler of Hell and Earth is what heard him keep saying
We  the sounds of a struggle
All the Demons and all the people of   form a large circle around the flask
Valerie and the gang make it down off the stage
We  crazy sounds as the  starts to jump
The crowd big dent pops out from the inside, followed by a horrible thud
Nicky
(
) That was Cassius
The  starts rolling over and over on the road
People get out of the way as if it were real people fighting in the street
They root for their side
Kill him, Adrian
John and Peter start beating up the Demon
- The Angel and the Friend are praying
- We  banging and beating and yelling from inside and then the flask stops bouncing
Everybody outside holds their breath
Slowly out of the spout crawls
Valerie, John, Todd and Beefy and all the living people
The student, very happy, opens his kimono
The people and demons near him are grossed out
Valerie goes tot he very beaten up Nicky and hugs him
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that
From my dad's side of the family
She laughs and kisses him on the mouth
The crowd
But Nicky won't stop kissing her
She starts to struggle for air
Nicky presses harder and starts to laugh
The crowd stops
Valerie is waving her arms for help
Nicky turns into Adrian during the kiss
Adrian lets her go
And we hear ' familiar laugh
What
No tongue
Adrian pulls his head back, his tongue is huge and he turns into a
He lets out a huge roar, then flies around, laughing, scaring people
Valerie runs over and picks up the flask
She looks inside
(whispering) Nicky
Nicky
No response
(') You gotta fly out
know you can do it
(still no response) Do it for the butterflies
long beat, then: (
) Butterflies
And Nicky shoots right out of the top of the flask and lands on his feet
Adrian lands and stares down Nicky
The clock is one minute from midnight
Adrian swoops down
Nicky thinks quick and pulls out the his Mom gave him and smashes it on the ground
Out of it forms metal -d:
Hello, New York
Ozzy
They faint
The Bat's eyes go wide in fear
Ozzy grabs the bat, his mouth grows big, and he bites the bat's head off
Valerie hands Ozzy the flask
Put him in, Ozzy
Ozzy spits the bat head into the flask
The clock reads: 00:23 seconds left
- Dad is just a very thin pair of lips and one finger
The is going up and down on the lips, making silly sounds
The Gatekeeper, the Monster, Jimmy the Demon and Lucifer are on their backs crying like babies
- Grand Central, Nicky
Start running
He'll never make it
You gotta kill yourself
'll just go to Heaven
No if you do something bad right before you die
Everyone looks around
Nicky spots Henry Winkler
Aw, man, not again
Sorry, Henry
(focuses) Release the Evil
Henry is covered in bees once again
Nicky picks up a big rock and hands it to Valerie
(') Do me
love you
love you
Valerie smashes the rock on Nicky's head, killing him
Six seconds left
- The lips and finger are slowing down
- Nicky triumphantly passes through the wall of fire and it starts burning again behind him
And now all the fall out on top of Nicky
The Gatekeeper
- The , the  and everything that raised from Hell now descends quickly into the ground
- Dad's lips form a body around it
Dad
- The good people of New York cheer
We see John, Peter, Todd, Valerie, Beefy and the Student, who of course is dancing seductively
- Angel is so proud
Okay, you just saw my son save the universe
Right
Everyone cheers
- Dad and Nicky are hugging
You came through, Nicky
came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad
You're back in Hell now, kid
There's no butterflies here
If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth
What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell
Nicky,  let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting
(Dad looks up) That's right, you heard me, Holly
'm still in love with you
- Angel is shocked
Oh my -d
He's totally talking about me
- And don't think  forgot about how crazy you get after a few daiquiris
- That guy is still a horn dog
- Dad turns to Nicky
Listen,  got down low
Your mom's got up high
You take care of the middle
will, Dad
But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my
home sweet home
He pats him on the back
Sorry to interrupt guys, but it's time for Hitler's punishment
Let me handle that
Lucifer walks over to the closet
(') And 'm not using a pineapple this time
He pulls out the flask
(
) No
(
) Don't do it
He shoves the flask up Hitler's ass
Hitler's face tightens
Holy Schnit
, then: : Over the skyline of Manhattan
- from a moving baby stroller to reveal Nicky and Valerie both pushing it
We see Beefy walking with them
Unbelievably happy
nice   bends down to the stroller
Oh
what an uncommonly beautiful baby
Thank yo
Such a little angel
Only a quarter, ma'am
She tickles the baby
It giggles and a small stream of fire shoots out of his mouth and singes the Old Lady's eyebrows
Zachariah, say you're sorry
(sounds like Nicky) Sorry
The Lady scurries away
Nicky and Valerie laugh and continue walking in absolute bliss
They pass the Preacher who runs towards us
He has spilled his seed
He is multiplying
Beware the progeny of the unholy union
We're all gonna die
The Preacher runs straight into the camera
