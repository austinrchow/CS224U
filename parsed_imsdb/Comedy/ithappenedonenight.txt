Written by Robert previous hit Riskin based on a story by Samuel Hopkins Adams The  at Miami Beach fades in, providing quick views of yachts, aquaplanes, and luxurious ship-craft lying at anchor in the calm, tranquil waters of tropical Florida
This dissolves to the on the side of a yacht, reading " ," and this in turn to a where a steward is standing in front of a cabin door, near a small collapsible table upon which there is a tray of steaming food
He lifts lids and examines the contents
heavy-set sailor stands guard near the cabin door
[1] Fine
Fine
She ought to like this
(to the guard) Open the door
(without moving) Who's gonna take it in to her
You
Oh, no
(turning) Mullison
Come on
The view widens to include Mullison, a waiter
His eye is decorated with a "shiner
" Not me, sir
She threw a ketchup bottle at me this morning
Well, orders are orders
Somebody's gotta take it in
(he turns to someone else) Fredericks
The view moves to another waiter, who has a patch of bandage on his face
Before  bring her another meal, 'll be put off the ship first
' Henri
The view moves over to a Frenchman
(vehemently) No, Monsieur
When  leave the Ritz you do not say  have to wait on crazy womans
The view moves back to include the Steward and the others grouped around him
( ) My wife was an angel compared to this one, sir
And  walked out on her
208
(impatiently) Come on
Make up your mind
petty officer approaches
He is blustering and officious, but the type that is feeble and ineffective
His name is Lacey
(talking quicklystaccato) What's up
What's up
There is a fairly close picture of the featuring Lacey and the Steward
These pigs
They're afraid to take her food in
That's ridiculous
Afraid of a mere girl
(he wheels on the steward) Why didn't you do it yourself
(more afraid than the othersstammering) WhyIwell,  never thought about (shoving him aside) never heard of such a thing
Afraid of a mere girl
(moving to the tray) 'll take it in myself
They all stand around and watch him, much relieved
He picks up the tray and starts toward the door of the cabin
(as he walksmuttering) Can't get a thing done unless you do it yourself
(as he approaches the door) Open the door
We see him at the   as the guard quickly and gingerly unlocks it
Afraid of a mere girl
Ridiculous
Lacey stalks in bravely, the tray held majestically in front of him, while the steward and waiters form a circle around the door, waiting expectantly
There is a short pause, following which Lacey comes hurling out backwards and lands on his back, the tray of food scattering all over him
The steward quickly bangs the door shut and turns the key as the waiters stare silently
The scene dissolves to the of the yacht, first affording a close view of a pair of well-shod masculine feet, as they pace agitatedly back and forth
Then as the scene draws back, the possessor of the pacing feet is discovered to be Alexander Andrews, immaculately groomed in yachting clothes
In front of him stands a uniformed Captain, but Andrews, brows wrinkled, deep in thought, continues his pacing
209
(murmuring to himself) On a hunger strike, huh
(a grunt) When'd she eat last
She hasn't had a thing yesterdayor today
Been sending her meals in regularly
Yessir
She refuses them all
(snappily) Why didn't you jam it down her throat
It's not quite that simple
(he shakes his head) 've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one Absurd
(muttering) All this fuss over a snip of a girl
(suddenly) 'm going down to see her myself
He leaves with determination, followed by the Captain, and both are then seen walking in the direction of the cabin, Andrews grim
This is dangerous business, Mr
Andrews
After all, kidnapping is no child's play
But Andrews ignores him and merely stares grimly forward
They arrive in front of the cabin door, where Lacey is brushing himself off, and where a couple of waiters are picking up the last pieces of the broken dishes
What's this
What's happened here
(pathetically) She refused another meal, sir
Get another tray ready
Bring it here at once
(to the guard) Open the door
The Guard unlocks the door and Andrews enters
Then we get a view of the at the door, as Andrews enters and closes the door behind him
He looks around and his eyes light on his prisoner, following which the view swings over to , a beautiful girl in her early twenties
At the moment, she holds a small vase over her head ready to heave it, and her eyes flash angrily
At sight of her new visitor, however, she lowers the vase and sets it on a small table
210
What do you want
Andrews doesn't stir from the door
What's this about not eating
(sitting) don't want to eat
(raising her voice) And there's one more thing  don't want
Definitely
That's to see you
She lights a cigarette
Andrews watches her a moment
Know what my next move is
No more cigarettes
Why don't you put me in chains
might
(now seen at close range) All right
Put me in chains
Do anything you want
But 'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat
She stares petulantly out at the blue sky, but Andrews comes over and sits beside her
(tenderly) Come on, Ellie
Stop being silly
You know 'm going to have my way
(moving away) won't stand for it
won't stand for your running my life
Why do you insist on it
(still tender) You ought to know why
Because (interrupting) Yes
know
(she's heard it a million times) Because 'm your daughter and you love me
Because you don't want me to make any mistakes
Because (joining in) Because marrying that fool King Westley is 211
(snappily) You're wasting your time
'm already married to him
(sharply) Not so far as 'm concerned, you're not
(they are interrupted by a knock at the door) Yes
The door opens and several waiters parade in with trays of steaming food
(starting for them; threateningly) How many times have  told you not to bring any food in here
The waiters back up, frightened, but Andrews saves them
Wait a minute
Don't get excited
This isn't for you
(to the waiters) Put it right here
Ellie glares at her father, and wanders over to the window seat, while the waiters occupy themselves setting the table
Andrews putters around the food, lifting the lids from which tempting aromas emanate
He shuts his eyes, murmuring "oohs" and "ahs
" close-up of  shows her, too, drinking in the inviting aromas; and for a moment she weakens
close view of  shows him glancing toward Ellie to see her reaction; whereupon Ellie's face (again appearing in a close-up) freezes
Then Andrews and the waiters come into view
Anything else, Monsieur
No
Everything seems quite satisfactory
may want some more of that delicious gravy
'll ring
Very good, Monsieur
The waiters bow their way out as Andrews pecks at the food
(making clucking noise) Heavenly
Now Ellie appears in the foreground, with Andrews at the table in the background
(disdainfully) Smart, aren't you
So subtle
212
(chewing on a mouthful of food) If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India
You can't tempt me
(shouting unnecessarily) Do you hear
won't eat
(quietly) Please
can't fight on an empty stomach
Remember what Napoleon said
hope you're not comparing yourself to Napoleon
He was a strategist
Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe
Andrews eats silently while Ellie rants at him, walking around and puffing vigorously on her cigarette
(muttering) Most humiliating thing ever happened to me
(shuddering) bunch of gorillas shoving me in a car
That crowd outside the justice of the peacemust have thought  was a criminalor something
close view of  intercuts with part of Ellie's speech
At the end of her speech he smacks his lips, enjoying the food with too great a relish
Then the two are seen together
(after a pausestrongly) Where are you taking me
(carelessly) South America
(aghast) South America
We leave Miami in an hour
Soon's we get some supplies aboard
(threateningly) You'll have a corpse on your hands
That what You'll have
won't eat a thing while 'm on this boat
(buttering bread) In that event, we won't need so many supplies
213
(exasperated) What do you expect to accomplish by all this
'm already married
'll get it annulled
You'll never do it
You can't do it
(now seen close as he speaks between snatches of food) 'll do it if it takes every penny 've got
'll do it if  have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace
'll do itif  have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk
You probably were
(he smacks his lips) Mmmmmm
This filet mignon is divine
(seen with her father) What've you got against King Westley
Nothing much
just think he's a fake, that's all
You only met him once
That was enough
Do you mind handing me the ketchup
You talk as if he were a gigoloor something
(risingreaching for ketchup) Never mindI'll get it myself
(he falls back in his chair) Gigolo
Why, you took the word right out of my mouth
Thanks
(seen closer now, with Andrews) He's one of the best fliers in the country
Right now he's planning a trip to Japan
You're going to finance him,  suppose
Why not
Look what he's doing for aviation
It takes courage to do what he does
And character
At least he's accomplished something worthwhile
suppose you'd like to have me marry a business man
Well,  hate business menparticularly if you're a shining example
214
He grins, not at all offended, knowing she doesn't mean it
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing
To accumulate more money
At least there's romance in what he's doing
(unequivocally) He's no good, Ellie, and you know it
You married him only because  told you not to
(strongly) You've been telling me what not to do since  was old enough to remember
(screaming) 'm sick of it
And as Andrews ignores her, she starts moving around the table toward him
Next she appears sitting on the edge of Andrews' chair, and she throws her arm around his shoulder
(pleading sweetly) Aw, listen, Dad
Let's not fight like this any more
know you're worried about meand want me to be happy
And love you for it
But please try to understand
You're not being fair, darling
This isn't just a crazy impulse of mine
King and  talked about it a lot before we decided to get married
Lookwhy can't we give it a triallet's sayfor a year or so
If it's wrong, King and will be the first to know it
We can get a divorce, can't we
Now, be a dear, and let me off the boat
Keeping me prisoner like this is so silly
Andrews has been listening silently throughout the speech, giving no indication of his feelings in the matter
(unimpressed) You'll be set free when the marriage is annulled
close-up of , her eyes blazing angrily, shows her slowly edging away from her father, while he continues
' (carelessly) So there's no use being a stubborn idiot
(hissing) come from a long line of stubborn idiots
(again seen with her; calmly) time will come when you'll thank me for this
(wildly) won't thank you
'll never thank you
215
Please don't shout
'll shout to my heart's content
'll scream if  want to
(reaching for it) Ah
Coconut layer cake
Nice and gooey, too
Just the way  like it
He is about to insert the first bite in his mouth when Ellie, her temper vanishing completely, overturns the small serving table, dumping its contents into her father's lap
The movement is so unexpected that Andrews, the fork still suspended near his mouth, stares at her stupefied
Then realizing what she has done, his eyes flash in anger
Dropping his fork, he rises and goes over to her, while she stands facing him defiantly
Without a word or warning, he slaps her a stinging blow across the cheek
For a moment she doesn't stir, her eyes widening in surprise, and staring at him unbelievingly
Then turning abruptly she bolts out of the door
Andrews remains motionless, his eyes shutting painfully; it is the first time he has struck her, and it hurts
(calling) Ellie
(and he starts for the door) Next on the , at the open cabin door, Andrews is seen, staring off at something and an amazed, frightened look comes into his eyes
Then, as viewed from his position at the cabin door, Ellie appears standing on the rail; and with a professional dive, she leaps into the water
full view of the  reveals the crew and the officers scurrying around, several of them shouting: "Somebody overboard
" It's my daughter
Go after her
(shouting) Lower the boats
General excitement reigns; several of the crew dive into the water; others release the boat lines
Following this Ellie is seen swimming furiously against the giant waves
Next she appears as a small speck in the distance, while half a dozen of the crew are swimming in pursuit
At the     one of the boats has already been lowered, and two men jump in and grab the oars
The men seem to be gaining on Ellie
In the distance several small motor boats are anchored, and over the sides of the boats their owners are fishing
Ellie seems to be headed in their direction
One of the motor boats appears closer
middle-aged man sits on the stern, holding lazily to his line, his feet dangling in the water as the boat is tossed around by the turbulent waves
is then again seen swimming
She looks back, and the next scene shows the men rowing toward her, and gaining on her
Thereupon we see Ellie ducking under the water
216
The middle-aged fisherman is suddenly startled by Ellie's face which appears from under water, right between his legs
Ellie puts her finger up to her lips, warning him to shush, and he is too dumb-founded to say anything
As the pursuing boats come near, Ellie ducks under the water again and the boats scoot right by the fisherman
Then Ellie's head bobs up; she peers ahead of her, and seeing that her pursuers have passed her, she smiles victoriously
(to the fisherman) Thanks
(and she starts swimming toward shore) The scene dissolves to the  of the as Ellie's pursuers clamber aboard, Andrews waiting for them
Sorry, sir
She got away
(disappointed but proud) Of course she got awaytoo smart for you
What a hell cat
No controlling these modern girls
(murmuring) They're terrible
(resentfully) Terrible
Nothing terrible about her
She's great
Marvelous youngster
Got a mind of her own
Knows just what she wants
(smiling) She's not going to get it though
She won't get very far
Has no money
What about that diamond wrist watch she had onshe can raise some money on that
(his face falling) Holy Smoke
forgot all about that
(to the officer by his side) Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency
Daughter escaped again
Watch all roadsall transports and railroad stations in Miami
Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley
Intercept all messages
Want her back at all costs
" Yessir
The view draws in to afford a close-up of  staring out at the sea, his face wreathed in a broad smile; then this fades out
Part Two The   of an active terminal in Miami fades in
The view moves down to the entrance gate to the trains, passengers hur- 217
rying through it; then picks out two men, obviously detectives, who have their eyes peeled on everyone passing through
Then the view affords a glimpse of , who stands watching the detectives
This scene wiping off, we see an , with several planes tuning up in the background
As passengers file through, several detectives stand around in a watchful pose
This scene wiping off, the front of a comes into view
Several people walk in and out
At the side of the door, two detectives are on the lookout
This scene also wipes off, revealing the   of a
Over the ticket window there is a sign reading "   ," and a line forms in front of it
Here too there are two detectives
We're wastin' our time
Can you picture Ellie Andrews ridin' on a bus
told the old man it was the bunk
The view moves from them to , who stands behind a post and is watching the two detectives apprehensively
As the two (viewed from her position) stand by the ticket window, one of them turns toward her
Thereupon, we see her slipping behind a post, concealing herself
Just then a little old lady approaches her
Here's your ticket, ma'am
Oh, thank you
Thank you very much
(she takes the ticket and change from the old lady, and hands her a bill) Here
Oh, thank you
Thank you
When does the bus leave
In about fifteen minutes
Thank you
She picks up a small overnight bag from the floor and hurries away
She crosses to the entrance of the waiting room and disappears through the doors
The view then wings over to a telephone booth near the entrance
Clustered around the booth are half a dozen men of varied appearance
The inside of the booth is lighted, and a young man, Peter Warne, waves his hands wildly as he shouts into the phone, although it is impossible to hear what he is saying
close inspection of the men surrounding the booth (the scene contracting to a close view) reveals them as being slightly and happily intoxicated
short man approaches the door of the booth
218
Hey, what's going on here
'd like to use that phone
(a reporter) Shh
Quiet
This is history in the making
What
There's a man biting a dog in there
(drunker than the rest) Atta-boy, Petey, old boy
Atta-boy
' 'm not going to stand for this any longer
In a pig's eye, you will
Is that so
That's telling him, Petey old boy
close view of   in the telephone booth gives evidence of his having also imbibed freely
(shouting into the phone) Listen, monkey-facewhen you fired me, you fired the best newshound your filthy scandal sheet ever had
And the scene cuts to a New York where the night editor, Gordon, his sleeves rolled up, sits at his desk shrieking into the phone
Say, listen, you wouldn't know a story if it reached up and kicked you in the pants
(listening) Yeah
Sure, sure,  got your copy
Why didn't you tell me you were going to write it in Greek
'd start a new department
(again seen close at the phone) That was free verse, you gashouse palooka
(at the phone in the newspaper office) Free verse, huh
(shouting) What the dickens was free about it
It cost this paper a gob of dough
Well, 'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more
219
(in his phone booth) That's okay by me
'Cause as far as 'm concerned, 'm through with newspapers
See
'm through with stupidity
'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if  have to starve
(after a pause) Yeah
What about my novel
When  get through with that (in his office) When you get through with that, 'll have a beard down to my ankles
(at this point, Gordon's secretary enters) Mr
Gordon (looking up) Huh
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call
What
(into the phone) Say, listen you
When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this officeunless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours
(he bangs down the receiver viciously and glowers at the phone) In the   Peter reacts to the phone being hung up on him
But he goes right on for the benefit of the boys
(into the dead phone) Oh, so you're changing your tune, eh
Well, it's about time
But it's going to do you no good, my tough friend
It's a little too late for apologies
wouldn't go back to work for you if you begged me on your hands and knees
hope this is a lesson to you
He snaps up the receiver with a great pretense of outraged pride, following which the view expands to include his public
Atta-boy, Peter
That's telling him, Peter
The gang is full of admiration for the courageous way he talked to the boss as Peter staggers out of the booth
Give me any of his lip, will he
Huh
guess he knows now what  think of his job
(expansively) Is my chariot ready
220
Your chariot awaiteth withouteth, oh mighty King
Make way for the King
Long live the King
Make way
With head held high, he struts majestically out of sight, followed by his admirers, following which the scene dissolves to the
His inebriated admirers stand around the entrance to a bus, while Peter stands on the steps, his suitcase in his hand
(making a grand speech) That's right, my friends
Cling to your jobs
Remain slaves the rest of your lives
Scum of the earth
Newspaper men
Not me
When 'm basking in the glorious arms of the Musewhat'll you be doing
Chasing news
You miserable worms
For what
mere pittance
My heart goes out to you
(with arms extended and in tremolo voice) Good-bye
(and with this he turns his back and enters the bus) (in the same spirit) Goodbye, Oh mighty King
Peace be with you, Courageous One
' All aboard
Philadelphia, New York
All aboard
Look out
Get back
Farewell
Farewell
Scram
The scene cuts to the  of the as viewed from the front, the view moving forward, passing the conglomerate of unprepossessing human beings who occupy the seats
Every space is taken and the occupants seem hot and uncomfortable, which adds to their uninviting appearance
Mothers cling to crying babies
Swedish farm hand and his young wife are already busy opening their basket of food prepared for the long journey
surly-looking hoodlum traveling alone is slumped in his seat, his cap drawn carelessly over his eyes
The moving view passes these and other characters until it reaches one unoccupied seat in the car, unoccupied except for several bundles of newspapers
Standing before the seat is Peter, his suitcase in his hand, speculating as to what disposition to make of the newspapers
(calling) Hey, driver
How about clearing this stuff away
Several passengers (seen from his position in the back) crane their necks to scrutinize the intruder
Through a glass partition the driver can be seen receiving his last minute instructions from a superintendent, who stands on the running board, their voices in- 221
distinguishable
In answer to Peter's request, the driver glances back indifferently, and continues talking to the superintendent
close view of  shows him arching his eyebrows, an amused acknowledgment of the disdainful attitude of the driver
He drops his suitcase and starts forward
Then we see him arriving at the glass partition, and Peter taps playfully on the pane with his finger-nails, whereupon the driver turns and pulls the window down a few inches
(annoyed) Whadda you want
(pleasantly) If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers 'll have a seat
(irritably) Okay
Okay
Keep your shirt on, young feller
(with which remark the driver turns away from him) (looking at the back of the driver's neck for a moment, then confidentially) Just between you and me,  never intended taking it off
He wheels around uncertainly and swaggers jauntily down the aisle toward the empty seat
En route he bestows genial smiles upon several of his disgruntled fellow passengers, and he stops in front of a robust lady who at the moment is breastfeeding her baby while a lighted cigarette dangles from her lips
Personally,  was raised on a bottle
(as the woman looks up at him, perplexed) When  was a baby,  insisted on it
You know why
(as the woman stares up stupidly) never liked the idea of getting cigarette ashes in my eyes
He moves forward, leaving the woman unable to make head or tail of it; and assuming that he's crazy, she shrugs her shoulders and turns her attention to the baby
Now  arrives at his seat, and whistling softly, raises the window
Unhurriedly, he picks the newspaper bundles up one by one and flings them out of the window
They hit the sidewalk below with a dull thud
Thereupon a close view of the shows him reacting violently to Peter's unprecedented cheek, and starting down from his seat
has now cleared the seat of all the newspaper bundles and still whistling his favorite melody, he picks up his suitcase preparatory to placing it in the rack overhead
At this point, the driver enters the side door of the bus
(pugnaciously) Hey, wait a minute
222
Peter, his arms holding the suitcase over his head, turns and glances at the driver, a quizzical look in his eyes
(coming forward) What do you think you're doing
(turning) Huh
(bellowing) The papers
The papers
Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out
Ohthe papers He slowly lowers his arms and deposits the suitcase on the floor
(now seen close, with the Driver) That's a long story, my friend
You see,  don't like sitting on newspapers
did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants
Hey, whadda you tryin' to dokid me
Oh,  wouldn't kid you
On the level, it actually happened
Nobody bought a paper that day
They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants
What're you gonna do about the papers
Somebody's gotta pick 'em up
(turning to his suitcase) It's okay with me
'm not arguing
(pugnaciously) Fresh guy, huh
What you need is a good sock on the nose
(turning back to him) Look here, partner
You may not like my nose
But  do
It's a good nose
The only one 've got
always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it
If you decide to do it, make sure you don't miss
During his speech, Ellie enters from the rear and plunks herself into Peter's seat
Unseen by Peter, she places her small bag beside her
223
(answering Peter; weakly) Oh, yeah
Now, that's a brilliant answer
Why didn't  think of it
Our conversation could have been over long ago
Oh, yeah
(exhausted) You win
Smiling, he turns to sit down
But the smile dies on his face when he finds his place occupied by Ellie, who stares out the window
(now at close range, with Ellie) Excuse me, lady (slowly) but that upon which you sitis mine
Ellie glances up at himthen down at her buttocks
(eyes flashing) beg your pardon
Now, listen
'm in a very ugly mood
put up a stiff battle for that seat
So if it's just the same to you (gesturing with thumb) scram
(ignoring himcalling) Driver
The driver, who has stopped to witness this new altercation, returns
Are those seats reserved
(pleased to discomfort Peter) No
First come, first served
(dismissing the whole thing) Thank you
(Peter, thwarted for a moment, just glares at her) (also calling) Driver
Yeah
224
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they
(hating to give in) Maybe they doand maybe they don't
Peter lifts Ellie's overnight bag off the seat and drops it on the floor
Part of her coat covers the small space by her side
This he sweeps across her lap
Move over, lady
This is a "maybe they do
" He plops into the seat, the other passengers around them heaving a sigh of relief
Ellie flashes him a devastating look and deliberately turns her back on him
But Peter suddenly looks down toward the floor, following which a close-up reveals that Ellie's bag on the floor annoys Peter
With his foot he slowly moves it over to her, and Ellie's foot is seen pushing it back, whereupon Peter viciously kicks it over to her side again
Next we see Ellie glaring at him, picking up her bag, and standing on the seat depositing it on the rack overhead
But just then the bus starts forward with a lurch which unbalances her, and she falls backward right in Peter's lap
Their noses almost touch
Their eyes meet, and they glare at each other hostilely
Ellie quickly scrambles off and gets back in her seat, turning her back on him
(amused) Next time you drop in, bring your folks
This dissolves to a  , and the bus sways perilously as it speeds through the night, following which the view dissolves to the  of the , revealing Peter slumped in his seat, his hat drawn over his eyes
Ellie has her head thrown back, trying to sleep
But the swaying bus causes her head to roll from side to side uncomfortably, and finally she gives up
(an order) Tell that man not to drive so fast
(at which Peter just cocks his head slightly) Are you talking to me
Yes
Tell that man to drive slowly
Peter stares at her a moment, resenting her officious manner
(pleasantly) Okay
And much to her surprise, he sighs deeply and relaxes to his former position, shutting his eyes
She glares at him crushingly
The scene dissolves to another view of the , disclosing the driver, and suddenly the bus comes to a stop
225
(sticking his head in to face the passengers) Rest station
Ten minutes
The view draws back as some of the passengers rise
The men stretch their legs, and the women straighten out their skirts
close view of Peter and Ellie then shows her rising
Peter accommodatingly shoves his feet aside for her to pass, and Ellie starts up the aisle
But she suddenly stops; looks back, first at her bag and then at Peter; decides to take her bag with her, and returns to take it
She reaches for it on the rack, Peter watching her, amused
The scene dissolves to the outside of the   with several passengers walking briskly back and forth
The place is dimly lit by one or two lamp-posts, and Peter can be seen leaning against one of these posts, smoking a cigarette
The scene moving in, a close view of Peter shows him stealing a glance in the direction of Ellie
And a view, from his angle, reveals Ellie in the shadow of the bus, her bag at her feet
She slowly turns her head toward Peter and then quickly averts it
(seen close) speculates about her
He glances around the place, and the scene moves about, following his gaze
It takes in the other passengers, all obviously poor and uncultured
The moving view reaches Ellie
The contrast is perceptible
Thereupon, we see Peter reacting with comprehension: No doubt about it
She doesn't belong with these passengers
Then suddenly he sees something which startles him, and we see what it is: Directly in back of her, the young hoodlum passenger slyly lifts her overnight bag from the ground and starts running with it
Ellie is oblivious of his actions
springs forward
Ellie sees Peter coming toward her and is perceptibly startled
But Peter whizzes by her, and this amazes her even more
She shrugs her shoulders, perplexed, and resumes her smoking
In a few seconds Peter returns, puffing breathlessly
He got away
suddenly found myself in the middle of the brush and not a sign of the skunk
(seen close with ) doesn't know what he's talking about
She looks at him, puzzled
don't know what you're raving about, young man
And, furthermore, 'm not interested
(taken aback) Wellof all thewell (hard) Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone
At this, Ellie wheels around and stares at the spot where her bag had been
Oh, my heavens
It's gone
226
(sarcastically) Yeah
knew you'd catch on eventually
What happened
That cadaverous-looking yegg[2] who sat in front of us, just up and took it
Boy, how that baby can run
What am  going to do now
Don't tell me your ticket was in it
(opening her purse) No, 've got that, all right
But my money
All  have here is four dollars
've got to get to New York with it
You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville
Why, noI (catching herself) Yes
guess  will
(starting out) 'll report it to the driver
About your bag,  mean
(quickly) No
'd rather you didn't
Don't be a fool
You lost your bag
The company'll make good
What's your name
don't want it reported
Why, that's ridiculous
They're responsible for everything that (hotly) See here, can you understand English
don't want it reported
(she starts away) Please stay out of my affairs
want to be left alone
(with which she disappears from the scene) close-up of  shows him glaring after her
227
(mumbling) Why, you ungrateful brat
The scene dissolves to the , where all the passengers are scattering back to their seats; Peter is already seated, when Ellie arrives
close view then shows her standing uncertainly for a moment, speculating whether to cross over his legs to get her place by the window
Peter feels her presence by his side and glances up
She tosses her head and plants herself in the seat in front of him, vacated by the young man who stole her bag
Peter takes the affront with a shrug and slides over gratefully to the coveted spot near the window
The scene dissolves to a close view of Ellie and a recently arrived fat man next to her
She has her head thrown back in an effort to sleep, but the fat man, his hands clasped over his protruding stomach, snores disgustingly, and the rumble of the flying bus accompanies him
Suddenly the bus careens, the fat man falls against Ellie, and she awakens with a start and pushes him back
The fat man's snoring goes on uninterrupted, and Ellie relaxes again; but in a few seconds the procedure is repeated, and Ellie is beside herself
She looks around for somewhere to flee
, seated in back of her, in his customary slumped position, opens his eyes slightly
It is apparent he has been watching her for some time, for he grins at her discomfiture
Ellie's head turns in his direction and the grin leaves Peter's face
He shuts his eyes and pretends to be asleep
Ellie glances at Peter to make certain he is asleep
The fat man falls against her again and it is all she can stand
She starts to rise
Peter sees her coming and deliberately puts his hand on the seat next to him, still pretending to be asleep
Just as Ellie starts to sit, she notices his hand and is embarrassed
Gingerly she picks up his limp hand and places it on his knee
She then slides into the seat, sighing with relief, whereupon Peter opens his eyes and is amused
Slowly his head turnsand he scrutinizes her, soberly and appraisingly
Ellie slowly turns her head for a glimpse of Peterand is startled to find him gazing at her
She turns forward, her jaw set forbiddingly
The scene dissolves to the view of a It is dawn, and in the distance, against the horizon, the bus, a mere speck, makes its lone way over the deserted country
This dissolves to a large , reading "," and then into the  affording a close view of and
They are both asleep, her head resting comfortably on his shoulder, Peter's topcoat thrown over her
Then the view draws back
The bus is empty except for Ellie and Peter, the last few passengers are just leaving
's eyes slowly open
He looks down at the head on his shoulder and grins
With a sigh, he shuts his eyes again and resumes his slumber
Next, at the front of the bus, the  stands staring at Peter and Ellie in this intimate position and his mouth twists knowingly
(murmuring) Oh, yeah
stirs, squirms a little uncomfortably and with a sleepy grunt shifts her position
Just as she settles down, her eyes open
She stares out of the window with unseeing eyes, and then closes them 228
dreamily, giving the impression that, still half conscious, she is trying to recall where she is
Apparently she does, for her eyes suddenly snap open and she lifts her head
Finally (in a scene including Peter), Ellie realizes that she has been sleeping on his shoulder, whereupon she straightens up, embarrassed
Oh, 'm sorry (feebly smiling) Silly, isn't it
She looks around, and her finding herself alone with Peter adds to her embarrassment
Everybody's gone
She lifts her arms to adjust her hat and becomes conscious of his coat over her which slips
She stares at it thoughtfully for a momentthen at Peter
(realizing that he put it there) Oh, thank you
(she hands him his coat; ill at ease) We're in Jacksonville, aren't we
Yes
(nervously) That was foolish of me
Why didn't you shove me away
hated to wake you up
(she glances at him speculatively) How about some breakfast
No, thank you
(she rises, anxious to get away) Thank you so much
Most uncomfortably, she edges away from him toward the front of the bus, Peter watching her leave, his interest definitely provoked
The scene cuts to the  as Ellie emerges from the bus
At the foot of the steps is the driver
How much time have
About a half hour
'm going over to the Windsor Hotel
Peter appears in the door of the bus in the background, and a close view then shows him stopping to listen as he sees Ellie talking to the driver
229
' The Windsor
You'll never make it in time
' You'll have to wait for me
' (aghast) Wait for you
smile flits across Peter's face; then a wider view shows Ellie leaving the driver
(as she goes) Yes
may be a few minutes late
She disappears from sight, leaving the driver staring at her, dumbly; and Peter, standing in back of the driver, shakes his head in amazement
The scene dissolves to the later that morningat the same spot where the bus had previously been
It is no longer there, however
huge crowd fills the space, and the view moving down through the crowd, singles Ellie out
She has just arrived and looks around helplessly
Finally she spots a uniformed terminal guard and approaches him
(now next to the Guard) Where's the bus to New York
Left twenty minutes ago
Why, that's ridiculous
was on that busI told them to wait
Sorry, Miss
It's gone
(and he turns his back on her) Ellie's face clouds
The crowds surge about her
She looks around thoughtfully
Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the view then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie
Good morning
Peter is in the foreground, the guard is seen in the background
Ellie stares at Peter, perplexed
Remember me
'm the fellow you slept on last night
Seems to me 've already thanked you for that
(turning to guard) What time is the next bus to New York
230
(turning) Eight o'clock tonight
Eight o'clock
Why, that's twelve hours
Sorry, Miss
The Guard leaves the scene, and Ellie's disappointment is apparent
(sarcastically) What's the matter
Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you
(Ellie glares at him, disdaining to replythis angers him, and he continues hotly) Say, how old are you anyway
Don't you know these busses work on a schedule
You need a guardian
(starting away) What are you excited about
You missed the bus, too
Peter looks at her a moment before replying
(quietly) Yeah
missed it, too
There is a close view of the two
She turns to him
Her interest is provoked by his tone of voice
She glances up into his face
Don't tell me you did it on my account
(pause) hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is (she interrupts herself) You needn't concern yourself about me, young man
can take care of myself
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it
(he reaches in his pocket) Here's your ticket
(surprised) My ticket
found it on the seat
(taking it) Oh, thank you
Must have fallen out of my pocket
231
While she is putting the ticket away in her purse, Peter speaks: You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews
(this is a shock to Ellie) (weakly) What are you talking about
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man
You and Westley'll make an ideal team
(bluffing it through) Will you please tell me what you're raving about
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews
Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York
You must have me confused with (interrupting) Quit kidding
It's all over the front pages, You know, 've always been curious about the kind of a girl that would marry King Westley
He pulls a newspaper out of his pocket and hands it to her
Ellie glances at the headline hurriedly
(while she reads) Take my advicegrab the first bus back to Miami
That guy's a phony
(looking up at him) didn't ask for your advice
(she hands the paper back) That's right
You didn't
You're not going to notify my father, are you
(looking at her squarely) What for
If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it
(a disdainful expression crosses his face) never thought of that
232
(frantically) Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, 'll pay you
'll pay you as much as he will
You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as 'm willing to make it worth your while
've got to get to New York without being stopped
It's terribly important to me
'd pay now, only the only thing  had when jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and  had to pawn that to get these clothes
'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York
(furious) Never mind
You know  had you pegged right from the start, you're the spoiled brat of a rich father
The only way you can get anything is to buy it
Now you're in a jam and all you can think of is your money
It never fails, does it
Ever hear of the word "Humility"
No, you wouldn't
guess it never occurred to you to just say, "Please mister, 'm in trouble
Will you help me
" No; that'd bring you down off your high horse for a minute
Let me tell you something; maybe it'd take a load off your mind
You don't have to worry about me
'm not interested in your money or your problems
You, King Westley, your father, you're all a lot of hooey to me
He turns his back on her and leaves
close-up of  shows her staring after him, her eyes blazing angrily
In a  , Peter addresses a girl operator as he drops a telegram on the counter, which she reads
(brusquely) You send telegrams here
(recognizing him apparently, sarcastically) 'm just fine thanks, and how are you
(reading) To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York
Am  laughing
The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap
know where Ellen Andrews is" (looking up excitedly) No, do you really
(impatiently) Go on
Go on send the telegram
"How would you like to have the story, you big tub ofof" Mush
Mush
233
"Tub of mush
Well try and get it
What said about never writing another line for you still goes
Are you burning
Peter Warne
" Well, that will be $2
60
Send it collect
Collect
Peter (firmly) Collect
As the clerk takes the wire from him, scene fades out
Part Three The   fades in
It is night now, and the rain comes down in torrents
People scurry around to get into the buses as the voice of an announcer is heard: ' Bus for blah-blah-blah-blahCharlestonblah-blah-blahand all points North to New York
This dissolves to the interior of a , which is practically filled
Peter is in his seat, reading a magazine, while Ellie enters hurriedly from the rear door and starts forward
As she approaches Peter, she hesitates a second, and deliberately passes him, plunking herself into a seat in the opposite aisle
Peter turns just as she gets seated
He glances at her indifferently
close view shows Ellie seated next to a man who sits reading a newspaper which covers his face
Her eyes are fixed forward, her lips set adamantly
close-up of the  next to Ellie makes it plain that he is a typical drummer
[3] At the moment he is absorbed in a serial story, but suddenly he becomes aware of something at his feet, and without lowering the newspaper, his gaze slowly shifts downward
At this, the view moves down until it reaches Ellie's trim ankles
Her feet beat a regular tattoo on the floor; her extreme agitation is evident
The view moves back slowly, taking in Ellie's shapely leg as far as the knee
Then we see and the  as his gaze is still fixed on her leg
Slowly his face breaks into a lascivious grin, he lowers his paper, and turns for a scrutiny of her face
What he sees apparently delights him, for he drops his paper completelyand smiles broadly
Hi, sisterAll alone
My name's Shapeley
(Ellie favors him with a devastating look which is wasted on the drummer) Might as well get acquainted
It's gonna be a long tripgets tiresome later on
Specially for somebody like you
You look like you got class
(he surveys her from head to foot) Yessir
With a capital
(he chuckles at his own sally) And 'm a guy that knows class when he sees it, believe you me
234
close-up of , as Shapeley's voice continues, shows her glancing back at Peter, expecting him to come to her rescue
' Ask any of the boys
They'll tell you
Shapeley sure knows how to pick 'em
Yessir
Shapeley's the name, and that's the way  like 'em
Ellie again looks toward Peter
But seems to have found something of unusual interest in his magazine and we again see the harassed and the irrepressible , who continues
You made no mistake sitting next to me
(confidentially) Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about
You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what  always say, and you can't be too particular, neither
Once when  was comin' through North Carolina, got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama
One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too
Kinda struck my fancy
You know how it is
Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck
was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus
Who do you think she was
Huh
Might as well give up
The girl bandit
The one the papers been writin' about
(he pulls out a cigar, and continuesawed by the recollection) Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck
(he lights his cigar, takes a vigorous puff, and turns to her again) What's the matter, sister
You ain't sayin' much
(intending to freeze him) Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance
(this however only brings a guffaw from the drummer) That's pretty good
Well, shut my big nasty mouth
close-up shows  enduring more of this as Shapeley's voice continues: ' Looks like you're one up on me
Nothin'  like better than to meet a high-class mama that can snap 'em back at you
'Cause the colder they are, the hotter they get, is what  always say
Now Ellie and Shapeley are seen together, with Peter seen in the background
235
Take this last town  was in
run into a damenot a bad looker, eitherbut boy, was she an iceberg
Every time opened my kisser she pulls a ten strike on me
It sure looked like cold turkey for old man Shapeley
sell office supplies, see
And this hotsy-totsy lays the damper on me quick
She don't need a thingand if she did she wouldn't buy it from a fresh mugg like me
Well, says  to myselfShapeley, you better go to work
You're up against a lulu
Well, 'm here to tell you, sister, opened up a line of fast chatter that had that dame spinnin' like a Russian dancer
Before  got through she bought enough stuff to last the firm a year
And did she put on an act when  blew town
Ellie has scarcely listened to him, and has divided her attention between glancing back at Peter and staring at Shapeley as if he were insanenone of which bothers Shapeley
He goes on with his merry chatter, blowing rings of smoke in the direction of the ceiling
Yessir
When a cold mama gets hotboy, how she sizzles
She kinda cramped my style, though
didn't look at a dame for three towns
(quickly) Not that  couldn't
For me it's always a cinch
got a much better chance than the local talent
(confidentially) You see, they're kinda leery about the local talent
Too close to home
Know what  mean
has now reached the point where she could, without any compunction, strangle him
' (continuing over this glimpse of her desperation) But take a bird like meit's here todayand gone tomorrow
And what happens is nobody's business
At this time she turns helplessly toward Peter, but we see  being deliberately oblivious of her presence, following which the three are seen, with Peter in the background
But  don't go in for that kinda stuffmuch
like to pick my fillies
Take you, for instance
You're my type
No kiddin' sister
could go for you in a big way
"Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me
(this is all Ellie can stand) (snappily) Believe you me, you bore me to distraction
236
(but Shapeley merely throws his head back and emits his characteristic guffaw) (laughing) Well, you're two up on me now
(he holds up two fingers) (approaching them) Hey, you
Shapeley's laugh dies down
He looks dumbly up at Peter, his two fingers still held in mid-air
Huh
(indicating his own seat) There's a seat over there for you
What's the idea
'd like to sit with myuhwifeif you don't mind
(at which Shapeley's face falls) (puzzled) Wife
Yeah
Come oncome on
(rising) Oh, excuse me
(edging away) was just tryin'you knowto make things pleasant
And smiling sheepishly, he sidles over to Peter's seat, his two fingers still poised in air
Peter plants himself next to Ellie and totally ignoring her, opens his magazine, and resumes his reading
Then Ellie and Peter are seen close together
She looks up at him
If you promise not to snap my head off, 'd like to thank you
(without turning) Forget it
didn't do it for you
His voice got on my nerves
She feels herself crushed, and ventures no further comment as Peter resumes his interest in his magazine
full view of the  follows, and there is silence for a while as the bus slows down and comes to a stop
Almost simultaneously a boy makes his appearance, selling magazines and candy
237
Here you are, folks
Candypopcorncigarettesmagazines As Ellie and Peter are seen again, she turns and calls to the boy: Here, boy
(turning to her) What'd you do
Wire one of your friends for money
(rummaging in her purse) No
It'd be useless
Father'd get the wire before they would
(as he enters) Yes, ma'am
box of chocolates, please
(to the boy) Never mind, son
She doesn't want it
(he gestures with his thumb for the boy to leave) (puzzled) But the lady says Of course  do
What do you mean (to the boy) Beat it
(and the boy, frightened by his voice, leaves) (resentfully) You have your nerve
(she starts to rise) Here, boy
Peter snatches the purse out of her hand and takes the money out
Ellie stares at him dumbfounded
dollar sixty
You had four dollars last night
How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going
(vehemently) That's none of your business
(with finality) You're on a budget from now on
238
(he flings her purse back at her and pockets the money) Now, just a minuteyou can't Shut up
He returns to his magazine, leaving her staring at him petulantly as the scene fades out
Part Four at night
This is apparently on the outskirts of a town
Two local policemen and our bus driver stand in the foreground near a police booth
The rain sweeps across their faces as they talk
The passengers in the bus, which stands in the background, stick their heads out, trying to hear what is going on
You won't be able to pass till morning
Not even then, if this keeps up
Peter approaches the group and is then seen with the officers and the driver
What's up
Bridge washed outaround Dawson
Looks like we can't go through till morning
(his only contribution) Not even then, if this keeps up
Any of your passengers want a place to sleepthere's an auto camp up yonder a piece
(interested) Yeah
Where
(pointing) Up yonder
See the lights
Yeah
That's it
Dyke's Auto Camp
Thanks
239
He dashes toward the bus
Then he appears at the side door of the bus
(calling) Hey, Brat
(he is about to enter when he sees Ellie) The view moves to the rear door of the bus
Ellie stands on the bottom step
(haughtily) Are you talking to me
Yeah
Come onwe're stopping here for the night
He disappears inside the bus through the side door
With an independent toss of her head, Ellie turns and also enters the bus, but through the rear door
The scene dissolves to '
Ellie stands alone on the porch of a small bungalow, sheltered from the rain
Over her head is a sign reading: -Dyke Auto Co
Dyke, Prop
She looks about her restlessly, giving the impression that she has been waiting for someone
Suddenly she is attracted by something and gazes in its direction
Then, as seen by Ellie in a long view, there appears, about twenty yards away, a small cabin, lighted on the inside; and from it Peter emerges accompanied by a manpresumably Mr
Dyke
We cannot hear what is being said; from their movements, however, it is apparent that an exchange of money is taking place
Dyke waves his hand in departure and starts toward Ellie
At the same time, Peter calls to her: (shouting) Hey
Come on
We're all set
(saying which he enters the cabin) Ellie hesitates a moment, then starts toward the cabin
Now she is hurrying across the open space
En route she passes Dyke
(as they pass) Good evening
Hope you and your husband rest comfortably
Ellie keeps on running, but suddenly she stops dead and looks back at Dyke, following which a close-up of shows her eyes opening wide with astonishment
Her impulse is to call Dyke back, to make him repeat what he saidto make certain she heard him correctly
But Dyke is gone, and she turns and glances thoughtfully in the direction of the cabin
Then slowly the corners of her mouth screw up in an attitude of cynicism
So that's it, is it
He has given her no previous evidence of being "on the make"; yet now, with the first opportunity
Her thoughts, however, are interrupted by Peter's voice: ' Well, Bratwhat do you say
240
As she doesn't stir, there appears a close-up view of  standing in the doorway of the cabin, looking toward Ellie
(impatiently) Come on
Come on
What are you going to do
Stand there all night
(he disappears inside) For a long moment,  is lost in speculation as to how to proceed
Then, tossing her head defiantly, with her lips set grimly, she starts toward the cabin until she reaches it, stops in the doorway and peers in
As she does this, there is a view of the inside of the , as seen by her at the door
Except for two cots on either side of the room, a few sticks of cane furniture, a small table upon which stands an oil burner for cooking, the place is barren
At the moment Peter is attaching a clothes line across the center of the room
His suitcase is already open
And now Ellie steps inside, surveying the place contemptuously
But Peter, with his back to her, is oblivious of her presence; and as he works, he hums his favorite melody
Ellie finally breaks the silence
(sarcastically) Darn clever, these Armenians
(seen close as he turns) Yeah
Yeah, it's a gift
(but he finishes his hammering and turns to his suitcase) (seen with Peter) just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband
(carelessly) Oh,  forgot to tell you
registered as Mr
and Mrs
(the matter-of-fact way in which he says this causes her eyebrows to lift) Oh, you did
What am  expected to doleap for joy
kind of half expected you to thank me
Your ego is colossal
(blithely) Yeah
Yeah, not bad
How's your's
There is silence for a moment, and Peter proceeds with the unpacking of his suitcase
As she watches him, Ellie's mood changes from one of anger to that of sarcasm
241
(appearing in a close-up, her face disdainful) Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur
(sharply) Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this
You're positively the most conceited ' (interrupting) Hey, wait a minute
(appearing beside her) Let's get something straightened out right now
If you've any peculiar ideas that 'm interested in you, forget it
You're just a headline to me
(frightened) headline
You're not a newspaper man, are you
Chalk up one for your side
Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you
All right, 'm here to help you
What  want is your story, exclusive
day-to-day account
All about your mad flight to happiness
need that story
Just between you and me 've got to have it
Now isn't that just too cute
There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there
You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this
This
Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics
These cabins cost two bucks a night and 'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments
(he goes back to the business of laying out his things) (starting to leave) Well, thank you
Thank you very much, but you've been very kind
(but the rain outside causes her to hesitate) Oh, yeah
It's all right with me
Go on out in the storm, but 'm going to follow you, see
Yeah
And if you get tough 'll just have to turn you over to your old man right now
Savvy
Now that's my whole plot in a nutshell
simple story for simple people
Now if you behave yourself, 'll see that you get to King Westley; if not, 'll just have to spill the beans to papa
Now which of these beds do you prefer
This one
All right
While he speaks he has taken the extra blanket from the cot and hung it over the clothes line
This manages to divide the room in half
242
close view at the door shows Ellie watching him with interest
(sarcastically) That,  suppose, makes everythinguhquite all right
(the previous scene returning) Oh, this
like privacy when  retire
'm very delicate in that respect
Prying eyes annoy me
(he has the blanket spread out now) Behold the walls of Jericho
[4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer
You see,  have no trumpet
(taking out pajamas) Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, 'll give you my best pair of pajamas
He flings them over to her, and she catches them and throws them on her cot
Throughout the scene she hasn't budged from the door, but Peter now prepares to undress
Do you mind joining the Israelites
You're not really serious about this, are you
(seen at close range, going about the job of undressing very diffidently) All right, don't join the Israelites
Perhaps you're interested in how a man undresses
(and he hangs his coat over the chair) Funny thing about that
Quite a study in psychology
No two men do it alike
(now his shirt is coming off) close view of  shows her standing stubbornly
' once knew a chap who kept his hat on until he was completely undressed
(chuckling) Made a comical picture
As the scene includes both of them, Peter spreads his shirt over his coat
Years later his secret came out
He wore a toupee
He lights a cigarette diffidently while she remains brazenly watching him, her eyes flashing defiantly
have an idiosyncrasy all my own
You'll notice my coat came firstthen the tiethen the shirtnow, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next
But that's where 'm different
243
(he bends over) go for the shoes first
After that (unable to stand it any longer) Smart aleck
And thoroughly exasperated, she goes behind the blanket, and plops on the cot
She sits on the edge, debating what to do, feeling herself trapped
Her impulse is to leave, if only to show this smart aleck he's not dealing with a child, and she rises impetuously and moves to the window
close view at the  shows her looking out
The downpour has not abated one bit, and the heavy raindrops clatter against the window pane in a sort of challenge to Ellie, whose jaw drops
She turns slowly back to the room, and as she does so her eyes light on the cot
It looks most inviting; after all, she hasn't had any rest for two nights
She falls on the cot again, her shoulders sagging wearily
Following this, the view reveals both sides of the blanket
Peter is already in his pajamas
Still with me, Brat
(there is no answer from Ellie) Don't be a sucker
night's rest'll do you a lot of good
Besides, you've got nothing to worry about
The Walls of Jericho will protect you from the big bad wolf
close view shows  glancing over at the blanket
Despite herself, the suggestion of a smile flits across her face
You haven't got a trumpet by any chance, have you
gets the idea and smiles broadly
Not even a mouth organ
Pulling the covers back, he prepares to get into bed, humming as he does so
(humming to himself) Who's afraid of the big bad wolf The big bad wolf, the big bad wolf
(louder) She's afraid of the big bad wolf, Tra-la-la-la-la (he springs into bed) Ellie smiles, and wearily she pulls her hat off her head
She sits this way a moment, thoughtfully; then, determined, she looks up
Do you mind putting out the light
Not at all
244
(he leans over and snaps it off) The room is thrown into darkness except for a stream of light coming in the window from the night-light outside the camp
Visible are Peter's face and arms as he stares ceilingward, while on Ellie's side all we can see of her is her silhouette, except for such times as she gets in direct line with the window
There are glimpses of her as she moves around in the process of undressing, and we see, or rather sense, her dress dropping to the floor
She now stands in her chemise; this being white silk, it stands out more prominently against the darkness
She picks up the pajamas and backs into a corner, following which a close-up of her head and shoulders shows her glancing apprehensively toward Peter's side of the room; and holding the pajamas in front of her with one hand, with the other she slips the strap off her shoulders
She flings her "slip" over the blanket
, on his side of the room, looks toward the blanket, and reacts to the "slip" coming into sight
Then other undergarments join the "slip" on the blanket
(hoarsely) Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho
(a pause) It's tough enough as it is
' Oh, excuse me
(and we see the underthings flipped off the blanket
) Ellie's side of the room appears, showing her crawling quickly into bed, pulling the covers over her and glancing apprehensively in Peter's directionfollowing which a close view shows  being very conscious of her proximity
The situation is delicate and dangerous; the room is atingle with sex
He turns his gaze toward the blanket
The view moves to the , remaining on it a moment
It is a frail barrier
The view then moves back to Peter, whose eyes are still on the blanket, his face expressionless
close view of , next shows that she, too, has her eyes glued on the blanket, a little fearfully
She turns her head and gazes at the ceiling for a moment
Then suddenly her eyes widenand she sits up abruptly
(seriously) Oh, by the waywhat's your name
(seen close; turning his head toward her) What's that
(both sides of the blanket coming into view) Who are you
Who, me
Why, 'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night
'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face
245
(interrupting) You've got a name, haven't you
Yeah
got a name
Peter Warne
Peter Warne
don't like it
Don't let it bother you
You're giving it back to me in the morning
(flopping back on her pillow as she mumbles) Pleased to meet you, Mr
Warne
The pleasure is all mine
There is silence between them for a few seconds
've been thinking about you
' Yes
You've had a pretty tough break at that
Twice a Missus and still unkissed
Ellie doesn't like the implication, and glares in his direction as Peter's voice continues: ' (meaningly) 'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you
(hard) Goodnight, Mr
Warne
(she turns over) Goodnight
He also turns his head toward the wall, and the scene fades out
Part Five long view of the , in the early morning, fades in
In the dim distance there is a speck, which, as it comes nearer, turns out to be an airplane
The drone of its motors becomes louder and louder
Then the view cuts to the of the  revealing (shouting to other) The old man's screwy
246
(who can't hear him) What's 'at
(louder) said, the old man's screwy
(nodding his head in agreement) Yeah
(cupping his mouth) The dame's too smart for him
(nodding again, then leaning over) How'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that
The First Pilot grimaces in disgust, grabs his nose between his fingers, and goes through the motion of ducking under water
And as they both laugh, the scene cuts to the  of the plane, a privately built plane which has all the equipment of a passenger ship
Andrews and one of his secretaries, a conservative-appearing man of middle age, lean over a table
This being a closed cabin, the roar of the motors scarcely interferes with the dialogue
Here's another wire, sir
This one's from Charleston
(as there is a close view of the two) "Checking every northbound train
Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways
No success yet
Will continue to do everything possible
" Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston
Any others
Yessir
(holding up stack of wires) There's a report here from every State along the East coast
Want to hear them
(impatiently) What do they say
They're practically all the same, sir
(he shrugs his shoulders to indicate there is no news) (muttering) Amateurs
They're the finest detective agency in the country, sir
247
Andrews doesn't answer him
He puffs furiously on his cigar, glances out of the window, and turns irritably to a phone by his side
He snaps up the receiver and presses a button, following which the scene cuts to the , where a light flashes on the instrument board, and the pilot picks up the receiver
Yes, sir
(seen in the cabin) thought  made it clear  was in a hurry to get to New York
(bellowing) What are we crawling for
In the control cockpit, the pilot reacts to the complaint and glances at his speed indicator
We then see the registering 180 miles an hour
The pilot looks aghast
(yelling into phone) We've got her wide open, sir
(irascibly) Well, step on it
Step on it
He bangs up the receiver and stares moodily out of the window
It is plain that he is worried
The view then includes his secretary, Henderson
hope she's all right, sir
(sharply) Of course she's all right
What do you think can happen
(intimidated) Nothing, sir
Then shut up about it
Thereupon the view cuts to a close-up of an airplane motor in rapid motion, and this dissolves to the next morning, a close view showing peacefully sleeping
But the drone of the plane overhead disturbs her, and she moves restlessly
(murmuring in her sleep) Darn planes She squirms around uncomfortably, and finding it impossible to resume her slumber, opens her eyes
The sun pouring in through the window causes her to squint
She sits up and stares outside, puzzled
Then remembering where she is she looks toward the other side of the cabin, listening for some sign of life
But there is none 248
and she relaxes
She falls back on the pillow, pulling the covers over her
Now  enters from the outside with an armful of foodstuffs, which he dumps on the table
He looks toward Ellie
Heyyou not up yet
Come oncome on
' What time is it
Eight o'clock
He goes to the blanket which hangs between the two cots and throws something over it to Ellie
Here (catching the package) What is it
(opening the package) Why, it's a toothbrush
Thanks
(noticing her dress hanging freshly pressed) Youyou had it pressed
(getting things ready for breakfast) Come on
Hurry up
Breakfast'll be ready in no time
Why, you sweet thing, you
Where'd you get it pressed
(at this the view moves with him and he goes to the blanket) Listen, BratI'm going to count to ten
If you're not out of bed by then 'm going to yank you out myself
close view of  shows her being stubborn, but alarmed
' (counting quickly) Onetwothreefourfive (panic-stricken) Why, you bully
believe you would
' sixseveneightnine (screaming) 'm out
'm out
249
And she jumps out of bed, throwing the cover around herself, following which Peter is seen going back to the table
You'll find the showersand thingsright back of the second cottage
(at this Ellie sticks her head over the blanket) (aghast) Outside
Certainly, outside
All the best homes have 'em outside
can't go out like this
Like what
Like this
have no robe
Heretake mine
He flings his robe over to her, and she disappears behind the blanket
But make it snappy
Now Ellie has got into his robe, and appears on his side
The robe is too large for her and she makes a comical figure
As she enters, she tries to maintain her customary dignity
(dignifiedly) Where'd you say the showersand thingswere
(Peter turns; when he sees her he laughs) (appraisingly) Heyyou're little, aren't you
Where is the shower
Your hair's cute like that
You should never comb it
(leaving haughtily) 'll find it myself
She slams the door viciously, but Peter rushes over to the window to watch her; and as viewed by him, Ellie appears next walking to the showers outside the cabin
She holds her head high and struggles valiantly to maintain as much dignity as she can muster under the circumstances
Then in the cabin, at the window, Peter watching Ellie, chuckles at her, shaking his head in amusement
He starts toward the table, and the scene cuts to a moving view outside 250
the cabins, with Ellie walking past several cottages on her way to the showers
Several people stop to stare at her until she reaches her destination
There are two wooden shacks adjoining, each having a sign on them; one reads, "ShowersMen"the other, "ShowersWomen
" In front of the women's shower there are several unappetizing-looking fat women waiting, and with them is a small girl
Ellie crosses over to the women's shower and disappears inside, the waiting women staring at her, puzzled
moment elapses and Ellie backs out, being pushed by a woman, part of whose naked body is visible, and whose voice is heard in protest: Can't a body have some privacy around here
The women who are waiting chuckle at Ellie's embarrassment as she stands aside
They certainly are making a monkey out of her decorum
The little girl keeps eyeing Ellie, fascinated
(pointing) Don't she look funny, Mama
Ellie, wheeling on the little girl, crushes her with a devastating look, so that the little girl cringes against her mother's skirt
Ellie goes to the end of the line to await her turn, following which close-ups show the slowly turning her head to look at Ellie, and  noticing the little girl staring at her, whereupon Ellie sticks her tongue out at her
And, in a scene which includes both, the little girl retaliates by sticking her tongue out also
This dissolves to a view of  coming out of the showers
At the same time Shapeley comes out of the men's shower, and upon seeing Ellie, his face lights up
Hello, sister
Ellie ignores him, and walks toward her cabin
But Shapeley falls into step with her
Sorry about last night
Didn't know you were married to that guy
Shoulda told me about it right off
(he chuckles) There  was, gettin' myself all primed for a killin', and you turn out to be an old married woman
The scene cuts to the door of ' as Peter comes out, stands in the doorway, and is surprised to see Ellie and Shapeley, who are then seen (from his angle) talking
Thereupon is seen again as his lip curls up a little jealously; he returns to the cabin, following which we again see Ellie and Shapeley walking
He notices the robe she is wearing, and he looks down toward her feet, the view moving down to show Ellie's legs and feet
The pajama legs are seen protruding below the robe, the cuffs of which she has turned up
Then the view moving back up to Ellie and Shapeley, he lifts her robe playfully
251
Hey, what's this
Wearing Papa's things
Now that's cute
That's what  call real lovey-dovey
Yessir
(stoppingher eyes blazing) If you don't get out of here, 'll slap that fresh mouth of yours
(startled) SorryI didn't mean to (sharply) Get out
Okay
was just trying to make conversation
Ellie leaves him abruptly, and the scene cuts to the , where Peter is now busy setting the small table
Ellie enters after a moment, while Peter has his back to the door
(without turning) High time you got back
met some very interesting women at the showers
We got to chatting about this and that
You know how time files
She disappears behind the blanket, following which we see Peter's side of the cabin, while Ellie's voice continues from behind the blanket
' We must come back to this place often
You meet the nicest people
Her head bobs up over the blanket now and again as she dresses
saw the little Pussinfoos girl
She's turned out quite a charming creature
Peter ignores her chatter, except for an annoyed glance once in a while
Very outspoken, too
Said  looked funny
Wasn't that cute
Hurry up and get dressed
(sticking her head over blanket) Why, Peter
Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends
252
If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummerwe'd have been through with breakfast by this time
close view shows  in the process of buttoning her dress
She looks up, having recognized a tinge of jealousy in his voice, which intrigues her
She starts to the other side of the blanket
Then we see her joining Peter in his part of the cabin
Well,  hope you're not going to dictate whom  can talk to
know a couple of truck drivers 'd like to have you meet sometime
(setting a plate for her) Come on, sit down
Thank you
(sitting down to the table; referring to the food) My, my
Scrambled eggs
Egg
One eggdoughnutsblack coffee
That's your ration till lunch
Any complaints
(cheerily) Nope
No complaints
'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint
("sweetly") Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr
Warne
You'll never know how much appreciate all this
(gruffly) What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning
Must be the Spring
thought maybeuh"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories
He apologized for last night
(carelessly) Said he didn't know we were married
253
(passing her a doughnut) Just shows you how wrong a guy can be
Doughnut
Thanks
(embarrassed) You think this whole business is silly, don't you
mean running away and everything
(easily) No
No
It's too good a story
Yes, you do
You think 'm a fool and a spoiled brat
Perhaps  am, although don't see how  can be
People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way
never have
On the contrary, 've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom
Would you believe it
This is the first time 've ever been alone with a man
Yeah
It's a wonder 'm not panic stricken
Um
You're doing all right
Thanks
Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards
Oh, it's been a lot of fun
One consolation; you can never be lonesome
It has its moments
It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives
did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard
It was swell
felt absolutely immoral
But it didn't last long
They caught up with me in a department store
was so mad  ran out the back way and jumped into the first car  saw
Guess who was in it
Santa Claus
KingKing Westley was in it
Oh
Is that how you met him
254
Um-hm
We rode around all afternoon
Father was frantic
By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged
(she has been "dunking" her doughnut throughout this, Peter watching her) Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school
(indignantly) Aw, now, don't you start telling me shouldn't dunk
Of course you shouldn't
You don't know how to do it
Dunking's an art
Don't let it soak so long
dip and plop, into your mouth
If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off
It's all a matter of timing
ought to write a book about it
Thanks, professor
Just goes to show you
Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk
'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day
But before he can answer, they are interrupted by voices directly outside their window, and the view moves with Peter as he goes to the door, which he opens slightly
Thereupon Dyke is seen in conversation with two men outside the
(protesting loudly) You can't go around bothering my tenants
tell you, there's no girl by that name here
Besides, how do  know you're detectives
Show him your credentials, Mac
'll look around
At this, Peter closes the door and turns to Ellie
Detectives
(petrified) That's Father at work, What'll  do
(appealingly, to him) Peter, what'll  do
Don't look at me
didn't marry King Westley
255
Ellie runs around the room picking up her stuff and murmuring, "Oh, my goodness
" She reaches the window
(now seen close, at the window) Maybe  could jump out of the window
(tremulously) Do you think they'd see me
' (suddenly) Come here, you little fool
She starts toward him
We then see him plunking her in a chair: Sit down
He rumples her hair and sticks a few hairpins in her mouth
He now stands aside and deliberately talks loud enough to be heard outside
(practically shouting) Yeah
got a letter from Aunt Betty
She says if we don't stop over at Wilkes-Barre she'll never forgive us
(a close-up showing her staring at him in bewilderment) What are you talking about
At this, Peter rushes over to her and clamps his hand over her mouth
(with his hand over her mouth) The baby is due next monthand they want us to come
Ellie looks up at him, and realizes what he's doing, she nods to him that it's all right, whereupon he removes his hand from her mouth
And now one of the detectives approaches the of the cabin
When he hears Peter's voice, he stops to listen
' She says she saw your sister Ethel the other day, and she's looking swell
The detective knocks on the door
At this we again see inside of the cabin as Peter whispers to Ellie to say "Come in
" (calling) Come in
The moment she does, Peter rushes behind the hanging blanket
He has his head stuck over it, waiting for the detective to enter, and the moment the door opens Peter ducks
The detective takes a step inside the room
256
' (from behind blanket) hope Aunt Betty has a boy, don't you
She's always wanted a boy
think we'll stop over in Wilkes-Barre this trip, darling
Give the family a treat
close view shows Ellie and the detective
They have been staring at each other
(very sweet, calling to Peter) There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart
' Whome
(appearing from behind the blankets; pleasantly) Want to see me
(who hasn't taken his eyes off Ellie) What's your name
(innocently) Are you addressing me
Yeah
What's your name
(stepping in front of him) Hey, wait a minute
You're talking to my wife
You can't walk in here andwhat do you want, anyway
We're looking for somebody
Well, look your head offbut don't come bustin' in here
This isn't a public park
While Peter has been speaking, the second detective and Dyke have entered
They walk over to Peter, the First Detective, and Ellie
got a good mind to sock you right in the nose
Take it easy, son
Take it easy
(crowding forward) What's up
The Second Detective's eyes fall on Ellie and he stops to stare at her suspiciously
He takes a photograph out of his pocket which he inspects
(explains) These men are detectives, Mr
Warne
257
(shouting) wouldn't care if they were the whole police department
They can't come in here and start shooting questions at my wife
(appearing very domestic) Don't get excited, Peter
They just asked a civil question
(turning on her; very sarcastic) There you go again
How many times did tell you to stop butting in when have an argument
(sharply; entering into the spirit of the pretense) Well, you don't have to lose your temper
(mimicking her) You don't have to lose your temper
(in his own voice) That's what you told me the last time too
Every time  step in to protect you
At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you He didn't make a pass at me
told you a million times
The two detectives and Dyke are seen watching the other two, who are now out of sight
' (screaming) Oh, no
saw him
He kept pawing you all over the dance floor
' He didn't
You were drunk
(now seen with Ellie) Oh, so now  was drunk
Well, you were
'm sorry  didn't take another sock at him
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested
Aw, nuts
You're just like your old man
Once a plumber always a plumber
There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family
258
(starting to cry) Peter Warne, you've gone far enough
won't stand being insulted like this another minute
Ellie goes over to her cot, and starts picking up her hat and things, whereupon Dyke, very much affected, turns to the detectives
Now look what you've done
(apologetically) Sorry, Mr
Warne
But you see, we're supposed to check up on everybody
We're looking for a girl by the name of Ellen Andrews
You knowthe daughter of the big Wall Street mug
close-up of  appears as their voices are heard
' Your wife sure looks like her
Don't she, Mac
' She sure does
(the entire group coming into view) Well,  hope you find her
(to Ellie) Quit bawling
Quit bawling
The detectives start out, accompanied by Dyke, who is still concerned about the disturbing of his tenants
As they disappear out the door, we hear Dyke's voice: ' told you they were a perfectly nice married couple
Their voices die
Peter stands in the middle of the room watching them go
From her side, where she has been stalling, Ellie peers out of the window until the detectives vanish
She starts toward Peter
Then they appear together, both staring out until the detectives are well out of sight
Finally, Peter closes the door and turns to her
(seriously) It'll be a dirty trick on Aunt Betty if it turns out to be a girl after all
This brings laughter from them both
But Peter suddenly sobers, and he looks at her thoughtfully
259
Say, you were pretty good
Jumping in like that
Got a brain, haven't you
You weren't so bad yourself
We could start a two-person stock company
If things get toughwe can play some small town auditoriums
We'll call this one "The Great Deception
"[8] Next week "East Lynne
" After that "The Three Musketeers
" (he strikes a pose) 'd make a great 'Artagnan
How about Cinderellaor a real hot love story
No mushy stuff
'm running this troupe
(fighting) Oh, you are
Who made you the manager
did
It was my idea, wasn't it
You always want to run everything
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company
refuse to resign
Then 'll fire you
'll do all the parts myself
They are interrupted by the door being flung open
Dyke sticks his head in the door
Your bus leaves in five minutes
Holy jumping
We haven't started to pack yet
And they both scurry around, throwing things carelessly into Peter's suitcase, as the scene fades out
Part Six '  fades in, and Gordon is at his desk as his secretary enters
260
Here's another wire from Peter Warne
Throw it in the basket
(as the secretary starts to do so) What's it say
(reading) "Have  got a story
It's getting hotter and hotter
Hope you're the same
" Gordon snatches the wire out of her hand and tears it viciously into bits
Collect
Yes
Don't accept any more
The scene dissolves to ' OFFICEa richly appointed place, awe-inspiring in its dignified furnishings, which shriek of wealth
Andrews paces back and forth in back of his desk
Sitting before him is a man of fifty, with very rugged features
He is Lovington, head of the detective agency bearing his name
When the scene opens, Andrews is holding forth: Three days
Three whole days
And what have you accomplished
(in a close view at the desk) All you've shown me is a stack of feeble reports from those comical detectives of yours
want action, Lovington
We can't do the impossible, Mr
Andrews
What 'm asking isn't impossible
My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami
want her found
've put extra men on, all along the way
It's not enough
(suddenly) Are you certain she's not with King Westley
No
He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started
He can't even get a phone call we don't know about
261
(who has been pressing several buttons on his desk) 'm worried, Lovington
After all, something might have happened to her
(he is interrupted by the entrance of several employees) Yessir
(seeing them) Oh, Clarkwant you to arrange for a radio broadcastright awaycoast to coast hook-up
Offer a reward of ten thousand dollars for any information leading to her whereabouts
(leaving) Yessir
Brown Yessir
Send the story out to the newspapers
(he rips a picture of Ellie on the desk out of its frame) Some of the out of town papers may not have a picture of her
Herewire this to themI want it to break right away
As he hands the picture to Brown, the view moves in to a close-up of the which dissolves to a close-up of the same picture in a newspaper, and as the view draws slowly back we see the headline over it, which reads " " The view then draws back to reveal reading the newspaper
He stares long and absorbedly at the picture
Then slowly he turns his head toward the rear of the bus, and the view following his gaze passes a group of men singing "The Man On the Flying Trapeze
" They are huddled together, and accompanied by a man who plays a guitar
Then the view continues moving until it reaches Peter and Ellie who join in the song, and a close-up of  shows her eyes sparkling as she sings gaily
looks back at Ellie, and apparently comes to the conclusion that his suspicions are correct, for he quickly folds the newspaper, casting a surreptitious glance around to make certain he is not being watched
diabolical smirk spreads over his face
full view of the interior of the bus shows most of the occupants joining in the fun, singing
They seem unmindful of the discomfiture caused by the rocking of the bus, which throws them against each other
Then the view draws in to a front seat in which sit a woman and a small boy of ten
The woman's face is haggard and she sways 262
uncertainly, her eyes half closed
Her small son's frightened face peers up at her
(in a trembling voice) What'sa matter, Ma
Don't you feel all right
The woman struggles valiantly to recover her composure
She presses her son's small hand in a feeble effort at assurance
close view of Ellie and Peter shows singing more boisterously than the rest, doing the comical song with exaggerated gestures
But suddenly her face clouds, at something she sees
(touching Peter's arm) Peter
(as he turns) There's something the matter with that woman
She looks ill
Peter follows her gaze, whereupon we see the
Her head rolls weakly, a pained expression on her face
(again seen with Peter; sympathetically) better go over and see her
Don't be silly
Nothing you can do
Must be tough on an old womana trip like this
(worried) Yes
We see the other passengers around Ellie and Peter enjoying themselves
One of them pokes her
Hey, Galli-Curci,[9] come onget onto it
(poking Peter) You, too, McCormack
Ellie and Peter snap into it; they are just in time for the long wail which precedes the chorus: (singing) "-o-o-ohHe flies through the air with the greatest of ease This daring young man on the flying trapeze" At this the scene cuts to the
The bus is caught in a muddy road, full of ruts, and at the moment wavers dangerously at an angle
The left front wheel is stuck in a deep hole, and the engine roars and clatters as the driver feeds the gas
Finally the bus moves forward, extricating the wheel; but just as it does, the right front wheel falls into another mud hole on the other side, and this time the bus seems hopelessly stuck, a close-up of the showing it revolving desperately, but in vain
The mud splashes in all directions, and the wheel seems to sink deeper and deeper
Thereupon this view cuts to the inside of the
The bus 263
is tilted over at an extreme angle, which has thrown Ellie into a corner on the floor, where she now crouches in an undignified position
She looks like a turtle, her head being invisible
(sticking her head out) Thank the man for me, Peter
This is the first comfortable position 've had all night
Peter, amused, is assisting her to her feet
The guitarist has continued his playing uninterrupted, and as Peter lifts Ellie, he sings: (singing) "She flies through the air with the greatest of ease
This darin' young maid on the flying trapeze (grunting) Her movements are gracefulall men does she please" close view of the  and the now shows the latter terrifiedly watching his mother, whose head sags wearily
Finally she topples forward in a swoon
(with a moan) Ma
Ma
What'sa matter with you
(tears stream down his cheeks) Somebody help me
Somethin's happened to her
The music stops abruptly
Everyone looks up, startled
Ellie starts forward, followed by Peter
Passengers closely group around the woman and chatter
"She's fainted
Look how pale she is
" Peter and Ellie step up
Get some water, somebody
(to the boy) Let me get in here, son
Ellie goes out of sight to get water
The boy cries audibly, terror-stricken, but gets out of Peter's way, and Peter lifts the woman up and stretches her across the seat
Ellie comes back with water which she silently hands to Peter, who administers to the woman and when she slowly opens her eyes, makes her drink the water
The woman looks around, bewildered
(consolingly) That's better
You're all right now
Just took a little nose-dive, that's all
He assists her in sitting up
The boy's wailing is heard, and he now rushes over and throws his arms around his mother
(crying) Maoh, gee, Ma
264
His mother clings to him, but still feeling faint, her head sways
Peter looks up at Ellie and gives her a sign to sit down beside the woman sits down beside her
Peter takes the boy by the shoulders
Come on, son
Better give your mother a chance to snap out of it
(as the boy emits a heart-breaking sob) It's all right, son
She'll be okay in a couple of minutes
He leads the boy away, while Ellie places her arm around the woman
You'd better rest
It's been a hard trip, hasn't it
The scene cuts to a close view of who has his eye peeled on Peter, watching him, and we next see Peter and the boy, who is still sobbing quietly
They are now standing away from the other passengers
We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday
What happened to your money
Ma spent it all for the tickets
She didn't know it was gonna be so much
(with a new outburst) We shouldn'a come,  guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New Yorkand if we didn't go, she might lose it
Going without food is bad business, son
Why didn't you ask somebody
was gonna do it, but Ma wouldn't let me
She was ashamed,  guess
Peter reaches into his pocket for a bill, just as Ellie approaches them
She'll be all right, soon's she gets something to eat
Peter has extracted a single bill and dips in his pocket for a smaller one
Before he can find anything, however, Ellie takes the one he has in his hand and gives it to the boy
Here, boyfirst town we come to, buy some food
265
(Peter glances at the empty hand and then at Ellie) shouldn't oughta take this
Ma'll be angry
(confidentially) Just don't tell her anything about it
You don't want her to get sick again, do you
(a sob in his voice) No-o
But  shouldn't oughta take the money
(to Peter) You might need it
Me
Forget it, son
(rumples his hairsmiling) got millions
(also smiling) Thanks
(her arm around the boy) Come on
Let's go back to your mother
She leaves with the boy, Peter watching her a moment, impressed by her display of humanness, before turning and leaving the scene, following which a close-up shot of  watching Peter, then also rising and starting out
On the , the driver is now standing in front of the mud-hole, staring at the sunken wheel dolefully, as several people stray into the scene
That storm sure made a mess outa these roads
(appearing, and seeing the trouble) Holy Smokes
You'll never get out yourself
Better phone for some help
Phone for help
(unhappily) We're right in the middle of nowhere
There isn't a town within ten miles of here
Shapeley is just entering the outskirts of the group
He stops, looks in the direction of Peter speculatively
He has the newspaper stuck in his pocket, which he caresses tenderly
The scene expanding, Peter is then seen leaving the group
(as Peter approaches) What's up
266
Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time
(he starts away) (calling to him) Say, Buddy Peter turns, and looks at him quizzically, and the two are then seen close together
Like to have a look at my paper
He has taken it out and has it opened as he hands it to Peter
The headlines concerning Ellie and her picture shriek out at Peter
This startles him for a moment, but he manages to recover his poise
Travelin' like this, you kinda lose track of what's goin' on in the world
(guardedly) Thanks
(he glances from the newspaper to Shapeley, wondering how much he suspects) If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what  always say
(eyeing him expectantly) That's right
(pointing to paper) Take that story there, for instance
Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers
(non-committally) Yeahwouldn't it
It's a lotta dough
If  was to run across that dame, you know what 'd do
What
'd go fifty-fifty with you
Why
267
Cause 'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see
bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what  always say
What's on your mind
(hard) Five 'sor  crab the works
You're a pretty shrewd baby
(looking around) We better get away from this gang
Talk this thing over privately
And the view moves with them as Peter leads the way toward a clump of bushes off the side of the road, Shapeley following
They are concealed from the rest of the passengers
Lucky thing, my running into you
Just the man  need
(smiling broadly) You're not making any mistake, believe you me
can use a smart guy like you
(expansively) Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to (suddenly) Do you pack a gat
[11] close view of the  shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face
He looks up quickly
Huh
gat
gat
(feeling him) Got any fireworks on you
(weakly) Whyno (carelessly) That's all right
got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase
'll let you have one of them
268
(Shapeley is beginning to realize he is in for something he hadn't bargained for, and stares speechlessly at Peter, who continues blandly) Expect a little trouble up North
May have to shoot it out with cops
The perspiration starts appearing on Shapeley's brow (as we see him in a close-up)
Peter's voice continues: ' (with emphasis) If you come through all right, your five 's are in the bag
Maybe more
'll talk to the "Killer"see that he takes care of you
(finally finding his voice) The Killer
(seen with Shapeley; watching the latter to gauge the effect of his words) Yeahthe "big boy"the Boss of the outfit
(shakily) You're not kidnapping her, are you
(tough) What else, stupid
You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you
(contemptuously) Ten thousand bucks
Chicken feed
We're holding her for a million smackers
(stammering) Say, look
didn't know it was anything like this, seeand What's the matter with you
Gettin' yellow
(raising his voice, pleadingly) But 'm a married man
got a couple of kids
can't get mixed up with (gripping his arm) Sh-sh-sh
Soft pedal, you mug
before What're you trying to do
Tell the whole world about it
(low and menacingly) Now listen, you're in this thingand you're staying in
Get me
You know too much
(frightened out of his wits) won't say anything
Honest,  won't
269
Yeah
How do  know
(he reaches into his coat threateningly) gotta good mind to plug you
(arguing with himself) shouldn't take any chances on you
(breaking down) You can trust me, Mister
'll keep my mouth shut
Yeah
(he glares at Shapeley a moment silently, as if making up his mind) What's your name
Oscar Shapeley
Where do you live
Orange, New Jersey
Got a couple of kids, huh
Yeah
Just babies
You love them, don't you
(sensing the threat; horrified) Oh, gee, Misteryou wouldn'tyou ain't thinkin' about (threateningly) You'll keep your trap shut, all right
(quickly) SuresureI'll keep my trap shut
you can depend on me, Mister
If you don'tEver hear of Bugs Dooley
No
Nice guy
Just like you
But he made a big mistake, one day
Got kind of talkative
Know what happened
His kid was found in the bottom of the 270
river
rock tied around its neck
Poor Bugs
He couldn't take it
Blew his brains out
(Shapeley can't stand much more of this
He is ready to keel over) Gee
That musta been terrible
(righteously) guess he had it coming to him though
But don't you worry about me
don't talk
never talk
Take my word for it
Gee,  wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids
Okay
Just remember that
Now beat it
(grabbing Peter's hand and shaking it gratefully) Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister
always knew you guys were kind-hearted
(putting his hand away) Come on, scram
And stay away from that bus
Sure
Anything you say
As he says this, he backs away from Peter, following which a close-up of shows a twinkle in his eye and then, as seen by Peter, Shapeley appears walking hurriedly away
When he thinks the distance is safe he starts running
He slips and falls in the mud, picks himself up, and continues his race for life
The scene dissolves to the , at night, with Ellie and Peter walking along
It is apparent they have been trudging like this for a long time
Poor old Shapeley
You shouldn't have frightened him like that
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time
The exercise is good for him
Yes,  noticed he was getting a little fat lately
(she grabs her side) Ouch
What's the matter
(grimacing) was never built for these moonlight strolls
(protesting) Why did we have to leave the bus
271
don't trust that chatterbox
The scene dissolves to the banks of a narrow  at night
Peter is bending over, removing his shoes, and we see the two closer as they talk
First town we hit in the morning, you better wire your father
Not as long as 'm alive
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet
What do you meanstarvation
It takes money to buy food
Why, haven't you
(interrupting) Not a sou
had some before the fainting scene
You didn't give that boy all your money
didn't give him anything
You were the big-hearted gal
How about wiring your father now
Never
'll get to New York if  have to starve all the way
(risinguttering a deep sigh) Must be some strange power Westley has over you women
(he now has his shoes off and ties them to each other) How do you expect to get there
To New York
Yeah
'm following you
Aren't you afraid of me
272
(confidently) No
(looking at her) Okay
Hang on to these
As he bends down in front of Ellie, he gets a firm grip around her legs and throws her over his shoulder like a sack
She squeals, terrified, but Peter ignores this; and with his right hand, which is free, he lifts the suitcase and starts walking across the stream
Ellie's first fright is gone and she now rather enjoys the sensation of being carried by Peter
She lets herself go completely limp, still clinging to his shoes, which she carries by the string
As they walk, the dangling shoes keep hitting Peter's backside
wish you'd stop being playful
(thereupon holding the shoes out at a safe distance) Sorry
(Peter takes several more laborious steps before either of them speaks) It's the first time 've ridden "piggy-back" in years
This isn't "piggy-back
" Of course it is
You're crazy
(after a silence for several seconds) remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride And he carried you like this,  suppose
Yes
(with finality) Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding
(another silence before she speaks again) My uncleMother's brotherhad four children and 've seen them ride "piggy-back
" 273
don't think there's a "piggy-back" rider in your whole family
never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider
That's silly
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxationa warm heartand a loving nature
And rich people have none of those qualifications, suppose
Not a one
You're prejudiced
Show me a good "piggy-back" rider and 'll show you somebody that's human
Take Abraham Lincoln, for instancea natural "piggy-backer
" (contemptuously) Where do you get off with your stuffed-shirt family
(turning) Why, your father knew so much about "piggy-back" riding that he In his excitement he wheels around to speak to her, forgetting that as he turns she goes with him
Not finding her at his right, he swings around to his left
Naturally he takes Ellie with himand realizing his mistake he mutters: Aw, nuts
He proceeds on his way, walking faster than before
They continue this way silently for some time
Finally Ellie breaks the silence
(persistently) My father was a great "piggy-backer
" Peter raises his eyes heavenward in thorough disgust, then calmly hands his suitcase to her
Hold this a minute
Ellie takes the suitcase from him, and his hand now free, he delivers a resounding smack on her backside, so that Ellie lets out a yelp
(taking the suitcase) Thank you
274
The scene dissolves to the edge of a cow , at night, and Ellie and Peter are revealed climbing under a barbed wire fence, following which the scene dissolves to a , in front
Peter sets his bag down and surveys the layout, Ellie watching him
(to himself) This looks like the best spot
We're not going to sleep out here, are we
don't know about you, but 'm going to give a fairly good imitation of it
And he busies himself laying out a bed for her, pulling hay from the stack and spreading it out on the ground
Ellie wanders aim-lessly and then moves to a rock, where she sits and watches Peter
(after a pause; coyly) Peter (as a close view shows him still arranging her bed; grumbling) What
' 'm hungry
(without looking up) Just your imagination
(seen at the rock, while Peter is out of sight) No, it isn't
'm hungry andand scared
' You can't be hungry and scared at the same time
(insisting) Well,  am
(as both he and Ellie are seen in their respective places) If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you
(argumentatively) Not if you're more hungry than scared
(impatiently) All right
You win
Let's forget it
275
(after a pause) can't forget it
'm still hungry
(tearing his hair; screaming) Holy Smokes
Why did  ever get mixed up with you
This brings silence, and he goes on building a bed for her
Then a close-up of Ellie shows her watching him
Her eyes soften
very definite interest in him is slowly but surely blossoming, and the fact that he is making her bed adds to the intimacy of the scene close view of  shows him concentrating on his task, but he pauses a moment and turns to glance at her
It is a devouring look, which he quickly dispels by working more feverishly on her bed
(muttering while he works) If  had any sense, 'd have been in New York by this time
(he emphasizes his feelings by yanking viciously at the hay as both of them are now seen) Taking a married woman back to her husband
Hunh
What a prize sucker  turned out to be
(He has her bed ready; without glancing at her) Come onyour bed's all ready
She, watches him a moment, then rising slowly, starts toward Peter
Then she stands over her bed, surveying it speculatively
'll get my clothes all wrinkled
(sharply) Well, take them off
(shocked) What
(shouting) All right
Don't take them off
Do whatever you please
But shut up about it
She flashes him a petulant, offended glance but it is lost on Peter, who has his back to her, and meticulously, she slips to her knees and proceeds to stretch out on the hay
The hay bed is bumpy and hard and she has quite a difficult time getting comfortable; her efforts to do so are accompanied by painful sighs
close view shows stopping to watch her, and his look is sympathetic and solicitous
Then while Ellie groans and sighs and pounds the hay with her palm, Peter steps out of sight
Ellie is unaware of his departure, so busily occupied is she with her makeshift bedding
She squirms around unhappily and finally stretches out, deciding to make the best of it
She lies on her back, her hands clasped under her head, looking up at the stars
(seen close, as she is lying back on hay bed) You're becoming terribly disagreeable lately
Snap my head off every time open my mouth
276
(she waits for a reply, but receives none) If being with me is so distasteful to you, you can leave
(independently) You can leave any time you see fit
Nobody's keeping you her
(martyr-like) can get along
She waits a second and then turns to see what effect this has on him
The fact that Peter is gone doesn't quite register at first
She looks around calmly, then is puzzled, and finally she becomes panicky
She sits up with a start
(murmuring, frightened) Peter (there is a pause while she listens, but nothing stirs, and there is more apprehension in her voice) Peter
Real terror comes into her face, and she is ready to cry
She gets to her feet
(with a terrified outcry) Peter
At this he comes running into the scene; under his arm he has a watermelon
What's the matter
(relieved) Oh, Peter (she throws her arms around his neck and sobs freely) (hoarsely) What's got into you
(clinging to him) Oh, Peter
was so scared
With his free hand he removes her arm from around his neck and starts away
(setting the watermelon down) wasn't gone more than a minute
Just went out to find you something to eat
(a sob still in her voice) knowbut 277
(kicking the melon over to her) Here
Eat your head off
don't want it now
(vehemently) Thought you were hungry
wasbut But what
was so scaredthat it scared (exasperatedly) Holy Jumping Catfish
You can drive a guy crazy
He kicks the melon viciously out of sight, and without any particular preparation or fuss, he flops down on his bed, following which Ellie goes to her bed and lies down, too
Then a close view of appears, and at the moment she looks far removed from the spoiled, pampered, self-reliant brat of Alexander Andrews
Instead, she is a helpless baby, clinging to Peter's protective wing
She'd be ever so grateful right now for a little civility on his part, for a little tenderness and understanding, and she glances over at him, hopefully
, however, stares up at the stars, dreamily; and we then see  turning away from him, disappointed
Still, the minute Ellie turns her head, Peter looks at her out of the corner of his eye, and it's a long and steady gaze
Then suddenly he gets an idea and rises
He finds his topcoat and goes to her
Might get chilly later on
(he spreads it over her) Better use this
As he bends down to tuck her in, their faces are seen in close proximity
Ellie, tremulous and fearful, has her eyes peeled on him
The situation is imminent with danger; anything is likely to happen at this moment; and she is frightened and expectantshe knows how weak she would be, if he suddenly crushed her in his arms
Peter avoids her gaze
He, too, is a bit shaky
The temptation is there and his resistance is waning
He tucks her in and quickly turns away
Ellie's eyes, however, never leave him
Immediate danger has vanished, and it leaves her a little regretful
close view of , as he walks over to a rock and sits down, shows him nervously taking out a cigarette and lighting it
You've had a lot of men crazy about you, haven't you
doesn't respond
She has the scrutinizing, speculative look of a girl who feels herself falling in love with someone who is practically a stranger to her, as a result of which she is 278
frightened
Then a wider view includes both of them and we see that Peter, too, fights valiantly against a mounting interest in this girl, who epitomizes everything he dislikes
He creates the impression in the following scene that in his analysis of her he is trying to dissuade himself from something he is bound to regret
His attack on her, consequently, is overly vicious
guess you've pretty much had your own way with them
That's your trouble mostly
You've always had your own way
That's why you're such a mess now
He pauses a second, waiting for a protest, but Ellie offers none; she is too much absorbed in her own confusing emotions
close view then shows  taking a long puff on his cigarette and exhaling the smoke, watching it vanish before he speaks
(suddenly) You know what generally happens to people like you
You get your values all mixed up
You attach all the importance to the wrong things
Right now, for instance, there's only one thought in your mindto get back to king Westley
He waits for a reaction, but a close view shows  absorbed, and she remains silent
Peter's voice continues
' Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all
In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit (now seen with her) People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round
guess that's what makes you so dizzy
(he rises and paces a few moments) You're always chasing after something
At least you think you are
Truth is, you're just running away
(emphatically) From yourself, mostly
'Cause you're miserable
You hate yourself
The world's full of people like you
Don't know what they want
Do you know
Sure
What
(flatly) Nothing
(after a pause) Nothing you'd give two cents for
279
(seen close) Try me
' just want to be let alone, that's all
Life's swell if you don't try too hard
Most people want to get a strangle-hold on it
They're not living
They're just feverish
(now appearing with her) If they didn't get themselves all balled up with a lot of manufactured values, they'd find what they want
Peace and calm
When you get right down to it, what's all the shootin' for, will you tell me
After all, you can only eat three meals a day, only sleep in one bed (looking up) Right now, that hay feels pretty good to you, doesn't it
Sure it does
'Cause you were tiredand it's the only thing around
You sound like a hobo
am
only work when  have to
Two years ago  got a notion and went to China
There was a war going on
Swell
After a while it got stale
went down to Tahiti
Just lay on the beach for six months
What could be sweeter
Doesn't sound very exciting
, seen close, looks at her for a long time before speaking: guess not
'd have given odds it wouldn't mean anything to you
(he goes over and flops down on his own side of hay) There were moments when  had hopes
When Iaw, 'm wasting timeYou're destined to be a dope the rest of your life
(contemptuously) pity you
Goodnight
He turns over with a finality that precludes any further discussion, following which a close-up of  reveals that her eyes are wide open, staring thoughtfully up at the sky
The scene fades out slowly
Part Seven fades in
It is day now, and Peter and Ellie are trundling along
Ellie limps, and wears an unhappy expression on her face
What are you thinking about
By a strange coincidence,  was thinking of you
280
(pleased) Really
Yeah
was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing
Hitch-hiking
Well, you've given me a very good example of the hiking (strongly) where does the hitching come in
(amused at her) little early yet
No cars out yet
She spies a rock and heads for it
Then we see her seated on the rock
If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come
(Peter comes over, sets his bag down, and prepares to wait) Got a toothpick
No
But 've got a penknife
(he extracts one from his pocket which he snaps open) Hayin my teeth
She points to her front teeth, and Peter flicks the hay out of her teeth
There it is
Better swallow it
We're not going to have any breakfast
Needn't rub it in
(Peter takes a carrot out of his coat pocket and starts nibbling on it; Ellie looks up at this) What're you eating
Carrots
Raw
Uh-huh
Want one
281
(emphatically) No
(as Peter smacks his lips with satisfaction) It's a wonder you couldn't get me something can eat
You don't think 'm going around panhandling for you
(he takes a bite) Best thing in the world for youcarrots
Had a tough time getting them
If that farmer ever caught megoodnight
hate the horrid stuff
While she speaks a car roars by at terrific speed
Peter and Ellie both jump up
wish you wouldn't talk too much
We let a car get away
(Ellie goes back to her rock, despondently) What if nobody stops for us
Oh, they'll stop, all right
It's a matter of knowing how to hail them
You're an expert,  suppose
Expert
Going to write a book on it
Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail
" There's no end to your accomplishments
You think it's simple, huh
(exaggeratedly) Oh, no
Well, it is simple
It's all in the thumb, see
lot of people do it (waving) like this
(he shakes his head sadly) But they're all wrong
Never get anywhere
Tch
Tch
'm sorry for the poor things
282
But the thumb always works
Different ways to do it, though
Depends on how you feel
For instance, number one is a short, jerky movement (he demonstrates) That shows independence
You don't care if they stop or not
'Cause you got some money in your pocket, see
Clever
Number two is a wider movementa smile goes with that onelike this
(he demonstrates) That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter
[12] You figured that all out yourself, huh
Oh, that's nothing
Now take number three, for instance
That's a pip
It's the pathetic one
When you're brokeand hungryand everything looks black
It's a long movement like this (demonstrating) with a follow through
Amazing
Hm
Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it
In the distance a car is heard approaching, and Ellie looks up quickly
(excitedly) Here comes a car
(alert) Now watch me
'm going to use Number One
Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens
Peter steps forward into the road and does his thumb movement
The car approaches, but speeds right by, spreading a cloud of dust in Peter's face, leaving him staring at the departing car, nonplussed
Thereupon  (seen close) glances up at him, a satirical expression on her face
(sarcastically) 'm still watching your thumb
Peter is still looking after the car
283
Something must have gone wrong
guess 'll try number two
When you get up to a hundred, wake me up
Another car is heard coming, and Peter steps forward, prepared to hail it
Then this dissolves to a long view of the  as a stream of cars of every description speeds forward ("toward the camera") and vanishes
The view moving in to the side of the road, Peter is seen still in the same spot
He waves his arms, jerks his thumb, indulges in all sorts of gyrations, while Ellie remains slumped on her rock, completely worn out
Now Ellie watches Peter out of the corner of her eye, her face expressionless
Peter continues his arm wavingbut slows down like a mechanical toy which has run out
He finally gets down to just thumbing his nose at the passing vehicles; and then thoroughly wearied, he flops down on a rock near Ellie
guess maybe  won't write that book after all
Yes
But look at all the fun you had
(as he glares at her) Mind if  try
(contemptuously) You
Don't make me laugh
You're such a smart aleck
Nobody can do anything but you
'll show you how to stop a carand  won't use my thumb
The scene widens as she rises and steps forward
What're you going to do
Mind your own business
She lifts her skirt to above her knees and pretends to be fixing her garter
Her very attractive leg is in full display
Almost instantly, we hear the screaming and grinding of quickly applied brakes, and Peter looks up astonished
The scene wiping off, we then get a closer view of Ellie and Peter sitting in the back of an open Ford
It is a broken-down, rickety affair of the 1920 vintage
Ellie grins victoriously up at Peter, who stares ahead of him, glumly
You might give me a little credit
What for
284
proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb
Why didn't you take all your clothes off
You could have stopped forty cars
We don't need forty cars
Peter glares at her, and Ellie's eyes twinkle mischievously, following which we get a wider view which includes the driver of the car, Danker
He is a man of about thirty, a heavy set, loose chinned person; at the moment he is singing an aria from some opera
He suddenly stops, turning to Ellie and Peter in the back seat
So you've just been married, huh
Well, that's pretty good
If  was young, that's just the way 'd spend my honeymoonhitch-hiking
-e-s s-i-r
And for no reason except that he cued himself into it, he bursts forth into song gustily
(singing) "Hiking down the highway of love on a honeymoon
Hitch-hiking down Down-down-down the highway Down
" Ellie and Peter in the back of the car react to the noise Danker makes
Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil
Tonsil
Me
No
Me burn a tonsil
(singing) "My tonsils won't burn As life's corners
(giving up) All right, let it go
(completing his last line) turn
" The scene dissolves to the front of a   on a deserted road, and Danker's car drives into the scene and stops
Then we see Danker turning to Ellie and Peter
How about a bite to eat
285
(quickly) Why,  think that would be (stopping her) No, thanks
We're not hungry
(sentimentally) Oh,  see, young people in love are never hungry
No
(singing as he leaves them) "Young people in love Are very seldom hungry
People in love Are very seldom hungry
" When he is out of sight, Peter glares at Ellie
What were you going to do
Gold dig him for a meal
[13] (defiantly) Why not
'm hungry
Eat a carrot
Never
(she starts out of car) 'm going in and ask him (grabbing her arm) If you do, 'll break your neck
She looks up at his glowering face, realizes he means it, and wilts under his dominant gaze
Let's get out and stretch our legs
Peter gets out, followed by Ellie, and they walk away from the car
Both are silent
At the  of the  , then, Danker comes out and looks around furtively
Ellie and Peter, as seen by him, appear, walking away, following which the view moves over to the Ford and drops down to a close-up of Peter's suitcase
Now Danker looks about quickly and starts toward his car
He springs into the car, steps on the starter, and is off
and  hear the motor
They wheel around, and their eyes widen in surprise
286
Hey
He flings his coat at Ellie and dashes after the Ford
He is then seen running after it when the car turns around a bend in the road
Peter continues the pursuit
This scene wiping off, the now makes its appearance around the bend, and as it approaches, Peter is seen at the wheel
He looks like he's just been through a fight
And as Peter rides in, Ellie comes running toward him
(a note of great relief in her voice) Oh, Peter
What happened
Are you all right
Come onget in
(noticing a gash in his cheek) Oh, you've been hurt
There's a cut on (impatiently) Come on
come on
(at this she runs around to get in the other side) (as she runs) What happened
(as we see them closer) Just a road thief
Picks people up and runs off with their stuff
What a racket
(by this time she is in the car) What'd you give him for the car
black eye
(thereupon the car moves out of sight) close view shows Peter and Ellie driving along in the Ford
Peter looks ahead, uncommunicatively
Ellie glances up at him, and it is plain that something's on her mind
(a little self-consciously) Lookuhhow are theuhcarrots holding out
Any left
Peter glances at her
He knows what a concession this is on her part, and he smiles sympathetically
(tenderly) You don't have to eat the carrots
(as she looks her surprise) Just passed a pond with some ducks in it
(with a cry of joy) Darling
287
She reaches up and kisses his cheek, and Peter beams happily
(looking worried) Haven't much gas left in this thing
Got to start promoting some
(throwing her his coat) Better take the things out of the pocket of that coat
Ought to be good for ten gallons
The scene fades out
Part Eight '  fades in, affording a close view of King Westley
He answers every description we have had of him
He is a stiff, handsome, stuffed-shirt gigolo
He sits in a chair, leaning on a cane, his gloves loosely in his hand
The view then moves back to reveal Andrews, who, from the opening of the scene, is speaking as he paces around the room
haven't changed my mind, Westley, want you to understand that
don't like you
never have
never will
That's clear enough, isn't it
You've made that quite evidentwith all your threats of annulment
(confident) Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute
Ellie and  got married because we love each other
And she's proving it; as far as 'm concerned there's going to be no annulment
(hard) You've got a good thing and you're hanging on to it, huh
(Andrews smiles in a very superior manner) All right, You win
'll just have to get used to you
admit 'm licked
But only because 'm worried
've had detectives all over the country searching for her
've seen thousands of photographs
Fortune tellers, nuts, every crank in the country has written me
(quietly) Haven't slept one night this week
If don't find her, 'll go crazy
might have been able to help if it weren't for you
've been watched so closely, (impatiently) Yes
know
Well, you can help now
issued a statement yesterday that 've withdrawn my objections
Begging her to come home
haven't heard from her
Apparently she doesn't trust me
288
Why should she
After all (interrupting) All right
That's why  sent for you
(pointing to next room) There's a room full of reporters out there
want you to make a statementthat you've had a talk with methat we've reached an understandingthat if Ellen comes home,  won't interfere with your marriage
Will you do that
If you really mean it,  will
(strongly) Of course  mean it
don't care whom she's married to (softly) as long as  can get her back
(he starts out) As Andrews opens the door, a number of reporters enter
Come in, boys
This is myuhthis is King Westley
(Westley rises) He has a statement to make
Hello, Westley
How do you do
(they group around him) The scene dissolves to the side of a lonely  at night
First there is a close-up of a newspaper headline, which reads
Magnate and Aviator Reconciled "Everything all right
Come home, darling," says Westley
Then the view draws back revealing that the newspaper is in the hands of Ellie, who sits in the car alone, gazing at the headlines
Then Peter's voice is heard
' All right, Brat
At the sound of his voice, she is startled, and she quickly folds the paper and throws it out of sight
She starts to get out of the car
(as she scrambles out of the car just as Peter comes up to her) Any luck
Yeah
He finally agreed to let us have a room
289
What about money
Talked him out of it
He thinks we're going to stay a week
'll have to think of something before morning
That's swell
'm glad you think so
If you ask me, it's foolish
told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight
We could make New York in less than three hours
couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning
Everybody's in bed
(after a pause) Okay
(with a wave of his hand) Cottage Number Three
As they start toward it, the scene cuts to the '
The owner of the auto camp and his wife are standing at window, looking out
She is a hatchet-faced shrew
He is meek and docile
There you gotrustin' people again
How many times did  tell you He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma
Yeah
They're all upright till they walk out on you
Said he was gonna stay a week
Mebbe
Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security
(unconvinced) don't trust him
The scene cuts to the inside of a not unlike the previous auto camp cabin in which Peter and Ellie spent a night
Peter's opened suitcase is on a chair, over which he leans
Ellie walks around, puffing at a cigarette
290
(without looking up) Well, here we are on the last lap
Ellie crosses to the window and stares out moodily
Peter removes several things from his suitcase and lays them on the bed
There is a strained silence between them, as both are lost in their own thoughts
close view of  as he putters abstractedly with the contents of his bag creates the impression that he empties it tonight rather ruefully
It somehow spells finis to their adventure
(strangely) Tomorrow morning, you'll be in the arms of your husband
(seen close) turns away from the window and looks at Peter
She stares this way for a long moment before speaking
(in a still, small voice) Yes
You'll have a great story, won't you
(dryly) Yeah, swell
Peter takes the rope out of his bag
It is the one used for the "Walls of Jericho" previously
He lays it aside and then, remembering, retrieves it
For a moment he holds it in his hand, speculatively; then turning, proceeds to tack it up
The noise of the tacking attracts Ellie's attention, and Ellie (again seen close) turns and looks toward Peter
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up
' Yep
The Walls of Jericho
(at which she turns back to the window) (also seen close) stretches the rope across the room and tacks the other side
(then reaching for blanket) We certainly outsmarted your father
(he throws the blanket over the rope) guess you ought to be happy
There is no response from her, a close view revealing that she quite obviously isn't happy
They are now separated by the blanket, and Peter gets her pajamas from his suitcase and throws them over the blanket
Thank you
(there is silence while Peter starts undressing) (suddenly) Am  going to see you in New York
291
(laconically) Nope
Why not
glances up at the "Walls of Jericho" and after a speculative pause, speaks quietly
don't make it a policy to run around with married women
close-up of Ellie, disclosing only her neck and shoulders, shows her slipping out of her clothes
She pausesthen looks up
No harm in your coming to see us
' Not interested
(at this Ellie's face falls, this is a definite rebuff) (weakly) Won't  ever see you again
(seen close) is now getting into his pajamas
What do you want to see me for
've served my purpose
brought you back to King Westley, didn't
(his mouth screws up bitterly) That's what you wanted, wasn't it
is already in bed, staring up at the ceiling
Peter, have you ever been in love
crawls into bed
probably did the world a great favor at that
Got two pinheads out of circulation
(he reaches over and lights a cigarette) Cupid thinks he's doing something when he brings two lovers together
What good's that
'm bringing two pains-in-the-neck together
think 'll start an institutionhang out a shingle
The view now widens to include both sides of the blanket
Ellie doesn't hear a word of Peter's attack
She is too intent on her own thoughts
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love
Me
292
Yes
Haven't you thought about it at all
Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy
(disdainfully) Maybe
(after a pause) Suresure, 've thought about it
Who hasn't
If  ever met the right sort of a girl, 'd (interrupting himself) Yeah, but where you going to find hersomebody that's realsomebody that's alive
They don't come that way any more
' disappointment is apparent
(seen close) 've even been sucker enough to make plans
(a long puff on his cigarette) saw an island in the Pacific once
Never been able to forget it
That's where 'd like to take her
But she'd have to be the sort of a girl that'd jump in the surf with me on moonlight nightsand love it as much as  did
(he loses himself in his romantic contemplations) You know, those nights when you and the moon and the water all become onewhen something comes over youand you feel that you're part of something big and marvelous
(sighing) Those are the only places to live
Where the stars are so close over your head that you feel you could reach right up and stir them around
close-up of  at this point shows that she is affected by his stirring description of a heavenfrom which she is excluded, as she listens to him continuing
' Certainly 've been thinking about it
Boy, if  could ever find a girl who's hungry for those things (again seen close) has disposed of his cigarette and now stares dreamily heavenward
'm going to Swim in the surf with herI'm going to reach up and grab stars for herI'm going to laugh with herand cry with her
'm going to kiss her wet lipsand Suddenly stopping, he turns his head slowly, sensing Ellie's nearness; and the view, drawing back to include Ellie, shows her standing at his bedside, looking down at him yearningly
Then we see them close together: Peter's face is immobile
Ellie drops to her knees
293
(fervently) Take me with you, Peter
Take me to your island
want to do all those things you talked about
Peter stares at her lovely face
His heart cries out with an impulse to crush her in his arms
(after a long pause; hoarsely) Better go back to your bed
(simply) love you
(arguing with himself) You're forgetting you're married
(tensely) don't care
love you
Nothing else matters
We can run away
Everything'll take care of itself
(begging) Please, Peter
You can't go out of my life now
couldn't live without you
(in a choked voice) Oh, Peter Sobbing, she lays her head on his breast and throws her arms around him
All is quiet for a moment as Ellie's head rests on his breast, while Peter struggles with an overwhelming urge to pour out his heart to her
(scarcely audible) Better go back to your bed
There is a lengthy pause, neither of them stirs
Then Ellie slowly raises her tear-stained face and gets to her feet
(whispering) 'm sorry
She turns and disappears behind the blanket
Peter remains motionless
Then a close view shows Ellie, as she gets into bed, sobbing quietly
She hides her face in the pillow to suppress her sobs
It is the first time in her life that she has been so deeply hurt close view next shows Peter reaching over for a cigarette, which he lights
All his movements are thoughtful, meditative
He leans back and stares at the ceiling, until we see only the cigarette in his mouth as it emits slowly rising puffs of smoke
This dissolving, the cigarette is seen to be burnt three quarters down, a long, frail ash hanging perilously on
Peter is then seen as he removes the cigarette from his mouth and crushes it in a tray
He leans back on the pillow and for a moment he is quiet
Then glancing over in Ellie's direction, he calls to her: 294
(softly calling) Hey, Brat
(a pause) Did you mean that
Would you really go
(he waits for a response, but none comes
He tries again) Hey, Brat He listensall is quiet
He slips his covers off and crosses to the blanket, and peers over it
She is asleep
Her tear-stained face rests on the pillow, her arm extends over her head
It is a childlike posture
is watching her tenderly
He speculates whether to awaken her and decides against it
He starts away
Peter tiptoes around the room for a few moments, deep in thought
Then as an idea which he has been turning over in his mind begins to take form, he hastily begins dressing
The scene dissolving, Peter is seen completely clothed and starting for the door when he thinks of something
He turns back, grabs his suitcase, stops to throw a kiss to Ellie, and goes out into the night
Thereupon the scene wipes off, disclosing a Gas Station along the road at night
Here Peter is talking to a station attendant
All 'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York
The bag's worth twenty-five dollars
(hesitatingly) Yeah, but  got a bag
My wife gave me one for Christmas
("high-pressuring" him) Listen, manI'll tell you what 'll do
When  come back in the morning, 'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit
What do you say
(looking at Peter's hat) ain't got a hat What
ain't got a hat
(promptly putting it on his head) Well, you got one now
Come on, fill 'er up
While he is still talking the scene dissolves to a view of Peter driving furiously, a broad, happy grin on his face, following which several scenes wipe off in succession (denoting the passage of time) scenes of Peter driving at high speed, causing several cows to amble out of the way; of the driving into the Holland Tunnel, and of the   of a  where Peter stands in 295
front of a small desk upon which there is a typewriter
Near him is a swarthy Italian
Fine
That's fine, Tony
Now get me a drink and make sure nobody disturbs me for half an hour
(going out) Sure
Sure, Pete
As Peter plants himself in front of the machine, the scene dissolves to a close-up of the typewriter carriage upon which are typed the words: "and that's the full and exclusive story of Ellen Andrews' adventures on the road
As soon as her marriage to King Westley is annulled, she and Peter Warne, famous newspapermanand undoubtedly the most promising young novelist of the present erawill be married
" The view drawing back, Peter re-reads the last sentence, smiles contentedly, and as he yanks out the sheet, the scene wipes off disclosing the outside of ' , the sign on the door reading: "OfficeMr
Gordon
" Gordon's secretary is at her desk as Peter breezes in
(rumpling her hair) Hello, Agnes
Better not go in
He'll shoot you on sight
(entering) haven't been shot at for days
In ' , Gordon is at his desk
He looks up when Peter enters
(rising to his full height menacingly) Get out of here
(advancing) Wait a minute, GordonI (quietly) Get out
Peter reaches his side, and grabs him by the arms
Joe, listen Don't "Joe" me
296
Okay, Joe
Listenyou know 've always liked you
Anytime  could do you a great turnanytime  ran into a story that looked goodI always came running to you, didn't
Well,  got one now
Those wires  sent you were on the level
It's the biggest scoop of the year
'm giving it to you, Joe
You mean about the Andrews' kid
That's it
(tapping his pocket) got it all written up
Ready to go
All  want is a thousand dollars
Upon hearing this  is ready to jump out of his skin
thousand dollars
(furiously) Get out of this office before  throw you out bodily
Don't get sore, Joe
This is something you got to do for me
need a thousand dollarsand  need it quick
'm in a jam
(softening) What's the thousand bucks for
To tear down the Walls of Jericho
What
Never mind
Listensuppose  should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled
Huh
That she's going to marry somebody else
You're drunk
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you
If it's on the level
Well,  got it, Joe
297
Who's she gonna marry
(taking out the story from his pocket) It's all right here
Give me the thousand and it's yours
(skeptically) wouldn't trust you as far as  could throw that desk
Wait a minute, Joe
Use your bean couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that
'd be crazy
There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that

Sure

Who's the guy she's gonna marry

(his eyes widening) You
Yeah
Now  know you're drunk
(he grabs his hat) 'm going home
Don't annoy me any more
(running after Gordon as the latter starts out) For heaven's sake, Joestop being an editor for just a minute
(he grabs his arm) We've been friends for a long time, haven't we
You ought to know when 'm serious
This is on the level
Gordon is affected by the sincere note in Peter's voice
met her on a bus coming from Miami
Been with her every minute
(hoarsely) 'm in love with her, Joe
Well, 'll be 298
Listen, Palyou've got to get this money for me
Now
Minutes count
She's waiting for me in an auto camp outside of Philadelphia
've got to get right back
You see, she doesn't know 'm gone
(self-consciously) guy can't propose to a girl without a cent in the world, can he
While Peter has been speaking Gordon stares into space thoughtfully
What a story
(picturing it) On her way to join her husband, Ellen Andrews falls in love with (alertgrabbing paper out of Peter's hand) Lemme see that a minute
He moves to his desk excitedly, and Peter, a gleam of hope in his eyes, joins him, following which the scene cuts to the  of the camp owner and wife in the early morning
The owner is suddenly startled out of his sleep by the voice of his wife calling, "zeke
zeke
" He looks up, just as she rushes into the room
told you
told you, you couldn't trust him
He's gone
Who
That feller last night, that's who
He was gonna stay a week, huh
Well, he's skipped
Took the car with him, too
We wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if  hadn't took that magnesia
(pulling at him) Come on, get up, don't lay there
Let's do something about it
Thereupon the scene cuts to the affording a close view of tossing restlessly in her sleep
Suddenly there is a loud banging on the door, and Ellie, startled, awakens
The pounding continuing, Ellie looks around, frightened
The door suddenly bursts open, and the owner and wife enter
They both glance over at Peter's side
See that
They're gone
(timidly) Looks like it, don't it
(suddenly he sees Ellie) Here's the woman, ma
(full of fightglaring at Ellie) Oh
299
(in a close view at Ellie's Bed as the owner and his wife come up to her; timidlysitting up) What's the matter
Where's your husband, young lady Husband
Yesif he is your husband
Isn't he here
No, he ain't
And the car's gone, too
(bewildered) Why, he'll be back
Yeah
What makes you think so
He took his suitcase and everything
(Ellie is perceptibly startled by this piece of news) Kinda surprised, huh
It's just like told you, Zeke
They ain't married a'tall
There is a close view of  as the wife's voice continues uninterruptedly: ' could tell she was a hussy just from the looks of her
Ellie is lost in thought, trying to adjust herself to the idea of Peter's leaving her like this
She scarcely hears what is being said
' Hey
You
Got any money
(snapping out of her trance) Whyno
(the three now seen together) Thenyou'll have to git
Yeah, you'll have to git
Why, you can't put me out in the middle of the 300
Serves you right
Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road
You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp
But can't you wait until morning Ain't gonna wait a minute
Not a minute
Better start gettin' into your clothes
Yeah
(glaring at him) Zeke
(he looks up startled) Git
(disappointed) Yes, Ma
As Zeke leaves, the Wife plunks herself in a chair, grimly determined to wait until Ellie gets dressed and out
Can  use your telephone
want to talk to New York
You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls
You can go down to the Sheriff's office
The scene thereupon cuts to the of the   as Ellie emerges, the Wife standing in the doorway
In the foreground several people are scattered around the courtyard
One woman washes stockings under a pump
man is changing the tire on his car
Ellie comes down the steps and crosses the courtyard
(shouting to her) And listen, next time better keep away from here
run a respectable place
Ellie does not turn, but walks straight forward, trying to maintain her poise
The people in the courtyard turn to stare at her, and one of them snickers
The scene dissolves to ' as Peter is pocketing the money
Gordon is fondling the story
Thanks, Pal
You saved my life
301
(waving the story) Okay, pete
(he drops the story on the desk and escorts peter out, his arm around his shoulder) For my dough, (smiling) you're still the best newspaperman in the business
They reach the door, which peter opens
Then they appear at the
Through the open door the secretary stares dumbfounded at their friendliness
'long, kid
And good luck
Outside ' , peter kisses the secretary as he passes through
'Bye, Agnes
You're beautiful
All women are beautiful
(he goes out) Gordon is immediately electrified into action
Oh, boy
What a yarn
What a yarn
(suddenly) Get me Hank on the phone
Gotta hold up the morning edition
While he speaks he dashes back to his desk
We then see him in his office
' There's Hank
(grabbing phone) Hank
Listen
Hold the morning edition
Break down the front page
Gonna have a completely new layoutSend a couple of re-write men in here
Don't do a thingI got a story that'll make your hair curl
During his speech, his other phone has been ringing persistently
He has ignored it until now
He picks up receiver: (into the second phone) Yeah
Yeah
Don't annoy me
'm busy
(he bangs up receiver, and turns back to the first phone) Listen, Hank
Dig out all the Andrews pictures
Get Healy out of bed
want a cartoon right away
(the second phone rings impatiently, but Gordon ignores it) With King Westley in it
He's waiting at the church
Big tears streaming down his face
His bride hasn't shown up
Old Man Andrews is there, 302
too
Laughing his head off
Everything exaggerated
You knowNow snap into it
(he bangs up the receiver, and grabs the second phone, speaking into it impatiently) Yeah
Yeah
What is it
close view of , as he listens, shows his eyes widening with amazement
What
Ellen Andrews
You're crazy
This cuts to a   where a reporter is seen speaking excitedly
Yeah
She just phoned her father from an auto camp to come and get her
He's getting a police escort
Westley's going along, too
She's been traveling by bus
The moment she read that her father and Westley made up, she phoned in
Back in '  Gordon is seen still at the phone
You sure that's right
Say, you haven't been drinking, have you
Okaygrab a carand stay with them
(he hangs up the receiver and grabs the first phone) Put Hank on
(shouting) Agnes
(as the secretary hurries in) Get me a doctor
'm about to have a nervous breakdown
(she stares at him dumbly as he speaks into the phone) Hankforget everything  just told you
was just having a nightmare
(he hangs upand turns to Agnes) Call up the police department
Tell 'em to find Peter Warne
Send out a general alarm
want the dirty crook pinched
He picks up Peter's story and flings it viciously into the wastebasket
(starting out) Yessir
(two re-write men come in, passing Agnes) You want us
(wheeling around) Yeah
Shove everything off the front page
Ellen Andrews just phoned her fathershe's coming home
The moment she heard the old man withdrew his objections, she gave herself up
Spread it all over the place
Here's your lead: "Love Triumphant
" Step on it
303
(leaving) Yessir
Gordon goes to his desk, mumbling to himself
His eye lights on the waste basket containing Peter's story, and he is about to kick it when he stops
He stares at it thoughtfully, reaches down, lifts it outruns through it hastilyand then stares into space, deep in thought
The scene dissolves to an open , in the morning, as Peter flies over it in his Ford
He beams happily
He passes a gasoline truck and waves cheerily to the driver
This dissolves to a close-up of an   accompanied by a prolonged wail, then to a , that morning, as four motorcycles, two abreast, speed forward, followed by a luxurious limousine, which in turn is trailed by a car filled with reporters
Next, in the , Andrews is seen in the back seat
He is accompanied by King WestleyHendersonLovington, and a police inspector
knew she was safe
(sighing) Certainly gave us a run for our money
(but Andrews is too overwhelmed with joy to listen to any of this) (anxiously) Can't you get them to go any faster
(at this the Inspector leans over to talk to chauffeur) This dissolves to a deserted , Peter at the wheel of his car
His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing
(singing) " found a million dollar baby" He is interrupted by the song of a meadowlark, whistling its strange melody
Peter listens to it a second time, then answers its call by imitating it
The meadowlark whistles again, and peter is highly amused
(waving his handto the meadowlark) Okay, pal
Be seein' you
Just then the sound of sirens is heard in the distance
Peter glances back, and as the sirens come nearer, he pulls over to the side of the road
There follows a full view of the , with peter in the foreground at the side as the police cavalcade whizzes by accompanied by the shrieking sirens
Thereupon (seen close) gets an idea
(to his Ford) Come on, Dobbin, old boy
We got a police escort
304
He applies the gas and shoots out of sight, following which a full view of the road shows Peter's car trying to catch up with the parade
It outdistances him, however, and we see  in the Ford pressing his body forward to help the car make time
His foot pushes the accelerator down to the floor
But the police cars are now out of sight, and Peter gives up
(seen close; to the carwith exaggerated dramatics) Dobbin, me lad
You failed muh
'm afraid you're gittin' old
Thereupon the scene dissolves to a small town , where at the door of a Sheriff's office a policeman is standing on guard
The reporters hang around in front of him
Several yokels look on
The limousine and motor cycles are at the curb
And now, in a closer view, at the  the policeman on guard steps aside as the door opens and Ellie, her father, and King Westley emerge
King has his arm around her
The moment they appear in the doorway, cameras click and several reporters surround them
Will you make a statement Miss Andrews
Was it an exciting experience
How did you travel
(brushing them aside) Later, boys, later
See her at home
They cross the sidewalkto the waiting limousine, as cameras click
The scene dissolves to a , with Peter still driving
He is, however, as before, in excellent form, and is singing lustily
Suddenly, however, his eyes widen and he pulls on his brake; the car screeches and moansand comes to a stop
Take it easy, Dobbin
Remember your blood pressure
We find Peter directly in front of a slow moving freight train
Several hoboes stick their heads out of a car, and Peter waves to them
The hoboes look puzzled for a minute and then wave back
The view then swings over to an opening between the cars affording a flash of the police parade on the other side, apparently on its way back
amuses himself by talking to an old flagman
Better get that toy train out of here
'm in a hurry
The Flagman grins at him in reply
By this time the last car is in sight, and Peter gets all set to move
He stops, however, to wave to a couple of brakemen on the rear platform
In the meantime, the motorcycles have started forward, and the sirens begin their low, moaning wail
Peter, attracted, turns, and over Peter's shoulder we see the parade starting
As the limousine 305
passes, we get a glimpse of the inside
Ellie lies back on King Westley's shoulder
He has his arm around her as they pass out of sight
Thereupon a close view of  shows him reacting to what he saw
He turns his head quickly to stare at the disappearing car, a look of astonishment and bewilderment in his eyes
Slowly he turns his head forward, staring ahead of him blankly; he can't quite make it out
Then gradually the significance of it all strikes himand his mouth curls up bitterly
The scene wiping off, a series of come into view: "
" "      " " " "  " " " " " "     " This dissolves to the anteroom of a The place is alive with activity, and copies of newspapers are lying around, bearing headlines relating to the Andrews story
Peter, a bewildered, stunned expression on his face, enters and crosses funereally toward Gordon's office
Several people standing around look up
Hi, PeteDidya see this
Ellen Andrews is back
Gonna marry that Westley guy after allWhat a dame
What a dame
Peter pays no attention to any of this
He reaches Gordon's door, which is open
He walks directly past Agnes and enters the office
She looks up at him, puzzled
Then in ' , Peter walks to Gordon's desk and lays the roll of bills on it
Agnes enters, watching him anxiously
Gordon's out back some place
(seeing the money, she looks up, surprised) See that he gets that, will you, Agnes
Tell him  was just kidding
(he goes out) As Agnes stares after him, puzzled, Gordon dashes in from a back door
You can't get a thing done around her unless Peter Warne was just in
Huh
What
Left this money
Said to tell you he was just kidding
306
(looking at the money) Where is he
The scene cuts to the   and , as seen over Gordon's shoulder through the open door
Peter is seen walking out
Gordon hurries after him
' Hey, Pete
At the sound of Gordon's voice, Peter turns, and Gordon comes over to him
Hello, Joe
Sorry
Just a little gag of mine
Thought 'd have some fun with you
(understanding) Yeah
Sure
Had me going for a while
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it
Great
But that's the way things go
You think you got a swell yarnthen something comes alongmesses up the finishand there you are
(smiling wryly) Yeah, where am
(slipping a bill in his coat pocket) When you sober upcome in and see me
(a whisper) Thanks, Joe
He leaves, Gordon watching him sympathetically, and the scene fades out
Part Nine The  of the   fades in
It is morning and at the moment the place is a beehive of activity
Dozens of butlers and maids hustle around setting tables
Floral decorations are being hung by men on ladders
In the background on a platform, a twenty-piece orchestra is getting ready, accompanied by the scraping of chairs, adjusting of music stands, unpacking of instruments
The scene cuts to ' : King Westley is seated, and Andrews walks around him
They are both dressed in striped trousers, frock coat, etc
Well, here we are; it's all set
You're finally going to be married properly
(he waves toward the window) With all the fanfare and everything
307
(shaking his head) still don't know how it happenedbut you're going to be my son-in-law whether like it or not
guess you're pleased
Why; naturally, (drily) Naturally
(with vehemence) You're going to become a partner in a big institution
It's one of the largest in the world
You talk as if Someday perhaps, you might even take charge
close view of  shows him looking around his study despairingly
(murmuring) The thought of it makes me shudder
' (confidently) You might be surprised
hope so
However, that'll take care of itself
(taking a new tack) There's another responsibility you're taking on
One that 'm really concerned about
' What's that
My daughter
(the two now seen again; lightly) Ellie
Oh, she's no responsibility
No
Say, listenI've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat
Toughest job  ever tackled
Ever hear of
Clarkson
Biggest man in the country, isn't he
Well,  tamed him Got him eating out of the palm of my hand
've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministerssome of the most powerful people in the worldbut 've never been able to do a thing with her
She's been too much for me
'm glad you think it's easy
308
(he bends over him) Now listenif you'll do what  tell you, perhaps  might develop a little respect for you
You never can tell
What would you like to have me do
Sock her
close view of  shows him looking up, surprised, as Andrews' voice continues
' Sock her at least once a day
Do it on general principles
Make her know you're the boss and never let her forget it
Think you can do that
It's quite an assignment Try
Do me a favor
Try
It's your only chance
And hers, too
Do that for meand maybe we'll be friends (muttering) Maybe
(he holds out his hand) Do we understand each other
(taking his handrising) Yes, sir
(dismissing him) Fine
'll see you at the reception
He withdraws his hand, which he looks at disgustedlythe result of a jellyfish handshake
Oh, by the way, Mr Andrews,  thought of a great stunt for the reception
(as Andrews looks at him quizzically) 'm going to land on the lawn in an autogyro
[14] What do you think of that
close view of  shows him staring off at King in complete disgust
You thought that up all by yourself, huh
(unabashed) Why, it'll make all the front pages
spectacular thing like that 309
(hard) Personally,  think it's stupid
(humoring a child) But go ahead
Have a good time
As long as Ellie doesn't object
Oh, no
She'll be crazy about it
Well, see you later
'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space
(holding out his hand) Goodbye
(but Andrews turns his back on him) We've done that already
(smiling) Yes, of course
He turns and leaves; Andrews watching him go, shaking his head sadly
Autogyro
hope he breaks his leg
Andrews starts out, and the scene cuts to the  as Andrews enters from the study
maid coming down the stairs, he calls to her: OhMary Yes, sir
How is she
(hesitantly) Whyuhshe's all right, sir
What's the matter
Anything wrong
Oh, no, sir
No different than Yes

Still in the dumps, huh
Yessir
If you'll excuse me, sirshe sent me for a drink
(she leaves) Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the in front of Ellie's door
Andrews enters and knocks several times
Receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door
310
Next Andrews enters ' and looks around
The view swings around the room, following his gaze
It focuses on Ellie, who reclines on a sofa, in her bridal outfit, her head resting on the back
She stares moodily, unhappily up at the ceiling
The view then expanding to include both father and daughter, Andrews is seen staring at her a moment sympathetically
He senses something is wrong
(after a pause) Ellie (jumping up with a start) Oh, hello, Dad
(a close view as he goes over to her) knocked several times
Sorry
Must have been day-dreaming
(to hide her confusion, she reaches for a cigarette) (with forced lightness) Well, everything's set
Creating quite a furor, too
Great stunt King's going to pull
(in a faraway voice) Stunt
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro
Oh, yes
heard
(noting her listlessness) Yes
Personally,  think it's silly, too
As he continues talking, the view moves with Ellie, who wanders over to a window overlooking the lawn and stares out, lost in thought
' (he goes over the Ellie) You look lovely
Are you pleased with the gown
(as Ellie does not seem to hear him, he becomes worried) Ellie
(turning and looking at him blankly) Huh
(it just penetrates) Ohthe gown (distantly) Yes, it's beautiful
311
(tenderly) What's the matter, Ellie
What's wrong
Nothing
(she walks over to table and crushes her cigarette) You've been acting so strangely since you returned
'mI'm worried
haven't bothered to ask you any questionsI (waving his hand toward the lawn) Isn't all this what you wanted
(receiving no answer from Ellie) You haven't changed your mind about King, have you
(too quickly) Oh, no
If you have, it isn't too late
You know how  feel about him
But  want to make you happy
You gave me such a scareIwhen  couldn't find you
(smiling feeblymeaning his heart) You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be
(her hand on his arm) Sorry, Dad
wouldn't hurt you for the world
You know that
She moves away from him and sits on the sofa, and Andrews watches her a moment and crosses over to her
He sits beside her, placing an arm affectionately around her shoulder
(tenderly) Elliewhat is it
Aren't you happy, child
At this point she finally breaks, and impulsively buries her face on his breast
(after a pause, hoarsely) thought so
knew there was something on your mind
(there are audible sobs from Ellie) Therethere
They remain thus quietly for some time
Finally Andrews breaks the silence
What is it, darling
(receiving no answer) You haven't fallen in love with somebody else, have you
As this brings an audible sob from Ellie, Andrews lifts up her chin
312
(looking into her eyes) Have you
(Ellie turns her head away, a little ashamed of her tears) Ellie now rises and walks miserably away from him, dabbing her eyes
Andrews, watching her, realizes he has hit upon the truth
He walks over to her
haven't seen you cry since you were a baby
This must be serious
(Ellie is silent) Where'd you meet him
On the road
(trying to cheer her) Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver
(smiling) No
Who is he
don't know very much about him
(in a whisper) Except that  love him
(the great executive) Well, if it's as serious as all thatwe'll move heaven and earth to (quickly) It'll do no good
(wryly) He despises me
Oh, come now He despises everything  stand for
He thinks 'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere
Ridiculous
He doesn't think so much of you either
313
(his eyes widening) Well
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me
Thinks you raised me stupidly
(smiling) Fine man to fall in love with
(whispering) He's marvelous
Well, what are we going to do about it
Where is he
(sadly) don't know
'd like to have a talk with him
It's no use, Dad
practically threw myself at him
(she shrugs futilely) Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off
No, 'll go through with it
But that's silly, child
Seeing how you feel, why It doesn't matter
(tired) don't want to stir up any more trouble
've been doing it all my life
've been such a burden to youmade your life so miserableand mine, too
'm tired, Dad
Tired of running around in circles
He's right, that's what 've been doing ever since  can remember
close-up of  shows him watching Ellie, as her voice continues
' 've got to settle down
It really doesn't matter howor whereor with whom
(seriouslyimpressed) You've changed, Ellie
314
(seen with Andrews; sighing) Yes,  guess  have
(sincerely) don't want to hurt anybody any more
want to get away from all this front page publicity
It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome
can't walk out on King now
It'll make us all look so ridiculous
(she shrugs resignedly) Besides, what difference does it make
(inaudibly) 'll never see Peter again
Is that his name
Yes
Peter Warne
She starts to walk away when she is attracted by her father's surprise at the mention of the name
Peter Warne
(his hand has instinctively gone to his inside pocket) (noticing this) Why
Do you know him
(but Andrews withdraws his hand
Apparently he has changed his mind) (evasively) Oh, nono
(suddenly anxious) You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad
(obviously guilty) Why, no
Don't be silly
Oh, please, Dad She has reached into his pocket and has extracted a letter, which she hurriedly opens and reads, following which we see a  in Peter's handwriting
It is addressed to: "Alexander Andrews, 11 Wall Street
" It reads: "Dear Sir: should like to have a talk with you about a financial matter in connection with your daughter
Peter Warne
" Ellie is then seen reading and re-reading the note
Her face clouds and then slowly changes to an expression of complete disillusionment
315
(her voice strident) Looks like that was his only interest in me
The reward
(taking the note from her) 'm sorry you read it
Are you going to see him
suppose so
(hard) Certainly
Pay him off
He's entitled to it
He did an excellent job
Kept me thoroughly entertained
It's worth every penny he gets
She paces agitatedly, Andrews watching her silently
He knows what an awful blow to her pride this must be
Mary now enters with a cocktail tray which she sets on the table
Thanks, Mary
That's just what  need
(she pours herself a cocktail) Mr
King Westley is on his way up
FineFine
Have him come in
(mumbling) 'll be going
(he goes out behind Mary) Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters
(upon seeing him) Well, if it isn't the groom himself
You're just in time, King
close view of the Two shows King taking her in his arms
How are you, Ellie
(he gives her a kiss, which she accepts perfunctorilybut he insists upon being ardent) Are you happy
(releasing herself) Happy
Why shouldn't  be happy
'm getting the handsomest man in captivity
(handing him a drink) Here you are, King
Let's drink
(she holds her glass out) Let's drink to us
316
(she drains the glass; pouring another, as she continues) We finally made it, didn't we
You bet we did
It's up to you now
want our life to be full of excitement, King
We'll never let up, will we
Never a dull moment
We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off
Promise you'll never let me get off
It's the only way to live, isn't it
No time to think
We don't want to stop to think, do we
Just want to keep going
Whatever you say, darling
heard about your stunt
That's swell, King
Just think of itthe groom lands on the lawn with a plane
It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead
It sets just the right tempo
(handing him a drink) Come on, King
You're lagging
(they both drink) In ' , Andrews walks around the room, perceptibly affected by his visit with Ellie
He keeps turning Peter's letter over in his hand, apparently debating in his mind what to do with it
He finally gets an ideaand determinedly crosses to the phone
Then the scene cuts to a
First there is a close-up of a NEWSPAPERa tabloid bearing a heading which reads: " " "Interrupted Romance of Ellen Andrews and King Westley Resumed, as Father Yields
Wedding Reception to be Held on Andrews' Lawn
" Below this is a page of pictures, and the view turns to each photograph
The first picture is of Ellie and King on a beach
The title over the picture reads: "Where they met
" The second picture shows them in the cockpit of a plane, the heading reading: "Where they romanced
" The next picture is of a small frame house with a shingle on it reading: "Justice of the Peace
" Over the photograph is a caption: "Where they were married
" The next picture is of the Andrews Yacht, and the title reads: "Where she was taken
" Finally, the view moves down to the bottom of the page to a picture of Ellie and King, with her father between them, in front of Sheriff's office
Caption reads: "Where love triumphed
" Over these pictures the phone bell has been ringing
And now  is seen staring, expressionless, at the newspaper
Suddenly he becomes conscious of the phone ringing; he looks upthen goes to it
(into the phone) Hello
Yes
Who
Oh Why can't  see you at your office
The scene cuts to ' , affording a close view of  at the phone
317
leave for Washington tonight
May be gone several weeks
Thought perhaps you'd like to get this thing settled
This cuts to the   where is at the phone
Yeah, but  don't like the idea of walking in on your jamboree
Just between you and methose things give me a stiff pain
(seen in his office) You needn't see anybody
You can come directly to my study
'd appreciate it very much if (at his phone) Nono
What the deuce do  want to His eyes fall on something, and there follows a close view of a tabloid newspaper, featuring the heading: "Love Triumphant" and containing the pictures of Ellie and King
The view then moves down to feature headline reading "Groom to Land on Bride's Lawn
" "King Westley plans to drop in an autogyro on the lawn of Andrews estate
" Peter's mouth screws up disdainfully
(into the phone) Yeah, wait a minute
Maybe  will come over
'd like to get a load of that three-ring circus you're pulling want to see what love looks like when it's triumphant
haven't had a good laugh in a week
(he is still at the phone as the scene dissolves) Then the  of the dissolves in
It is now filled with guests, who wander around, chattering gaily
The orchestra plays
captain of waiters in the foreground instructs his men
want everything to be just so
When the ceremony starts, you stand on the sidestill
No moving aroundno talking, comprenez
The view cuts to a  leading to the estate, and Peter is seen driving up in his Ford and squeezing in between two Rolls-Royces
The uniformed chauffeurs glare at him
But Peter springs nonchalantly out of his car
(blithely, as he passes them) Keep your eye on my car when you're backing up, you guys
And as he goes, the chauffeurs look at each other, surprised
The scene dissolves to ' , where a butler stands in front of Andrews who is seated at his desk
318
Show him in
The Butler leaving, a close view shows reaching over and snapping on a dictograph concealed somewhere on his desk
The office coming into view again, we see Andrews rising and awaiting Peter's entrance
After a moment Peter comes in, removes his soft felt hat, and tucks it under his arm
Mr
Warne
Yeah
Come in
Sit down
Peter advances into the room, looking around curiously
His air is frigid, contemptuous as Andrews studies him, and he makes no move to sit
Andrews waves to a chair and sits down himself
Peter flops into the nearest chair
(seen close with Peter; after a pause) was surprised to get your note
My daughter hadn't told me anything about you
About your helping her
That's typical of your daughter
Takes those things for granted
(too restless to sit, he jumps up) Why does she think  lugged her all the way from Miami (vehemently) for the love of it
Please understand me
When  say she didn't tell me anything about it, mean not until a little while ago
She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get
(bitterly) Oh, she does, huh
Isn't that sweet of her
You don't ,  suppose
(shrugging) don't know
'd have to see on what you base your claim
presume you feel you're justified in (seen close now) If  didn't  wouldn't be here
(he reaches into his pocket) 've got it all itemized
319
(and he throws the paper on Andrews' desk) picks up the paper and glances at it
After a moment, he looks at Peter, studying him interestedly; then he returns to the paper, and reads its contents: "Cash outlay 8
60 Topcoat 15
00 Suitcase 7
50 Hat 4
00 3 shirts 4
50 Total 39
60" Andrews looks up from the paper
This is a twist he hadn't anticipated, and he doesn't quite know how to handle it
(now seen closer with Andrews) sold some drawers and socks, too; 'm throwing those in
And this is what you wantthirty-nine dollars and sixty cents
Why not
'm not charging you for the time  wasted
Yes,  knowbut What's the matter
Isn't it cheap enough
trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars
Let me get this straight
You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars
What ten thousand
The reward
(sharply) Who said anything about a reward
(smiling) 'm afraid 'm a little confused
You see,  assumed you were coming here for (impatiently) All  want is thirty-nine sixty
If you'll give me a check 'll get out of this place
It gives me the jitters
You're a peculiar chap
320
(irritably) We'll go into that some other time
The average man would go after the reward
All you seem to Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you
This is a matter of principle
Something you probably wouldn't understand
(he burns at the thought) When somebody takes me for a buggy ride don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege
You were taken for a buggy ride
Yeahwith all the trimmings
Now, how about the check
Do  get it
close-up indicates that  has been studying Peter throughout the scene
He is now completely won over
(smiling) Certainly
(he opens a checkbook and writes it out) While Andrews writes, Peter wanders around the room in an attitude of bitter contempt
Andrews rises and goes to him
Here you are
(as Peter takes the check) Do you mind if  ask you something frankly
(Peter just looks at him without responding) Do you love my daughter
(evasively, while folding the check) guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined
That's an evasion
(putting the check into a wallet) She grabbed herself a perfect running mate
King Westley
The pill of the century
(pocketing wallet) What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every daywhether it's coming to her or not
close view of the  shows Andrews smiling: Here is a man
If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourselflong ago
321
Do you love her
(going for his hat as he replies) normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts
(going to the door) She's my idea of nothing
asked you a question
Do you love her
(snapping it out) Yes
(as Andrews smiles) But don't hold that against me
'm a little screwy myself
He snaps the door open and goes out, following which  is seen watching the door, his eyes twinkling, and the scene cuts to the as Peter comes through, moving on to the front door
But just as he reaches it, Ellie enters, accompanied by half a dozen men and holding a cocktail in her hand
They see each other almost simultaneously, and both stop, glaring
(looking her over contemptuously) Perfect
Now you look natural
At this Ellie leaves her group and comes toward Peter, and a close view shows them together, glaring at each other
(icily) hope you got your money
You bet  did
Congratulations
Same to you
Why don't you stay and watch the fun
You'll enjoy it immensely
would
But 've got a weak stomach
He wheels around and goes through the door, Ellie looking after him, her eyes blazing
The drone of a plane motor outside is heard, and several people rush down the stairs, all excited
Here comes King
He's just coming down
Hurry up, everybody
Come on, Ellie
322
Immediately there is a general excitement, as guests hurry through the hallway on the way to the lawn
But Ellen does not moveshe remains staring blankly at the door through which Peter went until Andrews enters from his study
just had a long talk with him
(her voice breaking) 'm not interested
Now, wait a minute, Ellie (sharply) don't want to hear anything about him
She walks away from him, and Andrews, frustrated, looks at her helplessly
Thereupon the scene dissolves to a full view of the
The orchestra is playing Mendelssohn's Wedding March
The lawn is crowded with guests
In the background we see the autogyro idling
closer view shows a small platform, serving as an altar
Over it there is an arbor of roses
Back of the altar stands a minister, ready
reverse view reveals a long, narrow, carpeted pathway leading to the house
Both sides are lined with guests, who are murmuring excitedly
At the moment, King Westley and his best man are marching solemnly toward the altar
Back of the altar we see a high platform upon which are several newsreel men who are grinding their cameras
The guests, of whom close glimpses are caught, are now peering over each other's shoulders
King and his best man have reached the altar, and the music of the wedding march comes to a stop
The orchestra leader is looking around, apparently waiting for a signal
At the  of the  a very "prissy" middle-aged man waves his handkerchief and nods his head to the orchestra leader
The orchestra leader acknowledges the signal by nodding his headturns to his menwaves his baton, and the orchestra starts playing, "Here Comes the Bride
"The guests whisper to each other excitedly
great deal of stirring takes place
The door of the house slowly opensand a parade of small flower girls emerges
They march, taking each step carefully, while they strew flowers along the path
They are well out of the way when Ellie, on the arm of her father, appears in the doorway
view of the guests shows that they cannot contain themselves
Murmurs of "Here she comes," and "Doesn't she look beautiful
" are heard
The newsreel men on their platform behind the altar bestir themselves
This is what they've been waiting for
and her  (seen close) now make their way to the altar
Ellie's face is solemn, and her jaws set
(whispering out of the side of his mouth) You're a sucker to go through with this
Ellie glances at him out of the corner of her eyeand quickly turns forward again
323
That guy Warne is
He didn't want the reward
Ellie keeps her eyes glued in front of her, remaining expressionless
All he asked for was thirty-nine dollars and sixty cents
that's what he spent on you
It was a matter of principle with himsays you took him for a ride
This registers on Ellie and she raises her eyesbut her reaction is only slightly perceptible
close view of a    shows two girls looking enviously in the direction of the bride
(whispering) wish  were in her shoes
Yes
She certainly is lucky
and her  are seen again, and  is still whispering to her
He loves you, Ellie
Told me so
This brings a definite reaction, which she quickly covers up
You don't want to be married to a mug like Westley
At this there is a close view of Westleythere is a satisfied smirk on his face
can buy him off for a pot of gold, and you can make an old man happy, and you wouldn't do so bad for yourself
If you change your mind, your car's waiting at the back gate
Ellie gives no indication of her intentions
Her face remains immobile
And now Ellie and her father have reached the altar
The "prissy" man is placing them in position
The big moment has arrived
The guests are all atwitter
But a close view of  shows that she realizes that her fate is closing in on her
She looks around for a means of escape
(starting the ceremony) Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God and in the face of this company to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony
If any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together, let him speak now or else hereafter forever hold his 324
peace
King, wilt thou have this woman to be thy wedded wife
So long as ye both shall live
will
Ellen, wilt thou have this man to be thy wedded husband so long as ye both shall live
Then, seen at the , Ellie makes her decision
She reaches down, takes a firm hold on her train and, pushing several people aside, runs out of the scene
Those at the altar look up, surprised, and the most startled of all is himself
(calling after her) Ellie
He starts to go after herbut finds Andrews in his way while the outcries of the guests rise in chorus
What's happened
Where's she going
On the platform, the newsreel men, a look of astonishment on their faces, decide to follow Ellie
Get her, Mac
She's ducking
And, as viewed by the newsreel men, Ellie is seen in the distance dashing through the gates
The guests stare dumbfounded
Following this, Andrews and King are seen together in the crowd
(helplessly) What happened
(blandly) haven't the slightest idea
But his mouth twitches as he tries to keep from smiling
As King runs out of sight Andrews gets out a cigar and lights ita happy smile on his face which he now doesn't try to conceal
Outside the   Ellie is seen in a fast roadster, as she starts away with a plunge
Her eyes sparkle
crowd of people dash up, headed by King
They stop dead when they see the car disappear
On the  the commotion runs high, and the guests chatter their amazement
close view of  shows him smiling with satisfaction
The scene dissolves to ' , where Andrews is regaling himself with a whiskey and soda
He is in a pleasantly inebriated mood when his  enters
325
(as he picks up the phone that has started ringing) Don't want to talk todon't want to talk to anybody
Don't want to see anybody
But it's King Westley on the phone
Ooooooh
(into the phone) Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law
've sent you a check for a hundred thousand
Yes
That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment
That's satisfactory, isn't it
Yeah
Well, it ought to be
Oh 'm not complaining
It was dirt cheap
(as he hangs up) Don't fall out of any windows
(placing a telegram on the desk) There's another wire from Peter, sir
They're in Glen Falls, Michigan
(reading it) "What's holding up the annulment, you slow poke
The Walls of Jericho are toppling
" (to the Secretary) Send him a telegram right away
Just say: "Let 'em topple
" This dissolves to the exterior of an very much like the other camps at which Peter and Ellie stayed
The owner's wife is talking to her husband
Funny couple, ain't they
Yeah
If you ask me,  don't believe they're married
They're married all right
just seen the license
They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this
Yeah
326
What do you reckon that's for
Blamed if  know
just brung 'em a trumpet
(puzzled) trumpet
Yeah
You know, one of those toy things
They sent me to the store to get it
But what in the world do they want a trumpet for
dunno
The scene moves to the cabin occupied presumably by Peter and Ellie
The windows are lighted
There is a blast from a trumpet, and as the lights go out a blanket is seen dropping to the floor, and the scene fades out
