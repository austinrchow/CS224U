Like a living wind thousand screams in agony
From the blackness, gusts of smoke pull together quickly, forming the Main Title against black: " " Then beneath it, the Roman Numeral "
" brings it toward us
And as the screams reach their sharp crescendo the title zooms through us
: 1      -                            1 Whisping smoke against a black background In the distance, through the smoke, a small object
It fans toward us quickly, filling the frame
It is an ancient skin covered volume, with the outline of a human face on it's cover
This is the Book of the Dead
Legend has it, that it was written by the dark ones: Roughly translated
The Book of the Dead
The face on the cover of the book pulls away from its skin binding and leans toward the camera on the book blink open and peer at us
It's mouth opens and emits a hideous scream
The  races into the blackness of the screaming mouth

To trace the origin of the Book, we must go back
back
to a day when spirits ruled the earth
Wispy shapes of animated ghosts move through this vortex, coming toward the  with  and and then are gone
When the seas ran red with blood

Great waves rise and swell as if before a storm
(
) It was this blood that was used to ink the book
: 4              -       4 - Through animation, the blank pages of the Book are scripted in a strange hieroglyphic by an invisible hand
Faster and faster the pages turn on the Book as the blood red ink is scrawled across them
The pages flip furiously until the Book snaps shut, reveal ing its gruesome face on the cover
The book flaps violently away from camera
(
) The Book of the Dead was last seen in 1300

(
) It was then that the dark spirits again rose up to battle the living
The ground in front of the castle begins to split apart
red glow and smoke pour from the growing crevice
Something evil is being unleashed
strong wind kicks up blowing sand in a furious rage

-                              5A - Through the blowing silt, a lone figure appears
An image of power and light
His clothing is ragged, and he holds what appears to be a jagged toothed longsword
Two massive columns of stone stand on either side
slowly moves closer, but his face is still hidden by the darkness and blowing sands
(
) It is said that a hero came from the sky
man who defeated this evi and buried the Book in the Castle of Kandar
And there it lay for 700 years

It has aged 700 years
The ox is gone
Now only its petrified skeletal remains stand in a weathered heap

Next to it rests the  , an ancient knife, its handle fashioned from the skull of a weasel
They rest upon a small pedestal covered with cobwebs
Prominently displayed on the stone wall, a bas relief of the "Hero from the Sky" holding his unusual jagged edged weapon
(
) And then
The grinding of rock scraping against rock is heard, and a large stone is swung open on a secret hinge in the wall behind the book
Wind sweeps in through the tomb, along with the blinding light from outside sharply silhouetted figure steps in the newly created doorway
The figure lights a torch that he holds, illuminating his face
This is An intelligent, grey bearded man in his late fifties
He lowers the cloth around his face that had been protecting him from the sand
He stares at the Book, awestruck
Behind him, two other figures appear in the entrance of the tomb
The first is a large school-marmish woman, the wife of Raymond Knowby,
She moves to Raymond's side and takes his hand
Immediately behind her is their daughter,  ; twenty-four years old, strong stance and beautiful
Behind her a handsome looking man,  , enters the tomb
He moves to Annie's side
They exchange excited glances

Raymond has his back to the stone wall
He is dictating into the tape recorder, sweating and distraught
It has only been a few hours since 've translated and spoke aloud the first of the demon resurrection passages from the Book of the Dead
The sound of heavy footsteps
Dust drifts down Raymond looks up to the ceiling of the cellar
It is also the floor to the main room of the cabin
He watches in horror as Henrietta's silhouette paces the floor above him
And then, the footsteps halt
And now,  fear that my wife has become host to a Kandarian demon
May God forgive me for what  have unleashed onto this earth

Ash awakens suddenly, sensing something, the shotgun clutched in his lap
He lifts his head and turns to a whispering musical sound
Harp like music
It is coming from the back bedroom of the cabin

The sound is coming from within
Suddenly, the piano begins to play by itself; Ash draws back from it
It plays a waltz
Now the piano music mixing with the harp-like strings
The radiator next to the piano begins to release bursts of musical steam, adding a wind section to this strange orchestra
156     -                                       156 As he listens to this haunting version of a waltz melody
He recognizes the music
It is the same music that Ash had played earlier, when Linda was dancing
157     -                          157 As steam spouts from the radiator pipes
As the piano keys depress and release themselves
The melody grows louder

His horror gives way to sadness
From his pocket he removes Linda's delicate silver locket that dangles from the end of a chain
In the locket's center is a magnifying glass
He stares mournfully into the glass
He looks up sharply toward the main room

He looks at the off screen carnage in terror
He begins to shake as though in shock
He trembles as he looks down at his hands; they are covered in Linda's blood
He wipes his hands on his pants and shirt, trying to rid himself of it, but only succeeds in painting himself with the stuff
Ash screams a wild scream of fear and despair
It echoes off into the night

Ash gathers his courage and reaches out his hand to halt the rocking motion
Slowly his hand approaches the chair
Just as his hand goes to touch it, the chair abruptly halts, on its own accord

It reaches out of the mirror and grabs ahold of Ash by his throat
The reflection looks like a Mr

Sweating and nasty looking

There is no sign of Ash's evil reflection
Ash has been strangling himself

The hand has taken a whitish cast
It's veins throb and pulsate
It is possessed by the evil force

The hand grabs Ash's hair and mercilessly slams his head down upon the kitchen counter again and again
Ash punches himself in the face and is sent reeling backwards
He smashes into a cupboard where dishes and plates fall upon him

The to a large meat cleaver which lies upon the wooden floor

Who's laughing now

He is cursing under his breath

The top book's title reads "Farewell to Arms"
231                                                231 Ash raises a red hot fireplace shovel that had been resting upon the coals

Red steam hisses up into frame as Ash screams

The severed wrist begins dribbling blood
Then in a burst, it too, erupts in a hellish fire hose
It spouts blood under such great pressure that  is driven against the walls of the cabin because of it

The cabin is again deadly quiet

For what, he's not sure

The trap door shuts
Ash leaps atop it

Annie turns her head to the sound and the    reveal  whose head juts in the space between the floorboards and the trap door
She is no longer possessed
She looks as she did earlier in the film
She is singing a gentle song to Annie

How can you say that to me Annie
No
You were born September 2nd, 1962 remember it well because it was snowing
So strange that it would be snowing in September

That thing in the cellar is not my mother
Ed stands sharply into her frame

She falls to the floor

383
-   -                       383 As he stands sharply into frame
His mouth wide open and screaming
384
-                          384 Terrified, as he moves toward possessed Ed with the axe
385
-                     385 Ash brings the axe down upon Ed's shoulder, knocking him to the floor
swings the axe again and again
Different colors of bile and blood fly up into frame as Ash chops
385A    -                                     385A Screaming at the sight
386     -                                       386 His axe blade rises and falls as black demon blood flies up into frame
387     -   -                    387 Ed's missing portion of his head sits upon the floor
His eye in extreme
in the foreground
It looks wildly about into the
In the background, we watch Ash bring down the axe until all is silent
388                                                 388 Jake slowly stands into the empty frame
He is in shock from what he has just seen
Annie slowly rises into frame - shaking her head in a silent "No
" Ash slowly rises into frame, terrified
They are looking down at the out-of-frame remains of possessed Ed
388A                                                    388A 389

He holds his nose
Ash tosses a bloodied sheet, containing the remains of possessed Ed to the floor
It lands with a sickening thud
Wiping his face with a rag, Ash moves off in disgust
We hold on the bundled sheet as the trap door next to it silently opens
Henrietta's rotted hand emerges, unnoticed by the others in the room
Jake,  can't take no more of this
Henrietta's rotted hand pulls the bundle of body parts silently down into the cellar and quietly closes the trap
390B                               390B Jake moves to the window and looks out
That's funny
What
That trail we came in here on
well, it just ain't there no more
Like the woods jus' swallowed it
The room goes quiet
The sound of the wind outside the cabin has died
Jake and Bobby Joe cock their heads to this new silence
391                                                     391 392     -                               392 She looks about the room, getting scared
It's so quiet
Ash stands slowly into frame
He knows that it can't be good
393     -                                   393 As they raise their heads to a distant pounding sound
It grows louder

What the hell is it
Maybe something
Something trying to force its way into our world

He holds her
The pounding sounds halt
Again they are left in silence
Annie awkwardly disengages herself from Ash
They hear a sound coming from the middle bedroom
It's in there
396     -                      396 It is opened a crack
397     -                                 397 We'll all go in together
Hell no, you're the curious one
398     -                              398 He moves toward the door
'll go with you
Ash nods to Annie in a show of thanks
He grabs the axe, and pushes open the door to the middle bedroom
Annie follows with the flickering oil lantern
399
-                            399 The door to the main room creaks open
Ash and Annie cautiously enter
They look about the place

401     -                              401 An eerie whistling wind is heard
It has an other worldly sound, very far off
401A    -                   401A Bobby Joe and Jake enter the room, drawn by the sound
401B    -                                  401B She looks about, frightened

Bobby Joe smiles, frightened
402     -                                      402 Waiting
403     -                       403 As the eerie whistling sound grows louder
It is followed by the angry sound of something moving violently about the room
shattering of glass
404                                                     404 405     -                                 405 The group is hit with a tremendous blast of air
They shiver from the cold
406     -                                      406 The wind in the room suddenly stops
He blows out his breath and watches it vaporize
The screaming face of Raymond Knowby emerges from the wall
life like spirit made of swirling smoke and mist
Annie

Your salvation lies in the pages from the Book of the Dead
The ghost of Raymond points to Annie's glass case
to it
Inside are the pages from the Book

Dispel the evil
Save my soul

Again they are hit with a blast of air
416A    -                          416A Jake, you squeezing my hand too tight
ain't got your hand, baby
Then who
Bobby Joe raises her hand into frame, to reveal Ash's Evil Hand clutched in hers
Bobby Joe goes nuts, screaming and flailing about trying to throw the hand from her
She slams into the lantern, knocking it out
We lose them in the darkness
' Somebody get the light
The sound of chairs being pushed over
The sound of a door opening and closing
417     -                                       417 As he lights the lantern illuminating the room
over to reveal only Jake and Annie

Hey

-                                     421 Screaming, Bobby Joe makes a mad dash away from the cabin
It diminishes in size behind her, she has had enough of it
422
-  -                           422 -   - As she races through the woods
423    - '                                  423 She runs deep into the woods, still looking behind her as she slams into a twisted oak tree that stops her flat
An angry face appears on the surface of the tree
Its gnarled bark folds open to reveal very human like oversized eyes
large fold in its bark opens to form a gaping mouth dripping tree sap saliva
423A    -                                  423A 424     -   - ( )             424 ' Screaming as she backs away from this living tree as a flurry of snake like vines pick themselves up off of the ground and come to life about her

433     -  '                          433 - As she drags along the forest flctor, the smaller vines force their way into Bobby Joe's nose and mouth and then under the first layer of her facial skin
433A    -  -                433A She is pulled along the ground and down into a foxhole (dummy)
Camera continues tracking along her original trajectory until we come to the second foxhole where she emerges, now covered in mud, and screaming
433B   -  - '                           433B Bobby Joe rips through spikes extending from a log and is dragged through two mud puddles
The vines wisk her away

435     -                                      435 - She glides across the surface of the swamp with a great roostertail spray of water, as if she were on water skis
436    -   -  -                    436 She hits the other side of the swamp and is rocketed out of the water and across the forest floor

She rips past

Bobby Joe's legs spread wide
The tree stump races closer
Bobby Joe
her last

And watch as a geyser of blood floods up into the night sky
441
-   -  -           441 - It falls away from the  and shatters on the table beneath us
442     -                              442 As their hands scramble at removing the pages from the bits of broken glass
443
-    -               443 Jake is looking out the boarded window of the cabin, searching for some sign of Bobby Joe
444
-                                     444 '  -    - All is silent as fog rushes in and around the woods
Where the hell is she
445
-                           445 - Jake turns to Ash
We gotta go out there and find her
If she went out in those woods, she's not coming back
Jake turns back to the window
Ash turns to Annie
He glances down at the pages that Annie is looking over
445A  '  -   -                 445A One of the pages is a clear pictorial of Ash as the "Hero from the Sky
" 445B                                             445B Ash shudders
What is it
Felt like someone just walked over my grave
It's that picture
Annie looks to it
445C    -                    445C ' "   "
445D                                             445D In 1300
This was the "Hero from the Sky," who was prophesized to destroy this Evil
He didn't do a very good job
What about the passages
446     -                                     446 As she quickly gives the pages a cursory glance
Here it is
Two passages
For the first time, she smiles at Ash
We've got it
446A - 446H                                      446A - 446H 447     -                                       447 Finally seeing his salvation, his face shows hope
447A    -                              447A Annie reads through the pages
Recitation of the first passage will make this "Dark Spirit" manifest itself in the flesh
Why the hell would we want to do that
Annie thumbs through one or two of the other pages
Recitation of the second passage creates a kind of rift in time and space, and the physical manifestation of this spirit can be forced back through this rift
to an earlier time and place
At least that's the best translation  can
448     -                              448 Annie and Ash look up to the source of the sound
449     -                                     449 He has just snapped a shell into the firing chamber of the shotgun
He points it at Ash and Annie
'm runnin' the show now
450     -                              450 Standing together, confused
450A    -                                      450A We're goin' outside into those woods to look for Bobby Joe, an' once we find her, we're gettin' the hell outta here
If you want to look for her, go ahead
You two comin' with me
ain't goin' out there alone
,
You'll kill us all
She's dead by now
With these pages we can
Jake grabs the pages from Annie's hand
Those pages don't mean shit
Jake kicks the pages down into the cellar
Ash and Annie look on in horror
'Sides
Now you ain't got no, choice
Jake pushes at Ash with the barrel of the shotgun
Now move
Ash hesitates
Move you son of a bitch

He bellows to the night
