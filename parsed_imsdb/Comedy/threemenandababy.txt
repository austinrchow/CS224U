-                                         1 On a chartered plane flying from Miami to Newark Airport
is the captain
His copilot  is seated beside him
In the passenger cabin, a female gymnastics team is celebrating a hard-won, glorious victory over the Miami team
They are singing, dancing in the aisles and drinking champagne
In the rear of the cabin, there are three regular pass- engers: a teenager, his mother, and a man who appears to be a
The plane is flying over the coastline
The partition between the cockpit and the passenger cabin is open
Jack is very excited
He can't stop turning around to look at the passengers
(to Paul) Oh my God
can't believe my eyes
Look at these women
Will you look at the gorgeous calves on them
'm telling you, give me an athlete any day
Oh God
Look at that redhead over there, and look at that one
Christ, hadn't noticed her
(miming a heart attack) Paul, 've just fallen madly in love with the most beautiful woman in the world
(totally uninterested) Oh yeah
Which one
(as though about to keel over) The blonde over there, she's too gorgeous for words
Just look at those eyes, look at those shoulders and the way she moves
'm in love
Here, take over, 'll be right back
3
Jack gets up and Paul takes his place at the controls
Jack makes his way up the aisle, through the girls who are blocking the way, to the object of his affections
She is sitting in one of the aisle seats and singing her head off
Jack leans over and whispers, quickly and intensely, to her
Hello
'm the captain of this plane
May  ask your name
Sure, my name is Jane
Why
Listen, Jane, 've seen many beautiful women in my life but swear to you, 've never, ever met a woman as exquisite as you are
Jack kneels down before her, and the Girl looks at him, amused
He takes her hand and places it over his heart
Jane, can you feel my heart
It's pounding
This is horrible, think 'm gonna faint
Listen: 'm madly in love with you, 'm single and here's my phone number
He hands her his business card
'm putting my fate in your hands
If you don't call me, you'll make me the most miserable man on earth
This is no line and 'm not trying to get you into bed
This is something completely different love you Jane and if you call me 'll be the happiest man in the entire universe -- this is 'love at first sight
' Out of all these beautiful women  noticed only you, and
The Girl laughs as Jack goes on
Meanwhile, the Busi- nessman who was seated in the rear of the plane has gotten up and walked over to Jack
Are you Paul
No, 'm not
(to Jane) 4
My name's Jack and  live in a fabulous apartment in Manhattan overlooking the park and
But you're the pilot, aren't you
Yes, 'm the pilot
(to Jane) 'm not even asking for your phone number
Isn't there a pilot whose name is Paul
(annoyed) Yeah, the copilot -- he's up front
The Businessman disappears in the direction of the cockpit
(back to Jane) 'm leaving it all up to you, Jane, but if you do give me your phone number, then Jane, then
The Businessman has reached the cockpit
(in a low tone) Are you Paul
(turning around nervously) Yeah
Are you Jim
Yeah
He hands Paul a man's purse
Here's your cash
What about the stuff
don't have it
We've got problems
Too much heat
Too 5
risky
We think the cops are on to us
Whadda ya mean us
You mean me
mean shut up and listen
Two guys will be waiting for you in a black -Bird, expecting the dope
Just ignore them
It'll be delivered to you on Sunday and picked up the following Thursday, okay
But  won't be home, 'll be in the air for two weeks
That's your problem
Make arrangements, a deal's a deal
Got it
Got it
Jack returns
(bursting with excitement) got her phone number
She gave me her phone number
That's some magnificent view, isn't it
It's wonderful -- Life is wonderful
The Businessman goes back to his seat and Jack grabs hold of the microphone
This is your captain speaking
In honor of your victory, in honor of your beauty, and in honor of Jane, the most beautiful gymnast  have ever met
'm going to give you a little demonstration of aviation gymnastics -- reserved only for the most important guest, hip, hip
Everyone shouts "
" except for Paul and the 6
Businessman, who remain grim
Jack dips the plane very low over the water and skims the cliffs along the coast
It is a beautiful, impressive stunt
There are gleeful shouts in the cabin among the passengers
2
-   -               2 Jack is saying an emotional goodbye to Jane as she leaves with her teammates
Jane finds it all very funny, but Jack looks totally wretched seeing her go
Jack and Paul walk toward the exit
God, what a woman
Paul is nervous, glancing uneasily from car to car
Wanna share a cab
Paul Yeah, sure
black Ford pulls up in front of them and its driver looks at Paul who immediately turns his back on him
She's so beautiful
've never been so in love before
Can you believe she gave me her phone number
Oh, Christ -- where is it
Oh, no, don't tell me lost it
It's a matter of life and death
Oh here it is -- thank God
All the while    Jack has been rambling on, a beige car on the other    side of the street has slowed down
Paul notices it
In the beige car, a narcotics agent, , is behind the    wheel with one of his colleagues sitting beside him
They're slowing down
Take a picture
The colleague snaps a picture of everyone who happens to be standing near the black Ford, including Jack and Paul
The black Ford pulls out
The beige car follows it
Paul observes all this out of the corner of his eye
Listen,  need a favor,  got 7
a little problem
Yeah, sure
Hey, look, will you -- look at that sparkling beauty
very beautiful woman is coming down the walkway with cart overflowing with luggage
One of them falls off
Yeah
mean, it's like
There's this little package
She'll never make it with all that luggage she's got
gotta give her a hand
Look at the colors in her hair
Christ, 've never seen a woman like her before
He's about to walk off when Paul grabs him by the arm
Jack, listen, can
Sure you can, no problem
Listen,  gotta go now, 'm gonna see if she'll share a cab with me
You take the shuttle, okay
But  gotta explain to you about
Come over to my place tonight
We're having a huge party
Come around 9, okay
See ya later
Jack races toward the woman and begins to help her with the fallen luggage
We see him talking to her and we can hear a little of what he's saying
As exquisite as you are
think 'm gonna faint
He kneels, takes her hand and puts it over his heart
The young woman is flabbergasted
lonely-looking Paul hails the shuttle bus

3
-                                     3 large, stylishly decorated apartment in Manhattan
tremendous living room
party's going on
Very is
The lights are dim
There are about 30 guests
Lots of young pretty women
Gourmet buffet
People are sitting on couches talking, others are eating, drinking or dancing
In a dimly-lit corner, Jack is kneeling before a girl sitting in an armchair
She is laughing as she listens to him
(whispering passionately) This is no line and 'm not trying to get you into bed
This is something completely different
This is 'love at first sight
' Oh, 'm so happy
Let me go get you a glass of champagne
'll be right back
Jack gets up and goes over to the buffet
As soon as he's out of the girl's line of sight, he starts running toward the other end of the apartment
On the way he passes , who's deeply engrossed in a vehement conversation about modern art with a girl called
They're fighting like cats and dogs but seem to be enjoy- ing it
Are you saying that's art, are you really saying that's art
Well then you explain why
It goes back to prehistoric man
They had comic strips on their walls, for God's sake
(whispering in Michael's ear) 'm having a hard time
'm working on two at once
(very interested) Oh yeah, who
The brunette in the armchair in the living room -- her name's Rosalie
9
And the other one
Clementine -- she's waiting for me in the den
He moves away towards the den
(to Sophia) Wait one second for me, 'll be right back
Michael walks off in the direction of Rosalie
Paul is wandering among the guests, trying to find Jack, he sees  who is talking with another young woman, Peter is nodding, idly looking around, com- pletely uninterested in the conversation
You guys have a beautiful place here
But the rent must be a killer
Peter isn't paying attention
Isn't it a killer
What
(') Oh,    the rent
yeah, it's high but    split between the three of us    it isn't that bad, as long as    we don't eat
Nicole laughs
Hi Peter, 'm looking for Jack, have you seen him
Oh hi, Paul, how are you doing
Yeah, sure, 'll take you to Jack
(to Nicole) Excuse me for a minute
They move away
You're a lifesaver, 've been trying to get away from that woman 10
for 20 minutes
That sonofabitch Carl is moving in on my Natalie
Gotta go
bye
Wait -- What about Jack
(in a hurry) He's around somewhere
Check under all the couches
Paul walks off in Jack's direction
We   Peter, who reaches Natalie
She is talking with a very styl- ishly-dressed, tall, young man,
Oh Natalie, 've been looking for you all night
All night
just saw you deep in conversation with Nicole
Deep
Hell no, we were just talking shop
Oh come on Peter, we all know what a ladies' man you are
Who, me
Jack's the ladies' man, not me
You're the only lady 'm after
(interrupting) So tell me, how's your project coming along
heard you're not ready yet
We've still got two weeks left before the semi-finals
We'll be ready
We've been ready for three days now
We're gonna kick your ass
Their project is really incredible
Oh really
You've seen it
11
(smiling broadly at Carl) No, it's top secret but he's been telling me about it
(in a bad mood) Ours is incredible too
If you ever get it finished
Paul comes up to Jack, who is kneeling before Clementine, whispering passionate sweet nothings in her ear
It appears he's gotten beyond the "This is love at first sight" stage
He's getting down to the nitty-gritty now
Clementine is thrilled
Paul taps Jack on the shoulder
Jack, can  talk to you for a second
Oh, hi, Paul, yeah sure
(') (to Clementine) Please darling, don't move
'll be right back, okay
'll bring us back some champagne
He disappears with Paul
You're a lifesaver, Paul thought 'd never get away
Rosalie's waiting for me in the living room
Isn't she terrific
Who
Rosalie
Clementine
Oh yeah, for sure,  dunno
Listen, can you do me a favor
With some difficulty, Paul follows Jack as he picks his way through the people dancing, heading in Rosalie's direction
12
Yeah
What kind of favor
Damn, 've got to get her a glass of champagne
Listen, 've got a little problem
'm having a valuable package delivered to me on Sunday, but 'm not going to be home
've got to do the Hawaii-Tahiti-Australia route, so can  have the package delivered here instead
(filling a glass with champagne) Yeah, sure, of course
(he stops, thinking) No, wait, 'm leaving for South America tomorrow
'll be gone for three weeks
(') But it's okay
Peter and Michael will be here
They'll take care of it
Will you be sure to tell them about it
Absolutely
Don't worry about a thing
It'll be delivered Sunday and picked up next Thursday, okay
Delivered Sunday picked up Thursday
Got it
No problem
This is a very delicate matter, Jack
It's very important they don't tell anybody about this package
It could be very
uh, embarrassing for me, you know what 'm saying
Sure
You got it
'll see you later
13
Jack is about to rejoin Rosalie
Paul grabs his arm
Not to anyone at all
Tell them that, okay
Okay, sure, not to anyone at all
Look, 'm sorry Paul, but gotta get back to Rosalie
Now go have a good time
'll take care of everything
Bye and thanks a lot
Don't mention it
Paul leaves
Jack finally reaches the armchair where Rosalie is sitting
He stops short, obviously disappointed
Uh-oh
Too late
Michael is sitting next to Rosalie, right next to her
They get up to dance
As he passes Jack, Michael smiles broadly
All's fair, old buddy
Jack watches a moment, then breaks into a wide smile
(singing) Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling Clementine
Jack whirls around and heads back towards Clementine
4
-    -                    4 The guests are leaving
Commotion in the hall, people are saying goodbye to Peter and Michael
Natalie is about to walk out
Natalie, why don't you stay for a nightcap
No, 've gotta get up early
14
(to Natalie) Do you care to share a cab
Oh yes, thanks -- that's really nice of you
(smiling triumphantly; to Peter) Good night, Peter
(with a forced smile) Good night, Carl
'll call you Sunday, Natalie
She has already left
The door closes on the last of the departing guests
So you struck out again with Natalie, huh
That Carl is a real smooth operator
He's an asshole
(mimicking Carl) ' heard you're not ready yet
' 'We're gonna kick your ass
' Well, we may be behind schedule, but we're still going to beat that sonofabitch and maybe  haven't scored with Natalie yet, but neither has he
She's not an easy lay, that's what  like about her
You know what they say: it ain't over till it's over
Peter and Michael go into the living room
Peter is picking up glasses
Michael is emptying ashtrays into the wastebasket
Well,  didn't do so well either --  blew it with Rosalie don't even know how
Who's Rosalie
That beauty  managed to swipe 15
from Jack
was about to ask her to stay the night when
Your old friend Sophia appeared and got you involved in a thrilling conversation about modern art, and meanwhile Rosalie
How could you know that
Michael, all you want to do is steal Jack's girl friends
You don't give a shit about the women themselves
That's not true
It's just that Sophia drives me crazy
She knows all the right buttons to push to make me mad
(going into the kitchen) Anyway, it was a great party, everyone had a good time
(still in the living room, shouting to Peter) Terrific
time
He, too, leaves the living room and runs into Jack, who has his arm around Clementine's waist as he heads toward his bedroom with her
5
-                                      5 In the kitchen Peter is straightening up
Michael joins him, dumping the ashes
Peter begins washing the glasses
Where's Jack
Did he leave
No, he's cuddling up with a blonde named Clementine
That's not Clementine
saw him doing his famous routine with Christie
16
No, it is Clementine, the one with the tits this big
Christie's got tits that big, too
Yeah, but he was with Christie at the beginning of the evening -- after that he was with Rosalie and then with Clementine
And since  stole Rosalie away from him
Are you following this
'm not
Jack enters the kitchen in very high spirits, singing
Nice work if you can get it, and you can get it if you try
Any scotch left
Yeah, here,  just put it away
Sorry  can't give you guys a hand, but 've got something cooking
thought you were leaving at dawn for South America
am, the night's still young
It's gonna be a lively one
'm gonna make us a little snack
He makes up a tray with sandwiches
So, who is it anyway -- Christie or Clementine
Maxine
Beautiful, enchanting Maxine
Peter and Michael look at one another surprised, mouthing silently, "Maxine
" 17
Hey, Michael -- how'd it go with Rosalie
Well, things were going great until
Your old friend Sophia appeared and dragged you into a thrilling conversation about modern art and in the meantime Rosalie took off with someone else
How did you know
dunno -- lucky guess
Well,  don't give a damn anyway, have 24 drawings to hand in to my editor three days from now and gotta work all night anyway
So it was all for the best
But you better not leave that Maxine's phone number lying around because when 'm done
Don't worry, 'll leave you her phone number on the hall table
If she's really terrific 'll put a big '' next to it
'Bye, guys -- love ya
won't wake you tomorrow morning
See you in three weeks
6
-                                        6 Jack and Maxine noiselessly exit the   apartment
Jack is wearing his pilot's uniform
Maxine    pushes the button for the elevator
Jack sneaks back    into the apartment and leaves a note on the hall table   that says: "Maxine 227-2013
" Next to the number Jack    has put a big "
" 7
-                     7 Jack and Maxine exchange a brief kiss and go their separate ways

-                             8 18
Jack is in the cockpit with his copilot,
The are
Jack is checking gauges
He looks out the window idly and sees: The crew of another plane walking across the tarmac
Paul is one of the crew
Paul sees Jack and begins to gesture wildly, but his voice is drowned out by the noise of the
Just seeing Paul is enough to remind Jack about his package
Damn
forgot to tell them about the package
(to Ron) gotta make a quick phone call
'll be right back
(knowingly) Jack, there'll be plenty of girls where we're going
Oh, c'mon, 've really got to make a phone call
What do you think 'm going to do, pick up one of the New Jersey delegates to the
convention
Jack walks back towards the phone
As he walks we see that the plane is filled with ugly, boring businessmen
9
-                             9 In the architecture firm of which Peter is one of three partners
The whole staff, about 15 people in all, is gathered around a large model, the project for a big amusement park
They all seem worried about something
, one of Peter's partners, seems particularly angry
The model's not finished, the blueprints are a mess and you may as well forget the specs, they're a disaster
know we're talented
know we're good
Then why is it we can never get organized
Why is it we're always behind schedule
Look, Jerry, architects since Leonardo have always been behind schedule
It's a tradition, for 19
God's sake
Why break with tradition
Because this is the chance of a lifetime for our company, and there happens to be a deadline
There are millions of dollars at stake here
And our main competition had their project in three days ago
Yeah, but word around town is their project's a piece of shit
Of course, it's a piece of shit, but it's a ready piece of shit
We're just going to have to buckle down, that's all
You're damn right we are
Starting now, everybody works around the clock
Everybody
We have two weeks to be ready for the semi- final selection
And we will be ready
And we will win
You want to know why we'll win
Because we're gonna cheat
'll go bribe the judges
don't think this is a joking matter, gentlemen
Come on, Jerry
enters
There's an urgent call for you, Peter
'm not in
20
It's Jack -- he says it's 'super important
' Peter picks up the phone
Hi
yeah
listen, make it quick, 'm in a meeting here
yeah, a package
okay
someone'll drop it off Sunday and pick it up Thursday
No problem
yeah
we'll put it aside, okay
no, no, we won't tell anybody about it
Is that it
Right, we won't tell anyone
Hey -- love 'n' kisses to the Brazilian girls, vaya con dios, old buddy
Peter hangs up, laughing
Jerry gives him a dirty look
What
10
-                                          10 Peter, dressed in casual clothes, knocks on the door of Michael's room, and peeks in
Michael is asleep fully clothed on his bed
His drawing table is strewn with papers, overflowing ashtrays and empty coffee cups
The lamp is still on
'm going out for bagels -- how many you want, three or four
(opening one eye) What time is it
Eleven-thirty
or
'mon, up 'n' at 'em
Up 'n' at 'em yourself, asshole --  just went to bed
21
Did you finish
Nah,  didn't get anywhere
Well then
nap time's over
Back to work
So how many bagels, three or four
Six, six
He buries his head under the pillow
11
-                             11 Peter opens the front door, he stumbles over an object, looks down; at his feet he sees a wicker basket lined with pretty pink-and-white checked gingham
In the basket a tiny baby lies fast asleep, her head gently resting on a lace pillow
Peter looks at this object in amazement
There is an envelope pinned to the basket with the words, " " written on it
Peter picks up the letter -- he opens it and reads
(to himself) You gotta be kidding
Abruptly he turns and races back to Michael's room
Michael
Michael
(still groggy) What
Get your ass out here and see what's on the doorstep
(mutters) This has gotta be somebody's idea of a joke
They run to the front door
What is it
Look for yourself
It's a basket with a baby in it
22
No shit
(reads Michael the letter) 'Dearest Jack, here is the fruit of our love
Take good care of her
have to go to Europe and Japan for six months, her name is Mary
Good luck, Love, Sylvia
' What are we going to do with it
Give it back to her mother, that's what
But it says she went to Europe
Well, we'll see about that, d'you have her phone number
Whose phone number
The girl's
Sylvia's
Why the hell would  have her number
've never even heard of this chick
You mean you don't know who she is
No way
If  had to keep track of all Jack's girlfriends, 'd have to be a full-time secretary
Well, what are we gonna do
Hey, look, she's waking up
Hey, look, she's crying
Oh no, this can't be happening
She's not gonna start to cry now
23
Uh-oh, now she's really crying
What's her problem
Maybe she's hungry
Well, what are we s'posed to do
Feed her,  guess
Yeah, but what
Soft stuff
guess
(exploding) Oh no,  swear to God this is unreal
Can you believe that bastard Jack
' little package,' he tells me on the phone, 'just put it aside till Thursday
' Put it aside -- can you believe him
Really
Jack said that
Yeah and he also said 'don't tell anyone about it -- anyone at all
' Oh, so he told you about this
Yeah, he told me a package would be coming today, but he didn't say it'd be this
(very angrily) Boy, he's got a helluva nerve
Just listen to the racket she's making
What are we s'posed to do
(brilliant idea) Let's call Jack's mother
24
She lives in Miami for Christsake
She can't stop the baby crying from Miami
Well, just to ask her advice
No, he said not to tell anyone
But this is an emergency
No
No way
You know what a pain that woman is -- she'll be on the next plane here to move in with us
Maybe  should call my mother
No, please -- leave the mothers out of this, okay
It's only four days
We should be able to handle that, besides you know the rule around here: it's fine to have a woman over once in a while, but
Michael finishes the sentence in unison with him
never for more than one night at a time
And that includes mothers
Peter steps over the basket and heads towards the elevator
Where are you going
'm going to the store to buy some baby food
What am  supposed to do while you're gone
Pick her up and hold her
25
(panic-stricken) Whaddya mean, pick her up
've never held a baby -- 'll drop her
Peter is already gone
12
-                                            12 Peter enters the store and rushes right over to a store What aisle's baby food on
Down there by the meat section
Peter heads for it purposefully
When he    gets to the right aisle, he stops short, taken aback:    a vast range of products extends before him
He starts    examining the baby food jars and cans of formulas, going   from one to the next, not knowing where to begin
13
-                                          13 Michael is still in the hall holding Mary very clumsily in his arms
He is anxious
He realizes she's soaked
This disgusts him
He holds her at arm's length; she squirms
He goes and gets a towel from the bathroom, spreads it out on the living room couch and lays the baby down on it
-- she much prefers Michael's arms to the couch
panicky Michael picks her up again, grumbling
Okay, okay, don't cry like that
'll hold you, 'll hold you
He tries rather unsuccessfully to wrap the towel around the child
Obviously Michael is very put off by the smell coming from Mary
14
-                                            14 Peter is talking with a Safeway , a woman in her 50's, who is tall and heavy, somewhat gruff and masculine in appearance, and wearing slacks and a smock
So what's the best brand
26
Depends on what your pediatrician recommends
Oh right, the pediatrician
But which one sells the most
(pointing to a can) This kind
Oh, so this is the best kind
It's the cheapest
Then it's the worst kind
They're all good, sir
(pointing to another can) Oh, okay, then  can take this kind
It's got iron in it
Oh
Is that good or bad
It's very good
Well, why don't they all have iron in them
Some babies are allergic to iron
(pointing to yet another can) Oh, okay, well 'll take this kind then
That kind doesn't have any milk in it
27
Oh,  see, there's milk with no milk in it
Some babies are allergic to milk
So what's the stuff that no babies are allergic to
Soy formula
Oh, okay, 'll take the soy formula
He takes a can
That one's Advance
Oh really
What's Advance
How old's your baby
(Peter tries to estimate Mary's size) Uh
about this old
15
-                                     15 is  in Michael's arms as he walks her up and down the whole apartment
Now there are three towels wrapped around her
Michael is exasperated
He angrily sings her a lullaby
Rock-a-bye baby on the tree top
(') Stop crying now; c'mon, stop
quit it, will you
When the wind blows, the cradle will rock
What is that jerk doing
Milking the cows or something
When the bough breaks the cradle will fall
only
28
16
-                                          16 Now Peter is surrounded by three women arguing: The Store Clerk standing with her arms crossed and haughtily looking down on everyone; an efficient, practical sort of young woman ( #1); and another thin, pale woman whose baby is lying in a baby carrier in her shopping cart and who seems very nervous ( #2)
#1 Does she have any teeth yet or not
That would give us a clue as to how old she is
haven't looked
(coolly disagree- ing; to Woman #1) My grandson's only five months old and he already has two teeth
But my daughter didn't have a single one at seven months -- so, y'know, how many teeth they have
doesn't mean a thing
#2 But didn't those friends of yours tell you what formula they usually give the baby
(embarrassed) No, actually they had to leave unexpectedly
They had to catch a plane
#1 (to Peter) Is she teething
Teething
#1 Does she drool
Does she cry all night long
Does she chew on her fists
Does she put everything into her mouth
She acts out her words
know she can't talk
#2 29
But didn't those friends of yours tell you how old she was
(as Woman #2 is starting to get on his nerves) told you they had to leave unexpectedly
#1 Or else you could weigh her; that would tell you how old she is
See, my five-month-old grandson weighs more than my neighbor's grandson and he's nine months old
So, y'know, how much they weigh
doesn't mean a thing
So what about me
What should buy
#2 Didn't they even tell you the pediatrician's name
(still calm) No
They didn't
#2 You sure have weird friends
You have no idea how weird
#1 Or else her hair
Does she have lots of hair
My grandson, y'know, he has so much hair you can make a ponytail with it
And  know some kids who are totally bald at a year- and-a-half
So, y'know, how much hair they have
doesn't mean a thing
#1 (sarcastic) Gee, he's really something, your grandson -- is he good at math too
30
Peter starts to pick cans off the shelf
Look, ladies, thanks for all the advice
But  think 'll just take one of each
To be on the safe side
(to Peter) Don't forget -- if the baby's less than three months old, you have to be sure to sterilize the bottles
Peter stops and turns back
What bottles
#2 You know what
This must be a kidnapping

-                                       17 Michael is rapidly    pacing up and down the apartment, vigorously rocking    Mary
As soon as he sits down anywhere to rest,     , so Michael pops back up and begins the    marathon all over again
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb, if that jerk isn't back in three seconds swear 'll throw her down the garbage chute
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb
The
Well, it's about goddamn time
He hurries towards the door, grabs the knob and throws it open
Where the hell have you been
He stops
Before him stands the apartment , Mrs
Razzolini, a squat little woman with a moustache
Oh -- Hi, Mrs
Razzolini
31
This package came for you
Oh
What a cute little baby
Is it yours
No, it's not me,  mean she's not mine
Oh, so it's Peter's
No, no, it's Jack's,  mean it's not Jack's, it's
someone loaned it to us,  mean someone
And what's the little girl's name
Mary
Ooh, what a pwetty wittle name, Mary
didn't know you had a baby
Yeah, well,  have to put her to bed now
You have to put her to bed
Where's Mary's mommy
She's
she's not here
She'll be back soon
Michael starts to close the door
She pushes it back open and holds out the package
Oh here, this just came for you
They just dropped it off
Can hold her for a second
Well, like, y'see
she doesn't like to be held by strangers
The apartment Manager has already given Michael the package and grabbed Mary
She covers her with kisses
Mary smiles
Michael absent-mindedly looks at the package
32
She loves to be held by strangers
Hey, she's soaking wet hmm, no think it's number 2
Want me to give you a hand changing her
Oh no, don't worry, 'm used to it
(faking a smile) Well, so long, Mrs
Razzolini
'Bye, Mary, 'll come back to visit
Mrs
Razzolini regretfully hands the baby back
No sooner is  back in Michael's arms than she her head off
He closes the door; his smile instantly fades
What a leech
And that other idiot isn't back yet
He throws the package onto an armchair in the hall
So you love to be held by strangers, do you
18
-                                          18 In the baby food aisle there are now five women arguing
Peter, his arms still laden with cans, looks uncomfort- able
#2 This guy doesn't even know how old his baby is and you don't find that strange
#1 This guy asked for advice,   'm giving him advice, Okay
If you're so paranoid, why don't you   run home and chain your kid to   his crib
#2 Anyway,  think someone should call the cops
#1 33
The cops, the cops --  bet you call the cops every time your cat pisses on the carpet
Peter slips away
19
-                                       19 Peter comes in with bags in his arms
Michael, holding the baby, dashes toward him, extremely pissed off
What the hell were you doing
You've been gone for hours
This damn kid's been crying the whole time
've got a lot better things to do with my time
You're a real pain in the ass
(flabbergasted) Hey, how dare you speak to me like that
You've never spoken to me like that before
Well, what the hell took   you so long
What'd you do, go    out for breakfast or something
didn't even have time for a cup   of coffee, for chrissakes
Will you please cut it out for a second, huh
didn't have any coffee either, it took me forever at the goddamn Safeway
Okay, well, here -- take the kid, 've got work to do
Whaddaya mean, take the kid can't hold her and make her bottle at the same time
And why should be the one to hold her
'Cause, it's your problem
You found this kid
Hey, asshole, 'm the one who found 34
her because 'm the one who was gonna get you some bagels for your breakfast, and
Jesus, there she goes again
We gotta feed her something
Yeah, well you just don't feed a baby
First you gotta look and see if she has any teeth or not
Why
To figure out how old she is so we know what to feed her, that's why
Peter attempts to look into Mary's mouth but she squirms
Do you look on top or bottom
How do  know
Try feeling with your finger
Peter slides his finger over Mary's gums
can't feel anything -- 'll give her the stuff for newborns and hope she's not allergic to it
Peter starts off toward the kitchen, Michael follows
And then we'll    have to  see if she's allergic    to iron,  to soy or to milk --    you can't  imagine how much stuff    they can  be allergic to
She's soaking wet -- did you buy any diapers
Diapers
35
(furious) Figures
'll take care of this, it'll save time
He sticks Mary in Peter's arms, right on top of the bags, and storms out
19A
-                                          19A Michael rushes in and stops short in front of the moun- tains of diaper boxes that he starts examining in bewil- derment
Finally, he approaches the Store Clerk
Excuse me, miss, could you tell me which diapers are the most absorbent
would suggest the ones that say 'ultra-absorbent
' Yeah, but which are better:    20-35 pounds or 12-24 pounds
(suspiciously) Depends how much your baby weighs
Oh right, how much she weighs
(threateningly) You wouldn't happen to have a friend who came in here a little while ago, would you
Michael grabs just any box of diapers
have no idea what you're talking about
He's no friend of mine
Michael takes off very, very quickly
20
-                                          20 Mary, in Peter's arms, is devouring her bottle
Oh shit, my slacks
Goddamn her, she took a crap
36
21
-                           21 Peter and Michael have laid Mary down on the couch, taking care to place several towels between her bottom and the immaculate velvet
Mary is squirming, laughing, feeling great
They have already gone through half a box of cotton in their attempts to clean up the crap
But it's still all over, on their hands, on the baby's feet and legs, on the towels, etc
Hold her
Hold her, goddamn it
can't hold her
This kid's out of control here
Just gimme the cotton
Michael lets go of Mary's feet and she sticks them back in the crap
Oh for chrissake, don't just let go of her
Then get the cotton yourself if you don't want me to let go of her
Peter grabs a huge wad of cotton
Take the towels off -- They're full of shit
But the couch'll get dirty
Yeah, but she keeps getting it all over herself
Man, this shit is sticky
We need cleaning fluid or something to get it off
How 'bout after-shave
Are you kidding
Waste our Saint Laurent on babyshit
Okay, let's just put the diaper 37
on and the hell with it
Right
Michael hands him a diaper
Peter tries to figure out how it goes on
These tape things -- do they go on the front or the back
How am  supposed to know
Peter tries to slide the diaper under Mary's backside but she squirms and kicks it off with her feet
Hold her under her arms -- 'm gonna try it this way
Michael holds Mary under    her armpits
Peter tries to put the diaper on her
It's     hard
What's     more, it would seem that Michael didn't    buy the right    size -- The diaper comes all the way    up to Mary's    chin
What the hell kind of lousy stinking diapers did you get
They're way too big
don't think they're too big -- They're ultra-absorbent
That's all
The more absorbent the better
Peter has more or less managed to adjust the diaper
How the hell do these tape things work
Hold her for chrissakes
My arms are getting tired
There
got it
He tapes the diaper closed
Damn it
didn't make it tight enough
38
He tapes the other side:   the diaper gapes and sags
It's not working
What about laying her down
Go ahead
No, not on the towels, they're all covered with crap
Michael lays Mary down right on the couch
Peter vigor- ously undoes the tape, and the whole  lining apart
What the hell is this friggin' mess
Oh, man, this is unbelievable
To think, they bombard us day and night with their goddamn  commercials
And will you look at this junk
This stuff is pure shit -- You tape it closed, it sags, you undo the tape: bingo -- the whole goddamn thing falls apart
(taking another diaper) Well, whaddya expect, if you pull on it like an ape, it's gonna rip
Michael, will you give me a break, will you please
Peter takes the torn diaper off
utters a and pees copiously all over the velvet couch
(exploding) Oh shit
Now she's pissing
Look at the couch
The sneaky little bitch was just waiting for me to get the diaper off, then whammo
Mary gives them a big smile
happen to like my furniture
'm going out to get some real diapers
You can clean the couch up in the meantime
He exits, slamming the door

No,  don't know exactly where he is, but he was supposed to be flying the Miami-Caracas-Rio route
The guy who proposed to you
Oh, did he
Well, congratulations
Please
listen to me
you must contact him and tell him he's got to call home immediately
Okay
It's an emergency, a family problem
No, don't worry, he's not married to someone else
It's another kind of family 40

Of course he still loves you
But he's been really busy lately
So anyway, please try to get in touch with him, it's real important

Good
Thanks

In silence

Or maybe she's hungry again
Already

Oh shit, she's soaking wet again

stormy argument is going on
Oh no you're not, you're not gonna leave me alone with her
told you --  have a date
You rotten bastard -- do you see me going out on any dates
Look, it's with Natalie -- 've been after her for months already
So what
If you leave me alone with this kid,  swear 'll pack up and be outta here by morning
You're a real drag, y'know
Tonight was gonna be my big night
Now  bet it's gonna be Carl's big night

He exits, violently slamming the door behind him
Michael sits back down, grumbling

'  -                                     44 Peter is making a phone call
He has Mary in his arms
He's in a foul mood
Hello, Natalie
It's Peter
Listen, 'm really screwed
Jerry just called and we've run into a snag with the blueprints for the competition, it's an emergency
've gotta go over to the office right away,  think it's gonna be an all-nighter
Of course didn't know about this yesterday -- he just called me
Mary reaches out and begins to jab the buttons on the phone
Peter pulls her back
Hello
Hello
No, 'm not trying to hang up on you
We're having some problems with the phone, that's all
No, Natalie, there's no one else here
You're the only woman

'  -                                      48 Peter is talking on the phone
He has Mary in his arms
(on the phone) Jerry, hi, it's Peter
Listen, 've run into some problems, can't make it today
(holding the receiver at arm's length from his ear) Hey, take it easy, will you
'm sick
Seriously ill
'm burning up
The doctor had to come, 've gotta stay in bed till Friday
(shouting to drown out Jerry shouting) Hey, hey, hey, 'll work round the clock all weekend long
swear, Jerry,  am not lying to you
49
-                                         49 Peter, wearing a coat, enters carrying packages that he puts down in the living room, now transformed into a nursery
makeshift changing table, rubber wash basin, baby clothes, baby lotion, talcum powder, soap and baby shampoo, etc
are all over the place
He drops all his purchases on the floor, sits down on the couch and picks up a book, in which he's instantly absorbed: we see from the cover that it's a book on children
50
'  -                                      50 Peter is lying on his bed now surrounded by dozens of baby-care books
Many of which are open
He's reading them with great passion, and making notes
51
'  -                                    51 Michael is sitting on the floor surrounded by his drawings
Mary is lying next to him
(on the phone) 'm terribly sorry, Mr
Oxman, but 've run into a few problems, won't be able to bring you the drawings tomorrow morning as 44
promised
In fact, it won't be until the day after tomorrow at the soonest
Michael sees Mary kick over a bottle of india ink over his drawings
He winces
(into phone) On second thought, Mr
Oxman
uh, better make that the end of next week
(shouting on the other end) Please don't get upset, Mr
Oxman
'll do everything possible to get them to you sooner
You have my word
apologize again, Mr
Oxman
Thank you again, Mr
Oxman

53
-                                   53 Peter and Michael are asleep in their bathrobes on the living room couches
Peter has a child care book over his face
, in her basket, wakes up and utters a
The two men jump up and go over to her basket like robots
Mary looks at them and smiles
54
-                                       54 Michael is giving her night feeding
Mary is falling asleep in his arms; the nipple falls out of her mouth, which goes on sucking anyway
Michael is falling asleep, too, his head lolling over to one side
55
-                                     55 The living room is back to normal, spic 'n' span
They've gotten rid of all the baby paraphernalia
The 45
basket is on one of the couches
Mary is asleep
On the basket are warm clothes for outdoors, a bonnet and a coat, a full bottle, cans of formula, toilet articles, and a pile of diapers
Seated on the couches facing each other, Peter and Michael are waiting for something
He didn't say what time
All he said was Thursday
Terrific
-- We could rot here till eight o'clock tonight
Well, 'm prepared to rot here till midnight if  have to, as long as we get rid of her
Jack really could have called
He has to have gotten our message by now
Well, when he does call, 'm gonna let him have it
That sonofabitch is on the beaches of Brazil proposing to the whole goddamn world
And we're here living in hell
He's gonna get his ass on the next plane back here
Vacation's over, Jack-baby, you better believe it
(angrily) Damn right
(beat softer) It's almost time for her bottle, you know
Oh hell

-                                       56 On the street two men drive by on a motorcycle looking at the numbers on the apartment buildings
They stop a few yards from the entrance to Peter, Michael and Jack's building
46
They are being followed by the beige Chevy that pulls ahead of them and parks just beyond them
In this car we recognize Graton sitting with a partner
The two men, who look like young tough guys (punks), get off their motorcycle and disappear into the lobby of the building
Graton gets out of his car    and heads for the building
He glances into the lobby,    then goes in
He watches the elevator floor indicator,    notes the floor it stops on, then calmly returns to his    car

Michael springs up and runs to open the door
Peter follows him
On the    doorstep stand the
One of them is short    and speaks with a heavy Brooklyn accent
The other,    tall, thin and creepy-looking, stands behind his buddy    and doesn't speak
#1 Jack Collins live here
Yes, he does
#1 We came for the package
Package
Oh that's cute, referring to her as a package
Anyway, you can tell Sylvia she's a lousy stinking bitch
#1 Sylvia
Yeah, Sylvia
You can tell her she's got a hell of a nerve dumping her problems into our laps
#1 (nervously) Problems
Did you guys have trouble
(sarcastically) 47
He wants to know if we had trouble
Do you have any idea what it's been like around here for the past four days
She could have at least given us a phone number or the name of someone to contact
#1 (surprised) don't get it
Didn't they tell you we were gonna be here today
Sure they told us
So what
That doesn't make the last four days any less hellish than they were
Well, anyway, they're here now, that's all that matters
Peter turns and walks toward the basket
The next bottle's in 45 minutes
made it already
It's in the basket
#1 Bottle
Whadda ya mean, bottle
About an hour after her bottle, she starts yawning
Put her to bed right away or it's pure hell for the next three hours, at least that's what we've noticed
Peter has returned with the basket
The Punks look at the baby, their eyes wide with disbelief
#1 What the hell is that
baby
(sarcastic) No, it's a very short teenager
Of course it's a baby
Now listen carefully: 'm giving you a can of the milk she's been getting
She loves it, and more importantly, 48
she's not allergic to it
even put a can of the same brand in here for you, but in powdered form, understand
Punk #1 hears "powder" and catches on
#1 Oh
get it
Powdered milk
Very clever
Yeah, right
real clever
Okay, here
She's all yours
Good luck
He hands them the basket
Punk #1 grabs the handles
#1 Okay,  got it
You can take her out now
Take what out
'm not taking anything out
#1 Wait a minute,  don't get it
We take the basket and the milk, that's all
We ain't gonna take the
what's inside
Whadda ya mean, what's inside
You take it all, man
It's a package deal
#1 But what are we s'posed to do with it
How do  know
You take it where they told you to take it
#1 'mean,  take it to the connection
Yeah, whatever you want to call it
#1 Are you sure that's the plan
49
You bet that's the plan
We're not keeping her one more second
#1 Okay, if that's the plan
He passes the basket to Punk #2 #1 Here, hold this
Okay, so long
They start to leave, pressing the elevator button
(suddenly a little worried) Uh
listen
maybe you could leave us the address or the phone number just in case
So we can find out how she's doing
The Punks exchange a puzzled glance
#1 Oh, yeah, sure, the address
(feebly searching his pockets) Oh shit,  don't have it on me
But 'll call you
Okay, so long
& So long
The elevator has arrived
The Punks quickly slip inside it with the basket
Michael closes the door
Peter plops down in the armchair by the front door
Aah, relief at last
Good riddance
You said it
Now maybe  can get some work done
He disappears in the direction of his room
Peter is sitting    on something hard
He pulls it out from under him, it's    a package
He looks at it, casually reading: "Care     of Jack Collins
" He tosses it to the side
Suddenly,     it dawns on him
He leaps up, grabs the package and    runs into Michael's room
50
58
'  -                                58 (holding the package) What the hell is this
Well, a package,  guess
Was this package delivered to you
Yeah, why
Peter raises his voice, exasperated by Michael's calm attitude
When the hell did this package arrive
Will you quit shouting
(screaming even louder) When did this fucking package fucking arrive, Michael
don't know
Oh yeah, Sunday -- Mrs
Razzolini brought it up
Holy shit
What's the matter
This is the package those guys came for, not the baby, you asshole
Hey, asshole yourself
Oh shit
Peter nods and begins to bark orders
Look out the window and see if you see them, 'm gonna try to 51
catch up with them
Michael runs to the window
Peter runs like a madman through the apartment out the front door
He presses the button for the elevator
It's in use
Goddamit
He opens the door leading to the stairs and races down them, holding on to the bannister
He flies, overwhelmed by anxiety
Suddenly he trips, loses his balance and makes a spectacular crash landing
The package gets a bit crushed, and little individual packets of white powder spill out of it
Peter stares at them in horror
What the hell is this
He picks up a few packets and examines them
Oh, God, no
dope
That's all we need
He starts to tremble  with fear
He picks the packets up as fast as he can and  hastily puts them back into what's left of the package;  then shoves it all into his pocket and continues racing  down the stairs
59
-                                            59 Punk #1 is attempting to strap the basket onto the motorcycle with a bungie cord
Punk #2 watches him coolly
#2 We'd be better off taking the subway
#1 You want to ride the subway with a hundred grand in uncut dope, go ahead
#2 Well we can't ride around carrying this baby basket
We'll get stopped by the cops
#1 So go ahead, take the subway and stop bothering me
'm going to hook this onto the back seat
52
#2 It'll never hold, man
#1 (desperately going at the hook and the basket) Goddamn hook
Christ, what a stupid idea hiding the shit with this kid
It's ridiculous
Peter comes rushing out of the building
(huffing and puffing) Oh, thank God, you're still here
There's been a terrible mistake
That wasn't the package you were s'posed to take
It was another one
have it right here
#1 What do you mean
What other package
'll take the basket back and give you the other package, here
No mistake
Peter takes the package from his pocket and is about to grab the basket
Punk #1 pushes him back violently
#1 You ain't takin' nothin' back, man
But 'm tellin you it was a mistake
#1 (in a low but very aggressive tone) You tryin' to double-cross us or something
Beat it before  get pissed, man
(panic-stricken, in an equally low tone) But 'm telling you, 've got your package right here
There's been a mistake
53
#1 mistake my ass
Now get outa here, man, or 'm gonna stick this right in your gut
He discreetly reveals a switchblade knife he's carrying
#1 (to Punk #2) Start the bike
Punk #2 is about to get on the motorcycle
Peter stops him
But 'm telling you, 've got the real package in my pocket
#2 (to Punk #1) Watch it, the cops
Peter quickly puts back the package in his pocket patrol car comes up next to them, right beside the car in which Graton is sitting, taking in every bit of the action
(to his partner) Terrific
bet these morons screw up everything
One of the  gets out of his car and comes over to the Punks and Peter
Peter is scared stiff
#1 (whispering) If you called the cops on us, pal, you're a dead man
#1 All right, what's that doing on the back of the bike
No one answers
#1 You wouldn't by any chance be intending to drive with a baby basket on your motorcycle, would you
#1 Of course not, Officer
We'd never do something like that
54
#1 So why did you strap it on in the first place if you had no intention of driving with it
#2 So it wouldn't fall off
#1 Very funny
As he speaks, Peter undoes the bungie cord from around the basket and takes it off the motorcycle
No, really, Officer, they weren't gonna drive off with it -- They were just watching it for me while was doing a quick errand
(to the Punks) Thanks, guys
Punk #1 gives him a dirty look
#1 All right, let's see some identification, everybody
The punks exchange a glance
Suddenly Punk #1 shouts: #1 Go
They take off running in different directions
Cop #1 charges after Punk #1 and yells to his partner who's still in the car: #1 Watch the guy with the basket
Cop #2 leaps out of the car, gun in hand
Peter stiffens with fear
#2 Freeze
All right, asshole, let's see some
(urbanely) Listen, Officer, let's stay calm now
haven't the slightest intention of running
am not a criminal
'm an architect
#2 (calming down 55
a little) Your
, let's see it
'm terribly sorry, Officer, but don't have any identification on me
just came down with my baby to run a quick errand haven't committed any crime
#2 All right, let's go, in the car
'm taking you down to the station
Oh, c'mon, that's impossible -- you see  have a baby
have to give her a bottle in fifteen minutes,  can't go anywhere
live right in this building -- let me go up to my apartment and 'll get you my license immediately
You can even come with me if you like
#2 All right, lead the way
They disappear inside the building
Peter is carrying the basket in his left hand; his right hand is clenched on the horrible package hidden in his pocket
Just then Cop #1 comes running back, empty-handed
Graton gets out of his car and comes up to Cop #1, show- ing him his badge
(angry) Inspector Graton, Narcotics
It just so happens  was tailing those two guys and now because of you clowns  lost them, probably forever
Thanks a lot
#1 How could we know
Forget it
Listen, your partner went in here with the guy and the baby
He lives up on the tenth floor
can't go in because if he sees me, my cover is blown
So could you please try not to lose this one, okay
He's someone who's 56
gotta be watched very closely
've called for backup and it's on its way
60
-                                       60 The elevator doors open, Peter and Cop #2 exit
(key in hand) This is it
Please come in
can  get you a cup of coffee or something
#2 No thanks
'll just wait out here
Peter enters the apartment and calmly crosses through the house, carrying the basket
As soon as he's out of the cop's sight, he starts running like a madman down the corridor
He runs into Michael who was just coming to meet him
Hey, what's happening
What were those cops doing
Peter shuts him up, grabs him roughly under the arm and leads him into his room, closing the door behind them
Peter speaks softly but he's totally freaking out, he can hardly breathe
Michael
Michael
we're in deep trouble
The package
The package
Yeah
What
There's a cop on the doorstep
He didn't see you
He mustn't see you
We're in deep trouble, Michael
Tell me what
The package  they came for wasn't the baby, it  was dope, drugs, a shitload of  dope
We were stopped by some cops  down on the street
57
But did the cops see the dope
No, it's right here
He takes out the package
Shit
We'll get twenty years if the cops find this on us
Climb down the fire escape and hide it
anywhere
Michael takes the package, opens the window and starts to climb out it when Peter stops him
Hey, whatever you do,   don't lose the goddamn dope, we   gotta be able to return it to   those dealers or we're dead
Those    guys are serious
Don't worry
He starts down the fire escape, then stops and turns back
Oh, by the way,  put some water up to boil for her bottle
Michael disappears
Peter picks up Mary, grabs his  wal- let and leaves the room
When he gets to the hall,  he discovers that Cop #1 has joined Cop #2, to whom he is whispering something
Peter holds his license out  for them to see
Here's my license
#1 'm afraid 'm going to have to ask you to remain in the apartment
The narcotics squad will be arriving any moment now
They want to ask you a few questions
Narcotics squad
What do they want with me
don't even use aspirin
58
61
-                                      61 Michael is buying a pair of scissors, glue and a roll of Scotch tape
Then he buys a box of large diapers -- he chooses the ones that come in a box
Michael leaves the supermarket, whistling
62
-                                             62 Michael is sitting on a bench facing the grass, with his back to us, he seems quite busy
As we  , we discover that he has opened the box of diapers and that he's holding one of them; its plastic has been carefully cut out with scissors
Casually, glancing right and left, he takes the individ- ual packets of white powder out of his pocket and shoves them into a little plastic bag from the supermarket
Then he carefully tapes the bag so it's well-sealed and flattened out, and he inserts it into the diaper, be- tween the plastic and the absorbent fabric
Next, the diaper is taped up, folded back up and put back in the box, neatly packed between the other ones
Michael closes the box again and glues it together so it looks as if it's never been opened
He throws all the other stuff away in a trash can and grabs hold of his brand-new box of diapers
He walks away
63
-                                        63 Michael comes into the living room with his box of diapers and a bag of groceries
In addition to the two cops there are now who are interrogating Peter
He is holding Mary
The basket is on an armchair
Hello, Officers
What's going on
Don't worry, Michael, it's nothing serious, just a little misunderstanding
Did you give her the 5:30 bottle
Yeah,  just gave it to her
59
Did you change her
No, she's soaking wet
Okay, 'll do it
Michael puts down his bag of groceries, takes Mary from Peter and disappears with the box of diapers
In his room, he lays Mary down on his bed and starts undressing her
64
-                                     64 #1 And who's he
He's my roommate
#1 (raising an eyebrow) Oh,  see,  see
No, you don't see
There are three of us sharing this place
#1 Oh, three, huh
regular 'mirage a trois'
It's 'menage'
and it's not
We all have lots of girlfriends, thank you
#1 Uh-huh, so what's your friend do
He's a cartoonist
#1 What about the other guy
He's a pilot
#1 Ah-hah
Now that's interesting
(to his colleague) 60
Get me those photographs, the ones taken at Newark Airport
Agent #1 looks in his attache case
#1 So does this friend of yours ever fly to South America
No
Never
Only North America
The
#1 Would you object if  answered it for you
Not at all, go right ahead
've got nothing to hide
Agent #1 picks up the phone and listens
#1 It's a collect call    from a Jack Collins in La Paz,    Bolivia
That wouldn't happen to    be your pilot friend, would it
The one who never goes to South    America
Yes, it is him
Agent #1 hands him the phone
Hello, yes, operator,  accept the charges
Agent #1 gestures to Agent #3 to take a look around the apartment
Agent #3 slips away
#1 Would you mind very much if listened
Please, go right ahead
Agent #1 picks up the other telephone
Hello, Jack
Fine, yeah
How're you
Yeah, he's fine, too
Yeah, we left a message for you, right
No, it was nothing 61
special, it was just,  mean
to see how you were doing and all No, no emergency
Everything's fine
(') (loud) said everything's fine
The what
don't know what you're talking about
Oh yeah, the package
Yeah, yeah, it got here and was picked up, uh-huh
Hey
Why didn't you call sooner
Huh
'Cause what
Oh, you're onto something hot -- well, aren't you the lucky one
So when are you getting married
Forget it, was just kidding
Well, everything's fine up here
So have a good time
See you in a couple of weeks
'Bye
Peter hangs up
So does Agent #1
#1 Now that's interesting
So you wanna tell me about this package and the hot something-or-other your friend lucked onto
in La Paz
Bolivia
South America
Peter sits down, stunned
65
'  -                                   65 Mary is lying on Michael's bed
He has just finished putting a regular diaper on her
Then Michael looks for the tampered-with diaper in the box
He finds it, checks that it is well-sealed, and places it under Mary's bottom
Just then Agent #3 appears in the doorway
Michael calmly finishes putting the dope-filled diaper on the baby on top of the other one
is
Every- thing appears normal
However, a trained eye might be very surprised by the enormous thickness of the diaper covering the young lady's backside
But a narcotics agent is not necessarily the most qualified person to notice something odd like this
Agent #3 silently observes Michael, who gives him a big smile as he slips on Mary's pajama bottoms
Michael picks Mary up and for the first time talks to her in the kind of silly babytalk used by adoring parents
62
Okey-dokey, honeybunch, it's time to go beddy-bye now
We're gonna take a nice long nappy-wappy
He goes back to the living room, followed by Agent #3
Agent #1 is in the process of showing Peter a photograph
#1 Do you recognize anyone in this picture
Peter looks: it's the photo of Jack and Paul that was taken at the beginning of the movie
(pointing) Sure
This is Jack Collins
#1 Oh yeah
Now that's interesting
Michael has laid Mary down for a nap in her basket, observed by the five cops
He now sits down, cheerful and bubbling over with enthusiasm
So
Can  get you something to drink
Agent #1 totally ignores him
#1 So, who's the baby belong to
It's Jack's daughter
#1 And why are you two taking care of her
Because her mother's in Europe for six months, and since Jack had to be away for two weeks,  took my vacation to take care of her, love kids
Yeah, Peter and  just love kids
#1 Now that's interesting
Well, we'll be seeing each other again soon, in fact very soon
In the 63
meantime, 'd appreciate it if you didn't leave New York in the next few days
All the cops head for the door
Michael accompanies them, putting on a very urbane act
Come back anytime, gentlemen
You're always welcome here
We have no particular plans to leave New York in the near future, so don't worry about us now
'Bye now
Once the cops are gone, Michael races back to the living room
Peter has collapsed into his armchair
(in a low tone) Christ, what a mess
They'll be on our tails around the clock
How the hell are we gonna get rid of the goddamn dope
By the way, where is it
(also speaking in a low tone) It's cool, don't worry,  got it stashed
Where
Michael points to Mary's bottom
Huh
This way it's close at hand
Are you out of your mind
Relax, will you
(') diapered the dope on her right in front of the cop and he never noticed a thing
told the cops we were taking care of her
You realize we're now stuck with the kid till Jack 64
comes back
There ain't nobody coming to pick her up, and  have to go back to the office today
Wait a minute
You're not gonna stick me with this kid
Tell them you need a maternity leave, tell them anything, but we've got to go 50-50 on this
And that's not all -- we haven't heard from the punks yet either
66
-                                      66 Hidden within a parked car, three men are keeping a close watch on the entrance to Peter, Michael and Jack's build- ing
The two uniformed cops emerge, get in their car, and pull away
67
-                                         67 (on the phone; things are heating up) That's right, you heard right: 'm not coming in to work for two weeks
No,  can't explain why
(in a louder tone) Because  can't, that's all
, this has nothing to do with chasing ass
Jerry
Jerry
Will you stop screaming for a minute and listen
'm in trouble, you understand
Deep trouble know
know
(') (yells) Goddammit, Jerry, of course winning the competition is important to me
The firm's my whole life if you must know
No, no, please -- don't send anyone over here
Don't you come either
No, Jerry
Okay, listen, 'll be there in a half-hour, but  can't stay long
No
Don't come here
'll be right over
He hangs up
Michael enters the room, with his coat on
65
gotta go over to    Mr
Oxman's -- he just called and    he's freaking out
He says if      don't bring some cartoons over    now, the deal's off
You're going now
Yeah, but don't worry about it, 'll be back before it's time for her next bottle
She's asleep now
Terrific, just terrific
Jerry just called:  have to go to the office right now
Well, call him back
Tell him you'll come later
There's no way
can't, he's suicidal
Why don't you call Oxman and tell him you'll be there in a few hours
You're crazy
Oxman is leaving in an hour
If  don't meet him before then,  blow my 15,000 dollar contract
Oh shit,  can't take this anymore
Look, maybe we could pawn her off on Mrs
Razzolini, just for a couple of hours -- she's crazy about her
Good idea
Let's go
68
-                                   68 Peter and Michael get out of the elevator on Mrs
Razzolini's floor
They each are holding one of the handles on the basket
They are walking quickly
Suddenly Michael stops Peter
66
Wait --  hear someone
'll go see
Peter waits with the basket
Michael tiptoes to the corner of the corridor
At the very end of the corridor, on Mrs
Razzolini's doorstep, he sees the three narcotics Agents talking with Mrs
Razzolini
We can hear snippets of their conversation
Yes,  brought a package up to them
think it was last Sunday
#1 What are these people like
What kind of lifestyle do they have
Michael hastily returns to Peter, still on tiptoes
He leads him back to the elevator and pushes the elevator button
(whispering) Just as  thought -- the goddamn cops are grilling Mrs
Razzolini
Oh shit
We sure as hell can't hand her the baby with an ass full of dope
right in front of the narcs
The elevator has arrived meanwhile
(breaking down) What should we do
really gotta go
Listen, she's just had her bottle
She's sleeping like a log
Let's just leave her in the apartment
What can possibly happen to her
She's as regular as clockwork
She won't wake up till 8:30 and we'll easily be back by then
Yeah, you're right, we won't be long
They rush into the elevator
67
69
-                                           69 The three men, slumped in their car, are watching the door of the apartment building
The three narcotics Agents emerge from the building and walk away
short time goes by
Peter and Michael emerge from the building and quickly walk away
The three men get out of their car, cross the street and enter the building
70
-                                       70 Peter comes out of the elevator, key in hand
He's about to put it in the lock on the door, but stops short -- the door is already open
Michael
Michael, are you here
No answer
Peter pushes the door open
The sight that greets his eyes is very dismaying
It looks like a tornado has hit the house
Everything's on the floor, it's all been smashed, it's all been ripped apart
Gone is the beauti- ful apartment that had been so lovingly decorated
In its place, utter devastation and shambles
Peter stands there speechless for a moment, then an awful thought crosses his mind
He runs like crazy into his room -- the basket's not there
Stepping over the debris and all the things strewn over the floor, he rushes into the living room, then into Michael's room
The basket's nowhere to be seen
Peter falls apart; without even realizing it, he's moan- ing and muttering distractedly
He runs into Jack's room, into the kitchen, into the bathroom
The basket is nowhere to be seen
Peter runs all over, back and forth ten times in all the rooms
Tears are flowing from his eyes
Suddenly, he hears
They're coming from the back bathroom
Peter rushes to   it, practically ripping the door from its hinges
There   on the toilet is the basket, and on it there's a note  written in big messy printing which says: "
" Mary looks at Peter and smiles; she seems in great shape
distraught Peter picks her up, hugs her tightly and kisses her all over as he takes her into his room
Just then, Michael appears in the corridor, silent and 68
overwhelmed
He comes to the door to Peter's    room and looks at him
Peter, mortified to have been    caught kissing Mary, hastily distances himself from   her, hold- ing her at arm's length
He puts her down on    his bed and exits the room
71
-                                         71 The debris has been shoved up against the walls
Peter and Michael, in their pajamas and dead tired, are slumped over the table
Peter is giving Mary her bottle
Michael is looking at Mary as though he were seeing her for the first time
72
'  -                                    72 Peter is in bed, completely out of it
Michael is changing Mary very carefully
He puts one diaper on her, then the second one, full of dope
He lays Mary down in her basket, then places the basket on the bed, nestled between the wall and Peter's body
Michael, holding the soiled diaper, silently goes out
Once he's alone, Peter leans over the basket
Mary and he stare at each other intently and seriously
Peter switches off the light
73
-                                        73 The
Michael, asleep on his mattress on the    floor in the middle of his wrecked bedroom, emerges    from sleep and glances at his clock: it's 6:10
He staggers to the front door and opens it
The door is     being held together with a string
Agents #1, #2, and #3 are at the door, with four other cops backing them up
Mrs
Razzolini is standing behind them and staring, wide- eyed, a look of horror on her face
Morning, officers
Can  help you
#1 (holding out a piece of paper to him) Search warrant
69
(playing  the gentleman, waving  away the paper) believe you,  officer
Go ahead, we have nothing  to hide
Hello, Mrs
Razzolini
Mrs
Razzolini turns her back on him and hurries away
The cops enter the apartment
You'll have to excuse the mess
We had a few friends over last night
#1 (looking at the devastation) Oh, really
Well, if  were you 'd get myself some new friends
Peter comes in, in his bathrobe, furious
What the hell are you guys looking for, anyway
#1 Probably the same things your friends were looking for last night
Didn't Mrs
Razzolini bring you a package last Sunday
You mean the chocolate Easter bunnies
We ate them already
He starts to walk away
Anyway, you have no idea how many packages we've been getting lately
It's hard to keep track of them
#1 Maybe we can help
(to his colleagues) Let's get to work
All the cops enter the apartment
74
'  -                              74 Peter is in bed, with the basket beside him
narcotics is rummaging through his scattered belongings
Would you mind if  look in your 70
bed
(big smile) My pleasure
Try not to make a mess
Peter gets up, takes the basket off the bed and keeps it in his hands
The Agent searches the bed
'll look in the basket, if you don't mind
Be my guest
He picks up Mary with her huge diaper
The Agent searches the whole basket
Thank you very much, sorry about this
He goes out
Peter, undaunted, pats Mary's big behind
75
-                                        75 The cops are leaving
#1 Well, there's obviously been a mistake
As far as you're concerned this investigation is closed
We apologize again
(big smile) Oh, don't mention it
It was a pleasure having you here
hope you'll find what you're looking for very soon
#1 (looking straight at him) So do we
Michael closes the door and races into the living room where he discovers Peter putting on his jacket
(softly) Did you hear that
He said there'd been a mistake and they weren't going to bother us anymore
71
Bullshit, it's a trick
You think so
Really
They just said that to put us off guard
They saw the condition this apartment's in
(') They know the punks were here looking for the dope and that they probably didn't find it
So that means we've still got it
But he said the investigation was closed
Okay, let's just see how closed it is
'll go downstairs
You watch out the window and see if 'm being tailed
76
-                                              76 Michael is peeking out at the street from the window above
Peter comes out of the building and turns left, walking very quickly
Suddenly, Peter stops, turns     around and retraces his steps
We can clearly see a      man, who was walking about six yards behind Peter on the     opposite side of the street, also turn around and     retrace his steps
It is Graton
77
-                                           77 (entering) So
Was  right
There's one guy for sure redhead, kind of young, disguised sort of like a college student
knew it
They're going to be watching us around the clock
72
How are we going to get the dope back to the punks
have the feeling they'll come to us
We'll have to be very careful
78
-                                     78 Michael is walking on the street carrying two bags of groceries
Suddenly, a guy walks up to him and elbows him sharply
Hi
Doin' a little shopping, huh
How's your place -- not too much damage,  hope
What do you guys want
We want the dope
Tomorrow
And we want to give it to you
But the cops are tailing us nonstop
Matter of fact, there's one right behind us now
That's your problem, man
Figure out a way to shake 'em
Either we safely get the dope tomorrow, or you, your friend and the kid'll get this
(he quickly stabs the grocery bags three times) We'll call you tonight
He runs off, disappearing into the darkness
From the slit-open grocery bag milk flows out onto the sidewalk
Michael is shaking all over
Standing about twenty yards away, Graton hasn't missed a thing
79
-                                        79 Not far from Peter, Michael and Jack's building, Graton, in his car, is talking into the microphone of his police radio
73
My snitch told me the gang hasn't gotten the dope back yet, but they will soon
They made contact with the two guys tonight No, no, they don't know 'm tailing them
These jerks are going to fall right into my hands
80
-                                       80 Peter and Michael are seated in the living room, which is still an utter wreck
They can't take their eyes off the phone that's between the two of them
They are sitting silently, not moving
Mary is playing in her basket
The
Peter and Michael both jump three feet in the air
Michael picks up the phone
Hello
Who
Goddamn it, where are you
(to Peter) It's Jack
He just landed in Newark
He came back early
Gimme that
(he grabs the receiver out of Michael's hand) Jack
What the hell are you doing
(listens to a long explanation) Yeah
yeah
oh yeah
Well, listen very carefully, Jack
That wonderful, fantastic babe you brought back from Bolivia
The one you're gonna marry tomorrow
Well, you're not going to bring her here
You are going to say 'goodbye' to her very nicely and put her in a cab back to Bolivia
Why
Because there's another wonderful, fantastic babe waiting for you right here at home Who is she
Oh, that's a surprise
You'll see when you get here
But believe me, she's 74
out of this world
You're going to be up all night with this babe
She's crazy about you
(in a low tone) Make it quick, the punks may be trying to call
So hurry home, Jack, this little doll can't wait to see you
'Bye
He hangs up
(in a furious temper) That goddamn mother fuckin' jerk of an asshole
swear when he comes through the door 'll kill him
'll
The  interrupts
Michael leaps up and answers it
Hello
Listen, tomorrow, Central Park at the fountain near the merry-go-round, five o'clock
Be there, but
They've hung up on the other end
Michael hangs up and sits down, drained
That was it
(equally drained) All we can do now is hope our plan works
You think the cops have our phone bugged
don't think that's legal, is it
80A
-                                         80A Graton is speaking into the microphone of his radio
Next to him sits a cop with phone-tapping equipment
(very excited) We got 'em, Chief
Five o'clock 75
tomorrow at the fountain near the merry-go-round
'll arrange for back-up
Hold it, someone's going into their building
We see Jack getting out of a taxi with his luggage and going into the building
81
-                                      81 Jack emerges from the elevator happy as a lark and feeling frisky
(opening the door) Yoo-hoo, guys
'm home
've got presents for you
so where's that wonderful fantastic babe
He enters and sees the state the apartment is in
What the hell happened here
He walks into the apartment, shocked and overwhelmed
Peter
Michael
Are you here
He goes into the    living room -- No one'sthere
Into Michael's room
No one's there
He goes into his own room, where the    destruction is even moreshocking than elsewhere since    nothing has been touchedin there
Oh, my God
My beautiful room
My beautiful, beautiful room
(very angry) Michael
Peter -- where the hell are you, for Chrissakes
He runs like a madman into Peter's room and stops short on the threshold
Michael and Peter are each holding a handle of the basket as they rock it gently
(furious) What the hell is going on around here
What happened to this place
What happened to my room
Peter and Michael look him right in the eye, still rocking the basket
And anyway, what the hell are you 76
swinging that thing for
(silence) Answer me for God's sake
(looking in) Oh my God, there's a kid in there
Have you've gone bananas
There's a Goddamn kid in there
(silence) Oh,  get it
The    'silent' treatment
Okay, if you won't   talk to me, you can talk to my lawyer
This is grounds for divorce
You're in    big trouble, the both of you
He leaves
second later, he comes back
paid to have this place decorated, too, you know
'm not going to let you get away with this
He leaves; a second later, he comes back
It's too late to try and talk me out of it
'm history
'm gone
'm outa here
He leaves
second later, he comes back
'm giving you one more chance to
(very calmly) Would it be asking too much of you to shut your big mouth for a few seconds
There is a child here who's trying to sleep
And that's another thing
will not have a baby in this house
Babies are not part of our agreement
(softly) Michael, please hold me back
or 'll kill him
Michael takes the basket handle from  Peter's hand, places the basket carefully on the bed, and  walks without a word towards Jack, who he takes by the arm  and steers into the living room
Peter softly shuts the   door behind them and follows
77
82
-                                     82 Michael sits Jack down in an armchair
He speaks with forced calm
All right, Jack
Why don't we start at the very beginning
The very day you left for your vacation
Hey, will you please stop talking like Mr
Rogers
It's getting on my nerves
(his fuse has blown, laughing hysterically) His nerves
Ha
Ha
Ha
His nerves
Michael, his nerves
You wanna talk about nerves
Then just shut up and listen
It so happens we don't want a kid here either, but when someone dumps one on us, we take goddamn care of it
Yeah, we take goddam care of it
We haven't had a decent night's sleep in two weeks
Michael's probably going to lose a $15,000 contract
Peter couldn't leave
Jerry almost jumped out the window
It's lucky they even made it to the finals
What
First, we've got the    narcs on our ass, then there's the    drug gang threatening to carve    us up
Then bottles
bottles
every three hours, bottles
And diapers
Have you ever tried to do diapers
78
'La Paz, Bolivia
' He calls from ''m onto something hot
' He says
'Did the package get there
' He says
You asshole
And the day they wrecked the apartment, Peter came home and couldn't find Mary
've never seen him in tears like that bef
(cutting him off; embarrassed) Never mind about that
Look, Jack, you got us into this mess, and you're going to help us get out of it
What are you guys talking about
What narcs
What gang
And who's that fucking baby
For your information, the 'fucking' baby's name is Mary
And if were you, 'd watch what  said about her
because she just so happens to be your daughter
What
And it just so happens, we've got a lot better things to do with our lives than wipe a baby's ass, even if she's yours
Peter and Michael exit, slamming the door
83
-                                       83 Peter is slicking his hair back with Brylcream
Jack is sitting on the edge of the bathtub, with his arms crossed
He observes Peter silently
84
- '  -                     84 Mary is lying on the bed and Michael is putting the dope- filled diaper on her
79
85
-                                         85 Peter is giving a tousled-looking punk hairstyle to Jack, who is looking at himself in the mirror
It's ridiculous
look ridiculous
You look completely ridiculous -- so what
86
-                                      86 , wearing a bonnet and coat, is lying on one of the couches,  merrily
Next  to her, also in his coat, Michael is just finishing wrapping a brown package which he puts in a plastic bag, along with a book, a baby rattle, and a clean diaper
Peter and Jack, disguised as punks, each with punk hairstyles and wearing black sunglasses, are climbing out the window leading to the fire escape
87
-                                           87 Michael exits the building
Mary, wrapped in a little woolen blanket, is in his arms
Michael is also carry- ing his plastic bag
Graton, in his car, is speaking into the radio mike
Okay, he's coming out alone
'll follow him
Someone else stay here to keep an eye on the other guys
88
-                                     88 Michael is lying on the grass near the fountain with Mary on her blanket near him
Graton is nearby, also lying casually on the grass, watching them out of the corner of his eye
Michael glances at his watch, then at the passersby
The punk from the day before walks by with his arm around a girl
He strolls by casually
He spots Michael and their eyes meet
The couple sit down on a bench a few yards away and they begin "making out
" 80
Michael leans over Mary, coochie-coos her and surrepti- tiously takes off her diaper, which he puts down beside him
He puts the clean diaper on her
Graton, nervous and wary,   watches Michael and the passersby
Just then, two    punks (Peter and Jack) come running up to Michael
He    ostensibly takes the brown package out of his plastic   bag and gives it to them
The two punks immediately take off with the package
Graton leaps up, shouts "let's get 'em" and takes off after the punks, followed by about 10 other plainclothes detectives, who'd been hiding all around
Michael quickly gets up,    picks Mary up and discreetly deposits the dope-filled    diaper in a trash can, giving the punk on the bench an    intent look
Then he goes off in the direction of the    cops
The punk calmly goes over to the trash can, takes out the diaper, which he stuffs into his girl friend's purse, and goes off in the opposite direction
The cops have meanwhile arrested Peter and Jack, who put up no resistance whatsoever
Michael now joins them
What's going on
Inspector Graton, Narcotics
Do you admit you gave these men this package
Sure
gave it to them, just a moment ago
(to one of the cops) Officer, will you please open this package in front of these witnesses
The cop opens the package: it's a box of chocolate Easter bunnies
Graton is mortified
He crushes all the bunnies -- there's absolutely nothing but chocolate inside them
Is it against the law to give a box of candy to my friends
Peter and Jack take off their glasses
Oh, it's you guys
81
What's the problem
You guys must think you're pretty smart, don't ya
(suddenly freezes) Holy shit
The diaper
Graton starts running like crazy back to the fountain
He rummages like a sick dog all around the spot where Michael had been lying
Suddenly he dashes toward the trash can and dumps out its contents, throwing the garbage around like a lunatic
The goddam diaper
What a jerk, what a goddam schmuck  am
Peter, Michael, Jack and the 10 plainclothes detectives watch Graton going bananas
(to the cops) think that guy needs a vacation
He should try South America
Yeah,  hear it's nice there this time of year
89
' '  -                          89 The Chief is standing behind his desk, red-faced with anger, and Graton sheepishly faces him
Let's face it
Graton
You've got shit for brains
'm sure the dope was in the diaper
Can  go on tailing them
Forget it
have solid information your three suspects never had anything to do with the dealers or the dope
'm sure the dope was in the diaper
82
Case closed
'm sure the dope was in the diaper
(screaming) Did you hear me, Graton
Case closed
'm sure the d

-                         90 In the devastated living room Peter, still disguised as a punk, and Michael, both very high, are dancing around in circles with each other and laughing
They are singing a lullaby at the top of their lungs, and har- monizing
Peter is holding Mary close, and Michael, holding a near-empty bottle of liquor, staggers over to him and starts turning around in circles with him
, snuggled up warmly between Peter and Michael, is her head off
In the b
g
, in the hall, Jack, also still in his punk getup, is on the phone
He's got a glass in his hand and is a little smashed
Paul, hi, it's Jack
Hey, listen, brought you back a little present from South America
Can  see you right away so  can give it to you
Yeah, the sooner the better
can't wait to let you have it
How about 67th and East River
91
-                                    91 broadly smiling Jack arrives at the riverside
Paul is sitting on a bench
When he sees Jack, he gets up and comes to greet him, smiling and extending his hand
Without warning, Jack suddenly jumps him and  sends him with a forceful shove flying into the water
Paul lands on his back with a big splash, and comes back  up to the surface totally dumbfounded
Jack leans over   the water and yells at him, like a madman, still a bit  drunk
That was for your 'little' package, and consider yourself lucky didn't turn you in to the cops
And get one thing into your thick skull:  have never touched dope, 83
and  never will
You and your shit-dealing, you can go straight to hell, and you can take the money you make from it and stick it up your ass
So long
Jack turns his back on Paul and staggers off
Hey, come back
-- how'm  gonna get out of here
Crawl
92
-                                      92 In the living room, Michael is sitting in front of the He's not really watching -- he's eavesdropping on Jack's phone conversation
(very aggravated) Listen, Sylvia, you've got to come back
travel,  can't take care of her
Yeah, but you're her mother
'm her father -- what makes you so sure 'm the father
The dates coincide
Big deal
That doesn't prove a thing
But she's still your kid, so do me a favor, get your ass back here immediately and take her off our hands
'Cause we've got a lot better things to do with our lives than wipe a baby's ass, okay
Sylvia
Hello
Hello
Sylvia, goddam it
(') (he slams the receiver down like he was hammering a nail) Shit
That bitch hung up on me
Women
could kill them
Why don't you call her back
don't have the number
got a message to her through her agency, they won't tell me where she is
don't even know where she was calling from
And you better believe she's not going 84
to call back
The
Michael answers it
Hello
No, it's Michael
How are you
Oh, she's doing just fine, she's in great shape
We're taking very good care of her, you have nothing to worry about
'Bye
He hangs up
Who was that
Sylvia -- She wanted to know how Mary was doing
What
Jesus Christ, Michael, why didn't you let me talk to her
She would have just hung up on you again
The important thing is she knows Mary's fine
You jerk
You should've said she was terrible, sick as hell
Practically on death's door
(exits, furious) What a jerk, what a pain in the ass you can be sometimes
(to himself) What's with him
The kid's doing really great
93
-                                93 Jack is on the phone in his room, which is looking a little more normal again
Mom
Hi, how are you
Yes, 'm fine
Yes, 'm eating well
Mom, how would you feel if  told you you were a grandma
coming over the phone
85
Yeah
little girl, Mary
coming over the phone
'd love you to see her
In fact,  was gonna bring her down tomorrow
today
Great, think there's a flight in three hours
'll be at your place by two
See you real soon
He hangs up gleefully, rubbing his hands together
94
-                                        94 Michael and Jack are in the kitchen
Michael is making some bottles
Jack is watching him do it
You'll have four already made, this'll hold till Miami
Okay
Tell her to make sure Mary gets plenty of sleep
'll tell her
If her ass gets red, tell her not to listen to any pediatricians -- they're full of shit
Right
Full of shit
Then she should give her a bottle of water instead of the regular bottle
Works like a charm: Her ass will be white as snow in three hours
(nodding) Bottle of water, white as snow
Peter says her clothes should be washed by hand
86
Really, by hand
(nodding) And only in soap flakes without any artificial color or scent
And then rinsed three times in very hot water
(docile) Rinse three times
To put her to sleep we sing in harmony -- it always works
My mother lives alone
Solo works just as well
Okay
Now, as for the nipples, you've got to be very, very, very careful
(') As soon as the hole gets too big she's gotta throw them out -- This is extra, extra, extra-specially important -- 'cause if the hole's too big, the milk comes out too fast and it's bad for her digest
(politely, but a little in a hurry) gotta get going, 'll miss my plane
95
-                                       95 Peter is returning from work
Anyone home
Michael is in the living room, eating a sandwich, while looking through a magazine
87
am
How 'bout Jack
On his way to Miami
Oh, yeah
He's got a lot of nerve
Leaving us with the kid again
No, he took Mary to his mother's, she couldn't wait to see her
He's gonna try to unload her on her till Sylvia gets back made her four bott
(furious) You're kidding
That son-of-a- bitch
Don't worry,  told him everything he had to know, and  made her four bott
Oh, 'm telling you, that guy is really starting to get on my nerves
Why
Goddamn him
He really could have called me
Are you pissed off 'cause she's gone
(exasperated) Of course not
What, are you crazy
'm relieved
Thank God she's out of here
made her four bott
88
That idiot
He     could at least have told me
(exits,    cursing) can't believe    this
That jackass
That    jerk
There are such things as    phones
(to himself) Four bottles for the goddam trip
There,  finally got it out

There is a big red convertible filled with four jovial senior citizens
Jack comes out of the cab with the basket and stares at his mother, , who's just locking her door
Next to her, holding her luggage is Steve (a man in his sixties)
They head toward the trunk of the car
Hey, Mom
(hits Steve) Hey, he finally made it
(') (to Jack) Do you have any idea what time it is
It's four
You said two
But, Mom,  missed the plane
Yeah, but now  have to go
Where are you going
On a cruise around the world
But why didn't you say so on the phone
Because you never would've come
Now let me see her
(she grabs Mary and covers her with kisses) Oh, my little strudle
89
Hey, Margie
We're a little late
Bye-bye, sweetie love
'll bring you back presents from all over the world
(to Jack, giving back Mary) Four o'clock
She runs into the car and they pull away
Everyone waving goodbye
(holding Mary) 'Bye
97
-                                    97 Jack comes in with the basket; he's in a vile mood
He's got a bottle ready in his hand
Peter, who had been working in his room, rushes to the hall
You're bringing her back
Yeah
she's starving
gotta heat this bottle up right away
They go into the kitchen together
Peter immediately gets busy; he heats the bottle up quickly while Jack soothes the hungry Mary by carrying her in his arms
So what happened
Did you two have a fight
(grim) Goddamn cruises
Didn't she want to take her
Sure she did, but she was just leaving for some stupid cruise around the world
The entire fucking world
With some bimbo boyfriend of her's
and a bunch of retired bozos
90
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree
What

-                              98 The
Jack goes to the door
At the door stands a rather distinguished-looking woman, with her hair tied back very properly, a suitcase in her hand
It is
, who speaks with a British accent
Good afternoon
'm Mathilda Bretsaws, from The Second Mommy agency
(very eager, very gracious) Oh, yes,  was expecting you
Won't you come in
They disappear into the living room
Jack shuts the door behind him
Michael peeks into the hall, then goes and looks into the living room through the crack in the door
Peter, too, peeks in
Who is it
Must be some nanny he found through an agency
Peter shrugs and walks away
Jack comes out of the living room
(softly, to Michael) She wants to see Mary
She's asleep
Well, she wants to see her anyway
He heads toward Peter's room
91
(returning from the kitchen) What do you want
Nothing, nothing
Don't go into my room, she's asleep
Yeah, but the nanny, Mrs
Bretsaws, she wants to see her
No, damn it, no
You're gonna wake her up
It already took me an hour to sing her to sleep
Yeah, but she wants to see her
All right, 'll go explain the situation
(holding him back with both hands) No, no, Peter, please, really, don't go, don't bother, 'll go explain it to her myself
It's no bother, Jack
'll be glad to do it
He rushes toward the living room
(sighing, to Michael) Wanna bet she's out of here in ten minutes slamming the door behind her
They tiptoe over to the living room door and eavesdrop
99
-                           99 sleeping child should not be awakened
If you don't know that, then you're not fit to be a nanny
92
(tense, but still calm) never said that  wanted the child to be awakened, sir
only asked to see her
If 'm going to be taking care of the child on a round-the-clock basis, then
'Round-the-clock'
Whaddya mean 'round the clock'
Are you intending to sleep here
Absolutely, sir
second mommy is a second mommy
And where are you going to sleep
Well,  expect you to show me to my quarters
Well,  don't know where Jack intends to stick you
That's his problem
Maybe in his room
But 'm warning you, Mrs
Brestshow
Bretsaws
There are three of us sharing this place and we're all real studs
100
-                                100 Behind the door, Jack rolls his eyes, Michael empathizes with him
They head back to the kitchen
101
-                            101 And as for screwing,  have all  need at home, thank you very much
With a few days off every month, 'm sure 'll be fine
The only thing 'm interested in is the care of the child and  can tell she needs some
93
Oh, yeah
How do you figure that
Shouldn't  be discussing all this with the father
Well, listen, Mrs
Fretsaw, umm
Brainsore
Bretsaws, Mrs
Bretsaws
Right
Bratsnot, lemme tell you something
With a child you always know who the mother is, but the father -- that's another kettle of fish
So don't give me that bullshit, okay
Very well
won't discuss it any further with you
Will you please show me where the kitchen and the bathroom are
What for
So  can make you a list of the things we need
What do you mean, make you a list
-- Don't you do the shopping yourself
No shopping or laundry or housekeeping
am a professional nanny
We have plenty of everything
Do you have a sufficient amount of fruit and vegetables for the child
She only eats milk and cereal
94
That's not enough, sir
From the age of three months children should be started on a normal, varied diet
Oh that's bullshit
You don't feed a baby like an adult
(mockingly) Oh, really
And how would you know
've read plenty of books
The diet recommended by those quack pediatricians today is way too rich
'm in favor of natural methods, Mrs
Breathmint
Bretsaws, Mrs
Bretsaws
For instance, if a child is having trouble getting to sleep, what would you do
Depends, if it was a continuing problem,  might recommend a mild sedative
(exploding, triumphantly) knew you'd say something like that, you jerk
Fine
Anything you     say, sir
Let me just remind    you that  have my diploma and that    medicine is a serious matter
Do you know the song that goes 'Medicine's a whore and the pharmacist is her pimp'
No,  don't
We must listen to different music
Personally 'm very fond of opera
95
Mrs
Breakballs, if you don't get out of here right this minute 'm gonna punch you in the nose
This is my home, now get out
The name's Bretsaws
am blessed with infinite patience when it comes to children, sir, but 'm not qualified to deal with lunatics
Goodbye and good luck
Mrs
Bretsaws grabs her suitcase and exits, dignified and stiff as a broom, slamming the door behind her
102
-                             102 Michael and Jack are sitting at the table
(looking at his watch) What did  tell you
Ten minutes to the second
103
-                                 103 Okay, listen, you guys
've tried everything and nothing's working: my mother's off on a cruise; Mrs
Razzolini won't speak to us ever since the whole business with the cops -- we don't want to involve any of our girlfriends; Sylvia's taking it easy in Europe and there's no way she's gonna come back now that Michael went and told her everything's just fine and dandy
Peter did a terrific job getting rid of Mrs
Bretsaws, and all that's left are the daycare centers, but Peter's positive they're a breeding pit for
So you tell me: What are we suppose to do
You want me to split with the kid
Or dump her in an orphanage
(pretending to play the violin) 96
Here we go
Look,  her mother'll be back in less  than five months
Let's not waste  a shitload of time looking for a  solution for such a short time
Let's get organized
What do you mean, organized
Well, you'll have to ask to fly the New York-Washington shuttle for five months, on account of serious personal problems
What
Never
'd rather be a subway conductor
(barking) Then dump her in an orphanage, 'cause there's no way we're gonna take care of her all by ourselves anymore
Come on, stop arguing, you two
Jack, you're going to have to ask to do the New York-Washington shu
(stubborn, yelling) No
Never
(unruffled) That way, you can do the 6-10
shift
That amounts to two bottles and two diaper changes
You do the shopping when you get home in the evening and that's all
Peter, you'll take the 6-10
shift
That's two bottles and two diaper changes, her bath and her laundry
Since  work at home 'll take the longest shift from 10
to 6
'll take her to the park for an hour, but that's it
No shopping, no cooking, no cleaning
What if she gets up at night
97
Whose shift is that
Well
thought you might do it
Not a    chance
'm not doing the night    shift
absolutely refuse
have    too much work to catch up on for    the competition
Well, needless to say  refuse, too
Listen to me, you selfish bastards
My shift is eight hours in a row
No way 'm gonna do nights too
After 6
she can scream all she wants,  don't give a shit
You know, Jack, you're a real slime ball
We give you the easiest shift: the morning
She's always in great shape in the morning, isn't she
We've got to work like crazy to save our jobs and you have the nerve to refuse nights
Goddamit, she's your daughter
Are you that horny
(extremely pissed off) Hey, horny yourself
don't give a shit
don't need you guys
'll find some other way to do it
And  won't take the New York-Washington shuttle
He exits, furious
104
-                             104 Jack is coming out of   an office that says " " He is grim    and sullen-looking
He runs into his friend Paul, who   jumps three feet away to avoid a potential mishap with   Jack
(shyly) Hi, Jack, something wrong
98
(who hadn't noticed him) Oh, hi
Nah, nothing's wrong
What were you doing in the boss's office
was asking to do the New York- Washington shuttle for a few months
Oh, and he said 'no,' huh
(barking) As a matter of fact, he said 'yes
' Paul backs up against the wall, protecting his face with his arms
Jack leaves, disgusted
Paul watches him go, totally confused
105
'  -                                  105 Jack is sitting on his bed, wearing a dressing gown
He's got a sleeping Mary in his arms
The basket is on the floor beside the bed
Jack attempts to put Mary back in her basket but she shudders and he immediately sits back down again and doesn't move
Mary falls back asleep
Jack looks at her skin, her hands
Very gently, he kisses her forehead
Mary smiles in her sleep
106
'  -                                   106 Michael is working at his drafting table
Jack rushes in, wearing his uniform, ready to go out
Okay, 'm off
She's well fed and she's sleeping now
We hear
Shit, she's crying
'll go pick her up
Peter passes him in the corridor
He, too, is ready to go out to his office
99
Let her cry, she's just trying to get to sleep, she'll stop in a couple of minutes
No, she needs to burp -- 've gotta rock her for a little
'm telling you, the more you pick her up, the longer it'll take her to get to sleep
Thanks for the advice -- now why don't you just shove it
know you let her scream for hours but can't
(in a state of shock) never let her scream for hours
You'd resort to any theory to not take care of her
Just because you've read some books
Can you believe what he just said to me
read those books bec
It's not your shift, anyway
Piss off, will ya
Come on, guys, cool it
It's my shift now
(to Jack) 'll rock her for a few minutes
(to Peter) and then 'll put her right to bed
So off to work, both of you
He pushes them both out
1076
-                                   107 It's noon, the sun is   shining brightly
Michael is diapering Mary on her   changing table
She's naked
He tickles her, bites   her toes, neck and ears; she bursts out laughing
Michael is totally gaga over her
100
Coochie, coochie, coo
woo, woo, woo
bippity, boppity boo
Peter comes rushing into the apartment and runs toward his room
He stops short in the corridor -- he hears Mary's laughter and Michael's coochie-coo's
Noiselessly he tiptoes over to the living room door and listens, troubled
Then he walks away and shouts, as though he were just coming out of his room
Hi, Michael,  just came back to get a file  forgot
Michael stops his baby-talk immediately, as though sud- denly paralyzed, embarrassed, guilty
Peter enters the room
Everything okay
(without looking at him) Yeah, okay
Silence
(not moving) Well,  guess 'll be going now
(not moving either) Yeah
They're both uneasy
The baby okay
(not budging an inch) Yeah, okay
Peter exits
108
-                                 108 Peter enters the bathroom
He's carrying Mary, who's naked and wrapped in a towel
101
Peter carefully locks the door behind him
He removes Mary's towel and sits her in her little tub, filled with warm water
Mary quivers as she comes in contact with the water
Peter kneels down and very gently pours glasses of water on her shoulders and head
The water streams down her face
She blinks and laughs
Peter whispers lovingly to her in a barely audible, very low voice
Mary stares at him
: 109     -                                  109 Peter is wearing a different suit and Mary is almost one-year-old, with a lot more hair on her head, and able to sit up a lot better
110
'  -                                  110 Although it is dark, we can distinguish in Jack's bed a rather bulky shape, which is moving around under the comforter and doesn't exactly seem to be sleeping
Suddenly, from the direction of    the living room, we can hear
Jack emerges     from under the comforter and switches on the light: he     has a female guest in his bed, a pretty  this    time
(to himself) Shit, she's crying
What
Nothing, nothing
'll be right back
He gets up, slips on a bathrobe and goes out of the bedroom, carefully closing the door behind him
He goes into the living room, picks Mary up, and showers her with kisses
Mary stops crying immediately and lays her head on Jack's shoulder, sucking her thumb
Jack rocks her for a moment then puts her back to bed
Mary instantly starts crying again
Jack very quickly picks her up again and kisses her
Mary is delighted by his tenderness
Jack puts her back to bed again
102
Mary cries again
It' beddy-bye time now, honey, beddy-bye, don't cry, sweetheart
Mary keeps crying, Jack picks her up again
Peter and Michael in their pajamas, their faces swollen with sleep, enter the living room
(in a soft voice) She's crying
(hushed voice) Yeah, every time  try to put her back to bed
(hushed voice) Maybe she's thirsty
No, her back teeth must be starting to bother her
What should  do
've bought some stuff for her gums
He rubs some of the medication on Mary's gums
Try and put her back to bed; we'll sing
Jack puts Mary back to bed
Michael, as a routine, sings a major chord, giving each of them their notes
They start singing a lullabye in three-part harmony, as they lean over the crib
Mary is in seventh heaven
She looks up at them, she stops crying, she sucks her thumb
111
'  -                                 111 The Brunette is listening to the male chorus, totally amazed
This guy's totally whacko
She gets up, slips on a -shirt, and exits the bedroom
103
She stops at the door to the living room and contemplates the three men who are singing earnestly around the crib
(in a loud voice) Hey, choir boys, you gonna keep it up all night
Peter and Michael stare at her, scandalized
Jack gestures wildly to her to shut up and go away
Oh my God
There's a baby in there
'm sorry
She goes back to Jack's room
(hissing) Who the hell's that broad
Watch your mouth, will you
'm in love with that young lady
Can't she speak softly like everyone else
(getting angry) Listen, at night 'm in charge
So get off my back, will you
(exasperated) Will you quit fighting all the time
She just fell asleep, for Chrissake
Oh, Michael, go to hell
'm sick and tired of your little 'Father Knows Best' number
Yeah, you're right, 'm fed up with it, too
(terribly upset) Okay, that's it
Into the kitchen
He exits, furious
Peter and Jack follow after him
Fuming, they file one after the other down the corridor past the stunned Brunette in her -shirt who was waiting 104
for Jack by the door to his room
The three guys close the kitchen door and start yelling at each other
They all talk at once
've had it with you assholes won't be the buffer between you two anymore
didn't ask you to get up,  know what  have to do
don't mind getting up, that's not the point
'm not a punching bag
You assholes
If  can't bring a girl back here anymore, just say so
And 'm gone
'm outta here
With Mary
You can bring whoever you want as long as they speak softly like everyone else
One thing  know:  can't goddamn wait till Sylvia gets back
Yeah, you can say that again
And again, and again, and again
Meanwhile, the Brunette has put her clothes back on and gathered up her belongings
Now she enters the kitchen
Sorry to disturb you guys, but 'm splitting
didn't come here to be a bedwarmer
'Bye
(running after her) No
Wait, please don't go
it's all over now, 'm coming back to bed
(at the front door) 105
You're very nice, but  don't feel like it anymore now
Some other time, okay
'Bye
She kisses him goodbye and leaves
Jack is very depressed
112
-                                     112 Peter, Michael and Jack have guests over for dinner
, a very fancy table, candles: they're at the tail-end of the dinner, before dessert
Everyone is very fashionably dressed
Natalie is sitting between Peter and Carl
Jay and Jerry, Peter's partners, are also there with their wives
Michael and Sophia are having a vehement discussion as usual, Jack is between two gorgeous models: and
Have you seen the latest bi-annual at the Whitney
Incredible
Have you seen it, Peter
No,  haven't had the time lately
Ah
working hard on the competition, are you
You may as well throw in the -square, old friend, you haven't got a chance
(somewhat harshly) only wish he was working hard on the competition, but unfortunately, that's not the case
Really
What's he doing then
He's always so busy
Maybe he's working hard on women
Some people have to work really hard to get anything
Natalie bursts out laughing
Peter's about to respond, but stops himself suddenly
In the b
g
, a  can be 106
heard
Peter, Jack, and Michael exchange glances
Jack rushes out
The guests haven't heard anything
(whispering to Natalie) Why do you always have to bring Carl along with you
Don't you like him
Oh, c'mon --  love him
Only, 'd like to see you alone for once, that's all
He's  extremely talented -- in fact,   hate to tell you this, but   think he and his group are gonna  win the competition
Well, we'll see about that
Jack returns to the table
Peter's eyes follow him nervously
(in a low tone, to Jack) Did you give her something to drink
(drunkenly) Oh, cut it out
No more for me
've had eight glasses
(in a low tone, to Michael) tried, but she doesn't want anything -- do so want some, but if  have anymore 'll pass out
Save room for dessert -- it's a three-tiered cake from Balducci's
107
Oh
Wow
(greedily) love three-tiered cakes
' So what's it made of
In the b
g
, the  starts  again
Umm, it's made with whipped cream and loads of nipples on top -- mean, loads of
raspberries 'll be right back
Peter rushes out of the room
Michael and Jack exchange glances
The
Are you saying that's not art
Are you really saying that's not art
Well, then, you explain what it is
Well, it's
art
'll be right back
He gets up and goes out
Jack watches him
Jack, tell me about those exotic places, what is Caracas like
(his mind elsewhere) Well, actually
uh, lately 've been to Washington a lot
and uh
'll be right back
He gets up and goes out
113
'  -                            113 The three men are talking
Jack is holding Mary, whose eyes are swollen with tears
Try and put her back to bed
'm warning you, she'll scream
'm sure she's cutting a tooth
108
From the living room, Christie's voice can be heard
(
) Yoo-hoo
What are you guys doing in there
It's fucking boring without you
Oh shit -- the guests
You two go
'm staying with her
It can't be worse than listening to Carl
That's not fair -- let's take Mary out there
And the hell with it
114
-                                    114 The three men enter the living room; Jack is carrying Mary
Oh, it's a baby
(') Where the hell did that come from
Wow
Is it a boy or a girl
Who does it belong to
So you've got a kid now
Incredible
Does that come from Balducci's
No kidding, whose baby is that
Ladies and gentlemen,  would like you to meet my daughter, Mary
(muttering) Your daughter
your daughter
You're kidding
Congratulations
She's adorable
She looks just like you
Oh, what a cute little girl
Overwhelmed by all the people,  bursts out
109
(walking her back and forth) Don't cry, Mary, don't cry
There's too much noise
He shuts the
keeps on
(to everyone) She's teething, that's why she's cranky
(to Jack) Give her to me, 'll try and calm her down
Peter takes  on his lap
The
(very tense) Don't sit down -- it'll get worse
You have to walk around
Peter gets up and walks around
Jack and Michael, standing, watch him walk
even  as Peter walks back and forth in the room with her
The guests watch in uncomfortable silence
How long have you had this kid
few months
(somewhat sharply) Who's her mother, anyway
She's in Europe, she'll be back in a few days
Does she always cry like that
No, it's only because she's teething, she's usually very sweet
The guests remain silent
110
(to break the silence) You'd never think something so small could make a noise so big
'  fills the room
What if you just put her back to bed
Right -- she's just throwing a temper tantrum, put her to bed
We already tried
It's her teeth
(to Jerry) Do you have any kids
' Yeah, but they're grown up now, thank God
(to Jay) And do you have kids, too
What
said
and do you have kids, too
No, we both have careers
The guests remain silent,   to
So, do you think we'll get to taste that three-tiered cake tonight
What
(to Natalie, sarcastically) Oh, nothing, nothing --  was just trying to liven up the 111
conversation
What
Gosh, my ears are ringing, can't hear anybody
must say, a crying kid is kind of hard to take
What
(loudly) We were just saying that this baby's conversation is actually rather limited
and a touch annoying
Don't you think
Well, she's not the only one with a limited conversation
At least she has an excuse, she's a baby
What's yours
frankly don't know what you mean
mean, 've been listening to your pompous drivel about the latest trends for the last two hours, and frankly, it's a crock of horseshit
Come on, Peter, be nice
Listen, go put the baby to bed and you guys cool it, will you
It's okay
'm used to it
Peter's always been a sore loser
(totally out of control) You motherfucker, get out of here
Get out of my house right now or 'll kick the shit out 112
of you
You snobbish scum- sucking snake
Peter, cut it out
Stop it, Peter
Give her to me, 'll put her to bed
(beside himself) No, 'll go
(to all the guests) And you can all go fuck yourselves
Go back to your asinine conversations
He exits with Mary
Jack, embarrassed, follows him
(trying to recover) Well
umm
How 'bout if get the cake now, okay
He exits
Well
It seems our beloved hosts are going to be busy playing mother for a while, so if you'll excuse me, 'll just slip away
(to Natalie) Natalie, may  invite you to spend the rest of the evening in a more hospitable place
Gladly
(to the guests) Goodbye
They exit
(to Jerry and his wife) Is he out of his mind or what
He was absolutely obnoxious
(drunk, getting up and tottering) Hey, Caroline,  think we should 113
go, too
don't feel so good
think 'm gonna barf
(running to help her) Oh, God, no
Hold it back
(starting to cry) wanna go home
Okay, we're going
(to the others) Sorry
say goodbye to Jack for us
They exit
Christie is hanging on to Caroline
(to Jerry) Look, there's no point in our staying any longer
think it's best we leave
' (to Jerry) Tell Peter if was a wonderful party
(sad) Okay
'Bye
Can you drop me off near Soho by any chance
Sure
Thanks
(to Jerry and his Wife) 'Bye
Say goodbye to them for me
Sophia, Jay and his Wife exit
' Well, we might as well go, too
think the evening's over
She gets up, so does Jerry
114
Michael, very playful, comes back in carrying an enormous three-tiered cake
Ta-da
Will you look at this
Is this a cake or what
Can someone make a little room on the table so  can
Are you guys leaving
Yeah, we're beat
Hey, where is everybody
' Well, the atmosphere wasn't exactly festive
Sorry about the cake, Mike
It looks great
Oh, never mind, don't worry
Good night
Jerry and his Wife exit
Michael is left standing there with his cake
Jack comes in, full of beans
Well, she's asleep at last
We sang in har
Hey, where is everybody
Gone
Can you make a little room for me on the table to put the
You mean they're all gone
Yeah, all of 'em, hey, can you make a little room for me to
(going back out, furious) Peter
Peter, goddamit, get out here
Peter comes back in with Jack
They're all gone
115
Who gives a shit, they're all jerks anyway
Hey, could you make a little room for me on the table so can
It's because of the kid
They can't stand kids
can't stand kids either but that's not a reason to leave
Dipshits, they're all a bunch of dipshits, every one of 'em
Oh, fuck it -- 'm sitting down
He sits down on a chair with the cake on his lap
And did    you hear Natalie: 'She's throwing    a temper tantrum, just put her    to bed
' What a pain-in- the-ass    that broad is
(pissed off) Hey, you're the pain-in-the-ass
First you dump a baby on us, then you scare everyone away from the party, then
scared    everyone aw
Just cut the    crap, will you
My whole life is    diapers, shuttles and bottles
do the graveyard shift, 'm the    one who never gets any sleep
Listen, we all have two full-time jobs
That's for sure
And what about me
'm a prisoner in this house all day long, forget about chasing ass,  haven't gotten laid in six months
When the hell is your friggin' Sylvia gonna come back
116
She's been gone for six months and four days
If she's not back by the end of next week, 'm kicking her kid out
You better give your goddam Sylvia hell for this
Don't worry, she's gonna get it but good
And you can tell her we have a lot better things to do with our lives than wipe a baby's ass, goddamn it
He exits
So does Jack
Michael is buried under the three-tiered cake, unable to see around it
Do you guys want some cake
(beat) Guys
115
-                                   115 In her crib Mary is sleeping
She's beautiful, she looks happy
116
-                                   116 Mary is in her playpen, playing with a  rubber giraffe
The
Peter opens it: standing there before him is a very, very, young, gorgeous girl
(bursting with joy) Hello
'm Sylvia, Mary's mother
've come to get her
(completely dazed) Oh, it's you
Wait, 'll go 117
get Jack
He stands there, frozen
How's Mary doing
(as if he were dreaming) Fine, fine, she's doing great
She's getting her back teeth in lately, it's been a bit rough
Can  see her
Oh, yeah, sure, she's in there
They both enter the living room
Mary stares at Sylvia
When she spots Mary, Sylvia suddenly breaks down in tears
Peter is dumbfounded
don't believe how much she's grown
Recovering, wiping away her tears, she walks over to the playpen
Hello, Mary, hello my darling
She picks her up, hugs her tightly, showers kisses on her
Sylvia starts crying again
How beautiful she is
Her hair has grown
Look how much she changed,  missed it all missed her so much
Peter, in a kind of daze, stares at Sylvia
Without looking at Peter, she dries her eyes and tries to stop crying
wanted to make life difficult for Jack but  never thought 'd miss her so much
(still in a fog) Oh, yeah
make life difficult for Jack
118
Is he here
What
Is Jack here
(snapping out of it) Oh, yeah, yeah, 'll go get him
He exits like a sleepwalker and goes straight into Michael's room
The latter is asleep
Peter sits down on the edge of Michael's bed and gently shakes him
Michael, Michael
Sylvia's here
Michael wakes up and looks at Peter
Mary's leaving
117
-                                         117 Peter's giving Mary her bottle, Jack is carefully putting all her stuff into a bag -- bottles, nipples, cereals, etc
In the doorway Sylvia, with reddened eyes, silently watches them
(to himself) Let's see, the five bottles, the little bottles for water, the strainer for her cereal
(to Sylvia) Do you have a blender
blender
For bananas and carrots and stuff
It's time for her to start eating them
No,  don't have a blender
119
Okay, you can have ours
He stuffs the blender into the bag
Mary has now finished her bottle
(to Peter) Do you want me to take her
No,  have to burp her first
With dexterity, he places Mary face down on his shoulder and walks around in the kitchen, patting her on the back
(to Sylvia) Here, could you give these to Michael so he can pack them with the clothes
He hands two bibs to Sylvia
Sylvia walks through the apartment, and stops in front of Michael's room, where she looks strangely at the changing table with its mattress, its pretty sheet, and the baby's toilet articles
Sylvia enters the living room
Michael has spread all of Mary's clothes, neatly folded and ironed on the couch
He is packing them in a big bag
Here are the bibs
Jack told me to give them
(taking the bibs) Thanks
put the woolen things on the bottom and the diapers and lighter things on top, because you'll need those first
(her mind is elsewhere) Yeah, sure
Michael bustles about
Sylvia's gaze comes to rest on the crib which stands imposingly in the middle of the living room
Music boxes, little booties and stuffed animals are hanging from the bars, and a pretty white tulle frames the crib
120
You'll have to come back and get the crib later
Yeah
118
-                                          118 taxi is there
Behind the    wheel the driver sits waiting
Sylvia is sitting    in the back, on the side nearest the sidewalk, and on   her lap is Mary, whom she's gently fondling
On the sidewalk, beside the   open trunk of the cab, are all Mary's belongings:    some bags, the playpen, a stroller, the baby bathtub,   the changing table, etc
Peter is attempting to pack it all in the trunk
Michael is handing the things to him
(tense) Give me the playpen first
(equally tense) Then where are you gonna put the tub
(annoyed) Just give me the playpen
Need some help
No, no thanks
'd rather do it myself
Jack is standing beside the back door of the cab, leaning over toward Sylvia, who is holding Mary
He is trying unsuccessfully to sound angry
You really screwed us over but good -- you know that
know, 'm sorry
Really
Our lives have been out of control for the past six months
121
Yeah,  bet
Actually, that was kind of the point
But 'm the one who really got screwed
She starts to cry again
Don't cry, c'mon
you're taking her back now, it's great
(wiping her eyes) Yeah, it's great
'you have enough money
Can you manage all right
Yeah, sure
'm not loaded, but it's okay -- 'm working, 've got modeling jobs lined up
Do you have a boyfriend
No
That's the last thing  need
've got my work
And now 've got her
She rubs noses with Mary
Peter and Michael approach
That's it, we fit it all in
Okay, then
well, 'bye
The three men are lined up on the sidewalk
Mary stares at them, looking a little lost
They wave their hands and: , 'Bye, Mary
and waves
(with a big, sad smile) Okay, well, thanks again -- 'Bye
, 122
'Bye
The   up, pulls away, and disappears
(playfully) Well, that's that
Yeah
Right
That's that
They head back to their apartment building
Oh shit --  forgot to explain about the cereal
She'll figure it out by herself
Yeah, she'll manage
Now it's back to the good life for us
Sleeping late
Different women every night
can't wait
Forget about the New York-Washington shuttle
'm off to Caracas
And 'm gonna be able to get back to work, so Carl better watch it -- 'm gonna slaughter that son-of-a-bitch
First with this goddam competition
and then with Natalie
And 've got six months' worth of sex to catch up on with Cathy, Nora, Frances, Susan, Barbra
They have entered the elevator
The doors close
They come out of the elevator, in front of their apartment
Christie, Paula, Sheila, Lisa, Kimberly, Rhonda, Rebecca, Louisa
123
But not necessarily in that order
They enter the apartment and Peter walks on something that lets out a
Oh, she forgot her squeaky giraffe
He picks it up and throws it onto an armchair
119
-                                        119 Jack takes a running jump and does a cannonball into the pool of a luxury hotel somewhere in the world
He splashes two girls who find it very funny
120
-                                              120 Peter, with a bouquet of flowers, runs like mad down a street
121
-                                         121 Michael and Sophia are having a big discussion about contemporary art in the midst of a sophisticated crowd at an opening
Michael is vehement, gesturing wildly, and so is Sophia
They're both talking at once, not listening to each other, and enjoying it immensely
122
-                                        122 Peter, all out of breath, comes rushing into the office where Natalie works
She is very surprised
He puts the flowers down on her desk
These are for you
'm not supposed to leave the office
(') They think 'm in the bathroom
So  can't stay
'Bye
He dashes back out
Natalie cracks up, laughing
123
-                                       123 Jack is running on the tarmac; he quickly mounts the stairs to his plane as he waves a heartrending goodbye to a young woman he's left behind in the airport
At the top step, he bumps into another young woman: it's 124
love at first sight
124
-                                    124 Michael is in bed
It's noon, the sun's shining brightly, and a  is asleep beside him
Michael is on the phone
Peter
Yeah
What
Yow-ee
Hooray
Terrific
That's fantastic
'll call Jack -- We're gonna celebrate tonight
He hangs up
The Blonde is now awake
They won
They won
Who won
Peter
He won the competition
Great
Who's Peter
125
-                                125 Peter enters the apartment with Natalie
bunch of crepe paper streamers are hanging in the hall, as well as posters with various things written on them: ' #1
,
, , Jack comes running in with a bottle of champagne, he the
Jack hugs Peter tightly as Michael comes in with glasses and tries to catch the champagne that's flowing all over
They all shout and go bananas celebrating
126
-                                  126 Peter has his arm around Natalie's waist
She's a little drunk
He kisses her and leads her into his room, clos- ing the door behind him
Michael and Jack, who were spying on them, tiptoe over to the door
They are silently exulting over Peter's second victory
127
-                     127 125
Michael enters a fancy building on 5th Avenue
He's carrying a big portfolio and is full of beans
In the lobby, he pushes the button for the elevator and looks around absentmindedly
His gaze suddenly freezes on something
By the guard's desk he notices a stroller
Inside, look- ing pretty bored, is
Michael is overwhelmed
He walks toward Mary and through the sea of people -- they exchange an intense look
He looks around and suddenly sees Sylvia and two men deep in discussion coming out of an elevator
Michael, startled, runs and hides behind one of the elevators, staring out wide-eyed
Sylvia is dressed in a very chic, tight black suit, with a veiled little black hat and spiked heels
One of the men is carrying a bunch of cameras
They walk out toward the front door, and Sylvia suddenly stops
She seems to have forgotten something
She kisses them goodbye and heads toward the elevator
Once she's out of their sight, she turns and waits for them to leave
When they're gone for sure, she rushes toward Mary and showers her with kisses
Here you are, my angel
Are you okay, honey
Mommy's finished now, you've been a very, very good girl
(to Guard) Thanks a lot for looking after her
Oh, she's been great
She wheels the stroller over to the door and quickly takes off her high heels, and her hat, and stuffs them into a big bag
She takes out a pair of old shoes and a comfortable jacket, and slips them on
She removes the pins from her hair -- she looks like her normal self again
She leaves, pushing the stroller out the door
Michael stands frozen
128
-                                       128 Jack, in the corridor of a large modern hotel somewhere 126
in the world
He is full of energy and playful excite- ment
He's with a few of his colleagues, both men and women
They say good night to each other
Everyone goes into his or her own room
Jack's the last one, he goes into his room alone
His smile drops
For a moment he stands there just looking
He sits down on the bed: on the pillow is a little chocolate Santa Claus with a card that reads "Merry Christmas
The Marriott Hotels
" Jack contemplates it forlornly
129
'  -                              129 Michael and Sophia, both in kimonos, are sitting in front of the last bits of an elegant midnight supper, in Michael's room
The bed in unmade
Sophia, a glass of champagne in her hand, is yakking away nonstop, like a real motor-mouth
Michael, silent, is doodling on a paper napkin
His pen is making little squares and circles; the circles come together and start looking like a baby lying in a crib
Sophia is absorbed in her monologue
Suddenly Michael realizes what he has drawn
He crumples the napkin and throws it in the wastebasket
Sophia hasn't noticed anything
Michael is bored stiff
130
-                                   130 Peter comes home with Natalie
They take off their coats
They look tired
(in a bad mood) Oh, my feet are killing me
She takes off her shoes and collapses in the armchair in the hall
There is a   noise
She reaches underneath her and brings out a rubber giraffe
What the hell is this
Oh, it's a giraffe
(tosses it away and walks off) Oh, by the way, have you 127
heard anything about that kid, you know, the one you had here for a while
Peter stares at the giraffe, horrified
He feels the tears coming to his eyes
Grabbing the giraffe, he hurls it with all his might against the wall
131
-                                        131 Jack's in his plane, at the controls, waiting for takeoff
He's daydreaming
His - comes in and joins him
- Hey, what's the matter with you
Whadda you mean, what's the matter with me
- Are you sick
Me
No
'm fine
- 'mon, Jack
Didn't you see who we've got on board today
Sure  did, why
- Well
look
(turning around to look) So it's the Rockettes, so what
- And you're just sitting there like that
Whaddaya mean, sitting there
happen to be getting ready to fly this airplane
- Okay, forget it
132
-                                    132 128
Jack, alone in his room, with his back to us, is facing his full-length mirror
He's looking at himself, with one fist on his hip and the other hand clutching a half-empty bottle of scotch
He observes himself and slowly turns around -- we can now see him in profile
His hair is disheveled, he's unshaven, and he's put a pillow underneath his sweater
He's pregnant
He takes a big swig of scotch
The Jack walks away from the mirror
He staggers dead drunk
But dignified, pregnant
Jack opens the door
Standing there is Graton holding a stuffed animal, a rabbit
Hi
(out of it) Hi
Don't you recognize me
(in a total fog) Wait
uh, no
'm the one who was tailing you
Remember, in the park
Oh, yeah, the park
the diaper and all
That's it, the diaper
But don't worry
This isn't an investigation,  left the force four months ago, and anyway, they've arrested the whole gang since then
just wanted to ask you something
Have you noticed
'm pregnant
(neutrally) Oh yeah,  see
So, shall we go for a walk
129
133
-                                 133 Graton and Jack are sitting on a bench beside the East River
Jack, still pregnant, has brought along his bottle of scotch, and he takes a swig from it occasion- ally
Graton has brought along his rabbit
There's something  have to know
Wouldn't you like to be pregnant
What
Oh sure
maybe
no
dunno
Look, there's been something bothering me for a long time
You see, if  was God, and  could create the world all over again, here's what  would do:  would create Adam from Eve's rib, not the other way around
(having trouble following) Really
(') That's an interesting idea
Actually,  just wanted to ask you
At least that way things would have been clearer to begin with, y'see
They wouldn't have made us believe that somebody could come out of our rib, y'know
'Cause nothing ever comes out of our rib, y'know
Ever
Only out of our prick, and even then Everything still has to be done after that
(very unsure) That's for sure
What we men know how to make is planes, buildings, cars, and all that stuff
It's useful, mind 130
you
It's driving me crazy
This thing keeps going around and around in my head
And you know what, it's not even like they wanted us to believe it -- it might have been us who wanted to believe it
But let's face it, nobody comes out of our rib
(dives right in) Was the dope in the diaper, yes or no
Still, that's hard to take, goddam it
Was it in the diaper, or not
The dope
It was in the diaper, why
(getting up) Oh, thanks a lot
feel so much better now
Here, this is a rabbit for your baby
(shakes both Jack's hands) Thanks again, 'bye, 'm so happy
Graton goes off, floating on cloud nine
(reaching out toward him with the rabbit) But wait -- the baby's gone
134
-                                   134 Jack and Michael, slumped in their chairs, are having breakfast
It's a gray day
It's  out
Peter, bending over a bowl of steaming water, with a towel over his head, is inhaling the steam
When he looks up to speak, we see his swollen tear-streaked 131
face
(extremely, in fact, too playful) Tomorrow, San Francisco
(grim) Say hello to the Pacific for me
(even more playful) 'll be back the day after tomorrow
(emerging from the bowl, congested) You'll be id a foul bood -- jet lag really wipes out you dow
(annoyed) Whaddya mean, now
Yeah: you didd't used to give a shit before, but dow it docks you out
(very hostile) Before what
(putting his head back over the bowl) How would  dow
'Before,' that's all
(on edge) It doesn't knock me out at all
Is there any jam left
Do
Silence
You eatig here todight
132
(playful again) No, 'm going to the movies tonight with, uh
damn,  can't remember her name
'mean the Japanese one
(suddenly very weary) No, she's from Finland
Oh damn it
What the hell's her name
They've got such weird names
Magdalena
no, Marianna
no oh,  can't remember -- anyway it's Ma-something or other
Mary
sudden, weighty silence ensues
This fuckig cold
look like 'b cryig all the tibe but 'b dot -- it's just this dab cold
He gets up and goes out
135
'   -                   135 Jack, holding a bouquet of flowers and Graton's rabbit, rings the doorbell of an apartment
On the door a card reads "
" chubby   with thick glasses opens the door
Hi
Is Sylvia in
No, she'll be back in a couple of hours -- around midnight, she said
(disappointed) Oh
Wanna come in and wait for her
Sure
Why not
133
He follows the Young Man in Sylvia's studio
It's very messy
On the table there's a big heap of books and papers
Mary, sitting on the floor, is wearing a diaper and a sweater, but her legs are bare
She's playing with an empty pack of cigarettes
She looks at Jack with a serious, unruffled expression
Sylvia doing okay
don't know -- 'm a med student
'm just babysitting
only met her a couple hours ago
Oh,  see
Silence
The Young Man sits down at the table and immerses himself in his books
Mary doesn't look up from her pack of cigarettes anymore
Listen, on second thought, don't think 'll wait for her
Just give her this when she gets back, okay
And this is for the baby
Jack hands the bouquet and the rabbit to the Young Man, who plops them down on a chair
Sure, no problem
He immerses himself again in his books
Jack heads toward the door, then turns around
Shouldn't the baby be in bed by now
Yeah
don't know
When put her to bed she cries so just let her stay up
Don't you have any tights to put on her legs
Tights
Well, it's pretty hot in here anyway
134
Jack gets out of there in a hurry
136
-                               136 Jack, in his pilot's uniform, is sitting on the living room couch
Michael is standing before him
You want me to call them
No
But you've got to let them know
No, 'm not going anywhere anymore, 've had it with traveling quit
'mon, 'll call you a cab, you've still got time
Don't you call anybody
But the plane's s'posed to take off in half an hour -- They won't have time to replace you
This is serious -- you'll lose your job and you won't be able to pay your share of the apartment anymore
you
Jack takes off his pilot's jacket and throws it aside
'll be a dishwasher, 'll live in a flophouse
What the hell happened
'm not going,  told you; 'm not going ever again
'm sick and tired of traveling, sick and tired of broads
They all have the same asses and  can't seem to love them anyway
can't take another hotel room, and swimming pools and trendy restaurants
want to know 135
what my life's all about
Do you know what your life's about, Michael
Michael has no answer to these questions
He leaves
137
-                                    137 Michael, wearing an apron and holding a wooden spoon, goes into Jack's room
The latter, lying on his bed, is smoking and staring at the ceiling
Come on,  made us a good dinner
bought some filet mignon and Haagen-Dazs butter pecan
When Peter comes back he'll cheer you up
He's been here all day
He has
didn't hear him
He's in his room
What
Michael heads towards Peter's room
Jack feebly gets up and follows him
Michael knocks on the door
No answer
Peter
Dinner's ready
Still no answer
Michael opens the door:      Peter's lying face-down on his bed
He's holding the rubber giraffe and sobbing
Michael and Jack, dismayed, stare at him
Peter hides his face in his arm
Jack and Michael go to the kitchen and sit down to their steaks, totally depressed
138
-                                    138 The
bare-chested Michael, in jeans, drags himself over to the front door and opens it
There stands Sylvia with Mary in her stroller
136
Sylvia is a disheveled mess
Is Jack here
'Cause 'm a mess
can't handle it, 'm all alone
(shouting towards Jack's room) Jack
Jack, c'mere for Chrissake
'Cause my place is tiny, y'know, and my schedule's insane -- and just finished four days of posing and we ended up every day at
Jack, bare-chested, comes in pulling on his jeans
He stops short at the front door
Sylvia is about to cry
(to Jack) Yeah, y'see, Jack,  just did four days of posing
Yeah
And every day we finished at three in the morning and since Mary always gets up around 5:30
Yeah
Well, you can imagine how much sleep 've gotten
Yeah, of course, 'cause after the 5:30 bottle it starts all over again around nine
And by the time  change her and play with her a little, it's already eight o'clock
And then that's it -- you get only an hour of sleep
And the babysitters till three -- all my money is sucked 137
down the tubes
Plus they don't put the kids to bed, they let them lie around half-naked
Oh, so the flowers and the rabbit were from you
could have strangled that guy
mean it,  can't cope anymore
My parents and  don't talk to each other and anyway they live in Texas, and the baby needs to get out to the park
Yeah, tell me about it
Finding time to take her to the park every day is a real bitch
And  have to work,  need the money to survive and anyway love my job
distraught Peter, bare-chested and in jeans, comes running in from his room
But to work 've gotta have a babysitter, and to have a babysitter  need to work, so  run around all day
(she sobs) and 'm not sure 'm taking good care of her
Of course you're taking good care of her -- we know what it's like, don't cry, she looks great
(sobbing) It's just 'cause  haven't slept in four nights -- she must be teething or something,  don't know but  can't manage
Don't worry, it's nothing, she's 138
cutting a tooth -- you just have to put some stuff on her gums
She pulled the same thing on us
We lost all our friends in one night -- on account of one tooth
And just look    at my face
Nobody's going    to want me to model for them    with the way my face looks
And what'll happen to me if they    don't want me anymore
But you're beautiful -- At your age all you need is a good night's sleep and you'll look like new
Right, a good night's sleep -- but when
Well, why don't you leave the baby with us for a few days, till you recuperate
mean, if you want
We're old pros -- it's not a big deal for us
(blowing her nose, wiping her eyes) Really
can leave her with you for a little while
Of course
Leave her with us
Come back whenever you want
Get some rest
Sylvia, between two sobs, picks up a big bag beside her on the doorstep
brought a couple of things for her, just for a few days
Michael eagerly takes the bag from her
It's followed by a second, and then a third
139
(taking Mary in his arms) Is she hungry
Yeah, it's time for her bottle -- it's all ready in the bag
'll go heat up some water right away
Would you like a cup of coffee
Oh, okay, thanks
Peter, carrying Mary towards the kitchen, is followed by Jack and Michael with the bags
Sylvia blows her nose and walks around aimlessly in the hall
In the kitchen the three men bustle about with the bags, the bottle, the saucepan
They've swallowed all their pride and are kissing Mary all over, on her neck, her hands, her tummy
They're deliriously happy
Michael takes some sheets out of the bag
'll go make up her bed
He exits, and, once in the corridor, prances around, leaping and dancing
He gets to the living room and goes over to the crib: suddenly, he recoils and freezes, a fearful expression on his face
Then he turns and races back to the kitchen
(floored) Hey, you guys -- come and see, come and see
What
Come see,  said
Jack and Peter nervously follow Michael into the living room
They stop short in front of the crib: There is Sylvia, curled up in a fetal position, sucking her thumb and sleeping like an angel
The poor thing, she's really wiped out
140
She'll need two or three months to recover, at least
Maybe more
We could set up a room for her here
room for her and a room for Mary
Then we could have four shifts instead of three
Yeah, but  don't think she'll agree
She's got her own life to live
Yeah, she probably wouldn't want to move here
She'd think we'd jump on her any chance we could
But we'd make a rule, she'd just be 'one of the guys
' She'll never want to
(very awake) So, 'll take the ten
to three shift
And 'll take every other night
plus the walk in the park in the afternoon before go to work
and we split the rent equally
and 'll just be 'one of the guys'
deal
, , (smiling broadly) Deal
Mary    suddenly comes in from the kitchen, walking unstead- ily    but determinedly
She's dragging Graton's rabbit by its    ear
She looks at the four of them and laughs her head    off
