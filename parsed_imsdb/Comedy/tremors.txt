Wilson & Brent Maddock's "Tremors" Written by Wilson & Brent Maddock WD6 6/21/88 1
-                                    1 The high desert -- absolutely silent -- a vast, hard land- scape stretching away to distant mountains
The silence is broken by hoof-beats
2
'  -                                     2 It's a simple cabin dwarfed by a big, ramshackle barn (60s), a weathered desert rat of a hermit, is walking his donkey around in circles
Now, rattling toward them down an endless dirt road, comes an old, sun-bleached Buick
It stops and out leans (70s) wearing a sweat-stained fedora
The two friends nod
How's she doing
She wants to lay down
'm a little worried
Old Fred climbs out with a bushel basket of carrots
Well,  brung her something  know she likes
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those
Forget it
got vegetables coming out my ears
Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately ain't so much as seen a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres
If that ain't the truth
And count on them for a little bit of stew meat
Thank you, Fred
Edgar takes the carrots and feeds one to the donkey
(cont'd) Here you go, Justine
Look what Fred brought you
We playing cards tonight
think 'm gonna be sitting up with her
'd do the same
Well, catch you Thursday
You bet
The men nod, and Old Fred drives off
- of the donkey's hooves thumping along as Edgar leads her to the barn
(cont'd) Let's get you out of the sun for a spell
(cont'd) 'll get you some fresh water
But, suddenly, we hear the donkey restlessly stomping its hooves and braying
Edgar turns, concerned
Now we hear an odd sound
Distant thunder
The wind
The donkey gets more and more frantic
The barn shudders violently
Frightened birds explode from the eaves
Dust puffs from every old seam
Roof shingles rain down
Edgar stares in amazement
(cont'd) some kind of earthquake Then another sound -- the donkey starts screeching in wild panic
(cont'd) Justine, hang on
'm coming
Edgar races back to the barn and flings open the doors
3
'  -                                      3 Dust swirls through the air
But -- the barn in empty
No donkey
Now Edgar is hit by a ghastly stench
He staggers back, and covers his nose with a handkerchief
Then he sees, splattered across the walls -- blood What in the name of Jehovah
He raises his arms above the door frame
When he lowers them he's holding a 12 gauge shotgun
He races outside, ready to shoot, but there's nothing -- as far as the eye can see

-                                           4 The sun lights up spectacular sheer cliffs which plunge 1000 feet from a ruggedly beautiful high-desert plateau
At the top of the cliffs, silhouetted against the dawn, a lone cow- boy seems to gaze in deep contemplation at the sunrise
As we  , we realize he's actually peeing over the cliff
This is   (25)
Smart and good looking, Val has nevertheless managed to underachieve brilliantly
He coasts through life, following the path of least resistance -- which has brought him to this dubious rustic existence on the edge of civilization
But lately he's beginning to wonder why he hasn't accomplished more in his 25 years
As a few sleepy cows gaze at him, sleepy Val shuffles over to his battered old pickup truck
hand-painted sign on the door reads: " &  -- All Type's of Job's
"  Indeed, the pick-up bed is jumbled with tools and supplies for every conceivable odd job -- and the noisily snoring form of his partner huddled in a dirty sleeping bag
Val raps on the side of the truck
(softly) Good morning, Mr
Bassett, this is your wake-up call
Please move your fat ass
No response from the sleeping bag
Val stares at the cows chewing their cud -- and perks up as he gets an idea
He gently steps onto the truck's running board, then suddenly starts jumping up and down as hard as he can, rocking the truck violently
(cont'd) , The sleeping bag tries to get up and run for it
It tumbles out of the back of the pickup
While Val laughs uproar- iously,   (43) claws his way out of the bag, looks around wildly, and finds himself staring at three motionless cows
You dumb shit
Earl is a good-ol' boy who has lived his life just like Val, drifting from job to job
He knows why he hasn't accom- plished anything, and often tries to impart his hard-won wisdom to Val, but the last thing the younger man wants is advice
Earl stretches
The men begin a silent ritual:  Earl gropes through his pockets for a cigarette, but only finds a lighter
Meanwhile, Val digs in his pockets, coming up with cigarettes, but no lighter
Typical of these two, each guy always has half of what he needs
Eventually they sort it out,  trading the necessary implements
Earl reaches for a coffee-pot on a battered Coleman stove on the tailgate
But it's cold
You didn't cook breakfast
Did it yesterday
Franks and beans
(tries to recall) No
it was eggs
did eggs
Hell you did
Your turn
Earl raises his fist
This is The Challenge, and it instantly triggers the partners' conflict-resolution technique
They solve all disputes using the children's game of "scissors, rock, paper
"  Earl raises his fist in response
The game is played swiftly and silently -- one, two, three
On three, Val mimes "paper" (open hand
Earl mimes "scissors" (two extended fingers)
Scissors cuts paper
Val has lost
He shrugs and starts pumping up the stove fuel tank
(cont'd) Well, when 'm your age 'll probably forget what  eat, too
4A
-  -                           4A Val and Earl are restringing a dilapidated, and seemingly endless, barbed wire fence
few bored cows watch them
How many cows does it take to make a stampede
Is it like three or more
Is there a minimum speed
(shakes his head) was in one
bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree
Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon
Wasn't so damn funny, can  tell you
Earl's hand slips and the fence snags him right through his thick glove
(cont'd) Ow
God damn
Is this a job for intelligent men
If there was one nearby 'd probably ask him
keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and
(mock serious) Handymen, Earl
We're handymen
Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment
Val gestures to the vastness around them
What, and give up all this personal freedom
5
-                                        5 Val guides the truck down a tortuous, rocky, almost impas- sable trail
It takes full concentration as he fights the steering wheel, shifts, rides the brake and leans out trying to pick a decent route
Earl braces his feet on the dash and munches breakfast, a raw hot dog right out of the package
Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year
(shrugs) Has a lot of rain
Earl pulls a box of Hershey bars from under the seat
There's only one bar left
He sets the box down between them
Val glances at it -- and raises his fist: The Challenge
One, two, three
Val mimes "paper;" Earl mimes "rock
"  Earl loses
Val takes the bar
(pointing ahead) You're gonna get us hung up
Do not talk to the driver
The truck lurches to a stop, its frame caught on a big rock
Val glares at Earl

- -  -                6 The pick-up turns from a dirt road onto an old paved road
(
) What do we have next
7
- -  -                                  7 Earl consults a crumpled list pulled from inside his hat
Uh
Digging that waterhole for Nestor
Burt and Heather's place is closer
Let's do their kitchen today
Do Nestor tomorrow
Nestor's out of town tomorrow
We don't dig today
We don't get paid today
Damn it, Valentine, you never plan ahead
You never take the long view
Hell, here it is Monday and 'm already working on Wednesday
(squints dubiously at his schedule) It is Monday, right
But Val is peering at the desert up ahead
Off the road a ways is a small Toyota pick-up truck and, beside it, a lone figure trying to flag them down
Who the hell's that
That's not what's his name
the grad student
Nah, it's September
Must be the new one
The new one
That's supposed to be a girl
Earl braces himself, knowing what Val will do
Val swerves the truck wildly off the road, barreling across the desert
(cont'd) (almost praying) You will have long blonde hair, big green eyes, nice full breasts that stand up and say hello, ass that won't quit
And legs, legs that go all the way up
Earl shakes his head, mildly bemused as they slide to a stop in a cloud of dust
8
- '  -                           8 Val looks out hopefully
The dust clears
He sees her -- LeBECK, (25)
Val's eyes do an expert vertical scan: short brown hair, small brown eyes, so-so chest, legs hidden in baggy dungarees
Laden with a portable computer, notebooks, and some seismograph printouts, she stares at him through tilted glasses
Her little pick-up truck is loaded with geology field equipment
She shakes Val's hand firmly
(brightly) Hi, 'm Rhonda
Rhonda LeBeck
'm up here for the semester
Yeah, geography
Right, geology
And you have to be Val and Earl
've heard all about you
We deny everything
Rhonda smiles
Listen, got a question for you
Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that
Around here
Why would they
Well, 'm supposed monitor these seismographs
You know, they measure vibrations
Yeah, vibrations in the ground
Yeah, well, 'm getting what refer to scientifically as "weird vibes
"  every sensor 've got is giving me strange readings mean, the school has had these machines up here three years and they've never recorded anything like this
Well, we'll ask around
Let you know if we hear of anything
Thanks
God,  hope they're not screwed up
might have to bag the whole semester
Anyway, sorry to bother you
No problem
Nice meeting you
Hope you get it sorted out
Rhonda unhappily turns back to her equipment as Val and Earl drive off
9
-  -  -                            9 Earl glances over at Val with a gleam in his eye
You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her
What the hell do we know about seismographs
Nothing
But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her
Why
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours  to
Well, sure
And is dumber than my hind end
Like that Bobby Lynn Dexter
Val flips down the truck's sunvisor
Tapes to it are snap- shots of nearly identical blonde bimbos
Val points to one
(defensively) Tammy Lynn Baxter
Don't matter
They're all the same: dead weight
Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails
Make my skin crawl
Well, 'm a victim of circumstance
thought you called it your pecker
Look, don't make the mistake  made
Twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like Miss October 1968, and where'd it get me
Here with you
Val rolls his eyes -- "Give me a break
" 10
-  -                            10 The pick-up rattles toward a tiny, utterly isolated high desert hamlet -- a few dozen houses and mobile homes fighting for shade in the vast landscape
Its most prominent feature is an aging wood-frame water tower, perhaps 25 feet high, near the center of town
sign  into view -- " -- Pop
14
" 11
'  -                                  11 Val and Earl head past the water tower for Pham Van's General Store, Perfection's main gossip stop and only business
The store's sign, in English and Vietnamese, reads: "Groceries, Haircuts, Post Office, Town Hall, "  Val and Earl park next to a camouflage-painted, large-tired Blazer
Just then they spot , the town's surly teen-aged pain- in-the-ass, coming toward them, mindlessly bouncing a basketball off the hoods of parked cars
As he nears their truck: Melvin, touch that truck and die
Oh, man, 'm really shaking
But he steers clear of their truck
12
'  -                                12 Inside, the energetic Vietnamese owner,  , presides over his all-purpose establishment: part general store, part barber shop, part saloon
At the bar are   and his wife , two no- nonsense survivalists who have settled in Perfection to await the coming apocalypse -- a nice enough couple, but there's a hint of paranoia around the edges
Burt is shoving a box of cartridges across to Pham
No, Pham, they're not hollow points
ordered hollow points and that's what  want
When Val and Earl enter, Pham automatically pops the tops on two cold beers and has them in place before the cowboys reach the bar
Everyone exchanged nods
Hi, guys, what you been up to
Ran into the new college student, Rona
Rhonda
Rhonda LeBeck
She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things
Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there
next thing the Feds will be at our door
"Sorry, time to move
Eminent domain
" Down, honey, down
Yeah, Burt
The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War Heather and Pham laugh
Burt smiles patiently
Just then the compressor in Pham's ice cream freezer comes on
It's a loud chug-chug-chug sound mixed with a high-pitched squeal
Hey Val, listen
Bearing going out, you think
Could be
He starts toward the compressor, but Earl heads him off
Catch it later, Pham
Gotta get over to Nestor's
Right
We plan ahead
That way we don't do anything right now
Earl explained it to me
As they turn to go, Val does a take, amazed, as he spots a decorative bleached-out cattle skull displayed on the counter -- with a $29
95 price tag
(cont'd) Hey, Pham Van, what the hell is this
beauty, isn't it
We bought three of them for the rec room
(whispers to Pham Van) We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece
(deadpan) And  appreciate it
(playfully) You don't get it, Pham
The idea was: we were ripping you off
Suddenly a car alarm blares from outside
Burt's out the door in a flash
The others follow
13
'  -                                  13 Burt races out and shouts at Melvin who back guiltily away from Burt's camouflage Blazer
Melvin, you little pain-in-the-ass
It wasn't me, man
Your truck's just screwed up, that's all
Burt angrily switches off the alarm
Val and Earl laugh as they climb into their truck
Why don't his parents ever take him to Vegas with them
You gotta ask that 14
-                                               14 At one end of town, Earl maneuvers a huge bulldozer with a scoop-loader blade through a choking cloud of dust, scouring out a shallow pit to serve as a watering hole
Val sights down a row of stakes which mark one end of the pit
The job is done
He signals Earl to cut the engine
Both men have kerchiefs covering their faces and are totally encrusted with dust
15     -   -                                   15 Nearby is an old battered truck trailer -- the massive, solid steel kind used for heavy rock hauling
Tires flat, mired in dried mud and weeds, it hasn't been used in years
Now it provides welcome shade as the men sit sipping some coffee
drives up, surveying the pit with approval
It came out great, boys
Should fill up just fine come the next rain
Lemme have your bill
Earl and Val start fishing in their pockets for pen and paper
Earl comes up with various pieces of paper, Val with three or four pens
It's a moment before they realize each has the other needed implement
Earl writes out the bill during: (cont'd) 'll have to send it to you the first of the month, boys
Val and Earl exchange pained looks
(cont'd) Now, you know 'm good for it
Yeah, Nestor, we know
Don't worry about it
Catch us when you can
They amble over to their truck
Earl takes the driver's side -- and starts fishing in his pockets for the key
(cont'd) Are we too easy-going
No, we're not too easy-going
This area is economically depressed
Val realizes he has the key and hands it over
So what if we just did it
today
Pack up
Drive straight down to Bixby
Get serious
We could
We could
But we'd have to get really serious
It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place
So
That car wash pays good, and they're always looking
Car wash
That's got no future
If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that
Yeah, sure
Go ahead and plan it
for a year or two
16
'  -                                     16 a stencilled sign:  ' - -- , to see Val and Earl have rented a portable septic pump (perhaps trailer mounted)
The aged machine reeks of and drips with its ignoble cargo
The intake hose has been repaired so often it looks to be more tape than hose
Grimacing Val threads the slimy hose down through the open top of Viola's cesspool
Beside them is Viola's well-kept mobile home on a low hill not far from Pham Van's store
Well-kept flower gardens surround the place
, a sweet little old lady, watches the men work while straining to hold the leash of her tiny but ferocious dog
The dog yaps continuously, lunging at Val and Earl
Stop it
Stop it, you horrid animal
(to Val and Earl) 'm going to give her back to my son
swear it
Hey, Viola, you've got my permission
God almighty, my mama sure didn't raise me for this
Val gets up and starts the pump's gas engine
Well, you're the one won't work in the car wash
You're the one's gotta have a plan
Damn it, Val
Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this
Earl angrily throws the pump valve and starts the pump mechanism
He and Val on stand either side of the intake hose as it gurgles happily
What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet
was up for going to Bixby
was getting excited
In the past year  must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection
We gotta better ourselves
"  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think 'm the reason we're still here
You want to know how close am to going to Bixby right now 'll call that little bluff
How close
The gurgling intake hose ruptures, showering them with -- well you know
They react as if they'd been shot; gagging, staggering, screaming obscenities
17
'  -                           17 Val and Earl's beat-up mobile home is just down the street from Pham Van's store
Val and Earl, now in cleaner clothes, march out resolutely
Val has a portable  in one hand and a framed  beer sign in the other
Earl unhooks the clothes line and dumps it, clothes and all, into the back of their truck, on top of the rest of their belongings
They stare at each other for a moment
This is it
No going back
They leap into the truck
As they drive off, Val leans out and yanks their wooden nameplate ("
Basset --
McKee") off the mailbox
18
'  -                                     18 They haven't gone fifty yards when they spot (40s) working in front of her house
The guys pull their hats low over their faces
Earl swerves to the far side of the street
Uh oh, it's Nancy
She wants another load of firewood
Forget it, man
It's not worth it
Nancy spots them and beckons excitedly
She's got us
Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection
That's the plan
They stop beside Nancy
While they talk, Nancy's daughter, (9), comes bouncing along on her pogo-stick, listening to her Walkman and slowly circling the truck
Mindy, honey, don't pogo in the street
Hey, guys, 've got a job for you
Sorry, Nancy
We ain't doing odd jobs anymore
We're headed for Bixby permanent
(skeptical) Oh, sure
(sees stuff in back of truck) My God, you really are
Yep, we're relocating to an area with a greater economic base
(to Mindy, over her music) Hey, Mindy, what's the count
Six hundred three, six hundred four, six hundred five
Go for it
Gee, guys
made the big decision
'm putting in that satellite dish
was going to offer you five hundred dollars
Val and Earl glance at each other -- five hundred dollars
19
- -  -                       19 The truck roars toward the "Leaving Perfection" sign
Val and Earl are elated, downright giddy
We did it
We faced temptation and we did not bend
Damn straight
Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing
They zoom past the sign
(cont'd) Last time we'll see that sign
They laugh, then are thrown half out of their seats as Earl accidentally hits a big pothole
Last time we hit that goddamn pothole
20
-  -                                     20 As the truck streaks across the landscape
Val and Earl merrily continue their good-byes to whatever is visible
(
) So long, cactus
(
) Adios, bridge
21
-                                       21 On its way down from the high desert, the lonely road now winds through a twisting, narrow canyon
county highway maintenance truck is parked to one side and two road workers, and , repair a slide-damaged section of the road, Carmine breaking up asphalt with a jackhammer
Val and Earl pull up, hand them each a beer, and speed away, shouting: Last time down this damn twisty road
22
-                                             22 The pick-up speeds past a small shack
Val and Earl automatically roll up their windows
In a moment we see why: a monster, ferocious dog comes galloping out to chase their truck
Earl gives the dog the finger
Last chance, asshole
Run, run
23
'  -                                  23 Old Fred latches the gate on his corral filled with sheep
He looks up as Val and Earl's truck speeds past
Val and Earl honk their horn and wave happily
Old Fred waves back
24
-   -                          24 The pick-up zooms along, the road now paralleling a line of tall high-tension electrical towers
25
/
-  -  -                       25 The guys have calmed down, but each is still dreaming of a new life
Okay, here's the plan
We bust our tails in the car wash six months
well, maybe nine
and we don't spend a dime , you know
And then we go for it
down payment on a tow-truck or a back-hoe or something, right
Start a real business
We can start looking for something today, tonight
Val points up ahead -- a man is sitting near the top of a distant electrical tower
Jeez, look at that guy
(shakes his head) One job 'd never take is working around electricity
Especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground
But as the pass the tower: (cont'd) Hey, hold up
That's Edgar Deems
You're full of shit
He's only got one damn jacket
That's him, 'm telling you
26
-                                  26 Earl pulls over
They climb out and peer up at the tower
Edgar is hard to see through the criss-crossing girders
(impressed) Man, oh, man
He must've really been drunk this time
(shouts) Edgar
What the hell you doing
Get on down from there
Edgar doesn't move
Val and Earl shift about uncomfortably
Well, shit, we can't leave him up there
They stare at each other
Someone's got to climb up
Val raises his fist in The Challenge
Their fingers fly
Rock breaks scissors
Val loses
Valentine unhappily climbs the tall tower while Earl watches from below
(cont'd) Hey, Edgar, don't you move
'm coming to get you
You damn fool, you owe me on this one
Higher and higher Val climbs
He tries not to look down
He's approaching Edgar from below and behind
As he gets nearer he begins to notice forboding details: one of Edgar's shoes is missing, half the trouser led is torn off
Edgar is strapped to a girder by his belt, his shotgun gripped in his hands
swarm of flies buzzes away
(cont'd) What the hell
He edges around to where he can see Edgar's face -- the eyes are wide open, staring
He's dead
27
'  -                                  27 Old Fred is now hoeing his garden
He glances up as Val and Earl's pick-up roars back toward Perfection
28
'  -                             28 big station wagon is parked between a small mobile home and a half-finished house being built by  and  , an out-going, energetic older couple
Lumber, cinder blocks, and tools are scattered around the yard
Jim examines Edgar's body in the bed of Val and Earl's pick- up truck
Val, Earl and Megan talk in subdued tones
Real sorry to bother you, Megan, but we figured since Jim's a doctor
No, it's fine
You did the right thing
When Jim is done we'll call the Coroner's office in Bixby
We'll take care of it
(shakes her head) Poor Edgar
(tries to break the mood) Well,  see you got all the wallboard up
That was easy
You two did the hard part
Sure sorry you're leaving
Jim climbs out of the pick-up
Was is a heart attack
(shaking his head) He died of dehydration
Thirst
But that doesn't make sense
That takes a couple of days, doesn't it
Three or four even
You mean he sat up there three or four days Just sat there till he died of thirst
Jim shrugs
Everyone is mystified
29
'  -                                  29 Fred is still hoeing
In the nearby pen his sheep start acting restless
He eyes them
What's up
We hear a strange muffled sound
Unseen, behind him, at the far end of the garden, his scarecrow mysteriously tilts
Old Fred keeps hoeing
He stops, his foot is caught in the dirt
Suddenly he is yanked knee-deep into the ground
30
-                                       30 Val and Earl's truck, again headed for Bixby, and going way too fast, zooms past the two workers still repairing the road
The workers glance up, annoyed
31
-                                             31 Val and Earl, sobered and deep in thought, drive past the shack where the ferocious dog lives
They automatically roll up their windows during: Reckon he hated Perfection more than us
You suppose he wanted to kill himself
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger
Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst
Come on, sombody must've chased him up there
Oh, you mean somebody who ain't scared of a twelve gauge shotgun
And then what did they do
Camp out down below and just wait for him to die
Val has no answer
It's too weird
Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place
You got that right
They are passing the shack
Earl suddenly realizes: (cont'd) Hey, where the hell's that asshole dog
(looking around) Probably up a pole starving itself to death
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way
We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee
'll go with that plan
32
'  -                                  32 the pick-up's tires skidding to a stop
to see we're back at Old Fred's
What are you doing
Earl is staring wide-eyed
Val follows Earl's gaze and is aghast when he sees -- The sheep pen -- it's a ghastly, bloody mess
Scattered on the churned up ground a few dismembered sheep legs and heads are all that remain of the flock
(whispers) What the hell
Val and Earl leap out of the truck to investigate
Hey, Old Fred
Fred
Where are you
Earl dashes into Fred's house
Val checks around outside
Earl comes back out
Not here
Then they spot something lying in the middle of the garden -- Old Fred's hat
Still looking all around, Val squats distractedly to pick up the hat
He and Earl stumble backward in shock
His mangled face stares up at them, eyes and mouth frozen open in a death grimace
Oh, Jesus
What the hell is going on
mean 33
-                                        33 Carmine and Howard continue repairing the road, Carmine still using the noisy jackhammer
Val and Earl drive up
You guys better get the hell outta here
We got a killer on the loose
What
Carmine stops jackhammering to listen
murderer , man
real psycho
He's cutting people's heads off
'm serious
'd high-tail for town if  was you
Val and Earl speed away
They're drunk
Yeah
But he edges over to the truck and takes out a heavy steel pry-bar to keep within easy reach
Carmine goes back to work, pounding the asphalt with the jackhammer
Suddenly the blade strikes something beneath the road, something soft
We hear a strange, unearthly shriek from underground
weird orange goo gushes up around the blade
Then the jackhammer takes off by itself like a harpoon stuck in a whale
Carmine gets tangled in the jack- hammer's air-hose and is dragged along, shouting for help
Howard chases him down the embankment and into the scrub- brush
He hears Carmine screaming
Carmine
What the hell is it
Where are you
But now there is only silence
Howard crashes through the brush
All he finds is the torn end of the air-hose -- which suddenly sucks down into the ground
He's momentarily staggered by an awful smell, but forces himself to keep looking
He lets the pry-bar drag on the ground
Then something -- it looks like a mouth or a horrid beak -- shoots out of the ground and grips the pry-bar with uncanny strength
Howard drops his weapon and scrambles madly away
He clambers back onto the road
But almost immediately cracks form in the pavement around him
More beak-things break through the asphalt between him and his truck
He dashes across the road, scrambling up the embankment
He clings precariously to a tree root, looking down -- where'd they go
Suddenly the dirt around him begins to "bubble
" Several hungry beaks break through and grab him, yanking him head first into the embankment
Then the embankment gives way, crashing down onto the road, taking with it a nearby telephone pole and snapping the lines
34
'  -                                  34 Pham Van is talking to , a local rancher
They both jump as the doors burst open
Val and Earl race in, trailed by Nestor and Melvin
Val heads for the payphone during: His head
You mean just his head
Val grabs the phone and digs in his pocket for change
Yeah, really sick, man
Sweet Old Fred
Earl comes up with change and hands it to Val, who dials
Something happen to Fred
(ignoring Pham) Are you serious, man
They killed him just to take his sheep He didn't have nothing else to steal
Neither did Edgar
What happened to Edgar
Val stares at the phone
don't believe this
The phone is out
Pham, your phone is out
didn't do it
What's going on
Val and Earl rush out
35
'  -                                  35 Trailed by the others Val and Earl march out and leap into their truck , Val driving now
He searches for the key
We've gotta get the police up here
You guys gotta step on it to Bixby
Earl hands Val the key
Consider it stepped on
36
-                                       36 Again the pick-up barrels through the canyon
Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know
(grimly) Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now
Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead
Earl points ahead and screams: Val brings the truck to a squealing stop
Ahead: the collapsed embankment completely blocks the road
It's totally impassable
The cowboys are dumbfounded
Is some higher force at work, here
Are we asking too much of life
But Val is in no mood for philosophy
He leaps out and peers into the highway maintenance truck which sits undisturbed, emergency lights still flashing
There's nobody in it
He starts looking around
Those assholes are supposed to be fixing the goddamn road
(shouts) Hey
Where are you guys
People gotta use this road, you know
You on a booze break or what
(whispers; urgently pointing) Val
Val
Val looks where he's pointing -- Howard's bloodstained hardhat lies at the edge of the landslide
Val gets the point
Looking around for the unknown assailant, he eases back into the truck
Earl already has a pistol in his lap and is digging through the glove compartment
(cont'd) Where are the bullets
Don't we have any goddamn bullets
Val quickly jockeys the truck to turn it around on the narrow road
But as he backs into the hillside, we hear a strange grating clunk from underneath
When he tries to pull forward, the truck won't move
The engine stalls
Jesus
don't believe this
You're hung up again
am not
They both lean out
The rear tires are clear
Val restarts the truck and tries to pull forward, rocking the truck against some unseen pull
Smoke wells up from the clutch
You're hung up  tell you
You're gonna burn the clutch
Val slams the truck into low-range four-wheel-drive and revs it
The tires dig in, fighting for traction -- and suddenly the truck lurches free
We hear an eerie shriek mingled with gear and engine noise as Val angrily roars away
(cont'd) Jesus, you can break an axle like that
Fuck you
Hey,  don't want spend the night out here
37
'  -                                  37 The word has spread
Everybody in town is gathered at Pham Van's
They rush out to meet Val and Earl as they drive up
What the hell you doing back already
You're never going to believe this, but the canyon road
we were on it not two hours ago
well, it's completely
But he stops because they're all staring wide-eyed at the rear of the truck
My God
Val and Earl jump out and look where everyone else is looking
Their jaws drop
: hanging from the rear axle of their truck and trailing out behind like a nightmare wedding decoration -- a sex foot long, grotesque, fleshy, tentacle
The end gripping the axle looks like a vicious, razor-sharp beak or hook
The trailing end is mutilated, oozing orange goo -- as though the creature was torn in half
Unreal
Where'd you get it
Uh
didn't know we had it
It's disgusting
Looks like
and eel
Naw
eels live in water
So
it's some kind of snake
Or a big mother slug maybe
Some kind of mutation
Burt, more daring than the others, pries the thing off the axle with a shovel
Don't touch, don't touch
It's dead all right
Tore the damn thing in half
It must've grabbed us
That's why the truck stalled-out
(suddenly indignant) Yeah
Next time  tell you 'm not hung up
Stalled out your truck
Have to be one strong son of a bitch
Pham Van leaps over them
give you boys five dollars for it
Val and Earl square their shoulders
This time they're ready for him
Twenty
Okay, ten dollars
Fifteen
Okay, fifteen
Damn right fifteen
Burt is deep in thought
Just one of these couldn't eat up off a whole flock of sheep
There's gotta be more out there, a lot more
cold chill spreads through the group
They stare out at the vast, forbidding desert
They suddenly feel alone -- very alone
38
-                                            38 on Rhonda's hat lying on the ground
We think the worst
Then she reaches in, picks it up and puts it on
she's in a lonely corner of the valley working with a seismograph
She pounds a marking stake into the dirt
39     -                                   39 The needle responds to each blow on the stake
We hear Rhonda stop pounding
The needle stops
All is silent -- but the needle starts moving again " 40                                                      40 is  in Rhonda's general direction
She starts to pound another stake
so it is moving straight toward her
As it passes a burrow, a rabbit suddenly scouts out
to watch the rabbit scamper into the distance, then   to move toward Rhonda, who still pounding her stake
passes Rhonda's seismograph
The machine tilts slightly as the ground bulges up beneath it
Rhonda finishes pounding
She heads for her truck, noisily tossing in her tools and slamming the tailgate on her, faster and faster
It is right on her heels as she climbs into the cab
41     - '                                        41 beak-thing thrusts out of the ground, groping where Rhonda's boot just was
Rhonda drives off, unknowingly running right over the thing
We hear a shriek of pain as the tentacle writhes and sucks back under the ground
42
'  -                                42 Mindy Sterngood poses cautiously with the bizarre hook tentacle
camera  and we  Pham Van taking her photo beside a sign: "Photographs -- You and the Snake Monster -- $2
00
"  Viola and Miguel, wait in line
We now see the store is crowded with concerned townsfolk debating what to do, and how to protect themselves
Val and Earl sit on the sidelines, sipping beer, gazing in awe at enterprising Phan Vam: Slick as snot and 'm not lying
Fifteen lousy bucks
man who plans ahead
Dominating the discussion are Burt and Heather now armed with scoped, magnum hunting rifles
Heather stands guard at a window, peering out into the night
(to group) Look, we organize, we arm ourselves
We go out, we find those damn snake things, we make 'em extinct
Come on, Burt, we don't even know what they are
Might be aliens
Who knows
Why go looking for trouble
Miguel, the trouble's come to us
If we're not ready
Phone's out
Road's out
We're on our own
(sarcastic) And you two just love it, don't you
Come on, Nancy, don't let's get personal
We need to do something
Burt steps over to a faded topographic map on the wall and points out details during: Damn right
You folks gotta analyze the situation
With that road out we're completely cut off
Got the cliffs to the north, mountains east and west
That's why Heather and me settled here in the first place, geographic isolation
Well
there must be dome way to get help
Yes, that's what  say
How, for chrissake
You gonna walk thirty-eight miles to Bixby
Hey, what about Pham Van's saddle horses
All heads turn toward Pham Van
You're welcome to them
Does anybody know how to ride
All heads turn toward Val and Earl
43
'  -  -              43 In the vast desert night a single floodlight illuminates Jim and Megan's partially finished house
Their station wagon is parked out front
country and western tune drifts to us from it's radio
As we  , we see the floodlight is powered by a small, softly purring generator set maybe fifty feet away
Jim and Megan, both exhausted, unload a big stack of roofing shingles from their station wagon
Jim starts to lift a package of shingles but gives up and sits on the tailgate
'm dead
Let's finish in the morning
We have to go into Bixby in the morning
(grins devilishly) The concrete blocks are in
The con
Oh my God
Just keep looking at that beautiful sky
What
That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done
(joking) Ah, but consider this, if we don't finish the roof, we can looks at that sky all the time
Just then the whirring of the generator becomes strangely muffled
The floodlight flickers
Now the generator dies
Darkness engulfs them
The car radio music drones on incongruously
(cont'd) Damn that thing
(sarcastic) We could always buy a new generator
Jim digs out a powerful flashlight and heads over toward the generator
Megan lies back, taking a welcome breather
After a moment: Well, what's wrong with it
(
) It's
gone
44     -                                                   44 Baffled, he sweeps the whole area with the flashlight
Megan joins him
You sure this is where it was
Am  sure
(points with flashlight) It was right there
There's the cord
The severed electric cable stops at the edge of a cone-shaped depression in the dirt where the generator sat
He hands her the flashlight and kneels
We watch tensely as he probes the loose earth with his hands
(cont'd) Maybe the ground caved in
There's a lot of old mines and stuff around here
Megan grabs his shirt, trying to pull him back
Well don't then
You don't want to fall in
Suddenly, about ten feet away --
The generator shoots up out of the ground
Jim and Megan dive for cover as it sails through the air, and crashes to earth
They stare, transfixed
The generator is dented and bent almost beyond recognition -- and covered with oozing slime
What the
But Megan is all action
She yanks him back
Come on
Get away from it
God, what a stink
We again hear that mysterious rumbling sound
Jim stops, sweeping the flashlight around them
(cont'd) Hear that
Never mind Let's go
Let's just go into town or something
Jim, please She hustles him bodily toward the car during: You know,  bet it's geological or something, like natural gas, or a geyser
They stink like that
Remember in Yellowstone
Suddenly he drops knee-deep into ground
Megan is thrown off balance and tumbles to one side
The flashlight falls, lighting them at an eerie low angle
(cont'd) Something's got me
We hear sickening  from below the earth
He in excruciating agony
(cont'd) Oh, God
Get me Out
He struggles wildly, but just sinks further down
Megan slides a 2X4 over to Jim
He grabs it like a drowning man, trying to keep himself from being pulled down
But he's pulled with suck power the 2X4 snaps
His head is going under
Megan desperately tries to dig the smothering earth away, but she's losing
Now only his arms are above ground
She pulls with all her might, but he sinks inexorably down, down
She's pulled flat on the ground
He's gone
The next instant, a vicious hook-tentacle erupts through the earth, missing Megan's face by inches
She scrambles back frantically
45     -                                          45 pursues Megan toward the car, just missing her as she dives in through the open tailgate
She slams it after her
The talons rake across the car, scratching the glass
Megan tumbles into the front seat
Thank God the keys are in the ignition
She starts the engine
But outside the "snake things" attack the car in a frenzy, slashing blindly
rear tire is totally shredded just as: Megan floors it
The car lurches forward but the mutilated tire falls apart
The wheel rim digs into the loose earth and the car is stuck
With no other recourse, Megan locks the door, rolls up the windows and cowers in the middle of the car, panting, sobbing
The radio is still playing a happy cowboy tune
She peeks out
They gave up
She's safe
Nothing happens for a moment, then -- The car starts to shake and shudder
Dust wells up around the windows
Outside we see a bizarre sight
The earth around the rear of the car is "boiling," dirt flying in all directions -- and the car starts to sink into the ground Megan wildly honks the horn
The car looks just like a ship going down by the stern, hood tilting up gracefully
The back windows shatter, dirt pouring in
Megan smashes the windshield with a small fire extinguisher and scrambles out on the hood
But there's no hope
The car keeps sinking, titling now almost ninety degrees, forcing her onto a precarious perch on the grille -- sinking, sinking
Out of her mind with terror, she keeps softly murmuring the same hopeless phrases: Stop it
Stop it
Somebody stop it
46
-   '  -   -      46 The headlights are two ironic beacons sending their beams skyward through the roiling dust into the night sky
The sound of the radio becomes muffled
The headlights sink from view -- and then Megan's scream floats across the desert
47
'  -                                 47 Out front of Pham Van's, nervous Val and Earl saddle up the horses while Pham loads their saddle bags with food
Every- one has gathered to see them off
There's an air of tension
(eyeing the horses) Pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners
They better be fast
Relax
snake thing like that couldn't move too quick
Screw you
For all you know they could fly Earl pulls their old Smith and Wesson revolver and battered Winchester rifle out of the pick-up truck
You want the rifle or the Smith
(definite) The rifle
So does Earl
He raises his hand
They swiftly do a round of scissors-rock-paper
Earl loses
He hands Val the rifle
Just then, Burt and Heather pull up in their Blazer, climbing out with their hunting rifles
You guys all set
Ready as we'll ever be
Heather and  are going to drive around a little, see if we can find that college girl and tell her to get her ass back into town
Good idea
And we'll swing by the doctor's place
They were going to go into Bixby but we don't know if they left before the road was out
Val and Earl mount up
Hold on
You guys oughta take something that packs more punch than that thirty-thirty
Take one of our Browning autos, or even my model seventy
(offers her hunting rifle) It's three-seventy-five  and mag
Earl takes the awesome-looking gun with a smug glance at Val
Gee
thanks, Heather
Hope we don't need it
Heather unhooks a box of cartridges from her belt and hands it to Earl
Suddenly there's a blood-curdling
The door to Pham Van's flies open
Out staggers Melvin, wrapped in Pham Van's hook-tentacle, writhing in apparent agony
'
's
People scatter like sheep
Burt and Heather have guns trained on him in an instant
Then everyone realizes it's a sick joke
Melvin collapses with laughter
Burt is livid
He almost shot Melvin
He charges over and yanks the kid to his feet, screaming: You stupid punk
You came that close, that close
One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass
Pham rushes over and grabs his precious tentacle
As people calm down, Val and Earl gaze nervously at the vast desert before them
Well
you fellas watch yourselves
Come back with the Sheriff
Sheriff, like hell
Come back with the National Guard
They ride out to an adlib chorus:  "Keep your heads down;" "Go careful, boys;" "Keep a sharp lookout;" etc
48
-                                            48 Val and Earl ride along, very tiny in the vast, lonely landscape, and very on edge
Constantly looking all around
You know, we can't possibly make Bixby by nightfall
Val doesn't want to hear it
That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark
(resentfully) Great
Thank you
Faint Country and Western radio music drifts to them
They're nearing Jim and Megan's house
49
'  -                             49 Val knocks on the door to the mobile home
Hey, doctor, anybody here
No answer
He opens the door and peers inside
Behind him Earl steps out of the half-finished house and shrugs
Nobody around
Wind rustles the plastic sheeting over the windows
Strangely they can still hear the muffled radio clearly
(spooked) Oh, man,  hate this shit
They walk briskly to their horses
Earl snatches Heather's rifle from its saddle scabbard
Val pulls out the Winchester
Earl tries to reassure himself
Car's gone
We just missed them, that's all
Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from
They focus on the sound and walk gingerly toward it, keeping constant watch in every direction
The ground here is all torn up like the sheep pen -- and the music is coming from underneath What the hell is going on
Val scrapes at the dirt with his boot -- and finds the headlight of Jim and Megan's station wagon, still on, glaring up at him
He drops down and wildly sweeps away more dirt, revealing more of the car's grille and hood -- and blood - soaked dirt which sticks to his hand
He leaps away, frantically rubbing the blood off on his pants
(cont'd) Oh, man
oh, man
50
-   -                           50 Val and Earl are riding at full gallop
They race alongside a concrete-lined flood-control ditch and veer off to follow a barbed wire fence which crosses the ditch
51
-    -                        51 They ride along the fence during: Here's the plan
We don't even stop
Ride like hell
Tonight we keep right on going
We'll walk the horses
That is the plan
mean, goddamn it
What the hell are those things
How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon
Why would they do it
Suddenly the horses stop short
In a frenzy they wheel around, rear up, refusing to go on
The cowboys fight to control them
knew it
Pham Van wouldn't know a decent horse if
But Earl's already drawing his rifle
Shut up
They got wind of something they don't like
Oh shit
He draws his rifle
They look wildly in all directions at once -- but there's nothing, only empty desert
(cont'd) But  don't see anything
They keep staring
The horses keep pacing nervously
Then -- Earl's horse rears wildly and falls
Earl goes flying
Val wheels around wildly, dismounts and runs to Earl, who's bruised and winded but basically unhurt
They think Earl's horse just tripped
(cont'd) Hey, you okay
You okay
Yeah
yeah
(turning to the horse) What about the hor
Their eyes bulge
Several "snake things" have engulfed the horse's head, sucking, crushing, slurping
Val's horse goes berserk and gallops for the horizon
(cont'd) What in the name
That's how they get you
They're under the goddamn ground Suddenly they realize what that means -- the thing could come up under them The cowboys scramble frantically away
But nothing pursues them
They pause, glancing back nervously
What the hell are they
Sons of bitches
Val raises his rifle and takes a well-aimed shot, hitting one of them
Orange goo spurts out
We hear a deafening shriek as all the "snake things" instantly zip back underground
Then --
The cowboys tumble down its side, Val losing his rifle
They roll over and stare dumbfounded at the mound
(cont'd) (gasps) There must be a million of them
The mound of earth turns toward them
The ground splits open and out rises -- a huge head
(awestruck) Nope
just one
The monster is a horrendous thirty-foot long eating machine
Its head is eyeless, utterly alien, covered with tough boney plates which close together to form a cork-screw point
The cowboys stumble back toward the fence in speechless terror
The creature slides toward them, pushing through the earth like a whale through water
Now it opens its mouth -- but it's like a grotesque flower, boney plates spreading open like petals, revealing a huge, slimy, fleshy, oozing orifice
And inside the mouth, a ghastly multi-tentacled tongue
These are the "snake things," not snakes at all but actually the horrid hook-tentacles that can shoot out six feet to snag their prey
The monster snorts and snuffs, throwing up plumes of dust, sounding like a horrendous pig
It sinks into the earth and charges
We see the hump of earth move toward them faster and faster but then it disappears as the creature goes deeper
Val and Earl leap sideways and run along the fence
The creature goes straight and slams into a fencepost from below
All we see is the fencepost knocked at a crazy angle
The cowboys keep running
The creature regroups and charges after them, hitting each fencepost in turn, sending weird sinuous shock waves along the barbed wire, making almost musical twanging sounds
Val looks back
It's gaining on us
And as if that weren't enough, Earl points to more trouble ahead
52
-                                   52 The fence runs straight to the edge of the ditch, an eight foot wide gap yawning dead ahead
The creature churns like a locomotive from behind
They'll have to try to jump
They strain desperately for every last fraction of speed
We can do it, we can do it
They leap and -- they don't do it
They smack into the opposite side of the ditch, clawing frantically at the lip, only to tumble to its sloping bottom
split second later the charging creature slams like a wrecking ball into the foot-thick concrete wall
The wall hook-tentacle flops out through one of the cracks
Terrified Val and Earl scramble away
But the wall holds together
And the, strangely, all is quiet
The tentacle lays dead still
Eventually, the cowering cowboys dare to creep back a little closer, still panting, exhausted, jumpy
Stupid son of a bitch
knocked itself cold
And now orange slime begins to ooze through the cracks in the concrete
Cold, my ass
It's dead
We killed the bastard
He suddenly shakes his fist at the dead beast
(cont'd) You
They allow themselves a small wheeze of nervous laughter, only to jump like rabbits as some pebbles rattle loudly down the concrete wall behind them
They whirl to see Rhonda, up on the opposite side of the ditch, staring down at them
She's lugging a bunch of her equipment, including a small folding shovel
Hi, guys, how're you doing
Look, can  ask you something
Did you just notice something weird
Vibrations
You know, some kind of earth tremor
Val and Earl look at each other, then burst out laughing
Rhonda spots the cracked wall
(cont'd) What's that
53
-                                   53 The shattered concrete has been pulled away to fully reveal the creature's horrendous head
Start  on it: oozing blood, slavering mouth plates hanging open, hook-tentacles lolling out
to see Earl and Rhonda, sweating, dusty and tired, staring in awe and cringing at the stench
Jesus Christ
think it smells like that 'cause it's dead
don't see any eyes
must be totally subterranean
and those tentacles
think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in
Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else
(shudders) Yeah, 'm lucky it didn't find me (overwhelmed) This is important, you know
This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century
The century
Forget it
History We can hear a shovel digging up above, and now Val shouts: (
) got it
Here's the other end
Just look at what we caught here
Earl and Rhonda climb up
with them to  the whole animal
Val, digging excitedly with Rhonda's shovel, is just scraping away the last loose dirt from the creature's tail
The whole length of the immense thirty foot beast is partially uncovered, in king-sized bas-relief
(hushed) This is one big mother
So this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime
She nods, stepping down to study the creature
The body is stream-lined, cigar-shaped, maybe eight feet in diameter at its thickest
It's covered with hundreds of short, rear- pointing, retractable spikes
Rhonda gingerly jiggles one
It can be pushed in and out of its socket like a plunger
(cont'd) It must push itself along with these
Hundreds of them pushing at once
That's how it can move so fast
mean this thing was tripping sensors all over the valley
No wonder  couldn't
chilling thought stops her in mid-sentence
She springs down into the drainage ditch to get her backpack, pulling out her seismograph printouts
She studies them frantically during: Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of any thing like this before
(elbows Earl) Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them
We just didn't tell you Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these
We're really in on something here
The guys looks at each other
One thought immediately springs to their minds
Pham Van don't get his mitts on this for no measly fifteen bucks
You got that right
While they bask in their fame-to-be, Rhonda continues to study the print-outs, coming to a terrifying conclusion
Here's the plan: we'll get a
a flatbed,  guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway
Naw, don't want to winch it
That'd tear it all up
Want to lift it
Some kind of crane with lifting straps
But Rhonda interrupts -- now really scared
Hey, hey, shut up
The way figure it
There are five more of these things
Val and Earl shut right up
Earl edges up a fencepost
Val sidles up onto a rock during: Five more
Rhonda paws through her unwieldy printouts, pointing out jagged ink lines on the graphs, comparing different ones
Yeah, darn it, look
've got seismographs all over the valley
If you compare the different readings, there have to be five
Here's one at two o'clock yesterday, but here's another one three miles away at the same time
So that's two
Now, here
The men leap from their perches and hustle her in the direction she came from
We'll take your word for it
Yeah
Where's your truck
The other side of that dome
She indicates what to most of us would be a hill, dotted with huge boulders thrusting out of the sandy desert soil like big mushrooms
The trio jogs toward the hill
54
-  -                              54 En route to the truck, they pass near one of Rhonda's seismographs
Suddenly Earl stumbles as one leg drops knee- deep into the ground
He screams
Val wheels and bodily yanks him up
They back away from the small hole in the ground, calming a little as they realize: Prairie dog burrow
Little sons of bitches
Rhonda tenses as she hears a sound she knows well -- the soft scratching of the seismograph needle across its paper cylinder
She whacks Val on the shoulder and points speechlessly at it
55     -                                          55 The needle is going wild
56                                                      56 She doesn't have to explain
All three of them dash dash for: 57
-                                     57 The remains of an old rail fence lay beside one of the boulders
Val, Earl, and Rhonda scramble over the wood, up onto the rock and stand there tensely
In a moment, the creature gently rustles the earth at the base of the rock
The monster's slimy hook-tentacles slither out, searching the rock base
Shuddering, the humans move as high as they can, well out of reach
The tentacles slip back beneath the earth
Everyone breathes a sigh of relief
Well, at least the bastard can't climb
Pardon my French
Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface
God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones
Okay, now, how far's your truck
Rhonda points
They can see the roof of her truck, maybe a hundred yards away through the boulders
Val and Earl think about it
don't know
If this one's any faster than that other one
(nods) think we wait right here
: 58
-                                  58 It's hours later
Stiff and uncomfortable, they have nothing to do but theorize
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, 'm sure
Okay, so they predate the fossil record
(not buying it herself) That'd make them a couple of billion years old
and we've just never seen one till now
Right
'd vote for outer space
No way those are local boys
(joking) Atomic testing
Or, no, bio- engineering
The government built them, a big surprise in the next war
There's a long pause
Earl stares at the dirt around the rock
Well
haven't seen a sign for hours
Maybe it's long gone
Maybe it is
Why don't you take a little stroll and see
Fuck you, too
Pardon my French
Well, we've got to do something Val gets an idea
He grabs a post from the dilapidated fence and cautiously slips down near the boulder's edge
Watch yourself
It's got a good six foot reach
Val nods
Dead silence as he reaches way out with the post and scrapes it on the ground
Almost instantly the creature roars up, grabbing the post in a flurry of flying dirt and lashing tentacles, nearly hooking Val's hand
Val practically falls over himself scrambling back to safety
Son of a bitch
Son of a god damned bitch
Been waiting there all this time
How the hell's it even know we're still here
It's been listening to us
It's got no eyes
It sure as hell can't smell anything underground, so figure
Rhonda stares at Val, impressed
Of course
It can sense the slightest seismic vibration
hear every move we make
Especially on this rock
It's a perfect conductor
They all settle back, having no idea what to do next
Rhonda gazes out at the desert that surrounds them like an ocean
(cont'd) always wanted to be stuck on a desert island
But somehow always imagined, you know, water
: 58A
-                                  58A Our heroes are silhouetted against a huge, spectacular, desert night sky
After a very long pause: You know,  hate to be crude, but 'm gonna have to take care of some business here
(emphatic) Me, too
(just as emphatic) Same here
The silhouettes shift, Val and Earl moving down one side of the rock, and Rhonda down the other
We can no longer see them
We just head zippers zipping down -- then soft sighs of relief from Val and Earl
Then: (
) (softly) Darn it
(
) You okay
(
) Yeah
But 'll tell you, if you ever wanted proof God is a man, this is it
: 59
-                                    59 Rich orange sunlight creeps silently across the deathly still desert
Earl is already awake
Val is curled up without his jacket, shivering
He wakes with a start
Where the hell's his jacket
Rhonda wakes slowly
She's surprised to find herself wrapped in Val's jacket
Touched by his chivalry, she embarrassedly hands it to baffled Val
Thanks
Val glances at Earl, who looks away
Who, me
(to Rhonda) No problem
Anytime
Earl gropes through his pockets, coming up with only cigarettes
Val fishes in his own pockets, finding only their lighter
They exchange items and light up during: Well, folks, what's the plan
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there
This time he tosses a piece of wood out onto the sand
With soft rustling, a bulge forms in the earth, moves over to the wood, then subsides
Rhonda starts looking around during: Don't he have a home to go to
(grim) Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower
might have an idea
(ignoring her) We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death
Well,  was wondering if we could
Well, let's just run for it
We outran that one yesterday, at least on a sprint
Rhonda gives up on them
She goes over and pulls a long cross rail from the fence during: Run for it
Running's not a plan
Running is what you do when the plan fails
You're not even trying to come up with a plan
Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options
(interrupting) You guys know how to pole vault
They watch in surprise as she hefts her pole, checks the balance, eyeballs the distance to the nearest boulder
Then she charges between them, plants her pole and vaults smoothly over to the next boulder, maybe fifteen feet away
The creature surfaces where her pole touched down, but too late -- a hook tentacle vainly sweeps the area, the disappears into the ground
Val and Earl glance at each other, impressed (cont'd) We just stay where it can't get us
on these residual boulders
My truck's parked right next to one
Earl rushes to grab a couple more fence rails
Stay on those residual boulders
Val just stands staring across at Rhonda -- his horizons are broadening
Earl stuffs a fence rail into his hands
(cont'd) (pointedly) Tammy Lynn Baxter, she do a lot of pole-vaulting
Earl takes a deep breath and goes for it, vaulting across to Rhonda
Val follows
60
-   -                         60 Through the shimmering heat in the distance we see the strange sight of the three figures vaulting from boulder to boulder
61
- '  -                    61 Val, Earl and Rhonda pole-vault their way toward the truck
Finally they're at the nearest boulder, but the truck is still ten feet away
Think it's still following us
Let's assume that it is
And once we hit that truck we gotta go fast
say we all jump together
Rhonda and Val nod
Rhonda grips her car keys in her teeth
(through clenched teeth) Ready
Yeah
One, two, three
They all vault in unison, landing in the truck bed
Rhonda scrambles up, slides open the cab's rear window, and begins wriggling through headfirst
(whispers) Come on, girl, it ain't gonna give us much time
Dust explodes around the rear of the truck
Hook-tentacles snake up on all sides, narrowly missing Val
He and Earl grab whatever's handy, pounding at the tentacles with expensive instruments
Rhonda's only half way through the cab window, still hanging headfirst into the cab
She frantically starts the truck, dives down and punches the accelerator with her fist
As the truck roars away, one tentacles manages to tear off the the muffler
The engine thunders like a tank
Val and Earl sit back, sighing in relief, then react when they see Rhonda is driving upside down and blind
62
'  -                                  62 Rhonda skids her noisy truck to a halt in front of Pham Van's
We better get everybody together
Val leaps out and jumps into his pick-up truck
He searches for the key
You go north, 'll go south
Right
Val holds out his hand for the key
Earl tosses it to him
Val drives off
We  Rhonda and Earl as they drive the other way, toward Viola's
'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here
Well, 'm scared, but 'm not sorry
You know, Val went to that college, too
For a whole year
Couldn't quite sit still for it, though
Had too much vinegar in his system
But once he settles down, forgets this cowboy stuff, he'll be one in a million
Rhonda sees straight through Earl's clumsy attempt at match- making
She can't help but smile
Earl grins sheepishly
(cont'd) All right, 'm about as subtle as a donkey's ass
Pardon my French
'm just saying the boy's got potential, that's all
on Rhonda -- her and Val
63
'  -                                   63 Nestor, Viola, Nancy, and Miguel nervously crowd around Val, Earl, and Rhonda
Viola holds her yappy dog which perio- dically snarls and snaps at people
Pham Van is on his radio trying to contact Burt and Heather
You serious, Val
You think we're not even safe here in town
Ask me that after you meet one think we should all get the hell out while the getting's good
Why not just take a Number Ten pick axe and give it one good whack
Nestor, damn it, these things are bigger than an Airstream trailer
God, 've got to find Mindy
Nancy rushes out
Hey, Pham, where's Burt and Heather
(hangs up ) Can't raise them
guess they're still out there somewhere
If you've got a radio, why aren't you calling somebody in Bixby
The police or
Can't reach outside the valley
You know, because of the mountains
Hey, Rhonda, what's the name you call those things, huh
Where'd they come from
Huh
don't know
You're a scientist, right
You should have a theory at least
Look, these things are absolutely unprecedented
Yeah, but where'd they come from
(exasperated) Where'd they come from
Okay, worms, probably in the Jurassic period
Cosmic radiation was much higher then
so they mutated
and they got so big they just sank right into the ground and fell asleep
But now continental drift has brought them to the surface, ready to be harvested by the ancient alien meat growers who planted them here
Everybody stares at her, then they smile, realizing she's pulling their legs
You're right, don't matter where they come from
Right
We need to be talking about what we're gonna do
My goodness, Valentine, once they see the road is out and the phone lines are down, someone will be along to look in on us
Don't you think
64
-                                       64 We see the utility truck still parked near the landslide blocking the road
, on the far side, a telephone maintenance truck is now parked, emergency lights flashing -- and nearby, amid phoneworkers' climbing and repair gear, two more hard hats lying on blood-soaked ground
65
'  -                                  65 The crowd is still jabbering away
Rhonda speak over them: No no no, they listen They can sense the slightest vibration through the ground
That's how they see
That's how they hunt So, like we don't vibrate, right
Maybe they won't even come to here, huh
Maybe they leave us alone
Val shakes his head, and marches over to the topographic map on the wall
They caught up with Edgar here
They grabbed Old Fred here
They nailed the asshole dog here
And the doctor's place is here
The spots he indicates describe a line leading along the valley straight toward town
(cont'd) This valley's just one long smorgasbord and if we don't haul ass outta here we're the next course
We hear an a eerie  from outside
Something shoots in through the window, striking Earl in the chest
Earl flails frantically at it -- but it's only Melvin's basketball
We glimpse Melvin outside, doubled over with laughter
Earl grabs the ball and hurls it viciously back, but Melvin easily dodges it
You little ass wipe
You knock that off or you're gonna be shitting that basketball
Pardon my French
(to Val) Now, Val, let's assume they're as dangerous as you say
Where are we going to go that's safer than right here
Rhonda's got an idea about that
Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials
(off their blank looks) the dirt
the loose soil that makes up the valley floor
But they can't move through solid rock
think we should travel west to the mountains
You know, up the jeep trail
The mountains are solid granite
We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them
all the way to Bixby if we have to
66
-                                      66 Nancy rushes back toward Pham Van's, still looking
Mindy
Mindy
67
'  -                                  67 We're  on Melvin as he circles around the back of Pham Van's, bouncing his basketball, mischief in his eyes
We can hear the townsfolk inside
(
) No, Valentine, 'm not leaving my place
(
) Well, it's gonna take us days to get back with help
(
) Doggone it, Viola, it's just plain crazy to stay
Then, to Melvin's astonishment, the steady rhythm of his bouncing basketball suddenly stops
The ball just goes flup and doesn't bounce back up to him
He looks down
No ball
Just swirling dust at his feet
68
'  -                                  68 Everyone jumps as we once more hear an ear-shattering from Melvin
Earl snarls and heads for the door, Val right behind them
'm gonna kick his ass
'm gonna help you
69
'  -                                  69 Val and Earl are well ahead of the other townsfolk as they march around to the side of Pham Van's
But where's Melvin
Nothing out here but the oppressive, hot desert silence
Then they hear a soft shuddering whimper -- from above
There's terrified Melvin, halfway up a telephone pole, clinging to it desperately
Val and Earl freeze in their tracks and glance at each other, realizing instantly what's up
Without a word they leap desperately in opposite directions
Like a breaching whale, a creature roars up through the earth right where they were standing, great mouth gaping open, slimy tentacles lashing in all directions
The townsfolk scatter, some heading for their homes, including Viola and Nestor
Others scramble over each other as they pile back into Pham Van's
The telephone pole shudders
Melvin falls and scampers for the nearest hiding place, a corrugated tin storage shed near Pham Van's
70
'  -                                  70 Val, Earl, Rhonda, Miguel, and Pham Van rush in
Jesus Christ
Man, you gut a gun
Big as a house
What are we gonna do
Quiet
Miguel and Pham shut up
Then we hear something new -- the building itself creaking and groaning like a ship
The liquor bottles behind Pham Van's bar vibrate and clink
The creature is moving beneath the building
The people freeze like mannequins
Now we can hear its pig-like snorting
Pham Van and Miguel react as the awful smell percolates up through the floorboards
Val signals them to keep quiet
Finally, the creaking stops
Rhonda addresses the group in an intense whisper: Remember
no noise
No vibration
Everyone stands stock still -- and sweats
But, then, slowly we become aware of a faint, yet oddly familiar sound
Squeak, squeak, squeak -- Mindy on her pogo stick
They all scramble to the windows
71
-                                       71 There she is, alone in the vacant street, Walkman blaring in her ears, merrily bouncing along to a rock 'n' roll beat
72     -  '                                      72 Thoughts of personal safety vanish as the horrified people lean way out the doors and windows and shout with one voice: (ad lib) Get off your pogo stick
Get in here, girl
Run, Mindy
73     -                                                 73 She can't hear them over her Walkman
tell-tale puff of dust spurts up not fifty feet from her
74     -  '                                      74 Val sees Mindy has only seconds left
He vaults straight out the window and charges toward her
Right behind him comes Earl and Rhonda
75     -                                                 75 As she rounds a corner at the opposite end of town
She spots Mindy, then sees Val running
She starts running
Mindy
Mindy
76     -                                                 76 She's lazily bouncing in circles -- squeak, squeak, squeak
She goes wide-eyed as she rotates to see Val coming at her like a mad bull, arms outstretched
The asphalt under her pogo stick cracks and -- Val tackles her, both of them tumbling head over heels
She scrambles up, rubbing her skinned elbow and yelling: Oww
Val, you hurt me
Val claps his hand over her mouth
She goes wide eyed as she sees: her pogo stick standing straight up in the cracked asphalt
Then it is sucked down like so much spaghetti
Nancy rushes into frame, hugging Mindy
Val signals her to be quiet
They sit uneasily
Where's the creature
Suddenly the pogo stick erupts out of the earth right in their midst
Val runs one way, Nancy and Mindy the other, heading up the street toward their house
Val scrambles up onto his pick-up truck
The creature rams the truck, rupturing a tire
As it shakes the truck violently, Val spots Rhonda and Earl, now standing uncertainly halfway between him and Pham Van's
Go back, for chrissake
Rhonda and Earl hesitate
We gotta get him off there
It'll suck that truck down
But Earl now hears something behind them
Down the street, a little wall of cinder blocks framing Viola's driveway suddenly topples over
Oh, Jesus
Rhonda, another one
77     -   -                            77 charges toward them
Earl swerves toward Pham Van's, but Rhonda is cut off
She heads toward the next nearest haven: 78
-                                      78 The storage shed where Melvin is hiding
It sits in a vacant, weed-choked lot
Crashing through the weeds, Rhonda has almost reached the shed when she is suddenly brought up short and slams face down in a cloud of dust
She can't get up
Something's got her
She's caught in an old rusted barbed wire fence, lying almost flat, hidden in the weeds
Some strands have come loose and are curled up like vicious concertina wire
Barely has she taken this in when -- the ground caves in under her
She rolls wildly to one side as hook-tentacles snake up, missing her by inches
She keeps rolling-crawling- scrambling -- anything to get away from the awful maw -- but gets her legs hopelessly tangled in the barbed wire
She freezes
The creature feels around where she was
She calms herself, pulling gingerly at the wire, working tensely to free herself but -- The creature's mouth slams shut on the fence
Like a spider sensing something caught in its web, the monster knows it's on to something
Its hook-tentacles shoot forward to snare three feet of fence, then the creature lunges up and out, swallowing that three feet in a big "gulp" and yanking Rhonda violently toward it
She screams, pants ripped, legs slashed and bleeding
She's dragged even closer
79
-  - -                         79 The truck shakes and shimmies as Val's creature tries to pull it down
Val sees that Rhonda's in trouble
He searches frantically for a weapon -- and finds one -- a
He leaps as far from the truck as he can and hits the ground running, yanking furiously on the saw's starter cord
80
-                                      80 Rhonda is in a dead panic, thrashing helplessly in the barbed wire
The beast takes another gulp of fence, wrenching her within inches of a probing hook-tentacle
Suddenly we hear a nasty  as Val's chain saw swings in, slicing the squirm- ing tentacle in half, spraying gore everywhere
The creature unleashes an unearthly shriek, and the other tentacles recoil
The severed one writhes like a beheaded snake
Val yanks off Rhonda's boots
Come on
Outta your pants
She frantically claws at her belt
But in mere seconds: (pointing) Tentacles snake out to regain their grip on the fence
Val grabs the saw and starts slashing wildly, but this time the hook-tentacles snag it and wrench it from his grasp
It slams to the ground, motor dying
The monster readies itself for the lunge that will suck Rhonda in
Val grabs her under the arms and pulls
Rhonda wriggles wildly to get out of her wire enmeshed pants
The creature lunges
Rhonda pulls free
She and Val tumble backward
The creature gets only a mouthful of Rhonda's jeans
The next instant the second creature explodes up through the ground right next to fallen Val and Rhonda
They roll sideways, come up running, and sprint for Pham Van's along an old wooden sidewalk
81
'  -                                  81 Earl flings open the front door
Val and Rhonda race toward the porch
Right on their heels the creature ripples the boards like an ocean wave
Come on
Come on
Don't look back
Just run
Run like screaming fuck
They dive through the open door of Pham Van's
The rippling boards zoom on past it
Earl quickly eases the door shut
82
'  -                                  82 Earl turns to breathless Rhonda
(whispers) Pardon my French
: 83
'  -                                83 It's a tense, edgy group
Every movement made is in slow motion, every word is a whisper
They gaze grimly out the windows at the silent, deserted, heat-shimmering main street
Val gingerly dabs iodine onto the cuts on Rhonda's legs
She doesn't even wince
You paying attention
This oughta hurt like hell
It does
She smiles at him
(cont'd) So, is that one of your usual jobs, saving peoples' lives
(embarrassed) First time for me
She gazes at him
He looks away
Over at the bar, Pham holds up a new pair of pants for Rhonda
Oh, thank you
Grateful for something to do, Val eases over to get the pants
Rhonda looks after him
Then she becomes aware of someone staring at her It's Earl, giving her a big Cheshire cat grin that says "What did  tell you
" Pham hands the pants to Val
Then Pham and Miguel reach simultaneously for a sods bottle and -- knock it over
It rolls all the way down the bar as a flurry of desperate hands try to stop it
No good
It rolls off the end and --
Everyone freezes
Sure enough the building shudders
Floor boards creak and bend as searching tentacles thump and scrape along under the floor
People close their eyes, not even breathing
Finally the noise subsides
Everyone relaxes -- a little
So what are we gonna do, you know
How long till they go away
(shakes his head) They got the patience of Job
They just sit and goddamn wait til they hear something that sounds like lunch
We need a plan
've got a plan
You and Val take your truck, get to the mountains
Hike to Bixby
Get us some help
Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham
Well, we can take my truck then
No good
You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail
They all shut up when they hear Viola's dog yapping in the distance
84
'  -                                   84 Up the hill across from Pham Van's, the old trailer looks perfectly peaceful
Except Viola's dog keeps yapping
Then we hear panicked Viola
(
) Quiet
Quiet you hateful thing
85
'  -                                  85 Shut it up
Shut the little bastard up
Chuck him out the door
Like a little hors d'oeuvre
'  - We hear a loud whap
The dog's bark simply changes to piercing yelps
It would be funny except -- The trailer suddenly bucks upward, hit from below as though by a pile driver
Again and again the unseen creatures slam into the frail structure
(
) Get away
Get away
Oh God in heaven, help me
The trailer is finally knocked right off its foundation
It tips over and tumbles all the way down the hill
As the dust clears, all is silent
huge hole is torn in the trailer's floor
Viola's possessions are scattered everywhere
86
'  -                                  86 Everyone stares in shock
Oh my God
Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum
Gotta do something
Gotta get the bastards
(hopeless) Man, what the hell can we do to those things
Well, we're sure as hell not going to sit here being quiet for God knows how long
Are we
Now wait a minute, Earl
got enough food here to last us for weeks
Those damn things can't wait around forever
(pause) We can do it
mean, if we have to, right
Everyone turns away from the windows, gingerly sitting down, glumly pondering this possibility
There is a long silence
Then suddenly --
The silence is shattered as Pham Van's big freezer compressor suddenly comes on
Jesus
Shut it off
Pham runs to the freezer
Its on/off switch is buried behind stacks of soft-drink cases
He tears at them like a madman, toppling them this way and that
Earl and Val join him
But right behind Pham, the floor  , a monster's snout   and engulfing one of his legs
The creature starts to back down into the jagged hole, dragging screaming Pham with it
Val, Earl, Rhonda, and Miguel grab Pham's arms but are no match for the monster
It shakes and spins him like some gigantic dog, effortlessly throwing them off, relentlessly pulling Pham down
The hole in the floor is too small for Pham to fit through As one leg goes down, the other is bent hideously backward
Pham screams and screams as jagged wood tears into him, bones snap, ribs crack
The others grab him again but are utterly helpless
With vicious, powerful jerks the creature yanks his man mangled body down
The last thing we see is his foot, now folded back past his head, and he's gone
Val is wild with helpless anger
Son of a bitch
Son of a bitch
The floor bulges up in another place
second creature
Then a third, coming
Earl sprawls onto the bar
Rhonda springs onto the shelves in the middle of the store, knocking groceries everywhere
Val and Miguel climb up shelves which cover the rear wall of the store
The whole building shakes and shudders, dust powdering down from the ceiling
Flailing tentacles are everywhere, slashing open food packages; clouds of flour fill the air
Val spots a hatch in the ceiling
Everybody
This way
The roof
Earl leaps from the bar to the rear shelves
Val and Miguel slide sideways till they're beneath the hatch, then use the shelves as a ladder, climbing up to the hatch
Val pounds on it frantically
In the middle of the store, Rhonda leaps from shelf to shelf, trying to get closer to where Val is
Soon she reaches the last one, balancing precariously
But a creature tips over the first one
The shelves topple like dominoes, crashing toward Rhonda
She is half catapulted, half jumps right through an open window, ripping through the screen
Val sees what's happened
With maniacal strength he smashes open the hatch and climbs out onto -- 87
'  -  -                           87 Val rushes to the edge of the roof shouting: Rhonda
Keep moving
Don't stop
He looks down where Rhonda fell
She's not there
He hears a whistle and is relieved to see: 88
-                                       88 Rhonda is perched as high as she can get on the water tower near Pham Van's
It's maybe twenty-five feet tall, a simple wood frame holding a big galvanized tank
The wooden legs stand on big concrete anchors buried in the ground
89
-                                      89 Melvin peers terrified out the shed door, up at the guys on Pham Van's roof
Hey
What's going on, man
What the hell you doing up there
Melvin, shut the hell up
It's too late
Wham
creature strikes
The little shed shudders, dust puffing from every old seam
In a split second Melvin has climbed to the shed roof
90
'  -                                     90 Nancy and Mindy peer to the window, surprised to see the men on Pham Van's roof
91
-  -                                 91 We hear Val's shouting to the remaining townsfolk
Nancy
Nestor
92
'  -  -                           92 Get up on your roof
On your roof
They can come through the floor
The store shakes and shimmies
We hear the monster's thunderous crashing from below
Can't you shout a little quieter
93
& '  -                            93 Burt and Heather's place, about a mile from town, is no- nonsense, functional, ugly -- unpainted concrete walls, no yard, chain-link fence
Burt and Heather drive up in their big Blazer and park right beside the house
Hot and tired, they climb out, each carrying a heavy, scoped hunting rifle
Burt peers toward Perfection through binoculars during: can't believe it
No tracks, no sign, no spoor
Yeah, whatever they are, you'd think after they ate all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace
(reacts to what he sees) What the hell's going on in town
94
-  - '
-            94 The town is a very strange sight
It's as though an invisible flood were in progress, driving people to high ground
We see: Rhonda perched on the water tower; Val, Earl and Miguel on the store roof; Nancy and Mindy on their roof; Melvin on the storage shed; Nestor on his roof
95
'  -  -                           95 Val, Earl and Miguel gaze out at the town, trying to concoct a plan
Suddenly Earl perks up
The men speak softly
Hey, here's the plan: Nestor's Cadillac
His tires are nine hundred sixteens
We sprint for it, grab the spare, put it on our truck with our spare
Val stares at him, incredulous
How the hell long it take you to change a tire
(sighs) Just about too damn long
Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway
We need another plan
Suddenly, down in the store, Pham Van's  radio squawks loudly
(
) Yo,
, Burt here
Come back
The building shudders as the creatures again smash through the floor inside, looking for the source of the noise
Val, Earl and Miguel scramble to the edge of the roof
96
'  -                                  96 The  radio sits on a shelf near an open window
Tentacles are feeling along the wall just below it
Val appears out- side the window -- upside-down
He snatches the radio and is hauled straight up out of frame
(
) Pham
Anybody copy
97
'  -  -                           97 Miguel and Earl haul Val by the feet back up onto the roof
Val quickly turns down the  volume
(whispers into mic) Burt, now listen
We found out what's been killing people
Over
98
& '  -  -                 98 peculiar cross between bomb shelter and blue-collar den, Burt's wood-paneled basement has all the comforts for post- Apocalypse living
Burt talks on his
Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency
'm on forty-nine
(
) (a little louder) Burt, can you hear me now
Just barely, Pham
What are you all doing up on your roofs
What the hell's going on
Come back
few feet away Heather works at their ammunition reloading bench
She dumps a few hundred empty cartridge cases into a case cleaner and switches it on
It  loudly as it vibrates
99
'  -                                  99 The groping tentacles swiftly suck back below the floor
to see out the window some distance away, a couple of old trash cans topple over as the creature streaks past beneath them, making a bee-line for Burt's
100
'  -  -                           100 Miguel points frantically at the trash cans
Oh man, they're going, man think they're going for Burt
Val talks a little louder into the mic
as needed
Burt
This is Val
Get out of your basement
Take your radio
You and Heather get up on your roof
Then we'll talk, okay
(
) Val
What the hell you doing back already
(shouts) Burt, get out
Get up on your roof or someplace
We found out what's been killing people
They're under the ground
(
) What's under the ground
We're not getting up on the roof
Earth shelter's the best
Known that since  was a kid
Listen
Listen
We know what they are
They're big things under the ground
Much bigger than we thought
They're coming after you
They're coming right now
101
& '  -  -                 101 Hearing that warning, Burt and Heather go into a well-honed drill
They grab their hunting rifles and take positions at basement windows
Burt scans with the binoculars
He sees nothing
He glances at Heather
She shrugs
Nobody coming
(into ) We don't see anything, Val
Now what the hell are you talking about
Over
Val is frantic
How do you explain these things
(
) They're coming under ground
They they can dig like a son of a bitch
Big monsters under the ground, Burt
Now get the hell out
Hurry
Burt and Heather exchange looks
Has Val gone nuts
Then they hear a low , growing louder and louder
Tools hanging over the work bench start to shake; the decorative cow skulls on the wall rattle; the overhead lights sway -- and then -- everything stops
Dead silence, except for the humming of the case cleaner
The wood paneling bulges slightly
Nails pop out
The wall is pushed again; the paneling cracks
cow skull falls
Burt and Heather level their rifles and -- huge creature pushes right through the wall
Fully half its bulbous, spiked body writhes into the center of the room, great multi-part jaws drooling open, hook-tentacles lashing out
102
'  -  -                           102 The three men can hear the chaos over the
(
) Jesus Chri
The  goes dead
The men stare numbly
Then, drifting across the desert, a soft popping sound
The men perk up; they know what it is -- distant gunfire
103
& '  -  -                 103 The gunfire is  as Burt and Heather blast away
Globby blood spurts from a dozen wounds, and the creature pulls back a little
The couple keeps firing until magazines are empty
The creature lunges forward again
with Burt and Heather to  a wall of the basement we haven't seen until now -- a wall covered with guns -- hand guns, long guns, riot guns, flare guns, antique guns, military guns, elephant guns
Heather grabs an -91 assault rifle, slams in two magazines, bottoms taped end to end, and opens fire
hook-tentacle snags her boot, yanking her right off her feet
Burt pumps out eight devastating blasts from a twelve-gauge riot gun, severing the tentacle
Heather is on her feet in an instant
She expertly flops her double magazine over, loading the full one taped upside-down to it, and opens fire again
Burt grabs an -15 semi-auto and joins her
They lay down massive fire, virtually disappearing in muzzle flash and smoke
Ejected shell cases clatter and clang all around the room
The guns are empty
They back down the wall, desperately grabbing weapons one after another: a lever-action, a magnum handgun, even a flare gun which Heather fires right into the creature's mouth
Shrieking in pain, the horrid thing thing Burt and Heather scramble up over a desk to keep something between them and it
Burt smashes open a fancy glass case holding a huge four-gauge elephant gun
He slams in two gigantic cartridges nearly an inch in diameter
He fires
The concussion literally shakes the building
The recoil slams Burt back against the wall
The monster bullets tear monster holes in the monster
Great gouts of curdles blood spew from it -- Burt hit an artery or something
The beast convulses grotesquely, then collapses, deflating like a beached whale
Burt and Heather stagger together and hug each other fervently
They stare dumbfounded at the massive dead horror
Burt suddenly shouts vehemently: Broke into the wrong goddamn rec room, didn't you, you
104
'  -  -                           104 Val, Earl and Miguel listen to the silence hoping for some sign that their friends are alive
Suddenly: (
filter) We killed it You got that
We killed that motherfucker
Come back
It takes a moment for this to sink in, then the men  -- as quietly as possible
Uh
roger that, Burt
Uh, congratulations
Uh, be advised, however, there are four more, repeat, four more motherfuckers
Come back
105
& '  -  -                     105 Burt and Heather dash out onto the roof, laden with weapons, ammo boxes and their  radio
They hit the deck, assorted rifles and the elephant gun the ready
106
'  -  -                           106 Val shouts to everyone: They got one
They killed one of the sons of bitches
107
-  -                               107 Melvin pumps his fist in the air
Way to go, dudes
108
-  -                         108 Nancy and Mindy hug each other
109
'  -  -                             109 Perched on his Spanish tile roof, Nestor pours coffee from his thermos and raises his cup in a toast
110
-                                       110 Rhonda lets out a
111
'  -  -                           111 The men sit, temporarily jubilant
Well,  guess we don't get to make fun of Burt's lifestyle anymore, huh
Val grabs the  mic
Burt, any chance you can get the rest of them
112
& '  -  -                     112 Burt and Heather peer from their fortress-like roof
Burt spots earth bulging up near the foundation of his house
(into ) One second, Val
He grabs the elephant gun and takes two well-aimed shots -- two deafening  which echo off the distant mountains
But the bullets bury themselves harmlessly in the dirt
The bulge in the dirt moves calmly away and sinks from view
Heather shakes her head
You're not getting any penetration, even with the elephant gun
Damn
(into ) Val, we can't get them
Never figured on having to shoot through dirt
Best goddamn bullet stop there is
Come back
113
'  -  -                           113 The men are disappointed
That's not what they wanted to hear from Burt
Then Earl perks up and grab the  mic
(into ) Okay, Burt, listen
Forget shooting them
Tell me this: can you get to your truck
(
) No problem
Good
You've got the only truck in the valley that can make it up that damn jeep trail
So, here's the plan: You and Heather go for help
Get to the mountains
But Rhonda interrupts, pointing urgently from the water tower
Hey, guys
They're up to something
Val, Earl and Miguel rush to the edge of the roof and look down where she's pointing -- creature is running its tentacles along the building's foundation
It's a strange, more studied movement than we've seen before
(to Rhonda) What's it doing
Why do you all keep asking me
They all stare nervously down as the tentacles feel their way along the wall, moving toward a corner of the building
Suddenly Miguel spots something down the next wall
Hey, there's another one coming
Another set of tentacles is feeling along the adjacent wall
The two creatures meet at the corner, their tentacles touch- ing rather like ants' antennae
They they submerge; tenta- cles zipping into the earth
Nothing happens for a moment
Then the corner of the building suddenly heaves up a couple of feet
Clapboard siding splits
warped window shatters
(We don't see the creatures, only the effect of their shoving from below)
The men nearly lose their balance
Then the corner sinks back down
What the hell was that all about
114
'  -                                     114 Nancy and Mindy are still huddled on the roof
They don't make a sound
They're startled when the house suddenly groans and tilts as creatures give it a tentative shove
Nancy and Mindy frantically cling to the peak of the smooth roof
The picture windows shatters
We hear beams  and , dishes  off shelves
The front screen door swings open
At last the house slowly settles back down
115
'  -  -                           115 The men are watching Nancy's house tensely
They weren't making no noise
Why they bothering them for
(mind racing) They're studying the buildings
trying to figure them out
Rhonda chimes in from the water tower
Yeah, they're confused
They can feel our vibrations, but they can't find us
They're working together, too
Yeah, like they got a plan
(
) Breaker there, Earl
What do you want us to do
(into ) Hang on, Burt
The bastards are up to something
116
'  -  -                             116 Straddling the peak of his steeply sloping roof
Nestor grabs on in panic as the creatures lift the place up slowly
The roof warps, Spanish tiles shatter and rain down on the ground
This causes a flurry of activity
Tentacles snake around where the tiles fell
We hear creatures crash through inside, snorting and huffing
They attack the house in earnest, shaking it violently, pushing the front wall out till it falls flat
The roof collapses on that side
Nestor can't hang on
He slides all the way down, landing across a window on the flattened wall
The next instant he's grabbed and pulled through the window, right into the ground
He along the ground, heading toward the storage shed where Melvin is
All we can see is dirt, but we can still hear Nestor screaming
His screams get more and more faint as   on: 117
-                                      117 horrified Melvin as he rocks back and forth autistically
Oh, wow, man
No way
No fucking way, man
118
'  -  -                              118 Nancy comforts Mindy
119
-                                       119 Rhonda turns away
120
'  -  -                           120 Val, Earl and Miguel stare in horror and disbelief
Miguel crosses himself
They're in worse trouble than they thought
They knocked his place down on purpose, man
They're gonna tear this whole town out from under us
121
& '  -                            121 Burt and Heather's truck is parked in foreground
The couple is up on the roof in background
Burt prowls along the edge of the roof with the elephant gun
Heather mans the
(
) Burt
Heather
Yeah, Val
(
) We're in deep shit over here
Let's change that plan
hump of dirt raises near the base of the house
Burt jerks the rifle to his shoulder and squeezes off a shot
The hump moves away from the house
Knock it off, Burt
think  scared it
(
) Forget going for help
We'll all be dead long before you get back
Still moving away, the hump of dirt passes under the side- walk, rippling the flagstones gently
(into ) We're here, Val
Just tell us what you need
Come back
(
) They're tearing down the houses here
We all gotta get outta here together
Now
The hump of dirt passes under Burt and Heather's truck, rocking the vehicle slightly
We're with you, Val
We'll come get everybody
Just hang on tight
The truck's security alarm starts
Burt and Heather stare down helplessly as the noisy truck is furiously attacked by the frenzied creatures
Dust flies as metal rips and tires shred
122
'  -  -                           122 Val Earl and Miguel listen in disbelief to the distant truck alarm
It finally sputters and dies
(
) Val, we're going to have to forget about the truck
(into ) Yeah, Heather, we got you
They've hit rock-bottom
They sit in helpless, desperate silence
Over on the storage shed roof, Melvin is losing it: Hey, you better think of something man
You gotta do something
Who
You and Val, man
Miguel nods in agreement
Val and Earl stare at him, incredulous
What
Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us
(flatly) You guys do all the odd jobs
Val just stares at her
Then --
The store shudders, creaks, and groans
The creatures are back
One corner of the store lifts up, beams splintering
Then another corner lifts up
The roof tilts like the deck of a storm-tossed ship
From now on the monsters shake and ram the building almost constantly
Hanging on tight, the men peer over the edge
We don't have a hell of a lot of time here
Meanwhile, Rhonda tries her desperate best to be logical: Look, the situation hasn't changed
We still have to get to solid rock
There must be some way
(shouts, angry) Like what There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains
Hey, Val, quiet, man
We need a helicopter is what we need, or a goddamn tank
Wait a minute
the Cat
Could we take the Cat
(dubious) Jesus
It's slower than hell
Yeah, but it weighs better than thirty tons
No way they could stop it
We can't all fit on that bulldozer
But Val is warming to the idea
But
we could pull something
We could,  don't know, drag a car behind it
car, huh
Like a big armored car
Need something bigger, tougher
our truck maybe
or, hell, that old semi trailer
Its tires are flat
Doesn't matter
The cat can pull any thing
Well
all right We just roll on out of here
We got a plan
They squint at the bulldozer -- ' way in the distance
(cont'd) 'Course, that's one helluva long walk
They stare grimly, momentarily stuck for an idea
Then: Listen, they only respond to vibration, right
Couldn't we
distract them somehow
Yeah, good
Something to keep them busy
We need a decoy
Hey, Melvin, you wanna make a buck
Fuck you
Miguel grabs Earl and points down at little garden tractor in a jumble of Pham Van's equipment and tools near the side of the store
Hey, how about the tractor
Start him up
Let him go by itself
Let those things chase it all over is they like that noise
(nodding) Not bad
(to Val) What do you think
The store takes a heavy hit
The front porch collapses with a terrific crash
think the ground's getting closer
think we do it
We're gonna save our asses here
Wait
How are you going to know they're all following it
Good point
We got two right here
Val scrambles to the highest point of the sagging roof and shouts to Nancy
(cont'd) Nancy, we gotta find all four of them
How many you got over there
123
'  -  -                              123 The house shuddering and shaking
There's one
think one
124
'  -  -                           124 Earl grabs the  mic
(into ) Burt, Heather, we got a little sort of a plan going here, maybe
Can you tell if you've still got any of those things out at your place
Come back
125
& '  -  -                     125 (into ) Yeah, still got one poking around
(
) That's four
Let us know if it starts moving, Burt
Roger that
126
'  -  -                        126 Val and Earl have lowered Miguel down to a window sill right above the garden tractor
He has used his kerchief to tie the steering wheel to keep the front wheels straight
He jams the throttle open and signals thumbs-up to Val and Earl above
127
'  -  -                           127 Val and Earl stride purposefully toward the opposite end of the roof
Realizing they have the same idea, each one tries to edge ahead of the other
'm making the run to the Cat
Like hell you are
Get real
'm faster than you
'm best at driving the Cat
Only if something happens to me
(cont'd) Look, you'd better listen
'm older and wiser
Yeah, well, you're half right
Earl raises a fist: The Challenge
They do scissors-rock- paper
One, two, three
Val loses
(cont'd) Damn
Guess  have to do it
(shakes his head) won
pick who does it
Val glares at him
Earl's obviously determined
(cont'd) Ready when you are, Miguel
Earl positions himself, nervous as hell, ready to leap at the right moment
128
'  -  -                        128 Miguel leans out precariously and pulls the tractor's starter cord
Nothing
On the second try it starts
He slams it into gear and sends it out toward open desert
The store shakes under Miguel, almost knocking him off the window sill, as two humps of dirt pursue the noisy tractor
There they go
They're chasing it
129
'  -                                     129 "spout" of dust erupts near the foundation as the creature beneath zooms away toward the new sound
Nancy whispers: It's going
(then shouts) There goes this one
It's going
130
'  -  -                           130 The  radio squawks: (
) Hey, this guy just took off like a shot
What'd you people do
Earl is poised to leap
Val steps up and slaps him on the back
Watch your ass, shithead
Don't worry about me, jerkoff
Val instantly elbows Earl hard in the stomach
As Earl doubles over, Val springs off the edge of the roof
(cont'd) You goddamn suicidal son of a bitch
We see Val running for all he's worth -- and there's the bulldozer at the edge of town a long way away
131
-                                            131 pursues the garden tractor as it bounces along
132
-                                        132 Val charges across the vast open area that separates him from the bulldozer
We can hear the tractor droning along in the background
133
-                                            133 The tractor suddenly takes a bad bounce and flips over
The engine dies
Total silence
134
'  -  -                           134 Earl, Rhonda and Miguel have seen the tractor take a header
Oh my God
135
-  -                                135 Val's crunching boots seem incredibly loud in the sudden silence
He hesitates, glancing over his shoulder
He's totally out in the open, halfway to the bulldozer
Should he run back or go forward
He decides to go for the bulldozer
136
-                                            136 All four creatures are now heading for Val
four slightly different    speeding over the ground, racing after him
He strains to the limit, breaths coming in painful rasps -- but the creatures are closing in on him with chilling ease
137
'  -  -                           137 Everyone watches in horror
He'll never make it
They're gonna get him
(yells) ,
'
' 138
-  -                                138 Val hears her and stops dead
So do the creatures
Maybe twenty feet away, their giant snouts poke up out of the ground: one, two, three, four
Val stands trembling
The creatures softly shuffle back and forth, searching blindly for him, hook-tentacles feeling everywhere
One tentacle sweeps toward Val's boot
He manages to lift his foot just in time, letting the tentacle pass beneath it
He balances precariously like a flamingo
139
'  -  -                           139 It worked
They can't find him
(pause) Okay, okay
uh
we gotta make some noise
a lot of noise
, , He starts jumping noisily up and down
Miguel joins in, cursing the monsters in Spanish
139A
-                                      139A Rhonda kicks and shouts
But it's obvious they need some- thing louder
She spots the aging outlet pipe coming from the water tank
Bracing herself, she kicks at it with both feet
It finally gives way at a rusted joint
torrent of water blasts out, thundering into the dirt
140
-  -                                140 All the creatures wheel about in the dirt and zoom off toward town
Val breathes a big sigh of relief and sprints to the bulldozer
141
'  -  -                           141 That did it, girl
Goddamn good thinking
142
-                                       142 mass of tentacles and snouts swirl through the big puddle where the water if falling
The creatures' breathing throws up spouts of muddy water
Rhonda looks down nervously
Earl calls reassuringly from Pham Van's: Don't worry
No way they can lift that tower
mean it's really heavy
143    -                                      143 The dirt begins to cave in around the tower's footing
The creatures are digging the dirt away
144                                                     144 The water tower tilts ever so slightly, creaking and groaning
Rhonda frantically grabs a handhold
They're not trying to lift it
145
-                                         145 Val lands in the driver's seat and turns the engine over -- it doesn't start
The old machine starts
Val slams it into reverse and backs up toward the semi trailer
146
-                                       146 The water tower is starting to tilt seriously
Water spills over the top edge of the tank, drenching Rhonda
147
-                                         147 Val has used heavy chains on the back of the bulldozer to jerry-rig a hitch to the semi trailer
Now he scrambles back into the driver's seat
He guns the engine, wrenching the old semi trailer from years of dried mud and tumbleweeds
Ancient tires disintegrate
Rusted wheels screech and complain -- but it moves
Val lets out a whoop and heads full-tilt for town
He's suddenly shocked as he sees: 148
-                                       148 Rhonda's in big trouble
She scrambles to the high side of the tower platform
The tower's going to tip over at any moment
It's roof slides off and crashes into the street
On Pham Van's, Miguel and Earl are tearing apart the swamp cooler, throwing pieces of it off the roof, trying to distract the creatures, but they can't compete with the noise from the water
In  the bulldozer rumbles toward the tower at top speed -- an excruciatingly slow eight miles per hour
The tremendously heavy water tank suddenly tears loose, sliding off its platform, nearly carrying Rhonda with it
She ends up hanging from a cross beam as the water tank splatters like an enormous egg below, sending a small tidal wave down the street
The remains of the tower tilt crazily nearly forty-five degrees
The bulldozer grinds closer and closer
Rhonda tries to climb up, but the jostling and shuddering of the tower keeps her dangling precariously
Suddenly she falls
And lands in the dirt
The creatures zero in on her
She turns wildly and leaps for the blade of the approaching bulldozer
The blade is only inches off the ground but Val swiftly raises it, lifting Rhonda high into the air just above the grasping tentacles
149
-   -                          149 As Rhonda climbs down into the cab, Val heads the bulldozer over to Pham Van's and stops
Almost as soon as he does, creatures attack, a frenzy of tentacles grabbing at all sides of the massive earth-moving machine, slithering into the treads
Val and Rhonda watch this nervously as Earl and Miguel quickly clamber from the roof down into the protective steel belly of the semi trailer
Val mentally crosses his fingers and sends the bulldozer roaring forward
It effortlessly tears loose from the tentacles, grinding one to pulp in its treads
The creature shrieks in pain
The humans cheer
At last they've got the upper hand
150
-                                      150 Melvin dances merrily, and noisily , on the metal rooftop
Way to go
Dumb fucking worms
Now haul ass over here, man
Me next
Get me off of here
The flimsy shed seems almost to explode as a furious creature roars up inside
The walls buckle out
The whole structure sags
Melvin scrambles to peak of the roof
Oh shit
Oh, God
Help
As the unseen creature thrashes around inside the shed, the walls topple outward and the roof drops to the ground like a pancake
Melvin has lost all self control and just keeps screaming
Val pulls along side, jumps down onto the tread, and reaches out to Melvin
But just as they join hands, the creature hits the roof from beneath, dragging it several feet
Val is yanked off the bulldozer and lands with Nelvin on the roof
The creature slams into the roof repeatedly, but the corrugated metal is both light and resilient
It bends, but the frustrated monster can't get enough "bite" to tear through it
Val and Melvin straddle the peak of the roof, trying desperately to hang on as it heaves up, buckling like a bronco
Earl scrambles into the bulldozer driver's seat and heads after them at full throttle, the big diesel roaring
Melvin and Val prepare to jump onto the bulldozer, but just before it reaches them the roof suddenly starts to slide like some mad flying carpet, carried from beneath by a creature
Val hangs on like a rodeo rider, struggling to keep fear- crazed Melvin from tumbling off
151
-                                        151 The roof zigs and zags, spins and twists
Melvin and Val won't be shaken loose
Earl does his best to head it off, but it's hard to predict which way the roof will scoot next
The rood careens alongside the edge of a dirt-walled drainage ditch, then suddenly skitters sideways and plunges over the edge
Melvin and Val tumble to the bottom
As they jump to their feet: We got about three seconds
Val sees, almost right above them, an exposed pipe which spans the ditch
He shoves Melvin toward it
They leap up and grab the pipe, pulling their legs up as high as they can
An instant later, the creature blasts through one wall of the ditch, roars past beneath them and burrows into the opposite wall
Earl brings the bulldozer to a thundering stop next to them
Well, come on
152
'  -                                    152 Nancy and Mindy huddle together on their roof
The upraised scoop blade of the bulldozer comes   with Val riding it
He helps them step across into it
153
& '  -  -                     153 Burt is using a hacksaw to cut lengths from a heavy vertical pipe to which his  antenna was anchored
Heather works with the sections Burt has already cut off
She is filling them with gunpowder from reloading cannisters and hammering the ends shut -- they're making bombs
Then they hear rumbling
What is it, more creatures
They're surprised by the odd sight of the strange contraption approaching
(impressed) God damn
Armored transport
Val climbs up on the bulldozer roll cage so he's about even with Heather and Burt
creature occasionally slams into the underside of the bulldozer of the semi trailer, rocking them slightly, throwing up clouds of dust
Let's go you two
We're headed for the mountains
In a minute
He grabs a coil of blackpowder cannon fuse
He cuts off a length and stuffs it in the end of one of the pipe bombs during: Come on, Burt, we can't hold still long
They're damn smart and getting smarter by the minute
Burt hefts the finished bomb
That's fine
We've got some new things to teach them
Damn it
They'll sink this rig just like a boat
Just then the bulldozer starts to tilt sideways, creatures digging dirt away beneath it
Earl guns it forward out of the depression they're making
See that
They're doing it now
They try it every time we hold still
Burt and Heather are impressed
They rush around the rooftop, gathering food, ammo, guns, the finished bombs, handing them to impatient Val who hands them down to people in the semi trailer during: Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles
Be there in two hours, tops
Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right
He holds up to rifles to Heather, the HK91 assault rifle and another elephant gun
What do you think
Max firepower or
'd go for penetration
The 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway
Burt nods
Everyone on the bulldozer and semi trailer shouts: (adlib) Come on
Who cares
Forget it
Let's go
Dust flies up
The bulldozer tilts
Earl guns it forward again
Heather and Burt grab a few more things and leap down into the semi trailer
Give me a gun
'll take one
wouldn't give you a gun if it was World War Three
Earl pilots the strange looking contraption out into the desert
Burt and Heather watch their fortress-home recede
Food for five years
thousand gallons of gas
Air filtration
Water filtration
Geiger counter
Bomb shelter
(looks heavenward) underground goddamn monsters
Heather puts a consoling arm around him
154
-                                        154 The bulldozer easily lumbers along the really rough road we saw Val and Earl's truck struggle over the other morning
As they come closer we see Burt and Heather riding "shotgun," he sitting out in the bulldozer's scoop, she on the rear of the semi trailer, elephant guns at the ready
Val, Earl and Rhonda are in the cab
155
-                                            155 It's late afternoon, sun casting dramatic shadows across the beautiful desert
We are  on the bizarre vehicle, resolutely grinding along not far from the cliffs, nearing the mountains ahead
156
-  -                                156 As they scan the desert, the people are feeling like they may get out of this after all
Earl calls back to the people in the semi trailer
Any sign of'em
Maybe they just gave up, you know
Yeah, the bulldozer's too much for them, man
As they top a gentle rise, Burt excitedly points ahead
There we go, solid rock
Everyone cheers
But then Heather points up ahead to one side
What's that
157
-   -   -                         157 Perhaps two hundred yards from them, a huge cloud of dust wells up from behind big boulders
158                                                     158 Everyone stares uneasily at the billowing cloud
Is it them
What else could it be
What're they doing
Maybe they're taking a dump
We're not going over there, right
No
We go straight
Damn it
What the hell are they doing
They're up to something
don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there
Earl shoves the throttle all the way
The engine screams
159
-  -                                159 We   through the cloud of dust
Dirt is flying by the ton out of en eight foot diameter hole in the ground
huge mound of the tunneled-out dirt is already piled high
The creatures are digging a tunnel -- but why
160
-  -                                160 We watch the bulldozer rumbling along
It seems unstop- able
The mountains and safety are barely a mile away -- when the The machine ends up half-buried at a steep angle
The semi trailer is right on the edge of the pit
Everyone is shaken, bruised, bloodied
Val, Earl and Rhonda look frantically for Burt, who was riding out front in the scoop
They're relieved to see him clawing his way out of pit
Val hauls him up and all four of them now leap into the semi trailer
As they come to rest, Val slowly realizes what's happened
They
they dug a trap
can't believe this
The idling bulldozer engine coughs and dies
There is a moment's crushing silence
Then the dreaded digging begins
Dust boils up around the semi trailer -- creatures digging from below
The semi trailer shakes and shudders, slowly sinking
The people huddle together in sheer panic
Val and Earl grab the nearest of Burt and Heather's guns and fire wildly, hope- lessly, down at the dirt
Ricochets whine into the distance
Burt grimly digs an overloaded knapsack for one of his pipe bombs
He leaps up between Val and Earl and lights the fuse, looking for a target
Hungry
Eat this
He tosses the bomb at some churning earth and dives back into the semi trailer
(cont'd) Keep your heads down
The explosion throws up a big plume of dust and rocks
We hear a new very strange sound of pain from the creatures
The semi trailer instantly stops shaking
The creatures have stopped digging
All is quiet
The people peer up over the edge of the semi trailer, looking all around
Then: There they are
161
-                           161 Numerous spurts of dust mark their paths as they race madly away, fanning out from the semi trailer
162                                                     162 Hey, Burt
did you get one
No, there's still four of them
See
there's like four different dust trails
Sure got their attention, though
Nice going, Burt
(to Earl) Earl, what about the Cat
Earl's already staring down at the bulldozer
No way
It's down for the count
Val looks around
163
-                                     163 Toward the cliffs he sees a big rock outcrop
164                                                     164 Rhonda points in the opposite direction from where Val is looking
Here they come
They're coming back
Heather unexpectedly fire two deafening blasts from her elephant gun at the approaching creatures, then shakes her head, frustrated
They're still coming
Come on, everybody
We gotta run for those rocks over there
Jesus, Val, it's pretty far
Yeah, man
They'll get us
There sure as hell get us if we stay here
Wait, wait, listen
Burt do you have any more of those things
The bombs
Damn right  do
Well, what is you throw one that way, the way we want to go
(points toward rocks) Then, when the explosion happens
if it drives them away again
we all run like goddamn bastards
(to Earl) Pardon my French
Wham
With a jolt the semi trailer begins shaking and shuddering again -- sinking, smiling
What if it doesn't scare them
What if they don't run
don't think it does scare them
It hurts them
They're  so sensitive to sound, they have to run
It hurts too much
Glances all around
She's got my vote
Right
We're gonna run
Get ready
Val squats in front of tear-streaked Mindy
(cont'd) Mindy, you understand what we're going to do
(off her nod) And don't worry, they can't get us once we're on those rocks
don't know, man
They're too fast
You can't outrun them, no way
As Burt readies another bomb, he pauses to hand bug-eyed Melvin a huge Ruger Super Redhawk 44 magnum handgun
Here, kid
This'll make'em think twice
Melvin's eyes bug out further
Burt lights his bomb
(cont'd) Heads down
He hurls the bomb
Wait
Wait
Again we hear the creatures' unearthly shriek of pain
Rhonda's on her feet before the rocks stop falling
She spots the creatures
It worked
There they go
'
Earl lets out a war wild
It's infectious with them as everyone piles out of the semi trailer like soldiers out of a trench -- they charge across no-man's-land
Melvin runs like a demon
He tries to shoot at the first thing he sees but the gun just clicks over and over -- empty
Burt, you bastard
Enraged, he doubles his speed, trying to overtake Burt
Mindy can't keep up
Nancy tries to pull her along
Val and Earl swoop in, grab Mindy under either arm, and carry her between them
165    -                                          165 The ground heaves violently as the retreating monsters angrily wheel about and charge back after the humans
166
-   -                             166 Big slabs jutting this way and that -- a rock iceberg in a sand ocean
The people scramble onto it amid whoops of joy and relief
Melvin charges up to Burt: You asshole
There's no bullets in this gun
Got you moving, didn't it
Burt's line gets a laugh from people, but then tentacles burst up on all sides of the rock, probing, feeling
The effect is instantly sobering
Burt swiftly grabs out his remaining bombs -- six of them -- and holds one ready
But they're in no immediate danger
So
now what
Could we make it to the mountains
(gestures to Burt's bombs) No way
We'd need fifty of those things
The hopelessness of the situation suddenly hits Val, Earl, and Rhonda
After a moment: Well
that's it
We're not getting off this rock
Not going to pole vault anywhere
That's for sure
What's the matter with you
What are you talking about
They'll just wait out there till we're dead
That's what they do
As this sinks in, Burt loses his cool, igniting an argument
What
Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place
We had food, water
You can't fight'em that way
You two jackasses hauled us way the hell out here
,
Well, who put you two in charge
(shouts) Burt
Those animals would have killed you
Everyone stares in surprise at normally quiet Nancy
(cont'd) (softly) You haven't seen what they can do
(calmer) They'd have dug your place out from under you in half an hour
There's a long, grim silence
Everyone sits glumly
Finally, Burt picks up a bomb and contemplates it: (losing it) If it comes to starvation,  know what 'm doing
Take one of these
Walk right out there with the fuse lit
Stuff it down my pants and let 'em take me down
Heather puts a soothing hand on his shoulder
Jesus, honey
But now Earl brightens a little
You know, that's not a bad idea
The others react
Is Earl nuts
No,  mean, it gives me an idea
going fishing like
167
-   -                           167 In the open desert, a rock lands
Then another
Val and Rhonda are throwing them from the rock outcrop
Val, Earl, Rhonda, and Burt have moved away from the main group to another section of the rock outcrop where intervening boulders will protect everyone from an explosion
Earl has tied a bomb to some nylon rope form one of Burt's knapsacks
Burt places the other bombs safely out of the way behind a ledge
Meanwhile, Val and Rhonda keep throwing rocks
Soon, the ground shifts
There
Right straight out in front of you
Burt has his coil of fuse
How much you think
don't know
They're pretty quick
fifteen seconds
Burt nods, expertly eyeballing a fifteen second length and snipping it off
As he stuffs it into the bomb: What the hell is that, anyway
Cannon fuse
What do you use it for
(matter of fact) My cannon
The bomb is ready -- it's moment of truth
Earl digs in his pocket for the lighter -- but Val has it
Val nervously leans over to light the fuse, but then frowns as he sees how Earl is holding the rope
Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing
Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope
Val shakes his head and lights the fuse
Earl whirls the bomb on the end of its rope like a lasso, and lets it fly out as far as he can
Then he starts pulling it back in along the ground like a fishing lure
Rhonda stares at her watch as they all sink down behind the protective boulder
Come on
come on
Take it
take the bait
Suddenly a snout subtly surfaces and gulps down the bomb tense two seconds later --
Bullseye
It's a volcano of gory creature parts
They splatter all over
The remaining creatures shriek and race away again
The people cheer wildly
: 168
-   -                           168 Val, Earl, Rhonda, and Burt prepare to try again
This time Val has the rope and a new bomb
Rhonda stands by him, ready with the lighter
Earl lobs rocks out into the desert
Where the hell are they
Hope they didn't wise up
(pointing) Nope, there
That's one
Rhonda shakily lights the fuse
Val heaves the bomb out and starts trolling
The creature swallows it
Everyone drops down behind the boulder, Val impulsively grabbing a second bomb
They tense with anticipatory glee -- but the creature suddenly spits its bomb back out It sails back right over their heads
It strikes the rocks above them, skittering down a crevice and landing in -- '
Val, Earl, and Rhonda scatter
Burt dives backward over a rock ledge
All the bombs explode, throwing rocks every- where
The creatures streak away
Val, Earl and Rhonda sprawl into the dirt, half stunned
When the panic is over, Val and Earl realize where they are -- fifty yards out in open desert
So is Rhonda, off at an angle from them
Only Burt is safe on the rock outcrop
And the creatures are coming back fast
The stranded trio starts back for the outcrop, but the creatures burst up ahead of them -- one blocking Rhonda's path, the other two cutting Val and Earl off
The creatures roar toward their easy prey
Val and Earl freeze
The ground bulges as the creatures "skid" to a halt not ten feet from them
Rhonda stands stock still some fifty feet away, eyeing her own creature
Over on the outcrop with the main group of people Heather sizes up the situation
Make noise
Everybody
Everyone starts hopping up and down, yelling, screaming, and clapping
Burt even runs a few feet out from the rocks, firing a pistol into the dirt
,
The crowd keeps up the ruckus
The creatures are distracted by the noise, but this time they don't automatically go after it
Their big snouts turn uncertainly this way and that
But they just stay where they are
Their hook-tentacles slide out, feeling all around
Earl whispers: They're not falling for it
Heather takes careful aim with her elephant gun
'll make'em pay attention goddamnit
But before she can fire, the creatures mysteriously sink from view
Val, Rhonda, and Earl remain frozen
What the hell is going on
Nothing happens -- then -- suddenly wells up near Rhonda
It sinks back down as fast as it appeared
It's like the creature suddenly lifted its whole body almost to the surface then submerged again
Another hump rises and falls right near Val and Earl
There's a pause as the men whisper: They're
they're trying to make us move
Or just knock us over
Look, use the bomb
It's out last one
We can't kill them all
The creatures try another random "barrage" of humps, some coming perilously close
They know they'll eventually topple their prey
One comes so close to Val and Earl that pebbles roll down its sides into their boots
Use the fucking bomb
So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway
(slowly; terrified) want to live for the three days
More humps rise and fall
Val gives in
He signals Rhonda, gesturing with the bomb
She understands
He'll set it off, driving away the creatures, and they'll all run back to the outcrop
Val digs for the lighter
Doesn't have it
Earl digs for it, too
But he doesn't have it either
They go dead pale
How can that be
They look across fifty feet of deadly open ground -- trembling Rhonda holds up the lighter
Over on the outcrop, Burt shouts: What's wrong
Use the bomb, for Godsake
Val signals to Rhonda to throw the lighter
She nods
But just before she does, She fights to keep her balance -- struggling to keep from taking that single step which will instantly tell the creatures where she is
But there's no hope
The hump jerks higher
Her boots slip down the gravelly side
Instantly the creature twists toward her, its hungry mouth erupting out of the dirt
She screams and dashes for Val and Earl
They run to meet her
The other creatures surface
The trio is cut off from the rock outcrop
Val and Earl link up with Rhonda and they all run madly while Rhonda tries to light Val's bomb fuse
But suddenly Val yanks the bomb away
No wait
This way
He veers off in a new direction
Startled Earl and Rhonda have no choice but to follow
As they desperately try to catch up to Val: (gasping) What the hell are you doing
Earl looks up ahead
They're headed right for -- 169
-                                        169 The massive cliffs
Earl's eyes bug out
In seconds they'll be right at the brink with nowhere to run
This better be one great plan
As they skid to a stop at the very brink, Val breaks off the bomb fuse, leaving only one inch of it
He whirls to check the progress of the advancing creatures
Get ready
He holds the bomb out to Rhonda
She instantly tries to light it
He grabs her wrist so hard it hurts
Light it, man
Not yet, not yet
The charging creatures are almost underfoot
Finally Val pulls Rhonda's hand over to light the fuse
Instantly he hurls the bomb as far as he can, behind the creatures
Too far
You threw it behind them
The ground opens under their feet
Tentacles snake toward Val and Earl
horrid mouth clamps onto Rhonda's boot
She screams as it starts to pull her down
The bomb explodes
The creatures shriek in pain, instantly releasing their prey and racing away from the painful shock wave in the only direction they can -- 170
-    -                           170 Right out through the face of the cliffs The huge, shrieking creatures seem to hang in mid-air for a moment, their grotesque bodies undulating in pain
And then they fall
And fall and fall -- a thousand feet
171
-                                  171 The creatures land on massive jagged rocks, exploding like immense, horrid watermelons
Multi-colored gore festoons the whole cliff face
to see three tiny figures standing at the top of the cliff
172
-                                            172 Val peers down at the distant creatures for a long time
Then he notices Earl and Rhonda are staring at him
Where the hell did he get an idea like that
After a moment: Well, it just suddenly hit me, you know
Stampede
They turn and head back toward the others
They laugh as they realize how stealthily they are walking
Val starts taking big, exaggerated stomping steps
Rhonda and Earl follow suit
The trio goes off arm in arm, stomping merrily
: 173
-   -                          173 Val and Earl roll two scavenged truck wheels down the street toward their own truck; which is up on jacks, two wheels missing
Mindy races past excitedly
Look
highway maintenance truck is rolling into town followed by a police car
The townsfolk happily swarm around the and   who gape at the destroyed town
Val and Earl eagerly start bolting on one of their new wheels
Road's in
Road's in
Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls
We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in People magazine
People Hell, National Geographic Sell the movie rights
We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar
Yeah
but no ties
No ties
Rhonda pulls up in her truck, leans out and snaps their picture with a top-of-the-line Nikon
Hi, guys
Burt loaned me his camera
Howdy, Rhonda
You're really leaving, huh
You bet
You gonna be staying up here
Well, yeah
There's going to be major research up here
First thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up
An awkward pause
Finally she extends her hand to them
Val just gives it a quick shake
(cont'd) Uh
well, maybe 'll see you two sometime
(to Val) And thanks for everything, you know, saving my life and stuff
(awkwardly) Well
you're welcome
She gazes at him, just a hint of something in her eyes
Earl springs to attention
Is the boy blind Then Rhonda snaps out of it
Well
see ya
They nod
She drives off
Earl stares at Val who starts putting the second wheel on the truck
Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil
Civil
'm civil
You're not civil, you're glum
We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me
Earl freezes as a bell goes off in his head
(cont'd) Oh my God
She got to you
You do like her
Somebody paying you to do this
She just practically asked you for a date
What the hell is wrong
Val glares at Earl for a moment
Earl, get real
What does she need with a guy like me
Earl is dumbfounded
What was that
All this time she's not good enough for you
Now, suddenly, you're not good enough for her
God, my work is never done
You don't decide is you're worthless, she does
But you gotta give her a chance
Val lowers the jack letting the truck down
Earl, 'm not gonna make a fool of myself
You got that covered
Earl stands there fuming, mind racing
last ditch idea hits home -- we see a devilish glint in his eye
Fine, make the mistakes  did
think 'll just be playing this hand myself
What
She likes both of us
We both helped her out
You are so full of shit
Oh yeah
Think about this:  She ain't as narrow-minded as you
'll lay odds she's looking for character in a man
For my part, 'd be proud to have her
'd goddamn worship her
Earl hops into the truck
(cont'd) 'm going out there right now, help her take those pictures
set up her seismo-jiggers
Whatever she wants
Who the hell knows what'll happen
Earl starts to drive off
Val springs into the passenger seat
Through the truck's rear window we see Val raise his hand in The Challenge
They do a round of scissors-rock- paper -- but it's a tie
They go again
Another tie
