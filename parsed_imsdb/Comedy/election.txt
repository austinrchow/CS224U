Along the front sidewalk, a lone  trundles a garbage bin filled with overstuffed hefty bags
weathered   pulls into the empty   and comes to a stop near the athletic field
'  - () None of this would have happened if Mr
McAllister hadn't meddled the way he did
He should have just accepted things as they are instead of trying to interfere with destiny
You see, you can't interfere with destiny
That's why it's destiny
And if you try to interfere, the same thing's going to happen anyway, and you'll just suffer
, a teacher in his mid to late-thirties, emerges from the car in running clothes and carrying a briefcase, gym bag, and coffee mug
On his way to the field, he crosses paths with the janitor

The top of every sheet reads "Tracy Flick for President: Official Nomination Signatures
" -- tries to place his lunch inside, but the shelves are too crammed with old take-out containers
He opens one and smells it
Disgusted, he drags a garbage can over and begins throwing things away
Lowell appears in the doorway wheeling his squeaky maintenance cart and watches  conduct his purge as     misses the can and rolls on the floor
-- Tracy is seated behind her card table strategically placed near the school's main entrance
sign taped to the wall behind her reads, ,
She checks her watch, readies herself
walks around the corner whistling vaguely
Good morning, Mr
McAllister
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy
(chirping) You know what they say about the early bird
Yes,  do
An awkward moment passes between them
Well, good luck there, Tracy Thanks, Mr
turns and walks away, Tracy watches him
He stops and picks up some litter, tosses it in a nearby garbage can
() No matter what he says, Mr
McAllister had it out for me from the start
Oh sure, he was all smiles and good wishes and everything, but underneath he was just as unfair and petty as anybody else
' Alone in his room,  studies the Omaha World-Herald ( ') He'll probably tell you how committed he was to teaching and democracy and integrity and all
Don't be fooled
After laying the paper down to circle an article,  leans back in his chair and momentarily loses himself in thought
() It's hard to remember how the whole thing started, the whole election mess
What  do remember is that  loved my job

McAllister reads aloud from the newspaper as he paces in front of his class of high school juniors, Tracy Flick among them
The seats are arranged in a -
( ') Standing in front of a room full of young people, trying to make them think that's how  wanted to spend the rest of my life, slaps the newspaper for emphasis and addresses the class So would this be an ethical situation or a moral situation
What's the difference between ethics and morals, anyway
Tracy shoots her hand into the air
notices but keeps looking around
(') Anybody Other hands rise tentatively (') Derek Uh, ethics is like when you, uh, do what society tells you is right and morals are like, uh
You're on the right track,  who can help him out
morals are when
Tracy's hand goes higher
Michelle
Morals are like lessons, you know, like the moral of a story; it's what you learn from a story or a fable or something
Or a life experience
Good
And ethics
That's more like, urn
Ethics is how you use the morals

Okay
But we're still missing something key here
What are we missing

Ethics are

() Tracy Flick
Tracy Flick
've never met anyone quite like Tracy Flick
--  -- sits to one side, monitoring the student council  about to convene
younger Tracy enters briskly and, unlike her casual teen comrades, has made an attempt to dress for success
She takes a seat right up front and opens her backpack
After preparing her notepad and pen, Tracy puts a on the table in front of her and pushes
( ') She first showed up in my life as a freshman delegate in student council
'd seen a lot of ambitious students come and go over the years, but  could tell right away Tracy Flick was different
observes Tracy, trying to size her up
-- putting all her little things in order, finally folding her hands to wait
( ') It wasn't long before everyone knew who Tracy Flick was
She made sure of that
Her drive was astonishing
Even scary
-    ' -: It fans open to the

( ') My Mom always tells me 'm different -- you know, special
And if you look at all the things 've accomplished so far, think you'd have to agree
We see Tracy on other pages too: "Yearbook Staff goes for it
" "Junior Achievers put on the dog
" "Student Council meets the challenge;" Oklahoma's a hit
( ') Here  am in Oklahoma
The  of Tracy in Oklahoma suddenly
On stage, Tracy wears a cowgirl outfit and hams it up with exaggerated gestures
(off-key) 'm just a girl who can't say no
/ It's the closed-circuit school
Tracy is delivering a stand-up report from the crowded cafeteria
Her dress and makeup are an obvious if lame emulation of a professional newswoman
() And here  am on , our student-run station
( ) that's why Principal Hendricks made the controversial announcement that the littering must stop
Tracy Flick reporting
-- Student Council meeting is underway led by the president, girl, , is speaking
observes from the side
() But it was in , the Student Government Association, where  made my biggest mark
never missed a meeting, and  volunteered for every committee as long as  could lead it
Before Ashley can finish, Tracy agree with Ashley
We should rent the barrels at least a day beforehand
What happened last time was a travesty, mean, we were -- (trying to quiet her) Yeah, no,  know, Tracy
That's why we're -- Look, can we just take a vote on this

And so far she was running unopposed

() Oh
There's one more thing about Tracy think you should know
- -- , another teacher in his mid-thirties Her pussy gets so wet you can't believe it
- Dave is leaning across his desk to speak with  at an adjacent work area
They eat sack lunches
() few months before the election, she'd had an affair with my best friend Dave Novotny
Don't tell me that
don't want to know that
She's incredible
Everything just gets soaked
' 	 Dun-dun-
Dun-dun- and Dave are playing the opening notes of "Foxy Lady" through cheap, distorting amps
plays bass
Dave plays guitar and sings into a microphone
They're bad
As in not good
The basement is typical of a Midwest middle-class young couple -- half storage and laundry, half makeshift roc-room
() Dave came to Millard the year after did, and we hit it off right away
We backed each other up in teachers' meetings and shared an interest in 60's music and micro-breweries
really getting into it, playing to an unseen stadium
Behind him  is very careful with his chords
( ') You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy
(singing) Foxy
Foxy
You know you're a cute little heartbreaker
Foxy
You know you're a sweet little love maker

' from the open basement stairway door and toward and   seated at the kitchen  table
They are fussing over little six-month-old   in his highchair
() Our wives became best friends too
And when Dave and Sherry's son Darryl was born, they asked us to be godparents
At a particularly grating note from downstairs, Diane gets up and closes the basement door
is being drawn on the blackboard and bisected
to reveal Dave explaining
The class is taking notes, and we zero in on a younger Tracy
( ') probably think the worst - that Mr
Novotny was just taking advantage of one of his students, but it wasn't like that at all
Our relationship was based on mutual respect and admiration
mean, during my sophomore year in geometry it was strictly professional between us -- mean, nothing
'  --  The parking lot, the neon lights, the promise of good times
( ') It wasn't until junior year when we worked together on the yearbook that things got serious
'  --  Dave and  Tracy are at a booth along with six other students
, and the others shift positions
Others continue to disappear in the same way, until only Dave and Tracy remain
( ') One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline
Eventually Dave and  were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults
You know, Tracy
don't know how to say this, but
Dave's finger traces the rim of his frosty root beer mug
what
Well,  notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard
You seem to be kind of a loner
No, 'm not
'm just really busy
know
know its not by choice just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to
What do you mean
What kind of person am
What kind of person
Dave looks directly into her eyes
(') Tracy, 've been watching you for going on two years now, and  think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings --  have ever met
mean, you're the real thing
Special
(embarrassed, low) Thank you
And  know sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness, and that price is loneliness
Tracy nods in quiet recognition
(') don't know
Maybe 'm wrong
But it seems like you might need a friend
-- with cloudy glass and a stenciled sign:
through the door and  through an empty room to discover another door with a sign that reads
() Since  grew up without a dad, you might assume psychologically  was looking for a father figure
through the darkroom door to bathed in red light
Tracy is sitting on Dave's lap as they make out hungrily
( ') But that had nothing to do with it at all
It was just that Dave was so strong and made me feel so safe and protected
'  -- Dave drives
Tracy sits in the passenger seat
( ') It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows
(looking around) Here, get down
- Dave wheels his car into the open garage
The automatic door closes behind him
Dave stands up from his squat at the , and the sexy sounds of Sade set the mood
Tracy is seated awkwardly at one end of the sofa, a Diet Dr
Pepper in one hand
Dave walks slowly toward her, a sexy, knowing look in his eye
The music is sexy
Tracy is sexy
He's sexy
Keeping his eyes locked on Tracy's, he takes the pop can from her hand and takes a sip himself
Sexy
Dave and Tracy walk up the stairs and down the hall
Dave enters the bedroom first, while Tracy pauses in the hall
His arm reaches out and pulls her inside
we see Dave and Tracy Tracy's head and naked shoulders lay themselves on Dave's pillow
She looks toward the foot of the bed at -- , unable to believe his eyes
He looks at naked Tracy up and down, up and down, his breath quickening
Sade wafts up the stairs
Look at you
He descends out of frame
() When  think back on my relationship with Mr
Novotny, what  miss most
is our talks
' is riveted by Dave's story; he is both horrified and titillated You did it at your house
Your own house
Look, Jim
Okay
know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the
for the sex and the danger
But now it's different
Jim, what 'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and  are totally, totally in love
In love
Yeah, it's serious
mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has
She even wants to read my novel
But you haven't written your novel
That's the whole point
It's all in my head; it's right here
just got to get it out there
Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it
It's beautiful
Dave, 'm just saying this as your friend
What you're doing is really, really wrong, and you've got to stop
Dave draws a heavy sigh and buries his head in his hands perhaps has reached him
Perhaps not
You're not just jealous, are you mean, we both used to talk about her (exploding) That was just talk
Fantasy talk
What are you, nuts
We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything
would never
mean,  take very seriously our strict moral code
The line you've crossed is
it's illegal and it's immoral
don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay
know what -- 'm not talking about ethics
'm talking about morals
() Peek-a-boo
Sherry comes down the basement stairs with Darryl in her arms
(to Jim, whispering) Look,  appreciate your concern really do
But like  said,  got it under control
As Sherry approaches them, Dave rises to take Darryl, the perfect father:  hug, tickle, kiss
() guess  don't have to tell you how all this turned out
' slumped in a chair
He is lost in agony: all he can do is look down and draw short, gasping breaths
Principal Walt Hendricks is at his desk, examining a little

-- the small makeshift booklet whose cover reads, "There's a place for us" in overdone fancy cursive

" Below: Take my hand and we'll soon be there
has a cutout of a bouquet of flowers
It reads, "Tracy, See you in paradise
Love, your 'teacher' David
really, really need you now
"  The booklet is lowered
Tracy's Mom -- she doesn't understand
No, 'd say she doesn't
don't think 've ever seen a mother quite so upset
We're all very, very lucky she doesn't want this public
Dave looks at  for help
looks away
Dave's breaths grow more convulsive
Finally - But we're in love Dave
Dave, look at me Dave looks slowly up
want you to get some help
& ' Sherry cradles Darryl while Dave grovels at her feet
() After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce
Your novel
Are you fucking kidding me
Dave follows Sherry as she takes the baby into their bedroom and slams the door in Dave's face
Dave pounds on the door, eventually sinking to his knees and crying
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry
() He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents
haven't heard from him in a long time
Poor guy warned him
'  -- Tracy, still frozen,
Maybe now she can finish certain time in history and Maybe not
At the bell, students instantly shut their textbooks and collect their things
Okay
We'll pick up here next time Tracy is miffed as she puts her things away: slam, stuff, zip
She slings her backpack over her shoulder and heads toward the door
She looks back at -- who himself now  as he talks to a couple of students () Now that  have more life experience, feel sorry for Mr
McAllister
-   - of Jim's appearance - his slightly frayed collar and bad tie; the heels of his old docksiders worn down at irritating angles; the faded impression his too-big wallet has made in his khakis; his growing bald spot; his ear hairs
() mean, anyone who's stuck in the same little room saying the exact same things year after year for his whole life, wearing the same stupid clothes, while his students go on to good colleges and move to big cities and do great things and make loads of money has got to be at least a little jealous
It's like my room says - the weak always try to sabotage the strong
Tracy turns and walks out the door
'  -- - in a Sears-style portrait across a wall full of other framed photos of Tracy accepting awards, dancing in a recital, poised to dive at a swim meet
( ') One thing that's important to know about me is that 'm an only child
So my Mom is really devoted to me, and love her so much
She wants me to do all the things she wanted to do in life but couldn't
Tracy's mother,  , finishes a letter and puts it in an envelope
( ') See, Mom used to be a stewardess for Northwest and now works as a para-legal
She likes to write letters to successful women like Janet Reno and Elizabeth Dole and ask them how they got to be where they are and what advice do they have for me, Tracy, her daughter
'  as the envelope flap slides across it
politician's  plastered to her face, Tracy is at her card table vigorously gathering signatures
( ') Nine times out of ten they say you have to hold on to your dreams no matter what
The pressures women face mean you have to work twice as hard, and you can't let anything or anyone stand in your way
shabbily dressed  --   -- walks past and grabs a huge handful of gum
One per person
Put those back John just keeps on walking away, and his two  take great delight in his nimble-witted, quick retort
Eat me -- While other students sit in groups around her, Tracy sits apart at her own table, concentrated and alone
She is writing little numbers by her signatures
Ninety-seven
ninety-eight
() But you know,  winning isn't everything
If you play fair and follow all the rules thoroughly, you'll always come out ahead
Win or lose, ethical conduct is the most important thing
Just ask Mr
McAllister
--    ' Mr
McAllister
Mr
McAllister
Wait up Jim, his tie loose and his sleeves rolled up, looks up from unlocking his car
Tracy runs toward him holding out a

One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than  need
Hey, that's super Here they are
You can put those in my box
'll look at them tomorrow
Could you approve them now
'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning
(resigned) Right He cursorily flips through the bound pages and offers them back to Tracy
(') Looks good to me
Aren't you supposed to keep them
, that's fine thought you were supposed to keep them
Okay, fine
Sure throws his briefcase and Tracy's folder into the backseat
Thanks for everything
You bet
Tracy stays put as  climbs in, shuts the door and fastens his seat belt
(cheery, awkward) can't wait to start campaigning
Should be easy
So far no competition
Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising
guess that's how come they stay number one
Yeah
Okay
well, good luck Tracy They exchange a long, curious stare
There's a tone at once confrontational and vaguely sexual about this moment
You know, Mr
, when  win the presidency, that means you and  are going to be spending a lot of time together next year
And  for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive
Wouldn't you
Sure Okay
That's good
just wanted to make sure
Good luck, Tracy
pulls away and heads for the parking lot exit
'    -- drives stone-faced, unblinking
Something about the music on the radio mocks him
() don't blame Tracy for what happened with Dave
How could
Dave was an adult more than twice her age
pulls to a stop next to a giant Out of his window come yellowed newspapers, balled-up fast food bags, and other detritus
He speeds away
( ') Sure, she got on my nerves once in a while, but  admired Tracy
really did
we see Tracy's little bound book of signatures
- and his wife Diane sit at their dining room table, eating chicken pot pies, baked potatoes with sour cream, salad with Lite Ranch dressing
Not a word passes between them
( ') Thank God for Diane
She was my best friend, my source of love and strength
Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy times, but we'd always seen them through
After nine years of marriage, we were closer than ever
And the secret
Good communication
Anything wrong
Everything's fine
Just, you know, school
- lies awake in bed while Diane snores beside him
Something seems to be echoing in his head
' You know, Coca-Cola's by far the number one soft drink
When  win the presidency we're going to be spending a lot of time together
a lot of time
lots and lots and lots of time
president and advisor
'  as Tracy's  magically whisper into it
harmonious and productive
close and special
you and
so close
so intimate
together
In the darkness a light pops on, and  quietly pads down the stairs
He opens an old  , lifts out a few blankets and a piece of cardboard to reveal a row of   cleverly concealed in the bottom of the trunk

He sips a can of

It was like the end of my life
Paul stands talking to  in a very typical high school tableau
All wear backpacks or carry books
kneels to sign his cast
( ') When  got back to school everybody was so supportive, and they all wanted to sign my cast and everything

What did God want from me
- always flowing, never stopping, no beginning, no end ( ') Why did  exist
Paul is sleeping slumped over a table, his head cradled on crossed arms
The Celestine Prophecy is open face down next to him
( ') Sometimes you can search everywhere for answers
Then one day destiny just taps you on the shoulder
know, because it happened to me
reaches down and taps Paul's shoulder
Paul comes to and looks -- it's Mr
McAllister
Paul, could  talk to you for a minute
- His arm on Paul's shoulder,  walks Paul down a deserted hall and into Jim's classroom
picks up some scrap paper off the floor and puts it in the proper place
() Mr
McAllister changed my life
And no matter what they say he did or did not do,  believe he is a good man

Yeah
But you've got a big choice right now
You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life
Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity
personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and don't mean the fleeting glory of sports
What do you mean
Let me give you a clue
You're a born leader
You're one of the most popular students at Millard
You're honest and straightforward
You don't choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside
The other kids look up to you
What does that spell
Paul furrows his brow and looks around, searching for an answer
His lower lip is wet
Student
council
president
It takes a moment for this to sink in
Finally Who, me
Nooo
never
don't know anything about that stuff, Mr
Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing
She's always working so hard and -- Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right
And she's super-nice Yeah
But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it
That's more like a
well, like a dictatorship, like we studied
Paul, what's your favorite fruit
Huh
Oh
Uh
pears takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard
Okay, let's say No, wait -- apples
Apples
draws illustrative circles on the board as he speaks
Fine
Let's say all you ever knew was apples
Apples, apples and more apples
You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one
Then one day there's an orange
And now you can make a decision
Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange
That's democracy
also like bananas
Exactly
So what do you say
Maybe it's time to give a little something back
Tracy directs her friend   on a ladder as he hangs a large  high on a wall
The right side is too high
The right side
Just a smidge
Suddenly she notices a small  in the adjacent cafeteria and goes to investigate
small crowd of students compete to sign Paul's nomination petition taped to the wall
(signing) Hey Paul, you going over to Anthony's on Friday, or what did you decide
gotta talk to him first
Tracy watches the hubbub, none too pleased, and pushes her way to the front of the group
Who put you up to this
Huh
Oh, hi, Tracy Tracy stares at him
Who put you up to this
What do you mean
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president
No
Uh
just
you know,  just thought -- Thought what
Well, see,  was talking to Mr
McAllister about my leg and everything
and how  still want to, you know, do something for the school and -- So Mr
McAllister asked you to run
Well,  mean, you know,  talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea
and how there's all different kinds of fruit and
It's nothing against you, Tracy
You're the best
just thought -- Okay, Mr
Popular
You're on
With that Tracy turns and  Paul's sheet ""  "" is dotted with a '  - as she walks away, Paul and his fans receding behind her () You might think it upset me that Paul Metzier had decided to run against me, but nothing could be further from the truth
He was no competition for me: it was like apples and oranges

"Vote Tracy

Tracy is making campaign buttons with her
She manufactures her buttons with almost alarming intensity begins to rise
( ') You see,  believe in the voters
They understand that elections aren't just popularity contests
They know this country was built by people just like me who work very hard and don't have everything handed to them on a silver spoon
drop one by one into a box
All the little round Tracys smile up at us
Paul is in the driver's seat of his hitching big-wheeled
His door is open, and his radio blasts a  carefully selected to boost soundtrack album sales

Tracy watches the scene from her seat on the ( ') Not like some rich kids who everybody likes because their fathers own Metzier Cement and give them trucks on their sixteenth birthday and throw them big parties all the time

( ') They think they can all of a sudden one day out of the blue waltz right in with no qualifications whatsoever and try to take away what other people have worked for very, very hard their entire lives
No, it didn't bother me at all '  -- Paul drives home, his stereo thumping
Silent, he appears lost in thought, as though a little gopher idea were burrowing its way to the surface
Oh, look -- there's its snout  now

They are   and , fifteen and seventeen respectively
Lisa breaks away
Tammy tries to kiss her again, but Lisa resists
(softly) What
told you

Whistling a cheerful tune, Paul tosses his backpack on a chair, grabs a banana, and opens the refrigerator
' Tammy is still trying to comfort Lisa
If you could just get out of your head
Tammy leans forward, puts her palm on Lisa's cheek
Lisa looks at Tammy as though at a stranger
Tammy leans forward and

Don't you fucking knock
Yeah
So guess what happened
So Mr
McAllister, he -- (noticing Lisa) Oh hi

So Mr

We peed a little every five minutes

Lisa studies at a table, surrounded by other busy students
() Everyday  found some new way to tell Lisa  loved her
Suddenly Tammy walks by, drops a folded  in front of Lisa, and walks on
Lisa opens it
(Tammy's voice) If you died right now,  would throw myself into one of my Dad's cement trucks and get poured into your tomb
Lisa looks over her shoulder at Tammy, who is now at the door of the library
Tammy nods at her with quiet loving reassurance
() But it just seemed like the closer we got, the more she pulled away
Lisa watches Tammy open her locker and notices a four-frame - taped to the inside of the door
In the photos Lisa and Tammy are clowning and smooching
Lisa reaches over and  the photos off the door
Are you crazy
What
People can see this
So
These are private -- these are for us

But other people can see them too
don't care
Well,  do
Lisa walks away with the photos -- next to us, a final reprise of Tammy's favorite memory () What did  do to make her change

His legs dangle over the edge of the bed, and Lisa kneels between them, her head bobbing up and down

Lisa pauses and looks up at Paul

Teeth
Sorry
Paul and Lisa sit with some other friends at a lunch table
Paul has one arm around Lisa as he eats with his other hand
() Life is so weird
First Lisa has a big fight with my sister, and the next thing you know she's my girlfriend
Lisa turns around to look at seated at another table directly behind them
She and Lisa lock eyes before they both turn around again
Paul poses for a campaign photo in his football uniform
He freezes in position as though about to throw a pass
Lisa adjusts his position --
( ') Since Lisa knew all about public relations and stuff, she offered to help me with my campaign
We made a great team
Tammy spies from underneath the bleachers Paul is on all fours as Lisa stands on his back to hang a poster with Paul's football picture reading: "Paul Metzier You Bet-zier
" ( ') It seemed so natural, the two of us together
It was like destiny
Tammy watches from a nearby classroom door, her nose and cheek pressed against the window

My leg wasn't bugging me too much, and the weather was so nice
And every afternoon after school
Lisa and  would go to her house to fuck and have a swim
It was like we were in a world all our own
Tammy emerges from behind a tree
She's on her bike
Angry and fragile, she watches the couple enter Lisa's house

Darryl's laughter suddenly turns into Here
Give him to me

That's it

You got him
Yeah
Sherry heads into the house
watches her walk, then turns toward Diane and Darryl
It's as though Diane, not Sherry, were the infant's real mother, so loving and attentive is she, so swelled with maternal piety
() Diane really wanted to have kids -- and so did  -- but it seemed like there was always a reason to wait: she had to finish nursing school,  had to get my masters, we needed a new house, we needed more money

Diane's voice now changes: it's Tracy's
() Fuck me, Mr
McAllister () So like  was saying, things were going pretty well in my life
-- It's passing period, and hundreds of students clog the halls () that is, until things started going all haywire with that damn election
distant - grows louder and louder
Everyone turns toward the source, far down the hall, and eventually  emerges wearing a makeshift   that reads "Tammy Metzier For President
" Smiling a perverse smile, she rings a hand bell
Salvation Army style
Paul is at his locker and watches Tammy go by
Tammy
Tammy, what are you doing
Tammy ignores her brother and keeps walking directly toward us, finally
'  --  Tracy sits opposite Mr
McAllister
You're the advisor
You should stop her
She's not qualified
She's just a sophomore
Calm down, Tracy
Just calm down
Are you sure all her signatures are real
It's not easy to get all those signatures
As far as  know, they-- Suddenly    are sitting where Tracy was
We can't both run, can we
We're brother and sister
Can we
It's a conflict of interest
And Paul was first
Anyone who gets signatures in on time can run
And she got in just under the wire
Nothing  can do
Now  replaces Lisa and Paul Let me see them
Let me see them Sighing,  fishes in his drawer and hands Tracy some sheets These are a bunch of burn-outs
And look at this one,  can't even read this one

mean at you
For what
don't know
You're her brother you should know
returns
Tim Kobza
Tim Kobza
Who's he
've never heard of him
Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy
We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and 'm sure everything will be fine
The entire student body is assembled on the bleachers
There is a palpable mood of boredom and apathy
, a handicapped kid in a wheelchair, is  at the microphone
His head lists to one side, and he takes  long breaths as he speaks
love Millard High, and  will be a dedicated vice President
vote for Jerry Slavin is a vote for good government
And even if  can't really stand up for you,  will
(cracks himself up) Thank you
Jerry motors away amid scattered applause and coughs
steps forward, clapping, and raises the mike
Thank you, Jerry, and good luck
Again, Jerry is running unopposed for Vice President
So we'll move on now to the presidential race with three candidates running
The first in alphabetical order is Tracy Flick
Tracy steps forward with a small stack of index cards
During her speech she flips the cards over one by one but rarely looks at them
Poet Henry David Thoreau once wrote, " cannot make my days longer, so  strive to make them better
"  With this election, we here at Millard also have an opportunity to make our high school days better
During this campaign have had the opportunity to speak with many of you about your concerns spoke with freshman Eliza Ramirez, who told me how alienated she feels from her own homeroom
spoke with sophomore Reggie Banks, who said his mother works in a cafeteria and can't afford to buy him enough spiral notebooks for his classes
won't bore you with long- winded promises about all the new and innovative things  will definitely achieve during the year in which it will be my honor and privilege to represent each and every one of you, but  can say that my years of experience on the student council have taught me the three most important attributes the president needs to possess;  commitment - Eat me ' Eat me raw
There is  scattered laughter
Tracy pauses, wait Hendricks bounds up and grabs the mike
If you can't be adults and give these candidates the courtesy they deserve, then you don't deserve to be called adults but children* Because that's what children are
And you'll be treated like children
So let's all listen up
Walt backs away to his seat
Tracy resumes The three most important attributes the president needs to possess are: commitment, qualifications, and experience
'll add one more; caring
care about Millard, and  care about each and every one of you, and together we can all make a difference
One of the things  would like to establish is a regular open forum where any student can come and voice their concern about issues we face here at Millard
and the rest of the student council would then interface with the faculty and staff, so a continuous dialogue would exist
Walt whispers to Jim
'd say she knows a thing or two about student-faculty dialogue
nods solemnly When you cast your vote for Tracy Flick next week, you won't just be voting for me
You'll be voting for yourself and for every other student Our days won't be any longer, but they can sure be better
Thank you
Tracy smiles and walks back to her folding chair
There is polite applause and a few whistles
comes back to the microphone
Tracy takes her seat next to Paul and glances at him
Paul scares straight ahead, a fat bead of sweat on his forehead
One of his legs is jiggling
The next candidate for student body president is Paul Metzier
Paul
Paul awkwardly makes his way to the mike
Though by no means thunderous, his applause clearly exceeds Tracy's
small cluster of jocks "woof" for him, shaking their fists in the air
Paul manages a weak grin for his buddies
Tracy shifts in her chair, her smile stiff and forced Lisa smiles and nods at Paul from the bleachers, giving him encouragement and a silent reminder to remember what they talked about
Tammy's eyes dart between Lisa and Paul
She shows no emotion, reveals nothing
The applause quickly dies, and after a moment Paul remembers to look at the white paper in his hand
He speaks in a barely audible monotone, never once glancing up
As many of you know  broke my leg pretty bad thi3 year and the experience has made me reevaluate what  want to do with my life and that is help people when you think about it a school is more than a school it's our second home where we spend all cur time and grow as individuals and a community but is our school everything it could be  want our school to reach its true potential that is why  am running for president
pinches the bridge of his nose, clearly pained few loud    saw through the air, and Walt points a stern finger at - you guessed it -- Doug Schenken
know what it is to fight hard and win like when we almost went to state last fall and  threw that fourth-quarter pass against Westside for the touchdown that won the game by three points won't let you down like  didn't then promise we can all score a winning (big breath) touchdown together
Vote Paul Metzier for president thank you
Paul now gets considerably less applause, but his jock friends remain loyal
Okay, Paul
Now our final candidate for President - another one of the Metzier clan -- sophomore Tammy Metzier
Tammy approaches the mike
There are scattered mocking whistles and catcalls
Tammy calmly looks over the crowd, waiting for the jeers to subside
She makes eye contact with Lisa, who stares back
People
People The room quiets down
Tammy puts her lips close to the mike, Who cares about this stupid election
there's something worth listening to
(') We all know it doesn't matter who gets elected president of Millard
You think it's going to change anything around here, make one single person happier or smarter or nicer
The only person it matters to is the one who gets elected
The same pathetic charade happens every year, and everyone makes the same pathetic promises just so they can put it on their transcripts to get into college
So vote for me, because don't even want to go to college, and don't care, and as president  won't do anything
The only promise  make is that if elected  will immediately dismantle the student government, so that none of us will ever have to sit through one of these stupid assemblies again
There is a sudden huge cathartic eruption of cheers and applause
Tammy has set them free
Even cynical old Doug Schenken and his buddies join in
Tammy
Tammy
Tammy
In total control, she steps back from the mike and
Walt shoots an angry, confused look at Jim, who shrugs
Tracy is clearly upset, but her smile remains eerily fixed Paul just looks confused and ashamed
Jerry Slavin is convulsed in laughter and chants along with the multitude
Tammy quickly grabs the mike for one final exhortation
0h don't vote for me   Who cares
Don't vote at all
The students go nuts
' Dr
Hendricks is in a serious post-assembly discussion with  and -
That little bitch made a fool of us want her out of the election
Getting everybody all riled up like that
She's finished, you hear me
Washed up
Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech
That's not what student government's about
(grumbling) Yeah
whatever
All  know is she's a troublemaker
She's on my list
All we need to do is send a message, so maybe we should just suspend her
Right
That's it
She's suspended for a week
To emphasize his point, Walt throws his   at the wastepaper basket and misses
Lowell the janitor, passing by outside the door, notices the cup bouncing on the floor
think that's a little strong Walt
Ron
We don't want to make a martyr out of her
Three days sounds right to me
Okay
Three days
Take care of it
Tammy rides her bike on this crisp sunny spring day
The music is buoyant
Tammy is all smiles
() Being suspended is like getting a paid vacation
Too bad it was only three days 7-11 Tammy is hanging out by the entrance
emerges from the store carrying a 12-pack of beer
En route to his car, he throws Tammy a pack of
Here you go
Tammy looks at the pack Hey --  said lights -- cigarette hanging out of her mouth, Tammy rides by the front of this Catholic girls' school
- Tammy gets off her bike, goes to look through the surrounding fence at in their cleats, short skirts, jerseys
accompanies - close-ups of the girls in action
Tammy seems to breathe them in '  -- Wearing headphones
Tammy  to music only  she can hear
She happens to glance toward her door and notices a sliding under it
She opens the door  and finds a startled Paul
What do you want
Oh
Hi, Tammy
was just, you know, went to all your teachers and got your assignments
Tammy looks at him, picks up the packet
(') just thought, well, last time you got suspended you fell so behind and - Okay, Paul
Thanks
Thanks a lot
Paul smiles at the acknowledgment of his good deed
(') Now could you leave me alone
Yeah
Oh, one more thing
Tammy
You know, all this election stuff
'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything
But that's okay, you know
l respect your privacy
just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings
We're still brother and sister
Okay
Cause
and  hope you feel the same
Sure, Paul
No hard feelings
Okay
Great
feel good
Paul is about to leave again but Oh
Oh
Yeah
Right
One other thing
Since you know Lisa so well, could you give me some advice
want to get her something for helping me with the election
You know, something really special -- like flowers or candy or flowers and candy
Or is that too typical
mean, can you think of something
Something really special
You know, something she'd really like
Tammy looks as though she'd like to push the button on all the world's atomic bombs
' "0" -- drawn on white paper
hand enters frame with a brush and begins to fill in the outline with blue tempera-paint
Camera  to reveal the "0" as part of a giant banner
Tracy is working on some letters, while   is working on others
() What happened at the speeches was an unconscienceable travesty
That little bitch Tammy Metzier wanted to make a fool out of me
Well, it wasn't going to work
People do care who wins
Things do matter
Finally, we're high enough to read: :
Eric, the "r" is supposed to be green, not blue
Oh
Okay
Eric carefully paints over his mistake, then works up  some courage
(') So, Tracy,  was wondering if after we finish with these you'd like to go to a movie or something
That's okay
'm too busy
Ouch
--   haggard Tracy sits alone at a computer monitor ( ') People are so ungrateful
If all those students who cheered for Tammy Metzier only knew how hard  worked for Millard

Suddenly, the cursor turns into a tiny  and drags Dave's dislodged head into the

( ') One of my duties was to clean up the group photos
It was a cinch with our new software
-- as Tracy outlines a piece of the  and places it in the void where Dave used to be, blurring the edges for a perfect effect,  voila
Satisfied, Tracy taps on the keyboard
(under her breath) Let's see
"save" is Command "
" Okay
-- Tracy is heading down the hall toward the exit when she rounds a corner and, suddenly deeply troubled, sees that "
"  has come loose on an upper corner and is drooping
Tracy puts down her things and  up to slap the corner back into place
Satisfied, she turns away
But then -
The banner fights back, peeling even further from the wall
Tracy prepares for battle
Tracy enters and grabs a long aluminum -
Standing on an overturned   and wielding the straight-edge, Tracy tries to smooth the banner
But she's not holding the ruler flat against the wall and --
-- she slices the banner lengthwise
Now the plastic garbage can begins to buckle
Struggling to retain her balance, Tracy accidentally hooks the banner and as she  yanks the whole thing down
Overcome with anger and frustration, she thrashes around on the ground and   what remains of her banner
smiles down at Tracy from his poster across the hall
Tracy looks up at it
Instantly she is on her feet, lunging for the poster
She jumps up,  it down, and  Paul's head into pieces
Blood issues from a thin paper cut on one hand
Tracy regards it at first without comprehending, then raises it to her mouth
While sucking her wound, her gaze falls on -- mocking her pain
Hurricane Tracy begins a savage assault on the fragile coast of Millard High
Paul's campaign posters fill the air, shredded to pieces by the powerful winds of jealousy and rage
-- to Tracy even farther down the hall, still jumping, still ripping
-    - where a thousand bits of Paul lie scattered -- a grinning mouth here, an eye there
finally to Tracy, sweating, panting
She finishes ripping a poster and looks to find another
But there are no more Paul posters: she has destroyed them all
Tracy raises her hands and sees they are streaked with Blood
' Tracy is at the sink, washing away the blood
She pats her hands dry with paper towels
The gravity of what she's done now sinks in, and she panics
didn't do this
didn't do it
She lifts the top off a garbage can, removes the
With frantic haste, Tracy stuffs the evidence of her awful deed into the garbage bag
-- Tracy's face is half-obscured by the bulging bag she carries down the sidewalk
- Tracy opens her  and heaves the garbage bag inside slamming the trunk, she looks around - no one
' Tracy drives, sucking on a wounded hand
She glances frequently in the rear-view mirror
Tracy's car drives down a
There are no sidewalks here, and the surroundings consist of scrubby vegetation and industrial structures
In the background looms a

She throws the car into reverse, backs up and turns onto - -- Tracy stop the car near an
She gets out and pulls the garbage bag from the trunk
With a big shove Tracy sends the bag cartwheeling down the hill Breathing hard but clearly relieved, Tracy watches the evidence of her deed tumble into obscurity
Tracy's shadowy figure runs back to the car
Tammy momentarily drops her  before raising them again
- Tracy's car speeds away
Tammy drops her binoculars and mounts her bike -- Tammy skids to a stop, drops her bike, and heads down the embankment
as Tammy draws near
She pauses at first, but intrepid curiosity conquers her fear
She unties the knot
we see Tammy's sudden look of '   smiles up at her
Tammy raises it toward camera -- as a hand extracts a huge    -- stringy, mucousy

No,

Yep
We'll let it run awhile turns off the faucet and reaches for a towel
Sherry offers him another
This one's clean

Sherry now stands very close to him sets the towel on the sink
It's a little awkward as they look into each other's eyes, standing so near
(') guess you'd better get to work huh
You're going to be late
She slowly wraps her arms around Jim's neck and pulls him to her, a hug of gratitude and warmth -- nothing sexual here, just the embrace of two people in need of shelter from the storm of life
No, nothing sexual at all
(') Thank you, Jim
Now sherry begins to cry a little, and things begin to change -- hands wander, cheek brushes cheek
Finally lips meet, tenderly at first
And then it is a deluge
and Sherry stumble in from the hallway locked in an embrace
They rove around the room, barely able to keep their balance
Finally, they fall to the ground

( ') So as you can imagine, my thoughts weren't on the election that Monday morning
takes a  from the shelf ( ') My thoughts were only on Sherry, on how perfect she felt inside
There was a special poem  wanted to read to her later, at the motel, as she lay next to me
Jim flips through the book and finds the poem he seeks
His lips move silently
'  ( ') Close, close the lovers keep
They stay together in their sleep
Close as two pages in a book That read each other in the dark
Suddenly -- a grating  from the loudspeakers

It's not fair
It's not fair Paul sits next to Lisa on the vinyl sofa
He wants to console her, but he doesn't know how
just don't think anybody would do something like that on purpose
It must have been some kind of mistake
Like a maintenance thing

Jim, where the hell have you been
Nowhere
don't have class until second period
Even tried you at home
We've got a situation here
If Paul loses tomorrow, it's not fair
There has to be another election,  with posters
What's the problem
Didn't you see
Somebody tore down their posters
Those posters cost a lot of money we don't have   There's no time to make any more posters, there's no -- We'll get to the bottom of it
(to Lisa) We still have some extra ones, don't we
Maybe we can just -- It was Tammy   That's who it was
Oh, no, hey
Like  said
Tammy wouldn't
she
Well, that speech she gave -- it was pretty, you know, pretty out there
But we'll get to the bottom of it
Don't you worry
Mr
McAllister is going to see to that
Right, Jim
(his thoughts elsewhere) Oh yeah, you bet
She should be expelled
Or worse
You two just go back and focus on your studies

() When  arrived at school that morning, was shocked to find that one of my key banners had been removed by vandals noticed that a few of my rival's posters had also been tampered with
Of course, was outraged, but one day before the election is not the time to lose your head over a couple of posters
When you're in the public eye, attacks like that just come with the territory
Finally she reaches the Upon seeing Tracy,   , the "They 're-all-my-kids office administrator, points wordlessly to an open door of a conference room

Tracy
Come on in
And shut the door behind you
She goes in and closes the door in our face
-- Tracy is seated in a chair
hovers above her, alternately leaning on a desk and pacing
guess you know why you're here If it's about the posters,  think it's so awful
It's a travesty
travesty
Huh
That's interesting, because  think you did it
Wait - are you accusing me
You're not serious
(indignant) can't
Mr
McAllister, we have worked together on  for three solid years and
mean,  can't believe it
'm
'm shocked
stares at her
(') Mr
,  am running on my qualifications
would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know
Plus, my own best banner was torn down
Did  do that too
Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend
was
So
Mr
Pecharda let me in
As you know, with all my responsibilities  often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so
But  left very early, around 6:30
6:30
How do you know what time the posters were torn down
don't
just know they were there when  left
'm giving you helpful information is all
You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this
Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it
Whom should we "interrogate
" well,  don't know
It could have been anybody
There are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around Millard
You know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck and those burn-outs
Or Doug Schenken - what about him
Or what about Tammy Metzier
Her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that
shifts gears You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy
You have many admirable qualities
But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that
And in the end, you're only cheating yourself
Why are you lecturing me
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake
think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences
You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand
don't know what you're referring to, but  do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay
agree
But  also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections
And  think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant
And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations
Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits
And if you want to keep questioning me like this,  won't continue without my attorney present
draws a long breath as he tries to control himself Okay, Tracy
Have it your way
There's a
and Tracy turn to see timidly poking her head in
You wanted to see me, Mr
Just wait outside
Tammy
Okay
But is this about the posters
Possibly
Please just wait outside
Okay
(looking at Tracy) Because  know who did it
So
'll just be outside
Tammy manages to squeeze in a naughty little smile before closing the door
Tammy sits patiently in a chair, bobbing to an unheard song
The door opens, and Tracy emerges
Tracy, don't go away
Come in, Tammy
As Tammy and Tracy cross, Tracy speaks in a low voice but loud enough for to hear
This ought to be good -- Tammy sits facing Jim, cradling her backpack
So
what do you have to tell me
Well, this is hard for me, but  think it's important to be honest
Don't you
(impatient) What is it
Tammy
'm the one
did it
tore down Paul's posters
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word

And when did you do it
This weekend

You don't know what it's like to grow up in the shadow of an older brother like Paul
it's always Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul
Never Tammy

You must be Paul's little sister
He's so perfect, and 'm so troubled

And 'm not sorry

Hendricks
He throws the door open

Tracy is frightened but still plays the indignant victim
Yes
Looks like today's your lucky day What does he mean
What do you mean
You're off the hook
Tammy here has confessed
It takes Tracy a second to figure out how to react
But once she's got it, she runs with it

That's enough, Tracy

In my heart  still can't believe she tore down my posters, but sometimes she does get so weird and angry
Please help her be a happier person, because she's so smart and sensitive, and  love her
Also, 'm nervous about the election tomorrow, and  guess  want to win and all, but  know that's totally up to You

It's election day, and how you vote will make a big difference in the activities, events, and perhaps even the policies of your school
Over the past few days or weeks, you've heard candidates for the various offices make their speeches and tell you where they stand
You've probably seen their posters
Maybe you've even had a chance to speak with them personally

Huh
Okay
Well,  guess 'd better do my count
Jim-scoops up the three piles of ballots and takes them to his desk

Tracy takes notes, but she is noticeably distracted
Right
And what year was that
1958
Almost
1957
So the point here is when we found out about Sputnik, we got really scared
It seemed like no matter what we had and kept secret, they could develop it too

And this time we were behind them
So -- February 1961, Kennedy tells Congress and the American people he wants to go to the moon
May 1961, the Apollo program is announced
Tracy just can't take it anymore
She abruptly stands up, takes the off the lip of the blackboard, and starts to leave
Mr
Flagg gives her a small nod
Tracy nears a room, a special room
She slows down and peeks in the window of the door
She sees -- sitting at the back of the classroom, staring front
Tracy presses her face to see what Larry is staring at -- at his desk counting ballots catches sight of Tracy in the window
crosses her fingers by her ears and gives a questioning look sneaks a guilty look at Jim, absorbed in his counting
Then, against his better judgment flashes Tracy a quick, furtive double -
suddenly disappears from the window
- Tracy pogos with unbridled joy () You know that moment when they announce the winner of a beauty pageant
When Miss Texas or whoever suddenly realizes she's Miss America, and all she can do is scream and weep and hug the losers

looks up and sees in the window, her face exploding with joy
She
We move closer to Jim in -
What actually occurs in a split-second is suspended in time ( ') The sight of Tracy at that moment affected me in a way  can't fully explain
Part of it was that she was spying, but mostly it was her face
Looking at her, you might think she was a sweet, innocent teenage girl
But she wasn't sweet
And she wasn't innocent
She was selfish and cynical and ambitious and thought nothing of destroying the lives of others to get to the top
who knew how high she would climb in life, how many people would suffer because of her
had to stop her now

Sorry
My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's

If you say so
Mostly Tammy fans See, it doesn't add up
There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted
Two votes are missing
Check the register
He's right
Two people must have pocketed their ballots

Dr
Hendricks, every vote was accounted for

We've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for , Treasurer and Secretary
Mr
Hendricks and  have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing - But, Mr

End of story

Paul seems a little overwhelmed by the whole thing
Tracy leans over and offers her hand
Paul,  just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign
It's been fun competing with you
Yeah, you too, Tracy
'm just glad it's over
Yeah
() You know,  don't understand why everybody bad-mouthed Tracy all the time
She was always super- nice to me

People
Once the winners are announced, we can all go home, okay
The students quiet down (') Some contests are so well fought that is seems unfair for someone to win and someone to lose
think that's the case with all the candidates you see before you today
All of them are highly qualified and embody the, uh, the integrity we expect from our school leadership
- Jim's voice momentarily recedes
() Act surprised
Walk slowly to the podium
Be modest
Thank them for this incredible honor
That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done
We'll begin with president

It's my pleasure to announce the next president of Millard High School
Tracy just can't wait
Smiling, she
Paul Metzier
The crowd breaks into applause -- and laughter -  she sits, her smile belies her horror and humiliation Paul begins his acceptance speech
We cut alternately to a thrilled Lisa; a stunned Tracy, tears forming at the corners of her eyes; and to , who watches the events with shifty eyes, his mouth dry and tasting of metal
Geez, you guys, thanks a lot
mean, wow, thanks
promise to do my best and really do a good job and be a good president
And  want to thank Lisa Flanagan for being a super campaign manager
And  just want to say that think Tracy would have made a great president too and that she really deserves a big hand
The auditorium erupts into applause and whistles, and  takes the microphone again
And now, for vice-president

You know, Paul just thinks the world of you
Oh, if you could just hear him
Yeah, say, apparently you've really come behind him, really helped him out there with the student council thing and all
never would have ran if it wasn't for Mr
Paul doesn't need any of my help
He's going places
You should be very proud
We are Having a problem with your eye there
Dick
Just a bee sting
You ought to get that looked at
Shot of cortisone or something
Thanks, 'll be fine
Anyway, we're awful sorry about what went on with our other one, you know, our Tammy
We were mortified
Oh, she's not a bad girl
She'll come around
but we've had some good talks, and think we're sorting things out
We're starting her at Sacred Heart in the fall
Good school
Say, you're all alone,  why don't you join us
Yeah
Oh, no
No
'm just finishing up here, and 've got to get home
(to his parents) Why don't you guys go sit down, okay
'll catch up in a minute
want to talk to Mr
about some important stuff
All right
Well, sure nice to meet you
So nice You bet
The Metziers go, and- Paul slides in across from Jim
So, Mr
,   was starting to think about ideas for next year
was thinking it would be cool to have, like a carnival
With rides
And, you know, it could be for, like
Muscular Dystrophy

(') And on Halloween we could have a haunted house
But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones
You know, more like the radio station ones
This one would be really scary
And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was - Paul
Paul
We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later whole year, in fact
Right now  just need to finish my pie and get home
Oh, okay
Yeah, sorry
The wind out of his sails, Paul gets up and is about to go when (') Just one more thing
So, Mr
, uh, do you think Tracy's going to be okay
saw her face after the assembly, and think she's taking it pretty hard
Don't worry about Tracy
She'll be fine
' - her face drained and pallid, her eyes red and bleary: she is exhausted from crying
One vote
one vote She falls again headlong again into the throes of despair
Her mouth contorts into a rictus of agony, and there issues an almost feral cry of pain
Her anguish grows convulsive
Barbara Flick comes in and sits on the bed
She's carrying a and a glass of milk
Why don't you take a couple of my pills, darling
You'll feel better
Tracy takes the pills and sips the milk weakly
Her mother kisses her
(') Don ' t worry
don ' t worry
sshhhhh
that's it, baby
that's it, darling
Everything's going to be fine
She lays Tracy on the bed, and Tracy begins to quiet
Barbara kisses her again and rises to leave
At  the door she pauses to add a few final words of comfort
(') Maybe you needed more posters, honey
Or if you'd taken my suggestions about your speech

The camera moves to peek in the kitchen window, from where we watch  and Diane but cannot make out anything they say
() don't know how Diane and  made it through that night, but we did
Our marriage had gone right to the brink, but in the end  guess it was saved by one simple fact: we truly loved each other
So we made a commitment to begin the painful process of piecing our lives back together
The worst was over; the mistakes of the past were behind us

We hear a distinctive rhythmic squeak, and a shadowy head appears in the window
Keys jingle
The door opens, and Lowell turns on the lights
He approaches the waste basket and slides it out

Then sit-ups

After all, what harm had really been done
No one was dead

Hi, Linda

Uh, Jim
Hmm
Walt needs to see you
Oh
Okay
Still absorbed in his papers,  heads over to Walt's door

Walt is not alone
Barbara Flick and a bleary-eyed Tracy are there
So are Larry Fouch, Ron Bell, and Lowell the janitor
Prominently displayed on Walt's desk are takes an eternal few seconds to absorb what is happening
Mr
McAllister,  hope you can help us clear something up
Look at his face
He knows he's been caught
Look at his face

You said  was a liar   You're the liar, you're the -- Larry, you just take it easy All turn and stare at Jim
Come to think of it, he does look awfully guilty

The class laughs fondly
Paul looks around, beaming with embarrassment and pride

Huh
Paul walks down the hall, a bounce in his step on this fine spring morning
Senor presidente
Yo soy senor presidente
El grande presidente
() don't know why, but finding out there was a mistake and  hadn't won the election after all didn't bother me that much
Winning had seemed kind of unreal anyway
guess  should have voted for myself
Oh, well
Paul reaches the -- and enters Walt's office
Everyone is there (standing up) Take a seat, son
We've got something hard to tell you
Is Tammy okay
She's okay
It's about the election
Walt closes the door in our faces
We hold on the door
() After Paul got the bad news, Walt asked for a few minutes alone with me
It was very simple, really
offered my resignation, and he accepted
Very quietly, it was all over for McAllister at Millard High - twelve years of hard work down the drain
The door opens revealing that only wait and  remain
The office staff is hushed as  the Zombie Cyclops emerges into the office and walks somberly toward Miss Boeder
His voice quavers at half-volume
Walt will be speaking with you about this, but  need you to find someone to take over my classes
The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer
Okay, Jim
understand
Thanks
Well
