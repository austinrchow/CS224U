Evil
Austin foiled Dr
Evil's plan to send a nuclear warhead to the center of the earth and banished him into space forever
Or so he thought
-  (    ) : - Elegant double doors with a brass plaque reading "Honeymoon Suite
"  "Do Not-Disturb" sign hangs from the handle
: Austin and Vanessa snuggle in bed
She plays with his chest hair
love you, Mr
Powers
And  love you, Mrs
Powers
: Austin gets out of bed
We see Vanessa putting on her robe from behind, and then : Austin and Vanessa kiss
Let's go out on the terrace
It's a beautiful night, we can look at the stars
: Austin and Vanessa gaze at the stars
Look how beautiful the night sky is
Isn't that the big dipper
Yeah, and that looks just like Uranus
Austin
(sheepish) Well, you know
Hey, 've never seen that big star before
Yeah, what is that
Austin pulls out his telescope and takes a look
'  - : The Bob's Big Boy rocket
' This isn't over yet, Mr
Powers have one more trick up my sleeve, don't  Mr
Bigglesworth
The frozen Mr
Bigglesworth
The Bob's Big Boy rocket
Suddenly, a hatch opens in Bob's rear end and Dr
Evil's silver egg capsule poops out
:
Capsule begins fiery re-entry to Earth Austin comes in and shuts the balcony door
Oh well,  guess it was nothing
crosses carrying a bouquet of flowers, which obscure her face
Care for some champagne
(pouring) Here's to monotony--  mean, monogamy
Vanessa sits at the vanity with her back turned
Hello
Vanessa
What are you doing, luv
(back turned) Just putting on my-- As Vanessa turns around she puts her hands up and revealing wires, transistors, and a speaker where her mouth should be
(computer voice) -
(frightened) Vanessa, you're a Fembot
They fight
Midway through the fight, machine guns pop out of Vanessa's breasts
Machine gun jubblies, how did  miss those
(robot voice) Her machine gun breasts , spraying the room in -
Then they run out of ammo and ,
Austin empties his gun into the robot, but to no avail
She rushes at him, he gives her a judo chop, also to no avail
Then Austin' notices a - switch and hits it
She starts to twitch, her head spins, and she
Fembot parts fly around the room
Austin sits on the bed, saddened
He holds Vanessa's hand, which has wires hanging out of it
On one of the fingers is her wedding ring
: (very sad) can't believe Vanessa, my bride, my one true love, the woman who taught me the beauty of sharing your whole life with another, the person who taught me the meaning of love, was a Fembot
How will  ever go on
(beat) Wait a tic
That means 'm single
Oh, behave
- Rich European guests mill about the luxurious lobby
Suddenly, Austin dances through naked
Just as we are about to see his bits and pieces, a man lifts up his suitcase
Yeah, baby, 'm free
'm naked and free
: Soul Bassanova by     Austin's body as he walks down a boardwalk
Just as the camera reaches that most sensitive of areas, a credit appears Austin gives a big 'who me
' and we - European types stare and point
We see Austin from behind
His bottom half is blocked by a bicycle
The bicycle moves away
Just as Austin's bum is about to be revealed- blocking it
Austin turns his head around to the camera and puts his hand to his mouth in an 'oh my
' take and we
flashes Austin, his thingy blocked by a credit
Austin just laughs
crazy, man
Austin goes around a corner
moment later he returns, followed by a
on the left side of the screen reads "Warning
Nude Beach"
Austin enters from the left
We see his naked, hairy torso from the waist up
Just as he is about to appear from behind the sign, a
Blocking his penis lengthwise as he walks

Austin lays on his back beside her, trying to be suave;    appears

Austin walks into frame; the " ' " disguises his growing interest

Shaguar, baby, yeah
on the chrome script on the grill: it reads "Shaguar" where it would normally read "Jaguar"
The car speeds off
On the stage we see a Klansman father and his Klansman son, a Nazi father and his Nazi son, and   all seated on a panel
Lower Third Chyron: " " If you just joined us, today's topic is "my father is evil and wants to take over the world"
Now, Bobby, you had something you wanted to share with your father before the break
Dad,  know you're against race mixing and all that, but  met someone
Don't say it
The crowd
met someone
and he's black
The crowd goes crazy
He
The Klansman holds his hooded head in his hands
Please welcome Tim
handsome Blair Underwood look-alike enters and hugs the Klansman's son
The crowd screams
Now Scott, tell us about your father
Share with us
Well he's the head of an evil organization that has aspirations for world domination
And where is your father right now
He's in outer space, like frozen in a giant egg and stuffed inside a Big Boy rocket with his cat, Mr
Bigglesworth
Really
Well, we have a surprise for you, Scott
Let's bring out ' father, Dr Evil
Dr Evil enters
Lower Third Chyron: "     " Hello Scott, 'm back
can't believe you'd do this to me on national television
They offered me a free makeover
Dr
Evil, we've seen a lot of the fathers here today open up to their sons, sons to the fathers
Is there anything you'd like to share
Share
Yes, don't you have any secrets
have a vestigial tail
Everyone is a little grossed out
It's more of a nub, really
The spine just goes on a little longer than it should
Also, 've dabbled
mean, perform fellatio once and you're a poet, twice and you're a homosexual
remember once  was being fisted by Sebastian Cabot- but here's where the story gets interesting
He was lactose-intolerant
He could eat red meat all night long, but one sip of milk and it was gastric hell
And remember we were caught in fragrance delicto by Henry Kissinger, and you can imagine my humiliation at having Hank hear me say, "Mr
French, no teeth
" One of my greatest disappointments is that  never became a song and dance man
could have been a quadruple threat, kind of like a despotic Ken Barry
Dancer, singer, actor, and  would possess nuclear weapons, the latter being the most threatening of the four once sat on a bus and tried to will myself a menstrual cycle
All  ended up with was a sense of failure and a mild neuralgia in my incisor teeth and perhaps a grudging respect for the weaker sex
love toe cleavage
For the most part  distrust dogs slept in a horse once
It was quite roomy
On second thought, it was the Ritz
named my left testicle 'piss' and my right testicle 'vinegar' wrote "It's Raining Men", or so the Christmas babies told me
Oh yes, also made a Marzipan voodoo effigy of The Fonze while  was in coma after smoking some Peruvian prayer hash, but who at the end of the day can honestly say they haven't done that
The Springer audience is stunned, slack-jawed and for once quiet
What are you, some kind of freak
Shut up, jagoff
Studio audience whoops at this
'll kick your ass punk
Crowd goes crazy
No one talks to my boy that way
Dr
Evil charges at Klansman and starts to bitch slap him
Security men, with headsets on, rush in to separate them
'm , 'm
There is a , then Dr
Evil  the guy again, knocking him down
Come Scott, let's go to daddy's new evil lair
- We pan up a modern office building
The camera reaches the top of the building and we see a giant   and the words: Starbucks World Headquarters
The penthouse boardroom is adorned with Starbucks paraphernalia: large logo, clear canisters full of beans, and a large world map with a little logo everywhere there is a Starbucks
Around a large table are Dr
Evil, Number Two (bandaged and lightly spotted with soot), Frau, Scott and a couple of Starbucks employee serves everyone steaming hot coffee products
Dr
Evil, as the legitimate frontman of your organization,  seized upon the opportunity to invest in a small Seattle-based coffee company several years ago
Today, Starbucks is a far- flung empire with 2000 outlets worldwide
Oh good, Number Two,  do enjoy a good cuppa joe
If  may continue,  believe if we shift our resources away from world domination and focus on providing premium quality coffee drinks, we can increase our gross profits fivefold
Dr
Evil takes a sip of cappuccino, leaving a on his upper lip
Right
Perhaps you've confused me with someone who gives a shit
Might remind you that  run the show here
demand a little respect
(indicating Dr
Evil's milk mustache) Dr
Evil,  think you-- Silence
will not tolerate your insolence
Remember what happened last time
(   ) Number Two disappears backwards into the fiery pit
Number Two smiles weakly, breaking into a sweat on his brow
May  add,  appreciate you reinstating me after our little
misunderstanding
Frau Farbissina
Wie gehts is einen
We see Frau
She looks a little more 'masculine' than before
Zehr gut, Herr Doctor
How are things
have come to embrace the love that dare not speak it's name
To my right is my lover
We see a severe-looking German woman with one continuous eyebrow
Her name is Unibrau
met her on the  Tour
Right on
Welcome, Unibrau
Dr
Evil takes another sip of cappuccino, making the frothy milk mustache even larger
Doctor, you have a 'milk mustache
' (wiping it off, embarrassed) Oh,  know
know
Dr
Evil, 'd like to introduce the Greek assassin, Oedipus
We see a swarthy Greek army guy
Welcome to my private army, Oedipus
Excited
could give a shit
Kiss your mother with that mouth
Yes
Of course you do
Dr Evil begins to press a button labelled "Oedipus" on his control panel, but Number Two interrupts
(clearing throat) Dr
Evil, as you know, the rate at which you liquidate henchmen far exceeds our ability to replace them
have so few pleasures left to me, Number Two
The key to life is to rotate your vices
One day it's executions, another day it's creamy French cheese
It's like frickin' heroin
Well, Dr
Evil, perhaps  have the answer
While you were frozen, we began a program to clone you
Cool
We had a few glitches, but  think you'll be pleased with the results
(shouting) Send in the clone
: dramatic sting We see the shadow of an approaching figure
The shadow looks like Dr
Evil, only much larger and scarier
He is identical to you in every way, except he is one-eighth your size
We see that the source of the shadow is a
, just like the creepy mini-Marlon Brando in The Island of Dr
Moreau
He mimics Dr
Evil's mannerisms including holding his tiny pinky to his tiny mouth
Breathtaking
shall call him Mini- Me
(to clone) Mini-Me, you will sit to my right
Mini-Me sits down in a miniature version of Dr
Evil's command chair
Come Mr
Bigglesworth
The bald Mr
Bigglesworth runs and jumps into Dr
Evil's lap
bald
jumps into Mini-Me's lap
Mini-me, something to eat
(expectant pause) No
(pause) (to room) Tired
Gentleman,  have a plan
As you know, the most powerful man in the world is the President of the United States
But he is just that- a man, subject to temptations of the flesh like any other man
Here's what we do: we make it seem that the President has had "extra-marital oral relations" with- and this is the kicker- ,
With a White House intern
Dr
Evil gloats
So does Mini-Me
(clearing his throat) Uh-hem
What, that already happened
Number Two nods
This is ri-goddamn-diculous
Oh well, how about a frickin' time machine
Does the president have a time machine
Have  been scooped on that
No, not that 'm aware of
Alright, time machine it is
As you know, every diabolical scheme 've hatched has been thwarted by Austin Powers
And why is that, ladies and gentlemen
Because you never kill him when you get the chance and you're a dope
Mini-Me hops upon the table and tries to push the "Scott Evil" button on Dr
Evil's control panel
Frau  him with a water bottle
Mini-Me glares at Scott and
No, because Austin Powers has "mojo"
Mojo
Yes, mojo
The mojo is the life force, the essence, the libido, the "right stuff"
It's what the French call a certain ' don't know what
' If you've got a time machine, why don't you just go back and kill Austin Powers when he's a baby or something
No, no, no
(interrupting) Dr
Evil, wouldn't it be easier to use your knowledge of the future to play the stock market
We could literally make trillions
(smug laugh to himself) Why make trillions when we could make
(pause) Billions
Excuse me
Why think small is all 'm saying
trillion is more than a billion, numb-nuts
Zip it
Unveil the time portal
wall panel opens to reveal a Stargate-like wall of shimmering energy
Ladies and gentlemen,  give you the time portal
As you know, Austin Powers was frozen in 1967
Therefore, time travel to 1969, two years after he was frozen
Security will be lax and 'll strike when he is totally helpless
First,  take Austin Powers' mojo
Then  begin my domination of the world
Can  come
No, Scott, Daddy has a score to settle
Austin Powers is the snake to my mongoose, or the mongoose to my snake
Either way it's bad, don't know animals
But  do know this: This time it's personal
Frau, Number 2, 'll see you both in 1969
Come, Mini-Me
Dr
Evil walks to the portal
Mini-Me follows, imitating him perfectly
They enter the portal
There is a   effect and they  , like in Star Trek
'   - Dr
Evil and Mini-Me emerge on the other side of the portal into a
It is a large hollowed-out volcano room dominated by chrome conduits and tasteful art pieces younger Frau sits with  , now played by   in an eye-patch
Ah, here we are Mini-Me, 1969
Number Two, you look very youthful and healthy
(turning to Frau) And Frau you look
right
As Dr
Evil walks to the center of the room, chairs rise from the floor
Everyone takes a seat, but Dr
Evil gets caught in the middle as chairs rise around him
He is frightened
One of the rising chairs hits him in the crotch
, people, we now officially have a chair problem
If another one of these chairs hits me in the nuts, 'm gonna go postal
Mini-Me,  want you to meet Number Two
Hello there
Mini-me says nothing
Mini-Me
Mini-me still says nothing
Shy
Low blood sugar
(to room) Gentlemen, Phase Two is beginning have an operative inside the Ministry of Defense
By this time tomorrow, Austin Powers' mojo will be mine
Dr
Evil goes over and looks out the large window
(maniacal laugh) Ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha
'   - We cut outside to see that window is in fact the left eye of a Mt
Rushmore-type depiction of Dr
Evil carved into the side of a volcano on a tropical island
(
) (maniacal laugh) Ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha
-    - We see Austin's   in cryogenic storage
Above it, we see two digital clocks
One reads: :  25, 1969, the other reads:  : 11, 1967
One of the  , is an (played by Mike Myers)
We've had reports that there's a spy in the Ministry of Defense
The contents of this room are vital to the country
Be on special alert
(thick Scottish accent) Those bastards will have to kill me before  let anything happen to this wee naked hairy popsicle, sir
Very good
And try and lose some weight for God's sake
They exchange salutes and the Colonel exits

The Fat Soldier begins to play the , a white vapor comes out of them, filling the room
The other soldiers , unconscious
He bores through the ice and pulls out a Sixties high-tech syringe type device with an  graph on the side
He places it in Austin's navel
The  meter goes from red to green, indicating

He is drinking a and listening to the Jag's in-dash
Suddenly Austin
The car starts to sputter
The fuel gauge reads empty
Gor blimey, 'm on empty
That's funny,  just filled the Shaguar up this morning
Austin hits a button on the dashboard
appears on the picture phone in the dash
(on picture phone) Hello, 'm Basil Exposition, head of British Intelligence
You always are, Basil
Listen, the weirdest thing just happened, 've run out of petrol
We'll send a man around immediately
How was your honeymoon
Vanessa tried to kill me, Basil
She was a Fembot
Ah women, who can understand them
Moving on, let's discuss your new case
New case
Very shagadelic, Basil
You'll be doing a photo shoot
We know that one of the models is an ex- agent selling top secret material to the highest bidder
That sounds easy enough, you know what they say: all work and no shagging makes Austin a dull boy, man
Austin sets up his photo equipment
The room is decorated in classic Heffner- bear skin rugs, leather chairs, roaring fire
(looking around) Tres chic, baby
, the photo assistant, enters
Austin, the models are ready
Ta, Reg
Bless your cotton socks
Hey, Reg, do you have any hobbies
What
Hobbies, man
for one enjoy making models
The models make their entrance
They are  , say  ,   and also one  we don't know
(circling Austin) It's him
Oh my God
It's Austin Powers
Austin shoots a look to Reg like 'still got it, baby
' One at a time, girls
One
At
Time
Hi, 'm Cindy
don't believe 've had the pleasure
Of course you haven't had "The Pleasure", we just met, baby, yeah
How do you do, Austin
'm Rebecca
(indicating the photo gear) Your equipment is quite impressive
Thank you
Your breasts are amazing
Austin comes to the unknown model
She is tall and angular
And what's your name, baby
(thick Russian accent) Ivana Humpalot
Excuse me
Ivana
Ivana Humpalot
And  vanna toilet made of solid gold but it's just not in the cards, now is it
Austin looks over the girls, trying to decide who is the spy
(
) (inner monologue) Now, which one is the Russian spy
Cindy Crawford, Rebecca Romajin
or Ivana Humpalot
Think, man, think
Austin begins snapping pictures
The sequence is shot like a photo shoot, with freeze frames, etc
Alright, baby
Love it
Turn and pout for me baby
Smashing
Cindy gets on all fours
Great, darling
Give me some shoulder
Yes, yes, yes
(angry) No
No

And
done
'm spent
Austin throws his camera to Reg, who catches it
Hel-lo, you forgot about Ivana
didn't forget, baby
Miss Humpalot and  are going to have a 'private session'
Reg shows the girls out as they
Austin and Ivana are left alone
Austin   and the lights dim
He again and the fire goes up
: 'm Never Going To Fall in Love Again by When did you get "The Clapper"
November, 1964, Dutch East Indies, shore leave
Are you cold, Mr
Powers
once had a bad experience with frostbite
had to dip my tadger into a brandy snifter
Ivana moves over to a chessboard set up nearby
Do you know how we keep warm in Russia
can guess, baby
We play chess
guessed wrong
It takes a keen intelligence to play chess
Of course, you know what they say about men with big brains, don't you
They wear large hats
No, they make better lovers
Wrong again
Ivana starts playing with the chess pieces sexily (like in The Thomas Crowne Affair)
assume you know how to play
She runs the bishop across her lips sexily
Of course
The
horsey
moves in an  shape
Austin tries to match her sexy moves and  on a piece
Let's stop playing games with each other
especially difficult ones
May  ask you a question, Miss Humpalot
Of course
Do  make you horny
Do
Austin rolls around on the polar bear rug
'll tell you anything you want to know, just make love to me
She pulls his shirt off, revealing his prodigious chest hair
You are hairy, like an animal
(growling and barking) Grrrr, baby
Austin takes the head of the bear skin rug
Grrrr
Ruf
Ruf
(covers the bear's eyes) Wait a tick,  don't want him watching me while 'm on the job
Make love to me, monkey man
Groovy, baby
We pan around the room, seeing all the stuffed and mounted wildlife who seem to be watching
Suddenly the camera stops
So does the music
(
) What's the matter
: - tall flower wilts and beds over
souffle falls
flag is lowered to half mast
giant redwood falls in a forest
hot air balloon deflates and falls
An actual scientific diagram of a penis in the refractory period
(to camera) Crikey, 've lost my mojo
( ) An ambulance races through the streets,
: "  " - Basil hurries through, pushing past  and
Where is he
In here
- Basil enters
Cross between a hospital room and a lab
Austin lies in bed hooked up to lots of monitoring equipment
Austin,  came as soon as  heard
There must be some kind of mistake, Basil
Maybe  was drunk and  didn't know it
Austin holds his neck very stiffly
What's wrong with your neck, Austin
(turning stiffly to face Basil) took a Viagra and it got caught in my throat
've had a stiff neck for hours
Basil, is it true
Have lost my mojo
We're going to run a few tests, Austin
Don't worry, old friend, we'll get to the bottom of this
Austin is being loaded into one of those big scary machines: the  9000
The mojo meter reads
(-): Technicians in white suits and masks transform the room into a love lair:  pair of Latex-gloved hands carefully puts a   record on a turntable
Examination lights are replaced with
tray is brought in with a videotape marked "
" Finally, the transformation is complete
Austin lies in bed reading a vintage
enters, very pretty, in a tight outfit
Excuse me, Mr
Powers,  need to give you a sponge bath before we begin the test
(not paying attention to her) Alright, miss, just let me finish this article on the Suez crisis
An  goes off
Bright  come on
Basil enters
What's going on
Alright, everyone, we're done
But the test hasn't even started
Agent Haggerty was the test, Austin
Not only were you actually reading an article in that Playboy, but a candy-stripe nurse offering to give you a sponge bath didn't so much as turn your head
Wait,  can explain, man
was going to shag her but the article was so fascinating-- 'm sorry, Austin, 'm afraid it's true: you've lost your mojo
Basil shows Austin the mojometer, which reads
(crushed) Without my mojo, 'm useless to the Ministry and to Her Majesty
think it's time to retire
'm afraid that's not possible, Austin
You see, Dr
Evil has returned
Again
Again
- - Austin and Basil ride on the back of a golf cart through the largest room you've ever seen in your life
We have evidence that Dr
Evil has developed a time machine
Basil shows Austin altered photos of Dr
Evil with famous villains, such as Sadam, Nixon, and Donald Trump
Our researcher noticed that these photos from the archives have changed
That means Dr
Evil is traveling back in time and creating alliances with each decade's most despised villains
Austin tries to read them and gets queasy
can't read in the car
get a bit vomy
Austin burps and swallows it
Got it
almost gipped
(
) Our data indicates that Dr
Evil is in the year 1969
Luckily, we also have a time travel device
After years of research we've developed a machine that will transport you back to the Sixties
bright overhead light comes on spotlighting a brand new , painted up psychedelic by Peter Max
But Basil, isn't that the new Volkswagen Beetle
That's what they'd like you to believe
So, Basil, if  travel back to 1969 and  was frozen in 1967,  could go look at my frozen self
But, if 'm still frozen in 1967, how could have been unthawed in the 90's and traveled back to the Sixties
(goes cross-eyed) Oh, no, 've gone cross-eyed
(to camera) suggest you don't worry about those things and just enjoy yourself
Austin gets into the car and turns it on
This is smashing Basil
'll go back to the Sixties, recharge my mojo, defeat Dr
Evil and be back in time for tea
Good luck, Austin
Luck has nothing to do with it, Basil
Austin steps on the gas
The car lurches in reverse and smashes some equipment
Sorry
(changing gears) Swinging Sixties, here  come, baby, yeah
The car takes off, heading for the wall
It , leaving flaming tread marks
: -  - The Beetle time machine appears out of nowhere and screeches to a stop
London  smoking a hukka watches
He throws the hukka down
Austin hops out
feel better already, man
Austin smiles and we see that his teeth are back to being He walks off as a crowd gathers around the car
- Austin enters the park in high spirits
We   to see that Austin is being watched through binoculars by a big to reveal a beautiful watching both of them
From this distance we can't tell who she is
sign reads "-  "
, , and  of all descriptions dance to the music of a
The band's name is on the drum kit: "
" Alright, baby, a swinging shin-dig
Austin gets into the dancing, quickly becoming the center of the scene
The lead singer of the band invites him on stage and hands him the microphone as the band starts a new song: "
" Austin begins singing and a choreographed musical number begins involving the outdoor crowd a la Bob Fosse's Sweet Charity or Hair

Hip-thrusting young   Fosse-hump rhythmically

' Three   behind Austin suddenly have tambourines for the big finale
The assassin and the mysterious woman are both in the audience, keeping an eye on Austin
All we see of the woman are shots of her , , and a (singing) -- Austin holds the note an improbably long time, arms outstretched
The dancers crouch-walk towards the camera

The   and all the dancers end up on one knee with their arms outstretched, panting
Austin breathes heavily and smiles smugly like Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance
We are   Austin's ass

She behind the binoculars hiding her face

Austin walks down the street looking at his new

The Beefeater salutes with his pike to a on a double-decker bus
The sexy ticket collector signals a
The taxi driver nods back to the assassin as he drives by
The assassin gets the signal and starts the car
The whole nodding sequence was a circular waste of time
- Austin walks along
Suddenly, he sees the Citroen coming at him
He dives out of the way and takes off running
He rounds a corner and pretends to be a    against a wall by hugging himself
The assassin sees him and slams on the brakes
He raises his gun
Austin turns as he hears a car
It's Austin's
The mysterious woman steps out
We see her in her entirety for the first time, and what a sight it is
She has long auburn hair and wears a tight racing suit, unzipped just enough to show the female symbol medallion
She is
: ' Care for a ride
That's my Beetle, baby
It was your Beetle
Get in
Austin dives in as the assassin
The car speeds off
( ) Felicity drives expertly
Austin Powers,  presume
Powers by name, Powers by reputation
Felicity Shagwell,
Shagwell by name, Shag-very-Well by reputation
(turning to camera) Crazy, baby
The Beetle zips along, and then-- the Citroen appears behind it
The assassin
Felicity turns around to look
Grab the wheel, would you
Austin grabs the wheel and Felicity pulls a gun
She turns and  out the window
The assassin's tire
The car skids towards a Cliff and he jumps out as it goes over
The car goes over and tumbles down the cliff, bouncing three times before it
The assassin hangs on to a branch with one hand
He falls
Ahhhhhhhh
Same shot as the car: The assassin's body goes over and tumbles down the cliff, bouncing three times before it, too, Well, Austin,  think this time you may have met your match
Oh, 've beaten Dr
Evil before, and 'll beat him again
was talking about me
She smiles, turns, and walks away
' The room is dark, with only a single spotlight providing illumination
Suddenly, Austin and Felicity rise on an elevator into the middle of the spotlight
Welcome to my shag pad, baby
Light floods the pad, revealing hanging basket chairs, Hi- fi, and Warhol silk screens of Austin
Austin blows  off a table
Care for something to drink
Austin hits a button and a bookcase revolves to reveal a wetbar
Or perhaps something to read
Austin walks seductively over to the real wetbar and hits a button
It revolves to reveal a bookcase
How about a hot cup of coffee
Yes,  rather fancy a grind
Oh, Behave
Austin hits a button and an automatic coffee-pourer pours a cup
: Girl from Impenema by Would you like a
mas-sage sensssual mas-sage
Austin hits a button and a series of actions take place: the floor opens up to reveal a sunken bed; red gels slide into place over the lamps; a painting slides back to reveal a reel-to-reel; an end table revolves to reveal a selection of massage oils
Felicity lies on her stomach
Austin begins to massage her
How does that feel, baby
Mmm, lower
(lowering his voice) ,
They laugh
Austin continues to massage her
Wait, something's itching me
She reaches behind her and unties the strap of her evening dress, revealing her naked back
That's better
Crikey
Austin  and accidentally spurts way too much oil on her
Sorry
Austin continues the back rub and Felicity stretches out on the bed
(talking to his crotch) Hello, anyone home
'mon lads, do it for England
Austin takes a peak-- nothing
He is panicked
Oh, that was so relaxing
Felicity stretches very sexily
Would you 'like to see my etchings
(sexy) think 'm ready for bed
She moves close to Austin
He slides to the other side of the bed
'll get you some PJs
No, 'm ready for bed
She moves over to him
He avoids her
Oh, you'll want to clean your teeth then
Austin holds up toothpaste and toothbrush
Felicity finally grabs him and pins him to the bed
No,  want to have sex with you, Austin
Hello Vicar
've studied everything about you- your methods, your accomplishments, your preferences
You're the reason became a spy
Now, 've waited two years to meet you, so  say we get busy making up for lost time
Austin sits up
(reflective) Felicity,  used to think that way, too, but  guess
guess 've changed
Not to make a short story long, or to ramble on and on, or to keep talking in a repetitive manner ad infinitum until it becomes impossible to remember what  was talking about in the first place, but- where was
: Oh yes
Felicity,  can't shag you
've lost my mojo
(obviously disappointed) Oh
thought coming back to the Sixties would bring it back, but it hasn't
Austin, don't worry
know just the man to help you
He's my guru
Ringo recommended him and he's the best
'll warm up the Jumbo Jet, baby
' Austin's plane in flight
- / Austin and Felicity drive against obvious rear screen projection of India
It looks like a mosque, with incense, tapestries, and Austin and Felicity enter
: There he is
That's my guru
We see the   (played by Mike), an Indian man in a bright red sari
Guru, 'd like you to meet Austin Powers
How are you baby
My chakras are aligned and  am in a perfect state of equipoise
Good on ya
don't know what that means but it sounds fab
Guru, we need some advice
Hold your horses and any other beasts- of burden
must lead my disciples in meditation and then  will help you
The Guru walks to the front of the room and the disciples sink to their knees
Ahhhhhh
My name is the Guru Pitka
am a spiritual teacher and  have combined many disparate disciplines into a unified movement of human potentiality and equipoise that  learned from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who died mysteriously of a disease that strangely had all the hallmarks of syphilis
He would say to me, Sparky, love is all, life is breath
Ahhhhhh
Now, perhaps you are wondering where got the nickname Sparky
Well, when we were young we used to play a game called "Stinkmop"
We would urinate into a bucket, dip a mop into it, and play tag
did not care for "Stinkmop" and a very wise old man said to me 'oh lighten up, Sparky', and  don't know, the name kind of stuck
Ahhhhhhhh
Now, the reason  am a spiritualist instead of a therapist is that 'therapist' often becomes 'the rapist' and that will not help us attain potentiality
Now what is potentiality
It is the ability to achieve those goals that we wish to achieve for ourselves
People often say to me that they feel "nowhere", and  am going to change that to "Now here
" The guru holds up a card which says " =
" Ahhhhhhh
And you have many assumptions about your goals, but when you "assume" You make an "ass" out of "u" and "me"
Guru holds up a card which says " =  -  -
" Ahhhhhhh
The being, or that which we call 'ourselves', is not the tinker
It is not the taughts
It is the Gap between the tinker and the taughts
We are not our mind, we are not our body, we are the Gap
Guru holds up a card that says " ,  , " with the familiar Gap font
Ahhhhh
(rapid fire) The heart of the matter is that you are the heart of the matter
There is no "" in "team"
Beer before liquor, never sicker
Don't take a wooden nickel
If your pipe is short and your pump is weak, you better stand close or you'll piss on your feet
He who goes to bed with itchy bum wakes up with smelly finger
Ahhhhh
Finally, the path to spiritual awakening requires the death of ego
Leggo of my ego
Let us end with the mantra: Om Ay Vant Yu Uh
Mo Ay Vant Yu Uh
Mo Ay Vant Yu Hu
(chanting) Om Ay Vant Yu Uh
Mo Ay Vant Yu Uh
Mo Ay Vant Yu Hu
The Guru takes a swig of Yoo-Hoo
Go with God, and pay at the door please
The disciples file out
Austin and Felicity approach
How can  help you
Guru, 'm having trouble performing
What do you mean
You know- my bits and pieces are a bit sleepy
'm not understanding
've forgotten the steps to the Mummy- Daddy dance
Still not clear
My flag's at half mast and no one will salute it
Sorry
My Willie don't work
Why are you beating around the bush
That's my problem
Ohhhhh,  get it
(beat) No,  don't get it
He's impotent
Alright, easy
(to Guru) Felicity and  were all set for some hump Olympics and  couldn't bat for six
Oh, yes,  see
You have no idea what 'm saying, do you
Not a word
Guru, 've lost my mojo
Oh, mojo
You should have said so
Well, you've lost your mojo because your chakras are misaligned
You have lost love
Lost love
Oh, you mean Vanessa
Who's Vanessa
She was an evil robot minion of Dr
Evil
couldn't have loved her
Denial ain't just a river in Egypt, buddy
You will only get your mojo back when you surround yourself with love
Oh,  get what you're saying now
He's talking about free love, baby
Tune in, turn on, and drop out
am talking about true love
You must stay and study until you are worthy
No way, man
The only way to surround yourself with love is to throw a swinging shin-dig
Yeah, baby, yeah
' Dr
Evil and Frau are interrupted by the man we now know as He is foul-mouthed, and when he swears he is bleeped
Well done, Fat Bastard
May  have the mojo
First things first, where's your shitter
've gotta bleepin, turtle head pokin' out
(disgusted) Right
Charming
Fat Bastard- you don't mind me calling you Fat Bastard do you
've got a lot of demons kickin' around in my noggin, but weight issues ain't one of them
Alright, Fatty- The name is Fat Bastard
'm the incorrect weight for my height and was born out of wedlock, hence the moniker Fat Bastard
Hey, 'm not kiddin'
've got a crap on deck that could choke a donkey
Fat Bastard, the mojo
Where's my (bleeping) money
gentlemen never discusses money
Fine, you can take your (bleep)in' money and shove it up your (bleep), you stupid (bleeping) prick
While you're at it you can suck my greasy, two-toned (bleep)
(pause) Vulgarity is no substitute for wit
(Bleep) you
Right
Bring in the money
Dr
Evil    drive in a forklift loaded with gold bars
Alright, here it is
Fat Bastard slowly draws out the high-tech syringe full of Dr
Evil is mesmerized
Mini-Me, fetch
Mini-Me runs and snatches the mojo from Fat Bastard and gives it to Dr
Evil, who caresses it and places it on a enters
Dr
Evil,  have some bad news
Austin Powers is back in the Sixties
One of our best assassins spotted him but he got away
This is ri-goddamn-diculous, we have his mojo
There is another
Felicity Shagwell, Suddenly, Scott Evil enters through
Scott, what are you doing here
don't know,  was sitting around watching the tube and The Courtship of Eddie's Father came on Nick at Nite, you know, and  was just listening to that theme song-- (hums/sings the theme) Anyway it made me think that maybe we could try and work things out
You know, you are my Dad and  need you
You had your chance, Scott
already have someone created in my image
He's evil, he wants to take over the world, and he fits easily into most overhead storage bins
(looking around) Has anyone seen Mini-Me
(calling out) Mini-Me
Mini-Mouse
Mini-Driver
Hello
Mini Pearl
Can we put a frickin' bell on him or something
Scott, very hurt, sits back in his chair and sulks
Dr
Evil hits a button and a model moon and a model earth descend
Gentlemen, phase three
We place a giant laser on the moon
Let me demonstrate
(beat) Where's my laser
Dr
Evil looks around and sees Mini-Me gnawing on the model laser
Dr
Evil takes it from his mouth Mini-Me, don't chew my laser
(to room) Not feeling well
He has an ear infection, but tit's
(pause) No
Nothing
(back to model) Anyway, the laser is powerful enough to destroy every city on the planet at will
We'll turn the moon into what  like to call a "Death Star"
Scott
What
(snickering again) Nothing Darth
What did you call me
Nothing
(pretends to sneeze) Rip-off
(unsure) Bless you
Anyways, since my "death star" laser was invented by the noted Cambridge physicist, Dr
Parsons thought we'd name it in his honor-- the Alan Parsons Project
Scott  again
What now
The Alan Parsons Project was a progressive rock band from 1982
Why don't you just name it Operation Wang Chung, ass
(indicating laser) When you get your own evil empire, you can call it whatever you want
Gentlemen, allow me to demonstrate the awesome lethality of the Alan Parsons Project
Fire the laser
: giant laser beam smashes down through the roof of the White House, causing it to explode
Everyone is shocked by the laser's power
My God, Dr
Evil, you destroyed the Wihite House with no warning
Actually, that was just footage from the 1996 blockbuster motion Picture Independence Day, but it would be a lot like that
What do you think, Scott
Yeah, Codename: Thompson Twins was really impressive
Shhhh
'm nineteen,  don't- Shh
Shh-Shh
Shh-Shhhhhh-Shh
Shh- shh
It's Morse code
(reading imaginary paper) Let me decipher
it says 'shhhhh
' You are so lame- (like Electric Company) Ssssss
huuuuuh
Shhhhh
Dr
Evil, what are we going to do about Powers
Fat Bastard, in addition to being extremely rotund, you're a vicious killer
Take care of it
It'll be my pleasure
It's an easy job
Without his mojo, Powers will be
powerless
'  - party, packed with dancing freaks of every stripe, is in full swing
girl dances in an oversized birdcage
This shag-in is gonna blow your mind, baby, yeah
The party sequence is shot like Laugh-In
Very fast cuts to the music
Austin sees a    drinking a martini and smoking
He gently lifts her drink and cigarette away from her
Hey
You'll thank me later, baby
Another angle
Austin and Felicity dancing
(noticing someone) Hey
Ricardo Monteblan, how are you
We see   -smoking a hukka on a round chair
Hello, Austin
Balls, said the queen and the king laughed because he had too
(to camera) Crazy, man
Let's split up and scope the scene
Don't do anything  wouldn't do- at least not without me
Felicity slaps Austin on the butt as he walks off
Oh, behave
: Austin at the bar with an exotic-looking mod chick
(to chick) You're very exotic, baby
Do you have a little English in you
No
Would you like to
: An Alan Zeus-type very gay guy
(rolling his eyes) This is ridiculous
: and Felicity are on hanging chairs
Have you ever been picked up by the fuzz
No, but  bet it really hurts
: on a tricycle, shot undercranked, rides through the party and falls over
: Austin pops into frame with a book that says " "
The Austin Powers Sexy Dictionary defines an Eskimo hooker as a frosty prosty
: An eskimo at the bar in a fur parka
(to camera) don't get it
: The camera pans up Felicity's cool hip-huggers, which are very tight
Those are skin tight
How do you get into those pants, baby
Well you can start by buying me a drink
Austin does a spit take
: Felicity with a
You were great last night
By the way, 'm Thor
You're Thor
'm tho thor  can hardly thit
: Austin is wearing a silly spiked German helmet like in Hogan's Heroes
(German accent) Hello,  am Baron Von Firstinbed
Last night  had German-Chinese food
An hour later  was hungry- for power
: Oh puh-leez, why don't you take a handful of -off pills
: Did you hear about the contortionist who was engaged to be married
Yeah,  heard she broke it off
: Film running backwards of Austin doing a spit take
: in German helmet behind a plant
Verrrrry interesting- but shtupid
: Austin takes his glasses off to clean them
We see his , which is totally fuzzy
He looks over and sees what appears to be a  - two round globes and dark triangle
Austin puts his glasses on and looks again
It is actually a girl in a flesh-colored dress
In between her and Austin were two    and a triangular martini glass filled with a Cosmopolitan
: Cut to Austin and Felicity together again
Look at that
She points to where Fat Bastard and his companion are standing
That's not a pretty sight
Who is he
Until recently he worked security for the , but we think he might be a double agent, possibly for Dr
Evil
How do you know
We've noticed that his lifestyle has changed dramatically
He's made a lot of cash purchases, he's hanging out with foxes half his age, and he's becomes quite a fixture on the London party circuit
Who's the girl
don't know, but it looks like he's splitting
Fat Bastard exits
'll follow him
You see what you can get out of the girl
We'll rendezvous later
Felicity follows Fat Bastard out the door
Austin makes his way over to the girl
Hello, hello
Hello, Mr
Powers
Fab party
Who are you today, baby
Robin
Robin Swallows
Swallows
That's an interesting name
Are you English
German, actually
My maiden name is Spitz
Well which is it, baby, Spitz or Swallows
Either way, it's a pleasure
The pleasure is mine
She extends her hand
Austin takes it and shakes
As he shakes, her cleavage undulates like jello
Austin is transfixed and keeps shaking far too long
Charmed, 'm sure
(still shaking, her breasts jiggle) How do you do
(still shaking, jiggling) Yes, quite
(shakes, jiggles) always enjoy meeting new people
(shakes, jiggles) How's your mum
Good
(shakes, jiggles) love shaking hands
Austin
is shaking her hand so vigorously that she is in danger of popping out of her dress
(snapping out of it) So, who was your friend
His name is Fat Bastard
It suits him
He's my lover
Austin is grossed out
Would you happen to know if he's in business with a man named Mr
Evil
don't know anyone named Dr
Evil
Really
said Mister Evil
Austin does a smug take
Something to drink
Would you like a Mister Pepper
Yes, 'd love a Doctor Pepper
Really
said Mister Pepper
Austin does another smug take
Robin grabs Austin and pulls him close
You're a groovy boy, 'd like to strap you on sometime
Oh, behave
: - Meanwhile
: - Literally a window in a wall
Fat Bastard is placing his order
and 'll have a fried-prawn sandwich, with extra mayonnaise, two whole chickens, a kidney pie, a toad in the hole, bubble and squeak, bangers and mash, 3 orders of fish and chips, and
a Fresca
No ice
We pan to see Felicity beside him
love a man with a large appetite
And  love a woman with big (bleeps), so let's shut up and get to (bleep)ing
Felicity swallows hard and forces a smile
'  - Can  ask you a question
Yes
Thank you
Beat
Well, what's the question
Oh, yes
Would you like to shag
Would you
'd love to, Mr
Powers, just come right
over
here
Robin moves Austin into place as they dance
You're a bit of alright
Just then, Austin looks into her eyes and sees the (Oedipus) about to throw a knife
Just as he throws it, Austin spins Robin Swallows around and She takes the knife squarely in the back
(strained) Oedipus
use the revolver
Oedipus pulls out a pistol and begins
Austin continues to use Robin
She takes six hits
Oedipus runs out of bullets
(strained) Oedipus
use the machine gun
Oedipus pulls out a machine gun and
In a Robert Rodriquez- like flurry of events, Austin dodges while still Oedipus throws down his gun and charges Austin
Austin uses Robin's body to block Oedipus's head butt, but his momentum pushes all three of them through a    of his second story loft
- As they fall, Austin turns Robin around so that she is between him and the ground
They land with a
Robin cushions Austin's fall
Oedipus is dead on the pavement
Oedipus, Oedipus
Sorry baby, too late
He's as dead as vaudeville
You can't win, Powers
Dr
Evil has your mojo and it's only a matter of time before he kills you and takes over the world
(weak) Tell Fat Bastard 'll miss him
: - Felicity is in bed, naked under the sheets, smoking a cigarette
We hear strange sounds offstage
We pan over to reveal she's
He is eating a huge turkey leg, his face covered in food
always get (bleep)in' hungry after get my end away
never would have thought that a man of such tremendous girth could be such a, um, creative and sensuous lover
You want some chicken
have more
He rolls over to reveal his
Felicity takes a homing device out of her purse, looks around for a place to plant it
She sees his enormous butt cleavage and realizes that there's only one place for the thing to go
on  ' face
He is delighted
Frisky are we
Alright lets have another go
She is horrified
'   - Dr
Evil at his table with Frau, Scott, and Number Two
Get me the President of the United States
The  appears on Dr
Evil's video screen with his behind him
( ) Dr
Evil, what do you want
Not what  want Mr
President, but will receive
In 12 hours  will destroy Washington,  with a giant laser
Dr
Evil reveals a giant laser
Mini-Me is humping it like a dog
, Mini-Me, why don't you and the laser get a frickin' room
Honestly
(to President) will destroy another major city every hour- that is, unless you pay me- One hundred billion dollars
The President and his advisors
Dr
Evil that's more than the entire federal budget for 1969
Don't play games with me
The capitol will disappear if  don't receive One hundred billion dollars
His advisors
That much money simply doesn't exist
don't think l00 billion is even a number
It's like saying  want a kajillion bajillion dollars
His advisors
Come on, Mr
President
: "Show me the money
" Dr
Evil looks around smugly
No one laughs
What
: "Show me the money
" He looks around again, expectantly
'm sorry,  don't understand
You know, kwan
Show me the money
No
Nothing
It's 1969
That movie won't come out for another 30 years, ass
They don't know what you're talking about
Right
, see if you understand this: give me the money or 'm going to blow you to frickin' bits,
The President and his advisors
But- (making 'stop' gesture) Talk to the hand
Dr
Evil signs off
(to Scott) did love that, though
Cuba Gooding Jr
was outstanding
Oscar speech, very touching
Scott looks at him with disgust
Okay, everybody clear the room
Everyone leaves and he walks over to a panel bearing his logo
He presses a button, the panel opens up to reveal In it we see a huge full-length photo of Austin Powers, and various magazine covers
He presses a button and an Austin wig descends from the ceiling landing perfectly on his bald head
backless mockup of Austin's suit rises from the floor
He puts on a pair of glasses
He has become Austin Powers
Dr
Evil cautiously tastes the mojo
Yeah, baby
Very shagedelic
(beat) This isn't working
don't feel anything
We   towards Dr
Evil's head
: Yellow Submarine-like depiction of Dr
Evil
Zoom in on his head which explodes into 30 other small Dr
Evil heads which rain on a Peter Max-ian valley of flowers
The flowers sprout the word "'
psychedelic flying Austin head with spirals in the glasses smashes the flowers, changing the words from "" to "" and to "" and then to ""
Turn-of-the-century fat cat capitalists on stilts with teeth coming out of their stomachs drop penis rockets that have the word "" written on the shaft, smashing the "" flowers into "" which sprouts into "" which turns into submarines, which becomes yellow penises of huge, goose- stepping Dr
Evils, each of them peeing, creating a rain of urine that falls on the Peter Max-ian valley of a hundred Austin Powers citizens
They each open an umbrella that says "   "
The urine turns into a stream that flows into the mouth of a huge head of Dr
Evil
: '   - Pull back from Dr
Evil's head
He looks dazed and confused
Just then, Number Two re-enters the room, catching Dr
Evil with all his Austin paraphernalia
Dr
Evil, one last thing
-- oh
was just
right
Would it kill you to frickin' knock
/
- Austin and Felicity walk along the street
Austin, tell me about the Nineties
You know  can't tell you details about the future, baby, it could alter history
Not details, just what it's like
You know, what's the scene
Where's it at
There've been a lot of advances in the Nineties, baby
The economy is stable, people take better care of their health concern for the environment is on the rise and, um, let's see, there's an entire television channel dedicated to golf
Sounds awful
It's not so bad once you get used to it
The Nineties are about responsibility
You know, having respect for yourself and other people
even got married
You
Married
What about the sexual revolution
Well, it turns out there were some casualties, baby
Don't you think you'll ever get married
No, not until  get a little more 'experience' under my belt
Oh, behave
Suddenly Austin notices something outside and puts his hand to his mouth in fear
(wide-eyed) Oh my God
Felicity is immediately on her guard
She pulls her gun
(looking around) What is it
Is it Fat Bastard
No, written here on my hand, see
Austin turns his hand around to show her
He has written 'oh my God' on his hand with the pen
Says 'Oh my God
' They laugh
Austin, look
Austin and Felicity duck into a   and come out an instant later with -8
They run down the street filming each other
- -8 This is a Richard Lester-like sequence shot on grainy film from Austin and Felicity's POVs
There's lots of   stuff and     of frame like the   show
Felicity,  haven't had this much fun since  worked undercover in Amsterdam-- '66  think it was
1965, actually
You posed as a Dutch cheese expert to stop Dr
Evil from poisoning the world's water supply
Austin is impressed
've studied your file, Austin want to be a trailblazer, just like you
The Seventies are right around the corner
It's going to be a glorious time for fashion and music and technology-- it won't be long before every flying car has its own 8-track
Austin starts to say something, then bites his tongue
The  has always been a boy's club until now
Well move over, this chick's taking over
(hoarse) Very impressive
Austin, your voice
Yes,  think 'm coming down with something
Austin and Felicity stop at an    with his pushcart
'll get some ice cream
Would you like some
No thanks
(hoarse, to ice cream man) Could  have two scoops of Vanilla, please
Right away, governor
Would you like chocolate syrup
(hoarse) Yes, please
Will you have any whipped cream
(hoarse) will, thank you
@ Candy sprinkles
(hoarse) Yes please
Crushed nuts
No, laryngitis
Here's your change, sir
Oh, and Austin-- We cut back to the    to see him pulling off a very fake beard
It is  (though it was clearly another actor before)
(now with phlegmy throat) Basil
Hello, Austin
What's wrong with your voice
(still phlegmy throat) just had ice cream
Listen to me, have dairy throat
"Mary had a little lamb and it was always gruntin'
She tied it to a five bar gate and kicked it's little- (Interrupting) Austin
Things are heating up, so thought it best to contact you in disguise
Felicity, your plan worked
You and Austin track Fat Bastard back to Dr
Evil
But how can we track Fat Bastard
planted a homing device on him last night
Yes, and we're starting to pick up the signal now
Basil hands Felicity a tracking device that
How did you get close enough to plant a homing device
shagged him,  shagged him rotten
Austin and Basil are confused and grossed out at the same time
You
him
Just like that
Yes, Austin, we needed that information
Well, thanks to your effort, Felicity, we now know that- (interrupting, to Felicity) Did you use an elaborate set of pulleys
block and tackle
Anyway, you two follow the signal back to Dr
Evil's headquarters and then- (interrupting, to Felicity) just can't get my head around it, baby
You're so small and he's so not small
The sheer mechanics of it are mindboggling
Never mind, Austin, you two have work to do
You must find Dr
Evil
We hear the - of the tracking screen built into the dash
got it
Chinese basket with a counter-weighted ballast
That's how you did it, right
Austin, it almost sounds like you're jealous
Who, me
That's not possible, baby
(beat, to himself) is it
Just then a-car pulls beside them
Two Dr
Evil Private Army guys pull machine guns and start
Get down
Felicity ducks
Austin reaches back and pulls from the back seat and
We're obviously on the right track
(re: tracking screen) It looks like Fat Bastard is-on an island in the middle of the ocean
' We hear the - of the tracking screen
-
'  - The Beetle comes from under the water and lands on the beach
We still hear the -
-  - Austin and Felicity have set up a tent with a view of the Dr
Evil Mt
Rushmore face
Austin is looking at the mountain through a pair of binoculars which hang around his neck
According to the readings, Dr
Evil's headquarters is over the next ridge
Can  have a look
Sure
Austin hands her the binoculars
Unfortunately the strap is still around his neck, pulling his face into her cleavage
Question is, how do we get in
(muffled) Mmmmmmm
mmmmm
Austin, did you hear me
seem to be stuck in your dirty pillows
Where are the topographical maps that Basil drew up
think they're in the tent
He and Felicity enter the tent
is on inside casting shadows of Austin and Felicity on the side of the tent
From the outside it appears the shadow Austin is leaning over with his back to-the shadow Felicity, who appears to have her hands up his butt
(
) Have you got it out yet
(
) Good Lord, Austin, what sort of things do you put in there
The shadow Felicity appears to be tugging a string of sausage links from his ass
(
) Oh, anything that catches my fancy
(
) How do you manage to fit it all in
(
) Oh, it stretches to fit
The shadow Felicity appears to pull a tennis racket out of Austin's ass
(
) Are you almost done
can't hold it much longer
We see that Austin is leaned over holding part of the tent
Felicity is rummaging through a duffel bag across the tent
Here we go, one hammer
It's amazing how much this duffel bag will hold
' We see Dr
Evil playing a piano
We pan to see Mini-Me on top of the piano, himself playing a miniature baby grand
(singing) '
' We see that Number Two and Frau are the audience
They applaud
Dr
Evil, that was fantastic, but do have some bad news
Powers' is on the island
How tedious
Don't worry, Dr
Evil, we can get to him by using the girl
Really
have the perfect weapon
Frau
(shouting) Bring in the He-Bots
: It's Rainina Men by   Three - enter in unison
They are robotic studs in Logan's Run type outfits
Dr
Evil, may  present the He-Bots
What kind of woman could resist these perfect specimens of masculinity
Their clothes are stylish, their posture is ramrod straight, and their buttocks are tight, like tigers
And, each He-Bot is armed with a secret weapon
-
nozzle flips up from his codpiece and white smoke pours out
(
) Poison gas
-
gun barrel flips out form his crotch and  machine-gun style
(
) Machine gun
-
nozzle flips up from his crotch and yellow liquid drizzles out onto the floor, where it smokes
(
) And deadly acid
Dr
Evil is disgusted by the last one
Right
object to the last one on aesthetic grounds, but  don't care how you get Powers, just bring him to me
(to Mini-Me) Ready Mini-Me
one and a two and
(singing) ,   - -- (rapidly) '  , ' ' (dancing in step) ,   -     - - (voice unnaturally low) We see the shadows again
It now looks like Felicity is putting things into Austin's ass
(
) Do you want everything to go back in
(
) Yes
Listen, Felicity, about Fat Bastard- (
) It's my job, Austin
You of all people should understand that
Marakesh, 1962
Rome, 1964
Tokyo, 1966 know your record backwards and forwards
You've had more sex on the job than a Swedish stewardess
The shadow Felicity tries to cram the tennis racket into what appears to be Austin's ass
(
) You're right, Felicity,  can't deny it
But the world changed, and changed too
Pull back to reveal that  - are watching
Felicity shoves the tennis racket extra hard
Austin stands up rapidly
(
) Ow
(beat) My back hurts
(
) Are you
(
) 'm fine, just keeping packing
The He-Bots shrug their shoulders and march towards the tent
'   - 60' Dr
Evil, Fat Bastard, Scott, Number Two and Frau are seated
Christ Almighty, it smells terrible in here
It's the volcanic sulphurous emissions
We've put up some air fresheners
Great, now it smells like someone took a shite in a pine tree
Dr
Evil, the laser has been loaded into the rocket
You're ready for launch
'm just waiting to taunt my nemesis
have so few pleasures, you know
Austin and Felicity are brought in at gunpoint by Private Army Men
Ah, Mr
Powers, Ms
Shagwell, welcome to my hollowed-out volcano
We meet again, Dr
Evil
Yes, the only reason 'm keeping you alive is so you can feel the agony of watching my plan unfold
Dr
Evil your plan will never-- Austin trails off as he spots his  in the beaker behind Dr
Evil
Oh, is that yours
My mojo
You know what they say: finders keepers, loser weepers
Dr
Evil, do you like real estate
Of course
Why
Felicity kicks Dr
Evil in the balls
Now you've got a couple of achers
Oww
My stomach hurts
(wincing) don't care if he is evil, you don't give a man a shot in the pills
It's just not cricket, baby
Take them away
The guards lead Austin and Felicity away
She just hoofed you in the sack and you're going to leave them alone in a jail cell with one inept guard
They'll escape, dipshit
You do this every time
You're going the right way for a smacked bottom, young man
You don't own me
do actually
(pulling out paper) It's complicated
Usually it's illegal but this buddy of mine
but digress
Fat Bastard, 'm leaving you in charge
'm going up the moon to hold the world ransom with my giant laser,  shouldn't be long
What about Powers
He's tucked away safely in his cell
He's harmless without that mojo
Guard it with your life
(to Number Two) Number Two, begin the countdown
The area around Dr
Evil's command chair, including the time portal behind it, is enclosed by a circular door, becoming part of the rocket
Steam begins billowing, etc
Five, four, three
(  ) (
) Two, one, liftoff
The rocket lifts off from the volcano into the night sky
(  ) The rocket in flight
- The rocket enters the screen
It has the silhouette of a flying penis
Colonel, you better have a look at this radar
What is it, son
don't know, sir, but it looks like a giant-- : - Dick
- Yes
Take a look out of starboard
- Oh my God, it looks like a huge-- Pecker
Where
He raises his binoculars
Over there
rare red-billed woodpecker
(looks over with binoculars) What sort of bird is that
Oh goodness, it's not a bird, it's- : Privates
We have reports of an Unidentified Flying Object
It has a long, smooth shaft, complete with- Two balls
No strikes
(looking up) What is that
It looks just like an enormous-- : Johnson
Yes, sir
Get on the horn to British Intelligence and let them know about this
Austin and Felicity are in a bare cell with cement walls
The huge metal door has a window with bars in it
How are we going to get out of here
Why don't you just shag Fat Bastard again
(exploding) Austin, that is it
don't know what happened to you in the Nineties, but 'm still here, in the Sixties, and  still swing
Don't try to lay your hang-ups on me just because you lost your mojo
That one hurts
Ouch, baby, very ouch
'm wounded
'm sorry, Austin, that was a cheap shot
No, baby, you're right
was wrong to judge you
guess  am
jealous
But the Austin Powers  knew was wild and crazy and free
He could never be jealous
That Austin is gone
've changed knew someone, not long ago, a very special woman
She taught me that life isn't about jumping into the sack with whoever comes along, it's about caring and responsibility
And while it is true she turned out to be an evil robot minion of Dr
Evil, suppose  really did
love her
Was that your wife
Yes, Vanessa
Felicity is touched
Listen, Austin,  can't pretend to understand everything you've gone through, but  trust you
'll make you a deal: if we get out of here alive, 'll give monogamy a try
With me
Yes, silly
Groovy, baby
They kiss
We need to lure the guard inside and get his key
Alright, what if  pretend to be desperately ill with food poisoning
The guard, drawn by my cries of pain, will come to investigate
Meanwhile, you dig a pit and line it with makeshift punji sticks made from sharpened toothbrushes
The guard falls in, Bob's your uncle, and we've got the key
What do you think
That might work, but how about this
Felicity charges towards the window in the door, ripping open her blouse as she goes, showing her breasts to the guard
We, however, can't see them
(giving a wolf whistle) What do you think of these, my man
The guard is mesmerized by Felicity
Mommy
He unlocks the door and enters
The guard enters an apparently empty cell
We see that Austin is wedged spread-eagle above the door, ready to pounce
(seductive, to guard) It's very hot in here, don't you think
The guard follows her into the cell
(irritated) It's very hot in here, don't you think
The guard advances on her
(breaking cover) Austin
(from above) 'm very firmly wedged
If you want something done
She  the guard right in the face and he collapses
Almost
got it
Austin falls flat on his face with a  and pops back up
Let's go get my mojo
' It is a stark, steel girder and glass structure
Dr
Evil is trying to look dignified but he is
He grabs at the railing of his chair as his feet float up
Has anyone seen my gravity booties
Honestly, all  wanted was a frickin' moon base
Hello, we're on the moon, no gravity
(calling out) Mini-Me
Are you alright
Mini-Me is stuck to the top of the ceiling along with a lot of
My frickin' mascot is stuck to the ceiling,
Not good
Papa not happy
couple of henchmen place  on Dr
Evil
He drops to the floor
(looking up) Somebody get the stick
Hold on, Mini-Me
(into microphone) Begin laser- He's interrupted by terrible
Dr
Evil taps and blows on the mic
(into microphone)
Begin- Worse
He holds it farther away
(into mic) Begin laser ignition sequence
The laser's coils begin to glow
Lunar alignment in 6 hours
- -type screen showing the current position of the moon and where it needs to be before the laser can fire
'   - Austin and Felicity run into the Main Room
It is strangely dark and quiet
Where's your mojo, Austin
'm not sure
: It's Raining Men by   Suddenly, the lights dim
The three He-Bots descend from the ceiling on trapezes and acrobatic rings, their muscles rippling
Watch out, baby, He-Bots
The He-Bots flip off their trapezes and land in unison, like a perfect Olympic dismount
Their crotch nozzles flip up one by one
can't fight them without my mojo
Who said anything about fighting
: seductive music Felicity does a very seductive dance, with hip thrusts and bumps and grinds
The He-Bots , succumbing to her mojo
Smashing, Felicity, you were making me very horny, man
Extremely randy, indeed
(
) 'mon, give the lads a show
Take of your top
Put 'em on the glass
Make 'em bounce
Let's have a look at your tits
Austin and Felicity turn to see Fat Bastard lurking in the background
Fat Bastard
Looking for this, Mr
Powers
Fat Bastard, holds the beaker and is flanked by a dozen private army men
Give me back my mojo, Fat Bastard
give the orders, (bleep) for brains
Guards, take them back to their cells
Guards approach
Hold on, let me ask you one question
Alright,  guess  owe you that much for a night of carnal ecstasy
Austin is grossed out
Are you happy
What kind of stupid ass question is that
'm (bleep)in' rich and 'm up to my tits in clean stinky
You didn't answer my question, are you happy
It's about my girth isn't it
Sure could lose a few pounds, but  could shiva git
Are you happy
Of course 'm not happy
Look at me, 'm a big fat slob
've got bigger titties than you do
've got more (bleep)in' chins than a Chinese phone book
've got more crack cheese than a (bleep)in' dairy
've nay seen ma willie in two years
That's enough time to declare it legally deed
can't stop eating
eat because 'm unhappy and 'm unhappy because  eat
(starts to cry) 'm caught in a cycle and there's no escape
Maybe inside that Fat Bastard there's a thin bastard, trying to get out Maybe there's big crap inside me trying to get out, jack-ass
Enough of your (bleep)in' new age aphorisms
Listen, 've run the gamut of self- help books
"Food isn't love", right, but how do you get it from the page to the (bleep)in' fork
'm so weak, hate myself
'm for shite
Here, take the mojo
Fat Bastard hands over the mojo
appreciate you trying to reach me, no one can do it for me,  know this now
There's a hole in my soul that food won't fill
This is the beginning of a new me
'm gonna go to the gym everyday
If you'll excuse me, there's someone  have to get in touch with and forgive
myself
(pause) Sorry
farted
(pause) It's a long road ahead
-
'  - Austin and Felicity run up to the Beetle
Hold on,  have something very important to do
Austin drinks the mojo
How do you feel
Sound as a pound, my spuds are boiling
Fancy a shag
Austin, we don't have time
'mon, luv, let's hop on the good foot and do the bad thing
Dr
Evil's taken his laser to the moon
The world is in danger
Right, the moon
think  know someone who can give us a lift
-   ( ) The Apollo ready for lift-off
(
) There's been some sort of delay in the launch of Apollo 11, Walter, but we understand that America's first manned mission to the moon will be blasting off shortly
Pan across Austin in a spacesuit, then Felicity in her spacesuit, then   in his space suit
They are surrounded by hundreds of gauges, buttons and meters
Gor blimey, you'd have to be a rocket scientist to figure this stuff out
am a rocket scientist
technician closes the hatch and the countdown begins
(
) We will have lift-off in  minus 10 seconds
9
8
etc
Felicity, if you get frightened, just hold my hand
( ) The rocket lifts off
(
) We have lift-off
Apollo 11 has cleared the tower and is heading for a rendezvous with the moon
The -forces during lift-off are incredible
Austin's face is pulled into a contorted mask which bares his teeth
His hair sticks straight up and his glasses are twisted
Austin is terrified
He clutches Felicity's hand, then grabs on to the astronaut beside him
Felicity, however, loves it
(yelling) Yaaaaa-hoooo
-   ( ) The stages separate
Basil sits at the console with  technicians
Austin, you have achieved lunar orbit
How was that lift-off
-   () To be honest it was terrifying
It felt like sitting on top of a bomb
As  punched through the atmosphere, said 'Oh my God
' and  soiled myself
Happens all the time in that situation
No,  mean  soiled myself just now when  said oh 'my God
' Basil, it was amazing
Prepare for moon landing
We only have one hour until Dr
Evil fires the laser
( ) The lunar module settles on the moon
(
) Mission control, the swinger has landed
- Austin and Felicity step out in their spacesuits
This is one small step for man, but a giant step for shagging
Can you imagine it, baby, weightless
The permutations are mind-boggling
Naughty boy
Austin plants a   on the moon
God Save the Queen
The   shakes his head
The Queen
This is an American show, goddammit
Let's roll that footage we shot last week in the studio
1960'   ( ) family gathers around the , watching Neil Armstrong's 'real' moon landing
' Dr
Evil walks all the way around a  -- up the walls, across the ceiling upside down, and back again, settling into his chair
It is like that shot in 2001 Position the laser
The laser shifts into place
An  goes off and (
) ,
Get me the President
: Mr
President, your time is up
This is your last chance to pay 100 billion dollars or see Washington destroyed
(
) ,
The  continues to blare
( ) The President at his desk
What
can't hear you
Pay me 100 billion dollars or see Washington  destroyed
The
'm sorry,  just can't hear you
(louder) How about now
Better
The Capital will be destroyed- The
Sorry
just can't-  think it's that alarm
Could someone shut off that frickin' alarm
'm trying to hold the free world hostage here
Honestly
(shouting) - The    but Dr
Evil is still shouting
(shouting) 100
His yelling startles even himself
Please Dr
Evil, be reasonable
That's more money than is in the entire Federal Treasury
Oh well,  guess you have one minute to- "show me the money"
still don't know what that means
can't show you the money because we don't have the money
Then  suppose you're up shit's crick without a paddle
white room with a bank of old-fashioned computers and a tracking screen
Basil, several , and other VIPs look anxiously over the shoulder of the Gentlemen, Austin has landed on the moon
We'll soon know whether he has succeeded or whether the world will be destroyed
'   - Austin and Felicity enter through a hatch and step out of their spacesuits
Let's find Dr
Evil
Suddenly, Austin notices something
Shhh
He points
We see a profile through a sheet of frosted glass
It is Dr
Evil's distinctive profile, with a machine gun
Austin takes careful aim and
We see the  take the hit, and fall
Austin, you've done it
You got Dr
Evil
Of course  did, baby,  got my mojo working overtime
Austin, 'm going ahead
Cover my rear
Oh, behave
Felicity runs ahead
Austin runs over to where the shadow came from
He sees that it was not Dr
Evil, but -, carrying a little gun
Austin is ashamed
Poor little bugger
He's so small, he's like a dog or something
Austin chokes back a tear
Poor little bugger
(realizing) Felicity, be careful
Dr
Evil is still alive
Felicity
Austin runs after her
'   - Austin rounds the corner and comes upon Dr
Evil
(holding his gun on Dr
Evil) Alright, slap-head, turn around
Slowly
Aren't you forgetting something
wall panel in the main chamber revolves, revealing , enclosed in a glass tube
Felicity
(to Dr
Evil) What have you done to her
Don't worry, she's not dead
yet
Brightly colored  starts to fill the glass chamber
(muffled through glass) Don't worry about me Austin
You've got to save the world
It looks like you have a choice, Powers: save the world, or save your girlfriend
Austin is torn
He looks back and forth between Felicity and the laser which is on the other side of the room
've got my mojo back, man,  can do both
We'll see
Fire the laser
The woman manning the laser's joystick begins to
Austin leaps across the room and reaches her just in time
Hands off my joystick, baby
He wrestles with her a moment and then
The laser beam hits the Big Boy Rocket in the crotch and Big Boy's eyes cross in pain
'   - Damn you, Powers
Dr
Evil hits a - button
An  blares
(
) Warning
Self-destruct sequence initiated
The base is rocked by
See, Dr
Evil  told you  could do both
Perhaps you spoke too soon
Austin looks over
Felicity has slumped over in the tube
Noooooo
Austin  on the glass with his fists
Felicity
Felicity
Wake up
Wake up
Please God, don't take her away
It is too late
Dr
Evil runs through the   and gets away
Felicity, you have to understand, thought  had my mojo back
This isn't fair
Austin looks up to the heavens
We see a quick-- - of moments they shared, Austin making her laugh, their first kiss, of Felicity being her beautiful and free-spirited self
tear runs down his cheek
Austin presses his face against the glass as if trying to reach her
love you, Felicity
know couldn't say it before, but  really do love you
(enraged) Dr
Evil, 'll kill him
Austin starts to chase him, but     block his path
Austin is like an animal
He charges toward the first soldier,    , and takes a bite out of it
Then Austin turns to the second soldier and like in Mortal Kombat
The soldier slumps to the ground
The last soldier is terrified
Austin swings both fists simultaneously, crushing the guy's head which Austin runs over to the   set for "75 "
He runs through
: - 75 An orgy is taking place
Dr
Evil is in a toga with a laurel with two    feeding him grapes
You make love to your wife out of duty, your mistress for pleasure, and a Roman boy for ecstasy
(noticing Austin) Shit
He runs away as Austin appears through the
Austin follows Dr
Evil into another   marked "1975"
- Austin emerges from the   to see Dr
Evil getting into a car
Austin waves his hands and a 1974 with a white stripe pulls over
have to commandeer this vehicle
(noticing) Hey, aren't you Hutch
(
) No
We see    ()
'm Starsky
'm Hutch
Austin jumps in and the Torino speeds off
Dr
Evil's car disappears into a car wash which is a
The Torino follows
sign at the car wash reads: "1911" : - Passengers in period garb walk past a lifesaver with "Titanic" stenciled above it
Dr
Evil enters through a portal with Austin hot on his heels
(
) Iceberg, dead ahead
Suddenly the ship tilts at a radical angle
, , and   slide by
'm king of the world
Dr
Evil and Austin slide backwards into the they just came from
: -  - Dr
Evil runs into the street with Austin chasing him
In - Austin dives for a ridiculously long time, and Dr
Evil, pinning him
'm going to kill you, you bastard
(breathing heavily) Before you do that, know this: Austin, am
your
father
: Really
No
can't back that up
was just grasping at straws
had nothing
But isn't it interesting, Mr
Powers, you really have become a product of the Nineties
How so
You're more interested in your job as glorified policeman than you are in love
You won the battle, but won the war
Love means nothing, you've proved it
didn't think that Felicity was going to die, man
What a cowardly response
'm disappointed really
You have the power to go back in time and save her, but it means letting me go
Austin looks over and sees a
Through it he can glimpse the lair, and Felicity
Well, Mr
Powers, which is it going to be
Me or the girl
Felicity
Austin runs through
: '   - 60' We see the scene from a moment ago
Felicity is in the glass tube and the    is starting to fill it
It looks like you have a choice: save the world, or save your girlfriend
choose love, baby
Austin runs over to the glass tube and through it
The glass  and Austin pulls Felicity out
She gasps for air
Felicity,  love you
(breathless) But  thought- That was another place and another time, baby
Austin kisses her for a long time
She starts to twitch
She struggles
She hits him in the head and he finally stops kissing her
(gasping) Can't
Breathe
Sorry, baby,  got a little over- stimulated
Fire the laser
What do we do
Use your mojo
don't have it
Trust me, you do
Austin turns and gives a 'who me
' look over his bottom
The woman arming the laser stumbles backwards into the directional control just as it
The Big Boy Rocket spins to avoid the laser as it passes harmlessly by
Jubilation
He did it, he saved the world
(calming down) Of course,  thought he might
,    - Austin, you did it
They embrace
Uh-oh
(beat) think  just got my mojo back
Really
Austin, you had it all along
No one can take your, mojo away from you
Good-bye, Mr
Powers, for the last time
Dr
Evil hits the - button and climbs aboard the rocket, which blasts off
(   ) Dr
Evil's escape rocket in flight
- Dr
Evil's rocket enters the screen
It has the silhouette of a flying penis
Sir, you better have a look at this radar
What is it
don't know, sir
It's hard to describe
It's

Pay attention

(pointing to her chart) The male reproductive organ
Also known as tallywhackers, wankers, schlongs, or-- : Peters
Yes, sir
Any word from Austin
We've picked up his signal, but the lunar base seems to self-destructing
(on microphone) Austin, if you can hear me, use the time portal
There's no time to get to the lunar module
Use the time portal
' Austin stumbles
Felicity looks at him
Austin, you have to get to the time portal
Come with me, Felicity
It's the only way out
Austin, will  fit in the Nineties
If  did, anyone can
Let's go, baby
The   is fifty feet away
Austin and Felicity run towards it
In the foreground, are a stack of conveniently placed barrels
As they run behind the barrels, an obvious and an obvious emerge in their place
The stunt doubles grab a winch hanging above them and cross over to the   in a dramatic series of acrobatic flips and stunts
The stunt doubles run behind another conveniently placed pile of barrels
Austin and Felicity emerge in their place and run through the
The   reads "1999"
: '  - 1999 - It is the most up-to-date modern apartment you've ever seen in your life
There is a large screen , a  player etc
Movers move in tasteful modern furniture and various other accouterments of moving
Felicity puts a  on an old style turntable
:
Sorry
Don't worry baby it takes some getting used to
Let me ask you Felicity, do you feel any side effects from the time travel
Felicity smiles broadly, revealing that she now has like Austin's
'm as healthy as a horse
love you, Felicity
And  love you
Do you want to get married
Absolutely not
Thank God
They kiss
