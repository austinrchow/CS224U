September 2, 2002 : - We hear the sound of a plane landing over black
: '  - The back of a  in pink underwear, she leans at a big window, looking out over Tokyo
: Melodramatic music swells over the Girl's butt in pink sheer underwear as she lies on the bed
- from a car window - the colors and lights of Tokyo neon at night blur by
: In the backseat of a Presidential limousine,  (late- forties), tired and depressed, leans against a little doily, staring out the window
from car window- We see buildings covered in bright signs, a billboard of Brad Pitt selling jeans, another of Bob in black & white,looking distinguished with a bottle of whiskey in a Suntory ad
more signs, a huge  with perky Japanese pop stars singing
: - Bob's black Presidential (looks like a 60's diplomat's car) pulls up at the entrance of the Park Hyatt, a modern sky rise
The automatic doors open on the car, as Bob gets out
Eager with white gloves approach at the sight of the car, welcoming Bob and helping him with his bags
: - Bob stands in the back of a crowded elevator surrounded by Japanese businessmen below his shoulders
The elevator stops at the 50th floor and the doors open onto the massive, streamline lobby of the Park Hyatt
Bob follows the   out into the marble and glass lobby that frames the view of Tokyo
The  and several eager   greet Bob
He just wants to sleep, but more  continue to greet him, ask him about his fright
They lead him to reception
- At the reception area four   and two quickly sit up from their seats on sight of Bob, and extend handshakes and gifts
They bow and introduce themselves from the commercial company, extend name cards and welcome him enthusiastically
More staff welcomes him and offer their service during his stay
One of them presents a fax that has come for him
- ": : '
'  '
, " He doesn't know what to do with it, and stuffs it in his pocket
The commercial people tell him when they'll be picking him up, and ask if he needs anything else
Some    with shag haircuts and skinny leather pants pass by
Each commercial person has to shake Bob's hand before leaving
: '   - Bob sits on the end of the bed in a too small hotel kimono
- Bob sits at the bar
few minutes pass as he sits in silence looking around, drinking a scotch
Chet Baker sings "The Thrill is Gone" over the stereo
We see Bob's  of tables of people talking ,   tying one on, talking about software sales
carefully setting down a coaster, and pouring a beer very, very slowly
It's all very foreign
: '   - The automatic hotel curtains open, pouring light into the room
: - Bob gets in the shower overlooking the view of Tokyo
The shower head is at his elbows, he raises it as high as it goes, and leans down to have a shower
This hotel was not designed with him in mind
: - Whiskey commercial shoot
The set is full of activity as the   work
Bob, in a shawl collared tuxedo sits at a European style bar set with a cut crystal glass of whiskey
quickly powders his face as they adjust lights and the  and crew speak in hurried Japanese
The Director (with blue contact lenses) says a few long sentences in Japanese
, a middle-aged woman in a coordinated outfit, translates but it is only a short sentence now
He wants you to turn, look in camera and say the lines
Bob wonders what she's leaving out, or if that's the way it works from Japanese to English
That's all he said
Yes, turn to camera
Bob thinks let's just get it over with
Turn left or right
The Translator blots her face with a tissue, and asks the director in a Japanese sentence 5 times as long
The Director answers her in a long excited phrase
Right side
And with intensity
Is that everything
It seemed like he was saying a lot more
The excited Director says more in Japanese
Translator nods in understanding
Bob doesn't really know what's going on
Like an old friend, and into the camera
(to Bob)) Suntory Time
They get ready, and roll camera: Bob turns and looks suavely to the camera: For relaxing times, make it Suntory Time
The Director yells something about ten sentences long
The translator nods
Could you do it slower, and with more intensity
Okay
The Translator answers for him in four sentences
- we see the next take: the moody lighting shines on Bob, the camera gets closer as he stares into camera and gives them the line
For relaxing times, make it Suntory Time
: - Shinjuku High rises sparkle
- Tall glass walls show the neon and high-rises of the city
sad and romantic Bill Evans song plays
Bob sits alone with a scotch at the bar
Some drunk  , with their ties thrown over their shoulders recognize him
Hey- you're Bob Harris- you're awesome, man
Yeah,  love Sunset  Odds
Oh, Ok, thanks
Man, that car chase- Bob  nods
'   - Bob comes back to his room
The maids have left everything perfect, his beige bed is turned down, and the  has been left on to a channel playing a montage of flower close-ups in nature while sad violin music plays
It's supposed to be relaxing, but it's just sad
: Bob lies in bed
He flips through  channels from the remote control
He passes a Japanese game show, to an 80s Cannon Ball run-type movie with him in it dubbed into Japanese
He turns it off as he hears a knock at the door
He goes to the door, and opens it part way
(
) (Raspy Japanese voice) Mr
Harris
Yes
Mr
Kazuzo sent me
Oh
Can  enter
He pauses, then opens the door
in her forties in a short tight leather mini skirt and stockings comes in
She is wearing '60s style make-up
Bob sits on the bed not sure what to do as he watches her
Bob's  - We see her back to us as she puts a  on the stereo - it begins to play: Serge Gainsberg and Brigitte Bardot sing "Bonnie & Clyde"
The woman turns slyly around and shimmies over to Bob
(as she tries to undress him) Mr
Harris
Yes
Do you like massage
don't think so
Mr
Kazuzo send Premium Fantasy
She pushes him back onto the bed
He hesitates, but then goes along with it passively
My stockings
Yes
Take them
He fumbles with her stockings, trying to do as she says
No - Lip  them
Don't touch me
He takes his hands back confused
Lip my stockings
He backs away, as he tries to understand her
Lip them
She throws her leg up to him on the bed
Huh
She pantomimes ripping them
He finally understands
Oh, you want me to rip them
He pulls at her stockings trying to rip them, but they just snap
She pretends to struggle
Please let me go
He pulls his hands away
She grabs them and puts them back on her, and keeps struggling dramatically
They wrestle around awkwardly, her pretending to try to get away, but not letting him go
She rips her stockings and falls off the bed in fake- defense
Let me go
She pulls a confused Bob down on top of her
He doesn't know what she wants
She rips another stocking and pins him on the ground
He tries to crawl away, she grabs his leg and trips him
He grabs a nearby table leg as he falls, the lamp crashes to the floor, the room goes black
think you should leave
: - In the harsh sunlight of the big windows Bob eats breakfast alone
Next to him is a table of  in cowboy hats
At another table a   in sunglasses chain smoke and drink coffee
: - Bob gets into the ded elevator
He is stopped momentarily by the Concierge who asks him if everything is fine for his stay
In the elevator Bob's surrounded by and a  dressed for a wedding
Across, at the other side of the elevator he sees , a pretty Ivy-league girl in her mid-twenties, and the only other Westerner in the elevator
Her honey-colored hair stands out in the crowd
She's looking at him like you do when someone new comes in the elevator, but the Japanese look straight ahead at the elevator doors
Charlotte and Bob look at each other across the Japanese heads
She smiles, from one foreigner to another
The door opens and she gets out with the crowd
Bob watches her leave
Mr
Harris He is approached by a group of eight excited people from the commercial company there waiting to take him
(as they are on their way) We just got a request from Tanabe Mori-he is the Johnny Carson of Japan
It is a big honor to be invited to his show
Bob feigns enthusiasm briefly
Can you stay until Friday
'll have to see about that
: - Bob's back is to us as a -  is putting some final touches on him
The  is giving her enthusiastic direction in Japanese
Bob talks on his cell phone, not paying attention to the make-up artist
Can you get me on a flight Thursday night
(
) We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan
Yeah, they told me
(
) These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it
Just get me out of here as soon as you can
(
) Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade
there might be a seat on Lufthansa
Oh, great
'll talk to you later, bye
He hangs up
The make-up artist dusts him with powder
The commercial people are crowding around
Bob's chair is swivelled around and we see him in his tuxedo, wearing too much make-up and some weird looking eyeliner
In front of a grey backdrop, moody lighting is being adjusted and Bob is handed a bottle of Suntory
small documentary crew moves in on Bob with a video camera- the camera man is tilting the camera at his face in arty dutch camera moves
The agency people crowd around
The photographer is excited and urges Bob to do dumb poses, he won't do
Can you put hands close to face
The photographer demonstrates a dramatic pose with his hands at his face
Urn,  don't think so
How bout just hold the bottle
The photographer starts shooting
Bob obviously hates the whole thing, what you do for money
: - Bob, still in his tuxedo and make-up from the shoot, sits alone having a drink
performs
The  is a middle-aged woman with red wavy hair, dressed in red, and takes her singing very seriously
She sings a slow version of "Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme"
- a golden beer is poured very slowly
Bob drinks his scotch, hoping it will all go away
Across the bar, Charlotte sits with , her husband (he is in his late twenties and sloppy in a fashionable way), and some  - super stylish, weird Japanese fashion people (all smoking)
One of them, , in a shiny suit, keeps taking pictures, and showing them magazine layouts
Thank you
We're glad to be here, we're Sausalito
Charlotte laughs and looks down, the Japanese audience clap very seriously
she and Bob catch eyes - about Sausalito and how weird it is there
: - The mirrored elevator doors close and Bob sees himself close- up in the elevator's mirrored walls - noticing the heavy makeup and weird eyeliner from the shoot which he had forgotten about
He looks at himself
: '   - Charlotte lays close to her young husband, John
She looks to see if he's awake, but he's sleeping soundly
She leans her chin on his shoulder
Are you awake
He doesn't answer
John
He grumbles something, opens one sleepy eye to look at her, and grabs her under the covers
He kisses her
Go to sleep
He holds her close, but she can't sleep
: Charlotte sits on a ledge looking out at the big buildings
The sun is starting to come up
Below she watches cars going places
: '   - Bob lies in bed awake
The clock says 4:20
The in-room fax machine is making noise as a fax rolls in
Bob looks at the fax machine but doesn't get out of bed
The fax curls and falls to the floor
- "- '
' ' , " Three pages of shelf diagrams follow
: - The gym is empty except for an old man vacuuming
Bob passes piles of little towels and bottles of water
He takes a water for his workout
He approaches an exercise machine and puts the water in the drink holder of the machine
He looks at the lit-up instruction panel'99 it is all in Japanese
He pushes a button, and the machine starts beeping, then a soothing woman's voice recites instructions in Japanese
He gets on it, and sinks
He tries to make the arms and foot peddles coordinate
He pushes a button and it starts moving too fast
In an upward rotation he tries to reach the control panel, but is not fast enough
The soothing woman's voice continues instruction
(she occasionally includes an English word- gently,   gently
vigorous)   He tries to keep up with it, and tries again to push the right button to slow it down, but the machine steps starts going swiftly backwards instead
: ( ) - The agency group wait for Bob
They stand up as he approaches from the elevator, trying to mask a slight limp
(everything's fine) Good morning
Miss Kawasaki notices his limp with concern as they leave the hotel
: - Charlotte gets out at shibuya station, a crowded neighborhood filled with neon, ads, and people
She looks up at the huge intersection as tons of wait to cross the street, no one steps forward until the cross-walk light changes, and all of them cross
screen covering a building plays commercials
She roams around the narrow streets, crowded with stylish , tan  pass her
: Charlotte wanders down a crowded street, looking around
On a small side street she stops at a little park
She watches a     together: '  - The man reaches his hand to the back of the woman's neck, and leans in close
The woman smiles at him, in love
: '   - John is sound asleep
Charlotte is awake next to him
She looks at the clock - it's three a
m
She slides close to him, kisses his mouth
He grumbles something in his deep sleep, and rolls over
She goes to the couch, stepping over camera equipment
She looks at the fruit basket, decides to try an apple
She has a piece but isn't really hungry
She reaches over some proof sheets and looks at a magazine, but she's already looked at it a few times before
She decides to go downstairs
: - Bob sits alone at the bar
Charlotte sits down a seat away from him, lost in his thoughts, he doesn't see her until he turns and finds her next to him
They look at each other young  with a sweet face tends to them
What can  get you
'm not sure
(line from commercial) For relaxing times, make it & 'Suntory time'
Charlotte smiles at him sympathetically What are you doing here
My wife needs space,  don't know my kids ' birthdays
Everyone wants Tiger Woods, but they could get me, so 'm here doing a whiskey commercial
She looks at him
Oh
She lifts a cigarette, he lights it for her
'll just have a beer
He makes small talk about the pickled seaweed breakfast and jet lag, they commiserate about having not slept in days
What about you
Why are you here
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and  just came along
'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here
How long have you been married
Two years
Try twenty-five
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis
Did you buy a Porche
'm thinking about it
25 years
that's a long time
Are you still in love with your wife
Yes
don't know,  don't know her anymore
don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time
was
actually  was in love with her sister first, when was twenty-one
And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so  said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him
And  moved in with Lydia
but  always really liked Lydia
(amused with too much info) Oh
What do you do
'm not sure, yet
graduated last spring
What did you study
Philosophy
Oh, what do you do with that
don't know, but  can think about it, a lot
It takes a while to figure it out
'm sure you will, though
Thanks
'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too
Thanks
They clink glasses
wish  could sleep  Me, too
: - The hotel is filled with business people
dressed up is going to lunch
We follow a jet-lagged Charlotte and John, as they walk down the lobby hall
An energetic blonde actress, , pops up to them
(She's carrying a copy of Memoirs of a Geisha
) John, who was holding Charlotte's hand, drops it
John

Charlotte looks at John

, 've been sweating in this little room with
lights for hours
Kelly, giggling and acting all too comfortable with herself, is eating up all the oxygen around them
Oh no
(with a big smile) Well,  have the worst  headache, have to go find some aspirin
But, call me, let's have a drink, 'm under Evelyn Waugh
Kelly giggles
Charlotte smirks
Ok, see you later
And Kelly and her make-up artist and publicist are off
John and Charlotte continue
Evelyn Waugh
What
Evelyn Waugh was a man
John shrugs
Oh, c'mon, she's nice
Not everyone went to Yale
Charlotte shoots him a look
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter
Why do you have to defend her
'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is
No,  thought it was funny
Forget it
His producer comes up to them
John puts his arm around Charlotte, kisses her, everything's fine
(looks at his watch) We should get going
, 'll see you later
He kisses her on the cheek, and is gone
: '   - Charlotte walks into the empty hotel room
- Charlotte's feet as she clips her toenails
: -Charlotte's hand by an ashtray, writes in a journal
: Charlotte looks in a mirror, trying on an unfinished scarf she's knitting
She checks the length on herself
: Charlotte sits on the big window sill checking her messages on the phone
(
) (voice mail recording) Hi, leave a message
We hear the # key as Charlotte hits it to interrupt the message
You have eighteen new messages
Press - She hits a button
'  (
) Hi Charlotte,  don't know if you're in town

Call me,  love you
Charlotte pushes a button
(
) Charlotte hangs up : Charlotte lies on the bed, in the knit scarf and underwear She's doing a quiz in a magazine: "    -
" : - An Olympic pool is framed by tall glass walls with the Tokyo view
Bob is handed a swim cap and goggles
Bob watches a Japanese  swimming, he looks like an over-grown baby
Bob swims laps in the pristine pool
He continues his laps
Under water he sees the jumping legs of -
disco mixed tape starts, and above water we see a in tight shorts leading an aqua-aerobics class to the group of , They jump up and down to Sister Sledge
: - Bob walks past the rows of lockers to the Sauna room
He sits in the sauna, two   speak German in the corner
Bob comes out from the sauna, red and sweaty
: Bob submerges in the cold water of a small pool in the sauna room, having a moment of relief
: '  - Charlotte lies on the floor with big headphones on, listening to a book on tape
After a corny music intro, a very serious scholar man's voice speaks clearly : (0
) Did you ever wonder what your purpose in life is
This book is about finding your soul's purpose or destiny
Every soul has its path, but sometimes that path is not clear
The acorn theory is an example of each soul beginning with an imprint
Charlotte tries to get into it, but can't get past feeling like a loser listening to a self-help tape
She looks at the doctor's photo on the audio-book box, he's bald, in a turtleneck and glasses
: - Charlotte follows a   in formal dress out of the elevator onto the mezzanine level
She wanders down a big hall
She sees an open door and steps in the crowded room, which is in the midst of a press conference
Cameras flash as Kelly, with wide eyes, behind a table, answers questions enthusiastically
You know, barbecuing, and yoga, and  love taking my dogs, Buster and Lulu, for walks on the beach
and it was great learning karate for "Midnight Racer" -  did all my own stunts
The   seem excited by her answer
Kelly throws a Karate punch for a
What was it like working with Keanu Reeves
It was great
've known him for a while now- you know we both live in We both have dogs
Charlotte walks out
- Charlotte continues down a hall, she stops at an open door and peeks in
quiet group of   are gathered around a table
Charlotte goes in, as she gets closer she sees they are being instructed in Ikebana floral design
Each woman has a little vase and elegant flower cuttings
She watches as they delicately arrange the tiny flowers
The  hands Charlotte a vase and cuttings
Alongside the women, Charlotte tries to follow along
'  - Charlotte reclines low in the bathtub staring off
She can see mount Fuji in the distance
The audio tape plays on the stereo
(dry & monotonous) Plato's text calls this image the "paradeigma"
So the lot is the image that is your inheritance, your place on earth, all compacted into a pattern that has been selected by your soul before you even got here- or better said, that is always and continually being selected by your soul,because time does not enter the equation of myth
- : '   - With her back to us, Charlotte looks out the big window
John comes up and kisses her
How'd it go today
Good
'm tired
He hugs her for a moment, leaning on her
gotta go meet Kelly for a drink downstairs
She wants to talk about some photo thing
Ok
Maybe 'll walk down with you
You wanna come
Sure
(doesn't really want her to) Ok
: - At a corner table Charlotte sits with John, Kelly, and , a skinny kid in a sweatshirt, on tour in Japan
Charlotte is bored while Kelly talks on
Sausalito performs in the background
My Dad was anorexic
(she's never heard of that) Really
John shoots Charlotte a look
(very serious) He was on the American side at the Bay of Pigs, in Cuba, and he was taken prisoner, and they tortured them about their food the whole time
Where
My dad fought on the American side at the Bay of Pigs
So, when he was a prisoner, they would tell them they had put poison in their food and they would make themselves throw up
and when he got back, he did better, but he still has food issues
He has to have really clean food
And really simple
He can't just go have, say, Chinese food
(trying) Oh, that's too bad
Charlotte ashes her cigarette in a clean ashtray, and she watches as it is quickly replaced with a new one by a
(nodding at the view) How crazy is this shit
Yeah, it is
Clean starts doing a human beat box at her
Charlotte looks over at Kelly
Oh my god you have to try it, this power cleanse is amazing- it's lemon juice and grade  maple syrup and cayenne pepper for seven days
Just like a half a teaspoon of cayenne
The first few days you're a little scattered, but by day four - it's amazing
my eyes were so white
Charlotte excuses herself
She passes Bob who sits at his usual spot at the bar, as she is leaving
Hi again, how's it going
Who do  have to fuck to get off this planet
Charlotte laughs with sympathy, but doesn't know what to tell him
: '   - John sleeps soundly (turned away from her), Charlotte can't sleep
She turns on the
to a crazy local
variety show
: '   - Bob can't sleep, he watches the same show on ,
He flips the channel- it's an old black & white Japanese movie of a man committing Hari Kari

speaks in Japanese, monks chant
It's all very foreign
Charlotte tries to feel something
: '   - Charlotte sits on the bed talking to John who's coming out of the bathroom, getting ready to go to work
He checks himself in the mirror,  Am  shallow
No, what are you talking about
went to a temple today and  didn't feel anything
That's ok
He looks for his mobile phone
don't know what to do
That's ok, you'll figure it out
He comes close and kisses her
You smell weird
What
She leans back to look at him
Like popcorn
got some hair stuff
She looks at him funny
Hair stuff

He grabs her, kissing her good-bye, she wraps her him, when his cell phone rings
'll be right down
'm just leaving

He kisses her, and leaves
See you later
Bye
: She makes a call
We see her back and hair, as she looks out the bright window
Lauren
(
) Charlotte
How's Tokyo

and, didn't feel anything
even tried ikebana,
and John's using hair products
don't know who Lauren's Call-waiting beeps, cutting off her sentence
Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec
Sure
Charlotte waits
Sorry about that, what were you saying
In the background a baby starts crying
Oh, it's nothing
better go, 'll talk to you later
Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan
call me when you get back
Ok, bye
She hangs up
She sits there for a moment, starting to cry, she wipes the tears, trying to make them go away
: - Tokyo goes by out the window
Charlotte looks at the on the crowded train
sweaty  blots his face with a little handkerchief
Another older  reads an erotic comic book
- Charlotte looks up at the many signs, trying to figure out which way to go, but they are all in Japanese characters
Confused, she chooses the west exit
- Charlotte walks down a little street in a quiet neighborhood
She stops at a window of a portrait studio and looks at all of the wedding portraits
They are very formal and retouched, Japanese brides and grooms dressed in a Western old-fashion style
: - Charlotte looks through the window as a tan Japanese boy, tries to win a stuffed animal for his girlfriend
- In a crowded arcade, Charlotte watches some kids play Dance Revolution, a video game where you dance along to cues on the light-up floor
One  in a suit is really good and into it
She sees a sushi chef game where you have to cut an electronic fish
She looks at a firefighter game, and rows of plexi boxes filled with some little character dolls you try to win
: - Charlotte looks at the shelves of books she passes, she flips through some books
She walks over to a small gallery space and goes up to the wall to see the small photos
They are of tied-up, partially naked Japanese school girls, one girl is spanking another one with a stuffed animal
She's making a face of ecstacy
Charlotte looks at it, not getting it
: - Charlotte stands alone on a side street, smoking a cigarette and watching the  go by
: - Charlotte walks up a little street filled with shops
She stops at a window of cute underwear that she
looks at
She goes into the shop
: '   - 51C
Charlotte's lips
She puts watermelon color lipstick on
She looks at herself in the mirror in her new underwear
: We hear the shower running in the bathroom
Charlotte decorates the room, putting up some paper cherry blossom decorations
She goes over to the bed and stubs her toe on it, as she flops down
Ouch
She holds her toe, annoyed with her klutziness
John talks to her from the shower
(
) At the fitting, they had all these rock n roll clothes, the label guys kept saying lock n loll, though, but the band doesn't look tough at all
they look better just skinny and nerdy, like how when they came in
they looked so uncomfortable in these Keith Richards clothes, they should just be like they are, don't you think
She's drifted off
Yeah
Yeah,  think you're probably right
because when you try to
He gets out and is rushing to get his stuff together to go
Charlotte's lounging on the bed in her new pink underwear
She tries her scarf on that she's been knitting
Do you think it's done

He goes to get all his stuff together
He passes an ashtray with cigarette butts in it
Will you please stop smoking
But  like to
and  don't smoke that much
Its bad for you
Ok,  will

He picks up a camera from a table in the corner
He looks at the self-help audio book box
Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling
Is this yours
Oh
that's nothing, someone gave it to me
You don't have to be embarrassed
'm not
It's just corny, but 'm not into it
It's ok if you are
He kisses the side of her face and her shoulder like a cute pet, and then continues getting his stuff together
John sets two bottles of Cristal on the bed next to her, not really seeing her
Oh, the record company sent these
Mmm,  love Cristal, let's have some
gotta go
and  don't really like champagne
As he unplugs his cell phone from the wall
Are you sure you want to stay
Are you sure you have to go
He looks at her - like don't make it harder
Yeah,  know you have to work the whole time, 'll probably have more fun here
'll call Charlie and those guys
Ok, definitely call them, 'll be back Friday
love you
They kiss
love you
He tackles her, kisses her, bites her, grabs her ribs, tickling her in a burst of affection
She laughs, her arms around his neck
miss you
It'll just be a few days
He kisses her and is off
Charlotte sits there alone with the unopened bottles of champagne
: - Water splashes as Charlotte dives into the pool (in a one- piece bathing suit) as the sun goes down
: - Leaving in her robe, Charlotte runs into Bob, in his robe, going to the pool
Oh, hi
(awkward, but glad to run into her) Hi
Did you have a nice swim
Yeah
Did you get some sleep
No, how about you
Not really
How long are you here for
'm here for the week
Oh, good
Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here
Ok
See you later
He watches her go
: '  - As Bob opens his door to his room, a FedEx package falls in his path
He opens it - large carpet swatches fall out with a note " - ,
, " He looks at them for a second, they all look the same, and why is she sending these
He puts them down
: '   - The elaborate chiming doorbell rings
Charlotte opens the door to see Bob
He's wearing an orange camouflage -shirt
She looks at his shirt, suppressing a smile
You really are having a mid-life crisis
(embarrassed) know, it's stupid
He goes into the bathroom to change it
He comes out with it on inside out so it's just an orange -shirt
He asks her to cut the label out for him
She goes to find some scissors
He picks up  Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling audio-book box
Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this
No
She returns with the hotel room sewing kit
read it, too
She smiles, busted, but doesn't say anything as she cuts his shirt label with little hotel sewing-kit scissors
She slips on her shoes on to leave
: - All white nightclub, lit with black lights so it seems to glow in the dark, with the booming sound of helicopters
walk by
Bob watches Charlotte as Charlie, in a crazy outfit, hugs her
Charlotte tries to talk to Bob over the loud music
Charlie, this is Bob
Bob  Charlie Brown
Hi, Charlie
They shake hands
His real name's Hayashi, but someone started calling him Charlie because they thought he looked like Charlie Brown
They've all got American nicknames because its easier for me to remember
they were just out in last month doing a shoot with John
that guy's Mr
Valentine, he's the art director of their magazine,  don't even know his real name, or why  call him that
Bob looks over at some   in huge glasses smiling at them
Charlie hands them some drinks
This is Bambi
Hi
young   with a shaved head smiles at her, and takes her picture
- plays Trans Europa Express
Some people at the bar buy drinks for Bob and insist on drinking with him
Bob and Charlotte look over as Charlie gets into some problem with the
The Bartender gets mad and starts shooting a real-looking  gun at him
Orange bullets fly through the air
They all rush out of there
: - Bob and Charlotte try to get past the crowd at the entrance
big  stops them and is yelling fast Japanese at him
The crowd parts as the Bartender emerges shooting his gun, and Bob and Charlotte run for it
- The Bartender climbs on a car, threatening them from above
Bob covers Charlotte as they duck behind the car
They make a run for it, ducking into a pachinko parlor
- Bob and Charlotte run past the blinking machines, and gamblers, to another door to the street
- Bob spots a cab and they run to it, seeing Charlie now throwing bottles in the direction of the bartender
Bob and Charlotte get in the cab
- Charlotte hits her head as they get in
Bob yells to the driver to go, but he doesn't understand
Through the windshield they see the Bartender and sidekick coming with baseball bats
They hear a bang on the door and Charlie hops in
He makes sure she is ok and shouts something to the Driver, and they speed away
: - Charlie, in his flashy outfit, sings "God Save the Queen" into the Karaoke mic
He rolls his r's just like Johnny Rotten
Charlotte laughs and loves watching Charlie
They're other friends wear the different color wigs they provide at this place
There are big bottles of beer and sake
They are all pretty formal
Bambi tries to talk to Charlotte with a big grin, he can barely speak English
How's california
(smiles) Good
Good
like your swimming pool
Thanks, you guys should come back sometime
Yes
He tries wigs on her
He puts a light pink wig on her and beams
Bob smokes and watches
Kawaii
(Kawaii means "cute") She smiles a lovable smile at Bambi
: Charlie and Charlotte sings "Brass in Pocket" by The Pretenders ("you're special, so special
"), everyone is drunk now, as they all sing along at the chorus
keep refilling the glasses
: Mr
Valentine sings a popular slow heartfelt Japanese song that everyone knows and sings along to
Charlotte and Bob look at each other, it is very foreign, but Bob likes being there with Charlotte and her friends
She flips through a big binder of songs
What do you feel like singing, Bob
No way
: Bob sings " fall to Pieces" to Charlotte
Charlie and everyone cheers for him
Beer pitchers are replaced
Charlie starts singing "Angle"
The little room is fxlled with smoke, Charlotte makes her way to the door to get some air
: - Taking a break from the crowded and hot Karaoke room, Charlotte sits for a break alone on a bench in the bright hallway
It is quiet with just the muffled sound of music from the Karaoke room
She's wearing a pink geisha wig
Bob sits down next to her
Charlotte lights his cigarette with some crazy Japanese light- up lighter
She leans her head back - it's getting too heavy
She looks at his hands
You bite your nails
He nods
could cut the ones that are left for you
Ok
: '  - , a cool skinny stoner guy in a Hawaiian shirt, plays phsycadellic records in his seventies hippie surfer-pad
His   , who looks like a 60's pin-up, pours cold sake
Bob is  handed a ridiculously big bong
Charlie is drunk and taking polaroids
Nobu, really stoned, talks to Bob about surfing
with thick glasses introduces himself to Charlotte, extending his hand
'm Hans
Hans
Nice to meet you
: Charlie takes pictures of Charlotte and , a sexy Japanese girl, posing on a sheepskin run
They are being hammy for Charlie who loves it
Bob walks up and is amused watching her, she sees him and gets embarrassed
: - Hiromix dances  Charlotte dances with Hans - she looks sweaty but beautiful
Bob dances with his eyes closed, really into it, in the midst of all of them
the song " Feel Too Young" plays
: '  - Bob and Charlotte are leaving Nobu's
She's wearing Bob's jacket
Make sure she gets home okay
will
Bob takes Charlotte's arm carefully just as she bangs her head walking into the glass door - it makes a loud thud
Are you ok
She nods
Bob looks back at Charlie who is watching- she's fine
He leads her into a waiting cab
: - from cab - Tokyo neon blurs by
It looks beautiful
- Charlotte looks at the neon going by
She looks over at Bob, her eyelids are too heavy for her
don't want to go home
know
don't either
: - Bob carries a very drunk Charlotte to her room
Her purse dangling from his arm
'  - He puts her on her bed
He takes her shoes off for her and pulls a blanket over her
He looks at her lying on the bed
She opens her eyes to smile at him
He wants to kiss her, but he leaves
: - He walks down the empty hall, not wanting to leave her
As he goes he looks at various trays of leftover room service in the hallway
'  - Bob comes back to his room, tripping over the carpet samples
He makes a phone call from bed
He's still a little drunk and thinking about his night out in Tokyo
Lydia
(
) Hello, darling
Lydia,  went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it
(
) Oh, yeah
wish  had seen it
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and  was talking to these Japanese surfers
He was playing all this great music- have to find out what it was
(
) That sounds great  can you hold on
(talks to daughter) What Zoe
(
) don't want it
(
) Well, you have to have something for breakfast
Do you want cereal
(
) No
(
) Just trying to get her to eat something
'm glad you're having fun
Yeah, its really different here
(
) Well, that's good,  have to get the kids off for school
Can  call you in a little while
It's four in the morning
'm going to go to sleep
(
) Ok, well

love you, too, good-night, or good- morning
(
) Good-night
He hangs up
: '  - Charlotte can-'t get out of bed
She looks at the clock- it's 10 a
m
She picks up the phone
: '  - Bob (still in camouflage -shirt from last night) answers the phone by his bed
(grumbly) Hello
(
) It's Charlotte
Charlotte, who
(
) Thanks for getting me back in one piece
: Charlotte's feet on her bed (
) Of course
Do you want to have some breakfast
her hand wraps the phone cord around her fingers
(
) Yeah, 'm going to take a shower and 'll meet you downstairs
, see you downstairs
: - They sit in the bright light
She squints and drinks a Bloody Mary
Bob is distant
She looks across at two middle-aged -  talking about plastic surgery, you can't hear them, but can tell as they gesture and one pulls her eye lids up
Charlotte looks at another table by the elaborate buffet and sees the redhead Singer having breakfast with the rest of Sausalito
(trying to make it light) Hey look, it's Sausalito
see them every morning
They don't know what to say
Somehow it's too intimate having breakfast
She eats her breakfast aware of her every movement
- her  of soft scrambled eggs
: - In the distance, Bob swings on a perfect golf course
: '   - Charlotte lies in bed awake
The clock says its 4 a
m
Finally she gives up on trying to sleep, and turns the light on
In John's old -shirt and Ugg boots, she goes to the couch, looks at some strange pastry with an elaborate presentation left by the hotel
She picks up a magazine, but she's already looked at it a few times before
She hears something and goes over to the door
On her way, she passes her red
Anthony suitcase overflowing with stuff that looks like a bomb went off in it
envelope is slipped under the door
She opens it to see a typed note from the operator: "From: Mr
Harris
Message: Are you awake
" She smiles like she's gotten a valentine
: '  - Bob opens the door, Charlotte's standing there trying to look casual, she's happy to see him (she's put some pants on and flip flops instead of her dumb looking Ugg boots)
She knocks into a low table, bumping her knee as she comes in
Bob pours some cold sake, smoothly
Bob and Charlotte watch La Dolce Vita with Japanese subtitles on the
Hans was very attentive to you
think he kind of liked me
Is that so hard to imagine
No, its easy
How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans
don't know
: Anita Ekberg holds the kitten on
: Charlotte gets up to pour more sake
She picks up and looks at a prescription bottle on his night stand and reads the label : Lipitor
Do you remember when we met at the bar
You were wearing a tuxedo
But the first time  saw you was in the elevator
Really
Yeah, you don't remember
She shrugs
Did  scowl at you
No, you smiled
don't remember
know,  kind of blend in here
: the view of Tokyo at night as we hear their conversation: (
) Why do they switch the r's and l's here
(
) don't know
My fax said "have a good fright"
(
) Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun
(
) Ok, whatever you want
(
) Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi
(
) No,  was looking at you
(
) Oh
Well
they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road
(
) got a fax today from your friend Hiromix
(
) Oh, for her show
(
) No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show
(
) Oh
(
) You're possessive
(
) know
: Charlotte and Bob lie a few feet apart on the bed
(
) 'm stuck
Does it get easier
No, yes, it does
Yeah
But look at you
Thanks
It does, the more you know who you are
you don't care about things the same way
just don't know what 'm supposed to be
thought maybe  wanted to be a writer
but  hate what write, and  tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre
and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet
You'll figure it out
'm not worried about you
Keep writing
But, 'm mean
That's ok
And marriage, does that get easier
It's hard
We started going to a marriage counselor
Did that help
Did you learn anything
We established that we have no communication
Oh
We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all
She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me,  feel like 'm in the way
It gets complicated when you have kids
that changes everything
That's too scary
When they're born its like Vietnam
It's terrifying
(getting tired) No one ever tells you that
But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you
That's nice
My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much
Where'd you grow up
In
, my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years
but we mostly lived in
, and they were never around
and then  moved to Los Angeles when John and  got married
it's so different there
They are starting to get tired
know
John thinks 'm so snotty
You are
know, but that's what you like about me
She looks over at him
He does like her
Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together
Because that would be too easy
They fall asleep dressed, on top of the sheets, on opposite sides of the bed
: - Full of life, Bob plays basketball with some local guys
All over the court, and towering over the other players, Bob dominates the game
: '   - Bob looks at himself in the bathroom mirror, he feels his stubble and sees that it's turning grey
He opens the hotel shaving kit
He squirts shaving cream from the child-size can
Even the razor is small
He covers his face with shaving cream when the phone rings
Hello
Mr
Harris, we have fax for you
Ok
Do you want  send it to your room
(sarcastic) Great
Thank you, Mr
Harris
He hangs up and shaves
: - Bob gets out of the elevator- the Suntory group is waiting for him
He ducks behind a wall and sneaks out a side entrance of the hotel
- Bob comes out of the hotel into the sunlight
The street is crowded with   going by, one waves a big flag
Bob watches the strange scene in the street for a moment, and then makes his way past
: - He walks down a little street in a more old-fashioned neighborhood
He's wearing new techno sneakers
He makes a call on his cell phone
Miss Kawasaki
It's Bob Harris
'm not going to be able to do that interview today
, yeah
ok
Yes, 'd love to stay to be on his talk show
sure
ok
bye
light rain starts as he looks at a fax from Charlotte with a map she's drawn and tries to figure out where he is - there are no street signs
/
- Bob finally finds the small restaurant
The automatic door opens for him, and Charlotte, at the bar with the cute chubby , turns to Bob happy to see him
He is disheveled from the rain and adorable
He sits down next to Charlotte, she pours him a beer and orders for him
You made it
They really have to work on that street name thing
perky recording voice says "Kornichiwa
" from his pocket
What's that
He pulls a pink Hello Kitty watch from his pocket
It's for my daughter
How old is she
Four
Oh, she'll love it
The Sushi Chef gives him perfect little pieces of sushi on a banana leaf
Charlotte takes a bite of a piece - but it won't break, so she has to stuff the whole thing in her mouth, embarrassed
Bob makes fun of her gracelessness
Nice one
(mouth full) Fuck off
They have lunch, he makes her laugh
He looks down at her feet in flip flops, her toe is purple
What happened to your toe
don't know,  think maybe  broke it
knocked into something the other day
She slips her shoe off and shows it to him- her middle toe is black and blue
That doesn't look good
She enjoys the sympathy
It's bad isn't it
We should get you to the doctor
You think so
Yeah, look at that thing
She smiles at him
: - Bob tries to get a taxi, finally one stops and they get in
He tries to explain "hospital", he does pantomime, draws a first aid cross, but the  doesn't understand
Charlotte is enjoying Bob's effort
Finally he finds a Park Hyatt matchbook and calls the hotel number
How do you say "hospital" in Japanese
(
) Excuse me
Hospital
(
) One moment, please
She transfers call, it rings
(
) Concierge desk, may  help you
Yes, can you tell me how to say "hospital" in Japanese
"Hospital" in Japanese
Hosupitari
Hosupitari
He tells the Driver who looks at him funny
Bob says it again- faster, with a Japanese accent
The driver nods excitedly and drives off
: - Bob and Charlotte walk in, looking around at where to go
Bob talks to a woman at the desk to explain what they need
: 2ND  - Bob takes a seat in waiting area as Charlotte goes into a little room with a number on it
Bob waits next to a 100 year old lady
: - Charlotte stands alone barefoot on a little box, wearing a lead apron, as a  and  -ray different angles of her foot
: - Bob looks around at all the Japanese gift stuff, and buys a little stuffed bunny
His phone rings as he's paying for it
Hello
(
) Bob, it's me
Oh, hi, Elaine
(
) So, we got you on an earlier flight, but  really think you should think about staying for that talk show
Ok
(
) You'll do it
Yeah, 'll stay
: - Charlotte's foot -rays are displayed on a big light box
An older  talks about them in Japanese to his younger as he wraps Charlotte's toes together
She doesn't know what they're talking about
- Charlotte comes out where Bob waits with the little stuffed bunny
Is that for me
: - Bob and Charlotte arrive back at the massive hotel, they stroll in casually, she is carrying the stuffed rabbit in her arm
: - Bob reclines in the big Japanese wooden tub, steam rises as he is turning red
His phone rings
He dries his hands quickly to reach it before it stops ringing
Hello
(
) Bob
Hi, Lydia
(
) Is this a bad time
Uh, no
(
) (
) It's really hard to reach you
Did you get the carpet samples
like the burgundy
Ok, whatever you think
'm lost
(
) It's just carpet
That's not what 'm talking about
(
) What are you talking about
don't know
(
) Is there anything  can do
don't know
want to be more healthy
want to eat better
(
) What
You know, eat healthier
(
) Alright
Not all that pasta
(
) Fine
Like Japanese food
(
) (sarcastic) Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday
Oh, come on
(
) have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, 'll talk to you later
Are you going to be Ok
Yeah, 'll be fine
Bye
: - Bob rides in the back of a cab
(
) (voice-mail message) Hi Bob, it's Charlotte
how are you doing today
'm going to meet Charlie and those guys at this place called Orange around ten
come meet us if you get this
: - Bob's cab pulls up at an empty office building
- Bob looks at a fax from Charlotte with a map, wondering if he's in the right place
It's quiet and looks like a generic office building
He goes in the little metal elevator, and the door opens on the 8th floor onto a little nightclub you would have never thought was there
: - Lights strobe and Peaches' seedy "Fuck the Pain Away" booms through the speakers
Tan   with platinum hair dance and hang from a pole on a little platform
Bob sits alone on a brown ultra suede couch feeling out of place and empty
He looks over at a table of young
He wishes he wasn't there, but tries to seem comfortable
Charlotte shows up with Charlie and the other guys
She sits down next to him, and gives him an 'are you going to kill me
' look
How long have you been here
He looks at her like it's been forever
She smiles for forgiveness
They look over and see a   in the corner getting a lap dance, they look at each other, sharing the joke of the place, but both uncomfortable about the sexuality of it
Through a beaded curtain, Charlie and Bambi get lap dances in a dark corner of pillows
Charlotte looks at Bob
'mon, let's go
: - Bob and Charlotte go up to a cab, but the driver refuses them
They don't know why, but just make their way down an empty side street
Little plastic cherry blossom decorations hang above them
Where's your husband
(like she's said it a million times) Working
Do you ever see him
(sorta) Yeah
Do you know where we are
No
She puts a coin in a vending machine and takes a cold sake "one-cup"
tiny brad Pitt head smiles at her next to an iced coffee
Isn't it weird there are no street names in Tokyo
you'd think a city like this would have street names
you need a map to get anywhere
look, there are no signs
They keep walking, small figures on a little empty street
: - As they make their way back, they pass a lounge off the lobby
It's late, it's pretty empty,  a housekeeper vacuums and just a   sits in the back of the lounge, and a snuggled up romantic   sit close to: Kelly, the blonde actress, singing to them
She stands facing them with a karaoke mic singing "Nobody Does It Better" with all her heart
Bob and Charlotte look at each other and keep walking (trying to be invisible)
: '   - Charlotte lies in bed
She picks up a photo next to the bed as she dials the phone
- The picture is of her and John on their honeymoon
The phone answers - it's a weird Japanese recording
Um
Hi, John, if this is your phone
'm not sure
'm going to go to Kyoto for the day
'11 try you when  get back
Hope it's going good
love you, bye
- Charlotte watches the Japanese countryside go by out her window
- Charlotte walks through a beautiful garden
She's a small figure in the landscape
She approaches a temple where she stops to watch a wedding procession
young bride and groom in traditional kimono walk under a parasol with their family
Charlotte looks as- the nervous, young bride clutches her mother's hand
The young groom walks along with them
Charlotte is moved by the whole scene, the beauty of the temple and the wedding party
Her eyes well up
: She walks up a narrow path, surrounded by red maple leaves
At the top of a little hill, she comes up to a shrine
At its entrance she sees a tree covered in little white pieces of paper tied to its branches
She sees Japanese people writing on the paper and tying them to the tree
Charlotte writes her wish on a paper and ties it to a branch
: - Exciting music plays as the talk/game show starts
Bob, in an elegant suit, goes out to meet the
(in Japanese) We hear you're quite a golfer
translates
(nodding) enjoy the sport
The Translator translates - four sentences longer and with added enthusiasm
After a few questions the Host excitedly announces something to the  in Japanese
They scream, the lights flash, Bob has no idea what's going on
cloud of smoke reveals the  , with feathered hair, wearing an 18th century waistcoat
large red chef hat is placed on Bob's head
They now have the competition for you with the Iron Chef
Bob looks around as a counter is pulled up to him and now Bob and the Iron Chef are at dueling counters
The Host barks instructions in Japanese, an apron with a stuffed animal lobster on it is tied around Bob, the crowd cheers - there's no way out
: - Bob rides in the back of the presidential, looking out the window at the city
He pulls a polaroid out of his pocket and looks at it
It's Charlotte, peering over her shoulder with a little smile, from their sake-drenched night at Nobu's compound
- Melodramatic '70s Japanese music plays
Bob sits alone, hating himself, at the bar
The redheaded Jazz Singer takes a break, and a seat next to him
: '  - In the harsh-morning light, Bob wakes up in his bed
He hears the Jazz Singer singing in the shower "Midnight at the Oasis"
Her red mane of hair passes frame as she ushers in room service
She seems to have taken over the whole room
He wants it all to go away
She walks off to the bathroom and there's a knock at the door
Bob rushes to get it before she can
He opens the door a crack, Charlotte looking sweet, is standing there
Her hair is back in a pony-tail
Bob's just wearing a towel around his waist, and his hair is sticking up
Rough night
He's not in the mood, he looks at her like he already hates himself, doesn't need more help
'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around
Yes, but no,  can't right now
The singer starts singing again in the background
Charlotte gives Bob a look
Oh,  guess you're busy, huh
don't want to be
He watches Charlotte walk away down the beige hall
: - Bob is walking down the crowded street looking for Charlotte, when his cell phone rings
Hello
(
) Hello, Bob, it's me
(can't hear) Hello
(
) It's Lydia, your wife
couldn't hear you
How are you
(sighs) Fine
Is it going ok
It's ok
(
) Do you want to- (garbled) What
(
) Do you want to talk to  Zoe
Yeah
(
) (calls in background) Zoe, come say hello to your father
little girl's voice shouts "No
" in the background
(
) guess she's busy
That's ok
(
) When are you coming home
Tomorrow
(
) Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget
Ok
In the background the daughter calls for her Mommy over and over and a dog starts barking
(
) Ok, well, travel safely
See you soon
Bye
: - Charlotte, with sunglasses on, leans against the wall as Bob approaches
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock
Did you know that
No, we'll find something around here
She goes with him
: - Bob and Charlotte are seated at a big booth in a corny Shabu Shabu restaurant
The Jazz singer
The red-head
Bob looks at her like- don't make it worse
Well,  guess she's more around your age
You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties
You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention
She scowls at him
The waitress brings them drinks- she pours beer slowly, and turns on a pot on the table to cook their food
Charlotte looks at the menu - it is filled with photos of different trays of meat
The waitress doesn't speak English
can't tell the difference
They have trouble ordering, but point to a picture on the menu
We'll have two of these
He makes some small talk, she is bugged
What do you want to drink
coke
He orders the drinks
So, where'd you go today
Around
"This is the End" by The Doors starts playing on the stereo
The waitress brings two huge trays of sliced raw beef
Steam rises from the pot on the table
The song ends, and another Doors song comes on
They're not going to play the whole album, are they
They look across the table, over the steam and meat, at each other- the whole thing is awful
: '   - In the darkness, under covers, Charlotte is woken up by a loud fire alarm
: - The fire alarm booms as the hotel guests and staff hurry out of the hotel
Amidst the crowd of Hotel guests in their pajamas, Charlotte finds Bob- he's wearing a kimono and slippers
She's in boxer shorts and an undershirt and slippers
'm sorry
That lunch was the worst, huh
He laughs
She looks down at his feet stuffed into the little hotel slippers
When are you leaving
Tomorrow
(friendly) 'm going to miss you
That's what you said the other night
Well,  mean it more now
: - and Charlotte, still in their pajamas, sit at their usual spot at the bar, with the bartender, drinking cold sake
She lights two cigarettes and passes one to him
is now playing
The  is full of enthusiasm as they start their stint at the Park Hyatt
Good Evening
'm Carl West, and we're thrilled to be joining you this week, here at the  bar in Shinjuku
He sings "Where or When" with all his heart
Now, old-timers there, Bob and Charlotte look at each other and chuckle
Jt seems we stood and talked like this before,   we looked at  each other in  the same way thenr   but cant remember where or when
Bob and Charlotte sit there together
don't want to go back tomorrow
know
But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime
Why can't it last
don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things
we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band
(alt Charlotte dialog:  don't know it just doesn't, reality changes things
and we can't stay here forever) He looks over at her
The singer continues Where or When, as they sit there together, the view sparkling
(
) Somethings  that happen for the first time,   seem to be happening again and so it  seems we have met before, and laughed before,   and loved before,   but who knows where or when
: - Bob and Charlotte, drunk in the elevator
54
He nods, she pushes 54 for him and 56 for herself
They look at each other across the empty elevator, both leaning against the walls
The elevator stops at 54, he leans in to kiss her good-night
They kiss like you would on the cheek- but it's closer to their mouths
The door shuts- he missed his floor
The elevator continues up, and stops on her floor
They kiss good-night again and she gets out before the door closes
He watches the door close on her as she makes her way down the long beige hall
: '  - fax comes through the machine in the empty room
'        - ,
" : - sexy   asks Bob for a light
He looks at her great legs as he lights her cigarette
He looks around, keeping an eye out for Charlotte
The group of commercial people arrive to see him off
He excuses himself for a moment and goes to a phone on a little table in the corner
Bob picks up the house phone
(
) Hello
Yes
Hello, can  have room 5601
One moment
Traditional Japanese music plays on hold
will connect you
Bob gets the room voice-mail
Uh
Hi, Charlotte
it's me, Bob
ok,  guess you're not there
wanted to say good-bye
He hangs up, feeling lame
: - Bob with his bags tries to call again
The commercial people and hotel staff crowd around to help him, asking about his stay
Charlotte
Hi, Bob
'm just leaving
do you have my jacket
Uh, yeah
'll bring it down
That'd be great
Ok, see you in a second
member of the hotel staff brings him an envelope on a little silver tray
Miss Kawasaki gives him some gifts from their company in traditional Japanese wrapping, he doesn't know what to do with them and has to carry them
The Executive Woman from the bar walks up to him
He hangs up the phone
0hr hi
You're leaving
She looks at him like, we could have had some fun
Yeah, yeah, 'm going
He sees Charlotte come out of the elevator
have to go, thanks, bye
He rushes over to Charlotte
She looks at his bag
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave
Yes, no
She hands him his jacket
Thanks
She waits for him to say something more
He wants to tell her he loves her, that she should come with him
That's it
The concierge tells him his car is here
You're leaving right now
Yes
Well
have a good flight
Thanks
(hurt) Ok, bye
She walks away
hotel manager asks Bob about his luggage, another asks if he had a pleasant stay
Charlotte gets in the elevator to go out, the doors close on her back
: - It's bright outside the main entrance
presidential pulls up and the automatic door opens
Bob squints as the Bellboy in white gloves slowly loads his luggage into the trunk
- In the backseat, Bob leans back on the little doily
The car pulls away
Around the corner, he looks down a crowded alley and sees Charlotte's blonde hair
Can you pull over a second
The , wearing white cloth gloves, pulls the car over slowly
Bob tries to open the door'99 it won't open, he has to wait for the automatic doors to open for him (slowly)
- Bob gets out and rushes down the street to where he saw Charlotte
The street is crowded with  , and different colored umbrellas, (it's sunny out with a light rain)
Music blasts from speakers on the street, and there is some promo going on with  handing out little cologne samples
Bob looks around for her, but only sees dark hair, umbrellas, and super tan
In the distance an umbrella moves to reveal Charlotte
But she can't hear him over the loudspeaker
He rushes to her
she turns and we see she is crying
The music swells
He embraces her, holding her close to him in the crowd
Why are you crying
(sincere) 'll miss you
He kisses her, hugs her good-bye
know, 'm going to miss you, too
He holds her close
: Charlotte watches Bob as he reaches his car, he turns and looks at her
She smiles at him, and is lost in the crowd
Bob gets into his car
: Charlotte walks with the crowd as they go on their way
: - Back in the Presidential, alone, Bob leans against the little doily
They drive off
He looks out the window, Bob's happy he's going home, he's happy he came to Tokyo
Bob's
-  Tokyo goes past his window
