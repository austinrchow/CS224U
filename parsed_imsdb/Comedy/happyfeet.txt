The mommas are bringing fish soon
Long pause What's fish look like
You'll see it when she brings one The baby penguins are  now

It was dreadful out there
Over ' shoulder, she sees the infant Mumble - towards them
But who's this

Mumbles feet start to tap involuntarily, Then he catches his dad's warning look
Did she get one
Did she bring one back
Just a little krill that's all Can  see it
Later, bud

But isn't he just a darling

Mom and dad were working so hard  didn't see much of them
Besides  had school to go to
An efficient, caring  is giving a lesson to a class of about thirty young chicks grouped in front of her
Settle class
Settle
We will begin with the most important lesson you will ever learn
Now does anyone know what that is
flippers go up

Don't eat yellow snow
True but, that's not it
Mumble
Swimming
Catching Food
Anyone else
Mumble looks astonished
What's more important than that It's our Heartsong, Miss
Your Heartsong
Yes
The melody you hear inside, the thing that makes you different from every other penguin
So
Let's all be very still now and listen
And when you hear your song, let it come out
Who's first

Me

What have you got for us, Ella
(sings) Voulez-vous coucher avec moi
ce soir
(laughs) That doesn't make any sense
Well Mumble
perhaps you can do better Mine is more sort of a
He hesitates, as if listening to something in his head
Then, he sings  , like a drum solo
(') Bim bam-a-loolah a bim bam bom You heard that in there
Mumble is still going
and  from the class
You like it
Dear, that's not even a tune
It's not
No, a tune is like

(sotto) It's bizarre
don't understand it
Did anything happen - you know
- during early development
No
All fine
Normal incubation, wasn't it honey
Wishful shuffles guiltily
Well Yeah, it was a kinda
a tough winter guess, and he did hatch a little late, but
(at a loss
) Is there really nothing we can do
() 15
: Of course there is
Thats why we have Mrs Astrakhan
' Some distance from the creche,  stands with , a Russian-accented remedial teacher

Rubbeesh
Every little pengvin has a sonk

Closink the eyes
Liftink chin
Deep breathe here in the downbelow
Now
most important part, find a feelink
Happy feelink, sad feelink, maybe lonely feelink
closes his eyes
(') So
So
'm thinking
Don't think
Feel eet
Through the whole body, from the beak right down to tippy-toes
Her voice is seductive, hypnotic
(') And then slowly, very slowly
She hears a strange  sound and looks down
(') Vhat
Vhat is this
What
() 16
: The feet
The jiggy-jog
Don't do eet
Do not move muscle
Rigid like plank, like board Now
calm
Remember the feelink
Feelink

And be spontanuous
Once again his feet start twitching uncontrollably

Forget the body, look inside the soul
No notes, no sonk, only feelink
Happy feelink
Sad feelink
Enormous feelink, so enormous it fills the whole body
It must escape or you explode
Now, open your leetle beak
Mumble opens his beak, inspired
(') Yes, yes, lift up the head
That's it
() 17
: (2) Mumble inhales, his eyes are shining, his body is shaking
(') You take a big breath, good and
now
Now
He's off again,
wild, exuberant, totally uninhibited and unselfconscious
After some time, he remembers himself, stops and turns to the Mrs Astrakhan who is    against a lump of ice
(') Disaster
Catastroff
never fail
Never
Follow Mumble as he wanders alone, back towards his class
He stops some distance away, listening to the other kids who are now performing with increasing virtuosity
Ella is among them, her clear high voice borne to him on the wind
Mumble sighs and his little shoulders sink, no way he'll ever be able to sing like that
Its tough when you realise you'll never fit in
Plus  was beginning to moult piece of downy fluff is peeling off one wing (') couldn't face the class in this mood So just kept going
Music over: Walk on By as he wanders through the vast colony head down against the wind, little feet padding over the ice, Gradually the colony begins to thin
(') Looking for what
don't know different type of penguin
The noise of the colony has faded behind him
He stops and looks up
() 18
: (') And that's exactly what  found
Before him, a wasteland of discoloured ice covered with broken eggs and bits of feather
There are very few penguins here and the ones he can see are all, frankly, weird
Penguin walks in an endless figure of eight muttering to himself
Another has his flippers wrapped tightly around himself like a straightjacket
troubled Penguin sings angrily
"There's no business like show business
on Mumble
As he looks back to the sanctuary of the colony and then back out over the wasteland Not the nicest place in the world but at least you could do what you liked here
Fade in Music: ('m Free by the Who) and Mumble is off, skittering over the rubbish strewn ice, little feet dancing to his hearts content until
a shadow passes over him and Whump
a huge  , twice Mumbles size, with a cruel flesh-eating beak, lands on the ice right on front of him
Hey, whacha doin' dere flipperbird
Me
Oh, nothing
What are you doing

Hey, break me off a piec'a dat

(unimpressed) Nope

(') Ok boys, for once we gonna do dis civilised

Mumble has noticed a around the Skua's leg
Hey

Interesting you should ask

True

So - You think  could appeal to your better nature
Nice try kid
But No
() 22
: (4) He opens his beak wide as  stumbles backwards and falls into a narrow  in the ice
(') Hey
Whatcha think ya doin' down dere flipperbird
Get back up here dis minute
The other Skuas move in to help
cowers in the as they spear at him with their beaks
Come on, out witcha
Ya sneaky-ass flipperbird
They can't get hold of him
Frustrated, they turn on the , squabbling and whacking each other with their wings

Hey, Don't peck me or 'll peck you and when  peck you know you've been pecked
(fade) watches from the safety of the crack as they fight and argue viciously among themselves () Compared with that, school almost seemed like fun stands some distance back from where the other young penguins are taking school lessons

As he watches, the cloud morphs into something that resembles a
Then morphs again into

Then into the shape of an upright  with bulging eyes and tentacled hands

: Time passed
We all grew up As the class transforms into moulting adolescents (
) But right up to graduation  never did find my heartsong Dozens of
their coats almost fully moulted to reveal the sleek, shiny black and white feathers underneath
They stand in a group talking excitedly until the lead penguin, Caruso, walks up and everyone falls silent Graduates, today you leave the safety of our community for the first time, forsaking the trusted solid ice for the terrible magic of the deep
() Caruso
He couldn't help himself
Things are not as they were
For five years now we have known nothing but famine
But you are our hope
Upon your survival depends the very future of the entire Penguin Nation
Dive deep, swim far
May the Great Penguinus go with you
And remember
With solemn gravity,  throws his flippers into the air and shouts
Excelsi-yah
Yah yah yah
Excelsi-yah
Yah yah yah

Follow Mumble as he returns to his parents
In his adult plumage he's distinguishable by a small birthmark, like a bowtie on his chest and a small tuft of down on his head which has not yet moulted off
Music Over: Schools Out by Alice Cooper Dad, Ma, can  go with the others puts a protective flipper around her son
- don't know Wishful
still don't think he's ready
Dad
'll learn to sing later
'll find my voice out there
In the deep
Truly
Glancing round he sees the class moves off en masse across the ice
heading for the sea
(') Dad
Pul-eeeze
Wishful leans forwards, pulls off Mumbles tuft with his beak
(') Yeooow
On you go then, buddy Thanks Pop
See ya Ma
He races off, Norma  calling after him: (calling after) Remember `Stranger Danger'
Never talk to a seal
Mumble turns to wave, falls over, gets up and races on after the others with his strange hippity-hop little gait

: Watching from a distance, Norma  wipes away tears (') Oh my
Stupid
'm sorry
Wishful pats her comfortingly (quietly to ) You think we'll ever see him again (Shrugs) Its out of our flippers high shot reveals the miles of frozen ice that the have to cover to get to the sea
Some are shuffling along on their feet; others are tobogganing
long way behind them we see the lone figure of racing to catch up
The juvenile penguins stand in a bunch, peering down looking for somewhere to dive in
What do you think, here
Are you kidding
How about over here then
They shuffle off in a group to a nearby spot
That last place looked better
agree
Much better
They all shuffle back to the previous spot and stand there, frozen by indecision then again
() 26
: Suddenly the little dark figure of  barrels through the pack, yelling Outta my way flipperbirds
Coming through
For a long moment he's airborne
Then
he hits the water with a strangled squawk
and disappears
What was that
Mumble
They tentatively crane over the edge
No sign of him
They peer into the water
Lunatic
where did he go
See any blood
Then
shoots out of the water like a missile
Whatcha waiting for
It's fantast
(splosh) as he falls back under water again
Go Mumble
Without hesitation  follows him
The others follow
few at first, then all of them en masse leap yelling and hollering
/ The penguins flounder around, flapping, laughing, and choking had an instinct 'd be good at this
Actually we all were
We were the best
27
Transformed into creatures of grace and exuberance, they swoop and dive trailing plumes of bubbles
Over this: the music of
"Suntanned bodies and the waves of sunshine
Those California girls and the beautiful coastline
In the warmed up weather, let's get together and do it again
" Two  shoot up through
Skidding out of control, they , ending up in a breathless heap on top of each other
Mumble
Ella
They scramble to their feet
but the ice is slippery
They clutch together, slipping and sliding
Woah
've got you
No  don't
Leaning against each other, they manage to stand up, close now, eyes meeting
(') Yes  do
brief moment then
Hi Ella

: (
) The only bad thing about being with Ella
It was always so darned crowded
As others pop up all around Ella
Where da get to
there you are
Laughing, she dives into the water
The young males follow her
hippity-hops to the edge and tumbles in after her
half dozen of them gambolling together, their bubble trails intertwining
"In the warmed up weather, let's get together and do it again
" Then everyone freezes as a few silvery  swim past
They all zero in
Collisions, barging, a bit like water polo when the ball is first thrown in
In an instant

You get one
Not this time

Sorry Show's over
(To mumble as they walk off) Treat em mean and keep em keen () () 37
: (2) (') hold back `til the season, when they begging for it
(calls after them) Yeah guys, in your dreams You see
Some penguins got it, some don't And the Amigos, (in unison) They punch and bump each other playfully
you think  could get some of it
Hombre, you got so much already, you dangerous
He touches Mumble and recoils as if burnt Yow
You really think so
You got the biggest personality of any of us
Except for me, maybe
Put that ego away, Ramon, you gonna hurt someone
Music over: Carlos Santana's "Oye Como Va"
(
) So for a while  forgot about finding a song altogether
The Adelies and Mumble form a conga, weaving in and out of the nest builders, aiming a kick here and there at their industrious brethren 38
We were a team the Adelies swoop and dive, corralling a    into a
The fish, darting to and fro are suddenly confronted by Mumble's
Mumble shares out the catch there was so much to do, so much to see Mumble and the adeles come shooting down a long curving Slippery dip Arriba
Addidas amigos
As they shoot off the slippery-dip and into the sea mumble whacks his head on the edge of the ice The Adelies shoot back up to the surface
Mumble sinks, slightly dazed, watching the kalaeidescope patters of the surface recede
Music Over: "Ground Control to major Tom" Where's the tall-boy thought he was with you
They jump back in to look for him 39
Mumble keeps sinking, down down down into a great cathedral- like space, lit by eerie shards of underwater light
stuff down there beyond my wildest imagining
Imbedded in the base of the glacier, the rusting remains of, An    projecting out of the glacier
It hangs there, inscrutable, like a great yellow totem
Mumble, dwarfed by it, contemplates it for a while, then ventures inside, into the body of the
rusting steering column, a perforated dashboard
He pecks at the metal, trying to taste it, listening to the sound it makes
In the shimmering space outside the bulldozer, the congregate
You sure he went in there
Mumble
Done go near it, looks like it can bite One of them smims closer to the great jaws Ramos
Mumble pops his head out from between the jaws Oh
There you are Terrified the Adelies scatter and shoot to the surface like missiles
(') Guys
want to speak to you
40
The Adelies are heading back to their colony as fast as their little legs will carry then
Mumble Hippity hops after them Forget it We're not going back there Never But its dead
It can't hurt you Maybe its got a brother still alive
But that's what we have to find out
Don't you see
Things like that could be eating the fish
The idea is so stunningly original it stops them in their tracks
Okay
Okay
Here's the plan: we go and ask the revered one
The who
Reverend Loveday
The One who Knows First we gonna need stones though Why stones
Wait for me ' and the   are bunched together, near the head of a   of Adelies each with a stone or in their beak
At the head of this queue stands  - guardian of a huge pile of pebbles
His head pokes through one of the rings a -   festooned with seaweed like a () 41
: group of Soul singers, mainly female, sway in the background, singing a soulful song of adoration as the Penguin ahead of Mumble steps forward
First, the devotion
The  adds his pebble to the pile
holds up a flipper for silence and a hush falls over the gospel choir (') moment
(composing himself) and your question
Senor Loveday, My wife is one of the Disappeared ones Tell me is she alive
Loveday hyperventillates, his eyes roll up in his head The Mystic Beings are speaking to me
Yes
She is alive and happy and you are in her thoughts
But is she with another male
One pebble, one question
Next
The  push  forward
He is at least a head taller than the others
(') sense
you are the one with the question
How does he do it
He just one look and he know
Mumble places the pebble on the pile
long Pause little nervous
That's normal
Take your time
() 42
: (2) In fact Mumble is mesmerised by the luight catching 's six pack holder
He bends forwards to study it more closely was wondering
Have You ever been abducted by Aliens
No time wasters
Next
Senor
That's not his question
He's new here
(prompting Mumble) The yellow thing Ask him what's taking the fish
(ignoring them) you see  met a Skua once, with something like that on his legs
Skua
Leg
What's he talking about
and he said he was abducted by Aliens
(starts to wheeze and cough) Listen friend, this is my Sacred Talisman, bestowed upon me by the Mystic Beings
Looks like they bestowed it very tight
during my Epic Journey of Enlightenment to the Forbidden Shore
So these Mystic Beings, did you see them
hear them
They talk to me all the time am their instrument
They chose me to
() 43
: (3) Did they have frontways eyes
No feathers
Fat flabby faces
Did they probe you and stick a pointy thing into you
Enough
How many questions is that
You don't have enough pebbles
Yeah, one pebble, one question
We've all got stuff to ask, pal
But  haven't had any answers yet
The Mystic Beings are speaking
They say show some respect stranger
Especially to the One who Knows
hush falls over the gathering
(') The reason there are not enough fish is simple: There is not enough love in the world
Love is the answer
One cue the gospel choir start singing: All you need is Love (') (over this) Okay, everybody, turn around to the penguin next to you and give them a great big hug
Comeon, everybody
hug
This is a safe place
The gathering hug awkwardly
Mumble, because of his towering height, has trouble embracing the Adelie next to him
(') Now
The Mating Season starts today so here's what everybody should do: go forth and multiply
If you'll excuse  myself must retire for a moment to the couch of indulgence
okay ladies, who's gonna be first () 44
: (4) and the  are jostled aside in the  of as the gospel group break ranks and mob him Me Loveday
Me
No Me
One at a time
And don't touch the Talisman
liked him better when he was just plain Pedro
Did he say it starts today why didn't someone tell us
We gotta get to work guys
They start posturing for the any  they can attract Hola Baby
Get your chica boom-boom here
Turn round, look at us
couple of females look up from the scrum How many rocks you got
Forget `em honey
They only one between the six of them
and they just spent it
(getting desperate) Wait
Look
The Adelies all start  , but it is too frenetic, too desperate
You like it Arriba
What do you need stones for () 45
: (5) Try sitting on the ice for a month
It might come to you Salsa Boy
Come on, Consuela
Rejected, the Amigos stop dancing
Their loss, guys
Ramon, where you going
Ramon is  frantically for
Gotta be some rocks left here somewhere
(to Mumble) Hey big guy, got any love stones over where you come from
We don't collect them
All we have to do is , well
We sing Easy as that
So why aren't you over there
Mumble looks at them
Then opens his beak and demonstrates: La la la la la la la laaaaaaaaaaaaa
(to each other) What's he doing
Its a distress call Its world music Get out of here
See
That's how  ended up with you guys
And emperor who can't sing isn't an emperor at all
Man

Leading off
We'll all come
Yeah  like em tall
You jus' gotta do exac'ly as  say
It is autumn, the   for the mating season
It is just like the   we saw at the beginning of our story
Males and females sing their Heartsongs
And stands out from all the others
Where
once sang, stands , now sleek and fully mature
Gathered around her in a semi-circle, a half a dozen adoring
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi
Suddenly she becomes aware of a overlapping hers
It has a curious bossa nova rhythm
Tall and tanned and young and lovely The Girl from Ipanema goes walking And when she passes each guy she passes goes `Aaaah' Ella turns to see: a  backlit by the sun, standing on a little rise, just as  did
Ella recognizes those
Could this be
She moves closer to investigate
(') Oh, and  want her so badly How can  tell her  love her
Yes  would give my heart gladly () () 47
: (') But each day when she walks to the sea, She looks straight ahead not at me
" Mumble
Tall and tanned and young and lovely
(overlapping) Hi Ella, what do you think
Ella, suspicious moves to one side
Mumble moves to block her view
She moves further tound and sees: Hola bonita
Obviously he's been singing while Mumble mimes Mumble, that's just cheap She turns and heads off
The Adelie starts after her
Wait up
You and me baby, we can make sweet music
may be short but 'm a love god
Ooww
Mumble smacks him with the back of a flipper and goes off after Ella himself
Ella
Wait
She stops
He takes her by the shoulders Shes upset
(') 'm sorry
(shakes her head, tearful) When you left without saying goodbye thought something had happened, then thought he just doesn't care
() 48
: (2) Don't care
never stopped thinking about you
And then when  saw you singing, for a second  thought
can't sing
know
know
Its impossible
She walks off
But 'll show you something better He  an up-tempo, syncopated rhythm on the ice
(') Sing something to this
(her back to him) What's the point
It's embarrassing Just try it
This once
Ella begins to hum Never Can Say Goodbye ironically and without conviction
(') Okay, that'll work
Just keep it going
The singing  joins in
acapella, very rhythmic "
turn around you fool You know  love you more and more

Framed between the Adelies, Mumble strikes a pose, holds it for a moment
then lets rip
He

They know all the moves and it is are beginning to tap, couples are beginning to improvise

Now  is caught up in it This is it Ella
This is the song inside me

Caruso turns to the rest of the emperors () 50
: (4) It is exactly this kind of disrespectful, heretic behaviour that has brought the Scarcity upon us
Don't you see
we are being brought to account by the Forefathers
The kid was never quite the full Penguin
It all began the year he hatched
That's right
He's the one who brought the blight
(astonished) Wait
Wait
You think it's my fault that there are no fish
Doing Happy Feet can't cause a food shortage
then what did
My own opinion
think living beyond the ice there are creatures we've never met before Aliens
Mystic Beings
Big, flabby
(pushing in) He has abandoned the faith
He has driven the fish away
(protecting Mumble) Come on hombre, loosen up, the tall guy was just trying to
Don't touch me

Ella chases after him
Wait
Mumble
Catching up with him Its no use Ella
can't live with that
Can you live without it
He stops
() 52
: (6) (') believe in you, Mumble
But without the huddle we can't make an egg
Without the egg, what are we here for
True That's a big question Guys
Can Me and Ella be alone for a bit The Adelies give them space (') Here's what 'm going to do
'm going to talk an alien
'm going to find what's causing the shortage But what about
Its the only way
You're right
Unless we have food theres no future for any of us - you, me the adelies, anyone But
Give me a year, just until the next great gathering
If  don't make it back
at least  tried But
Now go back

Mumble and the Adelies have put the colony far behind, trekking homewards Tell me again where we're going
To find the mystic beings
How do we know where they live
We'll ask Loveday
He's been there
Most of the Adelies are sitting on nests
The Adeleies and Mumble trek past them a protective mother takes a peck at them
Not so close
We got babies on board Wow
Does nesting make em touchy () 54
: They find  at the back of what is left of his He sits leaning against it
exhausted

kicks a bunch of pebbles at him
Just one question
And  want a straight answer
Where do  find the Mystic Beings

His eyes bulge
He's possessed
It's a seizure
No
He's choking
The Talisman's gotten way too tight
Why din' you say so
Hold on we gonna take it off
You pull that side,  pull this side
They tug at the -
Stop
You're hurting him
The Adelies back off

: (2) Any better
gives a little `so-so' gesture with his flipper
It not gonna come off
Of course it's not
It's sacred
, where did you get it
It was bestowed on him
By the Mystic Beings
shakes his head sadly
They didn't bestow it on you
Poor Guy
He don't know what he's saying
If it wasn't bestowed, what happened
mimes swimming
Oh, this one's easy
He swam
On his Hectic Journey of Delightenment
To the Forbidding Shore
And then
mimes the talisman going over his head
Well to me that's gotta be bestowing
shakes his head, `no'
He stretches his neck
You looked up and
It just got caught around your neck

No
He's the revered one He speaking symbolically
hangs his head
slides down his beak

Really
Beaten,  shakes his head `No' The Adelies are stunned into silence

And if we find them, they could take it off

(') So where do we Go, Loveday Loveday Then he makes a strange "Oi, Oi, Oi" sound
Oh my
Now he thinks he's an Elephant Seal nods and points towards the mountains

The forbidden place is over the mountains

is lagging behind, breathing hard
Even  and the  are puffing with the effort of the climb
Music Over: He aint heavy he's my brother
Stop
Enough
We must've gone past it Past
Don't kid me
We're not even close
Then on the wind comes a fiant `Oi, Oi, Oi'
Hear that
As they crest the peak, sure enough, down below: the  of the
Thousands of them
Refresh my memory do elephant seals eat penguin
No, no
jus' krill and fish
Sure of your facts are you
Not waiting, Mumble launches himself over the other side, slip-sliding down the mountain
One by one the follow
Well  guess we're about to find out The beach is literally heaving
and the  come tumbling and sliding right up to two
() 58
: 1 (big-bellied, booming southern voice) Well roll me over and call me a dugong
What the heck have we got here The Adelies bunch up behind Mumble Excuse me, we need directions
to the Forbidden Shore
2 Sure
Just git yourselves over them there hills 'd come with you myself but
1 Woah Woah
You aint told em half of it: over them hills, beyond the great glacier, `n' through the blizzard country
The Good Ole Boys are into -
1 (') Anyhow
Its its forbidden to go there
2 heard its forbidden to ask how to get there
We're looking for the Mystic Beings 2 Mystic Who
Aliens, the ones who made this

1 Blizzard Walkers
Cut you up soon as look at you

: (2) 2 Cut you up before they look at you
Could they be taking our fish
1 Could be
heard they'd take a whole penguin, rip its skin right off and turn it into mush
2 Huh
That's a Picnic
hear tell they'd take a baby seal and club it to death
With their bare clubs
1 Huh
Clubbing's a Clambake
My Granpappy says they been known to skin a seal from snout to tail in a hot second
2 Your Granpappy don't know squat
What hear they take your sorry carcass, melt you down, burn you up, take your fur `n' fat and turn you into a wide variety of useful items
1 The hell with "useful" Those critters'd y turn you into a food item
Little popsicle things
Ya hear me
One day you're a big ole whale and the next minute,
But If your grandpappys saw them and they survived, maybe they're not so fierce
#1 You calling me a liar son
#2 He's calling your grandpappy a liar
And you know what, Maybe he's right
#1 Why you
Flop over here and say that
They start fighting, lunging and flopping on each other () 60
: (3) Come on Loveday, lets go (running to catch up) Go where
didn't you hear what he said Its Forbidden They don't know
They've never been there Stop
'm hearing voices
The mystical guys
They say: "Your life is perfectly good as it is
forget this stupid mission"
and  keep trekking
Ramon
That was embarrassing, man
And reluctantly, he trails after them
As do
Oh no, don' do this to us
'm a lover not a fighter The first sign of Popsicles or funfood of any kind,  turn round and go back ,  and the  are tiny specks, struggling over a series of great ridges
So we walked
and walked
and kept walking
Over the hills and into Blizzard country breakes over them
screaming wind brings total -
The Penguins have to shout to make themselves heard
Oh man
This is no place for a penguin
We should be migrating out to sea by now
() 61
: We need to huddle
Huddle
Form a moving circle
Share the cold, share the warmth
He turns his back to the wind
Immediately the Adelies form a down-wind from him
Oh yeah, nice
That's definitely better
Good call big guy
said a circle
They form a little huddle, but as soon as Mumble moves from the upwind position, the Adelies complain
No, no
This can't be right
It was better the other way
They scurry back into a straight line behind Mumble who cops the   of the
He gives up and marches off into the driving snow
Hey
What happened to the Huddle
(shouts back) Just keep moving
Toboggan, if you have to
The others lie down, propelling themselves forwards on their fronts Oh no, now  got chest pain tell you, this is a good way to get snow blind () () 62
: (2) (') just keep moving or you'll get my beak up your butt The blizzard has passed
An eerie stillness
One by one the Adelies get to their feet and waddle forwards to where Mumble and Loveday stand, gazing into the distance
They have finally reached the sea again You think this is it
The Forbidden Shore
chokes out a `yes'
The way  feel": the "frostbitten" shore So what are those black things
Close to the waters edge, the outline of several buildings The  venture through it, dwarfed by the old flensing- sheds, the chimneys and boiling-vats
Its all now abandoned, and half concealed by snow
Around and above them, there are , , rusting twisted
Hello
Is there anyone out there
An ominous  as some rusting metal plate moves in the wind
(') Hello
No need to shout
Yeah, somebody might hear you
think we seen all there is to see round here
is looking at something at his feet
() 63
: What is it
There, imbedded in the ice: another six pack holder
Mumble and the Adelies venture out onto the weak ice beyond the whaling station, finding more and more of the strange artefacts: a piece of nylon rope, a soda can, a boot
They must be here somewhere
They wouldn't leave all this stuff lying around
Maybe they invisible
They've reached the edge of the sea-ice
croaks a warning
He points out to sea
What is that
has appeared on the glassy surface of the sea
It is coming towards them,  like the bow wave of an whale
As long as it's a good whale, not the other kind
The wave is coming
What other kind
massive    breaks the surface
The ones with teeth
The  are off and running
() 64
: The   keeps coming like the blade of a demonic carving knife
Then the monstrous fin disappears and
The killer whale breaches the ice  of them, cutting off their retreat
They are left stranded on a free-floating Jump
Swim for it
No
Stay on the ice pad where its safe The little floe is wobbling crazily You call this safe amigo
Maybe we should split up
You split up 'm staying right here
The   breaches again, rising like a tower block out of the ocean
(') Woooaaaahhh
The   flips, flinging them into the water like a handful of peanuts
The  head for shore , swimming for their lives
, thrashing and wheezing, is unable to keep up
(stops) He swims back
The   is about to take them both in one bite
pulls  aside, but he's not quite quick enough: one of the Whale's outer teeth catches by the -  and he is  , tethered to the   like Captain Ahab

and  scramble onto the ice exhausted
Wondering where the next attack will come from, the huddle nearby
Suddenly the     and the   soars right over the top of them It hits the water but does not stop, just keeps going right on out to sea
The Penguins have no time to reflect on their good fortune
Theres an    behind them
Turning they see a vast  , a hundred feet high, coming at them through the fog
The  flee across the ice
stands transfixed by the    towering above him
On the deck he sees Aliens
The pack-ice is    ahead of the (') Stop
Please
From a safe distance the  stop and look on in amazement as Mumble stands his ground, shouting up at as it advances towards him
(') It's very important
The  beneath his feet  , Mumble topples into the gap and The    , huge propellers churning, leaving a channel ninety feet wide
resurfaces
() 66
: (') He chases after the ship
chase after Mumble

Already the ship is half a mile away
Beyond the last of the ice floes is  ' hurls himself onto it and starts scrambling up its precipitous sides
follow, struggling to keep up
's :     has joined   about a mile away
The Adelies join him
You found them, you found Aliens
Now we go back tell everybody who's taking the fish
Mumble's     eyes remain fixed on the horizon
(') Don't feel bad Tall Guy
They were just too fast
Too big
Too everything
They've stopped
Mumble
owe you my life amigo
And say this because admire and deeply respect you
If you are thinking what  think you are thinking
You are out of your crazy head Say Hi to Ella for me () 67
: You say Hi
Come back and say Hi to her yourself Mumble turns, takes a few paces back
Oh
One other thing
You guys What
Suddenly,  turns to the precipice and runs as fast as he can
Excelsi yah
As he launches himself into space
The tiny penguin soaring off the top of the
rush to the edge as, far below Mumble And vanishes
can you believe that brought us all this way and killed himself no he didn't
look
Far out he has surfaced and is swimming strongly in direction of the
(') dive like that, and still he lives
Yeah like when he did his Happy Feet, his feet had wings
normal penguin could never have done it
You don't think we should go with him Don't sweat it Revered One
Many are called, few are chosen
() () 68
: (') Hey, how tall you think the Tall Guy was
Who could say
Four times my height at least
Loveday follows behind About this Revered One stuff, you guys Yeah Maybe just call me Pedro a rolling sea: towering waves block everything from view but on the crests he catches sight of
, far ahead, but stationary, as if waiting for him
He's getting closer
The ships are only half a mile away when Something rises from the deep, threatening to engulf him: a ,
Mumble shoots out of the way, just avoiding being caught as
The great     breaks the surface of the water and is winched on board
(yells) '
As if in response the ship's    again and the sea around him erupts in churning foam
Swamped by the wake, Mumble goes under
When he resurfaces, is already on its way
() 69
: (') ' - He takes a deep breath and resumes his pursuit
The  are
There is no sign of the ship now, nor of land
swims up the side of each wave, over its foaming crest and down into the deep dark valley below
The air is full of spray
Choking,  ducks under the water
Its peaceful here
Then something moves beside him and turns with a start to see:
entirely fills his field of vision
It sings a few booming Wagnerian notes
Its voice is almost deafening
Too loud
He surfaces, spluttering
(') Too loud
calls to him from above
Mumble looks up
An hovers overhead
He's looking for a mate, mate
And these days,  tell you they're few and far between From the ' aerial view, Mumble looks tiny next to the   of the Blue Whale
() 70
: (') Talking of which,  never seen a penguin this far out
Watch you don't hit The Convergence mate
The Convergence
Where the cold water meets the warm, mate
Once you cross it, there's no getting' back
What you tryinmg to prove anyway
'm trying to talk to the Aliens
The who
On the black iceberg
The ones taking all the fish
Them
Fish is just the start of it Mate
Them aliens is the ones who took out the whales
They kill whales
That's impossible Straight up mate
Biggest creatures ever lived
Decimated, mate
So if  wanted to talk to them, where would  go Anywhere and everywhere
Over the sea, under the sea, Jees, 've even seen them fly
The great southland's swarming with em Where's that
Do you think the Whale would take me there
() 71
: (2) The Blue Whale responds with a long mournful "---" which the Albatross does not need to translate
No way mate, he won't go anywhere near `em
And neither should you
Mumble hesitates, bobbing on the water, weighing the warnings
He makes up his mind and strikes out again swimming towards the convergence
The Albatross, hovering on the wing, watches
(') Don't say  didn't warn you The  wheels away
As  fights on through the huge choppy waves, the Whale's Wagnerian song booms out,  and
We see from above, the   turning as well, changing course to avoid a change in the texture and colour of the water stretching in a line, as far as the eye can see swims
is a mere  now as the   capture him and sweep him away
We pull back through the clouds until the very is visible: a blue horizon with no land in sight
On the - , amongst the rubbish and the oil slick, we see what looks like a dead animal
It is
creature in   approaches
Its small hand reaches down and nudges him with a stick
moans and the gumboots  , shouting something unintelligible
With great difficulty, Mumble raises his head to try to see more
Sunlight flares, bleaching to white, as he 72
Scientific books and specimens of birds in large bottles on shelves line the walls
, eyes closed, is lying on a stainless steel table
He opens his eyes to the brilliant glare of an examination lamp
There is movement around him
Voices whispering in an alien tongue
bends over him cleaning the oil from his feathers with detergent
squawks
() When  finally saw one, the Alien was even more hideous than 'd imagined very pretty   is smiling down at him
() (') frontways eyes, no feathers
Big teeth with blood around them
Strange fleshy beak
meat eater (') (terrified) The - fish - are - ours
Understand
But all the  sees is a squawking penguin
(') We can't live without them
The  produces a syringe and squirts some of it's contents in the air
(') Speak Adelie
Skua-talk
Another  holds him still while the needle is administered
(') Oh no
Not the pointy thing
Drowsy now, he is eased into a
The close the lid, and secure it with straps
We hear a feeble thumping from inside
() 73
: Pull back to reveal Mumble's box on a shelf among crates and luggage
Fade in engine noise over as
747 drones across the screen, eastwards into the night
woke in darkness
Unable to move
Was dead
And if  was dead, where was that light coming from Like the light at the end of a tunnel
As if in a dream, ambles towards it
Emerging into Bright  , sparkling
Wow
They brought me home His voice  back at him, with a mocking edge
There is something unusual about this place
plump penguin waddles by (') Excuse me, where are we
Heaven
Where d'you think
Oh
So we're dead
Right Dunno
Don't care
We got food
We got water
You hear a seal now and then, but you never meet one
Perfect
Mumble is looking around, trying to figure it out (') Fish
Where
() 74
: fish hits him on the head
moment later he's knocked flat by a sudden rush of : Chinstraps, Rock-hoppers, Adelies, King penguins, emerging from holes in the rock face Fish time
Fish time
Lying on his back he sees fish tumble from the sky
It's () Every day after that, it rained fish in the afternoon
His , Load after load of fish tumbling out of a clear sky Fish hit the surface and sink (
) Fish on land and fish underwater
Mumble pursues one of them
Sometime you got a live one but there was nowhere really to chase it He swims   into a sheet of thick glass are pressed against it
Mumble yells and shoots to the surface
High up he sees the viewing gallery
great  of staring and chattering (
) Aliens everywhere, watching you eat, watching you sleep Mumble backs away and knocks into the
He puts out a wing to steady himself and notices a metal tag on it
This place is beginning to upset him
() 75
: (yells at the aliens) What have you done to my wing
This is not my home
want to get out of here
The other penguins stand around, immobile, chomping fish
Guess he's new here Caption:  year later Specators : Mumble stands around, like the others, ignoring the aliens, chomping fish His : Day after day, the view constantly the same, except for the groupings of spectators high in the viewing Gallery (
) After a while, you learn to stop fighting it
Stop protesting, take the knocks
Mumble:  camera flashes
fish hits him, he doesn't flinch (
) just take what comes and live inside your mind / Another day and another
Night follows day follows night
Spectators come and go
The penguins stand like statues
Though bubbles begin to appear above Mumbles head, snapshots of his past experiences (
) Sometimes  thought about dad and mum
Sometimes the Amigos, and others 'd met along the way
But mostly  thought about Ella, wondering who she ended up with
Whether she had enough food to eat
whether she still remembered our song
In the though bubble, Ella has appeared singing never can say goodbye
Mumbles feet begin shuffling to the rythm 76
Most of the specators are leaving but one young girls stops and stares Look Mommy
It's dancing
She bangs on the glass in her excitement
Mumble, woken from his reverie, looks up and sees her looking at him
What
What did  do
The little girl who is pointing at mumbles feet
Mumble looks down, realizes what his feet are doing, looks up again
(') You like that
Well how about this
He does a more elaborate step
The Mother shouts in disbelief
Various other specators come back and join her
Mumbles fellow captives are unimpressed
#1 Oh-Oh, another one gone troppo #2 You think its infectious #3 sure hope not They shuffle away The aliens, in contrast, are loving it
Already a crowd has gathered, laughing and clapping
The Gallery is packed
Mumble keeps dancing 77
Theres a riot going on up there
People fighting to get a view
Newspaper reporters,  cameras
The other penguins in the enclosure have moved back, giving Mumble more space
Every specattor is focussed on him
Mumble is focussed on the spectators
( Yes
Yes
At last something was happening
was finally getting through to them
squawking Mumble is thrust inside and the lid slams shut on him
Kerchunk
Silence, then across the vast expanse a   appears on the horizon
/' What's that
Where
Coming from the Inland
couple of Penguins watch the approaching figure
Is it a Penguin
Is it one of ours
Mumble approaches the two sentries
The colony is much diminished: only small groups scattered here and there
Hi, where is everybody
Who wants to know
used to live here
When's the Great Gathering
() 78
: This is it
guess This is all that's left
Other penguins are gathering to scrutinise the stranger
So Who's this
Kinda small for an emperor
(suspicious) Where did you say you were from
Then a female penguin bursts out of the crowd
Mumble
Its Mumble
Ella
Is it you
You haven't changed a bit
As he speaks, his eyes are drawn to the huge number of following behind her (') Are these all yours
They're my singing students
So
You never
Of course not
was waiting for you
But that's fantastic
've got so much to tell you - to tell everyone
(To the gathering crowd) found out who's been causing the Scarcity
Huh
() 79
: (2) know who's been taking our fish
made contact with Aliens
They're coming here
Right behind me
Listen
They listen
Above the wind   faint electronic
Who's doing all the shouting Its Mumble
He's worse than before
No, honestly Aliens will be here soon
You have to believe me
We came in a big hollow bird and they landed on the ice and
bursts through the crowd
You again
And still full of the same old nonsense
But its true
The  is quite audible now - a little faster and louder
Curious, Ella ambles round behind mumble tro see what's making the noise Move along everyone
Pay no attention
There's no such thing as aliens So who fixed him up with this
She turns him around to reveal some kind of circuit board glued to his back: a small aerial, winking red lights gasp of fear and astonishment from the penguins
Caruso is momentarily speechless
Does it hurt
Its not made of feathers thats for sure what's it gonna do () 80
: (3) It's so they can find me
(cocks an ear) That's them now
Listen
distant rumbling, like some monstrous cataclysm is approaching You led them here
Are you crazy
You said they didn't exist
They'll slaughter us
Head for the sea
No
Do this
Do Happy feet
He starts tap dancing
The penguins are torn, between Caruso's instructions and Mumbles
Its what they understand
They can't talk, they can't sing
They speak with their feet
Do it
few adventurous souls begin to copy him, out of fear if nothing else
As they do so, the sky begins to darken
strange whirling wind starts whipping the snow around them
The very earth seems to be shaking under them
Now look what you've done
its the end of the world
Its all Mumbles fault
told you Wishful rounds on them angrily
Just do what the kid says
They start dancing
() 81
: (4) Caruso has climbed a small hillock and is ranting like an old testament prophet Recite the wisdoms
"Together we stand"
"Divided We Freeze"
Mumble and Ella are dancing through the community Come on, everyone
Happy Feet
It's our only chance
"When all others leave, we Remain The tide is beginning to turn in his favour (') That's it
Excellent
Riba Riba, penguinos
Shake those hips
Come on, bust a move
Adhere to the wisdoms
The Ancients will protect us As he shouts his he is blown off his feet by a tremendous gust of wind Caruso tumbles head over heels as a massive Chinook helicopter rises over the hirizon, its massive rotors mashing the air
It swoops down over the penguin nation and lands a little distance away
Music Over: Wanna Dance with Somebody
() 82
: (5) Now the entire emperor community are dancing for all they are worth
Aliens
never doubted it for a moment Mrs Astrakhan dances past More feelink
Wishful dances over to her, his eyes on Mumble and Ella (dancing) You know who that is
That's my boy
(dancing) Know him
He ees my star pupol
scientists disembark
Skidoos are kicked into life
We     across the - to the colony Scientists : As they stop, lower their hoods and gaze in astonishment
One of them lifts a video cam to record , () From that day on, No one quite knows how it happened, but the black icebergs began to disappear and the fish became abundant once more
Suited figures are seated round a large table, watching as of the    play on a video screen
Without the music it's less obviously a dance
So what do you reckon
() 83
: Yes, quite extraordinary
(stares at the screen) some kind of neurological disorder
a nutritional deficiency perhaps
We'd certainly back the long-term study
And the international treaty
#1 Yes
This is exactly the leverage we need for an embargo
No fishing whatsoever
legal, illegal, sanctioned, whatever
#2 So we all step up policing of the pirate factory ships
And we pressure that country to stop their so-called `experimental' fishing
#3 Yes, if our government asks your government to approach their government to call off their fleet
#2 Better if their government hear it from our government via your government
What the heck
The amount of publicity this is generating, they'd have world war three if they didn't stop
In the confusion of penguins we find ,  and their chick (
) Ella's gave up teaching to look after our chick
We take turns looking after her and going to get the fish
As we watch, Ella moves off, joining the great to and fro of penguins along the highway to the sea
() 84
: covers his chick protectively, watrching his wife walk away
(
) worry about her, sure
Theres so much big stuff out there it can be kind of frightening
We are pulling back now, back from the colony, back from Antarctica
(
) But the way  see it
Theres so much out there we don't understand
, Still pulling back the stuff you think is small stuff could actually be the big stuff
Keep pulling back from the world, the solar system,       the galaxy
(
0 Or am  not making sense here
Further back
Our galaxy is framed in something like a bomb- sight
#1 Is there a problem
thought this one was barren
We`re somewhere otherworldly, inside a clear dome the size of a stadium, with a view of the heavens
In the centre of this space, always just out of shot, two illdefined figures are talking, subtitled: #2 More or less
But one of the stars we're harvesting supports these things here
Projected somehow in mid-air  3- image of Times square in winter with tiny people milling around in black coats () 85
: #1 So
#2 Well
Exactly
But what we didn't know about before was these things here An image of the dancing penguins appears
#2 (') Just thought you'd want to see them before
you know
The shadowy figure laughs, enjoying the image
#1 Hmm
Charming #2 So
We go ahead
Or
#1 No
Better leave them be
See what sector twelves got to offer instead
The bomb sight moves away from our galaxy to another part of the universe With that the two figures head off across the great shadowy interior
The projector beam catches them, briefly, throwing up the giant shadows of these aliens They look very like huge penguins
As they walking solemnly out of shot with their hands behind their backs one of them breaks step to do a little jig
