When the wind's at your back And the sun's from the west And the sand in the glass is right Come on down, Stop on by Hop a carpet and fly To another Arabian night
Arabian nights Like Arabian days More often than not Are hotter than hot In a lot of good ways Arabian nights 'Neath Arabian moons fool off his guard Could fall and fall hard Out there on the dunes
Ah, Salaam and good evening to you worthy friend
Please, please, come closer--(Camera zooms in hitting peddler in face) Too close, a little too close

)  Ah, still good

hurries to catch it
)  Wait, don't go
(Stop pan
) can see that you're only interested in the exceptionally rare
think then, you would be most rewarded to consider
this
( pulls the   out from his sleeve
) Do not be fooled by its commonplace appearance
Like so many things, it is not what is outside, but what is inside that counts
(Another pan, this one slower to left
Again,  rushes to catch up
)  This is no ordinary lamp
It once changed the course of a young man's life
young man who liked this lamp was more than what he seemed
diamond in the rough
Perhaps you would like to hear the tale
( pours shiny sand from the lamp into his hand
)  It begins on a dark night ( throws sand into the sky, where it forms a starry nightscape
) , where a dark man waits, with a dark purpose
(Camera tilts down to find  sitting on his horse and on his shoulder
comes riding up to the pair
) :  You
are late
: thousand apologies,  patient one
:  You have it, then
: had to slit a few throats to get it
(Pulls out half of the medallion
reaches out for it, but  yanks it back
)  Ah, ah, ahhh
The treasure
( squawks as he flies by and grabs the medallion
)  Ouch
:  Trust me, my pungent friend
You'll get what's coming to you
:   What's coming to you
Awk
( pulls out the second half of the medallion
He connects them, and the insect medallion begins to glow
Finally, it flies out of 's hand, scaring the horses, and is off towards the dunes
) :  Quickly, follow the trail
(All ride off, following the glowing speck of light, until it reaches a large dune
It separates into two and the halves plunge into the dune
All that remains are two glowing points of light on the dune
But then the dune begins to rise up, transforming into a giant lion's head, with the glowing points serving as the eyes
) :  At last, after all my years of searching,  the cave of wonders
:       Awk
Cave of wonders
: By Allah
:  Now, remember
Bring me the lamp
The rest of the treasure is yours, but the lamp is mine
( starts to approach the lion's mouth, which forms the entrance to the cave
He chuckles as he goes
) :   Awk, the lamp
Awk,  the lamp
(Now that  and are alone,  opens up in normal English
) Jeez, where'd ya dig this bozo up
( puts his finger to his lips and shushes him
reaches the cave, but is blown away by the roar of the cave's speaking
) :       Who disturbs my slumber
: It is , Gazeem, a humble thief
:       Know this
Only one may enter here
One whose worth lies far within
diamond in the rough
( turns to  with a questioning look
) :  What are you waiting for
Go on
( hesitates, then moves one foot inside the cave
With great apprehension, he plants his foot down
Nothing happens
Relieved, he begins his trek again
Then another roar comes
He turns back, but the lion's mouth slams shut and the dune collapses back to normal
All that are left are , , and the two separated halves of the medallion
) :       Seek thee out, the diamond in the rough
( unburied himself from the sand, coughing as he does so
) :        can't believe it
just don't believe it
We're never gonna get a hold of that stupid lamp
Just forget it
Look at this
Look at this
'm so ticked off that 'm molting
(He flies up to 's shoulder
) :  Patience, Iago
Patience
Gazeem was obviously less than worthy
:       (Extremely sarcastically) Oh, there's a big surprise
That's an incred-- think 'm gonna have a heart attack and die from not surprise
What're we gonna do
We got a big problem here,a big prob- ( pinches his beak shut
) :  Yes, we do
Only one may enter

diamond in the rough
(Cut to a rooftop, where  rushes up to the edge, carrying a loaf of bread
He almost drops it over the edge
) :  Stop, thief
'll have your hands for a trophy, street rat
:    (Looks back, then down, then at the bread
)  All this for a loaf of bread
(He jumps off, landing on two ropes strung between buildings, with drying clothes on them
He skies down them, collecting bits and pieces of clothing on him as he goes
Finally, he's nearing the end of the rope, at a window, when a woman reaches out and slams the shutters closed
slams into the shutters and falls to the street, his fall being broken by numerous awnings and the pile of clothes around him
He pulls off the top layer of clothes and is about to enjoy his bread when
) 1:    There he is
2:    You won't get away so easy
:    You think that was easy
(He looks at three women, laughing at him
) 1:    You two, over that way, and you, with me

He rushes over to the women
) :    Morning, ladies

The pair swing into a harem
) Oh, it's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom He's become a one-man rise in crime ( finds a plate full of fruit and stuffs his mouth full like a chipmunk

The door opens and a large, ugly  comes out

) :    Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat Otherwise we'd get along

(They all jump into a pile and fight
When they stop,  and are gone
They are sneaking away in barrels
They run across a flaming pit, followed by  who hop up and down, screaming in pain as they cross the rocks
and pass a  , then  goes back, pulls the sword out of the 's mouth
advances on the guards, who retreat in fear
) 1:    He's got a sword
2:    You idiot--we've  got swords
( sets the sword down gently, then runs

(The children giggle with delight
tries to swallow his bite, then looks guilty
He walks over to the children and offers his bread to them
In delight, they pet him on the head
) :        Ah, don't
Huh
( sees  walking into the daylight, where there is a parade going on
peers over the shoulders of people
He sees riding on a horse
) 1:    On his way to the palace,  suppose
2:    Another suitor for the princess
( is startled as the two children come running out from the alley
The  runs out in front of the 's horse, startling it
) : Out of my way, you filthy brat
(The  brings up his whip to attack the children, but jumps in front of them and catches the whip
) :    Hey, if  were as rich as you,  could afford some manners : Oh-- teach you some manners
(The  kicks  into a mud puddle
The crowd laugh at him
) :    Look at that, Abu
It's not every day you see a horse with two rear ends
(The  stops and turns back to
) : You are a worthless street rat
You were born a street rat, you'll die a street rat, and only your fleas will mourn you
( rushes the , but the doors to the castle slam shut in his face
) :    'm not worthless
And  don't have fleas
Come on, Abu
Let's go home
( makes the climb to his home with the view, then tucks in for the night
) :    Riffraff, street rat
don't buy that
If only they'd look closer Would they see a poor boy
No siree
They'd find out, there's so much more to me
(He pulls back a curtain to reveal the beautiful palace
) Someday, Abu, things are gonna change
We'll be rich, live in a palace, and never have any problems at all
(Dissolve to same shot during day
Cut to int
of 's chamber
The door bursts open, and   storms in, missing the rear end of his pants
) : 've never been so insulted
: Oh, Prince Achmed
You're not leaving so soon, are you
: Good luck marrying her off
: Oh, Jasmine
Jasmine
Jasmine
(The  goes off into the garden looking for his daughter
He finds her, but is interrupted by , 's pet tiger, who blocks him off
has a piece of the 's undershorts in his mouth
The grabs the cloth and yanks it out of 's mouth
) Confound it, Rajah
So, this is why Prince Achmed stormed out
:    Oh, father
Rajah was just playing with him, weren't you Rajah
( comes over and allows to pet and hug him
)  You were just playing with that overdressed, self-absorbed Prince Achmed, weren't you
(She cuddles with , enjoying the moment, until she looks up at her angry father
) Ahem
: Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting every suitor that comes to call
The law says you
:
must be married to a prince
(They walk over to a dove cage
) : By your next birthday
:    The law is wrong
: You've only got three more days
:    Father,   hate being forced into this
(She takes a dove out of the cage and pets it
) If  do marry, want it to be for love
: Jasmine, it's not only this law
(She hands him the dove, and he puts it back in the cage
) 'm not going to be around forever, and  just want to make sure you're taken care of, provided for
:    Try to understand
've never done a thing on my own
(She swirls her finger in the water of the pond, petting the fish
)'ve never had any real friends
( looks up at her and growls
) Except you, Rajah
(Satisfied, he goes back to sleep
)  've never even been outside the palace walls
: But Jasmine, you're a princess
:    Then maybe  don't want to be a princess
(She splashes the water
) : Oooohhh
Allah forbid you should have any daughters
( looks up and thinks for a second
goes to the dove cage and yanks open the door
The birds fly off into freedom
She watches them go
Cut to int
of 's chambers
) :  don't know where she gets it from
Her mother wasn't nearly so picky
( shadow falls over him
He looks up startled and sees
)  Ooh, oh
Ah, Jafar--my most trusted advisor
am in desperate need of your wisdom
:  My life is but to serve you, my lord
(He bows
) : It's this suitor business
Jasmine refuses to choose a husband
'm at my wit's-end
:   (In the parrot voice) Awk
Wit's-end
: Oh, ha ha
Have a cracker, pretty polly
(He pulls a cracker out from his pocket
looks terrified
Then the  stuffs it in 's mouth
grimaces as he tries to eat it and the  both laugh
) :  Your majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals
( glares at him
)  Now then, perhaps  can divine a solution to this thorny problem
: If anyone can help, it's you
:  Ah, but it would require the use of the mystic blue diamond
: Uh, my ring
But it's been in the family for years
:  It is necessary to find the princess a suitor
( says the word 'princess' with the accent on the second syllable, "cess
"  He turns his staff with a cobra head towards the
The eyes of the staff begin to glow
The room darkens, 's voice slows down and deepens
The 's eyes get a hypnotized look
)  Don't worry
Everything will be fine
: Everything
will be
fine
:  The diamond
: Here, Jafar
Whatever you need will be fine
(The  removes his ring and hands it to
The room returns to normal as  pulls back the staff
) :  You are most gracious, my liege
Now run along and play with your little toys
: (Still hypnotized)  Yes
that'll be
pretty good
( and  exit
We follow them
When they're out of the room, the parrot spits out the cracker
) :        can't take it anymore
If  gotta choke down on one more of those moldy, disgusting crackers
bam
Whack
( pulls a rope, which reveals a hidden entrance to his chambers
) :  Calm yourself, Iago
:       Then 'd grab him around the head
Whack
Whack
:  (Speaking over
)  Soon,  will be sultan, not that addlepated twit
:       And then  stuff the crackers down his throat
Ha ha
(The pair pass through a door and slam it shut
Diss
to ext
gardens at night
shadowy figure walks through
We see it is in disguise
She reaches the palace wall, then begins to climb it
She is tugged from behind by
) :    Oh, 'm sorry, Rajah
But  can't stay here and have my life lived for me
'll miss you
(She begins to climb again, and is helped up by , who begins to whine and whimper
)  Good bye
(She disappears over the wall
Cut to daytime on the street and  are up to their capers again
They are on top of the awning of a fruit stand
) :        Okay, Abu
Go
( dips over the edge and looks at the
) : (To passing crowd)  Try this, your taste buds will dance and sing
( grabs a melon and hangs there, distracting his attention
)  Hey, get your paws off that
:            Blah blah blah
: Why, you
Get away from here, you filthy ape
(He grabs the melon away from
But in the foreground, dips down and snatches another melon from the stand
) :            Bye bye
(He zings back up
The  takes the melon to the front, where he places it on top of a stack
He looks confused, like he has just done this
) :    Nice goin' Abu
Breakfast is served
( and  on the roof break open the melon and eat
We see walking through the street
) 1:   Pretty lady, buy a pot
No finer pot in brass or silver
2:   Sugar dates, sugar dates and figs
Sugar dates and pistachios
3:   Would the lady like a necklace
pretty necklace for a pretty lady
(She is charmed by the action, but is startled by a fish thrust into her face
) 4:   Fresh fish
We catch 'em, you buy 'em
:     don't think so
(She backs away, but bumps into a fire eater, who is startled into swallowing his fire
)  Oh, excuse me
(He gulps, then belches fire from his mouth
is disgusted
He is pleased and taps his stomach
sees her, and a strange look comes over his face
)  'm really very sorry
:    (He's obviously deeply in love with her
)  Wow
(She pulls the hood of her cloak over her head
sees him and jumps up on his shoulder, waving his hand in front of 's face
) :        Uh oh
Hello
Hello
( stops at the fruit stand and sees a young homeless child reaching for a piece of fruit
She picks one up and gives it to him
) :        Oh, you must be hungry
Here you go
(The boy runs off
) : You'd better be able to pay for that
:        (Mystified) Pay
: No one steals from my cart
:        Oh, 'm sorry sir
don't have any money
: Thief
:        Please, if you let me go to the palace,  can get some from the Sultan
: Do you know what the penalty is for stealing
(He takes her hand and pins it down on the table, intending to chop it off
) :        No, no please
(The sword drops, but his hand is stopped by 's
) :        Thank you kind sir
'm so glad you've found her
've been looking all over for you
:        (whispering) What are you doing
:        (whispering back) Just play along
: You know this girl
:        Sadly, yes
She is my sister
She's a little crazy
(He circles his finger around his ear
She is shocked
The  grabs him by the vest
) : She said she knows the Sultan
:        She thinks the monkey is the Sultan
( is picking a pocket
He hears this, then straightens up
, playing along, kneels and bows to
) :        Oh, wise Sultan
How may  serve you
:            Well, blah blah blah blah
:        Tragic, isn't it
(He leans forward, picking up another apple from the cart with his foot
) But, no harm done
(Walks over to Jasmine
)  Now come along sis
Time to see the doctor
:        (To a camel standing nearby) Oh, hello doctor
How are you
:        No, no, no
Not that one
(To , whose pockets are bulging
) Come on, Sultan
( bows to the crowd and everything he's stolen from the cart falls out
) : Huh
What is it
( picks up what he can carry, and the trio run off
) Come back here, you little thieves
(Cut to int
of 's lab
is running on a gear in a bizarre contraption
At the top of the contraption is a storm brewing
) :       (huffing and puffing)  With all due respect, your rottenness, couldn't we just wait for a real storm
:  Save your breath, Iago
Faster
(He places the 's ring in the contraption
) :       Yes, o mighty evil one
( runs faster
lightning bolt streaks through the ring, passing into an hourglass below
The sands begin to swirl
) :  Ah, sands of time--reveal to me the one who can enter the cave
(The sand in top forms the Cave of Wonders
It falls through into a storm, but it shows  climbing up a ladder, followed by who is covered in her cloak
) Yes, yes
There he is
My diamond in the rough
:       That's him
That's the clown we've been waitin' for
( loses his footing and is sucked into the gears
) :  Let's have the guards extend him an invitation to the palace, shall we
( goes flying past and slams into the wall upside down
) :   Swell
( laughs hideously, and the camera zooms in on the sandstorm with in it
Finally, we dissolve into the real  climbing to the top of the ladder, followed by
) :    Almost there
( climbs over the top, but trips and falls into 's arms
She stands up
) :     want to thank you for stopping that man
:    Uh, forget it
(He grabs a pole
)  So, uh, this is your first time in the marketplace, huh
( pole vaults to the next building, leaving  behind
) :    Is it that obvious
:    Well, you do kinda stand out
(He stares at her, still in love
She returns the look
But he realizes what he is doing, and returns to normal
) mean, uh, you don't seem to know how dangerous Agrabah can be
(He lays a plank between the buildings for her to walk over, but as he is leaned down, she vaults over his head
He looks back in surprise
She tosses the pole to him
Both 's and 's eyes bulge
) :    'm a fast learner
:    Right
'mon, this way
(They go inside the roof of a building, dodging planks and beams as they go
)  Whoa
Watch your head there
Be careful
:    Is this where you live
:    Yep
Just me and Abu
Come and go as we please
:    Fabulous
:    Well, it's not much, (he pulls back the curtain and exposes the palace) but it's got a great view
Palace looks pretty amazing, huh
:    Oh, it's wonderful
:     wonder what it would be like to live there, to have servants and valets
:    Oh, sure
People who tell you where to go and how to dress
:    It's better than here
Always scraping for food and ducking the guards
:    You're not free to make your own choices
:    Sometimes you feel so-- :    You're just-- :       (in unison) --trapped
(They look at each other, realizing that they're perfect for one another
But  then realizes where he is, and breaks the look
He takesthe apple out of 's hand and rolls it down his arm into the hand of
) :    So, where're you from
:    What does it matter
ran away, and  am not going back
:    Really
(He takes a bite from the apple in his hand, then hands it to , who has a disgusted look on his face
) :        Why you
( walks over and sits next to
) :    My father's forcing me to get married
:    That's--that's awful
( appears from behind the princess and tries to steal the apple
) Abu
( races up to a higher point, chattering and cursing as he goes
) :    What
:    Abu says that--uh--that's not fair
:        What
:    Oh did he
:    Yeah, of course
:    And does Abu have anything else to say
:    Well, uh, he wishes there was something he could do to help
:        Oh, boy
:    Hmm, tell him that's very sweet
( and  have been getting closer and closer, until leans in to kiss her
He is interrupted, however, by the , who have found them
) :  Here you are
and :    They've found me
(To each other) They're after you
:    My father must have sent them-- :    Do you trust me
:    What
:    Do you trust me
(He extends his hand) :    Yes
(She takes it
) :    Then jump
(They both jump off the roof, fall and land in a pile of salt
They try to get away, but the exit is blocked by a
) :  We just keep running into each other, don't we, street rat
(Again, the 's turban is pulled down by , but more guards are here and block the exit
The first  pulls  off his head and throws him in a vase
Three other  grab
) :  It's the dungeon for you, boy
:    Hey, get off of me
:    Let go of him
:  (Not realizing she is the princess) Look what we have here, men--a street mouse
(He throws her down
) :    (standing up and pulling off the hood of her cloak) Unhand him, by order of the princess
(The  suddenly stop and bow, forcing  to bow as well
) :  Princess Jasmine
:    The princess
:        (peeking out from the vase) The princess
:  What are you doing outside the palace
And with this street rat
:    That's not your concern
Do as  command
Release him
:  Well,  would, princess, but my orders come from Jafar
You'll have to take it up with him
(The  drag  out, bowing as they go
) :    (getting a very pissed-off look) Believe me, will
(Cut to int
of palace,  emerging from his secret chambers
He slides the door shut carefully, but the princess comes storming in before he is finished
He slams it shut, pinning  inside the door frame
) :    Jafar
:  Oh, uh, princess
:       Awk
Jafar, 'm stuck
:  How may  be of service to you
(He spreads out his cape, hiding the door
) :    The guards just took a boy from the market, on your orders
:  Your father's charged me with keeping peace in Agrabah
The boy was a criminal
:    What was the crime
:        can't breathe, Jafar
:  Why, kidnapping the princess, of course
:       If you could just--( kicks him back inside the door and it slams shut)--wow, that hurt
:    He didn't kidnap me
ran away
:  (Walking away as if shocked) Oh, dear
Oh, why frightfully upsetting
Had  but known
:    What do you mean
:  Sadly, the boy's sentence has already been carried out
:    What sentence
:  (with a sinister tone)  Death
( gasps
) By beheading
:    No
(She collapses to the floor
) :   am exceedingly sorry, princess
:    How could you
(She runs from the room crying
) ( finally makes it out through the door
He flies up and lands on 's shoulder, coughing
) :       So, how did  it go
:   think she took it rather well
(They both get a sinister smile on their faces
) (Diss
to  at night, crying at the edge of the fountain comes over to comfort her
She pets him
) :    It's all my fault, Rajah
didn't even know his name
(Cut to int

Aladdin
Hello

) :    Abu
Down here
Hey, c'mon--help me outta these

He wraps a cloth around his head and makes his eyes big in an imitation of the princess
) :    Hey, she was in trouble
Ah, she was worth it

) :        Yeah, yeah, yeah

But together, perhaps we can be more

:    But the law says that only a prince can marry-- :    You've heard of the golden rule, haven't you boy
Whoever has the gold makes the rules

) :    So why would you share all of this wonderful treasure with me
:     need a young man with strong legs and a strong back to go in after it
:    Ah, one problem
It's out there, we're in here

:    It is , Aladdin
:       Proceed
Touch nothing but the lamp

) ( begins to descend the staircase
He reaches the bottom and enters a golden chamber filled with treasure
) :    Would ya look at that
:        Uh oh
:    Just a handful of this stuff would make me richer than the sultan
( peeks out, sees the treasure, then bolts for it
) :    Abu
( stops in mid run, hovering over a rug on the floor
) :    Don't
touch
anything
We gotta find that lamp
(They begin to make their way through the room when the  rises off the floor and begins following them
gets the feeling they're being followed
) :        Huh

He continues, and the  begins to follow again
Again,  turns back, but the is rolled up and leaning against a pile of treasure runs to  and tugs his pant leg

Aladdin
:    Abu, will ya knock it off
(Again the  follows, but this time, when  turns, the carpet jumps to the other side
It reaches down with a tassel and pulls 's tail
When  jumps around,  again goes to the other side
This time,  lands in a karate stance

sits thinking for a second, until  waves a tassel in front of his face
and  both jump scared, and run away

He's not gonna bite
(The  again picks up 's hat and hands it to him

") :    Hey, wait a minute
Don't go
Maybe you can help us

It then flies over and wraps around the pair
)  Hey, whoa
You see, we're trying to find this lamp
( motions for them to follow it
)   think he knows where it is
(They pass through a long cave, until they emerge in a giant underground cavern
In the centre of the room is a tall pillar, with a staircase going up to it
It is surrounded by water with unevenly placed stones forming a bridge
At the top of the pillar is a beam of light
begins to cross the bridge
) :    Wait here
:        Oh
Huh

There is a rumbling and the room begins to shake
) : Infidels
:            Uh oh
: You have touched the forbidden treasure
( places the jewel back into the paw, but the jewel and the shrine melt into lava
) Now you will never again see the light of day
( races down the steps, but they flatten into a ramp, and he skies down until he flies into the air
The water has turned into lava
He is falling toward it, when all of a sudden  appears and catches him
is standing on one of the rocks of the bridge
He looks left and right and sees rocks exploding into lava
Then  races over and  grabs him, just as the last rock is exploding
) :    Whoa
Carpet, let's move
(Together, they race back through the caves dodging walls and falling debris
grabs 's head and covers his eyes
) :    Abu, this is no time to panic
(He pulls  off his head and sees they are flying into a wall
) Start panicking
( goes into a dive, then through another cave
Finally, they emerge through the internal entrance
Outside, the cave begins to growl and close
and company are almost to the top when a boulder drops on carpet, sending it to the floor
grabs onto the rock wall and holds on
He sees the   at the top, within reach
) :    Help me out

They fall

It struggles to break free, then does
It races up and catches , but he has already hit the wall several times, and is unconscious
On the surface, the cave roars one final time, then sinks back into the sand

No

) Nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen
Hi, where ya from

The sign changes to reflect the 's upcoming line
) Hello, Aladdin
Nice to have you on the show
Can we call you 'Al
' Or maybe just 'Din
'  Or how bout 'Laddi

) Sounds like 'Here, boy
'mon, Laddi
' :    (Shaking his head)  must have hit my head harder than  thought
:  (Still a dog) Do you smoke
Mind if  do

He tosses them to , who juggles with one hand and spins one of the heads on his fingertip like a basketball
He tosses the heads back onto the , who proceeds to try and pull himself out of a hat at his base
He spirals around and around until he turns into a white rabbit
The rabbit transforms into a purple dragon (very reminiscent of Figment from  Center)
The dragon breathes fire, which turns into three  , who dance around
Just as he begins to enjoy them, they disappear

) :  So what'll it be, master
:    You're gonna grant me any three wishes  want
:  (As William
Buckley) Ah, almost
There are a few provisos, a couple of quid pro quos :    Like
:  Ah, rule number one:  can't kill anybody
(He slices his head off with his finger
)  So don't ask
Rule two:  can't make anyone fall in love with anyone else
(Head turns into a big pair of lips which kiss
)  You little punim, there

:    (Looks at  as if plotting) Ah, provisos
You mean limitations
On wishes
(To ) Some all powerful genie--can't even bring people back from the dead
don't know, Abu--he probably can't even get us out of this cave
Looks like we're gonna have to find a way out of here-- (They start to leave, but a big blue foot stomps down in front of them
) :  Excuse me
Are you lookin' at me
Did you rub my lamp
Did you wake me up, did you bring me here
And all of a sudden, you're walkin' out on me

If it weren't for all your years of loyal service
From now on, you are to discuss sentencing of prisoners with me, before they are beheaded

: Jasmine, Jafar, now let's put this whole messy business behind us
Please
:  My most abject and humblest apologies to you as well, princess
(He takes her hand to kiss it, but she yanks it away
) :    At least some good will come of my being forced to marry
When  am queen,  will have the power to get rid of you
: That's nice
All settled, then
Now, Jasmine, getting back to this suitor business, (he looks and sees Jasmine walking out) Jasmine
Jasmine
(He runs after her
) :  If only  had gotten that lamp
:       (As )  will have the power to get rid of you
'oh
To think--we gotta keep kissing up to that chump, and his chump daughter for the rest of our lives
:  No, Iago
Only until she finds a chump husband
Then she'll have us banished--or beheaded
:       Eeewww
:       (Has an idea) Oh
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Jafar
What if you were the chump husband

:       Okay, you marry the princess,all right
Then, uh, you become sultan
:  Oh
Marry the shrew

The idea has merit
:       Yes, merit
Yes
And then we drop papa-in-law and the little woman off a cliff
(Dive bombs into the floor)  Kersplat
:  Iago,  love the way your foul little mind works
(Both laugh as we cut to an oasis in the desert, where  is coming in for a landing

Now about my three wishes- :  Dost mine ears deceive me
Three
You are down by , boy
:    Ah, no-- never actually wished to get out of the cave
You did that on your own
( thinks for a second, then his jaw drops
He turns into a sheep
) :  Well, don't  feel just sheepish
All right, you baaaaad boy,  but no more freebies
:    Fair deal
So, three wishes
want them to be good
(To ) What would you wish for
( is hanging like a hammock between two trees
) :  Me
No one's ever asked me that before
Well, in my case, ah, forget it
:    What
No, tell me
:  Freedom
:    You're a prisoner
:  It's all part-and-parcel, the whole genie gig
(Grows gigantic, voice echoes) Phenomenal cosmic powers

:  (Comes out of the ) But, oh--to be free
Not have to go "Poof
What do you need
Poof
What do you need
Poof
What do you need
"  To be my own master, such a thing would be greater than all the magic and all the treasures in all  the world
But what am  talking about, here
Let's get real here
It's not gonna happen
Genie, wake up and smell the hummus :    Why not
:  The only way  get outta this is if my master wishes me out
So you can guess how often that's happened
:    'll do it
'll set you free
:  (Head turns into Pinocchio's with a long nose) Uh huh, right
Whoop
:    No, really,  promise
(He pushes the nose back in and 's head returns to normal
) After make my first two wishes, 'll use my third wish to set you free
(He holds out his hand) :  Well, here's hopin'
(Shakes 's hand
) Let's make some magic
(Turns into a magician
)  So how 'bout it
What is it you want most
:    Well, there's this girl-- :  Eehhh

) Et tu, Brute
Ah, to make a prince
(Looks slyly at )  Now is that an official wish
Say the words
:    Genie,  wish for you to make me a prince
:  All right
Woof woof woof woof

Then becomes a tailor/fashion designer
)  First, that fez and vest combo is much too third century
These patches--what are we trying to say--beggar
No
Let's work with me here
(He takes 's measurements, snaps his fingers and  is outfitted in his prince costume
)   like it, muy macho
Now, still needs something
What does it say to me
It says mode of transportation
Excuse me, monkey boy
Aqui, over here
( tries to cover himself with , but  zaps him and he flies over
) :        Uh oh
:  Here he comes, ( and  are on a game show set, where  stands behind a podium with "" on it
)  And what better way to make your grand entrance on the streets of Agrabah, than riding your very own brand new camel
Watch out, it spits
( door bearing the 's head on it opens, where  is transformed into a camel
He spits out the side of his mouth on cue
But the 's not sure
)  Mmm, not enough
(He snaps his fingers and  turns into a fancy white horse
) Still not enough
Let's see
What do you need
(The  snaps his fingers repeatedly, turning into:  a duck, an ostrich, a turtle, and a '57 Cadillac, with license plate " 1
"   (That one's a guess,  don't know cars, but judging by the tail fins, 'nuff said
)  Finally, he's returned to normal
)  Yes
Esalalumbo,  shimin dumbo
Whoa
(And on the keyword of the spell, Dumbo,  turns into an elephant
struggles to get out from under 's size 46 feet
)  Talk about your trunk space, check this action out

The tree naturally bends right back down to the ground, where hangs on and looks at  upside down
) :    Abu, you look good
:  He's got the outfit, he's got the elephant, but we're not through yet
Hang on to your turban, kid, cause we're gonna make you a star
(We zoom out slowly with the oasis in the distance, as fireworks begin to explode outward
Cut to a  of a pile of toys
(Look for the  here
)  We tilt up and see the balancing them
He carefully balances the last piece on top, then sits back and sighs
storms in, though, and the pile collapses
) :  Sire,  have found a solution to the problem with your daughter
:   Awk
The problem with your daughter
: Oh, really
:  (Unrolling a scroll) Right here
"If the princess has not chosen a husband by the appointed time, then the sultan shall choose for her
" : But Jasmine hated all those suitors
(He tries to stuff a cracker into 's mouth
backs away
The  absentmindedly pulls the cracker back
)  How could  choose someone she hates
( is relieved, but the  quickly stuffs a cracker in his mouth
) :  Not to worry, my liege
There is more
If, in the event a suitable prince cannot be found, a princess must then be wed to
hmm
interesting
: What
Who
:  The royal vizier
Why, that would be
me
: Why,  thought the law says that only a prince can marry a princess, 'm quite sure
:  Desperate times call for desperate measures, my lord
(He pulls out the staff and hypnotizes the with it
) : Yes
desperate measures

)  What
What is that
That music

(Proud to work for him) They bow to his whim, love serving him They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali
Prince Ali
( throws gold coins out to the people, who rush over to collect them
and the parade march up the steps of the palace and inside
The  runs back inside to the door to the throne room, but  stands in front of the door
Suddenly, it bursts open, with  leading the way, and crushing and  behind the door

Watch it with the dumb rug
(The  zooms underneath , who sighs, wipes his brow, and crashes into a pillar
He crashes to the floor, and his head is circled by miniature  on , saying "Have a cracker, have a cracker
The real  begins his final approach

:   don't trust him, sire
: Nonsense
One thing  pride myself on Jafar, 'm an excellent judge of character

) : Jasmine will like this one
:    And 'm pretty sure 'll like Princess Jasmine

) This boy is no different than the others
What makes him think he is worthy of the princess

He squishes it, and the banana squirts into his eye
He then tosses the banana peel into a heaping pile of the same

) :    No
:    (Pokes his head up from over the edge) What

(She looks over the edge and sees the
) :    It's a magic carpet
:    It's lovely
( takes 's hand with a tassel
) :    You, uh, you don't want to go for a ride, do you
We could get out of the palace, see the world
:    Is it safe
:    Sure
Do you trust me
:    (She looks at him at the saying of that all- important line) What
:    (Extends his hand the same as before) Do you trust me
:    (Gets a sly grin on her face) Yes
(She takes his hand and gets up on
It zooms into the sky, knocking them both into sitting positions
The music of " Whole New World" swells
looks back and sees  looking up at her questioningly
She gasps as they fly over the palace wall and into the sky
) :     can show you the world Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me princess, now when did you last Let your heart decide
( zooms down through the town, stopping slightly to pick a flower
It gives the flower to , who gives it to
She smiles
) can open your eyes Take you wonder by wonder Over, sideways, and under On a magic carpet ride ( does as  sings, then zooms into the clouds
) whole new world
new fantastic point of view No one to tell us no Or where to go Or say we're only dreaming ( looks back and watches Agrabah disappear from sight flies in and out of the clouds
) :     whole new world dazzling place  never knew But when 'm way up here It's crystal clear That now 'm in a whole new world with you
:    Now 'm in a whole new world with you
(They each catch a small cloud as  continues the flight
It then circles a pillar of clouds, giving a swirly look to it
) :    Unbelievable sights Indescribable feeling Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling Through an endless diamond sky (They join a flock of birds in the sky
One of them looks terrified and squawks
does somersaults and flips, at times putting and  in free-fall, but catching them
They then zoom above the clouds where a starry night awaits them
) :     whole new world
:    Don't you dare close your eyes :    An hundred thousand things to see :    Hold your breath--it gets better
:    'm like a shooting star, 've come so far can't go back to where  used to be
(They zoom down over a river, apparently the Nile, for beyond the ship's sails are the Great Pyramids
They wave at a worker sculpting the complete nose of the Sphinx
He smiles, but chisels too much and breaks off the front section of the nose
) :     whole new world
:    Every turn a surprise :    With new horizons to pursue :    Every moment, red-letter (They fly alongside wild horses running
pets one of them
) :   'll chase them anywhere There's time to spare Let me share this whole new world with you whole new world That's where we'll be (They fly through Greece, where  grabs an apple from a tree and rolls it down his arm to , who is now sure she is dealing with , not
) :     thrilling chase :     wondrous place :       For you and me
( hovers along over a lake, and we see the reflection of the moon in the lake
Fireworks burst and we see the couple at a Chinese New Year celebration, sitting on a rooftop
) :    It's all so magical
:    Yeah
:    (She looks at him and decides to burst the bubble) It's a shame Abu had to miss this
:    Nah
He hates fireworks
( looks up realizing what is happening
)  He doesn't really like flying either
(And now  realizes it) That is
oh no
:    (She pulls off his turban) You are the boy from the market
knew it
Why did you lie to me
:    Jasmine, 'm sorry
:    Did you think  was stupid
:    No
:    That  wouldn't figure it out
:    No
mean,  hoped you wouldn't
No, that's not what  meant
:    Who are you
Tell me the truth
:    The truth
(He looks at  who wave him on, giving up hope
)  The truth
the truth is sometimes dress as a commoner to escape the pressures of palace life
( slumps down in defeat
)  But  really am a prince
(The feather on his turban falls down over his eyes
) :    Why didn't you just tell me
:    Well, you know, um
royalty going out into the city in disguise, it sounds a little strange, don't you think
:    Not that strange
(She flicks up the feather and cuddles with him
puts a tassel under his "chin" and looks mystified
Dissolve to ext
of palace balcony, where  and  return forms a set of steps and she descends
then descends just below the balcony
) :    Good night, my handsome prince
:    Sleep well, princess
(They slowly lean forward to kiss, but  bumps him up and they kiss sooner than expected
She walks away slowly then turns and looks at him
Finally she enters her room through the curtain
) :    Yes
(He falls back onto the , who descends to the ground
) For the first time in my life, things are starting to go right
(He looks up at 's balcony, and four sets of hands grab him
) :    Hey
What
( gag is tied around his mouth
Muffled words) Abu
Abu
(We see the elephant hanging from a net tied in a tree
) :  Hold him
(Shackles are placed on his feet and his hands
Another  ties in a knot around a tree
) :  'm afraid you've worn out your welcome, Prince Abooboo
(Walks away
)  Make sure he's never found
(  hits him in the head, and he falls unconscious
Cut to a cliff, where  laugh as 's body drops into the water
He is conscious now, but his feet are tied to a rock
The rock hits the sea bottom, then the turban lands and the lamp tumbles out
He sees this and struggles to rub the lamp
However, he loses consciousness and falls to the floor
The lamp, unsettled by his movement, rolls down and rubs against his hands
It shakes, and  emerges with a bath brush, rubber duckie, and shower cap) :  Never fails
Get in the bath and there's a rub at the lamp
(Squeaks the duck)  Hello
(Sees unconscious ) Al
Al
Kid, snap out of it
You can't cheat on this one
can't help you unless you make a wish
You have to say  "Genie want you to save my life
"  Got it
Okay

(He grabs  by the shoulders and shakes him
His head goes up, then falls
)  'll take that as a yes
(Head turns into a siren
) Wooga
Wooga
(Turns into a submarine
)  Up scope
(He babbles in something that sounds like German
On the surface, a giant water spout emerges, and lands on top of the cliff reawakes and coughs the water out of his lungs
) Don't you scare me like that
:    Genie, --uh, -uh
(He can't think of how to say it, so they just hug each other
)  Thanks, Genie
:  Oh, Al
'm gettin' kind of fond of you, kid
Not that  want to pick out curtains or anything
(Cut to  in her room, humming " Whole New World" and brushing her hair
The  appears in one of the double doors,hypnotized
) : Jasmine
:    Oh, father-- just had the most wonderful time
'm so happy
: (Still monotone from the hypnosis) You should be, Jasmine
have chosen a husband for you
:    What
: (The other door opens and reveals
)  You will wed Jafar
( gasps at the sight of him
) :  You're speechless,  see
fine quality in a wife
:     will never marry you
(She goes to the ) Father,  choose Prince Ali
:  Prince Ali left
( quick pan finds  standing in the doorway to the balcony
) :    Better check your crystal ball  again, Jafar
:    Prince Ali

:    Tell them the truth, Jafar
You tried to have me killed
:  What
(He goes to the )  Ridiculous nonsense, your highness
He is obviously lying
(He brings the staff close to the 's face
) : Obviously

( sees the staff with its glowing eyes
) :    Father, what's wrong with you
:     know
( grabs the staff and smashes it on the floor
flinches and the spell is broken for good
) : Oh, oh, oh my
:    Your highness, Jafar's been controlling you with this
(He advances the staff) : What
Jafar
You, you traitor
(The trio advances on
) :  Your majesty, all of this can be explained
: Guards
Guards
:       Well, that's it--we're dead, forget about it
Just dig a grave for both of us
We're dead
(But  sees the lamp in 's pocket
He makes a move, but is grabbed by guards
) : Arrest Jafar at once
:  This is not done yet, boy
( pulls a vial from his pocket
sees this and rushes him, but  throws the vial to the floor
large red cloud appears
When it is gone, so is
) : Find him, search everywhere
:    Jasmine, are you all right
:    Yes
(They lean in to kiss, but the  barges between them
) : Jafar, my most trusted counselor, plotting against me all this time
Just horrible
How will  ever- (He stops in mid sentence and looks at the pair
) Can it be true
My daughter has finally chosen a suitor
(She nods) Ha ha
Praise Allah
You brilliant boy,  could kiss you
won't--'ll leave that to my--
You two will be wed at once
Yes, yes
And you'll be happy and prosperous, and then my boy, you will be sultan
:    Sultan
: Yes, a fine upstanding youth like yourself, a person of your unimpeachable moral character is exactly what this kingdom needs
( looks concerned at this
) (Cut to int
of 's chambers
and  enter
) :       We gotta get outta here
We gotta get--   gotta start packing, your highness
Only essentials
( starts throwing things out of his cage
smiles broadly
)  Travel light
Bring the guns, the weapons, the knives (Stops and takes out a picture of himself    and ) and how about this picture
don't know-- think 'm making a weird face in it
( starts to laugh wildly
) Oh, boy--he's gone nuts
He's cracked
( flies down to him and knocks on his head
)  Jafar
Jafar
Get a grip, Jafar
( grabs him around the neck) Good grip
:  Prince Ali is nothing more than that ragged urchin Aladdin
He has the lamp, Iago
:       Why that miserable-- :  But you are going to relieve him of it
:       Me
(Cut to ext
of palace
is looking at the gardens
) :    Sultan
They want me to be sultan
( comes out of lamp) :  Huzzah
Hail the conquering hero
(Turns into a one-man band
He sees  walk away with his head hung
He stops, scratches his head, comes up with an idea, then zooms over to
He holds up his hands like a director scoping a picture and we look through them
)  Aladdin, you've just won the heart of the princess
What are you gonna do next
( looks at him, then walks away in sadness to the bed, where he falls on it and sighs
again is confused, then goes to him and pulls out a script labeled "Aladdin
" Whispering: ) Psst, your line is "'m going to free the genie
" Anytime
:    Genie
can't
:  Sure you can
You just go "Genie,  wish you free
"  (He grabs 's head and uses him as a mock ventriloquist's dummy
pulls away
) :    'm serious
Look, 'm sorry-- really am
But they want to make me sultan--no
, They want to make Prince Ali sultan
Without you, 'm just Aladdin
:  Al, you won
:    Because of you
The only reason anyone thinks 'm anything is because of you
What if they find out 'm not really a prince
(Quietly)  What if Jasmine finds out
'll lose her
Genie,  can't keep this up on my own
can't wish you free
:  (Sarcastically) Hey,  understand
After all, you've lied to everyone else
Hey,  was beginning to feel left out
Now, if you'll excuse me, master
(He says the last word in disgust, then poofs back into the lamp
) ( and  are watching from the window
) :        Ohhh
:    Genie, 'm really sorry
( tongue comes out of the spout and raspberries him
)   Well, fine
(He slams a pillow on top of the
)  Then just stay in there
(He looks at  and
)  What are you guys looking at
(They both leave
) Look, --'m sorry
Wait, Abu-- wait--'m sorry,  didn't-- wait, c'mon
(He sighs
)  What am  doing
Genie's right-- gotta tell Jasmine the truth
:    (From a distance)  Ali, oh Ali--will you come here
:    (Putting on his turban) Well, here goes
(He walks into the garden
)  Jasmine
Where are you
(We see  wearing a beak and standing on stilts next to a in the pond
He is imitating 's voice
) :       Ahem--In the menagerie, hurry
:    'm coming
(We see  hurry past, not noticing the birds
laughs, then turns back and looks into the face of a , who is panting
) :   'uh
:       Ya got a problem, pinky
(He sweeps the bird's feet out from under it
runs into the palace and finds the lamp under the pillow
)  Boy, Jafar's gonna be happy to see you
(Stretches his face like 's and imitates it
)  Good work, Iago
(Normal) Ah, go on
() No, really--on a scale of one to ten, you are an eleven
(Normal) Ah, Jafar--you're too kind
'm embarrassed, 'm blushing
(He flies away with the lamp
) (Cut to the palace entrance
The  is standing on top, making an announcement to the people
) : People of Agrabah, My daughter has finally chosen a suitor
(Cut to behind the curtain, where  is peeking appears at the bottom of the stairs
) :    Jasmine
:    Ali, where have you been
:    There's something 've got to tell you
:    The whole kingdom has turned out for father's announcement
:    No
But Jasmine, listen to me, please
:    Good luck
(She pushes him out onto the platform with the , where he overlooks the entire crowd
) :
Ali Ababwa
:    Oh, boy
(Far above,  and  watch through a window
) :   Look at them, cheering that little pipsqueak
:  Let them cheer
(He lifts the lamp and rubs it
comes out
) :  You know Al, 'm getting (turns and sees ) reallyyyyyy-- don't think you're him
(He descends and consults a playbill
)  Tonight, the role of Al will be played by a tall, dark and sinister ugly man
:   am your master now
(He throws  to the ground and puts his foot on 's face
) :   was afraid of that
:  Genie, grant me my first wish
wish to rule on high, as sultan
(Cut to ext where dark clouds circle the castle
The castle shakes
The roof rips off and the  and  duck
) :    Whoa
: Bless my soul
What is this
What is going on
(His turban lifts off his head
When he grabs it, his whole body flies up, then is stripped of all his clothing except his boxer shorts
The clothing reappears on
) :  Heh heh heh
: Jafar, you vile betrayer
:       That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you
:    Oh, yeah
Well, we'll just see about that
(Pulls off his own turban, but finds it empty)  The lamp
:  Finders-keepers, Abooboo
(They both look up and see a gigantic  lift the palace into the clouds
whistles and  flies up to greet him
They fly up near the 's head
) :    Genie
No
:  Sorry, kid-- got a new master now
(He places the palace on top of a mountain
) : Jafar,  order you to stop
:  There's a new order now--my order
Finally, you will bow to me
(The  bows, but  does not
) :  We'll never bow to you
:       Why am  not surprised
:  If you will not bow before a sultan, then you will cower before a sorcerer
(To )  Genie, my second wish-- wish to be the most powerful sorcerer in the world
( extends his finger
tries to stop him, but he cannot, and another  (tm) brand lightning bolt  strikes , returning him to his normal look
) :       Ladies and gentlemen, a warm Agrabah welcome for Sorcerer Jafar
:  Now where were we
Ah, yes--abject humiliation
(He zaps  and the  with his staff, and they both bow to him
comes running at him
He zaps , and the tiger turns into a kitty- cat
)  Down, boy
Oh, princess--(lifts her chin with his staff)--there's someone 'm dying to introduce you to
:    (off-camera) Jafar
Get your hands off her
( zaps
flies away
) :  Prince Ali Yes, it is he, But not as you know him
Read my lips and come to grips With reality ( brings the two of them closer in the air
) Yes, meet a blast from your past Whose lies were too good to last Say hello to your precious Prince Ali
( zaps  back to
) :       Or should we say Aladdin
:    Jasmine,  tried to tell you
:  So Ali turns out to be merely Aladdin Just a con, need  go on
Take it from me His personality flaws Give me adequate cause To send him packing on a one-way trip So his prospects take a terminal dip His assets frozen, the venue chosen Is the ends of the earth, whoopee
So long, :       Good bye, see ya
:  Ex-Prince Ali
( has zapped  back to normal
He sends the two of them into a tall pillar, then launches it like a rocket, but not before can get in
F2B, then we see a snowy wasteland, where the pillar crashes and rolls
It finally comes to a stop
emerges, obviously very cold
) :    Abu
Abu
(He looks back at a shivering pile of snow
)  Oh, this is all my fault-- should have freed the genie when  had the chance
(He digs out  and cradles him inside his vest
)  Abu
Are you okay
'm sorry, Abu-- made a mess of everything, somehow
gotta go back and set things right
(He starts to walk through the snow, and he eventuallysteps on a frozen
) Carpet
(He looks up and sees  is pinned by the pillar
He tugs to try and free
He can't do it, so he begins to remove snow from the base of the pillar
)   Abu, start digging
That's it
(Finally, enough snow has been removed, and the pillar begins to roll
runs away, looks back, then slides into place
The pillar rolls over him, and when it is gone,  and are left sitting in the patch of snow made by the window of the pillar
)  Yeah
All right
(He looks up at his turban, made out of scared
shakes off the snow and rushes over to pick them up
)  Now, back to Agrabah
Let's go
(We cut back to ext
long shot of Agrabah, shrouded in red clouds
Cut to int
and slow zoom of throne room
has the tied up like a marionette, and  is chained next to the throne
) :       Puppet ruler want a cracker
Here's your cracker
Shove 'em all right down your throat
Here, have lots
( pulls the chain, and  walks up to him holding an apple
) :  Leave him alone
( stops for a second, then continues
) :  It pains me to see you reduced to this, Jasmine
(He takes a bite out of the apple she is holding
) beautiful desert bloom such as yourself should be on the arm of the most powerful man in the world
(He waves his finger and a crown appears
) What do you say, my dear
Why,  with you as my queen
(She picks up a glass of wine and throws it in his face
) :    Never
:  'll teach you some respect
(She falls back as he raises his hand to slap her
Then he stops
)  No
Genie,  have decided to make my final wish wish for Princess Jasmine to fall desperately in love with me
(We see  race back into town
) :  (Again as Buckley) Ah, master-- there are a few addendas, some quid pro quo- :  Don't talk back to me, you stupid blue lout
You will do what  order you to do, slave
( looks up and sees  in the window, motioning her to play along
) :    (She stands and puts the crown on her head
) Jafar
never realized how incredibly handsome you are
(The 's jaw drops
) :  That's better
(He pulls the 's jaw up like a shade
)  Now, pussycat, tell me more about
myself
:    You're tall, well dressed
( walks over to her
jumps down with  and sees them
) :  Al
Al, little buddy
:    Shh
:  (Literally zips his mouth shut, then unzips it
) Al,  can't help you-- work for senor psychopath, now
(His head turns into 's, then back
) :    Hey--'m a street rat, remember
(He rezips 's mouth
)  'll improvise
(He slides down a pile of coins and hides close to  and
's back is to
) :  Go on
:    And your beard
is so
twisted
(She has her arms around him
She pretends to twist with her finger, but she is actually motioning for to come over
He makes his move
sees him
) :       Jaf--mmmmmm
( grabs him and covers his mouth
) :  And the street rat
:    What street rat
(They are about to kiss when  manages to knock over a bowl turns to look, but  grabs him back and kisses him looks disgusted
and  both look disgusted
) :        Yuck
:  That was--(he sees 's reflection in her crown
) You
How many times do  have to kill you, boy
(He zaps
rushes him, and he throws her to the ground
rushes and grabs the staff
) :    Get the lamp
( runs to it
, however, shakes off , then zaps her into an hourglass
) :  Ah, ah, ah, princess--Your time is up
(Sand begins to fall from the top onto her
) :    Jasmine
:       Oh, nice shot, Jaf-- (he is knocked out by
) ( rushes for the lamp
) :  Don't toy with me
(He's zapped into a toy monkey
:    Abu
( rushes in
) :  Things are unraveling fast, now boy
( is zapped and unravels
again rushes for the lamp
)  Get the point
(His path is blocked by large swords sticking in the floor
grabs the lamp and laughs hideously
pulls a sword out of the floor
) 'm just getting warmed up
(He breathes a ring of fire around
) :    Are you afraid to fight me yourself, you cowardly snake
:   snake, am
Perhaps you'd like to see how snake-like  can be
(He smiles broadly, and we see a snake's tongue come out from behind his teeth
He then turns into a giant cobra, and the ring of fire around  becomes part of the snake encircling
The snake  makes moves on , and on the third try, swings the sword and hits
Cut to cheerleaders wearing '' sweaters
) :  Rickem, rockem, rackem, rake--stick that sword into that snake
:  You stay out of thissss
( waving a tiny pennant with a '' on it
) :  (Weakly) Jafar, Jafar, he's our man--if he can't do it, ( uses the distraction to make a break for the hourglass where is trapped
However,  sees this and blocks the path
is thrown away, and he loses his sword
) :    Aladdin
( jumps on a large gem and slides across the floor, grabbing the sword on his way
He turns a corner, but the pursuing snake cannot, and the front half of  crashes through a wall and hangs outside the palace
jumps up on the snake's back and stabs it
screams in agony
again tries to free the princess
) :    Hang on, Jasmine
(He is about to hit the glass with his sword when  grabs him
) :  (laughs hideously)  You little fool
You thought you could defeat the most powerful being on earth
:       (with  coming up behind him) Squeeze him, Jafar--Squeeze him like a--awk
( elbows him out of the way) :  Without the genie, boy, you're nothing
:    (Has an idea)  The genie
The genie
The genie has more power than you'll ever have
:  What
:    He gave you your power, he can take it away
:  Al, what are you doing
Why are you bringing me into this
:    Face it, Jafar--you're still just second best
:  You're right
His power does exceed my own
But not for long
( circles around the
) :  The boy is crazy
He's a little punch drunk
One too many hits with the snake  (His hand turns into a snake and he hits his head with it
) :  Slave,  make my third wish
wish to be an all powerful genie
:  (Reluctantly) All right, your wish is my command
Way to go, Al
( zaps  with the last  (tm) brand lightning bolt
's snake form dissipates and he turns into a genie
We see 's raised hand disappear under the sand runs over and finally smashes the glass
Sand and princess pour out
) :  Yes
Yes
The power
The absolute power
:    (to ) What have you done
:    Trust me
( black lamp appears at 's base
is busy conjuring
) :  The universe is mine to command, to control
:    Not so fast, Jafar
Aren't you forgetting something
( looks down questioningly) You wanted to be a genie, you got it
And everything that goes with it
(Shackles appear on 's wrists
) :  No
No
:       'm gettin' out of here
Come on, you're the genie,  don't want-- ( tries to fly away, but is sucked in with
) :    Phenomenal cosmic powers
Itty bitty living space
:  Al, you little genius, you
( turns back to normal, the  re-ravels, , the and  are standing together
jumps up into the arms of the , then they are all transformed
The  is crushed because of the weight of the new
The palace reappears where it used to be in the city
is left holding the new lamp
) :  (Both from inside the lamp
)  Get your blasted beak out of my face
:       Oh, shut up, you moron
:  Don't tell me to shut up
:  Allow me
(He takes the lamp and goes to the balcony
He is now wearing a baseball cap
He winds up as if to throw the lamp, but opens his palm flat and flicks it out into the desert with his finger
) Ten- thousand years in a cave of wonders ought to chill him out
( and  continue to argue as they fade out
walks over to
They hold hands, but both look sad
) :    Jasmine, 'm sorry  lied to you about being a prince
:     know why you did
:    Well,  guess
this
is goodbye
( pokes his head around the corner shocked at what he is hearing
) :    Oh, that stupid law
This isn't fair-- love you
:  (Wipes away a tear)  Al, no problem
You've still got one wish left
Just say the word and you're a prince again
:    But Genie, what about your freedom
:  Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude
This is love
(He leans down next to her
)  Al, you're not gonna find another girl like her in a million years
Believe me,  know
've looked
:    Jasmine,  do love you, but 've got to stop pretending to be something 'm not
:     understand
(They take one final look into each other's eyes, then  turns to the
) :    Genie,  wish for your freedom
:  One bona fide prince pedigree coming up
--what
:    (He holds the lamp up to
)  Genie, you're free
( transformation scene ensues, in which the shackles fall off 's wrist and the lamp falls uselessly to the ground
picks it up and looks at it
) :  (He can't believe it
)  Heh, heh
'm free
'm free
(He hands the lamp to
)  Quick, quick, wish for something outrageous
Say  " want the Nile
"   Wish for the Nile
Try that
:     wish for the Nile
:  No way
(Laughs hysterically
He bounces around the balcony like a pinball
)  Oh does that feel good
'm free
'm free at last
'm hittin' the road
'm off to see the world
-- (He is packing a suitcase, but looks down and sees  looking very sad
) :    Genie, 'm--'m gonna miss you
:  Me too, Al
No matter what anybody says, you'll always be a prince to me
(They hug
The  steps forward
) : That's right
You've certainly proven your worth as far as 'm concerned
It's that law that's the problem
:    Father
: Well, am  sultan or am  sultan
From this day forth, the princess shall marry whomever she deems worthy
:    (She smiles widely and runs into 's arms
) Him

choose you, Aladdin
:    Ha, ha

(They are about to kiss when giant blue hands pull everybody together
is decked out in a Hawaiian shirt with golf clubs and a Goofy hat
) :  Oh, all of ya

Big group hug
Mind if  kiss the monkey
(He kisses
)  Ooh, hairball
Well,  can't do any more damage around this popsicle stand
'm outta here
Bye, bye, you two crazy lovebirds
Hey, Rugman: ciao
'm history
No, 'm mythology
No,  don't care what  am--'m free
(The  flies up into the blue sky leaving a trail of sparkles behind him
They cut (a jump cut to make matters worse) to fireworks exploding over a nightscape
We tilt down and see and  flying on
) :     whole new world :         whole new life :   (with off-camera chorus)    For you and me
' :    whole new world
(They fly off into the moonlight, and after they have disappeared, the moon turns and reveals the 's laughing face
Suddenly the film is grabbed "off the projector", the  lifts it up and looks at the audience
) :  Made ya look
(Drops the film back to normal, with the normal moon
Fade to black
The end
