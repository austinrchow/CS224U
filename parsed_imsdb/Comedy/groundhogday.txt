Written by Danny Rubin Second Revision by Harold Ramis January 7, 1992 family of groundhogs is nestled together in their burrow sleeping off the end of a long winter
: - The crust of an old snowfall still covers the frozen ground, and the bare, icy branches of the trees glisten dully in the early morning light
: - is standing in front of a blank green wall gesticulating animatedly at some invisible images on the wall, talking a mile a minute ()
He looks completely crazy as he points at nothing and winks to an unseen audience
: - as we streak across the winter landscape, flying over fields and farms, small towns and hamlets, railroad lines and interstates, coalyards and factories, until we cross the Allegheny River and follow it to the southwest
: - Phil continues pointing out features on the blank wall , but from a new angle we can see that he ' s looking at a monitor out of the corner of his eye which shows the chromakey insert he's pointing to -- a national weather map
: - The country towns turn to suburbs, traffic on the roads gets heavier and finally we see the skyline of Pittsburgh and the confluence of the Allegheny with the Monongahela and the Ohio
-2- We zoom into a tall building in the downtown area and : '  - We don't see anyone at first but the office itself speaks volumes about it's inhabitant-- team pictures of the Steelers from the Franco Harris-Terry Bradshaw glory years, a framed memorial portrait of Roberto Clemente, a local Emmy award statue, an erasable weather map and mountains of personal junk on the desk, ^windowsill, and every other available surface
As the  , we notice a sleeping figure on the small sofa, buried deep under a pile of coats and a stolen airline blanket
, Executive Producer of the Action News, sticks his head in the door
Christ, what a pit
Phil" The sleeping figure rouses himself and looks out at Hawley
It's Phil, the
Channel 9 Action News weatherman
() What
It's February first, Phil
You know what tomorrow is
Phil sits up and
thinks hard
He's in his mid-thirties, smart, rugged-looking, perhaps a little too full of himself, but clearly a guy with a lot of personality
(catching on) Oh, no
Not again
He jumps up and exits the office with Hawley right behind him
Forget it
'm not going
- Hawley pursues Phil through the office suite of the Channel 9 Action News, from the look of it a typical, big city, local news operation
logo on the wall identifies the station as - Pittsburgh
Phil ducks into the studio
-3- - Hawley follows him in and catches up with him at the weather corner of the Action News set
Phil starts putting weather stats up on a chart
Get away from me
'm working
So what's the outlook
We gonna get that blizzard
Phil shakes his head and points to the chart which is headed "Phil's Phorecast" with a cute caricature of himself drawn next to the title
No way
All that moisture coming up from the Gulf is going to miss us completely and take a dump on Harrisburg
(with authority) Good, 'cause you're going up to Punxsutawney to cover the groundhog story tomorrow morning and  want you back here in time to do the five
Jesus, Gil, give me a break, will you
covered the goddamn groundhog last year and the year before that
And you'll do it :next year and the year after, too
When worked in San Diego,  covered the swallows coming back to Capistrano for ten years in a row
You should've killed the guy who made you do that
wanted to do it
Then you should've killed yourself
don't want to get stuck with the groundhog for the rest of my life
-4- It's a cute story
He comes out, he looks around, he wrinkles up his little nose, he sniffs around a little, he sees his shadow, he d oesn't see his shadow-- it's nice
People like it
Many people are morons
Just do it
What'11 you give me
Hawley looks across the studio and sees   enter, a very attractive segment producer in her late twenties
(to Phil) 'll give you Rita
(calls her over) Rita, could you come here for a second
got a little job for you
Rita is relatively new to the station, but very competent, personable, humorous, self-assured and very pretty-- in short, a genuine princess, though Phil is too self-absorbed at this point to realize it
() You can't send Rita out on a story like this
She's just a cub, a pup, still wet behind the ears
Look at her
Her ears are sopping wet
This needs a Woodward or a Bernstein
It's a big story
People need to know
() What's the story
The Punxsutawney Groundhog Festival
Gil, if it's all right with you ' d rather follow-up on the nurses' strike
-5- You can do the nurses when you get back
Just take the squeaky wheel here up to Punxsutawney and get him back in one piece
Okay
Yeah, okay
Hawley exits leaving Phil and Rita alone in the studio
She knows Phil mainly by his reputation and it isn't good
Still, she finds him appealing in an odd way
() You know, this could be extremely interesting
've never done a weather story before
What's Punxsutawney like
Oh, it's an enchanted place magical world
It's the Constantinople of the whole Western Appalachian-Susquehanna Drainage system
Do you always joke
About 70 to 80% of the time
Inside 'm actually a very shy and sensitive person
lot of people around here think you're not very sincere
Tell me the names of these people
'll line up a crew and transportation
If you don't feel like driving, we can all go up in the van together
think 'll take my own car
' m not that fond of my fellow man
-6- () Nice attitude
Nice face
(calls after her) Why don't you ride up with me
No, thanks
, an attractive, dark-eyed, dark-haired correspondent, glares at Phil from across the studio
'  - Phil is in his cluttered cubicle talking on a headset phone while he reviews cassettes of his groundhog spots from the past two years on a small monitor
As he talks, he stuffs a number of personal items in an overnight bag, all the time watching himself on the  monitor
(on the phone) They don't really think of me as a weatherman around here
More of a "personality," but with the credibility of a first-class broadcast journalist
Once you look at my tape  think you'll see what they mean
Stephanie enters and stands in the doorway looking at Phil for a long moment
There is something vaguely off-center about this woman, not quite   but still a little scary
() just want to know one thing: did  do something wrong or are you just tired of me or what have to know
Phil sighs
(on the phone) Dan, can  call you back
've just been handed something and better get on it
(he picks up some papers and rustles them for effect) Okay, thanks
-7- He takes off the headset, gets up and closes the door for privacy
() You didn't do anything wrong, Stephanie, and  ' m not tired of you
It's just that  don't have time for a real relationship right now
told you that the first time we went out
(getting close) Everybody says that at the beginning of a relationship
(gently pushing her ) 'm different
really meant it
Things are really starting to move for me now
' m not going to be doing the weather for the rest of my life
was just talking to the  guy about a network job
want that
This is just the beginning for me can't waste any more time
Are you saying our relationship was a waste of time
Our relationship
We went out a total of four times
And only twice did anything happen
It was fun but  don't see that as a big commitment
(closing in again) had our charts done
My astrologer says we're extremely compatible
There may even be some past lives involvement here
See
So we've already done this
Let's move on
Next case
You know what's wrong with you, Phil
You're selfish
You don't have time for anyone but yourself
-8- That's what  ' m trying to tell you
You don't want to be with me
You can do better
Look, Stephanie, if  ever said or did anything to mislead you 'm sorry for that, but right now  have to do this groundhog thing and don't have a handle on it yet
He throws some papers and his datebook into a briefcase and puts on his jacket
(
) 'll tell you what
' m going to do some serious thinking while ' m in Punxsutawney, okay
He pats her on the shoulder and brushes past her, leaving her standing there with a malevolent look on her face
: - marked "
Channel 9 Action News" speeds along a two-lane highway through the winter landscape of West Central Pennsylvania
Mounted atop the van is a microwave transmitter
Rita is riding up front with , the union cameraman and techie
Phil is following close behind the van in a new Lexus coupe
His car has a bumper-sticker that reads "Weathermen Like it Wet
" (
) (on his earphone) 'm on my way to Punxsutawney
(forced to repeat it, a little embarrassed) Punx^su-taw-ney
Work or fun
think that all depends on you
- Phil is talking to one of his girlfriends, sorting through a stack of 's, as usual, grabbing at the good life with both hands
thought maybe you could meet me up there tonight and let me vulgarize you for about seven hours
So  ' m supposed to spend the night in Punxsutawney all alo ne
Thanks
Phil loads a  and a great, driving song kicks in
: "Welcome to Punxsutawney - The Original Weather Capitol of the World Since 1887
" Depicted on the sign is a large cartoon wearing a top hat and clutching an umbrella under his arm
The mini-convoy passes some fast food places on the outskirts of town
-  - The van drives along , the small-town main drag
There are cartoon groundhogs everywhere you look and the whole town has been gaily festooned with banners and bunting
- The van pulls into the parking lot at a Quality Inn
The announcement billboard in ;front of the motel reads: "Groundhog Day Breakfast Special - Feb
2 - All You Can Eat - $5
99
" The parking area is already crowded with cars including a number of other news vans
The Lexus pulls in behind the van and everybody gets out
Phil takes one look at the motel and shakes his head
(calls out) Rita
can't stay here
Rita is already helping Larry unload equipment from the van
() Prima donnas
It's okay
'll handle it
She crosses to the Lexus where Phil is trying to make another call on his earphone
What's the problem, Phil
hate this place
stayed here two years ago and  was miserable
It's like a minimum security prison
'm not staying here
-10- You're not staying here
() ' m not
No, Larry and  don't care but thought you might, so  booked you at a very nice bed and breakfast on Cherry Street
Here's the address
She hands him a card
() Great
That's great
That's the mark of a really good producer
Making the talent happy
Whatever  can do
Really
Will you be my love slave
Whatever  can do within reason
Would you like to have dinner with Larry and me
No thanks, 've seen Larry eat
Why don't you ditch Larry and let me take you someplace nice
You mean like a date
Yeah
Oh, no
Okay
get it
You're a little intimidated by me, you're all excited about the shoot tomorrow, you want everything to go just perfect
understand
You just get some sleep
Tomorrow will be great
-11- Well, that's something to look forward to
'll see you in the morning
He drives off, leaving her standing there shaking her head
Did he actually call himself "the talent
" Larry snorts and continues unloading their gear
: - The first light of morning colors the sky behind the Cherry Street Inn, a rambling, white Victorian bed and breakfast
- digital clock-radio changes from 5:59 to 6:00
The radio comes on, playing the end of the Sonny and Cher hit, " Got You, Babe
" :  2 '  - Phil sits up in bed and looks around the room
The decor is typical bed and breakfast, flocked wallpaper, framed prints, and an odd assortment of mismatched furniture
His suit is hanging neatly on the back of the closet door and his suitcase is open on a stand at the foot of the bed, still neatly packed
iradio,  and his  come on with hyped-up, drivetime Chappy talk
" Phil stares at the radio and listens to them
Okay, campers, rise and shine, and don't forget your booties because it's  out there TODAY1 Phil grimaces and swings out of bed
It's cold out there everyday
hat is this-- Miami Beach
The deejay laughs
Phil shakes his head at the cheesy repartee as he crosses to the sink and starts brushing his teeth
-12- Not hardly
And you can expect hazardous travel later today with that, you know, blizzard thing-- That "blizzard thing
" Phil splashes some water on his face and prepares to shave
(
) Oh, here's the report: the National Weather Service is calling for a big blizzard thing
Yes they are, but there's another reason today is very special-- Es pec ia lly cold-- Especially cold, okay, but the big question on everybody's lips-- Ch ap pe d lips-- :--on their chapped lips, right-- Do you think Phil's going to come out and see his shadow
Punxsutawney Phil
Phil looks up at himself in the mirror, admiring his own face
That's right, rodent lovers
'-- Groundhog Day1 of
Phil grunts at his reflection in the mirror
(to himself) Never again
: -13- - Phil heads for the breakfast room of the inn, now well-dressed in a suit and tie, a nice overcoat slung over his arm passes
Morning
Morning
Think it'll be an early Spring
' m predicting March 21st
: - Phil enters the old library of the house now set up with a breakfast buffet
An old spinet piano stands in the corner
One wall is lined with
bookcases filled with books
handful of guests are seated around the room, eating
The matron of the house,
, spots Phil as she comes out of the kitchen with a fresh pot of coffee
Did you sleep well, Mr
Connors
(with mock civility) Like a Roumanian orphan, Mrs
Lancaster
Would you like some coffee
don't suppose it1 d be possible to get an espresso or a capuccino around here
() don't really know -- Forget it
This '11 be fine
-14- ( as she pours) wonder what the weather's going to be like for all the festivities
My guess is it'11 be cold and overcast, high today in the low 30's, dropping to the low 20's tonight, but 'm predicting that all that moisture coming up from the Gulf is going to miss us and dump some locally heavy snow, possibly blizzard conditions with travel advisories in the Harrisburg area and maybe as far east as
Philadelphia
(off her surprised ) You want to talk weather, you asked the right guy
He heads for the door
; Oh, will you be checking out today, Mr
Connors
Unfortunately yes
Phil exits
: - Sipping at the steaming coffee, Phil manages to put on his coat and gloves as he descends the front steps of the house and joins the flow of pedestrian traffic on the street
- - There are a lot of people on the street for this hour
Traffic is so heavy in fact, the pedestrians are moving faster than the cars
Everyone seems to be going in the same direction, making the annual trek to see the groundhog
An   is sitting on the sidewalk leaning against a storefront
Someone throws him a coin
Phil walks by without taking any notice
(
) Hey, Phil
-15- big pie-faced man,  , comes huffing and puffing right up to him
There is something about this guy that makes us dislike him on sight
Phil
Phil Connors
thought that was you
Phil looks at him vaguely
(at a loss) 'm sorry
Have we-- uh-- My oh my
Phil Connors
Don't say you don't remember me, 'cause sure as heckrfire remember you
Well
Phil stares, trying to remember
Ned Ryerson
Needlenose Ned
Ned the Head
Come on, buddy
Case Western High
Ned
see you clicking through that brain of yours
Click-click, c li ck- cli ck, click-click--Bing
Ned Ryerson, did the whistling trick with my belly button in the talent show
Bing
Ned Ryerson, got the shingles real bad senior ^year^ almost didn't graduate
Bing again
Ned Ryerson, went out with your sister Mary Pat a couple of times-- 'til you told me not to anymore
Well
() Ned Ryerson
Bing
So what're you doing with yourself, Ned
Phil,  sell insurance
-16- (sorry he asked) No kidding
Do you have life insurance, Phil
'Cause if you do,  bet you could u s e more-- who couldn't
--but got a feeling you don't have any
Am  right
You know, Ned,  ' d love to talk to you but  really have to-- Phil starts to walk away,,but Ned won't take the hint
That's okay
'll walk with you
When  see an opportunity, charge it, like a bull
Ned the Bull, that's me now
Some of my friends live and die by actuarial tables, but  think it's all just a crap shoot anyhoo
Ever heard of single
premium life
That could be the ticket for you, buddy
God, it's good to see you
Hey, what're you doing for dinner
Dinner
Umm,  don't think that's going to work for me
As they continue walking, Phil steps into what looks like a shallow puddle and ends up ankle deep in wet slush
Ned laughs like a donkey
Hey, look out for that first step
It's a doozy
Phil looks at him with murderous contempt
: '  - big crowd is standing in a park-like clearing off a residential street
They are gathered around a large mound of dirt enclosed by a rail fence, waiting for the big moment
For a cold gray dawn, there is the atmosphere of a festival here
An area close to the mound is roped off for news reporters and cameras
Rita stands there, a pocket of genuine beauty in this sea of potbellied old union guys and blow-dried reporters
-17- Stomping her feet against the cold, Rita looks at her watch and glances around
Larry, the cameraman, just looks bored
How could he be late
Prima donnas
It's just so-- inconsiderate
What happens to some people
They're born nice
They grow up nice
You put 'em on  and - bam
Prima donnas
Rita spots Phil heading into the crowd
Here he comes
Phil
Hey, Phil
Over here
Phil joins them in the press area
Rita pulls him to his mark near the rail fence
Where've you been
got hung up with some jerk went to high school with
So, did you sleep okay without me
You tossed and turned, didn't you
Rita holds up a slate for Larry to  the tape
You're incredible
Who told you
Ready when you are
Phil takes the microphone from Rita and positions himself against the fence
The Groundhog Club Officials in top hats, striped trousers and cutaway coats parade out to the burrow that houses Punxsutawney Phil
Looks like they're starting
Roll tape
-18- Rolling
Rita silently counts down from five and cues Phil who instantly snaps into announce mode
(to camera) Once a year, the eyes of the nation turn here, to this tiny hamlet in Pennsylvania, to watch a master at work
The master
Punxsutawney Phil, the world's most famous weatherman, the groundhog, who, as legend has it, can predict the coming of an early spring
Rita turns to Larry
This is impressive-- so far, so good
Groundhog Club Official kneels at the burrow and ceremoniously knocks on the small wooden door, then opens it and retreats
And here's the big moment we've all been waiting for
Let's just see what Mr
Groundhog has to say
The groundhog sticks his head out, looks around, steps out of the hole, and runs over to the other side of the mound, about as far away from the cameras as he can get
Hey
Over here, you little weasel
Larry zooms in as far as he can but the best he can manage is a close-up of the groundhog's back
The groundhog stands there a moment, his body casting a long shadow, then he lets out a squeak and runs back into the hole
Great shot, huh, folks
Well, that was certainly worth the trip
Now we'll be hearing from Mr
Buster Greene, President of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, the so-called Seer of Seers who will interpret for us
, dressed up in his top hat and cutaway coat, walks onto the mound and hushes the crowd
-19- He came out, and he saw his shadow
Sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but it looks like it's going to be a long winter
The crowd lets out a good-natured "Awwwwww" in disappointment
(sarcastic, to camera) Well, that's it
Sorry you couldn't be here in person to share the electric moment
This is one event where televison really fails to capture the excitement of thousands of people gathered to watch a large squirrel predict the weather, and for one am deeply grateful to have been a part of it
Reporting for Channel 9, this is Phil Connors
Larry cuts the camera
(to Phil) You want to try one that's a little sweeter
(to Rita) That's as sweet as  get
'm outa here
As he exits, Phil tosses the mike to Larry, who isn't expecting the throw and bobbles it, dropping the mike on the ground
() Prima donnas
: - Phil is sitting alone having a cup of coffee in a busy, loud and lively cafe
Rita enters, sees him sitting there, crosses to his table and sits down across from him
That was really lousy
Is it my fault the little rat went south on us
-20- real professional would have handled it
You acted like it was a personal insult
Who do you think you are -- Wolf Blitzer
God, you really take this stuff seriously, don't you
Yes,  do
As far as  ' m concerned there are no little stories, Phil
Only little reporters with big egos who think they're too good for the job they have to do
(trying to look hurt) You really don't know me very well, do you
'Cause if you did you could never say something like that about me
care
Call me a cockeyed optimist but happen to think there's more to this job than just getting my ugly mug on the boob tube every night
Is that so
Yes, that is so
Rita is so irritated by him she can't even respond
Phil looks at her evenly for a long moment
So as far as us getting together, would you say the glass is half empty or half full
Larry pokes his head in the doorway, looks around, spots Rita and makes his way over to their table
(to Rita) You ready
We better get going if we ' re going to stay ahead of the weather
You don't have to rush off, you know
That storm is 'going to miss us completely
-21- Nice working with you, Phil
See you around
Rita walks away, leaving him sitting alone
: - Phil's Lexus is driving down the highway
Light snow is just starting to fall
(
) (on the earphone) 'll call you after  see the network guy
should be back there in a couple of hours
What
1 can't hear you-- you're breaking up
Hello
Sabrina
- Phil is getting annoyed as the phone connection deteriorates
The snow is getting heavier
Phil switches on the windshield wipers
Sabrina
Can you hear me
Shit
He slams the phone back into it's cradle, then looks up and notices slow traffic up ahead
He honks his horn as the traffic comes to a complete stop
He keeps honking but nothing moves
He rolls down the window and looks up ahead
The highway is a parking lot
No
No
- Phil jumps out and begins to walk down the highway, past the parked cars, shivering in his light sweater and silk sport shirt
The snowfall is getting heavier and the wind is pickin up
The snow comes down unnaturally hard and fast
He walks on, slipping and sliding in his expensive loafers until he j comes to a police roadblock up ahead, manned by "
What's going on, Officer
-22- Nothin's goin1 on
We're closin1 the road
Big accident up ahead
Blizzard movin1 in
What blizzard
couple of flakes
An isolated phenomenon of nature
Are you nuts
We got a major storm movin' in
No, no
All that moisture is going to miss us and hit Harrisburg
Pal, you got that moisture on your head
But  have to get to Pittsburgh today
Mister, the only place anybody's goin' on this road is back to Punxsutawney
Phil glowers at him and shivers
: - Phil is on a pay phone
Snow is falling heavily outside
is shovelling around the pumps
So all the long distance lines a re down
What about the sa tellite
Is it snowing in space
But  have to call Pittsburgh
Isn't there some special line you keep open for emergencies or for celebrities
Well, 'm both really
'm a celebrity in an emergency
Can you patch me through on that line
-23- The door opens and Phil is blasted with frigid Arctic wind and blowing snow
The    enters the tiny office and in trying to squeeze past Phil accidentally bangs him on the head with his snow shovel
: - Phil is at the bar in Punxsutawney ' s oldest and best hotel , the Pennsylvanian
He looks very bored, drinking a beer, unsuccessfully hustling an attractive local girl named
You never saw me on -- on the news
don't think so
What part of the news do you do
' m the White House correspondent for  news
Oh ,  ' m so sure
Ask me anything
Okay, how big is the White House
Three bedrooms, two and a half baths
Looks much bigger than it , is
Nancy just stares at him, clearly not into his sense of humor
Suddenly, a  in full white wedding gown and veil rushes into the bar, crying and shouting
gaggle of flutters around her trying to coax her back to her own wedding but she won't budge
Then the , wearing a bad rented tux, comes storming in and tries to drag her back, until the restrains him and the bridesmaids hustle the bride away
Phil watches the whole drama play out, then turns back to Nancy
Good start
' m sure they'll be very happy
So what do you say
You want to play doggie obedience school with me
-24- Thanks
'll pass
She gets up to leave
Sit
Stay
He watches her go, then tosses a tip on the bar and exits somewhat unsteadily
: - The cover reads "101 Curses, Spells and Enchantments You Can Do at Home
"  well-manicured feminine hand opens the book to a marked page
-  - Phil enters his room and drunkenly tosses his overcoat, scarf and gloves on the floor in a heap
'  - Stephanie Decastro, Phil ' s disaffected ex-lover, is sitting cross-legged on the floor with the book of curses open in front of her
Her hair is down, she's wearing a caftan with a Zodiac print, there are candles everywhere and other vaguely occult decorating touches
Phil's business card is dropped into a dish
Then the Tarot card of the Hanged Man, a chicken bone, and a feather are placed on top of it
He stands at the sink, looking at himself in the mirror, flexing his muscles
Reading from the book> she mutters incantations in a secret language, then she sprinkles some powder on the plate, then a few drops of oil
Then she makes a few passes over it with her hands and, much to her surprise, the contents of the plate spontaneously combust
As he crosses to the bed, he accidentally knocks over the suitcase stand, spilling his clothes out onto the floor
-25- He contemplates picking them up for a moment, decides to leave them there, and flops down on the bed
He lies there looking u up at the ceiling until the room starts to spin around, then he closes his eyes and quickly drops off to sleep, still fully clothed
To complete the spell, she picks up a broken wristwatch and drops it into the fire
Phil's business card, the Hanged Man and the broken watch in flames
The watch crystal is cracked and the hands are frozen at 5:59
: - The digital clock-radio changes from 5:59 to 6:00
The radio comes on, playing the end of the Sonny and Cher hit, " Got You, Babe," just as it did the day before
'  - Phil sits up in bed, quickly alert, and looks around the room
Something is wrong
He's wearing pajamas, his suit is once again hanging neatly on the closet door and his suitcase is back on its stand at the foot of the bed, again neatly packed
The song ends and the same radio deejay and his sidekick come on with the same manic energy
Phil stares at the radio and listens to them
look of astonishment comes over his face as they banter
Okay, campers, rise and shine, and don't forget your booties because it's  out there today
It's cold out there everyday
What is this-- Miami Beach
The deejay laughs
Phil "mock" laughs at exactly the same time, recognizing the repartee from the previous morning
(to himself) Nice going guys
That's yesterday's tape
Phil crosses to the sink and gets a towel off the rack, only half-listening to the radio
-26- Not hardly
Expect hazardous travel later today with that, you know, blizzard thing -- That "blizzard thing
" Phil turns on the water and splashes some on his face as if trying to wake himself up, vaguely disturbed by the repetition of the broadcast
(
) Oh, here's the report: the National Weather Service is calling for a big blizzard thing
" Yes they are, but there's another reason today is very special -- Especially cold -- Especially cold, okay, but the big question on everybody's lips -- Phil supplies the next line in unison with the radio
Chapped lips -- -- on their chapped lips, right -- Do you think Phil's going to come out and see his shadow
Punxsutawney Phil
Some vague doubt causes Phil to go to the window
That's right, rodent lovers
'-- Groundhog Day
of   as Phil pulls back the curtains and looks out
The street is full of people heading toward Gobbler's Knob, exactly as they did the day before
-27- () What the hell
: - Phil rushes out into the corridor, hastily tying his tie, his suit jacket and overcoat over his arm
As he heads for the breakfast room, the same Chubby Man passes
Morning
Morning
Think it'll be an early Spring
(stops, irritated) Didn't we do this yesterday
() don't know what you mean
Phil grabs him by the front of his shirt and looks deep into his eyes
Don't mess with me, pork chop
What day is this
() Febr uary second--Groundhog Day
Phil can see he's telling the truth and relaxes his grip on the poor man
Okay
Sorry
'm having a bad day
Phil walks on, leaving the chubby man baffled and insulted
(to himself) 'll say
-28- - Phil enters the old library of the house and finds everything exactly as it was the day before
Mrs
Lancaster spots Phil as she comes out of the kitchen with the fresh pot of coffee
Did you sleep well, Mr
Connors
(completely confused) i d
don't know-- Would you like some coffee
Yes, thank you
' m feeling a little strange
( as she pours) wonder what the weather's going to be like for all the festivities
Did you ever have deja vu, Mrs
Lancaster
Is that the Italian dessert with the brandy and the chocolate mousse
No, that's spaghetti
Never mind
He heads for the door, still in a daze
Oh, will you be checking out today, Mr
Connors
() don't know
don't think so
'll tell you after  wake up
Phil exits
: -29- - Phil gulps down the steaming coffee, still trying to wake up from what he assumes is a dream, and descends the front steps of the house
He accosts a
Ma'am
Excuse me
Where's everybody going
To Gobbler's Knob
It's Groundhog Day
The coffee cup drops from Phil's hand as he stands there open- mouthed
Then he slaps his own face and shakes his head as if trying to clear it and starts off down the street
-  - Phil rushes down the street, again failing to notice the sitting on the sidewalk leaning against a storefront
(
) Hey, Phil
Ned Ryerson approaches with the same obnoxious attitude
Phil
Phil Connors
thought that was you
Phil just stares at him and keeps walking
My oh my
Phil Connors
Don't say you don't remember me, 'cause sure as heck-fire remember you
Well
Ned Ryerson
Bing
First shot right out of the box
So how's it going, ol' buddy
To tell you the truth, Neddy,  ' m not feeling real well
Could you excuse me
Now it's funny you should mention your health 'cause you'll never guess what  do
-30- (very distressed and desperate to get away from this guy) Do you sell insurance, Ned
Bing again
You're sharp as a tack today
Do you have life insurance, Phil
'Cause if you do,  bet you could use more -- who couldn't
" -- but  got a feeling you don't have any
Am right
(really annoyed now) Did  say "fuck off, " Ned can't talk to you right now
He backs away from Ned and steps right into the same deep, slushy puddle he stepped in the day before
() Hey, look
out for that first v step
It's a doozyi Phil looks down at his wet shoes and cuffs and stumbles off toward Gobbler's Knob
: '   - The crowd is gathered as before for the big moment
In the press area, Rita is having the same dialogue with Larry, when she spots Phil heading into the crowd
Here he comes
Phill Hey, Phil
Over here
Phil waves to her and heads straight for an obscure corner of the Knob, gesturing for her to follow
Larry shakes his head as Rita charges through the crowd toward Phil
She catches up to him just as he is scratching a mark in the snow with his foot
She notices immediately that he is uncharacteristically dishevelled, his tie askew, his hair mussed
Where ' ve you been
-31- (nervous, sweat ing) 've got to talk to you
think 'm losing my mind
know you're losing it
What are you doing over here
The camera's over there
Slap me, Rita
What is this
() Just slap me-- hard
She gives up and taps him lightly on the cheek
said hardl can't
Do it
Rita shrugs and slaps him very hard
(his cheek smarting) Better
Almost too hard, Rita
Are you drunk
No, drunk is more fun
Can  be serious with you for a minute
don't know
Can you
Yes
' m being serious
' m having a problem-- no,  may be having a problem
What are you trying to say
-32- 'm trying to say that if  was having a problem, just hypothetical ly,  ' d like to know that you're someone  could count on in a crisis
() What did you do last night
The crowd begins to hush
We better get started
We're going to miss it
Were not going to miss it
(indicating the other ) They're going to miss it
() Phil
We've been out here for an hour
We're cold and tired
Let's just get this and get out of here
Okay, put it here
What
Put the camera here
Rita takes a forlorn glance towards the press area, where all of the other cameras are set up
Phil , there is no tomorrow on this one
It's Groundhog Day
We were in the wrong spot yesterday
() ha t
Yesterday
What are you talking about
Just trust me
Put the camera here
-33- Rita looks at him like he's crazy, then looks at her watch and gives up
Larry
She charges off toward the cameras
In the Press Area, several reporters are already talking to their cameras, dribbling on about how "He could appear any second now
" Rita and Larry grab their gear and rush back to Phil
Larry hurriedly sets up the camera
You want me to roll tape
(to Phil) Are you going to get on your mark
No hurry
Larry glances over at the other news reporters, all talking to their cameras and pointing towards the mound
() Everyone else is rolling
Rita looks helplessly at Phil
'm begging you, all right
Gould we please just do this
Phil glances down at his watch
Okay, let's do it
He crosses over to Larry and taps him on the shoulder
Roll tape
() Prima donnas
Phil takes the microphone from Rita and positions himself against the fence
Rolling
-34- Phil does a similar intro to the one he did before, though this time it's a bit tentative
(to camera) We ll, it's Groundhog Day-- again-- and you know what that means
Everybody's here on Gobbler's Knob waiting in the cold for the appearance of the most famous groundhog in the world, Punxsutawney Phil, who's going to tell us just how much more of this we can expect
The Groundhog Club Official knocks on the groundhog's door, then opens it and retreats
Phil takes a deep breath and makes his first experimental prediction, recalling the previous day
My forecast is we're going to see the groundhog peek its head out of its hole, look around a little bit, then he's going to come out, scamper over to this general area, look at the crowd for a second, make a little burping noise and run back into the ground
(whispers to Larry) That's it
'm going to kill him
Phil looks at his watch
k ay
And here we go-- Phil points to the hole and Larry zooms in
The groundhog sticks his head out, looks left, looks right, steps out of the hole, and runs away from the press pool, directly over to Larry's camera
As he stands there, his body casts a long shadow
The groundhog looks right into the camera, lets out a squeak, and runs back into the hole
Rita and Larry are completely amazed as the crowd cheers the brief appearance of the groundhog
Larry pans back to Phil
Phil just stands there speechless, staring at the groundhog burrow
-35- () Phil
Buster Greene, the Groundhog club official, walks onto the mound and hushes the crowd, exactly as before
He came out, and he saw his shadow
Sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but it looks like it's going to be a long winter
Again the crowd lets out a good-natured "Awwwwww" in disappointment
Larry pans back to Phil just in time to see him walking away in a fog, without signing off
Then he pans back to Rita
(at a loss) For Channel 9 News, this is Rita Hanson in Punxsutawney
She holds for a moment then makes the cut sign, drawing her finger across her throat
: - ; ' Phil is on the phone desperately trying to make a call
(on the phone) know there's a blizzard, but have to get a call through to my doctor in Pittsburgh
It's a medical emergency
No, don't give me the Punxsutawney Fire Department
When do you think the long distance lines will be working again
But what if we don't have a tomorrow
We didn't have one today, my friend
Hello
Hello
He hangs up and shakes his head which is now really starting to ache, then he pops a handful of Tylenol, lies down and pulls the covers up over his head
moment later, he sits up, takes a pencil from the nightstand, breaks it in half and puts the pieces back on the nightstand
Then he lies back down and retreats back under the covers
: -36- - The digital clock-radio changes from 5:59 to 6:00
The radio comes on, playing the end of the Sonny and Cher hit, " Got You, Babe," just as it did the day before
'  - Phil sits up in bed fearing the worst and looks on the nightstand
The pencil is whole again
Completely stunned by the phenomenon, he jumps out of bed and starts dressing hurriedly as the morning Deejays begin their now familiar rap
Okay, campers, rise and shine, and don't forget your booties because it's  out there today
It's cold out there everyday
What is this-- Miami Beach
Phil rushes out of the room
: - Phil hurries toward the bed and breakfast carrying two gallon buckets of paint, and a couple of big bags from a hardware store
- Phil enters and passes Mrs
Lancaster in the breakfast room
Painting something, Mr
Connors
' m conducting an experiment
'  - Phil enters and dumps the bags on the bed
Out fall a couple of big paintbrushes, a small sledgehammer, a handsaw, a crowbar, plastic goggles and assorted other tools
He puts on the goggles, grabs a hammer and some nails and starts nailing the door shut
: -37- - Mrs
Lancaster and several other guests are gathered in the hall outside Phil's room, listening at the door and looking very worried
Loud music is playing inside the room
From inside the room, they hear the sound of loud hammering, wood splintering and glass breaking
'  - Phil, has demolished just about all the furniture and woodwork in the room
He rips off the last of the wooden moldings with the crowbar, then crosses to the mirror over the demolished sink
Phil stands there, staring at his image in the mirror, trying to figure out what's happening to him
He starts breathing heavier, as if gathering courage, then, just when we think he's going to cut off his ear or something, he raises an electric barber clipper and shaves a bald stripe up the middle of his head
He studies his new look for a moment then smashes the mirror with his sledgehammer
Then he opens the cans of paint, dips the two big brushes into the cans and starts slapping bright red paint onto the walls, madly, feverishly, splashing himself and everything else in the room with it
As a final touch he grabs the bed pillows and rips them open, then shakes them all around the room creating a storm of feathers
Finally, Phil falls exhausted on the bed
From outside we can hear outraged hotel employees pounding on the door
We pan over to the clock radio, the only undamaged object in the room
Feathers drift down past the face of the clock which reads 5:59
The time changes to 6:00, the radio clicks on and " Got You, Babe" starts playing as we pan back to Phil sleeping on the bed
He opens his eyes, jumps out of bed and looks around
No paint, no feathers, no damage
Everything is as clean and tidy as the day he checked in
He races over to the unbroken mirror and looks at himself
His hair is completely restored, as if it had never been shaved
The song ends and the deejays come on
Phil says every word right along with them, shocked into a state of complete wonderment
-38- Okay, campers, rise and shine, and don't forget your booties because it's  out there today
It's cold out there everyday
What is this -- Miami Beach
The deejay laughs
Phil laughs insanely along with him
: '   - Phil is wrapping up another groundhog report, trying to be completely professional despite the circumstances
(with forced good ) o according to Mr
Groundhog guess we can expect six more weeks of winter
It's not very scientific, but it sure is fun
Hey, wait a second
If he's right,  could be out of a job
(mock laugh) For Channel 9 News, this is Phil Connors in Punxsutawney
He holds until Larry stops tape, then approaches Rita
How was that
() It was good
little smarmy for my taste, but  guess that's what sells
Could  talk to you about a matter that is not work related
You never talk about work
Do you know what  did last night
Do  want to know
-39- destroyed my hotel room
You whatl This is not some kind of rock and roll tour
We don't have the budget for that-- No, it's okay
This morning it was all right again
That's what have to talk to you about
Phil, what are you doing
: - Phil and Rita cross the street and walk past a crowd of concerned citizens gathered around what looks like a car accident
As an ambulance arrives, Phil and Rita enter the cozy looking diner on the corner
- Phil and Rita sit together at the same table they had previously
The  approaches
(to waiter) Could  have some coffee, please
The waiter pours her a cup
() 'll be back to take your order
Thanks
(to Phil) Okay, so tell me
How'd you know where to put the camera
Because 've done it before
know, but the groundhog doesn't do exactly the same thing every year, does he
-40- ' m not talking about last year
' m talking about today
lived it before
You're having deja vu
Big time
Rita,  know it's nuts but  keep reliving the same day o ve r and over-- Groundhog Day-- today
This is the third time
(completely skeptical) Uh-huh
'm waiting for the punchline
No, really
It's like today never happened
shaved my head last night, today its all grown back
could probably cut off my limbs, one by one, and - pop
They'd grow back
Just like a starfish
probably don't even have to floss
'm wracking my brain, but can't even begin to imagine why you'd make up something like this
'Cause 'm not making it up
'm asking for your help
Rita looks at him for a long moment
Okay, 'll bite
What do you want me to do
The truth
'd 1ike you to spend the next 24 hours with me and don't leave my side for a second
see
You know, Phil, you can charm all the little
's at the station, all the secretaries, and even some of the weekend a nchors, but not me-- not in a thousand years
-41- Wa it a second-- Not if  was dying and your breath was the only cure; not if having your child was the only way to preserve the human race
Just get it out of your head because it is So much for the truth
Larry pokes his head in the doorway, looks around, spots Rita and makes his way over to their table
(to Rita) You ready
We better get going if we're going to stay ahead of the weather
Yeah, ,  ' m
ready, Larry
() Good luck, Phil
: -rays of Phil's skull are slapped up onto a light box
- Phil is having his head examined by a
No spots, no tumors, no lesions, no clots, no aneurisms
Everything looks fine and dandy to me, Mr
Connors
Have you considered psychiatric help
: '  - Punxsutawney's only  is a marriage and family counselor at the local Lutheran church
His appearance and manner indicate he may have some serious problems of his own
-42- (not too confident) That's kind of an unusual problem, Mr
Connors
Most of my work is with couples and families
Phil is lying on a couch
His head is completely shaved
Yeah, but you're still a psychologist
You must have had some course in school that covered this kind of thing
Sort of,  guess
Abnormal Psychology
So based on that what would you say
() ' d say that maybe you're -- don't know -- a little delusional
You're saying this thing is not really happening to me
Uh-huh
Then how do  know this conversation is really happening
guess you don't
Then forget about me paying you
discreet little alarm sounds
() 'm afraid that's all the time we have, Mr
Connors
Wait
Are you saying 'm crazy
-43- (humoring him) Not necessarily
If it concerns you we should schedule our next session as soon as possible
How's tomorrow for you
Phil glowers at him
: - in a white lab coat is holding up the model
Phil looks on with interest
() Now if the moon exerts a gravitational pull strong enough to cause the tides,
then it may be theoretically possible for a Black Hole or a Singularity of sufficient magnitude to actually bend time enough to cause it to fold back ,on itself
You think that's a realistic possibility
paper airplane sails past his head, accompanied by a noisy outburst of juvenile laughter
We pull back to : - Twenty-five eighth-graders running amok
() All right
think someone may just need a little visit to the Assistant Principal's office
Get back in your seats
The bell has not rung yet
The kids sit back down, but keep up their noisy chatter
(to Phil) Well,  ' m speaking purely hypothetically
: -44- - Phil is walking toward the exit when he passes a first grade classroom
The door is open and the  is discussing a story with the class
So the princess picked up the frog and kissed him
Phil stops outside the door to listen
- Now who can tell me what happened when the princess kissed the frog
Her lips got slimed
The whole class erupts in giggles and shrieks
Okay, come on now
What happened when she kissed the frog
The princess kissed the frog and the spell got broke and he turned into a handsome prince and they got married and lived happily ever after
That's right
- Phil is leaning against the wall listening
There is something very arresting about the fairy tale, but finally he just shakes his head and exits
: - Phil is at a bar getting drunk with two local blue-collar workers,  and
Gus, what would you do if there was no tomorrow
-45- You mean like if the world was gonna end
No,  mean like if it was never going to end
If everyday was the same and you were stuck here and you couldn't get out and nothing you did mattered
You're right
Everyday is the same,  can't get out of here and nothin'  do matters
No, he's askin1 you a question, ya idiot
What was the question
What if nothing mattered
Jeez, know what 'd do
' d j ust spend all my time drivin' fast, gettin1 loaded and gettin' laid
That's it
That's it
It just doesn't get any better than this, does it
Good friends, good conversation and quality brew
Drink up, boys
They salute each other and drink
: - Phil, Gus and Ralph approach Ralph's big, black, old Buick convertible parked outside the bar
They are even drunker than they were before
(fumbling with his ) Where you stayin', Phil
We'll drop you off
Hey, friends don't let friends drive drunk
Give me your keys
-46- He's as wasted as they are, but Ralph hands over his keys without a fight
Thanks , man
It's nothing
Get in
They all pile into the front seat with Phil at the wheel
(starting the ear) Seatbelts
Ralph and Gus give him the thumbs up sign and start digging around in the seat cracks for their seatbelts
Suddenly, Phil floors the accelerator and peels away, sideswiping a parked car as he screeches around the corner
- Phil is having a great time
Gus and Ralph are whooping it up like kids on a roller coaster
This is great, Ralph
Oh, hey, take a left
Phil passes the intersection
You missed it
No problem -- - Phil throws the car into a high-speed, skidding -turn, goes up on the curb, across a couple of lawns, takes out a mailbox and a  sign and bounces back onto the street
parked in front of the hardware store pulls out and takes off after him
- Phil swerves in and out of oncoming traffic
Gus is starting to look a little green
So many rules -- -47- You can say that again
"Don't do this--" - The Buick demolishes a parked car
(
) "Don't do that -- " He mows down a row of parking meters
It comes screaming around a corner in hot pursuit of the Buick - Ralph hears the siren and looks back at the police car
All right
Try and stop us, you mothers
No more rules
No more rules
- second police car joins the chase
(looking back) That's two
Having a good time
'm having a great time
Phil speeds up to a hundred miles and hour
Gus is looking even worse from the liquor and the motion of the car
Hey, uh -- Phil
-48- Yeah, Phil-- like the groundhog
Right
Hey, Phil
How're we going to get out of this
- Two police cars with lights flashing are parked sideways, completely blocking the road
Officers stand in the roadway, motioning for Phil to stop
() Gus, you're just going to have to trust me on this one
He tromps the gas pedal to the floor
Gus's eyes go wide with terror
The police dive out of the way
Yahooooo
- The Buick crashes head on into one of the police cars
: - The time changes from 5:59 to 6:00
The radio starts playing " Got You, Babe
" Phil sits up suddenly and looks around, completely amazed
He is in his room at the bed and breakfast, everything exactly the same as before
He hops out of bed and quickly examines himself for signs of physical injury
Nothing
The music ends and the two deej ays come on
Okay, campers, rise and shine, and don't forget your booties because it's  out there today
Phil talks out loud along with them
It's cold out there everyday
What is this-- Miami Beach
-49- The deejays laughs
Phil laughs, too, exhilirated at having survived the car wreck, still very confused and perplexed, but just beginning to see the possibilities of his unique situation
He starts dressing in a hurry
: - Phil rushes into the breakfast room just as Mrs
Lancaster comes out of the kitchen with the coffee
Everything is exactly the same as before
o u l d you-- Phil interrupts, answering all her questions before she even asks them
() Yes,  would like some coffee; the weather is going to be cold and overcast with blizzard conditions moving in later today; and yes,  will be staying an extra day
() Why thank you
Mrs
Lancaster, has anyone been around here looking for me this morning
Maybe a state official, blue coat, hat, gun, nightstick, badge, driving a late-model Ford br Chevy, black and white with bub ble lights on top-- () No, no one like that--
don't-- Will they be
(greatly relieved) Apparently not
Phil gooses her, grabs a sweet roll, and heads for the door, starting to believe now that he can truly do anything he wants to
: -50- - Phil stops on the steps, puts on his coat and gloves and again joins the traffic heading toward Gobbler's Knob
- Phil passes the old bum, ignoring him as usual
(
) Hey, Phil
Phil slips off his glove as Ned Ryerson lumbers toward him
Phil
Phil Connors
Ned
Ned Ryerson
Ned the Head
Before Ned can say another word, Phil
Ned goes down, Phil puts his glove back on and keeps walking
Phil deftly avoids the slushy pothole he stepped in before walking behind him steps right into it
: '  - Phil is passing through the crowd on his way to the press area when he notices , the girl he met at the hotel bar, and stops to talk to her
You here to see the groundhog
She gives him a look
It's obvious she's never seen him before
Can you think of another reason anybody'd be out here at dawn on a freezing day
What's your name
Nancy Taylor
And you are-- Where'd you go to high school
-51- What is this
() High school
She really doesn't know what to make of Phil but she decides to play along
Lincoln High school
In Pittsburgh
Who are you
Who was your twelfth grade English teacher
Are you kidding
'm waiting
Mrs
Walsh
Walsh
Nancy, Lincoln, Walsh
Is this some kind of come-on
'm not really sure
We'll have to see
Phil walks off and joins Rita at their camera position
: - Phil is sitting at his usual table, which is covered with an incredible variety of rich foods-- eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, pies, cakes, eclairs, ice cream, puddings, etc
Rita sits across from him, watching in amazement as he stuffs himself with pastry
Is this some new fad diet
Don't you worry about cholesterol
Phil scrapes a plate and takes a final bite of a chocolate eclair
-52- don't worry about anything anymore
What makes you so special
Everybody worries about something
That's exactly what makes me so special
He takes a big bite of cake
Rita shakes her head
(with his mouth full) What
"The wretch, concentered all in self, Living, shall forfeit fair renown, And doubly dying, shall go down to the vile dust from whence he sprung, Unwept, unhonored, and unsung
" Sir Walter Scott
(stares at her for a long moment) "There was a young man from Na n t uc k e t-- " That's really funny
When are you going to grow up, Phil
At this rate-- never
(he pulls out a pack of ) Okay if  smoke
Rita shrugs
Phil lights up a cigarette
You really do have a death wish, don't you
Just the opposite, Rita
have a life wish
'm just trying to enjoy it
Taking pleasure in the little things
Don't you ever just want to cut loose and go wild
-53- wouldn't even know what it means to go wild
Yeah, well, that's where  come in
Going wild is one of my specialties
Last night  got completely loaded and drove head- on into a police car
() Oh, really
You look pretty good this morning
That's my point
know you won't believe me, but we could do anything we want today and it wouldn't matter one bit
Absolutely no consequences
Complete and total freedom
And how
, do we manage that
You leave that to me
Why don't you send Larry back and hang out with me for the rest of the day
You never make it through that blizzard anyway
Larry enters the diner and spots them
'll take my chances with the -weather
But you have a good time
Don't worry
plan to
: '  - Phil comes through the crowd and finds Nancy in the same spot she was in the day before
Nancy
Nancy turns and looks at him quizzically
-54- Nancy, right
'm sorry, -- Nancy Taylor
Lincoln High sat next to you in Mrs
Walsh's English class
h at -- Phil Connors
--is amazing
You don't remember me, do you
don't-- sure,  think-- We used to shoot spit balls-- Yeah, oh, God-- even asked you to the prom
Phil Connors
Yeah
How  you
' m great
Wow, you look terrific
Hey, listen,  gotta d o this report-- You're a reporter
Weatherman
Channel 9, Pittsburgh
Right,  should've known-- -55- But maybe after we could -- Yeah, yeah,  ' d like that -- (
) Phil
Rita is calling from across the crowd
She looks at him with disapproval
: '  - Phil is making passionate love to a  in the dark
() Oh, Phil
Oh , Rita
The woman suddenly freezes
There is a moment of silence, then she snaps on the light
It's Nancy, not Rita
Phil is as surprised as she is by his slip of the tongue
() Who's Rita
() No one
It's just something say when  make love
You know -- "Orita", "Orighta"-- it's like "Oh, baby" or something
(not entirely ) Oh
(corrects her) -rita
Nancy laughs uncertainly
Phil switches off the light, thinking now about Rita
: -56- - Some elderly  are sipping coffee and eating breakfast, staring uncomfortably at something on the other side of the room
Phil is standing at the bookcase, wearing only pajamas, absently munching on a Danish as he reads from one of the books
Mrs
Lancaster approaches him
Isn't it a wonderful collection
(not looking up) Yes, it is
You don't usually find this many trashy novels in one place
You can take a book up to your room if you like
No, thank you
've actually read them all
was just rereading some of the dirty parts
He finishes and puts the book back on the shelf
() How long will you be staying with us, Mr
Connors
Indefinitely
've already been here for 211 days
(humoring him) Really
That's quite a long time, isn't it
hope you're finding things to do in our little town
() Yes, well, 'm getting a little tired of casual sex so today thought 'd rob a bank and buy myself a really expensive car
-57- Phil kisses her on the lips and walks off
: - Two harmless-looking old  are calmly loading bags of cash into an armored car parked in front of a local bank
Suddenly Phil appears, wielding a shotgun, wearing a Batman style cape, his face completely hidden by a ski mask
() All right, freeze
Drop your guns
The guards stand there frozen with terror
You guys ever been held up before
(they shake their ) It's kind of exciting, isn't it
() guess so
Something to tell the kids about
Yeah
By the way, 'm Phil
He raises the mask and shows his face
Herman
Felix
(shaking their hands) Herman and Felix
Okay
Take it easy, boys
And thanks
The frightened guards watch as Phil makes off with two large satchels of cash
: - Phil pats the hood of a used  850 sports car as a stands by beaming
Phil is wearing a full Steelers football uniform complete with shoulder pads
-58- real beauty, huh
We picked it u p at a-- 'll take it
How much
Well, the sticker says $62,999 bu t if you want-- 'll tell you what
'll give you $70,000 if you just knock off the car salesman stuff and let me get out of here with my car
The Salesman gawks as Phil opens his briefcase and starts counting out stacks of bills
: - From a high angle, we see the  tearing around the streets of the town as if running a Grand Prix road race
: - The  comes screeching to a stop right in front of the movie theater and the door opens
pair of really elaborate cowboy boots complete with silver spurs hits the pavement first; then we   to see Phil emerge from the car wearing a really gaudy; full cowboy outfit with real six-guns on his hips
very trashy-looking girl, , gets out on the passenger side, dressed like a French maid
(very self-conscious) thought we were going to a costume party
Yeah, we are, we are
But first have this movie theater fantasy want to talk to you about
He escorts her into the theater
: -59- - Phil is lying on the table, getting elaborately tattooed
Rita walks by, looks in the window and is shocked to see Phil there
Phil waves at her and points to the colorful new heart pierced by a bloody dagger being tattooed on his arm
: - We pan down the line of    to
Phil, dressed all in black leathers, both arms heavily tattooed, looking like Sid Viscious on crack
He takes off his hat to reveal red, white and blue hair shaved almost down to his skull
slut named  and another overweight, not very pretty -, both in too-tight jeans and bullet bras are coming on to him, practically licking his ears
Angie pops a couple of mystery pills into his mouth
Phil washes them down with a shot and a beer
: '  - It looks like ;outtakes from Fellini's "Satyricon
" Heavy metal is blaring from the radio, as several unsavory looking men and women are partying down, a few already passed out, sleeping off whatever hit them
Someone is knocking loudly on the door, shouting complaints about the music
beer bottle smashes against the door
Phil is sitting up on the bed with Angie
He has his arm around her shoulder and a fifth of Wild Turkey in his hand
(more to himself than to Angie) Yeah, but eventually you' d just get tired of screwing around and then you'd want a real relationship, wouldn't you
don't know
big German Shepherd tries to jump up on the bed with them
Get down, Brunoi () Someone decent, someone who you respected, who respects you
-60- guess so
The dog jumps up again
Down , Bruno
(still musing) It's tough to find a relationship like that, especially if your time is kind of limited
But you still have to try, don't you
(the dog again) Bruno
told you
Off the bed
Phil looks over at Angle who's passed out with her mouth open There ' s got to be more to it than this
: - Rita is in the news van reviewing the tape of Phil's report Phil hovers at the open side door
You look good
mean, it came o ut all right
How'd you know where to put the camera
Psychic
So did you have a nice evening
() just had a sandwich, watched some  and went to bed
got my whole body tattooed and part ied all night with some nymphomaniac biker chicks
() Sounds wholesome
Were those the new 24-hour disappearing tattoos or can  see them
No, they're gone
Rita, if you only had one day to live, what would you do with it
-61- She switches off the videotape and steps out of the van
don't know, Phil
What are you dying of
No,  mean like what if the entire world was about to explode
' d just want to know where to p ut the camera
What are you looking for, Phil-- a date for the weekend
She starts walking toward the center of town
Phil sticks right with her
No,  just want to know you better
What do you like, what do you want, what do you think about, what kind of men are you interested in, what do you do for fun
(she stops) Is this real or are you just going to make me feel like a fool
'm just trying to talk to you like a normal person
Isn't this how normal people talk
Close
Okay, so talk to me
'mon, 'll buy you a cup of coffee
: - Phil and Rita are at their usual table, drinking coffee
guess  want what everybody wants-- you know, career, love, marriage, children
So far don't have any of it
-62- You have a career
have a job
Doing stories on the Punxsutawney groundhog is not my ultimate goal
No offense
How about the other stuff
You seeing anybody
This is getting too personal don't think  ' m ready to discuss these things with you
What about you
What do you want
What  really want is someone like you
h , please-- Why not
Phil, you know, you have so much talent and ability
If you'd just drop the attitude and act like a decent human being, then maybe  ' d -- (she hesitates) You'd what
don't know what
Then maybe you'd like me
She stares hard at him
don't know
It's sort of like the way  feel about 's
'd have to see it to believe it
Larry pokes his head in the doorway, looks around, spots Rita and makes his way over to their table
-63- (to Rita) You ready
We better get going if we're going to stay ahead of the weather
Yeah, 'll be right out, Larry
Larry scowls at Phil and exits
(to Rita) Why don't you stay for a while
The road's going to be closed anyway
Do you really want to be stuck in the van with Larry for three hours
've got to get back
'll see you later
Phil watches Rita exit
' Rita gets in the news van and drives off with Larry
Phil stares out the window, more" determined than ever to win her over
: - Phil is wrapping up his groundhog report
Well, you heard it right from the groundhog's mouth
Bundle up good, 'cause it's going to be a long winter-- at least in Punxsutawney
Reporting for Channel 9, this is Phil Connors
Larry stops tape
That was great
How did you know -- () have to go now
There's something  have to do
-64- Phil runs off without another word of explanation
: - Phil has the hood open and is doing something to the engine
: - Rita is sitting at the bar in the town's best restaurant, a good chophouse with Black Forest decor and waitresses dressed in dirndl skirts and aprons
Phil enters and sits down next to her
(acting surprised) Oh, hi, Rita
You still here
() The van won't start
Larry's working on it
() Wouldn't you know it
Buy you a drink
Okay
(to the bartender) Jack Daniels
For you, miss
Tequila,with lime
Gold, if you've got it
Phil nods to himself
: - Phil walks in and sits next to Rita
(acting surprised) Oh, hi, Rita
You still here
-65- () The van won't start
Larry's working on it
Wouldn't you know it
Buy you a drink
Okay
(to the bartender) Tequila with lime, gold if you've got it
Rita looks at Phil, surprised
For you miss
Same for me, please
The  pours
(to Rita) What should we toast to
Your call
To the groundhog
Rita stares for a moment
always drink to world peace
: - Take your order
Tequila with lime, gold if you've got it
Rita looks at Phil
, For you, miss
-66- Same for me, please
The  pours
Phil lifts his glass
To world peace
Rita smiles, reevaluating him
To world peace
They clink glasses
: - Rita and Phil are now sitting together at a table, a plate of cheese and crackers and a bottle of white wine between them
You like your job
It's okay
think it could be really challenging
Of course it's about a million miles from where  started out in college
You weren't in broadcasting
At Bryn Mawr
No, uh-uh
"Believe it or not,  studied Nineteenth Century French Poetry
(laughs good-naturedly) Really
What a waste of time
Rita looks offended
Phil knows he made a mistake
: - You weren't in broadcasting
-67- At Bryn Mawr
No, uh-uh
Believe it or not,  studied Nineteenth Century French Poetry
Phil leans in closer to her
La fille qui j'aimera Sera comme bon vin Qui se bonifiera Un peut chaque matin
Rita smiles, entranced
: - Phil and Rita are sitting at a table in a small confectionery, tasting chunks of different flavored fudge
Rita takes a bite This is terrific
Best fudge in town
How do you know so much about Punxsutawney
like small towns
think they engender real community more than big cities
That is so true
've always thought that, too
No kidding
Here-- try the white chocolate
Oh, yuk, don't make me sick
(making mental note) No white chocolate
There's something so familiar about this
Do you ever have deja vu
Phil smiles
Then Larry enters
-68- (irate, to Rita) don't believe it
Someone bought every distributor cap in this town
We're going to be stuck here all night1 Over Phil's sympathetic look we hear the song, " Can't Get Started With You"
: - The music continues over Rita and Phil on the small dance floor
They dance, close, dreamy, romantic
: - There is a light snow falling
Phil and Rita are making a little snowman
Somehow the town looks magical tonight-- old fashioned, wholesome
snowball hits Phil in the back
He and Rita turn around to see a giggling
Phil packs a snowball and tosses it
The kid throws one back
Rita and Phil both get into it, packing snowballs and getting into a war with this kid and his little gang of friends
snowball catches Rita unaware, she slips and goes down in a snowbank
Phil bends down to help her and slips
They are no together, lying in the snow, laughing
Their eyes lock for a long sweet moment, then Rita gets embarrassed and stands up
: - Phil and Rita are walking slowly, very close
What
' m just amazed
And 'm not easily amazed
About what
-69- How you can start a day with one kind of expectation and end up so completely different
Do you like how this day is turning out
Yes
like it very much
They stop dn front of Phil's hotel
She turns to him
You could never have planned a day like this, but it couldn't have been more perfect
You're wrong
've been planning this day for weeks
Rita ignores the remark and hugs him
Phil tries to kiss her but she gently puts her fingers to his lips, stopping him
\ They enter the bed and breakfast inn
- Rita hugs him again and starts to exit
Thanks
See you tomorrow
Tomorrow
Wait, aren't you going to come up to my room for a while
(very reluctant) don't know, Phil-- Noreason to end a perfect day
() Well-- we better not
No, you should
The, uh, the poetry
've got some books, Rimbaud, Beaudelaire, we could l ig ht a fire-- -70- Thanks, but -- (seeing it all slip ) Please come, Rita
It'll be -- () Phil, 'm tired
We can be together tomorrow
(getting desperate) But there is no tomorrow for me
() Let's not ruin it, Phil
There's no way  ' m sleeping with you tonight
Why not
Rita,  love you
You don't even know me
(grabs her hand) Please
You have to
Rita shakes loose from his grasp
What's wrong with you
There is a long moment of silent tension, then all her old doubts about Phil come rushing back
(shaking her head) Oh, no
can't believe  fell for it
This whole day was just one long set-up
And  ate fudge
Yucchh
hate fudge
No, it was real
love you
Stop saying that
Do you really expect me to trust you
The whole secretarial pool is a Phil Connors recovery group
-71- But  can change
really can-- Rita slaps him hard on the cheek
That's for making me care about you
She turns and stomps off, leaving Phil standing there hurting
: - The snowball fight with the kids is going on as before
Phil falls into the snowbank with Rita and they almost kiss
: - Phil is trying () to talk his way into Rita's room
She ^pushes him away and slams the door in his face
: - The streets are deserted except for Phil, staring up at Rita's window in the Quality Inn
Rita comes to her window and looks out
She sees Phil looking up at her and draws the curtains
: '  - " Got You, Babe" is playing
Phil hits the clock radio to turn it off
He lies there for a moment, then hefts himself heavily out of bed, not eager to repeat the day yet another time
With the radio off, Phil does the deejays' morning routine himself, seemingly for the millionth time
() Okay, campers, rise and shine, and don't forget your booties because it's cooooold out there today
Phil continues the radio report at his own pace, obviously fatigued
-72- It's cold out there everyday
What is this -- Miami Beach
Haw
Not hardly
And you can expect hazardous travel later today with that, you know, blizzard thing
: '  - Phil is walking through the crowd
He spots Nancy, walks up to her and greets her half-heartedly
Hi, Nancy
() Hi
Do  know you
Phil can't manage enough enthusiasm to pursue her yet again
No,  guess not
thought you were someone else
Phil wanders over to where Rita and Larry are setting up the camera
Rita comes over to him
Are you all right, Phil
You look terrible
Phil looks at her sadly, then turns away
() ' m fine
: - The balls  as the cue ball breaks the rack
Phil is walking around the table, cue in hand, sinking ball after ball, while several admiring  look on
Who is this guy
-73- don't know
Hey, mister-- (Phil doesn't stop ) Who are you, anyway
Phil shoots, sinks a tough one
You don't know me
've been playing here every day for two months
Oh, yeah
So how come  ain't seen you
don't know
seen you
So what's your name
They call me-- Punxsutawney Phil
Punxsutawney Phil
Like the groundhog
Yeah, like the groundhog
Phil sinks another one
: '  - The crowd is waiting expectantly for the groundhog to appear Phil is a wreck, squatting unprofessionally in front of the camera
() This is one of the most pitiful spectacles known to civilization
With one nod from a filthy rodent best known to pest control agencies, a moribund old coal mining hamlet turns magically into the Lourdes of Pennsylvania, Mecca to thousands of people who, if they hated the winter so damned much, why don't they move to Florida, anyway
-74- Larry and Rita look on, incredulous
: - The program
is playing
(on ) Nobel prize-winning co- discoverers of the  molecule
(
) Who are Watson and Crick
(on ) Who are Watson and Crick
(on ) Correct
There is a cheering from a small group of people off-screen
- Phil is sitting in his bathrobe in a big lounge chair in the parlor of his hotel
Mrs
Lancaster, and other guests watch his performance, awed by his "intellect
" (on ) Twin brother and sister Sebastian and Olivia create confusion in this Shakespearean comedy
What is "Twelfth Night
" (on ) What is "Twelfth Night
" (on ) Correct
More cheering from the small group
(on ) 'll take New Jersey for eight hundred, Alex
-75- (on ) And the answer is-- an audio daily double
Count Basie
: - Phil is walking through town, still dressed only in his pajamas and overcoat, counting the sidewalk cracks, taking giants steps from one to the next
He looks crazy
Two thousand six hundred and s e ve n ty -o n e-- (takes another step) two thousand six hundred and se v en t y -t w o -- (another step) two thousand six hundred and seventy-thr-ee-^- woman passes walking her dog
Hey, pick up after your dog
He hasn't done anything
He's going to
() There and there
And there
Phil continues walking, counting the sidewalk cracks notice Phil and walk along, matching him step for step
Two thousand six hundred and seventy-four, two thousand six hundred and seventy-five, two '-- Five million eight hundred-- i x hundred-- Ninety, twenty, four, six, fifty-- -76- Two thousand, four hundred-- , Two, eight, nine, forty-six-- Phil stops
He has lost count
His lip curls up like an animal as he turns slowly, growling at the kids
They run away screaming with glee
Phil starts after them but runs right into a
You got a problem, buddy
(out of control) Yeah,  got a problem, buddy can't stand this place anymore
can't stand this street and can't stand the fourteen bars and the five banks and the one star food and the bad weather and the "quaint" little shops and most of all,  can't stand anything-- -- with a groundhog on it
He rips a groundhog patch off the cop's jacket sleeve
() Okay
Then let's see what we can do about getting you out of here
You got a name
(eyes downcast) Phil
Phil
Like the groundhog
Phil turns to the cop like a rabid dog, ready to strike
Yeah, like the-- (he stops as if struck) --groundhog
Some big new idea has formed in his mind
: '  - Rita is looking at Phil as Larry videotapes his report
-77- (turning to Rita) The guy's nuts
He's out of his gourd
Let him finish, then 'll call the station
They turn back to watch Phil's wrap-up
Phil is completely unkempt, still wearing only pajama bottoms and his overcoat, looking even more demented
(to camera) There is no way this winter is ever going to end as long as that groundhog keeps seeing his shadow everyday
don't see any other way out
He's got to be stopped and 've got to stop him
For Channel 9 news, this is Phil Connors
: '  - Phil is walking around the mound, casing it out
He takes a rifle out from under his coat and sneaks up to the burrow
He pulls a smoke bomb from his pocket, lights it, and throws it into the hole, then scurries for the edge of the knob and hits the deck
He lifts his rifle and aims it
Smoke is now pouring from the mound
Lots of it
Phil waits, his trigger finger twitching
casually walks by, stops
She surveys the situation
He ain't there
Phil doesn't move
He-doesn't care that she sees him
You can wait all night, but he ain't coming out
He don't live there
They keep him in the library
Phil's gun droops
The woman begins to walk off, then stops
Plug him once for me
-78- She leaves
: - Phil passes a pedestal bearing a life-size bronze statue of the groundhog and enters the public library
- Phil walks past the front desk looking very haggard and dangerous, and enters the children's section
No one is present except the ' , a young woman, reshelving books in the stacks
He looks around quickly and sees a window in the wall and over it a large sign which reads: "Punxsutawney Phil - The Great Prognosticates" Phil heads right for it
The groundhog scurries around his little temperature-controlled habitat, oblivious to the approaching danger
As Phil approaches the groundhog display, he reaches into his overcoat and pulls out a pump shotgun with a short pistol grip
The children's librarian sees the gun and freezes
Phil pumps a shell into the chamber as he walks right up to the case
' The groundhog looks right into his sights
Philsqueezes the trigger
The glass window is still intact, not a scratch on it
The groundhog looks up playfully
Phil fires off four more rounds but, again, no results
Phil can't believe it
He charges the glass and pounds it with the rifle butt
He can't even chip it
Suddenly he is seized from behind by    who take the rifle from him and wrestle him to floor
The librarian comes running up and looks at the groundhog
Is he all right
He's just fine
That's two inches of bullet-proof glass there
You can't be too careful in this day and age
-79- : '  - The groundhog is just poking his head out of the hole
He stands full height and looks around
Phil looks directly at the groundhog with hate and scheming madness
Suddenly, Phil whips out a big kitchen knife from under his icoat and dives at the groundhog
Town officials and police throw themselves on Phil as the groundhog scampers safely back into his hole
Rita and Larry videotape the incident, aghast at Phil's insane attack
: '  - Larry and Rita are loading their equipment back into the van
Rita spots Phil standing on the other side of the crowd, staring at her
She marches straight over to him, furious
Where were you this morning
How could you possibly miss the shoot
(at the end of his ) 've come to the end of me, Rita
There's only one way out now
Just remember/we had a wonderful day together once
Phil kisses her gently on the cheek and walks off toward the back of the knob
Rita watches him, then follows at a discreet distance, very worried
In a small clearing behind the man-made groundhog burrow, Buster Greene and  other    are lifting a cage into the front seat of Buster's pickup
(to the groundhog) There you go, ol' buddy
Good job
Hey
He smiled at me
See that
Right
-80- (securing the cage) There, little fella
The other official looks up and sees Phil walking toward them like a zombie
Hi, there, mister
Something can do you for
Without a word, Phil jumps quickly into the cab of the pickup and starts it up
Hey
What 're you --
Phil drives off in Buster's truck
Rita witnesses the groundhog-napping and runs back toward the knob
() Larry
Buster and his aides race for another car parked nearby
Jake
Call the police, and get the word out
Somebody kidnapped Phil
We're going after him
Come on, Tommy
They jump into a car, Buster guns the engine and takes off after the pickup
Rita runs up to Larry and grabs the camera on the fly
Let's go
Phil just snatched the groundhog
Larry does a slow take and starts gathering up the rest of the gear
() Probably some kind of gerbil deal
Pervert
: -81- - Phil comes tearing around a slippery curve, followed by Buster in his car, and close behind him, a contingent of police cars and the Channel 9 news van
- Phil looks at the groundhog on the seat next to him, then punches the gas as he turns up a mountain drive
Coming to the end of the trail, Phil
Then we're going out in a blaze of glory
'  - Buster pursues Phil with relentless determination
Nobody takes my groundhog and gets away with it
- Rita is driving
Larry is hooking up the camera
(very upset) What is he doing
What can he be thinking
He must1 ve just -- snapped
Larry squeezes into the passenger seat with the camera mounted on his shoulder
This oughta be good
- The cars chase the pickup to the top of the mountain
'  - Okay
know this road
There's no way off ' cept the way we come up
All right
We got him now
-82- '  - The pickup is losing its lead over the pursuers as it nears the sharp mountain cliff
- Phil looks in his rearview mirror at the cars chasing him
He glances down at the groundhog
He takes a breath
Okay, pal
It's showtime
Phil hits the gas
- Larry is taping as Rita comes around the curve just in time to see the pickup truck speeding toward the cliff
Rita hits the brakes and watches in horror
'  - The pickup bursts through a retaining fence and rockets over the edge of the cliff
The pickup seems to hang in the air for a long time, then it begins its   descent, falling ever so gracefully until it impacts on the granite rock face far below
Then a small click, followed by " Got You, Babe
" : He slowly opens his eyes and blinks
He looks around and realizes he's back in his room at the bed and breakfast
Ah, nuts
Phil throws off the covers and hurls himself out of bed
: -83- '  - Ned and a client are huddled over his desk, looking at some papers
quickly past the window behind them
It's Phil
They rush to the window and look down at the sidewalk three stories below
Phil is sprawled there like a broken puppet, lifeless
'  - " Got You, Babe" is playing
Phil wakes up and smashes the radio
: - Rita and Larry are walking down the street when a pulls out of the bus station and accelerates down Main Street
Suddenly, Phil, dressed in pajamas and overcoat, leaps out in front of the speeding bus
Rita witnesses the whole incident
' He sees Phil through the windshield but doesn't even have time to hit the brakes before he runs right over Phil
: woman in some horror movie is screaming
Mrs
Lancaster is watching  in the parlor of the hotel
In the corridor behind her, Phil walks by, dressed in a robe, carrying an electric toaster and a towel, heading for the bathroom
few moments pass
We hear the zap of an electrocution, the lights and  flicker and dim for a moment, then come back on again
: - The building is surrounded by police, all crouched behind their cars with guns and rifles trained on the doors
-84- Suddenly, the doors burst open and Phil comes running out of the bank screaming, dressed in camouflage fatigues and armed to the teeth with an assault rifle in one hand, an Uzi in the other and a couple of handguns stuck in his belt
He doesn't get three feet before he is shot down in an incredible hail of gunfire
Rita stands beside the camera gaping in horror while Larry records the grisly massacre
' - Rita stands by weeping while Phil's body is covered with a sheet
In the shadowy darkness under the sheet, a  is heard and Phil's eyes pop open
" Got You, Babe" plays
'  - Phil pulls the sheet off his face and finds himself back in his bed in his room
tear falls from his eye
: - Phil and Rita are sitting in the diner at their regular table
' m sorry
What was that again
'm a god
You're God
No, 'm  god
Not  God-- at least  don't think  am
That's reassuring
For a mintute there  thought you might be crazy
No, it's true
It's the only possible explanation
'm a supernatural being
Because you survived a car wreck
-85- The waiter comes to the table
Are you ready to order
(to Rita, ignoring the ) Not just the car wreck
didn't just blow up yesterday, you know
've been run over, drowned, crushed, stabbed, shot, electrocuted, poisoned, frozen, burn ed, and asphyxiated-- Really
The waiter looks at him like he's nuts
--but  always wake up the next day without a scratch, without even a headache
'm telling you,  ' m immortal
The special today is blueberry waffles
Why are you telling me this
() Because some people like blueberry waffles
(to the waiter) No t you-- him
Because  want you to believe in me
You're not a god, Phil
Take my word for it
This is twelve years of Catholic school talking
could come back if you're not ready
How do you know 'm not a god
-86- Please
How do you know
Because it's not possible
'll come back
The /waiter turns to leave
Hey, Billy
The waiter turns back
This is Bill
He's been a waiter for three years because he left Penn State and had to find work
He likes the town, he paints toy soldiers, and he's gay
am notl Phil grabs an astonished Rita and pulls her over to the next table
What are you doing
This is Doris Kleiser and her fiance Fred
Do  know you
They're supposed to get married tonight but Doris is having second thoughts
What
Doris touces her engagement ring, dumbfounded
Rita is a little embarrassed
Lovely ring
Thanks
-87- Phil drags Rita to the counter
This is Ralph
Say "Hi," Rita
Rita flashes a quick smile
Don't believe 've had the-- Ralph hates his life here and wants to drive around town smashing into policemen
Well, who don't
This is some kind of trick
Yes, it's a trick
But maybe the real God cheats, too
Maybe God isn't omnipotent-- he's just had a lot of practice
How about that guy
Tom
Worked in the coal mine til they shut it down
Her
' Nancy
Went to Lincoln High School in Pittsburgh
Takes herself out to lunch once a week
Rita is getting very bewildered
From their reactions she can see that Phil is right about each and every one of them
How do you know these people
told you the truth
In five seconds there's going to be a grease fire in the kitchen
Five, four-- This is nuts
-88- --three, two, one
Phil points to the kitchen as smoke starts pouring from the service window
Everyone in the diner is now staring at them (trying to puzzle it ) Okay, enough
Let's just sit down and think for a second
(they sit) What do you know about me, Phil
Do you know me, too
Phil takes a long pause
know all about you, Rita know you like producing, but hope for better than Channel 9, Pittsburgh
Everyone knows that
You like boats but not the ocean
There's a lake you go to in the summer with your family, up in the mountains, with an old wooden dock and a boathouse with boards missing in the roof, and a place you used to crawl underneath to be alone, and at night you'd look up and see the stars
You're a sucker for Rocky Road, Marlon Brando, and French poetry
You're wonderfully generous; you're kind to strangers, and children; and when you stand in the snow, you look like an angel
How are you doing this
told you
wake up every day right here, right in Punxsutawney, and it's always February second and  can't turn it off
If you still don't bel iev e me, listen-- u t , Phil-- -89- Listen
In ten seconds Larry is going to walk through that door and take you away from me
Larry
But you can't let him
Please believe me
You've got to believe me
don't -- Larry pokes his head in the doorway, looks around and spots Rita
Look
As Rita turns around to see Larry, Phil grabs a pen and pad from a passing waitress and quickly writes something down as Larry makes his way to their table
Phil finishes writing
(to Rita) You ready
We better get going if we're going to stay ahead of the weather
Phil hands the paper to Rita
She reads it
() "
stay ahead of the weather
" Larry looks at the paper
What ' s that
Rita looks at Phil with new understanding and empathy
: - Phil and Rita are walking down the sidewalk
Afer  got over the shock, it was kind of fun for the first year or two
had anything  wanted
Except you, of course
-90- Phil abruptly pulls Rita aside
big pile of snow slides off a roof and onto the sidewalk where they would have walked
Phil doesn't even look up
Rita looks, as if she's seeing a miracle
How did this start
don't know
just woke up
Just like always
- approaches
Hey, Phil
Phil Connors 1 Rita, this is Ned Ryerson
He's an asshole
He remembers me
Phil and Rita keep walking
Rita looks back at Ned, perplexed Trust me on that one
: - Phil and Rita come out of the shop, sharing pieces of fudge
This is great
No, it isn't
You hate fudge
Just how well do we know each other
told you
know everybody
Rita stops walking
Did we ever
you know
() Did we ever
You were an animal
-91- Come on
You're European trained, aren't you
Phil continues walking
() Phil
It's not funny
She catches up to him
Phil turns to her
You weren't interested
() Okay
She begins walking again
Not that it would've been so awful
understand
just had to know whether to smack you or not
You did
Good
: - Phil and Rita are sitting on a park bench
So do you believe any of this
don't know
don't know how else you could know so much
Maybe it is really happening
-92- used to try to stay up all night sometimes
thought if could stay conscious  could figure out what was going on, or at least hang onto something from the day before
But  gave up on that a long time ago
Rita looks at him with compassion
It sounds so-- lonely
(trying to shrug it ) It's not that bad
You get used to it
Rita comes to a decision
Maybe  should spend the rest of the day with you-- as an objective witness
Just to see what happens
Okay
Yeah, sure
That'd be okay
: '  - hat is lying on Phil's bed
playing card flies past second playing card sails right into the hat
Another playing card sails past, missing
Another playing card sails right in Phil and Rita are tossing cards
Rita is missing
Phil is hitting
It's not in the wrist so much as the fingers
Be the hat
It would take me a year to get good at this
Uh-uh
Six months
Four, five hours a day
Is this what you do with eternity
-93- Now you know
It's like waiting for a bus that never comes
You should see me play pool -- and bowling, juggling, hacky sack
can ride a unicycle
There ' s a knock on the door
'll get it
Phil jumps for the door and opens it
The   is there
Hi, Marty
$11
75 including the delivery charge, right
h hh h -- Phil pays him, takes the pizza and closes the door
(opening the pizza box) Pepperoni and olives
My favorite
Of course
told you,  know everything
(taking a bite of ) don ' t think  ' d want to know everything that ' s going to happen
like to be surprised
That's not the worst part
What's the worst part
The worst part is starting over everyday
Tomorrow you won't remember any of this
You'll go back to treating me like a complete jerk -- No -- It's not your fault
am a jerk
-94- No, you're not
Okay,  ' m not
It really doesn't make a lot of difference
've killed myself so many times, don't even exist anymore
'm just completely empty
Or completely clean
If you're going to be this positive all the time  may have to rough you up a little
Wait
Have we done this before
Which part
You getting me up here, the card gam e, the pizza-- No, this is the first time
() Well
Well, what
Well how does it feel to be doing something completely new
Phil looks at her with tremendous affection and gratitude
Good
Really good
He takes a slice of pizza and starts eating with gusto
: - There's only one slice left
Phil and Rita are sitting together on the bed, close but not touching
Soft music is playing on the radio
-95- Sometimes  wish  had a thousand lifetimes
One to be a great journalist
One to,  don't know, go back to school, study art, or auto mechanics
One just to take care of all the busywork, you know, pay the bills, get my car tuned up
One to be the wild woman of Borneo
One to be Mother Theresa
Maybe it's not a curse, Phil
It all just depends on how you look at it
Phil stares at her for a long time letting this sink in
Then he belches really loud
Rita stares at him, then burps surprisingly loud herself
want you to know, it's been a really nice day for me
Me, too
Maybe, if it's not too boring for you, we could do it again
hope so
The clock reads 11:59
Rita grabs Phil's hand
He puts his arm around her
They look into each others' eyes
Rita gives Phil a reassuring smile
She squeezes his hand
Their eyes turn to the clock
11:;59 turns to 12:00
Rita looks up at Phil as if expecting some magical event
You're still here
know
thought you were supposed to disappear-- or  was or something
Not 'til six
You rat
-96- She is mad in a playful way
never said midnight-- You knew  was waiting for midnight
But  never said it
Oh,  can't believe you
(she slugs him with a ) didn't know this was going to take all night
Does that mean you're going
No
Phil takes Rita's hand
She doesn't resist
: Rita is now sitting right next to Phil on the bed, her head resting on his shoulder
She nods off then catches herself
'm sorry
It's okay to go to sleep you know
promise  won't touch you-- much
No, it's all right
'm not tired
What were you saying
Her eyes start to close again
was saying that the cow was eventually returned to it's rightful owner
(drifting off) Really
-97- That's right
He looks at her, sees she's truly asleep, and gently maneuvers her into a comfortable reclining position on the bed
Then he carefully puts a pillow under her head and settles down next to her
What  was going to say was, think you're the kindest, sweetest, prettiest, most wonderful girl  ever met in my life
She starts to stir but he gently kisses her back to sleep
Shhhh
That's good
(satisfied she's still ) could never tell you this, but from the first minute  looked at you  wanted to just hold you close and be with you forever
iEverytime  -saw you around the station,  thought my heart was going to explode
used to dream about us being together
In my dream you loved me as much as  loved you and we didn't have to say anything but  knew you understood everything
She stirs again but he kisses her until she returns to deep sleep
know a guy like me could never deserve to have someone like you, but if  did,  swear  would love you for the rest of my life
Rita opens her eyes
(-) Did you say something
Good-night, Rita
He kisses her gently on the forehead
Good-night, Phil
-98- - The time changes from 5:59 to 6:00
The radio starts playing
Phil wakes up alone in bed
He lies there for a moment then leaps out of bed like a man reborn and heads straight for the shower
: '  - Rita and Larry are in the packed press area, beginning to set up the equipment
Phil arrives, carrying two cups of coffee
Rita
She looks at him without a trace of the rapport they shared the night before
Oh, hi, Phil
Thought you might like some-- He hands her the coffee
Thanks
Careful, it's hot
Larry
He hands Larry a cup
(surprised, mutters) Yeah, great
We're just setting up
You know,  bumped into Buster Greene, he kind of runs this thing, and he tipped me off that we might get a better shot over there
Really
-99- mean, maybe we should go for it
What do you think
Sounds good to me
Larry
Sure, why not
All right
Thanks, Phil
Good work
She reaches for an equipment case
'll get that
Phil helps Larry carry the camera gear
(to Larry) You and  never talk, Larry
You got kids
Larry looks suspicious
Rita looks on, reevaluating Phil
: - Phil enters the library, approaches the Librarian
Where would  find the Philosophy section
Down and to the left, 600's
Phil walks through the stacks, past the groundhog window
: - Phil rings the doorbell
kindly young woman, , answers Yes
' d like a piano lesson, please
-100- Oh
Okay,  ' m with a student now, but -- 'll give you a thousand dollars
Mary hesitates only a moment, then ushers Phil into the house and closes the door
moment later the door opens and a   with an armloa of music books exits as if pushed
The door closes behind her
: - Phil walks happily down the hallway
He passes the chubby man
Morning
Buon Giorno, signore
/ '
' Think it ' 11 be an early Spring
"Winter slumbering in the open air wears on his smiling face a dream of Spring
" Oh
: '  - Phil and Mary are sitting together at the piano
Phil is playing, poorly
Not bad, Mr
Connors
You say this is your first lesson
Technically, yes
Phil plays on, definitely improving
: -101- - We see several cuts of Phil studying at the library
over these cuts is a calendar with the pages flipping by
They all read "February 2
" : '  - Phil stands in front of the camera, giving his report
In fact, the groundhog's legendary ability to predict the weather may be more than just the German folklore of the region
Higher temperatures trigger hormonal changes in the testosterone levels of male groundhogs, which may in fact wake them from hibernation and send them out to battle with other males ;for mating rights
So, the truth is they're not looking for their shadows, they're looking for groundhog chicks
Rita looks on, clearly delighted with the report
: '  - Phil is playing the piano with ever increasing skill as more February 2 calendar pages flip by
: '  - Phil is delivering another report
-102- Groundhog Day, February second, also known as Candlemas Day or the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin Mary, the day Mary first came to the temple for ritual blessings following the birth of the infant Jesus, and celebrated since the Middle Ages by the sacramental lighting of candles
Hence the old Scottish couplet which long predates the American groundhog tradition: "If Candlemas dawns bright and clear, there'll be two winters in the year
" Larry whispers an aside to Rita
Is he making this stuff up
() Shhhhh
: - Beyond the graveyard is a work shed with various tombstones scattered about
Old , the town stonecarver, is at work chiseling a name into a gravemarker
Behind him, Phil is chipping away at a small hunk of marble, sculpting a very lovely cherub
Rita sits on a stool eating an apple and sipping hot tea watching him with amazed interest
But what if the rules changed
What if none of your actions had consequences
There would still be an absolute morality
There has to be an absolute good, regardless of the circumstances
Oh, is that so, Miss Plato
Then let me ask you this
Where does this "absolute good" come from
From the sky
-103- Rita shrugs
don't know
From my freshman Philosophy course,  guess
They both laugh
Then she looks at him for a long moment and grins
What
Nothing
just can't believe you're such a fine sculptor
Phil takes a bite of her apple and gets up
gotta go
Where do you have to go in Punxsutawney
got piano and then drums
Here
Come on, 'll drop you off
They exit
: '- Phil drops Rita off and watches as she crosses the street to Larry who is waiting on the other side
Across the street, Rita takes a wistful glance toward Phil, then gets in the news van and drives off
Phil gets out of the car and starts walking, but finds himself face to face with Ned Ryerson
Phil
Phil Connors
thought that was you
Ned
Ned Ryerson
don't believe it
've missed you so much
-104- Phil gives Ned a big hug and keeps holding on for an uncomfortably long time, actually giving Ned a hickey on the neck
Ned goes into homophobic shock
Uh,  gotta get going
Nice to see you, Phil
He hurries off
: '  - Phil is sitting on the piano bench with Mary, playing pretty well
Mary is astonished
How long have you been studying, Mr
Connors
One day
'm gifted
: - Phil is walking down the street
He glances down the alley as he passes, stops, walks back and enters the alley
The that Phil never noticed before is lying there, huddled against a wall
Phil goes to help him
Hey, mister
Hey
Come on, let's get you somewhere warm
The old bum turns to look at Phil, then closes his eyes
(helps the old man to his feet) There you go
Phil practically carries him out of the alley
: - nurse approaches Phil
You the one brought in the old man
-105- How is he
He passed away just now
Phil pauses for a long moment
What'd he die of
() He was just old
It was his time
want to see his chart
Excuse me
Phil brushes past her and makes for the big double doors leading to triage
Sir, you can't -- (hurrying after him) Look
Some people just die
Not on my watch
: - Phil is propping up the old man at a table, trying to feed him hot soup
: - Phil is furiously looking over -rays, flipping through medical journals and making notes
: - Phil is in the alley, shaking the old man, trying to rouse him
Come on
Hang on
Hang on , there
Breathe
-106- Phil stops
The body lies, unmoving
Phil sits back, breathing heavily
: '  - Phil is delivering his report
Everyone there is silent and listening to Phil
Even the other reporters have turned their cameras on him
When Chekhov saw the long winter, it was a winter bleak and dark and bereft of hope; and yet, we know winter's only one more step in the cycle
And standing among the people of Punxsutawney -- (Phil looks directly at ) -- basking in the warmth of their hearths and hearts,  couldn't imagine a better fate than a long and lustrous winter
Phil smiles
Rita smiles, too
For Channel 9 news,  ' m Phil Connors
There is much applause
Even Larry brushes away a tear
Phil hands the microphone to Rita
-- Sorry
'm gonna be late
Phil rushes off
Late for what
Phil
(To Larry) Could you break it down and wrap out of here by yourself, Larry
Sure
Thanks
-107- Rita rushes off after Phil
: - Phil walks briskly toward an intersection, glancing nervously at his watch
Rita follows him at a distance, hurrying to keep up
, a little nine-year-old girl, approaches the intersection shielding her brand new puppy under her winter coat
She isn't paying attention to traffic and fails to notice a big truck bearing down on her
As she steps off the curb, Phil arrives and, with split-second timing, nonchalantly but firmly grabs her coat to hold her back, just as the big truck rushes past in the street, narrowly missing her
Hey
Did you forget to look both ways
You didn't even look one way
My doggie was cold
Yeah, well, my doggies are freezing, but  ' m still gonna watch out for cars
See you around, kid
Phil looks at his watch and rushes off
Rita looks on amazed and follows him at a distance
: - Phil enters the crowded restaurant and pushes past all the people waiting to be seated
He walks casually but quickly and purposefully around the tables, squeezing past busy waitresses and seated patrons toward a commotion in the back of the restaurant
are leaning over a
Oh, my God
He's having a heart attack
Lay him down
-108- What do  do
He's not BREATHING1 He's turning blue
Help
Phil walks straight up to the - , grabs him from behind, gets him in the Heimlich grip and squeezes sharply
bolus of food flies across the room
The victim coughs and sputters, then starts breathing again
Jerry, you okay
think that did it
Phil lets go of the grateful victim
If you're going to eat steak, get better teeth, will you
Enjoy the rest of your lunch, gents
He exits
Wow
Who was that guy
Phil gets to the door and finds Rita standing there, looking at him in awe
Rita
() -Okay, hold it right there want to know what' s going on and want to know right now
'm sorry, 'm really pressed right now
Meet me outside the hospital about 5:00 and we'll talk about it
The hospital
Phil looks at his watch and rushes away
Try the curlycue fries
Killer
: -109- - gurney bursts through the double doors, paramedics and nurses in attendance
The patient is a teenage girl, , totally unconscious
- The gurney is wheeled into the surgery
Looks like insulin shock
She's probably diabetic
Phil enters wearing a doctor's scrub suit and begins barking orders
She's not diabetic
It's an overdose
Let's get her up here and pump her stomach, then  want a complete blood work-up,
i g h t , Doctor--uh-- She realizes she's never seen him before
Call me Phil
Phil
Like the groundhog
Exactly
: '  - Sick  in hospital gowns are gathered around Phil, laughing and squealing
Phil is
making balloon animals
Make a giraffe
giraffe
Let's see
It's just like a dog with a biiiiig-- what was it
Neck
-110- big tail
Okay, a big tail
Neck
big neck
Phil makes an animal really quickly
Rita watches from the doorway, unseen by Phil
There
dog with long legs
Nooo
Long neck
Oh
Right
dog with a big head
Noooo
The kids attack Phil
Lots of rolling around on the bed
Rita watches, completely enthralled
Finally, Phil extricates himself and exits to find Rita waiting
All right, now what's going on
(taking her arm) Come on
We have to hurry
: - Phil rushes down the sidewalk with Rita close behind him
He stops under a tree and puts his arms out just as a falls out of the tree and into his arms, knocking him to the ground
The kid runs off unhurt as Phil gets back to his feet and brushes himself off
(to Rita) That little bastard has never thanked me once
ought to j ust let him fall
Teach him a lesson
Phil, this is too --  must be dreaming
-1 1- Yeah, you and me both
Come on, We're almost done
: - Phil kneels on the cold ground beside the old bum who lies huddled against the wall, immobile
Rita is standing by at the end of the alley, watching as Phil examines him
Phil writes something down on a small pad
He finishes, and sets it down by the old man
Then he takes his coat and uses it to cover the man up
siren is heard
Phil stands and walks away, as an ambulance pulls into the alley
Is he --
' Yeah
Let's go
In a minute
She waits and watches
The paramedics,  and , get out of the ambulance and inspect the scene
It's ol1 Really
That's a shame
Look here
Bud picks up the note Phil left
Rita steps closer
May  see that
(reading aloud) "Every night, by cold bricks watch the shadow rising from this old man in the snow
At 8:02 we let it go
" -112- () "At 8:02 we let it go
" Wow, that's nice
Rita hands him the note and quickly walks away
Suppose he wrote it
() Are you kidding
: - Rita catches up with Phil outside the Pennsylvanian, the town's oldest and best hotel
Now what
Come on
You'll see
They enter
: - As Phil and Rita enter there is music coming from a side room
The black velvet announcement board proclaims: - : - Phil and Rita walk into a banquet room decorated with streamers, balloons and flowers
There is a long buffet table and a punch bowl
Another long table is loaded with wedding gifts
small band is playing
People are dancing
The wedding party is dressed in rented tuxedos and appropriately pouffy bridesmaid dresses
This is incredible
Who's wedding is this
-113- Phil grabs two glasses of champagne and hands one to Rita
Just some friends
Dorisi The bride, , young and cheery, is on her way to see Phil
She is dragging , her groom, with her
Hi, Mr
Connors
Come , Freddy
Hi
This is the guy  told you about
No way
How's it going, Fred
Hey,  ' d like to thank you for making Doris go through with this
Are you kidding
Don't buy that playing hard to get stuff
She's crazy about you, you stud
' m really glad you could come
Congratulations
Phil reaches into his pocket, pulls out two tickets and hands them to Doris
What is this
Oh, no way
No way
Ahhh
Doris throws herself on Fred and jumps up and down
Fred grabs the tickets
Wrestlemania
No way
No way
Doris throws herself on Phil
How did you know
-114- We're like going to be in Pittsburgh anyway
don't know
just thought about you two, tried to picture what you ' d want more than anything in the world and it came to me
Bing
Wrestlemania
Thanks, Mr
Connors
You're a real pal
This is the best
Doris gives Phil a kiss
She and Fred move on
don ' t understand
You rush from one person to the next in a town you only visit once a year, you know everything before it happens , and you -- -  don ' t know , you seem to be Punxsutawney ' s leading citizen
The band finishes a set
The guests stop dancing and head for the refreshments
Phil and Rita are left alone for the moment What do you want to know
Who are you
really don't know
No, there's something going on with you
Okay,  wake up in Punxsutawney on February second -- every day
It's supernatural
don't even try to explain it anymore
So, live each day as if it's the only day 've got
Rita stares into his eyes for a very long time, but sees only good, true things
That's pretty amazing
" -115- You want to know what's really amazing
've been waiting for you every day for ten thousand years
dream of you every night of my life
You've been my constant weapon against total despair, and just knowing you exist has kept me alive
How's that
Rita can't even speak
This is clearly the nicest thing anybody has ever said to anybody
Mary the piano teacher notices Phil
Phil
(to her friend) This is the guy
Hello, Mary
Rita, this is one of Punxsey's finest musicians
Give me a break
You should talk
Why don't you play something
o , -- Please
Hey, Mr
Connors
Go for it
Phil looks at Rita
She nods and shrugs
Phil walks up to the platform and sits at the piano
He begins to play a slow, serious, classical piece
Everyone falls silent
It's so beautiful, Rita is almost in tears
Then, after a pause to let the serious notes sink in, Phil transforms the piece into a fast, lively, upbeat jazz romp
Everyone is delighted, and as the rest of the band kicks in, everyone grabs a partner and begins to dance
An old coot,  , grabs Rita and the two of them dance up a storm
That's a great guy you've got there
Doctor Connors fixed my back, you know
- -116- Do ctor Connors
Rit a looks over at Phil, joyously playing the piano
: - It is snowing lightly
Phil and Rita are walking slowly, arm in arm, close
They stop and embrace
Phil looks at Rita
She looks like an angel
Wait
Don't move
Phil scoops up some snow and begins packing it down, furiously, joyously, then rolling it into a large ball
Making a snow man
'll help
No, stay there
Stand right th ere
Ph il lifts the now larger chunk of packed snow and sets it on a mailbox
Then he looks at her, and starts to sculpt it
: Phil is using a stick and the heat of his bare hands to model a delicate fold in the snow sculpture
Several bystanders look o n with interest as Phil stands back from his work
Can  look
kay, look
It is an excellent likeness of Rita, the snow white as alabaster, pure as marble, a beautiful and delicate homage
() Nobody's ever done this for me
Not even a drawing
It's beautiful
-117- This is how  see you
When it all gets too much,  just close my eyes and there you are-- just like this
Take it home and keep it in the freezer
Rita embraces Phil
They are about to kiss, looking deep into each others eyes
This one's for the Frog Prince
What
Nothing
They kiss-- a long, deep, soul-stirring kiss
Will you come with me
Rita nods
They continue standing there, embracing, warming each other in the cold night air
(looks back at the ice ) We're just going to leave her
It doesn't matter
Really, it doesn't
They kiss again
: - The digital clock-radio changes from 5:59 to 6:00
Silence
No Sonny and Cher, no deejays-- nothing
Phil sits up in bed
He looks around the room
Things are different, messier
Then he sees the covers move
Wide-eyed now, he looks over and sees Rita waking up, snuggling deep under the covers
() It's not true
It's not
It can't be true
Rita
Rita
-118- ( ) Mmmm
Morning
Phil pounces on Rita, showering her with kisses
You're here
My god
can't believe you're here
Glad to see you, too
No
It's happened
Don't you get it
It's tomorrow
It's -- Phil turns on the radio
still shoveling put the highways, but if you're walking, it's a beautiful day
Yeah, the snow kind of cleaned e ve r yt h in g up-- --except your mouth
Phil kisses the radio
love those guys
Are you always this jolly in the morning
Phil runs to the window and looks out
- The street ;is virtually empty, the town just waking up
Kids are throwing snowballs
No groundhog
Rita
They're all gone
You must've had some dream
Phil stops, thinks
-1 1 9 - Did  just dream it
Phil opens the door and runs into the hallway wearing only pajama bottoms
Phi l
Phil
Rita sits up in bed and waits
Suddenly, from somewhere else in the inn comes the sound of Phil at the piano expertly playing a difficult classical piece
He stops after a few bars
(
) Yeah
Phil runs back into the room
It really happened
You're really here
He pounces on Rita again
You're really actually here
() 'm here, 'm here
They kiss, passionately, hungrily
Let's go
He scoops her up in his arms
Where're we going
Anywhere
Everywhere
: - Phil and Rita, dressed now, enter and encounter Mrs
Lancaster Phil hugs her
Oh, my
-120- Florence
Say hello to Rita
She loves me
'm not surprised
He kisses her on the cheek and rushes out with Rita
- Phil and Rita walk down Main Street hand in hand
Phil
Good morning
Mr
Connors
wanted to thank you
That's all right
-- steps out of the flower shop with a bouquet
Phil, here
want you to have these
Thanks, Carl
Phil smells the flowers, and hands the bouquet to Rita
(
) And so began my final lifetime, and ended the longest winter on record
would find myself no longer able to affect the chain of events in this town, but  did learn something about time
You can waste time, you can kill time, you can do time, but if you use it wisely, there's never enough of it
So you'd better make the most of the time you've got
car skids on the ice and smashes into a tree
Phil and Rita rush over to help, but the driver waves that he's okay
Rita and Phil continue their walk
-121- (
) Larry never got through the blizzard, so none of my groundhog reports ever made it on the air
But Rita and -- we lived happily ever after
Phil and Rita walk off together
Across the street, Larry is trying to get rid of Ned Ryerson who is doggedly trying to sell him insurance
But Phil told me you were his accountant
Look,  told you
He's nuts
Larry keeps trying to walk away, but Ned won't leave him alone
Let me just tell you about single premium life-- Finally, Larry slugs Ned and storms off, leaving Ned floundering in a snowbank
Phil and Rita walk on as we pull up and away from Main Street revealing the whole of Punxsutawney and the snowy countryside that embraces it
