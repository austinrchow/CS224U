Well, it's been another great year here at

Sandy, thank you

The other teachers laugh

) Wally, can  just say one quick thing
Wally turns to  , late 20s, cute and wholesome
Any trace of sexuality she might have is wiped away by her adult pigtails
She treats students and adults alike -- like students
Just wanted to remind everyone the school day's not over
So let's keep the drinking under control, hmm
That's it
Back to you, Wally

Thanks, Amy, (then, back to his notes) Or the wild success of the book drive for the women's prison sponsored by Ms

(') But now as the summer is upon us, it's time to not only say goodbye to another school year, but to also say goodbye to a member of our faculty
() Elizabeth, can you come up here
, mid 20s, pretty and petite, walks up to the front
She sports an enormous diamond ring and dresses slightly more cosmopolitan than the other teachers
(') You've only been with us for one short year, but know that you'll always be a part of the  family
Elizabeth gives Principal Snur an appreciative smile
The Teachers lightly applaud
(') And we got you a little something
Wally hands Elizabeth an envelope
She opens it and
pulls out a gift card:
$37
Almost forty dollars
Thank you
Why don't you say a couple words
Okay
Um
'm not really good at this type of thing so 'll make it quick know 've only been here a year, but there's so much 'm going to miss

She's tossing the few personal effects she has into a banker's box

'm not saying they were little angels, butthey were all there to learn and that'sthe greatest gift a student can give a teacher
Elizabeth's class is horsing around, enjoying the last days of seventh grade

He hands it to Elizabeth, who considers what to write for a beat, then smiles as she signs it

) And  wish that  had gotten to know all of you better, but between four classes and planning a wedding,  had my hands full
From the little  do know about you,  know that our students are in good hands
Elizabeth passes Amy's classroom, where she is carefully removing inspirational posters from her walls and rolling them into cardboard tubes
- Three middle school  are smoking weed in a thicket on the outskirts of the school property
(

) And  can't believe it's all over
This year flew by
And even though 'll never teach again professionally, 've realized that  don't need a blackboard and classroom to set an example
Elizabeth comes up behind them
(') Hand it over
The Burnouts' eyes all go wide and they freeze
One of the burnouts hands her the joint
(') Everything
The kids look at each other and then pull out a bag with a couple of joints
They hand it over to Elizabeth
(') This was a warning
Next time,  don't call the principal
call the cops
-    - Elizabeth walks to her brand new
She gets in, pulls out a joint and lights it
She takes a huge , and then  out of the lot
She tosses her banker's box out the window and extends her hand, giving the school
(
) Woo-hoo
couple students look at her strangely
The dim-looking kid that had Elizabeth sign his yearbook
He flips to the faculty section, and by the picture of Elizabeth is her message: "

Illit

Elizabeth's car comes barrelling toward him and nearly hits him
She accelerates into the speed bumps, almost hitting the from the opening shot, who's changing the plastic letters to read, "
" Slow down
: Mercedes with the vanity plate "" is parked in the driveway of an upscale neighborhood
Elizabeth's matching Mercedes pulls into the adjacent spot
Her license plate reads "

Top of the line electronics
Lots of black leather furniture
Tacky, but expensive
Elizabeth pours two glasses of wine and takes a long sip
() Baby Doll
(
) Coming
, early 30s, exits the bedroom in his underwear
He's shaved his head to avoid signs of early balding and is also a full four inches shorter than Elizabeth
Thankfully for him, he has money
(') () Hey
That was a quick party
Elizabeth kisses Mark on the top of his head and hands him a glass
Yeah
You should have seen it
What a joke
She raises her glass for a toast
He raises his
(') Here's to me never having to work again
And  owe it all to you, Lover
Elizabeth takes a big sip
(') () So  made a reservation at Ruth's Chris, and then  booked us a suite at the Drake, and  thought we could finish the night in "anal alley
" Hmm
Something drops in the bedroom
Mark, alarmed, turns towards the door
Elizabeth brushes past him into -- -  - Elizabeth enters to find --
Mark follows her in
Elizabeth looks around -- under the bed, in the closet, behind the door
See
Nothing
Just then, the wooden chest at the foot of the bed
Elizabeth opens the latch to find , 23, dressed only in a thong, scrunched in the fetal position
She stands, revealing   , and steps out of the chest
( ) Motherfucker
How could you do this to me
'm sorry
You are buying me the biggest pair of yellow diamond earrings they make
'm talking serious blood diamonds
Sheila  again
Bless you
( ) Get out of my house, bitch
Don't talk to her like that
Excuse me
love her
Mark puts his arm around Sheila
Elizabeth eyes Sheila's large breasts
You love her
She's a hooker
She's not a hooker
dance
Elizabeth takes a deep breath
(') () Listen, Marky, you made a mistake
You're human
'm human
And this time it was you
Maybe six months from now, you'll walk in on me
don't know, but probably
Sheila  again
(') Shut the fuck up
(then, to Mark, sweet) And
maybe 'm talking crazy, but  don't want to throw away our life together over something like this
We're getting married
'm willing to fight for us
'm not
And you know why
Because Sheila loves me -- and not just for my money
Sheila squeezes his shoulder
'm sorry if  care that my future husband can support me
We didn't all grow up with a silver spoon in our mouths
You can't even imagine what it's like going to bed hungry, night after night
What are you talking about
Both your parents are CPAs
My parents worked their asses off to send me to private school
Do you know what it's like driving a Pontiac when everyone else gets a Beemer the second they menstruate
That shit stays with you
It's over, Elizabeth
For the record, there's a shitload of things that  hate about you, but  still, would've gotten married
(beat, sweet) Because  love you
(rolls his eyes) 'm gonna need the ring back
She grabs her bag and heads for the exit
Mark follows
You sad little troll
hope you and your hooker enjoy chlamydia together
Elizabeth
The ring
(not turning around) 'm not even listening to you anymore
She starts to open the door
He closes it
The ring
Like  even want your gay-ass ring
She tries pulling it off
(') It's not coming off
'll go to the jeweler's tomorrow
Mark takes her hand and removes the ring with ease
Elizabeth steps out into the night
The door behind her
: 3 -    - red 1994 Grand Am with a cracked windshield peels into the half-empty lot and screeches to a halt
The license plate reads "

-  - Elizabeth walks down the empty hall
It's possible a person has never looked less happy to be anywhere
plays from an open door
Something from inside the classroom catches Elizabeth's eye
(under her breath) You've gotta be shitting me
' The room has been decorated to within an inch of its life
Every surface is covered with posters like "Noted African-Americans," or "Hispanic American Hall of Fame," or "Women Who Dared
"     has been placed on each student's desk
Amy, dressed casually in cargo shorts and texas, is trying to hang a large "" poster
She looks over, sees Elizabeth staring at her, and immediately lights up
Elizabeth Halsey, as  live and breathe
Amy Squirrel
know we barely got a chance to get to know one another last year -- what with you planning the wedding of the century and me juggling all my extra-currics -- but  just want to say that 'm super excited to be across-the-hall-mates
Okay
And  know you kinda skated by last year, doing the bare minimum thing -- you were kind of a lone wolf -- but now you're back and  just know that you are going to rededicate yourself to the task at -- Amy notices Elizabeth's bare hands
(') Where's your beautiful ring
My fiance and  broke it off
found him in bed with someone else
Oh my gosh
It was another man
() Shut the front door
(motioning for a hug) Somebody needs a hug
Somebody doesn't
Hm
Another time then
Elizabeth takes an apple from a desk
( ) These washed
Of course
'd never serve a student unwashed fruit
Elizabeth takes a huge bite out of the apple
() thought the teachers got the apples
Well,  think the students teach me at least as'much as  teach them
Stupid
Elizabeth tosses the mostly uneaten apple into the trash and exits
It hits the rim and lands on the floor
Okey-dokey
'  - It's like an asylum -- nothing on the walls
Elizabeth reads from a stack of  Weekly's and circles pictures of , late 30s, the kind of woman who spends a lot of time on her internet dating profiles, but rarely gets emailed, pokes her head in
Oh sorry, am  interrupting
Um -- kinda
Do you want to grab some lunch
'm in the middle of something, Lynn
My treat
Fine
- Elizabeth and Lynn sit at an outdoor table
Lynn picks at a garden salad
Elizabeth is eating a bucket of chicken and drinking a large drink
She pulls a bottle of cough syrup from her purse and dumps it into her drink
You have that thing going around, huh
Are you excited for tomorrow
Is tomorrow Saturday
No, it's the first day of school
Wait,  thought  had a week to get my class together
Yeah, that was last week
(under her breath) Fuck my ass
If you hate teaching so much, why don't you just get another job
And do what
Sell perfume at the mall
Work at a day care center
(slurps her big gulp) You know, when  first got into teaching, thought  was doing it for all the right reasons: short hours, summers off, no accountability
love my summers
Fresh corn
Mmm
From now on, my full-time job will be finding a guy who will take care of me -- Oh god,  pray for that -- And that makes a shit ton of money and doesn't ask too many questions
(licking her fingers) spent most of my summer hanging out at the bars near where the Bulls practice
Had some fun, got some cool souvenirs that Ebayed, but those guys aren't looking to settle down
And they all wear condoms
And then they take the condoms with them
That's how paranoid they are that a girl will try and get pregnant
Like it's so easy to get pregnant from a guy nutting into a condom
You're gonna find someone great
've been thinking about it a lot
mean, figure 'm like an 8, 8
5
But once get my new tits, 'll probably be a -- 13
You don't want to do that
You're already so pretty
know 'm hot, Lynn, but  don't stand a chance against all those Barbies dolls out there
Anna Nicole had it right, may she rest in peace
Lynn checks her watch
We should finish up
Wally's doing that big orientation for teachers in the auditorium
Yeah, 'm not going to that
But it's mandatory
("'m so scared") Ooohhh
Yeah,  probably won't go either don't know  might
'll probably go, but just sit in the back
Maybe leave early
Maybe stay till the end
Play it by ear
Or just stay till the end
Lynn takes both their, trays and dumps them
(') This was fun
Yeah, it was alright
When you said you were taking me to lunch,  kinda thought it was going to be nicer, but this was okay
Sorry
It's okay
You can get me next time
'  - Not much character, not many furnishings
Elizabeth is online looking at a
She stares at the  and compares breasts to the ones in Weekly
She reaches for a bong and pulls a huge hit
The front door opens and her roommate, , early 30s, boarish and carrying a tattered backpack and a Big Gulp, walks quickly past Elizabeth
Hey, Kirk, what do you think about me with Jessica Simpson's tits
He stares at her chest intently
She's not bothered by it
Go bigger
Kirk enters his bedroom and slams the door
Cool, yeah
She glances at the clock: 3:14
(') (under her breath) Fuck my ass
'  -  - Elizabeth is asleep
After a beat, the  goes off
She checks the clock: 5

She groans
-  - First day of school excitement
The bell , and like rats, the  scurry to their various classes
Before long, the hallway is empty
'  - In one corner, , clearly at the top of the seventh grade food chain, shows off a photo spread of herself modelling in a "Western-Style" clothing catalogue
, 12, wearing grey, stained sweatpants and a grey sweatshirt with block letters that read "," stares longingly at Chase from a few desks away
15
The photographer was, like, sooo nice
He made me feel sooo comfortable
() might get flown to Kansas City for their fashion week
() Oh my
Chase and her friends turn to face Garrett, who's as surprised as they are that he spoke
Stalk much
Garrett quickly turns away
Chase rolls her eyes
An angry-looking kid, , wearing a , turns to Garrett
( ) Faggot
() Bless you
What'd you say to me
Elizabeth, with large bags under her eyes, enters the class
Tristan, on a dime, heads back to his seat
The class immediately quiets down
, 12, dressed like a paralegal, walks up to Elizabeth with a large Tupperware tray
Hi, 'm Sasha
It's a pleasure to meet you
(handing over tupperware) My mother baked these for you
(not looking up) Just leave them on the desk
Sasha, confused, gently puts them down and stands there
After a moment, Elizabeth looks up
(') You need something
16
- Sasha shakes her head and retreats to her desk at the front of the class
(') Anyone here seen "Stand and Deliver
" Show of hands
(off their blank stares) No one
Edward James Olmos
Wow
Elizabeth takes a  from her bag
She points to two in the front of the class
(') You and you, go grab the  and roll it up front
(pointing to Sasha) And you, go shut off the lights
The two kids,  and , roll the  over
Sasha shuts off the
We're watching a movie on the first day
( ) think it's awesome
You rock
agree with Chase
Elizabeth pops in the
"Stand and Deliver," starring Edward James Olmos as a tough-as-nails calculus teacher in an inner-city school begins
Elizabeth takes a bite of one of Sasha's cookies and immediately spits it out
Ugh
Oatmeal raisin
She pushes the Tupperware tray into the trash next to her desk
Sasha looks on, sadly
-  - Lunch is in full swing
Each clique has staked its own territory
Several , Elizabeth and Amy among them, are on lunch duty
, sitting alone, writing in a journal
Tristan, the bully, tosses a bowl of cole slaw at Garrett
Incoming
Direct hit
The cole slaw nails him in the shoulder
Garrett picks some of the cole slaw off his shirt and eats it
He continues writing
Amy races over to Tristan and writes him up
Elizabeth watches, bored, struggling to keep her eyes open
Amy heads over to Elizabeth
Somebody's got a case of the sleepies
Did you see what just happened
Yeah, that one kid hit the other kid with the cole slaw
You weren't at the orientation the other day, but we're doing something new this year
It's very exciting
We're splitting the cafeteria into quadrants
Elizabeth yawns
(') So, anyways, in order for the quadrant system to work, it's vital that each teacher maintain order within their quadrant
Because it's really tough for me as head lunch monitor -- or another teacher -- to leave their quadrant to discipline a kid in another quadrant know it's a lot to take in
'd be happy to sit with-you after school and explain all of the new guidelines
Tell you what
Why don't you send me a memo, and if  have any questions, 'll come to you
Okay, Elizabeth
Sounds like a plan, Stan
18
(') ( ) Oh,  meant to ask you
Did  hear that you were showing a movie this morning
How do  know what you heard
Fair enough
Listen,  don't want to tell you how to run your class, but maybe it might be fun to do some ice-breakers
Like "Telephone Charades" or "The String Game
" Or start doing practice questions for the state test
It's never too soon to start
Are we gonna have a problem, me and you
Oh, shishkebobs, no
If  gave you that impression,  am so sorry
Actually, was really hoping that we could be more than across-the-hall-mates
don't know what you've heard, but don't munch box
No, of course not
don't even know what that is
just meant friends
Like getting manicures and going shopping on Sundays
Shit like that
Yes
Yes
And helping each other out
Looking out for one another
That's cool
Tell you what, friend, 'm gonna get going
Cover for me
Elizabeth doesn't wait for an answer, walks off
() But you can't leave
Lunch doesn't end for another
(looks at clock) () 19
(') Seven minutes
Who's going to watch your quadrant
'  - Empty
Elizabeth looks around and spots the "" poster on the wall
She walks over and studies it
-  - Elizabeth walks down the hallway with the rolled up poster
She
passes a man, obviously lost, looking at a map
This is , 30
Handsome in a wholesome way
Elizabeth walks by as he looks up at her helplessly
She turns on her heels
Fresh fish
( ) Hi there
You look a little lost
Hi
Can you tell me where Room 124 is
'll do you one better
'll take you there
Oh, you don't have to do that
Will you stop
It'd be my pleasure
Thanks
feel like 've been walking around in circles for the last fifteen minutes

Welcome, welcome
They shake hands a beat too long
Elizabeth notices Scott's
(') Helluva watch
What's that -- a Jaeger- LeCoultre
Good eye
Thanks
love men's watches
It's kind of a hobby
It's a bummer knowing my watch could feed a village for
a year, but my grandfather designed it, so
Oh
Your grandfather designs watches
The family business
My mom's maiden name is Jaeger
Shut up
My parents had a minor meltdown when decided to join the Peace Corps and become a teacher
But they've been cool about it
Elizabeth smiles and they start walking down the hall
(') Integrity
(pointing to poster)
The poster
"Integrity

That's why  got it
They turn a corner
Garrett wheels his backpack past them
Hey, Ms
Halsey

She slaps him five
Scott notices, smiles
21
Man,  can't wait for the day that  have my own classroom
Yeah
So did you and your wife just move to town
'm not married
Me neither
was engaged until  walked in on my fiance cheating on me
With his brother
That's horrible
() Ooh, 124
This is me
Nice to meet you, Scott Delacourte
Hopefully, we'll be seeing a lot of each other

Great meeting you, Elizabeth Halsey

That's a great watch
() And how's that going
She's my rock
() Alright, thanks, Danni
Danni puts her bra and blouse back on and exits
(') So, Elizabeth, have you given any thought to size
was thinking, you know, maybe a
IJh huh, uh huh
,would say, though, with your frame, you might consider something smaller
large , maybe a cup
You'd be surprised how significant those would look
Hmm
Yeah,  think 'll go with the 's, really turn some heads
23
You know, Elizabeth, breast enhancement's not a cure-all
just want to make sure you have realistic expectations
Doctor,  lost my fiance to a woman with monster fake tits
So now  need monster fake tits so that  won't lose my next fiance
Those are my expectations
Is that realistic enough for you
Very good then
'  -   - Elizabeth leans over the counter and grabs a mint from a small bowl
Danni sits behind her desk wearing a headset
So you'll be off your feet for about two weeks
what works for you
Let's do December 19th
Start of winter break
The 19th it is
So the total is $9300 for the surgery plus one night stay at our facility
How would you like to pay
Elizabeth laughs
Danni laughs
That's absurd
What if  don't spend the night at your facility
The night's included in the price
Did you not read our literature
No
-  walks by
(') (flirtatious, to doctor) Hi
(then, back to Danni) Listen, 'm a teacher, not a drug dealer
24
We accept all major credit cards
My credit situation is complicated
'm sorry, but if you can't pay,  can't schedule the appointment
( ) You know, there are less expensive options
Have you looked into South America
'll be back
Elizabeth dramatically scoops a handful of mints from the bowl and storms out
'  - Elizabeth, her cell phone cradled to her ear, pulls a out of a freezer  with them
( ) Look,  just really need some money
It's, for a surgery  need
Elizabeth pokes holes in the Lean Cuisine with a knife and turns on the microwave
(') ( ) Yes, as a matter of fact, it is about my breasts, dad
() Sorry
Happy belated birthday
So, can you wire me some money or not
- Elizabeth walks up a driveway and looks around
(on phone, whispering) So  won't beat around the bush, Grammy
She pulls the kitchen knife from her bag and  the back tire of a late-model
25
(') (on phone, whispering) 'm dying and  need money for surgery
Really
Nothing
Don't you get social security or something
Elizabeth goes around to another tire
Slash

her computer screen
Her checking account balance: $45

(into phone, losing patience) Listen, limpdick, you owe me for breaking off the engagement
Do you know how embarrassing that was

It's just 10000 dollars and it would really mean the world to me
Lover
You there
Elizabeth hurls her phone at the wall
It smashes

Kirk pokes his head out of his bedroom
Did you call my name
No
said 'fucking troll

He turns and heads back in to his room
Hey, you got ten grand
Nope
Kirk closes his door
After a beat, he opens it

Like, a lot short
He closes his door

Dinner's ready
'  - Elizabeth and Lynn speak in hushed voices in the corner by a vending machine
Amy grades papers on a ratty- looking couch
She glances up at Elizabeth and Lynn
don't know
That's a lot of money
know
And  hate asking a friend for money -- especially as good a friend as you
This has its desired effect on Lynn
Maybe  could sell that jewelry my grandmother gave me
That turquoise crap
Blech
No one's buying that
(then, catching herself) But it looks great on you
Thanks
What about Mark
What type of person do you think  am
That assbag cheated on me
Did  ever tell you that he has a mole on the tip of his dick
'm just trying to better myself don't think that's asking for so much
Amy walks over
'Scuse,me
Just gonna scooch in here
She drops quarters into the vending machine, but doesn't bother selecting an item
This was clearly her "in
" She turns to Elizabeth and Lynn
(') Sooo
know it's none of my business, but  couldn't help but overhear your conversation and  just want to say, that you shouldn't change a thing
You should be happy with the way you are
That's true
Huh
Well, do you think mental retards should be happy with the way they are
Amy stammers
(') Lynn, you teach them
What do you think
() 've never asked them
would never -- We don't all have your tits, Squirrel
So maybe you should think before you interrupt a private conversation
guess that's what you get for trying to help
Amy pushes the coin release on the vending machine and takes back her change without getting a drink
Amy heads back to the couch
That's right
Walk away
(then, noticing)- There he is
Scott enters
All of the female teachers light up
There he is
Well, look what the cat dragged in
wish it was under better circumstances
Stu Riley's car was vandalized last night
Right in his driveway
Gang members, probably

Quite a film, huh
Chase gives him a weird look and then exits with her friends
Sasha lingers by Elizabeth's desk

(without looking up) What
'm a student leader for the
trip -- Shocker
And we're having our car wash this weekend
If you're around, maybe we could wash your car
've got some Mexicans who already do it for nothing
It's for a good cause
This year, we're trying to get some extra money so that we can go on a Duck Tour
She hands Elizabeth a flyer
Elizabeth glances at it
(') () Last year's seventh grade raised $6000
( ) $6000
-   - Elizabeth walks past the   toward the Principal's office
You can't go in there
He's with a student
Elizabeth ignores her, adjusts her blouse, and enters

Figurines, a picture of Principal Snur kissing a dolphin
Dolphin calendars
This guy loves dolphins
Principal Snur sits next to , a small pale kid

If you don't like to get wet, Arkady, you could try using deodorant, anti-
perspirant, maybe some cologne
know a lot of the older boys are wearing the body spray
( ) Bodish spray
Elizabeth enters and immediately recoils from the smell
Blugh
Arkady and Principal Snur both look up
He holds up his finger -- "one minute
" Elizabeth notices his cheap dolphin watch
So why don't you think about that and 'll let your teachers know that you're working on it
Arkady nods and quickly exits
Sorry,  didn't realize you were in with anyone
We were just finishing up
Elizabeth, actually meant to talk to you
Did hear that you were showing movies all last week
Um
some clips, maybe
think in a lot, of ways, movies are the new books
Huh
Elizabeth tries a different tact
She picks up a dolphin- shaped clock from the desk
Is this new
love it
think dolphins are smarter than humans
Me too
And if you like that, you'll love this

Principal Snur pulls out an "Adopt--Dolphin" certificate
(`) He lives in the Cayman Islands
What a great story
Principal Snur visibly relaxes
He's sitting across from a kindred spirit
So what else is new
Actually,  was thinking that  want to get more involved
What a nice surprise
Specifically,  thought  could supervise the car wash
Amy's been running it the last two years
She just does so much
It might be nice to give her a little rest
Especially that early on a Saturday
'm so happy that you're dedicating yourself and becoming a real member of the  family
It just feels so good to help
: -  '  - Amy stands in the door where Elizabeth was just standing
Principal Snur is behind his desk
Elizabeth
For the seventh grade carwash
That's bonkers
32
Amy immediately regrets saying "bonkers
" (') 'm sorry
didn't mean to blow my stack
just thought it was nice to see some other teachers step up
We raised over $6000 last year
That's a record
Is this really the best time to start experimenting
Amy,  see you taking on a
lot of responsibility, what with directing "Annie" and all your work with
'd just hate to see you get overwhelmed like you did in 2004
She stares at him -- clearly, this is a touchy subject
Of course
Well,  should skedaddle
Looks like someone needs to plan a Saturday morning bike ride
She turns on her heels and walks out

Garrett laughs, mistakenly thinking that he's part of the fun

The   Tristan's gaze

Elizabeth counts money at a makeshift table and puts the earnings into a metal lockbox
She glances around and then shoves a large clump of cash into her
(
) What are you doing
Elizabeth looks up and sees Sasha hiding behind a , clearly spying
Nothing
Get out of here, Dummy
Are you stealing our money
How dare you
'm here early on a Saturday for you guys
And for the record, nobody likes a tattle tale
haven't tattled
Yet
Good
Cause if you do, 'll deny it and flunk your ass
How will that look on your resume

Alright then
Now beat it

Sasha walks off
Elizabeth picks up a hose and sprays her

Elizabeth waves to ' , who eagerly waves back

She's straddling her bike and is wearing a helmet and a sheen of recently-applied suntan lotion
She takes a sip from her Camelbak, and pedals away

Are you in here
It's Amy Squirrel
He instinctively covers himself with the brochure
Amy
What are you doing
Get out
: Amy standing inside
She scrunches her nose at the smell
This'll just take a sec
thought you might want to know that Elizabeth Halsey showed up at the carwash in a bikini top and short-shorts
It was pretty racy stuff
( ) Can we talk about this later
(quoting some adage) "Later we'll all die, said the gator to the fly
" 36
Another  walks past Amy, looking confused
He hesitates and then goes into an adjoining stall
Look, Josh Gershman's dad called and said that the carwash was a huge success
And Lauren Rissman's dad called and said the kids had a great time
don't want to speak out of school, but happened to be pedalling by and saw her get
pretty chummy with the money
,And remember, we barely know anything about her
She was a real lone wolf last year
Are you accusing Elizabeth of embezzling from the seventh grade car wash
Something about this doesn't pass the smell test, Wally
Well, they raised over $7000, so whatever she did worked
And next time you accuse a fellow teacher of stealing, you better be damn sure
We're done here
Amy takes a deep breath
Her face is
Thanks for the pep talk
Have a super day, you two
Amy exits
Immediately, there is an from the other stall, followed by a sigh

Are those new Doc Marten's
Sandy looks behind him at the dozing teacher
"Is she talking to me
" Guilty
How's Period 5
Great, thanks for asking
We got a new bassist and we finally got a regular gig, which is nice because it's earned
It's time to show the world that a bunch of teachers can really rock out
Awesome
() Hey, would you mind grabbing me my yogurt from the fridge
Sure thing
Sandy goes to the fridge
Elizabeth pulls visine from her bag, and as his head goes into the fridge, she squirts the entire container into his coffee mug
(') You should come to one of our shows
He hands her the yogurt
Oh,  can't
Elizabeth exits
Sandy sadly takes a sip of his coffee

After a beat, Elizabeth looks up
Alright, today, we're starting "School Ties

Elizabeth goes to the  player
There's a knock at the door and the   walks in holding a box
She hands it to a confused Elizabeth
Here it is
Good luck
Here what is
It's the pre-test for the state standardized test
It was in the memo
Oh, yes
In the memo
The Secretary leaves
Elizabeth stares at the box
Tristan and
a couple kids start making farting noises with their hands

Twenty-five pencils hit paper in unison

The girl at the table starts
Amy, also on duty, races over to console her

Major phony
But she also cares a lot, too

Hey, guys
You're really making a habit out of this

Ha, yeah
Actually, Sandy Pinkus in the Math department,  guess he got that stomach bug that's been going around and  got the call
heard he pooped himself in first period

Lynn, would you mind grabbing me a milk
Elizabeth gives her a "can you get out of here

So, Scott -- Lynn comes back
Sorry, what kind of milk do you want
Skim
Whole

Surprise me
Okay, 'll get you skim
No, no, 2%
Lynn walks off again
She's funny
Elizabeth notices Amy looking at her as she continues to console the girl
Elizabeth turns back to Scott
(') So, Scott,  was thinking,  would love to hear about your experiences in the Peace Corps

Maybe we could go grab a drink some night
Maybe tonight
Isn't it Back-to-School Night

(news to her) Yeah, Silly,  meant after
Cool
Let's get a group together
Yeah, definitely
Or just the two of us
Scott looks around, then lowers his voice
Oh
Um, listen, 'm really flattered
You're one of the nicest people 've met here
But
'm actually seeing someone
Oh
Yeah, we've been keeping it quiet
Because she's ugly
No
She's beautiful
She's great
She really cares about the kids
It's just
when you're dating a co-worker

Elizabeth whips around to see Amy, who's now sharing a frozen yogurt with the formerly bawling girl
Amy looks up, smiles and gives a thumbs up to Elizabeth and Scott, signalling that everything's okay with the girl
Elizabeth Amy's   straining against her blouse
She quietly seethes
Anyways, thanks again for asking me out
'm honored
And 'll take a raincheck on that group date
See ya
Scott crosses through the cafeteria
Lynn returns with a four cartons of milk
Here you go

Lynn hands them to Elizabeth, who takes them, drops them in the trash and storms off

Hi, my name's Elizabeth Halsey
Soooooo
Any questions
Sasha's Mother eagerly raises her hand
Elizabeth points to her
' Hi, 'm Sasha's mother
We waved to each other at the carwash
'm a little concerned with the importance you're placing on movies
What about the state test
Elizabeth points to her sign on the wall -- "Don't Question My Authority
" That's exactly what  say to my students
Listen, 'm a good teacher
And the school hired me because 'm good at what  do
(as the parents take this in) And the reason your son loves my class is because  inspire him
Movies are one tool that  use
also use other multimedia techniques, which 'm not going to get into right now
Look, could take you day by day through my entire syllabus, but that's not how  do things
'm not one of these stuffy teachers who's totally by the book talk to the kids like they're little adults

So that's my spiel, as the Jews say

So proud

Unfortunately, in a class of twenty- five
Ugh
Class sizes are ridiculous
And with the amount they pay teachers
Thank god you love what you do
guess what 'm getting at is, maybe you could help out by giving me a little -- you know -- somethin somethin
Elizabeth offers her hand, palm up
Melody stares back at her blankly
(') It's just, it's really tough to teach the way that  want to teach when there's so little money

You know what 'm going to do for you
Melody opens her pocketbook
Elizabeth smiles

Sasha motions for her to roll down the window
Elizabeth doesn't
Is that marijuana
It is
But it's medicinal
Doctor gave it to me
Not that it's any of your business

Oh, okay
Feel better

She grabs the container and quickly closes her window
Elizabeth starts eating a cookie
You have anything to drink
Sasha shakes her head
(') Word to the wise: stop dressing like you're running for congress
don't want to run for congress

That's what 'm talking about
Keep saying stuff like that, you're gonna get punched
You really want to be President or is that what your parents tell to be
Sasha shrugs
(') You don't have to decide right now
Who knows
Maybe you wake up one day and decide that you love giving massages and you want to be a masseuse
Salary plus tips
Think about it
If  think about it, will  get extra credit

Watch your feet

It's 3:40
She yawns and gets out of bed
'  - Elizabeth opens her refrigerator
Nothing except ketchup packets, mustard packets and soy sauce packets
She reaches for her bong and tries lighting it
Once
Twice
She shakes the lighter
No luck
She carries the bong to the stove, turns on the stove, and tries lighting it from there
No luck

The Homeless Guy looks at her strangely
It's Christmas

Halsey

Elizabeth tears through a plate of Christmas cuisine
This is a real treat for Garrett
He doesn't have a lot of friends come by the house
find that hard to believe
( ) Listen,  hate to eat and run, but 've gotta head over to the shelter
thought we could play board games
#1 shelter
That is so inspiring
Yeah,  love helping bums
Oh, but you have to wait for dessert
We have a real treat
If it's cheesecake, 'll stay
It's even better than cheesecake
() Garrett, why don't you run and get some of your new poetry
(feigning
embarrassment) Oh god, no one wants to hear it
Oh god, 'm so embarrassed
Don't be shy, Marbles
Garrett runs out of the room
If you're not really serving dessert, 'm gonna have to get going
One poem
If you like it, maybe you can read it to your homeless friends
'  -   - Garrett stands in front of Elizabeth and his family
He opens his journal, clears his throat, and begins
This is called "The Chase," by Garrett Tiara
() /My love for you is / Her hair is long and straight / Isn't it great
/ About her smile / That  would walk a mile for / About her personality / That makes me see the best in me / And at night when we sleep / Our souls locked in deep / So that when we sleep / We can stop pretending / And embrace our beautiful ending
Melody applauds
The Aunts join in
Elizabeth claps, then gets up to go
Garrett shakes them all off
She sits back down
We'll dance our dance / We'll revel in romance perchance / One glance / One dance / Because together we can achieve
(really reaching for it) Ba-lance
Thank you
He closes his journal
Everyone applauds
Melody looks to Elizabeth for a reaction
Junior likes to rhyme
53
Patty, Nancy, why don't you give me a hand with dessert -- give them a chance to talk about the poem
The women exit, leaving Garrett and Elizabeth
So your poem's about that girl
Chase, yeah
You got the subtext
Can  give you some advice
Please
Number one, stop writing poetry
Two: stop reading it
And three: don't set your sights so high
mean, she's really hot
If  were you, 'd try for that chubby girl that sits up front -- the one with the teeth
Elizabeth puts her hands to show teeth going off in different directions
But  like Chase
Not gonna happen
Look,  was that hot girl
Hotter, even
And  never would have gone out with a kid like you
And 'm not saying that to be mean
'm saying it to be helpful
What do you know
You don't-even know our names
'll tell you what  know: a kid who wears the same "Gymnastics" sweatshirt three days a week isn't getting laid until he's 26
That's what  know
() This sweatshirt was my dad's
It's all he left when he left
54
Well, there's a reason he didn't pack it
(quiet, steely) Fuck you
Elizabeth pats Garrett on the shoulder
Good luck being a loser
Thank your mom for dinner
Elizabeth heads for the door
Happy New Year
Are you spending that alone, too, or do you want my mom to invite you over
She gives him the finger over her shoulder and leaves
'  - The students, many tanned, many with braids in their hair from their winter vacations, silently stare at Elizabeth
She looks haggard
She pulls out a bottle of cough syrup and takes a long swig
The kids look at each other, like "what is she doing
" Elizabeth lets out a lame, fake cough
Shut up
'   - Elizabeth is-checking her makeup in the mirror
Lynn enters
Her blouse has a healthy serving of vomit on it
Hey, welcome back
What is that, vomit
Lynn grabs some towels and blots at the stain
Yeah, and a little blood
The kids had too much sugar

Do you want to come
Ugh
No

Are you coming to 'In Cahoots' tonight
My band's doing a few songs
Could be fun
Um, yes
That sounds like a party
(then, to Lynn) Lynn, do you want to come
Yes
We'll all grab a drink
Great

Rockabye, rockabye
Bye, bye
Bye, bye
Elizabeth and Lynn at the bar
Aren't they terrific
Elizabeth eye-fucks Scott
She catches his eye and he quickly smiles before nervously turning his attention to Amy
Elizabeth watches Amy dance in  M0, her bouncing up and down
(staring at Amy's breasts) They're perfect
You should hear some of their originals
She turns to the bartender
Two more
(then, to Lynn) You want anything
No thanks
You know,  was thinking that if you still need that money, you should
try and go for the bonus
Can't hurt
What bonus
For the state test
(off Elizabeth's look) () 57
(') Whichever teacher has the highest scoring class gets a bonus
We talk about it all the time in the faculty meetings
How much
$5700
Could be good, right

Lynn runs out onto the dance floor and joins Amy

Amy kicks her shoes off, and starts dancing
Lynn follows suit
Elizabeth throws back her drink and exits

Spencer shrugs
Come on, come on

Now, who can tell me why Jem cries when the hole in the tree is filled with cement
Anyone
Because she's a cry baby
The kids chuckle
Chase looks back at Garrett
( ) Get out
Garrett clicks up the handle on his bag and heads for the door
(') We're here to learn
Anyone else have a problem with that
Good
So who has the answer to my question
Everyone looks down

Well, now  am
And we're having a quiz tomorrow
Panic
(') On the first hundred pages
You can't do that

Zip your shit
We've fallen behind, and honestly, your practice tests scores sucked balls -- which was embarrassing to me both on a personal level and as an educator
() Things are about to change
Recess is over

She stops, takes a hit from her bong, and continues
Her roommate, Kirk, enters through the front door, sipping from a Big Gulp
Did you get my Cool Ranch
He tosses her a bag of chips
You owe me two bucks
Kirk walks into his room and closes the door
'  - Elizabeth paces
She has a book of stickers in her hand
Okay, now, what is the significance of the Mockingbird in the novel
What was Harper Lee trying to tell us
No one raises their hand

This is as close to real teaching as we've seen from Elizabeth
Sasha raises her hand
We see that she already has two gold star stickers on her forehead

Chase raises her hand
(') It's a symbol for, um, equality
Elizabeth puts a sticker on Chase's forehead
Okay, good
Can anyone add to what that girl said

Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, you've heard the "facts," but come on, you know me

The class laughs
(') Come on, seriously
You're gonna side with Chase and Shawn over me
Use examples from the book

You've just gotta look at the facts-
Elizabeth nods in agreement
The bell
Good work today
And don't forget to leave your closing statements on my desk
The students all dutifully drop off their papers, placing them in a neat stack next to other ungraded

You should hear what they call me
And 'm not a racist

Oh, right
Elizabeth takes out a notebook and pen and starts jotting down notes
Look, Marjorie,  know my tests aren't perfect
But what's the alternative
'm all for free thinking and creativity, but how do you formulate an education budget without hard numbers from one of my tests
You don't need to convince me
But you know what would help, Carl
For me to see one of this year's tests
No problem at all
Elizabeth lights up

Carl goes to a mini-fridge and pulls out an already opened bottle of white wine

Carl stumbles towards her
Elizabeth deftly moves around the desk and exits into the bullpen

He
stops at the photocopier, steadies himself momentarily and then passes out,
Elizabeth grabs the lanyard from Carl's neck and heads back into his office
She goes over to the filing cabinets, unlocks it with one of the keys, and starts rifling

Something big
Maybe two big things
Amy walks up and gives Elizabeth a big, fake hug

Her phone
She checks the   -- "

Stop fucking calling me
She powers her phone off and continues down the street
She passes two
(') Hey, guys
Hi
'm looking for a young kid, about 13
Really annoying, kind of a cry baby
Have you seen him
#1 Fuck you
Fantastic
#2 You best step off, bitch, because this is my block
This here's Poetry's block
Poetry
#1 Cause that's how she fuck
#2 fuck like that
Lyrical
Something occurs to Elizabeth
She smiles
Thank you, Poetry
And Poetry's friend
Elizabeth walks off and sticks out her hand, trying to hail a cab
She passes a bunch of   warming up by a trash can fire
#1 Won't get a cab in this neighborhood
slows next to Elizabeth
rolls down the passenger window and leans out
Hey, sweetheart
How much for a titty fuck
need a ride
Oh yeah,  need a ride, too
Right through those titties
No,  need a ride
Like you driving, and me pointing mace at your face
'll give you ten bucks
( ) This is weird
Twenty
Elizabeth hops in
: - '   - are waiting
few console Garrett's mom, Melody
few    idle nearby
' ( ) He's gonna be alright
The police will find him
'm sure they're back at the hotel
Probably just a mix-up
The bus pulls up to the curb and stops
Scott steps off first, clearly confused by the crowd and  cameras
Immediately, a reporter thrusts a mic into his face
What can you
tell us about the alleged romance between Elizabeth Halsey and a 13 year old student
() What
The students step off and the Parents swarm them
#1 Oh baby, are you okay
Did she touch you
Sasha's parents engulf her in a hug
' Oh Sasha
(then, to Sasha's Dad) You expect this stuff to happen in Florida, not here
,
-      - Garrett walks up to a drab building where he sees Elizabeth on the curb waiting for him
There's a tiny sign that reads "Office of the Poet Laureate
" It's closed
Won't be open till morning
Come on
Let's get back to the hotel
'm sure everyone's mad at you
Garrett stands his ground
'm not leaving without talking to the poet laureate
Do you think that some Shel Silverstein wannabe is going to tell you the meaning of life
What do you care
'm here, right
You have to be here
You're a teacher
Not for long
'm getting fired for cheating as soon as we get back
Garrett takes a seat next to Elizabeth
So
you came looking for me on your own
Yup
(holds up her shoes) And you owe me a new pair of Nanette Lepores
just want to know what to say to Chase to get her to like me
You know what you should do
What
Just go out and sleep with as many girls, as you possibly can
Get her out of your head
They'll probably reject me, too
Yeah, probably
But life's about how you deal with rejection
You can either hide in a corner and cry or you can get stronger every time
And  figure a kid like you with not much going for him -- if he were to choose the latter -- might end up becoming a pretty strong man
() Thanks
Now come on, let's get out of here
'm freezing and Mr
Delacourte's probably shitting a brick
can't go back there
All the kids will laugh at me
You seriously think they haven't been laughing already
Maybe Chase is wondering where  am
Hate to break it to you, kid, but  don't think anyone gives two shits where we are

Snur sits across from Garrett's mother, Melody, who is beside herself
She is wearing a beret and Amy are standing behind the desk
Principal Snur passes her a dolphin-shaped tissue box
What else can you tell us about Garrett and Ms
Halsey's relationship
It was strictly student/teacher
Garrett's a gifted poet and Ms
Halsey was trying to bring that out of him
Amy snorts
Did they ever spend time outside of the classroom
Aside from Christmas at our house
Absolutely not
The Detective glances at the Principal, like "Oh boy
" She used to give all the guys that look
That sex look
You know -- Amy gives her version of a sexy look to the Detective
(') She's a monster
Mrs
Tiara,  think we might need to consider the possibility that Elizabeth Halsey has abducted your son and that the two of them are involved in a sexual relationship
() Marbles doesn't even have armpit hair
(quietly, to Principal Snur) We should send out an Amber Alert
We need to catch this Sicko

His head falls back on
She leaves it

You're quite the celebrity
You want an autograph
You get one call
Elizabeth picks up the phone
The Sergeant gives her some space
( ) Hi, this is Elizabeth Halsey calling
'm calling to cancel my surgery for tomorrow
Extenuating circumstances
Please, please don't make me lose my deposit
Elizabeth slams down the receiver
If you need medical attention, we're required to provide it
Just take me back to my cell

Elizabeth and her roommate, Kirk, who's now dressed in an ill-fitting suit and has his hair combed, sit across from Principal Snur and the  , a no- nonsense woman in her 60s
Again, speaking on behalf of the whole administration,  just want to apologize for what happened
Clearly, there was a miscommunication
Oh, you think
Kirk puts his hand up to Elizabeth, like "'ll take care of this
" 106
My client has been an upstanding member of society her entire life
She has spent time as an educator, she has -- More than once
And she has touched the lives of those around her -- until last night
Elizabeth pulls Kirk into a lawyer/client huddle
() You kind of sound like a pro
() Do you think they're going to find out that  didn't pass the bar
() You're doing great
They break from their huddle
Your administration jumped to conclusions, set off a media fire-storm and has humiliated one of its own
As Ms
Halsey's chief counsel, 've advised her that we have an extremely strong case of libel and that it's certainly within her province to sue the district
How do we make this go away
Ms
Halsey is not a litigious woman
She wants this whole matter to go away as quickly and painlessly as possible
Kirk slides a piece of paper across the desk
(') This is a list of our demands
The Superintendent and Principal Snur scan the list
You're kidding me
Don't answer right now
Let it marinate
Oh, and  should mention that if this goes to trial,  can cry on cue
Elizabeth starts crying
Everybody looks at her, aghast
And as quickly she started, she stops
(') Now, if you'll all excuse me,  should be heading to fifth period
hate to be tardy
- Elizabeth heads down the empty hallway
From the auditorium, the faint sound of "Tomorrow, Tomorrow" from "Annie" can be heard
Amy steps out of the auditorium, humming along to the song
She notices Elizabeth coming to her
Amy debates her options
Elizabeth
was so worried
You gave us quite a scare, you did
Elizabeth doesn't acknowledge her and continues walking toward Amy, only feet away now
(') (attempting some levity) Somebody's being a grumple-- Elizabeth punches Amy square in the nose
Amy drops to her knees and grabs her nose, now squirting blood
(') Elizabeth keeps walking and turns a corner and the hallway starts filling with

Polite laughter
(') But seriously
With summer around the corner, it's time to not only say goodbye to another school year, but to also say goodbye to one of our own
Elizabeth smiles

Amy, her face completely healed, steps forward, with a pursed smile

Sandy, the ponytailed teacher, pipes up
Speech
Speech
Although leaving was a difficult choice
Amy looks over to Elizabeth, who motions for her to continue
(') When the superintendent personally asks you to work at one of the worst schools in the state, you say yes
'm looking forward to bringing my brand of zany energy and lust -- not love, lust -- for learning to the underprivileged students at Malcolm  High
welcome the challenge
The Teachers applaud, Scott the most enthusiastic
Elizabeth steps up to Amy, who flinches
Here,  got you this
Elizabeth hands Amy a poster tube
She
opens it and unravels the "Integrity" poster that Elizabeth stole
(') And good luck
Somebody's gonna need it
Elizabeth heads for the door
Scott catches up to her
Hey, Stranger
(then, whispers) Listen, now that Amy's transferring, maybe the two of us could go grab a drink
Elizabeth walks out
: : -    - Elizabeth's 1994 Grand-Am pulls into her spot
And as her bare leg steps out of the car, we -  - The hallway is empty
We  Elizabeth from behind, and as she reaches for the door to her class, we '  - Quick cuts
From behind, we see Elizabeth place an on each desk, just as Amy did earlier
Elizabeth's walls are still bare, except for a framed photo of Amy's class picture, with Amy's messed up face, from the year before
The bell
Elizabeth turns and we now  that she has Elizabeth walks to her door and opens it, watching the students as they reconnect with friends and share stories about summer camp
She notices Sasha who is  a 's shoulders

Sasha clearly enjoys the attention
Elizabeth smiles
Garrett walks by, hand in hand with Chase
Trailing both of them are identical rolling backpacks
He sees Elizabeth and runs over
You and Chase, huh
She likes the poetry
She likes that 'm kind of a celebrity
But 'm cool with it

Easy
Well,  should get going

Plastic surgeon, actually
He's amazing
He sounds amazing

No, in recovery
And  looked like ass, so  know it's real
Sounds like a fairy tale
It is
Storybook
Well, not total storybook
It's a little messy because his wife filed for divorce last week, but we're gonna get through that
() So you want to grab lunch later
Sure
My treat
No, you got it last time
We'll split it
