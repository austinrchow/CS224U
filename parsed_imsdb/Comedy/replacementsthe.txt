by Vince McKewin February 19, 1999 : - It's raining lightly in the harbor and the water around the moored boats looks dirty and cold
We   a sad excuse for a boat sitting in an end slip
It's a sea-gull-shitcovered, thirtyfoot cabin cruiser that hasn't cruised in a long, long time
ratty looking unpainted plywood addition has been nailed to the top of the cabin
It's partially covered with a blue plastic tarp
:     ,  - The tarp moves and  's half-naked torso emerges from under it
Shane is late twenties, golden boy handsome, but quickly going to seed
He looks hung over
Shane glances up at the sky and rain
He pulls on the top part of an old patched wet suit and zips it up
He shivers
- We're  around the harbor with Shane in an old Zodiac inflatable
Shane has pulled up the attached rubber hood to his wet suit so that only the white, pasty oblong of his face is visible
It's still raining as he steers the little boat around the sailboats and yachts
He pulls up to a fiftyfoot sailboat and the
With practiced moves, he ties the dinghy to the rear rail of the sailboat and clips a bill for services rendered on the sailboat's stern line
He slips on a weight belt,    puts on a pair of old gaffer taped goggles,    jams the end of a air-hose in his mouth, and    falls backward out of the dinghy and into the    water
- It's dark, dirty and murky
Suddenly, Shane floats   and comes  us with a long spatula
He attacks the underside of the sailboat which is covered with green algae muck that hangs a foot off the bottom of the boat
The spatula scrapes away the green mess revealing the pure white underside of the boat
As he scrapes
Muck from the boat floats past him
This doesn't look like fun
As he works, he happens to look down and notices something on the bottom
' Amidst the beer cans and other trash, something golden is sitting on the bottom
Shane takes a deep pull on his hose, lets it go and drifts down
shaft of sunlight penetrates the murky water and reveals a broken trophy half-buried in the mud
Shane kneels over it and picks it up
The trophy is almost a full-size football rendered in bronze attached to a broken base
Shane turns "the ball" over in his hands
He grips the seams like he's done this before
Then he holds the football out in front of him
Suddenly, he starts barking garbled signals to an imaginary offense
He turns to his running back as he yells something like "Blue 31
" It comes out in bubbles He cocks his left leg and his wide receiver goes in motion
Then on the "snap" he turns and starts a five step drop
He moves in slow motion because hey
he's underwater
He executes a perfect play action fake on the third step of his drop, and looks "down field" for his receivers
But there's a blitz
He steps up in the pocket but a linebacker's arm almost takes his head off
He dodges, he bobs, he weaves in a kind of delicate ballet
He rolls left and keeps looking for the open man
Suddenly he points down field, pulls up and cocks his arm
The "ball" comes behind his ear and snaps forward in a perfect release
The trophy spins    but we Shane as he watches his pass
Suddenly, he throws both arms up in a touchdown signal
We   him as he freezes in this pose of victory, fifteen feet underwater, on the trash-covered, muddy bottom of Marina Del Rey
: '  (, ) - Bam
Miami Dolphin linebacker crushes a Washington Redskin running back and lands on his throat, elbow first
It's a beautiful fall day in November and Miami is beating the Skins in front of seventy-six thousand crazed Washington fans
The Redskins are at their home stadium better known as "The Big
" - and   are calling the game in shirtsleeves
That play, my friends, sums up the Redskins' running game all day long
Now Washington calls their last time out
Madden leans over to do his diagram that shows up on your  screen
We   him as he draws and explains
Hey, the Dolphins do this as good as anybody
See, in a four, three, two, two, you got the guards
boom
Plugging up the middle, then the corners
boom and boom
Are free to box
leaving the middle    linebacker to cut off    the trap here
boom
Third and twenty-two, but forget the first down with eight seconds showing and the Skins down by a touchdown
Could be the last play
Could be the last play of the season if the players go out
- Redskin quarterback   is conferring with Redskin head coach near the bench
Madden and Summerall continue
(
) Take it all in, people
This could be it for 2,000
We   veteran Redskin center , 38, standing on the sidelines, uniform totally clean
He looks near tears
(
) Once again, if you haven't heard, it was announced during halftime that the Players Association will hold a press conference immediately following this game -- that would make it about five o'clock Eastern time -- and it is expected that the players' union will announce a strike effective immediately
Twelve striking-looking women dressed in burgundy and gold are doing some inane chatter to a section of fans that ignore them
The girls are led by pretty , a bundle of manic energy inside a body from heaven
(
) It's all about money, folks
More money, of course and ain't it always
The shame of it is the big losers are you out there, the fans
The Redskin quarterback moves to the huddle
(
) Here we go: Third down, eight seconds to play, ball on the Dolphins' thirty-three yard line
Skins down by a touchdown
The huddle breaks and Martel sets up over the center
Green 48
Green 48
Hut
Hut
The ball is snapped and Martel drops back
He looks for a receiver and doesn't see anybody
He steps up in the pocket, sees an opening and takes off running down field
(
) There goes Martel
Martel is a pretty good broken field runner for a big guy
Plus with the defense covering every possible receiver, he's got a lot of daylight
Nobody has touched him as he crosses the fifteen
Suddenly, a safety, smaller than Martel, looms in front of him at the ten
Martel goes down in one of those wimpy quarterback slides before the safety can even hit him
The  sounds and the game is over
They look at each other in disbelief Well
Martel goes down ten yards short of a score
On maybe the last play of the season
think he might have slipped
Yeah, there's a lot of that going around
We'll see these guys throughout
They're typical low level Washington bureaucrats named ,  and  who live for the Hogs -- the traditional name for the Redskin offensive linemen
Todd is shirtless and his entire upper body is painted Redskin red
At that moment, they are livid with their quarterback and Bob is speaking for them all
We're    coming to your house    tonight, and we're    gonna fucking kill    you
And if you got a    dog, we're gonna kill    your fucking dog too
Behind her, the rest of the cheerleaders are already walking away
Annabelle looks at Quarterback Martel with pure disgust as he walks off the field
: - The room's blinds are pulled tightly against the bright sunlight
Only the blue light of a  illuminates anything
Suddenly, we hear an old man in the bed give out with a loud piercing wail
The door to the room bangs open and an English male nurse named  , dressed in white, comes running in
He's carrying a syringe in each hand, poised at the ready
He runs to the bed of    the still wailing '    (75)
'Neil is hooked up to an oxygen tank,    watching the just completed Redskin game    with the sound off
Did they win or lose
'Neil continues to wail
That has the distinct tonal quality of a loss
He puts one needle down and jabs 'Neil with the other one
He murmurs to the old man as he injects him
Nice medicine for a loss
Keeps us calm
Makes us not so sad
Keeps us on an even keel
Gives us some perspective, doesn't it
And we'll save the winning medicine for next Sunday, won't we
He finishes
' If you keep talking to me like 'm a five- year-old, 'm going to hurt you
Sounds exciting
He reaches for the phone and hits the speed dial
We'll want to talk to coach now, won't we
He hands the phone to 'Neil
' (on the phone) What the fuck was that
: ' Coach Tildon sitting in his office
We can hear players getting dressed, listening to and getting  outside his open door
(on the phone) think he slipped
' Bullshit he slipped
He could have scored
Anybody could have scored
got one foot in the god damn grave and  could have scored
Mister 'Neil, let's face facts: The players are going out
It's gonna happen
And nobody wants to get hurt on the last play before a strike that could go on for the rest of the season
' You god damn wimp
You're fired
Get out
Get out
Get out
'Neil throws the phone down
Augustine picks it up and then cranks up the oxygen a notch
'Neil takes big gulps of the rich air
Better
It always makes you feel better when you fire someone, we know it does, don't we
Yes
' Get me Jimmy McGinty
Get him here
Tonight
'Neil sucks hard on the oxygen
: - is interviewing  , the huge defensive end for the Redskins
Wilson wears an enormous diamond earring
Wilson is dressing at his locker
Hey, man,  do what my union says
But you're already one of the highest paid players in the game
The fans just don't see the point of a player like you striking
Let me tell you something: 'm a big man, you see
Wilson holds his arms out
Yes, he's gigantic
There are some days when  am so beat up, that  cannot dress my own big ass
asked management for a valet or some shit to help me dress and they said no way
So, fuck 'em
(
) Shut up everybody, here it is
Somebody turns  a  in the locker room
handsome ex-player named Jerome Lindell steps up to a podium at a press conference
He's wearing a two thousand dollar suit
On the  he is identified with a super: "  -- President -- National Football League Players' Association
" (
) have just left a meeting with representatives of the owners and  am sad to say that they have refused the players' final demands which center around a rise in the current salary cap
() (
) (') Therefore,  am recommending that all players walk out and not play until our demands are met want the players to walk out tall, to walk out righteous, to walk out in the knowledge that we do this as a team
We shall overcome the fat cats
send peace to my union brothers
The entire locker room is silent for a beat
And then everyone starts getting dressed again, maybe a little slower than before
Shit, 'm goin' to Vegas
: ''  -   ' - As he sleeps peacefully
The only sound is the  of his
Then we hear    in a glass
'Neil opens his eyes and sees: McGINTY, a handsome devil in his late sixties, wearing golf clothes and sipping the last dregs of a Scotch rocks
McGINTY You look like shit
' 'm dying, Jimmy
McGINTY You been dying for twenty years
'Neil motions to the glass
Jimmy pours three fingers from a Glenlivet bottle and hands it to him
McGINTY That poof of a nurse of yours is gonna kick my ass if he catches you drinking
'Neil removes his oxygen to sip his whiskey
He smiles as it goes down
' Gimme a butt
McGINTY quit
' No
McGinty nods
' You pussy
want you to come back as head coach
fired that asshole Tilden today
McGINTY 'm retired
And besides, you don't have a team
They all flew home in their jets to their castles
' We're gonna finish the season anyway
All of us owners decided
We're gonna use replacement players
McGINTY You're a bunch of greedy bastards, aren't you
' Us, greedy
What about the god damn players
got the highest payroll in the and they still want more
McGINTY That's because you've been bottle-feeding straight cash to these big babies for years
'Neil sips his whiskey and calms down
' No team owner in their right mind is gonna give back those
revenues
() ' (') All we promised Fox was twenty-two guys with a pulse every Sunday
But think about it, Jimmy
We got a great opportunity here
We got a chance to put a team on the field that plays the game just for the love of it
Like we used to play it
McGINTY We also used to play without face guards
' Jimmy, 'm really dying
The doctor says 'll be gone by Superbowl Sunday
Help me bring a winner back to
You did it for me once before
You can do it again
McGINTY Listen:  golf once a week with the President of the United States
walk my grandkids to school every day got a    young wife who will    fuck me any time want,    which frankly, isn't    too often, but it's    comforting to know it's    there
don't need    it
' Come on
Wouldn't it be fun
bunch of poor nobodies who play to win instead of a bunch of bitchy millionaires
You can put it together, Jimmy
Player's love you
They always have
McGinty pours more Scotch and looks into the glass
' Tell me you're gonna do it
McGINTY Shut up, 'm thinking
(pause) Okay
Here's the deal: you let me recruit who want, with no interference
' Absolutely
McGINTY 'm talking anybody want
No exceptions
And no interference with my coaching, either, like you used to
' Sure, Jimmy, sure
McGINTY And one more thing: no more Notre Dame stories
You start telling me Notre Dame stories and  pull your plug personally swear to God
'Neil smiles
' Deal
: '  '  - McGinty is sitting behind the empty desk as his two main coaches give him a presentation
They are offensive coordinator and defensive coordinator Six phone lines with internet access on two: One for defense and one for offense
We thought we would skip special teams for the moment
Except for a kicker
We definitely need a kicker
place kicker over a punter
The thinking being that if we lose the toss, we have to be able to at least kick off
Both coaches laugh nervously
McGinty doesn't say anything
Okay
Here's the list of every player cut this past season
What we would like to do is
McGINTY (interrupting) Those people
(pointing to list) Most of them were cut because they were shitty
McGinty takes out a piece of paper of his own with a bunch of names on it
McGINTY We're going to go another way here
've done some scouting since  retired
On an ad hoc basis, of course
And what have here is a list of people 've kept an eye on
They've all played football somewhere, but only a few in the pros
And they've all got something
unique to bring to the game
We're gonna take these people and try to put together a winning team
And if nothing else, they should be fun to watch
McGinty looks up when he senses someone standing in the doorway
It's  , the veteran Redskin we saw standing on the sidelines with the clean uniform
You won't need a center
McGINTY How you doin', Reese
Bored and ready to retire
'm just looking for one more hit
One more really good hit
McGINTY What about the strike
Hell, 'm rich
got no complaint with Mister 'Neil
just want a chance to play one last time
() (') Shit, 'd rather go out with a broken leg than sitting on the bench
McGinty nods to Pilachowski
The coach takes a marker and fills in "Evans" in the center circle
McGINTY Welcome to the new Washington Redskins
(to his coaches) Let's find Reese somebody to play with
: - bunch of  types are cooking up a vat of speed
These guys are big, and badasslooking
After a beat, one of the Bikers looks up at the door
Did you hear something
The other biker shakes his head, no
The one who asked the question walks over to the door and listens for a beat
Nothing
He turns to go back and suddenly the door disintegrates in front of a charging man wearing a "police" windbreaker
This is     , a big,    young, psychotic cop,    who immediately    runs over the poor Biker who    was listening at    the door, kicking the guy    in the head as    he goes by
Bateman dives on two more Bikers, and viciously head-butts one of them
He stuffs the other's head into the meth mixture, pulls him out and clubs him with a big police blackjack, three quick times: Rap
Rap
Rap
The guy goes down like lead
Bateman looks around and spots a big cowering in a corner
The Biker is terrified
Bateman takes two stops toward the guy when suddenly three more  wearing windbreakers run in, out of breath
They look around at the unconscious Bikers
#1 Jesus, Bateman
Why don't you ever wait for us
Someone's  is going off
The three cops look at theirs
Nothing
The cowering Biker looks at his
#2 Not me
Bateman pulls his beeper, studies it and looks puzzled
What area code is 703
#1 Washington,
: - loaf of Wonder Bread is spinning through the air in
It comes  us, twisting and turning
He's tall, maybe 22, and positioned behind the cash register
He's wearing a Washington Redskins sweatshirt
Clifford's hands are up as he waits to catch the bread which was tossed by his  at the back of the store
The loaf hits Clifford's hands and then bounces out
It lands on the counter in front of a -- smart-ass
Nice hands
(not amused) What else
pack of Marlboro Reds, a pint of Martel Cognac and a box of Trojans, extra long
Clifford grabs the Kid's two one-dollar bills, and makes change for the bread
Get out of here
'm telling your mother you were talking like that
The Kid leaves
The Manager yells from the back of the store as he holds up a portable phone
Hey, Clifford, somebody on the phone wants you to play football next weekend
Tell 'em  gotta work Saturday
And 'm watching the Redskins on Sunday
Ain't nothing stopping me from watching the Redskins on Sunday
(mumbling) No way that's gonna be happening, me not watching the Redskins on Sunday
(into phone) He's gotta work
(pause) They said they'll pay you
Pay me
How much
(on phone) How much
(pause) Ten thousand five hundred dollars
(stunned) Ray, who the fuck is on the phone
(pause) It's the Washington Redskins
Clifford collapses
: - We hear deafening  as we hold on and  , two huge bodyguards, dressed in identical black suits
Suddenly,   the artist formerly known as Prince comes off   stage, grabs a towel from an assistant   and starts walking with Jamal in front and   Andre in the rear
As they walk, a
Andre pulls it from his pocket and answers it, quietly
Jamal runs interference with the techies and groupies backstage
(to someone) Get out of the way
(to someone else) Don't look at him
He don't like being looked at, god damn it
No eye contact
As they walk, Andre is still talking on the phone
Finally, they get to the backstage door and stop
The rock star prepares to run the gauntlet of adoring fans behind his trusty bodyguards
But his bodyguards are conversing quietly but urgently with each other
One of the assistants throws open the door
big mob waits outside
The anointed one turns to his bodyguards to lead the way, but
they're gone
The mob surges
The artist formerly known as Prince screams as he's trampled to death by his fans
: - Shane Falco, wearing his patched wetsuit, climbs out of his inflatable dinghy and flops onto the deck of his cabin cruiser
He looks cold and tired
McGINTY (
) You look like a swordfish  caught once
Shane jumps
McGinty is sitting in an old deck chair on the stern of the boat
McGINTY He hit the deck just like that
Shane studies his visitor
And you look like that coach from the Seventies
From the Redskins
McGinty
Except you look a shitload older
McGINTY The price of happiness
Something to take the chill off
He offers Shane an elegant flask
Shane takes it and drinks
McGINTY 'm running the Redskins again
And want you to quarterback 'em
No, man, 've been out way too long
McGINTY What, three years since San Diego dumped you
That's nothing
You're in shape, flopping around in the water like that
You know what my nickname was in San Diego, don't you
McGINTY Sure
Footsteps
As in,  hear 'em and dump the ball
McGINTY Well, you didn't have much of a line to protect you
got two concussions to prove it
McGINTY That's why girls don't play the game
McGinty drinks from his flask
McGINTY scouted you when you were playing at Ohio State
told San Diego they were probably making a mistake when they signed you
(truly shocked) No kidding
McGINTY Oh, you had a lot of tools: a quick release
Fast scrambler by nature
Good downfield vision
But you got hurt a lot
And worst of all, you never could win the big game
What did you lose the Sugar Bowl by, your senior year
What, forty points
Forty-five
And now you want to recruit me
McGINTY scrambling quarterback is gonna do real well in this new replacement environment
And to tell you the truth, think  can help you with your biggest problem
Okay
What's my biggest problem
McGINTY Courage
think that Sugar Bowl took it all out of you
There's a beat as Shane looks away
'm retired from football
McGINTY Yeah, and it looks like things have been going really well for you since
Shane doesn't meet McGinty's eyes
like being here
It's quiet
like being alone
McGINTY Yeah
No screaming crowds, that's for sure
(pause) You know what separates the winners from the losers
Gettin' back on the horse
The one that kicked you in the teeth
You're still young
You still got bags of talent
If you do well, who knows what will happen when the strike ends
Shane keeps staring out at the water
McGINTY You want me to tell you you're not going to get hurt
You know you will
No doubt about that
But, hell
McGinty points to the boats in the harbor
McGINTY Wouldn't you rather get hurt than scrape the shit off of other guys' toys
: ( ) - We're right off Queens Boulevard on a busy side street where  , 30, is taking book
Lou is short, dark and handsome
He leans against the wall of a liquor store
#1 Deuce and an eightball on Go Down, Rita in the eighth
Lou writes quickly on a small pad
After a beat, another passerby leans in and whispers something to Lou
Lou writes quickly again
>From across the street an old woman sticks her head out of a four-story walk-up
This is '  who speaks with a heavy Italian accent
Louis, you got a phone call
(from across the street) Who is it
It's the Washington Foreskins
What
Ma, what are you, out a your tree
(yelling louder) 'm telling you they said it's the Washington Foreskins
Foreskins
Foreskins
Foreskins
People in the street are now starting to look up at this old woman screaming "Foreskins
" Louis quickly crosses the street to his apartment house
But at that moment, a soccer ball bounces toward him from where a group of kids are playing in an alley
Out of pure instinct, Lou gives it a mighty boot
We  the arc of the ball as it sails the block
Everyone stops to admire the kick
Still airborne, the ball crosses Queens Boulevard
At that moment, a very old mafioso type is being helped from his limo by several lieutenants
Pow
The ball hits the old guy right in the back of the head, knocking off his porkpie hat and dropping him to the pavement like a bullet
The lieutenants pull pistols and surround their fallen leader
He sees what happens and quickly ducks into his apartment house
He spots Lou before he disappears inside
: - Coach  , a good-looking ex- running back in his late twenties, is coaching a high school player
We can see that Roland is wearing a pretty substantial knee brace
He holds up a football
Cut right on me, now
Right on me
He pitches the ball out to one kid, who runs right at him, steps on Roland's foot with his cleats and then cuts around him
Roland screams and falls to the ground
Not right on me, goddamn it
He writhes there a beat until he hears: (
) Coach Lamont
Phone call
Long distance
Washington,
It's the Washington Redskins
Roland holds his foot and manages a smile because he seems to know what the phone call means
(to the sky) Thank you, Lord
: (
) - The stadium appears empty
Suddenly, a football thrown with a perfect spiral comes  us
We see the ball sail cleanly through a rubber ring attached to the crossbar on the goalpost
He's in shorts and a sweatshirt taking snaps from center Reese Evans
Nice
Try a roll to the right
Evans bends over another ball
Shane sets up in the shotgun
' (
) Shane 'Footsteps' Falco
This is what you're going to build an offense around
- McGinty is sitting with 'Neil on the fifty yard line twenty rows back
Augustine holds 'Neil's oxygen tank as the old man sits huddled in a coat that's way too big for him
' Christ, Jimmy,  ask you to build me a team based on balls and the first player  see is Footsteps Falco
McGINTY He's got as much natural talent as any quarterback in the league
' And he's got the happiest feet 've ever seen
McGINTY All he needs is a shot of self-confidence
He's our quarterback
That's the way it is
' What about a safety
We got two a days starting tomorrow and a game in five days
And we still don't have a safety
'Neil motions to Augustine for more oxygen
Here we go
Nice fat little hits
He turns the valve up
'Neil breathes deeply
' called a friend of mine who just happens to be the Governor of Maryland
McGINTY Terrific, the Governor is going to play safety
' Don't worry about it
He drills a perfect spiral through the circle
: - ramp at the rear of the stadium gives vehicle access to the interior
The bottom of this ramp is now a maelstrom of activity
The regular Washington Redskins are in a picket line walking in circles
The players are dressed in everything from fur coats to expensive leather jackets and leather pants
Half of them are on cell phones
We can see some of their cars parked haphazardly nearby: BMWs, Porsches, Mercedes, etc
Jerome Lindell, the president of the Players' Association, is being interviewed on camera by a
As president of the Players' Association, what does your presence mean here, Mister Lindell
Very simply, support for these fine players and union men
Washington
is the home of freedom and the collective bargaining agreement
am here to remind all Americans that the owners are no better than the robber barons of the Nineteenth Century
They have blatantly gone out and hired scabs, which is against all principles of our Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and probably even the Emancipation Proclamation
The picketers start shouting and pointing
And here come the Scabskins now
bus slowly makes its way towards the ramp and the picketers
- Shane is sitting in the first seat with Reese Evans (center)
We   them and see, among others, Daniel Bateman (psychotic cop), Clifford Franklin (can't catch a loaf of bread), Jamal and Andre Williams (ex-bodyguards), Lou Pacifico (kicker and bookmaker), and Roland Lamont (ex-high school coach)
start  the bus
We can hear the regular players chanting: Scabskins
Scabskins
Scabskins
He's very excited as he looks out the window at the striking players
Roland Lamont sits next to him
Oh God, there's Eddie Martel
And Wilson Jones
love Wilson Jones
Yo, Wilson
Yo, player
His big face looms right outside the bus window
He looks pissed off and scary
He leans across his seat to Shane
Hey, Lou Pacifico
Shane shakes his hand
Shane Falco
know
lost a ton a money on that Sugar Bowl disaster of yours
Wow
Did you get your butt kicked or what
He's looking out the window when an eeg splats against it
He turns to his brother Andre: You know  don't take that shit
Jamal reaches into his jacket and starts to pull out a nine-millimeter pistol
Andre stops him
Be cool
- nondescript van pulls up and a muscled, deadly-looking guy in handcuffs and jail issue clothes gets out
This is bearded safety  (he-ain't-no-girl)
Maryland state trooper unlocks the cuffs
Earl looks
hungry
- The replacements are getting off the bus as the players chant
Scabskins
Scabskins
When Reese Evans (former Redskin center) gets off the bus, the players go wild
Reese coolly gives them the international suck my dick sign
Clifford gets off behind him
He waves and smiles at the striking players
They throw rotten fruit at Clifford in return
: - , an oldtimer equipment man folds towels
Behind him, we can see helmets, pads, etc
McGinty walks up dragging Shane who is fully dressed in a uniform, including helmet
McGINTY (to Sid) What is this
McGinty points to the intricate face guard on Shane's helmet
It's an exaggerated version of a lineman's cage with so much metal criss-crossing that you can hardly see Shane's face
McGINTY He's a quarterback
How is he supposed to see
He told me he was a linebacker
can see
McGinty holds up three fingers
McGINTY How many fingers
Two
No, wait
Three
: - Andre and Jamal are hitting the blocking sled simultaneously
They drive it
He's now wearing a helmet with a twobar quarterback face guard
He takes a snap and pitches out to running back Roland Lamont
Roland, now wearing a big knee brace, looks sharp as he cuts to the outside
The offensive coordinator is standing with McGinty who is concentrating on the scrimmage
Suddenly, Pilachowski spots someone
His mouth drops open
He's a fourhundred-fifty-pound ex-Sumo wrestler crammed into a Redskin uniform
Fat rolls are visible everywhere
Oh my God
That's disgusting
Lee walks up
McGinty bows and says something in Japanese
Lee bows and answers back in Japanese
Then they shake hands
McGINTY How you doin', Mickey
Not bad, Coach
McGINTY You look great
Why don't you work out at left tackle
You got it
Lee puts on his helmet, pulls his ponytail out the back and rumbles away
Pilachowski is looking at McGinty like he's crazy
You're not serious
McGINTY met Mickey in Hawaii
When he was even bigger
He's a Sumo wrestler
That means he's an expert at pushing people around
That's what pass blocking is, Leo
Defensive coordinator Christopher Banes comes running up in a lather
(to McGinty) got a defensive end who's deaf
(watching Lee walk away) 'll trade you for a tackle who's gonna play in a diaper
How can  coach a deaf man
McGINTY You don't have to
He looks across the field at a big, good- looking kid named   who is in the middle of a pass rushing drill
Murray looks really fast, especially for his size
McGINTY Brian Murray would have gone in the first round five years back if he hadn't been born deaf
first saw him play right here in
for Galludet College
He's a hell of an athlete
You won't have to tell him anything
can't believe it got to be able to communicate with him
McGINTY Then learn to sign
Hey, look at it this way: He'll never get pulled off sides on an audible
McGinty thinks this is funny as shit
He's just done a fivestop drop on a pass play
He's looking down field when he sees something scary
Oh shit
No
He throws the ball away and then is nailed and taken down on his back by Bateman (psychotic cop)
Shane groans and lies there with Bateman on top of him
Hi, 'm Danny
(groaning) Shane
McGinty pulls Bateman up
McGINTY Nice pop, Danny
Thank's, Coach
Danny runs off
What was that
McGINTY Danny Bateman
Ex-cop, ex-Marine, ex-rugby
He's absolutely harmless, if you just play dead
McGinty helps Shane up
McGINTY San Diego used you all wrong
You're not a drop back passer
You're a scrambler
Like you were in college
So, we're gonna roll out
lot
Get used to setting up on the run
You'll live a lot longer
'm very interested in that
: ) is lined up at middle linebacker
When the play starts, he runs headlong into four blockers and takes them all down with him
) beats his man, and turns as Shane, rolling out to his left, puts the ball right on his numbers
Franklin drops it
) On the snap, they pull to lead a sweep
Unfortu-nately, each thinks the play is to their side
They forearm each other and then get into a fight
) boots one from thirty-five yards through the uprights
He smiles, takes out a Marlboro Light and a Bic and fires up
) pulls up, does a button hook and Shane puts the ball in his hands
Franklin drops it
) the Sumo guy, hits the blocking sled and turns it over
) is down on the ground viciously punching another player as two assistants try to pull him off
) is in a crossing pattern in the end zone
Shane puts the ball right in front of him
Unfortunately, it hits him in the hands
: - Shane is sucking down water from the portable water cart when head cheerleader Annabelle Farrell walks up
She's dressed in tight workout clothes
Annabelle Farrell, head Redskinette
Excuse me
'm in charge
Of the Redskinettes
The cheerleaders
Oh yeah, hi
've been watching you
You look good
You look strong
Good quick release
Smart
You read defenses quickly
You're gonna do great
Hey
thanks
saw your second concussion
The one against Cleveland
Pow
You could hear it in the cheap seats
But you completed the pass
That's what counts
guess so
If there's anything you need, let me know
And mean anything, okay
You understand
Shane is really not sure
Sure
understand
They put you up at the Hilton
Yeah
Good
Remember: anything
You got it
Okay
Shane nods
She walks away
We watch her world-class ass move across the gridiron
McGINTY McGinty is holding a ball and talking to his wide receiver
McGINTY because it's a damn waste of all that speed, Clifford told you that when you were in high school
You've got to catch the ball, son
This is the main idea of the passing game
know, Coach,  know
McGINTY Okay
assume that you have touched a woman in a romantic way, have you not
Oh yeah, Coach, sure
In a, you know, romantic way
McGINTY Good
From here on out, you touch this football, all the time
He shoves the football in Clifford's hands
McGINTY just like you touch your girl friends better not see you without this ball
You understand
McGinty starts to walk away
Coach, wait
Can still like touch my girl friends if don't, you know, let go of the ball
McGinty thinks about that
McGINTY Yes, Clifford, if you can manage that, absolutely
: - Andre and Jamal are just about dressed
Andre helps Jamal on with his jacket
Jamal then helps Andre on with his
He's stripped down sitting on a bench
Reporters are trying to interview him
Microphones are in his face and video cameras jockey for position
just glad to be back playing
That's all 've really got to say
But where have you been
What have you been doing to make a living
Well
've been involved lately in the
aquatic business
Mickey is watching Roland unbuckle his big complicated knee brace
(: There should be something slightly medieval about this brace
) You only played one game
Actually, less than two minutes
was a rookie third round pick in '93
We were playing Atlanta in the home opener
Near the end of the first quarter, they sent me in,  took a screen pass over the middle and got hit by both linebackers
Simultaneously
One a side
My knee turned into wet toilet paper
End of career
Can you play on it now
Roland takes out a wrench and starts unscrewing a bolt on his brace
've been teaching high school football for five years
It's not a bad life
'm good at it
There are some days when  actually love it
But for one more shot at this
Shit
'd give it all up
This time, they're gonna have to take me out in a box
() He's standing naked in front of his locker staring with anticipation at a garment bag
Slowly, he unzips the bag revealing a beautiful new suit
He touches the lapels reverently
He's sitting in front of a locker, holding his football, with a shit-assed-eating grin
Someone walks by
got Wilson Boone's locker, man
Do you believe that shit
He drops his ball and quickly picks it up again
He looks around to make sure Coach didn't see him
: - The regular Redskins are out in force, holding signs as they lean on their Beamers and Porsches
Shane pulls up in a battered '89 Honda
When he gets out, he's immediately surrounded by six striking regulars, led by quarterback Eddie Martel and defensive end Wilson Jones
Hey, you can't park there
Look,  don't want any trouble
You don't want any trouble
You're taking my job away, but you don't want any trouble
(to Wilson) He doesn't want any trouble, but he puts this piece of shit in a no parking zone
Shane looks but it's obvious he's parked legally
Okay
'll move it
No, we'll do that for you
Go ahead, Wilson
Move it for him
Wilson motions to another big guy
The two of them proceed to roll the Honda over on its roof
It lands with a crunch
(
) You all put that car back
Everybody turns to see Andre and Jamal walking towards them
Who the fuck are you
We're the people who take care of the quarterback
We're the guards
All the regulars laugh at this
Put the car back
Gently
Kiss my ass
(to Jamal) It's okay
No, it's not
Jamal points to a gorgeous midnight blue Porsche
(to Wilson) That's your ride, ain't it
Before Wilson can even answer, Jamal pulls his
No more Porsche windshield
All the regular Redskins dive for cover
My windshield
You crazy motherfucker
Move his car back
My car
Jamal raises his  again
No Porsche driver's side window
No
Stop
He turns to his cowering teammates
Come on, help me, god damn it
The guys quickly pick up the Honda and put it right side up
(to Jamal) You are gonna pay for this
No 'm not
And quit messing with my man here
That includes his ride
Jamal spins the nine and holsters it
Andre and Jamal get on either side of Shane
They look at each other and then quickly switch sides
Let's go to practice, Shane
Let's do that
Shane smiles at his guards, smiles at the still-shocked Redskins, and they move out
: - Shane, dressed in pads and pants, opens the door and walks in
During the opening and closing of the door we hear: (
) so if anyone does have any firearms, we need to turn those in as soon as possible, no questions asked
Shane stands in front of the urinal and goes through the painstaking process of locating his dick
First he wrestles open his football pants and then has to deal with the cup, etc
Next to him, at another urinal, is , a big, serious bornagain tackle
As he pisses, Walter has his Bible propped open behind the flush handle so he won't miss a minute of scripture
Praise the Lord, Shane
Yeah
Sure
Walt Cochran
Offensive tackle
Shane nods
Walter pees for a beat
Shane, will you witness with me
Will  what
Will you witness with me
For this upcoming practice
Now
By now Shane is pissing too
Praise the Lord for giving us a way to eliminate, Shane
Why not talk to Him in the midst of performing his gift
Walter takes his hand off his whizzing member and holds it out to Shane
Shane looks at Walter's hand for a long time, but finally, he removes his own guiding hand and clasps Walter's hand tentatively
They continue pissing as they hold hands
Heavenly Father, thank you for allowing us to pee the poisons from our systems
Please help us in today's practice to be strong and
: McGINTY'  - barbecue is in progress for the new Washington Redskins at the beautiful home of Coach McGinty
The huge back yard features a pool and a catered buffet/barbecue
Andre and Jamal are loading down their plates
Mickey Lee is gnawing on a two-foot slab of ribs
Lou Pacifico has a little three card monty going at a picnic table
Coach    McGinty is holding up a beautiful baby girl    to the admiring players
He kisses the baby    and then hands the child to his gorgeous young    wife
Augustine is pushing Mister    'Neil in a wheelchair
They pass the     outside bar and 'Neil suddenly lunges for    a bottle of tequila
Augustine has to     rip it out of his hands
Coach Banes and Earl Wilkinson (criminal) are talking to a distinguished-looking big man in his fifties
This is a Where did you play, Judge
Wait
Do call you judge
Your Honor, or Judge is fine
played at Harvard
But  played in the days when you went both ways
Offense and defense
When players were really tough
(to Wilkinson) And where did you play college ball
'm sorry, what was your name again
Wilkinson is smiling but he looks dangerous
Smith
Ray Smith played at a junior college nobody ever heard of
What position did you play on defense, Judge
Middle linebacker
Yeah, big fellow like you, that's what would have guessed
It was a different game in those days
Raw
Powerful
No tricks, like today
You know, maybe you can show me some of your technique, Your Honor
Maybe you can show me some of that toughness
'd be glad to
There's an evil glint in Wilkinson's eye
McGINTY'  - Shane is standing alone in a large hallway looking at an enormous trophy case stuffed with the spoils of football
(
) You would think he's done enough
Shane turns and sees her
She's as fetching as ever
McGinty,  mean
was kind of thinking the same thing
My theory is he came out of retirement to see if he could win with losers
(pause) Oh, shit
'm sorry
didn't mean
(interrupting) Hey, it's okay
've been called worse
Like    after that Sugar Bowl    game
guess you could    survive anything after    that
Shane has to actually smile at this
Sometimes  feel like everybody in the world saw that game
Like could go to India and some little guy would run up to me and say, 'Boy, did you suck in the '92 Sugar Bowl
' Annabelle laughs
So, how come you're such a fan
My dad
He's a huge Redskin fan
For years
He's in his twenty-ninth year at the Senate Office Building
As a guard, not a senator
The only thing that keeps him going he says, is me and the Redskins
That's where  get it
My fan-ness
(suddenly) Are you scared
Shane is totally taken off guard by this woman
Scared
Well
yes
Absolutely
It's okay
Anybody would be
But you're good
And you'll do good
Well, thank you
Look, gotta study the play book tonight
So
'll see you
Break a leg tomorrow
What
It's    from the theater
For    opening night
You say    the worst thing that    can happen
And it won't
Break a leg
Shane waves uncertainly and walks away
McGINTY'   - The Judge (now with his jacket off) and Wilkinson are lined up across from each other in a three-point stance in something called a man maker drill
The entire team forms two lanes on either side of them, as they face off
The idea is to knock the other guy down and get by him
Alright, this is how we used to stop a running back
can't wait
Someone says hut
And Wilkinson slams into the Republican 16th Circuit Court Judge and knocks him head over heels
The Judge lands on his back, wham
He's out cold
Wilkinson slaps hands with Andre and Jamal
Oooh
got me a judge
Man, that felt good
: - It's another beautiful fall afternoon and cars are entering the stadium parking lot
At one of the entrances, the striking Redskins are picketing
Jerome Lindell ( Players President) is still marching with them
little boy stops one of the Redskins and asks for an autograph on a program
The player gives it to him and the kid walks away
Lindell runs after the kid, grabs the program and rips off the page the player signed
(to kid) Don't be asking    for no autographs from    the real players and    then go in and watch    the scabs
The kid retreats quickly
Lindell rips up the page
(to the player) That is not the message we want to send our children
: - It's very quiet
Shane sits in pads and no jersey, methodically squeezing a football
Reese Evans, his center, stops by
You okay
Shane nods and gives a nauseous-looking smile
Remember to nod your head on the snap
(out of it) Nod my head
For    when Murray's in
The    deaf kid
Hello
He    needs to look at you on    the snap
Shane nods that he understands but he goes back to staring at a wall
Andre and Jamal sit facing each other
Andre throws a vicious forearm at Jamal's head but Jamal catches it
They both nod in approval
Lou Pacifico smokes and stares
Bateman is leaning against a wall, fully dressed, helmet on
He's staring into space and smiling to himself
He looks terrifying
Earl Wilkinson (the criminal) is polishing a beautiful pair of new alligator shoes
Clifford Franklin looks at himself in the mirror as he ceremoniously puts on his helmet
Walter Cochran is reading his Bible in front of his locker, which features a picture of Jesus and a cross
Mickey Lee (ex-sumo) is sitting in front of a bowl of hard boiled eggs
He's methodically popping them into his mouth
He eats four as we watch
Coach Pilachowski comes up to Lee and watches him eat
What are you, crazy
Nobody eats right before a game
always ate before a big match
need the bulk
Like a hole in the head he needs the bulk
Coach McGinty comes strolling through the locker room, the picture of calm
He walks by defensive end/tight end Brian Murray and signs to him to have a good game
Murray signs back, "Thanks, Coach
" Cochran spots McGinty and puts down his Bible
Coach McGinty, 'd like to lead the team in the pregame prayer
McGINTY No
No praying
That's the problem with professional sports today: too much god damn praying
Five hundred dollar fine to the first man  hear praying
McGinty turns and bums an egg from Mickey and walks to the middle of the locker room
He eats the egg as he turns slowly and takes in his players
McGINTY lot of people are waiting for you to fall on your asses today
And guess what
You're going to
But  don't give a shit if you look funny out there
Or if you miss a block, or drop a pass, or trip over your own dick
This is professional
And the difference between professional and amateur, between playing for the Washington Redskins and Michigan State is simply
money
You are being paid to win
Not just to play
Not just to learn how to be good sports
Not for the alumni
You are being paid to win don't care how the fuck you do it
But 'm demanding it
Because those guys whose place you're taking have forgotten that simple fact
So, go win it
He walks away
The players get up and start moving
: - We're   an enormous,    plastic blow-up Washington Redskin helmet that    bobs on the ground in front of the exit to    the field
The idea is, the players will    run into and then out of the helmet as they    are introduced
Annabelle and her fellow twenty cheerleaders are lined up on either side of the bobbing helmet, waiting for the players
They are in their booth, vamping
Pretty bold move by New England Patriot owner Victor Kiam, who went out and bought an entire semi-pro team once the strike happened
() (') Redskin management, on the other hand, is going with a bunch of unknowns
Their public relations people don't even have bios yet on most of their players, although we'll see one or two familiar faces out there today
Like Shane Falco, the enormously talented college quarterback from Ohio State, who never fulfilled his potential in the pro's
(to Madden) Wow, remember that Sugar Bowl Falco quarterbacked when Florida State creamed them
Oh, yeah, they were absolutely decimated
Dusted
And if 'm not mistaken, Falco set a record in that game for Bowl interceptions
Anyway, for some of these players this is another shot; a last shot, probably, for a guy like Falco
: - Shane is looking out at the field through the blow-up helmet
He looks scared
Suddenly, a  goes off with a stomach- resounding
Shane jumps
(
) Ladies and gentlemen, your Washington Redskins
sparse crowd is in attendance, mostly diehard fans like Todd, Rod and Bob, who are decked out in burgundy and gold
They look drunk already as they cheer like mad
(
) Here's the starting defense today
Bateman is first in line
He looks like a racehorse on cocaine
(
) At middle linebacker, number 56, Daniel Bateman
Bateman takes off at a dead run out of the tunnel and into the helmet
It hits a wire stretched across the ground inside the helmet
He trips big-time into the side of the helmet
He bounces (it's inflated, remember
) to the other side, bounces again and is shot out of the front of it like a cannon ball
Bateman bounces out of the helmet and takes out the first six cheerleaders
Girls fly left and right
One girl is knocked out of her shoes
Madden covers his face
Summerall looks pained
Oh, my
Even the hardcore Todd, Rob and Bob can hardly look at the carnage
contingent of strike players like Eddie Martel and Wilson Jones huddle in the parking lot
They are laughing their asses off as they watch on a personal
Cheerleaders are down and screaming in pain
Annabelle is running from girl to girl, doing triage
He's sheepishly standing to one side as trainers come out to assist
Jamal and Shane are examining the trip wire
Obviously, they were sabotaged
Bastards
(
) And now
uh, the rest of the Washington Redskins
The rest of the team walks unceremoniously out of the helmet and onto the field
: - The Patriot kicker puts one in the end zone for a touchback
The ball is placed on the twenty as Shane and the offense walk out onto the field
Shane walks slowly toward the huddle that's forming
Andre and Mickey Lee are arguing
That's where  stand
No it's not
Come on, man, that's my spot in the huddle
As he walks, we hear McGinty's voice in Shane's helmet
Yes, they do it by one-way helmet radio so the filtered voice you hear is McGinty, speaking into his headset mike
McGINTY (
) All right, son, nice and easy now
Let's run our ten planned plays, get a feel for the land
Shane walks into the huddle and chaos
Fat fucking nip
You don't know shit
What did you call me
You heard me, you tub a rice shit
Hold on, what's the problem here
Andre and Lee ignore Shane and start pushing each other
'm gonna kick your black ass
You ain't kickin' jack shit
Now Jamal gets involved as Shane tries to get between them
(to Lee) Don't be messing with my brother
Hey, hold on
He's watching the play clock and when it gets to zero he pulls his penalty flag and throws it
Delay of game
Five yards
Lee suddenly punches Andre through his face guard
Andre knocks into Shane and spins him around
Jamal then goes to punch Lee, he misses and nails Shane in the back of the helmet
Shane goes down hard
They look confused
don't know
Something seems to be going on in the huddle
It looks like
yes, Shane Falco is on his back
They haven't run a play yet but Falco is down
This is not a good sign
Trainers race out to Shane, who is lying face up with the huddle standing over him
(clearing the cobwebs) What happened
Am hurt already
Shane sits up
Suddenly, he remembers what happened
God damn it
am the quarterback
am the only one supposed to talk in the huddle
Yeah, but he took my place
don't give a shit
Shane gets to his feet
Huddle up
Everybody leans in
If you've got something to say, raise your hand
Is that understood
Lee raises his hand
Shane grits his teeth and nods
Suppose like, you don't feel good
Or you're hurt or something like that
Then what
Then you tell me before the huddle starts
Okay, listen up: 68 blue east storm toss
On two
Jamal raises his hand
What
That's to the right
right
No, it's to the left
It's to the right
You better be quiet, Shane, they'll hear you
We do hear a
penalty flag flies by
Delay of game
Five yards
Shane throws ups his hands
McGINTY He's talking into his mike
McGINTY What the hell is going on
Well, Pat, so far the Redskins have minus ten yards offensively
' He's in bed sucking oxygen watching the game
Augustine sits with him
' Turn it off
This is going to kill me
It breaks this time and everyone runs to the line of scrimmage
Blue 68
Blue 68
Hut
Hut
On the snap, Shane turns to head off to Lamont but instead runs right into Jamal who knocks him down
Shane looks up at Jamal
Have you suddenly decided you don't like me, Jamal
Oh
You said it was to the right, didn't you
Shane leans in
Okay
Let's try something simple
18 red left slot open
(to Jamal) That's to the left
They break and Shane lines up over his center
Eighteen red
Eighteen red
Hut
Hut
On the snap, Shane hands to Lamont who sweeps left, cuts inside and picks up eight yards
Shane is ecstatic
Yeah
And then a penalty flag flies by
Holding
Number 78
Shane looks at Jamal who is trying desperately to hide his number
Shane leans in with the next play
Cochran, playing right tackle, can't resist
You see
We should have prayed
Shut up
Pass
22 Solo right slot ',' stick
On one
They break and come to the line of scrimmage
Twenty-two green
Hut
Shane does a play action fake to Lamont and then turns downfield
Wham
He's buried by three defenders
The ball squirts loose and the Patriots recover
He's livid on the sidelines
As his offensive line comes off he rants at them
Shane hobbles off past: The defense rushing onto the field led by Bateman
(
) Washington comes up a minus fourteen yards on their first possession
They break their huddle and come to the line of scrimmage
Bateman is snorting fire
Earl Wilkinson (with  on the back of his jersey) patrols the secondary and calls out the formation
Wide right
You got wide right
Check on the wing
The   sets up over center
Blue fourteen
Bam
Bateman runs offside and flattens the quarterback
Penalty flags fly everywhere
Defensive Coordinator Banes rolls his eyes
The Ref moves the ball five yards and gives the offside sign
They come out of the huddle again
Green eighty-seven
Pow
Bateman dives offside again and forearms the Quarterback, knocking him on his back
Flags fly again
One Patriot lineman makes the mistake of pushing Bateman
Bateman literally jumps on his head
More flags fly
Banes is screaming something unintelligible at Bateman
It's marched downfield by the Ref, this time fifteen yards
this we hear: (
) think the Redskins just set a record for penalties in the first three minutes
We're waiting for the stats on that
Here come the Patriots again
: ) rolls to his right but the blitz    is on and he reverses and rolls left
He's finally cornered and has to dump    the ball off
The pass is incomplete and     he's knocked on his ass
) fakes to Lamont and rolls again
He fires a bullet to Franklin on a    down and out
Clifford actually catches     the ball, then bobbles it and in trying to    get possession again, hands the ball    to the defender
The defender can't believe it for a beat and then he streaks down the sideline and scores
)    McGINTY just shakes his head
)    , scream in pain
Rod pours his own beer over his own head
)    ' looks disgusted as he watches with Augustine
) grabs the opposing running backs' face mask and spins him around and around
Flags fly everywhere
) is on the run again looking for a receiver
He finally throws the ball
right into the hands of the opposing safety
Shane dives for the guy and misses
The safety scores
) is trying desperately to get the crowd into the game by jumping up and down and waving her pom poms
Five guys right in front of her get up from their seats, take all their stuff and leave
: -    - shows the Patriots up 17 to 0
He's rolling in the back field again looking for a receiver
' Nothing but meat coming at him
Shane panics and tosses the ball out of bounds
Shane looks at McGinty on the sidelines
We hear McGinty's voice
McGINTY (
) You had Lamont open in the flat
Shane puts his head down like he knows it
McGINTY (
) Come on, now, son
Pick up your pace on the roll
See the big picture
Pump and fake, pump and fake
Everyone is dirty, sweating bullets and breathing very hard
Shane leans into the huddle
Lee is raising his hand
What
don't feel good
And with that he promptly vomits sixteen eggs
Oh, God
Oooooh
Man, that's ripe
Everyone is reacting
Some players gag
Shane, we got to move
Okay
On the count of three
Everyone more left
Hut
Hut
Hut
Eleven bentover guys move in unison with tiny steps to their left
' The guy watches the huddle moving
What the fuck is this
Summerall has his binoculars on the moving huddle
John, how many years have we been calling games together
Seventeen,  think
Pat just hands John the binoculars
Shane calls the play as they continue to move as one
brown right, west 19 lead
That's you, Mickey
Puke on him if you have to
The huddle stops and they break for the line of scrimmage
He lines up face to face with the Patriots' defensive end
Lee breathes in the guy's face and the Patriot gags
(
) Hut
Lee runs right over the guy
He's quickly followed by Lamont with the ball
Lamont runs for eighteen yards and a first down
He's waving for a substitute as he weaves off the field
(
) Very nice off tackle run by Lamont
Execution was letter perfect
(
) That puts the Redskins in field goal range
And here comes Pacifico to see if he can get them on the board before the half ends
He flicks his smoke away as he runs out onto the field
(,  ) guy sitting at the bar turns his head quickly to the televised game when he hears Pacifico's name
This is the same mafioso type who saw Lou kick the ball that knocked the godfather's hat off
Remember
-   - He crouches down and waits for the snap from Evans
Pacifico lines himself up
(
) This will be a forty- five yarder
That's a tough distance for your first
field goal try
Hut
It's a perfect snap
Shane spots it, Pacifico belts it
And it goes through for three
, They begin immediately singing "Hail to the Redskins," a march always sung after a score
They and the sparse crowd in the stadium know and sing every word
He gets high fives all around
Then Bateman runs up and in his ecstasy, slaps Pacifico in the head
Pacifico goes down, knocked out cold
Led by Annabelle, the girls are doing a stirring finale to "Hail to the Redskins
" : -  (-) Everyone is lying on the floor
Shane has ice bags on his head, shoulder, elbow and both knees
Pacifico is getting smelling salts from a trainer as Bateman hovers nearby waiting to apologize
Mickey Lee is chewing ice
Cochran is reading his Bible
McGinty walks in and bends down to Shane
McGINTY (quietly) You got to look for Murray over the middle
You got to trust me on this: he's a big, tough kid with good hands
We can't put three plays together without a penalty, a fumble of a fight
McGINTY You still got a whole half left
You're a thoroughbred out there running against a bunch a nags
You can pick these fuckers apart
Shane smiles through his pain
You're good
You're really good
: - The Patriots have the ball
Their Quarterback drops back for a pass and throws it
Earl is covering the intended receiver
He deftly steps in front of the guy, and makes a diving catch
Another terrific interception by Smith
That's his second
Madden starts shuffling through pages
Yeah, this guy is a player
He finds the paper he's looking for
According to the Redskins, Ray Smith
is
that's weird
No college given, no high school given
It just says he's been a resident of the state of Maryland for the last four years and five months
Likes to embroider
: - Shane is walking toward the huddle
In his ear, he hears: McGINTY (
) Half your job is getting that huddle in the right mindset
Use your imagination, Shane
Shane stops short of the huddle
Everyone is looking at him
There is a beat and then Shane steps in
Okay, let's all take a few seconds to think about what we were doing for a living
just last week
Shane looks around the huddle
Everybody looks pained and/or depressed
Good
Let's kick ass
Red right pass 15 x hook
They break the huddle and Shane sets up over Evans
He glances over at Brian Murray
Murray is lined up in a three point stance at tight end
But his head is turned and he's looking directly at Shane
Red fifteen
Red fifteen
Hut
Shane nods on the snap
The front five, in the persons of Andre, Jamal, Reese, Mickey Lee and Cochran, hit out and simultaneously knock their men on their backs
Shane, with plenty of time, hits Murray over the middle for twelve yards
Shane looks over at the sidelines
McGinty is smiling
) is under pressure but he rolls smoothly and rockets the ball downfield
Murray pulls it in for fifteen yards
) rolls left off the shotgun, fights off a cornerback and throws back across field, complete to Lamont coming out of the backfield
) is calling for a fair catch on a punt
He catches the ball but Bateman flies and decks him
Flags fly
) are blocking side by side, pushing their men back as Lamont squeezes through with the ball
) is pass blocking like the all pro that he is
He knocks his man flat and then doubles up on Cochran's man
) is pursuing a running back
He knocks down an official and runs right over him
Then he gets his hands on the running back and pushes him out of bounds and then knocks over a photographer
) pumps once and then drills a twenty yard spiral
Clifford Franklin beats his man and dives for the ball
He bobbles it, and then squeezes it to his stomach as he hits the ground
: - Madden uses his pen on the screen to try to explain a play
There are already lines everywhere
(
) began with a Redskin end around, but Cochran, the pulling tackle ran into Falco's pitchout
see
() (
) (') Right here, it bounced off his helmet
Then it was kicked by Landon and then Hayes touched it,  think, and then Green got a hand on it, and then Bellinski recovered it and then he lost it, and finally the ball took a crazy bounce right back into Falco's hands, look at his face here
He's as surprised as anybody
Falco then ran it back to just about the original line of scrimmage, executed the same play -- an end around to Murray -- and the Skins score
Welcome to Strike Football
Boom
He boots the extra point
Scoreboard:    Patriots 17, Redskins 10
: - We're on the clock which shows one minute ten seconds left in the fourth quarter
It breaks and comes to the line of scrimmage
Shane drops into the shotgun
Hut, hut
Shane rolls left but there's a blitz
The cornerback is almost on him when Shane shifts and rolls the other way
He's wide open five yards from the goal line
They're breathing down his back
' He sees Franklin and cocks his arm
Suddenly, opposing jerseys are everywhere
Shane dumps the ball
He's immediately decked by a defensive end
We watch the flight of it in
We it right  the hands of
a New England Patriot defensive back
He's down and not moving
, They scream in despair
She falls to her knees in pain
(
) Falco is intercepted
That's too bad
(
) Yeah, and it looks like he's hurt, too
He was really starting to put it together here in the fourth quarter
Only forty-eight seconds now left on the clock
He's helped off the field and onto the bench
McGINTY He grabs Bateman before he can run out onto the field
McGINTY Danny
(very slowly) Get me the ball
The ball
Okay, Coach
He runs out onto the field
They line up
Hut, hut, hut
The quarterback hands off to the running back right up the middle in a typical "run out the clock" play
Bateman comes out of nowhere, decks the runner and literally rips the ball out of his hands as he goes down
They go wild
She does a cartwheel
McGINTY He's leaning over a groggy Shane on the bench
McGINTY Don't shake your head at me
You are going back in there
You are gonna run the same god damn play, you are gonna throw the ball to Franklin again and this time, he's gonna score
can't
McGinty grabs some smelling salts from a hovering trainer
He shoves them under Shane's nose
Shane is suddenly very awake
McGINTY You are the only one in this entire stadium who can do it
Do you understand me
You can do something no one else can do
So, start right here
Start living your destiny
Or give it up for good
Right here
Right now
Shane stares at him
Then he stands up, wobbles and puts on his helmet
They're all turned and watching as Shane makes his way slowly out onto the field
Annabelle watches him closely
(
) Here comes Falco with eighteen seconds left on the clock
(
) 'm surprised to see him again after that shot he took from Bellinski
It breaks and Shane stands over Evans and looks out at the defense
Nasty-looking linebackers and cornerbacks stare at him
22 green
His voice cracks and several defensive players openly laugh at him
Shane gets an idea
Check
Black 43
Black 43
He's down in a three-point stance facing a defender
He whispers to Reese: What's that mean
(whispering back) He's changing the play
Listen
Black 43
(
) It's a long count
Falco could be calling an audible
He shifts position in the backfield
(to Shane) Is this right
(shaking his head) Black 43 left
Lamont shifts again
Clifford goes in motion from his flanker position but then changes his mind and goes back the other way
Lamont and Clifford then bump into each other
They are totally confused now as they try to adjust to the equally confused Redskins
McGINTY He looks extremely pissed
Hut
Hut
He turns to hand the ball off to Lamont but Lamont is not there
Shane turns the other way and sees Lamont just standing there looking at him
Shane runs over to him and hands him the ball
Meanwhile, the Patriot defense is going the other direction
Lamont takes off
One cornerback is not taken in
The guy dives for Lamont's legs
We hear a  as the cornerback's  hits Lamont's industrial
The guy bounces off and Lamont trots into the end zone
(
) Lamont scores
(
) Whoa
Falco calls an audible at the line of scrimmage and Lamont takes it in
Shane, meanwhile, is looking at McGinty on the sidelines
McGINTY (
) (in Shane's helmet) guess you saw something  didn't
Shane nods vigorously
McGINTY (
) Don't try to bullshit me, pal
You didn't want it
Winners always want the ball with the game on the line
You know that
Shane looks down
McGINTY (
) Alright
The play is
waggle right, drag hook
You understand
Shane nods
' He looks ten years younger as he and Augustine watch
(
) With eight seconds remaining, Pacifico will try the extra point that will send this game into overtime
(
) This turned out to be one hell of a contest, Pat
He sets up for the kick
He waits for the snap
He sets up at his flanker position
Hut
Shane catches the snap and pitches the ball out to Murray from his holding position
(
) It's a fake
The Patriot right defensive end breaks through and reaches for Murray
The only person in his way is Shane, still kneeling in the holding position
Shane screams as the huge lineman trips over him and then falls on him
Murray sweeps around the right side and scores untouched
Redskins win
Everybody goes nuts
' He pounds on Augustine
, They pound on each other
Hail to the Redskins is deafening
McGINTY He just smiles
He's still under the defensive end
Reese Evans pulls the guy off and bends down to Shane
We won, Shane
We won
Shane manages a painful smile
: -  - It's packed with players, friends and assorted groupies
Pacifico is smoking and talking non-stop to a group who hang on his every word
Andre is already passed out at a booth
Jamal supports one side of Andre so he doesn't fall over
Murray is signing to several fans who sign back
Clifford Franklin signs autographs
Earl Wilkinson, dressed to the nines, is dancing close and slow with a gorgeous woman
Shane is at the bar and he's not in good shape
He's got cuts and bruises visible and every time he moves he grimaces
The martinis are starting to help, however
He's talking to a stunning
ultimately, it's a pain thing, you know
mean, it's Darwinian, the survival of the numbest
Whoever can take the pain most, gets the largest contract
It's sick
He finishes his martini and throws the olive over his shoulder
Exactly
Let me buy you another
She signals to the bartender
don't know how you do it
hate pain
Pain is a no no as far as 'm concerned
Shane gets his new drink, takes a sip and visibly slumps at the bar
(slurring) 'm glad that you are concerned
Hey, are you    alright
'll take you    up to your room, if    you like
Shane looks at her closely
would like
:: - Shane weaves down the hallway with the Woman In Red
They stop at a door
Here's home
Shane fumbles for a key
Another stunning-looking woman suddenly appears from down the hall
This is the friend of mine is going to join us, okay
Hi
Ready to party
She checks the hallway, takes the key from Shane and sticks it in the lock
(looking at both women) Oooooh
Bookends
And you're the book, baby
Suddenly, Annabelle Farrell appears in the hallway
(to the girls) Go away
Both of you
Fuck off
Crack
Annabelle punches her in the nose with a straight right hand
The girl bounces off the wall
(to Annabelle) These are my guests
(now bleeding) You crazy bitch
Both girls take off
Why did you do that
Annabelle opens the door
You were about to be rolled
(as he enters) That's what  was hoping
- Annabelle is pulling the bed down as Shane falls into a chair
They work the bar downstairs looking for drunk Redskins
Shane looks embarrassed
guess they found one
Don't feel so bad
It's a rookie mistake
She turns and sees that he's already passed out
She looks at him not unkindly
Then she unbuckles his belt and starts pulling his pants off
: -   '    - as he opens his eyes
He rolls over and screams in pain
She's wearing nothing but a Redskins' - shirt
She quickly bends over him
Here
Take this
(groaning) What is it
It's for the pain
Take it
It's only a little bit illegal
Shane takes it and swigs a glass of water
Oh, God
've got to go to the bathroom
It's far away, isn't it
'll help
We'll just take our time
She helps him get out of bed
When he stands, he screams again
Kidneys
Oh, man
My hair hurts
You took a hell of a beating
The martinis didn't help, either
She walks him to the bathroom like an old man
He shuffles in and closes the door
Don't be afraid if you've got blood in your urine
That's normal
(
) Did you undress me
Yes
(
) And you
slept here with me
Yes
(
) Did we
Are you kidding
You were catatonic
He appears again at the door
No blood
Good
Back to bed
He leans on her as she walks him back
He gets into bed with a moan
May  ask you a personal question
She nods
Do you do this for all Redskin quarterbacks
Of course not
Then why me
Annabelle takes her time answering
don't know
guess can't resist a man who can take a hit
can't take a hit
Annabelle cradles his head
Shhh
It's all in your head
Now, get some sleep
: - Annabelle walks up to Shane's door with a stack of newspapers
She enters
- The bathroom door is closed
Annabelle talks to him anyway
You're the golden boy in the press this morning
She reads a headline
'Falco scores big
' (to herself) Well
not really
(still reading) Hey, a lot of the regular players are starting to cross the picket line
(
) Redskins
It doesn't say
Shane comes out of the bathroom dressed and ready to go
He's still moving slowly and in great pain
Where are you going
McGinty called a dinner meeting with the whole team
Shane tries to put on his coat, but he's so sore he can't
Annabelle helps him
Thank you
Thanks for
everything
You saved my life
No
Probably just your wallet and your watch
And that pill, that sure worked
You're basic double Vicodin
But be careful: It's habit- forming
The best stuff always is
There's another awkward silence
Well
Ice both knees and that shoulder before bed
: '  - Clifford, still carrying his football, comes out of his apartment in a third floor walk- up
He's wearing his Redskins jacket
As he turns around from locking his door, he stops dead in his tracks
All of Clifford's neighbors, all the way down both halls, are standing in front of their doors
They all start applauding
Clifford smiles from ear to ear

Suddenly, one cab, then two, then four  on their
Cabbies hop out to open their doors for the brothers

He has a line of ten people who are paying five bucks for an autographed picture of himself that he hands out from a huge stack
: -  - We see Shane walk in the door
- The Scabskins are all being served dinner in a private room
Mickey Lee is served a steak the size of a briefcase
Andre and Jamal get lobsters big enough to be pets
Ed 'Neil is being fed pureed asparagus by Augustine
When Augustine drops the napkin and bends over, 'Neil whispers urgently to Cochran who is enjoying a steak: ' 'll give you 50 thousand dollars for a bite of that steak
McGinty taps his glass at the head of the table and stands
McGINTY Alright, listen up: There have been a lot of rumors about the regular players crossing the picket lines
They are not rumors
Many union players have now seen the error of their ways and are coming back in droves
Apparently, they have been struck with the realization that it is a blessing to be playing professional football
There is dead silence in the room
Everybody thinks it's over
McGINTY But they had their chance
Now it's your turn
Mister 'Neil and  have agreed to ban all striking players and to continue to go with you guys
There's a beat and then everyone breaks into cheers
Suddenly, the door flies open and a and a cameraman step in and start filming
The Reporter shoves a microphone at McGinty
Coach, what will be your strategy against New York this Sunday
Out in the restaurant, patrons see the players and a few break into "Hail to the Redskins
" Suddenly, the whole restaurant starts singing
Shane looks embarrassed
Pacifico stands up on his seat, and conducts the singing
Andre and Jamal hold their lobsters in the air and make them dance to the song
: '  - We're  a  showing Pacifico conducting and the entire restaurant singing
Eddie Martel (Redskin quarterback) is watching the scene at home on the late local news
(
) The Palm patrons showed an impromptu appreciation tonight for the new Washington Redskins
They may be unknowns and far from superstars, but it sure looks like they have charmed the fans
Martel looks very angry
: '  - Shane answers his door
Annabelle is standing there
Hi
Come in
No
She gives him a bottle of pills
We don't travel with the team
So, here's Tylenol with codeine, regular Vicodins, the magic bullet one that gave you before, and a couple of Darvons if you actually break something
Pop 'em in the ambulance
Wow
Thanks
'll be watching on
The Giants got back three of their four defensive linemen
Plus their middle linebacker
Yeah
know
What can  say
Go from the shotgun and scramble your ass off
Shane smiles at her
She suddenly grabs him and they kiss big- time
Then she breaks and walks quickly away
Shane doesn't know what to make of this
: ( ) - We're   the field in the middle of a play
Shane is running away from three New York Giant defensive linemen
Shane is not even looking for a receiver
He's looking to save his life
Finally, he's caught by a six-foot-five, two hundred and seventy pound defensive end named , who throws him down and lands on top of him
Oooof
(in Shane's ear) Hello, again
-     - They're back in their booth calling the game
That's all-pro Hank Morris's third sack, his second here in the fourth quarter and the sixth of the day for the Giants
Falco is gonna be sore tonight
If he can stay alive that long
Ten-three New York in what has turned out to be an incredible defensive duel
- Jerome Lindell is once again outside the stadium, picketing with a smaller group of players
He does his interview on camera, standing in front of a huge semi-truck
And a big, overweight truck driver stands next to him
because it's about brothers, and brotherhood and standing together against the oppressors
That's why  am so grateful to our Teamster brothers who have joined us here today in New York to protest the greed squad known as the
owners
The truck driver suddenly pumps his arm and a It's deafening but Lindell smiles through it all
- Shane is rolling out with Morris on his heels again
He can't find anyone open and runs out of bounds
Everybody is breathing hard, beat-up and exhausted
Shane leans in
(to Reese Evans) You got to double up on Morris
He's too far outside for me to get to him
(to Cochran) Bring him down and sit on him
He's huge
He's been beating the crap out of me all day
feel like a rag doll out here
'll help this time
Okay
Spread left '' Right, roll right Half Back Sail
On two
They break
Shane sets up in the shotgun
Red, fifteen
Hut, hut
On the snap, Lee and Cochran double-team Morris
Morris slaps Cochran away like, well, a rag doll, and then confronts the Sumo master
He bumps stomachs with Lee
Lee flies through the air and lands on his ass
He spots his receiver, he cocks his arm and wham
Morris decks him
And, of course, lands on him
Oooof
(to Shane) It's just me, fuck- face
In order to get up, Morris puts one huge hand on Shane's helmet and pushes himself up
Shane moans as his face guard digs a four- inch hole in the turf
McGINTY He's talking into his mike
McGINTY You want a time-out
That looks like it hurt
Shane gets up
He's got a huge piece of turf stuck in his face guard so that for a beat, we can't even see him
Then he pulls out the dirt and grass, and we see Shane really pissed off for the first time
Huddle up
Everyone gathers around
Same thing
Except
(to Lee and Cochran) Let him in
Don't touch him
What
Shane
Shut up
Let him through
On two
They break the huddle
Shane goes into a shotgun
Red fifteen
Hut
Hut
Shane does a three-step drop from the shotgun
Cochran and Lee hit out on either side of Morris, giving him a clear shot at Shane
Morris comes hard and fast
Shane looks downfield, winds up, turns and fires the ball at Morris's head
The ball goes like a bullet for five feet and then sticks like a dart in Morris's face guard
For a moment, Morris is blinded
And Shane is dumbfounded
Then Morris starts to wrestle the ball out of his mask
Get him
Andre and Jamal grab onto Morris who starts stumbling down field with the ball still stuck in his helmet
(
) Morris intercepts
Wait
The ball is stuck in his face
But Morris won't go down
He's still trying to pry the ball loose as he throws off Jamal
Then he shakes off Andre
He's in   in midair, diving towards Morris
' It's absolutely  (he's deaf, remember
) as he soars towards Morris's head, helmet and ball
Wham
Murray's full body weight hits Morris in the helmet, which flies off and rolls across the field with the ball still stuck in it
, we suddenly hear the hit and the crowd roar
Morris goes down like a building with Murray buried in his throat
(
) Todd, Rod and Bob are destroying Todd's den in reaction to the hit
Annabelle is screaming "Whoa
" to that hit
' They're watching
' Now that's a hit
It's in the very chubby hands of Mickey Lee, who is rumbling downfield with the fumble/helmet recovery
New York players have been slow to pick this up because they, too, have been admiring the lick that Murray put on Morris
Suddenly, the whole team is chasing Lee
They catch him pretty easily at the twenty, but Lee represents a lot of weight
Lee staggers across the ten, shaking players off left and right
One defensive halfback sacrifices himself and throws himself at Lee's feet
Lee trips over the guy, gains his footing again, walks on the guy (who screams in agony) and falls into the end zone carrying three players with him
John is beside himself
Lee scores
Lee scores
Lee scores love to see a fat guy score
He gets up in jubilation, spikes the ball/helmet combination, and runs through the back of the end zone
But he doesn't stop
He's aiming for a low wall that separates the first row of fans from the field
They see Mickey rumbling at them and they all get the picture at the same time
They scream
He launches himself into the stands in ecstasy
Crunch
Lee lands on all four of them
It's hiked into Shane's hands and Pacifico boots the extra point
"Giants 10 -- Redskins 10 : 58 seconds
" Murray and Lee are getting congratulations from everyone
(to Murray) What a hit
(slower) What a hit
Murray nods that he understands
(to Murray) 'm proud of you, kid
Jamal and Andre are hugging Lee
In the b
g
, we can see paramedics lifting one of Lee's four fans onto a stretcher
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one
You think that's worth a shoe deal
McGinty walks into the middle of it
McGINTY Stop with the lovefest
Let's get the goddamn ball back and win this thing
: - We're   Bateman as he lines up for the kick-off
Everybody in the stadium knows that an on-side kick is coming
Bateman is standing in the hot spot for recovering the ball
Shane and everyone with decent hands is on the field
Pacifico lines it up and boots it ten yards
The ball takes a crazy hop, hits a Giant, and ricochets off him
Bateman runs over two guys and grabs the ball on the bounce
He's got it
But Bateman doesn't go down
He turns and starts running across the field
Shane runs after him
No
Danny, go down
You're using up the clock
But Bateman likes this new job: kick-off returner
Especially after he runs over a Giant and stiff-arms another
Bateman is finally trapped on the far sideline after gaining perhaps eight yards
So, he turns and starts running back the other way
Shane has been chasing him and now sees Bateman running back at him
Shane has no choice but to throw himself in front of Bateman's legs
Bateman goes down
Shane jumps up: (to ref) Time out
Bateman looks up at Shane
Beautiful tackle, Shane
(
) Now that's something you don't see everyday
Bateman has burned up most of the clock
Eighteen seconds remain
McGinty, Shane and Pacifico confer
We got time for one play, but if we don't get it out of bounds, the game is over
McGINTY Yeah, but you're looking at a sixty-five yard kick from here
(smoking a butt) No problem
Seriously
(to Shane) You hold it
'll kick it
McGinty looks at Shane and they both shrug
McGINTY What the fuck
Madden can't believe it
can't believe it
McGinty is gonna let Pacifico try the field goal from sixty-five yards out
Hey, John, this kid has got a heck of a foot
But sixty-five yards
Come on
He's set up to receive the snap
Pacifico lines himself up the way soccer- style kickers do
Then he takes a drag on his smoke, and flicks it away
(
) Pat
did he    just think that guy    is smoking on the    field
(
) No,  think you imagined that one, John
Shane looks at Pacifico and his clean uniform
Then Shane looks at his own uniform which is covered with blood, dirt, and grass stains
Pacifico looks clean
You look great, Lou, you know that
Pacifico is really touched
Really
Thanks, Shane
That means a lot to me
Shane turns to Evans who smiles at him between his own legs
Hut
The snap is perfect
Pacifico boots the shit out of it
End over end, yard after yard, it flies straight and true
(
) It's straight enough
If it's got the distance, it's
The ball hits the crossbar and goes over
(
) Good
Redskins win
Everybody goes crazy
Players are pounding on Pacifico
But Pacifico is desperately looking around for someone
He spots him: It's Bateman running flat-out across the field to congratulate him
Pacifico runs for his life
: - Shane knocks
After a beat, the door opens and Annabelle is standing there rubbing her eyes
She's wearing a cut-off Redskin jersey
Are you hurt
No
Not really
You're getting used to being slapped around
That's a good sign
Nothing comes out
Would you like to come in and make love
Yes
No
'm here because
don't want to be alone
Most    of the world feels that    way
You don't have    to be embarrassed about    it
But to tell you the truth
'm kind of scared of you
Annabelle takes that in and thinks about it
won't hurt you
She takes his hand and leads him inside
: '  - Annabelle is giving Shane a slow, sensuous, full-body massage
It's lucky for us he's on his stomach
Shane does a lot of moaning as Annabelle's fingers work their magic
She gets to a place on his shoulder that's especially tender
He moans even louder
That shoulder is going to need special handling
Annabelle pulls her jersey off and gently presses her breasts into Shane's back
Shane puts a pillow over his head to drown out the ecstasy
After a beat, he pulls the pillow away
You know what hurts worse than my shoulder
can't imagine
Their defensive end punched me in the mouth
Annabelle starts laughing
Seriously
It's killing me
Annabelle is laughing hard now as Shane rolls over
: '  - Shane and Annabelle are in a close, after-sex kind of cuddle thing
Shane is unburdening himself
after that game, after being beaten that badly in front of the whole country, after humiliating myself, my team, my school, my family,  mean -- did you know that  set two Sugar Bowl records was sacked eleven times
threw six interceptions
Okay
Calm down
Anyway, after that, could never seem to adjust in the pros was too scared
lost my balls
We see Annabelle's hand move slightly under the covers
Well, they're back
You know what  mean
My nerve
lost the edge you need to play this game
don't believe that
don't think it just goes away
It was only one bad day, Shane
Everybody has those
No
Somehow, convinced myself that couldn't ever win the big game
got so down, that  was afraid to be playing when a game was on the line
was afraid to screw up
That's the sure sign of a loser
From there, it wasn't very far to thinking that 'll never win, that didn't deserve to win at anything
Including love
You're wrong
You're winning now
You're winning me
They kiss real good
: '  - It's a huge town house in Foggy Bottom
Its entrance is now lined with
One is speaking   to his anchor
Bob, 'm standing in front of Redskins owner, Edward Frances 'Neil's home and all we know right now is that the Washington player previously known as Ray Smith is in fact Earl Samuel Wilkinson
We see two photographs of Earl: One with his current beard and the other, his clean-shaven mug shot of five years ago
(
) the All Pro Miami Safety who was serving five to seven years in the Maryland state penitentiary for three counts of aggravated assault
As you may recall, one of those counts was against a Baltimore City police officer and resulted in that officer being hospitalized for quite some time
- He's doing his sports segment from the studio
Any idea how Wilkinson's identity was discovered and who leaked it to the media
No, Bob, but rumor has it that the National Football League Player's Association had something to do with it
Thanks, Hank
( ) In other
news, almost sixty percent of the regular players have now crossed the picket lines and more are crossing every day
The strike, now in its second week, is expected to go out with a fizzle
Most experts think that the Monday night Dallas/Washington game will be the last with replacement players
But even that game will feature at least 75 percent of the regular Cowboys
Coach James McGinty will try to make it a perfect three and  with a team made up totally of replacement players
Well
and one felon

' Where are we gonna keep him
McGINTY In the stadium
We'll fix up something comfortable for him and he'll get his exercise by kicking the shit out of
receivers
' How did you pull that off
McGINTY How else
With your money

Augustine leaves with the tray
McGINTY want to keep Falco after the strike ends

McGINTY You've got to take the union players back once the strike ends

' The hell  do

McGINTY They'll do worse than that
They'll close down the stadium
' God damn 'em

All those millionaires down there deserve to have their noses rubbed in it
McGINTY Ed, let's be honest: beating Dallas is gonna be a hell of a trick

: - Shane walks down the hall to his room
He enters
'  - He walks in and closes the door
When he turns around, Eddie Martel, ex- Washington Redskin quarterback, is sitting on Shane's bed
Two defensive linemen-types stand by the window
What's this
This is a visit

You'll be seeing a lot of these guys tomorrow

Not much

It can be a game of luck
And under no circumstances can we allow a scab team to go three and
Especially against the Dallas Cowboys
It's just not good for the game
Is the union behind this 'visit'
can't really say, Shane
By the way, have you ever tried throwing a football with bruised ribs
He kicks Shane viciously in the side
Shane screams
The pain makes it damn near impossible
The linemen drops Shane on the floor
And one other thing: want you to stay away from Annabelle
Shane is gasping on the floor
The sad fact is she won't give me the time of day
But you can't have everything  want
can't let that happen
So, you gotta stop seeing her
Just on principle
Martel viciously kicks Shane again
Shane screams
Let me hear you say it
Shane is trying to get his breath
Come on
You can do it
(barely visible) won't go out with her anymore
Good
(to the linemen) Gentlemen
(to Shane) Hey, have a great game
They move toward the door
: - Once again, fans stream into the parking lots
In a corner of a lot, Jerome Lindell is once again holding forth
But this time, he's standing with a hard- looking guy in a suit, named
think that Mister Matheson here, and myself, are very close to an agreement that will put the 'pro' back in pro-football
Mister Matheson, what are the sticking points in the negotiations as far as the owners are concerned
Only one: that the players immediately go back to work with no change in the existing contract
Lindell looks uncomfortable
But he smiles anyway
: - The familiar " " is just ending
does his on camera intro
Good evening from the Big  here in Washington
where the mighty Dallas Cowboys take on the Cinderella Washington 'Scabskins' as they have come to be known
Hi, 'm Al Michaels and we are witnesses to a unique matchup tonight as Shane Falco and a contingent of strike players go up against the entire regular squad of the Dallas Cowboys
Yes, you heard right: every Cowboy has now crossed the picket line, some as late as this afternoon, and they will all play tonight
Can a rag tag group of hasbeens and castoffs stand up to what was once called America's team
And what about the strike itself
It has been so ineffective that many predict it will be over before this game ends
Stay tuned as Boomer and Dan join me for strike ball,
style
- Eddie Martel, Wilson Jones and other regular Redskins take their seats on the fifty yard line
: - Everyone is just about dressed in their uniforms and ready to go
Lou Pacifico enters in street clothes and starts undressing quickly
He looks worried
Shane watches Lou for a beat
We see Shane shift his upper body and grimace
McGinty enters and pulls Shane aside
McGINTY Congratulations
It's official
You're staying on after the strike
Shane smiles in spite of the pain
McGINTY It's probably better that you not say anything to the rest of the guys until after the game
Okay
Whatever you say, Coach
McGinty walks into the middle of the locker room and goes into pre-game speech mode
McGINTY Alright, listen up
The strike is just about history
By tomorrow, you will no longer be Redskins
It's important that you leave here, however, with the knowledge that you have made a difference in your own life, in the owner's life -- or what's left of it -- and especially the fans'
You have proven to a skeptical America that sports is not about contracts, or agents or shoe deals
Sports is about rising to the occasion
We have one more opportunity tonight to do that, one more chance to show what heart is all about
The Dallas Cowboys are waiting out there to kill you
expect nothing less than for you to win even in your death throes
We have a powerful weapon on our side tonight: there is no tomorrow for most of you
And that makes you very dangerous people
Use it
: - Boom
Pacifico belts the kick-off deep into the end zone
Touchback
, The three hosts sit in shirtsleeves and ties, headphones on
That    is one    very big leg    on Lou    Pacifico
He's    a big    reason why this    strike    team is two and    0
But the fact is, a kicker does not an offense make
think tonight the Scabskins will have a very rude awakening
But you have to admit, Dan, Falco is proving to be the real thing
Well, Boomer, no, don't have to admit anything
(rolling his eyes) Here we go
Everybody laughs politely
: - Bam
Earl Wilkinson flattens a Dallas punt returner
He's now wearing a jersey with his real name on the back
, Bob is dressed in a striped convict suit with Wilkinson's number on it
He gets high fives from Todd and Rod for Wilkinson's hit
He walks out onto the field to join the huddle
Shane
He turns and sees a smiling Annabelle
Shane gives her a guilty wave and then cringes with the pain of just having to lift his arm
The Redskins line up
Cochran is opposite Butler, the big tackle that "visited" Shane's room
(to Butler) just want to say what an honor it is to play opposite you
And if it's not too much trouble,  would love to have your autograph
No problem
(
) Hut
Hut
On the snap, Butler bashes Cochran's head with his forearm and knocks his helmet off
Then he runs over him
He under-throws a very weak-looking pass to Lamont
Shane grits his teeth against the pain
He's dazed and still on the ground
Butler walks over and bends down to him
'm gonna autograph your body with bruises, you scab-ass son of a bitch
: - Shane is in the backfield, once again running for his life
He's rolling left with Butler on his heels
He throws another weak incomplete pass to Murray
Shane is crushed by Butler after he throws the ball
How's that side feel
(grimacing) Like Christmas morning
Butler leans on Shane's side as he gets up
Shane gasps with pain
McGINTY He's watching Shane closely
Then he talks into his mike
McGINTY What's the matter with your arm
Are you alright
, They're watching the replay on their monitor
Dan is very happy
What pursuit
Butler never gave up on him
That's a 270-pound guy who moves like a halfback
Dan,  think Butler's hit on Falco was late, to tell you the truth
Well, of course you do
You were a wimp quarterback
Easy, guys
Some laughter

: - The Redskins huddle
Shane is in pain
He looks up at the clock
There's thirty-two seconds left in the half
Okay
Red right 15 hook
The break the huddle and come to the line of scrimmage
15  hut
Shane rolls right and looks downfield
He holds the ball and keeps rolling
No one can get open
Suddenly, Lamont cuts in front of him and yells: Shane
Lamont sees an open lane and Shane follows him
He eats up 15 yards before two defensive halfbacks close in
Lamont throws an incredible block and takes out both guys
Shane blows by and heads for the end zone
Only a safety stands between Shane and pay dirt
His side is killing him with every step he takes
When the safety moves up on him, Shane panics and goes down in the same kind of slide that Eddie Martel did in the beginning
Boom
The   and the half ends
Shane sees Redskin trainers running out onto the field
He turns and sees Lamont rolling on the ground in pain as he holds his bad knee
: - The boys are doing their half-time stand up
That's the end of the first half and not surprisingly, it was all Dallas
The Cowboys had over two hundred yards offensively versus Washington's frankly pathetic thirty-eight yards
That's total offense
Falco got close to scoring on the last play of the half but he appeared to have slipped
By the way, running back Roland Lamont was hurt on that play and word is he's on his way to the hospital
Al, the battle is being fought and won in the trenches
You can't expect a bunch of pick- up players to stand up to a professional pass rush like the Cowboys
There's still a whole half left, Dan
And remember, Falco is proving to be a second- half quarterback
You got to be kidding
Those big, fat boys in the trenches get awful tired
You ought to know that, Dan
No laughter
Okay, let's join Chris Berman with our half- time show
Chris
After a beat we hear: (
) Clear
What's wrong with you guys
He started it
did not
You called me fat
did not
But you are
Dan reaches across Al and grabs Boomer by the throat
Stop it
The three of them start wrestling in the booth
: - Everyone is nursing a bruise or some sort of wound
Shane is nowhere to be seen
McGinty walks into the middle of the locker room
McGINTY Alright, listen up: The strike is officially over
They're announcing it on  right now
So this is it, gentlemen
We have one half left to keep from being totally humiliated
You are better than the present score
You have nothing but your own self-respect riding on this game
It's up to you
Here's your swan song, people
How are you gonna sing it
And with that he walks out
Everybody looks beaten and depressed
- Shane stops two paramedics who push Roland Lamont on a stretcher
Roland is really hurting
'm sorry, Roland
That was a great block
For my last play in football, 'll take that block
Shane looks terribly guilty
thought you were going to score
What happened
Did you slip
Shane can't look at him, but he nods
That's what  thought
You were a warrior, Roland
'm gonna miss you
It was a dream come true
Go kick some ass for me
The paramedics roll him away
Shane slumps against the wall near tears
McGinty comes out of the locker room
He locks eyes with Shane for a beat
And then McGinty turns his back on him and walks away
- Everyone is quiet
Shane walks in
, the equipment manager, sees him and yells
Hey, Shane,  just heard
Congratulations
He smacks Shane on his bad side and Shane grimaces
Congratulations on what
Shane is staying on
He's gonna be Martel's backup
Everyone stares at Shane for a beat
Is that true
Yes, Andre
It's true
Nobody says anything for a beat
got to tell you, Shane, you played the first half like you were staying
Like you already had a contract
Shane looks around the room at this beaten bunch
No one makes eye contact with him
You're right, Clifford
And 'm sorry
But now want to go out there and either beat these bastards or die trying
never wanted to beat anybody so bad in my life
Everybody lets this sink in
Earl Wilkinson finally speaks up
don't know what yawl are doin' tomorrow, but my ass is goin' back to jail
But if  gotta go,  want to go back a winner
Hell, 'm retiring have thirty minutes of football left in my whole career
'm homicidal
Me, too, Reese
Let's get it on
Everybody turns to Shane
Gentlemen, our problem is the Cowboys aren't afraid of us
But they should be
Damn straight
Everybody whoops
We've got one chance on offense to make our stand -- the first play of the half
One touchdown ain't gonna help, Shane
No
But one nasty-ass play    might
We just gotta    be brave
And trust    each other
Shane happens to glance at Pacifico
Pacifico won't meet his eye
Shane turns to Sid
Help me with this
Sid helps Shane strip his jersey off
Everyone reacts to the bruises on Shane's side
Somebody has to tape me up
: - The Cowboys are already back on the field as the Redskins come out of their locker room
(
) at nine-forty Eastern time, the agreement was reached, and except for this upcoming second half, the strike is history
, Boomer's tie is off and his shirt is torn
Dan looks guilty, but still angry
It's about time
say let the professionals back on the field
The fans deserve nothing less
Yeah, you would say that
The Dallas kicker puts the ball in the end zone for a touchback
He starts to follow the offense out on the field
Then he turns and sees Annabelle engrossed in a cheer
He runs over to her
Are you okay
Is it your side
'm okay
owe you an apology
What
You do
Yes
'll explain later
But thank you for believing in me
You give me strength just looking at you
And with that, Shane takes her in his arms and kisses her deeply
The crowd on that side of the field reacts to the kiss with a "Wooooooo
" (
) Well, this is a first
Shane Falco seems to be
(
) Hell,    Al, he's necking with    a cheerleader
've    done a little of that    in my time
(
) The players are not supposed to fraternize with the cheerleaders
(
) Hey, Dan, what are they gonna do
Fire him
He breaks the kiss and looks up in the stands at Eddie Martel
Shane gives him the finger
The crowd goes "Wooooo
" at that too
Martel doesn't think this is funny
Shane walks onto the field leaving a confused but happy Annabelle
He walks past Dallas defensive lineman Butler
That wasn't too smart
Suck my dick
Butler is too shocked for a comeback
It breaks and Shane walks to the line of scrimmage
(
) Here we go, first and ten for the Redskins
Twenty-four zip Dallas
We can see now that Wilkinson and Bateman are now part of the offense
They line up as receivers opposite defensive halfbacks
In fact, everyone but Shane is on the line of scrimmage, paired up across from a cowboy
Shane leans over Reese and takes in the Dallas defense
The Dallas   yells at Shane
Are you ready for more pain, footsteps
Shane just smiles

On the snap, many things happen at once: ) sticks his fingers inside Butler's face mask and pokes both eyes
Butler screams
) throws the ball as hard as he can at the middle Linebacker and hits him in the crotch
The guy grabs himself and collapses
) kicks his defender in the shins as hard as he can
The defender screams and falls down
) gets a cornerback across from him in a choke    hold
The guy can't breathe but Bateman holds on
) lifts up his defender's face guard and connects with a right hand to the guy's chin
) pulls the defensive lineman in front of him to the ground
Then he falls on him
The guy screams
All across the line of scrimmage, Redskins are punching, kicking and gouging the Dallas defense
Flags fly everywhere
Most of the Dallas players are down and screaming
Jamal stands across from a
He hasn't touched the guy
But he nods to the player to look at his hand
The guy looks down just as Jamal flicks open a deadly-looking switchblade
The guy jumps back and yells: He's got a knife
But there is so much confusion that nobody pays any attention
Jamal slips the knife away
(
) Whoa
Flags fly everywhere
've never seen anything like this
(
) Unbelievable
One Washington player had a Cowboy in what appeared to be a police choke hold
(
) see at least five flags
no six
The officials are going crazy trying     to figure out the penalties as Shane and     the offense back up and make room for the     Dallas medical staff who come running out on     the field
Some Dallas players are livid: (to the Ref) He scratched my eyes out
He hit me on purpose
McGINTY He's smiling to himself on the sidelines
He faces the cameras, turns on his microphone and sums up the penalties
Unsportsmanlike conduct, number 72, number 81 and number 87 on the offense, fifteen yards
(to himself) times three
that's forty-five yards
Illegal use of hands, number 48 on the offense, fifteen yards
That makes it sixty yards
Unnecessary roughness number 65 and number 32, fifteen yards
that's, wait
forty-five
no, thirty
(turns to another ref) how many yards so far
ref is taking a very long walk with it
He stops at the Redskin two-yard line and puts it down
Shane leans in
Okay, everybody, stick together and don't take any shit
Let's make 'em hurt
They break the huddle and line up with their backs to their goal
Butler is still whining
can't believe you went for my eyes
Shut up
'm gonna do it again 'cause it was fun

: - The Redskin huddle breaks
The guys come to the line of scrimmage
(
) First and ten at the Cowboy twenty and 'm telling you, we are looking at a totally different team here in the second half
(
) Absolutely, Al
The Redskins are playing like there's no tomorrow, because, hey, there isn't
(
) gotta agree with you on this one
The surprising thing for me is how ineffectual the Cowboys have been in this half
mean, they look totally intimidated
(
) love when you guys agree
He's in the shotgun calling signals
Hut
Hut
He gets the snap and starts looking downfield for receivers
He slips while he's blocking Butler who takes advantage of the situation and blows by him
He's got Franklin crossing in the end zone
He cocks and throws, and simultaneously gets decked by Butler
Dallas defensive halfback     goes up for    it but just tips the ball
It      keeps going    now end over end
right into     the waiting    arms of Franklin who is standing     by himself    in the end zone
Franklin is shocked
His teammates run and mob him
(
) Touchdown, Skins
What a fluke
(
) Total luck there, Al
Makes up for the perfect ones they drop
(
) Maybe not so lucky
Falco is down
He's on his back
She looks worried as trainers run out onto the field
' They're watching in 'Neil's bedroom
Trainers are bending over him
He's out but he's mumbling: Put your tits on my head
trainer hears that and looks worried
Shane's teammates run up and carry him off the field
He's holding for Pacifico on the extra point
On the snap, Franklin bobbles the ball but manages to put it down
Pacifico belts it through the uprights
Scoreboard:    Dallas 24, Washington 21
: - Shane is sitting on the bench holding his head and his side
He's talking quietly to McGinty
He's on the field calling for a fair catch
He makes it
(
) one minute twenty remaining, and even though Dallas didn't score, they sure ate up a lot of the clock
- He's leading the offense out onto the field
(
) And it looks like Falco cannot answer the bell
He's still on the bench and it    appears that safety    Earl Wilkinson will be    leading the Redskin    offense
(
) They just need to get the ball in field goal range
(
) And for Pacifico, that's anything up to sixty-five yards
- He takes the snap from the shotgun and keeps the ball on a sweep
He plows for twelve yards
(
) That's good for twelve yards
The clock stops on the first down
The Redskins have no time- outs left
McGinty is still bent over him
McGINTY need your hands in there for the field goal
can't trust Franklin to hold
He almost dropped the extra point
Shane is in major pain but nods his head
can do it
He rolls again, but no one is open
He crosses the line of scrimmage, is hit and goes down
It continues to run and passes twenty seconds as we watch
They're hurrying back to the line of scrimmage
Wilkinson stands over center
On the snap, Wilkinson throws the ball out of bounds
(
) Wilkinson throws it away, and with twelve seconds remaining, the Redskins will try a forty-eight yard field goal to tie it up
That's almost a chip shot for Pacifico
He shakily follows Pacifico out onto the field
Reese Evans catches up with him
(to Shane) Are you okay
Just make it a good snap
(to Pacifico) And you'll do the rest, right
Pacifico doesn't answer
Evans leans over it
He's kneeling in the middle of the field waiting for the snap
But something is bothering him
(to Pacifico) Lou, are you alright
Pacifico looks up from where he is set up for the kick
There are tears in his eyes
'm sorry
They know where my family lives
Shane tries to digest what he just heard
What
(through his legs) Come on, Shane
Shane looks back at Pacifico and makes a decision
Hut
The ball is snapped perfectly
Shane catches it and spots it perfectly
Pacifico moves to kick it
And Shane pulls the ball away
Pacifico flies through the air like Snoopy as he kicks nothing but air
He lands hard
Shane jumps to his feet and starts running
(
) It's a fake
Falco has it
McGINTY He's in shock
He has totally caught the Cowboys by surprise
He sweeps around the right side
The Dallas middle linebacker has recovered and is moving quickly to cut Shane off
But Reese Evans comes out of nowhere and crushes the guy with a flying block
Shane cuts downfield and heads for the end zone with nobody near him, except: For the same safety from the first half who waits for him at the ten
The safety smiles as he takes a bead on Shane
Shane heads right for the guy
He puts his head down and smacks helmets with the safety
The guy goes down and Shane runs over him and into the end zone
(
) Falco scores
McGINTY He jumps into the air
' He jumps out of bed
, They jump on each other
She's jumping for joy
He spikes the shit out of the ball
And then sees something up field
(
) Wait a minute
Wait a minute
We've got a flag down
Shane stands stock-still in the end zone watching the  call the penalty
Clipping
Number 77 offense
He's wearing number 77 and he collapses in tears
, They are now sobbing in agony
' He's being helped back to bed by Augustine
He's walking slowly back to the line of scrimmage
McGINTY He looks sick
Shane walks up to Pacifico who is down
His arm is being immobilized by a team trainer
broke my arm
(big smile) Thank you
You saved my ass
Shane nods
In his earpiece, he hears McGinty
McGINTY (
) Someday, you can explain what that was all about
We got no kicker, so you gotta take it in
Your pick
You're the leader
(to himself) What would Unitas do in this situation
(pause) have no idea
Shane leans into the huddle
'm so sorry, Shane
'm sorry, everybody
No problem, Mickey
(to Evans) Hell of a hit, Reese
That's the one  was looking for
can retire in peace now
Right after this play
So besides me, who really wants the ball
He looks around the huddle
He studies each face
And then he comes to rest on Brian Murray
Brian's eyes are shining
He doesn't need words here
(to Murray) Yeah
You want it, Brian
Let's hook up

The pass is perfect
He pulls it in and beats his man to the end zone

It roars
"Hail to the Redskins" is deafening

Shane walks up to him and they shake hands
Pilachowski and Banes hug
Lee and Andre are hugging and crying
Cochran is on his knees praying
Reese Evans joins him
Wilkinson hugs Jamal
Clifford Franklin, hometown boy, throws himself into the stands where fans mob him
The Washington Redskins first-string quarterback is so pissed off he jumps up from his seat and turns quickly to go up the steps and out of the stadium
But he slips awkwardly and falls
He grabs his knee and screams
He's still in the end zone, holding the ball up to the crowd
The roar is deafening
' We  , but somehow the pure energy of the moment comes through
the , he's walking in toward Annabelle
And everybody is smiling
