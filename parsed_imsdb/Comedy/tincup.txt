Garrulous with drink, fraternity and amusement

-                                 2 man, , is on the roof, wrestling with a rickety satellite dish, stringing wire, trying to get it to work
(We get glimpses of him throughout the scene as he struggles with what is assuredly a pirate operation
) Four of six floodlights nailed to the roof cast pools of yellow into the gathering darkness
" " McAVOY stands under the swarm of moths crowding the brightest light, hitting golf balls
Launching them, really, into the deepening night
There's a beer between his legs
Behind him: group of men forms a semicircle, facing away from Tin Cup
These men are the range regulars: , , , and
Each man has money in one hand and his preferred libation in the other
They're all looking back and forth between the bug lights hung on the back wall, and muttering what sounds like bets to: -- a smaller man, he stands at the center of the group with a handful of cash
Romeo is a part-time bookie and full-time driving range man
Born across the river in Mexico, Romeo is Tin Cup's caddie, confidante, best friend
Okay, all bets are down
Their eyes rivet on the bug lights, edgy, hopeful, until
is
And Dewey cheers triumphantly while the other regulars mutter curses about how they woulda, coulda, shoulda bet
2
Number one is the winner
Dewey has the winner
Pays five to two
Romeo quickly pays Dewey and more quickly takes money from the losers
It's fast-paced, inane, time-killing gambling
Tin Cup looks over
Don't you shitheels ever get bored
The regulars flap dismissive palms and mutter in the negative as they turn back to Romeo and the action at the bug lights
'Cuz  got a riddle
Tin Cup leads the regulars inside
: A3
-                                  A3 Tin Cup holds court
Takes about two ounces of brains to figure it out
Anyone think they got a brain with two ounces of brains in it
The regulars silently look at each other, reluctant to reveal the heft of their brains
For Chrissakes, boys
little self-confidence from the players' gallery
We ain't talking long division
(timidly) How much we gotta lose
You want to liven things up, Earl
That's a hell of an idea
Say everyone puts in twenty bucks and the pot goes to whoever solves the riddle
You going to get the riddle, Tin Cup
3
(patiently) Dewey
'm the one asking the riddle
already know the answer
don't getta guess
Although
We could say if  get to five hundred bounces and no one gets the riddle,  get the pot
And  know what you're thinking
It's an impossible riddle
Well, It's not
It's an easy riddle
And if somehow by the grace of fluke luck  win, and you all don't agree it was an easy riddle, hell, 'll refund your money
,  & 'm in
We're in
Count us in
etc
Okay, a man's driving down the road with his son and they get in a crash
Two ambulances come and take the man and his son to different hospitals
Son goes into the operating room, the doctor looks at him and says, ' can't operate on this boy
He's my son
' How's that possible
(beat) The clock's ticking boys
Tin Cup begins bouncing a ball on the face of his wedge
Father didn't sneak back in, right
He's still at the other hospital
It ain't 'Star Trek,' Earl
No one beamed him aboard
That eliminates the most plausible theory in their minds
The men think harder
Well
if the father married the son's daughter -- It's a family riddle, Earl
Think clean thoughts
4
The regulars puzzle some more
Give us a little hint
(
) The doctor's a woman
All heads turn to take in the arrival of: 3                                                 3 Standing just inside the door -- she's a fresh-faced beauty in her early thirties, and she's got all new everything the sport of golf requires: new bag, new clubs, new shoes, new clothes, new visor
she looks like she stepped out of an ad in Golf Digest
And all the men are asking themselves the same question: what's she doing here
The silence invites Molly to supply the riddle's answer
The doctor is the son's mother
Feminists pose the riddle to reveal how deeply our sexual stereotypes run
(directly to Tin Cup) take it you're a feminist
Tin Cup misses the ball he's been bouncing, breaking the spell
The regulars wait for Tin Cup's response
Ma'am, 've been called a lot of things -- but no one's ever saddled me with that one
You might try being saddled sometime -- the smell of leather, the sting of a whip
The regulars snicker, enjoying her one-upmanship
(slightly taken aback) 'm just a humble golf pro
You're Roy McAvoy the golf pro pictured something
different
have a seven o'clock lesson
thought  had a Doctor Griswold 5
at seven
They hurry out to the range, Tin Cup oblivious to his gaffe
And the regulars gather to look out the window -- 4     -                                   4 To the range, where Molly is stretching and Tin Cup is discreetly waving to the regulars to get lost
: 5
-                                  5 The lesson begins
Tin Cup can be slightly condescending in these situations, though she's got him a little wary
The first thing you gotta learn about this game, Doc, is it ain't about hitting a little white ball into some yonder hole
It's about inner demons and self-doubt and human frailty and overcoming all that crap
So
what kinda doctor'd you say you were
'm a psychologist -- in layman's terms call me a neo-Jungian, post- modern Freudian, holistic secularist
Damn
She begins unpacking one of her bags, pulling out every golf gimmick on the market -- swing aid straps to pull your elbows together, a ball pendulum that hangs from your hat, a metal contraption for your feet, etc
Inner demons and human frailty are my life's work
used to practice in El Paso but 've moved here now
What're those
ordered these from the Golf Channel
6
He stares in disbelief as she tries to wriggle into some of this stuff
He's enchanted and dismayed
That stuff's a waste of money
'm sure there are excesses and repetitions here, but  believe in the gathering of knowledge and figured, well, there must be some truths about the golf swing illustrated by these devices -- and that you'd help me sort through it
She stands there with contraptions coming from every limb
have dozens of golf videotapes, too
And a golf watch
(irritated, impatient) Take it off
All of it
Now
You're a smart woman, for Chrissakes -- don't you know the work of charlatans when you see it
She deposits all the golf gimmick devices in a pile
No
can always tell when someone is lying to himself, but 'm quite susceptible and frequently wrong when that person lies to me
(pointing to the pile of devices) That stuff cost me over 200 dollars -- Then it's 200 dollars of shit
He tees a ball, hands Molly her driver and steps back
Go ahead
Take a swing
Molly takes a pitty-pat swing and whiffs, and mutters under her breath with the ease of a longshoreman
7
Aw, fuck
Well, you talk like a golfer -- Molly unloads a mighty second swing
The club head bounces off the mat
The ball sits untouched
Shit
'Fuck
' 'Shit
' these are highly technical golf terms and you're using them on your first lesson -- this is promising
Awright, wise ass, show me
Tin Cup takes the club from Molly, motions for her to step back, tees up a ball, and rockets a drive into the night
Something like that
He hands her back the club and tees up another ball
Molly just looks at him
Impressive
'know,  tend to process things verbally
Can you break down into words how you did that
Tin Cup takes a deep breath -- this is his speech
'What is the golf swing
' -- by Roy McAvoy
(beat) The golf swing is a poem
(') Sometimes a love sonnet and sometimes a Homerian epic -- it is organic and of a piece, yet it breaks down into elegant stanzas and quatrains
The critical opening phrase of this song is the grip, in which the hands unite to form a single unit by the simple overlap of the smallest finger
(displays grip) held lightly, a conductor's 8
baton
(starts swing) Lowly and slowly the clubhead is pulled back, led into position not by the hands but the body which turns away from the target, shifting to the right side without shifting balance
Tempo is everything, perfection unobtainable, as the body coils, now to the top of the swing, in profound equilibrium
And then a slight hesitation, a nod to the gods
nod to the gods
To the gods, yes
that he is fallible
As the weight shifts back to the left pulled now by powers inside the earth -- it's alive, this swing, a living sculpture -- and down through contact, always down, into terra firma, striking the ball crisply -- with character -- a tuning fork goes off in your heart, your balls -- such a pure feeling is the well-struck golf shot -- And then the follow through to finish, always on line -- The reverse '' of the Golden Bear, the steelworker's power and brawn of Carl Sandburg's Arnold Palmer, the da Vinci of Hogan, the unfinished symphony of Roy McAvoy
What
What's unfinished
have a short follow through -- my swing can look unfinished
Why
Some say it's because that's the best way to play through the winds of West Texas
and some say it's because  never finish anything
You can decide
The point is every finishing position is unique as if that is the signature left to the artist, the warrior athlete who, 9
finally and thereby, has asserted his oneness with and power over the universe by willing a golf ball to go where he wants and how and when, because that is what the golf swing is about
(finally) It is about gaining control of your life, and letting go at the same time
Molly stares back, exhausted and intrigued
Jeez Louise
There is only one other acceptable theory of how to hit a golf ball
'm afraid to ask
What's the other theory
Grip it and rip it
While  appreciate your poetic sensibility, Mr
McAvoy -- Call me Roy, Molly
Call me Dr
Griswold
(') Roy
but at this point  think 'm more of the 'grip it and rip it' school
Hand me the driver
Tin Cup does
She tees it up
Waggle it, Doc, don't forget to waggle
(as she stares at him) Waggle
the club head
(shows her) it's a little relaxing ritual
She waggles the club head, then takes the club back
10
Let the Big Dog eat
She stops, lets the club fall
What Big Dog
The driver, the number one wood -- It's metal
Yeah, woods are metal -- don't worry about it -- and the driver's known as the Big Dog and 'm just saying to turn him loose, let 'er rip, let the Big Dog eat
Oh
She swings
Tops the ball
It goes ten feet
This is, without a doubt, the stupidest, silliest, most idiotic grotesquery masquerading as a game that has ever been invented
(cheerfully) Yes, ma'am, that's why  love it
(beat) And if you hit one good shot -- if that tuning fork rings in your loin -- you can't wait to get back
She cracks one dead solid perfect out into the night
It felt great and she knows it
think the Big Dog ate something
Did the tuning fork ring in your loin
wouldn't go that far
Always quit on a good shot
We'll call that lesson number one
11
(confidentially) and if ya wouldn't mind paying me in cash -- there's a little situation 'm dealing with -- If you're such a legendary striker of the golf ball as everyone says, then why are you, at your age, out here in the middle of nowhere operating a barely solvent establishment, ducking the
, collecting a few pathetic dollars to buy your next sixpack -- when you're capable of so much more
Her speech is delivered without judgement or rancor, so matter of factly that he's disarmed
Perhaps 'm chocked full of inner demons
No, you're chocked full of bullshit -- (cheerily) Same time next week
She heads off to the parking lot
He stares
What did you mean  should try 'being saddled' sometime
(') Were you being literal or was that some kind of Freudian type deal
Molly
Doctor
(beat) What kind of saddle
As she walks into the West Texas night
She smiles, enjoying Tin Cup's confusion
Tin Cup just stares into the night, holding his cash, until '   down from the roof
got it
Esta bien
The flag is up

-                            7 Tin Cup enters, cash in hand, as the regulars all gather excitedly around the  monitor now coming in
class act there, boys -- probably the first actual `lady type' female ever seen on these premises -- Shut up, boss -- we got the Corpus Christi dog track on the dish -- This is yer dead mortal cinch lock bet with Do-reen
Everyone's glued to the set
greyhound race comes on from a remote Texas track on the gulf
Free money, boys, what does Doreen know about the fine art of Greyhound breeding
All she knows is she likes the three dog 'cause his name is Pride of Odessa 'cause she's from Odessa
Get ready for Oddessa-lation, boys
How deep we in
You gave her twenty to one -- It's only fifteen to one on the toteboard -- Yeah, but  got every other dog in the race
'm just getting even with Doreen -- 'm not trying to clean her clock
So how much you stand to lose
Twelve thousand
13
Hundred
Thousand
(panicky) Hundred
You said to shoot the wad
said get even, Pod
didn't say shoot the wad
We better see that three dog rolling on his ass
All eyes on the monitor -- the dogs break
Except
if he breaks slow, he won't get creamed
The starting box opens -- "   " -- the three dog breaks slow and trails down the front stretch
Three dog's dying,
easy money
(etc
) The one dog veers wide, going into the escape turn, annihilating the field
Dogs fly ass over teakettle like bowling pins, and -- Uh-oh
The three dog clears the pileup, untouched, hugging the rail
It has a ten length lead as it moves down the backstretch and past the toteboard
The race is over -- the three dog wins
Deathly silence
Somebody flips  the
Finally, in a lame attempt to lighten the moment, Romeo speaks -- So, Roy, you were saying you felt a little flutter for this doctor lady
Yes,  was saying that
just before  was interrupted by
bankruptcy -- a development that the 'Doctor Lady,' as you call her, 14
will consider utterly predictable
: 8
-                            8 The marquee advertises:  / $4
00
The parking lot is full of pickup trucks and beer cans
Tin Cup and Romeo head toward the entrance
We lost everything, boss
We owe Doreen twelve thousand bucks
think  been dating too many big-haired blondes
Them big-haired blondes are a lot smarter 'n us
(beat) how we gonna pay her
You underestimate me, Romes
Romeo doesn't realize the truth in his own response
It's a bad habit  picked up from knowing you so long
( ) Hey, Tin Cup, Doreen's looking for ya -- 'm sure she is
They enter the strip joint
: 9
-                                      9 nearly-  on stage to a lot of whooping cowboys
Tin Cup moves in this world with ease and something that passes for grace
Everyone knows him
/ Hey, Tin Cup, haven't seen ya in three days
15
Busy man, Courtenay, busy man -- As they pass the stage, even the Naked Dancer interrupts her moment with a bunch of guys offering dollar bills -- Tin Cup
Hi, sweetie
Hiya, honey -- lookin' sweet
And backstage they go, easily waved through by another bouncer
They come up to a dressing room door
And knock
voice from inside
(
) That better be you, Roy
10                                                 10 enter this holy of holies with complete familiarity
And there she is -- , 35, at least, the classic chesty, hippie, big-wigged Texas goddess
She's older than the other girls, and more experienced in every way
She's smoking a cigarette and finishing up the touches on her stripper's outfit
Tin Cup and Romeo stand at her beckoning
Doreen
You're looking particularly lovely this evening -- This is nicer than the leopard suit -- Cut the horseshit, guys
So
the one and two dogs always run wide and the three dog always breaks slow, so  figure there's gonna be a big ol' pile of fur at the turn and the three dog's gonna tiptoe around it and walk on home
was right
(smiles) You owe me twelve thousand dollars
We going to pay you
16
Tin Cup squirms as Doreen babbles a bit
know you're going to pay me
(') (admiring her own outfit) 'know  finally got rid of the leopard suit thing -- it was so retro, y'know
it's not easy being a post-modern stripper
(beat) So
twelve big ones
Tin Cup finally digs into his coat pocket and produces some official-looking papers
He hands them to her
There
With equity and inventory it's worth twelve grand
more or less
Doreen leans forward to examine the papers
She looks at Tin Cup with surprise
This is how you think you can settle up
By deeding me your driving range
Only on condition you don't sell right away, and me'n Romeo keep our jobs
What in the world would  want with your stupid driving range
Equity, inventory, cash flow
not to mention an enhanced stature in the community, and prepaid membership in the Salome Chamber of Commerce
For a moment, Doreen can only stare dumbly at Tin Cup, caught off guard by this unexpected turn of fortune
Then she starts to consider the idea more seriously
What are your labor costs
(off no response from Tin Cup) Payroll, Roy
What do you pay 17
your help
Let's see
the tractor kid gets five bucks an hour
Romeo, he gets ten cash -- What do you pay yourself
Myself
Doreen nods in a way Tin Cup finds threatening
To hit golf balls all day
when you're not breaking for beers or corn dogs or to gather the guys and lay bets on which crow flies off the fence next
You're referring to my managerial salary
'm referring to every nickel you snatch out of the till and every bag of beer nuts you lift from the rack, is what 'm referring to
(beat) 'll say it's worth ten and you still owe me two
She smiles, he sighs
: 11
-                                    11 Tin Cup parks his big old red Cadillac convertible out front
He goes around to the trunk, opens it, takes out his golf clubs, and carries them into the pawn shop
: 12
-  -   -     12 Tin Cup's domicile, parked near a slow-moving river
The red Cadillac is parked out front next to Romeo's Mercury Comet
(
) (with horror, inside 18
the Winnebago) You hocked your golf clubs
A13
-                                       A13 Tin Cup sits on the couch, swigging Maalox
still got two grand to pay off
And  can't see my new salary of seven bucks an hour plus lessons getting it done
But your clubs are your livelihood
Well the hood ain't too lively at the moment
from outside
Whoever it is, tell 'em 'm in Houston on business
Romeo opens the door, and steps outside
David Simms
What you doing in town
Romeo steps outside to greet Simms
Warily
: 13
-                                       13 Romeo and Simms under the awning
spiffy new car parked nearby
, 38, looking every bit like the successful tour pro he is
Payne Stewart to Tin Cup's Maynard
Krebs
Romeo
It's been awhile
Is Tin Cup around
Romeo is evasive
He's on business in Houston
You supposed to be out playin' on the golf tour
19
(unfazed) Well, you tell him 'm in town for my big charity best-ball tournament, and  got a spot for him when he comes back from
whatever
You got a spot for Tin Cup thought you hated him
Romeo
You wound me
'm fond of the guy, going way back to our days at University of Houston, when we won all those titles together
He says he carried you on his back
Simms won't be drawn into this adolescent competition -- he's too comfortable with himself and his success
didn't have much craft back then -- just a little native ability
Roy's a great ball- striker
Why you here
want to win my own tournament, and he can help me if we can manage to behave like grownups together
Tell him that
Tin Cup suddenly appears in the doorway
What's the catch
There is no catch
put together a tournament with an elite field and a half-million dollar purse, and 'm tired of seeing all the money head out of town
Then make more birdies
20
need you on my team
You ain't that friendly a guy
We're playing Cottonwood where you once shot fifty-nine, where you can shoot sixty-five in your sleep 'cuz you know every bump on every fairway, every subtle break on every green -- (warily) You an' me -- Me an' you -- like the old days
Tin Cup can't quite believe this offer from his old nemesis but there aren't many options out there
He grabs Simms's hand and starts pumping it, gushing with enthusiasm
Well, put 'er there, partner
These two homeboys are gonna show the world what golf in West Texas is all about
No, Roy
didn't mean  want you to play with me
just want you to caddie for me, read my putts, club me, that kinda stuff
Tin Cup wilts like a time-lapsing daisy
His hand falls free of Simms's
Words fail him
You son of a bitch
(to himself, blankly) Caddie
Me
can't bring a guy in off the street to play in my tournament
It's a big-time event, corporate sponsors, thirty dollar tickets
got a network to cover -- (interrupting, 21
outraged) This guy off the street, he could kick your ass on that golf course
Like he kicked your ass in junior golf
Like he kicked your ass in college
Like -- 'll pay you a hundred for the loop, five percent of any earnings -- Get the hell outta here
Take your goddamn color coordinated corporate sponsored soul and get outta here
Okay, okay, just thought 'd offer you some work
Simms heads to his car
Simms
(stops) What
'll take the job
We'll take the job
Simms nods in agreement, and exits
Tin Cup stands there with Romeo, feeling humiliated
- drives away down the road
(
) That man stands for everything hate in life
(
) You mean like
success

giant gallery lines the fairway and rings the distant green which is fronted by a lake, as: hits a three wood toward the green -- the in the middle of the lake
The
Stadler just shrugs to Simms, as if to say, " thought had enough club
" Like  told you, it was more'n you had in the bag
Yeah, well
had to go for it after your caddy said he could get home from here
Simms swivels his head around to look at Tin Cup
could
Simms looks away, at the shot he's facing: a two hundred fifteen yard carry over water
He looks back at Tin Cup, shaking his head
gotta hand it to you, Roy
For fifteen holes you've seemed to grasp the concept here: 'm trying to win and your job is to help me
23
Five percent of your earnings does numb the gag reflex
Give me the seven iron
'm laying up
You can make that shot
The smart play's to lay up
These fans didn't pay thirty bucks to watch a tour star lay up on a short par five
'm sitting on a two shot lead with three to go, and my partner's in his pocket
Suddenly, par's a good number
Gimme the seven Iron
No way
You're going for the green
These fans paid good money to see golf shots they can't hit, not golf shots they feel shitty about themselves for having to hit
Simms reaches for the seven iron
Tin Cup clamps a hand over the club
Thirteen years on tour and you're still a pussy
Hit the fucking one iron, Dave
Thirteen years in a driving range and you still think this game's about your testosterone count
Simms removes Tin Cup's hand from the seven iron and grabs the club, stepping up to address the ball
Tin Cup mutters to the gallery
Two-fifteen to carry, and the tour star's laying up
And the remark summons gallery voices suddenly urging Simms to go for the green
Simms motions for Tin Cup, as 24
if reconsidering
But if you're gonna editorialize, do it on the other side of the ropes
got no qualms about firing your ass right here, right now
Fire me
Hell,  should fire you
Simms steps back to his ball with the seven iron, and: 16   Stadler's still standing back where he hit the shot into  16 the lake
and  McCORD, the other team in the pairing, are there with him
Romeo, Stadler's caddie, stands just behind them
McCORD (to Mickelson) know you could knock it on from here, 'm just saying that caddie's been drinking muddy water if he thinks he can
He can
All the players look at Romeo as: Simms dumps his seven iron shot safely down in front of the water to a smattering of polite applause
Simms tosses the club back to his bag as Tin Cup retrieves the divot
And: Hey, Dave
We in a hurry
Simms looks several yards back where Stadler is still standing with McCord and Mickelson
'Cause  just bet McCord and Mickelson that your caddie could knock it on from here
We're trying to win a tournament, pardo
know
But 'm getting five to one

17 The  from the   looks at the monitor where a hand-held camera is picking up Stadler motioning Tin Cup over
From two-fifty from a snarly lie, over water, on national , with no warmup
'd give ten to one to a tour pro
18                                                    18 Stadler, McCord, and Mickelson are smiling at the bet
This is golf
But Simms snarls at being challenged
Stadler drops a ball in the rough for Tin Cup to hit
Here ya go
Take a hack at it
Balls versus brains, Roy
You hit that shot, just keep walking, 'cuz your ass is fired
Tin Cup mulls over the warning, as: , McCORD, Come on, Roy
Your fans are calling
Stadler waves his arms to summon a cheer from the gallery
Tin Cup puts down Simms's golf bag
How you gonna fire me in front of all these people
Especially when knock it on the green
And he heads over to where Stadler and the others stand waiting
19                                                         19 , with a hand mike, following the group, begins to describe the extraordinary event unfolding
(on mike) It seems like the Charity Tournament is taking a little 26
break for a side bet, here -- Gary McCord moves toward the camera and takes the microphone
McCORD Peter, 've done a little background here -- this unfolding disaster's a driving range pro named Roy McAvoy, who everyone calls Tin Cup
Locals claim he he was a pretty good college lick and knocked around the mini-tours
20   Tin Cup steps up to hit the shot
McCord lowers his     20 voice
McCORD but  guarantee you, he's about to suffer brain arrest
He's thinking about the cameras and the gallery and the water, and all that gray matter between his ears is turning to goo
and incidentally, Stadler's got it booked at ten to one
Tin Cup swings, and: 21   The    the ball arching high and true off  21 the club
It lands on the green
The
and the roar becomes deafening as the ball rolls three feet from the pin
McCORD He's not that good
he's definitely not that good
(etc
) 22     the course -- a scuffle's breaking out
22 David Simms helping some guy over the gallery rope
Simms walks the guy back to his golf bag
and now Tin Cup understands what's happening, and: Take a hike, Roy -- the loop's over
You can't fire me
How can you fire me
just knocked it stiff from two fifty
Gimme that bag
Tin Cup reaches for the bag
The guy holds onto it
They wrestle briefly, as Simms sighs with fatigue and looks for a marshal
27
Security
Tin Cup gives up wrestling when he sees a couple marshals approaching
He turns his anger on Simms
What about my money
You just hit the shot that took you out of the money
Welcome to life on the tour
Tin Cup goes after the bag again
The guy still hangs on
The marshals arrive, and begin to wrestle with Tin Cup
He goes berserk
a  battle royal

greets the shot, and: (
) Hey, Tin Cup
You made the news
The Regulars crowd under the  on the wall above the till, hooting at what they just saw
Tin Cup is nowhere in sight
24
-                                       24 Romeo scoops balls into wire buckets from the garbage can of water where the balls are washing
Tin Cup sits on a bench, alternately swigging cheap whiskey and Maalox
28
If  had it all to do over, 'd still hit that shot
(nods with neither rancor nor irony) The look comes over your face, you would bury yourself alive to prove you can handle a shovel
Tin Cup looks over at Romeo for signs of an implied pejorative
But Romeo's just washing and scooping balls
and looking badly in need of perspective
You know why 'd still hit that shot
Now Romeo looks over
and he decides that Tin Cup is the one in need of perspective
'Cuz it's the only way you can beat David Simms
'Cuz you never got over that he is on tour and you are not
'Cuz you get that look on your face
No
(pauses, adding weight to his thoughts) 'd hit it again because that shot was a defining moment
And when a defining moment comes along you define the moment or the moment defines you
did not shrink from the challenge
rose to it
Romeo nods, holding his peace
1981, Fort Washington Golf Club, Fresno, California, final round of the Tour Qualifying School
Tin Cup cringes at the memory, then moves for the high ground
was playing to win
defining moment when you tried to hit the same impossible cut 29
three wood into the wind from a hilly lie -- four in a row out of bounds -- until you finally pulled it off and tapped in for a thirteen
(beat) When a twelve woulda got you on the tour
That was a defining moment and the definition was shit
Greatness courts failure, Romeo
That's why most people, in their whole lives, never ever reach for the brass ring, never know when to dig deep and try for the impossible shot
You're right about that, boss, but sometimes
sometimes
par is good enough to win
Tin Cup tosses down another Maalox cocktail

held aloft by the eager locals in the front row
and then a handful of papers held aloft by one Roy McAvoy, also in the front row
Doreen dances over and picks the papers from his hand, reading them as she dances
The DieHard/West Texas Calcutta, the Duvall County Boys Club Pro/ Scratch, Woody's Steak House One Club Scramble
what do  want with all these entry forms

It's a business proposition
'm offering you my winnings from all them tournaments this summer
In exchange for what
My driving range back
She dances away from him, not exactly sold on the idea
She dances back to him, reclines a leg on the partition, and moves her face opposite his
Roy, 'm not as dumb as my hair makes me look
They ain't all strictly minor league
One of 'em pays almost two grand
She twirls off
He chases her, beer and entries in hand
Now wait, Doreen
You gotta do the math, and you gotta look at how good 'm playing
hit the shot of the tournament at the best-ball
They put it on national
saw
And what does that tell you
The  comes to an
The club is momentarily silent
(shouting) And what does that tell you
It tells me you took an unauthorized day off
Next time it happens, you're fired
In the meantime, 'm putting in a time clock
'm not punching in no time 31
clock like some working stiff
: 27
-                                 27 Tin Cup punches the new time clock which is located under the awning near the ball wash
goes the   as he hurries outside -- 29
-                                     29 -- and there he finds Molly, waiting on the tee with her driver and a bucket of balls
Am  early
Mr
McAvoy,  can appreciate that you have a fairly laid-back, relaxed lifestyle -- but  have hours to keep
former paramour once ascribed my fluid sense of time to being born under the sign of Pisces -- something about floating through the universe -- He tees a ball for her and steps back
She's staring at him, half-amused
You amuse me, Roy
But 'm the only woman in America born after World War  who thinks astrology is a crock of shit
(beat) Now let's see if the Big Dog'll eat
Waggle
'm waggling
Set up to the ball like  showed you last time
Molly addresses the shot
Her stance is rigid, overly 32
mechanical
Tin Cup winces
But she looks terrific
Quit trying to wring that club's neck, Molly
Show it a little warmth and compassion
He moves around behind her to reposition her shoulders
Remember, this game's about trust and touch and letting go
So while 'm subtly enhancing your technical prospects, why don't you tell me all about your personal life
It's none of your fucking business, Roy
Tin Cup's hands move down to square her hips
He's discreet and professional
Your boyfriend's a golfer -- that's my bet -- and he's why you're taking this game up
Hell,  probably even know him -- (
) Get your hands off her ass, Roy
And, as Tin Cup's hands recoil in alarm
steps onto the range
(to Simms) Hi, sweetie
Not him
Crushed and bewildered
killer smile
The man is absolutely at ease with his own success and charm

-                                    30 shadow paces across the drape in the lighted window

How am  supposed to compete with that
31
-                                    31 Romeo ponders Tin Cup's dilemma from the couch
Man, you are having a bad week
She must think 'm such a nothing, such a loser
a lousy driving range pro living in a Winnebago, making five bucks an hour plus lessons
She don't know you live in a Winnebago
Well, she sure as hell knows ain't taking her to no Doral for massages and mimosas all weekend
gotta do something with my life
He reflects deeply while Romeo shrugs
gotta rise to a level worthy of the women that think 'm a joke
Well
you could go out and win The Open
(pausing, as if jarred) Romeo, that idea has promise
was joking
ain't
34
We talking about the same tournament
The
Open
The Biggest golf tournament in the world
Not just the biggest golf Tournament in the world; the most democratic
What do you mean
mean it's open
Anyone's got a shot at it
You just gotta get past a local and a sectional qualifier, and unlike Doral or Colonial or the
, they can't keep you out
They can't ask you if you're a garbageman or a bean- picker or a driving range pro whose check is signed by a stripper
You qualify, you're in
And then you pay out of your own pocket to go there and get all nervous and intimidated -- Who's intimidated
just told you 'm gonna win the damn thing
You don't got the game
got every shot in the book
said you don't got the game
The mental game
The head game
You suggesting  err on the side of excess
You always go out to shoot zero
Sometimes you pull it off
But you can't play like that at the Open
You win by taking what the course gives you
You win by being humble, which you aren't, and patient, which you never will 35
be
Tin Cup comes over to the couch, sits down, and puts an arm around Romeo
Well, since you're the authority, How'd you like to teach me how to be what  ain't and never will be
You don't ever listen to me
This time'll be different promise
don't know, man
Right now you don't even got the money to get your clubs out of hock
Yeah, well
my sticks may be in a pawn shop, but  got a rake and a hoe at the range
: 32
-                           32 Expensive cars in the parking lot --  putting green in b
g
The trunk opens
set of expensive golf clubs is removed by a wealthy looking guy, , 40'
He turns to face Tin Cup and Romeo who is reaching into the trunk of Roy's Cadillac
Let me get this straight -- you're going to play me for four hundred dollars with those
Romeo removes an old golf bag from the trunk
It contains a rake, a hoe, a baseball bat, and assorted garden tools
And 'll give ya two a side got the title to my car as collateral
36
'm not interested in that piece of shit
That's cuz you think of it as transportation, Boone
Think of it as bragging rights
Think of yourself sitting around the bar crowing to your buddies about the Cadillac you won off Tin Cup McAvoy
(the real kicker) They'll forget all about the Winnebago you lost to me
: 33
-   -             33 Boone addresses the ball on the first tee
No mullies, no gimmes, no bumping the ball -- And he rips a drive down the fairway
Nutted it
Tin Cup selects the baseball bat from his golf bag
Romeo hands him a pink ball and Tin Cup shows it to Boone
'll be playing a Pink Lady today
That little pink fag ball supposed to rattle me
Tin Cup moves over to the tee markers
Not unless  knock it by you
And he tosses up the Pink Lady and fungoes it long and straight down the fairway
: 34
-                            34 Tin Cup stops at his ball, and looks twenty yards back to 37
where Boone has arrived with his caddie at his drive
Yep,  caught this thing way the Hell on the toe
Boone knocks an iron onto the edge of the green
Drive for show, putt for dough, big shot
Did you hear that, Romeo
Boone was being profound
He has revealed to me the essential mystery of golf
Drive for show, putt for dough
(holds out a palm) Louisville Slugger, please
Boone's a little rattled by Tin Cup's insouciance
You got Boone shakin' already -- (studying the approach) Front left bunker's your best angle to the pin
(calling his shot) Front left bunker -- plugged lie
He tosses up the ball and fungoes a lazy fly ball
: 35
1ST     -                  35 Boone gazes with malicious delight at Tin Cup's ball, buried in the front left bunker
He watches Tin Cup take the hoe from Romeo and move down into the trap
want to see a legitimate swing
No scooping
Tin Cup holds up a hand like a gallery marshal requesting silence
Stand, please
Gallery, please, stand
38
He addresses the ball, choking down on the hoe, positioning the blade at an odd angle
He hacks at the ball with an unorthodox chopping motion
The ball pops up in the air, lands on the green, releases and rolls up a foot from the hole
Boone's jaw drops
Tin Cup hit an impossible shot with utter ease and facility
'll finish
Tin Cup trades Romeo the shovel for the rake, takes the pin out of the hole, and pool cues the putt home
Par
Boone looks at his own sixty-foot putt and he knows he's just been had
utterly, embarrassingly, and thoroughly
Without a word he counts four hundred dollars from his roll and drops it on the green
Get the hell off my course
38
-                                         38 Tin Cup and Romeo emerge, Romeo carrying
's sticks
Listen, swami, your job is to teach me patience and humility, not to advise me on my love life
No
My job is to get your head straight so you can qualify for The Open, much less win it
To get your head straight you got to forget about the doctor lady
They head up the street under a collonade toward Tin Cup's waiting Caddy
Not all my thinking occurs below the belt
actually stand for a few things beside where my next romantic interlude is coming from
Then you got no problem telling the doctor lady you can't teach her no more till after the Open
Tin Cup blinks silently a moment, feeling slightly cornered
39
That would make an issue of something that ain't an issue
Besides, 'm focused
Romeo responds with a Spanish curse
mean, this is my quest
Ahhh
your quest
chingaso
This is where  stand up for all the little guys everywhere who've had their fill of soulless robots like David Simms -- He may be a soulless robot but he's a rich, happy soulless robot with a beautiful doctor lady girlfriend who's got you by the huevos -- (beat) Besides, how is getting into the Open gonna change what she thinks about you
It'll prove to her that 'm not who she thinks  am
But you are who she thinks you are
Look,  don't bet on a horse with a hard-on
Hard-on
Hard-on
Hard-on
Here, touch me, feel -- (as Tin Cup grabs himself) don't feel nothing
Here
(embarrassed) Hey, hey
shit
cool it
39   Suddenly a convertible passes -- Simms and Molly,        39 laughing, carefree, enjoying each other
The couple in the car doesn't see Tin Cup grabbing his crotch making a fool of himself on the sidewalk -- but Tin Cup and Romeo see them
40
The car disappears down the street
Tin Cup cools off, chilled, really -- and full of chagrin
Okay, okay
maybe  got a semi
: 40
- '   -         40 Doreen's on the phone, between shows, and is adamant
cannot give you time off to win The Open
don't care if it's your 'quest'
(listens) or your 'destiny'
(listens) or any of those terms you vaguely remember from your Cliff Notes
(listens) You shoulda treated me nicer when we were an item -- then maybe wouldn't be such a nasty boss
'bye, Roy --  have a business to run
She hangs up and heads out on stage as the music calls
: 41
-                                  41 Tin Cup hangs up the phone and turns to Romeo
Man, ever since  let her dump my ass she just can't resist kicking me in it
Maybe you should treat her more like a lady
After she ran off with that Dallas banker
She did that after you let her dump you
It wouldn't kill you just once to tell her she's beautiful, she can dance, she's 41
sexy
Romeo
are you sweet on Doreen
No more'n you are for that doctor lady
couple of deep sighs
Two losers with fluttering hearts
Great, Romeo, just great
just when  need you to be my friend and coach, you go get all gooey about one of my ex-girlfriends who just happens to be our boss
Anybody comes to me for help on their love life about women is already too far gone
don't recall asking you for advice
(beat) Women are tougher to figure out than a feathered one iron from a tight lie -- Suddenly a golf image relaxes them into their comfort zone
Actually if you open the club face a hair and play it off your back foot -- Shut up, Romeo
wasn't really seeking golf tips
It's all 'm good for -- but you can count on me for that, at least
How far off the back foot
'Bout three balls
Silence
Golf is so much easier than life
42
'm ready to charge forth in pursuit of my mythic destiny and can't get time off work to do it
'm no expert, but it seems to me that the `pursuit of a person's mythic destiny' is not the sort of thing that a person needs to get off a five dollar an hour job in order to do
'm stuck
Buried
My life's a plugged lie in a kakuyi bunker with a tight pin position on a green with a stimp meter reading of thirteen
(beat) need help
need advice need counsel
(beat) need a shrink
You don't know no shrinks
know one
Not the doctor lady
Why not
You can't ask advice about the woman you're trying to hose from the woman you're trying to hose
Hose
Hose
Get your mouth outta the gutter
This is a matter of the heart

() -                             A42 Tin Cup's Caddy pulls up and   he gets out, goes to the front of a store that is now   a health services office
He looks around warily -- as   if someone might see him entering such a place -- and   ducks inside

-                                       B42 It's the exit, "cool down" room, not the waiting room
Tin Cup sits nervously, he's slightly overdressed for the occasion
He looks childlike
The door to the inner office opens -- a woman comes out and sits down across from him
She's weeping uncontrollably
He stares
He fidgets
He's nervous, out of place
Finally Molly enters through the same door because she hears the crying
She sees Tin cup -- an awkward moment, then -- didn't do anything
know
know
wait in there
Tin Cup slips into the main office while Molly consoles the weeping woman
: 42
'  -    -                 42 Tin Cup is dutifully lying on the couch because he heard that's what you do
He stares at the ceiling
Molly enters and sits down
Roy
are you okay
need therapy
Obviously
What do  do
mean
to do it therapy
mean, how do start doing
it
In parlance you might understand, just kick back and let the Big Dog eat
He sighs and plunges in
44
Okay, okay, let 'er rip
(deep breath) Suppose there's this guy
He's standing on the shore of a big, wide river
And the river's fulla all manner of disaster, like alligators and piranhas and currents and eddies, and most people won't even go down there to dip a toe
But on the other side of the river's a million dollars, and on this side of the river there's a rowboat
guess my question's this: What would possess the guy on shore to swim for it
He's an idiot
No
He's a hell of a swimmer, see
His problem's more like
why's he always gotta rise to the challenge
He's a juvenile idiot
You don't understand what  mean by the river
We're talking about you and what you like to call your inner demons, Roy, that human frailty you like to blather about, not some mytho-poetic metaphor you come up with in a feeble and transparent effort to do yourself credit
'mean you're gonna make me feel lousy
came here to feel better -- what kinda therapy is this
You don't have any inner demons
What you have is inner crapola, inner debris -- garbage, loose wires, horseshit in staggering amounts
45
ain't just some jerk driving- range pro who drinks too much booze and eats too few vegetables
You're being defensive -- cut to the chase and tell me why you're here
Well
'm smitten with a woman
That's good
Is she smitten with you
Not yet
Have you asked her out
She's seeing a guy
don't know how serious it is, but the guy's a real horse's ass, in my opinion
If you shared your heart with this woman -- maybe asked her out to dinner -- then it would force these issues out in the open
'm afraid she'll say no
Ahh
so what you're saying is that all your speeches about swimming across the shark infested waters are really just about your golf game -- not about your personal life
Christ,  didn't know we were gonna get into my personal life
This is therapy
Well, jeez,  know, but  didn't think it was that kind of therapy
46
What were you expecting
Ann Landers
Yeah
Look, it's rather simple
Those risks that you love to take on the golf course, the risks you talk so passionately and poetically about -- you need to apply those risks to your personal life with the same passion
should ask this woman out
Yes
should risk coming right over the top and snap-hooking it out of bounds left
Yes
Risk hitting it a little thin and -- For Godsakes, Roy, that's enough
Right
Sorry
'okay
(beat) Look, just walk up to this woman, wherever she is, look her in the eye with those big beautiful green eyes of yours, let down your guard and don't try to be smooth or cool or whatever -- just be honest and take the risk -- you can do it
Tin Cup rises with new confidence
He does several deep breathing exercises, trying to work up the courage
She stares at him
And he walks right up to her
Dr
Griswold --  think 'm in 47
love with you
Molly is stunned
What
From the moment  first saw you knew  was through with bar girls and strippers and motorcycle chicks, and when you started talking  was smitten and 'm smitten more every day  think about you -- and the fact that you know 'm full of crapola only makes you more attractive to me because usually  can bullshit people but  can't bullshit you and in addition, most women 'm thinking about how to get into their pants from Day One but with you 'm just thinking about how to get into your heart -- Molly was clue-less
She just stares
My God
(optimistically, proudly) Stunned, eh
So what about dinner and we can talk about `us' and if we have a future and how to drop that horse's ass boyfriend of yours -- Roy, slow down -- Hey
just hit a eight degree driver off a cart path here, 'm staring eagle in the face -- This is a terrible mistake
Tin Cup is knocked off his horse
Into deep rough
'm acting from the heart so can't make a mistake
Right
48
Wrong
Aw, shit
(beat) am one horrible shrink
jeez
didn't know you were talking about me
Would your advice have been different
She's frustrated and at a loss for words
Session's over
You better leave
Crushed, Tin Cup heads to the door, stops and turns
'm gonna qualify for the
Open and kick your boyfriend's ass
Please leave
Whatever you think of me, you should know that your boyfriend hates old people, children, and dogs
He exits
She just sits there
: 43
-   -                      43 The lone figure of Tin Cup stands on a tee, arching --
-- into the night, serenaded by and the occasional -  a fly
Romeo and the regulars stand behind Tin Cup observing approvingly
Tin Cup mutters something with every swing
It sounds like he's saying -- (just before swinging) Dollar bills
Tin Cup hits another shot, totally focused
Dollar bills
49
How'd it go with the doctor lady, boss
If she was a par three, 'd'a made a nine
Stroke and distance, eh
(nods, deep in concentration) Dollar bills
Romeo backs off to let the man practice, and Clint asks: What's he saying
Dollar bills
His divots got to look like dollar bills
'Course Moe Norman hits divots like bacon strips 'cuz he come over the top, but that's gettin' too technical for you
Clint turns and nods approvingly to the rest of the regulars
See that, boys
He's hitting dollar bills
Tightening his game
They murmur approval, but Earl catches Clint's eye and jerks his head at Tin Cup, indicating Clint isn't doing his job as group spokesman
Clint takes a step forward
Uh, something us shitheels want you to know, Tin Cup, is uh, well, we been to see Doreen, and we told her we'd stage a customer's strike if she didn't give you time off to win the Open
This remark penetrates Tin Cup's concentration
He turns with a smile to the regulars
You perverts did that for me
We believe in you, man
50
And if you get past the local qualifier, we gonna sponsor you
Tin Cup looks at the beaming faces of the regulars and smiles broadly
Thanks, boys -- a man couldn't have better friends
Now move the hell back and shut the fuck up
You're messing up my concentration
And with big smiles, they move each other back so as not to mess up Tin Cup's concentration
And he pulls out another ball, mutters dollar bills, and hits another perfect shot

The door opens -- Molly enters
He's surprised but well- settled into his bath of cynicism
God, you've got a beautiful swing -- -- And big, beautiful green eyes -- 'm a beautiful guy
came here to apologize
For what
Well,  counseled you, you did exactly what  said, and  just
poured cold water over your effort
(quickly) didn't get it
'm a terrible shrink, probably
should've never got out of real estate -- actually  should never have left Ohio for that cowboy in Armarillo -- have you ever been to Amarillo
cowboy
It's not as romantic when you're actually with one -- a wrangler, y'know -- so of course the oil man in Dallas looked great after that --  don't know what  was thinking
That's when  went to the gulf and ended up in, well, trailer sales and then all those condos in Corpus Christi -- the bottom fell outta the market and needed a new gig -- new gig

shoulda just layed up, made my par, and moved on
Look,  want to propose something -- as long as you understand this is professional -- we're not going out together -- Tee it up
can help you with the mental aspects of the game
You've got Romeo to be your swing doctor, can be your head doctor
But you said you were a lousy shrink
Well, yeah
'll improve
got no money to pay for you
'll trade my services for golf lessons and help you through the qualifying
If you get into the Open, well, you're on your own
You'll be with David

who will be playing with
The regulars applaud and whistle and shout way too many "You the man's
" as Tin Cup steps onto the first tee, followed by his Sancho Panza, Romeo
Tin Cup is feeling on top of the world, at his cocky best
How ya feelin', boss
'm feelin' like par's a bad score, podnuh -- fifty-eight's within the realm
Jesus, the doctor lady's here -- - standing not far from the regulars
Didn't  tell ya
She's gonna be your guru partner
You handle my swing mechanics and she handles my brain mechanics
Long as you keep your dick out of it -- Me an' the 'big guy' have an understanding
He's gonna lie low till  get in the Open -- then
then
The Big Dog'll eat
The Big Dog'll hunt, that's for sure
Tin Cup steps up to the tee, a couple quick limber 54
swings, and he tees it up
As he does, Romeo slips over to Molly
(softly) Looks like we partners, Dr
Molly -- just have to help him keep his head on straight -- If you can, you be the first
He does have the occasional tendency towards self-destruction it seems
It ain't occasional and it ain't no tendency -- it's a fact of life that he gonna blow sky high, it's just a matter of when and how fast can the pieces be put back together
(beat) Behind that twinkle in his eyes is nitroglycerin
Tin Cup waves and motions to his team
Quiet in the gallery
man's trying to do his job
And Tin Cup uncoils a mighty drive with an elegant stroke, fully confident and smooth
The gallery applauds
(generally announcing) Got my '' game with me today, folks
you're in for a real treat
Molly leans to Romeo just before they all head down the fairway and confides -- find him mildly attractive when he's obnoxious and arrogant like this -- 55
Good
'Cause it's his best side
And they head down the fairway, a scruffy little gallery on a so-so course
With a lot at stake

-   -            53 Tin Cup's in a zone, talking to himself, full of himself, in a fabulous, indomitable state of mind
Molly and Romeo keep looking at each other and shrugging, Tin Cup's on a roll and needs no help
So far
couple of the regulars shout out encouragement
/ You the man, Tin Cup
You the man
They bugging you, boss --  can shut 'em up
The way 'm swinging today, 56
nothing bugs me -- except insufficient applause
(surveying the fairway) Gimme the lumber
But Romeo is handing him a two iron
think two iron's safer
said  want the Big Dog
Romeo looks warily down the fairway of a tight dogleg left par five
Tight par five, out of bounds left
you don't want to hit driver
'm not going left of those trees
'm going over those trees
with a little draw
That way  get home in two
That way 'm putting for eagle
You don't need eagle to qualify
You need to get used to playing smart -- no mistakes wins the Open
Qualify
want the course record
Now gimme the lumber
Tin Cup reaches for the driver
Romeo shifts the golf bag beyond Tin Cup's reach
You not going to listen to me
You don't care 'm trying to help
You think 'm full of shit
think 'm gonna get penalized for slow play if you don't give me that fucking driver
You a head case, boss, always were, always will be
57
Then let's ask the head doctor
Dr
Griswold
(to Molly) Dr
Griswold, should  hit the Big Dog or the two
Suddenly an  steps forward
Soliciting shot selection advice is a two-stroke penalty
Trust your feelings, Roy
(to Romeo) Ha
Gimme the driver and shut up
Romeo pulls out the driver and he snaps it in half over his knee
He tosses the two halves on the ground near Tin Cup
Go ahead
Hit the driver
Tin Cup looks at the two halves of his driver, curbing his anger, not giving Romeo the satisfaction of a reaction
changed my mind
Gimme the three wood
You can't clear the dogleg with a three wood
Wanna bet
Romeo pulls out the three wood, snaps it     over his knee, and tosses the halves on the ground next     to the driver halves
Tin Cup turns with amusement to      his playing partners, lest they think management has     lost the upper hand with labor
Guess 'm going with the safe shot, boys
Tin Cup reaches for the two iron, studies it a moment, frowns, and then: He snaps it over his knee
He dumps these halves on the ground with the halves of the driver and three wood
58
Romeo stares, aghast
Tin Cup merely shrugs
Sometimes  fan that two iron
Better gimme the three
Romeo warily hands Tin Cup the three iron
Tin Cup looks at it, frowns, then: He snaps it over his knee and tosses it on the ground
Molly leans over to the regulars
Is this normal behavior for him
The word 'normal' and him don't collide in the same sentence too often
She watches in amazement as -- Sometimes  catch that three a little thin
He drops the three iron halves with the other halves, and steps past Romeo and sequentially yanks all but the seven iron from his bag
He snaps them over his knee, one by one, citing the crimes of each club with mounting absurdity and ire
And 've hooked my four iron
(snap) and hit flyers with the five
(snap) and shanked the six
(snap) and skulled the eight
(snap) and fatted the nine
(snap) and chili-dipped the wedge
(snap) and bladed the sand wedge
(snap; then pauses to reflect contemptuously on his putter) and then there's Mister Three-putt
He snaps the putter in half and dumps it in the pile of 59
broken clubs at his feet
Then, he reaches for the last club in his bag, the seven iron
The regulars hold their breath, thinking this is the end of Tin Cup's Open bid
But
Tin Cup smiles and caresses the seven iron affectionately
But the seven iron,  never miss the seven iron
It's the only truly safe club in my bag
He moves to the tee, drops a ball, and hits it down the middle with the seven iron
You happy, Romeo
No, boss, 'm tired
my life's too short to spend it watching you fall apart
done it too many times
Romeo turns and starts walking away
What's this
You're quitting
First sign of adversity, you're quitting
(as Romeo continues) Anyone want to bet me  can't par in with a seven iron
(to Molly) Doc
Take the bet
Roy -- just shut up and hit the ball
: 54                                            54 Tin Cup's magic with a seven iron
He drives with a seven iron
55   He chips with a seven iron
55 56   He blasts out of sand with an open-bladed seven iron
56 60
: 57
-   -      57 Tin Cup drains a ten foot putt -- also with the seven iron, and left-handed to boot
He's past the local qualifier
The regulars erupt in cheers
You'd have thought he won the Masters
And Tin Cup shrugs to the tiny gallery, with insouciance and cockiness, and pronounces -- An easy game, this golf
: 58
19TH  -   -  ()                  58 Tin Cup holds court surrounded by his regulars and much of the gallery
He's a local hero -- but Molly's not impressed
delivers a tray of long neck beers
19TH Beer for everybody
You the man, Tin Cup
toast is raised to their king, and Tin Cup eats it up
Thanks, boys, what'ya think was my best shot -- the seven iron on twelve, the seven iron on fourteen, or maybe it was the bunker shot on eighteen which, to my recollection was a -- seven iron
Much laughter
This is the Tin Cup they love
You definitely the man
How'd  do, Doc
(cheerfully) You failed miserably
61
What
parred the back nine with a seven iron,  qualified for the regionals,  -- Your job is not just to qualify for the Open, it's to prepare for the Open
My job is to help you prepare
You said to 'trust my feelings'
didn't know you felt like breaking all the clubs in your bag
He didn't break the seven
He smoked that seven, brother -- From what  understand, the
Open is the most difficult golf tournament in the world played under the most difficult circumstances with the greatest players -- winning it means controlling yourself, managing your emotions, staying cool, not getting in a pissing contest with your caddie who, incidentally, quit
He always quits, he always comes back
Nonetheless, from the mental aspect -- which is my domain -- you have regressed and are fumbling somewhere between delusion and denial
'Regression, delusion, denial'
You gotta use all this psychological language
'm a psychologist
62
Tin Cup turns to the regulars for support
(
) Have a bad day, Roy
Everyone turns to see David Simms enter the conversation
Hi, honey
shot 65 -- parred the backside with a seven iron
(intrigued) Why
That's the question -- why
Silence
'Cause he broke all his other clubs
Snapped 'em in two -- even the putter
Jesus, Roy, 'm on your side here
We go way back
hope you get into the Open, but if you don't play under control, you'll get slaughtered
Good players shoot 82 in the Open
You can't always go for it
Swear to God, Doc, this guy is not who you think
It's a well-known fact that if a camera's not on him, he treats old people and children like dirt
And dogs
Yeah, don't forget the dogs
think we should go, David
63
think so
Tin Cup's worst characteristics flare up, he won't let go
You ever shoot par with a seven iron
It never occurred to me to try
(to Molly) 'mon, let's go
The car's over here
'll bet you a thousand dollars against my car that  can beat you in any game -- any game, you name it -- with a seven iron
This is ridiculous
You a coward
You gonna lay up the way you did at the Masters last year
(taunting, like children) Chickie, chickie, chickie
Simms is a little drawn in, not so much by the challenge as the desire to shut up Tin Cup
Any game,  name it
Oh, come on, David -- just want to teach him a lesson
Why do men insist on measuring their dicks
Tin Cup takes her literally and rises, starting to unbuckle his belt
Awright, awright
Let's measure, 64
right now
For God sakes,  wasn't being literal
(beat) David, let's go
Molly, trust me on this one
Call it part of his mental preparation for the Open, where the rough is deep, the greens are slick, and the nerves are shattered
(to Tin Cup) 'll take the bet
Oh, jeez
The Regulars cheer -- this is what they live for
Simms hands a roll of cash to Molly
Tin Cup hands her his car keys
Awright
What's the game
One swing each
Who can hit the longest seven iron -- It's a lock
hit the seven like John Daly hits a three
The Regulars whoop it up
Their man's a cinch
Tin Cup pulls a ball from his pocket, drops it right on the ground in the middle of the patio
From right here, okay
Fine with me
You guys are really being childish -- Molly, leave this one to me
Dr
Griswold,  know what 'm doing
Tin Cup takes a couple of swings to limber up, aiming out 65
onto an open area of the course
Serious, intent, the look of eagles
(to himself) Dollar bills
He takes a full back-swing, opens beautifully, and launches a seven iron like a rocket out toward some driving range markers
to "oohs" and "ahhs" from his faithful
The ball lands at a 170 yard marker and bounces further
Them signs are at least thirty yards farther -- that ball musta gone 220
That ball's about 2-2-7
toed it a bit
but it'll do
Nearly 230 with a seven
Pureed it, baby, he pureed it
Tin Cup hands Simms the seven iron
Take a minute to limber up, fine with me -- Don't need to
Simms is still in a sport jacket, slacks, no golf shoes
Take your jacket off
No, no, 'm fine
Simms drops a ball about where Tin Cup's sat
He stands above the ball and addresses it
(cockily) You're gonna need to muscle up, big guy -- give it the old steroid jerk
Simms is cool as ice
He smiles, then moves around to the other side of the ball, suddenly facing away from the course
This baffles everyone
66
What the hell you doin'
Wha's this
And David Simms hits an effortless seven iron out toward the desert, onto the lonely highway
59
and the ball bounces and bounces and bounces, for    59 About three miles, forever
It's probably still going
60                                                  60 The hustler's been hustled
She shrugs and smiles
: 61
-  ( )             61 Molly drives away in Simms' car -- followed by Simms in Tin Cup's Cadillac convertible
Simms waves
Tin Cup and the Regulars stand alone
Weakly, lamely, a couple of the Regulars speak
Without conviction
You the man, Roy
You definitely the man
: 62
-                                   62 nearly nude dancer named  on stage to a big Saturday night crowd
Tin Cup's in the front row, sitting with Doreen and a beer
Disconsolate
(
) Bring out those bills, boys, if ya wanta see a little more of Sammantha
Guys pull out singles and larger bills around the runway, placing them on the railing for the gyrating stripper
(to Tin Cup) Hey, honey
67
Tin Cup tosses some money onstage with a lackluster wave, he's depressed -- or something
Hey, honey
heard you qualified for the Regionals -- why you so down
broke my clubs -- don't ask why, my caddie's pissed off at me, lost my wheels in a sucker bet, and my shrink thinks 'm a fool -- 'cause  probably am
You're seeing a therapist
Yeah, what's wrong with that
Only way you'd ever go into therapy was if the shrink was a doll and you were trying to get her into the rack -- You're so shallow
The Good Doctor and  are dealing with my regression and denial -- Oh, Tin Cup, what a crock
You got a hard-on
from the next table leans over, interrupting
You `Tin Cup'
Won the Local with a seven iron
That's me
McAvoy
The Tin Cup McAvoy
There's only one -- thank God
Yeah
You looking for a game
68
No, but 'd sure like to show you my grip
Doreen can't keep his attention
Neither can Sammantha, who writhes only a few feet away
How long have you been seeing this `Good Doctor'
Excuse me, Dor', the man's having trouble with his grip -- The Guy slides over to Tin Cup, quickly joined by his buddies
See,  used to play a real weak grip
But you look at Couples, he's got a left hand way over here
Tin Cup glances at the guy's grip
No, grip it like this, so you're holding on with the last two fingers of your left hand
The Guy nudges the  next to him
See that
Tin Cup McAvoy says you grip a golf club like this, with these two fingers
Roy
(off no response) Roy
Tin Cup
Hello
The grip and address are about 90 percent of the golf swing, so pay attention here
When you're done with him, can ask you about my club position at address
Sammantha can't keep their attention, either, even though she's down to a -string, inches away
At the height of the , she stops dancing and looks down at Doreen -- 69
Am  doing something wrong
No, honey, you ain't -- but a healthy woman's only got two choices in this world of ours
(beat) Either fall in love with another woman -- or take up golf
And Doreen heads to the dressing room, disgusted, but not at all surprised
She knows Tin Cup -- she knows men
Now the stronger right-hand grip can help ya draw the ball, which  plan to do at the Regionals next week in Tulsa
just shift the hand over a little bit
blah, blah, blah
And naked women dance before them, unnoticed

But Romeo is missing
We get through the next 36 holes and we in the Open
got the yips and  ain't even teeing it up
Nothing to worry about, boys -- But you ain't got Romeo
Don't need him till the Open -- he'll be back
70
But you don't got the doctor lady
Oh no,  got her
Right here
He holds up a tape cassette
She can't travel to Arizona for the Regionals -- she's got a busy practice, y'know
so she made me this tape to play while 'm out there
keep me calm, cool, and collected
What's on it
little James Taylor, little George Jones, little Kahlil Gibran, little this, little that
and a lotta the voice of the smartest chick  ever met
The good doctor herself
Can we hear it or is it personal
Since when is therapy personal, eh
He punches into his deck and the Winnebago is filled with the sounds of ' , beginning with George Jones
and the voice of   takes us into

think three under will qualify
You need birdie

little more confidence there, Earl
wish Romeo was here
ain't cut out to do this

- 18TH  -                            75 Tin Cup surveys the thirty-foot snake of a putt
Earl's of absolutely no use
We need this one big time, Earl, whattya think
(unsurely) Looks straight to me
Straight
Thing's a roller coaster breaks four ways and dies at the hole -- you're blind
Actually,  am blind
20-60 in one eye -- and that's the good eye
got a blind caddie
just hold the stick, Earl -- and be sure to pull it out
Tin Cup studies the hell out of this putt
If it goes in, he's in the Open
He misses, back to Salome

Tin Cup shakes the Walkman and pounds his ears
Doc
Doc
(panicky) Earl, Earl -- the tape's jammed
She's abandoning me
Are you okay
Yeah, yeah
'm flying solo now
What
gotta make this putt
74
Obviously
Tin Cup stares endlessly at the long putt
just pick the line, feel the speed -- bad timing, doc, Jesus
He steps up to the putt, still talking to himself
Like a million others you made in your life, Roy
Just see it going in
Just feel it
right in the back of the jar
just pull the goddamn trigger, you pussy
76   He strokes the putt -- It starts right, curls back          76 left, straightens out, over the ridge, back again, endlessly
Pull the stick, Earl, pull it
Earl's having trouble with the flagstick, shaking it, panicking, and finally -- he snaps it free, but
The ball stops dead on the lip of the cup
Tin Cup contorts in anguished body-English, then falls to his back like a shot animal
Choking dogs die
And the  falls into the cup with a  -- and a Tin Cup takes a peek at the cup
The ball stays in the hole

Romeo is shafting glubs
Romes
You've come back
(no answer) You shoulda been there, Romes, drained a 30-foot snake to qualify
(off no answer) Earl gave me a straight read -- the thing broke half a dozen times -- missed ya, pods
Romeo gives him the silent treatment
Okay, don't talk to me -- but you're still my guy
(losing patience) It's a little late to be pissed off
We're in the Open
You and me
Still nothing from Romeo
Awright, be that way -- (switches course) -- say
has Molly been around
knew you had the hots for her
What's this
Garbo speaks
Of course  have the hots for her and 'm doing a damn good job of keeping things platonic and professional till  kick Simms' ass and show her  ain't who she thinks  am because, in fact,  am who she thinks  am but if  win the Open  won't be
Romeo stares back at that curious logic
Well,  don't think her nor me nor the God of Golf his self can keep you from blowing up in the Open
made it this far
just got to hold it together for 72 more 76
holes
There's a lotta triple bogeys out there waiting to grab your ass
(cheerily) You're complaining again
Romeo's back
Whining, bitching, pissed off -- you're my man
Silence
Some chagrin
You didn't fall in love with Earl to be your caddie
He was a wheezing heart attack waiting to happen -- cost me three strokes a side
(beat) carried my bag the last four holes
love ol' Earl but  need you
You don't love me
(exasperated) love you, too, God damn it
As much as Earl
don't know
Yes, yes, as much as Earl -- (beat) More than Earl
Am  special
If you can remove the sexual connotations and overlay a golf theme, Romeo --  am your Juliet
Romeo ponders it all
Muy bien, Julietta
In that case --  am your caddy once again

Podnuh
They shake hands
Awright
now that we got that bullshit outta the way, 'm gonna hit me some balls and start oilin' that sweet swing o' mine for the big boys
Romeo sits back in the shade, still washing the thousands of golf balls in the rack, watching as -- 79   Tin Cup drops a bucket of balls on the hardscrabble           79 ground, pulls out a club and limbers up
Nobody heard from Molly, eh
You got it bad, don't ya
Somethin' about that chick
Tin Cup addresses the ball and takes a swing
Everything looks normal in his swing, but
Thwock
-- the  squirls off to the side and against a fence
Ugly
Hmmm
little chili dipper there
Be sure to do that in the Open
Unfazed, Tin Cup steps up to hit again, but
once more -- Thwock
-- Another horrible-looking squib to the right
Romeo stops washing balls and notices, watching Tin Cup
Thwock, thwock
-- Something's terribly wrong
Concern crosses his face
Romeo
78
'm watching
It ain't no chili dipper
Yeah, boss, you got the '' word
What am  doing wrong
Shanks are like a virus -- they just show up
Nobody can figure 'em out
Thwock, thwock, thwock
-- Three more chili dippers
Our man definitely has the shanks
And he's panicking
Romes
Something's terribly wrong
What's your guess
It's the woman
thought you said it was a virus
woman can have the same effect
What do  do
Keep swinging
: 80
-   ( )                          80 Thwock, thwock, thwock
-- Night has fallen and he still has the shanks
The regulars have gathered and are huddled, murmuring
The word has spread like wildfire -- Tin Cup has the shanks
Never thought it would happen
The shanks is for us mortals, not 79
for the great ones
Esta muy feo
muy, muy feo
(It is very ugly, very, very ugly
) Tin Cup angrily throws his club out into the night and turns to the regulars
'know why they named this game 'golf'
'Cause the words 'fuck' and 'shit' were already taken
-- All heads turn to see: - pulls in -- Doreen gets out, carrying a big package
Hiya, fellas
What is this
Everybody like to watch a train wreck
Doreen approaches the regulars, and we notice for the first time that there are a number of bags and packages with the boys
He's in one of his pleasant moods, see -- He's got the shanks
We got the makings of a Greek tragedy here
(shouting to Tin Cup) Quit whining and get over here
We've got something for you
Tin Cup drags his sorry ass to the group
Unless it's a 'swing thought,' 'm not interested
(ignoring his attitude) We're here to sponsor you in the 80
Open
Me an' the boys have pooled our resources and come up with some cash so you can look and feel as spiffy as all them big-name pros
But  got the shanks -- Yeah, and you obviously still have a hard-on for the doctor chick -- your face is all screwed up and tight like you haven't been laid in awhile -- Is it really that obvious
It's not a good look for you
Roy, your heart is not the only organ you wear on your sleeve
There's a certain, vulgar appeal to your transparency
Tin Cup shrugs
She always has him outflanked
'mon, Tin Cup, we're trying to make you a presentation -- Awright, awright
She unwraps a tour golf bag -- Big gold and red lettering advertises "The Golden Tassel
" Pastie tassels hang from all over the bag
Doreen sets it down proudly
got the Golden Tassel to sponsor you at the Open
You expect me to pack that around
'm carrying the bag
It's worth four hundred dollars endorsement money to you -- Earl steps forward with a golf shirt bedecked with sewn on patches and logos
81
See, Dewey got you First State Banking of Salome, and Clint got you Short-Haul Trucking and  got you Brink and Brown sanitation -- 'm being sponsored by a sewage disposal system
We call it human resources management, Roy, please
Jose steps forward with a golf cap, also emblazoned
've got Wally's Smokehouse for ya -- kind of a nice sign
And since  couldn't get the post office to come aboard, me and my girl friend Muriel's gonna buy a fan club patch you can put anywhere you want
Doreen and the regulars look at Tin Cup proudly
'm supposed to wear this shit
This shit is us, man
You can't win without us
You're the pride of Salome
Hell,  won't even make the cut
What happened to your confidence
He's shanking his love life so he's shanking the golf ball
Must be true love
He's a goner
Tin Cup surveys all the bizarre sponsorship loot, and starts loosening up
These are his people, after all, 82
and they're behind him all the way
Look, everybody, this is great
'm sorry 'm acting so pathetic but my swing's never abandoned me before
just need a little time to work it out
Anything you want -- Give him some room, boys -- (to anyone who'll listen) Maybe it's my grip
maybe 'm opening up too soon
too late
coming over the top
no, dropping underneath
(beat) Oh, sweet Jesus, why have you abandoned me
(to the regulars) He's trying to talk to God
It's time for us to go
Doreen and the regulars quietly slip away to leave Tin Cup with his newly sponsored gifts and, more importantly, his newly lost grip, swing, and confidence
You want me to stay, boss
need to be alone
You got it
And Romeo herds the rest of them out to their cars in the lot
And as they drive away, Tin Cup sits down, his head in his hands

Tin Cup's Caddy convertible pulls up to the Winnebago

But Roy isn't driving -- Molly is
She gets out, goes to the door
She knocks
Roy
Anybody home
There's no answer so she tries the door, and walks in on: : 82

Roy "Tin Cup" McAvoy is wearing every gimmick that Molly first arrived with -- plus many more
He wears a pendulum cap, his arms are strapped together, a curious triangular coat hanger type contraption connects his elbows, there's a neck brace, an ankle anchor, an arrow attachment to his left hand, a bucket for right foot, he swings a collapsible club
and a loudly from his , so loudly that he never heard her knocking
My God
Aarghh
Roy
Dr
Griswold
moment of pathetic silence, then: Molly starts laughing -- He is destroyed
The therapist laughs at her patient
Is that how it works man is laid bare before God and he's the butt of the cosmic joke
'm sorry,  just
Some of this shit might actually 84
work, y'know
mean  think there's something to this hat with the pendulum golf ball thing
may be on to something here
Oh, Roy, Jesus
Quoting yourself, 'It is the paraphernalia for lost and desperate souls
' Tin Cup lets down
The wind goes out of his sails and he loses his defensiveness
Well, God damn
a lost and desperate soul stands before you
(beat) assume  have the confidentiality of doctor-client privilege in regards to this outfit
Of course you do
What happened
got the shanks
Are you taking penicillin
It can't be treated
It's much worse than whatever you thought it was
(beat) There's a glitch in my swing
So it's in Romeo's department
He thinks it's your department -- says it's a head thing
Oh
Well
just came over to congratulate you on the regionals and return your car -- David says he doesn't want it, just wanted to make a point with you -- (beat) But  suppose we could have a therapy session right here and now -- 85
don't want therapy
want you
Roy
gotta get some air -- Look at me -- (considering what that means) Well, not right at the moment -- but listen to me
You're with the wrong guy
'm the right guy
Everyone tells me my face is all screwed up tight as a drum 'cause 've been crazy about you from the day you showed up wearing this stupid stuff and the whole damn thing has both inspired me to get here on the verge of greatness yet it's also caused me to get the shanks which could humiliate me in front of a zillion people
(beat) Such is life
So dump that phony bastard and come to the Open in my corner -- you can delay your romantic urges, which  know are lurking in there among the excess of brain cells you possess -- until the appropriate time
(beat) Tell me you're not at least moderately attracted to me
Tin Cup stands there with the ball still dangling from his hat, the leather straps, the bucket, the arrows -- for the moment he's forgotten how stupid he looks
You have moments
Tell me which ones are my moments and 'll try to duplicate them
This is a moment
You look great
Now
Utterly exposed, completely vulnerable, the inner child trying to get out
86
My inner child needs spanking
You always liked that part about saddling up, the smell of leather -- 'mon, let's have a drink
Call it therapy
Charge me 75 an hour
Little Cuervo, little Freud
She's thinking about it
Naw
gotta go
(turns to leave) Oh,  don't have a car, need a ride
: 83
-                        83 Tin Cup and Molly in his convertible
He works on her without pushing too hard
know a spot along the river's great to watch the sunset
Not tonight
'Not tonight' means maybe some other night
didn't mean it like that
Consciously you didn't mean it like that -- but how about unconsciously, you're the expert, did you mean it unconsciously
Unconsciously, Roy,  don't have a clue what 'm talking about
feel we're making progress
87
do too
But  have no idea what it's progress towards
A84
'  -                                  A84 The Caddy pulls up in front of her office at the new mall
She gets out
Good luck in the Open, Roy
Put your money on me, Doc, the odds are fabulous and God knows 'm overdue
He drives away, and we stay: Watching Tin Cup careen away in his Caddy
: 84/85
-                             84/85 The intrepid Winnebago on the way to the Open
Romeo drives -- Tin Cup stares out the window
You got to relax, boss -- Goin' to the
Open with the shanks
Gonna be chili dipping my way around the course on worldwide television
sure, relax
'm gonna get rid of them shanks for ya
No hay problema
Molly and  are circling each other
can feel it
She the enemy, boss
Naw
88
Well she wakin' up with the enemy -- same thing
Tell me something, Romes -- the absolute truth -- you think  can go 72 holes without falling apart
Romeo keeps driving, pretends not to hear
You heard me
don't want no bullshit
do you think  can do it
don't know, boss,  just don't know
And Tin Cup puts on his Walkman, and stares out the window endlessly at a thousand miles of passing scenery, to the  of
: 86
-                                              86 The   out of the country heading east, and -- : 94
87
-                                87 The Winnebago heads out of the high plains
: 89
( ) -               89 The Winnebago passes through a "tunnel" of tall, old pines into a cathedral environment of old money and old golf
90
-                                           90 Romeo and Tin Cup stare out into the trees, the lushness -- a couple of wide-eyed kids
bet this is the first Winnebago they ever saw here
89
Yeah
and the first Mexican
The Winnebago pulls up to a guard gate -- comes to the window
banner hangs above the entrance a few paces past the security gate, proclaiming: "Old Pines --
Open Championship
" Yes
Como esta, amigo
have with me one of the legendary ball strikers in the history of golf -- The Security Guard strains to see in
Who's that
Mr
Crenshaw
That you
Mr
Price, Mr
Norman
No
Tin Cup leans across Romeo to introduce himself
Roy 'Tin Cup' McAvoy
Representing the great American Southwest
The Guard backs off quickly, turns to his
Do we have a
McCormack
on the list
McAvoy -- Roy McAvoy -- he's a legend
We got over 150 legends in this tournament
Sorry
Romeo starts cursing in Spanish
The Guard is unphased
Call the police
Police
The police quickly appear to take over the situation
Tin Cup leaps out of the Winnebago to argue his point
There's a mistake here, fellas
90
grabs Tin Cup and Roy is ready to fight
It's getting ugly real fast
We'll throw your ass in jail right now, pal -- there's a lotta lunatics here and we don't take chances
At that moment David Simms pulls in, driving a con- vertible sponsor's car
He sees the scuffle, gets out
What's the problem here
This clown says he's in the Open
Simms spots Tin Cup -- a delicious moment for him
Tin Cup wants to hide but he just gamely covers his face
Hiya, David
nice sweater
He's not on the list
Simms takes the clipboard with the list
Hiya, Roy
welcome to the big leagues
(checks the list) Here ya go, Charlie, his name's right here
(to Tin Cup) They spelled your name wrong -- easy mistake with a total unknown
(to Cop) Let him in
Simms smiles at Tin Cup, the easy smile of a man on top
Tin Cup doesn't respond, just asks the Guard: Which way to the practice range
As Tin Cup tries to regain some dignity, and climbs back into the Winnebago -- 91
(to Simms) He said he was a 'legend'
Oh he is
he's a very big name at a driving range in Salome, Texas
They all have a good laugh, and -- : 91
-                                    91 Lots of the big names are there
Romeo is like a kid at the ballpark
Look
Right there
Fred Couples
and Ray Floyd
Romeo notices that Tin Cup is staring at the pile of practice balls lying there on the tee
Look at these balls
Brand new Titleists
Lookit 'em, every one a brand new Titleist
(lowers his voice) Sneak a few in the bag when you get a chance
We swipe enough free shit we might even pay for this fiasco
Tin Cup limbers up, trying not to be in awe of the real legends who line the practice range, hitting beautiful shot after beautiful shot with graceful ease
You think it would be inappropriate to ask Ray Floyd for an autograph
think it's a dead giveaway, Romes
but if  still got the shanks we're gonna be found out real fast
Tin Cup nudges a ball from the pile into address position
Romeo hands him a different club
Hit the seven iron
You never miss the seven
92
Good thought, Pods
Tin Cup waggles, shakes, limbers, addresses
Dollar bills
And he swings
hideous shank squirrels across line, almost hitting a group of
Open officials
Heads turn
(to anyone who'll listen) Who hit that shot
Anybody see
He addresses another one
And swings
disaster
He crumbles
little thin, Boss
little fucking thin
still got the shanks
Everybody's watching
Christ, Simms is here
Simms has arrived and is watching Tin Cup with delight as he loosens up
Maybe we should work on putting
Ya can't shank a putt
Tin Cup pretends to limber a little more before daring to strike another ball
If you're the Mexican Mac 'Grady, Romes, you gotta figure out why 'm still shanking the ball
(beat) What's the problem
'm catching it on the hosel, right
Moving my head
'm laying off it, 'm pronating, 'm supinating, 'm clearing too early, 'm clearing too late, 'm off plane,  ain't dropping in -- oh, God, my swing feels like an unfolding lawn chair
You got a virus in your brain 93
got to kill the brain to kill the virus
Anything
Kill me now
Put all your change in your right pocket
Tin Cup follows orders, not questioning the logic
Very good
Now tie your left shoelace in a double knot
Again, Tin Cup dutifully follows orders
Esta bueno
Now, turn your hat around backwards and put a blue tee behind your right ear
'll look like a fool
What you think you look like hitting those squirrelly chili peppers up Freddy Couples' ass, eh
Do what  say or  quit
Okay, okay
Perfect
now hit a seven iron into that tree over there
You're ready
Tin Cup hits a perfect seven iron into the trees
How'd  do that
You ain't thinking about shanking, you ain't thinking about the doctor lady, you ain't thinking period
You just lookin' like a fool and hittin' it pure -- your natural state
Fuck you
94
You cured
That's it
That's it
Your brain was getting in the way
That's rarely been a problem
What now
Well,  should recommend you go work on your short game but think it's better if you go get drunk instead
Get drunk
Yeah
You always play better when you're wasted
Tin Cups stares at the swami, and -- : 92
(  ) -                     92 Again to   on the  , Tin Cup is doing a slow dance with his driver
Romeo sits on the couch, stone cold sober, pouring drink after drink for Tin Cup, who's thoroughly plastered
It's three in the morning, Romes, what time  tee off
Seven-o-five
first group off
Keep drinking, keep dancing
That's four hours from now
You're drinking till five
c'mon, c'mon, have another -- (a tough coach) Get you in shape -- 95
Tin Cup tosses down yet another drink, and staggers around the room with his driver until, finally, he collapses in a heap on the floor
Romeo looks down at him coolly, like horse trainer Wayne Lukas sizing up his Derby entry
Nothing like the sight of a finely-tuned athlete on the verge of greatness
Romeo tosses a blanket over Tin Cup lying on the floor
: A93
-                      A93 Two figures hurry across the lawn to the first tee
Our intrepid Don Quixote and Sancho Panza
93
-                               93 The first tee -- the early morning air is heavy and still
The course is quiet and wet with dew
The gallery is sparse
The silence is broken by the starter's voice
(
) With the honor in the 7:08 pairing, from Salome, Texas, Mr
Roy McAvoy
half-dozen people clap, and -- Tin Cup and Romeo stagger to the tee, barely making it on time
Tin Cup is massively hung-over and unshaven
No time for a bucket, eh
Almost missed the starting time trying to get you off the floor, boss
You don't handle the hooch like you used to
Tin Cup tries to get warm quickly, taking a few hurried practice swings
The early tee times are strictly for the longest of long shots, and almost nobody is around
Tin Cup's hand shakes as he closes the Velcro flap on his glove
He's wearing the hat and shirt with the sew-on patches, as he stares down the first fairway
Romeo hands him a driver
96
seen this hole on
Hit the big dog down the chute -- No, 've learned my lesson
Gonna play it safe, smart, conservative
Fairways and greens
Hand me the two iron
You sure
Thought of the day is -- `be humble
' And Tin Cup launches a two iron down the first fairway
: 94
-  ()                                 94 The scorer posts an eighty-three next to Tin Cup's name
Tin Cup stares, shell-shocked, as his score is posted
Eighty-three
Well, you humble now
Eleven bogeys and seven pars didn't make a three
didn't make one goddam three all day
You weren't trying to make threes
You were trying to avoid making thirteen
was hungover
Maybe that was a coaching error on my part
Thanks, amigo

David Simms is interviewed
(
) (on the television) 'm the last person who expected me to come out of the blocks with a sixty-seven and lead the Open
It's been a long time since played this game with the fire and determination you need to win
The Anti-Christ shoots 67, you believe it
Ol' Anti-Christ got a hot putter
(
) (on television) you see, this game is all about integrity and tradition and honor
What
It's about cheating and racism and bullshit
Easy, boss
: 96
-  ( )               96 Live coverage of the Simms interview
Molly is among a small crowd gathered to watch
He doesn't seem to know that she's there
(live on mike) So tomorrow 'll just go out there and try to make some good swings and, Lord willing, maybe  can put up another good number
Thank you
Thank you, David Simms, a brilliant opening round 67 to take the lead
Simms walks away, now off-camera
call out -- 98
David
David
Over here
Gotta go
Simms cuts down behind the tent toward the clubhouse, away from the galleries
The marshals open a rope allowing him to avoid the crowds, but -- An   with a young child are there
The lady has a tiny dog in her arms
Excuse me, Mr
Simms
(off no response) Can you sign an autograph for our grandson
(snaps) Can't you see 'm busy
'm working
This is my office
Do come to your office and ask you for an autograph
Jesus
He practically stiff-arms them as he passes, heading up to the clubhouse
They stand there in shock
(muttering to himself) Who the fuck these people think they are
the edge of the tent
Molly, trying to get to David, has seen the whole thing
She speaks to herself
Old people, children, and dogs
: 97
-                                   97 Simms enters to numerous congratulations from officials, caddies, other
Instantly, in public, he feigns humility with convincing flair
#1 Helluva round, Dave
99
Got lucky out there
#2 Great start, Simmsy
Simms stops when he sees Tin Cup and Romeo drowning their sorrows
Hey, Tin Cup -- heard you put a monster number up there
Coulda been worse
small bar crowd is enjoying Simms' taunts
played in the Pro-Am with some asshole movie star shot 82 here once
how did a great ball- striker like you, a `legend,' manage to shoot an 83
missed a four foot putt on the eighteen for an 82, that's how
It ain't like playing some muni track in Brownsville, is it
voice interrupts
Does, `integrity, tradition, and honor' include kicking a man when he's down
Oh, Mol', this is just guy stuff, bar talk, part of the game -- no offense, right, Cup
No answer
Tin Cup's about as low as one can go
(defensively) This man still has a lot of good golf shots in his system -- (trying to hide) Molly, it's okay, go away don't need any attention right 100
now
(to Tin Cup) You the guy shot 83
David, 'll bet you a hundred dollars right now that Roy here can hit a ball -- (looks around) -- from right here to
through that door to the patio
She points to a double door, forty feet away across, the bar, about an 8 x 8 foot opening
Molly, please
(to bartender) And give me a vodka tonic with a twist -- Molly, really, this isn't
dignified
Roy
wanta go back to Texas
What about the river, the piranha, the immortality
All that bullshit
You gonna drag your ass home with an 83
(looks around) In fact, two hundred says he can hit it through that door, over the patio, into the river, and make that pelican fly off that post
Everyone strains to look -- -  170 pelican sits on a piling in the river
Impossible
101
This is ridiculous
But Romeo's sizing it up
You got that shot, Pods, hood the seven, turn it over, start it low, right to left
Molly takes a swig of her drink and slaps some money on the bar
'm not leaving till one of you men starts acting in a manly fashion
Simms puts a hundred dollar bill on the counter
Let's just get this over with
One ball, one swing, one gull
Roy
Tin Cup still sits, head half buried at the bar
He's never passed up such an opportunity, but he's pretty low
You the man
He turns from his bar stool, glances at the situation
One swing
Four to one odds
'll make it ten to one
Stick it up your ass
'm leading the Open
Now we're talking
Manly men
Whoas
From the barside gallery
Tin Cup rises and someone hands him a club
Suddenly there's a crowd, including Gary McCord who's been watching from the far end of the bar
He grabs a seltzer hose as if it's a mike and begins announcing
McCORD He's looking at thirty yards of bar and grill, an opening through the French doors, forty yards of patio umbrellas, a 102
hundred yards of water, and a lonely pelican sitting out there in a 15 mile an hour breeze, south by southwest
(beat) He'll probably try to shut down a four iron -- no, he's selected his trusty seven iron
Tin Cup steps up to a ball lying on the carpet
Kind of a thin lie
Beats all that deep rough you were in today
Fore in the grill
Fore on the patio
You're the legend, boss
Tin Cup suddenly backs off the swing and turns to Molly
What is this all about
Shut up and hit the ball
McCORD (on "mike") The Ledge still has to be thinking about that brutal, ego-sapping, manhood-robbing eighty-three he buried himself under yesterday mean, that's just an avalanche of golf swings, a landslide, a pyroclastic flow -- Dollar bills
98   And he swings -- the ball rockets through the hall and     98 clears the open door
The bettors pile from the bar and grill and race to the patio to watch the flight of the ball, as -- It's carrying, it's hooking, it's carrying, then: -- It hits the piling
The  lifts off, angrily
Stiff, baby, stiff
103
99     whoop goes up -- And Simms storms out
99 'm outta here
You're all nuts
musta been blind thinking you were worth a shit, Simmsy
(raucously) Drinks on me, boys
Helluva shot, Roy
Actually  thinned it a little or that pelican'd be flying around with a Titleist up his ass
This is the old Tin Cup -- and he's in the clubhouse with an eightyfuckingthree

It pours down on the club and the beat-up

-                                       101 Tin Cup and Molly in bed, lit only by light spilling in from a parking lamp
They make love with enthusiasm, finally wobbling to a stop
Silence, except for the rain
Until: kinda shanked it, eh
No, no, no
you were great
Tempo is everything
Perfection's unobtainable
Mighta rushed it on the downswing
104
Come over the top a little
Yeah
well, as Walter Hagen once said -- 'Sex and golf are the only two things you can be bad at and still enjoy
' Let's take a mulligan and tee it up again -- They embrace with enthusiasm and start thrashing again
102                                                     102 Romeo's patience is getting thin
He pounds on the door
You guys done yet
This is no time for a marathon
The rain keeps coming down
: 103

-                                   104 in the booth
The sun is struggling to come out, the course is drying up, and in case you're just joining us, the leaders have just reached the ninth hole because of delayed starting times -- (beat) -- David Simms is clinging to a one shot lead over Peter Jacobsen
but the real story is out on sixteen where a driving range pro who shot an opening eighty-three is making a run at perhaps the most legendary round of golf in Open history, Johnny Miller's sixty-three at Oakmont -- Ben Wright is in the tower at 105
sixteen
: 105
-                                    105 We hear Ben Wright's voice as Tin Cup marks his ball on the green
small gallery has begun to follow him
(
) If anyone was ever to make a run at what is the most storied number in Open history, Miller's sixty- three, it would be today when the rain has softened the greens, enabling the players to take dead aim at the flags
Still, the unswerving courage of an unknown driving range pro from Salome has raised that humble journeyman from the ashes of an ignominious eighty-three to wave a mighty fist at the pantheon of golf's immortals
This man, this Roy McAvoy has laid siege to the record book by birdieing the first seven holes
brave par from the water at eight, and a glorious birdie three at the daunting twelfth, another at thirteen
Tin Cup gets his read, and steps up to putt
(
) this putt to go ten under for the day
Tin Cup putts -- When the ball is still two feet from the hole, Tin Cup raises his putter in triumph
and sure enough, the ball drops in the hole
: 106
-   -                          106 Golf fans stream from other fairways to catch up as: A107

The swelling gallery at the green roars

The regulars and several customers crowd the counter, staring up at the as Dewey rushes in from his job
They said on the radio he was ten under -- Shhhh
Silence, everyone watching the , everyone starting to contort in body-English, then: joyous roar -- Tin Cup's putt went down
Earl twirls with glee
He's shooting the lowest round ever
And eighteen's a par five birdie there, he shoots sixty
We gotta go, boys
We gotta get us on a Continental Trailways and find this damn place

McAvoy's hit another big drive, but this is not a shot he wants to get aggressive with
109
-                                109 Tin Cup and Romeo survey the shot -- a long downhill carry over a lake to a slightly elevated green
shot similar to the one he pulled off at the best-ball
Two-sixty to carry, Roy
You got to lay up, man
don't care how good you swinging
You got to lay 107
up
Tin Cup looks at the iron Romeo proffers
He looks back at the shot, throws some grass in the air, testing the wind
He looks at the gallery, the lake, the green, the whole grand setting
and then: He locates Molly behind the gallery ropes, watching
She makes a little charging gesture with her fist
And: Tin Cup reaches defiantly past Romeo and pulls out the three wood
110
-                                    110 Venturi and Nantz watch Tin Cup set up to play the shot
His adrenalin's gotten the better of him, Jim
If he lays up he takes bogey out of play
(') But if he knocks this ball in the water he could make seven or eight
And he still has to think about making the cut
Well, every golf fan in America is pulling for him
111   Wearing that look, the look of eagles, Tin Cup addresses 111 his ball
And he swings -- The ball arches off his club, the gallery roars, and
Nope
Tin Cup drops the three wood on his bag, even as: Carry, honey
Please
Carry
The ball plunks in the water inches short of dry land
The
Tin Cup smiles at Molly with chagrin but not defeat
He turns to Romeo
108
What the hell
You ride 'er till she bucks you or you don't ride at all
can save par from here
Tin Cup hits a wedge to within five feet
Up an' down
: 112
-                                     112 Tin Cup is on the dais, fielding questions from #1 How do you go from shooting an eighty-three one day to a record- breaking sixty-two the next
Well, it wasn't from clean living
Laughter from the reporters
Reporter #1 follows up
#1 If you had to do it again, would you still go for the green on eighteen
Yeah
And 'll go for it tomorrow and 'll go for it Sunday, cuz didn't come here to play for no second

Tin Cup is on the monitor, arriving at his ball
We hear  from the , encouraging him to go for the green
It's the same shot he knocked in the water yesterday
And the thing for him to do right now is to tune out the gallery, rein in his emotions, and forget what he said in yesterday's interview
He has to lay up
117
-                                117 Romeo palms the seven iron, waiting for Tin Cup to decide on his play
Gimme the three wood
Romeo picks up some grass and flips it in the air
It blows away from the green
There's wind up there
know
118
-                                  118 The announcers see Tin Cup taking out the three wood
Well, he hasn't shown an ounce of fear all day
This isn't courage, Jim
This is inexperience, pure and simple
119
-                                119 110
Tin Cup steps up to his shot
This is for Venturi, up there in the booth, thinking  should lay up
(addressing his ball) Dollar bills
He swings and holds the pose
He caught the ball perfectly -- it sails high and true into the luffing breeze, the  , and
the ball drops,
into the , a couple feet short of dry land
The
` Staring amazed, almost betrayed, that his ball didn't carry the water
That's a long fucking ways
(holds out his hand) Gimme another ball
Roy
What
It's a water hazard
You go up there and take a drop
Try to save par like you did yesterday
Tin Cup's eyes blink with thought as Romeo's words get through to him
You're right
What the hell was thinking
And he starts down to the water greets his approach, and he raises his hat to salute the fans saluting him

This is the Waffle House, Doreen -- Hell,  been dreaming of waffles for 1800 miles
They got a waffle house in Odessa just about like this
Odessa
It's in Midland, ain't it
No, it's in Odessa
They all pull up chairs and settle in for a long evening at the Waffle House
Tin Cup leans back in his chair, turns to Molly
It just don't get much better than this

You're looking particularly lovely this evening

Looking a little tight, Ledge
Musta got too much sleep last night
How you choking
116
Just got one thought in my head
Ten under
That's my number
Tin Cup looks up, amused by the gamesmanship
No one's ever been ten under for the Open, not even Nicklaus
That's right, Ledge
Not even Nicklaus
And he moves off to putt
Tin Cup drops a couple balls on the green to putt, and: ball rolls past them and into a hole
Tin Cup looks over and sees Simms
Sorry, Roy, can't believe  didn't see you with all that high-priced endorsement crap you're flaunting
That's always been your problem, Dave
You don't think about winning; you just want to look good
(turns away to putt) Thing is, this ain't a beauty pageant
(turns back, getting in Simms' face) And it ain't a rain-shortened Quad Cities or a Greater Greensboro you can back into
This is you'n me, pal
This is match-play, and this time you ain't getting no three shots

-   -                           125 large gallery surrounds the tree and lines the fairway as: With the honor in the final pairing, from Salome, Texas, Mr
Roy McAvoy
Boisterous applause
Tin Cup tips his cap and nods at 117
David Simms, his pairing in this the final twosome of the final round of the
Open
Fairways and greens, Dave
and don't forget to wave as  blow by
You mean blow up
Like you always do
And Tin Cup moves to the tee
His hand shakes worse than it did the first day as he tees his ball
Stepping back to line up his shot, he peers down the fairway through a narrow corridor of faces
daunting sight
He edges over to Romeo and tautly whispers: Do me a favor
Bet me a buck don't put it in the fairway
bet you a hundred
Okay, good
(going to tee off) Puts things back in perspective
: 126
-                                 126 Tin Cup looks at his ball, almost invisible in the deep rough
He tries to locate the green beyond the trees that surround him
In golf parlance, he's in jail
He selects a club
Which way you going
Tin Cup points over the trees
Romeo grimaces
Tin Cup addresses the shot
Then: Tin Cup swings -- the ball flutters weakly out of the rough and disappears into the branches of a bushy tree, dropping eventually next to its trunk, and: : 127                                                     127 scorer changes the number beside Tin Cup's name from -7 118

-                                         128 Tin Cup arrives on the tee where Simms now has the honor
Nice double, Roy
Just keep making pars, asshole

And  will own you
: 129
-                                       129 Molly and Doreen stand together behind the big gallery
Molly is using a cardboard periscope to look over the gallery to the green
Doreen is on her tip-toes but all she can see are the backs of heads
swell of cheers builds, then turns to groans
Oh no, Tin Cup ran it five feet past
(beat) How did he get the name 'Tin Cup'
(
) He played catcher on the high school baseball team
The star pitcher had this big-league curve, and not all his pitches hit Roy in the mitt
Finally, you gotta respect a man's doggedness
You know
(beat) The team decided Tin Cup sounded better than Clank
Molly puts down the periscope at that remark, and hands it to Doreen
'Clank''s not a good name for a man
119
Doreen looks through the periscope
'  - lining up a putt
She pans over to Romeo helping him
(
) Tell me something, Molly
have you ever had a Latin lover

130 The regulars study the board -- the scruffiest lot ever seen at an Open
Next to them stand a group of
officials, all in neat, matching blazers
The contrast is thrilling
Our boy's in trouble

Our boy don't choke
He fucks up but he don't choke
The scorer changes the number beside Tin Cup's name to -- -4
Simms is -7, and -- : 131
-                                         131 Wright looks at the monitor where Tin Cup stands among some trees
This is disaster for McAvoy
After losing three shots to par in the first four holes, he should have just taken iron off the tee to get the ball in play
Does he have any shot at all, Gary McCord
132
-                                       132 Tin Cup's ball lies on dirt next to the trunk of a tree
He surveys his options
Behind him, wearing a headset, McCord analyzes the situation for the  viewers
120
McCORD This is definite jail
This is life without parole
His only chance to stage a jail-break is go at the ball left-handed and hope he can somehow snake it back into the fairway, and save par from there
Tin Cup glares balefully back at McCord
Then he walks over to a nearby tree, and surveys the line to the green from it
He walks back for his ball, turns to McCord
and we see that familiar fierceness aflame in Tin Cup's eyes
Fifty bucks says  knock it on
with a seven iron
And he selects the seven iron, addresses the ball right- handed, and: He swings -- the ball rockets low off his club, and
it ricochets off the trunk of a nearby tree, and
it bounces up the fairway, skitters past a trap, and trickles onto the green, stopping ten feet from the pin
The gallery goes crazy as Tin Cup steps from the woods collecting his money from McCord while jabbing a taunting finger at Simms
133
133 Nantz and Wright stare at the monitors
That took balls
134
134 Simms ignores Tin Cup's taunt, and lines up his shot
(to himself) That's just Roy being Roy
Just wait him out, Dave
Just make pars
Let him make the mistakes
And he hits his iron to the fat part of the green, and -- (
) Beauty, Dave
Par written all over it

135 The scorer posts a -5 next to Tin Cup's name
Simms is still at -7, and -- : 136
-                                136 Tin Cup intently follows the flight of his iron shot, as: The ball lands near the front of the green, bounces, then rolls, following the contour of the green
It finally stops five feet from the pin
,   from the  accompanies the unfolding shot, and -- 137
137 Jacobsen looks toward the roar at the ninth green
He's making his run

(still watching Tin Cup) So why'd you leave him
You ever dated a guy who actually believes in soul mates
Actually, no
He thinks he's a tough guy, but he's a hopeless romantic
122
And as the gallery falls silent, she turns to watch Tin Cup

We gotta make birdies, Squeaky, or we are playing for second

Tin Cup seems to enjoy the taunt
That's right, Peter
You'n me
That's all there is

And he selects a club, and

() -                             146 Tin Cup's fans, deeply into the beer by now, contort with body-english and holler at the  screen
Get in there
Come on
Go down
They explode with cheers
Some twirl with glee
Others exchange high fives
He's tied for the lead again
And they're running outta holes
: 147
-                                   147 The leader board is superimposed on the monitor
McAvoy -8, Jacobsen -8, Simms -7
So it's come down to the seventy- second hole of this great championship, and the skill and courage of three Texans who have dueled throughout the day for the chance to be crowned Open Champion
Peter Jacobsen is on the fairway at 8 under, McAvoy at the 18th tee is tied at minus 8, and David Simms trails by one
148
148 Tin Cup and Romeo watch Jacobsen hit his shot
Jacobsen's laying up
(turning to Simms) You ain't gonna have that luxury, Dave
Not if you play to win
He moves to the tee, and
: 124
149
149 The monitor shows Tin Cup's drive bounding down the middle of the fairway
McAvoy's hit a perfect drive, Ken
'm not sure that's good news for McAvoy
With his inexperience, the last thing he needs is an excuse to fool with that water again today
150                                                      150 Tin Cup whispers to Romeo as Simms tees up
didn't catch it all
Then you got to lay up
Simms rips a drive down the middle, the ball landing a little short of Roy's
151
-                                151 Tin Cup in the fairway, studying his shot
So birdie wins it
He looks at Simms, ten yards across the fairway from him
You or me, Dave
Simms points to himself
He has a wood in his hands, but he puts the club back and reaches for an iron
Tin Cup edges closer to Romeo
(whispering) He's laying up
Birdie to tie, eagle to win, and that gutless wonder's laying up
(whispering) Par to tie, birdie to win
you lay up too, Roy
You can make birdie laying up
125
They watch Simms lay up
Then Romeo offers Tin Cup an iron, hoping he'll take it
You know something, Romeo
Eagle puts me ten under
No one's ever finished an Open ten under, not even Nicklaus
You don't need an eagle
Birdie wins, par ties
(firmly) Hit the lay up
Hole a wedge for goddamn eagle
Tin Cup throws some grass in the air, looks back at the green, the gallery, the whole grand setting
and he seeks out Molly's face in the crowd
He moves over so she can hear him
This is everything, ain't it
This is the choice it comes down to
This is our immortality
No time to be thinkin' 'immortality,' Cup
time to be thinkin' 7 iron
Molly stands with Doreen, hearing Tin Cup's words
Thrilled and terrified and spellbound, she finds herself nodding
Doreen, on the other is turning ash-white
Oh no
This is what always happens
He's going for it
Go for it
No
He just needs par to tie
Tell him to lay up
He listens to you
Go for it, Roy
Knock it on
This is why we split up -- he always went for it
My problem is 've never been with 126
a man who went for it
Well, honey, he's your guy
He selects the three wood
Romeo sighs
152
-                                 152 Good Lord, he's going for the green
This could be tragic
153
153 Tin Cup's eyes focus with the look of eagles as he addresses the shot
One swing, Roy
One good swing
Dollar bills
He swings -- the ball explodes off his club
Tin Cup holds the pose
We're home
Suddenly a gust of wind blows, out of nowhere, and Tin Cup's cap blows off, provoking immediate concern
little gust there, Romes
154                                             154 Picking up the flight of the ball approaching the green, carried it seems by the swelling roar of the gallery
The ball clears the water
and lands at the top of the slope fronting the elevated green
It pops up in the air, lands just past where it hit, and comes momentarily to rest
The gallery roars
And then: The ball starts trickling back down the slope, gaining speed, moving towards the water, even as the gallery screams for it to stop
127
until finally it disappears into the water with scarcely a ripple
155                                                  155 He stares first with betrayal, then with anger, and looks at Romeo, who just shrugs, then at Molly
You can still make par from up there -- She's right, Pods, a drop and a stroke, up and down par -- we'll win it in sudden death
But Tin Cup still has the look of eagles
He's staring at the shot he just made, still holding the three wood
nutted that thing
Little gust from the gods cost me
Helluva move you put on that sucker, now let's get up there, take the drop, and make our par, tie Peter
can make this shot
Not now
Now
Tin Cup throws another ball on the ground
'm playing it from here
Take your drop and make your par
Tin Cup addresses the ball
: 156
156 Venturi nearly comes out of seat watching Tin Cup take a 128
drop from his original lie
don't believe this
He just took himself out of the tournament with that drop
He could have walked up to the hazard line, saved par with a wedge and forced a playoff with Jacobsen
Now he needs a miracle shot
McCORD (
) Ken, 'm right behind McAvoy here
And all he said to his caddie was: can make it across
157
-                                157 Tin Cup swings again -- The ball sails long and true once again, and once again
158
it lands into the hill, bounces once, and trickles      158 back into the water
(
) Oh, my
This is tragic
159                                                   159 Holding his hand out to Romeo, as the gallery murmurs uncomfortably
Gimme another ball
watching behind the ropes
can't believe he's doing this
(unfazed) can, honey
He can blow the whole tournament
It's a miracle he lasted this long
129
: 160                                                     160 waiting at the green, amidst the rest of the gallery who's in shock about Tin Cup's decisions to keep going for it, keep trying to prove a point
He done blew a gasket, boys
The wheels is definitely falling off now
It was a miracle while it lasted
' Tin Cup swings a third time
: 161
-                                161 lands
in the , and
162                                                162 Tin Cup holds out his hand for yet another ball, saying nothing
Romeo hands him another ball
Tin Cup unloads another 3-wood
Another splash
Tin Cup holds out his hand again
This is your last ball, man
If this gets wet, you disqualified
can make it across
Tin Cup snatches the ball from Romeo's hand
163
163 Venturi and Nantz can barely look at the monitor
130
This is the most painful thing 've ever watched
McCORD (
) Jim, this is the last ball he has in his bag
If he doesn't finish the hole with it, he can't turn in a card
He'll be disqualified
Venturi and Nantz cover their eyes
Tin Cup unloads another three wood -- another splash
164                                                   164 He looks at Molly
She's just laughing
Romeo tosses down another ball -- Tin Cup launches his fifth attempt to clear the pond
Splash
You're right, Roy, what the hell
Let 'er rip
You two are made for each other
This is still all business to him
He sets his jaw, addresses the shot, and: Dollar bills
He swings -- another perfect shot
but this time the wind relents a knot, and: 165                                                           165 clears the water, clears the slope, hits the front of the green, rolls up toward the pin, and drops in the hole
The gallery goes berserk
166                                                   166 Raising his three wood aloft in triumph, he looks over at Molly and finally cracks a smile
131
166   :                                                   166 And when she smiles back, he takes his hat off and walks to the green, to as great an ovation as the game has ever heard
: 167                                           167 Venturi and Nantz slump, drained, over their monitors
: 168
'  -                                      168 Tin Cup and Simms sign their cards and get up to leave in unison
Simms turns to Tin Cup and has to shake his head
gotta hand it to you, Roy
When you go down, you go down in flames
Someday you can tell your grandchildren you finished second in the
Open
(beat) -- just don't tell 'em how
And he moves brusquely past Simms and out of the tent, congratulating Tubbs, the winner, as he passes
Good job, Tubbsy
you won it
And out of the scorer's tent
169
'                                            169 roar goes up from the milling fans as Tin Cup emerges
He tries to smile, but it's all dawning on him
My God
just gave away the Open
And then McCord is there, shoving a mike in Tin Cup's face
132
McCORD Ledge,  know it's tough to talk right now, but -- It's not difficult to talk
it's difficult to explain
coulda laid up and still won
made a twelve on the last hole of the
Open
You know how much money that cost me
McCORD Cost you a bundle
gotta get outta here
McCORD It was the greatest 12  ever saw
Back to you, Jim
Tin Cup exits the scorers' tent and runs into the regulars -- They're beaming, undyingly loyal
Greatest 12  ever saw
you crunched that dog, baby
gorgeous shot, etc
He looks up and there's Molly -- He stops short
They embrace
Molly, 'm an idiot
gave away the Open
The one time in my life know the play is to hit the lay up -- my whole life and future and career on the line, and still can't make myself do it am a twisted human being and a cautionary tale
And  guess 'm a fool
Yes
