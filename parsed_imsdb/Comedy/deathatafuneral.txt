He looks straight ahead with a somber expression
The camera pulls back to reveal he is watching ( ) place a coffin on a raised platform

: The living room has been prepared for the funeral service, with several rows of chairs laid out
Would you like to see
Aaron nods his head "yes", as  begins to open the coffin
Aaron crosses to the coffin
There's a dramatic moment as Aaron moves to the coffin and braces himself for what he's about to see
The coffin opens and Aaron stares long and hard at the body
Brian
who is that
Excuse me
Who is this man 'm looking at
'Cause it's not my father
Are you sure
Are you asking me if 'm sure  know what my father looks like
People make mistakes in times of grief
Man, look at the damn body
Brian peers into the coffin
We see it's an
Oh shit
The other undertakers look embarrassed
Come on, Brian
You know what my father looks like
He used to take you to little league
'm sorry, man
got a little nervous
This almost never happens
() 3
: (2) It's happened before
You mean this is a normal thing
This isn't Burger King
You can't just mess up my order
think  know where he is
You think
: - Close up of the casket opening
People look confused
The looking into the coffin speaks Chinese with subtitles
( ) That's not my father
: - better
,see my dad in this coffin in an hour, or you're going to take his place
The undertakers pick up the coffin and shuffle out awkwardly
Don't worry
'll get him, man
You do that
( ) My people, my people, my people
- Aaron enters the bedroom
His wife, , also thirties, attractive, is putting on makeup with a thermometer hanging from her mouth
Aaron stands looking dumbfounded
They brought the wrong body
Can you believe that
() 4
: (muffled because of ) The wrong body
Do they know where he is
They think so
They're getting him now
The thermometer beeps and Michelle removes it from her mouth
told you not to use Marshals
But no, you wanted to keep it in the neighborhood
know Swartz costs a little more, but at least they know where the bodies are
Michelle writes something down on a piece of paper as Aaron crosses the room and sits on the bed
You were right
Please don't rub it in, not today
've got so much to worry about
Michelle gets up and heads to the bathroom as Aaron takes out some index cards and looks them over
(') Dad insisted on having the funeral here, Mom's crying all the time, Ryan didn't help with anything, not like he ever does
Plus my eulogy sucks can't wait until this day is over
(
) Oh come on, honey
'm sure it's not that bad
If it is, at least Dad's too dead to hear it
Michelle exits the bathroom
Honey, it's going to be fine
() : (2) It doesn't matter what  write
All anybody's going to be thinking is "why isn't Ryan doing the eulogy
Even 'm going to be thinking it
She holds him close
Baby, you're the oldest
You have to do the eulogy
Besides,  think you're just as good a writer as your brother
You just need to let someone read your book
Aaronlooks away
Soon
It's not ready to be read yet
'm sure it's fine
Once the funeral's over, and everything dies -- Aaron gives her a look
(') Sorry
Look, once this is all over, you know your mom's thinking about selling the house, so you know we've got to get out
of here
Aaron looks a little uncomfortable and heads to the bathroom
(') You called them, right
Silence from Aaron in the next room
(') Aaron
You put the down payment on the condo, right
(
) said 'd take care of it and 'll take care of it
Michelle looks frustrated and crosses into the bathroom

- Aaron is at the mirror
You better, because  can't live with your mother anymore
've done my time, now it's time for your brother to take over
From now on, it's only Christmas and birthdays for us
Once we move, we can concentrate on your writing and our baby
Michelle gets down on her knees and starts unzipping Aaron's pants
Aaron pulls back
Hey, hey, hey
Are you serious
We have to do this today
Michelle is still on the ground
Yes
Today's the last day of this cycle
Can  at least find the body first
-   - We see '  speeding along the freeway
'  -  - , black, slightly heavier and riddled with anxiety, is driving
His friend, , an attractive, white, clean cut doctor, rides in the passenger seat
hate funerals
It's all death, death, death
don't think funerals are designed for anybody to really like
don't want a regular funeral
When die,  want people to celebrate my life
() Death at a Funeral 02/6/09 : Not me
want it to be the saddest day ever
want the stock market to stop
Schools to close
And no garbage pick-up
Derek starts to light a cigarette
You still smoke
You used to smoke
used to piss my pants too, but stopped
The only thing  want black is my skin
At least open the window
Derek opens the window very slightly
(') 've got enough problems of my own to deal with
() Yeah
What problems
told you
About the rash
Got to use condoms
on my hand
Still got to use condoms
Look at it
Norman pulls up his sleeve and makes Derek look at his wrist, but he doesn't take a great deal of interest
That's not a rash
What is it
() : (2) don't know, but it doesn't look right
Oh, damn
Norman continues to drive
Derek continues to smoke
(') If you hate funerals so much why are you coming
You know why
Come on, man, leave Elaine alone
can't
She's the one
So you're going to win her back over a dead body
If  have to
'  -  - , very attractive, 27, and her boyfriend , white, 35, are driving along wearing funeral attire
Oscar looks quite anxious as he keeps his eyes firmly on the road
Are you okay
Yeah, just a little nervous
About seeing my dad
just don't think 've ever been so openly hated by anyone before
He doesn't hate you
He just loved Derek
() 9
: Great
That makes me feel much better
At least you know it's not you, so try not to get so nervous when he's around
can't help it
He puts me on edge
feel like  owe him money
He's going to be more
concerned that his brother-in-law just died
He won't be focused on you
Anyway, when tell him we're getting married, he'll have to accept you
Elaine takes his hand
As they exchange a loving look, Oscar takes his eyes off the road for just a brief moment
Suddenly there's a
And we see a bicyclist flying over Oscar's car
Oscar screeches to a halt
They jump out of the car
Oh my God
Are you okay
The guy gets up
He's fine
Yeah, 'm fine
Are you sure
Is anything broken
'm so sorry
It was my fault
ran a light
Oscar starts hyperventilating
could have killed you
What if you had cracked your head open
'd have blood on my hands
Elaine shakes him
Oscar, calm down
() () () 10
: (2) (') You heard the man, he ran a light
Come on, let's get out of here before he wants to sue
She grabs him and pulls him into the car
- The camera is close on Michelle's head which is moving back and forth
We pull back to reveal Aaron
They are doing it standing up
What's taking you so long
just started
You want this baby as much me
Come on
'm trying
If  didn't want you to come, you would have done it five minutes ago
Do  have to do this today
The door opens and a  sticks her head in
Who's picking up Uncle Russell
-- Aaron and Elaine quickly pull apart
As the Housekeeper steps back out into the hall
Oh shit, Uncle Russell
Aaron fixes his pants as he exits the room
'   - Norman's cell phone
He answers
Hello
How are you
Okay
11
- need you to pick up Uncle Russell
'  -  - Uncle Russell
Damn
He's always in a bad mood
- It's not a mood if he's always in it
It's his personality
Can you do it
'  -  - Alright
'Alright
'll do it
See you soon
Bye
Norman hangs up irritated
- We see Norman's car exiting the freeway
- Aaron and Michelle are standing to the side as the undertakers place the coffin on the stand
Brian nervously lifts the lid and Aaron looks inside
() So is this your father
Come on, man
You know that's my father
Just trying to be professional
What up, Michelle
() Brian
() 12
: He closes the lid and all four undertakers quietly head off
Aaron looks up and sees his mother, Cynthia, has entered the room
Cynthia is clearly drained and tired
She stares at the coffin
Mom, how are you feeling
There were so many things we wanted to do
We were going to go to China
China
You don't even like Chinese food
That's not the point
haven't been feeling good
Who knows how long 'm going to live without him
It happens all the time
One spouse goes and then the next
mean, it might be different if  had a grandchild to take my mind off of everything
Cynthia, -- They all cross to the coffin
(cuts Michelle off) Come on, Mom
You're healthy
You'll be fine
You've got your friends and family
Cynthia, Aaron and Michelle stand around the coffin
Where is Ryan
Have you heard from him
He'll be here soon
Just seeing that boy's face makes me feel better
've missed him so much
My baby
() 13
: (2) She looks down at the coffin
Aaron turns away frustrated
Michelle gently touches the coffin
Do you need anything, Cynthia
Yeah, you can get your hand off my husband's coffin
You're leaving smudge marks
Michelle tries to wipe it off with her sleeve
- '  - : " " by
Elaine and Oscar are walking up the stairs of a typical college apartment building
'  - The music is coming from Jeff's speakers
, dressed for the funeral, sits at his desk
He's holding a pill bottle that says: "
" Yeah,  found them
The ones in the Valium bottle
Yeah
'll get them to you this evening
Can't do this afternoon
It's your fault you left them here
've got a funeral
My uncle died
Yeah, tragic
No,  haven't taken any saw what they did to you
What are they anyway
The doorbell rings
(') 've gotta go, my sister's here
'll take them with me and stop by after the funeral
Bye
The doorbell rings again
(') Hang on
Jeff stands up and we see that he's only half dressed for the funeral
He doesn't have any pants on
() 14
: He puts the bottle on the counter then crosses to the door and lets Elaine and Oscar inside
(') Hey, what's up
Do you always open the door half naked
Come on, Jeff
We're going to be late
've just got to put my pants on and 'm ready
Oscar is still a little shaky
(') (: ) Is he okay
Oscar's freaked out
guy on a bike ran into the car
It came out of nowhere
didn't see him
'm sorry
It's okay, baby
(then to Jeff) Go put your damn pants on
'm going
'm going
Jeff heads off to the bathroom and closes the door
Elaine spots the bottle of Valium on the table and picks it up
Here
Take this
: It'll calm you down
What is it
It's just Valium
(gets a glass of water) used to take them all the time
It'll make you feel better, promise
() 15
: (2) Are you sure
mean, 've got to drive
It'll be okay
'll drive, honey
Come on, open wide
She pops the pill in his mouth and hands him some water
Oscar swallows
Jeff returns wearing pants
Ready
Let's do it
Oscar and Elaine leave, Jeff surreptitiously picks up the Valium bottle, puts it in his pocket, then follows them out

- is in the entry way now shooting outside exits, leaving Ryan in front of the house
, Aaron's younger brother is taller, more confident, and more successful
He moves slowly towards  and through the front doorway as with him
Hello
Mom
- Michelle, Aaron and Cynthia are on the couch as Ryan enters the living room
Ryan
Cynthia runs over to Ryan and flings her arms around him
Aaron looks a bit lost in the background with Michelle but they walk over
know this is hard, Mom
But you're going to be okay
You always know exactly what to say, Ryan
'm so glad you're here
'm always here for you, Mom
() 16
: guess if people died every week, we'd see you all the time
Ryan turns to Aaron and Michelle
Aaron, how are you
'm alright
How was the flight
Okay
had to buy the seat next to me because  don't trust the airlines with my bags
And there was a lot of turbulence
guess that's the thing about flying first class
It doesn't matter how much you pay if the plane crashes, you still end up dead-- uh
Ryan realizes what he's said and stops speaking abruptly
It's too much for Cynthia who rushes upstairs
"End up dead"
Oh damn
'll make sure she's okay
Michelle heads off upstairs
- We see Norman's car turn into "Lakeview Retirement Community
" He drives past the sign and through a gate
' /
- Norman is driving behind three   on mobile chairs
He's honking at them
He finally sees Uncle Russell
There he is
() 17
: You didn't tell me the guy was in a wheelchair
, an elderly man in a wheelchair, sits in his chair
Norman drives forward and stops alongside the old man
He rolls down his window and speaks very slowly with a huge smile on his face
( ) Hello, Uncle Russell
How are you
We're here to take you to the funeral
Where the fuck have you been, you fat bastard
You're late
If you took any longer 'd be dead, too
The fake smile falls off Norman's face
- Ryan sees the coffin and slowly heads over with Aaron trailing behind
He stands over the coffin
It finally registers that his  is actually in there
It's hard to see Dad like this
But he's in a better place now
When does dead beat sick
guess you're right
This is why try not to get close to people
There's too much emotion involved
Well that explains why you never call
What do you want me to say
Some families talk to each other all the time, some just see each other at funerals
That's us
guess it is
() 18 : Ryan takes a seat in one of the chairs flanking the coffin
Aaron sits as well
(') By the way, 'm going to need that money
What money
The money for all this
the funeral
You're supposed to pay half
What about the insurance
That's Mom's money
What about the pension
That's Mom's money
Oh
So we're spliting the cost
Are we
Yes
We are
Oh, okay
So
don't have it right now
What do you mean, you don't have it
You just bought a first class seat for your bag
() 19
: (2) And that's why  don't have any cash
'  -  - Elaine is now driving, Oscar is sitting in the passenger seat looking a little spaced out, with Jeff in the back
Jeff leans forward
So, poor old Uncle Eddie
Yeah
But he was sick for so long
He's much better off now
Dead
Since when does dead beat sick
Shut up, Jeff
Jeff turns his attention to Oscar
love when you come to family functions, Oscar
Because then Dad focuses all his hate on you
There's no response from Oscar
He looks distantly out the window
The pills are starting to kick in
(') Oscar
Was there a dog in here just now
Elaine looks at Oscar very-strangely
What
He sniffs
Dalmatian
No, Schnauzer
beat
() 20
: What the hell are you talking about
Oscar falls silent and just goes back to looking out the window
'  - Uncle Russell is asleep in the back
Norman is looking for a parking space, but the street and long driveway are packed with cars
catering truck and flower van are taking up a lot of space
There's nowhere to park
Then the small flower delivery van pulls out
Derek points out the newly empty space
That truck is pulling out
Park there
Alright
Just as he's about to drive in, another car takes it
(') What the hell
- Norman gets out of the car
The other car contains Jeff, Oscar and Elaine
Jeff gets out first followed by Elaine
Elaine,  was going to park there
Are you family, Norman
Well, no, but 'm like family
No such thing
Derek leans out the window
Hi, Elaine
() 21
: What are you doing here
Your father invited me
Oh please
She grabs Oscar and heads to the house followed by Jeff
'  - Norman gets back into his car
Uncle Russell stirs
What's happening
Did you see that
She totally blew me off
The flower delivery van has been waiting to move forward
It's driver beeps the horn
said what's happening
Are we there
Norman turns around and looks at Uncle Russell
Aw, damn
have Uncle Russell
How could  forget about Uncle Russell
Derek has other concerns and the van beeps again
(') (to the Van) Yeah, alright
What the hell is going on
Uncle Russell pokes Norman with his cane
Ow
barely even looked
() 22
: Norman, now highly irritated, is forced to drive backwards
- Oscar, Elaine and Jeff are walking to the house as other people arrive
It's very green here, isn't it
Green
Very green
Very
green
Elaine takes Oscar to the side
Oscar, are you alright
What do you mean
All this talking about phantom dogs and things being green
What's going on
What are you talking about
' fine
Never been greener
Oscar wanders off, leaving Elaine with Jeff
Elaine, what's wrong with Oscar
don't know
Something's not right
: Oscar as he wanders around the yard
(') think it's the Valium
Valium
gave him a Valium at your place think he's just not used to it
Oh, right
() 23
: Jeff's face reveals his realization of what's happened
He walks off, leaving Elaine watching Oscar
- Norman's car is almost at the corner still being forced backwards by the flower van
We see that Derek is still lost in his own thoughts
Uncle Russell is poking at Norman with his cane
You're going the wrong way
Ow
That hurts
Stop the car, Norman
What
Stop the car
have to speak with her
have to speak with Elaine
Norman reluctantly stops the car
Derek gets out
What about Uncle Russell
need help with Uncle Russell
It's too late
Derek is gone
The van in front of Norman honks the horn
What's going on here
Where are we
We're going to be late
Russell hits him on the arm with his cane
Ow
Can you please stop doing that
The van keeps beeping
Norman backs up
- Ryan is standing with Aaron
They greet the mourners
() 24
: ( ) Nice to see you again
The mourner shakes hands with Ryan then walks away
(') Who are all these people
don't even recognize half of them
It's your family
You don't recognize them from the last funeral
Ryan looks around the room
So what side of the family is he on
Who
The guy in the leather jacket
Ryan looks around the room and sees a     () approaching the coffin
have no idea
Maybe a friend of Dad's from work or something
Aaron turns to Ryan
(') So, you're telling me 'm going to have to pay for the whole funeral
No 'm telling you you'll have the money in a few months when  get my advance
'm not a God damn credit agency
, a very calm, serene woman, suddenly appears
Aaron, how are you
() 25
: (2) Yes, um
We're just waiting for everyone to arrive, then we can get going
know you're in a hurry
Yes,  have two more funerals and a Christening
don't know what it is about the Spring, but they're either coming in or going out
She laughs, but Aaron and Ryan just look at her
Reverend Davis stands there waiting to be introduced to Ryan
Have you met my brother, Ryan
Ah, the writer, of course
must admit  squeezed this job in because wanted to meet you
'm reading "Mama's Secret" right now
Don't tell anybody, 'm not supposed to be reading that kind of stuff
'm sure the Lord will forgive you
Aaron is irritated
( ) You must be very proud of your big brother
He really made something of his life
( ) can't wait to hear your eulogy
No, no, 'm doing the eulogy
Oh
thought
Aaron is the oldest
The reverend tries her best not to look disappointed
Great
Well, 'll just make sure have everything  need
() 26
: (3) She looks at the coffin and then at the Bible in her hands
(') We've got a body and a Bible
Well, 'm all set
She walks off
Look,  think you should do the eulogy
Everyone's expecting you to do it
No, they're not
You're the oldest
You should do it
Look most of the people are here for Dad, but let's not kid ourselves lot of them are here to hear your eulogy
So imagine how surprised they'll be when they hear yours
Ryan walks away
- Cynthia is helping prepare the food to go
out
Michelle is in the background at the sink
, Cynthia's brother, a middle aged doctor, approaches
How's my little sister
'm trying to hold it together, Duncan
He was a really good husband
My friends always told me about the crap their husbands put them through
never had to deal with any of that
Remember when Uncle Matt got that nanny pregnant
That was horrible
() 27 : They don't make 'em like my Edward anymore
good husband and a great father to two healthy, strong boys
Michelle cringes in the background
( ) 'll make you a cup of coffee, Cynthia
Coffee can do many things Michelle, but it can't bring back the dead
Beat
Tea
- Aaron finds a quiet place in the hallway and pulls out his notes
() "My father was an exceptional man
My father was an exceptional man
My father was an exceptional man
" Michelle approaches him
Honey, we still need to finish that thing
Remember today is the last day
Can we talk about this when there's a little less death in the air
No
No we can't
Honey, 'm just not in the mood
don't have any panties on
() 28
: What
You don't have any panties on
It's my father's funeral
'm just trying to help you out
'll put them back on before the service starts
Now come on
They turn
Aaron looks around the corner into the living room and sees the four foot six man standing by a table
Aaron stops Michelle
Babe, don't make it obvious, but that guy in the leather jacket standing by the wall
Don't look
Don't look
Don't look
Michelle catches a glimpse of the guy
(') Do you recognize him
Isn't that the guy from the Home Depot
No,  don't think so
Don't look
Don't look
Did he put in the cable
No, no, that's not it
He keeps looking at me
Don't look
Don't look
He's probably just a friend of your father's
'll meet you in the garage
We have a few minutes before Uncle Russell gets here
Michelle walks off
Aaron peeks around the corner again and makes eye contact with the four foot six inch man, who seems to be staring straight at him
Aaron averts his eyes and heads off
29
- Norman parks the car and gets out
He goes to the trunk and removes the wheelchair
What are you doing
Be careful with that
Uncle Russell bangs his cane on the floor impatiently
(') Hurry up, we're late
Norman slams the trunk closed
- Aaron tries to get across the room as Michelle heads into the kitchen
Ryan stops Aaron
Oh, Ryan can you keep an eye out-- God damn, that Martina has grown up
: , nineteen and attractive
Are you talking about Little Martina
She was like a teenager when  left, and now she's
you know
She's like damn
Aaron looks distastefully at his brother
Can you keep an eye out for Uncle Russell
think  should go see how she's been
Yeah, why don't you do that
See if she wants a juice box
() 30
: Ryan heads off towards Martina
Aaron continues across the room
(
) Hi there
Aaron turns and finds himself cornered by Frank
Hello
was really sorry to hear about your dad
He talked about you a lot saw your wedding pictures
Your wife's dress was very beautiful
Aaron is a little uncomfortable
Uh
thanks
Did he ever mention me
Frank
Frank steps forward and holds out his hand
Aaron shakes it
Frank
don't think so, no
Were you a friend of his
Something like that, yeah
Michelle sticks her head out of the kitchen
Honey
Can  see you for a moment
Well, nice to meet you
Thanks for coming
Aaron walks away, leaving Frank alone
- : Norman struggles to push Uncle Russell up a hill
() 31
: Come on, put your back into it
You're supposed to be a young man
Don't you have any strength
- Aaron has almost made it across the room when he is intercepted by Reverend Davis
think we should get started
really have to leave at three
Sure
Can we just wait five minutes for my Uncle Russell
We can't start without him
Of course
- Elaine and Jeff are talking to some mourners
It's so nice to see you
'm so sorry to hear about your uncle
But he's in a better place now hear Ryan is doing the eulogy
Oscar, carrying a leaf, interrupts the conversation
Look
Isn't it beautiful
He wanders off again
Elaine doesn't know what the hell is going on
Elaine, can  speak to you for a minute
(to the mourner) 'll see you inside
Jeff takes Elaine's arm with some urgency and moves off to the side
() 32 : (') What
What is it
have to tell you something and, 'm warning you in advance, you're not going to like it
Elaine looks at Jeff concerned
- Aaron is intercepted again by Duncan who is talking to Ryan
Aaron
How are we doing on time
As soon as Uncle Russell gets here we'll be ready to start
So what's this  hear about Ryan not doing the eulogy
was just telling him how much 'm looking forward to hearing your eulogy
That's a shame
mean, 'm sure you'll be good, Aaron
It's just with Ryan being the writer of the family
Yeah
There are people here that don't even know your father
They just came to hear Ryan
Would you excuse me
Aaron walks away
( ) So any new books coming out
just finished "Black Hurt
33
- Aaron closes the door behind him
Michelle is waiting
They start kissing and pulling at each other's clothes
Aaron stops and leans on the door and sighs
Are you alright
Every single person wants Ryan to do the eulogy
He was my father, too
'm supposed to do the damn eulogy
'm the oldest
Where was Ryan when was taking care of Dad
Calm down
Calm down
Forget about everyone
You're going to do the eulogy and it's going to be the best eulogy anyone's every heard
Now could you please do me a favor and get me pregnant
Come on, do  have to do this today
Yes
What do you want
You want me to talk dirty
'm gonna suck it
'm gonna to suck it
Before Michelle can continue her  rated dirty talk, there is a knock on the door
Is there more soda in here
Yes
Come in
Michelle is frustrated
- Elaine is looking at Jeff in absolute shock
What do you mean it's not Valium
() 34
: mean what you thought was Valium, wasn't actually Valium
It's a hallucinogenic
Like, acid, mescaline
Special
Oscar moves in the background behind Elaine and Jeff
Elaine looks at him
He's making strange contorted expressions with his face and pointing at the sky
Other people are starting to notice him and think he's slightly odd
This isn't funny, Jeff
'm not being funny
Look at him, he's high as a kite
Oscar sticks his head into a huge bush
What the hell are you doing leaving that stuff around your house
friend left it
And who the hell just goes into someone's house and takes pills
thought they were Valium
(takes a deep breath) What am  supposed to do
Should tell him
No, don't do that
It'll just freak him out
We'll just keep a close eye on him, and make sure he doesn't get out of control
And don't let him spend too long talking to one person
or bush
Oscar wanders into the front door
Elaine quickly follows him
Jeff reluctantly follows Elaine
Derek arrives in time to see this and follows as well
- Oscar wanders in, followed by Elaine and Jeff
Duncan sees them enter and approaches them
() 35
: Hi, Dad
How are you
She gives him a kiss
Not bad considering we're at a funeral
Jeff steps forward
Hi, Dad
He shakes his hand
How's Pepperdine treating you
Is Professor Clarke still giving you a hard time
No, no
It's all worked out
Don't worry
'm not worried about you
Duncan looks pointedly at Elaine, irritating her
Duncan looks at Oscar who is in the background
(') So  see you brought your friend
He's my boyfriend
And you know his name
Derek approaches
Doctor, how nice to see you again
Derek
How are you doing at the hospital
Great
Great
We should have lunch soon
'd love to hear what you think about the new pediatric wing at Cedar's
() 36
: (2) Definitely
Maybe Elaine would like to join us for lunch
They both look expectantly at Elaine who looks away disgusted
Cynthia comes up to them and kisses Elaine and Jeff hello
Oscar stares at her
Elaine
Jeff
good to see you
'm so sorry, Auntie
We're going to miss Uncle Edward so much
Yeah
He was a great guy
Thank you
Oscar, this is my Aunt-- Oscar grabs Cynthia in a tight hug
'm so sorry about
the death
He sings "Amazing Grace" softly as Duncan, Derek, Jeff and Elaine look on
(') Amazing Grace / How sweet the sound / That saved a wretch like me
Cynthia untangles herself from Oscar
She heads back outside
Duncan gives Elaine a look, then heads off after Cynthia
What are you going to do
don't know
can't leave
Aunt Cynthia would never speak to me again
Jeff notices that Oscar has left
He rushes outside
Elaine follows
Derek follows suit
37
- We see Oscar emerging from the front doorway followed by Jeff
Then comes Elaine
Jeff approaches Oscar and stands with him as Elaine watches from the doorway
Derek walks up
You look nice, Elaine
'm dressed for a funeral
Yeah, but you make death look sexy
She looks at him
(') So,  heard about the engagement
Hey, hey
don't really have time to deal with whatever happened between you and me
But  have not told my dad yet, so  would appreciate it if you would keep your mouth shut
Sure
Anything for you
Derek looks over and notices Oscar looking bewildered
(') So that's him
That's the man you're going to spend the rest of your life with
Elaine looks over at the drugged up Oscar
Oscar leans over like he's on a nod
Jeff leans down with him, watching
Right before Oscar falls over, he comes up really fast
- Then he starts walking
Yep, that's him
Oscar who has been walking in circles with a look of awe on his face, changes direction and flies by Elaine and Derek back into the house with Jeff in tow
() 38
: Elaine
, - Elaine follows the guys, leaving Derek behind
- Aaron is straightening his tie and practicing his eulogy
My father was an exceptional man
My father was-- Frank again approaches Aaron
Actually, there's something 'd like to talk to you about
when you have a minute
Aaron hears Uncle Russell in the background
Yeah, that's great
Do you mind if we do it later though
My uncle just got here
Sure
Aaron heads off
- Norman pushes Russell up the stairs close to where Derek is standing
He looks like he's about to collapse from exhaustion
Norman lets go of the wheelchair and catches his breath
Derek grabs the chair blocking Norman from view just as Aaron arrives
Thank you, Derek, you're a life saver
Hope it wasn't too much trouble
No problem at all
Aaron wheels Uncle Russell inside
How are you doing, Uncle Russell
() 39
: Terrible
Derek follows, leaving Norman standing there out of breath
Can  get a little help
- Aaron enters and nods to Reverend Davis, who stands at the front
Ladies and gentlemen, could you all kindly take your seats
We're about to begin the service
Ryan helps Martina to her seat
Jeff keeps an eye on Oscar
Elaine grabs Oscar and drags him to a seat
Aaron wheels Uncle Russell to his place
Move
Move
He pokes people with his cane
Aaron then takes his seat with Michelle
Oscar is not looking so good
Ryan finally ends the conversation with Martina and heads to his seat
Reverend Davis is about to start, but waits as Norman, sweating, pushes through the crowd to his seat
The reverend waits for the disturbance to end, so Norman attracts the attention of everyone
Norman takes his seat next to Derek
Derek leans away
( ) You stink
Family and friends, we're gathered here today to mourn the passing of Edward Barnes
Yeah, well, you left me to push Uncle Russell up that damn hill all by myself
Then took all the credit
() 40 : Elaine, turns around
Norman, shut up
Elaine turns back around
Norman is irritated by this
'd like to start with a favorite passage of Edwards from First Samuel chapter 18, verses 1-4 in the King James Bible
() "And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul
And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house
" While the reverend is talking, Norman pokes Elaine on the shoulder and leans forward
() Hey, Elaine,  know you don't think 'm part of the family-- 'Cause you're not
() but when you dissed me back there, had Uncle Russell in the car
Aaron, disturbed by Norman's whispering, looks over
(') () You stole my parking space, and  had to push him half a mile up a hill
We almost missed the service
Aaronlooks over again
() Look, Norman, if you poke me one more time, 'm going to kick your ass
() 41
: (2) ( ) What the hell is going on
() She stole my parking space
(whispers to Norman) Stole your parking space
My father's dead
Act right
Reverend Davis looks at them then continues her speech
"Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul
" As she speaks, Norman looks at his wrist, worried
The woman sitting next to him smacks his wrist down
: Elaine looks at Jeff who watches Oscar
Oscar is fidgeting and looking worried
: Aaron and Michelle
Aaron looks worried
(') "And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword and to his bow, and to his girdle
" : Oscar is laughing
Elaine tries to control him
(') And now we'll have a few words from Edward's son, Aaron
Ryan's older brother
: Aaron as he gathers himself
Michelle gives Aaron a supportive squeeze of the arm
Aaron looks over and sees Frank staring at him
: Uncle Russell
Why isn't Ryan doing the eulogy
This is bullshit
() 42
: (3) Aaron arrives at the front and looks out across the expectant crowd
He's extremely nervous
Good afternoon, everyone
(his voice cracks) Thank you for coming
never realized Dad was so popular
It looks like he's got more friends now that he's dead
Blank faces stare back at Aaron
Cynthia looks pained
Everyone is silent except for Oscar who laughs loudly
Elaine silences him with a look
Aaron composes himself and pulls his notes out
(') My father was an exceptional man
He was born in 1938
He grew up in Alabama on a farm
He loved to take long walks in the woods with his close friend, Bobby
He told me how they spent their summer days riding their bikes through the fields and swimming in the lake
As Aaron speaks, Reverend Davis looks concerned because the eulogy is so bad
She looks to Ryan who looks like "what can do
" Jeff looks more concerned with Oscar, whose face is contorted with pain
He looks like he's going to burst
: Aaron
(') Dad's first job was working after school as an assistant to an electrician named Mr
Thompson
Back then, Blacks weren't allowed to wear rubber gloves
So my father got shocked a lot
Because of that, he had no feeling in his fingertips asked my Dad what his first boss was like
The drugs have gotten the best of Oscar
He suddenly grabs Elaine's arm
Aaron keeps talking
Did you just see that
() 43
: (4) See what
The coffin just moved
What
'm telling you  saw it move
Aaron becomes vaguely aware of the disturbance, but battles on with his eulogy
He said he was a nice man, and surprisingly well dressed
When Dad was eighteen, he left home after an argument with his father
He never told me what that argument was about, but  do know that after leaving South Carolina, sadly he and Bob lost touch and never saw each other again
Dad went to college where he studied accounting, a decision which lead to a career in corporate finance
But his real passion was for the arts, with a particular fondness for theatre, dance and musicals
He was a charter member of the Negro Ensemble Company and contributed regularly to the Alvin Ailey School of Dance
Oscar's protests are getting louder
Duncan looks back at the disruption with a disapproving glare
Elaine looks at Jeff who watches, concerned
There, look
It happened again
Oscar, please- People start looking at Oscar, who's becoming increasingly vocal, and looking increasingly like someone on acid
That coffin's moving
() 44
: (5) () Oscar
Just calm down
Aaron looks over to Oscar
() The coffin's moving
Michelle looks worried
Cynthia watches silently
Oscar jumps up
Aaron stops the eulogy
Elaine is about to die from embarrassment
(') There's someone alive in there
Oscar, please sit down
Oscar ignores her and walks purposefully towards the coffin
People watch him in astonishment, including Jeff
What the hell is wrong with you people
Oscar approaches the coffin as Aaron steps off the dais
Elaine tries to hold Oscar back, but she can't
() Oscar, where are you going
What are you doing
There's someone moving in there
Can't you see
Oscar tries to open the coffin
Aaron and Elaine try to restrain him, but can't
tussle begins
Ryan jumps in to help
What the hell is wrong with you
Ryan, no
() 45
: (6) Elaine attempts to grab Ryan
Duncan stands up and tries to help
Get away from there
No,  have to show you
He's alive
He's alive
The scene descends into absolute chaos with people pushing and struggling
Finally, the coffin falls off the platform and tips over
The dead body of Edward rolls out onto the floor at the feet of Cynthia
Cynthia screams
Aaron freezes in shock
Michelle takes Cynthia through the kitchen
The living room is left in chaos
- Elaine drags Oscar out the back
Jeff follows
- Cynthia, in tears, enters accompanied by Aaron, Michelle and Reverend Davis
It's alright, Cynthia
It's alright
She sits in a chair crying uncontrollably
Aaron is so angry, he just marches out
- Some  grab the body and put it back in the coffin
Aaron comes out of the kitchen and heads to the back yard
As they put the coffin back on the stand, Ryan addresses the crowd
Please let me extend my apologies to you all
understand the incident you just witnessed was quite shocking, but everything will be
returned
to it's proper place
Please enjoy the refreshments, and we'll call you when we're ready to continue
() 46
: It wouldn't have happened if Ryan had done the eulogy
Aaron exits through the garden door
- Aaron storms out to Elaine who is trying to comfort Oscar
He's looking very disturbed
Jeff is also there, looking guilty
Elaine, what the hell was that
'm so sorry, Aaron
Oh, okay
My dead father's sprawled out on the living room floor, but it's okay, you're sorry
But the coffin was moving
Please, Aaron
Go back inside
'll explain later
An annoyed and confused Aaron turns and walks back to the house
He's almost to the door when Michelle arrives
-- No,  haven't made the call about the down payment yet
wasn't going to say that
No 'm not going to have sex with you
wasn't going to say that
What were you going to say
() 47
: () Hi
He goes inside leaving Michelle standing there
Duncan comes out and heads for Oscar
'll kill him
Elaine tries to keep Duncan away from Oscar, who is stressed enough and looks terrified
Dad, leave it alone
Leave it alone
He just knocked my brother-in-law out of his coffin
It wasn't his fault
Yes it was
My sister is in tears can't believe you brought this idiot
don't ever want to see him again, do you understand me
can't do that
Why not
Because we're
moving in together
Duncan looks over at Oscar, who looks like he's just seen a ghost
He's struggling to stand up straight, with Jeff who's doing his best to look after him
Are you crazy
Dad, this isn't actually what he's like
He took some drugs and-- Drugs
Is he on the pipe
() 48
: (2) Jeff looks over, his eyes pleading with Elaine not to tell on him
No he's not on the pipe
He took some Valium and had a
bad reaction
Jeff looks grateful
Valium
That's not a Valium high
Your mother was on Valium for forty years
She never knocked over a coffin
Dad, please
just want to point out that you won't see Derek knocking over a coffin
Not right now, Dad
Fine
've got to check on Cynthia, but this isn't over
Duncan walks back to the house
Elaine walks over to Oscar who is hugging a tree
Oscar
Elaine
Come and sit down
- Aaron talks to a mourner
Norman comes up and hugs him
Are you alright
That was insane
He just fell out the coffin like a dead fish
guess its not much of a metaphor when you're talking about a dead human, but-- () Death at a Funeral 02/6/0
9 49
: Aaron looks at Norman
Norman, please
Oh yeah
Sorry
It's just that you never know when it's your time
Like, have this weird thing on my wrist
've had it for a few weeks now don't know what it is-- Why don't you show it to my Uncle Duncan
He's a doctor
He is
Great
Thanks
Norman walks off toward the kitchen
He passes Uncle Russell and Ryan talking to Martina
read your last book, "Black Hurt
" Good, good
Thanks a lot
'm not giving you a compliment you arrogant bastard
What a load of bullshit
wouldn't wipe my ass with it
Ryan leads Martina away from Uncle Russell
-   - Oscar, Elaine and Jeff are standing together
swear it was moving
must be losing my mind
(looks at his hands) Why are my hands so big
Oscar, listen to me
need to tell you something
Elaine sits him down on the bench
() 50
: What is it
Now
You remember  gave you some Valium earlier
Yes
Well it turns out that it wasn't actually Valium
Oscar just looks at Elaine
Jeff slinks off into the background
(') Can you hear me
() Hello
- Cynthia is being comforted by her friends and Duncan
Norman enters and beckons Duncan over to the side
Hello, Doctor,  know this is a bad time, but 've got this thing on my hand
've had it for weeks now
Duncan is looking at Norman incredulously
(') What do you think it is
Cynthia stands up
Duncan, 'm going back now
She exits
Reluctantly, Duncan answers Norman
You should probably go see a dermatologist
He turns to follow his sister out, but Norman pulls him back
() 51
: Really
Why
What do you think it is
don't know
It looks like some kind of pigment mutation
Duncan walks further out of the room
Pigment mutation
Duncan turns again
You're probably just allergic to something
Maybe from shellfish, nuts
Duncan heads further out of the room, but Norman won't give up
Nuts
What kind of nuts
Duncan turns around again
don't know
Pecans
Peanuts
Excuse me
Duncan finally exits, leaving Norman looking shocked and terrified
( ) pigment mutation
-   - Elaine is trying to explain to Oscar
Do you understand
Hallucinogenic
Oscar recoils
He turns to Jeff
Yeah, now, the best thing to do is relax and just go with the flow
Try and enjoy it
() 52
: Oscar stands up, panicked and grabs Jeff by the lapels
We see the bottle of "Valium" falls out of his pocket
You
Oscar
She tries to pull him off Jeff
How long does it last
don't know
eight hours
Eight hours
Of this
Oscar let go
She pulls him off Jeff
: Derek watching from the window
'm going to be sick
: Derek smoothing his hair seeing his opportunity
: Oscar runs inside
Elaine follows with Jeff in tow
Oscar
Come back
They head into the house
- Derek has been looking at Elaine outside and waiting for his moment
Elaine comes rushing in following Oscar
Oh, hi, Elaine
You following me
She just runs right past, then Jeff rushes past following Elaine
Oscar pushes through people
Excuse me
Sorry
Excuse me
() 53
: Elaine grabs Oscar and leads him to the stairs
(') Excuse me
He's going to be sick
They head up the stairs with Jeff following
- Elaine rounds the corner and leads Oscar to the bathroom
goes in and shuts the door behind him
- Oscar is building up quite a sweat and mumbling to himself
He catches his reflection in the mirror and
Elaine opens the door
Oscar
Oscar grabs the hair-dryer and wields it like a gun
Stand back
Oscar, put down the dryer
Get back or 'll blow your head off
Oscar backs Elaine out of the bathroom
Oscar, please-- Oscar shuts the door and locks it
- Elaine is pressed against the door
Oscar, are you okay
She tries to open the door, but it's locked
Jeff walks up checking his pockets
(') Oscar, let me in
() 54
: Jeff realizes he lost the pill bottle
(') Oscar
Oscar
Uh
Elaine
can't find the pill bottle
But Elaine is too busy to hear
Oscar
Open the door
Jeff looks at the floor as he leaves
- Oscar is talking to himself in the mirror
Okay
Breathe
( ) It's going to be okay
Breathe
You're and investment banker
You've handled mergers for billion dollar companies
You can do this
Dead bodies don't move
They don't move
But that body was moving
It was moving
Then he slaps himself
(') Snap out of it
You can handle this
You can do this
He runs the tap and splashes some water on his face
(') Alright
You're okay
Stay calm
Stay calm
Oscar is still staring at himself in the mirror
(') That's it, Oscar, keep it together
Keep it together
Keep it together
Everything's going to be fine
Nothing moved
Dead people don't move
They're stiff
They don't move, do they
() () 55 : (') (he screams at himself in the ) Elaine has her ear pressed against the door
She hears the scream
- Easy now
Easy now
We can do this
few hours
That's nothing
No sweat
mean you've already been in here for
He looks at his watch
(') Where's my watch
He sees it's on the other wrist
(') Oh
He checks the time
(') It's already been
- Elaine continues to knock on the door
Open the door
Oscar
- Oscar finally gets a read on his watch
Five minutes
Suddenly the pressure of
the situation overtakes him
(') God damn
Shit
Shit
Shit
Shit
56
'- As the screaming and cursing goes on upstairs, Aaron approaches a mourner who looks concerned
(
) Shit
Shit
Shit
Shit
Shit
It's alright
Aaron turns around not knowing what to do
(
) Grief does strange things to people
Aaron looks at him a little freaked out by his sudden appearance
guess so
If you remember,  have something to talk to you about
Oh yeah
Is there somewhere private we could go
Sure
They walk away
The screaming continues as Jeff, frantically, but slowly comes down the stairs re-tracing his steps and searching around for his lost bottle of pills
- Frank and Aaron enter
Frank looks around the room a little grief stricken himself
Aaron walks to the desk as Frank touches some mementoes he clearly remembers
Frank takes out his glasses and notices a manuscript on the desk with Aaron's name
Are you writing a novel
() 57
: Uh
yeah
Aaron takes the manuscript and moves it away
Like your big brother
Actually 'm the oldest
was writing before
he was
've had a few pieces published in the New Yorker
But now 'm mainly teaching
Oh
Well, you must be very proud of your brother then
Getting all his novels published
Aaron decides to move the conversation on
So anyway
What did you want to talk about
He motions for Frank to take a seat and sits across from him
Your father and  were very
close
Yeah
Okay
That's good
And we spent a lot of time together
Yeah, well Dad was a fun guy
Frank takes an envelope out of his inside jacket pocket and takes some photos from the envelope
Um
've got some photos  want to show you
Sure
Frank passes the first photo
() 58
: (2) That's me and your Dad in Central Park in New York
Aaron looks at the photo curiously
(') That's us on Santa Monica Boulevard on Halloween
Aaron takes the next one, becoming more suspicious
So, where did you and my dad meet
Just around
- Elaine is outside the bathroom banging on the door
We can still hear Oscar moaning inside
Oscar
Are you alright
- Oscar is laying in the bathtub
He has his head under the faucet with his mouth open
drip falls into his mouth
Ahhh
He smacks his lips together and then opens his mouth and waits for the next drop
- Aaron is sitting with Frank
Frank passes him another photo
That's one of me and your father going to the premiere of "Dreamgirls" was dressed as Deena and your father had to be Effie
Aaron looks at the photo of them dressed in drag
() 59
: So
mean you have all these pictures, but he never said anything about you
This is the first 'm -- Frank gives Aaron a knowing look
(') How did you know my father
Aaron looks around the room
There is a copy of "People Magazine" sexiest men issue on the table
He sees figurines of male ballet dancers
It's getting clearer
He sees three Robert Mapplethorpe photos on the wall
There's a signed Kathy Griffin 8x10
Frank looks around waiting for him to get it
Aaron looks at a framed movie poster for Australia with Hugh Jackman
Aaron looks back at the picture
He gets it
(') Oh God
Aaron jumps up and closes the study door
Are you really that shocked
Frank gestures around the room
had no idea
'm sorry
'm sure he would have eventually told you, but  guess he wasn't sure how you'd react
Aaron shakes in disgust
Uugg
Like this
Aaron gathers his senses
He has a thought and turns to Frank
(') Does my mother know
No
And there's no reason why she should
Just as long as  get what's owed to me
() 60
: (2) long pause
Aaron looks over at Frank
"What's owed to you"
Well, obviously  should get something
mean, your dad and were lovers, and he left me absolutely nothing in his will
How do you think that makes me feel
Aaron fails to respond, because he's in too much shock
(') 'll tell you how it makes me feel cheap
Like some cheap piece of ass
mean, 'm entitled to something
What do you want
What  want is a lot, but 'm not asking you for what  want
deserve thirty thousand dollars
Thirty thousand dollars
can't just give you thirty thousand dollars
My wife and  are trying to have kids-- Your father told me you were having trouble
() Look, your father promised to take care of me, and  made sacrifices to keep him happy
Aaron gets angry
You think you can come in here, slander my father's name and show me a few photos of you and my dad dressed up going to see "Dreamgirls"
saw "Dreamgirls" twice
'm not gay
That's not proof of anything
"Steppin' to the bad side / Gonna take a mean ride
" () 61
: (3) Aaron grabs Frank and pushes him against the wall
(') 'm not giving you anything but a-- Frank pulls out another photo and holds it up to Aaron's face
Aaron,releases Frank and snatches the picture
Now  don't want to, but  will show these photos to your mother
Do you really want me to do that today
Wait here
He exits the study
- Aaron closes the study door behind him and almost bumps into two male mourners
Aaron,  was just telling George here how when we were boys together your dad used to love to make us all go skinny dipping
Aaron just stares at them
Then he moves toward the living room
-  - Aaron crosses the living room which is full of people mingling around
He's gone pale
( ) Oh God, oh God, oh God
He's looking around for Ryan, but there's no sign-
-Michelle watches Aaron walk around the room
Elaine is banging on the bathroom door
Oscar
Open the door
Derek arrives behind her and leans in close
() 62
: Anything  can do to help
Not really, thanks
Derek moves over to face her and leans his arm on the door very coolly
guess you've got it under control
Elaine ignores him and continues banging on the door
Oscar
Anguished noises emanate from the bathroom
(') Oscar
Open the door
So what are you doing after the funeral
've got Maxwell tickets
Look
'm busy
don't have time for your shit
Now get the hell away from me
Derek looks hurt and storms off

Ryan,  need to talk to you
Not now, Aaron
It's important
Give me five minutes
Aaron pulls him away
- Aaron pulls Ryan into the garage and closes the door
What are you doing
What is it
Aaron lowers his voice
That guy that was here before, that we didn't recognize
The guy in the leather jacket
Yeah
What about him
Aaron lowers his voice further
() 64 : Well,  was just with him in the study, and
and he showed me some pictures
So
He showed you some picture
What's wrong with that
'm busy
Pictures of him and Dad together at the premiere of "Dreamgirls"
Ryan's face is blank
It's not registering
Look, is this going anywhere, Aaron
Ryan, he was Dad's lover
What
No, no, no
The guy in the leather jacket just showed me pictures of him and Dad together
No, no, no
don't believe that
My father is not gay
've known him my whole life
And he's the most non-gay man 've ever met
Matter fact, he's so straight he makes me seem gay
And know 'm not gay-- Aaron pulls out the picture
(') Uugg
Uugg

/ Uugg/Uugg
Aaron nods
65
- Norman and Derek are sitting at the table
Norman is looking at his wrist
How can she be more interested in that idiot than me
Women
They don't know what they want
Norman's still examining his arm
It sounds serious, doesn't it
What
pigment mutation
Derek gives Norman a disparaging look
Norman picks up some cake and takes a bite
(') Ooh, will you try this cake
think it might have nuts in it
So
(shows his wrist) So
Aaron's uncle says  might be allergic to nuts
Then don't eat nuts
Put the cake down
can't not eat the cake
That's what do when 'm stressed
eat cake
bet you won't eat it when your arm falls off
Norman sniffs the cake
() 66
: Will you just try it and tell me if there's nuts in it
No
Come on
don't want to
Just do me a favor-- Norman is pushing the cake towards Derek's mouth
Get away from me
Derek gets up and walks off, leaving Norman spitting out the cake
From under the table, Jeff pops up
You haven't seen a pill bottle around, have you
Valium pill bottle
No
But can you try this-- Jeff smiles nervously and goes back to his search on the floor
Jeff slides across the floor past Uncle Russell sitting at the other end of the table
An   turns to Russell
Edward and  watched the Tony Awards every year
We would get all dressed up and sip cocktails
'm going to miss him so much
Don't worry
The way you look, you won't be far behind
The mourner looks shocked
Jeff continues his search along the floor
67
-   - Cynthia is sitting quietly with Duncan
'm sure we'll start soon
He looks toward the house and sees Norman exit
Duncan wants to avoid him
(') ( ) Let's go inside
In a moment
Duncan gets up and heads toward the house
He passes Norman
Doctor,  just have a-- Duncan doesn't stop, leaving Norman holding his wrist
Norman looks over and sees Cynthia
He sits next to her
(') 'm sorry
you know
about

Thank you
'll be alright
know he's watching over me
You think so
'  mean, there are a lot of fine ones up in heaven
Anna Nicole Smith's dead too, you know
might be watching over her
Norman sits next to Cynthia
(') Death is a terrible thing
Did you check to make sure he
was wearing shoes
hear they steal the shoes
And  hope you took off his ring, 'cause if it's worth anything, someone is going to take that, too
Cynthia stares at Norman
() 68
: (') Before he died, did he have a rash
She gets up and exits
Norman notices Jeff's pill bottle on the ground
He picks it up and puts it in his pocket
- The camera closes in on the closed garage door
We hear hushed voices
- You don't understand
If we don't give him the money, he's going to show Mom the picture
Okay
Let me think, let me think
Ryan is trying to come up with a solution
(') think you should pay him the money
What do you mean, you think  should pay him the money
Where the hell is all your money
'm in debt up to my ass
'm broke, man
So after paying for the funeral, the clothes, the catering
Now 'm supposed to shell out thirty thousand dollars
He's your father, too
You're the oldest
Besides, you've been living off Mom and Dad long enough
You must have some money saved
You haven't paid rent in two years
have not been living off of them
've been living with them

: (') No  haven't paid rent, but Dad hasn't worked in five years
Who do you think has been paying all the bills
Well if you've got money problems and 've got money problems, what can we do

He's pushing people aside and poking them with his cane
Are you alright
No, my nephew is dead and these bastards ate all the potato salad
Nearby mourners look appalled
The reverend looks over and sees Aaron and Ryan coming down the kitchen corridor
She approaches them
- Reverend Davis appears in front of Aaron and Ryan
Ah

( ) Of course
Thanks
Aaron walks off followed by Ryan
He passes Michelle, who's sitting on the couch
She stands up
Is everything okay
No
'm really sorry, honey, but buying a condo is going to have to be put on hold, just for now
() 71
: What are you talking about
Why
Babe, you know  wouldn't do this unless  had a good reason
What's the reason
haven't got time right now, please
'll explain later
-- Aaron walks off to join Ryan, who's at the door of the study
- Frank is reading Aaron's manuscript
Ryan and Aaron enter
( ) You
So you and my--
You
It's you
So when  called my father and he didn't answer, he was with you
Aaron realizes what Frank is reading
Hey, hey, hey
Aaron rushes over and takes the manuscript away from Frank
(') What are you doing with my manuscript
It's not ready
He puts it in the desk
Well, you left it on a coffee table
What's that supposed to mean
Well, when you put things on coffee tables, it's assumed it's for everybody
() 72
: It kind of is
Can we get to the point here
Fine by me
Aaron is now extremely irritated
He exchanges a look with Ryan confirming that there's no other way out
( ) If  write this check, then that's it
You give us the photos and stay away from our mother
Deal
Deal
Aaron sits down at the desk and reluctantly takes out his check book
He starts writing
(') ( ) Is it your first one
Aaron stops writing and looks up at him
What
The novel
it's a first draft
Yeah
So
No, nothing
Aaron continues to write the check
(') tried writing once
Didn't work for me, either
think it's just a gift
You either have it or you don't
It must be hard for you though, especially since your younger brother is such a great writer
( ) () () 73 : (2) (') Your father and  read "Black Hurt" together
Truly amazing
We loved it
He was so proud of you
Thanks
guess
Aaron rips the check into little pieces
That's it
can't do it
Aaron, what are you doing
There's no way in the world 'm giving him my hard earned money
Don't be stupid
Not today
'll pay you back as soon as my money comes in
He comes in today
Of all days, he picks the day of my father's funeral
Who the hell is he
He has the pictures
So what
Who cares what he's got
Let him show the world
Put it on facebook
don't care
- Let's just get it over with
There's a long pause as everyone seems to be deciding what to do
Finally, Frank stands up
Fine
This is on your head
Frank heads towards the door
What
No, wait
() 74
: (3) Ryan rushes to stand in front of the door, blocking Frank's Get out of my way
Let's just discuss this a minute
There's nothing to discuss
Frank grabs the door and tries to open it
(') Get out of my way
He tries to push past, but Ryan covers his mouth, muffling his cries
(') () Get out of my way
Move
Ryan restrains Frank
- few mourners hear the commotion and the muffled voices
They turn to look
- Ryan grabs Frank and wrestles him to the ground
Aaron watches, absolutely shocked as Ryan and Frank roll around on the floor
Aaron jumps up and stands between them and the door
Ryan, what are you doing
Get off me
Ryan is trying to muffle Frank's screams
Aaron, help me
Ryan is holding Frank down and trying to keep him quiet
Ah
() 75
: Aaron, you got any rope or duct tape
What
'm not a serial killer don't keep rope and duct tape in my pocket
Well just grab something
(indicating with his head) There, from the curtains
Aaron grabs the cord that's tied around the curtains
He holds it over the wrestling duo, but Ryan's hands are occupied with Frank
(') Tie his legs
Aaron grabs his legs and in doing so falls on top of Frank as well
As he wraps the curtain cord around Frank's legs
This is a really bad idea
- Elaine leans against the wall listening as Oscar hums in the bathroom
She slides down the wall and sits on the floor
- From a rooftop  we see the window slide open and Oscar, dripping with sweat and not wearing a shirt, lean out
He takes a deep breath of fresh air and listens to the birds
He climbs out the window revealing he's completely naked
He stands on-the roof and lifts his hands to the sky
- Michelle comes up and sits next to Elaine
Men
Tell me about it
How's Aaron
() 76
: How would  know
He's been avoiding me all day
We're trying to get pregnant
But  can't really do that by myself, can
feel like 'm making him eat brussel sprouts every time we do it
Elaine looks at her
The guy's father just died
Don't you think this is a bad day for sex
Don't you think  know that
'm sorry
At least your husband didn't ruin the funeral
It's a funeral, it's already ruined
When you start off with a dead guest of honor, how much worse can it get
- Ryan and Aaron struggle with Frank, who's muffled cries are starting to fade
Get that tie
Aaron grabs the necktie from off the desk
What am  supposed to do with the tie
Whatever you do with a tie
don't know what to-- Just stuff it in his mouth
Damn, have to do everything
Apparently everything but write a damn check
() 77
: Suddenly the door opens and Norman enters
Aaron, do you know what was in this cake, - : Frank who looks at Norman bug eyed hoping he'll help
Shut the goddamn door
Shocked, Norman does as he's told
It takes Norman a moment to register that Aaron and Ryan are sitting on top of Frank
Frank continues screaming through the cloth
What is going on
Who is that guy
Ryan thinks quickly
He's having a seizure
just found some Valium outside
Would that help
Yeah
Great
Give him some
Frank shakes his head "no
" Norman gets on his knees with the guys and opens the bottle
It's okay
This should help
calm you down
Frank tries to protest, but can't
Ryan holds Frank's mouth open as Aaron holds his nose closed
Norman pours a few pills into Frank's mouth, then Ryan holds Frank's mouth shut
Suddenly the door opens again and Jeff walks in
Have you seen a little brown pill bottle lying around-- They all turn to Jeff
Frank looks at him, hoping this time he'll get saved
() 78 : (2) Norman
told you to lock the damn door
You said "shut the damn door
" Jeff locks the door and looks shocked
What's going on
He's having a seizure
Why is he all tied up
No one knows what to say
- Oscar stands on the roof, naked, breathing in the fresh air
- Jeff, Aaron, Ryan and Norman are all kneeling over Frank
He's blackmailing you
Over what
If  could tell everybody, it wouldn't be blackmail
Look, just trust us
He's the bad guy
We'll explain later
What are you going to do with him
Everyonerealizes they have no answer to this question
Yeah, Ryan, what are we going to do with him
Ryan doesn't have any answers
don't know
() 79
: You don't know
Come on, you're the big writer
You're the one who came up with "Black Hurt
" Dream up something where we all live happily ever after
We can't keep him tied up forever
How long do you think those Valium are going to last
Valium
Yeah,  found that bottle of Valium
We gave him a few to calm him down
Norman hands him the bottle
Ah shit
Jeff stands up and heads over to the door
What
() What
They all head over to Jeff
Frank looks extremely curious to know what's going on
Everyone talks very quietly so that Frank can't hear
What is it
The thing is
those pills aren't really Valium
It's acid and
acid
What
Oscar took one by mistake
That's why he's acting crazy
Jeff, what the hell are you doing with this stuff
() 80
: (2) friend left them at my place
What friend, Amy Winehouse
Wait, you're telling us that Elaine's boyfriend, who knocked over our father's coffin, had just one of these things
( ) And you gave him how many
Norman looks a bit guilty
Five
Five
(looking at Frank) Poor bastard
thought they were Valium
They all turn and look at Frank who is looking back at them, increasingly concerned by whatever conversation they are having, and the pitying expressions on their faces
Maybe we should call an ambulance
You can't do that
'll go to jail
He's right
If anyone finds out this guy's been force fed acid, we could all be arrested
So what then
What's going to happen
Is he going to die
No
don't think so
doubt it
Probably not
() 81
: (3) The moment is broken by someone trying the door, followed by a knock
(
) Ryan
- Cynthia is knocking on the door
Aaron
- They all back away from the door
(
Are you in there
They look at each other in panic
Damn
(as normal as possible) Be out in a minute, Mom
Ryan looks at Norman and Jeff
(to Norman and Jeff) Okay
We have to go out there
You two stay in here and watch him
Ryan closes the curtains
Watch him
What do you mean, "watch him"
Just make sure he doesn't escape
Lock the door behind us
We'll deal with him after the funeral
Aaron and Ryan open the study door leaving Norman and Jeff to take care of Frank
82
- Aaron and Ryan come outside trying to look as normal as possible
They see Cynthia standing with the reverend
How's it going, Mom
Reverend Davis wants to talk with you
- Norman locks the door behind them
- Reverend Davis tries to remain cool, but she's agitated
Lookie here, brother
've been patient
We all know it's a virtue, but 'm about done with patience
Now if we don't resume service soon, we're going to need to have a little conversation about my compensation
Sure
So sorry
Um
can you just give us another five minutes
The reverend doesn't look too pleased
Five minutes
Is everything okay, boys
Ryan and Aaron kiss their mother and walk off
- Aaron and Ryan enter and slam the door
Why didn't you just pay him the money
Why did you tie him up
() 83
: Do you want Mom to find out
What is wrong with you
They start to argue
- We hear their muffled argument through the door
Uncle Russell rolls up to Derek who is sitting at the kitchen table
What's your problem
Women are my problem
No such thing as having a woman without a problem
If they didn't have problems, do you think they'd let us touch 'em
Let me tell you something about women
Smarter than you think they are
But not as smart as they think they are
She acts like she doesn't care that exist
mean how can she not feel what  feel
() Oh she feels it
She's playing hard to get
She wants you to work for it
Look, let me tell something about women
They want a man who can control them
know they talk all this Oprah, Beyonce "single women" , but what they really want is an old school man
Really
Listen here, boy
This is what you do: you walk up to her, slap her-- () 84
: Slap her
You want me to hit her
Has not hitting her worked
Look, then you grab her and kiss her
The harder the better
Are you sure, 'cause that-- Oh, man,  gotta shit
Where's the can
He rolls away quickly
- Norman and Jeff are sitting in the study
Frank is on the floor tied up, breathing heavily and making gurgling sounds
can't believe you gave him five
Even if they were Valium, that's too many
wouldn't give a guy five cough drops
Suddenly they hear the doorknob rattle
Norman and Jeff both look terrified
() Hello
Jeff covers his mouth
(
) Hello
Neither Norman nor Jeff want to speak
They argue in gestures
Finally Jeff relents
Hello
(
) need the toilet
Jeff and Norman both look panicked
Norman goes to the door
() 85
: Can't you use the one upstairs
(
) 'm in a wheelchair, you idiot
How am  supposed to get up the stairs
() Hello
Norman and Jeff look at each other not knowing what to do
(
) Open the damn door
Uncle Russell starts banging on the door with his cane
What are we going to do
They look at Frank who's starting to look high as a kite
We'll stick him behind the couch
( ) Just looking for the key
They pick Frank up and dump him behind the couch
Jeff stays with Frank to keep him quiet as Norman opens the door
Uncle Russell wheels himself inside
What the hell is wrong with you people
'm about to take a dump in my pants
- Elaine is still standing outside the bathroom
Derek comes up to talk to her
Elaine's completely drained and stressed
What do you want, Derek
just want to talk
() 86
: Please don't make me go through this again
The only reason you don't want to go out with me is because your dad likes me
No
The reason  don't want to go out with you is because it was a mistake
was drunk off my ass
You could have been a donkey
Thanks
That wasn't a compliment
'm saying couldn't remember it
Well  remember every minute of it
minute, huh
That's why  don't remember
What is it about this guy
What has he got that  haven't got
Okay, well for one thing, he's responsible
He's caring
He's considerate
He's thoughtful
He's stable
He's-- - Oscar is leaning over the ledge playing with his spit and laughing uncontrollably
Aaron and Ryan are still arguing
'm not the one who tied him up
() 87
: Well somebody had to look out for Mom
() 've been looking out for Mom since you got your book deal
You just can't get over it, can you
You're burning with jealousy because left and did what you always wanted to do
couldn't leave because  had responsibilities
Don't put it off on responsibilities
You spent three years on a novel and you won't even let anyone see it
What are you going to do
Wait until you're dead
You think you're going to be the Tupac of books
At least 'm not some hack writing crap
Mr
"Mama's Secret", Mr
"Black Hurt
" Mr
"Out of Ink", Mr
"Blank Page
" At least my crap gets published
Michelle enters
Aaron, what is going on
Michelle, please, not now
Why are you acting like this
Fine
We don't have to have sex today, but the condo
Don't you want to get out of here
-- () 88
: (2) Just tell her, Aaron
Tell me what
Aaron closes the garage door
Listen
Do you remember the guy in the leather jacket
Yeah
Well,  don't know how to say this, but
it looks like he and my father were having sex
What
No
Not your father
With him
Yes
No
Your father was the straightest guy  know
That's what  thought
Are you sure
And now he wants thirty thousand dollars or he's going to show everyone photos of them doing
stuff
Stuff like what
Aaron and Ryan share a look
Aaron shows Michelle the picture
She reacts
- Norman lifts Uncle Russell out of the chair
() 89
: Hurry up
Norman is struggling to hold Uncle Russell up
(') Have you got me
Yes, 've got you
Come on, quick, quick, quick
Alright, 'm trying to see where the toilet is
He maneuvers Uncle Russell to the toilet
Pants down
Pants down
No you do it
How can  do it
'm handicapped
Norman reluctantly helps Uncle Russell pull his pants down
Alright
Alright
Drawers
Drawers
Take down my drawers
Who calls them "drawers"
Norman pulls them down
(') It's all down
Am  there
Am  there
Norman looks and sees Uncle Russell is right over the toilet
() 90
: (2) Yes, yes
Just sit down
Uncle Russell sits down on the toilet trapping Norman's hand underneath and lets loose
Ooh, that's better
Norman pulls his hand out and looks at it in shock
: Norman's hand has shit on the fingers
He starts freaking out and screaming
- Jeff hears Norman and jumps up
(
) Ahh
Jeff goes into the bathroom to see what's going on
- Jeff opens the door and rushes in, but is stopped in his tracks by Norman's shitty hand
Ahh
Ugh
Norman, panicking, rushes to the sink, turns on the faucet full blast and sticks his hand under the water
This causes a great splashing
- Frank peeks up from behind the couch
He's clearly high
With his hands still tied, he struggles to get to his feet
- Norman frantically washes his hands
Norman
Norman
Norman still has his face down
() 91 : Please, please
Just come off
Norman
Norman turns and we see he has shit splattered on his face
What
Jeff points to his face
You missed some
Norman turns slowly and looks in the mirror
He freaks out
Oh,  think 've got some of it in my mouth
Norman desperately rushes to wash it off
- Frank is now up on his feet and running around like a rabid animal
- Jeff pulls Norman up and shakes him
Pull yourself together
Would you rather get caught or have shit in your mouth
Uncle Russell has fallen asleep on the toilet
- Frank is running around the room
Through the door, we see Uncle Russell sleeping on the toilet
Frank jumps up and down on the sofa
He loses his balance and falls on the coffee table head first
He cracks his head on the corner and falls straight down
Jeff and Norman rush out of the bathroom to find Frank lying on the floor motionless, blood on his head
() 92
: Oh, no
Check him
Check him
Hey, man, you alright
No response
Check him again
Check him
Man
Hey
Hey
Wake him up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
What's his name
don't know
Try Larry
Jeff looks at Norman, but he doesn't have a better idea
Larry
Shake him
Jeff bends down and shakes him
Larry, wake up
It's time to get up
From the bathroom, Uncle Russell starts to stir
Norman quickly closes the door
Maybe it's not Larry
Try something else
Pinch him
Jeff pinches Frank
Still no response
(') He must be breathing
He has to be breathing
Please God let him be breathing
() 93
: (2) Jeff looks concerned
He checks for a pulse
He looks up at Norman with an expression that tells us all we need to know
He's dead
- Michelle walks into frame and stops at the coffin
Aaron and
Ryan stand on either side of her
So that's it
We're just giving him all the money we've saved
Well, it's not that simple
Why not
Aaron refused to pay
How come you couldn't pay, Ryan
That's not the point
Besides, the only reason Aaron tore up the check is because the guy started talking bad about his novel
Your novel
Michelle looks confused
(') You let him read your novel
You wouldn't let me read your novel
Are you screwing him, too
'Cause Lord knows you're not screwing me
- Norman comes out of the study and closes the door behindhim
He leans against the door, dripping with sweat
- Aaron and Ryan look over and see Norman
() 94
: : Norman as he pastes a maniacal grin on his face and crosses into the living room
As he moves through the throng of mourners, they are all unnerved by him
Hi
Excuse me
Hi
Pardon me
Hi
The hugesmile never leaves his face
: Ryan, Aaron and Michelle watching Norman, concerned
Norman approaches and stands on the other side of the coffin
Norman, why are you grinning like that
(to Aaron and Ryan) Can you come to the study for a second
Aaron can see from Norman's face, and the sweat on his forehead, that something serious has happened
Then he sees Cynthia sitting in the corner
( ) 'll be back soon
Can you check on Mom
Sure
They exit
Michelle crosses to Cynthia
(') Hey, are you doing okay
It's going to be alright
If you've never given life, child, how can you understand death
- Jeff is leaning on the window
There's a knock at the door
(
) It's Aaron
Jeff opens the door
Norman, Ryan and Aaron enter
Norman locks the door behind them
Aaron rushes over to the body
() 95 : (') Oh shit
Call an ambulance
There's no point
What do you mean "there's no point"
Look at him
He's dead
Dead, dead
Is there a "kind of" dead, Aaron
What the hell did you do to him
We didn't do anything
Well he was alive when  left
He hit his head on the table
Oh no
This is really bad
This is really, really bad
What are we going to do
Twenty-five to life
Norman looks at his watch
You know what,  really have to be -- Norman makes his way to the door
You're not going anywhere
() 96
: (2) Look, 'm not the prison type
They'll kill me
Oh my God, 'm going to die
'm going to die in prison
Oh my God, do you know how fast a rash spreads in prison
Aaron smacks Norman
Pull yourself together
Norman calms down
Thanks, man
After a beat, Ryan speaks
Look, no one here knows who this guy is
Nobody knows his name
They probably didn't even notice him
Didn't notice him
He's four fucking feet tall
Look, all we have to do is get rid of the body
It'll be like he came and left
Get rid of the body
It took me two months to get rid of a couch
Did any of you happen to notice the size of Uncle Edward's coffin
Everyone looks at Jeff
( ) You want to bury him with my father
Why not
mean it's not like he's going to know
() 97
: (3) That's not the point
You have to admit, it makes sense, Aaron
The coffin's there, the hole in the ground's there
He'll be gone, finished, end of story
Unless you have a better suggestion
Aaron desperately tries to think of an alternative
- Derek and Elaine are sitting in the corridor
Elaine looks drained of energy
Derek's smoking a cigarette
It's funny
No matter what you say, 'm convinced we'll be together
Yeah, well, we all make mistakes used to be convinced  was going to marry Prince
What happened there
You still could
You're an idiot
'm serious
You only live once
You might as well do whatever it is that makes you happy
Yes, but maybe  don't think of life anymore as all about me, me, me
Maybe 've discovered there's something outside of myself that care about
And maybe you should, too
Derek looks hurt
That's kind of cold
care about you
() 98
: No, Derek, you care about you
You only care about me in relation to how affect you
There's a difference
That's not true, Elaine
- Oscar is squatting down rolling his head around when he hears Elaine's voice
(
) Derek, get over yourself
- Elaine moves over to the window
Derek follows her
Hey
He slaps her on the butt
Elaine whirls around
Derek grabs her on the arms
(') 'm the man for you, and you're coming home with me
He kisses her
- Oscar turns to look at the window and sees Derek and Elaine kissing
- Elaine pulls away and punches Derek in the face
He staggers back and sees Oscar in the window
What is that
Elaine turns around
Oscar
99
- Oscar moves away from the window and further out on the ledge
Elaine opens the window and sticks her head out
Oscar
What are you doing
Get back here and put your clothes on right now
saw you kissing him
wasn't kissing him
swear
Please, baby, put your clothes on
We're at a funeral
Derek sticks his head out the window behind Elaine
You cheater
You cheater
You're committing adultery
Calm down
'm going to jump right now
Remember you've got drugs in you
This isn't really happening
Oscar, look at me
She turns to Derek
(') ( ) Get out of here
She pushes him back inside
- As mourners mill about the lawn we hear: (
) 'm going to jump
'm jumping
You're a cheater
() 100
: People gather
around and look up
We only see Oscar from the waist up
: Oscar
(') 'm going to jump
She's cheating on me
(
) Oscar, please
Come back here
- Ryan, Aaron, Jeff and Norman are as we left them
There's just no way we can do it
It's impossible
Suddenly there's a knock on the door
Everyone freezes
(
) Norman, it's Derek
Let me in
Everyone freezes
Oh shit
Put him in the bathroom
Aaron and Jeff drag Frank to the bathroom door
(
) Are you in there
Aaron opens the door and we see Uncle Russell still on the toilet
He looks up
What's that
Aaron slams the door
We can hear Russell's muffled shouting coming from behind the bathroom door
Norman
Why is Uncle Russell on the toilet
forgot
() 101
: How could you forget
What the hell is wrong with you
Another loud bang on the door
(
) Aaron, open the door
Norman opens the door as Aaron runs over to keep Derek from entering
/ - Aaron opens the door an inch
What is it
Aaron, where's Norman
(from behind the door) 'm here
It's Oscar, he went crazy
He's-- Derek realizes that something weird's going on
(') What's going on
Nothing
Derek puts aside his curiosity for the time being
Look, Oscar's on the roof stark naked
He saw me kissing Elaine and now he's threatening to jump
've got to go
Jeff rushes to the door
Where are you going
() 102
: have to go out there
If he jumps, my sister is going to kill me
Jeff rushes out
(to Ryan and Norman) Wait here
Aaron follows Jeff, but he does not run
He walks out
- Jeff rushes through the empty room
Aaron walks behind him slowly
Jeff runs through the kitchen door and joins the mourners looking at Oscar on the roof
Get back here
Be careful
believe  can fly
believe  can touch the sky
: Aaron who steps out and sees everybody watching Oscar
- Elaine is still leaning out the window
Oscar, come inside
We'll have some coffee
() No
He climbs up on the roof
Oscar
She climbs out the window
103
- The mourners see that Oscar is naked
He stumbles
Everybody Aaron notices that everybody is captivated by the drama
- Elaine follows Oscar on the roof
- Duncan sees Elaine on the roof
Elaine, what are you doing
Elaine sees Oscar climbing further up the roof
(') Elaine
Elaine follows Oscar
Aaron realizes this is his chance
He heads back inside
Michelle catches him at the door
What are you doing
think  can get rid of this guy, but need you to stay out here and try to stop anyone from coming in
Okay
'll do what  can
She heads back to the crowd on the lawn
As Aaron goes through the doorway of the kitchen, Derek passes him on the way out to the lawn to see what's happening
(
) Elaine
- Norman is standing in the corner
Aaron knocks on the door
Who is it
() 104
: (
) It's Aaron
Norman opens the door
(') Everyone's out in the garden
We've gotta move the body now
Let's go
Ryan and Aaron grab Frank
As Norman runs out
- Norman looks around and sees that it's clear
He goes back to the study and opens the door
Quick
Quick
Aaron and Ryan carry Frank out as Norman looks around
Make sure no one comes in
As they disappear around the corner,, Norman closes the study door
He turns just in time to find Reverend Davis approaching
He intercepts
(to Reverend Davis) Hi
The reverend looks around, not knowing why Norman is being so especially friendly to her
- Ryan and Aaron hurry across the living room carrying Frank
- Norman is blocking Reverend Davis
So, what made you decide to get your God on
() 105
: Look, 'm sorry,  really need to use -- 'd like to make a confession
'm not a priest
That's okay, 'cause 'm not Catholic
- Aaron and Ryan get to the coffin and Ryan opens it up
There's an intense moment as they look down at their father in the coffin
They both stop for a moment, speechless
Aaron, we have to do this
Aaron looks up at Ryan and nods his assent
Ryan and Aaron lift up Frank and try their best to put him in the coffin
- Norman still blocks the reverend
What do you think God's favorite color is
() have no idea
'll bet it's blue
The sky's blue
The seas are blue
And the winds blew, too
- Ryan and Aaron are staring at the body
Frank is on his stomach, tops to tails with their father
Aaron looks at it and decides that it's just wrong
We can't leave it like that
() 106
: Ryan looks down and laughs
In a strange way, this might have been what he wanted
Be serious for a second
They begin lifting him again
- Norman is doing his best to keep Reverend Davis at bay
- Aaron and Ryan have swiveled the body around so that Frank is facing upwards
Why do you say  don't take anything seriously
You complain about me all the time, but if  didn't play the bad boy, you couldn't play the martyr
() Aaron's so great, Aaron's so right, Aaron's so responsible
(back to normal) Why don't you try laughing and enjoying life once in a while
It might make you a better a writer
- Norman is still talking to Reverend Davis
She looks like she really doesn't want to be there
Look,  must get to a phone
There's a man on the roof who's going to jump
'm addicted to strip clubs
The shoes, the poles, the smell
just like to take my money and throw it in the air
like to make it rain
107
- Elaine is stepping off the fire escape ladder and onto the roof peak
Oscar sits sadly on the roof peak with his back to the crowd
Oscar
Please don't do this
love you
Then why were you with him
wasn't with him
Yes, you were
saw you
- Derek is laughing next to Jeff
We see the view from their
- Elaine finally gets closer to Oscar
'll never be good enough
Not for your dad, and not for you
Oscar, please just come inside
No
You go inside
Come with me
Why
Because you're going to be a father
Oscar looks at her, shocked
What
() 108
: 'm pregnant
We're going to have a child
: Oscar and Elaine
You're pregnant
Oscar is overcome with emotion
Elaine holds out her hand
won't be able to do it without you
Very slowly, a naked Oscar, walks toward her and they embrace
The crowd applauds
: Michelle
What about me
want a baby
Would somebody get me pregnant
Everybody looks at Michelle
She smiles weakly
- Seeing Oscar is safe, Jeff is very relieved
- Norman and the reverend hear applause
Reverend Davis heads back out to see what's up
Norman turns to check on Ryan and Aaron
- Aaron and Ryan are just about to close the lid
They both look down at their father one last time
Aaron takes a moment to touch his father's hand
Bye, Dad
Ryan takes a long look as he closes the coffin
- Oscar turns toward the crowd
() 109
: ( ) We're having a baby
- General approval noises and applause come from the crowd
Duncan looks appalled
Great
Duncan heads toward the kitchen door
He passes a shocked looking Derek
Michelle follows and speaks loudly as Duncan is about to enter the kitchen
Aaron
Oscar's off the roof
- Aaron and Ryan quickly shut the coffin a moment before Duncan enters the living room through the kitchen door and crosses on the way to the stairs
'm going to kill him
Jeff follows Duncan in, looks at the coffin, then looks at Aaron and Ryan questioning them with his eyes
They return the look with silent assurance that the job is done
Michelle comes in
( ) Hey, is he gone
Yeah
Thank God
Everybody breathes a sigh of relief
- Elaine helps Oscar through the window
Thank you
() 110
: (
) Elaine
Elaine opens the bathroom door and Duncan enters
Elaine helps Oscar get dressed
(') ( ) Thank God you're safe
( ) You idiot
What the hell is wrong with you
Stay away from my daughter
Look, Dad-- Elaine, stay out of this
No, 'm not staying out of this
Remember how  told you we were moving in together
Well,  lied
We're getting married
Duncan is shocked
You're what
We're getting married
Elaine, you don't have to marry him just because you're pregnant
'm not marrying him because 'm pregnant
'm marrying him because love him
How can you love him
He's an idiot
Dad, this is my life
If you don't like it, too bad
But if you want to keep me and my child in your life, you'd better change your attitude, especially about my husband
() 111
: (2) Elaine exits, taking Oscar with her
Bye, Dad
They exit
- Cynthia walks up to Aaron
Baby,  really think we should start again now
Have you seen Uncle Russell
Aaron remembers where he is and looks at Ryan
They rush off to the study, passing Jeff
Jeff checks his pockets and realizes the pills are gone again
He goes off to find them
- Aaron and Ryan enter the study and head toward the closed bathroom door
They open it and find Uncle Russell sitting on the toilet
What the hell is going on in this place
'm so sorry, Uncle Russell
There was someone on the roof-- Never mind that
What about that dead body you dragged in here
Aaron and Ryan feign ignorance
What dead body
Don't mess with me
know a dead body when  see one
live in a retirement home
112
- Norman sniffs his fingers, worried
In the background we see Elaine entering the room with Oscar, now dressed, but still looking a bit wired
People respond with scattered applause and congratulations
Derek walks over and joins Norman
Did you hear that
She's having a kid
Derek looks at Norman who's looking sort of distant
(') How's your skin thing
Oh that
It's probably nothing
'm more worried about Hepatitis  after having Uncle Russell's shit in my mouth
think 'm feeling yellow
Norman touches his skin as he walks away, leaving Derek confused
: Jeff frantically looking for the pill bottle
He gives up and sits in a chair
: Ryan is wheeling Uncle Russell into the room as Aaron moves to his seat
'm telling you  saw the guy
He was dead
know you did, Russell
We all did
No
In the bathroom
Ryan offers a look to the other mourners indicating that Uncle Russell's a bit mad and shouldn't be listened to
: Michelle comes over to Aaron
can't believe what a nightmare today has been
() 113
: don't know
It's been sort of exciting
Aaron looks at her
(') For a funeral,  mean
Listen, about the condo and the baby, -- We'll work it out
Let's just get this day over with
Then we can worry about the rest of our lives
Aaron hugs Michelle
can't believe  still have to do this eulogy
with everything 've just found out
beat
It doesn't change anything, does it
Not a thing
Reverend Davis approaches Aaron, looking at her watch and appearing flustered
We're going to have to fly through this now
already missed a funeral and two Christenings
Sure
Let's go
Do you want an open casket
/// No
The reverend looks shocked at the reaction, but ignores it
She stands up at the front and speaks quickly
() 114
: (2) Alright
Everybody in their seats now
(she snaps her fingers) Hey, you, sit down
People settle into their seats
Ryan manages to squeeze in next to Martina
He smiles at her, flirtatiously
Cynthia throws Ryan a look, and he gets up and goes to sit with her
(') (speaking very quickly) 'd like to apologize on behalf of the family for all of the distractions hope that everyone is settled and ready to continue with the service
Aaron, the oldest son, would like to say a few words about his father
Michelle gives Aaron an encouraging look as he makes his way to the front
Aaron clears his throat and prepares to begin
The room is absolutely silent
He takes a deep breath
: The reverend nodding for Aaron to hurry up
: Aaron
My father
was an exceptional-- Suddenly, a loud banging emanates from the coffin
Everyone stares at it in stunned silence
Jeff looks over to Norman whose eyes are as wide as saucers
Aaron looks like a deer caught in headlights
He looks at Ryan who gestures to him to continue
He nervously struggles on
(') My father was an exceptional man
Everyone stares at the coffin in awe
Aaron bravely continues
(') Not only did he live for his family, but he was always there for others-- () 115
: (3) What the hell is going on
1 There's someone in there
knew it
knew it
Suddenly the coffin lid flips off and everyone stares in wonder as Frank sits up, looking like a crazy person, and babbling incoherently
Several people scream
Frank opens the other end of the coffin and looks at his dead lover
(trying to cover) What the hell are you doing in my Dad's coffin
Frank starts grabbing at Edward's body screaming
Edward
Edward
Edward
Ryan, Norman and Jeff try to pull Frank out of the coffin, but he's holding onto the corpse
(') No
No
Finally they get Frank out and carry him from the room
As he passes Cynthia, the photos fall out of his pocket at her feet
As Duncan closes the coffin again, Cynthia bends down and picks up one of the photographs and stares at it
Her face turns to horror as she makes out the image
The noise in the room is broken by Cynthia's furious cry
She drops the photos and runs at Frank
You bastard
Cynthia tackles Frank and starts beating him
(') (as she hits him) He was with you
Duncan picks up the photos
He shows them to Uncle Russell
() 116
: (4) always thought he had a little sugar in his tank
Everything has descended into total chaos until Aaron finally shouts across the room
Everyone, including Frank and Cynthia, looks at Aaron, stunned
They all freeze
There's a long silence
(') He had his
shortcomings, but he took care of his family
He loved his family
He loved this house
He worked hard
All  wanted today was to show him how much we all loved and admired him
To give him the respect that he deserved
Is that really so much to ask
We all get so distracted by the
little things in life
We forget about the important things
Like the fact that we lost a great man
The mourners look up at Aaron with undivided attention
(') So maybe he loved "Dreamgirls" more than most men
We don't know why a man makes the choices he makes
But do know that my father made the best choices he could make
Life is complicated
We're just thrown here together in a world filled with chaos and confusion
and we do our best
And Dad did his best
Aaron looks over at the coffin
As
he speaks, we see shots of Cynthia, Frank, Jeff, Norman, Duncan as they are moved by Aaron's words
(') He taught us to go for what we wanted in life, because you never know how long you're going to be here
And whether you succeed
or you fail
the important thing is that you tried
() 117
: (5) beat
Michelle looks up at her husband with pride
We see the various other mourners looking at Aaron and listening
(') So when you all leave here today, want you to remember Dad for who he really was
decent, loving man who never condemned anyone for how they lived
Who never cast disparaging remarks or held prejudices against race, gender
height
If only we could all be as giving, as generous, as understanding as my father
Even dead, my father has more character than everyone in this room
If  am half the man my father was, my child will be incredibly blessed
Aaron turns and walks out of the room
Everyone watches him go
Michelle follows him out of the room
: : - The house has emptied out
All the cars are gone
-  - Aaron is laying on the couch, looking drained
Ryan comes down the stairs
It looks like he's had some time to recover
He walks over and takes a seat
How's Mom
She's resting
beat
(') 've asked Mom to come live with me for awhile
It'll give you and Michelle a chance to breathe a bit, you know
Move and everything
Aaron looks at Ryan, surprised
