Written by Peter Stone Based on a story by Peter Stone and Marc Behm October 1st, 1962 ( ) -- Silence -- complete silence for the urbanite, though the oncoming darkness is punctuated by the sounds of farm country -- a few birds, a distant rumble of thunder from some heavy clouds on the horizon, a dog's barking
the green, squared-off flatland, lit only by a fine sunset in its final throes
Then, gradually, starting from nothing, a rumble is heard, quickly growing louder and louder until the sound of a train can be recognized
quickly, discovering the railroad line atop a man-made rise of land, and the speeding passenger train is upon us, flashing by with a roar
Then, as if from nowhere, the figure of a man hits the embankment and rolls crazily down to the bottom into the thick underbrush alongside the tracks
-- It lies in the bushes, still, unmoving -- dead to the quiet peaceful countryside as the sound of the train fades off until there is silence once more
begins with a crash
( ) : -- handsome and elegant hotel perched on the mountain-side overlooking the French resort town
large, open sun deck -- tables, gaily colored parasols, sun bathers
One of the latter is  , a lovely young girl
She is, besides taking in the sun, involved in her favorite activity -- eating
Then -- a dark, ominous shape intrudes in the f
g to bring into sharp relief a revolver -- shining, black and ugly in the sunlight
, unaware of her danger, continues to eat
The finger tightens around the trigger and finally the gun shoots -- a stream of water arcs, with unerring aim, straight into 's face
Including -, a French boy of six or so
looks at him sternly
- (in for trouble) Oh, la
Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded
(calling) Sylvie
, French, attractive, blonde, in her early thirties, comes from the railing of the sun deck to join and -
Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche
(to -) Va jouer, mon ange
- scampers off, content to have gotten off so lightly
notices 's lunch which consists of cold chicken, potato salad, rolls and butter, wine and coffee
When you start to eat like this something is the matter
No answer from
begins reading a magazine as continues eating
Sylvie -- 'm getting a divorce
Ca alors
From Charles
He's the only husband 've got tried to make it work,  really have -- but -- But what
don't know how to explain it
'm just too miserable
picks up a chicken leg and starts off
regards the devastated table before following
It is infuriating that your unhappiness does not turn to fat
-- magnificent indoor, glass-enclosed pool, the vista of snow- covered mountains seen through the ceiling-high windows beyond
and  are passing through, their conversation continuing
But why do you want a divorce
Because  don't love him
But that is no reason to get a divorce
-- An open balcony running around two sides of the pool, sun- worshippers lying in deck-chairs
and  appear, their conversation continuing
With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends
(sitting) admit  moved to Paris because was tired of American Provincial, but that doesn't mean 'm ready for French Traditional
loathe the idea of divorce, Sylvie, but -- if only Charles had been honest with me -- that's all  ask of anybody -- the simple truth
But with him, everything is secrecy and lies
He's hiding something -- something frightening -- something terrible -- and evil
She stops as she is aware of a weird figure hovering over her
She wheels, terrified
--  - strange, grotesque knitted mask that completely covers the face except for eyes, nose and mouth
The eyes inside this particular mask stare down at
Does this belong to you
down to include -, his hand held firmly by the man in the mask
Including , ,  and -
is too terrified to answer
Realizing this, the man,  , takes off the snow-mask to reveal a handsome, tanned face
Oh, forgive me
(indicating -) Is this yours
(indicating ) It's hers
Where'd you find him, robbing a bank
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild
(a pause) We don't know each other, do we
Why, do you think we're going to
don't know -- how would  know
'm afraid  already know a great many people
Until one of them dies couldn't possibly meet anyone else
(smiling) Yes, of course
But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list (he starts off) Quitter
(turning) How's that
You give up awfully easy, don't you
Eyeing one, then the other,  sizes up the situation and rises
Viens, Jean-Louis, let us take a walk
have never seen a Rothschild before
and - start off, but not before the boy squirts  with his pistol
(drying) Clever fellow -- almost missed me
'm afraid you're blocking my view
(moving) Sorry
Which view would you like
The one you're blocking
This is the last chance  have -- 'm flying back to Paris this afternoon
What's your name
Peter Joshua
'm Regina Lampert
Is there a Mr
Lampert
Yes
Good for you
No, it isn't
'm getting a divorce
Please, not on my account
No, you see,  don't really love him
Well, you're honest, anyway
Yes,  am -- 'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me
Like when you go into a drugstore
'm not sure  -- Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size
You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size
always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is
Oh
guess
Is there a Mrs
Joshua
Yes, but we're divorced
That wasn't a proposal --  was just curious
Is your husband with you
Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me
First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities
What do people call you -- Pete
Mr
Joshua
(turning to go) Well, 've enjoyed talking with you
Now you're angry
No, 'm not -- 've got some packing to do
'm also going back to Paris today
Oh
Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"
Shakespeare never said that
How do you know
It's terrible -- you just made it up
Well, the idea's right, anyway
Are you going to call me
Are you in the book
Charles is
Is there only one Charles Lampert
-- Her face clouding
Lord,  hope so
--    -- The Arc de Triomphe at the far end of the Avenue to pick up a  as it pulls up before the handsome building
Inside are ,  and -
--  -- As  climbs out and the  begins unloading her suitcases
Goodbye, Sylvie, and thanks
(She turns toward the house) - sticks his head out of the taxi window
- When you get your divorce will you be going back to America
-- looks at , surprised
He knows everything
(to -) Don't you want me to stay
- Yes, of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter -- -- you could have the stamps
'll get you some here, okay
- Okay
walks toward the house with the driver, who carries her cases
She presses the button that electrically opens the front door
-- As the elevator rises  gets out, followed by the driver
He puts down the bags in front of the apartment door
(handing him a tip) Merci
The driver leaves
She goes to the door and presses the minuterie, the button that turns on the time-light, and the lights come on
Then she rings the doorbell
There is no answer
She rings again
Still nothing
Sighing, she digs out her keys and starts to fit it into the lock
At this moment the minuterie expires, plunging the scene into darkness
' Wonderful
She finds the button and the light goes on again
She inserts the key and turns it
--   -- --  as it opens and  steps into the She stops, her expression changing
From 's p
o
v
as   the entrance hall
It is bare -- no furniture, no rug, no pictures, no nothing
-- She stares for a moment, then goes back out into the landing
-- As  steps back outside
She looks at the nameplate beside the door
It reads "
" -- looks at the plate in disbelief, then turns and hurries back into the apartment
-- As  hurries into the entrance hall
Honorine --
No answer
Now,  , she goes into the Salon
It is also empty -- stripped bare
There are squares of the wall's original color where paintings used to hang, the hooks still in the wall
She rushes now, going into the bedroom, crazily, lurching and careening behind her
The bedroom, too, is empty
She goes to the built-in wardrobe closets and throws open all the doors
Only some hangers remain
She pulls open the drawers -- nothing
Charles --
She turns, and running now, goes through another door to the library,
The rows of shelves are as empty as the rest of the apartment
She begins to turn in a circle, looking for something, anything
In a panic she turns and runs out, colliding suddenly with a  whom she (and we) have not noticed until the moment of impact
screams
-- heavy-set man of no particular age with tobacco-colored hair, and thick glasses
Madame Charles Lampert
Including , in a state of near-shock
Yes
am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire
Would you be so kind as to come with me, please
-- We see a large metal drawer being opened and an all-too- familiar shape outlined under a damp sheet of muslin
-- Looking straight down at the tops of 's, 's and an 's head and smack into the open drawer
lifts a corner of the sheet at the bottom and reveals a bare foot with a ticket tied to its big toe
He stoops to read it
Satisfied, he recovers the foot, then moves to the other end to uncover the head
As the sheet starts to lift: as she looks down into the
She closes her eyes for a moment, then looks again
'  (
) Well, Madame --
She nods
'  (
) You are positive
She nods again
moves into the
You loved him
'm very cold
nods as he turns to the unseen
suddenly moves as the 'drawer' is slid back into the wall
comes with a loud clang and continues while the echo dies
'  -- --   ( ) as it is pulled open
photograph of Charles Lampert lies face up in the drawer
hand reaches in and pulls it out
Including  sitting behind his desk, and , sitting across from him
The office is as bare as most policemen's offices
studies the photo
We discovered your husband's body lying next to the tracks of the Paris- Bourdeaux railroad line
He was dressed only in his pajamas
Do you know of any reason why he might have wished to leave France
Leave
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape
' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven
(a pause) 'm very confused
She starts to rummage through her bag
shoves a package of French cigarettes across the desk to her
But she pulls a package of nuts out of her bag
She begins separating the shells with her thumb nail and eating the nuts, depositing the shells in the ashtray
watches this for an instant
He was American
Swiss
Oh
Swiss
His profession
He didn't have one
He was a wealthy man
don't know
suppose so
About how wealthy would you say
don't know
Where did he keep his money
don't know
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation
don't know
(exploding) 'est absurde, Madame
To-tale-ment absurde
know
(pause) 'm sorry
It is all right
sighs, puts down his pencil and pushes a button on the desk
He removes a cigar from his desk and inserts it into his mouth
Is it all right
wish you wouldn't
He rips the cigar out of his mouth and slams it back into the drawer, closing it fiercely
sticks his head in the door
Les effets de Lampert
The  leaves and closes the door
On Wednesday last your husband sold the entire contents of the apartment at public auction
Furniture, clothing, kitchenware -- everything
The gallery, in complying with his wishes, paid him in cash
One million two hundred and fifty thousand New Francs
In dollars, a quarter of a million
The authorities in Bordeaux have searched his compartment on the train
They have searched it thoroughly
They did not find $250,000, Madame
He opens the desk drawer, puts the cigar back in his mouth and lights a match by scratching it against the glass desk- top before he remembers 's request
He puts it back in the drawer again
The door opens and the  enters again, this time carrying a wicker basket which he deposits on 's desk, and leaves
peers into the basket
These few things are all that was found in the train compartment
There was no other baggage
Your husband must have been in a great hurry
He begins to take them out, placing them on the desk, identifying each item as he does
One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda -- (pausing, he opens the notebook) -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday -- (reading) "Five p
m
-- Jardin des Champs- Elysees" (looking up) Why there
don't know
Perhaps he met somebody
(dryly) Obviously
(returning to the items in the basket) One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you -- (lighting up) letter
May  see it
hands her the letter and watches her closely as she reads it
(reading) "My dear Regina:  hope you are enjoying your holiday
Megeve can be so lovely this time of year
The days pass very slowly and  hope to see you soon
As always, Charles
Your dentist called yesterday
Your appointment has been changed
" (she looks up, puzzled) Not very much, is it
We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something
Did you
Yes
Your appointment has been changed
(he smiles at his little joke, then returns to the basket) One key to your apartment -- one comb -- one fountain pen --  one toothbrush -- one tin of tooth powder (he looks up) -- that is all
He slides a sheet of paper and pen across to her, then starts to put the things back into the basket while he speaks: If you will sign this list you may take the things with you
(sighing) Is that all
Can  go now
One more question
Is this your husband's passport
He reaches into the desk drawer and pulls out a passport which he hands to her
-- The cover indicates that it is Swiss
's hand opens it to a picture of a man -- the man we saw in 's photo
Under it is the name: "
" -- Of course it is
And this
He hands her another passport
-- The cover is American
When it is opened, we see the identical picture, but the name under it reads: "
" -- don't understand
And this
And this
He hands her, one at a time, two more passports
-- One is Italian which, when opened, shows the same photo with the name "
" The other is Venezuelan, the same photo, and the name "
" -- Have you nothing to say, Madame
looks down at the four passports, then back to (hopefully) It's all right if you want to smoke your cigar now
-- The house is empty as before
Now it is silent, the late afternoon light coming from outside
stands by a window
canvas airline bag rests on the floor nearby
Suddenly there is the noise of a
-- As her head turns, in alarm, toward the noise
There is a moment of silence, then  are heard, coming closer
As  enters
(surprised) What are you doing here
phoned but nobody answered
wanted to tell you how sorry  am -- and to find out if there was anything could do
How did you find out
It's in all the afternoon papers
'm very sorry
Thank you
silence
rang the bell but  don't think it's working
Yes it is --  heard it this morning
He looks around for the light switch, then goes to it and flicks it on -- nothing happens
He flicks it a few more times
They must have turned off the electricity
She shakes her head
looks around
Where did everything go
Charles sold it all -- at auction
Do you know what you're going to do
Try and get my old job back at , suppose
Doing what
'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- 'm French to English
That's what  did before  married Charles
The police probably think killed him
Instant divorce you mean
Something like that
But 'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail
(Taking her hand) Come on
You can't stay here
don't know where to go
We'll find you a hotel
Not too expensive -- 'm not a lady of leisure anymore
Something modest but clean -- and near enough to  so you can take a cab when it rains -- okay
She nods
He picks up the airlines bag and they start out
stops at the door and looks back
loved this room -- but Charles never saw it -- only what was in it
All those exquisite things -- (looking around) think  prefer it like this
-- of a phonograph
hand appears, starts the record on it spinning, then places the arm at the beginning
An instant later   starts with a roar
-- of the coffin
It rests on a low platform, with a bouquet or two of flowers near the head, the lid open
Inside, the face made up to look lifelike (but failing), lie the remnants of Charles Lampert
-- The  sits quietly, eyes downcast, staring at his hands in a prayer-like attitude
, revealing row after row of empty wooden bench-like seats in the large, dimly-lit, high-ceilinged room
Finally, in the first row, and  are discovered
Besides , they are the only ones present
turns around to look at the empty room
They speak in whispers
It's not exactly what 'd call a large turn-out
Didn't Charles have any friends
Don't ask me -- 'm only the widow
(indicating ) If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him
At least he knows how to behave at funerals
-- His eyes still lowered
to feature his hands -- he is methodically trimming his nails with a small clipper
-- Have you no idea who could have done it
Until two days ago all  really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out  didn't even know that
The front  of the Chapel is heard opening and a shaft of daylight streams in
The  turn
-- The short, heavy-set figure of a  is outlined against the bright outdoor light
He stands for a moment, then closes the door after him
, short-sighted, bald, in his middle forties, glances around nervously, like a barnyard bird
Then he walks down one of the side aisles of the Chapel
-- As he watches
-- As she watches him
-- arrives at the coffin
He stops, looks down at 's body for a moment
Then, suddenly, in rapid succession, he sneezes six times
He takes a small bottle from his pocket, shakes a pill from it and swallows it dry
He turns and walks back up the aisle, looking for a place to sit
He comes face to face with , stops, turns to sit somewhere else
-- Do you know him
've never seen him before
He must have known Charles pretty well
How can you tell
He's allergic to him
turns and glances at
Again, the sound of the opening interrupts them
They turn to look
-- Again the figure of a  is outlined in silhouette against the outside brightness
When he closes the door we can see "" , a slim, rangy man with sandy-colored hair, a weatherbeaten face, washed-out blue-eyes -- also in his forties
He wears a velvet-corduroy suit, string tie and a bright yellow flower in his lapel
bulldurham tag hangs from his outside breast pocket, dangling from its string
He starts down the aisle toward the bier, him, and we notice his unsteady gait
He turns to look at the others present
-- '
down the aisle
's face, then 's, then 's and 's -- all staring at
-- As  arrives
He stands staring at 's body, swaying on his feet until he reaches out and grabs the side of the coffin to steady himself
Then he takes the flower from his lapel and throws it into the open box
-- (heavy Texas accent) Ariva durchy, Charlie
As  turns away from the coffin and approaches  and , addressing the latter -- after having first reached for his hat which he discovers he isn't wearing
Miz Lampert, ma'am
points to
Unruffled,  starts over
addressing  this time
Miz Lampert, ma'am
Yes
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way
He sure didn't
No siree
don't understa-- But  has nodded his head and moved off to find a seat
When he spots , the two men stare at each other
Finally,  chooses a seat away from him and sits
-- It flies open, this time with a bang, and the large  who appears almost fills the frame
-- As the loud noise awakens him with a snort, mid-snore
-- Closing the door, we see  , a heavy-weight -- tall and wide, but not fat -- with black hair combed straight back and heavy bushy eyebrows of a matching color, which meet over his nose and join up
About the same age as the first two men,  is dressed in a battered raincoat, his hands thrust deep in the pockets
He marches down the aisle
Looking straight ahead,   with him
He stops before the coffin and stares into it
-- As he stares down into the coffin, his tongue trying to dislodge a bit of food caught in his teeth
He stares hard at the body, squinting his eyes
Then he removes one hand from his pocket, removes a pin from the inside of his lapel, picks his teeth with it, then slowly lets the hand down, into the coffin
-- ' The pin held between thumb and forefinger, he jabs it slowly but positively deep into the back of one of the dead man's hands
There is no reaction
-- He watches the dead man carefully, still squinting
Then finally satisfied, he returns the pin to his lapel and walks back up the aisle and out of the door, slamming it after him
-- Having watched  exit
Suddenly a hand falls on her shoulder
She jumps in alarm and utters a little cry of fright
Featuring a funeral , a cadaverous type (aren't they all) with a black cut-away coat and an over-solicitous, unctuous manner
He is eternally bent at the waist, in a sort of half bow
He offers  a letter which she takes
Merci, Monsieur
Pas du tout, madame, pardon -- pardon -- pardon
He backs off and is gone
looks at the letter, back and front, then starts to open it
Who is it from
The American Embassy
She pulls out the letter and starts to read it
-- It bears the Great Seal as a letterhead and the typed message reads: "Dear Mrs
Lampert: Please drop by my office tomorrow at noon-thirty
am anxious to discuss the matter of your late husband's death
Sincerely, (signed)
Bartholomew
" -- has been reading over 's shoulder
What is it about
don't know
But if this is a sample of American diplomacy 'm buying a fallout shelter
--  -- The fine old building in the Rue Gabriel
-- As  leaves the elevator two young step in, immersed in conversation
1ST bluffed the Old Man out of the last pot -- with a pair of deuces
2ND What's so depressing about that
1ST If  can do it, what are the Russians doing to him
The elevator door closes on them
reacts to this and starts down the hall, finally stopping at the door
-- It is marked "307-
"  checks the letter, then opens the door
'   -- The office is empty, the typewriter on the secretary's desk is covered with its plastic shroud
enters, looks for somebody, notices that the door to the private office is slightly ajar
(tentatively) Hello --
(there is no answer) Hello
'  (
) (from the private office) Is there anything wrong, Miss Tompkins
Uh -- Miss Tompkins isn't here
comes to the door and looks in
He is a pale grey-haired man who looks, on first examination, older than his forty-odd years
Sickly would be the word that describes him best -- pallid, consumptive-looking
He wears heavy tortoise-framed glasses which fall down his nose and cause him to push them back in place every so often with a quick automatic motion
'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch
You are --
Mrs
Lampert -- Mrs
Charles Lampert
(looking at his watch) Come in, Mrs
Lampert
You're quite late
He motions for her to enter, standing aside to let her do so
'   -- small cubicle -- there is a silver-framed photo of three kids on the desk
indicates a chair, then goes behind his desk and sits
can of lighter fluid stands open on the desk and a crumpled hankie beside it
Excuse me for a moment, Mrs
Lampert -- it's a stubborn little devil
He works at a stain on his necktie with lighter fluid and hankie
Dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled up
had a good man -- an excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, but
asked us to use the plant here in the building -- to ease the gold outflow
Mr
Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who  am
(looking up) Charles Lampert's widow -- yes
(going back to the tie) Last time  sent out a tie only the spot came back
He looks up at her, laughs silently, then goes back to his tie
Voila
As they say
He puts away the lighter fluid in a desk drawer, smells the hankie, passes on it, then sticks it in his pocket
He opens another drawer and pulls out various sandwiches wrapped in waxpaper, a salt and pepper shaker, a tube of mustard, a bottle of red wine and two Dixie cups
Have some, please
've got
(checking) liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst
No thanks
He uncorks the wine, fills a cup and begins eating
Do you know what
is, Mrs
Lampert
don't suppose it's an airline, is it
Central Intelligence Agency --
You mean spies and things like that
Only we call them agents
We
You mean you're --
Someone has to do it, Mrs
Lampert -- 'm sorry, it's just that  didn't think that you people were supposed to admit -- 'm not an agent, Mrs
Lampert -- 'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds
Congress seems to think that all a spy needs -- Agent
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business
What's all this got to do with me, Mr
Bartholomew
(his mouth full) Your husband was wanted by the
government
May  have a sandwich, please
He hands her a sandwich and fills a wine-cup for her
To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency
(eating) So that was it
Yes
We knew him, of course, by his real name
(almost choking) His -- real --
Voss -- Charles Voss
All right, Mrs
Voss -- (taking a photo from his desk) -- 'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you
(indicating the kids on the desk) Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr
Very sweet
Aren't they
Now look at this one, Mrs
Voss, and -- Stop calling me that
Lampert's the name on the marriage license
Yes -- and tell me if you recognize anyone
Just a moment
Have a good look
He reaches back into the drawer and pulls out a glass which he gives her
-- , all in army uniform, sitting behind a table
The glass is held over the first, magnifying the face
-- It's a photo of a young
'  (
) It's Charles
'  (
) Very good
'  (
) He looks so young -- when was this taken
'  (
) 1944
The next face, please
The glass and  move to the next man -- a young
'  (
) It's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- 'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie
'  (
) Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you
'  (
) No
'  (
) Next, please
The glass and  move to the third face -- a young
'  (
) Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one
'  (
) Do you know him, Mrs
Vo -- Mrs
Lampert
Leopold
Gideon
'  (
) No
'  (
) The last one, please
The glass and  move to the fourth face -- a young '  (
) That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too -- '  (
) Herman Scobie
And you've never seen him before, either
'  (
) No, thank heaven
-- (a pause, regarding her) Mrs
Lampert, 'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger
Danger
Why should  be in any danger
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead
Mr
Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job
(she takes another sandwich) Please, do what we ask, Mrs
Lampert -- it's your only chance
Gladly, only  don't know what you want
You haven't told me
Oh, haven't
The money -- Mrs
Lampert -- the money
The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction
Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly
But it's Charles's money, not theirs
(laughing) Oh, Mrs
Lampert
'd love to see you try and convince them of that
(drying his eyes) Oh, dear
Then whose is it
His or theirs
Ours
(she looks at him for a moment) Oh,  see
And 'm afraid we want it back
But  don't have it
That's impossible
You're the only one who could have it
'm sorry it's impossible
It's the truth
is silent for a moment, thinking
believe you
Thanks very much
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it
Mr
Bartholomew -- if  had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, 'd know it
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it
You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs
Lampert -- 'm quite sure you'll find it
But -- Look for it, Mrs
Lampert -- look just as hard and as fast as you can
You may not have a great deal of time
Those men know you have it just as surely as we do
You won't be safe until the money's in our hands
Is that clear
nods
He writes something on a pad of paper and tears it off, handing it to her
Here's where you're to call me -- day or night
It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment
Don't lose it, Mrs
Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me
It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes
Well, there you are
Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it
shakes his head
Why not
(grimly) Because they're still here
Oh
Like  said, Mrs Lampert -- 'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger
Remember what happened to Charles
takes the last sandwich and begins eating furiously
- -- --
One of the French Punch and Judy shows set up on certain days in the small park alongside the broad avenue between the Rond Point and the Place de la Concorde
At the moment, Judy, as always, is beating Punch with a bat
The sound of laughing and screaming can be heard
-- Sitting on small benches lined up to face the stage
Their attention is fixed on the show, their belief totally suspended by the play as only children's can be -- laughing at the slapstick, booing the villain, frightened by the perils
-- Sitting on the last bench, next to some
They are laughing but she isn't -- she just watches, her attention caught up but her face void of emotion
The bench is too low for her, forcing her knees up almost under her chin
After a moment,  comes up behind her and, stepping over the benches, sits beside her
She doesn't seem to notice
[Throughout the following scene the  and the can be heard in the b
g
] Reggie --
She turns and looks at him for a moment
(vaguely) Hallo, Peter
You telephoned me to meet you
've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you
'm sorry --  heard the children laughing
from the
and  turn toward the stage
-- and  are arguing loudly
-- What's going on
Don't you understand French
'm still having trouble with English
The man and the woman are married -- -- and  are batting each other on the head
'  (
) Yes,  can see that -- they're batting each other over the head with clubs
Finally,  knocks Punch out of sight and a  wearing a three-cornered hat appears
'  (
) Who's that with the hat
-- Wearing a hat, he stands off in the background, watching
'  (
) That's the policeman -- he wants to arrest Judy for killing Punch
-- and the  are batting one another
'  (
) What's she saying now
'  (
) That she's innocent -- she didn't do it
'  (
) She did it, all right -- take it from me
'  (
) believe her
's head appears on the other side of the stage, says something, then ducks out
'  (
) Who was that
'  (
) Punch, of course
-- Of course
thought he was dead
He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only -- (her face clouding) only he is dead, Peter --  saw him -- he's not pretending
Somebody threw him off a train
What am  going to do
Charles was mixed up in something terrible
wish you'd let me help you
Whatever it is, it doesn't sound like the sort of thing that a woman can handle all by herself
-- has gotten the upper hand is now batting the 's brains out
--  as he winces
-- Have you got a mirror
(she nods) Give it to me
She hands it to him and he holds it in front of her face
Right there, between your eyes -- see
Worry lines
You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that
How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up
(jumping at the suggesting) Starting tonight
-- --
He stands on the dance floor in front of a five piece Latin dance band, a spotlight on him, wearing his professional smile as he speaks into a mike
Bonsoir mesdames et messieurs, good evening ladies and gentlemen, guten Abend, meine Damen und Herren -- ce soir, comme tous les soirs, l'attraction ici, au Black Sheep Club, c'est vous
Venez, mesdames et messieurs, step right up, ladies and gentlemen, kommen Sie her, meine Damen en Herren, avanti, signore e signori -- avanti
-- At their table
is dressed in a lovely Givenchy dress
What was all that
Fun and games
Evidently we're the floorshow
You mean you and me
No, everyone
Come on -- avanti, avanti
She rises and pulls him along
Including the dance floor as most of the patrons go to it, laughing self-consciously and looking around
Ecoutez bien -- les regles sont tres simples -- the rules are very easy -- deux equipes -- two teams -- each with one orange -- une orange -- eine apfelsine -- un' arrancia -- held under the chin, like so -- (does it) comme ca -- and passed to the player behind you -- sans vous servir de vos mains -- using nothing but the chin -- no hands -- and keeping the orange at all costs from touching the floor
Commencez, Mesdames et Messieurs -- begin, ladies and gentlemen -- signore e signori, comminciate
The  now circulates, forming teams, telling the patrons to line up, making sure there is a woman next to every man
and  are the second couple in their line
Then the  picks up a basket of oranges and places one under the chin, held securely against the chest, of each man at the head of the line
Blowing a whistle, a signal for the game to begin and the band to play, the men turn to the women behind them and attempt to transfer the oranges from under their chins to under the chins of the women -- without using their hands
(This maneuver can only be accomplished by embracing one's partner passionately and firmly pressing the orange against the partner's throat until he or she can grip it tightly enough with the chin to turn and offer it to the person next in line, where the process begins anew
However, the slightest miscalculation, which can be brought about by any number of human frailties -- haste, modesty, inhibition or lack of co- ordination -- will surely result in losing control of the orange so that it either falls to the floor [where it can only be picked up by the chin] or it starts to roll and slide from its proper place to some other, less proper, spot on the human anatomy, forcing the man or the woman to retrieve it -- again, with the chin only
This latter is an activity which can prove extremely satisfying to old friends, or even new friends who wish to become old friends, but can only be a torment for total strangers and/or the English)
-- Some of the couples in various states of confusion, entanglement and intimacy -- all of them, naturally, hilarious
-- It is his turn to take the orange from a very short, but quite shapely young girl in a strapless dress (held up by an abundance of cantilever)
'takes' when he sees the twin obstacles which might -- and probably will -- encumber the game but increase his worldly experience
The contest begins: because of her stature he is forced to move in low, making the ordinary embrace needed for success difficult, if not impossible
Then, inexorably, the orange starts to slip down the 's front
Manfully he goes after it
-- She is enjoying it thoroughly
-- Bending over backwards, in a sort of frontal half-nelson, makes a last valiant effort and voila, grips the orange under his chin -- amid much cheering and congratulations from members of his
Now he turns to  and they face one another for a moment
En garde
Lay on, MacDuff
They go at it, working their bodies together to make it all possible
Then, for a moment, the game and the onlookers seem less important than their proximity
But, alas, they are too good despite themselves and the transfer is accomplished -- again with appreciative cheers from the
, with the orange now tucked firmly under her chin, turns to the next team-member in line and is locked in an embrace before she realizes her partner is  , the short, fat, balding man seen at the funeral and later in 's photo
starts to draw back but  holds her tightly
Putting his chin around the orange he is able to speak quietly in 's ear
-- Her eyes show her fright as he whispers: Mrs
Lampert -- What do you want
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs
Lampert
Tell me what
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs
Lampert -- you do know that, don't you
don't know anything
Mrs
Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead
Leave me alone --
Dead, Mrs
Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs
Lampert -- () Stop it
-- '  ' As  hauls off and kicks  full in the shin
-- He stiffens as the pain registers
Instead of shouting he merely closes his eyes
Including  and  and  standing by, as well as some spectators
comes quickly forward
Reggie -- what's the trouble
realizes that  no longer offers any resistance
She steps back, leaving  holding the orange, foolishly, under his chin, his eyes still closed
stares at him for a moment
He -- he was stepping on my foot
-- Slowly, his eyes open and tears stream from them, rolling down his cheeks
He speaks while holding the orange
Forgive me -- it was quite unintentional, 'm sure
turns to the woman behind him and the game resumes
(starting off) Wait for me --  won't be long
She goes off toward the rear of the club and starts down a flight of stairs
-- Watching her go, a concerned look on his face
-- small, dimly lit area with a door to the combination men's- women's room and a 'phone cabin with a solid door
The music and shouting from upstairs float down
comes down the stairs and goes to the 'phone, flicking on the light and closing the door after her
-- takes a jeton ('phone token) from her bag and drops it in the slot
Then she takes out a slip of paper (the one given her by ) and dials the number written on it
She listens to it ring, then evidently he answers
(into 'phone) Mr
Bartholomew -- it's me, Reggie Lampert -- listen Mr
Bartholomew: 've seen one of the (she stops) Mr
Bartholomew
Can you hear me
She realizes she has not pushed the button which takes her coin and allows the party at the other end to hear her voice
Hello -- Mr
Bartholomew -- it's me, Regina Lam
Suddenly the door of the booth opens and  wheels to look, slamming the receiver down as she does
-- '  -- , the second man from the funeral (and photo), the man in the corduroy suit and string tie, stands in the doorway, his face calm, a hand-rolled but unlit cigarette in his mouth
He has put one foot up against the side of the door so she can't leave
stares at him, terrified
Howdy, Miz Lampert
Wha -- what do you want
takes a book of matches from his pocket
You know what  want, Miz Lampert
No -- no, 'm don't
Come on now -- sure you do
An' you'd better give it to me, Miz Lampert -- cuz  ain't foolin'
No sireebob
He strikes a match and lights his cigarette, holding the burning match in his hand afterward
don't know what -- , without a word, throws the still-lit match into the booth, onto 's lap
She beats it out frantically
What are you doing
lights another match and throws it into her lap
She beats this one out too
Stop that
Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert -- He lights another match and reaches out toward her hair with it
She shrinks back
It could get a whole lot worse
Then he throws it into her lap
As he continues to speak he punctuates each phrase or so with another lit match is too busy beating them out to do anything else
It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' if you don't give it to me your life ain't gonna be worth the paper it's printed on
You savvy what 'm sayin', Miz Lampert
Please stop -- please
You think on it real careful-like, Miz Lampert -- y'hear
-- As she frantically beats out the matches, her eyes on her work
You're insane, absolutely insane
She looks up, then blinks her eyes
'   ' There is no one there
rises and steps out of the booth
-- As  looks around
There is no one there
As  returns, sits and starts to put another jeton into the slot
She notices her hand is shaking
She reaches back into her bag, removes a piece of candy, puts it into her mouth and leans her head back against the wall, closing her eyes
Suddenly the door opens and  shrieks -- but this time it is
What are you doing in here
(a sigh of relief) Having a nervous breakdown
-- and  enter the deserted lobby
You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there
-- 'm not sure if 'm supposed to tell you or not
don't think  follow you
He said if  told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me
Who said
That's what 'm not supposed to say
Stop this nonsense
If you're in some sort of trouble  want to know about it
Stop bullying me
Everybody's bullying me
wasn't -- Yes, you were -- you called it nonsense
Being murdered in cold blood isn't nonsense
Wait until it happens to you sometime
She goes to the desk, followed by , where the greets them sleepily
Bonsoir
Bonsoir
Quarante-deux, s'il vous plait
The   gets the key off a hook and hands it to Bonne nuit
(to ) Would you mind seeing me to the door
Of course not
They go to the elevator where he opens the door for her
-- As  and  enter the small cage
It is somewhat cramped, forcing them to stand close together
This is quite a place for making friends, isn't it
He presses the button and the elevator starts to rise
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something
(busy examining the cleft in his chin) How do you shave in there
What was it
What was what
What your husband was mixed up in
Look,  know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that 'm a woman and that you're a -- Don't you know  could already be arrested for transporting a minor above the first floor
The elevator stops
We're here
Where
On the street where you live
How about once more around the park
He reaches across her and opens the door
Out
-- As  leaves the elevator, followed by
They walk to her door
There is a moment of silence as she looks at him
(imitating ) Him: 'Do you mind if  come in for a nightcap, Reggie
' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late
' Him: 'Just one, all right
' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself
' Him: 'Sorry, baby, never make promises  can't keep
' How would you like a spanking
How would you like a punch in the nose
Stop treating me like a child
Then stop acting like one
If you're really in some kind of trouble, 'd like to hear about it
Otherwise, it's late, 'm tired and 'm going home to bed
Do you know what's wrong with you
What
Nothing
Good night
Good night
He turns and leaves
She smiles slightly, then turns and puts the key into the door and opens it
'  -- Featuring the door
enters, then stops abruptly, the doorknob still in her hand
The room has been torn apart
And standing in the center is , the large man in the battered raincoat
He starts slowly advancing toward
Where is it, lady -- where've you got it
-- (terrified) don't know --  don't know
don't -- She stops as she sees something
-- ' Instead of a human hand there is a twin-pronged metal one
sees where  is staring; looks down at it himself, then lunges at her, raising the hand to strike
want it -- give it to me -- it's mine
The hand is starting to come down
, moving quickly, turns and flies out
(screaming) Peter --
Peter --
-- As  runs out, slamming the door after her, the metal hand crashes against the wooden panel inside the door and splinters through it, visible on this side now
Petrified with fear,  can only stare dumbly at the protruding claw
As  comes running up to her
He sees the metal hand
man -- he tried to kill me
Pulling her aside,  takes hold of the key (still in the outside lock) and turns it slowly and quietly
Then, using all his weight, he slams the door open as far as it will go, making sure to hold it that way as he steps in
'  -- Inside,  pulls back the door and slugs the startled full on the jaw
His head bangs against the wall but he manages to raise a foot and push  violently away, sending him sprawling back, toppling across the bed and over, head first, onto the floor on the other side, where he disappears
Hurrying,  puts his foot against the door and pushes it away, ripping his metal hand free
He then rushes to the open window and climbs out
-- waits anxiously
When she hears nothing, she gingerly looks into the room
'  -- (entering cautiously) Peter --
(alarmed) Peter
Where are you
Showing the disarranged room, empty of people
Then, slowly 's hand appears from behind the bed, shaking groggily
rushes to him and helps him sit on the bed
Peter -- are you all right
think  sprained my pride
(He looks around) Where'd he go
Out of the window,  guess --  didn't see him
goes, unsteady on his feet, to the window and looks out
He then turns back
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me
'll be back in a minute
Be careful, Peter
(one leg over the sill) You took the words right out of my mouth
He climbs out
-- Outside the window to 's room is a small, false balcony, consisting mostly of railing, with barely enough room between it and the building's facade for a man to stand
appears and looks down over the railing
( ) -- ; there is no one on the street and it is too far to jump
--  -- He now looks around
's is the last such balcony on one side, but there are two or three on the other
climbs over the railing and, holding on to it with one hand, reaches for the railing on the next balcony
-- ' As it stretches for the railing; it is several inches short of touching it
-- As he straightens up and prepares to jump
-- From the
, high above, jumps to the next balcony
-- As he climbs over the railing of the second balcony
He sees a light coming through the window and looks in
'  (
) Oh
leaves the window quickly, climbing over the railing on his way to the next balcony
As he does, the following exchange is heard (in British English)
'  (
) What is it now, Pamela
'  (
) It happened again, Henry -- another strange man peered in the window at me and then went away
'  (
) Bad luck, Pamela
-- From the  as  jumps to the next balcony
-- As he climbs over the rail to the third balcony
There is a light coming from this window, too
looks in
--  --  ' Inside the room are , , and  in the midst of a heated discussion
That was a dumb move, Herman -- a dumb move
And then some
If you'd only told us you was goin' to her room we could've kept 'em busy -- '   -- -- but sneakin' in there on your own that-a-way, why, man, you was bound to get yore tokus kicked
mean, what'd you think he'd do -- walk up 'n' shake you by that hand o' yores
'  (
) That's right, Herman -- you didn't leave me much choice
They all turn toward the window
As  climbs in through the window and joins them
(to ) didn't hurt you, did
shakes his head and turns away
(eagerly) Never mind that -- did you get the money
How could  with the three Marx Brothers breathing down my neck
You said you'd let me handle it alone -- The girl trusts me
If she's got it, 'll find out about it
But you've got to leave me alone
(to  and ) We took all the chances
The money belongs to us, not him
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor
Yeah
What's that
He took care of Charlie for us
(to ) We appreciate it, really we do
But who asked him
Three shares are enough -- 'd say he's out
third of nothing is nothing, Herman
Make up your minds -- she's waiting for me
(thoughtfully) don't see how another twenty-four hours could hurt
Shoot no, not after all these years
Then he gets it out of your share, not mine
Not mine
turns and storms out of the door, slamming it
begins sneezing, takes a bottle of pills from his pocket and swallows two white tablets
suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success
(chuckling) That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly
Who's got the room next to hers
Me
How come
Get another one, will you
'm going to need it
starts for the door
If you do find the money -- you won't forget t' tell us about it, will you, fella
(turning at the door) Don't worry
Oh,  ain't worryin' -- but see this pudgy little fella here
(indicating ) He worries -- an' he's even meaner'n am
'  -- As she waits anxiously, smoking a cigarette
There is a at the door
Who is it
'  (
) It's me
Peter
unlocks the door and opens it
enters and she closes the door again -- There was no trace of him
All right, Reggie -- suppose you tell me what this is all about
There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think  have something that belongs to them
What
quarter of a million dollars
is silent for a moment
Go on
That's all
No, it isn't -- where's the money
don't know
Those men killed Charles to get it
But he must not have had it with him on the train
So they think he left it with you
But he didn't
've looked everywhere -- (tears welling) And if  don't find it -- (wailing) Those men going to kill me
She falls in his arms to be comforted
No, they won't --  won't let them
(sobbing) Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one  can trust
Of course 'll help --  told you would, didn't
Come on now -- He takes out his handkerchief and dries her eyes
'm so hungry  could faint
(trying to smile) 've -- 've gotten your suit all wet
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry
Peter, you've got to promise me something
Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did
Why do people have to tell lies
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them
Do you tell lies
pause
The phone rings
answers it
(into the phone) Hello
'  -- holds the receiver in his metal hand
Mrs
Lampert
-- it's me -- the man who was in your room a few minutes ago -- '  -- (on the phone) What do you want
(whispering) Who is it
(covering the receiver) The man you had the fight with
-- (on the phone) Is Dyle with you
'  -- -- Who
-- (on the phone) The man who hit me, lady -- Dyle -- that's his name
What's wrong -- is he still there
'  -- 's back is turned to  so he can't see her face
He watches her
(on the phone) Yes -- that's right
What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying
She shakes her head
-- (on the phone) Don't trust him -- don't tell him anything
He's after the money
He hangs up
'  -- Slowly,  lowers the 'phone from her ear and hangs it up
She hesitates a moment
What'd he say
He -- he said if  didn't give the money, he'll kill me
wouldn't take that too seriously
believe what he said
They're only trying to scare you, that's all
How do you know what they're doing
don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it -- What are you talking about
You mustn't let what he said bother you
It was only words
(softly) Words can hurt very much
(a pause) Go to sleep -- 'll see you in the morning
Don't put yourself out
Hey -- 'm on your side
Remember that
Yes, 'll remember
Good night
Good night
He starts out, pausing by the door and examining the hole made in it
But if you'll take my advice -- (smiling) You'll undress in the closet
Oh, and if you need me, just bang on the wall
'll be next door
--   -- As  (now called ) leaves 's room and closes the door
He pauses for a moment, listening, hears nothing, then bends down and starts pulling at a loose thread in one of his socks
As usual, the thread unravels -- and unravels -- and unravels some more until it seems that the entire sock has come unknit
Now, taking the long thread, he bends down near the door and, taking his tie-pin, attaches one end of the thread to the bottom of 's door
He then runs the thread along the floor to his door (next door) and works it underneath
'  -- As  enters, the thread in his hand
He goes to a nearby table where he attaches the thread to the heavy room key, which he then balances on the extreme edge of the table
'  -- is on the phone
(excited) -- But  am calm, Mr
Bartholomew -- what  called to tell you was there's someone else -- someone who wasn't in that photograph you showed me
He says his name is Peter Joshua -- but it isn't -- it's Dyle
(a pause) Mr
Bartholomew
-- are you still there
'  -- on the phone
He is silent for a moment, his face troubled
don't know who this Mr
Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband
'  -- (on the phone) You mean he might have -- Mr
Bartholomew, 'm catching the next plane out of here -- 'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me
'  -- (on the phone) Where are you now -- can you meet me
Do you know Les Halles
'  -- (on the phone) Yes, where
(a pause) -- in fifteen minutes
'll be there
'  -- hangs up the phone, picks up her bag, checks her hair in the mirror, then starts for the door
She stops as she notices the connecting door leading to the room next door, 's room
She goes to it, silently slips out the key and bends to peer through the keyhole
'  --  ( ) is removing his coat
Before he lays it over a chair, he takes a gun from the inside pocket, checks it, and tucks it into his belt
'  -- reacts in surprise and fright, jumps quickly away from the door
She hurries to the door leading to the hall and reaches for the knob
'  -- --
The thread attached to it is pulled (by the action of 's door opening) and the key falls to the floor with a clatter
Including  as he reacts, his head wheeling to look at the key
Snatching his coat, he runs for the door
--   -- As  sneaks past 's door
When she has passed, the door opens and  appears
takes off on the run, turning the corner and starting down the stairs
Reggie --
He starts after her
-- It is deserted, except for the sleeping  , as comes running down the stairs
'  (
) Reggie
She turns, looking back towards the sound of his voice, but does not slacken her speed
She runs out the front door
-- As  runs out
She looks up the street, sees a  and hails it
Taxi --
It pulls over to the curb
Looking once more over her shoulder she takes a bill out of her pocket, opens the cab door, slams it loudly without getting in and hands the bill to the driver
'importe ou -- vite
Allez-y
She jumps back into the shadows of a nearby doorway as the pulls away
At the same time  runs out of the hotel
Another  is coming down the street
hails it frantically
Taxi --
Taxi --
It pulls up and  opens the door
(pointing) Follow that taxi
Comment
Taxi
Follow
Je ne comprends rien
Desperately,  reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a small dictionary and begins flipping through the pages
-- In the shadows
She lifts her eyes in annoyance
-- (finding the word) Suivre -- el taxi
Ah
Oui, Monsieur
comes out of the shadows, looks after 's taxi, then hails another one which pulls up
(to ) Aux Halles -- vite
-- and  walking
The Central Market is teeming with activity -- trucks creeping around other trucks, cases of fruit and vegetables stacked on every inch of sidewalk, of all types milling around, unloading trucks and stacking crates, little electric carts scooting in and out -- and nearby, one of the huge, high-roofed sheds where the butchers work
-- them as they walk
(looking around) Incredible, isn't it
Zola called it 'le ventre de Paris' -- the womb of Paris, the belly
She takes a banana from a nearby stall
(peeling it) What did you want to see me about, Mr
Bartholomew
(leaves a coin on the crate) Were you followed
Yes, but  lost him
really did it quite brilliantly
'm beginning to think women make the best spies
Agents
He has a gun, Mr
Bartholomew -- saw it
Who
Dyle, or whatever his name is
What does your Mr
Dyle look like, Mrs
Lampert
He's hardly my Mr
Dyle
Describe him
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, 'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really
(shaking his head) No
No, what
That's not Carson Dyle
(stopping) Carson
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs
Lampert -- that's Carson
You mean you've known about him all along
Why didn't you tell me
looks at her for a moment, then glances around; his attention is drawn inside the doorway
It's enough to make you a vegetarian, isn't it
'  -- Almost as far as the eye can see, row upon row of beef sides, hung on hooks
--    () As  looks at the hanging beef
It's just lucky that 'm not hanging next to one of those things right now
She shudders, throws away her banana and turns back to Mr
Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle
didn't see any point
Dyle's dead
Dead
Mr
Bartholomew -- maybe you'd better tell me what this thing's all about
-- Lined up at a zinc bar are several , their white smocks stained with blood
and  sit at the table
suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two
Barely, yes
In 1944, five members of the
-- the military espionage unit -- were ordered behind the German lines for the purpose of delivering $250,000 in gold to the French Underground
The five men -- arrives
Vous desirez
(smiling) They always do that
(to the ) Cafe
Gratinee, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge
Mrs
Lampert,  really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here
Can  at least keep the onion soup
shrugs
(to the ) La soupe tout simplement
The  nods and goes
(anxiously) Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground -- Yes
The five men
They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle
But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact
It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money
Steal it how
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it
All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked
(fascinated) May  have a cigarette, please
pulls out a package and she takes one, looks at it and rips off the filter tip
He winces
hate these things -- it's like drinking coffee through a veil
She puts the other end in her mouth, then picks up the matches and lights it
Everything went smoothly enough until after the gold was buried -- then, before they could get out, they were ambushed by a German patrol
machine gun separated Scobie from his right hand -- and caught Carson Dyle full in the stomach
takes another cigarette from his pack, rips off the filter (he winces again) and puts it into her mouth
What's wrong with that one
He points to the cigarette she just lit, still practically brand-new in the ashtray
Oh
Nothing,  guess
What happened then
She hands over the newer one to , who sadly examines its mutilated end while  returns to the first cigarette
Have you any idea what these things cost over here
Please go on, Mr
Bartholomew -- what happened then
Scobie was able to travel, but Carson Dyle was clearly dying, so they -- The  returns with the coffee and onion soup
La soupe, c'est pour qui
Pour moi
Go on, Mr
Bartholomew
The  puts down the cup and bowl and leaves
Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him
They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end
Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others
He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared
It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again
But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them
We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof
But what has all this got to do with the
, Mrs
Lampert
We're an extension of the wartime
It was our money and we want it back
'm sorry, Mr
Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind
still intend leaving Paris -- tonight
wouldn't advise that, Mrs
Lampert
You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave
Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go
In fact,  don't even see any point in your changing hotels
Please help us, Mrs
Lampert
Your government is counting on you
Well, if 'm going to die,  might as well do it for my country
That's the spirit
Oh, stop it
What do you want me to do
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle
Maybe he really is Dyle
He could still be alive
No, Mrs
Lampert
But no one actually saw him die
No, Mrs
Lampert
His death is registered with the War Department in Washington
Oh
Then who's this one
don't know -- but  think you'd better find out, don't you
Me
Why me
You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you
(grinning) Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies
(resigned) Agents
(
) -- leaves the hotel and turns into the Place
moment later,  comes cautiously from the hotel
As she watches , a - advertising a driving school passes the hotel
falls in behind him, his tall placard hiding her from view
-- First comes , passing a sidewalk cafe on the corner, then the - and
The - turns off, leaving  out in the open
moment later, passes a  painting a canvas, her easel set up in the middle of the sidewalk
He stops when he has passed her and turns to look at her work
, not knowing what to do, and afraid she will be seen by , who is now looking her way, spins and sits at the sidewalk cafe's nearest table, her back to
It is already occupied by a middle-aged -- The , complete with camera, beret and guide book, looks up from his coffee, surprised
He stares at  and she stares back
Finally, not knowing what else to do, she smiles, then takes a portion of his brioche and eats it
He smiles back emptily, not knowing what to make of her
turns to look at
-- He has made his judgment of the painting and now moves on
-- The  has finally found the courage to speak
As he opens his mouth to make a sound, , her eyes on , rises quickly from the table and goes, leaving a very confused with his mouth open
He blinks, then leaves some money on the table and starts after her
-- following
As she passes the  painting, she cannot resist turning to see the work
-- An abstract jumble, nothing recognizable
-- As she looks from the painting to reality
-- As the scene really looks
-- She shrugs, continues after
Now we see that the , in turn, is following her
(calling) Fraulein -- doesn't stop
Fraulein -- (turning but continuing) What are you doing, following me
Stop it -- we're going to look like a parade
She continues after
The  hesitates, then continues after her
-- He goes to the curb and starts to step off, attempting to cross the Rue Danton, but finds the light against him
He turns back in 's direction
-- Realizing she has to do something before  spots her, she turns and takes the 's arm and starts walking with him back toward the cafe
(smiling and rattling on) How are you
When did you arrive in town
Are you enjoying Paris
It's lovely, isn't it
So many wonderful things to see and do, it makes one's head spin to think of it
She looks back over her shoulder and sees that  is now crossing the Rue Danton, heading for the platform of a bus now stopped at the curb
(smiling) Fraulein -- pulls away from him
If you don't stop following me 'll call the police
She leaves him standing there, more confused than ever, as she starts after  again
has hopped on the back of the bus as it pulls away
hurries across the street, hailing a taxi
Taxi --
-- enters
with him to the head of a stairway leading downstairs, a sign indicating that it leads to the "  &
"   back to the door as enters
-- walks to one of several windows
sign over it reading: " -
" -- comes down the stairs
Suddenly she stops
-- in to sign on "
" -- confused look on her face
-- As his turn comes, he addresses the Dyle, please
-  -  -
Yes, Mr
Dyle
remember
-- Watching
-- The  takes out a bundle of letters and quickly sorts through it
'm sorry, Mr
Dyle -- nothing today
Thanks -- see you soon
He turns and heads out, starting up the stairs where was but is no longer
As he reaches the fourth or fifth step, a  is heard over the loudspeaker
(
) Mr
Dyle, please -- you're wanted on the telephone -- Mr
Dyle
Cabin 4
stops in his tracks, pondering what to do
(
) Mr
Dyle
Cabin 4, please
He stops and comes down the stairs, going to the back of the room and into the cabin marked "4
" (picking up the phone) Yes
across an empty cabin to discover  in the third one, on the phone
' on the phone
' on the phone
Good morning, Mr
Dyle
Reggie
It's the only name 've got
How about you
No cat and mouse -- you've got me
What do you want to know
Why you lied to me
had to -- for all  knew you could have been in on the whole thing
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are
But you know my name -- it's Dyle
Carson Dyle is dead
Yes, he is
He was my brother
Your -- The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but  think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold
think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him
'm trying to prove it
They think 'm working with them
But 'm not, and that's the truth
'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that
How can
You lied to me -- the way Charles did -- and after promising you wouldn't
Oh,  want to believe you, Peter
oh, but  can't call you that anymore, can
It will take me a while to get used to your new name -- which  don't even know yet
What is it
(pause) Aren't you going to tell me
(pause) Hello --
She opens the door of the cabin and starts out
-- As  steps out of her cabin and starts looking in the others
They are all occupied except one and she looks inside it
-- The receiver hangs by its cord, swinging back and forth
-- As she looks at it, confused
-- and  stand together, waiting for the elevator, clearly holding a gun in the pocket of his raincoat
(quietly) If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, 'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now
Okay
You'll wreck your raincoat
The self-service elevator doors open, one or two come out and  and  enter
young  starts in after them
Next car, please
He reaches out and presses the top button with his metal hand
The doors close
-- As  follows  out of the elevator
looks around -- there is an open door at the end of a short hall
He and  go to it,
Through the door, which  closes behind them, is a flight of stairs, leading up to a second floor
Okay -- turn around
turns to find 's gun out of the pocket and pointing at him
now transfers it to his metal hand and goes to , where he proceeds to frisk him
Finding the gun  carries in his inside coat pocket, removes it
During the following conversation he will shake open the revolving magazine and let the bullets fall out onto the floor before handing back the emptied gun to
Then he will transfer his own gun back to his good hand
Sit down
Shrugging,  sits on the third step
What now
We wait -- with our mouths shut
-- The last  leave the building as the  locks the front door after them
-- In the semi-darkness,  is still sitting on the third step,  still facing him with a gun
How long do you intend --
said with the mouth shut
yawns wide
Sorry about that
Okay -- up there
gets to his feet and starts up the stairs, followed by stops at the door
Do  knock or something
Open it
opens the door
The stairs continue up
Keep going
The view had better be worth it
--  -- spectacular view of the Paris rooftops and the city lights beyond
and  come out onto a level portion of roof
On the street side, the roof angles down abruptly into a steep, slate-covered pitch, broken only by two widely separated oval-shaped dormer windows
Below these is a rain gutter, then nothing -- for seven stories
Very pretty
Now what
'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me
Where's the money
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that
She has it -- you know that
And  say maybe you both have it
One more time, Dyle -- where is it
Supposing  did have it -- which don't -- do you really think 'd hand it over
You're out, Dyle -- right now
aims the gun and starts advancing toward
Step back
turns and looks -- there is nothing behind him but a sheer drop to the street
Back where
That's the idea
Moving quickly,  lashes out and hacks 's gun hand with the side of his palm and the gun falls to the roof
Following through,  punches the large man full in the jaw, but instead of falling,  wraps his arm around , holding on tightly until his head clears
Then, to his amazement,  is lifted into the air and, unable to break the bear-hold, carried toward the edge of the roof
Working his arms between their two bodies, suddenly flails them out with all his strength and the hold is broken, but at the price of his coat and the flesh on his back as 's metal claw rips through both, a wound extending from the center of 's back to his shoulder
Both men look around for the gun, spot it simultaneously and leap for it, both landing short of the mark
Now they grapple with one another, each trying to break free and reach for the gun
-- Two hands, one real, one metal, inch toward the gun
-- The battle is going to  whose weight and strength are beginning to tire , who is now on his back, trying to stop  from crawling over him
He has the large man by both lapels of the raincoat in a last-ditch effort to hold him
But , his face horribly distorted from the strain, continues to inch forward toward the gun
Suddenly,  releases his hold
With nothing restraining him,  lurches forward, tumbling past the gun, his momentum carrying him onto the sloping part of the roof, where he begins sliding down
beats wildly at the the slate with his claw, trying to gouge a grip
-- ' As it slides across the slate, making a hideous scratching sound and causing sparks to fly
-- As he slides over the edge and disappears
-- As he watches, hypnotized
-- There appears to be no sign of
Then ' metal hand, gripping the rain gutter at the very edge
-- Having seen the claw, he rises and walks to the very edge of the level part of the roof
Herman
-- As he hangs, seven stories over the street, by his metal hand
Yeah
-- He finds it hard to believe
How are you doing
'  (
) How do you think
If you get bored, try writing 'Love thy neighbor' a hundred times on the side of the building
turns and leaves going down the stairs
--   -- The   is busy taping a piece of cardboard over the hole ripped in 's door by 's metal hand the night before
leaves the elevator and goes to his own door
The  eyes him coldly
"takes" the look
didn't do it
The next time madame forgets her key, there is another one at the desk
smiles, then enters his room
'  -- He closes the door and starts to remove his torn coat, wincing
'  -- , smoking on the bed, sits up when she hears  moving about in his room
She goes to the connecting door, unlocks her side, tries the knob, finds it still bolted from his side and knocks
Is that you
'  -- goes to the door, throws back the bolt and opens the door
enters
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to -- (seeing his injured back) What happened
met a man with sharp nails
Scobie
left him hanging around the American Express
Come on -- 've got something that stings like crazy
She leads him into her room
'  -- As  and  enter from his room
She leads him to the bed
Take off your shirt and lie down
As  goes to the bathroom,  takes off his torn shirt, revealing a torn and bloody -shirt
He lies face downwards on the bed
returns, carrying cotton, gauze, tape, scissors, and disinfectant
She sits next to him and lifts up his -shirt to examine the wound
(wincing) Listen -- all  really want is an estimate
It's not so bad
You may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you
She wets the cotton with disinfectant and begins cleaning the wound
He winces
Does it hurt
Haven't you got a bullet  can bite
She continues working on his back, cleaning it, then bandaging it while they talk
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother
Would you like to see my passport
Your passport
What kind of a proof is that
Would you like to see where  was tattooed
Sure
Okay, 'll drive you around there some day
(his back stinging) Ouch
Ha ha
You could at least tell me what your first name is these days
Alexander
Is there a Mrs
Dyle
Yes, but we're divorced
thought that was Peter Joshua
(smiling) 'm no easier to live with than he was
(finishing the bandage) There -- you're a new man
As they continue talking, he rises from the bed and goes into his own room
remains on the bed, watching him through the open door as he puts on a fresh -shirt and shirt
'm sorry  couldn't tell you the truth, but  had to find out your part in all this
Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not
You can't
There must be some way
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie
So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot
He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he
Why couldn't you just look at his feet
Because he's wearing moccasins
Oh
Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course
Why not a lying Blackfoot
(confused) Which one are you
(entering, smiling) Whitefoot, of course
Come here
He goes to the bed
Sit down
He sits
hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex --  could be very happy hanging around the tepee
Reggie -- listen to me -- Oh-oh -- here it comes
The fatherly talk
You forget 'm already a widow
So was Juliet -- at fifteen
'm not fifteen
Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me
Why can't you be serious
There, you said it
Said what
Serious
When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear
don't want to be serious -- and  especially don't want you to be
Okay -- 'll tell you what -- we'll just sit around all day long being frivolous -- how about that
She starts kissing him on the neck, on the chin, on the cheek
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out
(pulling back) Okay
What are you doing
Cutting it out
Who told you to do that
You did
But 'm not through complaining yet
Oh
(She starts kissing him again) Now please, Reggie -- cut it out
think  love you, Alex -- She kisses him on the mouth
The phone rings
He tries to talk as she continues kissing him
(mumbling) The phone's ringing -- Whoever it is won't give up -- and neither will
The phone continues to ring and she continues to kiss him
Finally,  reaches out to the bedstand and takes the phone off the hook
She brings the receiver up to their mouths and mumbles into it
(on phone) Sorry --  was just -- uh -- nibbling on something
'  -- speaks into the phone
Miz Lampert, my buddies 'n me, we'd oblige it mighty highly if you could mosey on across the hall 'n chew the fat with us for a spell
'  -- is watching her
(on the phone) Can you give me one good reason why should
'  -- (on the phone) Yes, ma'am
little one -- 'bout seven or eight years old
Th' little tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie -- ain't that cute
'  -- She covers the phone and turns to  in alarm
They've got Jean-Louis
That sounds like their problem
(into the phone) 'll be right there
'  -- (on the phone) We'll be waitin' in room forty-seven, Miz Lampert -- so you just wiggle on over
'  -- As  hangs up
What day is it
Tuesday
Lord,  forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me
They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they
don't know -- it depends on whether or not they've already eaten
'  -- -- -
He looks around, uncertainly, first one way, then the other
to show him sitting on 's knee, the large man holding him with his good hand, the metal one in his pocket
sits next to them while  nervously paces the floor
When  begins sneezing he takes the small bottle of pills from his pocket and downs one or two, swallowing some water
Hey, Tex -- move the kid to the other knee or something, will you
My leg's going to sleep
lifts - and puts him down on 's other knee
Upsy-daisy
- Are you a real cowboy
Sure am
- Then where is your gun
(taking out his gun) Right here -- see
Will you put that thing away
at the door
goes to open it
and enter
She sees - and 's gun
Jean-Louis
She snatches him off 's lap
Howdy, Miz Lampert
(glaring at ) Who invited you
Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, see
'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic
She starts for the door with -
blocks her way
'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs
Lampert
But his mother -- She isn't going to be anybody's mother unless you answer some questions
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert
We want that money -- now
(forcefully) Be quiet, all of you
The   look at him, surprised by his tone
And stop threatening that boy
He doesn't have the money
Mrs
Lampert doesn't either
Then who does
don't know, Herman -- maybe you do
Me
(to ) Or you -- (to ) Or you -- ,  & (together) That's the most ridiculous --
You gone loco
Listen to the man
Slowly
Suppose one of you found Charles here in Paris, followed him, cornered him on the train, threw him out the window and took the money
(after a pause) That's a crock
If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up
But he'd have to
If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened
Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home
That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before
pause as the   look at one another
Up till now we always figured she had the money -- but you know so much about it, maybe you've got it
Then what am  doing here
You didn't know anything about me -- 'm the only one who could have taken it and kept right on going
He's just tryin' to throw us off
They've got it,  tell you
Why don't we search their rooms
(exchanging looks with ) It's all right with us -- (rising) What are we wastin' time for
Let's go
And while we're waiting, we might as well go through yours
(stopping) Not my room
What's wrong, Herman -- have you got something to hide
(a pause, then smiling) Then  take it there are no objections
The   look at one another unhappily
We'd better exchange keys
Here's mine
'll take that
He takes 's key and gives  his
goes to , takes her key and gives her his own
Mine's in the door
Ariva durchy, y'all
The   file out
and  exchange looks
Come on -- let's get busy
Who gets your vote
Scobie -- he's the one that objected
(handing her the boy) He's all yours
'll do Tex and Gideon
Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside
Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to have a treasure hunt
- (joining them) Oh, la
If  find the treasure, will win a prize
(to ) What should we give him
How about $25,000
Or do you think it would spoil him
She smiles, takes -' hand and leaves
turns to survey 's room
He goes first to the drawer in the night table -- empty; and the bed, looking in it and under it
Then he goes to the desk and opens the drawers -- also empty
The bureau is next -- he opens all three double drawers and they, too, are completely empty
Frowning, he goes to the armoire and opens it -- shelves and hanging bar are likewise bare
Then,   , he sees the only thing he's found so far in the room -- a pair of fine cowboy boots
'  -- --
to include , staring down at it as it lies on the table in the center of the room
(eyes on the bag) Tex
Including , busy going through the bureau
He looks up, then joins
What's that
empties the contents of the bag on the table, then starts examining the various items
He opens the wallet
- Inside, the initials "
" are printed in gold
'  (
) Charlie's stuff
'  (
) Looks like it
--  & Mebbe we'd better call Herman
has put the wallet aside and now picks up the letter, removing it from the envelope and reading it
What for
If it's not here, why bother him
And if it is
(a pause) Why bother him
broad grin from
They continue going through the items from the bag
You sure nuthin's missin'
No
The police have kindly provided us with a list
takes the list, examines it, then folds it and puts it in his pocket
They finish with the items from the bag
There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million
Not unless we're blind
(staring at ) You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream
Meaning what
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said --  mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all
(very sincerely) You know 'd tell you if  had it
Nachurly
Jus' like 'd tell you
Nachurly
And that goes for Herman, too
& (together) Nachurly
The   look at one another, then smile -- then laugh
'  -- on the phone, - standing by
-- He's all right, Sylvie, honestly
Just hurry up and get here
She hangs up and turns to -
Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it
- know
would bury it in the garden
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden
- Oh
(Afterthought) Neither do
(Seeing something) Voila
Voila what
- (pointing) Up there
would put it up there
looks to where - is pointing -- to the top of the high armoire
You know something, cookie
Why not
Taking one of the straight chairs to the armoire, she stands on it
Although she is still not high enough to see anything, by standing on tip-toes she is able to reach with her hand over the top and grope around blindly
hope  don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait
There is something
If  can just -- yes, 'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy
- (jumping up and down) found it
found it
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy
- (ecstatic) We won
We won
has finally managed to pull down the case -- a rectangular black bag about the size and shape of a trombone case
As he climbs off the chair, - suddenly runs to the door, unbolts it and runs into the hall, with him
-   - As - runs out into the hall, shouting
- We found it
We found it
is the first one to appear, coming out of 's room
has also appeared from 's room, followed by
- We found it
The   rush by - and squeeze simultaneously into 's room
'  -- As ,  and  enter,  is placing the little straight black chair to its original position
There is no sign of the black case
Reggie --
Did you find it
No
What do you mean, no
The kid said -- - (pointing atop the armoire) Up there
It is up there
No, Jean-Louis
grabs the chair and moves it to the armoire, climbing up on it and grabbing the bag
It's nothing,  tell you
He brings it to the table as  and  crowd around him, anxious to see
() The ring of faces, one at a time
, his jaw muscles working feverishly; , his eyes unblinking, a slight smile on his lips; , his mouth open greedily
As  finally springs the latches and opens the lid
-- Inside, neatly packed in velvet fittings, like the parts of a musical instrument, are various portions of and attachments for a metal artificial hand
'  (
) Jumpin' frejoles -- it's Herman's spare
-- As they stare at the case, surprised and just a little embarrassed
Slowly  lowers the lid
The  avoid looking at one another
Including  and - by the door
Where is he
The  look at one another
Hey, that's right
(already running) He's in my room
The   hurry past  and - and out of the door
- What is the matter
--   -- , , and , followed by  and - cross the hall to 's room
turns the key which is still in the door
He enters, followed by the others
'  -- ,  and  stand in the center of the room, looking around
and - wait in the open doorway
The room looks like a cyclone hit the place, but there is no sign of
The sound of running water can be heard coming from behind the closed door to the bathroom and  is the first to notice the water beginning to leak out from under the door
Reggie -- you and the boy better wait here
-- , still dressed in his raincoat, lies face up, his head submerged in the filled tub, the water now pouring over the edge
His face is distorted
's hand appears and turns off the water
,  and  staring at
Now who'da done a mean thing like that
(looking carefully at both) 'm not quite sure
This ain't my room
Mine, either
(considering the situation) The police aren't going to like this one bit
(helpful) We could dry him off and take him down the hall to his own room
(looking at the body) He really doesn't look so bad
We could put him to bed 'n let one o' them fem-de-chambers find him in the mornin'
and  look at one another
Poor ol' Herman -- him 'n good luck always was strangers
Maybe now he'll meet up with his other hand someplace -- but  sure hope it ain't waitin' for him in Heaven
'  -- --
The dead man's eyes are open, his jaw hanging, his head lying crazily on the pillow
to show him lying in bed, dressed in his pajamas
for a    of a , her eyes widening as the realization that the man is dead strikes her
Then she screams
'  -- --
The policeman is apoplectic
No
No
No
No
to include, , ,  and , all sitting silently in the 's office
man drowned in his bed -- impossible
And in his pajamas -- the second one in his pajamas -- c'est trop bete
Stop lying to me -- (Tapping the side of his nose) this nose tells me when you are lying -- it is never mistaken, not in twenty- three years -- this nose will make me commissaire of police
(Tapping his fingers on his desk) Mr
Dyle or Mr
Joshua -- which is it
Dyle
And yet you registered in Megeve as Mr
Joshua
Do you know it is against the law to register under an assumed name
No,  didn't
It's done in America all the time
raps for silence on his desk
During the pause, he looks into each face in turn
None of you will be permitted to leave Paris -- until this matter is cleared up
Only  warn you -- will be watching
We use the guillotine in this country --  have always suspected that the blade coming down causes no more than a slight tickling sensation on the back of the neck
It is only a guess, of course --  hope none of you ever finds out for certain
--   () and  walking along the quai, next to the Seine, Who do you think did it -- Gideon
Maybe
Or Tex
Maybe
You're a big help
Can  have one of those
They have passed an ice-cream wagon on the corner of the Pont au Double
shrugs
(to the ) Vanille-chocolat
During the following, the  makes a double-decker cone and hands it to
pays and they resume their walk -- all with no break in the dialogue
think Tex did it
Why
Because  really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect
Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it
What's so illogical about that
) It's always the person you don't suspect; ) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore ) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon
Oh
guess they just can't help it
Who
Women
You know,  can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie
(a pause) Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that
What -- like Scobie
No -- Gene Kelly
Remember the way he danced down there next to the river in 'American in Paris' -- without a care in the world
This is good, want some
She offers him her cone, thrusting it forward with enough force to dislodge the ice-cream
It lands right next to his lapel, over his outside breast pocket
(frowning) 'd love some, thanks
'm sorry
He pulls open the pocket with two sticky fingers and looks inside, then shakes his head sadly at what he sees still holds the empty cone, not knowing what to do with it
Seeing this, he takes it and sticks it into his pocket
No sense messing up the streets
Alex -- Hm
'm scared
Don't worry, 'm not going to hit you
No, about Scobie,  mean
can't think of any reason why he was killed
They resume walking
Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many -- What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three
He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too
Yes,  know
First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something
Any minute now we could be assassinated
Would you do anything like that
(surprised) What
Assassinate somebody
No -- Including the Cathedral of   in the background
-- swing down from there on a rope to save the woman you love -- like Charles Laughton in 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame'
--   -- As  and  step from the elevator
Hurry up and change -- 'm starved
Let me know what you want -- 'll pick a suit that matches
He goes into his room and she goes into hers
'  -- She enters, fixes her hair in the mirror, then goes to the door connecting her room with 's
She unlocks it, tries to open it, but finds it locked
Disappointed, she knocks
'  (
) What do you want
It's the house detective -- why haven't you got a girl in there
'  -- He calls to her through the closed door as he empties his pockets
Lord, you're a pest
'  (
) Can  come in
'd like to take a bath
'  -- Wouldn't it be better if you did it in my room
'  (
) What for
wouldn't want to use that tub
Besides,  don't want to be alone
'm afraid
'  -- 'm only next door -- if anything happens, holler
He sits down to take off his shoes, but is interrupted by the sound of  screaming
He races for the connecting door, pulls back the bolt and rushes in
'  -- As  enters
Reggie
He wheels as the door is slammed and , who had been standing behind it, locks it and pockets the key
Got you
Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf
The shower's in there
He goes to the door leading to the hall and finds that locked as well
She smiles at him
(warning) Reggie -- open the door
This is a ludicrous situation
There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower
Then  suggest you call one of them
dare you
looks at her, then sits down and starts to remove his shoes
(has she gone too far
) What are you doing
Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on
(to himself) What a nut
Shoes off,  starts for the bathroom, humming
usually sing a medley of old favorites when  bathe -- any requests
Shut the door
don't think  know that one
Testing the water with his hand, he now steps in fully dressed
can't believe her eyes
She goes to the open door for a closer look
What on earth are you doing
-- -- In the shower, making sure his suit gets uniformly soaked
(explaining pleasantly) Drip-dry
He takes the soap and begins washing as if he were washing himself without the suit
The suit needs it more than  do, anyway
How often do you go through this little ritual
As he takes out his handkerchief and rinses it
Every day
The manufacturer recommends it
don't believe it
He opens his coat and reads a label inside
"Wearing this suit during washing will help protect its shape
" He flicks a little water in her face, then takes the nail- brush and scrubs his watch and watch-band
He holds up his wrist so she can see the watch
Waterproof
He begins unbuttoning his suit
She turns and leaves, slamming the door after her
'  -- As  goes to the armoire to select a dress
The rings and she answers it
(into phone) Yes --
'  -- -- (on the phone) Mrs
Lampert
-- Bartholomew
've spoken to Washington, Mrs
Lampert -- '  -- (on the phone) Go ahead, Mr
Bartholomew -- 'm listening
'  -- (on the phone) told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother
asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs
Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother
'  -- --  on the phone, looking like the rug has been pulled out from under her
(pause, quietly) Are you sure there's no mistake
'  -- (on the phone) None whatsoever
Please, Mrs
Lampert -- be careful
'  -- slowly lowers the phone to its cradle, a worried expression on her face
Then the bathroom door opens and appears dressed in a large bath towel
Her back is to him
left all my drip-dry dripping -- is it all right
She doesn't answer
Reggie -- is something wrong
She shakes her head
You're probably weak from hunger
You've only had five meals today
Hurry up and we'll go out
She turns and looks at him
Do you mind if we go someplace crowded
--  feel like lots of people tonight
-   -- The large motor launch, moving along the river, gaily ablaze with lights
--    () At a table for two by the rail, the city slowly passing in the b
g
Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes
keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me
Nothing's going to happen to you while 'm around --  want you to believe that
How can  believe it when you don't even know who the killer is
've got that right, haven't
You don't know who did it
No -- not yet
But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it
Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so
Are you trying to say that  might have killed Charles and Scobie
She doesn't answer
What do  have to do to satisfy you -- become the next victim
It's a start, anyway
don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder
Carson Dyle didn't have a brother
She rises from the table and walks away
hesitates a moment, then follows
can explain if you'll just listen
Will you listen
(looking at the river) can't very well leave without a pair of water wings
Okay
Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list
Fiction or non-fiction
Why don't you shut up
Well
Are you going to listen
Go on
After  graduated college  was all set to go into my father business
Umbrella frames -- that's what he made
It was a sensible business, suppose, but  didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible
suppose all this is leading somewhere
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing
But that left me without any honest means of support
What do you mean
When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss
(astonished) You mean, you're a thief
Well, it isn't exactly the term 'd have chosen, but  suppose it captures the spirit of the thing
don't believe it
Well,  can't really blame you -- not now
But  do believe it -- that's what don't believe
So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua
Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield
Adam Canfield
Wonderful
Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days
don't even know who 'm talking to any more
(now called ) The man's the same, even if the name isn't
No -- he's not the same
Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death
Adam Canfield is a crook
And with all the advantages you've got -- brains, charm, education, a handsome face -- Oh, come on
-- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do
want to know what it is
It's simple
like what  do -- enjoy doing it
There aren't many men who love their work as much as do
Look around some time
Is there a Mrs
Canfield
Yes, but -- (together) -- we're divorced
Right
Now go eat your dinner
They walk back to the table, where a  is busy putting food on it, mostly on 's side
(miserably) could eat a horse
(looking at all the food) think that's what you ordered
Don't you dare to be civil with me
All this time you were leading me on -- How was  leading you on
All that marvelous rejection -- you knew  couldn't resist it
Now it turns out you were only interested in the money
That's right
() Oh
What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars
No --  guess not
It's a toss-up,  can tell you that
What
Don't you know 'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you
reacts in surprise
Oh, you should see your face
What about it
(taking her hand, nicely) It's lovely
She looks at him with happy amazement, then pushes her plate away
What's the matter
'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious
The lights go out
(alarmed) Adam
It's all right -- look
-- searchlight near the boat's bridge has gone on and now begins sweeping the river banks
On benches by the water's edge, lovers are surprised by the bright light which suddenly and without warning discovers them in various attitudes of mutual affection
Some are embarrassed, some are amused and some (the most intimate) damn annoyed
One even shakes his fist at the light
-- Who, like everyone else, leave the table and stand together at the rail watching
You don't look so bad in this light
Why do you think  brought you here
(indicating the lovers) thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out
Pretty good, huh
taught them everything they do
Oh
Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day
How do you think  got here
She rises on tip-toes and kisses him gently; his only reaction is to look at her
Aren't you allowed to kiss back
No
The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat
She kisses him again
He responds a little better
When you come on, you really come on
Well -- come on
She starts to kiss him again, but he stops her
know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you
Relax -- you're gaining
'  -- --
As he sits bolt upright in bed, startled
The room is dark and the phone is ringing
He switches on the lamp, looks at the clock (it reads 3:30) and shakes his head before picking up the receiver
Huh
You must be crazy -- it's three- thirty in the morning -- you mean now
-- all right -- 'll be down in a minute
He hangs up, swings his feet out of bed and spears his slippers, reaching for his robe at the same time
Then he shuffles sleepily to the door
--    -- As  comes out of his room and goes to the elevator
The cage is there
He opens the door and enters
-- closes the sliding grill and presses a button
The cage starts down
begins sneezing
Suddenly the elevator stops between floors and the lights go out
Hey
Turn on the lights
Just as suddenly the lights go back on and the elevator starts moving down again
shakes his head and leans back, whistling again
The cage comes to his floor and starts past it
Seeing this,  looks confused
-- The   is asleep behind the desk
The elevator, inside, keeps coming down
It passes the lobby level and keeps right on going, toward the basement
Hey
How do you stop this thing
The elevator passes out of sight, still going down
There is a silence as the motor stops, and then a series of sneezes that ends with a terrifying shriek
The  , rudely awakened, runs to the elevator shaft, his shoes squeaking horribly
He looks up, sees nothing, then looks down
He presses the call button and the motor starts
An instant later the cage appears and stops
The opens the gate, pulls back the grill and the him to pick up
His body is sitting on the floor of the cage, its grotesque sprawling attitude resembling a puppet's with its strings cut
Except that  has no strings to cut -- only a throat
From ear to ear
-- --
He is now doubly apoplectic
Three of them -- all in their pajamas
'est ridicule
What is it, some new American fad
to reveal  and , in their bathrobes
And now your friend -- the one from Texas -- he has disappeared -- checked out -- pouf
into thin air
Where is he
don't know
Madame
shrugs
Tell me, Mr
Dyle -- where were you at three-thirty
In my room, asleep
And you, Mrs
Lampert
was, too
In Mr
Dyle's room
(bitterly) No -- in my room
(pause, lighting cigar) It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story
and  exchange looks
And if  were you,  would not stay in my pajamas
Good night
turns and leaves
and  start down the hall toward their own rooms
That wraps it up -- Tex has the money
Go back to bed -- 'll let you know when 've found him
You're going to look for him -- now
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they
Adam -- There's no time -- 'll call you in the morning
disappears into his own room
'  -- As  enters, going to the closet to remove his suit
The phone rings
He answers it
Yes
-- --
As he speaks on the phone
Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children
know who's got the money 'n  ain't disappearing till  got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day
'  -- (on the phone) Where are you, ol' buddy
-- (on the phone) (laughs) 'll tell you what, fella -- you want t' find me, you jus' turn 'round -- from now on 'll be right behind you
(hangs up) '  -- , before hanging up, reflects on 's words, then looks behind him
Smiling softly, he hangs up the phone and starts for 's door
'  -- slips back into her robe and goes to the connecting door
What is it
Open up
She undoes the bolt and opens the door
enters
think we were wrong about Tex having the money
Why
just heard from him -- he's still hungry
That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us
You've got it
've looked, Adam -- you know  have -- Where's that airlines bag
Lord, you're stubborn
sure am
Get it
She goes to the closet and gets the bag
Charles must have had the money with him on the train, and Tex missed it
He takes the bag to the bed where he dumps out the contents
But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag
Somebody would have seen it
Let's look anyway
Lord, you're stubborn
mean, it's there, Reggie
If only we could see it
We're looking at it right now
--   ' '  (
) Something on that bed is worth a quarter of a million dollars
'  (
) Yes, but what
'  (
) don't know --  just don't know
-- As  begins to examine the items one by one
Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet -- (He goes through the wallet, finds nothing) key -- what about that
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly
The letter -- He takes it out of the envelope and takes out his glasses before reading it
'll bet you don't really need those
He hands her the glasses and she looks through them
You need them
(She hands them back) (reading the letter) It still doesn't make sense, but it isn't worth any quarter of a million either
Have we forgotten anything
The tooth powder
Wait a minute -- could you recognize heroin just by tasting it
He shakes some powder into his hand and tastes it watches expectantly
Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin
Well,  guess that's it -- dead end
Go to bed
You've got to be at work in the morning
There's nothing more we can do tonight
(pause) love you, Adam
Yes, you told me
No -- last time  said " love you, Alex

Per esempio, pregare i Vietnamiti di aggiungere alle loro risaie ed ai loro campi di soja tradizionali una raccolta di semola, non solo sconvolgerebbe le loro secolari tradizioni ma, oltre tutto, e questo e molto importante per il Governo che io ho l'onore di rappresentare disturberebbe l'esportazione delle derrate farinose italiane in questa parte del mondo
Signori Delegati vi ringrazio della vostra attenzione
'  -- , wearing her headset, is talking with
hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything
He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls
He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age
Hold it -- Italy just finished
They're recognizing Great Britain
Oh la vache
jumps up and rushes next door into her booth, shutting the door after her
-- The   rises to speak, continuing through the next scene
Mr
Chairman, fellow delegates -- my distinguished colleague from Italy
Her Majesty's delegation has listened with great patience to the Southern European position on this problem, and while we find it charmingly stated, we cannot possibly agree with its content
In 1937, in the British colonies of Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika -- and, if 'm not mistaken, more or less in Somaliland -- a programme of crop rotation was instituted vis-a-vis arable land which had never before known the plough, beginning before the soil was able to know the sort of fatigue now plaguing most of Western Europe
In 1937, therefore, Her Majesty's Government -- at that time His Majesty's Government -- was able to properly assay the situation
We therefore oppose the resolution
'  -- The door from the hall opens and  enters
Reggie --  think 've found -- (stopping) are you on
No, it's all right
What's wrong, Adam
Nothing's wrong
think  found something
was snooping around Tex's room and  found this in the waste basket
've stuck it back together
He hands her a paper
-- The one  gave
It has been torn in half and scotch-taped back together
'  (
) It's the receipt Inspector Grandpierre gave me -- for Charles's things don't see how that's going to -- -- You didn't look
Last night, when we went through the airlines bag, something was missing
See --
(showing her the list) "One agenda
" It wasn't there
You're right
remember Grandpierre looking through it
But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important
Can you remember anything at all
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed
With whom
Where
think it only said where -- but can't -- Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law
Nonsense
We didn't steal it
There's no law against stealing stolen money
Of course there is
There is
Well,  can't say  think very much of a silly law like that
Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook
Well -- it was a place -- a street corner,  think
But  don't -- (hearing something through her earpiece) Hold it
'm on
She turns back to the conference, flips a switch and starts speaking into her headset
(translating) Mr
Chairman, fellow delegates -- my distinguished colleague from Great Britain -- -- The   is speaking
Monsieur le President, Messieurs les delegues -- mon distingue collegue de la Grande Bretagne -- le probleme vu par mon Gouvernement n'est pas aussi simple que nos amis les Anglais voudraient nous le faire croire
Mais leur pays n'est pas, apres tout, un pays agricole, n'est-ce pas

But Charles' appointment was last week, not -- know, but this is all we've got left
Well, you're right there
Ten minutes ago  had a job

He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning
He said he had never seen any like them
'm glad
But what's all this
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon
This is where Jean-Louis trades his -- (as it dawns) Good Lord
The stamps

How much is it worth

The masterpiece
It is the most valuable stamp in the world
It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne

Lampert -- please

'  -- (on the phone) No,  do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train
They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope
'  -- (on the phone) The envelope -- imagine that
Mrs
Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps
Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, 'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker
Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal
-- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there
Hurry, Mrs
Lampert
'  -- (on the phone) Yes, 'm leaving now -- goodbye
She hangs up, looks briefly at 's body, shudders, then hurries to the door
--   -- As  leaves her room and goes to the elevator
She presses the button, then notices it is in use
She goes to the stairs and starts down
-- Between the landings
The stairs curve around the open elevator shaft
As  comes down the stairs, the cage rises into view
Inside is
For a moment, she stops and their eyes meet
Reggie -- the stamps -- what've you done with --
starts running downstairs
Where are you going
Wait
pushes the emergency stop button and then starts the cage down
Reggie

Reggie
--   -- As  continues to run
-- Between the first landing and the lobby
running, the elevator following
Reggie -- stop
Why
So you can kill me too
Tex is dead, 've seen him
He said Dyle did it
'm not Dyle -- you know that
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- Don't be an idiot
-- reaches the lobby first and, without hesitation, races toward the front door and out
The confused hotel behind the desk can only stare in surprise
The elevator, inside, has not yet reached the bottom
Reggie --
want those stamps
-- taxi stands by the curb
leaves the hotel and runs to it
(indicating the direction) Palais Royal -- vite
Calmly, the  points to the little printed sign on his windshield reading "
" (pointing the other way) Porte d'Italie, moi
Mais c'est tres vite
On veut me teur
(shaking his head) Italie
She looks around and sees  come out of the hotel and straight toward her
She turns and runs off toward the Place St
Michel

She stops, sees the Metro station ("St
Michel") and rushes to it, scampering down the stairs

Barely stopping, she holds out her ticket to the  to be punched, then heads down the platform, still running

Billet, Monsieur
(breathless) don't want to go anywhere -- 'm only trying -- (pointing off) Billet, Monsieur
tries to look past him, to see , but gives it up and goes back toward the ticket booth, on the run
-- as she runs -- the passageway is nearly empty
Her footsteps echo against the tile and concrete walls
--   () The jumble of advertising posters as it passes rapidly, forming a moving band of letters, women, cartoons and colors
-- stops and pauses for a moment at a sign indicating two different directions, an arrow for each
": Pte ' Pte  -------" Choosing "Clignancourt," she runs off
, 180 degrees, to pick up  rounding the corner in hot pursuit
-- starts down the platform, looking behind her every few steps
Suddenly she looks up in surprise -- there, across the tracks on the opposite platform is
He has evidently made the wrong turn back in the passageway
They stare at each other for a moment
Then the bell rings, announcing the arrival of a train
turns, running back through the exit behind him
Not knowing what to do, looks into the darkness of the tunnel
The approaching train can be heard
(to herself) Come on -- please -- She turns to look at the gate -- slowly, the pneumatic door starts to close
As it does, the train roars into the station
-- The gate can be seen slowly closing
runs to it, tries to force it back but cannot
Finally, he jumps up and, commando style, vaults over it
-- is just entering the red center car (the two on either side are dark green)
runs for the red car and just manages to make it as the doors shut in unison, the latches falling with a concerted click and the little whistle blowing to inform the motor-man to depart
The train starts to move
-- The entire length of the car separates  and
For a moment, their eyes meet, then  starts to weave his way past the other , on his way to her
Suddenly, he is stopped
turns to see a
Billet, Monsieur
shows him his yellow ticket and starts past him, but again the   stops him
Vous etes dans le premier classe, Monsieur
What
(heavy accent) This car is for first class only -- you have a second-class ticket
But that's what they gave me
He tries to pull away from the   and finds himself staring into the serious face of a
Monsieur --
looks at the , then at

She remains in the car
-- The  gestures for  to enter the green, second- class car behind the red, first-class one
Reluctantly, does
-- As  enters and goes to the door through which he can see in the car ahead
She is gone
Moving quickly, he returns to the exit door and looks at the platform
-- From '
She is hurrying toward an exit marked "
" Featuring  as he hurries from the car
He finds his way blocked by   in large, white butterfly hats
It takes him a few precious seconds to work his way around them
-- has entered an area leading to the exit
But as she reaches the stairway leading up to the street level, she is confronted with an iron grill barring her way
She tries to open it, but it is firmly padlocked
sign hung on it reads "
" She turns, desperately looking for some way out
-- is off the train
He stands on the platform as the train doors slam shut, the latches click, the whistle blows and the train pulls out
He looks around in all directions, looking for some sign of
He spots the exit marked "" (the same one used by ) and starts toward it
-- As  enters the deserted area
There is, miraculously, no sign of
He goes to the locked grill and tries it, testing the padlock
to a phone booth (solid door with a window in the upper half) and we see 's hand reaching up to dial a number
-- sits on the floor of the booth, dialing
(to herself, as she dials) Balzac 3 - 0 - 0 - 4
She holds the receiver to her ear
The number can be heard ringing but no one answers
She hangs up and reaches for the phone book, leafing through its pages
Embassies -- embassies -- -- stands for a minute, looking around, not knowing what to do
-- has finished dialing her number and now pushes the button
It clicks loudly
Shh
(into the phone, whispering) American Embassy

Bartholomew's office, please -- Mr
Bartholomew's office -- -- An  speaking into a headset
Could you speak out, please

-- (on the phone) 'm sorry, but Mr
Bartholomew has left for the day
-- (on the phone) But someone's trying to kill me -- you've got to send word to him -- in the center garden of the Palais Royal, by the colonnade -- tell him 'm trapped in a phone booth, below him in the Metro station
And my name's Lampert
-- (on the phone) All right, Mrs
Lampert -- 'll see what  can do
Goodbye
She unplugs the call, plugs in another one and dials quickly
Hello, Mr
Bartholomew
-- there was a call for you just now, Mr
Bartholomew -- it sounded quite urgent -- a Mrs
Lampert
'  -- It is a man we've never seen before, the physical opposite of the old
Lampert
don't know any Mrs
Lampert -- trapped in a Metro station
Who does she think  am, the
All right, you'd better call the French police

As 's head appears, peeking cautiously over the bottom of the window
From inside the phone booth
Through the glass  can be seen, leaving the Sortie area
-- Carefully,  opens the door and comes out
She goes to the corner and looks around it
-- From '
as  walks away from , down the platform
, peeking around the corner
She looks the opposite way, sees another exit at the other end of the platform (also marked "")
She looks back once more at , then makes up her mind and starts running towards the exit

He turns to look and sees

He takes off, running after her

(in b
g
, calling) Reggie -- wait
She turns into the exit
-- As  starts up the long, steep flight of stone steps leading to the street level
appears behind her, climbing two at a time and gaining
Reggie -- why won't you listen
'm through listening to you
He is rapidly closing the gap between them
It is clear that is tiring
But  didn't kill anybody
Then who did
You're the only one left

is only a few steps behind now
Reggie -- please believe me
No
As  wearily gains the top,  lunges for her
He manages to grab her foot as he falls forward, but all he winds up with is a shoe which has come loose in his hand
shrieks, then regaining her balance, continues running, limping in her one shoe
scrambles to his feet and starts after her again
-- As , still hobbling, runs through and toward the stairs, leading to the street
, as he, too, runs through
He is again several yards behind her
-- As  comes up the stairs from the Metro
She stops long enough to kick off her other shoe, then runs across the street, ignoring the traffic, toward the Rue de Valois (which forms one side of the Palais Royal)
is gaining on her again
--  -- The smaller court at the Comedie-Francaise end of the Palais gardens, separated from the larger garden by a double peristyle consisting of two twin rows (these separated from each other by a small marble court) of twenty columns each -- in all, eighty columns
The only person in sight is the man we have known as , waiting at the far end of the columns, looking at his watch impatiently
Then, from the Rue de Valois side of the Palais,  runs into the court
She spots "" and fishes in her bag for the stamps as she runs, taking them out and waving them
Mr
Bartholomew -- he's chasing me
has run into the court and now skids to a stop at the near end of the colonnade as he spots "
" , still running, is halfway between the two men
"" draws his gun but can't get a shot at , who has ducked in among the columns
Reggie -- stop
That's Carson Dyle
This news hits  hard and she stops, in alarm
(breathless) Carson --
She looks at "," then back at , who has drawn his own gun
(: Both "" and  are in among the stone columns at opposite ends of the colonnade, keeping out of each other's sight
stands out in the open, the stamps in her hand, confused as to which man she should go to)
"" (calmly) We all know Carson Dyle is dead, Mrs
Lampert
It's Carson Dyle,  tell you
"" You're not going to believe him, Mrs
Lampert -- it's too fantastic
He's trying to trick you again
looks at one, then the other, not knowing what to do
Tex recognized him -- that's why he said Dyle
If you give him those stamps, he'll kill you too
takes a step toward
"" Mrs
Lampert -- if 'm who he said, what's preventing me from killing you right now
stops, turns back to "
" Because he'd have to come out to get the stamps -- he knows he'd never make it
"" What's the matter with you, Mrs
Lampert
Are you going to believe every lie he tells you
He wants the money for himself -- that's all he's ever wanted
(to , explaining) He's -- with the
-- 've seen him at the Embassy
Don't be a fool
He's Carson Dyle
"" That's right, Mrs
Lampert -- 'm a dead man -- look at me
don't know who anybody is any more
Reggie -- listen to me
You lied to me so many times -- (gently) Reggie -- trust me once more -- please
Can  really believe you this time, Adam
(a pause) There's not a reason on earth why you should
She looks toward  for a moment, then back to "", then slowly starts toward
All right, Adam
"" Stop right now, Mrs
Lampert, or 'll kill you
stops in alarm
It won't get you the stamps, Dyle -- You'll have to come out to get them, and 'm not likely to miss at this range
"" (now called ) Maybe not -- but it takes a lot of bullets to kill me
They left me there with five of them in my legs and my stomach -- they knew  was still alive but they left me
spent ten months in a German camp -- with nothing to stop the pain and no food -- they were willing to take all these chances for the money, but not for me
They deserved to die
-- During the following, he looks around, looking for some way out
'  (
) But  didn't have anything to do with -- '  (
) You've got the money
It belongs to me now
Please believe me, Mrs
Lampert -- 'll kill you -- a little more blood won't matter
During this  has moved out from behind the columns, creeping cautiously across the open space between the two colonnades and finally, behind the second
-- 'll give you five to make up your mind, Mrs
Lampert
She has seen 's move from her angle, but doesn't know quite what to do
Wait, please
need some time to think
One -- -- As he slowly moves along behind the second colonnade, his gun ready, trying to get an angle on
'  (
) -- two -- Suddenly  stops -- he has caught sight of  through the columns
But he will have a difficult shot
'  (
) -- three -- -- -- four -- to his gun
As his finger tightens on the trigger and the hammer moves slowly back
-- Adam -- please
-- As he aims carefully and fires
-- As the bullet creases it
-- As the deflected bullet rips the shoulder of his coat, leaving him unharmed
He wheels
-- With  in the b
g
, who fires at him
ducks behind the column as the bullet hits it and screams off
Quickly, he peers back out and throws another shot
-- Seeing  otherwise occupied, she turns and runs toward the open stage door of the Comedie Francaise behind her
(Beside the door is a poster announcing the forthcoming schedule of presentations
) Including  who, seeing  running to the door, turns and fires at her
But he is too late -- she is safely inside
looks quickly back toward , then takes off after
-- Over his shoulder we see a broken picture of  running toward the theatre door, flashing by the near and far columns
tries to get a shot at him, but can't
Finally he runs after him
--  -- As  enters and slams the door behind him, locking it
--   -- arriving at the door, bangs on it, then looks around, frustrated
Several yards away he sees a short stairway leading down to a door below the street level
He runs to it, tries the door and enters
--  -- As  enters the auditorium and looks around
'
As the   the magnificent old theatre -- boxes, seats, stage, but there is no sign of
As  walks up the aisle checking between the rows of seats
--  -- large room, lit by a single bare bulb, under the stage
appears, moving cautiously, gun ready
He creeps along next to the wall, looking around at all the various scenic pieces which fill the room
--  -- As  moves carefully across the darkened stage near the footlights, looking for
At mid-stage, to his feet, only a few inches from the prompter's box
Inside, huddling down, is a terrified , holding her breath as she watches him
As  moves into the opposite wings, sees the light board and throws on all the switches
The stage is bathed in light
He returns to the stage
-- is looking up, having heard the footsteps on the stage over his head -- and hearing them now
He looks around and sees a narrow, curving staircase leading up
He goes to it, and, starting up, finds a door
He tries the knob -- the door is locked
'  -- , cringing back from the bright light, notices the doorknob turning
It makes a slight clicking sound
--  -- , upstage, looking behind a piece of classic scenery, hears the doorknob and turns suddenly
'
We catch a quick glimpse of  as she ducks down out of sight
Too late
-- All right, Mrs
Lampert
The game's over
Come out of there

don't want to kill you, Mrs
Lampert -- but  will -- -- comes down the stairs from the prompter's box and looks up at the ceiling
-- It is divided into thirty-six square sections, each numbered and lettered -- from 1A to 6F
They are trapdoors
-- He looks from the ceiling to a row of levers on one wall
-- Thirty-six of them, numbered and lettered to correspond to the traps
--  -- As  takes a few steps towards the prompter's box, his gun ready
Did you hear me, Mrs
Lampert --
'  -- huddled inside
-- is listening carefully, trying to figure out where is standing, watching the ceiling
-- It is marked -4
'  (
) won't wait much longer, Mrs
Lampert -- As he turns to the levers and reaches for the one marked - 4
He is about to pull it
--  -- takes a few more steps forward
-- stops himself from pulling the lever just in time
He lets his held breath escape
He looks back at the ceiling
-- The one marked -4
As 's voice is heard, to the next trap, marked -4
'  (
) know you're in there, Mrs
Lampert -- -- He looks at the lever marked -4
He is perspiring heavily
Now he slowly reaches for the lever
--  -- is about to move closer to the prompter's box when suddenly the stage under him opens and he plummets through out of sight
At the same time we hear a shot
-- ' As  slowly peers out
'
The empty stage, without being able to see the open trap from this low angle
-- As she climbs out of the booth and, seeing the open trap now, runs to it, looking down through it
-- , over 's head
She can see  sprawled on the floor below, face down and dead
stands beside the body, looking up at  and smiling
As  and his  , guns drawn, walk onto the stage from the wings
They go to the open trap and look down at
Mr
Dyle -- you are under arrest for the murders of Charles Lampert, Herman Scobie, Joseph Penthollow, Leopold Gideon, and whoever that is down there
is surprised, then shakes his head
Reggie -- you'd better tell him
He wouldn't dare hit a girl
-- As a  rolls by the arcades,   with it
--  () and  in the rear of the cab
has one of her feet in her hand, shoe off, rubbing it
You didn't have to chase me so hard -- Here, give it to me
He starts to take the foot but she pulls it back and offers him the other one
That one's done -- start on this one
He takes the foot and begins rubbing it
'm sorry  thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did  know that he was as big a liar as you are
And that's all the gratitude  get for saving your hide
The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps
What a terrible thing to say
How could you even think that
All right, prove it to me -- tell me to go to the Embassy first thing in the morning and turn in those stamps
says nothing
said, tell me to go to the -- heard you,  heard you
Then say it
Reggie -- listen to me -- Never mind -- 'll go by myself
What makes you think they're even interested
It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping
As a taxpayer -- --   -- As  and  approach the  in full-dress uniform always on guard at the Embassy
(to ) Who's a taxpayer
Crooks don't pay taxes
Excuse me, soldier -- Marine, ma'am
Forgive me

You might try the Treasury Department, ma'am -- Room 216, second floor, Mr
Cruikshank
Cruikshank, 216
Thank you, Marine
-- Featuring a door marked "216
"  and  appear
Do you mind if  wait out here
The sight of all that money being given away might make me break out
-- sits behind a desk
She looks up as  enters
Mr
Cruikshank, please -- my name is Lampert
The  picks up her phone and presses a button
Mr
Cruikshank, a Miss -- Mrs
-- a Mrs
Lampert to see you -- yes sir
(to ) Go right in
goes to the door leading to the private office
'  -- Featuring the door as  enters
She stops suddenly
Featuring the desk
Behind it sits  (now )
stares at him, unbelievingly, then looks around, confused
By way of explanation he indicates the door to the hall
(blowing up) Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked -- Crooked
should think you'd be glad to find out  wasn't crooked
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest
Why didn't you say something
We're not allowed to tell
May have the stamps, please
(reaching into her bag) Here -- (hesitating) Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway
When did you see him -- what time, mean
Around one
The lunch hour
He probably worked it out in advance
He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here
Then how do  know this is your office
(picking up the phone) Mrs
Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that -- Bartholomew
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour
Starting with his own
(hanging up) Okay, now -- hand over those stamps
What's your first name today
Brian
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if  got stuck with that one
Who asked you to get stuck with any of them
Is there a Mrs
Cruikshank
Yes
But you're -- divorced
No
(crestfallen) Oh
My mother -- she lives in Detroit
Come on now -- give me those stamps
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank
How about if next week some time put it on a marriage license -- that ought to -- Quit stalling --  want to see some identification -- now
wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- could go to jail
You'd lie about anything
Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then
You can't prove it, can you
You're still trying to -- (the coin drops into the slot) marriage license
Did you say --
didn't say anything
Will you give me those stamps
You did too say it --  heard you
Oh,  love you Adam --  mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian
hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you
Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps
: -- Lyrics to the theme song of the film: Music by Henry Mancini, Words by Johnny Mercer When we played our Charade we were like children posing, Playing at games, acting out names, guessing the parts we played
Oh, what a hit we made
We came on next to closing Best on the bill, lovers until love left the masquerade
Fate seemed to pull the strings,  turned and you were gone
While from the darkened wings the music box played on
Sad little serenade, song of my heart's composing,  hear it still,  always will, best on the bill Charade
