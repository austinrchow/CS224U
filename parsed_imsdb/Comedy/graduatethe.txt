The clouds separate and, far below, we can see a giant outdoor amphitheatre

-    - - and today it is right that we should ask ourselves the one most important question: What is the purpose of these years, the purpose for all this demanding work, the purpose for the sacrifices made those who love us
Were there  a purpose, then all of these past years of struggle, of fierce competition and of uncom- promising ambition would be mean- ingless
But, of course, there is a purpose and  must tell it to you
ask you to remember this purpose always and  pledge that  shall endeavor to carry it with me forever

The pages begin to blow away in the wind

-  -  - His eyes open suddenly
' The sound you have just heard is the landing gear locking into place
The Los Angeles weather is clear and the temperature is a pleasant 72
We do not expect any traffic delay and will make our four hour and eighteen minute flight plan smack on the nose
We enjoyed having you on board and look forward to seeing you again in the near future
18 from a  of a television screen with snow on it to reveal a long row of television sets along the ceiling of the aircraft
There is snow on all of them
19 from the  of Ben to reveal a row of passengers staring straight ahead, their headsets on
Ben turns and looks out the window
20
-    - Los Angeles, at night, its lights stretching endlessly in every direction
-  and the '
titles: ' Ladies and gentlemen please fasten your seat belts in preparation for the landing and observe the no smoking sign
After we land, you will notice an increase in the sound level as the thrust of the engines is reversed to help reduce forward speed
21
-   - Ben and the other passengers on the automatic sidewalk
' Your attention, please
American Airlines Flight Number 4, 21 Club service, non-stop to New York is now leaving from Gate Number 40
All aboard, please
28
'  -  -  - His eyes are open and he is trying to remember something
There are the  of many people  and in other rooms
nearby
After a while, there is the  of a
The of the people  are lower
' voice can be heard among them
' -- associate editor of the college newspaper in his junior year - managing editor in his senior year - The  of the
Mrs
Terhune's  and the  of the other guests
Mrs
Terhune's can be  with varying clarity through the remainder of the sequence
After a few moments, there is the  of a being  and light, as though from an overhead fixture, falls across 's face
He does not move
After a few moments, there is the  of the  being ' What's the matter
Ben's mouth opens a little bit and closes again
' The guests are all downstairs, Ben
They're all waiting to see you
Look, Dad - could you explain to them that  have to be alone for a while
' These are all our good friends, Ben
Most of them have known you since - well - practically since you were born
Ben has not moved
Now the bed on which he is lying moves as though someone has sat down upon it next to him
' What is it, Ben
The
'm just - - worried
Well - About what
Ben guess - about my future
What about it
don't know
want it to be - To be what
(quietly) Different
As Ben says this, the door to the bedroom opens and looks in
Is anything wrong
No
No - we're just on our way downstairs
Mr
Braddock gets off the bed and goes to a chair and picks up Ben's jacket which is lying across it
The Carlsons' are here
(to Mrs
Braddock) They are
(to Ben) Come on
Mr
Braddock puts the jacket on Ben
They came all the way from Tarzana
It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends
They move out of the door, Mr
Braddock steering Ben
29
- and   are coming up the stairs as the Braddocks are moving down
Hey - there's our award winning scholar
We're all very proud of you, Ben
Thank you, Mrs
Carlson
Is that the new car out there
The little red Wop job
That's Ben's graduation present
(putting his arm across Ben's shoulder) Won't have much trouble picking them up in that, will you
Sir
The girls
The chicks
The - the teeny boppers
think Ben has gotten beyond the teeny bopper stage - haven't you, Ben
Mrs
Carlson gives Ben a broad wink
Ben tries to smile and return the wink politely
Yes, ma'am
They reach the hall at the bottom of the stairs
Excuse me -  think 'd just like to check something on the car for a minute - Ben moves to the front door and opens it steps into the house and grabs Ben's hand
Here's the track star himself
How are you, track star
Just fine, Mr
Loomis
Mr
Loomis closes the door and pushes Ben back down the hall
want to get a drink and then want to hear all about that thing you won
That Hopperman award
Helpingham
Helpingham
Right
Now you wait right here
Mr
Loomis turns and goes into the dining room
Ben moves back to the stairway as   come out of the living room
One lady takes Ben's right hand, another lady his left, the third fingers the front of his jacket
1 Ben - we're all so proud of you
2 Proud, proud, proud, proud, proud
3 What are you going to do now
was going to go upstairs for a minute - 3 No -  meant with your future
2 With your life
Well - that's a little hard to say - appears behind Ben
Ben
Ben (to the ladies) Excuse me
(he turns around) Mr
McQuire (overwhelmed with pride) Ben
Mr
McQuire
Mr
McQuire takes Ben's arm and steers him down the hall toward the back of the house and out through the back door
30
- The pool is eerily lit
There are   standing and , drinks in their hands, at the back of the yard
Ben -  just want to say one word to you - just one word - Yes, sir
Are you listening
Yes  am
(gravely) Plastics
They look at each other for a moment
Exactly how do you mean
There is a great future in plastics
Think about it
Will you think about it
Yes,  will
Okay
Enough said
That's a deal
Mr
McQuire turns and walks back into the house
The people at the other end of the yard look toward Ben
#1 Here he is now
Here's Ben
Excuse me just a minute - Ben goes into the house through the back door
31
- We can see through the windows of the house, Ben making his way through people trying to stop him and speak to him as he goes through rooms, up the stairs and to his room
of a door
32
-
'  - Ben stands with his back against the door
The  of the downstairs and, as Ben walks across the room to a window, the  of the
32A	 -   (Location) Over Ben to pool area and people below
of the door Ben turns
enters the room
Oh
guess this isn't the bathroom, is it
It's down the hall
They stand for a moment, loocking at each other
How are you, Benjamin
Fine, thank you
The bathroom is down at the end of the hall
Mrs
Robinson moves into the room and sits on the edge of the bed
Look, Mrs
Robinson,  don't mean to be rude but - Mrs
Robinson takes a cigarette from her purse and lights it
Is there an ashtray in here
No
Oh -  forgot
The track star doesn't smoke
She blows out the match and puts it down carefully on the bedspread
Ben picks up a wastebasket, walks over to the bed, picks up the match and puts it in the wastebasket
Is it a girl
Is what a girl
Whatever it is you're upset about
Oh - no
'm just sort of disturbed about things
In general
That's right
There is a long pause
Benjamin,  want to ask you something
What
Will you take me home
What
My husband took the car
Will you drive me home
Ben reaches into his pocket and hands Mrs
Robinson a set of car keys
Here - you take it
Mrs
Robinson looks at him
Do you know how to work a foreign shift
Mrs
Robinson shakes her head
You don't
No
(there is a pause) Let's go
She throws the keys to him
He catches them
: 33
- Mr
Braddock is talking to the Terhunes at the door
Ben and Mrs
Robinson come down the hall
Dad - Mrs
Robinson needs a ride home
'll be right back
Mr
Braddock pats Ben on the shoulder
Mrs
Robinson is walking ahead through the front door
(as she passes the ) Wonderful party
: 34 35
- The car comes to a stop in the Robinson driveway
They sit for a moment
Thank you
Right
She doesn't move
Ben gets out and goes around to her side and opens the door
Will you come in, please
What
want you to come in till  get the lights on
What for
Because  don't feel safe until get the lights on
They move to the door
She takes out her key and opens the door
36
- Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch
feel funny about coming into a dark house
But it's light in there now
Please
Ben turns and walks down the hall
They enter sunroom
What do you drink
Bourbon
Look -  drove you home
was glad to do it
But  have some things on my mind
Can you understand that
She nods
All right then
What do you drink
He looks at her
Benjamin - 'm sorry to be this way, but  don't want to be alone in this house
Why not
Please wait till my husband gets home
When is he coming back
don't know
She pours herself a drink
Drink
No
She hands him a drink
There is a pause
Are you always this much afraid of being alone
Yes
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed
'm very nuerotic
She turns on the phonograph
of
May  ask you a question
Ben looks at her
What do you think of me
What do you mean
You've known me nearly all of your life
You must have formed some opinion
Well - 've always thought that you were a very - nice - person
Did you know  was an alcoholic
What
Did you know that
Look -  think  should be going - Sit down, Benjamin
Mrs
Robinson - if you don't mind my saying so - this conversation is getting a little strange
Now 'm sure that Mr
Robinson will be here any minute and - No
What
My husband will be back quite late
They look at each other
Ben is half standing
He should be gone for several hours
She takes a step toward him
He puts his hand up and retreats around the other side of the chair
Oh my God
Pardon
Oh no, Mrs
Robinson, oh no
What's wrong
Mrs
Robinson, you didn't - mean you didn't expect - What
mean - you didn't really think that  would do something like that
Like what
What do you think
Well  don't know
For God's sake, Mrs
Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house
You give me a drink
You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours
So
Mrs
Robinson - you are trying to seduce me
There is a pause
She looks at him
(weaker) Aren't you
Why no
hadn't thought of it
feel rather flattered that you - Mrs
Robinson, will you forgive me for what  just said
It's all right
It's not all right, it's the worst thing 've ever said to anyone
Sit down
Please forgive me
Because like you
don't think of you that way
But 'm mixed up
All right
Now finish your drink
Mrs
Robinson, it makes me sick that  said that to you
We'll forget it right now
Finish your drink
What is wrong with me
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait
Her portrait
Yes
No
We had it done last Christmas
Would you like to see it
Very much
We move with Mrs
Robinson and Ben out of the sunroom, into the hall, up the stairs and along the hall to the doorway to Elaine's room
37
'  - Ben moves into the room and looks up at the portrait
Elaine certainly is an attractive girl, isn't she
In the b
g
Mrs
Robinson watches him
(looking at the portrait) don't remember her as having brown eyes
Benjamin
Yes
Will you unzip my dress
He steps back
think 'll go to bed
Oh
Well, goodnight
Won't you unzip my dress
'd rather not, Mrs
Robinson
If you still think 'm trying to seduce you - No,  don't
But  just feel a little funny
Benjamin - you've known me all your life
know that
But 'm - Come on
She turns her back
It's hard for me to reach
Ben reaches forward and pulls the zipper down
Thank you
Right
Ben walks toward the door
What are you so scared of
'm not scared, Mrs
Robinson
Then why do you keep running away
Because you're going to bed don't think  should be up here
Mrs
Robinson lets her dress fall to the floor
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before
Yes,  have - He looks up at the portrait of Elaine
But  just - Look - what if Mr
Robinson walked in right now
What if he did
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it
Don't you think he trusts us together
Of course he does
But he might get the wrong idea
Anyone might
don't see why
'm twice as old as you are
How could anyone think - But they would
Don't you see
Benjamin - 'm not trying to seduce you
wish you'd - know that
But please, Mrs
Robinson
This is difficult for me
Why is it
Because  am confused about things
can't tell what 'm imagining
can't tell what's real
can't - Would you like me to seduce you
What
Is that what you're trying to tell me
'm going home now
apologize for what  said
hope you can forget it
But 'm going home right now
Benjamin walks out of the door and down the hall
The with him to the door
We see the entire stairway and part of the downstairs hall
Ben gets to the stairs and starts down
' Yes
' Will you bring up my purse before you go
have to go now
'm sorry
Mrs
Robinson walks into the hall
Her back is to us
She is holding her dress in front of her
really don't want to put this on again
Won't you bring it up
Where is it
On that chair in the hall
She walks out of the shot
Mrs
Robinson
' 'm in the bathroom
Well here's the purse
' Could you bring it up
Well 'll hand it to you
Ben starts back up the stairs
Come to the railing and 'll hand it up
' Benjamin -  am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion
Now if you won't do me a simple favor  don't know what
Ben appears as he slowly climbs the stairs
'm putting it on the top step
' For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse
Ben gets to the top of the stairs, and starts slowly down the hall
'm putting it here by the door
' Will you bring it in to me
'd rather not
' All right
Put it in the room where we were
Right
38
'  - Ben walks quickly into Elaine's room, crosses to the bed and puts the purse down
As he starts to turn back, he looks up at Elaine's portrait
There is a movement reflected in the glass of the portrait
He turns quickly
Mrs
Robinson, naked, is shutting the door to the bedroom behind her
Oh God
She smiles
Let me out
She turns the lock on the door
Don't be nervous
Get away from that door
want to say something first
Jesus Christ
Benjamin -  want you to know 'm available to you
If you won't sleep with me this time - Oh my God
If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin,  want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement
Let me out
Do you understand what  said
Yes
Yes
Let me out
Because  find you very attractive and any time - There is the  of a  in the driveway outside
Ben leaps at the door, pushes Mrs
Robinson aside, struggles with the door, gets the door open, runs into the hall and down the stairs
39
- Ben rushes into the sunroom and sits down
of on the driveway outside
Ben jumps up, gets the glass he had been drinking from and sits down again
of the front door  and
' Is that Ben's car in front
(jumping up) Yes, sir
approach the sunroom
enters
drove -  drove Mrs
Robinson home
She wanted me to drive her home so  -  drove her home
Swell
appreciate it
She's upstairs
She wanted me to wait down here till you got home
Standing guard over the old castle, are you
Yes, sir
Mr
Robinson reaches for Ben's glass
Here
It looks like you need a refill
Oh no
What
've got to go
Is anything wrong
You look a little shaken up
No
No - 'm just - 'm just a little worried about my future
'm a little upset about my future
Mr
Robinson takes the glass from him
Come on
Let's have a nightcap together
Mr
Robinson turns his back to Ben to mix the drinks
Ben takes several deep breaths, straightens his tie and checks to see if his fly is okay
Mr
Robinson turns and brings him the drink
Thank you very much, sir
Ben - how old are you now
Twenty
'll be twenty-one next week
(taking out a cigarette) That's a hell of a good age to be
Thank you
wish  was that age again
Because, Ben - Sir
You'll never be young again
know
Ben, can  say something to you
What
How long have we known each other now
Ben shakes his head
How long have you and  known each other
How long have your Dad and  been partners
Quite a while
've watched you grow up, Ben
Yes, sir
In many ways  feel as though you were my own son
Thank you
So  hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice
'd like to hear it
Ben -  think -  think you ought to be taking it a little easier right now than you seem to
Ben nods
Sow a few wild oats
Take things as they come
Have a good time with the girls and so forth
Mrs
Robinson enters the room
She is now wearing the dress she wore earlier
Ben starts to get up
Don't get up
Ben sits
was just telling Ben here he ought to sow a few wild oats
Have a good time while he can
You think that's sound advice
Mrs
Robinson nods
Yes,  do
've got to go
He stands
Mr
Robinson stands up with him
You have yourself a few flings this summer
bet you're quite a ladies' man
Oh no
What
You look like the kind of guy that has to fight them off
(to Mrs
Robinson) Doesn't he look to you like the kind of guy who has to fight them off
Yes, he does
They start out of the sunroom
40
- Oh say - Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday
Oh yes
Ben -  want you to give her a call
will
Great
Mr
Robinson opens the front door and Ben goes out
41
- toward the house
Ben comes toward the car
Mrs
Robinson appears in the doorway; the light behind her makes it difficult to see her face
Benjamin
Yes
Thank you for taking me home
Ben nods
'll see you soon,  hope
Ben continues to walk toward us
' Ladies and gentlemen - your attention, please - for this after- noon's feature attraction
: 42
- The sun shines brightly
Standing and sitting around the pool are Mr
and Mrs
Braddock, their friends
and
, and the Arnold children,  and , who are eight or nine
Watching from across the fence on one side of the house: the young girl from next door and her boy friend
Across the fence on the other side of the house: a quartet of adults, formally dressed as though for a cocktail party, holding drinks and watch- ing
One of them holds a baby
The Braddocks, the Arnolds and their children are dressed in California Contemporary Sport Style: the adults in styles infinitely too young for them, the children in styles infinitely too old for them
Mr
Braddock stands alone at the end of the pool near the house
The others are grouped, more or less, at the other end
Mr
Braddock is hamming it up
Hey, over there --  mean you
Your attention please
Mr
Braddock has moved over by one of the windows of the house, the window into the kitchen
He speaks quickly - in a fake sotto voce - towards the window
Are you ready in there, feature attraction
' Could  speak to you for a second, Dad
But Mr
Braddock has already moved away from the window and is readdressing his audience
- what was  saying
Feature attraction
Right
Hey - 'm glad to see you're paying attention feature attraction that will be one of the most astounding events ever to take place in this particular backyard
They all laugh and some applaud
Now 'm going to ask for a big round of applause to bring this boy out here - wait a minute - let me amend that - to bring this young man out here - because today he is twenty-one-years- old - (his hands like a megaphone) Let's get on with the show
Just hang on a minute because have a few words to say - You always do
They laugh; Mrs
Arnold makes a face at Mr
Arnold as he grinningly acknowledges the reponse to his snappy comeback
' Dad - could we just talk about this for a second
Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning - Bring him out
On with the show
On with the show
(to the window) can't hold them much longer, Ben
You better get out here
' 'd like to discuss this
(to his audience) This boy - 'm sorry - this young man - is soon to continue his education as a Frank Halping- ham Award Scholar - but before he does - Mr
Braddock darts back to the window
- before he does - (to the window) You're disappointing them, Ben
You're disappointing them
' Dad - can you listen - (meaning it) 'll give you ten seconds
(back to the people) He is going to give us a practical demonstration of what  feel safe in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present - and it better work or 'm out over two hundred bucks - so let's hear it for - Mr
Braddock moves to the screen door and pushes it open
It slams against the wall inside
- Benjamin Braddock
44
-     - At the back of the hall, inside the house, stands Ben, dressed in a full length skin diver's wet suit, flippers on his feet, the oxygen tank strapped to his back, the mask pushed up his forehead, the air hose dangling
He holds a spear gun in his hand
The people applaud
45	      - -  ' The people in the backyard
His father stands just outside the screen door
Folks - this remarkable young man is going to perform for you some spectacular and amazing feats of daring in water that is over six feet deep - Ben's arms come into view and pull the mask down
We are now looking through the mask as we down the hall
Everything is slightly distorted through the glass
Ben's hand comes up again with the breathing apparatus in it
: the rythmic  of air, obliterating the of the people around the pool who seem to be applauding and chattering noiselessly
We  out of the door and toward the pool
Mr
Braddock is running back and forth, clapping his hands and delivering his now soundless pitch
We   the steps and into the shallow end of the pool
Mr
Braddock is moving along the side of the pool, motioning toward us to come down to the deep end
He joins Mr
Arnold at the far end of the pool
They both begin to motion us toward them
We get to the deep end of the pool
Mr
Braddock signals us with his hand to go under
He kneels down by the edge of the pool and reaches out with his hand and pushes us under
He has a big smile
We  again and   for a last look
The figures, through the slightly distorted glass of the mask of Mrs
Arnold and Mrs
Braddock, watching and smiling; the neighbors on each side of the house, looking over their fences and laughing and pointing; Mr
Arnold nodding encouragement and talking; Mr
Braddock on his knees, smiling and trying to reach out far enough to push us under
We   and  to the bottom of the pool
46
- ( ) Looking down on the pool, on Ben's black suited body at the bottom and the people standing around the pool, looking down into it
Until there are thirty houses below us, with its owners, swimming, playing, eating, cooking, reading, dancing, sunbathing, constructing and gardening around thirty pools
of Ben's  , fading into the of the
Hold for a few seconds, then: of a dime  into a pay phone and
: 47
-  -  - In a phone booth
The booth is in the entrance area of the hotel between the lobby and the driveway
Ben holds the receiver to his ear
of
' Hello
Mrs
Robinson -  don't quite know how to put this - ' Benjamin
Look -  was thinking about that time after the party - ' Where are you
- and  was wondering if  could buy you a drink or something - ' Where are you
Uh - The Taft Hotel
' Did you get a room
No
Now  know it's pretty late and if you'd rather - ' Give me an hour
What
' 'll be there in an hour
of her
Ben hangs up slowly
He stands up in the booth, looks around, moves about uncomfortably for a few moments, removes his jacket and carrying it folded across his arm in front of him, leaves the phone booth and crosses to the doors that lead to the main lobby
As he is about to go in, the doors open and a group of    start coming out, filling the doorway and moving very slowly, muttering to each other and helping each other out of the door and down the steps
Ben holds one of the doors open for them and stands politely to one side
As they get through, Ben starts to move inside
At that moment, , dressed as though for a high school dance, push him to one side and move past him into the lobby
He moves back against the other door, holding it open and allowing them to go in first
He smiles politely and they pay no attention to him at all
He follows them into the lobby
They move toward the front desk and he moves with them
One of the boys at the front of the group leans in and says something to the  behind the desk
The clerk points across the lobby and says something to him
There are the  of an orchestra  some- where
The group of young people passes by the desk and Ben moves in behind them
He pauses at the desk and looks apprehensively at the hundreds of pigeon holes against the wall with the room numbers painted under them and the keys dangling suggestively
Can  help you, sir
What
Oh - no - 'm just - He points vaguely in the direction of the other young people
Are you here for an affair, sir
Terror and disbelief start in Ben's eyes
He looks helplessly at the clerk
What
The Singleman party, sir
Oh - yes
The Singleman party
It's in the main ballroom
Ahh - thank you
Ben backs off and turns and starts across the lobby
He puts on his jacket as he goes
He gets to the entrance to the main ballroom
He pauses at the door, looks in
What he sees:  People dancing, talking, sitting, etc
He turns back toward te lobby
He stops
What he sees:  The room clerk scross the lobby watching him
Ben flashes a huge smile and points in toward the ballroom as though to express his joy at finding the Singleman affair inside, then turns back and enters the ballroom
48
- As Ben steps inside
Hello
Ben turns
Four people stand in a row
Official greeters, they are:   - ,   , -- , dressed formally and they are smiling with great determination
Hello
It is the older lady who has said hello
You must be one of the Porters
She grasps Ben's hand and shakes it
No - actually 'm not - 'd like you to know my sister, Miss DeWitte - , who, from the looks of things, always has been and always will be, Miss DeWitte, takes Ben's hand
DeWITTE How do you do
How do you do, Miss DeWitte
- and my husband, Mr
Singleman - Ben finds himself shaking the twelve-year-old boy's hand
(apologetically) Oh - sorry - Fine, thank you
That's Jeffrey, of course
Ben switches to Mr
Singleman's hand
Of course
didn't get your name, sir
Benjamin Braddock, sir
Mrs
Singleman looks at the seating list she has been holding
Braddock - Braddock
Yes, but 'm afraid - 'll find your table in a moment
Braddock
Not Braniff
We have a Braniff
No - actually 'm just looking for a friend
'm afraid  don't understand
(backing off) 'm not with your party - 'm sorry
Hey -  don't get it
Ben is backing out
DeWITTE 've enjoyed meeting you, Mr
Braniff
Angela - please
Ben backs out of the ballroom
49
- Ben crosses the lobby, passing  going in and out of the hotel
He stops at the entrance of the Veranda Room: 50
- This is a large room with a bar and many tables along the windows that look out over the hotel grounds
It is quite dark and cool inside and there are no more than a dozen people seated around
The   at the door as Ben walks into the room and crosses to the far end where he sits down at the table by the window

She pauses, looks into the room, sees Ben and starts toward him
Ben is looking out the window
He does not see her approach
Hello, Benjamin
Oh
Hello
Hello
He rises quickly
May  sit down
Of course
He pulls out a chair, for her
Thank you
They sit down
How are you
Very well
Thank you
Ben tries to smile then looks out the window, then down at the center of the table
May  have a drink
drink
Of course
Ben looks toward a passing  and raises his hand
The waiter pays no attention
Ben looks back at Mrs
Robinson apologetically
He didn't see me
Waiter
For a moment, the noise in the room seems to recede
The waiter stops in his tracks, turns toward them
The waiter moves to their table
The noise in the room comes back
The waiter looks at Mrs
Robinson
will have a martini
No
1 Yes, madam
The waiter moves away
Ben watches him go
You don't have to be so nervous, you know
Nervous
Well,  am a bit nervous

Did you get us a room
What
Have you gotten us a room yet

No
Do you want to
Well -  don't

Or we could just talk
Do you want me to get it

Now
Yes
Well -  don't know
Why don't you get it
Why don't  get it

Ben walks out of the Veranda Room and into the lobby
55
- Ben walks to the front desk and stands there
Yes sir
room
'd like a room, please
single room or a double room
single
Just for myself, please
Will you sign the register, please
He pushes the card and a pen toward Ben
Ben writes his name on the card and then stares at it for a moment, crumples it up and fills out a second card
Is anything wrong, sir
What
No
Nothing
(taking a key from behind the counter) Do you have any luggage, Mister -- (looks at registration card) Gladstone
Luggage

Where is your luggage

It's out in the car

If that's all right
Of course
Ben reaches for the key
'll have a porter show you the room
Oh
Well actually, 'd just as soon find it myself
just have the toothbrush to carry up and think  can manage it myself
Whatever you say, sir
He hands Ben the key
Thank you
56
- Mrs
Robinson sits, patiently and calmly
Her face betrays absolutely nothing as she stares ahead of her and sips her martini
No
1 Mrs
Robinson
She looks up
waiter is standing next to the table with a telephone
Yes
The waiter plugs the phone into the wall socket next to the table and hands her the receiver
Thank you
The waiter nods and leaves
(into phone) Hello
' Mrs
Robinson
Yes
' It's Benjamin
Yes
' Benjamin Braddock
Benjamin -- where are you
' Can you look through the glass
Mrs
Robinson turns in her chair and looks through the glass into the lobby
57
-   -  - Ben is in the phone booth in the lobby no more than twenty feet away
' Can you see me now
Yes,  can
58 Over Ben's shoulder, we can see his face reflected in the glass door and, through it, Mrs
Robinson sitting in the Veranda Room
got a single room
That's fine
But there's one thing
The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious
mean -  don't know what their policy is - but - Well - do you want to go up first
Yes -  think that would be good
'll be up in five minutes
Well - goodbye then - Benjamin
Yes
Isn't there something you want to tell me
To tell you
Yes
Well -  want you to know how much appreciate this - really - The number
What
The room number, Benjamin
think you ought to tell me that
Oh
You're absolutely right
Absolutely
It's 512
Thank you
You're welcome
Well - 'll see you later, Mrs
Robinson
He hangs up
59
-   -  - He leaves the hpone booth and walks back into the main lobby
60
- As he passes the desk, on his way to the elevator, he starts to pat his breast pocket
've got it
The desk clerk looks up
say 've got it
Sir
The toothbrush
got it all right
Very good, sir
Yes
Well - goodnight
Goodnight, sir
Ben walks out of shot
60A
- Ben leaves elevator, walks down corridor to hotel room and opens door
61
- Ben closes the door behind him and leans with his back against it for a few moments looking at the room
The only light is that coming in the window
Ben turns on the light switch on the wall near the door
The room blazes with the light from three lamps and an overhead fixture
He turns the switch off
He crosses to the bathroom
Ben steps in and turns on the light
61
- Ben steps out, moves to the window
We see the pool area through the window
Ben closes the blinds
61Cont
There is a  on the door
Ben crosses to the door and opens it
Mrs
Robinson moves to the bureau and puts her purse and gloves on it
She looks at herself in the mirror for a moment then turns slowly, looking at the room, finally ending on Ben's face
She steps toward him
Well
He clears his throat and then he kisses her
Well
Benjamin
Yes
'll get undressed now
Is that all right
Sure
Shall  -  mean shall  just stand here
mean -  don't know what you want me to do
Why don't you watch
Oh - sure
Thank you
She takes off her jacket
Will you bring me a hanger
What
hanger
Ben opens the closet door
Oh - yes
Wood
What
Wood or wire
They have both
Either one will be fine
Okay
He brings her a hanger
She puts her jacket on it
Will you help me with this, please
She turns her back
Certainly
He undoes the zipper at her neck
Thank you
You're welcome
She turns and looks at him
He backs away
Would this be easier for you in the dark
Mrs
Robinson -  can't do this
You what
This is all terribly wrong
Benjamin - do you find me undesirable
Oh no, Mrs
Robinson
think - think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends
just don't think we could possibly -- Are you afraid of me
No - but look - maybe we could do something else together, Mrs
Robinson - would you like to go to a movie
Benjamin, is this your first time
Is this - what
It is, isn't it
It is your first time
That's a laugh, Mrs
Robinson
That's really a laugh
Ha ha
You can admit that, can't you
Are you kidding
It's nothing to be ashamed of - Wait a minute
On your first time - Who said it was my first time
That you're afraid - Wait a minute
- of bring - inadequate -   mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way - pause
(starting to dress) Don't move
He slams the bathroom door shut
The light in the room disappears
62
- The midsummer sun beats down on the Braddock swimming pool and on Ben who lies on a rubber raft in the middle of the pool
Ben wears dark glasses, is deeply tanned, and holds a beer can in one hand
:  teenagers  and swimming in nearby pools; a radio  rock and roll; a television set  to a ball game
: 63	  - drifting
: 64 drifting
: 65	  - of the back door
Ben opens his eyes and moves his head slightly
66 Mr
Braddock is passionately stoking a barbeque fire
Mrs
Braddock is going toward him from the house, carrying some ominously large thing wrapped in tinfoil
67	 - He rolls off the raft and swims to the end of the pool
He climbs out, walks to the back door, takes his shirt from a chair and starts to put it on as he opens the back door and goes through
68
- Ben has just shut the door to the bathroom behind him
He is wearing his shirt, buttoned, and no trousers
as he walks across the room past Mrs
Robinson who is standing in front of the bureau taking off her brace- let and watch
He moves to a chair and sits
He picks up a cigarette from an ashtray on a table next to the chair
Mrs
Robinson moves in to Ben, kneels in front of him and starts to unbutton his shirt
He takes the cigarette out of his mouth
69
-      - - We now see behind Ben the door that leads from the Braddock den, in which Ben is sitting
In the dining room, Mr
and Mrs
Braddock are sitting, having their dinner, looking through the doorways toward Ben
Ben stands, crosses back to the door to the den and shuts it
70
-  - On Ben's back as he returns to the chair and sits television set, facing the chair, is on
Ben picks up a can of beer and drinks from it
An animated cartoon is playing on the television set
Ben watches it
71 Ben's face, watching
to  of his face
72 of television set and cartoon
73 Ben watching
74 test pattern
: 75
- Ben watching
and we are in the Taft Hotel Room
Ben is sitting on the bed, leaning against the headboard, watching the television set which is on a stand facing the bed
of the  of the test pattern
to a   of the room, lit only by the light from the television set
Mrs
Robinson walks into the shot, half dressed
She passes between Ben and the television set and goes out of frame
Ben continues to stare at the set
of a  being pulled up
Mrs
Robinson appears again and passes the other way
of  being put on
Mrs
Robinson passes back the other way again
of  being put on and a  being snapped closed
Mrs
Robinson, now fully dressed and carrying her purse, passes through again and, without looking at Ben, goes to the door of the hotel room, opens it and exits
76
'  -  -  - of  closing
Follow Ben as he gets up and moves to the windows of what is now his  in the Braddock house
He opens the closed blinds over the window
The sun is bright outside
His bathing suit is on the window sill
He takes the suit and puts it on
He moves to the bedroom door, opens it and goes out
77 78
- We see Mrs
Braddock in the kitchen
Ben comes through the back door, moves to the pool and dives in
The raft floats in the center of the pool
79	 - Ben swims toward us the length of the pool
80	 - Ben surfaces and, in one movememt, pulls himself up on the raft and - : 81
- - lands on top of Mrs
Robinson on the bed
He stays on top of her for a moment
' Ben - what are you doing
Ben turns toward us and looks
: 82
- - Mr
Braddock standing by the side of the pool
The sun is behind him
' Well -  would say that 'm just drifting
: 83	 - - here - in the pool
Why
Well - it's very comfortable - just to drift here
Have you thought about graduate school
No
Would you  mind telling me then - what were those four years of college for
What was the point of all that hard work
You got me
(trying unsuccessfully to control himself) Now listen, Ben
think it's a very good thing that a young man - after he's done some very good work - should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on
But after a few weeks believe that person would want to take some stock in him- self and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass
Mrs
Braddock steps in beside Mr
Braddock
The Robinson's are here
Mr
Robinson steps in beside the others
They blot out the sun
Hi, Ben
What are you doing with yourself these days
Oh - not too much
Taking it easy
That's what 'd do if  could
Nothing wrong with that
Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon
want you to call her up this time
will
Because  just think you two would hit it off real well together
Mrs
Robinson steps in beside them
( long pause) Say hello to Mrs
Robinson, Benjamin
84	 - Hello, Mrs
Robinson
Hello, Benjamin
: 85
'  - Ben, halfway dressed to go out, in slacks, shirt and tie, sits in a chair
The door opens and Mrs
Braddock enters
Can  talk to you a minute
Sure
Benjamin
'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want
What
Well 'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night
When  go off
You don't have to tell me if you don't want
No,  do
want to tell you
There is a pause
drive around
What else
Nothing else
Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin
Oh, no
Then what do you do
Do you meet someone
Meet someone
She nods
Why did you say that
Well this is your business, Benjamin
(she starts toward the door) If you - No wait
Wait
She stops
don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that
Benjamin, 'm not going to pry into your affairs, but 'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest
Goodnight, Benjamin
Well, wait
She looks at him
You think 'm being dishonest
She nods
Well why do you - why do you think that
Because  know you don't drive around for twelve hours
Oh
Well,  don't
Shall tell you what  do
Not if you don't want to
do
But  don't want you to make up something
'm not
But 'm - 'm not very proud of what  do
usually get kind of drunk
usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk
Then  take a hotel room
So  won't have to drive home on the freeway
mean it kind of scares me to drive home after - Goodnight, Benjamin
You believe me, don't you
No
You don't
She shakes her head
But  want you to
Please
Please will you believe me
85A	 - (she exits) Goodnight
' Wait a minute
: 86- 90 91
-  -  - Mrs
Robinson's hands are undoing his necktie
Ben is dressed as in previous scene, plus a jacket
Wait a minute
(he pushes her hand away) Sit down a minute
Mrs
Robinson looks at him and raises her eyebrows
Will you please sit down a minute
Mrs
Robinson walks to the bed and sits
She reaches down to take off a shoe
Will you leave that shoe on for a minute
Please
She straightens up
Now - do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time
If you want
Good
mean are we dead or something
Well  just don't think we have much to say to each other
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together
Are you tired of it
'm not
No
But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then
Well what do you want to talk about
Anything
Anything at all
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences
Oh my God
Well
Mrs
Robinson
If that's the best we can do let's just get the god- damn clothes off and -- She reaches for her shoe
Leave it on
Now we are going to do this thing
We are going to have a conversation
Think of another topic
How about art
Art
That's a good subject
You start it off
You start it off
don't know anything about it
Oh
Don't you
Yes  do
know quite a bit about it
Go ahead then
Art
Well what do you want to know about it
She shrugs
Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art
Neither
You're not interested in art
No
Then why do you want to talk about it
don't
Ben nods and looks at the rug
Can  take off my clothes now
No
Think of another topic
Tell me what you did today
Do you really want me to
Yes  do
got up
Ben starts shaking his head
Do you want to hear it or not
Yes
But you might try and spice it up with a little originality
got up
ate breakfast and went shopping
During the after- noon  read a novel
What one
What
What novel did you read
don't remember
Ben nods
Then  fixed supper for my husband and waited until - There
What
Your husband
Mrs
Robinson
There's something we could have a conversation about
Him
mean everything
don't know anything about how you - how you work this
don't know how you get out of the house at night don't know the risk involved
There isn't any
There's no risk
She shakes her head
How do you get out of the house
walk out
You walk right out the door
She nods
What do you say to him
He's asleep
Always
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic
Please
Now tell me
How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you
Because he takes sleeping pills
He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock
But what about the noise from the car
What if - The driveway's on my side of the house
(smiling) We're talking
What
We're talking, Mrs
Robinson
We're talking
Calm down, Benjamin
Now let's keep going here
Can  undress and talk at the same time
Right
Thank you
Now
You say the driveway's on your side of the house
So guess you don't sleep in the same room
We don't
So you don't -  mean  don't like to seem like 'm prying but  guess you don't sleep together or anything
No we don't
Well how long has this been going on
(looking at the ceiling for a moment) About five years
Oh no
Are you kidding me
No
You have not slept with your husband for five years
Now and then
He geats drunk a few times a year
How many times a year
On New Year's Eve
Sometimes on his birthday
Man, is this interesting
Is it
So you don't love him
You wouldn't say you - We've talked enough, Benjamin
Wait a minute
So you wouldn't say you loved him
Not exactly
But you don't hate him
No, Benjamin
don't hate him
Unhook my blouse
(unhooking her blouse) Well how do you feel about him, then
don't
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it
Is it
mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse
If you hated him at least you'd hate him
She nods and takes off her blouse
Well you loved him once, assume
When you first knew him
No
What
never did, Benjamin
Now let's - Well, wait a minute
You married him
She nods
Why did you do that
(taking off her stockings) See if you can guess
Well  can't
Think real hard, Benjamin
can't see why you did, unless you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you
Don't tell Elaine
Oh no
You had to marry him because you got pregnant
Are you shocked
Well  never thought of you and Mr
Robinson as the kind of people who
All right
Now let's get to bed
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
So how did it happen
What
mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances
Not particularly
Was he a law student at the time
She nods
And you were a student also
Yes
At college
Yes
What was your major
Why are you asking me all this
Because 'm interested, Mrs
Robinson
Now what was your major subject at college
Art
Art
She nods
But  thought you -  guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then
Kind of
Well how did it happen
How do you think
mean did he take you up to his room with him
Did you go to a hotel
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter
'm curious
We'd go to his car
Oh no
In the car you did it
don't think we were the first
Ben thinks for a moment
What kind of car was it
What
Do you remember the make of the car
Oh my God
Really
want to know
It was a Ford, Benjamin
(jumping up) Ford
Ford
Goddamnit, a Ford
That's great
That's enough
So old Elaine Robinson got started in a Ford
There is a pause
Don't talk about Elaine
Don't talk about Elaine
No
Why not
Because  don't want you to
She walks to the bed
Well why don't you
She pulls the bedspread down
Ben begins to remove his jacket
wish you'd tell me
There's nothing to tell
Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden
Mrs
Robinson uncovers one of the pillows
Well -  guess 'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's -- Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out
Ben looks at her
Do you understand that
Well look
have no intention of taking her out
Good
was just kidding around
Good
But why shouldn't
have my reasons
Then let's hear them
No
Let's hear your reasons, Mrs
Robinson
Because  think know what they are
She pulls the covers down
'm not good enough for her to associate with, am
'm not good enough to even talk about her, am
Let's drop it
We're not dropping it
Now that's the reason, isn't it
'm a dirty degenerate, aren't 'm not fit to - Benjamin
'm good enough for you but 'm too slimy to associate with your daughter
That's it, isn't it
'
Yes
You go to hell
You go straight to hell, Mrs
Robinson
Do you think 'm proud of myself
Do you think 'm proud of this
wouldn't know
Well, 'm not
You're not
No sir
am not proud that spend my time with a broken- down alcoholic
see
And if you think  come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong
She nods
Because - Mrs
Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me
And you do what you want but 'm getting the hell out
Are you
You're goddamn right  am
He starts putting on his shirt
She sits on the edge of the bed and watches him
That's how you feel about me
He nods
That 'm a sick and disgusting person
Now don't start this
What
Don't start acting hurt
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt
Mrs
Robinson, you stand there and tell me 'm not good enough for your daughter
Did  say that
Of course you did
She shakes her head
Benjamin,  want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got
Well two minutes ago you told me  wasn't good enough for your daughter
Now you say you're sorry  got that impression
didn't mean it
don't think you'd be right for each other
But  would never say you weren't as good a person as she is
You wouldn't
Of course  wouldn't
Mrs
Robinson walks to the closet
What are you doing
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more
Well look -  was kind of upset there
'm sorry  said those things
If that's how you feel - But it's not
(smiling at him) That's all right
think can understand why 'm disgusting to you
Oh no
Look -  like you wouldn't keep coming here if didn't like you
But if it's sickening for you - It's not
enjoy it
look forward to it
It's the one thing  have to look forward to
You don't have to say that
Well  wouldn't
would never say it if it wasn't true
May  stay then
Yes
Please
want you to
Thank you
Well don't thank me, because want you to
There is a long pause
But you won't ever take out Elaine, will you
want you to promise me that
There is another long pause
Look
Why the hell did you bring this up
It never occured to me to take her out
Then give me your word you won't
This is absurd
Promise me, Benjamin
All right, for christ's sake
promise  will never take out Elaine Robinson
Thank you
(pause) Benjamin - Let's not talk about it
Let's not talk at all
At opposite sides of the room, without looking at each other, they begin to take off their clothes
92
- Ben sits at the table, eating his breakfast and looking at the back of a cereal box
Mr
and Mrs
Braddock are there
Elaine's back from school think it might be a nice gesture if you asked her out
Benjamin looks at his father for a moment, then continues eating and reading
: 93
'  - Ben is lying on his bed
Mrs
Braddock stands in the doorway
Don't you think that she's a terribly attractive girl
Because  think she's one of the prettiest girls 've ever seen
Ben gives a small whimper
: 94
- Ben is lying face down on his raft in the middle of the Braddock pool
The sun shines down
His diving mask is on over his eyes
His face is in the water, looking down at the bottom of the pool
Mr
and Mrs
Braddock, in their bathing suits, are in the pool, paddling around Ben
During the entire conversation they continue to swim around and around the raft, trying to talk and keep their heads above the surface
It's pretty embarrassing really don't know what to tell Mr
Robinson
It's ackward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine
Next time he suggests it, 'll tell him  have no intention of ever calling her up in my life
guess she's not good enough for you, is that it
Look - Elaine Robinson and do not get along
How do you know
You haven't seen her since high school guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable
That has nothing to do with it - guess 'll just tell Mr
Robinson that you're just too busy every evening - doing God knows what - Don't go on like this
Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out - do
- then 'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on Thursday
95	 - He slides off the raft and goes underwater
96	 - His hair streaming up, his eyes open
: 97
- The dining room is one tenth its normal size
At a table for two are seated, jammed in against each other, the three Robinsons and the three Braddocks
Elaine's back is to us
Ben is at the other end of the table, facing us
The Robinsons and Braddocks sit along the sides
Mrs
Robinson is next to Ben, everyone is eating, looking down at their places
After a few moments Ben throws his head back ans starts to scream
As he continues to scream, everyone looks at him except Mrs
Robinson who continues to eat calmly without looking up
: 98
- Ben surfaces and pulls himself up on the side of the pool
'll go call Elaine now
Mr
and Mrs
Braddock cling exhausted to the raft and try to smile at each other
:  Ding dong of the Robinson door chimes
: 99
&
,    - The door opens
Mr
Robinson stands there with a huge smile
Well, Braddock - it's about time you got around to this
Come on in
'm afraid the young lady isn't quite ready yet - Mr
Robinson turns toward the sunroom
Mrs
Robinson is sitting there
Hello
What would you say to a short one
Bourbon still your drink
Yes
Mr
Robinson hands him drink
'll see if she's ready
Mr
Robinson exits
100	 - Following dialogue played simultaneously ' Now listen -- this was not		   (from hall) my idea
It was my father's	Hey -- there she is

It's definitely Miss America

The clasp is broken  think

Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and 'll			' bring her back

So don't get upset about it
But  am
'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin
Mr
Robinson and  enter
Hello
Hello
101	 - ' Well -  want you to keep your wits about you tonight
You never know what tricks Ben picked up back there in the East
: 102
- -    in Ben's car
From the back
Ben leans forward slightly, pushing the car recklessly in and out of the traffic
Ben is wearing dark glasses
You're living at home now
Is that right
Yes
Do you know what you're going to do
No
Are you going to graduate school
No
He leans on the
The car directly ahead of him does not move to the right
Ben jerks his car over to the right, swerves around the car ahead, jamming his horn down, and swerves back into the outside lane, giving the driver of the other car an angry look as he passes him
Elaine holds on to the dashboard to keep her balance
Do you always drive like this
Yes
: 103
- drab, almost deserted room with formally dressed
Ben and Elaine are seated at a table
Do you want some dinner
'd love some
waiter moves forward toward them
Bring a menu
#2 Dinner for two, sir
No
Just for her
The waiter moves away
Aren't you eating
No
Why not
If it's all right with you, 'm not hungry
The waiter returns with a menu
've changed my mind
Thank you

-  - Ben and Elaine walking on the strip
105
- Ben pushes through the people crowded in around the entrance
Without turning around, he waits for Elaine who has difficulty following him
As she gets to him, he starts forward again
He starts up the stairs
Elaine is just behind him
: 106
- Seedy, ugly, three quarters filled
tuxedoed  leads them through the tables to a table directly under the stage on which a  is in the process of removing her dress
There is one chair facing the stage, the other with its back to and up against the stage
Ben sits down in the chair facing the stage
Elaine stands for a moment, unsure
Sit down
Elaine sits in the chair with her back to the stage
She folds her hands on the table and looks down at them
Ben takes a pair of dark glasses out of his pocket and puts them on
The two chairs are slightly angled toward each other so that Ben can look up at the stage without looking directly at Elaine
Why don't you watch the show
The stripper is reflected in Ben's glasses
Benjamin - do you dislike me for some reason
No - why should
don't know
107	 -   - She is down to a tasseled bra and g-string
She is twirling the tassels
You're missing a great effect here
Elaine turns around, looks at the stripper and turns back
How do you like that
Elaine doesn't answer
Could you do it
No
The stripper sees Elaine look
The stripper smiles toward Ben and walks toward his table, twirling the tassels as she walks
Ben smiles as he watches her approaching
The stripper moves directly behind Elaine's chair
The spotlight from the back of the house falls into Elaine's face
As it does, Elaine puts her hand up to shield her eyes
The stripper slides a finger into her mouth, wets it and holds it up in the air
The music stops and a starts
The stripper bends over Elaine's head and begins swinging the tassels so that they rotate in front of Elaine's face
108	 - He leans forward slightly to watch the action
The swinging tassels are reflected in his glasses
The   gets louder and faster
The tassels swing more frantically
109	 - She pulls her hand down from in front of her eyes
110	 - With Elaine's face reflected in his glasses
111	 - Through Ben's glasses
Elaine's face seen darkly but fully for the first time
The tassels swing in front of it
Tears start out of her eyes
112	 - He reaches up to remove the glasses
113	 - As the glasses come off and her face is seen in the harsh spill from the spotlight
The tears are running down her face
Only her eyes are crying as she looks straight at Ben
114	 - With his glasses off, he watches her
He reaches forward and puts his hand in the way of the tassels
Hey
Some of the customers start to boo
Ben rises, takes Elaine's arm and leads her toward the exit
: 115
- The entrance to the strip joint
Elaine runs to the bottom of the steps
The Sunset Strip sidewalk outside is crowded with people moving back and forth
Ben follows her
She pushes through the crowd on the sidewalk
Ben catches her and holds her arm
Elaine - 'm sorry
Elaine leans against the side of the building and pulls her arm away
Will you take me home now
'm sorry  took you in there
think 'd better go home now please
But, Elaine - Where is the car
just want to tell you something
Ben, facing her, keeps moving from side to side, trying to get her to look at him
She keeps looking away
want to go home
But could  just tell you this one thing
What
This whole idea - this date and everything
It was my parents' idea
They forced me into it
Oh - that's very nice of you to tell me
No
What  mean is - that's why 've been acting this way
'm not like this
hate myself like this
She starts to cry
People on the sidewalk are looking at them
She turns away from them
Ben moves away from them
Ben moves around in front of her
Listen - could you stop crying, please
No,  couldn't
But could you try
No
She brings both hands up to her face
Ben looks at her for a few moments in agony
Then, very determined, he takes her wrists in his hands and pulls them away from her face
She looks up startled
She starts to give a little cry but before she can he is kissing her
She closes her eyes
He brings his fists, containing her hands, up to the side of her face
He opens his hands against her face, freeing her hands
Her hands move slowly to his wrists and hang on
After a while she pulls away, turning her head slightly to one side
Elaine - He starts to pull her head back
Not here
Not here
: 116
- Ben and Elaine are sitting in the car in a drive-in restaurant
There are trays hooked onto windows along side of both of them
They are eating and drinking furiously
've had this feeling - ever since 've graduated - this - kind of compulsion that  have to be rude all the time
Do you know what  mean
Yes,  do
He looks at her
It's like 've been playing some kind of - game - but the rules don't make any sense to me - She is watching him carefully
- they're being made up by all the wrong people - no -  mean no one makes them up, they seem to have made themselves up
car with a    has driven up in the slot on their right
Its  is tuned into a rock and roll station and it is playing
Ben leans across Elaine and speaks through the window to the kid behind the wheel
Say -  wonder if  could request you to turn that down a little
The kid turns the radio up
Ben and Elaine roll their windows up
117 From outside of car
Ben is talking with great animation - Elaine is watching him
They are both eating as Ben talks, telling Elaine a story
Their windows are rolled up
: Cars  their ; horns ; radios ; waitresses  orders; customers at waitresses; kids  and  from car to car;  driving in and out,
: 118
- The car coasts silently to a stop in front of the Robinson house
The  plays
Ben turns it
They sit there for a long time without saying anything, Ben's hand touching her shoulder
It is very quiet
Well - maybe 'd better go in
He nods
They continue to sit there for another long moment
Would you like to come in could make some coffee
No,  mean -  wouldn't want to wake anyone up
We won't
Let's go inside
Wait a minute
Is anything wrong
No -  was just thinking - look - it's still early - we could do something - go somewhere else
All right
He starts the car immediately and drives away from the house
119
'  - Ben is driving
Where we going
'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here
Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel
There is a  of  as Ben almost drives off the road
What is the matter
Nothing
'm just wondering if they have a bar or not
mean let's go see
Let's go see if they do or not
120
- Ben and Elaine enter the lobby and stand just inside the door
They start in a few steps
Listen, Elaine - it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here
mean - as far as  know
Of course there is
Look - The Veranda Room - right there
of the   passes them on his way out
Good evening
passes them
Hello, how are you, sir
The room clerk smiles at them
Good evening, Mr
Gladstone
Ben and Elaine stop a few feet into the center of the lobby
The    to a revealing many people moving back and forth in the lobby, passing Ben and Elaine
#1 Hello again
#2 Hi, Mr
Gladstone
How are you this evening
Benjamin - Let's get out of here, Elaine
Let's go somewhere else
Benjamin - do they know you
Of course not
#3 Good evening, sir
#4 Mr
Gladstone - how are you
He moves her toward the door
Come on, Elaine
We're leaving
: 121 Ben brings Elaine through the door to the porch
Ben - what's happening
Who is Mr
Gladstone
don't know
They must think look like this guy Gladstone
as they start down the steps
Coming up the steps toward them is Miss DeWitte, on the arm of another
DeWITTE Hello, Mr
Brannif
:  Car  noisily
122
- Ben and Elaine in his car
He takes his hand off the ignition, jams on the accelerator and drives the car speedily for twenty-one feet and jams on the brakes
He turns off the ignition and the lights
He puts his head down on the steering wheel
He lifts his head
Elaine -  like you
like you so much
Do you believe that
She nods
Do you
Yes
You're the first - you're the first thing for so long that 've liked
The first person could stand to be with
She takes his hand
mean my whole life is such a waste
It's just nothing
'm sorry
'll take you home now
He turns the key in the ignition and starts the car
Benjamin - are having an affair with someone
He freezes with his hand still on the key
'm sorry
He turns off the engine
'm sorry
That is not my business
It just happened
It was just this thing that happened along with everything else
Can you understand that
She nods
Was she married or something
Yes
With a family
Yes
She had a husband and a son
Did they ever find out
No
And it's all over now
Yes
'm glad
He starts the car and drives out
123
-  -  - ' Can we do something tomorrow
All right
During the day
We'll go for a drive or something
Okay
You sure you really want to
Yes
Because  wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to
do
You do
Benjamin -  really do
: 124
1 -    - -
'  - It is raining
On the seat beside Ben is a package
From the way it is wrapped, we can tell it is a gift
Ben's right hand is on it as he drives
The radio is playing
Past Ben and through the windsheild as the Robinson house comes closer and closer
The front door of the Robinson house opens and Mrs
Robinson comes out, dressed in a housecoat, and, in four or five fast steps, reaches the car, opens the door on the passengers side and climbs in
Ben moves the package over into his lap
Drive down the block
Mrs
Robinson -  have a date with Elaine
We're going for a drive
(looking at him for the first time) Do exactly what  say
Ben starts the car forward down the driveway
125	  - As they drive
Now it seems to me - Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin
You are not to see Elaine again
Ever
Those are my orders
Is that clear
Ben stops the car in front of a house halfway down the block
Mrs
Robinson - can makes things quite unpleasant
How
In order to keep Elaine away from you -  am prepared to tell her everything
don't believe you
Then you'd better start believing me
Mrs
Robinson, don't wreck it
'm asking you please not to wreck it
Go home now
just don't believe you would do that
Mrs
Robinson looks at him for a moment
Try me
There is a pause while Ben looks at her expression
Then he grabs the keys out of the ignition, opens the door on his side and jumps out of the car, carrying the package
as he runs up the street and up the drive- way toward the Robinson house
Ben gets to the front door
(as he goes through the door) Elaine
126
, ,   '  - Ben runs in
Elaine
' Benjamin
'm coming up
' 'm not dressed yet
Ben runs up the stairs
He still carries the package
Ben gets to the top just as Elaine comes out of the door to her bedroom
She is wearing a skirt and slip and carrying one shoe
Benjamin -  said  wasn't dressed - Ben pushes her back into her room
127
'  - What's the matter
You've got to go over the back fence and 'll meet you on the corner
Benjamin - what's happening
Hurry up
Put your shoes on
Ben turns and looks
128	 -  ' Mrs
Robinson is just entering the house
He turns around
129 Elaine is standing in the doorway watching him
She still holds the shoe in her hand
Why aren't you ready
Because  want to know what's happening
of Mrs
Robinson's  in the hall below
There isn't time
130
'  - Ben pulls Elaine around behind the open door
They stand in the angle formed by the door and the wall as though they are hiding from someone
Mrs
Robinson's can be heard coming up the stairs
Elaine -  have to tell you something
He holds her against the wall in the corner
What is it
That woman - What
That woman
The older woman
You mean the one who - Yes
The married woman - it wasn't just some woman - Mrs
Robinson's  can be heard coming down the hall
What are you telling me
The  stop
131	 - Back in the corner
Mrs
Robinson's face appears in the crack in the door at Elaine's shoulder
Elaine looks from Ben's face to the crack through which she can see her mother's eyes staring
Please - will somebody tell me - She looks back at Ben, then back at her mother's face again
Mrs
Robinson's eyes watch her through the crack in the door
Elaine looks away
Oh - no
Ben backs up
Elaine - Oh my God - Moving along the wall as though to keep as far from Ben as possible, Elaine moves away from the door
Please
Elaine walks a few steps toward the other side of the room then turns back toward Ben
The tears are starting out of her eyes
No - don't cry - Don't cry
(holds the package out to her) Get out of here
She moves toward him as though to hit him
He backs into the hall
Elaine  the door shut
(holding the door) Get out
132
- Mrs
Robinson stands at the end of it, looking at Ben
(calmly) Goodbye, Benjamin
133	 - He looks at her in horror
He starts to back down the hall toward the stairs, holding the package against his chest
134
-   -  -  - She is standing there, perfectly calm
She gets further and further away as though it is a very long hall in a very bad dream
135
'  - Ben sits cross-legged on his bed in the dark, his back against the fishtank, smoking
: 136
- Ben drives by in his car
He looks at the house
: 137
'   - Ben dressed differently, stands by the window overlooking the backyard
Over his shoulder, we can see Mr
Braddock down by the pool, dressed in a sweater, cleaning the pool with a long-handled scoop
Mr
Braddock looks up at Ben's window
Ben moves aside
: 138
- Ben is standing behind a tree watching the Robinson house
In the driveway of the Robinson house, Elaine is getting into the Robinson car
Mr
Robinson is putting Elaine's luggage into the car
Mrs
Robinson stands at the door
Mr
Robinson gets into the car and starts it
The car drives down the driveway and down the street
: 139
'  - Ben, dressed differently again, sits in a chair by his desk
He is writing
On the piece of paper is written: , , , , and her name several dozen times
He stops and looks up
: 140
- It is early morning
We see a swinging door pushed open to reveal:  Mr
Braddock, dressed in a bathrobe, standing at the kitchen counter by the window through which we can see an orange tree
Mr
Braddock is pouring orange juice from a   container
Ben stands inside door
Say that again
'm going to marry Elaine Robinson
Well - well - well - He almost giggles as he crosses to Ben and takes his hand to shake it
Mrs
Braddock appears in the doorway
Ben is shaking his father's hand
What's happening
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married
don't believe it
That what he says
Right
'm going up to Berkeley today
Oh, Ben - this is so - exciting - Come on, let's call the Robinsons
We've got something to celebrate
No
think you'll want to wait on that
They don't know
No - they don't
Well - when did you decide all this
About an hour ago
Wait a minute
You talked to Elaine this morning
No
She doesn't know about it
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley
No
Actually - she doesn't know about us getting married yet
When did you two talk this over
We haven't
Ben - this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked
No - it's not
It's completely baked
It's a decision 've made
But what makes you think she wants to marry you
Ben picks up his suitcase, walks to the door and turns
She doesn't
To be perfectly honest, she doesn't like me
: 141
1   - Ben driving his car (left to right) ' (over) Dear Elaine -  am now visiting Berkeley, after growing somewhat weary of family life
have been meaning to stop by and pay my respects but am not entirely certain just how you feel about seeing me after the incident involving myself and your mother
It was certainly a serious mistake on my part but not serious enough
hope -- The last part runs down like a record on an old gramaphone
: 142
2 -   - Ben driving his car (left to right) ' (over) Mr
and Mrs
Robinson take great pleasure in announcing the wedding of their daughter
It runs down
: 143
- Ben's car is being gassed up
It is a huge gas station with dozens of pumps and many neon lights
Ben runs to a series of vending machines
He pushes quarters into them, receiving cigarettes, a sandwich, an apple, a cup of coffee
Balancing them all carefully, he runs back to the car, climbs in, puts his purchases on top of the dashboard, hands the attendant a bill and drives off
: 144
3   - Ben driving (left to right) and eating

It runs down
past us and   it as it disappears in the distance
: 149
- as he comes through the door as he wanders around the the commons room which is filled with
Girls , couples necking; a with a heavy knapsack
Ben walks to a 1, who sits at a reception desk
1 May  help you
(too loudly) Elaine Robinson
1 Yes
(clearing his throat) Elaine Robinson
Does she live here
The Receptionist runs her pencil along a list of names under the glass top of her desk
She finds it
1 Three-oh-eight
Shall  call her for you
The Receptionist's hand moves to the receiver of a phone on the desk
Ben looks at her hand for several seconds
He takes a step backward
Her hand starts to lift the receiver
Ben moves backward, puts his hand up as though to stop her and shakes his head, speechlessly
150	 - Looking at Ben
151	 - Move with him as he moves past the students toward the door
: 152
- in a circle, ending on a , standing in the middle of the deserted campus, looking around, lost
: 153
-  - McCLEERY From the bottom of the stairway, shooting up
McCLEERY is the landlord of the rooming house
They are climbing a flight of stairs, Mr
McCleery first, then Ben, carrying his suitcase
McCLEERY You a student
Not exactly
Mr
McCleery stops and turns
Ben almost runs into him
McCLEERY What's that
said - not exactly - no
McCLEERY What are you then
Well - 'm just sort of traveling through
Mr
McCleery takes a couple of steps up, Ben following and stops again
McCLEERY like to know who's living in my house
like to know what my boys are up to
Ahhh
Mr
McCleery just looks up at him
'm not up too much, actually, 'm just visiting
mean - 've always wanted to see Berkeley
Mr
McCleery takes a couple more steps and stops again
McCLEERY You're not one of those agitators
What
McCLEERY One of those outside agitators
Oh - no sir
McCLEERY hate that
won't stand for it
He looks at Ben searchingly, then turns and continues up the stairs and down the hall
: 154
- '  - in a circle, seeing a sink in one corner, a bed, a bureau, a table, a lamp, a chair, a window that overlooks a Berkeley street - ending in a   , standing in the middle of it, looking lost
: 155
-  - The campus is empty except for Ben who, dressed carefully in his black suit, sits on a bench in the quadrangle outside of Wendell Hall
156
-    ( )- During which Ben remains static while the quadrangle and thet area around him fill up with students; walking, talking, hurrying to class, strolling, sitting, reading, handing out petitions, etc
157
-  - Elaine comes out
She walks, carrying her books, in Ben's direction
158	 - He sees her and stiffens
159	 - Approaching from the distance
160	 - He stands
161 As she walks, she is joined by another  with whom she converses as they walk
162	 - Watching
He takes a step forward
163	 - As they approach, they are joined by a tall  with a beard
164	 - He starts toward them, falters, straightens himself
165	 - , , They are getting quite near
Suddenly they are joined by    , in tribal robes
They all greet each other and continue to walk toward us
166	 - He looks at the massed group moving toward him, horror taking over his face
He starts forward
As he passes Elaine and her friends he seems to take a deep breath and hold it
She stops and slowly turns to look in his direction
Her companions also stop
Ben changes his direction and makes a circle to his left as though he has just changed his mind
He looks at her
He does not stop walking
He makes a slow circle around her as he speaks
Elaine
Hey - what a surprise
(not quite looking at her) Say -  thought  remembered that you were going to school up here - well - we'll have to get together sometime - 'll be up here myself for a little while
167	 - ' Elaine and the others staring at him
168	 - - it certainly has been nice - think 'm late - yes,  am - He turns and walks away from them
They stand still watching them go
He starts to walk faster and faster
They watch him as he gets further and further away and then breaks into a run
He disappears in the distance
:  Footsteps running, a door opening and closing, footsteps running upstairs, a door opening and slamming
: 169
- '  - Ben leans with his back against the closed door, breathing heavily
: 170
-  - Ben following and watching Elaine
: 171
- Ben is sitting at a table by the window through which we can see the street
He is drinking a beer
Other tables are filled with students having animated discussions
Ben starts to pour some beer from the bottle into the glass
He stops as he sees something through the window
He leans forward
Elaine comes out of a bookstore across the street
She crosses the street and moves to a bus stop
He stands, fumbles in his pocket for money, puts a dollar on the table and rushes out
172
- Ben comes out of the door just as Elaine gets into a bus and the doors close behind her
The bus starts off
Ben runs after it
The bus gets to the next corner and stops for a red light
Ben catches up with it, runs to the front door and knocks on the door
The door opens and he climbs in
173 174
1 -  - She is seated next to an   by the window immediately in front of the rear exit door
She keeps looking out the window, almost holding her breath as she hears: ' (getting closer as he moves past people toward her) Excuse me - 'm sorry - wonder if  could get by - excuse me - There is a pause and then, immediately behind her: ' (cheerfully) Well - how about this for a coincidence
175 Ben's face is right behind Elaine, between her and the older lady sitting next to her
Ben is standing on the steps to the rear exit door
Elaine continues to look out the window
(leaning in a little) was wondering where you were headed
Elaine doesn't answer
The lady sitting next to Elaine takes a look at her, turns around and looks at Ben, then looks at Elaine again
'm meeting someone
Ah
Where
She doesn't answer
Where are you meeting this person
At the Zoo
The Zoo
They have a pretty good one here, do they
've never been to it
Oh
Well,  haven't either might just ride out there with you
Hold on them riding
: 176
- Ben and Elaine are walking along in front of one of the outside animal cages
Ben is walking a step or two behind Elaine
He is darting glances to the right and left
Is that him over there
No
Where did he say he was going to meet you
thought he said by the monkey house
Oh
She stops
Ben stops
Benjamin -  would like to know what you're doing here
Here
In Berkelely
Yes
Well,  have this very pleasant room on Carter Street - and 've been getting to some classes - But you're not enrolled
No
just sit in
They don't seem to mind
They've been very congenial about it
She looks at him and starts to shake her head
Benjamin - you're -  don't know what to say - you're -- Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it
- really incredible - Here he comes
What
've got a real feeling that this is the fellow
Elaine looks
good-looking young man is striding briskly toward them
It is
(waving) Elaine
He certainly is a good walker
Carl strides up to them
He takes the pipe out of his mouth and puts it in his pocket
He reaches out and takes Elaine's hands
Am  late
'm sorry
We thought you said by the monkey house
Carl frowns and looks up over Elaine's shoulder at Ben
Ben smiles
This is Benjamin Braddock
Carl Smith
Benjamin rode here with me on the bus
Glad to meet you, Ben
Ben steps forward and grasps Carl's hand
Great meeting you, Carl
Carl steps back and puts an arm around Elaine's shoulder
The three of them look at each other for a moment
Swell seeing you
Have a good time
Ben turns and starts walking back the way he came
Carl and Elaine turn and go in the opposite direction
Ben stops after a few steps and walks over to one of the cages
He grips the rail with his hand and looks back at: 177	 - Walking away, his arm over her shoulder, his other hand gesturing with the pipe in it as he talks
178	 - As he watches them go
His artificial smile disappears
The agony is such that he has to steady himself with his hand on the rail
He turns his face away, toward the cage
There is an animal in it, staring at Ben
They look at each other
There is a box - an automatic device with a recorded desciption of the animal - that begins to deliver its
: 179
- '  - Ben is standing by the window, looking out
180
-  - - Elaine is walking up the street toward the rooming house
181
- '  -  -  - He jumps to the other side of the window and peers out carefully
182
-  -  -  - Elaine turns in and disappears into the rooming house front door below
183
- '    -  - He runs to the bed and puts the covers back into place
He goes to the window sill, picks up an empty beer can, crosses to the bureau, opens a bureau drawer
He crosses to the wastepaper basket under the sink, bends down and takes a newspaper out of it
He crosses to the chair and sits down
He holds the newspaper in front of him
It is hopelessly crumpled
He gets up, crosses to the bureau, opens a drawer and takes out a traveling iron
He kneels down, puts the newspaper on the floor and tires to straighten it out with the iron
There is a  on the door
He rises, puts the iron back in the drawer as quietly and quickly as he can, then back to the chair, sits down and holds the newspaper on his lap
Come in
There is another
Ben crosses to the door and opens it
Elaine is standing in the hall
want to ask you a question
Come in
No
want to know why you're here in Berkeley
Because -  am
Is it because 'm here
What do you think
think it is
Ben nods
said  think it is
All right then
Yes
Well,  want you to leave
Elaine -  love you
(looking down) How could you do that, Benjamin
Ben moves in behind her and puts his hand on her arm
Do you just hate everything
How could you possibly rape my
What
don't understand - Did you say rape her
- how you - how anyone - could do a thing like that
What did she say
(holding his arm) Let me go
You've got to tell me what she said
He touches her hair
Why
Because it isn't true
don't feel well
Ben pushes her down softly onto the bed
He kneels along side her
Tell me
Ben sits next to her and puts his hand on her shoulder
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend
You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night
Then what
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her
Elaine - that is not what happened
She puts her hands on his shoulder
Please let me go
All right - but listen to me
What happened was there was this party at my parents drove your mother home - then we went upstairs to see your portrait - Elaine tightens her arms around his neck
Don't tell me - - and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off - and - Benjamin - this is my mother
- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -  mean really naked - Ben is almost lying on top of her
Elaine screams - a long, loud scream

He stands, looking into the empty suitcase
Can  just sit here while you're packing
If you want
Elaine sits in the chair
She watches him as he goes to the bureau, takes some shirts from a drawer and puts them in the suitcase, then goes back to the bureau

No

- Ben is seated across a study table from Elaine
There are many other students scattered around the room
How did he do it
Did he get down on his knees
He didn't get down on his knees,  hope
No, Benjamin
Well, what did he say
'm curious
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team
Oh no
He said that

She starts to move away
It wasn't in his car, was it

He opens the door to his room and steps in
The room is dark
The figure of a  is silhouetted against the window
Ben freezes just inside the door
There is a long pause
(clearing his throat) Do you want - do you want to try and tell me why you did it
Mr
Robinson
Do you have a special grudge against me
Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me
No, it's not -- Is there something 've said that's caused this contempt
Or is it just the things  stand for that you despise
It was nothing to do with you, sir
Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me
Ben takes a step forward
Now look - please - Ben,  think we're two civilized human beings
Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other
am not threatening you
Do you want to unclench your fists, please
Thank you
can see in the dark, you know
've been here quite a while
am trying to tell you  have no personal feelings about you, Mr
Robinson
am trying to tell you  do not resent you
You don't respect me terribly much either, do you
No,  don't
Well,  don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben
do think you should know the consequences of what you've done
do think you should know that my wife and  are getting a divorce soon
But why
Why
It shouldn't make any difference what happened
That's quite a statement
Listen to me
We got - we got into bed with each other
But it was nothing
It was nothing at all
We might - we might just as well have been shaking hands
Shaking hands
Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it
You miss the point
Don't shout at me, Ben
The point is -  don't love your wife
love your daughter, sir
Well - 'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine  feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you - think 've talked about this enough
don't know how far can go, Ben
don't know if can prosecute or not, but think maybe  can
In the light of what's happened  think maybe can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again
have seen Elaine and  have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure
Mr
Robinson climbs across the bed to get to the door
Ben takes a step toward him
Stay away from me, Ben
Mr
Robinson stands at the door
don't want to mince words with you
As far as Elaine's concerned you're to get her out of your filthy mind right now
Is that perfectly clear ro you
That's all, Ben
You'll pardon me if don't shake hands with you
Mr
Robinson opens the door and starts into the hall

Robinson turns back from the hall
