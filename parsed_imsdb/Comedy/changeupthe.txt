- Written by Jon Lucas & Scott Moore July 31, 2009 : Then we hear a baby
Then a second baby joins in, even more shrill than the first
Finally, we hear the worst two words a parent can ever hear: '  (
) Your turn
'  (
) Fuck
-- , 30, bleary-eyed father of three, shuffles through his well-appointed suburban home, passing a grandfather clock reading 3:45
He stumbles over a -- it , and Dave sleepily mumbles: Sorry Hank
-- His eyes half-open, Dave changes the diaper of his very cute, very insane nine month old daughter, , who screams and pitches about her changing table
'-- Honey, that's not-- Maybe if you-- She snatches a tin of baby powder and swings it about like a mace, knocking over the diaper caddy, the wipes, the lotion -- and dispersing a cloud of white powder all over the nursery
Blinded and , Dave manages to stay on point and change the diaper like Van Damme at the end of Bloodsport
(') Can't-see
must
persevere
He finishes changing Sarah, places her back in her crib, then picks up Sarah's twin brother, , from his crib -- which is good because he's been  his head against the wall
(') Come on, buddy, we've talked about the head thing-- Dave places Peter on the changing table and opens his diaper
It's only wet, and Dave, pleasantly relieved, reaches for a fresh diaper
2
Only Sarah has knocked the caddy all the way down the changing table
Holding down Peter with his left hand, Dave fully extends, leaning waaay over, reaching for the diaper caddy
It's just out of reach
he somehow stretches further
It's only when Dave glances back that he realizes that his head is now perfectly lined up with his son's
(') Oh no
' - with mustardy projectile stool, blasting Dave in the eyes, nose and open mouth
Dave remains frozen, excrement dripping down his face -- but, like a true dad, he does not let go of his squirming child
-- Dave staggers down the hall, his hair white with baby powder, his face covered in poo, and a twin in each arm into each of his ears
He soldiers on, stoic, an unsung hero in his time
-- Juggling the twins in his arms, Dave wipes his face off with paper towels and prepares two baby bottles -- nipples, filters, defrosted breastmilk -- while the babies take turns kicking him in the balls and
Please, sweetheart, not my-- Honey, Daddy needs those-- -- Dave sits on his couch and positions the screaming, squirming twins across his lap in an  pattern, plunks the bottles into their mouths -- and instantly the twins settle down and slurp away like perfect little angels
Dave exhales
Whew
Then he reaches for the remote control and turns on the
An old rerun of Magnum,
is playing
Dave watches, exhausted and expressionless

, Tom Selleck, resplendent in mustache, corduroy short shorts, and Hawaiian shirt, teaches a nubile - in a scandalous bikini how to snorkel in beautiful sun-drenched Waikiki
They're laughing and having a blast
Dave watches, detached
Then his face starts to change
,
Is this the life you always dreamed of
Dave shakes his head, no, despair in his eyes
, the co-ed nods, yes, and hungrily kisses Magnum
Dave watches on with genuine existential longing
and soon a tear falls from his eye
And then another
Take me with you Magnum
Before long Dave is  like a schoolgirl
(') Please take me with you
: '  (

) How are the kids
(
0
) Terrific
Just terrific
We are now , ,  --   -- Dave, in a conservative suit and clutching a massive coffee, hurries down the hall with   , 50's, stiff, humorless  partner of this white shoe law firm
Children are such a joy
Aren't they
Yes
Always
(to passing ) Good morning, Rebecca
Any word on the Amalgamated merger
4
All but signed
And just in time for your partner review no less
() Really
hadn't noticed
look forward to having your antic sense of humor in the partners' suite, Lockwood
It can get a touch dry up there
Thank you, sir
(re: Dave's necktie knot) But a double windsor
Come on, son, this isn't the dog track
No sir, absolutely not
So sorry
Dave quickly undoes his tie as Flemming turns down a hallway
McARDLE, cute young paralegal, falls into step with Dave, stymieing laughter
Really
The dog track
Last week he told me my shoes were "dangerously Italian
" (laughing, handing him docs) Amalgamated signing statements
Thanks, Sabrina
Have a good one
She smiles and breezes back down the hallway
Dave stops and watches her go, lust in his eyes
5
Then he hears --
He looks over at his mean old secretary, , 71, sitting at her desk
For shame, Mr
Lockwood
For shame
You are a married man
have no idea what you're talking about, Gladys
Reddening, he snatches a huge pile of pink message slips and hurries towards his office
She follows him, scolding: With children
Yes, thank you,  almost forgot about them for like two seconds
'  -- Dave enters his modest office; his phone is
The only thing that harlot needs to put in her mouth is a sandwich
Gladys, 'm a grown man, okay
He angrily punches "" on his  phone as he reties his tie with a more traditional knot
(') Lockwood
shrill, horribly impersonated British accent fills Dave's office -- as well as all of the surrounding offices
, '   --
As Gladys and various - turn, shocked, Dave quickly fumbles for the receiver and takes the call off speaker
Jesus, Mitch, 'm at work-- 6
' Dude, how stoned are you
: , 30, shirtless, Dodgers hat backwards, sitting on a futon in his sparse white apartment, smoking a bong shaped like a shotgun
Beat
He drops the horrible accent: 'm pretty stoned
Come on, it's 10 in the morning
Dude, guess what
Great news
What
found a futon on the street
That is great news
sort of had to fight a bum for it -- is that bad
Kind of
Is there a reason you're calling or--
Are you gonna bitch out on tonight
You are, aren't you
Dave, half-listening, sits at his desk and answers emails
(') Dodgers-Giants, dude
We haven't missed one of these in like 20 years
Don't be a vajeen
Dude, 'm coming-- 7
You always do this
You never make time for your friends anymore and 'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but people are starting to talk
Feelings are getting hurt
Really
Whose feelings
Not mine, because, like a samurai, have trained myself to feel nothing except revenge and honor, but other people -- nameless, other, more sensitive people -- are hurt, and they think you need to treasure your friendships a little bit more
(exhaling massive bong rip) How concerned should  be that my new futon smells like death
(distracted, typing) Look, just, what time are you picking me up tonight
If you bail  will rape you
Dude,  get it, 'm coming-- In your eye
will eye-rape you
-- Just then there's a knock on Mitch's apartment door
(
0
) Mitch
Shit
Mitch starts waving away the pot smoke
(') Gotta go, pick you up at six--
8
as he quickly clicks off his iPhone, jams his bong under the futon, opens the window, and tries to blow the pot smoke out of his apartment with quick little
(') One sec, Dad
The smoke clears and Mitch jogs to the door and opens it to reveal his father, ,
, 60's, friendly, in a suit, holding a pile of mail
,
Hey, buddy
Your mailbox was spilling over
Oh thanks,  always forget
They hug, and Mitch takes the mail and, without looking at it, chucks it onto a      in the corner
,
Were you smoking marijuana in here
No
Honestly, it's my new futon, it smells like illegal drugs
,
We've talked about this, Mitch
Smoke your grass on the balcony, okay
It's just hard for me to tell the other tenants they can't smoke in their units when my own son is blazing away in his, you know
You got it, Dad
,
Oh hey,  saw your commercial on channel 9 again last night
Which one
"Give Gonorrhea The Boot" or "Samir's Pet Shack Our Low Low Prices Are Snake-sational
" ,
Samir's Pet Shack
It's just a shame you can't see your face in that giant ape costume
9
Actually, the real shame is that Samir paid me in fucking organic bird seed, but whatever
He glares at several crates of   by the door
,
Well, your mother would've liked it
She always loved animals
( ) Anyway
was just in the neighborhood, wanted to check in
How you doing, cash-wise
'm a little tight, actually, Pops
Especially vis a vis, you know, the whole bird seed situation
,
Five hundred
Can you make it a grand
Mitch's dad smiles to hide his disappointment and hands his 30-year-old son a roll of hundred dollar bills
,
You thought any more about coming to work for me
Yeeeah
'm not really sure 'm a "work" guy, you know what  mean
Plus, 've been getting a ton of auditions recently, so
,
Okay, well, my door is always open
Thanks, pop
Bones
Mitch, Sr
smiles and awkwardly bumps his son's fist
(') Batting cages next weekend
,
Great
See you then
10
Mitch, Sr
smiles sadly and exits
Mitch  and reaches for his bong, having noticed none of his father's distress
: '  --  -- of Dave's beautiful colonial home
Huge oak trees shade the lush front lawn
New Audi and  station wagons sit in the driveway
We hear
'  --  -- The twins sit in the bath, motionless, anticipatory
(

) - Dave rises up from beside the tub, arms upraised, soap suds covering his face
The twins  and , ecstatic
Dave tries not to laugh, but he's having too much fun
Behind Dave, his sweet daughter , 5, sits on the closed toilet lid in a ballet tutu, reading her
Daddy daddy, which is your favorite butterfly, the Southern Monarch or the Many-Spotted Skipperling
Dave glances at the book as he washes the twins
Oh, 'm a Many-Spotted Skipperling man all the way
The Southern Monarch is just a glorified moth
( ) Yes
tend to agree
Dave smiles
Then his handsome wife , 30's, blows into the bathroom in a suit and starts removing her makeup
What a day
Dr
Klein lost the twins immunization record, the wireless went down, and Cara got bullied in ballet class again
11
Nicolette Peters keeps knocking me over during the battement glisse
Oh, 'm sorry, sugar-bug
Dave looks genuinely concerned
Cara just shrugs and keeps reading her butterfly book
Jamie whispers to him: We need to remind her to keep striving for verbal resolution
Right, of course
Jamie finally notices Dave's foam-covered face, and softens
And how was your day, monster man
Before Dave can answer, the doorbell rings, -
They exchange the weary smile of parents who never see each other
(') He's early
Of course he's early
All he does all day is eat hummus and masturbate
: to reveal  in shades, fedora, and a Dodgers jersey
Jamie, holding Cara, lets him in
Whatup bitches
() Really
He takes Cara and playfully -- and incredibly recklessly -- flips her in the air
How's my favorite ballerina
12
'm good
Are you coming to my recital on Thursday
Oh no, honey, the only style of dancing  support is exotic
He plunks her on the floor and blows into ' replete with granite counter tops, built-in appliances, fresh flowers, and bowls teeming with fruit
Mitch beelines for the Subzero fridge and opens it: it's stocked
His eyes alight
Jesus Christ you could feed Africa with this fridge
As Jamie starts prepping a salad across the kitchen, Mitch raids the fridge, packing his cargo pants with kid's snacks, bagels, yogurts, juice boxes, everything
(') These leftovers from Morton's
Oh no, hon, those are super old-- Too late -- Mitch is already eating the very old steak
Chimichurri
score
As Mitch chews, he eyes Jamie chopping vegetables
(') You look hot by the way, Jame
Jamie laughs but clearly doesn't mind the flirtation
Thanks
sort of
No really
never would've guessed twins
Annnd that's probably enough-- 13
Is Dave still meeting your needs sexually
Jamie just laughs, shaking her head, unbelievable
(') Oh, did  tell you  ran into Miss Hickam last week at Starbucks
Our old kindergarten teacher
Yeah
She always liked Dave better than me
Honey, everyone likes Dave better than you
Fair enough
Anyway,  tried to get her number, but she goes " don't date former students," so  go, "great, do you fuck former students
" and then she calls me a "potty-mouth degenerate" and runs out without her coffee
So  got a free venti macchiato, which is cool- (
) Bathed, changed and in their Pis
Mitch turns to see Dave in khakis and a buttondown, entering the kitchen with the freshly bathed twins
Mitch grins: Awww
Come to Uncle Mitch
Dave hands the twins to Mitch, and they , impishly cute
(') Oh my God, they smell like heaven had sex with a dryer sheet
(loudly to babies) ' (they just ) Why can't they talk yet
Are they retarded or something
14
() What
No
They're fine
Really
The one on the left looks a little downsy
( ) Kidding
Kidding
(aside, to Dave) little bit though, right
Ignoring him, Dave fastens the twins into their Bouncy Seats
'll be back right after the game, okay, Pumpkin
Whenever
Have fun
See you, Jame
Always a pleasure, Mitch
Mitch steals   and some  as he exits
: on the bottle cap-opener mounted on Mitch's dashboard
'  -- Mitch offers Dave one of (his own) beers as they speed along in his Fiero
Dave is reluctant
Yeah, 'm good
Really
You're going to make me drink alone
Yeah, well, you're driving, so
Mitch shrugs and slides the spare beer into his chest pocket
15
Oh, dude: great news
You found another futon
That's awesome, because 'm made of emotional Teflon and words can't hurt me anymore
No:  auditioned for a major movie role yesterday
Nice
What movie
It's called Busted Dreams 4
It's about a renegade coroner who reads minds named Jake Action
It's like a sexy Mentalist
Sounds cool
Yeah,  read for the part of Steve Action, Jake's troubled younger brother with a secret, and fucking killed it
cried like five times during the audition and it's a fucking action movie
Plus 'm the spitting image of the dude who plays Jake Action, so
hope you get it, man
Yeah, it could be my Raging Bull
Plus 'd get to kill a lot of women, which is cool
(offering him a joint) Hotbox
No, man,  got a big day tomorrow, can't get wasted tonight
: Mitch and Dave, shit-faced, shake off their shots, ---
16
-- The guys sit in this crowded sports bar, watching the Dodgers game on a huge
When   strikes out to win the game, the guys drunkenly slap five: Change-up -- fuck he's good
He's no Fernando
Of course not
Fernando is like The Highlander
There can be only one
(toasting his beer) ----
They sloppily drink -- when Dave suddenly remembers: So finish your story
The girl calls you up
Right
So she calls me up, it's like 3 in the morning-- What's her name
Tatiana
Incredible
What's her last name
Mitch just looks at him
17
Tatiana Calls-Me-At-3-In-The- Morning-And-Wants-To-Fuck-stein, what the fuck, who cares
Is she hot
She is, right
Oh my God  already have a boner
() Maybe we should do this later
Keep going
need these stories, man
They're all  have
Mitch registers the desperation in his married friend's eyes
Okay, well, you're in luck, because Tatiana is stupid fucking hot
Beautiful face, legs a mile long, perfect ass, blonde hair, and huuuge boobs
Oh my God how big
Double
Oh my God she sounds like Sabrina
Who's Sabrina
This hot paralegal in my office
Is she on your Cancer List
What's a Cancer List
Don't all married dudes have a Cancer List
No
Like the first three chicks you would bang if your wife suddenly died of cancer
18
That's sick, man
Jamie is the mother of my children
() But yes, if  had a Cancer List, Sabrina would be the first on it
Who's number two
Fergie--
Just finish your story, man
'm dying over here
Fine
So Tatiana's packing double 's, which means like 20 plus pounds of breastmeat -- yeah, it's almost too much for one man to handle
Thank God 'm the son of a butcher and have strong hands and wrists
Anyway, she walks in wearing this tight black dress, and you know what she says to me
Dave shakes his head, on the edge of his bar stool
(') Nothing
Because all Tatiana wants to do at 3 in the morning is fucky fucky rubber ducky
Dave drunkenly slaps him ten, barely making hand-contact
(') And look, 'm not one to kiss and tell
(downing another shot) but this chick is insatiable
She wants it in every position: Missionary, wheelbarrow, Reverse Wheelbarrow, Assassin-- don't even know what those are
No one does
It gets so intense that my nose starts bleeding
Yeah, so 'm bleeding all over this chick and she's fucking digging it
() 19
(') It's like some weird Dracula Anne Rice shit, and 'm fading in and out of consciousness, and then, when it's all over, she turns to me and goes: "Tuesday night 'm coming back and we're really going to fuck
" Dave just stares at him, glassy-eyed, drunk, emotional
That is maybe the single greatest story 've ever heard in my life
Ah, it's not always like that
don't know why
don't know why 've always been in such a rush, you know
() do you mean
You remember me in high school, was always so focussed on getting into a good college, then when got to college,  was so focussed on getting into a good law school, then in law school  was just trying to land a job at a good firm, then Jamie and  got married and we had Cara right away--  just feel like and  missed out on all the fun stuff, you know
The sex, the drugs, the bad choices, and now it's too late
blew it
pissed away my 20's, and now 'm staring down the barrel a seriously boring life
Oh come on, Jamie is hot
No,  know-- really want to have sex with her
20
Wait, what
And your kids are adorable
They're like fun little puppies that talk
The bill comes
Dave pulls out a wad of cash, throws it on the table, and stumbles for the door
Mitch lifts one of Dave's twenties off the table and follows him out
-- They stumble down the dark Hollywood street together
Don't get me wrong,  love my kids, do,  would take a bullet for them, but
remember that heroin addict you dated
Tara
Or Rena
Or Rachel
Jesus, how many heroin addicts have you dated
It's a national scourge, dude
Anyway
Having kids is like dating a heroin addict, only instead of dating them, they move into your house for 18 years
They're laughing one second and crying the next and then they're trying to kill themselves in your bathroom for no reason
They're mean and selfish and they burn through all your money and they steal your shit and they break everything and they stay up all night and they listen to really shitty music and the dirty secret is, no one actually likes kids
Oh come on, you don't mean that-- 21
No
It's true
Everyone pretends to like kids because if you don't you look like a huge dick
It's like Drew Barrymore or jazz
No one actually likes them, but if you say that out loud, everybody hates you
Dude,  love Drew Barrymore -- have you seen Boys on the Side
They weave across a  , stumbling for Mitch's car
'm just saying: don't fuck up your life like  did, okay
What are you talking about
You've got it all
You've got a huge house full of food and furniture -- shit, your  is bigger than my car
You have a great job, you make a shit- ton of money, and people respect you, man
My last job involved an ape costume -- do you know what that does to a man
Dave waves him off, not really hearing him
But Mitch is sincere, heartfelt: (') Plus you've got a hot, extremely fuckable wife who cooks and cleans and takes care of all your needs
It's like having a really hot mom who you can also have sex with
Wait, what--
Also you're never lonely, you always have someone to talk to about your day, plus you get to do all the fun gay couple stuff like go to wine country
You think single guys can go to wine country
No way
They won't even let us in
You're living the dream, dude
What more do you want
22
Tatiana
want Tatiana
want sex with strange new women and maybe also with Sabrina if she's single and  want to wake up at noon and smoke weed all afternoon and  want to not think about the needs of four other people 24 hours a day and  want to start reading a novel and actually finish it and  want to take a solid shit because 'm not constantly stressed out and want to learn how to rollerblade and also  really want to pee
Yeah, me too
They look around the plaza, and their eyes land on the in the middle; a   sits atop it
(') Fountain
Bingo
They stumble over to the fountain, unzip their pants, and, leaning on each other, begin peeing into it
Mitch glances up at the
She scowls down at them
This chick does not look happy
Maybe she has three kids and a job she hates
Dude, enough already
'm just saying
envy your life
And that's what's so fucked, because  envy yours
Yeah you don't-- do
23
No,  do--
wish  had your life
wish  had your life
They're about to say "jinx" when-- thunder clap  and the electrical grid starts shutting down, neighborhood by neighborhood
Soon the entire city is
Dave and Mitch freeze, terrified, hugging
and peeing
Ummmmm
Then all the lights in the city flicker back to life
-Rolling blackout
guess
They continue peeing, a little freaked out
You really have nice flow by the way
Very thick and confident
Thank you
Yours is very steamy
Thank you
My urologist says  run a little warm
Eventually they both finish, tuck in, and zip up
Beat
(') You good to drive
Now  am
24
As they stumble off towards Mitch's Fiero,   the statue of Metis, the shape-shifting Greek Goddess of Wisdom
It almost looks like she's smiling
: '  -- It's a beautiful sunny Los Angeles morning
The silhouette of a body lies in Dave's bed,  away
Then we hear followed by what is unequivocally Mitch's patter -- and his - : Whose fucking baby is that
hand emerges and fumbles on the night stand
(') And where the fuck is my bong
He groggily rises from the sheets -- only it's not Mitch
It's Dave
His body, his face, everything
Yup, you got it: the single auy and the married guy have switched bodies
We will refer to them by their "brain names," thus while this hungover dude definitely looks like Dave, inside he's Mitch, so that's what we'll call him
The actors, of course, will remain in their bodies
Mitch doesn't know any of this yet
(') Why are there so many fucking pillows
He rolls over to see Jamie, sitting up in bed, pulling her breasts out of her tank top, getting ready to nurse the twins
Mitch launches out of bed, suddenly very awake
(') ,
She starts breast-feeding the babies, confused
What
What's your problem
Mitch shields his eyes with his hands, shocked and disgusted
25
Oh my god that is so gross
Put your tits away
This isn't Europe
What are you talking about
Mitch finally notices he's in '
Wait: why am  in
Did  sleep here last night
Um, yeah
Did we
Panicked, he thrusts his fist like, have sex
Are you insane
So why the hell did  wake up in your bed
Are you still drunk
Look, just, where's Dave
What
Where's fucking Dave
Dave is right here
You're Dave
He turns and sees himself in the mirror
Freezes
He is Dave
Oh my God
Oh my God
He slowly touches his new face
26
(') 'm a fucking tool
: '  -- body lies sprawled on Mitch's futon, out cold on the door shatters the silence
(
) The body sits up, groggy and confused -- it is, of course, Dave in Mitch's body
While he looks like Mitch, he moves, talks, and even shuffles to the door exactly like Dave
Mitch
(
) Fucking open the fucking door
Dave stops, noticing that he's in Mitch's empty apartment
Why am  in your sad apartment-- (
) The door, dude
Open the door
Fine, Jesus, relax-- Dave opens the door to see himself standing there
(') What the fuck is this
Dave backpedals, terrified, as Mitch blows inside, furious
knew it
( ) Who the hell are you
And why do you look like me
Mitch angles Dave over to the mirror on the otherwise barren wall-and Dave sees he's in Mitch's body
Stunned, he slowly touches his new face
his new hair
his new body
27
(') Oh my God
know, dude
'm a fucking loser
Wait, what
Dave spins, completely awake now: How the fuck did this happen
How should  know
Has this ever happened to you before
What, switching bodies with another human being
Oh yeah, this shit happens to me like twice a week
Well
don't want to be you
Oh, you don't want to be me
No, no, no:  don't want to be you
What's that supposed to mean
Look, let's just
think
How could this have possibly happened
They pace about the apartment, trying to think
Then: Bingo
Got it
We're dreaming
Dave grabs Mitch's nipple and twists it hard
(') Ow ow ow, fuck
Not dreaming
28
First of all, you're a penis
Second of all-- Wait, what'd you just say
called you a penis and-- (running out the door) Come on
: '    -- Dave speeds through morning traffic in his Audi station wagon, leaning on the
Mitch sits shotgun, confused
Remember last night when we peed into that fountain
As we peed, we wished we had each other's lives
() Oh fuck
Our wishes must've
somehow
come true
thought wishes came true when you threw a coin into a fountain
Well apparently urine works too
That's bullshit
would've wished for something way cooler
-- Unable to find a parking spot, Mitch and Dave double-park on Hollywood Boulevard, hop out, and sprint for the plaza
What are we gonna do when we get to the fountain
29
We're gonna hug each other and pee into the fountain and wish our lives back
That might sound really gay
Both men race around the corner onto the plaza and stop cold: is cleaning up the site where it once sat
Mitch and Dave are blown away
They hurry up to the crew
Excuse me
Where is the fountain
It's getting restored
Where did you take it
don't know, chief, 'm not the fountain spokesman, 'm just the guy that fills the fucking hole
Who could tell us where it is
Maybe the district manager
: "   " District Manager   sits behind her desk in her bland office, her face the model of bureaucratic ennui
It's not in the computer
Opposite her, Dave and Mitch pull their hair out, insane
30
Well of course it's not--
When will it be in the computer
You could try calling tomorrow
Tomorrow
We can't wait until tomorrow, Carla
How can you lose a fountain
(beat, deadpan) It's not in the computer
Mitch  for Carla, but Dave grabs him and wrestles him out of the office
--
We'll call you tomorrow
Thank you
-- Dave and Mitch exit the Department of Parks building and pace on the sunny sidewalk, their hands on their heads, stunned
This is so fucked
We should just go home and lock the -- Mitch's phone rings in Dave's pocket
Dave hesitates, then answers it, fruitlessly trying to sound like Mitch: (') This is fucking Mitch
don't talk like that, dude-- Okay
Okay
Great
Thank you
31
Dave clicks off
Who was that
Marty Green, the producer of Busted Dreams 4
Apparently the guy they cast for Steve Action 'd last night, and the back-up actor got deported, so, alphabetically, you're the next actor on the list
You got the part, man
Mitch covers his mouth like he just won American Idol
Oh my God
Oh my God
Dreams really do come true--
() Wait, no, this sucks
'm stuck in your fat dad-body
can't play Steve Action looking like this
(remembering, stunned) Oh my God: and 've got my closing today
What, is that like a big deal
big--
Yeah
Whether or not make partner is riding on this
So what the hell are we gonna do
Then Mitch looks at Dave
No
No
We can't just be each other for a day, Mitch
You have no idea how to be a lawyer
Dude, 'm an actor, a human chameleon,  can do lawyer in my fucking sleep
It's you 'm worried about: you can't act for shit
32
First of all, it's Busted Dreams 4, okay
It's not The Reader
Second of all, 'm a , 've spent my entire life acting happy and no one has ever questioned my performance, okay
They look at each other, cooling off a bit
(') Are
Are we actually considering doing this
mean, we have to
right
Both men look highly anxious
Dave glances at the time
All right, well, my meeting starts in 45 minutes
You need to race home, get dressed, then go to my office and find my secretary Gladys- She sounds hot, is she hot
No
Get the merger docs from Gladys and take them to the conference room
All the partners will be there so do not speak to anyone
Really
Because  can vamp-- No vamping
And once the meeting starts, you will continue to say nothing
When a partner asks you for the merger documents, you will silently hand them over, okay
Dude,  get it
Play it big, but maintain my reality-- 33
No
Play it small
Really small
've spent the last nine months banging out the terms of this deal, all you have to do is hand over the documents
That's it
Dude, that's easy as fuck
Okay, for me, go home, put on some cool clothes, and get to set -- all the info is on my phone
Once you're there, go to Hair & Makeup and memorize your lines and try not to be a total douche to everyone, okay
This is the film industry
Everyone is really cool
They look at each other, very doubtful that this will work
(') 'm trusting you, dude
'm trusting you, too
Power hug
They hug tight then release
Oh hey, you also need to pick up Cara from ballet at 4, okay
(heads for the car) 'm so fucking all over that shit
Off of Dave's deeply unsettled look, we : , ,  --   -- Mitch blows into Dave's stodgy law firm looking like a lawyer -- from a Ralph Lauren ad: he sports a pink buttondown, red suspenders, a blue crested blazer, khakis, no socks, black and white wingtips, and slicked-back hair
He also affects a preposterous patrician accent like John Kerry or any white guy on a black sitcom
34
, His co-workers look at him like he's fucking nuts
Falling into step with him is Gladys, his mean old secretary
What in God's name are you wearing
Holy dick, are you Gladys
You're a lynx
-What is a lynx
white-haired cougar
You really should dress sexier, though
The whole angry prison nurse thing is a huge mistake
Gladys  and jams some documents into his hands
Here are your merger documents
Good day to you
She storms off
Mitch calls after her: Hey, where's my meeting at
She angrily points at a conference room as she stalks off
-- The conference room is full of  from and  , as well as several well-heeled
They chat amiably until in his ridiculous outfit
The room goes silent, but Mitch's confidence remains sky-high: What up, white people
Republican Party in the house, am  right
Come on, let's get started
35
Everyone looks a bit confused by this Nobody telling them what to do, but nonetheless, they begin taking their seats
Mitch goes around, introducing himself
(') Dave Lockwood, thanks for coming
Dave Lockwood,  did all the work
Dave Lockwood-san, konichi-wa
(to the room) Anyone need anything
Mimosa, spicy tuna roll
No
We're good
All right, guys, take it away
Mitch takes one of the last open seats -- at the head of the conference table
It's clearly in his boss's seat
Flemming Steel  hovers awkwardly
Yes, well, thank you, Dave
(clearing his throat) We are gathered here today to codify the marriage of two bold industry leaders, Kinkabe Technologies and Amalgamated Industries
Mitch starts
Others
hesitantly
join in
Fuck yeah
Amalgamated Industries
Finally, even Flemming claps as well, uncomfortable
-Before we sign on the proverbial bottom line, are there any outstanding questions or concerns that we might address
Ask now or forever hold your peace
Pleasant  in the room
Then the Japanese-American of Kinkabe Technologies,  , 60's, raises his hand
We just wanted to make sure that --- ratios haven't changed given the recent market fluctuations
Everyone turns to Mitch
Who's not listening
He's drawing pictures of boobs on a yellow legal pad
36
Dave
Mitch looks up, sees everyone looking at him
Right, my bad-- Thinking that's his cue, he slides Flemming the documents
No, Dave
Mr
Kinkabe had a question about the  ratios
Deer in headlights
Okay
Well
How are they
-Good
Good
Bad
Bad
They're fucking terrible
Dave
Look, everything's cool, let's just sign this fucking thing and go party
We're all rich, who cares
Mr
Kinkabe angrily jabs his finger at the incredibly short of Amalgamated Industries,  , 60's
knew it
You were never serious about this merger
Spare me, Ken, you were just trying to inflate your share price
This merger is over
will see you in court
37
Not if we see you first, you prick
The execs furiously race out of the conference room, all of them reaching for their cell phones
War has been declared
The lawyers hurry after the clients, fruitlessly trying to coax them back to the table
Mitch frowns, oo, and tiptoes for the exit
until Flemming Steel  grabs his arm, furious
Right now you need to give me one reason not to fire you
Mitch stammers, oh shit
Relax, dude
this-this is all part of my master plan
It is
Yes
Check it out: if we drag this out
we make more money, right
Don't we
Of course we do
And then we can bill the fuck out of them
Some of them don't even speak-ah the engrish so goo, you know what 'm saying
That's your plan
Yes
Is it
It's not a very good plan, is it
Son, what you've just said to me is highly illegal
You could go to jail for a very long time just for suggesting it
() We're lawyers
We're above the law
38
must say, 've never seen this side of you before, Lockwood always thought you were on the straight and narrow
Fuck that, ese
'm straight up gangster all the way through
Flemming eyes him, determining his fate
Mitch can't breathe
Fine, 'll roll the dice with you But if word of this gets out, will throw you under the bus so darn fast you won't know what hit you
Now go put on some proper clothes
You look like Joe Pesci
Flemming Steel  hurries off
Mitch exhales, holy shit
: --   -- Dave nervously pulls up to a   in the Fiero, reading the address off his iPhone
Several crew trucks are parked out front, and 's with headsets loiter about
Dave gets out wearing an ironed buttondown shirt tucked into khakis
He self-consciously untucks half his shirt, trying to look "cooler," as he approaches a nearby
Yo, Mitch Planko is here
Where the fuck is Hair & Makeup
() Um, trailer 3
That's so real
Dave stiffly walks off as the
eyes him, weirded out
&   -- Dave, now in leather pants, the top four buttons of his shirt undone, sits in the makeup chair, getting his hair styled
He studies the script, confused
Then a
hurries in
39
'm here to take you to set
Is there anything  can get you
Vitamin water, Pelegrino
No thanks
Hey, what does it mean when it says
, or
Titty Shot and Bouncing Titty Shot
( ) Steve Action is coming to set
Dave, alarmed, follows the
out and They've taken over this valley ranch house; cables, lights and sound equipment run everywhere
Wait
-what kind of movie is this
It's a lorno
-'m not familiar with that genre
Lorno
Light porno
Tits & shadows
You ever hear of Skinemax
Oh no
They arrive in bedecked with cameras, grip equipment -- and thousands of lit candles
The
unbuttons Dave's shirt even further and starts smearing his chest and face with Crisco oil
Just then, the fat balding director,  -- just Valtan -- from some ethnically cleansed Balkan state, 50's, blows in
More oil
Make him shiny like fish
40
Excuse me, are you in charge here
think there's been some sort of -- Mona
Where Mona
And then  -- aging actress with fake boobs -- teeters in wearing a flimsy nightgown and six inch heels
'm here
Okay guys, here scene: Mitch, you enter with gun -- where gun
runs in with a huge and gives it to Dave, who takes it limply
(') Guard try to stop you, line-line- line, knock him the fuck out, you see Mona asleep in bed, you wake her up and start fuck time, okay
Dave stammers, his head spinning
What's my motivation
Your motivation
Your motivation is show big tit to business traveler in hotel room too scared to order real porno, okay
(blocking the scene) Okay, here shot list: start makeout here, nightgown fall, close-up of titty, candles burning, bouncing titty close-up, moaning, fake sex- in-mouth obscured by hair, more candle, fake backdoor sex obscured by blowing curtain, more candle, her buttock, his buttock, wind blow out candle and finito, okay
It's like a poem
41
know, baby,  crush this shit big time
Let's lock it up
Locking it up
As the crew bustle about, Mona turns to a shell-shocked Dave
You wanna bump
Mona snorts a fingernail of coke into her nose
bump--
Of drugs
You're cute
But if you try to actually fuck me 'll set your dick on fire with one of these fucking candles, y'understand me
Is this actually happening
Pound away on my upper thigh all you want, that's what it's there for, okay
And no, you can't pay me to give you a real ,  don't do that shit anymore
Dave's mouth opens, but nothing comes out
guides him out of the room
He's still in a trance
: Dave stands there, frozen
Behind the camera, Valtan gestures, go
Dave stumbles into the bedroom, holding the huge machine gun like, well, like a corporate lawyer
-  appears with a gun
- No entry
Dave looks around at the bright lights, the camera, the crew watching him -- and he freezes up
The goon tries again: said: No entry
42
Then Dave sees a
waving at him, holding up a huge board with his lines written on them
Shielding his eyes from the lights, Dave reads his lines, monotone: If you let me don't in
don't let me in
If you don't let me in, Paco,  will fuck you dead
That doesn't sound right
If you don't let me Taco-- is his name Paco or Taco
Your penmanship is illegible-- Fuck it, we fix in post
Just knock out guard, wake up girl, and make fuck time
Keep rolling
Still rolling
Dave very effeminately "karate chops" the goon in the neck once, and the guy dramatically throws himself against the wall and drops, unconscious
Then Dave crosses and pretends to suddenly see Mona in the bed
His acting is atrocious
Oh my goodness it is Lola my long lost lover Lola who
love
Her
More sexy
Too stiff
Annnd Mona wake up, surprised
Mona, not much of a better actor than Dave, wakes up -- and deafeningly, like some 1950's horror queen
( ) -- Steve Action
You perfect bastard
And now kiss her like savage
Dave, totally grossed out by her, very reluctantly leans in for the kiss
Just before their lips meet, he pulls away
'm sorry
can't
43
( ) What the fuck, man
She ready for first class trip to fuck town
Look,  can't, 'm married
No no no, Steve Action throw wife off cliff in last scene
No,  mean, me, in real life
'm married
So am
Mona my wife
Yeah, how stupid is that shit, man
Now go fake-fuck my wife before owners of house come back from ski vacation to find film crew in master bedroom
Dave just stands there, hopelessly out of place
: standing in the back of an auditorium as on stage, two dozen 5 year old  in tutus prance about, rehearsing a ballet
The teacher,
, fruitlessly tries to direct them
onstage, twirling around -- until a bigger girl,  , knocks her over
Mrs
Kleinman turns to see Cara splayed out on the ground, trying not to cry
Oh Cara, do try to stay on your toes
Let's start again
In the audience, Mitch straightens: what was that
'    -- Mitch drives Cara home from ballet
She sits shotgun in her tutu, looking small and sad
Shouldn't  be sitting in my carseat
44
Whatever, you're fine -- hey, what's up with that little blonde bitch who knocked you over
She looks a little surprised by her dad's language
That's Nicolette Peters
She does that a lot, actually
So why don't you fight back
Um, because you told me not to
You said  should strive for verbal resolution
Fuck verbal resolution
Put that whore on her back and shank her
Do you know how to make a shiv
What
Mitch lights a cigarette with the car lighter
Listen to me, kid: the world is a cesspool of cruelty and violence
If someone comes at you with a knife, you gotta put their entire fucking family in the morgue, okay
That's called jailyard justice
Because if you don't come back hard on a bitch, your ass is gonna get sold for a pack of Camel Lights and a jello cup, y'understand
Always solve your problems with violence
Always
Cara nods, alarmed
-Okay Daddy
: He's sitting at a booth in a bar, highly traumatized
45
dry-humped a stranger's leg for three hours today
Sitting opposite him, Mitch downs a shot, exhausted
Cry me a river, dude:  dealt with ballet and your ass-hat boss today
Oh no -- what happened at work
Nothing
Nothing
(off Dave's look) fixed it
(off Dave's look) Okay, but look, it was not my fault
The Japs started peppering me with questions and  had to improvise and then everyone got very emotional and, well
it looks like we're going to court
Oh my God tell me you're kidding
Yeah, your boss was pretty miffed, but then  told him this was all part of my master plan to make more money off our clients-- What
1 Yeah, turns out that's totally illegal, but the old man was surprisingly cool about it
Dave sits there, speechless
Mitch eats wings
(') Hey, your secretary is sort of hot in like a Dame Judi Dench-playing-a- Nazi kind of way
Is she on the fuck team
46
() just want to go home
: ' as the sun sets
The windows are open and the wind is in their hair
They're very much not talking to each other
'  -- Dave and Mitch head up Dave's front walk, solemn
What are you gonna tell Jamie
The truth
Can  highly recommend against that
'  -- Mitch and Dave enter to find Cara running down the stairs in her Dora the Explorer pajamas
Dave smiles and opens his arms, tired and overjoyed to see her
Hey, sugar-bug
but she passes right by him and hugs Mitch
Hi Daddy
Dave stammers, stung
Mitch hugs her, acting stiff like Dave
Well hello, my precocious daughter
Okay,  don't sound like that-- Just then Jamie hurries past, the twins in her arms, and kisses Mitch on the lips
Both men startle a bit
47
Hey
( ) Hi Mitch
This is so weird
No shit
You staying for dinner
Silence
Then Mitch nudges Dave
Right -- no, thank you
'm-- Look, Jamie, we really need to talk
Okay, but make it quick, 've got to put the twins to bed
um
'm not Mitch
'm Mitch
Somehow
we switched bodies last night
He's Dave
Jamie looks back and forth between them, expressionless
(') You see, what happened was, we peed into a magic fountain-- Then the city moved the fountain-- But as soon as they find it, we're going to switch back
Great
Sounds like a plan
Are you kidding
Is she kidding
Clearly yes
Jamie heads for the stairs when Dave stops her
48
Baby, please don't-- Okay, Mitch, first of all, don't call me baby, it's creepy
Second of all
what the hell are you talking about
Look,  can prove it's true
Just, don't know, just ask me anything that only  -- that only Dave -- would know
Anything
When's our wedding anniversary
Dave freezes, oh shit
Spring
Spring
Dude, it's March 24th, even  know that
Why do you know that
So that  can send you a thoughtful card -- what kind of monster are you
Look, just ask me anything else
really don't have time to-- Jamie, please
What's my favorite color
You have a favorite color
49
Mauve
Dude: do you not understand what we're trying to accomplish here
'm just saying, look at all the accents in this room -- she loves mauve
Baby -- Jamie -- ask me anything else, something more personal
Fine, what did we talk about two nights ago
was crying
(taking a stab in the dark) Yourrrrr mother maybe
That's great, Mitch
Thanks a big bunch
Come on, honey
Jamie steams upstairs, pissed, with Cara in tow
Dave runs his hands through his hair, fuck
Mitch looks appalled: Dude, you are like the worst husband ever
have a lot on my plate right now, man
You have no idea
Okay, look, calm down:  can hold down the fort for one night
Are you joking
You worked at my job for one day and you almost got arrested
What are you gonna do to my family
Dude, the kids are already going to bed
() 50
(') think  can handle watching Two And  Half fucking Men and falling asleep on the couch with the best of 'em
The only roadblock foresee is: what do  tell Jamie
What do you tell Jamie
when
When she wants to have sex tonight
But it's Tuesday
don't understand
You don't have sex on Tuesdays
beat
Then Dave starts
It builds
Dave hasn't laughed this hard in a long time
He pats Mitch's cheek
That's adorable
Dave turns and exits the house, still
(') You know what, give it a shot
Really
You want me to bang your wife
Sure, have at it
Let me know how it goes
: '  -- Dave parks Mitch's Fiero on this shady Silver Lake street, glancing at the   stumbling by, a bit scared
'  -- Dave enters Mitch's apartment and flips on the bright overhead light
The white walls are empty
futon, , and four crates of bird seed are all that occupy the living room
Jesus, it's like a Swedish asylum-- 51
And then Mitch's iPhone
Dave hesitates, then answers: (') Mitch Planko, who the fuck is this
sexy woman's voice purrs: (
) Hiii Mitch, it's Tatiana
Dave straightens, oh shit
Tatiana
Hi
How, um, how are you
(
) 'll be better in a few minutes after  fuck you raw
She hangs up
Dave freezes, wide-eyed
Oh my God
Oh my God
He quickly dials a number
Sitting on the plush couch with Jamie, eating takeout sushi and watching Two and a Half Men on the huge plasma
The phone rings
Mitch sees the caller , then answers it
Hey dude,  take back everything said about Two and a Half Men
This is some edgy shit-- Tatiana is on her way over
Nice
What do you think  should do
think you should fuck her, that's what  think you should do
Jamie looks over at Mitch, weirded out; he gets up and crosses into the hallway for some privacy
52
(') Don't blow this for me, dude, she's my Tuesday night regular
But wouldn't  be
sort of
cheating on Jamie
Maybe
No
Cheating is when any part of your penis touches any part of another woman who is not your wife, and last  checked, your wang is safely tucked away in my incredibly lame triple-pleated sport slacks
But my mind is over here, doesn't that count
somehow
Dude, how many women have you fucked in your mind
Thousands
Millions
Right, and that's not cheating, right
Your reasoning is oddly impeccable
think you're on firm legal ground here, amigo
say jump that ass
Jesus
haven't had sex with another woman since college
Well, it still works the same, but this chick is a lot to handle so pace yourself, okay
She's hornier than a priest at summer camp
Oh my God so am --
There's a  at the apartment door
Dave jumps, freaked: 53
(') Holy shit she's already here
What do  do
You'll do fine
Just wear a condom, okay
Don't give me -- Just then  -- the door flies open and a very sexy blonde enters the apartment wearing a long trenchcoat and five inch stiletto heels
She moves towards Dave like a panther
(freezing, breathless) Tatiana
Are you ready to ride
- honestly don't know
She throws off her trenchcoat to reveal she's not wearing anything underneath
Awesome
Less awesome is the fact that she's
Massive breasts sit atop a huge, distended, veiny, protruding stomach
Dave recoils
(') Why the fuck are you still wearing clothes
As she advances towards him, Dave climbs up the futon
But you're--
When are you due
Any minute now, so let's get our fuck on before this becomes a threesome
Oh god gross
Wait, who's the father
Am  the father
No
but you are my daddy
54
She smiles coyly and slides on top of him
Holy shit you're so heavy-- My tits are aching for you
Actually that's probably just the colostrum coming in, it can be very -- Tatiana finally stops with the femme fatale routine
Okay: what's your deal tonight
Nothing
Nothing
just-- Is it my new haircut
No
The trenchcoat
Too cliche
No
love the coat
Is it,  don't know, the pregnancy
Well
now that you mention it
Maybe, like, a little
What the hell
You picked me up at a Single Mothers Lamaze class
What did you expect
() did
That's terrible
Who would do something like that
Tatiana angrily crosses the room and -- with considerable effort -- bends over and picks up her trenchcoat
55
(') Look, Tatiana, 'm sorry
You're incredibly beautiful, it's just-- (turning, fully naked) What
'm not sexy
Oh my god  can see it kicking
You can, in fact, see the fetus moving around in her belly
You know what
Fuck you, Mitch
Don't ever call me again
She yanks on her coat and storms out
Dave stammers
: '  --  -- It's bedtime
Wearing pajama pants and no shirt, Mitch brushes his teeth and fixes his hair, trying to look sexy
He sucks in his dad-gut in the mirror
Jesus, Dave, it's called a sit-up
Then he sees Jamie's dress land on the bedroom floor, followed by her bra
Mitch exhales: (') Holy shit, 'm finally going to fuck Jamie
This is my greatest hour
hope she likes it weird
Then,   , Jamie enters the bathroom, nude, her hair gently blowing in the wind from an open window
She looks insanely hot
Mitch takes her all in, ravenous
(') Oh my God  am going to ruin her-- And then she sits on the can
And starts taking a dump
Mitch's face drops, horrified
have to cool it on the Thai food
've had the shits all day
56
Mitch just stares at her, dumbstruck, as we hear the empty into the toilet bowl
Oh my
Seriously -- light a candle
She keeps shitting
It sounds like Niagara Falls
Thunderous
Foregoing the candle, Mitch covers his nose with his forearm and stumbles out of the bathroom, nauseous
-- Mitch lies in bed, staring wide-eyed at the ceiling, horrified
Jamie slides in bed with him, touches his arm-- () '
What is your problem
Look,  am not attracted to you right now, okay
So just
No means no, all right
No means no
Jamie rolling over, confused and genuinely hurt
: Then we hear a baby
Then a second baby joins in, even more shrill than the first
Finally, we hear the worst two words a parent can ever hear: (
) Your turn
(
) Mmm
(
) It's your turn to feed the twins
(
) Yeah
really don't feel like it
Jamie turns on the light, pissed
57
Are you fucking kidding me
No, it's 3 in the morning, you go do it
You're the mother
Get the fuck out bed right now and go feed your fucking children or will fucking cut you
Mitch is already scrambling out of the room, terrified
Yes Jamie 'm sorry Jamie
'  -- Mitch just looks at the twins,  in their respective cribs, no idea what to do
He reaches for the phone
Dials
in Mitch's apartment, jacking off to some (very small) internet porn on Mitch's iPhone
Then the porn disappears, and "  " appears on screen
Oh come on
(answering, panting) What
always thought your wife was a nice lady but she is neither nice nor a lady
She talks like a dock- worker and she shits like one too
Plus  used to think your kids were adorable but actually they're just really fucking annoying and crazy needy-- Wait, are you jacking off
What
No
So why are you panting
Look,  had to,  never get this kind of privacy anymore
58
But isn't that sort of
my penis
Dave looks down
Yeah
guess
Is that weird
don't know
It sort of hooks to the side a bit
Yeah
Go lefty, you'll get better torque
Cool, thanks
Hey, how long have you been shaved down there
It's kind of pro forma now, dude
Really
Yeah, only married dudes still rock dick-fros anymore-- wait: if Tatiana was over earlier, why do you still need to jack off
Yeeeah, Tatiana might not be coming back
Like, ever
What did you do
Me
She's nine months pregnant
Oh my God you're so picky
could see the baby kicking, dude
59
So what, she's having a girl
It wouldn't have been a little boy tickling your tip
Jesus,  can't believe you fucked up my Tuesday night regular
Relax, Mitch-- No
You married guys have no idea how hard it is to build a reliable stable
You don't
It's a full time job
Getting girls' phone numbers, calling them, emailing them, Facebooking them, Twittering them, buying them drinks and dinners and coffees and listening to endless stories about their stupid fucking friends and begging them to touch your wiener on the second date and building an elaborate web of lies so they don't all find out about each other -- it's exhausting
And then poof
In one night, you just casually discard my life's work
Jesus, okay, 'm sorry
Sorry doesn't lick my ballbag every Tuesday night
Look, is there a reason you're calling me at 3 in the morning
Mitch glares back to the twins, who are still
Yeah, your mean wife is making me feed the kids
What do  do
Have you changed their diapers already
(beat, lying) Yes
Obviously
60
Okay, take them to the kitchen
Hold on
Mitch puts the phone in his mouth and picks up the Carrying them like bags of wheat, he jogs down as they scream their heads off
He's totally rattled: , -- Mitch jogs into the kitchen and, plop, sets the twins on the , then speaks into the phone again: All right
In the kitchen
Go to the fridge
Mitch turns away from the twins and opens the fridge
He sees a bottle of wine and immediately drinks from the bottle
Yeah
Defrost two bags of breastmilk in the microwave for 3 minutes, then prepare two separate bottles
Mitch grabs a container of cow's milk, sniffs it, turns to give it to the babies -- to discover that Sarah is gone, and Peter is licking an
Holy fuck
Mitch yanks Peter away just as  shoot from the socket
What was that
Nothing
Go on
Two bottles
61
First: attach the filter to the seal to the nipple
Mitch hears   and spins to see that Sarah has crawled over to the   and removed a and a   and is waving them about like rattles
Oh jesus oh jesus
Mitch approaches her, wide-eyed, tentative -- when Sarah giggles and spastically whips the cleaver at him
He barely sidesteps it, and it impacts into a cupboard door -- -
(') This is so fucked up
know, right
And make sure you don't allow any air bubbles in
Mitch grabs a pair of tongs and, after a few attempts, snatches the butcher knife from Sarah's hands
Then he scoops her up and deposits her into the sink with her brother
Finally, he slumps over, trying to catch his breath
Dude
Listen to me: you need to go downtown first thing tomorrow morning and you need to find that fucking fountain
He starts pouring cow's milk into the babies' mouths
It splashes all over them, but they manage to lap up some of it
(') Honestly, 'm really not sure how much more of this shit  can take
: "   " District Manager Carla Nelson sits behind her desk in her bland, putty office, the next morning
She is still bored
Good news
Your formal information request was approved
Dave stops pacing, deeply relieved
62
Great
So where's the fountain
Oh
We won't hear back for one to three weeks, maybe more
How long can it possibly take you to find your own fountain
One to three weeks, maybe One to three weeks, maybe more
more
(') Thanks, Carla, you just ruined my life
Have an awesome day
Dave blows out of there, choking on his fury
: still furious
He looks around for Mitch
(') Mitch
Mitch
Bad news, buddy
Dave bounds up the stairs
-- Jamie quietly  as she gets the twins dressed for the day
Dave charges in-- Real bad news--
Jamie startles and quickly dries her eyes
Dave's in the shower
Are you okay
Dave enters, concerned, and instinctively starts helping her dress the babies
She watches him, a bit confused
63
(') Come on, you can tell me
We've been friends forever
() It's Dave
he's been acting so strange lately
Last night
Last night he even told me he wasn't attracted to me
Oh my god 'm going to fucking kill him
Just tell me honestly
is Dave having an affair
No
Jamie
swear he's not
You're just going through a very temporary rough patch, okay
Temporary
We've been in this rough patch for years (this is news to him) -You have
You don't want to hear about this
No  really do
Tell me everything
Jamie looks at him, sees the urgency in his eyes
Frowns
It's not his fault, really
love him with all my heart, you know do, but-you remember Dave's family growing up
They were a mess
They had nothing
Dave's entire childhood was spent looking over the fence, wanting a better life
So he scrimped and saved and worked four jobs at once and put himself through school and built a better life for himself
've always loved that about him
() 64
(') No one ever gave him anything
The problem is, now that he's got a good life, he can't turn it off -- he's still looking over the fence, wanting something even better, a second house, more kids, a faster car, a bigger promotion, whatever it is that he thinks will finally make him happy
Dave reddens, defensive; this is hitting very close to home
well poor Jamie
You have an ambitious, hard-working husband who provides for you and your family -- how can you even stand it
( ) No,  know,  should be grateful
and  am
guess all 'm saying is that Dave is so focussed on what he doesn't have that he can't see what he does
And how long can you stay married to someone who is incapable of ever being happy
She looks at him, searching
Dave stammers, realizing for the first time just how much trouble his marriage is in
Then: Check it out:  have freckles on my taint
How awesome is that
They turn to see Mitch in the doorway, buck naked and wet, holding a hand-mirror under his balls
Then he sees Dave
(') Oh, hey, fag
Why're you here
: (
) (') One to three weeks, maybe more
'  --  -- Mitch shaves in the bathroom as Dave paces, anxious
What the fuck does that even mean
65
It means we might be in each other's bodies for a while
What
No
can't do this anymore
Your life sucks
My life sucks
You drive a Fiero-- Jamie calls through the door: (
) Um, 'm going to work
All right, angel
Have a nice day
(
) (') You guys okay in there
Yup
Just two dudes chilling in the bathroom, nothing weird about that
(
) Okay
See you later
We hear Jamie's  retreat
Dave grows emotional: Listen to me:  know  complain about my family sometimes, but Jamie and the kids are everything to me
My marriage is falling apart, my job is on the line, and need you to step up and be the best possible version of me, okay
Dude, honestly, 'm working my nuts off over here
don't know how to play you any better
Well
Then 'm just gonna have to teach you
Let's start at the : : 66
'  --  -- Dave holds up a suit from his closet
Mitch watches
This is called a suit
You have to wear one every day, along with-- (holding up tie) -- (holding up socks) Black -- not white -- socks-- (holding up dress shoes) Dress shoes, not shower sandals-- (holding up boxers) And underwear
Oh come on
No
No more commando
You are a grown-ass man
Mitch mimics heiling Hitler and starts getting dressed
'  -- Mitch, highly uncomfortable in his business suit, scowls as Dave shows him the kids' schedules on the fridge
This is called a schedule
It tells you everything you need to do in a given day
Drop offs
Pick ups
Activities
Playdates
Doctors appointments
You'll notice that there are approximately 50 hours worth of obligations on any given day
Find a way
'    -- Dave drives
Mitch slumps in the passenger seat, grumpy
Always be thinking of your next responsibility
It helps to break your day into four minute increments
And remember: there is no margin for error
() 67
(') If you pick up the twins, the drycleaning and the diaper cream but forget the organic quince paste from that little place on Abbot Kinney, everyone still hates you
You have to be perfect
-- Dave walks Mitch through Whole Foods with a cart, selecting various items from the list
This is called a grocery store
You buy food here
Before heading to the market, always call Jamie first and ask her if she needs anything
In fact, before you make anV decisions in your life, no matter how small, call your wife first
Think of yourself as a retarded mule lost in the desert: helpless, dumb, and in constant need of direction
Never take initiative, never strike out on your own, never deviate from the plan: you are always wrong
You are a retarded mule lost in the desert
'    -- They drive down the street, the car packed with groceries
When you're with Jamie, you should always be doing one of three things: asking her permission, complimenting her, or begging her forgiveness
It doesn't matter if she already said you could go to poker night, or if she looks like fucking Mothra in that dress, or if you didn't do anything wrong
Permission, compliments, apologies
That's all anyone wants to hear out of a husband's mouth
Here, let's practice: what's your favorite joke
Umm
rabbi, a priest--
Dave punches Mitch in the nuts
68
Trick question
No one fucking cares
You're Dave Lockwood, boring dad, you're not Jerry Fucking Seinfeld
Shut the fuck up
Mitch clutches his balls, hurt and scared
-  -- Dave and Mitch, wearing sombreros, sit behind a tiny desk in this colorful pre-school classroom, preparing the healthy snacks they just purchased for Cara and her rowdy
These are called children, or dependents
Never disparage your own children -- everything they do is a miracle from God
When they're bad, it's only because they're tired or going through a phase
When other people's kids are bad, however, it's because of indulgent parenting or innate defects in the ' -- cute little  snatches three apple slices
(') One a piece, please, Dylan
( ) Kid's a natural born criminal
If he sees 18, it'll be from the inside a jail cell
'  -- Dave walks Mitch through the office
This is called an office, or work
Think about whatever you most want to do here, and then do the exact opposite
You want to go home early
Great: stay all night
Hungry
Cool: don't eat
Think your boss is a total douche
Terrific: invite him to join your fantasy baseball league
cute  walks by and Mitch overtly eye-fucks her all the way past
Dave nut-punches him again
69
(') You're married now, jackass
You can't look at other women, you can't talk to other women, you can't even be interesting around other women
Do everything in your power to de-sexualize yourself -- wear a fannypack, drive a Passat, affix electronic devices to your belt -- whatever it takes
If you're forced to interact with a woman, quickly find a way to mention that you're married
It doesn't even have to make sense
Just be like "Nice weather today, 'm totally fucking married
" Wait, so  can't sleep with my wife and  can't sleep with other women
What is that
It's called marriage
Dave turns into his office, nodding at his mean secretary
(') Good morning, Gladys
She scowls at him, confused, who's this guy
Then Mitch passes and wiggles his tongue at her, simulating cunnilingus
The old lady , appalled
'  -- They enter Dave's office
Do you have any other questions
Yeah -- when's your free time
(- him again) Have you been listening to one word 've said
There is no fucking free time
You don't have a life anymore
You don't have a personality, or an identity, or a point of view
You are a dad
() 70
(') Your job is to allocate resources, to shuttle children from  to , to deliver food at appropriate intervals, to clean up, to break down, to construct, to repair, to finance, to sooth, to make everyone else happy, okay
And when your day is done, you know what you get
Dry handjob
Nothing
You're not single anymore
No one gives you a cupcake every time you hold the door or speak in complete sentences, it's expected of you now, so grow up
Okay, can  just say something without you punching my cock
(Dave inhales, go) think you might be taking some of this adult shit a little seriously-- Knock knock
Both men turn to see Sabrina in the doorway, looking lovely in a short skirt suit, holding documents
Mitch straightens
-lo legs
Yes
um
sort of big news
(solicitous, creepy) Please, come in
Coffee
Scotch
(entering, tentative) No
thanks
Anyway, Kinkabe and Amalgamated have agreed to go into binding mediation in two days
Two days
Are you kidding me
Sabrina glances at Dave, confused, no idea who he is
71
-No
Anyway, 'll have my briefs on your desk by tonight
(stretching leg on desk) And 'll have my briefs on your chin by tomorrow morning-- And that is Level 4 Sexual Harassment
Awesome
Thanks, Sabrina, that will be all
Oh shit, this is Sabrina
Sabrina looks at Dave, even more confused
Have
Have we met
(shaking Sabrina's hand) Oh
'm sorry, no
'm Mitch, Dave's completely idiotic friend
( ) Sabrina McArdle
Nice to meet you
Mitch notices their chemistry and immediately blurts out: You guys should go out
What
Yeah
You're single now, Mitch, remember
And Sabrina is stone fucking hot
Look at that body
Sabrina: swimmer in college
Dave--
72
You two should go out, have a nice steak dinner, go dancing at some weird Korean nightclub and then fuck on the roof, you know what mean
How's 8pm tomorrow night, Richter's Steakhouse
Sabrina and Dave stammer, sharing a terrorized look
Um, good,  guess
Great
know for a fact that Mitch is free, so he'll see you there
And honey: wear something tight, you know what  mean
Make it fun
Yeah
'm gonna go now
Sabrina hurries out, appalled
Dave clutches his forehead: Oh my god 'm so fucking fired
No dude: you're so fucking laid
You can't talk to women like that at work
Or anywhere, really
'm sorry,  just got you a date with the number one girl on your Cancer List and this is the thanks get
'm not going on the date, Mitch
Yes you are
No
'm not
73
Yes you are, because if you don't, will feed'your children non- organic snacks and then introduce them to my extensive girl-on-horse pornography collection
How do you think Jamie will react to that
Dave just looks at Mitch, horrified
Why
Why are you doing this to me
Because 've seen your life and if you don't loosen up soon you are literally going to die
So go out with this chick
Have fun
Bust a nut
Remember why life is beautiful again, okay
Please
This actually gets to Dave a bit
He frowns, fine
(') Also, see if she likes to fuck on Tuesday nights, because you owe me a regular
: -- His work day over, Mitch strides through the parking lot, heading for his car, cheerfully waving to various : / /
Mitch reaches his Audi station wagon when-- Dave
Mitch turns to see his father, ,
passing, smiling
Oh
Hey
Mister
Planko
What are you doing here
,
My attorney's in this building
74
He notices the    on Dave's rear windshield, labelled for each member of his family
He smiles at them: ,
(') Oh, what a neat idea
Yeah, maybe if you're from Kansas
,
Your parents are very lucky to have so many grandchildren
(quick, sharp) What's that supposed to mean
,
Nothing
Nothing
How are y--
mean, you still have a really fucking cool son, right
,
Yes, Mitch is definitely cool
How are the twins
They're fucking fine-- what the fuck does that mean, "Mitch is definitely cool
" ,
( ) Nothing
No, it's my fault spoiled him rotten after his mother passed away, but
He trails off, clearly not wanting to talk about this
But what, dude
Spit it out
,
But now he's a total fuck up
Mitch actually
His dad smiles sadly: 75
,
(') mean, he's a great guy, he's the life of the party, but he has no work ethic, he has no backbone, he'll never build a family or a career or anything of substance like you have
He's
embarrassing
Mitch stands there, mouth agape, just decimated
,
(') Anyway, 'm sorry to go on and on
How's your lovely wife--
Mitch starts   and fumbling with the car door
Your son is not a fuck up, -Mr
Planko
He's just a late bloomer
His dad looks utterly confused as Mitch gets into the car
,
Dave
Are you crying
'm sorry, 'm just very close to Mitch and when people say mean things about him  hurt too-- He  the door shut and jerks out of the parking spot, tears pouring down his face
His dad watches on, bewildered
'  -- Mitch angrily drives home, trying to stop crying
Fuck
Fuck
And then Survivor's "Eye of the Tiger" comes on the radio
Mitch's expression slowly turns to steely determination
: As "Eye of the Tiger" continues playing, we hear a baby Then we hear a second baby join in
Finally, we hear the worst two words a parent can ever hear: -- 76
Mitch sits bolt upright in bed like Rambo, totally awake, his jaw set, and bounds out of bed
-- Mitch aggressively changes the twins' diapers
He's doing a terrible job, but he's focussed, working hard
-- Mitch assembles two baby bottles as the twins sit in the sink He  back at them
-- Mitch sits erect on the couch like a Navajo warrior, feeding the twins, his eyes afire
'  -- Wearing fingerless driving gloves, Mitch races the twins to day care
He looks like the fucking Transporter
, ,  --   -- Mitch blows into the office, looking sharp in a business suit
He points at other lawyers, amped up, not smiling
'   ,
His old secretary Gladys falls in step with him
-- need the book , every season of Law & Order on  and Blu-Ray, and the biggest fucking coffee you can carry on my desk in 15 minutes or else you're fired
Gladys writes this down on a pad of paper, a bit turned on
(') Also get yourself a new haircut and a pair of six inch stripper shoes
It's time to take this shit to the next level
77
'  -- Mitch studies a legal casebook while chugging coffee
Law & Order plays on the  in the background
Then an  sounds on his desk and he races out of his office, all business
'  -- Mitch hurries into the pediatrician's office, talking on his BlackBerry phone, a twin in each arm, a cigarette dangling from his mouth
The  frowns
Mitch makes the universal "jerking off" motion with his hand
-- Mitch races through the supermarket with a cart, grabbing items off the shelves like Supermarket Sweeps
-- Mitch jogs into the crowded auditorium and sits next to Jamie
The ballet recital is already in progress
, two dozen adorable little  in pink tutu's pile and jete about
Jamie points out little Cara in pigtails
Mitch smiles
Fuck me she's cute
Uh oh, here comes the second battement glisse
Jamie tenses up
Mitch does too
As Cara starts her spin, Nicolette Peters goes to push her over -- and Cara calmly grabs her arm,  her over her shoulder, and drops her flat on her back with a loud
As Nicolette starts , Cara calmly continues dancing like nothing happened
The other girls on stage look pleased
Mitch  and : ,
Jamie hits him, , but is clearly proud of her little girl
dozen rows ahead of them, '  -- a huge former linebacker -- leaps up, outraged: 78
' Mitch hops up, equally fired up
' The entire auditorium
Nicolette's father turns
' , Nicolette's father, his face beet red, starts climbing over people and seats, insanely gunning for Mitch
' '
Honey--
, -
Mitch bounds over the seats, charging right back at him
Mrs
Kleinmen and all the little ballerinas stand frozen, mouths agape, watching Mitch and Nicolette's father claw their way over seats, trying to get to each other
(') '      - Nicolette's dad levels him    as we : '    -- Jamie drives along, a slight smile on her face
Mitch sits shotgun, battered and beaten, holding an ice pack to his cheek
Cara sits in her carseat in the back, a bit stunned
Well, looks like you won't be doing ballet at the rec center anymore
79
That's okay
didn't really like it anyway
Where'd you learn to ninja-flip a girl like that
The internet
Good girl
So what'd we learn from this
Always solve my problems with violence
That's right, baby
Bones
They bump fists
Jamie is stunned
What
No, angel, that's exactly the wrong lesson
You should never use violence, except to defend yourself, okay
Mitch subtly shakes his head at Cara, don't listen to her
Violence is cool
Dave
'm kidding
( ) 'm not kidding
Cara  in the backseat
Jamie can't help but laugh too
Soon they're all
It's a nice moment
love you, Daddy
() Oh
- love you too, angel
80
Jamie smiles over at Mitch
as he feels the family love for the first time
He looks touched
even a little proud
Then his cell phone rings
He answers it: (') Lockwood
( ) haven't been on a first date in over a decade and 'm drowning in my own fear--
Don't move
'll be right over
: of his old apartment to find Dave, in khaki's and a pressed buttondown, freaking out in the mirror-- How do  look
Like a fucking tool
Step aside-- Mitch throws open the closet and yanks out a pair of jeans
(') These are called jeans
They've been very popular with our nation's young people for over 60 years
Put them on immediately
Jeans
To a restaurant
Mitch punches Dave in the nuts; he doubles over
Shut up and do what  say
We only have 3 hours to make you cool
: ' Mitch shows Dave how to put gel into his hair
81
This is called gel, or product
Use too little and you look like a pedophile Cub Scout leader, use too much and you look Persian
Neither is a winning hand
Dave very nervously applies gel to his hair
' Dave stands with his pants around his ankles as Mitch very delicately shaves his balls with a Bic razor
Okay, normally  would never do this for another man, but since we're in a rush, and technically this is my testicle bag, 'm making a rare exception
Always man-scape before a first date
It shows a lady that you're clean, considerate, and American
-- Don't speak, it jiggles your sack
-- Exotic sells the most pimped-out used cars in
Mitch off the lot in a   and cruises down the Sunset Strip, music
Dave sits shotgun, stunned
can't believe you just charged a Ferrari to my Discover Card
You need to learn to be spontaneous, Dave
Chicks like spontaneous
(to  walking by) Hey ladies
Show us your tits
They flip him off
Mitch laughs
Dave is still floored: What are we gonna tell Jamie
82
Do me a favor, Dave
Relax your butt hole
What
Your sphincter
Just
release it
Dave's entire body visibly relaxes a bit
(') You didn't even know it was puckered, right
Now recline your seat a bit
( ) Good
Now take some deep breaths
(Dave does, calming) Now give me your sunglasses
Dave gives him his sunglasses; Mitch chucks them out the window and hands him his cool Ray Ban's
(') Now, just for like three minutes, don't be a dad, don't be a husband, don't be a lawyer, just be a dude rolling down Sunset strip in a fucking Ferrari with his best friend listening to Seal, okay
Dave looks out the window, getting into it
(') Feels good, right
After a moment, a  escapes from under Dave's shades
(') It's okay, just let it out
It's been so long since  felt cool
know, baby
know
They cruise for a bit longer, then Mitch pulls into a Dave looks confused
83
Why are we washing the car
It's brand new
We're not washing the car, David
We're getting you mentally, physically, and spiritually ready for your date
Come on
--  -- Mitch and a very confused Dave enter the car wash lobby
Now
don't have time to cover all the ways in which women have changed since you last dated
Mitch stops at the register to pay
Various keep saying hi to Dave, weirding him out
Hola, Mitch
/ Como esta, Mitch
The bottom line is: the internet has revolutionized everything
You mean like -date
Fuck -date
No
The internet has changed chicks in three major ways: first, access and acceptance of pornography has commoditized women and pressured them into becoming sluttier at far younger ages, which is awesome
Mitch finishes paying and continues through the car wash
(') Second: text messaging has de- stigmatized the booty call
Call a girl at 3 in the morning for sex and it's creepy
Text her " " and it's classy have no idea why, but again, an awesome development
() 84
(') Third: Facebook and other social networking sites have falsely convinced people -- women included -- that they are funny, interesting, and unique
Get used to listening waaay more than you used to
Chicks are the new dudes, they talk about themselves all the fucking time now
Practice saying things like "you are so different" and "no, really, what Golden Girl would you be
" and " love Lady Gaga too
" What's a Lady Gaga
don't know, it's either a pop singer or an energy drink
They arrive at the
People sit around, waiting for their cars, many of them young, female, and cute
(') Okay, let's talk to some honeys, get your flow going again
So wait, why are we at a car wash
The girls are alone, bored, and old enough to drive -- it's a goldmine
run game here four to seven times a week
Now go on, bust a move
Come on,  talk to women all the time,  don't need to practice
Really
Yes
And no offense, as a married man,  probably know how to talk to women better than you do
Reall v
85
Yes
It's not that hard
They just want to be respected and listened to like everybody else
Okay Daddy Day Care show me how it's done then
Shit
Dave sighs and crosses to a   texting nearby
As he draws closer, however, he starts to tense up
soon he's sweating
it's been a long time
by the time he finally reaches the blonde, his voice is ridiculously shrill: Hello there what's your name
She doesn't even look up from her BlackBerry
Dave's confidence instantly crumbles
(') -'m sorry, 'm not trying to hit on you
'm just
mean, 'm married, so that's not even a thing
--Where are you from--
Mitch appears and yanks him away
Dave looks traumatized: (') Was she reaching for her rape whistle
Shake it off
Being single is like the Tour De France: it's all about quick recovery time
Now go on, get your groove back, you're meeting Sabrina in a half hour
: Of Dave trying to chat up various   at the carwash
Your name is Dora
Like the Explorah
No
You aren't familiar with that show
86
(trying to be sexy) So: what school district do you live in
Yikes, what do your parents think of all those piercings
and that's the difference between a stroller and a pram
My car's ready
The   races off towards her newly cleaned car
Dave slumps, shit
Mitch nods, looking at his watch
Forty seconds
Not bad
Your times are improving
forgot how hard it is to be single
As a general rule, when you're talking to single women, conversation topics to avoid include: your wife, your children, your favorite playgrounds, and The Wiggles
Dave nods, hating himself
Mitch heads for the Ferrari
(') But this was good
You worked out all your bad game and now you're ready to dominate
Come on
: -- Mitch rockets down Sunset Boulevard
Dave looks nauseous
87
don't feel good about this
Relax: you're dressed cool, your hair is crushing it, your ballsack is taut and smooth, and you're way better looking than you've ever been
Just remember Uncle Mitch's Golden Rule of Dating
know, always use an alias
What
No
No, my Golden Rule of Dating is always find the fun
Think of it like this: for the next two hours, you're stuck with this chick
Doesn't matter if she's cool or crazy or if she was born with a vagina on her forehead -- you're stuck, so make the most of it dated this chick named Topaz once who may or may not have killed her father
Long story short, she looked like 50 miles of bad road and  wasn't interested, but  used our time together to learn about incest and the failures of the American Appellate Court system found it hugely informative, and Topaz got caught up in my enthusiasm and gave me a crying blowjob on the car-ride home, so everybody won
The point is: find the fun for yourself and great things will follow
Dave looks horrified as they roll up to ', a chic steakhouse
(') Power hug
Mitch hugs a still-speechless Dave
(') Now go on
Make daddy proud
: 88
'  -- Richter's is dark, elegant, romantic
Dave sits at a candle- lit table, anxiously folding and unfolding sugar packets
Then Sabrina enters, looking stunning in a snug red dress, and gazes around the restaurant
Dave's heart skips a beat, and he waves her over
She approaches, smiling
Hey
Hey
Hi
Hello
He awkwardly goes to kiss her cheek while she goes for a handshake
It's awkward/cute
(') Oh -- whoop -- okay
They sit
Dave stares at her, terrified
Then he blurts out: (') Do you like Googoo Lady
What
what is that
- don't know
really don't
Sabrina smiles politely and looks around for a waiter
Dave winces, hating himself to the very core of his being
So
How long have you known Dave
-My whole life, actually
Annnd have you ever seen him act like he did yesterday
What, like a total douchebag
She
Dave can't believe it
He loosens up a bit
89
(') That's not fair
Dave
Dave isn't himself right now
hope he didn't say anything to offend you
No
mean, he totally did, but it's fine
have brothers
Dave pours both of them a glass of wine, finding his rhythm
So
You like working with Dave
love it
He's the best
Isn't he just
eh, nevermind
No, go on
actually used to sort of have a crush on him, if you must know
() You did
That's so
ironic
mean, he's married, so obviously
Right
Obviously
Well, 'm just like Dave, only way more handsome
She laughs
Dave smiles back, his confidence growing, as we : as they meander through the courses of their meal
We've never seen Dave so animated and alive and happy
: 90
'  -- Dave and Sabrina exit the restaurant
It's a warm night
Well,  had a great time
Oh -- are we done
It's only 2
Right
No
What are we, lame married people
Let's go to a rave
or something
Do people
still do that
Raving
My friend is spinning afterhours at Foxtail, if you want
() Spinning
Is that with the bikes
Sabrina laughs and takes his arm
You're so funny
Come on
-- line of  wait outside Foxtail
Holding Dave's hand, Sabrina cuts the line, kisses the  on the cheek, and he lets them inside
Dave nods, awesome
-- Dave and Sabrina get down on the sweaty, crowded dance floor
The house music is deafening and the lights are hypnotizing and everyone is having the time of their lives
Dave, his shirt half-open, moves sensually in sync with Sabrina, both of them possessed by the music
They're inches apart and her dress and hair fly about in all the right ways
-- Foxtail is closed, but Dave, with Sabrina on his lap, sits in a booth drinking champagne with   and all of his ridiculously cool friends
Dave tells a joke and everyone laughs -- including  , who's sitting next to him; Kiefer slaps Dave five
Nice
91
-- Dave, Sabrina, Bassnectar, Kiefer Sutherland, and a group of hipsters play poker in Kiefer's unbelievable
Music blasts, beer bottles litter the table, and everyone is having fun
Sabrina wins a hand and does a victory dance
-- Dave walks Sabrina home along her quaint, tree-lined street
Now that was a first date
For a guy with a poker table in his living room, Kiefer Sutherland is surprisingly bad at poker
know
'm not even sure he understood the rules
She laughs
Then they stop in front of her apartment
Beat
It's so weird,  feel like 've known you for longer than just one night
Yeah
Me too
There's a lull for a kiss
Dave hesitates
so Sabrina moves in and kisses him
It's sweet but passionate
When it's over, Dave can barely speak: (') Can
Can, um, can  call you sometime
Do people still say that
Yes -- and you'd better
Okay
Well
Good night, Sabrina
Good night, Mitch
92
She gives him a thoughtful smile then disappears inside
Dave waits a second, then does a victorious karate chop,
: Light floods into Mitch's apartment
Dave wakes up and looks at the clock: 9:02
Fuck that
He rolls over and goes back to sleep, a smile on his face
-- Dave sits at an outdoor table, reading a novel and taking his time with brunch
He sees a  wolfing down his food and running off to his car, yelling into his cell phone, stressed out of his mind
Dave smiles and keeps reading
'  --  -- Dave sits on the toilet, reading his novel and taking a leisurely shit
We hear the clean - of a solid poo hitting the toilet water, and Dave closes his eyes, nice
-- Dave, in a Dodgers jersey, tees off on baseballs in a batting cage
It feels great
--   -- Dave, holding a cross-bow and wearing a loincloth, has fake sex with his - on a jungle set; their mid-sections are conveniently obscured by a giant fern
Dave is selling it, and when Valtan calls cut, the whole applauds, wildly impressed
Dave waves them off, bashful
: '  -- Looking hip in jeans, flip flops, and a mildly ironic tee shirt, Dave breezes into his office to find Mitch, in a pressed suit, intently studying a legal casebook at his desk
Well, well, look who's all growns up
93
Dave crashes on the couch, happy
Mitch looks annoyed: Really
Open-toed sandals at work
Are
Are you kidding me
Look,  can't hang right now, okay
've got the mediation in like ten minutes
Dave stands right back up, surprised and impressed
Wow
Okay
Well,  just wanted t tell you that if you can get a protracted buyout for anything over 700 million dollars, take it, okay
700 million, you got it
(heading for the door) Also,  wanted to thank you for setting me up with Sabrina
She's amazing
can't wait to see her -- What
Dave: No
You can't, you have to wait at least a week
Dave reaches for his cellphone as he heads out the door
Which reminds me,  wanted to call to see if she got the flowers
You sent her flowers after one date
Are you retarded
Do not get me into a relationship, dude
Too late
Dave is already gone
Mitch scowls
Then: (') You can come out now, Gladys
second later, , in a form-fitting suit and a sexy new bob, crawls out from under his desk
Mitch zips up his pants
94
(') Look, honey,  don't think this is -- Gladys  him by the tie and gets in his face, wild-eyed: haven't had sex in 34 years
This isn't over tit  su e' it's over
-Fine, but can you please stop following me to the bathroom and calling my house late at night and sending me all those filthy emails
It's, you know, deeply disturbing
You need to realize something, boy: (whispering in his ear) fucking own you now
The old lady aggressively makes out with Mitch
Her tongue roams from his mouth and madly licks his face, neck, and forehead
Eventually they separate
Mitch looks stunned
(') left you a little souvenir in your pocket
She winks and exits
Mitch tentatively reaches into his pocket and pulls out a giant pair of

Sitting across from them are , Mitch, Flemming Steel , and a bevy of Amalgamated execs
No one speaks
It's a corporate staredown
Then the mediator,  , 50's, enters, all business: 95
Thank you all for coming
My name is Erin Walsh and  will be mediating your claim today
Mitch makes the "'m gonna slit your fucking throat" gesture to Ken Kinkabe, who recoils, what the
: : -- The mediation has broken into two separate rooms
The Amalgamated team sits in their shirtsleeves, waiting in tense silence

They've been here a while

14 sandwiches and 9 Diet Slice's
Pay up, cocksucker
An  gives him a 5 dollar bill
Mitch waves it in the air and  the Olympic theme song
Flemming just glares at him like, you're so fired
Then the mediator enters
Kinkabe agrees in principle to the terms of the sale, and valuates your company at 725 million dollars
This is their last and final offer
'll be outside
She exits
Ted Norton looks at Flemming, intense
It's a fair deal
don't think we'll get much more out of them
The other execs all nod
Then Mitch : Fuck that, dude, you can do better
beg your pardon
Shut your mouth, Lockwood--
96
Look, this is just like when you're trying to fuck a Jewish girl and she keeps saying "no, no,  don't want to, 'm really drunk and you're not circumcised" but then she keeps making out with you and not getting out of your Fiero so you know she really does want it, she just needs to be nudged a bit more so she can rationalize it to herself and to her God, know what mean
This is just like that
Everyone in the room is speechless
Mitch opens another soda
(') Jesus  do not feel good
How is this
at all
like that
If this was really their final offer, they'd leave
Instead, they're sticking around, which means they have more money to spend
Ted looks at his execs
It's not a terrible point
How much more do you think we can get out of them
10 million
15
Fuck it, homey, go for 100
What
Do not listen to him, Ted, he is beyond reckless
If we make too large a counter-offer, we risk driving them away
Enh, can't hurt to ask
You wouldn't believe the nasty shit get girls to do just by asking
Honestly, it's revolting
97
Ted looks genuinely torn
He dabs his sweaty brow
(') Seriously, does anyone have a Pepto
Because 'm gonna throw
Finally, Ted opens the door and says to the mediator: Tell Kinkabe we want an extra 100 million and that is our final offer, because we're leaving
(loudly, to his execs) Fuel the jet
Let's go
The mediator heads off as the execs start packing up their briefcases, bluffing
Mitch points at Ted
Nice, bro
Way to show some sack
You had better be right, son, or else  am most definitely fired
Hey, me too
Bones
He extends his fist
Ted ignores him and gathers his things
-- Ted Norton and all his execs hurry out of the building, briefcases in hand, looking ashen
They head for their long line of idling limos
Ted hisses to Flemming: can't believe we just walked away from 725 million dollars
For the record,  did not support --: Mr
Norton
Sir
They turn to see the mediator jogging out of the building
Sir, Mr
Kinkabe has agreed to the 825 million
The deal is closed
98
shocked  rises up from the execs
Hugs and handshakes all around
Ted pumps Mitch's hand, ecstatic
Helluva job
owe you my life
Fuck it
Helping ridiculously rich people become even more ridiculously rich is why  go to work every day
Well, you are bar none the best attorney 've ever worked with
am
Fuck, 've never really been good at anything before
Mitch considers this a second, then laughs, proud
(') Gimme me a hug you tiny capitalist
Mitch hugs Ted and lifts him off the ground, spinning him
(') love you so much
: -- perfect, sunny day game at Dodgers stadium
Dave and Sabrina take their seats behind home plate
() These are your grandfather's seats
Yeah, my family's been coming to Dodger games since they moved here from Brooklyn in '58
Dave looks at her, his amazement only growing
Really
Who's your favorite Dodger
Fernando, obviously
99
Blown away, Dave unzips his jacket to reveal a throwback number 34 Fernando Valenzuela jersey
She laughs
(') No way
It's too soon to say  love you, right
That's against the rules
she laughs and kisses him
You're cute
Smiling, Dave looks out at the perfect ball field, his arm around Sabrina-he looks profoundly
existentially
happy
And then his iPhone
He answers it: Mitch Planko who the fuck is this
: sitting at her desk, talking on the phone and doing off a can of Reddi-Wip; twenty empty cans litter her desk
This is Carla Nelson from the Los Angeles Department of Parks
Oh my God, hi
Dave steps away to take the call
Carla does another whippet
(') What's
going on
We found that fountain
It's in our San Pedro warehouse
Dave glances back at Sabrina
and winces, conflicted: And
and how long is it going to be there
It ships out tonight for repairs
100
And after that
(doing another whippet) No fucking clue, dude
Dave gets a
Right
Okay, well thanks, Carla
(clicking over to other line) Hello
: He's walking down the hall of his law firm, on the phone, as all of his peers step from their offices,  his victory, slapping him on the back, shaking his hand
You hear about the fountain
Yeah
We should probably switch back, huh
Mitch high-fives a co-worker
Sure
Right
mean
the funny thing is
was just starting to enjoy your life a little bit
Yeah, and  was just starting to enjoy yours, too
Really
Really
So
maybe we should keep going--
'm so glad you said that
'm so glad  said that too
Your life rocks
() 101
(') just closed the Amalgamated deal for 825 million dollars and for the first time ever, people actually respect me
It's so weird
Word is they're going to make me partner tonight
love your life, dude
And  love yours
All the free time and the fun activities and 'm really growing as an actor and think Sabrina might actually have intercourse with me tonight
Dude, you sent her flowers -- she's gonna fuck you like a crack whore on rent day
So, wait, what are we talking about here
Staying like this
forever: No
Course not
Right
That's crazy
Beat
Is it though
Mitch bumps fists with smiling co-workers
Dave watches Sabrina  after a base hit
It's so strange, when the change-up happened, we were so focussed on switching back into our bodies that we didn't even consider that this might be exactly what we both needed
Yeah, we're fucking morons
All right, well, see ya, Dave
Take it easy, Mitch
102
They both hang up, surprised smiles on their faces
: - blankets Los Angeles that night
It's an epic storm
-- The private back room of this upscale Beverly Hills eatery is filled with the esteemed  of Steel, Kuhbach, McCloud, as well as Mitch, Jamie, and little Cara
Everyone's dressed to the nines and enjoying fabulously overpriced food and drink
Then Flemming stands and  his wine glass
Good evening, one and all
The room quiets as a   lowers behind him
(') We are gathered here tonight to celebrate the newest partner in our esteemed firm
For those of you who haven't had the pleasure of working with this brilliant young man, we've prepared this short, mildly embarrassing presentation to introduce him
Please, enjoy
Mitch looks at Jamie, who smiles conspiratorially
Behind the table, Gladys turns on a projector
Some Dido song plays as, on the , we start to see  from Dave's life
(') David Andrew Lockwood was born on February 1st, 1974, in Palmdale
of Dave as a baby appear
Everyone 's
Jamie takes Mitch's hand
(') Dave was a sweet, diligent, hard- working little boy
of boyhood Dave in a very dorky 70's Little League outfit flashes onto the screen
(') In high school, Dave belonged to over 17 clubs and teams, and graduated first in his class
103
play of Dave in 80's high school apparel, arguing for the debate team, wearing a goofy beret at French Club, etc
Everyone
Jamie smiles at Mitch, only he looks a little troubled: this is not my life
(') After winning a full scholarship to Princeton, Dave amazingly graduated in just three years
of college-age Dave getting his diploma appears
(') And, after graduating from Yale Law School with high honors, Dave clerked for Justice Souter on the United States Supreme Court
of young Dave talking with Justice Souter plays
Around the table, the partners , impressed
Mitch grows increasingly uncomfortable, shifting in his seat
(') Shortly after, Dave returned west to marry his lifelong best friend, Jamie Anne Johnson
roll of Dave and Jamie on their wedding day, laughing
Jamie squeezes Mitch's hand, a happy mist in her eyes
Mitch frowns: this is not my wife
(') Cara came along first, followed by the twins, Peter and Sarah
of Dave, wearing scrubs, happily holding his various newborn babies in the hospital flash onto the screen
Cara leans over to Mitch and whispers: Look, Daddy, it's you and me
Mitch forces a tight smile, right
And somewhere along the way, we were lucky enough to find him
104
roll of Dave as a lawyer, swearing in at the Bar, arguing in court, and, finally, celebrating today's victory
The image fades as the lights in the room slowly rise
(') Industrious
Ambitious
Honorable
They were true of him then, they are even more true of him now
It is my distinct honor to introduce our newest partner, David Lockwood
The room breaks into heartfelt
: Mitch squirms, hating this
Jamie leans over to him: 'm so proud of you, baby
You worked so hard for this
Mitch winces, knowing just how wrong she is
All around him, the partners stand,
Mitch stands, a bit dizzy
-'m sorry
just
He hurries off towards the bathroom
Everyone looks confused
: '  -- Rain pours down outside
Then Dave and Sabrina, soaking wet in their Dodgers gear, run into the apartment
Oh my god, 'm soaking-- (taking in barren apartment) Wait, are you a single guy
Dave laughs and throws her a towel from the bathroom
She starts drying her hair
(') need a beer and some dry clothes
When Dave passes her, though, she stops him, and starts kissing him
105
(') Or maybe
mmm
maybe just a beer
: -- '  -- Mitch stands in the restaurant's upscale men's room, staring at himself in the mirror, lost
What am  doing
This isn't my life
Good evening, Mr
Lockwood
He spins to see Gladys in the doorway, vamping, sexy
Oh no
Gladys, not now-- (approaching, coy) 'm not wearing any bloomers
thought we talked about not using -- She throws him against the bathroom wall and starts aggressively undressing him
What's bothering you, Mr
Lockwood
Look, Gladys,  love bathroom sex as much as the next guy, but-- She  in his face, crazy-eyed
'
(wiping face, a bit scared) -Okay
Well,  guess what's bothering me is
didn't earn any of this, you know
Gladys rips open his shirt and starts licking his chest downward until she disappears
106
(') And  know what you're thinking: Mitch, not earning things never used to bother you, why does it bother you now
And the answer is: maybe 'm growing up
We hear the sound of his pants
(') mean, sure,  closed the deal today, and that felt good, but didn't put in all the years of hard work that got Dave to this point, you know
Plus, those aren't my adorable kids, that's not my beautiful wife, you're not even my freaky deaky old lady secretary want to earn this stuff-- Just then      -- and stops cold: to see that Gladys is in the Reverse Wheelbarrow position, her palms on the bathroom floor, her feet against the bathroom wall, with Mitch between her legs, his pants around his ankles
Mitch sees his boss -- and freezes
Uh oh
Mitch and Gladys disengage and straighten themselves
Sir, it's not my fault--
Have you forgotten everything you learned in law school
You can't screw a direct hire
How can we possibly make you a partner now
You're completely exposed--
We hear a  from the doorway
Everyone turns to see Jamie -- she's heard the whole thing
Mitch quickly zips his pants
107
thought you might be having an affair
but not with Gladys: Age-ist
Jamie, you gotta believe me, this woman is a predator--
You know what
No
can't do this anymore
want you out of the house by the time the kids wake up
Jamie--
Too late
She runs off, choking back tears
-- Fastening his belt, Mitch sprints out of the restaurant, desperate -- but Jamie is already  away in her car
Fuck
He stands in the rain, overcome with self-loathing
: '  -- Dave, in dry clothes, sits on his couch, happily drinking a beer and watching SportsCenter
He calls into the bedroom
You find anything that fits
Then Sabrina appears in the doorway, wearing one of his old tee shirts-and panties
and nothing else
she's unreal
This is all  could find
(-) Holy shit
As she bends over to dim the lamp, her tee shirt rides up -- exposing her perfectly tan, arched back
108
(') (hyperventilating, to himself) Please don't come, please don't -- And then he stops short
On Sabrina's lower back is a cute tramp stamp tattoo of a
(') Oh my God: a Many-Spotted Skipperlinq
And everything comes rushing back
His family
His wife
His entire life
He looks overcome with emotion
Sabrina notices as she slides onto the couch with him
Is everything okay, baby
Yeah, no,  just
Dave rubs his temples, overwhelmed
(') can't do this
Why not--
Just then the door flies open and soaking wet, hysterical, her mascara running all over
Dave is cheating on me
Dave quickly covers his hard-on with a pillow
No 'm not
'm so not
How could you lie to me, Mitch
We've known each other for--
Then Jamie sees scantily-clad Sabrina and stops
(') Oh
109
( ) Who is this chick
(stammering, pointing) Umm
she's
uh
this just got very complicated
'm sorry -- 'm Jamie, the wife of one of Mitch's friends
Wait, Jamie Lockwood
Dave's wife
You know the prick
Yeah, we work together
He cheated on you
Yes, with his secretary, Gladys
What
Of all the women in the office, he picked her
Slightly awkward beat
Look, Jamie,  didn't know about Gladys,  swear
But 'm sure she means absolutely nothing to Dave--
No
No more excuses
The next time you see my asshole husband tell him that  will never
Ever
Take him back, you got that
Dave nods quickly, terrified
(') Sabrina
It was nice to meet you
110
Barely holding it together, Jamie wheels and exits, the door behind her
Dave just stands there, holy shit
: '  --  -- Mitch sadly packs children's snacks and Capri Sun's into a duffel bag in the darkened kitchen, hating himself
Then: Daddy
Mitch turns to see Cara, small and fragile in the doorway
(') What are you doing
Oh, angel, it's nothing
'm just going away for a little while
Why
It's
confusing grown-up stuff-- Try me
-Okay
Well
'm leaving because 'm a fuck up
Do you know what a fuck up is
() Like Uncle Mitch
Right
Right
Well,  thought this time was different, you know thought  actually did something right for once
But no, 'm still the same old fuck up 've always been
Only this time  really fucking fucked up, because  fucked up my life and my best friend's life
Mitch zips up his bag, full of regret -- and finds Cara hugging his leg
don't think you're a fuck up
He crouches down and looks at her, getting choked up
Thanks, sweetie, but your brain is the size of a radish
am a fuck up
always have been, and always will be
Guys like me, we know how to have fun, but we don't know how to do the important stuff, you know
Be good, okay, kiddo
She nods, confused
He kisses her head and exits, emotional
: -- The rain still pours down
Jamie, tears streaking her face, drives home in stop-and-go traffic
Then, through her side window, we see Dave sprinting alongside her car, waving
Not seeing him, she accelerates forward and Dave disappears from view
until she stops, and Dave catches up again: (') Still not seeing him, Jamie accelerates onto 101 where the stop-and-go traffic moves only slightly faster
Jamie continues quietly  to herself
Then we see 101 in the driving rain, waving his hands and yelling
Finally, she glances over, sees Dave -- and startles: Mitch
112
Jamie, stunned, pulls onto the shoulder and stops
second later, Dave hops into the car, soaking wet and panting
What is the matter with you
Look,  know  haven't been a very good husband or father recently
What are you talking about--
But 'm done looking over the fence for something better
've seen what's on the other side, and it's great
and young
and supple
but it's not you
And the truth is there will always be another fence with shinier toys on the other side, but the only way to be happy is to say fuck the fence and just appreciate what you have, you know
Find the fun with what you got
-Okay
'm so sorry  stopped appreciating you, pumpkin
love you
And love our weird little kids
And can't believe  ever thought that wasn't enough
Why
are you calling me pumpkin
And then he kisses her
She resists-- (') Mitch--
But he holds her firm
And soon she's kissing him back, confused and overwhelmed and crying
It's emotional and intense for him, too
They finally separate, but remain inches apart, breathing hard
113
Jamie stares into his eyes, amazed: (') Dave
Dave nods
Jamie squints, trying to understand
(') But
how
Dave shakes his head,  don't know
(') So
then
Mitch was the one
with Gladys
Dave nods again
Jamie looks relieved
Then she stops
(') Wait, so who was that hot young thing back in the apartment
Nothing happened,  swear
Okay
But-we're going to need to talk about this
Yes
Totally
Like, a lot
Like, a-therapy-lot
Absolutely: therapy, trust falls, The Landmark Forum, Eat Pray Love, 'll do whatever the fuck you want, Jamie,  just want you back
She smiles and kisses him again
And then again
kind of like kissing Mitch
Yeah,  noticed
'm not sure how feel about this
(giggling, kissing him again) So
mmm
so what do we do now
114
Dave suddenly remembers the fountain and looks at his watch
Oh shit
We gotta go
: -- As the rain tapers off, Jamie rockets through , running red lights, skidding through turns, splashing through puddles
'  -- Jamie and Dave squeal up to their house to see Mitch, out front, sadly trying to pack a Barcalounger into his Ferrari
Mitch
Get in
Dave
Get in
(squinting inside car) Is that Jamie
Get in the fucking car, dipshit
Mitch, terrified, sprints to the car and hops in
'   -- Jamie races through  at 80 mph
Dave sits shotgun, and Mitch sits in the back, wide-eyed, scared: So, um, are you guys driving me to the desert to kill me
No
Jamie knows about the change- up
We're all good
It suddenly makes a lot more sense why you spent so much time rubbing my breastfeeding cream onto my boobs every night
115
Really, dude
was just
trying to be helpful
Oh, and what about that time you--
You know what
don't want to know
Let's just hope we get to the warehouse before they ship off our fountain
Off Dave's concerned look we : --  -- The Port of Los Angeles never sleeps
Huge diesel cranes load and unload freighters as tractor trailers  to and fro
-- The street is lined with
Beat
Then Jamie skids around the corner, Tokyo Drift-style, in her station wagon
(
) There it is
Jamie screeches up to a warehouse labelled ; she, Mitch and Dave pile out of the car and run into where they sprint down the towering aisles, past park signs, swingsets, jungle gyms -- and finally, fountains
(') There
Four  pack the    into a large wooden crate for transport
Jamie, Mitch and Dave run over to them
Wait
Stop
The workmen stop packing the fountain, confused
We
We need that fountain
116
#1 You
need this fountain
Yes
We have to pee in it
It's a magic fountain
The workmen just look at them, deadpan
Then Dave reaches into his wallet and starts pulling out -- : with their pants down around their ankles
Dave starts Mitch doesn't
Dave hisses at him: Come on, open the floodgates
can't pee with them watching
to the workmen, standing nearby, looking at Mitch and Dave like they're total freaks
Well  can't keep going forever
Mitch tilts his head back and quietly sings to himself: The sun is shining all the time, Looks like another perfect day, love
We love it
love
Are you singing Randy Newman--
Then we hear a second stream of  hit the fountain
Oh thank god
Okay, quick, we have to hug
(glancing back at workmen) Do we, though
117
Yes, we have to do everything exactly the same
Come on
As they scootch together and put their arms around each other, Mitch calls over to the workmen: Just so you know, this isn't gay
Our penises aren't even touching--
Come on: " wish  had my old life back" on three
One, two: wish  had my old life  wish  had my old life back
back
The lights in the warehouse flicker
Dave and Mitch finish peeing and slowly zip up, exchanging a worried look
You think it worked
How the fuck should  know
(waving to workmen) Thank you
Have a pleasant evening
: Then we hear a baby
Then we hear a second baby join in, even more shrill than the first
Finally, we hear the worst two words a parent can ever hear: (
) Your turn
: (
) Dave turns on the light, rushes over to the mirror, and touches his face, overjoyed, clearly back in the right body
118
(') Oh thank God
Thank God
Pumpkin, it worked
'm back
(groggy, half-asleep) Great, go feed the fucking babies
She rolls over and goes back to sleep
He grins and runs out
-- Dave cheerfully sings as he changes Sarah's diaper
You just vomited on my hand but love yooooou
-- Dave bounces down the hallway, a twin in each arm, into each of his ears and taking turns kicking his balls
and he's grinning
In fact, he couldn't look happier
: '  -- Mitch slowly wakes up in his empty apartment
He stares at the blank walls, a little bummed
Then he startles when  rolls over, looking ravishing
Last night was weird
Wasn't it
So
are you ever going to have sex with me
( ) Yes
Yes  am
'  -- Jamie is cleaning up the toys in the living room -- when Dave nuzzles up to her from behind, seductive
119
The twins are down for their nap, Cara is watching The Backyardigans
Jamie raises her eyebrow, oh
It's Tuesday
know
It's Tuesday morning
Tuesdays, Wednesdays, mornings, late night, 'm like Denny's, baby, 'm open 24-7
She laughs, and he scoops her up and heads upstairs
: '  -- The sun sets over
The  in the air and the cars lining the street tell us that Dave is hosting a party
'  -- "    ,
" banner hangs from the swingset
Kids race about as adults drink, eat, and mingle
Dave, in jeans and a tee shirt, works the barbecue and talks to Mitch, in a jacket and tie, as he adjusts his crotch: still can't get used to the whole underwear thing
It's such a -- Just then  runs up and hugs her Dad
Hi Daddy
Sugar-bug
How's my favorite ballerina
120
Cara turns, takes Mitch's hand, and flips him onto his back
'm not a ballerina anymore, bitch
She races off
Mitch painfully pulls himself to his feet
Jesus fucking Christ
Dave sees , looking angelic in a sundress, chatting with a circle of  on the patio
So
How's it going with Sabrina
Great
We just celebrated our two week anniversary
Wow
Good for you
Mitch nods, proud,  know
Swigs his beer
You think she's fucking Fernando Valenzuela
We see that the man she's talking to is, in fact, Dodger great  , in a pimped-out white suit
Maybe
'm oddly okay with it
can't believe they're family friends
know
She really is perfect-- Just then  and   approach, wheeling her newborn  in a pram
gotta go feed her baby, but congrats on your new gig, bro
121
Thanks, Kiefer
See you guys
Mitch kisses Tatiana on the cheek and they head off
(') It's creepy that Kiefer Sutherland is like way into other people's babies, right
Oh yeah
Dave flips the burgers
Thanks again for hooking me up with the job at Amalgamated, man
Hey, the  owed me a favor
think 'm really going to crush it in corporate America
think so too
Just then, '  approaches
,
'm heading out
Thanks for having me
Mitch, Sr
pulls his son into an emotional hug
,
(') love you, Mitch
love you too, Dad
They break apart
Mitch, Sr
heads off
Then he stops
Turns
,
Hey Mitch
Mitch turns
,
(') 'm real proud of you
122
Mitch nods, trying not to show how much this means to him
Mitch, Sr
, heads off
Mitch and Dave stand side by side, reflective
Is it weird that  miss your penis
Not really
