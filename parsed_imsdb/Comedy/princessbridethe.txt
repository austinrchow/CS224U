Pale, one sick cookie

He holds a remote in one hand, presses it, and the video game moves a little bit

His room is monochromatic, greys and blues, mildly high-tech

(Book open now, be begins to read
) The Princess Bride, by
Morgenstern
Chapter One
Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin
: The story he's reading about, as the monochromatic look of the bedroom is replaced by the dazzling color of the English countryside
(off-screen) Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there
His name was Westley, but she never called him that
(to the kid) Isn't that a wonderful beginning
(off-screen doing his best) Yeah
It's really good
(off-screen reading) Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around
: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            4
- is standing, holding the reins of her horse, while in the background, , in the stable doorway, looks at her
Buttercup is in her late teens; doesn't care much about clothes and she hates brushing her long hair, so she isn't as attractive as she might be, but she's still probably the most beautiful woman in the world
Farm boy
Polish my horse's saddle
want to see my face shining in it by morning
(quietly, watching her) As you wish
Westley is perhaps half a dozen years older than Buttercup
And maybe as handsome as she is beautiful
He gazes at her as she walks away
(off-screen) "As you wish" was all he ever said to her
: , outside, chopping wood
Buttercup drops two large buckets near him
Farm Boy
Fill these with water -- (a beat) --please
As you wish
She leaves; his eyes stay on her
She stops, turns -- he manages to look away as now her eyes stay on him
(off-screen) That day, she was amazed to discover that when he was saying, "As you wish," what he meant was, " love you
" : ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            5
- Westley enters with an armload of firewood
(off-screen) And even more amazing was the day she realized she truly loved him back
(pointing to a pitcher that she could reach herself) Farm Boy, fetch me that pitcher
He gets it, hands it to her; they are standing very close to each other gazing into each other's eyes
As you wish
Now he turns, moves outside
: , outside his tiny hovel in the red glow of sunset
They are locked in a passionate kiss
(off-screen) -hold it, hold it- : ' What is this
Are you trying to trick me
-- Where's the sports
-- Is this a kissing book
-- wait, just wait -- -- well, when does it get good
Keep your shirt on
Let me read
(reading again) Westley had no money for marriage
So he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea
: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            6
They stand near the gate to the farm, locked in an embrace
(off-screen reading) It was a very emotional time for Buttercup -- (off-screen groaning) don't be-leeve this
fear 'll never see you again
Of course you will
But what if something happens to you
Hear this now:  will come for you
But how can you be sure
This is true love
You think this happens every day
He smiles at her, she smiles too, throws her arms so tightly around him
They kiss
Then as Westley walks away, Buttercup watches him go
(off-screen reading) Westley didn't reach his destination
His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive
When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered -- (off-screen, perking up a little) -- murdered by pirates is good -- : : Buttercup, staring out the window of her room
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            7
(off-screen) She went into her room and shut the door
And for days, she neither slept nor ate
(no emotion at all in her voice) will never love again
, perfect and perfectly sad
: - The main courtyard of Florin replete with townspeople, livestock, and a bustling marketplace
(off-screen reading) Five years later, the main square of Florin City was filled as never before to hear the announcement of the great Prince Humperdinck's bride-to be
: , a man of incredible power and bearing, standing in his royal robes on a castle balcony
Three others standing behind him: an   with crowns, the aging   , and a dark bearded man who seems the Prince's match in strength: this is
(raises his hands, starts to speak) My people
a month from now, our country will have its 500th anniversary
On that sundown, shall marry a lady who was once a commoner like yourselves -- (pause) -- but perhaps you will not find her common now
Would you like to meet her
And the answering  booms like summer thunder
: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            8
giant staircase leading to the  and as a  just begins to become visible, : , as they see the figure
(We haven't yet
) And if there is such a thing as collective action, then this crowd, collectively, holds its breath
: , as the figure appears in the archway
It is Buttercup
And she resplendent
My people
the Princess Buttercup
She descends the stairs and starts to move amongst the people
: , and they do a very strange thing: with no instruction at all, they suddenly go to their knees
Great waves of people kneeling and -- : , terribly moved
She stands immobile among her subjects, blinking back tears
on her beauty for a moment
(off-screen) Buttercup's emptiness consumed her
Although the law of the land gave Humperdinck the right to choose his bride, she did not love him
: -- and Buttercup, barreling along, controlling her horse easily
(off-screen) Despite Humperdinck's reassurance that she would grow to love him, the only joy she found was in her daily ride
: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            9
- Lovely, quiet, deserted
Buttercup suddenly reins in
word, my lady
: , standing close together in the path
Beyond them can be seen the waters of Florin Channel
The three men are not your everyday commuter types
Standing in front is a tiny man with the most angelic face
He is Sicilian and his name is
Beside him is a Spaniard, erect and taut as a blade of steel
His name is
Beside him is a giant
His name is
We are but poor, lost circus performers
Is there a village nearby
There is nothing nearby; not for miles
Then there will be no one to hear you scream- He nods to the giant, Fezzik, who merely reaches over, touches a nerve on Buttercup's neck, and the start of a scream is all she manages --unconsciousness comes that fast
As she starts to fall -- : sailboat is moored
It's dusk now, shadows are long
Inigo, the Spaniard, busies himself getting the boat ready
: The giant Fezzik carries Buttercup, unconscious, on board
Vizzini rips some tiny pieces of fabric from an army jacket and tucks them along the saddle of Buttercup's horse
There is about the entire operation a sense of tremendous skill and precision
What is that you're ripping
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           10
(not stopping or turning) It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder
Who's Guilder
(pointing straight out) The country across the sea
The sworn enemy of Florin
(slaps the horse's rump) Go
The horse takes off
They start for the boat
Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love
When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed
You never said anything about killing anyone
Vizzini hops onto the boat
've hired you to help me start a war
That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition
just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl
(whirling on Fezzik) Am  going mad or did the word "think" escape your lips
You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass
agree with Fezzik
: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           11
: Vizzini, in a fury
(We only thought he was in a fury --now he's really getting mad) Oh
The sot has spoken
What happens to her is not truly your concern --  will kill her -- (louder) And remember this -- never forget this -- : , as Vizzini advances on them
Nothing shows on Inigo's face, but  is panicked by Vizzini
(to Inigo) -- when  found you, you were so slobbering drunk you couldn't buy brandy -- (now to Fezzik, who retreats as much as he can while Vizzini advances) -- and you -- friendless, brainless, helpless, hopeless -- Do you want me to send you back to where you were, unemployed in Greenland
Vizzini glares at him, then turns, leaves them
During this, Inigo has gone close to , who is very distressed at the insults he's just received
As Inigo casts off
(softly) That Vizzini, he can fuss
(a slight emphasis on the last word) (looking at Inigo) fuss
fuss
(Suddenly, he's got it again, emphasis on the last word
) think he likes to scream at us
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           12
Probably he means no harm
He's really very short on charm
(proudly) Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme
Yes, some of the time
(he starts to smile) (whirling on them) Enough of that
As they sail off, we hear their voices as the boat recedes
, are there rocks ahead
If there are, we'll all be dead
No more rhymes now,  mean it
Anybody want a peanut
As Vizzini screams we: : Inigo is at the helm,  stands near the body of the princess, whose eyelids flutter slightly -- or do they
Vizzini sits motionless
The waves are higher, there are only occasional flashes of moon slanting down between clouds
(to Inigo) We'll reach the Cliffs by dawn
Inigo nods, glances back
Why are you doing that
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           13
Making sure nobody's following us
That would be inconceivable
Despite what you think, you will be caught
And when you are, the Prince will see you all hanged
Vizzini turns a cold eye on the Princess
Of all the necks on this boat, Highness, the one you should be worrying about is your own
Inigo keeps staring behind them
Stop doing that
We can all relax, it's almost over- You're sure nobody's following us
As  told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable
No one in Guilder knows what we've done
And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast
Out of curiosity, why do you ask
No reason
It's only,  just happened to look behind us, and something is there
What
And suddenly the three whirl, stare back and as they do -- : It's hard to see; the moon is behind clouds now
But the wind whistles
And the waves pound
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           14
And suddenly it's all gone ominous
: , ,   squinting back, trying desperately to see
At this moment, they are all holding their breaths
: And there's still nothing to be seen
It's still ominous
Only now it's eerie too
Then -- The moon slips through and -- Inigo was right -- something is very much there
sailboat
Black
With a great billowing sail
Black
It's a good distance behind them, but it's coming like hell, closing the gap
: , , staring at the other boat
(explaining with as much logic as he can muster) Probably some local fisherman out for a pleasure cruise at night through eel-infested waters
And now as a sound comes from their boat they turn as we : , diving into the water, starting to swim away
: and Vizzini screaming
Go in, get after her
don't swim
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15
(to the unasked question) only dog paddle
Veer left
Left
Left
: still close to the boat, switching from a crawl to a silent breast stroke
The wind dies and as it does, something new is heard
not-too-distant high-pitched shrieking sound
Buttercup stops suddenly, treads water
: Do you know what that sound is, Highness
Those are the Shrieking Eels -- if you doubt me, just wait
They always grow louder when they're about to feed on human flesh
: , treading water, still not far from the boat
The shrieking sounds are getting louder and more terrifying
Buttercup stays silent
: If you swim back now,  promise, no harm will come to you
doubt you will get such an offer from the Eels
: , and she's a gutsy girl
The shrieking sound is louder still, but she doesn't make a sound
Behind her now, something dark and gigantic slithers past
She's scared, sure, petrified, who wouldn't be, but she makes no reply -- -- and now a   has zeroed in on her -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           16
-- and now she sees it, a short distance away, circling, starting to close -- -- and Buttercup is frozen, trying not to make a movement of any kind -- -- and the Eel slithers closer, closer -- -- and Buttercup knows it now, there's nothing she can do, it's over, all over -- -- and now the Eel opens its mouth wide, and it's never made such a noise, and as its great jaws are about to clamp down -- (off-screen) She doesn't get eaten by the Eels at this time
And the second we hear him: : ' The Kid looks the same, pale and weak, but maybe he's gripping the sheets a little too tightly with his hands
What
The Eel doesn't get her
'm explaining to you because you looked nervous
Well,  wasn't nervous
His Grandfather says nothing, just waits
Well, maybe  was a little bit concerned
But that's not the same thing
Because  can stop now if you want
No
You could read a little bit more
if you want
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           17
He grips the sheets again, as the Grandfather picks up the book
(reading) "Do you know what that sound is, Highness
" : We're back in the boat
Those are the Shrieking Eels
(off-screen) We're past that, Grandpa
: ' You read it already
Oh
Oh my goodness,  did
'm sorry
Beg your pardon
: treading water
(off-screen) All right, all right, let's see
Uh, she was in the water, the Eel was coming after her
She was frightened
The Eel started to charge her
And then - And we're back where we were at the last moment we saw her, Buttercup frozen, the Shrieking Eel, jaws wide, about to clamp down as we : ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           18
pounding the Eel unconscious in one move, then easily lifting Buttercup
The boat and , Buttercup being deposited on the deck
Put her down
Just put her down
: pointing behind them
think he's getting closer
Vizzini, tying Buttercup's hands
He's no concern of ours
Sail on
(to Buttercup) suppose you think you're brave, don't you
(staring deep at him) Only compared to some
: The boat at dawn, being followed closely by the black sailboat, which we can see for the first time is being sailed by a   , and his boat almost seems to be flying
Look
He's right on top of us wonder if he is using the same wind we are using
Whoever he is, he's too late -- (pointing ahead of them) -- see
(big) The Cliffs of Insanity
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19
And once he's said the name-- : - They rise straight up, sheer from the water, impossibly high
: in a wild race for the Cliffs and the Man In Black is closing faster than ever, but not fast enough, the lead was too great to overcome, and as Inigo sails with great precision straight at the Cliffs : being pursued
Hurry up
Move the thing
Um
that other thing
Move it
(staring back now) We're safe -- only  is strong enough to go up our way -- he'll have to sail around for hours 'til he finds a harbor
There is much activity going on, all of it swift, expert, economical
reaches up along the Cliff face, grabs a jutting rock, reaches behind it
Suddenly there is a thick rope in his hands
He drops back to the boat, gives the rope a freeing swing and : The rope goes all the way to the top
: hurrying to
He straps a harness to him, then lifts Buttercup and Vizzini in the harness
Finally, he himself gets in the harness
All three are strapped to  like papooses
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           20
And he starts to ascend the rope, carrying them all along with him as he goes
: , sailing in toward the Cliffs of Insanity, watching as  rises swiftly through the first moments of dawn
: - '  is only faintly visible far below
This is the first time we've gotten the real vertigo feeling and it's a gasper
: Buttercup is almost out of her mind with fear
: is moving right along; however high they are, he's already over a third of the way done
: leaping from his ship to the rope, starting to climb
He's impossibly far behind, but the way he goes you'd think he didn't know that because he is flying up the rope, hand over hand like lightning
: (looking down) He's climbing the rope
And he's gaining on us
Inconceivable
He prods , who nods, increases his pace
: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           21
roaring up the rope, and : - -- and the Man In Black is cutting deeply into 's lead
: (shrieking) Faster
thought  was going faster
You were supposed to be this colossus
You were this great, legendary thing
And yet he gains
Well, 'm carrying three people
And he's got only himself
(cutting through) --  do not accept excuses
(shaking his head) 'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all
(hurt) Don't say that, Vizzini
Please
And his arms begin moving much more slowly
: His arms still work as before
If anything, he has speeded up
's lead is smaller and smaller : ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           22
Maybe a hundred feet for  to go
Maybe more
: , and it's getting too close now
Did  make it clear that your job is at stake
: less than a hundred feet behind them
And gaining
: Vizzini leaps off and takes out a knife, begins to cut the rope which is tied around a great rock while Inigo helps the Princess to her feet and  just stands around, waiting for someone to tell him to do something
Nearby are some stone ruins
Once they might have been a fort, now the kind of resemble Stonehenge
: feet from the top now, maybe less -- maybe only 50 -- and his pace is as dazzling as before, and : cutting through the last of the rope and : slithering across the ground and out of sight toward the Channel, like some great serpent at last going home
: standing with Inigo and Buttercup by the cliff edge
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           23
(to Inigo -- impressed) He has very good arms
: hanging suspended hundreds of feet in the air, holding to the jagged rocks, desperately trying to cling to life
: stunned, turning to the others, looking down
He didn't fall
Inconceivable
(whirling on Vizzini) You keep using that word --  do not think it means what you think it means
(looks down again) My God
He's climbing
: and so he is
Very slowly, he is picking his way upwards, sometimes a foot at a time, sometimes an inch
: The group at the top, staring down
Whoever he is, he's obviously seen us with the Princess, and must therefore die
(to Fezzik) You, carry her
(to Inigo) We'll head straight for the Guilder frontier
Catch up when he's dead
If he falls, fine
If not, the sword
Inigo nods
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           24
want to duel him left-handed
You know what a hurry we're in
Well, it's the only way  can be satisfied
If  use my right -- tch -- over too quickly
(turns abruptly, starts off-screen) Oh, have it your way
: still creeping his way upward
: who goes to Inigo
You be careful
(gravely) -- people in masks cannot be trusted
(calling out) 'm waiting
nods, hurries after Vizzini
: He watches them depart, then turns, peers down over the Cliffs
He watches a moment, then paces, shaking his hands loose
He practices a few of his honed fencing skills
He is a taut and nervous fellow, and has never been one for waiting around
: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           25
climbing on
He must be six inches closer to the top than when last we saw him
Inigo is watching
: walking away
Finally he goes back to cliff edge, starts to talk
It's instant death if the Man In Black falls, but neither gives that possibility much credence
This is our two heroes meeting
They don't know it yet; but that's what it is
(hollering down) Hello there
The Man In Black glances up, kind of grunts
Slow going
Look,  don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks
So 'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me
Sorry
Thank you
Inigo steps away, draws his sword, loosens up with a few perfect thrusts
Then resheathes and looks eagerly over the edge again
do not suppose you could speed things up
(with some beat) If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26
could do that
In fact, 've got some rope up here
But  do not think that you will accept my help, since  am only waiting around to kill you
That does put a damper on our relationship
He finds another bold a few inches higher
But  promise  will not kill you until you reach the top
That's very comforting
But 'm afraid you'll just have to wait
hate waiting
could give you my word as a Spaniard
No good
've known too many Spaniards
And he just hangs there in space, resting, gathering his strength
You don't know any way you'll trust me
Nothing comes to mind
And on these words,   into a   on Inigo
He raises his right hand high, his eyes blaze, and his voice takes on a tone we have not heard before
swear on the soul of my father, Domingo Montoya, you will reach the top alive
: There is a pause
Then, quietly: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           27
Throw me the rope
: He dashes to the giant rock the rope was originally tied to
: as his grip loosens a moment, trying to cling to the side of the cliff
: now with a small coil of rope, hurries back to the edge and hurls it over -- : It hangs close to the Man In Black
He releases the rocks, grabs the rope, hangs helplessly in space a moment, then looks up at Inigo and -- : straining, forcing his body away from the cliff edge and -- : rising through the early morning light, slowly, steadily, and as the cliff top at last comes within reach -- : watching as the Man In Black crawls to safety, then looks to Inigo
(pulling his sword) Thank you
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           28
We'll wait until you're ready
Again
Thank you
The Man In Black sits to rest on the boulder that once held the rope
He tugs off his leather boots and is amazed to see several large rocks tumble out
The Man In Black wears gloves
Inigo stares at them
do not mean to pry, but you don't by any chance happen to have six fingers on your right hand
He glances up -- the question clearly baffles him
Do you always begin conversations this way
My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man
He was a great swordmaker, my father
And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job
He slaved a year before he was done
He hands his sword to the Man In Black
(fondling it-impressed) have never seen its equal
: - Even now, this still brings pain
The six-fingered man returned and demanded it, but at one-tenth his promised price
My father refused
Without a word, the six-fingered man slashed him through the heart
loved my father, so, naturally, challenged his murderer to a duel failed
() ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           29
(') the six-fingered man did leave me alive with the six-fingered sword, but he gave me these
He touches his scars
: looking up at Inigo
How old were you
was eleven years old
When was strong enough,  dedicated my life to the study of fencing
So the next time we meet,  will not fail
will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya
You killed my father
Prepare to die
" You've done nothing but study swordplay
More pursuit than study lately
You see,  cannot find him
It's been twenty years now
am starting to lose confidence just work for Vizzini to pay the bills
There's not a lot of money in revenge
(handing back the great sword, starting to rise) Well,  certainly hope you find him, someday
You are ready, then
Whether  am or not, you've been more than fair
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           30
You seem a decent fellow
hate to kill you
(walking away a few paces, unsheathing his sword) You seem a decent fellow
hate to die
Begin
And on that word -- : And what we are starting now is one of the two greatest sword fights in modern movies (the other one happens later on), and right from the beginning it looks different
Because they aren't close to each other -- none of the swordscrossing "en garde" garbage
No, what we have here is two men, two athletes, and they look to be too faraway to damage each other, but each time one makes even the tiniest feint, the other counters, and there is silence, and as they start to circle -- : - feinting here, feinting there and -- : finished teasing, begin to duel in earnest
Their swords cross, then again, again, and the sound comes so fast it's almost continual
Inigo presses on, the Man In Black retreating up a rocky incline
(thrilled) You're using Bonetti's defense against me, ah
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           31
thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain -- Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro
And he shifts his style now
(coping as best he can) -- naturally -- (suddenly shifting again) --but  find Thibault cancels out Capo Ferro, don't you
The Man In Black is now perched at the edge of the elevated castle ruin
No where to go, he jumps to the sand
Inigo stares down at him
Unless the enemy has studied his Agrippa- And now, with the grace of an Olympian, Inigo flies off the perch, somersaults clean over the Man In Black's head, and lands facing his opponent
-- which  have
The two men are almost flying across the rocky terrain, never losing balance, never coming close to stumbling; the battle rages with incredible finesse, first one and then the other gaining the advantage, and by now, it's clear that this isn't just two athletes going at it, it's a lot more that that
This is two legendary swashbucklers and they're in their prime, it's Burt Lancaster in "The Crimson Pirate" battling Errol Flynn in "Robin Hood" and then, incredibly, the action begins going even faster than before as we : And behind him now, drawing closer all the time, is the deadly edge of the Cliffs of Insanity
Inigo fights and ducks and feints and slashes and it all works, but not for long, as gradually the Man In Black keeps the advantage, keeps forcing Inigo back, closer and closer to death
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           32
(happy as a clam) You are wonderful
Thank you -- 've worked hard to become so
The Cliff edge is very close now
Inigo is continually being forced toward it
admit it -- you are better than am
Then why are you smiling
Inches from defeat, Inigo is, in fact, all smiles
Because  know something you don't know
And what is that
am not left-handed
And he throws the six-fingered sword into his right hand and immediately, the tide of battle turns
: stunned, doing everything be can to keep Inigo by the Cliff edge
But no use
Slowly at first, he begins to retreat
Now faster, Inigo is in control and the Man In Black is desperate
: and the six-fingered sword is all but invisible now, as he increases his attack, then suddenly switches styles again
: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           33
leading to a turret-shaped plateau, and the Man In Black is retreating like mad up the steps and he can't stop Inigo -- nothing can stop Inigo -- and in a frenzy, the Man In Black makes every feint, tries every thrust, lets go with all he has left
But he fails
Everything fails
He tries one or two final desperate moves but they are nothing
You're amazing
ought to be after twenty years
And now the Man In Black is smashed into a stone pillar, pinned there under the six fingered sword
(hollering it out) There's something  ought to tell you
Tell me
am not left-handed either
And now he changes hands, and at last, the battle is fully joined
: And to his amazement, he is being forced back down the steps
He tries one style, another, but it all comes down to the same thing -- the Man In Black seems to be in control
And before Inigo knows it, the six-fingered sword is knocked clear out of his hand
Inigo retreats, dives from the stairs to a moss-covered bar suspended over the archway
He swings out, lands, and scrambles to his sword and we : who watches Inigo, then casually tosses his sword to the landing where it sticks in perfectly
Then the Man In Black copies
Not copies exactly, improves
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           34
He dives to the bar, swings completely over it like a circus performer and dismounts with a backflip
: staring in awe
Who are you
No one of consequence
must know
Get used to disappointment
Okay
: moving like lightning, and he thrusts forward, slashes, darts back, all in almost a single movement and -- : Dodging, blocking, and again he thrusts forward, faster even than before, and again he slashes but -- : And there is never a move anyone makes he doesn't remember, and this time he blocks the slash, slashes out himself with the sixfingered sword
On it goes, back and forth across the rocky terrain, Inigo's feet moving with the grace and speed of a great improvisational dancer
: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           35
- as it is knocked free, arching up into the air, and -- : catching it again
And something terrible is written behind his eyes: he has given his all, done everything man can do, tried every style, made every maneuver, but it wasn't enough, and on his face for all to see is the realization that he, Inigo Montoya of Spain, is going to lose
: moving in for the end now, blocking everything, muzzling everything and : - sent flying from Inigo's grip
He stands helpless only a moment
Then be drops to his knees, bows his head, shuts his eyes
Kill me quickly
would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself
However, since  can't have you following me either -- And he dunks Inigo's head with his heavy sword handle
Inigo pitches forward unconscious
Please understand,  hold you in the highest respect
He grabs his scabbard and takes off after the Princess and we : : Inconceivable
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           36
Vizzini, staring down from a narrow mountain path, as far below the Man In Black can be seen running
, carrying the Princess, stands alongside
It's a little later in the morning
Give her to me
(grabs Buttercup starts off) Catch up with us quickly
(starting to panic) What do  do
Finish him, finish him
Your way
Oh, good, my way
Thank you, Vizzini
(little pause) Which way is my way
: Nothing gigantic
Vizzini points to them
There is a large boulder nearby
Pick up one of those rocks, get behind the boulder, and in a few minutes, the Man in Black will come running around the bend
The minute his head is in view, hit it with the rock
As Vizzini and Buttercup hurry away
(little frown; softly) My way's not very sportsmanlike
He grabs one of the rocks and plods behind the boulder and we -- : ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           37
racing up the mountain trail
Ahead is a bend in the trail
He sees it, slows
Then he stops, listening
Satisfied by the silence, he starts forward again and as he rounds the bend -- a rock flies  , shattering on a boulder inches in front of him
: He moves into the mountain path
He has picked up another rock and holds it lightly
did that on purpose
don't have to miss
believe you -- So what happens now
We face each other as God intended
Sportsmanlike
No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone
You mean, you'll put down your rock and 'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people
(gently) could kill you now
He gets set to throw, but the Man In Black shakes his head, takes off his sword and scabbard, begins the approach toward the Giant
Frankly,  think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting
It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest don't even exercise
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38
He flips the rock away
: The Man In Black is not now and has never been a shrimp
But it's like he wasn't even there,  towers over him so much
There is a moment's pause, and then the Man In Black dives at 's chest, slams him several tremendous blows in the stomach, twists his arm severely, slips skillfully into a beautifully applied bear hug, and in general makes any number of terrific wrestling moves
just stands there, kind of taking in the scenery
Finally the Man In Black pushes himself away, stares up at the Giant
Look are you just fiddling around with me or what
just want you to feel you're doing well
hate for people to die embarrassed
They get set to begin again
Then suddenly -- : as he jumps forward with stunning speed for anyone his size and reaches for the Man In Black who drops to his knees, spins loose, and slips between the Giant's legs
You're quick
And a good thing too
(getting set for another onslaught) Why do you wear a mask
Were you burned by acid, or something like that
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           39
Oh no
It's just that they're terribly comfortable
think everyone will be wearing them in the future
considers this a moment, then attacks, and if he moved quickly last time, this time he is blinding and as the Man In Black slips down to avoid the charge,  moves right with him, only instead of twisting free and jumping to his feet, this time the Man In Black jumps for 's back and in a moment he is riding him, and his arms have 's throat, locked across 's windpipe, one in front, one behind
The Man In Black begins to squeeze
Tighter
(standing, talking as he does so) just figured out why you give me so much trouble
: as he charges toward a huge rock that lines the path, and just as he reaches it he spins his giant body so that the entire weight of the charge is taken by the Man In Black
: And the power of the charge is terrible, the pain enormous, but he clings to his grip at 's windpipe
(his arms never leave Fezzik's throat) Why is that, do you think
(his voice just beginning to get a little strained) Well,  haven't fought just one person for so long
've been specializing in groups
Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing
: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           40
Again  charges, slower this time, but still a charge, and again he spins and creams the Man In Black against the rough boulder
: And the punishment is terrible, and for a moment it seems as if he is going to let go of Fezzik's windpipe and crumble, but he doesn't, he holds on
Why should that make such a difference
Well
(And now his voice is definitely growing weaker) you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one
Again  slams the Man In Black against a boulder, only this time his power has diminished and Fezzik starts to slowly collapse
: and there isn't much breath coming
: holding his grip as  tries to stand, halfway makes it, but there is no air
Back to his knees he falls, holds there for a moment, and pitches down to all fours
The Man In Black increases the pressure
tries to crawl
But there is just no air
No air
goes to earth and lies still
: as the Man In Black turns him over, puts his ear to 's heart
It beats
The Man In Black stands
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           41
don't envy you the headache you will have when you awake
But, in the meantime, rest well
and dream of large women
And he nimbly scoops up his sword with his foot, catches it and as he dashes off up along the mountain path -- : as he slips his boot into a foot print in the sand
Count Rugen mounted, watches
Behind him, half a dozen armed , also mounted
waits riderless in front
Humperdinck is all over the rocky ground, and maybe he isn't the best hunter in the world
Then again, maybe he is
Because, as he begins to put his feet into strange positions, we realize that what he is doing is miming the fencers
There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over
They were both masters
Who won
How did it end
(looking down in the position where Inigo fell unconscious) The loser ran off alone
(points in the direction Vizzini and took) The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder
Shall we track them both
The loser is nothing
-- Only the Princess matters -- (to the armed warriors) -- clearly this was all planned by warriors of Guilder
We must be ready for whatever lies ahead
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           42
Could this be a trap
(vaulting onto his horse) always think everything could be a trap -- Which is why 'm still alive
And he gallops off -- : cresting the peak of the mountain
: - a knife pointed at a throat --     Vizzini munching on an apple, holding the knife to Buttercup's throat
She is blindfolded
is laid out
tablecloth, two goblets and between them, a small leather wine container
And some cheese and a couple of apples
The picnic is set on a lovely spot, high on the edge of a mountain path with a view all the way back to the sea
The Man In Black comes running around the path, sees Vizzini, slows
The two men study each other
Then -- So, it is down to you
And it is down to me
The Man In Black nods and comes nearer -- If you wish her dead, by all means keep moving forward
And he pushes his long knife harder against Buttercup's unprotected throat
Let me explain- -- there's nothing to explain
You're trying to kidnap what 've rightfully stolen
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43
Perhaps an arrangement can be reached
There will be no arrangement -- (deliberate) -- and you're killing her
: ' as Vizzini jabs with his long knife
Buttercup gasps against the pain
: stopping fast
But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse
'm afraid so --  can't compete with you physically
And you're no match for my brains
You're that smart
Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates
Yes
Morons
Really
In that case,  challenge you to a battle of wits
For the Princess
The Man In Black nods
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           44
To the death
Another nod
accept
Good
Then pour the wine
As Vizzini fills the goblets with the dark red liquid, the Man In Black pulls a small packet from his clothing, handing it to Vizzini
Inhale this, but do not touch
(doing it) smell nothing
(taking the packet back) What you do not smell is called iocane powder
It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man
Hmm
: watching excitedly as the Man In Black takes the goblets, turns his back
moment later, he turns again, faces Vizzini, drops the iocane packet
It is now empty
The Man In Black rotates the goblets in a little shell game maneuver then puts one glass in front of Vizzini, the other in front of himself
All right: where is the poison
The battle of wits has begun
It ends when you decide and we both drink, and find out who is right and who is dead
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           45
But it's so simple
All  have to do is divine from what  know of you
Are you the sort of man who would put the poison into his own goblet, or his enemy's
He studies the Man In Black now
Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given
'm not a great fool, so  can clearly not choose the wine in front of you
But you must have known  was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so  can clearly not choose the wine in front of me
(And now there's a trace of nervousness beginning) You've made your decision then7 Not remotely
Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows
And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals
And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me
So  can clearly not choose the wine in front of you
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect
Wait till  get going
Where was
Australia
Yes -- Australia, and you must have suspected  would have known the powder's origin, so  can clearly not choose the wine in front of me
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           46
(very nervous) You're just stalling now
(cackling) You'd like to think that, wouldn't you
(stares at the Man in Black) You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong
So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you
So can clearly not choose the wine in front of you
But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied
And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so  can clearly not choose the wine in front of me
As Vizzini's pleasure has been growing throughout, the Man In Black's has been fast disappearing
You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work -- (triumphant) It has worked -- you've given everything away --  know where the poison is
(fool's courage) Then make your choice
will
And  choose -- And suddenly he stops, points at something behind the Man In Black
-- what in the world can that be
: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           47
turning around, looking
What
Where
don't see anything
: busily switching the goblets while the Man In Black has his head turned
Oh, well, - could have sworn saw something
No matter
The Man In Black turns to face him again
Vizzini starts to laugh
What's so funny
'll tell you in a minute
First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours
And he picks up his goblet
The Man In Black picks up the one in front of him
As they both start to drink, Vizzini hesitates a moment
Then, allowing the Man In Black to drink first, he swallows his wine
You guessed wrong
(roaring with laughter) You only think  guessed wrong -- (louder now) -- that's what's so funny switched glasses when your back was turned
You fool
: There's nothing he can say
He just sits there
: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           48
watching him
You fell victim to one of the classic blunders
The most famous is "Never get involved in a land war in Asia
" But only slightly less well known is this: "Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line
" He laughs and roars and cackles and whoops and is in all ways quite cheery until he falls over dead
: stepping past the corpse, taking the blindfold and bindings off Buttercup, who notices Vizzini lying dead
The Man In Black pulls her to her feet
Who are you
am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know
He starts to lead her off the mountain path into untraveled terrain
(a final glance back toward Vizzini) To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned
They were both poisoned
spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder
And with that, he takes off, dragging her behind him
: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           49
It's where  fought the Man in Black the Prince, kneeling, inspecting every grain of misplaced sand
The others wait behind him
Someone has beaten a giant
(roaring) There will be great suffering in Guilder if she dies
He leaps onto his horse and they charge off
: The Man In Black comes running into view, still dragging Buttercup, who sometimes stumbles, but he keeps forcing her along
Finally, when she is close to exhaustion, he lets go of her
(his voice harsh now, carrying the promise of violence) Catch your breath
If you'll release me
whatever you ask for ransom
you'll get it,  promise you
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman
You're very funny, Highness
was giving you a chance
No matter where you take me
there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck
He could track a falcon on a cloudy day
He can find you You think your dearest love will save you
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           50
never said he was my dearest love
And yes, he will save me
That  know
You admit to me you do not love your fiance
He knows  do not love him
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean
have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream
And the Man In Black cocks back a fist
Buttercup flinches, but does not retreat
That was a warning, Highness
The next time, my hand flies on its own
For where  come from, there are penalties when a woman lies
: ' The picnic is spread as before
the Prince kneeling by the body as the others ride up
The Prince grabs the empty poison packet, hands it to Rugen, after first sniffing it himself
Iocane
'd bet my life on it
(gestures to the trail ahead) And there are the Princess's footprints
She is alive
or was, an hour ago
If she is otherwise when  find her, shall be very put out
And as he vaults onto his horse and the all charge off -- : ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           51
being spun   view, falling heavily as the Man In Black releases her
We are at the edge of an almost sheer ravine
The drop is sharp and severe
Below, the ravine floor is flat, but getting there would not be half the fun
Rest, Highness
(stares at him) know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything
The Man In Black says nothing
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it
(bowing) With pride
What can  do for you
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces
Hardly complimentary, Your Highness
Why loose your venom on me
- , quietly now
You killed my love
: watching her closely
It's possible;  kill a lot of people
Who was this love of yours
Another Prince, like this one, ugly, rich, and scabby
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           52
No
farm boy
Poor
Poor and perfect, with eyes like the sea after a storm
: And probably, if she did not hate Roberts so, there would be tears
On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners
(explaining as a teacher might) can't afford to make exceptions
Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time
You mock my pain
Life is pain, Highness
Anyone who says differently is selling something
remember this farm boy of yours,  think
This would be, what, five years ago
Buttercup nods
Does it bother you to hear
Nothing you can say will upset me
He died well, that should please you
No bribe attempts or blubbering
He simply said, "Please
Please,  need to live
" It was the "please" that caught my memory
() ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           53
(') asked him what was so important for him
"True love," he replied
And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness
can only assume he meant you
You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are
And what am
Faithfulness he talked of, madam
Your enduring faithfulness
Now, tell me truly
When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead
You mocked me once, never do it again --  died that day
The Man In Black is about to reply as they stand there on the edge of the sheer ravine
But then something catches his attention and as he stares at it briefly, : : The dust cloud caused by Humperdinck's  is rising up into the sky
: and while his attention is on the dust cloud, rising high, she pushes him with all the strength she has
You can die too, for all  care
: teetering on the ravine edge, for a moment, then he begins to fall
Down goes the Man In Black
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           54
Down, down, rolling, spinning, crashing always down toward the flat rock floor of the ravine
: staring transfixed at what she has wrought
There is a long pause
She stands there, alone, as from far below the words come to her, drifting on the wind -- as
you
wish
Oh, my sweet Westley; what have done
And without a second thought or consideration of the dangers, she starts into the ravine
moment later, she too is falling, spinning and twisting, crashing and torn, cartwheeling down toward what is left of her beloved
: rising
Prince Humperdinck and the others reining in at the spot where Buttercup promised ransom in exchange for her freedom
The Prince shakes his head
Disappeared
He must have seen us closing in, which might account for his panicking in error
Unless 'm wrong, and  am never wrong, they are headed dead into the fire swamp
: The mere mention of the Fire Swamp makes him pale
: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           55
lie a few feet apart, not moving
It is, of course, Buttercup and Westley
They might be corpses
After a time, Westley slowly forces his body into motion and as he does, : bruised and torn, as Westley crawls slowly toward her
Can you move at all
(weakly stretching out an arm toward him) Move
You're alive
If you want, can fly
told you, " would always come for you
" Why didn't you wait for me
Well
you were dead
Death cannot stop true love
All it can do is delay it for a while
will never doubt again
There will never be a need
And now, they begin to kiss; it's a tender kiss, tender and loving and gentle and -- (off-screen) Oh no
No, please
: ' What is it
What's the matter
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56
They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part
Someday, you may not mind so much
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good
Oh
You're sick, 'll humor you
(he picks up the book again) So now, where were we here
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah
Oh
Okay
Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor
: racing along the ravine floor
Westley glances up
: perched on top of the cliff, looking down at Westley and Buttercup
: Ha
Your pig fiance is too late
few more steps and we'll be safe in the Fire Swamp
: and Westley has tried to say it with Chevalier-like nonchalance, but she ain't buying
We'll never survive
Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57
As they race off, leaving Humperdinck and his men stranded, defeated
: And it really doesn't look any worse than any other moist, sulphurous, infernal horror you might run across
Great trees block the sun
: Buttercup is clearly panicked and maybe Westley is too, but he moves jauntily along, sword in hand
It's not that bad
'm not saying 'd like to build a summer home here, but the trees are actually quite lovely
, thick and black-green, look ominous as hell and they shield all but intermittent stripes of sun
leaps up, preceded by a slight popping sound, and this particular spurt of flame misses Westley, but Buttercup is suddenly onfire; at least the lower half of her is and -- : instantly forcing Buttercup to sit, gathering her flaming hem in his hands, doing his best to suffocate the fire
This isn't all that easy and it causes him a bit of grief, but he does his best to sound as jaunty as before
Well now, that was an adventure
He examines where the flames burst over her
Singed a bit, were you
(She wasn't and she shakes her head "no") You
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58
He was, and he shakes his head "no
" As he pulls her to her feet -- : -- and as there's another popping sound, : pulling her aside to safety as another great spun of flame suddenly shoots up
Well, one thing  will say
The Fire Swamp certainly does keep you on your toes
Buttercup is frozen with fear
He takes her hand, gently leads her forward as we- : moving slowly along through a particularly dangerous part of the Fire Swamp
It's later now, the sun slants down at a slightly different angle
(happily) This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end
And , as you know, am Roberts
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago
myself am often surprised at life's little quirks
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59
There is again a popping sound, then a huge spurt of flame
Westley simply picks up Buttercup as they walk along, moves her out of danger, puts her back down, goes right on talking without missing a beat
You see, what  told you before about saying "please" was true
It intrigued Roberts, as did my descriptions of your beauty
: -- they look like they could be flesh eating
Westley takes his sword, slices a path for them to follow
The vines groan as they fall
He's been chatting away the entire time
Finally, Roberts decided something
He said, "All right, Westley, 've never had a valet
You can try it for tonight
'll most likely kill you in the morning
" Three years he said that
"Good night, Westley
Good work
Sleep well
'll most likely kill you in the morning
" It was a fine time for me
was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me
And Roberts and eventually became friends
And then it happened
What
-- go on -- Westley picks her up, carrying her across some swamp water that is bridged by a narrow, rickety tree branch
Well, Roberts had grown so rich, he wanted to retire
So he took me to his cabin and told me his secret
" am not the Dread Pirate Roberts," he said
"My name is Ryan
inherited this ship from the previous Dread Pirate Roberts, just as you will inherit it from me
The man inherited it from was not the real Dread Pirate Roberts, either
() ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           60
(') His name was Cummerbund
The real Roberts has been retired fifteen years and living like a king in Patagonia
" Then he explained the name was the important thing for inspiring the necessary fear
You see, no one would surrender to the Dread Pirate Westley
The two of them have by now crossed the pond
So we sailed ashore, took on an entirely new crew and he stayed aboard for awhile as first mate, all the time calling me Roberts
Once the crew believed, he left the ship and  have been Roberts ever since
Except, now that we're together,  shall retire and hand the name over to someone else
Is everything clear to you
Buttercup, perplexed, is about to reply but the ground she steps on gives way -- it's Lightning Sand -- a great patch of it, and it has her -- a cloud of powder rises and she sinks into the stuff crying Westley's name but then she is gone as we -- : slashing at a -shaped vine, hacks it in half -- it's still connected to the tree
Then be grabs it, drops his sword, and, clutching the other end of the vine, he dives into the lightning sand and there is another cloud of white powder, but it settles quickly
Now nothing can be seen
Nothing at all
Just the lightning sand, lovely and lethal
--  -- An odd panting sound is heard now
The panting sound is suddenly very loud
And then a giant
0
darts into view
The
0
-- a Rodent of Unusual Size -- is probably no more than eighty pounds of bone and power
It sniffs around a bit then, as quickly as it has come, it goes
: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           61
as Westley, lungs long past the bursting point, explodes out; he has Buttercup across his shoulders and as he pulls to the edge of the lightning sand pit, using the vine -- : - - Her face is caked with the white powder
It is in her eyes, her ears, hair, mouth
She's still probably beautiful, but you have to look awfully hard to see it
As Westley continues to pull them to safety -- : 0
high above them; it watches -- : placed against a tree
Westley is cleaning the lightning sand from her face
He hesitates, glances around and : 0
on a much lower branch now
It stares down at Westley
Westley stares back up at the beast
Buttercup is oblivious
Her eyes flutter
He continues to work on her as -- We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here
No
No
We have already succeeded
He glances back again
Now
0
's
The have climbed into a nearby tree, stare hungrily down
: , picking her up
He puts an arm around her, starts to walk with her as he encouragingly goes on talking
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           62
mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp
One, the flame spurts
No problem
There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that
Two, the Lightning Sand
But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too
Westley, what about the
's
Rodents of Unusual Size
don't think they exist
And as he says that, a
0
comes flying at him from offscreen
: screaming and -- Westley, pinned under the attacking
0
, trying to fend it off
Can't
The thing's teeth sink deep into his arm
He howls
Westley drives a fist into the beast's face, rolling it off
He reaches for his sword just a few feet away, but the 0
is back atop him
It's a fierce battle, and just when we think Westley can't possibly win, he flips the ugly rodent clear
Westley scrambles for his sword
The
0
stampedes on, changing its target, heading right for -- Buttercup, and she's scared to death and -- Westley
Westley abandons his sword, reaching for the rodent, grabbing only a tail, wrestling with it
Buttercup grabs a small branch, and using it as a club, beats the skull of the thing, doing pretty well, but the beast manages to snag her hem with its razor teeth, and she's pulled to the ground, and : ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           63
jumping onto its back, and the
0
is all over him now, sinking needle teeth into Westley's shoulder
: with death close at hand, as a popping sound starts
He tries one desperate move, rolls into the sound -- : shooting skyward and -- : with the
0
pinned under him, and as the beast bursts into flame, it lets go and Westley rolls safely free, grabs his sword and exhaustedly stabs the
0
, which is trying to put itself out
The
0
collapses dead
Westley stands motionless, exhausted
The danger has passed
: relieved
: Beyond, a beach
: (almost in disbelief) We did it
Now, was that so terrible
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64
And from somewhere they summon strength, pick up their pace, and as they reach the edge of the Fire Swamp -- : ' : Humperdinck on his horse, Rugen beside him
, armed and ready, are mounted in formation behind
Buttercup and Westley are at the edge of the Fire Swamp, about to leave it
They stop
Buttercup looks beyond exhaustion
Westley looks worse
Surrender
It's dusk
Behind Humperdinck are the waters of the bay
: staring out at the others
You mean you wish to surrender to me
Very well,  accept
give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool
Ah, but how will you capture us
We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp
We can live there quite happily for some time
So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit
tell you once again -- surrender
It will not happen
: looking from one to the other; then something else catches her eye and we -- : ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           65
in shadow, with a loaded crossbow aimed at Westley's heart
: looking the other way -- : crossbow aimed at Westley
(roaring) For the last time --
(roaring right back, bigger) : frantically staring around, and now : crossbow stretched, ready to shoot; this one is hidden in a tree blocking any escape Westley might try
Will you promise not to hurt him
: whirling to face her
What was that
: whirling to face her
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           66
What was that
: talking to them both
If we surrender, and  return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man
May  live a thousand years and never hunt again
(looks at Westley) He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge
" Promise to return him to his ship
swear it will be done
: staring deep into each other's eyes
: (whispering) Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair
(almost a smile) swear it will be done
: thought you were dead once, and it almost destroyed me
could not bear it if you died again, not when  could save you
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           67
Westley is dazed
Silent
Buttercup tries to speak again, can't, and is swooped off her feet onto Humperdinck's horse, and off they go
: staring after her
Rugen watches as his warriors bring Westley to him
The Count has a heavy sword and he holds it in his hand
Come, sir
We must get you to your ship
We are men of action
Lies do not become us
Well spoken, sir -- Westley is looking at him
-- what is it
You have six fingers on your right hand -- someone was looking for you -- Count Rugen clubs Westley hard across the skull
Westley starts to fall --the screen goes black
: Dank and chill, underground and windowless, lit by flickering torches
Frightening
Westley lies in the center of the cage, chained and helpless
: :  - Dead pale, he silently enters the pit, carrying a tray of food and medication
He puts it down
Where am
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           68
(he only whispers) The Pit of Despair
He begins tending Westley's wounds
Westley winces
(garbled) Don't even think -- ( hack, sputter, cough - now his voice seems normal again) -- don't even think about trying to escape
The chains are far too thick
And don't dream of being rescued either
The only way in is secret
And only the Prince, the Count, and  know how to get in and out
Then 'm here till  die
(working away) Till they kill you
Yeah
Then why bother curing me
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken
So it's to be torture
The albino nods
can cope with torture
The albino shakes his head
You don't believe me
You survived the Fire Swamp
You must be very brave
(little pause) but nobody withstands The Machine
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           69
He studies Westley, whose face is almost sad
: and her face is sad
Pallid, perhaps ill
She wanders down a corridor in Florin Castle
As she moves unseeing past an intersecting corridor: : watching her
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp
(looks at Rugen) It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her
(unbelieving) Of course
As they move on-- : - while we hear the Grandfather's voice reading
(off-screen) The King died that very night, and before the following dawn, Buttercup and Humperdinck were married
: And if we thought it was packed before, we didn't know how many more could fit in this courtyard
Humperdinck, Rugen and the Queen stand high on the balcony
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           70
(off-screen) And at noon, she met her subjects again
This time as their Queen
My father's final words were
(off-screen) -- hold it
Hold it, Grandpa
And the scene , Humperdinck caught in mid-sentence
: ' The Kid is half sitting now, not strong yet, but clearly stronger than when we first saw him
You read that wrong
She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley
'm just sure of it
After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair
Well, who says life is fair
Where is that written
Life isn't always fair
'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right
Do you want me to go on with this
Yes
All right, then
No more interruptions
(starts to read again) at noon, she met her subjects again
This time as their Queen
And on these words-- : ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           71
My father's final words were "love her as  loved her, and there will be joy
"  present to you your Queen
Queen Buttercup
And on his words-- : and it's gigantic
: we saw before, as Buttercup emerges
: suddenly going to its knees, wave after wave of silent All of them down
: touched as before, but then she seems stunned as we : The  gets louder as an approaches Buttercup through the crowd,  every step of the way
Why do you do this
Because you had love in your hands, and you gave it up
(distraught) But they would have killed Westley if  hadn't done it
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           72
Your true love lives and you marry another -- (to the crowd) -- True love saved her in the Fire Swamp, and she treated it like garbage
And that's what she is, the Queen of Refuse
So, bow down to her if you want
Bow to her
Bow to the Queen of Slime, the Queen of Filth, the Queen of Putrescence
Boo
Boo
Rubbish
Filth
Slime
Muck
Boo
Boo
She advances on Buttercup now, who is more and more panicked
- - Louder and louder and  she shrieks vituperation at Buttercup, reaching out her old hands toward Buttercup's throat, and Buttercup is as frightened now as Dorothy was when the Witch went after her in "The Wizard of Oz", and suddenly, : coming out of her nightmare, alone in her castle bedroom
As she frantically grabs a robe and starts to run
(off-screen, still reading) It was ten days till the wedding
The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse
(off-screen) See
Didn't  tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck
(off-screen) -- yes, you're very smart
Shut-Up
: bursting into the Prince's chambers
Count Rugen stands nearby
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           73
It comes to this:  love Westley
always have
know now always will
If you tell me must marry you in ten days, please believe  will be dead by morning
: Just stunned
Finally, softly, he begins to talk
could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off
(to Rugen) You returned this Westley to his ship
Yes
Then we will simply alert him
(to Buttercup now) Beloved, are you certain he still wants you
After all, it was you who did the leaving in the Fire Swamp
Not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words
My Westley will always come for me
suggest a deal
You write four copies of a letter
'll send my four fastest ships
One in each direction
The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year
We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message
If Westley wants you, bless you both
If not
please consider me as an alternative to suicide
Are we agreed
And she nods -- : ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           74
The trees are unusual in one respect: all of them are extraordinarily heavily knotted
Humperdinck and Rugen, walking into the grove of trees
Your Princess is really a winning creature
trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable
Oh,  know
The people are quite taken with her
It's odd, but when  hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, thought that was clever
But it's going to be so much more moving when  strangle her on our wedding night
Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged
They'll demand we go to war
They are deeper into the grove now
Rugen is searching around
Now, where is that secret knot
It's impossible to find
(Finding the knot on the tree he hits it, and it opens, revealing a staircase leading underground
) Are you coming down into the Pit
Westley's got his strength back
am starting him on The Machine tonight
Tyrone, you know how much  love watching you work
But, 've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it
'm swamped
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75
Get some rest -- if you haven't got your health, you haven't got anything
Rugen smiles and hurries down the stairs as the tree slides back perfectly into place
: We can't tell quite what it is or what it does, but somehow it is unsettling
Count Rugen, dragging Westley up alongside the thing -- Levers and wheels and wires, you name it, it's there
Beautiful, isn't it
The Albino starts attaching suction cups to Westley
It took me half a lifetime to invent it
'm sure you've discovered my deep and abiding interest in pain
At present 'm writing the definitive work on the subject
So  want you to be totally honest with me on how The Machine makes you feel
: with numbers ranging from a low of "1" to a high of "50
" Rugen goes to it
This being our first try, 'll use the lowest setting
And he turns the dial to "1"
: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           76
He has suction cups on his head now, on his temple, on his heart, his hands and feet
He says nothing, keeps control of himself : fiddling with his Machine a moment more
And then he opens the flood gate, water pours down the chute, turning the wheel, which in turn really gets The Machine going
: and he's lying on the table, and he's only flesh and the chains are metal and thick, but such is his desperation it almost seems he might break them
terrible sound comes from his throat, an incessant gasping
It keeps on coming as we finally : He switches off The Machine, picks up a large notebook and pen, sits in a chair
The  of The Machine subsides
Rugen opens the book to a blank page
As you know, the concept of the suction pump is centuries old
Well, really, that's all this is
Except that instead of sucking water, 'm sucking life
've just sucked one year of your life away
might one day go as high as five, but  really don't know what that would do to you
So, let's just start with what we have
What did this do to you
Tell me
And remember, this is for posterity, so be honest -- how do you feel
,  : : ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           77
in anguish so deep it is dizzying
Helpless, he cries
Count Rugen watches the tears, then starts to write
Interesting
: in his quarters, swamped
Piles of papers are strewn all over
Now , a pale, shifty, quick-eyed man appears in the doorway
Yellin
(bows, then kneels) Sire
As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night
My spy network has heard no such news
: entering
Any word from Westley
: turning to her in the doorway
Too soon, my angel
Patience
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           78
He will come for me
Of course
As she glides out-- She will not be murdered
On the day of the wedding,  want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested
Many of the thieves will resist
My regular enforcers will be inadequate
Form a Brute Squad then
want the Thieves' Forest emptied before  wed
It won't be easy, Sire
(alone, exhausted) Try ruling the world sometime
: '  - lot of hollering is going on
The  are being rounded up by the  , a large group of large men
Yellin stands on a wagon in the midst of all the scuffling
(off-screen) The day of the wedding arrived
The Brute Squad had their hands full carrying out Humperdinck's orders
(to an unpleasantlooking assistant) Is everybody out
Almost
There's a Spaniard giving us some trouble
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           79
Well, you give him some trouble
Move
And his wagon starts, and as it does, : drunk as a skunk, sprawled in front of a hovel, a bottle of brandy in one hand, the six-fingered sword in the other
He looks dreadful
Unshaven, puffy-eyed, gaunt
But the way he brandishes the great sword in front of him would give anyone cause for worry
am waiting for you, Vizzini
You told me to go back to the beginning
So  have
This is where  am, and this is where 'll stay
will not be moved
He takes a long pull from his brandy bottle
He stops as the Assistant Brute comes into view
Ho there
do not budge
Keep your "Ho there
" He waves his sword dangerously
But the Prince gave orders -- -- So did Vizzini -- when a job went wrong, you went back to the beginning
And this is where we got the job
So it's the beginning, and 'm staying till Vizzini comes
(gesturing off-screen) You
Brute
Come here
--  -- am -- waiting -- for -- Vizzini -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           80
(off-screen) You surely are a meanie
feels a hand on his back
huge hand
He compares it to his own smaller hand
Hello
It's you
True
And as the Assistant Brute is just about to club Inigo's brains out,  lets fly with a stupendous punch
The Assistant Brute takes the full force of the blow right in the chops
It's like he was shot from a cannon as he careens backwards out of sight across the street
There is a pause
Then a crunching sound, as he clearly has come in contact with something hard and immobile
puts Inigo down
You don't look so good
(after Inigo blasts air in protest) You don't smell so good either
Perhaps not
feel fine
Yeah
And so  puts Inigo down
That's when Inigo faints, and as he does, : ' Inigo sits slumped in a chair, while  spoons him some stew
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           81
(off-screen) and Inigo were reunited
And as  nursed his inebriated friend back to health, he told Inigo of Vizzini's death and the existence of Count Rugen, the sixfingered man
Considering Inigo's lifelong search, he handled the news surprisingly well
And he faints again into his stew
: one filled with steaming water, the other with water clearly of an icy nature
Without a word  stuffs Inigo's head into the icy water, then, after a reasonable amount of time, pulls him out, ducks him into the steaming stuff, and, a short time after that, puts him back in the cold again, then back in the hot -- (off-screen) Fezzik took great care in reviving Inigo
(up and going) That's enough
That's enough
Where is this Rugen so  may kill him
He's with the Prince in the Castle
But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men
How many could you handle
don't think more than ten
(doing the math on his fingers) That leaves twenty for me
At my best,  could never defeat that many
(he sinks sadly down) need Vizzini to plan
have no gift for strategy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82
But Vizzini's dead
: Silent and bereft
Then a wild look hits Inigo
No -- not Vizzini --  need the Man in Black -- -- what
-- -- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness
He bested me with steel
He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day
Let's go -- -- where
To find the Man in Black, obviously
But you don't know where he is
(he is possessed by demons now) Don't bother me with trifles; after twenty years, at last, my father's soul will be at peace
: - (big) There will be blood tonight
: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           83
' -- strewn with maps, etc
Yellin enters, and kneels
(sharpening his dagger) Rise and report
The Thieves' Forest is emptied
Thirty men guard the castle gate
Double it
My Princess must be safe
The gate has but one key, and carry that
He shows the key, dangling from a chain around his neck
Just at that moment, Buttercup enters
Ah
My dulcet darling
Tonight we marry
Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon
Every ship but your four fastest, you mean
The Prince looks at her blankly for a moment
Every ship but the four you sent
Yes
Yes, of course
Naturally, not those four
(bows, exits) Your Majesties
: staring at Humperdinck
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           84
You never sent the ships
Don't bother lying
It doesn't matter
Westley will come for me anyway
(sharply) You're a silly girl
Yes,  am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear
(close to erupting; speaks very distinctly) -would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you- Why not
You can't hurt me
Westley and  are joined by the bonds of love
And you cannot track that
Not with a thousand bloodhounds
And you cannot break it
Not with a thousand swords
And when  say you are a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth
: jumping at her, yanking her by the hair, starting to pull her along, out of control, his words indistinct
: as the Prince throws open the door to Buttercup's room, slams it shut, locks it, breaks into a wild run and -- : ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           85
but it's not on
Count Rugen is adding more notes to his book
He looks up as the Prince suddenly comes down the steps, raging
(at Westley) You truly love each other, and so you might have been truly happy
Not one couple in a century has that chance, no matter what the storybooks say
And so  think no man in a century will suffer as greatly as you will
And with that he whirls, turns on The Machine, grabs the lever and -- : calling out -- Not to fifty
But it's too late as we -- : shoving the lever all the way up and : ' And there has never been such pain
The pain grows and grows and with it now, something else has started As The Death Scream starts to rise -- : as the  moves along,   , and -- : ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           86
and they bear it, and a few of the Brutes turn to each other in fear, and as the scream builds -- : and she hears the , doesn't know what it is, but her arms involuntarily go around her body to try to control the trembling, and the scream, still builds and -- : There are many  --it is the day of the country's 500th Anniversary -- but all the People stop as the sound hits them
few  pale, bolt toward their  and -- : trying to make their way through the jammed marketplace, which suddenly quiets as the fading sound comes through
(instantly) , , listen, do you hear
-- That is the sound of ultimate suffering
My heart made that sound when Rugen slaughtered my father
The Man in Black makes it now
The Man in Black
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering
(trying to push through) Excuse me -- It's too crowded
-- pardon me, it's important -- No one budges and the sound is fading faster
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           87
-- Fezzik, please -- (gigantic and roaring) Everybody
And the Crowd begins to fall away, and he and Inigo start to track the
Thank you
: The Albino appears wheeling a barrow
Inigo's sword pushes at his chest
Where is the Man in Black
The Albino shakes his head, says nothing
You get there from this grove, yes
Silence
Fezzik, jog his memory
And Fezzik crunches the Albino on the top of the head as if he had a hammer and was driving in a nail
The Albino drops without a sound
(upset) 'm sorry, Inigo
didn't mean to jog him so hard
Inigo
: He kneels, the sword held tight between his hands
Eyes closed, he faces the grove of trees, starts to talk, his voice low and strange
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           88
Father,  have failed you for twenty years
Now our misery can end
Somewhere
somewhere close by is a man who can help us
cannot find him alone
need you
need you to guide my sword
Please
And now he rises, eyes still closed
Guide my sword
: as Inigo, eyes shut tight, walks forward, the great sword held in his hands
Fezzik, frightened, follows close behind
: that reveals the staircase
: walking blind through the grove of trees
He moves to the Secret Knot, hesitates, then moves past it
Then Inigo stops
For a long moment he stands frozen
Suddenly he whirls, eyes still closed, and the sword strikes home dead center into a knot and -- Nothing
He has failed
In utter despair he collapses against the tree
Against a knot in the tree
Against   in the tree
It slides away, revealing the staircase
and Inigo look at each other, then start down
: dead by The Machine
leans over him, listening for a heartbeat
Then he looks at Inigo, shakes his head
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           89
He's dead
Inigo is in despair
For a moment, he just sags
(barely able to speak) It just is not fair
(off-screen) -- Grandpa, Grandpa -- wait -- : ' He is terribly excited and looks stronger than we've yet seen him
-- wait -- what did  mean, "He's dead
"  mean he didn't mean dead
The Grandfather says nothing, just sits there
Westley's only faking, right
You want me to read this or not
: : Who gets Humperdinck
don't understand
Who kills Prince Humperdinck
At the end, somebody's got to do it
Is it Inigo
Who
Nobody
Nobody kills him
He lives
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90
You mean he wins
Jesus, Grandpa
What did you read me this thing for
And he desperately fights for control
You know, you've been very sick and you're taking this story very seriously
think we better stop now
He closes the book and starts to get up
(shaking his head) No
'm okay
'm okay
(gestures toward the chair) -- sit down
All right
Okay
(sitting and opening the book again) All right, now, let's see
Where were we
Oh yes
In the Pit of Despair
: , We're back in the Pit, the same shot as before
For a moment, he just sags
Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily
Come along, Fezzik
Bring the body
The body
(not stopping) Have you any money
have a little
just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           91
As Fezzik takes the corpse, follows Inigo up the stairs -- : - Inigo, , Westley approach the door
They knock
From inside the hovel a little man's voice is heard
If Mel Brooks' Year Old Man was really old, he'd resemble this guy
(off-screen) Go away
Inigo pounds again
(opening a small window in the door) What
What
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years
The King's stinking son fired me
And thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject
While you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it
We're closed
He shuts the window
They rap on the door
(opening the window) Beat it or 'll call the Brute Squad
'm on the Brute Squad
(looking at the Giant) You are the Brute Squad
We need a miracle
It's very important
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           92
Look, 'm retired
And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle
He's already dead
(for the first time, interested) He is, eh
'll take a look
Bring him in
He unlocks the door and lets them in
: hurrying inside
carries Westley who is just starting to stiffen up a little
He lays Westley down across a bench by the fireplace, picks Westley's arm up and lets it drop limp
've seen worse
He studies Westley a moment, checking here, checking there
Sir
Sir
Hah
We're really in a terrible rush
(He takes nothing from nobody) Don't rush me, sonny
You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles
You got money
Sixty-five
Sheesh
never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93
This is noble, sir
(pointing to Westley, remorseful) His wife is crippled
His children are on the brink of starvation
Are you a rotten liar
need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years
Your first story was better
(looking around) Where's that bellows
(spots it) He probably owes you money, huh
Well, 'll ask him
He goes to get a huge bellows
(stupefied) He's dead
He can't talk
Look who knows so much
Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead
There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead
Please open his mouth
Inigo does
Max inserts the bellows in Westley's mouth and starts to pump
Now, mostly dead is slightly alive
Now, all dead
well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do
What's that
He stops pumping
Go through his clothes and look for loose change
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           94
He starts pumping again
(to Westley) Hey
Hello in there
Hey
What's so important
What you got here that's worth living for
And he presses lightly on Westley's chest
tr
oooo
luv
Everybody stares at Westley lying there on the bench
True love
You heard him
You could not ask for a more noble cause than that
Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world
Except for a nice , a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe
They're so perky,  love that
But that's not what he said
He distinctly said "to blave
" And, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff
" So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated ' -- Liar -- ---- -- , an ancient fury, storms out of a back room and toward -- get back, witch -- 'm not a witch, 'm your wife
But after what you just said, 'm not even sure  want to be that anymore
You never had it so good
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           95
"True love
" He said, "true love," Max
My God -- (retreating) Don't say another word, Valerie
(turning to Inigo and Fezzik) He's afraid
Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered
Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name -- (pursuing him now) What, Humperdinck
Humperdinck
Humperdinck
Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck (holding his hands over his ears) 'm not listening
life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help -- Nobody's hearing nothing
Humperdinck
Humperdinck
Humperdinck
-- But this is Buttercup's true love -- If you heal him, he will stop Humperdinck's wedding
Humperdinck
Humperdinck -- (to Valerie) Shut up -- (now to Inigo) Wait
Wait
make him better, Humperdinck suffers
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           96
Humiliations galore
That is a noble cause
Give me the sixty-five, 'm on the job
And as Valerie shrieks excitedly we : It is somewhat smaller than a tennis ball
, exhausted, looking at the lump with beautific pleasure, as Valerie, cooking utensil in hand, covers the thing with what looks like chocolate
Inigo and  stare at the thing too, but more dubiously
(a little appalled) That's a miracle pill
Max nods
(finishing) The chocolate coating makes it go down easier
But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency
And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what
An hour
Yeah, an hour
good hour
Yeah
Inigo accepts the pill as  takes Westley, who is stiff as a board now
(heading out the door, Fezzik close behind) Thank you for everything
Okay
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97
(waving after them) Bye-bye, boys
Have fun storming the castle
(to Max) Think it'll work
It would take a miracle
Bye
Bye
And as they wave, trying to look happy we -- : , , on the top of the outer wall of the castle
They look down to the front gate of the castle
The sixty Brutes are visible
is thunderstruck by how many Brutes there are
Upset, he turns to Inigo, who is concentrating unsuccessfully, trying to prop Westley against the wall
Inigo -- there's more than thirty -- (absolutely unfazed) What's the difference
(indicating the half- dead Westley) We've got him
Help me here
We'll have to force feed him
Has it been fifteen minutes
We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand
During this, , using all his strength, has managed to get Westley into a right angled sitting position, while Inigo brings out the miracle pill
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           98
Tilt his head back
Open his mouth
(following orders) How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works
: Pill in hand, he drops it into Westley's mouth
Your guess is as good as mine -- (frantic) 'll beat you both apart
'll take you both together
Guess not very long
Inigo and  react
Westley is the only one not amazed
Why won't my arms move
He sits there, immobile, like a ventriloquist's dummy
You've been mostly dead all day
We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back
Who are you
-- Are we enemies
Why am  on this wall
-- Where's Buttercup
-- Let me explain -- (pauses very briefly) -- No, there is too much
Let me sum up
() ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99
(') Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after  kill Count Rugen
That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying
He is watching his fingers, one of which twitches now
You've just wiggled your finger
That's wonderful
've always been a quick healer
(to Inigo) What are our liabilities
There is but one working castle gate
Fezzik helps Inigo raise Westley just high enough so he can see for himself
And it is guarded by sixty men
And our assets
Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel
: absolutely stunned
That's it
Impossible
If  had a month to plan, maybe  could come up with something
But this
He shakes his head from side to side
: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          100
(trying to be cheery) You just shook your head -- that doesn't make you happy
My brains, his steel, and your strength against sixty men, and you think a little head jiggle is supposed to make me happy mean, if we only had a wheelbarrow, that would be something
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had
Over the Albino,  think
Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place
What  wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak
There we cannot help you
(pulling one out) Will this do
(to Fezzik-- surprised) Where did you get that
At Miracle Max's
It fit so nice, he said  could keep it
All right, all right
Come on, help me up
Inigo and Fezzik do
Now, 'll need a sword eventually
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          101
Why
You can't even lift one
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it
(And his bead tilts limply back
Fezzik sets it up right for him) Thank you
Now, there may be problems once we're inside
'll say -- how do  find the Count
-- Once  do, how do find you again
-- Once  find you again, how do we escape
-- (sharply) Don't pester him, he's had a hard day
(nods) Right, right, sorry
: They move along the wall in silence for a time
Then these words come to us on the wind -- Inigo
What
hope we win
: in her bridal gown, and she's incredible
It's not just her beauty; there's a tranquillity about her now
The Prince, fastening a pearl necklace around her
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          102
You don't seem excited, my little muffin
Should  be
Brides often are, 'm told
(gently, confidently) do not marry tonight
: and she couldn't seem more serene
My Westley will save me
: looking down on the gate with Inigo and Fezzik
: -- and Yellin, standing there, flanked by his sixty Brutes
: looking out at the enemy
This is it
Inigo and  shake hands
Westley can't even do that, but after a bit of rocking back and forth, he manages to get enough momentum to catapult his arm over and onto his friend's
: - The most intelligent looking, the most impressive appearing imaginable
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          103
Buttercup and Humperdinck kneel before the Clergyman
Behind them sit the mumbling old
Standing in the back is Count Rugen
are in position flanking the chapel door
(clears his throat, begins to speak) Mawidge
mawidge is what bwings us togewer today
He has an impediment that would stop a clock
Mawidge, the bwessed awwangement, that dweam wiffim a dweam
And now, from outside the castle, there begins to come a commotion
And then-- (off-screen) Stand your ground, men
Stand your ground
: by the gate, for it is indeed they who are making the commotion, frightened, pointing
Stand your ground
: : And it is a bit unnerving -- a  seems to be floating toward them out of the darkness, a Giant in a strange cloak, and with a voice that would crumble walls
(deep and booming) : ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          104
and he seems to be floating because he's standing in the wheelbarrow, as Inigo, hidden behind him, busts a gut by pushing it and supporting Westley
Now
Not yet
: ,    , : keeping the Brutes in position, or trying to, shouting orders, instructions and as yet the Brutes hold
Now -- : Inigo struggles bravely under their combined weight -- Now
Light him
: as the Giant bursts suddenly, happily into flames
(roaring) : , where The Impressive Clergyman plows on
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          105
Ven wuv, twoo wuv, wiw fowwow you fowever
: , turning quickly, giving a sharp nod to Count Rugen, who immediately takes off out of the chapel with the Four Guards as we : , flaming and scary as hell
: as suddenly the Brutes just scream and take off in wild panic -- Stay where you are
said stay where you are
: so tweasuwe your vruv
Skip to the end
Have you the wing
As Humperdinck whips out the ring, the screams are very loud outside
Here comes my Westley now
: Fezzik, as he pulls off the holocaust cloak
, the portcullis
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          106
And  rushes forward, grabbing the portcullis, which is indeed closing quickly
grabs the gate: and swings the tonnage back upward
Yellin just watches in fear
: as Humperdinck shoves the ring on Buttercup's finger Your Westley is dead
Buttercup only smiles, shakes her head
killed him myself
(never more serene) Then why is there fear behind your eyes
: And she's right
It's there
: pressed against the main gate
Westley, Inigo, and close in
Give us the gate key
(every ounce of honesty he's got) have no gate key
Fezzik, tear his arms off
steps toward him
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          107
Oh, you mean this gate key
And he whips it out, hands it to Fezzik
: And do you, Pwincess Buwwercwup
Man and wife -- say man and wife
Man and wife
(whirling to the King and Queen) Escort the bride to the Honeymoon Suite -- 'll be there shortly
And as he dashes off -- : standing there
Dazed
He didn't come
: racing through the castle, and as they reach a complex intersection of several corridors, Rugen stops, incredulous, as we : , , moving toward them
Actually Fezzik is dragging Westley, who is, in turn, dragging Yellin's sword like a stiff dog leash --Westley simply hasn't the strength to raise it
: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          108
as the confrontation is about to start
Kill the dark one and the giant, but leave the third for questioning
And as his Warriors attack -- Inigo goes wild, and maybe the Warrior's are good, maybe they're even better than that -- but they never get a chance to show it because this is something now, this is Inigo gone mad and the six-fingered sword has never flashed faster and the   is dead before the   has even hit the floor
There is a pause
Then -- (to Rugen, evenly and soft) Hello
My name is Inigo Montoya
You killed my father
Prepare to die
: For a moment he just stands there, sword in hand
Then he does a most unexpected thing
He turns and runs the hell away
: momentarily surprised, then taking off after him, leaving Westley and Fezzik to exchange curious looks and Rugen, running through a half-open heavy wooden door, shutting it and locking it just as Inigo throws himself against it
He tries again
No kind of chance
(calling out) Fezzik,  need you -- : who is still unable to walk under his own power
He calls back -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          109
(indicating Westley) can't leave him alone
: desperately pounding at the heavy door
He's getting away from me, Fezzik
Please
: (to Westley) 'll be right back
And he props Westley up against a large suit of armor and takes off toward the intersection where Inigo's voice came from -- : still hammering the door
Fezzik approaches, gestures for him to stop, and with one mighty swipe of his mighty hands the door crumbles Thank you -- And Inigo flies through as Fezzik heads back to Westley
: The Queen, more sprightly, is several paces ahead
(can hardly be understood) Strange wedding
Yes
very strange wedding
Come along
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          110
Buttercup gently stops the King and places a kiss on his forehead
He's very surprised and pleased
What was that for
Because you've always been so kind to me
And  won't be seeing you again since 'm killing myself once we reach the Honeymoon Suite
(smiling away --his hearing isn't what it once was) Won't that be nice
(calling out to the Queen) She kissed me
And on those words -- : And he's running, dashing through corridors and as he glances back -- : behind him, coming like a streak and -- : with the large suit of armor, and Fezzik gaping, staring at all those choices, trying to piece together the puzzle of the missing Westley
: flashing out of one room, down a staircase, picking up his pace
He pulls out a deadly looking dagger, with a sharp point and a triangular shaped blade, and sprints on and -- : ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          111
closing the gap, closer, closer and he's down the stairs and heading into a dining hall and -- : throwing the dagger -- : trying like hell to get out of the way, but no, and it sticks deep into his stomach, and he hurtles back helplessly against the wall of the room, his eyes glazed, blood coming from his wound
The room is going white on him
Sorry, Father
tried
tried
: looking across the room at Inigo
He stares at Inigo's face, and then touches his own cheeks, as memory comes
You must be that little Spanish brat  taught a lesson to all those years ago
It's simply incredible
Have you been chasing me your whole life only to fail now
think that's the worst thing  ever heard
How marvelous
Inigo sinks
: shutting the door of the Honeymoon Suite, crossing quietly to the far wall where she sits at a table, opens a jeweled box, and takes out a very deadly looking dagger
She seems very much at peace as she touches the knife to her bosom
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          112
There's a shortage of perfect breasts in this world
It would be a pity to damage yours
And Buttercup whirls as we -- : lying on the bed
Yellin's sword is beside him
His voice sounds just fine, but he does not move
Buttercup leaps to the bed, covering him with kisses
Westley is helpless
Oh, Westley, darling
(more kisses) Westley, why won't you hold me
(gently) Gently
At a time like this that's all you can think to say
"Gently
" (not so gently) Gently
And she lets go, thumping his head against the headboard and : looking very much surprised
Good heavens
Are you still trying to win
Inigo, struggling feebly, pulling the dagger from his stomach
Holding the wound with his left hand
Rugen is pushing off from the table, sword in hand, moving in to kill Inigo
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          113
You've got an overdeveloped sense of vengeance
It's going to get you into trouble some day
Inigo watches the Count approach, and the Count flicks his sword at Inigo's heart, and there's not much Inigo can do, just kind of vaguely parry the thrust with the six-fingered sword and Count Rugen's blade sinks deeply into Inigo's left shoulder
Inigo doesn't seem to feel it, his other agonies are so much worse
: stepping back, going for the heart again
: And as this blow comes he's trying to use the wall for support in forcing himself to his feet, and it's not a roaring success of an attempt, but he does at least make some progress, and again he manages to parry the thrust, as this time Rugen's sword runs through his right arm
Again, Inigo doesn't seem to mind, doesn't even feel it
: stepping back forj ust a moment, watching as Inigo continues to inch his way to his feet and then, just before the Count is about to strike again, Inigo manages a little flick of his own and Rugen hadn't expected it, and he jumps back, makes a little involuntary cry of surprise and : slowly pushing away from the wall
(all but audible) Hello
My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father; prepare to die
: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          114
suddenly going into a fierce attack, striking with great power and precision for he is a master swordsman, and he forces Inigo easily back, drives him easily into the wall
But he does not penetrate Inigo's defense
None of the Count's blows get home
As the Count steps back a moment -- : pushing slowly off from the wall again
(a little louder) Hello
My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die
: And again he attacks, slashing with wondrous skill
But none of his blows get through and, slowly, Inigo, again moves forward
(a little louder still) Hello
My name is Inigo Montoya
You killed my father
Prepare to die
Stop saying that
: retreating more quickly around the table
Inigo drives for the Count's left shoulder now, thrusts home where the Count had gotten him
Then another move and his blade enters the Count's right shoulder, the same spot Inigo was wounded
(all he's got) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          115
No -- -- offer me money -- And now the six-fingered sword strikes and there is a slash bleeding along one of Rugen's cheeks
-- yes -- -- power too -- promise me that -- The great sword flashes again, and now there is a parallel slash bleeding on Rugen's other cheek
-- all that  have and more please -- -- offer me everything  ask for -- -- anything you want -- (roaring) ,  - -
And on that -- : and almost too fast for the eye to follow, the sword strikes one final time and -- : crying out in fear and panic as the sword hits home dead center and -- : ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          116
the sword clear through the Count
They are almost frozen like that for a moment
Then Inigo withdraws his sword and as the Count pitches down -- : lying dead
His skin is ashen and the blood still pours from the parallel cuts on his cheeks and his eyes are bulging wide, full of fear
: staring at Rugen
And now Inigo does something we have never seen him do before: he smiles
on Inigo smiling, then -- : lies as before, not a muscle has moved, his head is still on the headboard, Yellin's sword at his side
Buttercup is alongside the bed; her eyes never leave his face
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me
What hideous sin have you committed lately
got married
didn't want to
It all happened so fast
It never happened
What
It never happened
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117
But it did
was there
This old man said, "Man and wife
" Did you say, " do"
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part
Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it (a pause) -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness
: entering the room, staring at them
He pulls out his sword
technicality that will shortly be remedied
But first things first
To the death
No
(a little pause) To the pain
(about to charge, stops short) don't think 'm quite familiar with that phrase
'll explain
And 'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon
That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me
: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          118
lying there comfortably, his words quiet at first
It won't be the last
To the pain means the first thing you lose will be your feet, below the ankles, then your hands at the wrists, next your nose
: gripping his sword, watching
-- and then my tongue,  suppose
killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake  don't mean to duplicate tonight
wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right -- (takes step forward) -- and then my ears,  understand
Let's get on with it : : Wrong
Your ears you keep, and 'll tell you why -- : And now he stops, and the look that was in his eyes at the wedding, that look of fear, is starting to return
-- so that every shriek of every child at seeing your hideousness will be yours to cherish -- every babe that weeps at your approach, every woman who cries out, "Dear God, what is that thing
" will echo in your perfect ears
() ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          119
(') That is what "to the pain" means
It means  leave you in anguish, wallowing in freakish misery forever
: doing his best to hide the fear that keeps building inside him
think you're bluffing -- : lying there, staring at him
It's possible, pig --  might be bluffing -- it's conceivable, you miserable vomitous mass, that 'm only lying here because  lack the strength to stand -- then again, perhaps  have the strength after all
And now, slowly, Westley begins to move
His body turns, his feet go to the floor, he starts to stand -- : staring, eyes wide
: And now he is standing, sword in fighting position
(slow and determined) --
: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          120
and he's so panicked he doesn't know whether to pee or wind his watch
He throws his sword to the floor
(to Humperdinck) Have a seat
: speaking to Buttercup as Humperdinck sits
Tie him up
Make it as tight as you like
And as she sets to work -- : entering, looking around
Where's Fezzik
thought he was with you
No
In that case -- his balance betrays him
(to Buttercup) Help him
Why does Westley need helping
Because he has no strength -- : ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          121
and now be starts wrestling mightily with his bonds
knew it
knew you were bluffing
knew he was bluffing
(staring at the Prince) Shall  dispatch him for you
(considers this, then) Thank you, but no -- whatever happens to us,  want him to live a long life alone with his cowardice
(off-screen) Inigo
Inigo, where are you
They look at each other, then move to the balcony, and : leading
He glances up, sees them on the balcony
Ah, there you are
Inigo,  saw the Prince's stables, and there they were, four white horses
And thought, there are four of us, if we ever find the lad -- hello, lad -- so  took them with me, in case we ever bumped into each other
(considers things a moment) guess we just did
: looking down at
, you did something right
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          122
Don't worry --  won't let it go to my head
And as he holds out his great arms-- : : Buttercup floating through the air
What's happening, of course, is that she's jumping from the balcony so Fezzik can catch her
But her fall is in slow motion so you might think she was flying
Westley and Inigo, watching as  catches Buttercup
You know, it's very strange -- have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, don't know what to do with the rest of my life
(as Inigo gets him ready for his jump) Have you ever considered piracy
You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts
Now from that -- : triumphantly racing through the night -- : and at last their trials are done
They stop
(off-screen) They rode to freedom
And as dawn arose, Westley and Buttercup knew they were safe
wave of love swept over them
And as they reached for each other
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          123
As Buttercup and Westley begin their ultimate kiss -- : ' The Grandfather stops reading
What
What
No, it's kissing again
You don't want to hear it
don't mind so much
He gestures for his Grandfather to read
Okay
: locked in a deep, pure and passionate kiss
(off-screen) Since the invention of the kiss, there have been five kisses that were rated the most passionate, the most pure
This one left them all behind
The end
: ' The Grandfather snaps the book closed
Now  think you ought to go to sleep
Okay
(standing, readying to leave) Okay
Okay
Okay
All right
So long
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          124
Grandpa
The Old Man stops, turns
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow
(a beat) As you wish
And his smile is enough
