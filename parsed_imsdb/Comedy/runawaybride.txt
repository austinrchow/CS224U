Screenplay by Sarah Parriott & Josann McGibbon -------------------------------------------------------------- - The wind rustles the endless field of corn, blows over the freshly mown meadow of soybeans, and magically sways a copse of trees
It's a Fall after-noon breaks the peace and
and  burst between the rows of corn into the meadow
They are running for their lives
: The rider is a bride -- a beautiful woman dressed in a disheveled wedding gown, it's train tattered and flying like a knight's banner out behind her
This is
The horse is frothing and wild-eyed, like the bride, who turns to look behind her in terror
The horse's labored breathing mingles with Maggie's panicked gasps
We see a   fly into a ditch as the horse thunders on
Maggie clings to the reins
She looks as though she is running from the devil himself

) Hey, Fisher, pick up
have some column ideas  want to bounce off you
Not there
Okay
Listen 'm thinking of writing about those mind-numbing informercials that are always on
Ike walks out of his apartment building talking on cell phone
(cont'd) What do you think
Good idea, right
Boring, down to death, pointless -- It sucks
Ike yells at a
(cont'd) If you guys are here any longer, they're gonna make you sign a lease
Your column should be so funny
Ike turns and walks down the street, talking into cell phone
Okay,  was also thinking  might write about
He spots a   with tons of diamonds getting out of a Limousine, talking to a
He goes up to her
(cont'd) Excuse me
was thinking of doing an article on limousines
What would you say to people who never had a chance to drive in a limo
They walk up to her
'm sorry,  don't know any people like that
Ike walks off
They stare at him as he goes
- Ike's talking on the phone to his friend's machine again
(into phone) Fisher
Come on --  know you're sitting there laughing at me
Pick up
want to run an idea past you
Ike continues walking now in the full panic of writer's block
He pleads into his friend's answering machine as he walks
(cont'd) (into phone) just could use someone to toss it back and forth with for a few minutes, get the juice flowing, help me
have an hour and twenty-seven minutes and fifty-two seconds
Hello
He walks away from the t-shirt table towards the bar
The Vendor calls out to him
- Hey, Ike, when are you going to put me in an article
When your t-shirts stop shrinking
Ike enters the bar
The Woman drops the shirt she was holding and walks off with her children
The -shirt Vendor goes back to selling his shirts
- Ike sits at the bar speaking to an attractive Woman nearby, a puts is  Today on the bar and addresses the
see photos of a lot of dead writers on these walls
Got any living ones
have a story to tell that could win one of them a Pulitzer
(then, with enthusiasm) Picture this, if you will
small town in Maryland, a sleepy little village, within that a hardware store
The Man continues speaking as Ike and the woman continue their conversation
So what's in store for us in tomorrow's column
don't know yet
'm kind of a last- minute man
Ideas don't flow until an hour or two before deadline
The Woman gets up and begins throwing darts
(interrupting) This is very interesting
You get your ideas for your column from life
You start up a conversation with a woman in a bar, attack her choice of reading material, try and get a rise out of her while you contemplate whether or not she's worth hitting on
No,  can't hit on you until  get an idea
She starts throwing darts
That's flattering
No, you don't understand
The Woman goes to her bar stool, gathering her bag and leaves a tip for the Bartender
think  do understand
So my not responding to your baiting me will inspire one of those potential bitter diatribes you love to write about women and all the things we do to drive men crazy
(taken aback) don't write bitter diatribes about women
very often
She whacks him with a newspaper, then shakes his hand
Only when the ideas aren't flowing, huh
Well, it was very nice to meet you, one-minute man
The Woman leaves the bar
(as she exits) That's last minute man
(then, louder) And it's the quality that counts
You know, for a good looking man, you strike out a lot
've seen much worse
The phone rings
Te Bartender answers it as Ike sits back on his bar stool
Ike grabs the woman's magazine that she left on the bar and starts glancing at it
The Man at the bar has heard the whole thing
(cont'd) said, 've seen much worse
Ike looks at the Man with reservation
The Man is George Swilling
Excuse me
The brush-off
Ike gets up and moves to the dart board
He removes the darts
(cont'd) 've witnessed far more treacherous and nefarious exits than that
At least she castigated you in private
Not as private as  thought
Ike turns slightly, giving the man his back
(cont'd) Kevin, you've got some napkins
Writing or wiping
Give me a pen
The Bartender gives him cocktail napkins and a pen
Ike starts making notes
Ike looks up from his writing
The Man gets up and starts throwing darts
(throwing darts hard) Ah, come on
They deserve it
They love you, they hate you, they're hot, they're cold, they're high, they're low
They're up, they're down
It's really fun making this list with you, but 've got a column to go write
Ike
(undeterred) But you don't have a really superb idea
Well, there's a girl from my hometown you could write about
Ike moves to the Bartender and pays him
(to Man) Excuse me, we don't need any new ideas
She likes to dump grooms right at the altar
They call her "The Runaway Bride"
Both Ike and Bartender turn and stare
She performed the travesty seven or eight times
Right at the altar she turns around and runs like hell
Bolts
Ike turns and heads for the door
The Man calls after him, getting up from his stool without stopping his enthusiastic story
(cont'd) Adios
Plows down the aisle, knocking old ladies out of her way like the running of the bulls at Pamplona
And guess what
give up
She has the next victim all lined up
She's twirling another body on the spit
Ike stops in his tracks
He turns back around in spite of himself
(beginning his story) Imagine if you will, a small town in Maryland
: '  - Ike sits at his computer, cassette player with Miles Davis next to him as he types away reading his handiwork to himself
(reading) "Today is a day of profound introspection,  have been accused of using this column to direct bitter diatribes at the opposite sex
This uncomfortable accusation has plunged me into at least fifteen minutes of serious reflection, from which  have emerged with the conclusion that, yes --  traffic in female stereotypes
" - walks through the main office reading the paper
"But how can one blame me when every time  step out my front door  meet fresh proof that the female archetypes are alive and well
Te mother, the virgin, the whore, the crone; they're elbowing you in the subway, stealing your cabs, and overwhelming you with perfume in elevators
" - Elaine at her desk reads aloud to herself
"But perhaps, in fairness to the fairer sex,  do need to broaden my horizon and add some new goddesses to the pantheon:  would like to nominate for deity
" Fisher hands a file to Elaine
"
The cheerleader, the coed, and the man-eater, the last of which concerns me most today
" Fisher leaves and we hold a  Today sign
: - The Man comes out of the men's room reading the  Today, Kevin, the Bartender, stands on the bar reading the same article
(reads) "To be fair, the man-eater isn't exactly new
In Ancient Greece, this fearsome female was known as Erinys, the devouring death goddess
In India, she is Kali, who likes to devour her boyfriend Shiva's entrails while her yoni devour his -- dot dot dot, never mind
In Indonesia, the bloody-jawed man-eater is called Ragma
" Te Man sits at the bar near to the Bartender
You noticed these are all countries without cable
(then, continues reading) "
And in Hale, Maryland where she helps run the family hardware store
She is known as Miss Maggie Carpenter " (mispronounces) "
, the Runaway Bride
" : - read the above article
/
/ ,  - and
exit the parlor and stroll down the street
(lowers her paper and reads
) (cont'd) "
And in Hale, Maryland where she helps run the family hardware store
" (to the Women) We have to go to Maggie
Cindy, mind the shop
(exits salon; continues reading) "
She is known as Miss Maggie Carpenter, , the Runaway Bride
" Holy moly
The older one, Mrs
Pressman, listens with a pained expression as the younger one, Peggy, continues to read the column aloud
Neither one can believe what they're reading
(reads) "What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them
She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar
" can't ready anymore
(takes paper from her, reads) "And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance
So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race
before the rice hits the ground" (then) Holy moly
Peggy and Mrs
Pressman step into a hardware store
- Peggy and Mrs
Pressman enter, worried
You tell Maggie
No, you tell her
No, no
You're her best friend
No
(holding her newspaper) You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet
Yeah
Maybe she hasn't read the paper
On the counter, they see a copy of  Today opened to the article about Maggie
(cont'd) Or not
We follow  down the back stairs inside The Hale Hardware Store, the prettiest, most welcoming shop of its kind anywhere in small town
Somehow the place ha taken on the spirit of the owner's daughter; both stop and shop-girl radiate brightness, charm, and possibility
Maggie comes down steps with a faucet handle and goes to an elderly customer,
(bright) Here we go
One antique hot water handle with the "" still on it, guaranteed to fit any American Standard cast iron tub with a four-inch center made between 1924 and 1938
In other words,  think you're out of the doghouse with Mrs
Paxton
(amazed) Hallelujah
Alright, Mr
Paxton, 'll put it on your account
Maggie rounds the bend, another customer, , stands by the paint machine
Maggie
(walking past customer) You don't need an air conditioner, Earl, you just need an attic fan -- There's more in the back
Maggie steps behind the front counter of the store and takes the account book out
Her voice trails off as she sees the dour expression on the faces of her friends
(cont'd) What
Peggy nervously mentions the newspaper
(delicate) So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh
(serious) Yes, 've seen it
And  have to say it's the rudest and most offensive
joke anybody's ever played on me
To their amazement, Maggie starts smiling
(cont'd) You guys
How long did this take you
Maggie stays amused
(cont'd) Where'd you get this done
(laughing) You creeps
should disinvite you
And why did you say seven times
This is four
Uh, Maggie, you told us to bachelorette jokes, so we didn't
Maggie looks at the stricken face of her friends
Holy moly
Peggy looks like she is going to cry with sympathy for Maggie
Maggie is starting to feel uncomfortable
She looks down, dubiously, at the paper
Um, you know, now would be a good moment to tell me this is fake
(no response) It won't be funny if you drag it out
Okay
(no response) Okay, well
mean,  can find out
Real newspapers smear
Phoney papers don't
She picks up the paper and brushes it against her apron, leaving an
She nearly kneels over
(cont'd) (sitting) Bag
Peggy and Mrs
Pressman immediately spring to her side
They give her a bag to breathe in
Bag
: '  / - We see Maggie kickboxing in anger
The radio is on
She suddenly stops, yanks Ike's article off the wall, leaves her workout area and goes to her desk
: She turns off the radio and begins to type her letter
(
) "Dear Editor
" -  - As Maggie's - continues to read her letter, we take in a Manhattan busy day
It is big, loud, and anonymous
(
; cont'd) "Greeting from the sticks
Perhaps you believe that a rural education is focused mainly on hog calling and tractor maintenance rather than reading
Why else would you print a piece of fiction about me and call it fact
" Te   Ike, striding across a busy street, dodging taxies
smacks him with a newspaper
He passes a , then a hot dog stand
He greets and passes a to a  Today Truck
(
; cont'd) " suppose Mr
Graham was too busy thinking us slanderous statements about how  dump men for kicks to bother with something silly like accuracy in reporting
Which is understandable, because with a "man-eater" like me on the loose, who has time to check facts
" - He passes regular  who cheer him
(
; cont'd) "Still, we cannibalistic queens can get pretty cranky when we see things in print that hurt our feelings, like that we deliberately abandon fiances with malice aforethought
" - He enters the newspaper building, going to Ellie's office
- He walks through the crowded city room
His arrival attracts a lot of attention from his -
Ike seems a little surprised, but he's pleased
(
; cont'd) "That's why  was surprised to find Mr
Graham's editor was a woman
Call me a sentimental fool, but  sort of hoped we man-eater could stick together
" Ike works his way down the hall to the editor's office Ike greets various workers
He steps up to the editor's secretary,
She doesn't smile
(to Elaine) 'll put in a good word for you
No, no, don't mention my name in there
Why
buzz
You can go in now
Ike goes into Ellie's office
Elaine picks up her phone
: '  - is that editor
Stylish and successful looking, she's about Ike's age
Ellie sits behind a big desk with a scowl on her pretty face
Her casual-looking husband, Fisher, sits nonchalantly on the arm of the couch
Ike enters as Ellie reads Maggie's letter
(reading letter) "Anyway, 'm just dropping you big city folk this little note to say that  have thought of a ritual sacrifice that would satisfy my current appetite: Ike Graham's column on a platter
Yours truly, Maggie Carpenter
-- have inclosed a list of the gross factual misrepresentations in your article
There are fifteen
" Ike sits as Ellie puts the letter down and takes off her glasses
(chuckles as he sits) Fully
like her
She has wit
left four messages
You don't return my calls
So
never returned your calls, even when we were married
And what's Fisher doing here anyway
Fisher gets and places a photo of the cat on a bookshelf on his way to the other side of the room
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support
Since when does Ellie need moral supp-- -- It's for you, Ike
What
Journalism lesson number one
If you fabricate your facts, you get fired
Ellie pushes  Today lawyer's letter across the desk for him to read
Ike picks it up and skims the letter
His face is as impassive as stone
Lesson number two
Never work for your former spouse
That's not nothing to do with it
You cooked this story up and you know it
didn't cook up a story
had a source
Someone reliable, 'm sure
booze- hound in a bar
In vino veritas
Don't knock drunk guys in bars
Drunk guys in bars are good
It means they're not driving
Ike gets up and stands near Ellie, making his point
(cont'd) Besides, 'm a columnist
This is what columnists are supposed to do
This is what you like
We push, we stretch, we go out on a limo
That's what makes me good
No, that's what makes you unemployed
merely write the stuff
You're the one that serves it up
Ike puts down the letter and puts his glasses back into his pocket
Not anymore
have to draw the line
(pushing a piece of paper) She sent us this list
Our lawyers say it's actionable
Ellie hands Ike Maggie's list
(scoffs) Lawyers
(glances at list) don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is going to be very tough on you
It's going to be hard to get over
There will be therapy bills for you
(shrugs) already made an appointment for later today
(putting the list down, standing) See
You want custody of my job
Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel 've served my time
'm sorry, Ike
This is permanent
Fisher winces and looks away
Ike and Ellie look at each other for a sober moment
(
; cont'd) If you go quietly, 'll get you severance pay
Ellie fidgets with her toy rake, then Ike heads for the door
He laughs a little at the painful truth of her words and walks out
Ellie collapses back in her chair
Fisher goes to her and rubs her shoulders
- Ike rides sadly on the back of a forklift, gets off and walks out
- ' : train goes by
modest clapboard house with a porch
Two entrances
tosses a paper onto the lawn in front of the house
The front door opens and Maggie appears fresh out of bed, wearing only a jacket and panties
Heedless of being seen this way, she scampers out to the sidewalk to pick up her delivered paper:   Today
She tears off the plastic bag and rips into it, looking for her letter
She finds it
smile on her face, then she scampers back into the house
'  - Maggie skips back into her house which she shares with Father and Grandma
cozy and eclectic place creatively furnished on a shoe-string
She rushes into:     , fiance #4, is packing cans into a backpack
Bob, 38, has a pleasant face and a body that is almost shockingly buff
He's wearing a -shirt that reads: "Mountaineers Do It Against the Wall
", Maggie dances over, waving the paper and singing
She canned him, she canned him
Bob test the weight of the backpack adding dehydrate food
Come here, Mag, and try this on
Maggie puts the paper on the kitchen counter and starts to read aloud, paying no mind to Bob, who is sticking her arms through the straps of the backpack
Listen: "Dear Ms
Carpenter, apologize to you for this unfortunate matter
Ike Graham's column will no longer be appearing in this paper
Best of luck in you upcoming marriage
" Bob continues to hold up the weight of the backpack as he straps it onto Maggie's shoulders
That-a-girl
You sacked him
(checking pack) This is the weight of the pack you're going to have to carry in the Himalayas
Tell me if it's too heavy
Bob lets go and Maggie  , disappearing behind the counter, and hitting the floor, with a
Bob looks down at her
Maggie's voice rises from the floor behind the counter
(o
s
) It's a little
It's a little heavy
Help me, baby
Bob has no answer
He reaches a hand down
He yelps as Maggie pulls him down on top of her, out of frame
We  them giggle and kiss
- Fisher uses the dock for a photo shoot featuring men and women in evening and formal wear from Escada for
Fisher is not actually shooting the camera, but rather supervising it
Fisher claps his hands and calls the models to attention
Then he goes onto the stage and sets the models in their positions
(cont'd) Remember, we are putting the "fun" back into formal
(to Ike) just say that for the agency guys don't even know what that means
Now follow me
- Elevator doors open
Ike and Fisher exit and walk towards the coffee table
Ike,  really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since  do freelance stuff for
, 'm in a different position now
What are you trying to say to me, Fish
They stop walking
Vindication
How would you like to get some
chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct
(hiding his hope) The real story on Miss Carpenter
All the gory details
They start walking again
(excited) The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again
(enthusiastically) This is good
It is a good story, Fish
They stop at the coffee table and grab something to eat
(nods) If she runs, then it's a cover story
All true
All accurate
(confesses) Okay, you were right
hated my column, but  can do this assignment
Then you've got it
If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot
"Paid vindication"  That's what  call justice
Justice, yes
Paid,  don't know
They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints
But 'll get my normal fee, right
He walks away
You want me to do it on spec
He follows him
: - We see Ike driving down the highway
The car sputters a little as he and Fisher continue their conversation in voice-over
(If needed by the editor
) (
) Don't say "spec" like it's a dirty word
Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play
Plato never got a book advance
(
) Oh yeah
happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car
We hear Fisher laugh
(
; cont'd) 'm going to make this work, Fish
'm going to do it
Ike's car drives into Hale, passing a billboard reading, "Welcome to Hale
" : - Ike drives down picturesque Main Street
He passes Hale Hardware
Sign says: "At Curl
Be back soon
" - is singing in front of the only hotel in town
Ike pulls up and goes inside
/  - Ike has checked into the Atlantic Hotel
The clerk, , hands him his key
Ike asks about room service and the restaurant
An   asks him if he plays bridge as he goes up the stairs to his room
- Ike exits his hotel as the Barber Shop Quartet finishes singing "Camptown Races
" He now walks down the charming main artery of the town, looking exactly like what he is:  a cynical New York out of his element on sunny Main Street,
ride by on bikes, streaming balloons behind them
balloon hits Ike on the face
As he crosses the street, he mutters into his tape recorder: think 'm in Maryberry
Flags hang on all the storefronts and the place sparkles with wholesome attitudes as  greet each other familiarly
Ike comes to beauty parlor called "Curl Up and Dye"
The place is doing business and crowded with
- Cindy, the manicurist, does Mrs
Pressman's nails
Maggie sits on the floor next to Peggy's salon chair, fixing the base of a barber chair
She tightens a screw and looks up, satisfied
Cindy's dog is on the floor near Maggie
Cindy, you better 86 Sprout
He seems to be enjoying the petroleum distillates
Cindy rolls over in her chair, picks up her dog and rolls back to her station
That's it
Back to obedience school
(to Peggy) Okay -- have a seat
gently, carefully
Peggy sits in the chair
Maggie spins her around and around
(delighted as she spins) You're a goddess
didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid
Stop it
When you talk like that, get turned on and it frightens me
Ike enters the salon, taking off his sunglasses
Peggy hops off the chair
Hello
'm looking for Maggie Carpenter
There was a sign at the hardware store across the street
Are you a reporter
It's a little early in the game for Ike to be thrown off guard
(shocked) What
(eyeing his loafers) It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie
About her upcoming wedding and all
No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired
Ike smiles down at his loafers and shrugs
am just such a reporter
And you are
Peggy Phleming
Not the ice skater
Peggy steps aside
Ike moves toward Cindy and Mrs
Pressman
And who are these lovely ladies
Te ladies shake his hand and introduce themselves
Cindy
Maggie's unmarried cousin
Mrs
Pressman
No relation
And you are
(turning toward her) Looking for Maggie
Yep
Maggie -- Someone to see you
Maggie looks over from her sitting position on the floor
She gives Ike the once-over, focusing on the shoes
(yelling to Peggy) Reporter
Yup
Ike crouches to see Maggie on the floor just as she rises to her feet
Ike straightens up
For a moment, he is thrown by her beauty and intelligent eyes
hope you have a different angle
It's pretty much all been covered
Originality is my speciality
Excellent
Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut
She's the boss
Sorry, no
just got one
(to Ike) Excuse me, sir
have an actual fact for you
(steps to Mrs
Pressman) Yes, Mrs
Pressman
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know
Not seven like they said
know
Tell me something
Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time
During the Ike/Mrs
Pressman exchange, Maggie looks at Ike
There's something familiar about him
She looks over at Peggy and beckons her to a copy of Ike's column affixed to a mirror
goatee and horns, have been scrawled on Ike's byline picture
He's been "devilized"
Peggy coughs as she recognizes Ike in the newspaper clipping
She swallowed her gun
Mrs
Pressman continues her story to Ike
'm not sure
Mr
Schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't
He says she's so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds on her
'm going to wait to hear what the pros say
Good fact
Well, you let me know
Oh,  will
: Maggie indicates column to Peggy
She looks over at the part of the shop used to wash and dye hair
There's a sink, stool and a cabinet affixed to the wall above sink, which holds various shampoos and hair dyes
Maggie gets an idea
Maggie and Peggy step forward toward Ike
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash
You know, get all that city grit out of it
You'll answer my questions
Maggie nods affirmatively
(cont'd) (removing his jacket) Fine
You wash, 'll ask the questions
Great
Ike hands Peggy his jacket
mystified Peggy leads Ike to the sink
While she does this
Have a seat
Peggy, why don't you give him the special treatment that strengthens the follicles
Ike sits in the chair near the sink
Maggie shakes out a smock and puts it around Ike
(cont'd) So, what do you want to know
Ike leans and rests his head on the sink
Peggy bends over him and wets his hair
She grabs various hair coloring products
Getting nervous
Nervous
Not at all
No
've never been more certain in my life
Except --  am having all kinds of weird dreams
Ike pulls the cloth down from over his face
Weird dreams
You're going to tell me about them
Yes
(calming) Let's just put this back here for the aromatherapy
Peggy recovers his face, then continues to fuss with the hair coloring products
Maggie helps
- Ike sits with a towel over his head as Peggy blow-dries the back of his head
His back is to the mirror, his body faces Maggie
Cindy does her own nails as Mrs
Pressman scratches off lottery tickets
The dog, Sprout, sits in is basket
In another one
, wearing a hat, comes in the front door of the salon
Hey, Pete, 'll be right with you
Ike peeks out from under his towel as Maggie continues
'm inside the church
Everyone  know is there, only they're not really them
They're like Frankenstein monsters, but without the bolts coming out of their necks
It's all very "Night of the Living Dead"
And here's the creepiest part --  look down at my dress and it's red
mean,  have no idea what it means
Red's not my color
Ike listens intently and stares steadily into her eyes
Peggy removes the towel
His hair is divided into equal parts and dyed orange and red
(cont'd) So what do you think
Ike stares back at her, the tickle of suspicion creeping up his spine
think you'd look good in red
No, she's talking about your hair
Maggie swivels his chair so that Ike faces the mirror
Ike looks at his brightly colored hair
You're all ready for football season, Mr
Graham
Ike stares at his hair in total confusion
With icy calm, Ike rises from his chair and primps the end of his hair as if giving it the finishing touches
Then he sees his defaced newspaper clipping and all becomes clear
He picks up the article and shows it to everyone
Ike does a slow burn
Yes,  think  nailed the personality profile of the women of Hale
Ike turns and puts the clipping up on the mirror
(cont'd) (to Peggy) My jacket, please
Peggy hands him his jacket
(cont'd) (sarcastically) Thank you
Ike moves toward the door
He spots Pete
(cont'd) (putting on jacket; to Pete) Excuse me, Pete, do you know a place that sells shampoo
Strong shampoo
Doc's Pharmacy
Third and Elm
Tell him Pete sent you
Want my hat
No thanks
Ike smiles at Maggie and exits
(to Peggy) He seems crabby
: - In front of beauty salon, Maggie follows Ike out
If you're looking for Elm Street, it's that way
She puts on her sunglasses
Thank you
He walks the other way
If you came down here in the pursuit of happiness, you might as well go back
Because you can't make me feel bad
She stops walking and turns to Ike
'm not here to make you feel bad
'm here for vindication
In my heart
You have one
Ike walks back to Maggie
feel 'm right about you
You got me fired, lady
You destroyed my reputation and you screwed up my hair
You chew men up, spit them out and loved it
And 'm down here to satisfy myself on that point
stare at Ike's hair and giggle
Did something happen to make you care about reality
Yes
Conviction
Conviction that 'm onto the truth
You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three
You're going to run again
And 'm not leaving until you do
You're going to be very disappointed
We'll see
'd love to stay and chat, but 've got to get back to work
still have my job
He stares at her for a beat, stung by her words
have nothing to hide, Mr
Graham
Talk to whoever you want
You might actually stumble upon a fact or two
Maggie walks away
Ike walks a few steps and stops at a  on a bike
Hey, kid, 'll give you ten bucks for your hat
Kid agrees
Ike puts the hat on and starts to cross the street
An   walks by and hits him with a newspaper
Ike is stunned
'  - Maggie pulls into the driveway in her truck
She's in a fine mood as she walks right in the house
'  - Bob, Walter, and Maggie's   sit in the living room
Grandma is sewing one of Maggie's wedding veils
Walter drinks wine, Ike wears a hat
You know, when  only see one dog, know 've had too much to drink
Te family dog, Skipper, sits near a ceramic dog table
Maggie smiles as she walks in the front door and puts down her tool box and bag
You'll never guess who came crawling into town with his tail between his legs
(o

) Who
Maggie enters the parlor to see Ike smiling evilly from his seat on the couch
(cont'd) (innocently) Hello, Maggie
just came by to apologize to your family
(looks to Walter) When 'm wrong, 'm wrong
pushed a story
made a mistake
In other words -- he's only human
An he brought us a bottle of wine
Raises the bottle to Maggie
They made me put my hat back on
Oh, yeah
Scared the hell out of Skipper
You've got to be kidding me
Maggie stares at them both
(enjoying the moment) No, no, you should have seen Skipper
(then, imitates growling) It wasn't that funny
Maggie gives him a look that says, "You are not absolved
"  She smiles stiffly, looking back at Ike
She then sits on the arm of Bob's chair and puts her arm on his shoulder
So, the forces of good and evil have already met
Maggie takes the wine bottle from the table next to Walter
She snaps a look to Bob, who follows her
'll help you take into the kitchen
Check on the crabs, Bob
We overhear them murmuring in annoyed tones about the wedding plans as they exit
Walter puts down his drink
Gee,  hope they don't have a fight out there
You don't think they'll call it off
Well, wedding cake freezes
This we know
You know, your daughter seems
Ike notices that he's been sewn to the veil
Sorry
That's okay, Grandma
Grandma cuts the thread and separates the veil from Ike's sleeve
(cont'd) (continuing his thought) Like such a lovely girl
Walter points to a portrait painting on the wall
Like her mother
(seeing the portrait) Ah, beautiful
(gets up to admire the portrait) just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that
Oh, yes, you can
She's has 'em all on tape
She has a tape
(good-natured) Yeah
Lee at the hotel videos wedding
mean Maggie didn't know she was going to make the hundred-yard dash
Walter gestures to a pile of video cassettes on the bookcase
Ike checks on the tapes
Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday
Gotta tell you this about my daughter
My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels
Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest
Walter cracks up
(sarcastically) Ha ha
:   tape
It reads: "Maggie , ,
"  Ike's interest is more than piqued
Ike picks it up
They get up and go to the dining room
: /'  - The family dog, Skipper, steals food from the table
Walter scolds him
Walter whacks his crab with his hammer and Ike copies him
(cont'd) Emma and  were only blessed with one child, not for lacking of trying
This is good, Dad, don't leave anything out
Ike's hammer flies out of his hand
He goes to pick it up
So 've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings
Not this one
This one's on me
Walter reacts
That's fair
Despite what you think,  don't do it on purpose
And  have no intention of doing it again
That's right, Maggie
Just keep your eye on the ball
Ike raises his eyebrows in question
Bob explains
(cont'd) Sports psychology
It was my major in college
Ahh
(false modesty) 'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer
Big advocate of the mind and body combining for success
You could say or you can quote me, 'm a glass half full king of guy
(boasting) Bob's the head of the
department at the high school
And he coaches the football team
And he's climbed Everest
To Maggie's satisfaction, Ike shoots Bob a look of begrudging respect
Nobody who's been up Everest is a total clown
(impressed) Everest
Is that right
Twice
Really
(sticking it to Ike) Without oxygen
My girl likes to brag about me
Bob and Maggie kiss Ike two little love-birds
(cont'd) 'm taking her trekking on Annapurna on our honeymoon
Ike is highly amused
How romantic
(sharply) We think so
Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two Sherpas and a yak
Walter cracks up, Maggie shoots Ike a look
He smiles back
: '  /
'  () Fisher and Ellie are exercising
Fisher is on a cycle machine
Ellie does yoga stretches
Ike sits back on the couch, puts on his glasses and watches a video taped wedding playing on the screen
Superimposed titles read "Brian Norris wedding
" (to Fisher; into phone) You won't believe what 'm looking at, Fisher
videotape of all three train wrecks
- Two flower girls and Peggy enter a crowded church where the groom, Brian, and his best man wait at the altar
Now we see Maggie come down the aisle, then walk past the altar
We see Maggie move away another aisle and out of the church
rise in horror, as she runs from this first wedding
She drags the train boy up the second aisle as she leaves
Ike hangs up
He gets up to pick up the remote and then sits back down to watch
The tape fast-forwards to the next wedding
Now Ike is looking at a much more relaxed, hipper, backyard wedding
It says, "Gill Chavez Wedding"
He hits the fast-forward button (sometimes slowing down)
: We see the Carpenter's backyard
It is Gill and Maggie's wedding day
The yard is crowded with a  of Hells Angels-types, Deadheads and townspeople
The "altar" is a band platform against the back fence
Gill is waiting on the platform with a rock combo playing Grateful Dead-type music
He makes an introductory speech
Maggie steps out onto the back porch
She's beautiful in a hippie-type wedding ensemble
She walks with her father to a trampoline
We can see her tattoo
She jumps on the trampoline, then dives into the crowd
They watch her and body surf her over their heads to the back fence
As she hits the stage, she looks at Peggy and Gill, then decides to go
She jumps off the stage and runs up to a passing  on a dirt bike
She jumps on and turns and waves as she rides away
During the video, Ike scribbles: "Gill Chavez"
Maggie goes off on dirt bike
The tape fast-forwards to the last of Maggie's fiascoes
' He now sees the third wedding
It's outdoors, in a tree lined area,  plays
Ike laughs as he discovers that Maggie approaches the altar on horseback, in a simple white dress, wearing a crown of flowers
The Maid Marian look
Ike slows the tape
:   , "  "
As Maggie rides down the aisle, suddenly the horse whinnies
Maggie has kicked it in the shins
It rears and bolts, galloping off with the bride
Ike   the tape on an image of Maggie, hair blowing
Although she is panic-stricken, her soul seems to shine through in tat single frame
As Ike stares at her, the smirk fades from his face
He just looks at her, allowing himself to see her expression, her eyes
He can't help it
She gets to him
Ike gets a restless look on his face
He stares closely
The groom is George from the bar
Kamikaze
: - Establishing
High angle wide shot of a bakery in Hale
Ike exits a neighboring shop and walks down the block
He pauses in front of the bakery to take a look at Maggie's truck
As he does, a middle-aged Black  walks by and whacks him with a newspaper
Ike is stunned as she walks off
He turns to a sitting on a bench
Did you see that
: - a group of plastic grooms and brides on a counter top
is behind the counter helping Maggie with a selection of grooms for her wedding cake
The groom figures are spread out on the counter
All sizes and colors, some attached to brides, some solo, some tuxes, some in dinner jackets
This one's very popular, but oh, you've used this one before
Brian
But like the white dinner jacket
No, he's no good
Too blond
(picks up another) We'll go with total traditional
Too dark
Then, Ike comes up behind her as she discards another groom
But he's got the Bobster's eyes
Maggie cringes at the sound of Ike's voice
(cont'd) No -- the Bobster's eyes are closer set
She ignores him and continues her search
(cont'd) (to Mrs
Trout) Could  have two coffees, please
And what is that wonderful smell
(seeing the cinnamon rolls) 'll have two of those delicious looking cinnamon rolls
Sure
(picking up a miniature bride) Here, Maggie
think this makes the best you
Mrs
Trout steps away to get his order
Ike moves to the other side of Maggie and picks up the bride and groom figure
Let's see
Excuse me, isn't that cute
Ahh
He makes the bride figure repeatedly knock the groom figure in the head and run away screaming
(cont'd) Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
Oh, help me
Help me
Yup
That's her all right
Mrs
Trout just about bursts a gut laughing
Maggie takes the bride from Ike coldly
You must be that Mr
Graham fellow
Ike turns and goes to her
Yes,  am
And who are you
Betty Trout
Five dollars
(as he pays) Oh, Betty
take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing -- (interrupting) -- The luau for Maggie
She starts picking lint off his sleeve and buttons his cuff
(all smiles for Mrs
Trout) Grandma made me the cutest outfit can't wait to show it to you
(cynical delight) pre-wedding luau
Yes
My husband and  love luaus
It'll be fun
Mrs
Trout turns and grabs Ike's bag containing two coffees
Fun
Fun isn't the word
Mrs
Trout beams
Maggie understands his answer a little better
Mrs
Trout hands Ike his items and he pays
If you're still in town, you should stop by
No, 'm sure he doesn't
(to Mrs
Trout) Actually,  would love to come
(taps her service bell) Thank you
Thank you so much
Maggie steps over, carrying her bride and groom figure choices
(exasperated) Is that what you're going to do now
Follow me around everywhere  go
Ike smiles at Maggie enigmatically as he picks up his order and heads for the door
No
He starts to leave with his bag
Mrs
Trout stops him
(handing him the other bag) Your two cinnamon rolls
Bye, Betty
Thanks
He leaves
He's not a nice person
Maggie hands Mrs
Trout her bride and broom figures
Maggie looks at Mrs
Trout, suddenly nervous
She dashes out
Mrs
Trout imitates Ike bamming the bride and groom, laughing
: - Various High School   practice
Maggie strides across the football field, a scowl on her face
few job past Maggie, doing laps
boy, , calls out to her affectionately as she passes
One of them, , slows his pace to run alongside Maggie
(playful) Maggie, don't marry Coach
Marry me
love you
You're jail bait, Dennis
Go away
Run your laps
Go
Go
Dennis runs on as Maggie continues toward her goal: Bob and Ike, standing together on the other side of the field
They're both standing on the blocking sled
Wave after wave of ram into the sled and drive it across the field with both Ike and Bob on top of it
Ike is munching on one of the cinnamon rolls as Bob pushes the
Drive
Drive
From your hips, get low, get low, get low
Next
Ike smiles broadly atop of the sled as he sees Maggie approaching, looking mighty peeved
He nudges Bob and points to Maggie
Bob lights up at the sight of her
(cont'd) Good job, gentlemen
Special teams
The football players move away from the sled
Bob moves to Maggie, leaves Ike alone
(cont'd) (to Maggie) Hey, honey
Bob kisses and embraces Maggie
She doesn't see Ike immediately, then: (indicating Ike) What is he up to now
Ike just came by to check out the team
And talk about you
Ike grins and shows Maggie the notes in his pocket
Bob -- are you making friends with this man
'm just bragging about how great you are
'm the luckiest man alive
Bob grabs Maggie around the waist and smooches her adoringly
Maggie scowls at Ike
He nods, all charm
Well -- 've got to get moving -- lot of work to do today
'll see you two love-birds later
Ike leaves
Bob calls after him
See you at the wedding
You bet ya, Coach
Maggie is aghast
She stares at Bob
Ike joins in behind a line of peppy cheerleaders
At the wedding
You invite him
Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me
Sure  do
But the bet defense is a good offense, right
You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game
You don't understand this guy
Let him come to the wedding
You're not running, right
Say it
"'m not
" (irritably) 'm not running
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right
All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade
've got news for you
No amount of sugar and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take on a picnic
Bob gives Maggie a big hug
Where's that homemade sunshine
Bob blows his whistle, then puts Maggie on the football sled
(cont'd) want you boys to take my princess on the ride of her life
Honey, tell 'em where you parked your car
Maggie screams as the boys push her down the football field
/ - Maggie kneels, hands folded reverently
The booth's grate opens before her
Bless me, Father, for  have sinned
My last confession was
ahh
She tries to recall
(cont'd) Anyway,  have sort of a technical question here
've been having -- bad thoughts
mean, really bad thoughts Of an impure nature
No -- like -- 'm having a problem with that whole turn-the-other-cheek concept
want revenge
want to destroy this guy's life, career, everything
On the sin scale, how big is that
mean, can  "Hail Mary" my way out of it
Child, any sin in one's heart is
(impatient) The name's Maggie
It wasn't this side of ten years ago that you had your tongue down my throat
So don't call me "child", Brian
It annoys me
/ Now don't get upset
Brian closes the confessional window and exits (still inside the booth) Brian, open up
Don't ignore me
Brian leans into her confessional
She steps out to join him
You're not even Catholic, Maggie -- you really shouldn't come to confession
He's a nice looking and gentle man
They regard each other for a beat
'm sorry
'm just so stressed out about that slime-ball reporter being in town
jus had to come warn you he might show up here and start asking you all kinds of ridiculous questions
Brian moves away
Maggie follows and sits in a nearby pew
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question
The rest weren't so bad
(sliding along the pew) What
You talked to him
Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest
Yes, yes, 'm sure  only did you good, Maggie
What did he ask
woman,
, rushes in
Father, am  too late
No, no
It won't take long
Jus two venials
The woman goes into the confessional booth to wait
Only respectful things
What did we have in common back then
What kind of music did you like
Did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar
And what did you say
How could  be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended
(relieved) Good one
Thanks
It happens to be how  feel
Brian sits next to Maggie
God
Of course
'm sorry --  mean, 'm
(sighs) Brian -- 've got to go
The man's a lunatic, but  know exactly where he's going next
God bless you, Maggie
She turns to rush out, then stops herself
Oh, wait, my purse
She moves to the confessional, knocks, then speaks to Mrs
Murphy
(cont'd) Excuse me, sorry, forgot my purse
Good luck
Maggie closes the booth curtain and turns to Brian
(cont'd) Wait -- what was the ridiculous question he asked
Brian smiles mischievously
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs
Weird
Like after all those years you would remem-- She starts to go, then stops in her tracks as she hears: (interrupting) -- Scrambled, with salt, pepper and dill
Same as me
Maggie  looks at Brian
Suddenly, she remembers too
(tenderly) 'm really sorry that  hurt you, Brian
'm happy here, where 'm supposed to be
But if you ever become a Catholic, may  ask you a favor, Maggie
Of course
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on
Of course
And she scampers out
Brian goes back into the confessional
'  - Maggie drives up to an old brick firehouse that is now an auto garage
The faded sign reads: "Gill's Garage"
'  - Maggie rushes inside and looks around
No one is in sight
Several cars, including a yellow jeep-like car up on a hydraulic lift, are in the funky garage
Gill
Lydia
Gill
, coming from the nearby back room, we hear loud muttering in Spanish, then out stumbles  , 34, wearing a grease- stained Grateful Dead tie-dyed -shirt
He grins triumphantly, worshipfully cradling a   in his hands
Hey --  found it
Maggie regards her former fiance with patient warmth
Found what
Gill looks up and gives Maggie a fond, hazy smile
Mags
Hey, look -- The tape from the Radio City Music Hall concert -- Remember that night  as trying to get Jerry to let me sit in on "Ripple"
He pulls out the cassette from its case
It's broken
The tape is dangling from the cassette
(cont'd) (disappointed) Oh, 'll play it for you
Gill picks up an electric  and starts to play
(shouts over the music) Listen, Gill -- There's this reporter who's ben making my life a living hell If he comes by here, don't talk to him
And whatever yo do
(crosses to Gill) Don't show him that picture of me at the concert in San Francisco -- Suddenly, a loud  emanates from the car overhead
(cont'd) What was that
Maggie stops Gill from playing
She shoots her ex an angry glare and moves a lever on the shop wall
With a , the car descends
We went to San Francisco twice
Remember one time we had a flat tire
Which picture
As the hydraulic lift slows, the car is lowered, revealing Ike sitting in the driver's seat
He has been enjoying the photograph he's holding
(feigning shock) Imagine
Maggie Carpenter topless in a public arena
(checks photo again) And  see there was a chill in the air
Maggie swipes for the photo, but Ike is faster at pulling it away
Give me that
But the most interesting thing here is that  don't see the rose tattoo that 've heard about on your back
Gill takes off his guitar and sets it down
Ike bet me fifty bucks you don't still have it, Mags
said "You're on, man
Maggie loved that thing
"  And  could really use fifty bucks
Maggie is conspicuously silent
(cont'd) (looking worried) Mags
'm not gonna show you guys anything
am a soon-to-be-married woman
Now give me that photograph
Maggie seethes
Sure,  would love to give this to you
Just give us one quick gander at that rose, and, 'll gladly hand it over
She tries to grab the photo again
Ike pulls it away
Fine
Here
Maggie quickly turns around and pulls down the back of her shirt, revealing the top of her back and a pristine expanse of skin
No tattoo
(cont'd) (turning back around) Satisfied
Completely
Gill is still trying to grasp the meaning of this
Maggie
You got it removed
Gill, 'll go ya double or nothing if was a stick-on
(dismayed) Maggie
(admitting) 'm really, really afraid of needles
It doesn't make me a bad person
Ike laughs
Maggie looks at him with rage
Gill dramatically pulls down the front of his t-shirt
Look
There it is on Gill's chest: the rose tattoo
Maggie sighs, pained
Gill shows it to Ike
Ike looks at the tattoo
He shakes his head at Maggie
(sincerely) Look, look, man
think the man is heartbroken
He is not
Maggie moves the lever on the wall again, sending Ike back up to the ceiling in the car
She grabs the photo from Ike and exits
think  am
Gill grabs his guitar and sits
(cont'd) Hey, Ike, what would Jerry do
The hydraulic lift stops moving
Ike leans out
Jerry
He'd play
He'd play
Jerry would play his heart out
Ike sings and taps along in tempo on the side of the car as Gill sings and plays "Ripple"
: -  , As Maggie drives into town with Peggy, they see Ike on porch with ,   and     , all playing instruments as a blues band
Ike is not bad on slide guitar
They all like Ike
Maggie "" with Peggy and moves on
- : The slow, loopy pitch of a softball
bat connects
: big wholesome man, , runs for first base
He just beats out the throw
Bob, acting as umpire, yells, "Safe
"  Happy, Cory turns to the stands and waves
: Maggie and Peggy, cheering loudly
Peggy tries to whoop harder than Maggie, but that would be tough
From firs base, Cory waves back to them
The two women sit back down and Maggie takes back up with their conversation
Maggie is still al steamed up
Okay, he's on base
Can we talk about my life now
-- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that  was never serious about Gill, blah blah
He's totally out to get me
For what reason
Some personal satisfaction
That's what he says, but if he thinks that  don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot
It's probably because you got him fired
(sarcastic) Ya think
Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired
Look
Cory's going for second
Sneaky
: Cory as he runs for second base and with a slide beats the throw for the force out
The women jump and cheer -- Maggie, again, the most boisterous
: Dennis recognizes Ike as he walks up
Dennis tells Ike that he is going to marry Maggie some day and shows Ike where Maggie is sitting
: Maggie spots Ike as they sit back down
She groans
There he is
Snoop Doggy-Dogg
Where
Over there
Ten o'clock
He's talking to our little Dennis
Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things
He looks better with that stuff out of his hair
He's an attractive man
Ike finds Maggie in the crowd and leaves Dennis
'd say you've been in the sun too long
You handle him, okay
could use five minutes off from that creep
Before Peggy can protest, Maggie climbs down off the bleachers and goes and stands near the dugout near the rest of Cory's team
Okay, that's fine
can do that
Ike comes up to Peggy
Hello, Peggy Phleming, "not the ice-skater"
Ike indicates the seat next to Peggy
(protesting weakly) That's Maggie's seat
Ike sits down comfortably
And this is Maggie's beer
He starts drinking it
, Cory is getting ready to steal third
(cont'd) That your  husband out there
Cory Phleming, a local radio announcer
Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"
Not yet
had a phlemless morning hear he's a pretty good ballplayer
This game is pretty important to him
He made all-stars in high school, you know
That must have made you proud
Peggy takes a small sip off her soda
He was going with Maggie back then
(quickly) He was never one of her
mean, they were never going to get
They just dated for a while
Cory dives in for third and makes it
The crowd goes wild
Peggy yells and jumps in
(cont'd) Good job, honey
But Maggie's whoop sails out above it all
Cory waves
But not at Peggy
He directs his delight at Maggie, who jumps up and down by the dugout
Ike looks between Cory, Maggie and finally, Peggy
Peggy jerks her waving hand back down to her side and sits down
Ike pretends not to have noticed
The two watch as Maggie and Cory smile at each other
It's nice that they're still friends
(looking at Maggie and Cory) Oh, sure
That was a long time ago
See, she's not a man-hater at all
She's very supportive of men
Next  hits one to deep left field and it lands in the grave yard
Cory scores, greeted by Maggie
Ike and Peggy watch as Cory and Maggie belly-bump and high-five each other in celebration of Cory's play
No looks at Peggy
Ike keeps an empathetic silence, seeing that Peggy is truly hurt
(cont'd) 'll be back in a second
Suddenly, Peggy stands, pushes past him and runs down the steps
Maggie looks up just in time to catch Peggy's exit
Ike pulls his tape recorder out of his pocket and starts speaking into it
Maggie shoots Ike an accusing look, walks up to him in the bleachers and sits next to him
You've been here for three minutes
What did you do to her
You can turn that finger around
Ike does an on-the-button imitation of Maggie jumping excitedly at Cory
Now Maggie sees what he's getting at
(defensive) You misinterpret everything
We've all been friends our whole lives
But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand
Obviously, 'm not the only one who doesn't understand it
The  Maggie leaves quite a wake
Excuse me
Ike walks away
Alone, Maggie tries to seem enthused
See,  cheer good
What is he, a cheer critic
/
/ -  - Sitting in front of Inn Hale Bar, we see the pantomiming holding the reins of a wildly galloping horse

- Maggie walks up to the front desk of the hotel, where Lee is sleeping with his feet up
She knocks his feet off the counter
Lee, hey, wake up
Give me the key to the reporter's room

Second floor
Thanks
Don't take anything big
Maggie moves up the stairs towards Ike's room
-  - Maggie walks towards Ike's room, checks that no one sees her and enters
'   - Maggie lets herself in the modest room and turns on the lights on
She spots on audio cassette on the desk near the door
She holds the cassette up to the light to read the hand-written label
It says "Miles Davis" on it
She pockets the tape
She walks to the living room
' : Ike has placed post-its on a framed picture, using the frame as a bulletin board
Post-it notes lay out the information he has gathered under headings and subheadings
Parents "Mother" deceased, subheaded by "Walter" and there is one for "Brian", "Gill", and "Bob"
Maggie smiles and shakes her head
She rips one post-it down and reads it to herself
(reads) "How does she get all these guys to propose
She's not that beautiful
" (snorts) Bite me, paper boy
She begins ripping many of other post-it off the picture frame
(cont'd) (as she takes post-its) Rude
She's ripping them down, fast and furious, then shoves them in her shoulder bag
- Ike comes down hallway as Harvey puts his shoes out to be shined
Maggie, looking around, discovers the wedding video on the coffee table and grabs that, too
(cont'd) Thief
makes Maggie jump
She flees to the bathroom, and shuts and locks the door
Just as Ike enters, he sniffs and looks around the room, instantly knowing something is up
He sees all his notes gone and a glimpse of Maggie as she closes the bathroom door
Ike is steaming
sounds from the bathroom
He goes over to the door and tries the handle
It's locked
He starts to pound on the door
All right,  know you're in there
You steal my research
You're messing with the first amendment now
Open up
Open up
You got no place to go

Maggie is already trying to open the first bathroom window
It's stuck
She climbs over the bathtub, opens that window and starts to climb out

We  Ike slamming his body against the bathroom door
As Ike breaks in, he runs to the window and yells after her
'   - (cont'd) That's breaking and entering
'll call the sheriff
You do that
And remind him he's bringing the wine to the luau
Thanks
She disappears around the ledge of the building and runs off
Ike's neighbor, Harvey, sits reading near his window

We see the familiar handwritten label: "Miles Davis
"  "Kind of Blue" plays as Maggie listens in a chair, looking shell-shocked, surrounded by the post-its she stole from Ike's room
We see as she reads them: "Father, two- fisted drinker," "Peggy, best friend, but Peggy doesn't totally trust Maggie," "Bob" -- doesn't love him
Overwhelmed, she finishes reading the last note, leans back, puts her feet up on the table, deep in the mood of the melancholy music

Mrs
Pressman hands Peggy a cup of coffee to go
Peggy walks to the beauty parlor, unlocks the front door and goes in
- Peggy enters and starts about her opening duties
She turns on the lights and turns and sees her friend, Maggie
Do you think  flirt with Cory
Peggy stops in her track
Maggie is sitting curled up in a salon chair
She looks like she hasn't slept
Good morning to you, too
You look good
Thank you
Do you think  flirt with Cory
Yes
Maggie looks miserable
don't mean it
Peggy moves to the salon mirror near Maggie with her cup of coffee
know
think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves
On anything male that moves
As opposed to anything male that doesn't move
Peggy pours her coffee out of its Styrofoam cup into a ceramic mug
Like certain kinds of coral
Peggy sits in the salon chair next to Maggie
'm going to kill myself
Why
Because you think 'm all like
"Hey man, check me out"
(friendly) No,  don't think you're like, "'m charming and mysterious in a way that even  don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you"
Very hard to compete with
Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery
But you haven't lost your mystery
You're very mysterious
No
'm weird
Weird and mysterious are two different things
But 'm weird
No
You're quirky
Quirky and weird are two different things
Peggy, there's distinct possibility that  might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up
Despite that, love you and  can promise that will no longer flirt with Cory, and beg your forgiveness
Maggie looks ready to cry
'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up
But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids
And  think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one
think you're right
(then) Is there anything  can do to make it up to you
Something that brings warmth to my heart
(pause) Duckbill platypus
It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt
It's not anymore
Maggie makes her funny face
Peggy doesn't laugh
You're right
It's not funny now
Maybe we both grew up
Thanks
Will you fix my hair
: '  - Maggie exits her house, gets on her bike and rides off towards town
'   - Ike is still in bed
He slowly blinks awake, stretches, and is about to  throw off the covers when Maggie's voice breaks the silence
Freeze
Hold on to those covers -- didn't come here to see Ike Junior
Maggie smiles cheerfully at Ike from the foot of the bed
He narrows his eyes at her
take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers
(deadpan) How do  do it
'm not that beautiful
Ike notices Maggie is holding two coffees
Coffee
Now
Maggie hands it to him
You're welcome
Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction
Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete
You must be very proud
'm not a boastful man
What's your point
Ike puts a shirt on as Maggie speaks
My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong
That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either
So, 'm going to give you a chance to write the truth
Really
Maggie turns away from him as he dresses
've decided to cooperate and let you interview me
(beat) For a thousand bucks
Ike clears his throat as he stands putting his pants on
(cont'd) want a big wedding and a killer dress and for a grand  will answer all your questions and let you follow me around
Ike takes his coffee with him as he picks up his glasses, puts them on and crosses to the window
My magazine doesn't pay because for stories
It's not what you call ethical
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical
Actually,  meant you
You probably got severance or expenses or both
'll take your check
No credit cards
(to Maggie) You've seen the post-its
've already got more juicy material than  need
Why should  pay you dollar one
Because  think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing
Ike knows she's right
Too much
Seven-fifty
Five hundred
Six-fifty
Done
Scowling, he writes out the check and hands it to her
Maggie looks at it and smile sweetly
: '  - Ike jogs alongside of Maggie on her bike
Maggie parks her bike and they go inside her door to the house
'    - Maggie leads Ike upstairs to her workroom
Pardon the mess
haven't cleaned since the fifth grade
'  - Insert on a cappuccino machine
We   and see Maggie and Ike standing at her work table
An automatic cappuccino maker stands on the table
Its base is made from a used paint mixing machine
It looks very shiny and futuristic
Maggie's logo "" is on the side
The machine shakes as it steams the cappuccino
Ike notices another homemade machine on the table
(cont'd) What's this over here
It's a birthday present for my cousin
Put your finger in
Cindy the manicurist
He puts his finger in the wrong hole of the machine
No, the other one
He puts his finger in the correct hole
She turns it on
The brushes rotate
(laughing) This is wonderful
You reconfigure all these industrial parts and you do something amazing with it
He looks around and spots some gadgets and lamps on another table
He walks to them
(cont'd) Amazing
Found industrial stuff
Willow lamp
Rasta lamp
He picks up one of the many logos on the counter
Each boasts a "" logo
(cont'd) Is this your preferred logo
think so
like it
This whole thing is pretty incredible
(studying a lamp) think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York
Maybe someday
You afraid to try
(stares at him) No, 'm not afraid
Just
Maybe someday
Well, 'm impressed
Absolutely incredible
(sitting) didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room
What an incredible chauvinistic observation
'   - Maggie's showing Ike engagement rings
That's Brian's
He took me ut canoeing on the lake and gave me the ring in a velvet box
Ike snores
Maggie hits him
(cont'd) (defensive) It was classic
Maggie hands Ike another ring
This one is in the shape of a Grateful Dead rose
(cont'd) Gill
Of course
He proposed at the tie-dye t-shirt stand at a Dead concert
It was very sweet until he hallucinated that the drum set was a blood-sucking space alien
Always a mood killer
Still sweet
Maggie hands Ike a third ring
It's in the shape of a butterfly and studded with multi-color gems
(cont'd) George
He proposed at a butterfly farm in St
Thomas
The ring was inside a cocoon
(grimacing) It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me
can't believe you waited for the wedding to run
He's an entomologist
thought it was very unique
Now Maggie shows Ike the ring on her hand
It's a gold "#1" with a diamond set into the number
(cont'd) And here we are at Bob
He proposed during the seventh inning stretch
Ike touches her hand to examine the ring more closely
Her surprise at his touch shows on her face as she finishes her sentence
(cont'd) At an Oriole's game
She takes her hand down
Ike steps away
Wait
Don't tell me
The scoreboard lit up with "Mary me, Maggie
" Ike picks up his cup of cappuccino and moves behind the couch
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life
Cal Ripken even applauded
(stopping) Highly suspect
What do you mean
It was incredibly romantic
Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true
Ike moves back to the couch
(cont'd) think the most anybody can honestly say is, "Look
" (sits on the arm of the couch) " guarantee that we'll have tough times
guarantee that at some point one or both of us will want to get out of this thing
But  also guarantee that if  don't ask you to be  mine, 'll regret it for the rest of my life
Because  know in my heart -- you're the only one for me" Maggie stares at Ike for a beat
His words have taken a little bit of her breath away
She covers
like it
She moves from the fireplace to a chair and sits
(cont'd) 'd like it better on a scoreboard
(lightly) Is that how you proposed when you asked your wife to marry you
Ike is taken aback
(cont'd) Don't look so surprised, you've got divorce written all over you
'm a work in progress
So
Is that what you said to her
No
think  said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know
What do you think
" Now that's romantic
proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss
What went wrong
Ike takes a swallow of cappuccino
don't know
You don't know
No
Maybe you should ask her some time
Ever thought of that
Ike is restless
He stands up
Call me crazy, but  believe that check gave you entitles me to ask the questions for a while
Ike puts down his cup of coffee, gets his tape recorder and sits close to Maggie
Fair enough
(thinks a beat) Actually
Maggie move to
She picks up Ike's stolen post-it notes and her wedding video on top of the , and goes to the front door
(cont'd) 'll just need one more day to make sure your check clears
Ow
: - Ike and Maggie drive in Maggie's truck
They pull up in front of a Bridal Shop
spectacular dress fills the small window
It's beautiful, romantic, sexy
Maggie and Ike can be seen in the reflection
Even with everything that's happened 've still never been married and still deserve a beautiful dress
Agreed
Maggie gives Ike a smile that lights up the sky
They go inside
- The place is fairly large and prosperous, probably the place to go in the Tri-County area
little  , 10, is being fitted on the pedestal in the middle of the room
saleswoman, , has taken the flower girl under her wing
They are both under the expert eyes of a stern looking woman,
, the shop owner
Also, the girl's  is there watching
(to the mother) She'll be the prettiest little flower girl in your daughter's wedding
Mr
Whittenmeyer
Hi, Polly
The flower girl sees Maggie and runs and hides behind Polly
Hi, Maggie
You'll have to excuse her, Maggie
Some of the children are afraid of you since you dragged that little boy up the aisle
didn't drag
(then to the girl) He tripped on his shoelaces
Mrs
Whittenmeyer comes forward to greet Maggie
You've come for your dress
Good
'll get it from the back
Maggie leads her to the front window
(happily) Actually,  would like to get this dress
She points to the dress
She smiles back to Mrs
Whittenmeyer, expecting her to share her joy
Mrs
Whittenmeyer darkens
(to Polly) Polly, take Leslie into change
(then, to Maggie) But the one you have on hold is lovely
(pleasantly) Yes
But 've changed my mind
It's one thousand dollars
Maggie is keenly aware of Ike listening in
have one thousand dollars
(firmly) The other one is only three hundred dollars
Maggie lowers her voice, hoping to lessen the humiliation of the moment
Is this dress for sale
It just seems like an awful lot of money to spend on one of your dresses, Maggie
You only wear them for about ten minutes
Ike watches with regret as Maggie's child-like enthusiasm drains away, her happy mood crushed by the tactless assault of the shop owner
He's starting to see that it's no always easy being Maggie
There's a tremor in her voice
Yeah, that's a good point
(then, sitting) The other dress is nice
Ike calls out to Mrs
Whittenmeyer
Mrs
Whittenmeyer
May  talk to you for a second
She walks over to him
(cont'd) don't know much about this kind of thing
'm from out of town
You're a salesperson, right
You're here to sell wedding dresses
(huffy) Yes
've been here for thirty years
Perfect
Because Miss Carpenter is here to buy one
But not just any one
She wants that one
It's a thousand dollars
Ike goes over and takes the mannequin out of the window
Mrs
Whittenmeyer catches the wig as he puts the mannequin under his arm
(cont'd) Look, Aunt Bea, we're buying this beautiful dress and anything else she wants or 'm coming back here with a squirt gun filled with India ink
Mrs
Whittenmeyer wilts under Ike's fierce gaze
She turns to Maggie
Will he really do that
Maggie gives her a look
(cont'd) (to Maggie) Well, why don't you pick out some accessories while  get this ready, dear
Polly, will you come help me, please
Polly comes to help carry the mannequin away
: (whispering to Mrs
Whittenmeyer) It's a thousand dollars
Shhhh
The man has ink
Maggie looks gratefully at Ike
Tough to spend money in this town
:    : Ike sits as he hears Maggie's voice behind him
(o
s
) What do you think
Ike turns around
Maggie is standing on the pedestal, wearing the dress and looking unbelievably gorgeous
She is overwhelming to behold and Ike has to struggle to keep his face under control
(stammering) You look
uh
You look fine
Fine
The newspaper's upside down
That's better than fine
Bob will be very happy
She glows
Then the moment between them is broken as she suddenly remembers something and grabs the veil off her head
Bob
almost forgot
have to meet Bob
- This is a great place -- a major hub of social life in Hale
The food is greasy and good, Mrs
Pressman is the waitress, and the the essence of what is wonderful about a small town
Bob, Maggie and Ike sit on the counter
Mrs
Pressman  about the luau, then moves around the corner
Mrs
Pressman,  think we're ready to order
We're out the special because somebody
(indicates  with head) didn't order enough sausage
Let me have the garden omelette
Egg whites only
Ike looks at Maggie
He'd bet a thousand bucks on what she'd say next
'll have the same
(clears his throat) Of course
What was that
can't order  my eggs without sarcasm
Neutral corners you two
You're on the same team now
Any more fighting and it's fifteen minutes in the penalty box
(gently, to Ike) Maggie's the nicest person you'll ever meet
But she's always focusing out there
She's got to start focusing more in here
(taps his chest) That's why she's had some -- whatever you want to call it -- problems in the past
(to Maggie) That's what we're working on -- focus
Right, Maggie
Focus on Maggie
Focus on Bob
As Bob has been talking, Ike has been watching Maggie's face
The joy seems to have drained out of her
(quietly) Right
(to Ike) lead Maggie through a visualization exercise
All the sports shrinks use this head stuff
Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift
Bob takes out a notepad and hands it to Maggie
(cont'd) Here's today's mantra: "It's an open field to Big Bob
" Tell me
When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet
You know, there's no
Before Maggie can finish, Ike intercepts her
Well, 'm off
reporter's work is never done
(heading to the door) Mrs
Pressman, thank you
Tootaloo
- (
) 'd like to explain about the weddings
There are reasons why they didn't come off
Three weddings, no " do's"
You can't believe how much cake we were left with
should weigh three hundred pounds
don't think her father minded spending so much money on booze that nobody drank
We hear Grandma as through the hotel doors, we see Maggie exit the diner
She gets a bag from inside the cab of her truck and comes inside the hotel where she finds Ike talking to Grandma, who is having tea with her friend,
Ike
Hi, Grandma
Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss
Right, cover your ears, Netta
It's not that she's afraid of the wedding, she's afraid of the wedding night
Innocent girls are terrified of "the one-eyed snake"
(getting into it) Why, when  was a virgin bride,  took a knitting needle with me into the bed
Ike winces
Actually, Grandma,  charmed the one- eyed snake awhile ago
Oh, yeah,  forgot
'll tell you one thing, your grandpa didn't forget that wedding night
(no Netta) You can take your hands off your ears, Netta
Your tea's getting cold
Can you excuse us a minute
(then to Ike) May  have a word with you, please
Maggie moves toward door
Bye, Netta
Bye, Grandam
He steps over to Maggie in the doorway
found this and didn't know if it was something interesting
Maggie hands Ike a 30-year-old : Miles Davis' "Kind of Blue
" (excited) Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis
This is "King of Blue"
This is the original recording
Hard to find in good condition
Where did you find this
(casual) It was in the attic
It was jus sitting there gathering dust
It's valuable
Hang onto it
No
You take it
She steps outside, leaving Ike with the record
Hmmm
Figuring out what kind of music like and then finding me a rare album
You're not trying to soften me up, are you
No -- 'm cleaning an attic wouldn't attempt the impossible
She turns and walks back to the diner where Mrs
Pressman is outside watering plants
Ike looks after Maggie and then back down at the record in his hand
Somehow it makes him sad
: '  - Ike drives through Hale gobbling french fries from the fast food bag in his lap
Ike passes    , same dump of a tavern he talked to bartender at
: '  parked a few cars down
He pulls over and parks
He gets out and speaks into his tape recorder
/
-- Ike approaches the window of the bar
There's a   and a sitting outside
Inside, we see two figures from the back, arms around each other
One is definitely Maggie
The other is definitely not Bob
(coaxing) 'mon
Let's go
As Maggie helps the man get up,  we see that it's Walter, Maggie's father -- dead drunk
(belligerently) haven't had any fun since you got your driver's license
They stumble and lurch, exiting the bar toward Maggie's car
'm not exactly having fun, either
Steady
(to Dog) Good boy, Port Hole
His name is Skipper, Dad
Steady
changed it
(then to Drunk) See you later, Mr
Travis
(then to Maggie) That guy has a problem
Maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own
Maggie's having trouble keeping him steady as she opens the car door
Ike is there in a flash to help her pull Walter into the car
(cont'd) Good daughters let their fathers pass out
Walter passes out on the front seat
(without difficulty) Ike
Please don't write anything about this -- No
Forget about it
Don't even think about it
Maggie looks at him with real gratitude
She swings the car door shut
Watch your leg, Dad
(then to Ike) 'm so tired of this
Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk
'll take you for a ride
Then we'll come back for him
(to Drunk on bench) Keep an eye on him
'm too loaded
was talking to the dog
(turning to Maggie) All right
Maggie thinks about this for a moment
She takes a deep breath
Okay
'll just grab my jacket
: - Establishing of Ike's car driving
'  - Maggie and Ike ride along
My dad managed a business and two mistresses
He wanted me to be a novelist
More
Maggie nods, (cont'd) My mother wanted me to become a musician
0 for two
But at least 'm a journalist and we all know journalism is literature in a hurry
'  -   - Ike and Maggie stare forward
Both seem in melancholy moods
They're beginning to sense they're in trouble here
Suddenly, the car falters and jerks
It shows to a stop on the shoulder of the road
The car backfires and smokes
'  -   - Ike and Maggie sit in the steaming car for a moment
Your filter's clogged
This takes unleaded
Can you fix it
First  have to find some tools need a half and a nine-six-tenth
(removing his glasses) Of what
(in amazement) Wrenches
My dad's gonna love that one
Maggie slams the food closed
Kind of isolated
Yeah
It's kind of nice
An uncomfortable silent pause
Ike breaks the moment
There's one thing we New Yorkers know how to do is hail a cab
If there's no cab, we walk
Ike stares off down the road
Maggie indicates a building in the distance, then turns off the car lights
can get some tools over there
and save the battery
There's one thing we country girls know how to do is cut across a field
It's quicker
Maggie points diagonally across the field to where a gas station sign glows and the lights from the outer house twinkle
He smiles and follows her into the field
(cont'd) Be careful of snakes
Snakes
Are you serious
don't like snakes
've never even seen a snake
He steps carefully into the field, then hops gingerly toward Maggie
Maggie leads Ike through a cornfield
Do you think there's only one right person for everybody
Ike chooses his words carefully
No
But  think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness
Attraction is very misleading
And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting
Yes it is
And it doesn't mean anything
Ike nods as they come to a wooden fence
She puts her hand on his shoulder
Ike puts his hands around her waits to give her a boost over the top
We see the flicker of misunderstanding cross Maggie's face at the initial contact
Neither of them moves -- forward or back, but the electricity is obvious
:  Ike
His conflicted feelings are apparent
With difficulty, Maggie straightens up and they both quickly remove their hands
(cont'd) (lightly) suddenly forgot how to climb a fence
They look at each other for a moment, then: (breaking the moment jokingly) "Tools"
She climbs over the fence on her own and Ike follows
They see an old guy, , whittling on a porch
(cont'd) Lionel, can  borrow some tools
Yeah, we need a half and nine- sixteenths
Gonna bust out of another wedding
You're sure well known around here
'  - Establishing shot
'  () - '   - : Ike sits on his bed, on the phone, working and eating his breakfast
He's watching Maggie's wedding tape again
Fisher is cooking an elaborate breakfast
Ellie rushes around getting ready for work
He is on the phone to Ike
(into phone) Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention
Negative attention is attention
Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention
(
) This is about her negative attention, not mine
Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet
(into phone) No, 'm paying for the dress
Do you think she's still gonna run
(
) don't know
Ellie enters the kitchen, hears the question and shakes her head to herself
If only these boys would give it up
'   - He is finding it very hard to gloat
Fisher is annoying him
(into phone) Look -- 'll be in there later today
'll come by and tell you all about it
(
) You're coming here
(into phone) Yeah
(
) Then come for dinner
(into phone) Okay, we'll order out
(
) Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here
Ike hangs up and watches more of the George Swilling wedding video
- The bar from the opening scene
, the same man Ike talked to before, is sitting on a stool, nursing his drink
He looks better
Ike enters
George looks up and recognizes Ike, who takes the bar stool next to him
Get this man a Kamikaze
Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job
Ike sits and leans over to George
(whispers) You could have told me you were fiance number three
And end up in the papers
've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you
'm sorry she got you canned
Thanks
She's a cacophony of contradictions
Well, 'm writing another article on the cacophony
Ah, can't stay away from her, can you
Like a moth to a flame
Guess you'd know about that
You're an entomologist, right
How's business
(taking a sip of his drink) Not bad
was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me
(sarcastic) Neuter a locust, feed the world
Not the world
Just Africa and China
Ike wipes the smirk off his face
Like Maggie's other men, this guy has a worthy accomplishment under his belt
(cont'd) You know Maggie was the only girl ever met who would hold my tarantula
On the first date
(cont'd) So, tell me, George, why do you think she ran
Same as you said
What did you call her
"man-eater", "a devouring death goddess
" don't think that's why she ran
Why do  think she ran
Ike sips his drink before answering
don't know
'm working on it was on the wrong track
And you defending her
No
call it like  see it
'm a journalist
'm a truth teller
Unbelievable, she got to you
Oh, please
Join the club
(passing him his drink) Here, you need this more than me
George heads out
(protecting, taking his tape recorder out of his pocket) 'm writing an article, 'm getting paid to do this, it's going to be a cover story, it's going to be published The facts will be read someday
As George pauses in the doorway, Ike holds up his tape recorder
(cont'd) What kind of eggs did she like
Poached, just like me
George exits
: /  '  - Ike walks down a street toward Ellie and Fisher
: '  () - Ellie is on the phone as Fisher enters with beer
Ike sits at the piano
(sarcastically) Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese takeout
That's New York living
(into phone) Just call me when you have it
(hangs up, then to Fisher) Ike, how is the story coming
Is she a man-eater
Or a vegetarian
Or does she pick "'" -- "Nice Guys, But
"  Nice guys, but 'm cheap
Nice guys, but he lives with his mom
Nice guys, but he just out of prison
No
They're interesting guys
Each one of these guys has something going for him
mean, one's been up Everest
Another's become a priest
One's a pretty good guitar player
And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that
Whoa, Ike
Getting a complex, buddy
Fisher, let him talk
(sits) But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all
Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her
And she never showed up so they couldn't see her
It's a very symbolic thing happening
She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be
Fisher doesn't like the sound of this
He glances at Ellie, who is looking very interested
(in shock) Ike is turning sensitive and  can't bear to watch
'm going to make a fresh pot of tea
The phone rings as Fisher exits
Ike goes to the piano as Ellie picks up the phone
(into phone) Yeah
Oh, Jay
Okay
Bye
(hangs up, then yells to Fisher) Fisher, don't forget the fortune cookies
She joins Ike at the piano
Ike gets serious
Is that what  did to you
Is that what happened
Did  just not see you
No
No, you didn't
He hugs her
(heartfelt) Well -- 'm sorry, 'm really sorry, Ellie
'm sorry, too
(beat) Wow
That only took us between years to say
Ellie blinks back sentimental tears
: '  - We hear Hawaiian music
We see a truck with  drive up and through barn slats
'  - It's a small barn that's been converted into a luau with a bar
plays for two hula dancers
The Trouts had decorated it as a little slice of Hawaii
There are tiki lights, numerous rented plastic palm trees and fiberglass copies of Hawaiian statuary
Strings of colored lights crisscross the ceiling
It looks like a Hawaiian high school gym on prom night
Maggie's family, Mrs
Trout and people we've already met, and more, are here, milling around wit tropical drinks garnished with umbrellas
Plastic leis abound and most people have managed to find their old Hawaiian shirts
As we come in, the hula dancers finish their applause and Mrs
Trout announces
Hula dancers stop
Welcome to our annual country luau
As you know, Betty and  got married on the rim of the crater, Diamond Head
(grabbing the microphone) This year, we're dedicating our first dance to the soon-to-be newlyweds, the King and Queen of Hawaii, Maggie and Bob
The couple enters
Bob is a goody bronzed god in his King Kamahamela outfit
Maggie is spectacular in her authentic looking Hawaiian Princess get-up
But her face reflects none of the festivities around her
Every now and then, she looks up and glances around for Ike, hating herself for it
(cont'd) King and Queen, dance
Maggie and Bob start to dance as the Quarter sings "Aloha Oe
" (cont'd) Everybody dance
Everybody dances
: Maggie and Bob pose for pictures with some of the guests
Pictures of the King and Queen
Dennis poses with Maggie
Cory poses with Bob
Mrs
Trout runs out of film and goes to get more, leaving Peggy and Maggie alone
Peggy whispers to Maggie
Lighten up, wahine
Lighten up, what
This party is for you and Bob
Get your mind off the reporter
haven't seen him in twenty-four hours
It just gives me the creeps a little bit
'd feel better if  knew where he was
(nods to door) Would it
:  Ike just entering the party
At least he tried
He's got a tropical sheet wrapped around his pants and shirt
He walks to the bar and is greeted warmly by Lee
Maggie gets very flustered
(cont'd) What are you doing
(after a beat) 'm going to go dance with Bob
Because he's the man
(referring to her headdress) like those grapes
Maggie dances affectionately with Bob as Mr
Trout, tending bar, greets Ike
Hey, Mr
Graham, welcome to our luau
What can  get you
You got something without a toy in it
: - pair of expressive pantomime " Little Grass Shack"
: Mrs
Trout is on stage, introducing hula contestants
Grandma judges the Hawaiian dancing
The party is at full tilt -- a little wild, a little goofy
Some guests (Bob, Cindy, Cory, Lee and Ted) do the limbo
Walter, Mrs
Pressman doesn't turn as she hears him
Aloha
That's a very fetching headdress you're wearing
Ike leans into Maggie, enjoying the smell of her hair
She notices, but acts casual
Where did you disappear to
Missed me bad, huh
: All the guests start banding their pineapple cups
Walter rises unsteadily, lifting his pineapple
Attention
Listen to Walter
Listen close, he slurs
(then) Shut up, wahines
In the tradition that has grown through the years, it is now Toast Time
First up, our host, " Honey of a Beekeeper", Lou Trout
Lou Trout stands with his glass raised
May the groom's heart be filled with hopes and the bride's feet be filled with lead
There are shouts of "Hear hear
"  Walter roars
May the pitter-patter of little feet not be Maggie's
May the gifts be returned
May the back of the dress be as pretty as the front
The laughter swells and swells, led by Walter
: Ike watches as Maggie takes the heat, raising her glass along with the others
Bob raises his glass like the good sport he is
Ike can't believe it
You know the old saying, "You're not losing a daughter
"  Well, 'd like to
Walter gets a bit laugh
He goes again
(cont'd) Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke
(under her breath) Maggie finishes the punchline along with his father
-- But she's certainly the fastest
Uproarious laughter
Maggie looks terribly pained
Ike's had enough
He pushes himself to his feet
Walter is thrilled
He shushes the
(cont'd) Oh, look, Mr
Graham, how about a toast
don't know, give me a minute
(to Maggie) Are you all right with this
Excuse me
Are you all right with this
You think this is funny
Yes
don't and  don't think you should
It's a joke
They're kidding
(yell) Come on and give us a toast
You want me to make a toast
Okay
'll give you a toast
To Maggie's family and friends
May you find yourselves the bull's eye of an easy target
May you be publicly flogged for all of your bad choices and may your noses to rubbed in all of your mistakes
Ike watches their reaction
The silence is deafening
All the guests stare at Maggie
Mortified, she holds back tears
That was funny
(a pause) But enough toasts, let's hula
Let's start the music up
She gets everyone up to hula
Band plays fast tune
Maggie walks through the  down the steps and outside
Ike follows, but Peggy grabs a coat for her
Bob watches her go as Cory approaches
Hey, Bob
got twenty dollars bet on-- Not now
Bob rushes after Maggie
(calling after her) Maggie
Maggie
(to Ike,  handing him a jacket) Here
She may need this
It's not really Hawaii
Ike exits
Then, Bob comes over
Where'd Maggie go
Oh, she just went to get me something from the car
Cory comes over with Dennis to Bob and Peggy
/// :  About Bart Starr and football
(Which keeps Bob from going outside to follow Maggie)
Bob thinks about it
'  - Ike runs after Maggie
He grabs her arm and turns her to him
'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you
You humiliated me
No, Maggie,  defended you
Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing
It's the theme of this party
had it under control
Now they feel sorry for me
Well, they should
Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again
Maggie has no response
(cont'd) -- Tell me something, do you really care about Mount Everest
It's fun
It's high
Or the sexual habits of locusts
That was very interesting research George was doing
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo
already explained about that
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai
(wincing) Brian told you that
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress
Every one of those times  was being supportive
Something you won't understand
Supportive
You weren't being supportive
You were being scared
Just like now
You are the most lost woman  have ever laid eyes on
Lost
That's right
You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs
What
With the priest, you liked them scrambled
With the Dead Head, fried
With the bug guy, poached
Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much
That's called changing your mind
No, that's called not having a mind of your own
What are you doing, Maggie
You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon
You don't want to climb Annapuma
Yes  do
No you don't
You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet
You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem
You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say
Am  right
He's laid her flat
Maggie can't speak
(cont'd) Am  right
She fights back angry tears
Stop
Stop it
'm getting married on Sunday, and you're just trying to make me run
Why
Because you're a cynical, exploitative, mean-hearted creep who wouldn't know real love if it bit him in the armpit
And all you do is tear other people down and-and-and laugh at them, and criticize what they do, because you're too afraid to do anything yourself
read your column
You never wrote one about you
'm not the only one who's lost and you know it
Am  right
Well
Am  right
:  Bob comes outside
Mag
Help me out here
Green Bay
Right guard
Both Maggie and Ike are breathing hard
Bob comes up to Maggie and gives Ike a very hard look as he puts his arm around his fiancee
(cont'd) You know
Blocked Bart Starr, crewcut Are you okay
Maggie adjusts her face as best she can
Yes
Let me take you back inside, okay
She lets him lead her away
Jerry Kramer
Ike looks at her drooped shoulder and he shakes his head and walks to his car
- Peggy and Cindy arrive for the rehearsal
They leave Cindy's dog in Peggy's car and walk to the church
Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding
She's already done this
Bob is making her visualize the ceremony
: - They are in the church proper now
Peggy waits in a pew as Bob leads Maggie and Ike up the back steps of the church
(to Maggie) Okay, we're ready
Want me to have Ike leave now
Maggie turns on Ike with "cheerful" hostility
No
No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor
'd rather not
(sarcastically) Come on, it'll give you a great view
It's perfect
(seeing Peggy) Hey
Maggie smiles at Bob
Ike sighs and goes with it
Bob pulls Ike to the head of the aisle and places him
Peggy follows Maggie into the foyer to get ready
Cindy sits with Ted at the organ
Team effort, Pastor Ike
Cindy, ready
(after no response) Cindy, come on
Cindy leaves to join the girls in the foyer
- Once in the privacy of the foyer, Peggy and Maggie talk
He's going to be the pastor
Yep
want him to be front and center and to watch everything
What happened at the luau
(flustered) don't even want to talk about the luau
(then seeing a hanging rope) What's this
It's for the bell
Cindy joins them
Bob's in a hurry
Don't be nervous, Maggie
Let us visualize
Remember what Bob said
"Be the ball
" "Sink the putt
" "Make the shot
" "Nothing but net
" "Never say die
" Maggie puts her hands up
Go
Peggy and Cindy exit
Maggie pulls the bell rope and sways back and forth as she rings the bell
- It is Maggie's turn to enter
They all turn expectantly
Too much time passes
Ted plays the organ, then stops
Maggie swings back and forth in the foyer doorway
Honey, are you okay
Maggie stops ringing the bell and pulls herself together
She walks into the aisle looking a little shaky
She takes a few tremulous steps slowly with her eyes closed, peeking occasionally with one eye
(taking off his jacket) At this pace, it could be an evening wedding
Hold it
Hold it
think we're taking this too fast
He begins to pace
(cont'd) We need to limber you up a little
You're tensing
(thinks a moment; to Ike, moving him to groom's spot) You stand here and be me so she knows how far she'll have to go
(then to Maggie) 'm going to walk with you
Bob goes to Maggie and walks behind her
(cont'd) Visualize
Visualize
It's game time
: Maggie walking
(cont'd) You are the football
You're spiraling through the air towards the hands of the groom
She proceeds down the aisle
Bob behind her
(eyes down) Yes, 'm spiraling through the air
: Maggie raises her eyes and sees Ike in front of her as groom
Ike and Maggie lock gazes
If they had to, they couldn't look away
All the things unspoken are now communicated -- the love, the longing
(cont'd) streak towards the goal line
Maggie's pace quickens
(cont'd) And  land on the goal line
: Bob beams to see Maggie's eager arrival at Ike's side
He switches off the music and proceeds like a proud coach to be the pastor
Okay, 'm the pastor
Dearly beloved, blah, blah, blah
So on and so forth
Ra ta ta ta
Yabada dabada
now pronounce you man and wife
Kiss the bride, badum dum
(then moving toward Ted) We have the crescendo that leads to us right back down the aisle and out the
Ike kisses Maggie
It is a world class, Olympic kiss
It is a kiss that changes everything and can never be taken back
It is a kiss you only get once in your life
: Bob's smile dies
Cindy's mouth drops open as the kiss goes on and on
Peggy loses control and screams
(cont'd) Maggie
Like a bucket of water thrown on two dogs, Ike and Maggie are startled out of their kiss
They pull apart and smile at each other
:  Bob
(cont'd) (furious) If you were imagining me, you did great
(to Ike) What the hell were you doing
(eyes on Maggie) 'm sorry, Bob
She kissed me back
(dazed but happy) kissed him back
Yeah,  caught that
Want to tell me how long this has been going on
Maggie looks at Ike, wondrous, confused
About a minute
little longer for me
Really
What do you expect me to say to this
How about -- " hope you'll be very happy together"
Bob hauls back and punches Ike in the face
Ike drops
hope you'll be very happy together
Bob storms down the aisle and out of the church
(to Peggy) Take care of him
Maggie leaves
: - Bob is halfway down the walk
Maggie appears at the church door and calls after him
Bob, 'm sorry
(half to herself) At least  backed out before the wedding
That's progress
He keeps marching
Now Peggy appears next to Maggie
Maggie calls again
(cont'd) Some woman is going to make you a lot happier than  ever could
The words are barely out of her mouth when Cindy comes out the door, racing after Bob at a full sprint
(cont'd) See
Well, Maggie -- in the words of Mrs
Pressman: "Holy moly"
Call me later
Peggy goes to her car
Cindy joins her as Bob speeds off in his car
Now Ike takes Peggy's place next to Maggie
Maggie turns to face Ike
They are both beet red, stammering and unable to look at each other, trying to act normal
Okay
So
what, uh
What just happened
Just now
Jus then
In there
don't know
, uh --  frankly don't even want to talk about it
Me, either
Ike  Maggie and  -- they are all over each other, kissing frantically, tongues, hands, hair, elbow, you name it
Blathering fools
(blathering) love you
love you
(blathering) love you, too
They come up for air
Wait
We have to talk
We have to do some talking now
Pull up a railing
Maggie sits on the railing, then Ike backs up and sits on the opposite railing
(cont'd) You have to go down an aisle and say " do"
You have to get married
To who
Are you asking me
Me
Ike backs up to opposite railing and sits facing Maggie
Yes, you
(thinks) Well, you do have the dress
And the church
And the wedding date
There's the two of us
(beat) So, you think
maybe
You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back
'm okay with that
So am
So, we'll
They both nod and sit there smiling, sort of
The organist, Ted, closes the church door
Good night
Ike pulls his tape recorder out of his pocket and quietly speaks into it
'm getting married
: They smile at each other and remain sitting
Then, silence
: //  - Ike drives up and parks in front of the hotel as he talks on his cell phone
: '  () - Ellie's on the phone

They make it to the head of the aisle all too quickly
Peggy gives Ike a wink and an encouraging smile
- The door opens and Dennis sticks his head in
They're ready, Maggie
Just a second
Dennis closes the door behind him as he goes back into the chapel
Maggie has a moment alone
She looks at back door as possible escape route, then changes her mind
She signals the start of the wedding by knocking on the door
- Immediately, Cory and Dennis open the doors for her entrance
All the guests stand as Maggie enter the chapel smiling
' : The aisle stretches before her into infinity
Faces goggle at her from every direction
The tiny figure of Ike stands like a beacon a long way off

He smiles at her
She smiles at him
She is almost there
She's there, smiling at Ike
The Pastor gestures to the guests to sit down
They do
: Ike sneezes
She looks down and imagines she sees the carpet splitting apart
And she bolts like a bat out of hell
In a flurry of white, she is halfway down the aisle before Ike knows what hits him
: Ike stands there dazed
For a second
Then she springs into action, charging after her
(yelling out) Block the doors
Like a general, he points to Dennis and Cory in the back and sends them into action
The doors shut in Maggie's face
But she's a wild animal cornered
She moves to the side
The stand so Ike can hurry through the pew
Ike climbs on the pews towards her as  crowd the aisle, blocking his path
Like a gazelle, she leaps to the side aisle and scampers down and away
Fisher gets on his cell phone
Ike charges from one of the full pews, crosses the aisle and leaps across the pews near the staircase to cut her off
He grabs her veil and it comes off in his hands
Maggie disappears down the steps of the church basement

The truck races off

He is enveloped by a barrage of bright lights
Ellie and Fisher, who have also stepped outside on chapel front steps, are looking around as Ike turns around the corner and past the church
Look, he's running after her
Look, he's in pretty good shape
Poor Ike
They look after the FedEx truck and watch Ike chasing the truck down the road away from the church
(running; yells) Maggie
Where do you think she's going
Wherever it is, she'll be there by ten- thirty tomorrow
Cindy, Cory, Peggy and Meredith also rush out of the church and comment on Maggie's runaway
Further down the road, Ike still chases the truck, yelling: Maggie
As the truck rounds the bend in the road and disappears, Ike stops and stares alone after the disappearing truck
swarm of catch up to him, flashing pictures and asking questions

Then a startles her
(whispers) Marry me, Maggie
Maggie jumps and turns to see:   -- the kid from the high school football team, popping up from a low position near the counter
(softly) Hi, Dennis
am going to propose, you know mean, the right way
Soon as  turn eighteen
You're sweet, Dennis
But you've got to go

: '  - Dad and Grandma Julia are there
Grandma is making lunch
Walter is juggling oranges
There's glass of beer on the kitchen counter
That's Maggie
Home for lunch
She's been doing this since the last wedding
don't think it's good
Maggie walks in and kisses Grandma on the cheek
Hey
Grandma, what's for lunch
Turkey and cheese
Honey, your grandmother and  were thinking about opening a wedding gift museum
Walter laughs
Walter looks at his daughter in surprise
He's never heard a tone like this in her voice before
What
(quiet fury) Just stop it
Don't say another word like that
(putting down the oranges) Maggie, it's just a joke
No
It's my life
harmless joke
No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since  was a kid
don't like it
Stop
You may not like having a daughter with problems
But guess what
don't like having a father who's drunk all the time
'll eat in my room
Maggie takes a plate and exits
That needed to be said
You know -- you're always making jokes about her, so they won't make jokes about your drinking
Walter reacts

He bounces a basketball
It doesn't bounce
He sits on the steps of the patio an stares

- Ike crosses a busy street where a  is being arrested
Ike is passing the upscale "Millennium Hardware Store"
He glances at the window, looks away, stops and looks again
The window display is made up of an assortment of Maggie's lamps
Logo "" is on them
He smiles and walks on

Hello, Ike
He closes the closet and crosses to his desk
Don't tell me
My doorman is one of your many admires
knew  should have given him a better Christmas gift
Maggie smiles tenuously
She's more than a little terrified
've been making friends with your cat
(then) Is it okay that 'm here
don't have much choice in the matter now, do
But  can't speak for Italics

The cat leaves Maggie's side and starts to east
Livid is good
So what is it, Maggie
You here on business
saw your lamps
They're terrific
It's something 've always wanted to do
Ike leaves the kitchen, turns on the balcony lights and re-enters the living room from the balcony
You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career
(after opening the glass doors) So, what are you doing here
wanted to talk to you about why  run or ride away from things
Ike moves away from her and sits on the steps near the balcony window, listening
(after sitting) Does it matter
think so
When  was walking down the aisle
was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who really was
And it was only half the other person's fault, because  had done everything to convince him that was exactly what he wanted
So it was good that  didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me
Yes,  did
didn't
And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that
Ike takes this in
She's reaching him -- but then the defenses go back up
He turns to her
No,  couldn't fix anything
(as he gets up) But  still ended up chasing a truck
Ike moves out to the balcony
After a moment, Maggie follows him
/' - The balcony overlooks Central Park
The twinkling lights of the city stretch out across the beautiful night
Ike looks out at the view with his back to Maggie as she speaks
understand why you bring up the truck
Let me explain something
The fact is, you've seen me at my worst, most embarrassing, deviously plotting, potentially but not certifiably, psychotic state
And if you liked me then,  mean, now
can't imagine
(crosses to him) Benedict
Ike has no response
(cont'd) love eggs Benedict
hate all the other kinds
She hesitates
(cont'd) hate big weddings with everybody staring
would like to get married on a weekday while everybody is at work
If  ride off into the sunset,  want my own horse
Should  be writing this down
She returns to the balcony and hands him the box
(cont'd) What's this
These are for you
He opens it
It's her running shoes
Used
They're mine
'm turning in my running shoes to you
This is getting serious
Now she is glowing at him, shining with the full force of her
And one more thing
know it's hard to believe there could be more
Um
Maggie glances around and spots a  , which she turns so it is facing the city lights
Then she softly says: (cont'd) If you could have a seat, please
Ike sits
Maggie takes the box from him and puts it aide
And then she gets down on one knee
(laughing) Oh my God
No
Maggie smiles up at him
Ike tips his head back and covers his eyes with his hand
No, no -- don't hide your face, this only happens once in a lifetime
It's definitely a first to me, and you're not going to want to miss it
He smiles as he looks at Maggie
(cont'd) love you, Homer Eisenhower Graham
Will you marry me
Ike swallows, overwhelmed, overjoyed, and scared shitless
Maggie,  gotta think about this a little bit
Maggie hops cheerfully back to her feet
(cheerful) Good
She gets off her knees and stands
(cont'd) was hoping you'd say that
(laughing) You were not
was, because if you said "yes" right away,  wouldn't get to say this next part
And 've been practicing it
(pulling up a chair and sitting) Ready
'm listening
(tenderly) " guarantee that we'll have tough times
guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out
But  also guarantee that if  don't ask you to be mine, 'll regret it for the rest of my life
Because  know in my heart -- you're the only one for me"
Ike takes her hands affectionately
Pretty good speech, Maggie
borrowed it from this guy  know
So
Ike looks into Maggie's shining face and pauses
He gets up and motions with his hand for her to stay seated
He goes inside and turns on some music
The cat is sitting by the radio
He returns to the balcony and takes Maggie's hand
Dance with me
They start to dance a slow dance
: - We see a hill and on top of it is a Pastor marrying Maggie and Ike, in beautiful wedding attire
We see Maggie walk down a leaf-lined aisle to a waiting Ike
They kiss as we hear the vows and hear them each say " do"
They kiss a twirling, whirling kiss, a circular kiss
We hear the applause of about twenty people
Slowly, we see the twenty people come over the crest of the hill
They are all Maggie's family and friends, plus the old grooms
They are all paired in twos, like a love Noah's ark
We see others get the news
- Priest Brian hears about Maggie's wedding
- Mrs
Trout hears about Maggie's wedding
- George, Groom #3, hears about Maggie's wedding
'    - Ellie and Fisher hear about Maggie's wedding
- : Maggie and Ike finally break the kiss
Ike takes her hand and walks her to two horses
Ike and Maggie, on the two horses, ride off happily in their wedding clothes
As the group cheers, Maggie throws bouquet
We see it float in the air
