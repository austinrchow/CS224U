On a quiet, tree-lined street we pick up two young athletic- looking boys riding bikes
(15) and his friend,  (15)
Like bats out of hell they pass block after block of charming, evenly spaced houses until they round a corner and drop their bikes in front of a large ranch house
'  - 2                                                                  2 They walk inside
We  a baseball game on  in another room

Laser watches
don't know, dude
Clay cuts the powder into lines with a school  card
minus in geometry, yo
This shits the bomb
Clay rolls up a dollar bill and takes a snort
Then hands the rolled up bill to Laser
(') Add it up, son
Laser takes the bill, bends over and snorts a line

Leaning against the bed we see   (18)
It's her room
She pours over a game of Scrabble
Sitting next to Joni is her best girl friend, , (18)
Sasha's checking out Joni's
2
Joni's best guy friend,  (18) sits across from her, calculating his next Scrabble move
Oh my God, Joni, there are so many hotties in your class
You are so gonna hook up the first week
Just cause you're a 24 hour drive- thru doesn't mean everyone else has to be
Hey, she worked her ass off
She deserves some hot jock sausage
Jai looks repulsed, and hurt
(') (flip) Whatever
Why don't you guys just do it and get it over with
Joni and Jai blush
They're both too scared to admit their crush on each other
(') What
'm just asking
Uh, maybe because we're friends
Oh, really
Sasha turns to Joni like an agent provocateur
'  -   - 5                                                                 5 Laser and Clay wrestle on the floor while Clay's  watches a baseball game on
They bump into the couch
Clay's dad looks back, menacing
' Hey, ladies
Take it down a notch
The boys keep wrestling, wired from the pills
Again, they knock into the couch
Clay's dad spins around, pissed
'  (') What did  just say

The Dad grabs Clay, pulls him off of Laser and over the couch
He gets his son in a headlock, forcing the boy's face into his big fat sweaty armpit
Both Dad and Clay enjoy the brutal play
Clay laughs manically
Let me go
' Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
Dad, your pits smell like burnt ass
Get off me
As Laser observes this male-bonding between father and son, we note a trace of longing on his face

Still buzzing, Laser taps his fingers incessantly on the table
Laser
Knock it off

'm not doing anything

Drops her bag and heads for the table
Hi guys
Sorry 'm late
4
Don't worry
We just started
27 fibroids
All in the lining
She kisses Jules
Honey, that's disgusting
We're eating
Did you do that laparoscopically
That's right, Smart Girl
And we got `em all
As Nic settles in
(') Hey, whose truck is that
Mine
Yours
For the business
What business
(getting edgy) The gardening
(protective) Isn't it landscaping
Yes, thank you very much
(strained) Okay
(then) Do we have any Cabarnet left
didn't look, honey

Nic gets up and goes to the kitchen for wine
Laser's cell phone
He answers it
Hey, what's up
Jules puts her hand on Laser's arm
Laser, no phone calls at the table
(into phone) Lemme hit you back
Laser hangs up
Nic re-enters with a large glass of red
(sitting down) Who was that
Nobody
Clay
Jules and Nic share a look
Jules starts making maternal windshield wiper strokes with her thumb on Laser's arm
Can  ask you something
What do you get from your relationship with Clay
What do you mean, "get"
Laser looks down at Jules' thumb on his arm
Do you feel like he's the kind of person who will help you grow
Mom, you're windshield wiping me
Hey, did you start on those thank- you notes for your birthday gifts
Not yet
But  will
6
just think it's easier to knock them out when it's fresh
Yeah,  know, 'll do them tonight
Great
mean, you don't want to have to start with an apology
You know
Then it's embarrassing
Okay, honey
She got it
Let it go
Okay, 'll let it go
(then) mean, if it was up to you, our kids wouldn't even write thank-you notes, they'd just send out good vibes
Nic takes another swig of vino and smiles at Joni through increasingly plum-stained teeth
(') can't believe my baby's 18

(devolving into baby talk) Big girl
You're a big girl
Mom
Joni mimes wiping her teeth
Embarrassed, Nic starts licking at her stained teeth

What
Laser looks nervous
7
Have you thought any more about, you know, making that call
Yeah
don't want to
Okay
was just wondering if you changed your mind
haven't
He starts to leave, but her answer bugs him
He turns back
How can you not even be curious
Sorry, Laser
just don't want to, okay
'm leaving soon and don't want to deal with that right now
(co-dependent leak) And also, that could really hurt moms' feelings
God, why do you worry about them so much
They don't even have to know about it
Look, you can do it when you turn 18, okay
never ask you for anything
Laser walks out of the room
Joni feels horrible
- 12                                                               12 Nic and Jules lay in bed watching , unwinding from the day
just don't understand why you bought the truck now
8
Because if 'm starting this business  need something to haul my equipment in
Okay
It just seems a little cart before the horse
What does that mean
Sweetie, you don't even have any clients yet
Well you're the one who's always telling me to "act as if
" (back peddling) That's true
do
You're right
The women settle back
Nic sees Jules feels bad
(') Look, 'm sorry
It's good you bought the truck
Its proactive
Nic caresses Jules' arm, wanting to make it better
(') Hey
Jules doesn't look at Nic
She keeps her eyes on the
(') Wanna watch a movie
Jules perks up
Nic immediately regrets her suggestion

Yeah
We haven't done that in a while

She heads for the desk and stealthy opens a drawer
She rummages though with clear intention
She pulls out a  and studies the cover
We see the words: "Pacific Cryo Clinic: Bringing your dreams to life
" - 14                                                                14 - We now only see Nic
Jules has slipped under the blanket, and is now between Nic's legs
We see Nic trying to get into it, but having a hard time
don't like the guys in this one
They're too shaved
Don't focus on it
How about the one with the biker gang
We left it in Hawaii
Jules wrestles with the blankets
Wants them out of her way
(pulling them back up) 'm cold, honey
Sorry
couldn't breathe
Jules wrangles the blankets, trying to cover her partner
The transition is awkward and Jules gets caught in the top sheet
As Nic repositions herself, she leans on the and suddenly the porn is blasting at full volume
10
Suck that fat cock mother-fucker
Shit
Where's the remote
'm gonna fuck that tight ass
Jules and Nic both dive for the remote
It's lost under the mass of bedding
They struggle to find it as the grunting and 70's disco music blares
- 15                                                                  15 Joni turns to the wall, confused
She hears the porno music pulsing though

Jesus Christ
Nic flops back, traumatized
(') The whole neighborhood heard that
No, they didn't
Well, that was a vibe kill
Jules looks defeated

She flips though some pages of documents and stops

He approaches , (30's) the restaurant's super sexy hostess
How you doing, foxy
Mm, flapjack, you're smelling ripe
Oh, sorry
No,  like it
It's earthy
What can  say
've just been out there, you know
hoe-ing
(looking at the seating chart) How's it looking tonight
They stand close to each other, peering at the chart
Gonna be tight
Really
Paul's cell rings
He gives Tanya a hand squeeze and heads for the kitchen, answering
(') Hello
' Hi, is this Paul Hatfield
It is
Who's this
12
' My name is Wendy Minter
'm calling from The Pacific Cryobank
Okay
What can  do for you
just need to confirm that you donated sperm with us between 1991 and 1993
At the mention of the word sperm, Paul goes pale
Yeah
did a little bit of that back then
- 20                                                              20 Paul enters
The kitchen is humming with  prepping for the dinner rush
He looks around for a quiet spot
As you know the Cryobank has a confidentiality policy which prohibits us from releasing your identity without your consent
cook, , approaches Paul to speak with him
Paul nods: "Can't talk
" Hands her the box of tomatoes
Uh-huh
Paul heads to the back of the kitchen, searching for privacy

(
) Well we've been contacted by a young woman conceived using your semen, and she's asked if you'd be open to having contact with her
Paul's speechless
19                                                              19 13

You must of figured you'd get a call at some point
Not really
mean  was 19 when did it
It was so long ago just figured no one actually used my stuff
Tanya moves closer to him, flirty
Why
'd use it
(ignoring the innuendo) This is so weird
mean, a part of me's really curious
So what are you gonna do
don't know

Joni's cell rings
She grabs it off the counter and answers
Hello

He picks weeds as he talks
Conversation intercut
14
Hi, 'm looking for Joni Allgood
This is she
Hi
This is Paul
(clearing his throat) Uh, your donor
Oh
Hi
Joni shoots up out of her chair and starts leaving the room to get some privacy away from her mom
Is this a good time to talk
(flustered) Yeah
Where are you going
It's your turn
Joni doesn't answer
She just walks out to her backyard
So
(doesn't know what to say) How are you
'm good
How are you
'm well, thanks
Banal, awkward pause
Paul jumps in to fill the void
(') So, Wendy at the Cryobank said you call-- Joni cuts in, nervous and businesslike
15
Actually, my brother   asked if 'd call you because 'm   18 and he's only 15 which is too   young to call-- anyway, he'd like to   meet you
if you want to
(thrown) Your brother
Yeah
Well, technically my half- brother
Each of my moms had a kid, you know, with your sperm
No
didn't know
Oh
Both of them
Yeah
Like in two
Uh huh
Like in gay
Good deal
love lesbians
Paul cringes at his lameness
Joni doesn't know what to say

They're both clearly nervous
just don't want you to have big expectations
16
Will you quit saying that
don't have any expectations
Okay
'm just saying he might be weird
mean, he donated sperm
Well if he hadn't done it, you wouldn't be here
So respect, yo

He nervously checks the door as customers enter
- Joni and Laser enter the restaurant
They look nervous too
He studies them for a beat, sees them looking around
Figures they must be "his kids
" They look in his direction, spot him
He raises his hand, stands
They walk over
The moment is rife
Paul holds out his hand to Joni
Joni
Hey
Nice to meet you
Nice to meet you too
Paul holds out a hand to Laser
And Laser, right
Right
Very cool name
Thanks
17
Thanks for making the trek all the way over here
No one knows what comes next
(') Cool,  got a table set up for us out here
Paul turns and leads them out to the outdoor dining area

Paul can't help but study their faces
Listen, feel free and ask me anything you want, okay
(off their stares) Or we can just hang out
That's fine too
Whatever you guys want
/ Okay
Paul presses on, trying to break the ice
Anything you want to ask me, Laser
uh
didn't really have any specific questions
(helping him out) That's fine
'd love to know about you guys
What about you, Joni
What are you up to
Uh, well,  just graduated high school
'm starting college in the fall
Oh yeah
Congratulations
18
Joni's the brains in the family
She won a National Merit Scholarship
Shut the front door
Yeah
And she got like an 800 on her Verbal
Okay, Laser
What
'm just saying you're really smart
No,  just work harder than you
Don't stress it, Laze
School wasn't my thing either and  turned out okay
(re: his name) Laser
'm sorry
Laser
(beat) So tell me about you, Laser
What are you into
Laser freezes
So his sister jumps in
Laser's an amazing athlete
Oh yeah
Did you play any sports in school
played a little basketball in junior high
19
That's it
Pretty much
The whole "team" thing got on my nerves, you know like, "Hey, let's go kick some ass, man
" What about you
play some Soccer
Basketball
Baseball
You know, team sports
Paul realizes he's put his foot in his mouth
Hey,  wasn't bagging teams in general
Teams are great
'm just weird like that
Yeah,  like teams
We can tell Laser is growing frustrated at his inability to connect with Paul
Joni jumps in
So this is your place
Yeah, 've been working on it for a while
also have this organic co- op farm down the road
We use a lot of the stuff we grow there for the restaurant
(excited) That's so cool
'm totally into local
(busting her) You are
Uh, yeah Laser
've been like trying to get moms to buy local for forever
Laser tries again to reconnect
20
So, like, do you raise pigs and stuff
No
No pigs
(beat) But it's a great spot
You guys should come check it out sometime
Yeah
Definitely
Excited, Joni turns to Laser
He seems uninterested

Paul walks to a classic  motorcycle
Lasers tries to hide his awe
Is that yours
Yeah
You like motorcycles
Yeah, but
our moms are kind of anti-motorcycle
And by "kind of" he means they'd kill us if we ever rode one
That's too bad
They're fun
Time to say goodbye
Again, no one knows the protocol here
After an awkward beat, Paul holds out his arms for hugs
(') Well it was great to meet you guys
He and Joni hug
(') hope this was okay
Yeah
totally
thank you
Now Paul and Laser share a somewhat awkward man-hug
21
Really nice to meet you, Laser
Yeah
Joni gives a quick wave to Paul
She turns to go and Laser follows
Paul watches them walk away
He looks stirred up by the meeting

He was so cool and interesting
can't believe that was him
He was so nice, you know

You guess
Yeah
God, Laser
You're the one that wanted to meet him so bad

He seemed kind of into himself

They see Laser on his way out of the house
Hey bug, come here
We're watching "Locked Up Abroad: Uganda
" saw it
It was gnarly
Where are you going
Clay's
Jules and Nic shoot each other a concerned look
Don't be back late, okay
know
Can  have a hug before you go
Mom
Just a quick one
Please
Hug her
That's what she's there for
Laser leaves
Nic hits mute on the , looks at Jules
Ugh
Maybe we should just sit him down and ask him already
What
"Are you and Clay fucking
" "Exploring" is the word 'd use
23
And what if he is "exploring
" This is the age for that
Why should we care
We shouldn't
(then) just don't understand why he's exploring with that loser
Look, we don't even know what the deal is
We're jumping to conclusions
feel like he has so much potential and he's just wasting it
Nic's comment hits a nerve in Jules
What are you trying to say
What do you mean, what am  trying to say
It feels like there's some subtext here
What are you talking about
don't know: Like mother like son
Is that it
Both of us aimless, wandering in the darkness, "wasting our potential
" Nic won't go there
Okay, honey, you're on a whole other tangent and  have no idea what you're talking about
Well, maybe it hasn't risen to the plane of consciousness for you yet
24
Yeah
Maybe not
Nic clicks the volume back on, freezing Jules out

So what were they like
Sweet
They were really good kids
The boy's kind of a sensitive jock and the girl's kind of innocent but whip-smart and super cute
Sounds like you connected
Yeah, we kinda did
Where'd you leave it
We didn't really leave it anywhere
Brooke, the sexy Wiccan volunteer, comes up to Paul bearing a basket of freshly-picked fruits
Hey Paul
Paul leans over the basket
Whatcha got
Oh cool
First strawberries of the season
Don't they look awesome
thought you should have the first taste
And with that, she smiles, hands him the basket and leaves

Clay freezes

Clay turns on the dildo

37                                                             37 38                                                             38 -  - 39                                                             39 Jules pulls her truck into the driveway, almost running over Laser's bike
'  - 40                                                             40 Laser and Clay are still watching the porn
as Jules walks in the room
Laser, you left your bike out
Laser reflexively grabs for the remote
As he fumbles for it, Jules sees what they're watching
She looks mortified
-  - 41                                                             41 We enter a family conference already in progress
Nic and Jules act calm but are inwardly mortified that their 15-year-old son found their porn
Laser, your mom and  accept you and love you unconditionally
You know that, right
Yeah
And you know you can be open with us about anything
27
Yeah,  know
Jules steels herself for a frank discussion
Laser, is there anything you want to talk about
Like what
Anything
Anything on your mind
Laser cracks his knuckles
Well there is something
Nic and Jules share a look
"Here we go
" (') It's more of a question, really
That's okay
We won't judge you
Laser looks at his moms
Nic and Jules brace themselves
Why do you guys watch gay man-porn
Nic and Jules look at each other, thrown
Well, first  have to say we rarely watch that movie-- Jules touches Nic's arm
Honey
And secondly,  really don't appreciate you snooping around our room
Was that Clay's idea have to say again,  don't like him
He seems untended
28
Honey, that's not what he asked-- (snapping) Fine
Do you want to answer his question
Well, sweetie, human sexuality is complicated
And sometimes, people's desires can be
counter- intuitive
(soldiering on) For instance, since women's sexual responsiveness is mostly internal, sometimes it's exciting for us to see sexual responsiveness more, you know
(beat) externalized
Laser looks at them, still baffled
(') Like with a penis
But like, wouldn't you rather watch two women doing it
You would think that
But in most of those movies, they've hired two straight women to pretend and the inauthenticity is just unbeara-- Okay, that's enough
Laser, your mom and  have a sense there's some other stuff going on in your life and we just want to be let in
What do you mean
Are you having a relationship with someone
You could tell us, honey
We'd understand and support you
29
Laser looks confused
How did they find out about Paul
just met him once
Nic and Jules share a worried look
What do you mean once
Did he find you on-line
What
Who did you meet once
Paul
met him with Joni
Who's Paul
Why was Joni there
She set it up
Forget the set-up
Who is Paul
Our sperm donor
Jules and Nic go white
(') Wait, did you guys think  was gay
-   - 42                                                                 42 Joni has been pulled into the family conference
Nic and Jules are trying to remain as calm as possible
Nic slugs a gulp of wine
30
Look, guys, we understand why you'd be curious about your biological father
That's totally natural
But why didn't you tell us
Because we knew you'd be upset
'
Jules calms her riled-up partner
Honey
(to Joni; expressing her upset more calmly) We just wish you'd have included us in your thinking
But what's done is done
You met him, and now you guys can move on-- (sheepish) Actually
(beat) want to see him again
You do
You do
(') (to Laser) Yeah
was gonna tell you
Whoa
Whoa
No
No way
(regaining dominance) Nobody is seeing anyone until we meet him
Joni looks at Laser
They knew this would happen
'  - 43                                                           43 Nic and Jules do a post-mortem as they floss
31
Yeah,  get it
He's their biological father and all that crap but it still feels really shitty
Like we're not enough or something, you know
Of course  know
don't want to time-share our kids with someone
Especially when it's Joni's last summer home
No way
When Jules leaves the room Nic pulls a clump of long, wet red hair out of the sink
Jesus, Jules
The plumber was just here
Nic throws the clump of hair in the trash
- 44                                                             44 (getting tactical) Look, we need to be smart about this
If we act like grubby bitches, we're just gonna make it worse
know
Let's just kill him with kindness and put it to bed
'm with you, honey
(then) We're gonna get through this, okay
Nic smiles
She loves when Jules shows confidence
love you, chicken
The women bump fists
They have a plan
love you too, pony
32
- 45                                                                45 Paul rides slowly down the street, checking addresses
He pulls over and cuts his engine in front of the Allgood house
46                                                                46 /
- 47                                                                47 Paul rings the bell
Waits
The door opens and Nic and Jules are there smiling with "kill him with kindness" faces
Paul
It is so great to meet you
'm Nic
This is Jules
Paul shakes their hands
Hi, great to meet you two
hope the traffic wasn't too bad
No, 've got my bike so
just sort of weave through
Nic clocks the motorcycle, stifles the impulse to judge
Great
Well, come on in
As they enter, Paul holds out a bottle of wine
This is for you
don't know if you guys like wine
Nic takes it
Are you kidding
We love it
(checking the label) And a Petit Syrah
What a treat
Let me get some glasses
Nic leaves Paul by the stairs with Jules
Little silence
Jules steals a look at him, unable to contain her curiosity
33
Beautiful house
How long you guys lived here
Almost ten years
Wait, has it been that long
(rambling nervously) We moved right after Laser broke his leg,  remember that because we had a ramp for a while, so that would have been
ten, no, nine
No, ten years this fall
Paul nods, smiling at her nervousness
Okay
Laser and Joni enter
Joni lights up when she sees Paul
Jules watches Paul hug her
Uncomfortable, she heads for -- Jules finds Nic's pouring herself a sizable glass of wine
You okay
(not okay) Yeah
Fine
Jules feels her inner co-dependent swelling in her chest
Go easy on the wine, hon
It's day time
Okay
And same goes for the micro- managing
- 48                                                                48 Everyone sits at the picnic table
hope the food's okay
Joni told us you own a restaurant
34
The food's great
Can't go wrong with salmon and corn
Nic finishes a glass of wine as Jules takes note
So Paul, did you always know you wanted to be in food-services industry
Paul smiles at Nic, trying to disarm her
Well,  always liked food
No,  was asking because  remember reading in your file, back when we were looking for, you know, sperm, anyway, you said you were studying international relations
Oh yeah
Wow, that was a long time ago
Yeah,  was considering it, but then  dropped out of school
You dropped out of college
Yeah, it wasn't my thing
(squinching) No
Why's that
It just seemed like a massive waste of money after a while
mean, wasn't "doing" anything
was just sitting on my ass listening to people spout off ideas  could've just as easily learned reading a book
Paul sees that his little rant may be alienating the moms
(') 'm not saying higher learning uniformly sucks
mean, college is great for some people
() 35
(') Joni, 'm sure you're gonna love it
That's just me
'm just weird that way
(beat) Which is probably why  ended up in the food-services industry
See what he did there, mom
You said "food-services industry," then he said "food-services industry
" Yeah,  got it, Laser
Thanks
(apropos of nothing) So, Paul, what about your social life
My social life
You know, are you married, divorced, seeing anyone
Mom
What
We're getting to know Paul
No, never been married or divorced
date a little, but 'm just kind of focused on my work right now
Oh
Paul wants a break from the heat
So, how'd you guys meet
Jules smiles, embarrassed
Nic jumps in
We met at
was a resident in the  and Jules had an emergency
My tongue went numb
36
Really
We turn to see Laser, pounding his head on the table
Laser, that's not nice
What's not nice is subjecting your kids to the same story 1000 times
(ignoring Laser) What happened to your tongue
don't know
just lost all the feeling in my face and tongue and thought  might gag and then, you know
Choke
Die
Yeah
exactly
Well it was pretty clear to me she was just having an anxiety attack and she'd be fine
So what'd you do for her
Gave her a Vallium
Tried to get her to relax, talk, move her tongue around
Mom, that's gross
(ignoring Laser, to Nic) Actually, she started teasing me and that really helped
was trying to distract you
37
know
And it worked
You were really funny
You were really pretty
Nic reaches over and caresses Jules' hand
Joni rolls her eyes, embarrassed
So that's it
My tongue started working again
And we've been glued at the hip ever since
That's a great story
(beaming) We like it
Laser and Joni share a look
So Nic,  know you're a doctor
How `bout you, Jules
What do you do
Jules never likes this question
Well, , you know,  studied architecture in college
Right
But 'm not an architect
mean was on my way to becoming one
But quit before the kids were born
Well, that happens
When they got a little older, started a Balinese furniture import business
38
Right on
Yeah
But that didn't work out
Well, business aren't easy-- Actually, 'm in the process of starting a new business
Good for you
What kind
Landscape design
(before he can respond) But not like a gardener
mean, yes, there's a gardening component to it, but the real work is to create unique, eco-friendly outdoor spaces that harmonize with the surrounding environment
Do you know what  mean
Absolutely
In Nic's mind, Jules is drowning in verbiage
So she jumps in to save her
Hey Paul, did Joni tell you about her graduation speech
No, she didn't
It was incredible
So full of wisdom and hope
(turning to her Joni) Hon, go get it
'm sure he'd love to hear it
(blushing) No, mom, 'm sure he wouldn't
39
Sure he would
Come on
Go get it
(getting upset) No, it's okay
Sweetie, don't be embarrassed
'm not embarrassed
Jesus
Give it a rest already
This outburst stuns Nic into silence
Her daughter has never spoken to her like this
Laser stands up
'll get the ice-cream
(standing up) 'll help you
Joni and Laser leave the room
Nic pours herself the last of Paul's Petit Syrah
Jules smiles, covering her anxiety
(softly) Honey, that's your forth glass
Actually, it's my third
But thanks for counting
Paul turns to Jules, trying to revive the mood
Hey,  was just thinking
You know,  bought this place last year and the backyard's a wreck
Would you be interested in working on it
(insecure) Oh, that's okay
No, seriously
don't have time to work on it myself
40
Thank you
That's really sweet
Why don't you think about it
Why
just did
(then) mean, if you're not up for it that's okay-- (jumping on it) No
am
(getting excited) 'm up for it
Jules smiles at Nic: "Isn't this great
My first client
" Nic looks less than pleased
49                                                                 49 - 50                                                                 50 Nic pushes a cart piled high with gardening supplies
Jules grabs a couple  of fertilizer, throws them on top
'm just saying, the plan was to limit his involvement-- You're unbelievable
You're all over me about getting clients, finally get one and you're-- He's not just a client, Jules
He's our sperm donor
Have you ever heard the phrase "Don't Shit Where You Eat
" Yes, and  think it's disgusting
The two separate, go down separate isles
When they rejoin, Nic is contrite
'm sorry
He just seemed sort of
self-satisfied to me
41
Jules grabs the olive branch
Yeah, he was working the whole "alternative" thing pretty hard
(mimicking) " just need to get outside and `do' things, not sit on my ass and learn
But that's just me
'm weird that way
" They both laugh
Nic's funny sometimes
'  -   - 51                                                                51 Jules drives slowly up the hill looking for Paul's address
She sees the house and pulls in the driveway next to an old truck and a motorcycle
'  -   - 52                                                                52 Jules and Paul walk through Paul's backyard, evaluating
We could do a kind of a Secret Garden thing with trellises and topiary
(clocking his face) or something more Asian, minimal, with a rock garden feel
It's up to you
What do you think
Personally, 'm tired of minimal
'm into more is more
Let's not try to tame the space
think it would look great all lush and overgrown and fecund
Fecund
'm sorry, you know, fertile
42
No,  love that word
You just don't hear it that often
(thinking) More is more
Yeah
Let's do that
Jules is staring at Paul
(') What
Sorry,  just keep seeing my kids in your expressions
Jules looks more intensely at Paul's face
(') You and Laser have the same mouth
You think so
Yeah
The observation strikes Paul
Suddenly, he's feeling a kind of fast-tracked intimacy with Jules he hadn't expected
-   - 53                                                             53 Jules and Laser play Ping-Pong as Nic gets home with Chinese take-out for the family dinner
What's the score
Pretty close
Laser cranks a forehand that whizzes past Jules
20-3
match point
So how'd it go today
Great
We settled on a concept
43
What is it
It's hard to explain
You have to kind of see the space to get it
(to Laser) Laser, did you write Pup-pup a Get Well card
(off his silence) Laser
What do  have to do bought you a card
left it on your desk
All you had to do was-- Mom, settle
will
Don't tell me to settle, mister
And if it's not in the mail by tomorrow morning, we're not going to the Dodger game Saturday
Whatever,  have other plans anyway
What other plans
(off his silence) 'm asking you a quest-- said 'd do something with Paul
Laser serves a rocket, whizzing past a flailing Jules
He tosses the racquet on the table and leaves
Nic yells: You used to be so cute
- 54                                                               54 We cut onto Paul and Laser, looking out at something
Laser is holding a
This may not be a good idea
44
(
) Are you filming
We cut to Clay on a skateboard on the ledge of a brick wall
He's preparing to ride the ledge, jump a dumpster and land his board on the ground
(to Laser) He's not gonna make it
(calling to Clay) Clay, you're not gonna make it
think he may be right, dude
Maybe this isn't such a good idea
Will you quit being a man-gina and run the camera
'm only doing this once so keep my shit in frame
Laser sighs, then holds up the camera
Paul looks at Laser, wondering why he puts up with this guy
' : We watch as Clay psychs himself up   with an assortment of deep breaths and head-slaps
Finally,   he starts down the ledge
He starts his jump, catches air   and hits the edge of the dumpster and falls
We see him go   into the dumpster and land with a nauseating
Paul and   Laser rush up and look over the edge
/ There's Clay, his arm bent at a disturbing angle, in agony
Did you get that
Seriously, dude, are you okay
'm fucking fine
Fuck
Did you fucking get it
'  - 55                                                              55 Paul and Laser walk over to Paul's truck
45
Maybe next time we can hang out just you and me
Clay's cool
He's just gets a little amped sometimes
That's not amped
That's being a dick
He's not a dick, that's just his way
Okay
just didn't like the way he was talking to you
(defensive) Well, you don't know him
(back-peddling) You're right
don't
Hey, can  ask you a question
Sure
Why'd you donate sperm
Well, it's a lot more fun then donating blood
Laser doesn't laugh
Paul realizes he's gonna have to give a "non-joke" answer
(') don't know,  guess  thought, you know, if  can help somebody in need, somebody who wants a baby
Laser's not really buying that
So you did it to help people
46
It was a long time ago
How much did you get paid
Why do you want to know
'm just curious
don't know, like 60 bucks a pop
That's it
It was worth more back then
You know
With inflation
(off Laser's look) Hey, 'm glad  did it
Laser doesn't quite buy Paul's altruism
He looks over at him, then away
'  - 56                                                                  56 Jai and Joni and Sasha play Scrabble
Sasha checks out the photos of Paul on Joni's phone
Hello
Donor Dad
Stone cold fox
Must you take everything beautiful and make it dirty
'm just saying
Spermster's a hottie
Is he single
Okay, first of all, ewww
Second, he's a really good person and 'd prefer it if you didn't taint him with your whore juice
Sasha hops up, energized by the banter
47
Fair enough, hairy muff
'm outta here
You love birds can split my letters
Sasha splits and suddenly the room is thick with nervous tension
You want to keep playing
Sure
As Jai incorporates Sasha's tiles into his own, we see Joni gathering her nerve to make a move
Jai probably feels it but in his nervousness he can't look at Joni
(') Sometimes  feel sorry for Sasha, you know
Yeah
Joni starts to move in, her face draws closer to Jai's, inch by inch
Somehow, deep down, Jai can sense her moving towards him which exhilarates and freaks the shit out of him at the same time
To the point where he lets slip
It's like she has to sexualize every experience, you know
It's just sad
That stops Joni in her tracks
Yeah, it is
It's really sad
Jai's sabotaged the mood and they both know it
'  - 57                                                                57 Jules walks in to find Nic in sexy satin man-'s, sitting at the rim of a
There are candles burning
Wow
What's this
48
Come here
Sit down
Jules takes a seat beside her
Nic holds her hand
(') 'm sorry 've been such a bitch lately
know 'm not being my highest self
Yeah, well
You've been really patient with me
just want you to know that hasn't gone unrecognized
Nic gives her a long, sweet kiss
Jules is warming up
(') Get in
- In the tub, revelling in the warm bubbly water
Nic is sitting on the ledge, massaging her feet
Oh god, chicken, that's the spot
How's the water
Perfect
You wanna come in
In a bit
You enjoy it first
Nic goes deeper with the massage
Jules' eyes roll back
(') Oh,  forgot the lavender salts
Nic starts to get up
Jules grabs her hand
No, don't stop
No,  meant to put `em in
49
Nic gets up and sashays to the door
(') Don't move
Nic exits
Jules sinks back, wishing Nic had stayed
- 58                                                               58 Still waiting
Getting impatient and upset
Nic
No response
-- 54                                                               54 Nic is on her cell with a patient, a glass of wine in her hand
Jules walks in wearing a bathrobe
Nic turns
Raises a finger and mouths: "Sorry
" No, we're planning on being here through mid-August so
(beat) No,  promise, 'm not going anywhere
Jules' face drops; she turns and leaves
59                                                               59 /

Luis hauls shrubs
'  -  - 61                                                               61 Paul and Jules stand at the kitchen table, looking over her sketch for the yard
Look, 'm gonna go to the nursery in the morning so we should probably make sure you're signed off on the Bougainvillea
Jules looks over at a pan on the kitchen counter
50
(') What's that
Strawberry rhubarb pie
Fresh from my garden
Paul hands her a fork and she takes a big bite
Her eyes roll back in her head
(') Good, huh
Oh my god
That is criminal
Have more
No, please, just take it away
You had one bite
have another you may as well just tape it to my ass cause that's where it'll end up
Hey now, don't go negative on your ass
Jules blushes at all this talk of her ass
So
you're good with the plants
(off his silence) Look, we don't have to do that
We could do go in a totally different direction if you-- No, 'm just thinking
Hang on
(covers his eyes) Yeah, 'm good with the plants
Sorry
Sometimes  mistake silence for criticism
51
wasn't criticizing you
No,  know
just
(beat) Sometimes Nic can be a little critical, you know
She's a perfectionist
That doesn't mean you have to be negative
Jules looks away
We  a knock from the back
(
) Excuse me, Senora
Hello
Jules turns, sees Luis standing at the glass door
What's up
5 o'clock
Yeah
Okay
Jules wants Luis to leave her alone
But he's not going
Same time tomorrow
Yes
Same time
Luis leaves
Jules turns back to Paul, laughs nervously
(') Okay
'm gonna take off too
(in Luis's accent) Same time tomorrow
Jules pushes Paul, laughing
That's mean
Paul hands her a Tupperware with some of the pie in it
52
Here, take this
No
Just give it to the kids
Okay
God, you're such a pusher
Jules grabs the pie and gives him a kiss on the mouth, almost as a mistake
Before they know it, they're making out
Jules snaps back, freaked
(') Whoa
'm sorry
That was don't know where that came from
(freaked himself) It's okay
Okay
'm gonna go now
Jules starts backing away, acting as if nothing happened
Jules
(overcompensating) but  shall return
Jules bolts for the door, clutching her pie
Paul watches her go, stunned by what just happened
- 62                                                                 62 Nic's in bed reading a magazine
Jules gets in bed, paranoid
Nic puts her magazine down
So how'd it go with Paul
(jumpy) What do you mean
53
don't know
Did you break ground
Did you dig in
don't know the terms
No, we just talked
conceptually
Oh, so it was less of a "doing" day, huh
Was he okay with that
You know, maybe we should lay off the Paul digs a little
Okay
You're right
Chastened, Nic looks back at her magazine
Jules rolls over
And  also think we should start composting
63                                                               63 -   -  - 64                                                               64 Sweating and dirty, Joni and Paul pull radishes from the ground
They're in a zone together
Paul takes off his sun- hat and put it on Joni's head
You got your mom's fair skin
You didn't get my Mediterranean genes
Thanks
Joni's cell rings
She looks
Rolls her eyes
(') Ugh
Ignore
Joni hits the ignore button, puts her cell away
Who's that
54
My mom, Nic
She's making me insane
Why
What's she doing
She's treating me like 'm 12
It's like she doesn't want to admit 'm an adult
She's your mom
That's her job
What
To smother me to death
That's not her job
Well, if you want things to be different, you've got to make that happen
That's your job

Clay sports a homemade arm-cast for the skateboard mishap we witnessed earlier
That jump was cake, dude
so could've made it
You were like 20 feet short, dude
There was no way
Yeah, well if Paul wasn't there could have landed it
That guy creeps me out
Whatever
He's kind of a fag, dude
Tryin' to act all like your dad and shit
Laser doesn't know how to respond so he ignores the comment
stray  comes up to them
Laser stops to pet it
55
Hey buddy
Good boy
Laser sees the dog has no tags
He looks around for an owner
The dog nuzzles Laser for affection
(') 've seen this dog around wonder if he's lost
Let's pee on his head
What
Clay unzips his fly
It's difficult with the plaster cast
(') Dude, don't do that
Come on
Hold him
Clay yanks the dog by his scruff
Dude, Quit it
(mocking) Duuude, quit it
Suddenly, Laser gets it
His friend is the tool
He grabs the dog and smacks him to get him to run away
Go
Run
Get out of here
The dog
Clay shoves Laser
Why are you such a fag
Laser shoves Clay back hard
Why are you such a dick
Clay  Laser in the mouth
Laser touches his lip
Sees blood, and walks away
Friendship over

Paul grabs his helmet off the bike, hands it to Joni
Here, put this on
Joni takes the helmet and puts it on
Paul fastens the buckle for her
They get on the bike and take off down the hill

Relax
She'll get home when she gets home
Quit telling me to relax
They go back to watching
After a beat, we  a motorcycle pull up
(') What the fuck

Nic storms out of the house to intercept them by the sidewalk
Funny how someone conveniently forgot to tell me they were driving home on a motorcycle
Mom
57
You know how many people 've seen come into the hospital paralyzed from motorcycle accidents
'm a very safe rider
That is so not the point 'm making
Joni knows this is something 'd never allow
Mom, 'm 18 years old
won't even be living here in like next month
Yeah, well, you're living here now
Yeah, well why don't you get a jump on it and pretend like 'm not
Joni storms off
Nic glowers at Paul
She's never talked to me like that
(trying to soften it) You know, Nic
If you eased up on the restrictions, maybe there'd be less tension
(marinated in sarcasm) Really
You think so, Paul
Is that how it works
Jules walks up to intervene
What's going on
Oh, nothing
Paul's just giving me child-rearing lessons
was just saying-- 58
Listen, when you've been a parent for 18 years, come talk to me
was just making an observation
Yeah, and  need your observations like  need a dick in my ass
Nic storms off
Jules follows
Paul watches, shell shocked
70                                                                70 - '  - 71                                                                71 Nic knocks on the door
Get's no response
Joni
(silence) was just upset
You know how feel about motorcycles
Joni opens the door
(patronizing) know how you feel about them
But 'm an adult now and you have to respect that
Goodnight
Joni closes the door on her

Jules' thong peaking out of her jeans
Luis walks across Paul's field of vision, interrupting his reverie
'  - 74                                                                74 Jules steps tentatively into Paul's house
59
Paul
Jules walks further into the house
She looks anxious
Paul opens his office door and sees Jules in the hall
Hey
What's up
Look, 'm sorry about last night
'm really embarrassed
Don't be
She's the one who wigged out
know, she's just going through a lot of stuff right now
Jules, it's okay
You don't have to defend her
They stare at each other, unsure how to act
And look,  just want you to know, about the other day, the kiss, that's not something
do
Yeah,  sensed that
She takes a step toward him, feverish
just wanted to clear the air
They stare at each other
It's like watching two magnets
The air is clear
Jules grabs Paul and starts smothering him with kisses
It takes a second for Paul to get his bearings, but when he does, he starts kissing her back with equal fervor, pushing her up against the wall, wedging his hand between her legs
Paul,  can't
60
You don't want to
No,  do
It's just
(urgent whisper) have a guy outside
Overcome with lust, Jules wraps her legs around his waist and Paul walks her into
75                                                              75 Quick cuts of their awkward ravenous gropings
Somewhere between slapstick and animal
He pulls her hair back hard
She loves it
She pulls his hair back harder
He yelps
She pulls down his underwear
Her eyes widen
It's been decades since she's seen a hard cock in the flesh
Oh
Well
Hel-lo
Cut to them fucking
It's gawky and passionate
Somewhere in the middle of it, Jules starts laughing
What
Nothing
Paul flips her on her hands and knees and they go at it some more
She keeps laughing
Paul goes harder to make her stop
The paces grows quicker
They're getting closer
And then
(
) Hello
Excuse me, Senora Allgood
They stop mid-thrust
You gotta be fucking kidding me
She dislodges from Paul and starts dressing furiously

61
What's up
Where do you want the stones
(catching her breath) The stones
Over by the fence
Luis stares at his employer
She looks totally disheveled
Jules starts feeling her hair, smoothing it into shape
(') (defensive) What
was using the bathroom
(then) Do you need to use the bathroom
Luis stares at her feet
She looks down
She's barefoot

There's a tense-ness to their patter
Laser takes the ball and steps to the top of the key and shoots
Drains it
That's
know
Laser steps up to left side of the basket, calls his shot
Lay-up
Hey, don't take it easy on me cause you're winning-- Laser does a trick behind the back lay-up
Nails it
Then tosses the ball to Paul
(') Nobody likes a show-off
Hey, can  ask you a question
62
Oh god
Okay
Hit me
When you die do you want to be buried or cremated
That's your question
want to be cremated
think 'd rather be buried
Why
That's just taking up more space in the earth
don't know, something about the idea of being burned into this chalky powder and sprinkled-- What do you care
You won't even be conscious
That's true
guess  just want to be in a place where people can visit me
(growing animated) But why
You'll be dead
You won't even know they're there

Tanya has temporarily joined them
Sasha checks out Tanya's oversized African bead necklace
Joni watches Paul charm customers
God,  love your necklace
Where'd you get it
don't know, some flea market-- 63
In Africa
No, more like Pasadena
Well, it's really awesome
Paul saunters up to the table and stands behind Sasha
He mindlessly places his hand on Sasha's shoulder
Sorry guys,  need to steal Tanya back now
Sasha clocks Paul's hand
She carefully and without looking back places her hand on top of his
That's okay, Paul
(getting up) Well ladies, it was fun talking with you
/ You too
Paul pulls his hand away from Sasha's and walks off with Tanya
Sasha turns to Joni
Okay, 'm sorry but your donor daddy is giving me the sex vibe
No he's not
He wouldn't do that
Why not
He's not my dad
God Sasha, that's totally gross
Not everybody wants to have sex with you, okay
Especially when you act like a slut
Fuck you
64
Well it makes you seem insecure and desperate
'm not insecure and desperate
'm just a normal sexual person
And maybe you'd get that if you weren't so uptight
Fuck you
'm not uptight

Nic's drinking like a fish
Oh my god, these heirloom tomatoes are insane
Joni brought some home from Paul's garden the other day
They were huge
Nic tightens at the mention of Paul
So, the kids have been spending time with him
Oh, yeah, they're spending all kinds of quality time together
(senses the sarcasm) Well, it's great they like him so much
You know, you hear these stories about kids meeting their donors and the guys end up being nothing like they were on paper
No, everyone's getting along famously
Apparently Paul can do no wrong
Nic grabs a passing waiter by the arm
65
(') Can we get another bottle of the Seavey Cabernet
Jules gives Nic a look
Joel and Stella feel the tension between them
Hey, have you guys tried those Acai fruit packs
No, but they're pushing them like crack at Whole Foods
know
Joel's addicted
What  do is  throw one in the blender with some bananas, frozen strawberries and hemp milk and 'll tell you, it's sensational
Nic slaps her forehead
Oh, just fucking kill me
Everyone stiffens
Jules is embarrassed
Honey
'm sorry guys, but  just can't, with the fucking hemp milk and the organic farming and heirloom tomatoes
(mocking-voice) "Oh no, don't throw that in the trash, no man, you gotta throw that into the composting bin so the fucking worms can shit all over it and turn it into glorious multch and we can all feel better about ourselves
" God
What a bunch of bullshit
Nic takes a big swallow from her glass
Jules windshield wipes Nic's forearm
66
(sotto) How about some green tea, honey
Nic slams her glass on the table
Explodes
You know what, Jules
like my wine
Okay
So fucking sue me
And fyi, red wine has a chemical called Resveratrol in it, which has been proven to significantly extend human lifespan
Yeah, if you drink a thousand bottles a day
Fuck you
Nic storms off
Jules turns to Joel and Stella, ashen
'm sorry

Nic is sitting in the corner
What the hell is going on with you
This whole Paul thing is driving me crazy
feel like he's taking over my family
Jules tries to bring it down
She yells in hushed tones
No
He's not
(nerves fraying) Okay
Okay
'm sorry
'm just exhausted
Maybe you need to take some time off and recharge
67
(self-pitying) Sure, and who's gonna pay for that
Jules looks pissed off, and hurt
(') Look, 'm sorry,  just feel like 'm carrying the whole load here
Because that's the way you like it
That's the way you keep control
This is Jules' break-point
What are you talking about
Oh come on
You hated it when worked
You wanted me at home, taking care of the kids
You wanted a wife
That is just not true
You didn't trust any of those nannies
And you sure as hell didn't back my career
What are you talking about
just helped you start another business
Yeah, so you can feel better about yourself
No, so you can feel better about yourself
Are you even attracted to me anymore

Do you still want this

No

Jules writhes beneath him, her eyes closed
Paul seems to be in some kind of zone
He stares at her, enthralled

Jules slithers around the covers, stoned on post-coital endorphins
God,  feel so drugular right now
(sitting up quickly) really want a cigarette
Do you have any
haven't had a cigarette since Laser was born
Do you smoke
Sometimes
But  don't have any here
Want me to run to the store
(bouncing off the walls) Yeah
Wait, no
Don't
Sorry
Jules pops up on her knees, getting in his face
(') Do you think 'm just like some sad- sack middle-aged lesbian
God, that's it
was trying to figure out how to describe you to my friends
Thank you
Jules punches his arm, mock hurt
They start rough-housing
Then kissing
Then the phone rings
You want to get that
No
want to get this

Paul grabs a handful of Jules' ass
Jules throws her leg over Paul and climbs up for another round
Suddenly, Joni's voice echoes through the machine
( ) Hi Paul
It's Joni
just wanted to apologize for my friend, Sasha
was really embarrassed when she put her hand on your-- Paul grabs the receiver
Hey, Joni
'm here
Jules visibly recoils
(') Listen, don't worry about your friend
Jules pales
She mouths: "What are you doing
"    Paul gesticulates: "'m sorry
" (') No
Honestly
didn't even notice
Jules throws on her clothes and starts to leave
(') Hey, Joni
Can you hold on a second
Paul grabs Jules' wrist and mouths "wait
"   Jules rips her arm free and walks out

Did you go to Home Depot
Yeah
just got back
That was fast
70
Yeah, no lines
His look of confusion trips off her paranoia
She's convinced he knows everything
What's that look
What look
The look you're giving me right now
That's no look
That just my face
Look, 'm not gonna play this game with you
You need to keep your judgements to yourself
Senora,  didn't give no looks
don't ask you why you keep blowing your nose constantly mean, if you have a drug problem that's your business
don't have no drug problem
have the allergies
Then why are you a gardener
Luis stares at Jules, innocent
Cause  love the flowers
Look, this isn't gonna work
'll pay you through the end of the day and then we're done
Jules walks past a totally confused Luis

Nic shuffles to get to close to her
Jules moves away, still pissed at her
Nic realizes she needs to make amends

Nic looks around the table, feeling like a pariah
Look,  know you've all been enjoying your time with Paul
And know  haven't been as open to him as everyone else and this has caused some
friction
between us
But 'd like to try and change that
Everyone keeps eating, uncommitted
"And
" (') So  was thinking
Maybe it would be nice if we all had dinner at his house sometime
That way,  could get to know him a little better, and  could see all the good work mom's been doing with his backyard
Nic looks at Jules and smiles
Everyone nods
They recognize this is a big step for Nic
86                                                                   86 '  -  - 88                                                                   88 Paul walks out to check on Jules
She's sweating her ass off, shlepping stacks of heavy mulch across the yard
How's it going
Okay
72
Here, let me help
Paul takes some of her load and together they transport the sod to the other side of the yard
Neither know what to say
Paul stares at her, waiting for her lead
We can't be doing this
know
'm married
and the kids
Yeah, and  love Nic

They stare at each other and we cut to

Jules looks nauseated
Paul offers her a pack of smokes
got you some cigarettes
(ignoring him) Jesus, what's wrong with me shouldn't have fired Luis like that
That was totally wrong
Come on
Don't be so hard on yourself
Things get messy sometimes
That wasn't messy
That was fucked up
'm totally fucked up

She flops on the couch next to him
He doesn't look up
Pretty good night
That table had like 5 bottles of wine
Wow
Yeah
Good night
Joni's pretty
She's got some of your genes
think she looks more like her mom actually
But thank you
It's cute seeing you in dad mode
Yeah
Yeah
(lowering voice) It makes me want to fuck you
(uncomfortable) Oh yeah
Yeah
Tanya moves imperceptibly closer
74
(') 've been missing our sleep-overs
Paul finally stops what he's doing
Yeah, it's been a while
You want to meet up later
Paul hesitates
He doesn't know how to say no
Tanya, you're so sexy and beautiful, but  don't think we should do that anymore
Tanya's face drops
What happened
You know, our thing is really fun and easy, but
don't want to be 50 and still "hanging out
" You know
If  really want a family then  have to stop getting in these situations that don't go anywhere
Paul just looks at her
Tanya gets it
(welling up) Oh
Paul knows enough to say nothing
Tanya gets up and walks off

Paul sits there, feeling like an asshole

Both kids seem really jazzed to be cooking with him
- Jules tours Nic around the backyard, looking a little freaked out as she shows her the work she's been doing
'm gonna do some planting over there so it won't look so bare
It looks great, honey
Very indigenous
'm so proud of you
Nic kisses Jules spontaneously
Jules looks nauseous again
They head back up the stairs, toward Paul's house
(') Hey, so how's that guy Luis working out
Oh,  had to fire him
(surprised) Really
Yeah, he had a drug problem
Whoa
What kind of drugs
Blow,  think

Especially Nic, who's committed to redeeming herself
76
Hey Nic,  think you're gonna love this `98 Screaming Eagle
You know what,  think 'm gonna stick with water tonight
But thank you so much
The Allgoods look at Nic: this is a first
(') God, Paul, this steak is delicious
What's the seasoning
just mist it with a little truffle oil
Nic looks at Jules and smiles in full overcompensation mode
What a good idea
We should try that
Right, honey
(taken aback by Nic's cheerfulness) Mmm-hmmm
And it's done to perfection
So it's not too rare
No, it's perfect
Juicy
Tender
Exactly what rare's supposed to be
Good
lot of people in the restaurant order a steak rare and they freak out at the slightest sight of red
Ugh, isn't that annoying
That happens to me all the time when 'm grilling
77
Don't people know that rare means red
Right
It means bloody
Exactly
They should see what rare looks like in Argentina
The cow's practically still mooing
Laser chuckles at Paul's joke, then reigns it in
Joni tries to insert herself in the conversation
really want to go to Argentina
Buenos Aires is supposed to be-- (interrupting) So Paul,  was checking out your album collection over there
Quite the eclectic mix
Thanks
You don't meet too many straight guys who love Joni Mitchell
Joni glares at Nic: stop being such a Paul hog
Oh yeah, you a Joni Mitchell fan
(smug) Not really
We just named our daughter after her
Cool
Right on
What's your favorite Joni album
think  have to go with "Blue
" Nic raises her hand in a testify
78
(') Yeah
You too
They high-five across the table
Oh God,  probably spent half of high school in my room crying to that album
That record kills me
know, it never lets up, you got "River," "California
" " Case of You
" "All  Want
" Mmm
Nic pulls her hands to her chest, shuts her eyes
and starts to sing
(') am on a lonely road and  am traveling traveling, traveling, traveling/Looking for something, what can it be/Oh  hate you some, hate you some/ love you some Oh love you/when  forget about me
Jules, Paul and the kids watch, open-mouthed as Nic soldiers on, skipping ahead to another verse
(') want to talk to you/ want to shampoo you/ want to renew you again and again/Applause, applause/ Life is our cause/When  think of your kisses/My mind see-saws
Nic takes a breath
Just as Paul's about to say something, Nic resumes her unfortunate solo
(') Do you see/do you see/do you see how you hu-urt me baby/so  hurt you too/then we both get/soo-ooo- ooo blue
79
Nic stops, eyes still closed
She's connected to a part of herself she rarely lets herself visit
The moment is punctured by her smart-ass 15-year-old son
Don't quit your day job, mom
Hey
It's hard enough to open your heart in this world
Don't make it harder
You're right
(to Nic; contrite) 'm sorry, mom
Nic looks at Paul
Stunned
Then looks at Jules and points to Paul
like this guy
Paul looks at Joni
You didn't tell me you were named after Joni
It's just so dorky
don't really like to bring it up
think it's cool
(getting up) Hey Paul
Where's your bathroom
Just around there
On her way to the loo, Nic turns back to Paul
You know what

Something catches her eye
She lifts Paul's hairbrush from the shelf in front of her and examines it
She reaches into the bristles and pulls out
few strands of long red hair
Nic pales
Nic on her knees in Paul's shower, pulling a clump of tell- tale red hair from the drain
Nic skulks out of the bathroom
She looks out and b-lines for the bedroom
Nic pulling pillows off Paul's bed
Her look tells us she's found hair here as well
Nic sitting back down at the table
She looks drained
Nobody notices
The sound drops out
' : Paul and Jules talking comfortably
Joni and Laser chiming in, smiling, one big happy family
: Totally disconnected
Shell-shocked
She wants to scream but it feels like she's trapped in cement
Things slow way down
96                                                                 96 '  - 97                                                                 97 Nic and Jules perform their nightly ablutions
Jules is sonic-caring her teeth
81
(through the sonic buzz) Well, you and Paul seemed to get on like gang-busters
You're sleeping with him, aren't you
(freaked) What
Nic turns to her, eyes red with anger
Just be honest with me
Don't make me feel crazier than  feel right now
Where is this coming from
found your hair in his drain
(scrambling) What
was working
got dirty so  took a shower
Oh yeah
You take a nap, too
Jules pauses a second too long
The jig is up
'  - 98                                                             98 The truth has come out
Nic is so angry she's calm
Are you in love with him
No
What, are you straight now
No
It has nothing to do with that
() 82
(') (beat) 've just felt so cut off from you lately
Oh, right, so it's my fault
No
Who said anything about fault
Just listen to me
'm listening
What
just needed
What
To be fucked
No, appreciated
It's always what 'm not doing for you, isn't it
Well here's what don't to you
don't work out my issues by fucking other people
Nic starts heading for the door
Jules follows
He's not just "other people
" No, you had to go fuck our sperm donor
You couldn't have picked a more painful way to hurt me
Where are you going
need water
My mouth is dry
Nic opens the door
There's Joni and Laser, looking devastated
They've been listening to the whole thing
-   - 99                                                               99 Jules wakes up looking crusty from a rough night on the couch
She looks like she hasn't slept at all
83
'  - 100                                                             100 Jules enters and walks over to her sleeping son
She gently nudges him awake
Hey Laser
Honey
Laser turns over, semi-conscious
What
She sits down on his bed
Listen,  know you and Joni heard what's going on
just want you to know that what happened with Paul and me is over
There's nothing going on now
Okay
know you might need some time to process your feelings around this, but  just want you to know that 'm here for you if you want to talk about anything
(beat) Is there anything you want to talk about
(leave my room) Not really
(fighting the impulse to push it) Okay then
Go back to sleep
Jules pats her son and leaves
'  - 101                                                             101 Jules enters and touches Joni's shoulder
Joni
84
don't want to talk to you
Can we just-- said  don't want to talk to you
Okay
'm sorry
Jules slowly retreats to the door
-  - 102                                                               102 Jules drinks coffee at the table
Nic walks in, dressed for work
Jules looks at her, wanting to "process
" But Nic isn't in the mood
She grabs a banana from a bowl and walks out
Jules feels like a leper
103                                                               103 '  - 104                                                               104 We can tell Joni's been crying and downloading the whole thing to Sasha
How's Nic doing
She's a wreck
've never seen her like this before
Joni's cell rings
She gets off the bed, looks at the phone
It's a picture of Paul
Is it him
Joni nods gravely, answers
(cold) Hello
85
'  - 105                                                            105 Paul's walking through rows of swiss chard, cell phone to his ear
Conversation Intercut
Hey Joni, how you doing
You're such a phony
Beat
Excuse me
You act like you're so groovy and together but you're not
You're a shitty person
What happened
With my mom
Listen, can  just come and talk with you-- What's wrong with you
Joni
Don't call me anymore
Joni hangs up and start crying
Sasha hugs her
'  - 106                                                            106 Sweaty, nauseous with remorse, Paul turns around to find fetching young Brooke, waiting for him with a wicker basket of huge cucumbers
Hey Paul, look at these cukes
86
Paul holds up his hand at her
This girl symbolizes every bad choice he's ever made
He gives her the universal, "Leave Me Alone" gesture
Brooke looks embarrassed
-  - 107                                                                 107 Jules sits on a lawn chair smoking a cigarette
Her cell rings
She answers
- 108                                                                 108 Paul walks down the street, wigging out
Hey, it's me
just talked to Joni
Conversation intercut
Oh my god, 'm so sorry
should have called you
Jules sucks a big, anxious drag off a cigarette
What happened
Nic saw my hair in your bathroom
The other night
Yeah
Fuck
Yeah
Beat
Listen, it's all out in the open now
Let's make this happen
87
Paul
No, 'm serious
Fuck it
Let's get the kids together and do this thing
Paul, come on
No
'm sick of this life
want a family
'm ready-- (eye rolling) Jesus, Paul
'm gay
Jules tosses the phone away from her
-  - 109                                                               109 Joni and Sasha stand at the makeshift "bar"
Joni's downs several Tequila shots quickly
Slow down, tiger
Across the room, Joni spots Jai chatting with a   in a sundress
Joni drops one more Tequila shot and walks up to Jai and Waify girl, interrupting them
like the scruff
It's sexy
Waify girl juts out her hip territorially
Uh, `scuuuse me
You're excused
(then back to Jai) Hey, can  talk to you
Joni leads Jai to a private corner
88
She leans in and kisses Jai
And Jai actually returns the kiss
And it's completely sweet and intimate
But then the kiss starts to morph as Joni's energy turns manic, intense, less romantic than emotionally needy
We see Jai start to pull away
But Joni keeps holding him, wanting more
Finally, Jai breaks off the kiss
Joni
Joni
What
Joni looks pained, embarrassed
Jai keeps holding her hands
Are you okay
Yeah, 'm fine
Joni pulls free and escapes, leaving a confused Jai in her wake
- 110                                                                110 Jules walks in to find Nic, awake, in bed
Just getting another pillow
The couch is kind of saggy
Is your back okay
Jules perks up: is this an invitation to share the bed again
It's a little ache-y
You should take some Advil
Guess not
Suddenly they hear bumping and loud footsteps downstairs
89
-   - 111                                                               111 Jules walks downstairs to find Joni stumbling toward her bedroom
Hey
How was the party
Joni tries to avert her mom's questioning gaze
Fine
How big was it
don't know
Medium
ish
Jules takes in the glassy look in her daughter's eyes
Are you drunk
No
Nic enters from the stairs, having caught the last piece
hope you had a designated driver
Why
'm not drunk
Well, you seem drunk to me
Yeah, well, you should know
(furious; incredulous) What did you just say to me
'm going to bed
Joni starts to leave
Nic grabs her
No, you're not
'm not done talking to you
90
Laser opens his door and watches the scene progress
What do you want from me
did everything you wanted
got all 's
got in everywhere  applied
Now you can show everybody what a perfect family you have
Don't talk to your mom like that
Joni spins to face Jules
You're really gonna tell me how to act
Now
Hey, 'm still your mother
Whatever
Jules reaches out and Joni backs away, sickened
(') Don't touch me
Joni heads for her room
(') 'm so sick of both of you
-  - 112                                                              112 The sun rises on this formerly happy home

Sits up
Rubs her aching back
- '  - 114                                                              114 Joni packs for college
The room is littered with half- filled packing boxes
She picks up a pile of clothes from the corner and sees the farmer's hat Paul gave her
She puts it aside, not sure what to do with it
91
'  - 115                                                               115 Paul looks around his newly landscaped yard
It looks more abandoned than revived
- 116                                                               116 The family has their last supper - before Joni leaves
Did you pack that lamp  gave you
Yeah
Well, we can always get stuff up there, too, if you need it,  mean if the room's dark or you need extra bedding
'm not going to Siberia, mom
Jules looks at the family unit, misty
can't believe this is our last dinner together
Oh God, are you gonna cry
Jules looks at her son, fed up
wish you were gay
You'd be so much more sensitive
The doorbell rings
It's probably Sasha
'll get it
Joni runs to the door
Opens it
It's not Sasha
It's Paul
(') (shocked) What are you doing here
92
needed to talk to you before you left
There's nothing to talk about
just want to apologize again for what happened
can't tell you how much  regret it
- 117                                                              117 Joni walks out for privacy, closes the door behind her
So like, everything that happened between us
What was that
Was that just bullshit
No, it wasn't bullshit at all know  don't seem credible right now but  really care about you
Paul struggles to keep his emotions in check
(') and  just hope someday we'll be able to see each other again
Do you think that could maybe happen
don't know
Joni looks down welling up
(') just wish you could've been
What
Joni chokes back tears
Better
Paul and Joni look up at each other when the door suddenly flings open
Nic is there, fuming
93
You've got some balls, mister
Nic, hold on
Nic walks toward he and Joni
Joni ducks back inside
No, you hold on
Let me tell you something, you really hurt my kids
Well, they're kinda my
(cutting him off) No
They're not
This is not your family
This is my family
You're just a fucking interloper
Jules joins Nic, concerned things are getting out of hand
didn't mean to hurt anyone
Paul and Jules share a look as Nic deals the coup de grace
If you want a family so much, go out and make one of your own
Nic heads back inside and slams the door behind her
Paul stand alone, spinning
After a moment he spontaneously looks back into the house
Laser is staring at him through the window
Their eyes lock and Paul give Laser a contrite smile
That's the final straw for Laser
He grabs his plate and walks out of view
Reeling, Paul heads for his motorcycle
He gets on the bike, helmet in hand
Turns on the ignition
He picks up the helmet and pauses, shaking in the hell of his own making
Losing it, he hurls the helmet at the motorcycle

need to say something
94
Everyone sits up
Jules acts stoic but she's wrecked
(') Look, it's no big secret your mom and are in hell right now
Bottom line
marriage is hard
really fucking hard
Just two people, slogging through the shit, year after year, getting older, changing
It's a fucking marathon, okay
Everyone is silenced by the outpouring
Jules soldiers on
(') So sometimes you're together so long, you just stop seeing the other person
You just see weird projections of your own junk
And instead of talking to each other, you go off the rails, and act grubby and make stupid choices
Which is what  did
And  feel sick about it because  love you guys and  love your mom and that's the truth
Sometimes you hurt the ones you love the most
don't know why
Maybe if  read more Russian novels  would
Nic looks down, overwhelmed by it all
(') Anyway,  just wanted to say how sorry  am about what  did and that  hope you'll forgive me eventually
(awkward) Thank you
And, without further ado, Jules hands the remote back to Laser and departs the field
Everyone's silenced by Jules' rambling apologia, especially Nic
119                                                              119 '  - 120                                                              120 Joni wakes up
She looks around her room
There's nothing on the walls
The floor is covered with boxes taped and labeled
It's time to go

Laser and Joni bring the last of the boxes out of the house

She takes it all in, nervous, excited
Nic and Jules steal looks back at Joni, feeling her nervousness, wishing they could take it away
- 126                                                               126 The Allgoods pull up to the curb, get out
Laser piles Joni's boxes on his skateboard

- Nic and Jules follow Joni to the door
They all jam up at the threshold
Guys, it's okay
got it
Nic and Jules get the hint
They move back and Joni enters the room alone
Nic and Jules quietly turn and leave

She goes into her suitcase and pulls out her linens
She starts making her bed but suddenly stops mid way
She stares out toward the hallway
Finally she moves to the doorway and looks out
She realizes her family isn't there
- 129                                                              129 Joni exits, looking around to find her family
The station wagon is gone
She looks panicked
Her pace quickens as she makes her way down a hill toward the road
Finally Joni sees the Volvo heading towards her
The car pulls over to the curb and everyone gets out
Joni looks vulnerable
She tries to cover it
Where'd you go
We had to move the car
thought you left
We wouldn't leave without saying goodbye
Give us some credit
And suddenly, everyone realizes
this is it
It's time to say goodbye
First Laser comes up and hugs Joni
It's gonna be weird not having you at home
Sorry to leave you alone with them
It's okay
can handle it
Laser backs up
Then the moms both come up and hug Joni, tears streaming down their faces
97
Guys, come on
(beat) Look, 'll talk to you soon
Joni tries to detach from the hug
But her moms won't let go
They keep holding her and crying
Slowly, their tears begin to break Joni down
Trapped in their loving embrace, Joni's feelings rise up, unbidden, overpowering her
She starts crying
The moms hold her tighter, which makes her cry even harder
Soon she's sobbing in her mothers' arms, as all the pressure, resentment and anger she's felt starts seeping out of her
Nic and Jules feel their daughter letting go
They hold her tight to comfort her
They keep holding her until a calm sets in
The hug breaks apart
Nic pushes the hair from Joni's face
Joni gives her moms one last smile
Laser, Jules and Nic get back in the car
Joni stands watching as they drive off and her new life begins
- 130                                                               130 The family drives home
Jules is at the wheel
Nic's in the passenger seat, eyes red and puffy
Laser's in the back
No one speaks, everyone's lost in their own worlds
Finally Laser breaks the spell
don't think you guys should break up
long beat
No
Why's that
think you're too old
Both Nic and Jules crack smiles
Their son's rudeness is unsurpassed
But then his words have an unexpected gravity
98
Thanks, Laser
Jules, disarmed and slightly smiling, reaches over and puts her hand on Nic's leg
She gives it a gentle squeeze and doesn't let go
Nic looks over to Jules, finally disarmed
Nic reaches for Jules' hand and holds it tight
Nic and Jules look at each other, and then away
Laser watches his moms holding hands from the back seat
Their small gesture is what he needed
He smiles to himself, grateful for a sign
