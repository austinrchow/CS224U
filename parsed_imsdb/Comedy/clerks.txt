snapshot of a girl is stuck in the corner, and a bra weighs one end down
sits quietly atop a bundle of laundry
It suddenly explodes with a resounding ring-once, twice, three times swings open, and a half-clad figure falls out rings yet again, and a hand falls upon the receiver, yanking it off the trash can,
lays with his back to the camera, phone in hand

No,  don't work today

Because 'm fucking tired

The picture is decorated with a Play-Doh beard and mustache

Twelve
Twelve or walk

He musses his hair and stands
stands and wags its tail
hand pats its head
The Rumpled Figure lays down on the bed
We now see his face
It is the face of  and this is Dante's room; this is Dante's life
grabs the dog and wrestles it
Next time,  get the bed

He releases the dog and sits up
(exhausted) Shit
: : steaming shower fills the room
The dog licks water from the toilet
: : towel-dressed  opens the fridge and peers inside
He grabs a half-empty gallon of milk and closes the door
: : Chocolate milk mix is heaped into a tumbler
One scoop, two scoops, three scoops, four scoops
: : gulps his breakfast while feeling inside the closet for some clothes
Some chocolate milk spills on the floor
laps at the small puddle of chocolate milk

: The car pulls up, with a screech
Feet descend to the ground from the open door
Keys jam into a lock and pop it open
: lifts the metal shutter revealing the door
He opens it and grabs two bundles of papers, throwing them inside the store
: : very dark room barely lit by the daylight
Suddenly, the lights flick on, revealing the glorious interior of the convenience store
looks at  as he passes the camera quickly
is snapped open with a knife
Newspapers slam into the appropriate racks
One rack remains empty
coffee filter is placed in a metal pot
Ground coffee follows, and the mix is shoved into place in the coffeemaker
The switch is flicked and the machine comes to life
The empty newspaper rack with the heading seems out of place among all the other stacks of papers
rubs his chin and stares, puzzled
He rolls his eyes as it occurs to him
Shit
The register pops open, and a hand extracts a quarter
: : : Through murky glass and thin metal grating, we see approach
He stops and drops a quarter in the slot
He pulls the door down, finally allowing us a clear view as he reaches toward the camera
pulls a stack of newspapers from the Asbury Park Press vending machine
He struggles to hold them all in one hand as he lets the door slam shut
He turns to walk away, but the sound of the quarter dropping into the change slot stops him
He takes a step back to grab the coin

: The papers drop into the once-empty rack with a resounding flop
The quarter drops back into the register drawer

He looks down at it
Shit
The lock is gummed up with gum or something hard and obtrusive like gum, preventing the key from being inserted
looks around and kicks the shutter angrily
The car trunk pops open and a hand reaches inside, pulling out a folded white sheet

dips his fingers into the shoe polish and writes large letters on the unfurled sheet, leaning on the cooler

The door sign shifts from  to : : The clock reads 6:20

He stares ahead, catatonic, then drops his head in his hands
The day has begun

: waits on a customer () buying coffee
Thanks
Have a good one
Do you mind if  drink this here
Sure
Go ahead
The  leans on a briefcase and drinks his coffee
Another  leans in the door
Are you open
Yeah
Pack of cigarettes
Are you sure
Am  sure
Are you sure
Am  sure about what
Do you really want to buy those cigarettes
Are you serious
How long have you been smoking
(to ) What is this, a poll
Beats me
6
How long have you been a smoker
Since  was thirteen
The  lifts his briefcase onto the counter
He opens it and extracts a sickly-looking lung model
'd say you're about nineteen, twenty, am  right
What the hell is that
That's your lung
By this time, your lung looks like this
You're shittin' me
You think 'm shitting you
The  hands him something from the briefcase
What's this
It's a trach ring
It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box
This one came out of a sixty-year-old man
(drops ring) Unnhh
(picks up the ring) He smoked until the day he died
Used to put the cigarette in this thing and smoke it that way
Excuse me, but
7
This is where you're heading cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat
Do you really want that
Well, if it's already too late
It's never too late
Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead
(grabs nearby pack, reads) Here
Chewlies Gum
Try this
It's not the same
It's cheaper than cigarettes
And it certainly beats this
Hands him a picture
Jesus
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung
Keep it
(to ) 'll just take the gum
Fifty-five
You've made a wise choice
Keep up the good work
The  exits
Maybe you should take that coffee outside
No,  think 'll drink it in here, thanks
8
If you're going to drink it in here, 'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers
Okay
'm sorry about that
Another  comes up to the counter
Pack of cigarettes
(looks at model) What's that
This
How long have you been smoking
: : blank wall
steps into the frame, followed by pulls off his coat and swings it into the arms of then throws down with a makeshift slam dance, spinning his arm and fake-hitting
lights a smoke
feel good today, Silent Bob
We're gonna make some money
And then you know what we're going to do
We're going to go to that party and get some pussy
'm gonna fuck this bitch, that bitch
(Blue Velvet Hopper) '
points to something off-screen
(to
) What you looking at
'll kick your fucking ass
(to  ) Doesn't that motherfucker still owe me ten bucks
nods
9
Tonight, you and me are going off that fucker's head, and take out his fucking soul
Remind me if he tries to buy something from us, to cut it with leafs and twigs
or fucking shit in the motherfucker's bag
Some girls walk past
smiles at them
Wa sup sluts
(to  ) Damn Silent Bob
You one rude motherfucker
But you're cute as hell
(slowly drops to knees) wanna go down on you, and suckle you
(makes blow job neck-jerks) And then,  wanna line up three more guys, and make like a circus seal
makes blow job faces down an imaginary line of guys, looking quite like a performing seal
He throws a little humming sound behind each nod
He then hops up quickly
Ewwww
You fucking faggot fucking hate guys
(yelling) (calmer) Neh
comes up to them
You selling
(all business) got hits, hash, weed, and later on 'll have 'shrooms
We take cash, or stolen MasterCard and Visa
: : gathers around the  as he orates
It has become something of a rally
10
You're spending what
Twenty, thirty dollars a week on cigarettes
1 Forty
2 Fifty-three
Fifty-three dollars
Would you pay someone that much money every week to kill you
Because that's what you're doing now, by paying for the so-called privilege to smoke
3 We all gotta go sometime
It's that kind of mentality that allows this cancer-producing industry to thrive
Of course we're all going to die someday, but do we have to pay for it
Do we have to actually throw hard-earned dollars on a counter and say, "Please, please, Mister Merchant of Death, sir; please sell me something that will give me bad breath, stink up my clothes, and fry my lungs
" 1 It's not that easy to quit
Of course it's not; not when you have people like this mindless cretin so happy and willing to sell you nails for your coffin
Hey, now wait a sec
Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders
() 11
(') Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth
just like cigarettes are doing now
Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties
He doesn't care how many people die from it
He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day
" think you'd better leave now
You want me to leave
Why
Because somebody is telling it like it is
Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call
You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance
You're the disturbance, pal
And here
(slaps a dollar on the counter) 'm buying some
what's this
Chewlie's Gum
There
'm no longer loitering
'm a customer, a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers
2 (to ) Yeah, now shut up so he can speak
Oh, he's scared now
He sees the threat we present
He smells the changes coming, and the loss of sales when the nonsmokers finally demand satisfaction
We demand the right to breathe cleaner air
12
3 Yeah
We'd rather chew our gum than embrace slow death
Let's abolish this heinous practice of sucking poison, and if it means ruffling the feathers of a convenience store idiot, then so be it
That's it, everybody out
We're not moving
We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard
Yeah, but not in here
What better place than this
To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source
Like 'm responsible for all the smokers
The ones in this town, yes
You encourage their growth, their habit
You're the source in this area, and we're going to shut you down for good
For good, cancer-merchant
The small crowd begins to chant and jeer in 's face
Cancer merchant
Cancer merchant
Cancer merchant
enters and surveys the mess
The  throws cigarettes at , pelting him in the face
Suddenly, a loud blast is heard, and white powder explodes over the throng
Everyone turns to face
as she stands in one of the freezer cases, holding a fire extinguisher
Who's leading this mob
13
The  looks among themselves
Someone points to
That guy
The  carries his briefcase surreptitiously toward the door
(
) Freeze
jumps off the freezer case, training the nozzle of the extinguisher on the
Let's see some credentials
He reaches into his briefcase
She pokes the extinguisher nozzle at him, warningly
Slowly
He pulls out a business card and hands it to her
She reads it
You're a Chewlie's Gum representative
He nods
And you're stirring up all this antismoking sentiment to
what
sell more gum
He nods again
(through gritted teeth) Get out of here
He quickly flees
She blasts him with more chemical as he exits
(to the crowd) And you people: Don't you have jobs to go to
Get out of here and go commute
The  sheepishly exits, one by one, offering apologetic glances
tries to regain his composure
14
watches the crowd disperse, disgusted
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves
Easily led automatons
Try thinking for yourself before you pelt and innocent man with cigarettes
The last of the crowd exits
sets the fire extinguisher down next to
is sitting on the floor, head in his folded arms
It looked like Tiananmen Square in here for a second
is silent
"Thank you, Veronica; you saved me from an extremely ugly mob scene
" remains silent
(sits beside him) Okay, champ
What's wrong
lifts his head and shoots her a disgusted look
All right, stupid question
But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard
Too hard
don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me
At least they weren't lit
hate this fucking place
Then quit
You should be going to school anyway
Please, Veronica
Last thing  need is a lecture at this point
15
All 'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave
'm not even supposed to be here today
know
stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something
The guy got sick and couldn't come in
Don't you have a hockey game at two
Yes
And 'm going to play like shit because  didn't get a good night's sleep
Why did you agree to come in then
'm only here until twelve, then 'm gone
The boss is coming in
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here
Somebody jammed the locks with gum
You're kidding
Bunch of savages in this town
You look bushed
What time did you get to bed
don't know-like two-thirty, three
What were you doing up so late
16
(skirting) Hunhh
Nothing
(persistent) What were you doing
Nothing
Jesus
gotta fight with you now
Who's fighting
Why are you so defensive
Who's defensive
Just
Would you just hug me
All right
Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged
She stares at him
What
What is that
She called you, didn't she
Oh, be real
Would you
Would you please hug me
just went through a very traumatic experience and haven't been having the best day so far
Now come on
stares at him
What
What's with that look wasn't talking to anyone, especially her
Look at you, being all sort of
don't know
stand-offish
looks away
Fine
You don't trust me, don't hug me
see how it is
All right Pissy-pants, you just go on being suspicious and quiet
don't even want to hug you at this point
17
looks back at him
(pleadingly) Give you a dollar
: : on the counter next to a small pile of money reads: and  are slumped on the floor, behind the counter
holds  in her arms, his head on her chest
Change is heard hitting the counter
(to
customer) Thanks
The door is heard opening and closing-a customer leaving
How much money did you leave up there
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles
People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning
You're trusting
Why do you say that
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change
Or even paying for what they take
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched
Honesty through paranoia
Why do you smell like shoe polish
18
had to use shoe polish to make that sign
The smell won't come off
Do you think anyone can see us down here
Why
You wanna have sex or something
(sarcastic) Ooh
Can we
Really
was kidding
Yeah, right
You can't get enough of me
Typically male point of view
How do you figure
You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods
What about what we do for you
Women
Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there
"Be there
" Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat
How flattering
19
Now, making a woman cum
therein lies a challenge
Oh, you think so
girl makes a guy cum, it's standard
guy makes a girl cum, it's talent
And  actually date you
Something wrong
'm insulted
Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off
Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough
touched a nerve
'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life
It wasn't directed at you
was making a broad generalization
You were making a generalization about "broads
" These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me
How many
How many what
How many girls have you slept with
20
How many different girls
Didn't we already have this discussion once
We might have;  don't remember
How many
Including you
It better be up to and including me
(pause to count) Twelve
You've slept with twelve different girls
Including you; yes
Pause
She slaps him
What the hell was that for
You're a pig
Why'd you hit me
Do you know how many different men 've had sex with
Do  get to hit you after you tell me
Three
Three
Three including you
21
You've only had sex with three different people
'm not the pig you are
Who
You
No; who were the three, besides me
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk
(with true admiration) Wow
That's great
That's something to be proud of
am
And that's why you should feel like a pig
You men make me sick
You'll sleep with anything that says yes
Animal, vegetable, or mineral
Vegetable meaning paraplegic
They put up the least amount of struggle
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me
Big
All right
Name it
want you to come with me on Monday
Where
22
To school
There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment
Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up
It's important to me, Dante
You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit
wish you'd go back to school
Jesus, would you stop
You make my head hurt when you talk about this
stands, letting ' head hit the floor
Shit
Why are we getting up
Unlike you,  have a class in forty-five minutes
handsome young man () is standing at the counter
reacts to him
(surprised) Willam
Ronnie
How are you
You work here now
(locks arms with ) No, 'm just visiting my man
(to ) Dante, this is Willam Black
(to ) This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend
How are you
Just the soda
And a pack of cigarettes
(to ; paying) Are you still going to Seton Hall
23
No,  transferred into Monmouth this year
was tired of missing him
(squeezes ' arm) Do you still talk to Sylvan
just talked to her on Monday
We still hang out on weekends
(leaving) That's cool
Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right
will
Take it easy
Bye
(exits) Bye (to ) That was Snowball
Why do you call him that
Sylvan made it up
It's a blow job thing
What do you mean
After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing
It's called snowballing
He requested this
He gets off on it
24
Sylvan can be talked into anything
Why do you say that
Like you said-she snowballed him
Sylvan
No;  snowballed him
Yeah, right
'm serious
moment of silence as ' chuckles fade to comprehension
You sucked that guy's dick
Yeah
How do you think  know he liked
(panicky) But
but you said you only had sex with three guys
You never mentioned him
That's because  never had sex with him
You sucked his dick
We went out a few times
We didn't have sex, but we fooled around
(massive panic attack) Oh my God
Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys
Because  did only sleep with three guys
That doesn't mean  didn't just go with people
25
Oh my God- feel so nauseous
'm sorry, Dante
thought you understood
did understand
understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said
Please calm down
How many
Dante
How many dicks have you sucked
Let it go
All right
Shut up a second and 'll tell you
Jesus
didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked
This is different
This is important
How many
She counts silently, using fingers as marks
waits on a customer in the interim
stops counting
Well
(half-mumbled) Something like thirty-six
-
26
Lower your voice
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six
" Does that include me
Um
Thirty-seven
' -
(walking away) 'm going to class
Thirty-seven
(to ) My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks
In a row
chases  down and grabs her by the door
Hey
Where are you going
Hey listen, jerk
Until today you never even knew how many guys 'd slept with, because you never even asked
And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls
Well,  never had sex with twelve different guys
No, but you sucked enough dick
Yeah,  went down on a few guys
few
27
And one of those guys was you
The last one,  might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that 've been faithful to you since we met
All the other guys  went with before  met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead
But don't look at me like 'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me
(a bit more rational) Well
why did you have to suck their dicks
Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person
Because going down it's a big deal
used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later 'd go down on him
But  only had sex with the guys  loved
feel sick
(holds him) love you
Don't feel sick
Every time  kiss you now 'm going to taste thirty-six other guys
violently lets go of him
'm going to school
Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational
(pause) Thirty-seven
just can't
Goodbye, Dante
She exits in a huff
stands there in silence for a moment
Then he swings the door open and yells out
28
Try not to suck any more dicks on your way through the parking lot
Two men who were walking in the opposite direction outside double back and head in the direction
went
,
: : videocassette encased in the customary black box flips repeatedly, held by an impatient grasp
The glares at
Dante studies a copy of Paradise Lost, making a strong attempt at not noticing the glare
(pissed off) thought that place was supposed to be opened at eleven o'clock
It's twenty after
called his house twice already
He should be here soon
It's not like it's a demanding job
'd like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch
The other day walked in there and that sonofabitch was sleeping
'm sure he wasn't sleeping
You calling me a liar
No; he was probably just resting his eyes
What the hell is that
Resting his eyes
It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller
Actually, that's his night job
29
Such a wiseass
But go ahead
Crack wise
That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work
(tosses tape on counter) got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch
You make sure this gets back
The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski
And wanted to get a damn movie, too
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, 'll have him hold it for you
(storming out) Don't hurt yourself
'm going to Big Choice Video instead
He storms out
Dante lifts a ring of keys from the counter
(in a whisper) You forgot your keys
The half-filled trash can swallows the ring of keys
: : Another -  leans against the video store door
hapless  drifts by and stops
He glances at the door, peers inside, and gives the door a tug
The guy ain't here yet
You're kidding
It's almost eleven- thirty
know
've been here since eleven
(kicks the door) Man
hate it when  can't rent videos
30
would've went to Big Choice, but the tape  want is right there on the wall
Which one
Dental School
You came for that too
That's the movie  came for
have first dibs
Says who
(suddenly snotty) Says me
've been here for half an hour
'd call that first dibs
Ain't gonna happen, my friend
'm getting that tape
Like hell you are
'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape
Twenty bucks
Twenty bucks
All right, asshole, you're on
walks away
The    stands like a sentry at post
The   storms up
You see a pair of keys lying around here somewhere
: 31
: dances in, attempting a soft-shoe routine
He sees and stops dead, midshuffle
You're late
What the hell are you doing here thought you were playing hockey at one
The boss called
Arthur fell ill
Why are the shutters closed
Someone jammed gum in the locks
Bunch of savages in this town
That's what  said
Shit, if 'd known you were working, would've come even later
pile of videocassettes is plopped onto the counter, with a single key on top
balances the pile of tapes on his head
What time do you have to stay till
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve
What smells like shoe polish
Go open the sore
: : The   stops
32
Hey-did you see a set of keys lying around here
(as Short-round) No time for love, Doctor Jones
marches off
The   stares after him
Fucking kids
The    now sits on the ground, next to the video store door
balances his burden and shoves the key into the lock
The    stares as enters the store
The door closes behind him, only to be held ajar in a gentlemanly fashion a few moments later
smiles
: : coffee filter is shoved into the metal pan and someone heaps ground coffee on it
We've seen this same routine before
crosses back to his post, as  enters, tossing the key into the air happily and catching it
He picks the cat up
Some guy just came in refusing to pay late fees
He said the store was closed for two hours yesterday
tore up his membership
Shocking abuse of authority
'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since  rule
(furtively) Is the Pelican flying
Don't screw with it
It makes us look suspicious
can't stand a voyeur
'll be back
33
heads toward the walk-in door
: : : far-away wall is the only thing we see, but mild gruntings give away an ascension of sorts
' head rises into view, as if he's climbing a ladder
He stops and looks into the lens
: The  is a  that's hooked up to a surveillance camera
It records quickly
hand reaches into the frame and shuts it off
: : pulls a soda from the cooler
Want something to drink
'm buying
(
) No, thanks
Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty
was trying to call for a half an hour
(
) Why
wanted to use your car
He walks by a row of snacks and grabs one without looking at it
Snake cake
sits in his seat behind the register
grabs a paper and joins him behind the counter
You don't want to know
34
You called Caitlin again
She called me
Did you tell Veronica
One fight a day with Veronica is about all  can stomach, thanks
What do you two fight about
guess it's not really fighting
She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction
(opening paper) 'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree
You win
'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past
Forget Caitlin Bree
You've been with Veronica for how long now
Seven months
Chick's nuts about you
How long did you date Caitlin
Five years
Chick only made you nuts
She cheated on you how many times
Eight and a half
35
(looks up from paper) Eight and a half
Party at John 's-senior year get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom
Caitlin comes in and dives all over me
That's cheating
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad
She called you Brad
She called me Brad
That's not cheating
People say crazy shit during sex
One time, called this girl "Mom
" hit the lights and she freaks
Turns out she thought  was Brad Michaelson
What do you mean
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom
She picked the wrong one
She had no idea was even at the party
Oh, my God
Great story, isn't it
That girl was vile to you
36
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom
Your mother
Allan Harris
Chess team Allan Harris
The two moved to Idaho together after graduation
They raise sheep
That's frightening
It takes different strokes to move the world
In light of this lurid tale, don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles
Because there was a lot of good in our relationship
Oh yeah
'm serious
Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple
That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity
You think things would be any different now
37
They are
When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable
She's about to finish college and enter the real world
That's got to be scary for anyone
(suddenly recalling) Oh shit, 've got to place an order
'm talking to myself here
No, no, 'm listening
She's leaving college, and
and she's looking to me for support
And  think that this is leading our relationship to a new level
What about Veronica
think the arguments Veronica and are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that  can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin
Caitlin's on the same wave-length
think it's safe to say yes
Then  think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over
All four
You, Veronica, Caitlin

of the engagement announcement reads, : : dials the phone
He holds a list in his hand

Happy Scrappy

(on phone) And a copy of Happy Scrappy-The Hero Pup
Okay, thanks
(hangs up; to ) Sixteen forty-nine
It'll be here Monday
Silence
Then
Cunt
: : carries a litter box to be dumped
He pauses midstrike and lays it on the ice cream chest
picks up the phone and looks at the paper
He dials and waits
40
Yes, 'd like to check on a misprint in today's edition
Today's edition
It says "Bree to Wed Asian Design Major
No, no; everything's spelled fine
just wanted to know if the piece was a misprint
don't know, like a typographical error or something
comes to the counter and waits
He looks at the litter box
black cat suddenly jumps into it and starts pawing around
(
) Maybe it's supposed to be Caitlin Bray, or Caitlin Bre, with one e
'm a curious party
curious party
on the phone: 'm an ex-boyfriend
Well, it's just that we talk all the time, and she never mentioned this engagement, which is why 'm thinking maybe it's a misprint
The  watches as the cat takes a huge dump, leaning on its haunches to accommodate the stinky load
(
) Are you sure
Maybe there's like a vindictive printer working for you
on the phone: Meaning like someone who maybe- don't know-asked her out once and got shot down, and his revenge is throwing this bogus article in when the paper went to press
Hello
Hello
hangs up
He looks at the paper ruefully, shaking his head
He then sniffs the air
: 41
: ,   and  lean against wall
"Not in me
" That's what she says
gotta pull out and spank it to get it on
So  blow a nut on her belly, and  get out of there, just as my uncle walks in
It was such a close call
tell you what, though,  don't care if she is my cousin, 'm gonna knock those boots again tonight
join them
Oh shit, look who it is
The human vacuum
1 Scumbag
What are you doing
Nothing
Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin
1 (to  ) He's your cousin
Check this out, he's from Russia
1 No way
swear to God
Silent Bob, am lying
shakes his head: See
And Silent Bob never told a lie in his life
2 What part of Russia
42
don't fucking know
What am , his biographer
(to ) Olaf, what part of Russia are you from
looks quizzically at
(in Russian) Home
(comprehending) Moscow
1 He only speaks Russian
He knows some English, but he can't not speak it good like we do
2 Is he staying here
He's moving to the big city next week
He wants to be a metal singer
1 No way
Swear
(to ) Olaf, metal
makes a metal face
That's his fucking metal face
(to ) Olaf, girls nice
looks the girls up and down
Skrelnick
(laughs) That's fucked up
43
1 What did he say
don't know, man
He's a fucking character
2 He really wants to play metal
He's got his own band in Moscow
It's called "Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans" or something like that
1 That doesn't sound metal
You gotta hear him sing
(to ) Olaf, "Berserker
" laughs and shakes his head
Come on, man, "Berserker
" 2 Does he sing in English or Russian
English
(to ) Come on, "Berserker
" Girls think sexy
(relents) Da
Da
He's gonna sing it
This is too funny
(in broken English) (laughing) That's fucking funny, man
44
1 Did he say "making fuck
" Wait, there's more
(to ) Olaf: sing
(makes pot-smoking face) (nods in understanding) busts a crimson metal sneer and cackles deeply
: : leans back in his chair, staring up at the
The theme to Star Wars plays
He stands, points the remote, clicks the  off, and ponders
: : locks the door and walks away, while  sings for the small crowd
: : is tugging at a can of Pringles potato chips
The can is stuck on a ' hand
You hold the counter and 'll pull
Usually  just turn the can upside down
45
(pulling) Maybe we should soap your hand or something
(straining) They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes
think it's coming now
The can pops off and  staggers back a few steps
The man rubs his hand
Thanks
thought  was gonna have to go to the hospital
'll throw this out
Precautionary measure
It stings a little
word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go
steps behind the counter
Thanks
The  exits as  enters
throws the canister away
Do you know that article is accurate
Caitlin's really getting married
You know what  just watched
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist
Return of the Jedi
46
Didn't you hear me
Caitlin really is getting married
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back
(exasperated) Empire
Blasphemy
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett
It ends on such a down note
And that's life-a series of down endings
All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets
There was something else going on in Jedi
never noticed it until today
follows  as he cleans up around the store
What's that
All right, Vader's boss
The Emperor
Right, the Emperor
Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes
How do you mean
Well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force
He's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one
47
guess
Now, he's in charge of the Empire
The Imperial government is under his control
And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule
Yeah
Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy
If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion
It would stand to reason, yes
Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution
More or less
The only problem is that at no point in the series did  ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief
think they were Catholics
-  half enters the door
- Are you open
Yeah
Come in
He goes to the coffee machine and makes a cup of joe
You know what else  noticed in Jedi
48
There's more
So they build another Death Star, right
Yeah
Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it
Luke blew it up
Give credit where it's due
And the second one was still being built when they blew it up
Compliments of Lando Calrissian
Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it
could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right
And you figured it out
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army-storm troopers, dignitaries- the only people onboard were Imperials
Basically
So when they blew it up, no prob
Evil is punished
And the second time around
49
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet
They were still under construction
So
construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer
'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers
Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at
Exactly
In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job
Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main
All they know is killing and white uniforms
All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction
All those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed- casualties of a war they had nothing to do with
(notices Dante's confusion) All right, look-you're a roofer, and some juicy government contract comes your way; you got the wife and kids and the two-story in suburbia-this is a government contract, which means all sorts of benefits
All of a sudden these left-wing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a three-mile radius
() 50
(') You didn't ask for that
You have no personal politics
You're just trying to scrape out a living
The -  joins them
- Excuse me
don't mean to interrupt, but what were you talking about
The ending of Return of the Jedi
My friend is trying to convince me that any contractors working on the uncompleted Death Star were innocent victims when the space station was destroyed by the rebels
- Well, 'm a contractor myself
'm a roofer
(digs into pocket and produces business card) Dunn and Reddy Home Improvements
And speaking as a roofer,  can say that a roofer's personal politics come heavily into play when choosing jobs
Like when
- Three months ago  was offered a job up in the hills
beautiful house with tons of property
It was a simple reshingling job, but  was told that if it was finished within a day, my price would be doubled
Then  realized whose house it was
Whose house was it
- Dominick Bambino's
"Babyface" Bambino
The gangster
51
- The same
The money was right, but the risk was too big
knew who he was, and based on that,  passed the job on to a friend of mine
Based on personal politics
- Right
And that week, the Foresci family put a hit on Babyface's house
My friend was shot and killed
He wasn't even finished shingling
No way
- (paying for coffee) 'm alive because  knew there were risks involved taking on that particular client
My friend wasn't so lucky
(pauses to reflect) You know, any contractor willing to work on that Death Star knew the risks
If they were killed, it was their own fault
roofer listens to this
(taps his heart) not his wallet
The -  exits
and  remain respectfully quiet for a moment
An angry  opens the door and pokes her head in
Is that video store open or not
: : reads a newspaper
An   studies the two rental choices she holds
She looks from one movie to the other repeatedly
(attempting a solicit help) They say so much, but they never tell you if it's any good
52
hardly stirs and continues to read his paper
The half turns to see if her comment was even heard
She tries again, but this time with a different approach
Are either of these any good
continues to read
The   tries harder, then louder and more direct: Sir
continues to read
(flatly) What
The   holds up her rental choices
(politely) Are either of these any good
, as always, reads on
(again, flatly) don't watch movies
The   is a tad flabbergasted, but not put off
Well, have you heard anything about either of them
does his level best to not get involved
(reading) No
The   challenges him
(in disbelief) You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie
53
(
) find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs
(with a new determination) Well, how about these two movies
(holds up the same two) continues to read his paper, not looking up
They suck
The   smirks smugly at  and his paper
She has caught him
just held up the same two movies
You're not even paying attention
No,  wasn't
don't think your manager would appreciate
(turning the page) don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am
beg your pardon
(reading on) Your ruse
Your cunning attempt to trick me
(defending herself) only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what  was saying
(turning page and reading) hope it feels good
You hope what feels good
54
hope it feels so good to be right
There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there
The   wears a face that belies utter disbelief in the audacity of this most lackadaisical video clerk
The unmoving newspaper illustrates the total disinterest of the news-hungry
The shakes her head in disgust and throws the movies back onto the wall
(in a huff) Well this is the last time  ever rent here
You'll be missed
(losing it altogether) Screw you
She storms out
is offended
He hops over the counter and whips the door open
(calling after her) You're not allowed to rent here anymore
closes the door and stands there, momentarily, totally appalled by her exiting remark, then shakes his head
Screw me
He reaches behind the counter and grabs a ring of keys
Exiting, he locks the door behind him from the outside, gives it a tug to ensure its security, and storms off in the opposite direction from the woman
: : is staring, open-mouthed, at something hurls the door open and immediately launches into his tirade
You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said
55
(a hand up to urge him to hush) Wait
(looking around) She's in here
This guy is going through all of the eggs
Look
An   sits on the floor, surrounded by cartons of eggs, all opened
He grabs a carton from the cooler case, pops it open, and examines each egg carefully
(
) This has been going on for twenty minutes
and  study the
oddity
What's he looking for
He said he has to find a perfect dozen
Perfect dozen
Each egg has to be perfect
The quest isn't going well
Obviously not
Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade
The   holds an egg up to the light and studies it from several different angles
(
) Why doesn't he just mix and match
told him that and he yelled at me
snickers at his friend
56
What did he say
He said it was important to have standards
He said nobody has pride anymore
It's not like you laid the eggs yourself
'll give him five more minutes then 'm calling the cops
don't need this, man
'm not even supposed to be here today
steps in
Two packs of cigarettes
Dante manages to break his study of the
oddity and searches for the smokes
The smoker glances at  and then at the
oddity
The   is spinning an egg on the floor
The looks at
(still staring at the ) 'm as puzzled as you
(paying ) 've actually seen it before
You know him
No, 've seen that behavior before
Looking for the perfect carton of eggs, right
(a bit astonished) Yeah
How'd you know
'll bet you a million bucks that the guy's a guidance counselor
57
Why do you say that
was in the Food City last year when the same thing happened, different guy though
Stock boy told me that the guy had been looking through the eggs for like half an hour, doing all sorts of endurance tests and shit
ask the kid how come nobody called the manager, and he says it happens twice a week, sometimes more
Get out of here
kid you not
They call it Shell Shock
Only happens with guidance counselors for some reason
The kid said they used to make a big deal about it, but there's no point
The   places a handkerchief over an egg on the floor
He quickly whisks the handkerchief away to reveal the egg still sitting on the floor
(
) He said they always pay for whatever they break and they never bother anybody
,  and the  stare at the
man
Why guidance counselors
If your job served as little purpose as theirs, wouldn't you lose it, too
Come to think of it, my guidance counselor was kind of worthless
(grabbing matches) See
It's important to have a job that makes a difference, boys
That's why  kill Chinamen for the railroad
: 58
: : And then a   comes into view, smiling and holding money
She can't be any more than five
(innocently) Can  have a pack of cigarettes
, without looking up from his magazine, completes the transaction
puts a cigarette in her mouth
hands her matches
returns to the counter as the girl skips away
Dante holds a price gun
Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine
Damn, that's eerie
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour
What's a jizz-mopper
He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off
Nudie booth
Nudie booth
You've never been in a nudie booth
guess not
female  pops items onto the counter
rings her up
Oh, it's great
You step into this little booth and there's this window between you and this naked woman, and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks
What kind of show
59
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do
These chicks do it all
They insert things into any opening in their body
any opening
(to customer) He's led a very sheltered life
(indicating ) Can we talk about this later
The jizz-mopper's job is to clean up the booths afterward, because practically everybody shoots a load against the window, and  don't know if you know or not, but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away
(grabbing her bag, disgusted) This is the last time  come to this place
Excuse me
Using filthy language in front of the customers
you should both get fired
We're sorry, ma'am
We got a little carried away
Well,  don't know if sorry can make up for it
found your remarks highly offensive
The  stands silently, awaiting something
Well, you think that's offensive
flips open the magazine's centerfold-a graphic picture of a woman with her vaginal lips and anus spread wide open
60
then check this out
think you can see her kidneys
checks out the centerfold wistfully
frantically apologizes to the rapidly exiting
Ma'am, ma'am, 'm sorry
Please, wait a second, ma'am
The  is gone
' pursuit stops at the counter
turns on
Why do you do things like that
You know she's going to come back and tell the boss
Who cares
That lady's an asshole
Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight
This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers
'm gonna hear it tomorrow
You gotta loosen up, my friend
You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer
What for
They don't bother me if don't bother them
Liar
Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis
There aren't
How can you lie like that
Why don't you vent
Vent your frustration
Come on, who pisses you off
61
(reluctantly) It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings
Let's hear it
(pause) The milkmaids
The milkmaids
: pulls out gallon after gallon, looking deep into the cooler for that perfect container of milk
(
) The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date
As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade
You know who  can do without could do without the people in the video store
Which ones
All of them
#1/ series of people addressing the camera, asking the dumb questions
What would you get for a six-year- old boy who chronically wets his bed
(in front of stocked new release shelf) Do you have any new movies in
62
Do you have that one with the guy who was in that movie that was out last year
And they never rent quality flicks; they always pick the most intellectually devoid movie on the rack
#2/"Ooooh
" An identical series of customers finding their ideal choices
Ooooh
Home Alone
Ooooh
Hook
Ooooh
Navy Seals
It's like in order to join, they have to have an  less than their shoe size
You think you get stupid questions
You should hear the barrage of stupid questions  get
#3/ series of people standing in various locations throughout the convenience store, asking truly dumb questions
(holding coffee) What do you mean there's no ice
You mean 've gotta drink this coffee hot
(holding up item from clearly marked $
99 display) How much
63
(peeking in door) Do you sell hubcaps
See
You vented
Don't you feel better now
No
Why not
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married
Jesus, you got a one-track mind
It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin
(jerking head toward door) Veronica
gives  a shove to shut him up
enters the store, carrying books and something covered with aluminum foil
What happened to home by twelve
is suddenly by her side, taking the books from under her arm
He still hasn't shown up
Why aren't you in class
Lit 101 got canceled, so  stopped home and brought you some lunch
What is it
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off
What do you think it is
It's lasagne
64
Really
(kisses her forehead) You're the best
'm glad you've calmed down a bit
(to ) Hi, Randal
(
) (exaggeratively impressed) Thirty-seven
(to
) Shut up
(to ) Yes, 've calmed down, 'm still not happy about it, but 've been able to deal
makes loud slurping noises from
(to
) Why don't you go back to the video store
walks past the two, and pats  on the head
He exits
You had to tell him
had to tell someone
He put it into perspective
What did he say
At least he wasn't thirty-six
And that made you feel better
And he said most of them are college guys, 've never met or seen
65
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it
it isn't there
Yes
Thank you for being rational
Thank you for the lasagne
You couldn't get these shutters open
called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow
Bummer, Well, 've gotta head back for the one-thirty class
What time do you get finished
Eight
But  have a sorority meeting till nine, so 'll be back before you close
Can we go out and get some coffee
Sure
Good
(kisses him) 'll see you when you close, then
Enjoy the lasagne
She exits
leans against the magazine rack with his lasagne, contemplative
pops his head in and makes the loud slurping noise again
: : is recommending titles to potential customers
66
All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent
(studying box) This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it
Hey, neither did ; but that was a great movie, right
opens the door and leans in
Can you come next door
gotta make a phone call
(to ) Smokey Three: thumbs up, am  right
The best Burtless movie ever made
exits
gives his customers the what-did--tell- you look
: : lies on the counter
Pull back to reveal  as he rings up an order
The  pets the cat, smiling
Awww, he's so cute
What's his name
Lenin's Tomb
Dolly over to , on the phone
Hello, is Mr
Synder there
This is Dante
Did he say if he was on his way here
Here
The convenience store
know, but the other guy called out this morning and Mr
() 67
(') Synder asked me to cover until he got here
He said he'd be here by noon, but it's one-thirty now, so Excuse me
Vermont
No, that can't be;  talked to him this morning
He left at what time
He really went to Vermont
When the hell was someone going to tell me
He promised he was coming by noon
Jesus
When does he get back
You've gotta be fucking kidding me
've got a hockey game at two, and the fucking shutters are jammed closed, and he's in Vermont
'm not even supposed to be here today
(deep sigh) So 'm stuck here till closing
This is just great just can't believe
'm sorry, didn't mean to yell at you
No
No, 'll be all right
Well, that's all  can do, right
Thanks
He hangs up
joins him
Vermont
Can you believe this
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning
Not a fucking word
Slippery shit
So, what-you're stuck here all day
Why'd you apologize
What
68
heard you apologize
Why
You have every right in the world to be mad
know
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down
don't back down
Yes, you do
You always back down
You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt
You know what pisses me off the most
The fact that 'm right about your buckling
'm going to miss the game
Because you buckled
Would you shut the hell up with that shit
It's not helping
Don't yell at me, pal
Sorry
See
There you go again
can't believe 'm going to miss the game
At least we're stuck here together
69
You've got a customer
walks away
(
) What
What do you want
shakes his head in frustration and picks up the phone again
Sanford
Dante
can't play today
'm stuck at work
know 'm not scheduled, but-just forget it
can't play
Neither can Randal
He's working too
comes back
rolls his eyes to the ceiling
(getting an idea) Wait a second
Do we have to play at the park
Hold on
(to ) Do you feel limber
: : is rolled around the top of a stick
Laces are pulled tightly
An orange ball is slapped back and forth by a blade
The   fill the convenience store
Some sit on the floor or lean against the coolers, but all are either preparing or practicing
enters, wearing his equipment
skates to his side
(lifting his foot) Pull my laces tighter
(drops mitt and pulls laces) 've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves 've ever been privy to
never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy
told him  had a game today
It's his own fault
70
No argument here
Insubordination rules
just want to play hockey like was scheduled to
skates up and skids to a halt
Dante, let me grab a Gatorade
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one
So
So
So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades
What do you care
Hey, what smells like shoe polish
've got a responsibility here can't let everybody grab free drinks
What responsibility
You're closing the fucking store to play hockey
He's blunt, but he's got a point
At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here
All 'm saying is if you're going to be insubordinate, you should go the full nine and not pussy out when it comes to free refreshments
He's right
As if we're suddenly gonna have a run on Gatorade
71
Fuckin-
All right
Jesus, you fuckers are pushy
Hey man,  hear Caitlin's marrying an Asian drum major
Design major
Can we not talk about this
Fine by me
But you're living in denial and suppressing rage
(skating away; to all) Dante said we can all drink free Gatorade
laid-back hurrah is heard
Are you gonna lock the store
don't know
You going to lock the video store
Look who you're asking here
How're we gonna block off the street
We're not playing in the street
Then where're we gonna play
: : The sign on the door reads: The  ascend a ladder adjacent to the door, one by one
they jump off the ladder and skate around
More players join them
72
From across the street we get the full, odd perspective: a store with many men gliding around on the roof
On the roof  skates and passes with another player
stretches, leaning against the sign
pulls his mask on and slaps his glove, urging a shot skates in and takes a shot, which  blocks
and deal to a player: he drops money over the ledge and  throws up a dime bag
holds a ball in the center of the court
Ready
take positions
comes to the center and holds the ball in drop position
and  face off, and the ball is in play
The game begins as the players engage in a savage ballet
Faces are smashed with sticks, slide tackles are made, shots are taken, 's of various players included
call out encouragement and slander from the sidelines
More game playing including both goalies getting scored on and more face-offs
Below, a  tugs on the convenience store door
He reads the sign and then backs up into the street, attempting to peer over the ledge
Above, the game continues
Below, the  shifts from one foot to the other impatiently
He grabs the ladder and quickly ascends
Above, from over the ledge of the roof, we see the head of the customer peek
Skating feet pass rapidly before him, and he watches for a moment before calling out
When's this period over
(
) Eight more minutes
Are you shitting me
want to get cigarettes
skids to the sidelines
(out of breath) If you can just wait a few more minutes
73
Fuck that
'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder
(
) Dante
Where are you
He's busy
starts to skate away
'll be right back
It's almost over
He jumps back into the game
What the fuck is this
want some service
(
) In a second
Fuck in a second

You suck

Who are you to make assessments

He sucks
(to ) You suck
Like you're better

can whip your ass
Below, a  pulls at the door
She peers into the store, face against the glass
(
) That's easy to say from over here
(
) Give me a stick, pretty boy
'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass
The  backs up and, shielding her eyes, looks toward the roof
Is the convenience store open
Above,  and the  shout down at the
(simultaneously) (to ) There's a stick over there
You're shooting against the goal
(to the court) new face-off pits  against the
The ball drops between the two and  gets flattened
The winds up and takes a hard shot
The ball sails off the court, through the air, and into a faraway yard
calls to the sidelines
Give me another ball
(
) There are no more
What the fuck are you talking about
How many balls did you bring
skates up to him
75
(counting) There was the orange ball
and the orange ball
scrambles to the edge and calls over
Are there any balls down there
(
) 'Bout the biggest pair you ever seen
looks around, hyperventilating
You only brought one ball
thought Redding had like three balls
(
) thought Dante had the balls
Nobody has another ball
Shit
We get
what
twelve minutes of game, and it's over
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
(pause; rubs head) 'm not even supposed to be here today
skates off
We still get free Gatorade, right
: : standing on a ladder, replaces a fluorescent light
An joins him at the foot of the ladder
Be careful
76
'm trying
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer
So 'm told
had a friend that used to chew glass for a living
In the circus
The light in place,  descends the ladder and closes it
And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass
No, he got hit by a bus
(confused) Oh
Can  help you
Well, that depends
Do you have a bathroom
Um
yeah, but it's for employees only
understand, but can  use it
'm not that young anymore, so 'm kind of
you know
incontinent
Uh
sure
Go ahead
It's back through the cooler
Thanks son
Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there
The white kind
77
'm not asking about the color mean is it rough or cottony
Actually, it is kind of rough
Rough, eh
Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids
Say, would you mind if  took a roll of the soft stuff back there
see you sell the soft stuff
Yeah, but
Aw, c'mon boy
What's the difference
You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough
Yeah, okay
Go ahead
Thanks son, you're a lifesaver
The   walks off
heads back to the counter
The returns
Say, young fella, you know  hate to bother you again, but can  take a paper or something back there
to read
It usually takes me a while, and  like to read while it's going on
Jesus
go ahead
Thanks, young man
You've got a heart of gold
The   sifts through some papers and a few magazines
He comes back to the counter
You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there
78
Can  trouble you for one of those magazines
said go ahead
No,  mean the ones there
Behind the counter
glances over and reacts
The porno mags
Yeah
like the cartoons
They make me laugh
They draw the biggest titties
(hands one to him) Here
Now leave me alone
Uh, can  have the other one
The one below this one
They show more in that one
makes the switch
Thanks son
appreciate this
The   walks off
We hear the back door open and close, then the front door does the same
joins
Helluva game
One ball
They come all the way here
close the damn store
for one ball
Hockey's hockey
At least we got to play
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game
Jesus, it's barely a warm-up
79
Bitch, bitch, bitch
You want something to drink
(walking away) Gatorade
Pause
Then
(
) What happened to all the Gatorade
Exactly
They drank it all
(
) After an exhausting game like that can believe it
(as ) "It's not like we're gonna sell out
" comes back with drinks
You know what Sanford told me
(offering drink) still can't believe Caitlin's getting married
Julie Dwyer died
Yeah, right
No, 'm serious
is visibly taken aback
Oh, my god
Sanford's brother dates her cousin
He found out this morning
80
How
When
Embolism in her brain
Yesterday
Jesus
She was swimming at the  pool when it happened
Died midbackstroke
haven't seen her in almost two years
Correct me if 'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve
Number six
You've had sex with a dead person
'm gonna go to her wake
No, you're not
Why not
It's today
What
Paulsen's Funeral Parlor
The next show is at four
Shit
What about tomorrow
One night only
She's buried in the morning
81
You've gotta watch the store have to go to this
Wait, wait, wait
Has it occurred to you that  might bereaved as well
You hardly knew her
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there
All of our old classmates, to say the least
Stop it
This is beneath even you
'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season
You hate people
But  love gatherings
Isn't it ironic
Don't be an asshole
Somebody has to stay with the store
If you go,  go
She meant nothing to you
She meant nothing to you either until  told you she died
'm not taking you to this funeral
'm going with you
can't close the store
82
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof
Exactly, which means  can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake
: : drives with passenger , their backs to the camera
You were saying
Thanks for putting me in a tough spot
You're a good friend
Silence
Then
She was pretty young, hunhh
Twenty-two; same as us
An embolism in a pool
An embarrassing way to die
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died
How'd he die
Broke his neck
That's embarrassing
He broke his neck trying to suck his own dick
Absolute silence
Then
83
Shut the hell up
Bible truth
Stop it
swear
Oh, my god
Come on
Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick
No
Yeah sure
You're so repressed
Because  never tried to suck my own dick
No, because you won't admit to it
As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself
You're as curious as the rest of us, pal
You've tried it
Who found him
My cousin
My aunt found him
On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top
Dick in his mouth
My aunt freaked out
It was a mess
His dick was in his mouth
Balls resting on his lips
He made it, hunhh
84
Yeah, but at what a price
Silence
Then
could never reach
Reach what
You know
What, your dick
Yeah
Like you said, you know guess everyone tries it, sooner of later
never tried it
glares at
Silence
Then
Fucking pervert
: : and  walk up the path to the funeral parlor
know it was a bad idea to close the store
Listen to you
can't help it
At least when we were playing hockey outside, could see if anyone wanted to go in
Nobody's there
It's four o'clock on a Saturday
How many people ever come to the store at four on a Saturday
: 85
: is outside the store
: : and  run from the front door, closely chased by a small crowd of angry mourners
Car locks are slammed down
The car screams away
The pursuing crowd stands in the middle of the street, shaking their fists, throwing things
: : The car pulls up and  and  get out
Absolutely nobody is outside
(furious) can't fucking believe you
'm telling you, it wasn't my fault
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes
was just leaning on it
It was an accident
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose
So the casket fell over
Big deal
Her fucking body fell out
So they'll put her back in
It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something
(opening door) Just
go
Go open the video store
86
(
) (mimicking) Yeah
Open the video store
(to
) Shut the fuck up, junkie
enters the frame, right next to
He aims his butt at him and farts
lunges for him
grabs
(to ) Go open the video store
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk
(to ) How many times  gotta tell you not to deal outside the store
'm not dealing
tugs at ' shirt
You got anything, man
Yeah, what do you want
heads to the video store
enters the convenience store and slides the sign to
After a few seconds, the (guy who lost his keys) appears, flashlight in hand, scanning the ground
(to ) Hey, did you see a set of keys lying around here somewhere
: : rearranges the milk
joins him
Let me borrow your car
87
don't want to talk to you
Fine
Just lend me your car
Why should  loan you my car
want to rent a movie
(pause) You want to rent a movie
walks away, shaking his head
What's that for
You work in a video store
They head back to the counter
work in a shitty video store want to go to a good video store so can rent a good movie
Are you open
(simultaneously) The  comes to the counter
Pack of cigarettes
(pets cat) Cute cat
What's its name
Annoying Customer
The  lets it sink in, and then leaves in a huff
puts up cigarettes
88
Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time
Let me borrow your car
(calmer) May  be blunt with you
If you must
We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and  video, respectively
As such, we have certain responsibilities which- though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing
see
So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure
There's a difference
Those were obligations
Obligations that could not have been met at any later date
Now renting videos-that's just gratuitous, not to mention illogical, considering you work in a video store
Another  leans in
Are you open
(rolls his eyes) Yes
You know what
don't think  care for you rationale
89
It's going to have to do for now, considering that it's my car that's up for request
(to ) Can  help you
Pack of cigarettes
What's your point
My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job
You can't just do anything you want while you're working
(reading tabloid) "Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase
" (to  and ) They print any kind of shit in these papers
They certainly do
Two fifty-five
So your argument is that title dictates behavior
What
The reasons you won't let me borrow your care is because  have a title and a job description, and 'm supposed to follow it, right
Exactly
(interjecting) saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week
() 90
(') Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird
Crazy shit
(eyes the , annoyed) So 'm no more responsible for my own decisions while 'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia
That's stretching it
You're not being asked to slay children or anything
Not yet
(sips water) (again with the interjections) And  remember this one time the damn paper said
spits a mist of water at the customer, drenching him
The man reacts violently, attempting to grab  from over the counter
makes no move, but remains untouched
plays block
'
Sir
Sir, 'm sorry
He didn't mean it
He was trying to get me
Well, he missed
know
'm sorry
Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even
91
(considerably calmer; takes money) This is the last time  ever come here
(to ) And if  ever see you again, 'm gonna break your fucking head open
The  leaves, wiping water from his face salutes him
(angrily) What the fuck did you do that for
Two reasons: one,  hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines
Jesus
And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior
What
If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public,  wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy
But  did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior
Hence, even though 'm a clerk in this video store, choose to go rent videos at Big Choice
(extends opened palm) Agreed
(shakes his head; hands over keys) You're a danger to both the dead and the living
like to think 'm a master of my own destiny
92
Please, get the hell out of here
know 'm your hero
exits
: : waits on a customer ()
He lifts the gallon of milk into a paper bag, letting out a slight grunt
Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym
Excuse me
heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag
That milk only weighs about seven pounds
didn't strain
sighed
don't think so
That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles
'm a trainer
know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape
don't think so
Oh,  do
You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash
Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized
They are not
Yes, they are
You're out of shape
93
What are you talking about
There's no fat on this body
No fat, but no tone either
You don't get enough exercise
female customer () leans in the doorway
Are you open
Yes
(grabs a paper) Just the paper
(to ) Thirty-fire
(to ) Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape
(studies ) don't know
can't really tell from here
He is
am not
How much can you bench
don't know
(studying ) 'd say about sixty, seventy-tops
know  can bench more than that
94
think the lady called it
My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier
He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy
do about three-fifty, four
No way
(rolling up sleeve) Feel that
That's tight
Solid
Now feel his
(to ) Roll up your sleeve, chief
Oh for God's sake
See
You're ashamed
You know you're out of shape
Take my card
can help you tone that body up in no time
Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program
carrying a notebook comes to the counter
You open
(to ) Yes
(to ) 'm not out of shape
Excuse me, but have you been here all day
What
95
(still studying ) He's got those love handles
(to ) don't have love handles
Were you working here at about four o'clock
've been here since six o'clock this morning
Why
(to ) It's probably from being around all this food every day
Oh,  know
If  had to work here all day, 'd be bloated and out of shape, too
'm not out of shape
Can  have your name please
Dante Hicks
Why
What is this about
The   scribbles in his notebook
You're Dante Hicks
Oh my God didn't even recognize you
Because he's out of shape
Do  know you
You remember Alyssa Jones
She hung out with
Caitlin Bree
Yeah
96
'm her sister
You're Alyssa's sister
Heather
Yep
remember you got caught in my parents' room with Caitlin once
Did you say Caitlin Bree
Yeah
Pretty girl, about this girl's height-dark hair-gorgeous body
Yeah
And your name is Dante Hicks
You went to high school with her
You played hockey
How do you know that
Oh man
Hey, you still going out with her
No, she's getting married
To you
To an Asian design major
Shit
(to ) Don't take this the wrong way, but used to fuck her
What
97
While you two were dating in high school
We're talking four, five years ago, back when  drove a Trans-Am
Oh my God
You're Rick Derris
Yeah
You know him
Caitlin used to talk about him all the time
Really
Oh yeah
You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big
Wait a second
(to ) You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree
While  was dating her
All the time
That girl was like a rabbit
don't believe this
(to ) still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room
98
Holy shit
She told you about that
(to ) Buddy of mine worked there
Said he watched the whole thing
They used to film people at that hotel; nobody knew about it
She said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm
What
When
When did all this shit happen
Hey man, that was a long time ago
Don't let it get to you
'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante
Everybody in school knew-even in my class
Jesus Christ, what next
The   rips a piece of paper out of his notebook and hands it to
Here you go
What's this
fine, for five hundred dollars
Five hundred bucks
What for
For violation of New Jersey Statute Section Two , number one-seventy slash fifty-one: Any person who sells or makes available tobacco or tobacco-related products to persons under the age of eighteen is regarded as disorderly
99
What are you talking about
According to the -the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor
didn't do that
You said you were here all day
Yeah, but  didn't sell cigarettes to any kids
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock
Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine
You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours
It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child
But  didn't sell cigarettes to any kid
To a five-year-old kid
What a scumbag
That's sick, Dante
didn't sell cigarettes to any kids
swear
100
The due date is on the bottom
This summons cannot be contested in any court of law
Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest
Have a nice day
The   exits, with  trying to follow
But  didn't sell cigarettes to any kids
Hey
(takes back the card) Forget it
don't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old
(to ) Can  offer you a ride somewhere
Sure
How about the beach
like the way you think
The two exit
, alone, studies his summons
He rubs his forehead
Jesus
What next
(
) Dante
spins, angrily
What
His expression softens
Caitlin
: : deals with a customer as   looks on
101
That's the price, my brother
Yo,  don't have that kind of cash
For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash
How long you gonna be here
Till ten
Then 'm going to John 's party
You're gonna be at John 's party
(to  ) My man is deaf
(yelling) '    '
(quieter) Neh
Yo, don't sell all that
'Cause 'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John 's
You're gonna bring it, right
The only place  don't bring my drugs is church
And that ain't till Sunday morning
Yo
'll see you at that party
(puts his hand up to be slapped) 'll see you there
(reluctantly slapping hands) 'll see you there
leaves
turns to
102
It's motherfuckers like that who give recreational drug users a bag name
(suddenly spotting someone
) : : and  are embracing very tightly
We hold on them for a few seconds, just to let it sink in
Then
When did you get back
Just now
My God
haven't seen you since
(he hugs her again) Dante
You've got a customer
hops behind the counter
customer pays for something while  continues to talk
just saw Alyssa's little sister outside
She was with Rick Derris
Let's not talk about that
How'd you get home
Train
It took eight hours
can't believe you're here
Another customer comes to the counter
Excuse me, do you have
103
(to ) To the back, above the oil
(to ) How long are you staying
Until Monday
Then  have to take the train back
Yet another customer comes to the counter
Pack of cigarettes
(to ) Congratulations
saw that announcement in today's paper
(to ) She's marrying an Asian design major
So 'm told
: : and   lean against the wall
Man, it's fucking slow
walks out of the frame, leaving  alone against the wall
He comes back a few seconds later, carrying a mini-Walkman with ten-watt speakers
He sets it down on the ground and turns it on
House music starts playing
Jay- possessed by the beat-breaks into an impromptu dance, in which he makes suggestive and often lewd moves leans against the wall
: : On counter
You're just going to lock the store like that
want to talk to you about something, and  don't want to be disturbed
104
You saw it
Very dramatic,  thought
It's not what you think
What, it's worse
You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child
'm not pregnant
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation
was going to tell you
But then we were getting along so well, didn't want to mess it up
You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend told you  have a girlfriend
know, 'm sorry
But when we started talking
it's like forgot  had a boyfriend
And then he proposed last month
And you said yes
Well
kind of, sort of
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours
Kind of, sort of
Everyone knows about this except me
Do you know how humiliating that is
would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby
105
How do you know that
Because  know you
You prefer drastic measures to rational ones
So you're really getting married
No
No, you're not really getting married
The story goes like this: He proposed, and  told him  had to think about it, and he insisted wear the ring anyway
Then my mother told the paper we were engaged
How like her
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper
That's when hopped the train to come back here, because  knew you'd be a wreck
Thanks for the vote of confidence
Was  right
Wreck is a harsh term
Disturbed is more like it
Mildly disturbed even
love a macho facade
It's such a turn-on
(sniffing air) What smells like shoe polish
And you came here to what
To comfort me
106
The last thing  needed was for you to think  was hiding something from you
But you were
No,  wasn't
Not really
told you'd 'd been seeing other people
Yeah, but not seriously
Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle-'d say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody
'm giving him his ring back
What
don't want to marry him
don't want to get married now
'm on the verge of graduation
want to go to grad school after this
And then want to start a career
don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when '' going to fit in all of the other stuff
've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife
And  know that's what 'd become
Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway
Sang
His name is a past tense
Stop it
He's a nice guy
If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him
107
just told you
There's more, isn't there
Why, Mr
Hicks-whatever do you mean
Tell me  don't have something to do with it
You don't have anything to do with it
You lie
Look how full of yourself you are
just believe in giving credit where credit is due
And  believe that 'm the impetus behind your failure to wed
If 'm so nuts about you, then why am  having sex with an Asian design major
Jesus, you're caustic
had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on
When say  don't want to get married, mean just that
don't want to marry anybody
Not for years
So who's asking
don't want to marry you
Good
Stay in that frame of mind
Buy can we date
108
'm sure Sang and-Veronica
-would like that
We could introduce them
They might hit it off
You're serious
You want to date again
would like to be your boyfriend, yes
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years
Believe me, you'll get over it
Give me a bit more credit
think it's time we got back together, you know
'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, 'm already in the job market
You work in a market, all right
Cute
Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again
After all the talking we've been doing
The key word here is talk, Dante think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date
So
what
So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating
don't know
Maybe we should just see what happens
Let me take you out tonight
109
You mean, on a date
Yes
real date
Dinner and a movie
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date
think 've been on that one before
You have a better suggestion
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date
hear that's a rather popular date
(hits him) Jerk
Here  am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words
What about Sing
Sang
Sang
He's not invited
He's your fiance
offer you my body and you offer me semantics
He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why  came all the way here from Ohio, 'm about to become single again
() 110
(') And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which 'll probably be ostracized at both school and home
You ask me who choose,  choose you
So what are you saying
You're such an asshole
'm just kidding
can already tell this isn't going to work
'll ask Randal to close up for me- when he gets back
Where'd he go
'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog
He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet
Ah, screw it; 'll just lock the store up and leave him a note
You're too responsible
But no have to go home first
They don't even know  left school
And should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang
Who doesn't
Well, me  guess
(gathering herself to go) So,  shall take my leave of you, but  will return in a little while, at which time-yes- would love to go for dinner and a movie with you
111
What happened to the walk and the nakedness
'm easy, but 'm not that easy
(she kisses his cheek) See you later, handsome
watches her leave
He then explodes in jubilance
: : looks ahead, dreamily, half-spinning in his chair
enters carrying videos
Get to work
(takes videos) What'd you rent
(reads) Best of Both Worlds
Hermaphroditic porn
Starlets with both organs
You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame
And this is what you rented
like to expand my horizons
got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor
No way
Five hundred dollars
You're bullshitting
112
hands him the summons
reads it
didn't think they even enforced this
(points to himself) Living proof
thought you never sold cigarettes to kids
don't; you did
(pause) Really
Little girl
Maybe five years old
(taken aback) Holy shit
That girl
As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here
Then how come you got the fine
Because 'm here
(incredulous) You're lying
swear
couldn't make this kind of hell up
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now
Because 'm happy
113
You're happy
'm happy
You're happy to get a fine
No
'm happy because Caitlin came to see me
Now  know you're lying
'm not
She just left
What did she say
She's not going to marry that guy
She went home to tell her mother
You're kidding
'm not
(takes it in for a moment) Wow
You've had quite an evening
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out
feel so ineffectual
Is there anything  can do for you
Watch the store while  go home and change
What happened to title dictates behavior
114
This is my way of spitting water at life
(suddenly aware) Hey, what about Veronica
No
Don't bring it up
don't want to think about that now
Let me enjoy this hour of bliss
'll think about all of that later
In the meantime, nobody mentions the word
You're a snake
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns
You want me to bring the  over here so we can watch this
might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight
All right, but you're missing out
Chicks with dicks
(puts cats on counter) 'll read the book
exits
comes back to the counter
He pets the cat
Cute cat
What's his name
Peptic ulcer
: 115
: and   watch as  passes
small group of burners are poised around the store door
carefully writes on a large piece of paper, using a thick marker
hands him the scissors
slowly cuts the large piece of paper
hands him the tape
snaps off a few pieces, and plasters the sign to the convenience store door
It is a large word balloon, and it reads
Once in place, he raps on the window
looks out, his face adjacent to the word balloon, making it appear as if he is saying he eats cock
The small group laughs hysterically
: : enters, carrying an overnight bag
is watching his porno
The porno is loud and lewd
stares
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs
Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree
You saw that article
God, isn't it awful
My mother sent that in
take it she likes the guy
You'd think she was marrying him
What are you watching
Children's programming
What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore
She said not to come home until graduation
Wow, you got thrown out
For Dante
What can  say
He does weird things to me
116
Can  watch
You can hold me down
Can  join in
You might be let down
'm not a hermaphrodite
Few are
So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around
woman's intuition
Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try
Wow
Hey,  was just about to order some dinner
You eat Chinese, right
Dick
Exactly
So where is he
He went home to change for the big date
God, isn't he great
(indicating ) No, this is great
Can  use the bathroom
There's no light back there
117
Why aren't there any lights
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five- fourteen every night
You're kidding
Nobody can figure it out
And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store
Such a sordid state of affair
And 'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on
'll try to manage
She heads toward the back
Hey Caitlin
(cautionary) Break his heart again this time, and 'll kill you
Nothing personal
You're very protective of him, Randal
You always have been
Territoriality
He was mine first
(rubs his head) Awww
That was so cute
She kisses his forehead and walks away
The  and (Happy Scrappy) come to the counter
118
(oblivious of the ) pack of cigarettes
The   points at the  screen
Cunt
: : studies the    word balloon
enters
Who eats cock
Bunch of savages in this town
(recalling) Hey, Caitlin's in the back
You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time
There's no lights back there
told her that
She said she didn't need any
Why don't you join her, man
Make a little bathroom bam-bam
love your sexy talk
It's so
kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee
Fuck you
The cooler down is heard opening
walks lazily down the convenience store aisle
She looks very satisfied and  regard her curiously
She joins them, latching on to 's arm, lovingly
How'd you get here so fast
left like an hour ago
119
(regards him curiously) Do you always talk weird after you violate women
and  stare at , confused
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium
Could be
(hugging ) Promise me it'll always be like that
Like what
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything
Um
okay
Am  missing something here
went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me
He was
It was so cool
He didn't say a word
He was just
ready, you know
And we didn't kiss or talk or anything
He just sat there and let me do all the work
(to ) You dog
didn't see you go back there
is bewildered
120
And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so
(she lets out a growl and hugs ) God
That was so great
(quietly) It wasn't me
(laughing it off) Yeah, right
Who was it: Randal
(to ) Was it you
was here the whole time
(half-laughing) You two better quit it
'm serious
(beat) We didn't just have sex in the bathroom
No
Everyone is silent
Then
Stop this
This isn't funny
'm not kidding
just got back from outside
(covering her chest) This isn't fucking funny, Dante
'm not fooling around
(to ) Who went back there
121
Nobody
swear
feel nauseous
Are you sure somebody was back there
(hits ) didn't just fuck myself
Jesus, 'm going to be sick
You just fucked a total stranger
Shut the fuck up
can't believe this
feel faint
(to ) Call the police
Why
No, don't
There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin
(weakly) Oh God
She said she did all the work
(pause) : 122
: '  is serene, almost happy, as he lies on a stretcher
(Same   who took a porn mag to the bathroom
) (
) Who is he
The body bag zipper is pulled closed
, the , and  stand around the stretcher-bound body bag
The takes notes
don't know
He just came in and asked to use the bathroom
What time was this
Um
don't know
(to ) What time did hockey end
Around three or something
What time did we go to the funeral
think four
Wait a second
Who was working here today
Just me
thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral
We did
Then who operated the store
Nobody
It was closed
123
With this guy locked in
Everything happened at once guess  forgot he was back there
Ambulance attendants join them
1 Can we take this now
Go ahead
The stretcher is wheeled out
Midway down the body bag, something protrudes, pushing the bag up
It is an erection
stares at it
Was he alive when
Caitlin
No
place the time of death at about three-twenty
Then how could she
you know
The body can maintain an erection after expiration
Sometimes for hours
Did he have the adult magazine when he came in
No
gave it to him
and the  stare in disbelief
Well he asked me for it
(continuing) can't say for certain until we get him back to the lab, but my guess is he was masturbating, his heart seized and he died
That's when the girl found him
(sniffing the air) Something smells like shoe polish
124
(to ) This has gotta be the weirdest thing you've ever been called in on
(writing) Actually,  once had to tag a kid that broke his neck trying to put his mouth on his penis
looks down, anonymously
What about Caitlin
Shock trauma
She's going to need years of therapy after this
My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man
She thought it was me
The  stares at
What kind of convenience store do you run here
He exits
and  stare at the floor
(beat) Do you think he was talking about my cousin
: : sits in the back of the ambulance, a blanket draped over her shoulders
An attendant takes her blood pressure
The doors are closed and the vehicle speeds away
and lean against the wall
eats sugar out of a box
knew one of those motherfuckers was gonna kill somebody one day
: 125
: jar of salsa is invaded by a large corn chip
Once in the condiment, the corn chip resembles a surfacing shark fin
Fingers poke at it, bringing it to life-swimming menacingly to and fro across the jar
(
) (mumbling Jaws theme) Da-dum
Da-dum
Da-dum
-
- -
and  are on a freezer case
pushes this chip around the jar of salsa
stares up at the ceiling, oblivious
Salsa shark
says nothing
(as Brody) "We're gonna need a bigger boat
" says even less than nothing
(as Quint) "Man goes into the cage; cage goes into the salsa; shark's in the salsa; our shark
" you know
(angry) What
What's with you
You haven't said anything for like twenty minutes
What the hell is your problem
This life
This life
Why do  have this life
Have some chips; you'll feel better
126
'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddam steel shutters are locked all day, smell like shoe polish, 've got an ex-girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks
Thirty-seven
My life is in the shitter right about now, so if you don't mind, 'd like to stew a bit
(
) You open
Yeah
hops off the freezer case and steps
(
) That's all bullshit
You know what the real problem here is
was born
comes back
You should shit or get off the pot
should shit or get off the pot
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot
What are you talking about
'm talking about this thing you have
this inability to improve your situation in life
127
Fuck you
It's true
You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is
What responsibility
All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit
As if it's that easy
It is
You just up and quit
There are other jobs, and they pay better money
You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them
So what's stopping you
Leave me alone
You're comfortable
This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself
Oh, like your life's any better
'm satisfied with my situation for now
You don't hear me bitching
You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day
Thank you
Why don't you go back to the video store
It's the same thing with Veronica
128
Leave her out of this
You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient
Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin
You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake
You're twenty-two
Leave me alone
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin
If you want Veronica, be with Veronica
But don't pine for one and fuck the other
Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward
If  wasn't such a fucking coward
(chuckles) It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do
Am  right or what
You're wrong
Things happened today, okay
Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin
What
The dead guy
She'll get over fucking the dead guy
Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years;  call him Dad
Caitlin and  can't be together
It's impossible
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement
129
What do you want me to say
Yes, suppose some of the things you're saying may be true
But that's the way things are; it's not going to change
Make them change
can't, all right
Jesus, would you leave me alone
can't make changes like that in my life
If could,  would-but  don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes
Who're you kidding
You can so
Jesus
Christ,  can't
So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change
(sadly) My mother told me once that when as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it,  chose to shit my pants
Lovely story
Point is-'m not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably
crosses
appears contemplative
: : repairs ripped dollar bills, taping them back together
enters with   and claps his hands
130
(singing) Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed
Doing coke
Drinking beers
(to ) pack of wraps, my good man
It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed
Done poisoning the youth for the day
Hell yes, whatever that means
Now 'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid
(pulls out money) - Wider, one-and-a-halfs
One seventy-nine
(to  ) Pay the good man
(to ) Don't you close soon
half hour
We get off about the same time every night
We should hang out
You get high
should start
Wanna come to this party tonight
There's gonna be some pussy there, man
With you
don't think so
Listen to you
Oh shit
"Oh, don't hang out with drug dealers
" 131
Nothing personal
hands weed to
work, just like you
You're more of a crook than  am, dude
How do you figure
You can't roll a joint in here
(rolling a joint) Relax brother
What  mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around
dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit
It's not my store
And these aren't my drugs- just sell them
The difference is you exploit a weakness
What's that mean
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction
All right
How much is Pepsi here
dollar sixty-nine, plus tax
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax
So
132
So why do you sell it for so much more
'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like " dollar eighty for soda
should get it at Food City
But  don't feel like driving there
'll just buy it here so  don't have to drive up there
" That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it
can't believe you just rolled a joint in here
Hey, man, what happened with that old guy
He died in the bathroom
That's fucked up
Yo,  heard he was jerkin' off
don't know
wasn't watching
Probably saw that Caitlin chick know  felt like beatin' it when saw her
(pantomimes sex) Come here, bitch
You like this
Is this what you want
Hunhh
Knock it off
That used to be my girlfriend
You used to go out with her
We were going to start again, think
Don't you already have a girlfriend
Veronica
133
Is she that girl who's down here all the time
She came here today carrying a plate of food
Lasagne
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick
Maybe
don't know dude
That Caitlin chick's nice
But  see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time
She brings you food, she rubs your back
Didn't  see her change your tire one day
jacked the car up
All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on
Damn
She sure goes out of her way
She's my girlfriend
've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit
(beat) Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it
" No, wait fucked up
She said "What's a good- looking plate with nothing on it
" Meaning
don't know
She was senile and shit
Used to piss herself all the time
'mon Silent Bob
Exit
stands there
134
You know, there's a million fine- looking women in the world, but they don't all bring you lasagne at work
Most of them just cheat on you
leaves
shuts his eyes tightly and rubs the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger, as if in deep concentration
He suddenly snaps his eyes open
(nearly surprised) He's right
love her
: : has a heart-to-heart with
So that's it
He doesn't love you anymore
He loves Caitlin
stares, dumbfounded
And
he told you all of this
Pretty much
All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory
don't know what to say
Don't hold it against him
He just never got Caitlin out of his system
It's not your fault
It's Dante
(beat) don't know thing one about chicks
Do you want to cry or something can leave
'm not sad
You're not
135
No, 'm more furious
'm pissed off
feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it
He has his friend do it for him
He didn't ask me to
After all that 've done for that fuck
And he wants to be with that slut
Fine
He can have his slut
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight
(oblivious of ) 'm going to have a word with that asshole
storms out
Wait
Veronica
don't think
stares after her
customer stands nearby
(to customer) What am  worried about
He'll probably be glad  started the ball rolling
All he ever did was complain about her anyway
'm just looking out for his best interests
mean, that's what a friend does, am  right
did him a favor
(sees box on counter) Oooh
Navy Seals
: : is on the ground holding his knee
stands above him
136
What the fuck did you do that for
If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it
Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back
What're you talking about
(kicks him) You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks
It was only a few times
And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because 've gone down on a couple guys
couple
(throws purse at him) 'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back
And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: 'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys go down on now
Would you let me explain
Explain what
How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her
(getting up) Veronica
it's not like that anymore
mean, it was never really like that
137
kicks him in the other leg
goes down, yelling in pain
You're damn right it's not like that
Because  won't let it be like that
You want your slut
Fine
The slut is yours
don't want Caitlin
You don't know what you want, but 'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out
've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if  was with you
Everyone said it was a stupid move, but didn't care because  loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago
And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more
don't want to go back with her
Of course not; not now
You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do
Well,  won't let you want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are
And when she dumps you again-and she will, Dante,  promise you that-when she dumps you again,  want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for
(grabs her purse) 'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't
138
(weakly) Randal
And having him tell me
that was just the weakest move ever
You're spineless
Veronica,  love you
Fuck you
exits
lies on the floor alone
: : exits and locks the door behind him
: : Tight on ' face as he steps inside
Dante
Hands clasp around his throat and yank him out of the frame
throttles , choking him to the ground throws his fists into ' midriff, throwing him back into the magazine rack
jumps to his feet as comes at him again
tumbles into the cakes as Entenman's products scatter beneath and around him
He grabs a pound cake and hits  in the head with it, using the opportunity to scurry down the middle aisle
leaps at his feet, and  grabs the shelves, knocking aspirin over until -shrieking-sprays something in ' face
paws at his eyes
grabs Italian bread and smacks it into ' face as he rushes him blindly chases him out of the frame
&'s scatter wildly across the empty floor, and the ruckus is heard
: and  later, out of breath, on the floor sits up against the candy rack, rubbing his neck
lies on the floor, bacon held against a sort of crushed cookies, ripped-open candies, broken bread, and other damaged goods
139
How's your eye
(reluctantly) The swelling's not so bad
But the stings
(then) How's your neck
It's hard to swallow
They are both silent
Then
You didn't have to choke me
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that  was going to dump her for Caitlin
thought  was doing you a favor
Thanks
You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so figured 'd help you out
Jesus
Silence
Then
You still didn't have to choke me
Oh please
'm surprised  didn't kill you
Why do you say that
Why do  say that
Randal
forget it
140
No, really
What did  do that was so wrong
What don't you do
Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable
How do you figure
What time did you get to work today
Like ten after
You were over half an hour late
Then all you do is come over here
To talk to you
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed
It's not like 'm miles away
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores
Hermaphrodites
rented it so we could watch it together
You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and  have to patch everything up
You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse
To top it all off, you ruin my relationship
What's your encore
Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank
() 141
(') (sighs) You know what the real tragedy is
'm not even supposed to be here today
(suddenly outraged) Fuck you
Fuck you, pal
Listen to you trying to pass the buck again
'm the source of all your misery
Who closed the store to play hockey
Who closed the store to attend a wake
Who tried to win back an ex- girlfriend without even discussing how he felt with his present one
You wanna blame somebody, blame yourself
(beat, as ) "'m not even supposed to be here today
" (whips stuff at ) You sound like an asshole
Whose choice was it to be here today
Nobody twisted your arm
You're here today of your own violation, my friend
But you'd like to believe that the weight of the world rests on your shoulders-that the store would crumble if Dante wasn't here
Well,  got news for you, jerk: This store would survive without you
Without me either
All you do is overcompensate for having what's basically a monkey's job: You push fucking buttons
Any moron can waltz in here and do our jobs, but you're obsessed with making it seem so much more fucking important, so much more epic than it really is
You work in a convenience store, Dante
And badly,  might add
And work in a shitty video store
Badly, as well
(beat) You know, that guy Jay's got it right-he has no delusions about what he does
Us
We like to make ourselves seem so much better than the people that come in here, just looking to pick up a paper or-God forbid-cigarettes
We look down on them, as it we're so advanced
Well, if we're so fucking advanced, then what are we doing working here
142
gets up, leaving  to contemplate his strong words alone
: and  silently clean up, backs to each other
: places a mop in the corner
pulls on his coat
threw out the stuff that got broken
The floor looks clean
You need a ride
(looks out door) Got one
Just pulled up
They stand in silence
Then
Do you work tomorrow
Same time
What about you
'm calling out
Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is
Then try to see Veronica
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night
after  get out of here
'll call you
Let you know
All right
Good luck with Veronica
If you want,  can talk to her, you know, and explain
No thanks
'll take care of it
We've got a lot of shit to talk about
143
Helluva day
To say the least
Do you need a hug or something
'Cause  would have no hang-ups about hugging you
you know, you being a guy and all
Just don't knead my ass when you do it
Get the fuck outta here already
'm gone
'll talk to you tomorrow
exits
second later, he reenters and tosses the sheet-sign
You're closed
He exits
pushes the sign over from Open to Closed
climbs behind the counter
He pops the register open and starts counting the drawer out
The door is heard opening
:  counting out the register, not looking up
What'd you forget something
(looks up, surprised) Oh
'm sorry, we're closed
gunshot blasts out
flies back, his chest exploding
He stares ahead and slumps to the floor
walks behind the counter, stepping over ' body on the floor, and takes the money out of the register
He grabs a paper bag and jams the money in it
He grabs handfuls of change, shoves it in his pocket, and then quickly exits the frame
continues to lie on the floor
Credits end, and the door is heard opening
customer comes to the counter and stands there
He waits, looks around for a clerk, looks down the aisles
Hello
Little help
144
No reply
He looks around again, and glances at the door to make sure nobody's coming in
Then he reaches behind the counter and grabs a pack of cigarettes
He leaves
