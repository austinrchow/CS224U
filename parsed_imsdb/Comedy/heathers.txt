"Heathers" (early), by Daniel Waters An Original Screenplay by Daniel Waters Registered November 17, 1987 : -- , a sullen seventeen year old beauty is jogging down a suburban street in a stylish running outfit
Evocative female voices can be heard, softly wailing
-- lurches into a neighborhood park, running with an increasing sense of desperation
The female voices wail louder
-- whooshes past a series of shops and a movie theatre
-- Reveling in her own sweat and agony,  bounds onto the lawn of her impressive upper middle class home
She painfully rushes closer and closer to the front door as the female moans swell to a deafening summit
The evocative wailing cuts off as she grabs the doorknob
' -- zips into a chic, but understated ensemble as she launches into voice-over narration
(
) Heather told me she teaches people Real Life
Composed and unsweaty,  fingers her bangs in the mirror then rambles off
-- Continuing her narration,  glides through a bustling high school hallway with a frozen smile
(
) She said Real Life sucks Losers dry
If you want to fuck with the eagles, you have to learn to fly
With her back turned to the viewer,  stands at the outskirts of the cafeteria entrance
The viewer's viewpoint approaches and finally curls around  to reveal that she is writing in a diary, wearing a monocle
(
) said so you teach people how to spread their wings and fly
She said Yes
' pen sways across the diary page forming the words echoed by her voice-over
(
) said You're Beautiful
sudden off-screen bark from   causes the pen to recklessly rocket across the written words
(
) God, come on Veronica
coolly pops the monocle from her eye before angrily addressing the amusingly robust, conventionally beautiful, trendily coiffed
What's your damage, Heather
You ruined my
God, 'm so sure
Don't blame me, blame Heather
She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto
Back me up, Heather
From behind   emerges a similarly trendily accessorized but noticeably more inhibited waif,
She is clutching a tattered copy of "The Catcher in the Rye
" Yeah, she really wants to talk to you
Okay, 'm going, 'm going
Jesus
, flanked by   and  , strides into the lunchroom pandemonium
The stunning   turns from the tray before her toward her incoming comrades
She is dressed stylishly and expensively but not trendily; her hair, dramatically tied back
(submissively) Hello, Heather
Pulling out a crumpled piece of yellow paper, smiles
The content of what Heather says is consistently offensive but the tone in which she speaks is sexy, dangerous, and mysterious
She is a mythic bitch
Veronica
Finally
Got a paper of Kurt Kelly's
need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in Kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray
Shit, Heather
don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock
You don't have anything for her either
Come on, it'll be Very
The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks
'll think about it
(looking off) Don't think
Unattractive and quite overweight,  / guiltily plops two jellos on her tray and clunks forward in line
's arm, seemingly involuntary, latches onto the outstretched pen
Splendid
'll dictate
Veronica needs something to write on
Heather, bend over
Both   and   bend over violently laughs
How nice
Two assholes: no waiting
and   stand erect, embarrassed
Heather Duke, back down
scurries to the contorting
Dear Martha, you're so sweet
' The traditionally handsome  , the serene black and the massive  sit with other stereotypical Jocks taking in  and the
It'd be so righteous to be in a Veronica Sawyer-Heather Chandler sandwich
Punch it in, Ram
and  raise their right arms and slam their fists together
Hell yes
wanna set a Heather on my Johnson and just start spinning her like a fucking pinwheel

Shit
Right
Damn right right
In slow motion,  finishes the note and rises up along with her makeshift desk,
hawkishly gazes toward the cafeteria line
hands the note to an impressed
/ pays the  and then, grasping her lunch tray with both paws, moves toward and the
excitedly tugs on  ' arm as approaches
With a tranquil smile, passes the note to her frantic disciple
In a self-consciously clandestine manner, saunters past  then wields around to sneakily tuck the note onto 's tray
The slow motion concludes as their plump victim shuffles past a magnetic preppie   and a thin, black, bespectacled
The guys are working a large stand which has a cashbox reading    and a banner reading
Come on people, let's give that leftover lunch money to people without lunches
Those tater tots you threw away today are a delicacy in Africa
They're Thanksgiving dinner
' The Girls reach their table with   and sitting themselves down first
(looking to the stand) God, aren't they fed yet
Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa
(low key sarcasm) Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent
draws up a clipboard
Sawyer
Guess what today is
Ouch
the lunchtime poll
So what's the question
Yeah, so what's the question
God-damn Heather, you were with me in Study Hall when  thought of it
Such a pillowcase
(hurt) forgot
and   briskly bop away from the table as a wounded   retreats to The Catcher in the Rye
Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last
Shut up, it is
told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, 'd spew burrito chunks
shakes her head and looks off
She's suddenly captured by the sight of a    sitting stark in a long, tan gunslinger coat, behind a Rebel Without a Cause lunchbox
They make eye contact
Transfixed,  crashes into seated  , a slightly overweight, unstylishly dressed sweetie surrounded by clones
Sorry Veronica
Betty Finn
Gosh
crouches down, embarrassed and rueful
'm really sorry  couldn't make it to your birthday party last month
That's okay
Your Mom said you had a big date
Heck, 'd probably skip my own birthday party for a date
gently laughs at 's innocent awe
Don't say that
Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what  dug up the other day
pulls from her purse a picture showing a , arm-in-arm, dressed in Halloween costumes:  is an angel,  is a witch
glows at the photo until   tows away causing the picture to fall face up on the floor
was talking with someone
Color me impressed
thought you grew out of Betty Finn
' coolly coed cabal of Country Club Kids icily eye the approaching  and
Country Club kid  sourly speaks out
Oh great
Here comes Heather
' Shit
/' Alone at a table in the Siberia of the cafeteria, finishes a forkful of chicken
She spears her plate again and brings the fork up
The note is wedged inside it
' , Veronica in tow, hits the Country Club Kids with a salvo of false pleasantness, capped by a scowling smile
Hi Courtney
Love your blouse
Ooh, let me snare a tater
express elation in spite of yourself as delicately takes a tot and turns around to face inserts her finger in her mouth doing the "induce-vomiting" signal before devouring the tot and turning back around
Thanks

Totally blew my allowance

Now check this out
You win five million dollars from Publishers Clearing House, but on the same day Ed McMahon gives you the check, aliens land on earth and say they're going to blow up the world in two days
What would you do

That's easy
'd just slide that wad over to my father
He's like one of the top brokers in the state Wake up
In two days, Earth's going up like a Roman Candle
Crab Nebula City
Man, in two days, my dad could double my money
Triple it
If  got that money, 'd give it all to the poor
Every cent
You're beautiful
reaches into the Famine Fund Box and takes some bills
Dennis, my man, run over to Mickey 's and get me a Big Mac and some fries
But that's the Famine Fund money
Hey, even Bob Geldof's got to eat
If it makes you feel better, bag the fries, and nab yourself an Apple Pie

If you're going to openly be a bitch
(submissive) 'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people
Fuck me gently with a chainsaw
Do look like Mother Theresa
If  did, probably wouldn't mind talking to the Geek Squad
She points to a table of unfashionably dressed and coiffed students
Some wear glasses, some wear braces, some wear both
' The  react to being pointed at
Their boney leader splatters milk over himself
Did you see that
Heather Number One looked right at us
It must be love
confronts
Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna
Like  give a shit
They all want me, as a friend or a fuck
'm worshipped at Westerburg and 'm only a Junior
Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims
(giving in) Whatever
don't believe this
We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school
/' Her sweaty lips moving rapidly,  anxiously reads the note
' The nervous  fidget and roughhouse each other in an involuntarily immature reaction to their beautiful interviewers
No seriously, 'd probably go to the Pyrimads
With a girl
Where you going to get a girl, stud

Taking a hooker to the Pyramids on the last day of Mankind
You sentimental old fart
Geez, forget it
What about you Rodney

New haircut
New house
New home

The egg is gone

God, scan on Martha Dumptruck

This is the part  hate
The waiting

follows the leader
She calls out
Damn
and   march into the school parking lot toward four   (one female) hanging out on a car hood
The girls' conversation is heard in voice-over
(
) you Heather
Deep down all teenagers are the same
Didn't you see The Breakfast Club
' and   set themselves down with and her -
(
) Look at me
look great
'm the girl in the commercials and the videos

) What do  get out of being friends with losers
give them a piece of a winner and they stain me with loserness
Heavy Metaler  grins
You get five million dollars but some Martians are going to zap you in two days
You hear that, Clyde
That's got to be the most spooky-ass question 've ever heard
' daintily peeps up

We could invite guys ' sputters out some chicken to bellow

With taxes, 'd be only getting 3

Heavy Metaler  turns from his friend

Put a remote control bomb up its butt
When the lion starts tearing you up, press the bomb button
You and the lion die like as one
Two Heavy Metal lovers,  and , intertwined against the windshield blankly respond
Cool
and   continue their conversation chugging through another busy cafeteria lane
Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial
No one would buy Crest
Don't tell me
Crest would be stained with loserness
Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth

Oh God, here we go

She brakes against the Foodless Fund stand where   is hollering away

Hi Veronica five keeps the neighborhood alive
ten and you die without sen
wings a twenty dollar bill into the cashbox
(to Veronica) You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school
If  wasn't already the head of it, 'd want the same thing
'm sorry
What are you oozing about
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day
(slapping her knee) We made a girl want to consider suicide
What a scream
What a jest
Come on you jerk
You know you used to have a sense of humor
Combing their hair in the bathroom mirror, the speak in comically whining-and-pathetic imitations of Martha Dumptruck as  shakes her head with a half-smile

Grow up, Heather
Bulimia's so '86
Color me nauseous

Maybe you should see a doctor
Yeah, maybe
(
) Come on Heather
We want another look at today's lunch
Geez, don't listen to them
(
) Did she have the pie or the ice cream for dessert
(like a game show host) And the answer is holds up her copy of The Catcher in the Rye and makes a bizarrely defiant smile
Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put up with their bogus nonsense
Well, you better move Holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed

His name's Jason Dean
He's in my American History
Give me the clipboard
As  walks off,   oinks out some amusing sexual noises

Hello Jason Dean
Greetings and salutations
Call me Are you a Heather
No, a Veronica
Sawyer
This may seem like a stupid question
There are no stupid questions
If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they're blowing us up in two days, what would you do
(suavely) That's the stupidest question 've ever heard
' The  witness  and
Who does that new kid think he is with that coat
Bo Diddley
Veronica is into his act
No doubt
Let's kick his ass
Shit, we're seniors, Ram
Too old for that crap
Let's give him a scare though
' An intrigued

Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake
Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach
How very

) Later
Definitely
and  move into the exiting 's place

's plate
You going to eat this
What did your boyfriend say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio
Answer him dick
Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule
It seems to have an open door policy for assholes though, doesn't it
What did you say dickweed
'll repeat myself
gracefully stands, reaches into his coat, and pulls out a a
357 Magnum
He fires twice at the viewer
-- Croquet wickets have been set up in standard form
and the  stand at various positions in the yard holding different colored mallets next to matching balls knocks her ball through the middle wicket
God, they won't expell him
They'll just suspend him for a week or something
He used a real gun
They should throw his ass in jail
No way
He used blanks
All
really did was ruin two pairs of pants
Maybe not even that
(giggling) Can you bleach out urine stains
knocks her red ball into  ' green one
You seem pretty amused
thought you were giving up on high school guys
Never say never
What are you going to do, Heather
Take the two shots or send me out
The Girls look to the doelike   with incredulous faces
Did you have a brain tumor for breakfast
First you ask if you can be red, knowing that 'm always red
places her foot on her red ball
She swings her mallet down hard on the red ball sending the adjacent green one rocketing into a flower bed
Shit
's next shot falls short of the next wicket
(to  ) Damn
It's your turn Heather
No, it's Heather's turn
hits her ball through a wicket and squeals
Anyway,  can say never to high school

King David
Maybe when you hit maturity you'll understand the diff between a Remington University man like David and a Westerburg boy like Ram "Wham-bam- thank-you-maam" Sweeney
misses her next shot
Ram's sweet
Yo Heather, you're up
tries to navigate a shot from the flower bed
No way, no day
Give it up girl
As her friends howl,   slams her ball out of the flower bed
The ball bounces off a tree and amazingly goes through a wicket
squeals in delight
Holy shit God, that was unbelievable
What
Shot
's next shot falls short of the next wicket
begins setting up her shot
So tonight's the night
Are you two excited
'm giving Veronica her shot
Her first Remington Party
Blow it tonight girl and it's keggers with kids all next year
(missing her shot) Crap
So who's this Brad guy 've been set up with
Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant
Don't worry
David says he's very so he's very
again hits her ball into  '
Why
Why not
slams  's ball back into the flower bed
'  calls out the back screen door
Heather, your Mother's here
Come on whoever wants a ride
As the  head into the house,  picks up ' ball and exuberantly throws it back toward the wickets
Veronica's , carrying a tray of pate, and , carrying a Robert Ludlum book, place themselves around a patio table
Take a break Veronica, sit down
All right
sinks into the empty middle deck chair
So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like
don't know, it was okay,  guess
Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up

Any contestants worth mentioning
May be There's kind of a dark horse now in the running
(looking up) Goddamn
Will somebody please tell me why  read this spy crap
(smiling) Because you're an idiot
Oh yeah, that's it
immediately returns to reading with a wide grin
(shaking her head) You two
Great pate, but 'm going to have to motor if  want to be ready for the party tonight
7-11-- Volkswagen Cabriolet pulls up in front of a 7-11 with at the wheel
pops out of the car, into the store
clamors to her
Corn nuts
7-11 Stylishly dressed-to-massacre,  reaches out to a bag of Corn Nuts as
's off-screen voice disarms her
(
) You going to pull a Big Gulp with that
No, but if you're nice 'll let you buy me a Slurpee
You know your 7-11speak pretty well
've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11
Any town, any time,  can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel
Keeps me sane
Really
That thing in the caf today was pretty severe
The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe
Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee
didn't
Cherry
smiles at her Coolness
returns the smile
7-11 and

's ferocious motorcycle
Great bike
sounds her car horn with a grimace
glares at her then turns back to
Just a humble perk from my Dad's Construction company or should say Deconstruction company

Moving place to place
Everybody's life's got static
Is your life perfect
(gently joking) Sure, 'm on my way to a party at Remington University
grows serious as the car horn sounds again
It's not perfect
don't really like my friends
don't really like your friends either
It's like they're just people work with and our job is being popular and shit
Maybe it's time for a vacation
The car horn blares again

Music pounds the door
The semi-handsome  leans aainst a desk while a talks with   who sits on the floor
Throw your coats on the bed, girls
That exam was so bogus
Oh know Which exam
Veronica, this is Brad
Excellent
Did you girls bring your partying slippers
Yeah, let's party
She loves to party
As they head out the door,  whispers something in ' 's ear causing the pair to snarl off a laugh
' -- The viewer is taken back and forth from a shattered post-party to the traumatic dormitory party itself
The sobbing monocled  writes at her desk
(
) Dear Diary,  want to kill and you have to believe
damn pen
frenziedly scribbles, trying to get her pen to write
She throws the pen across the room and pulls out another
(
) You have to believe it's for more than selfish reasons
More than a spoke in my menstrual cycle
You have to believe me
The chaotic hallway rumbles with beer cups and loud music
and  's stylish garb clashes with the laid-back dress of the
anxiously hands  a cup of beer as he watches and   move through a staircase door
So, are you a cheerleader
(dealing with a jerk) No, not at all
You're pretty enough to be one
Gee, thanks
It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major
"  hate that
They uncomfortably sip their beers
deadly pause ensues
So when you go to college, what kind of subjects do you think you'll study
' and  sit on the latter's bed, surrounded by a Macintosh and a series of obnoxious Ferrari posters
They kiss
doing most of the work
Come on David, let's go back to the party
(unzipping his pants) Don't worry, we will
You're just so hot tonight
can't control myself
pushes  's head down
has given up on conversation
So what do you say we head up to my room and have a real party

Brad-man, Robinson's looking for you
He says he owes you for blow and he just got some product himself
You're kidding
That pecker actually scored something on his own

Party up

) Seventeen is the last year Mom buys the Twinkies
When you make the jump from working weekends at Pizza Hut to thirty years at

Not innocence--power

) Christ,  can't explain it, but 'm allowed an understanding that my parents and these Remington University assholes have chosen to ignore understand  must stop Heather
"" Panting,  collapses at a desk in the "coat" room
She draws a Vodka bottle from a stockpile of liquor and pours some in her beer cup, slouching down in her chair
lights a match from a 7-11 matchbook
She eerily brings her hand closer and closer to the fire until it touches
With an eek of pain, she tosses the match away into the Vodka cup, setting it afire
laughs to herself before tossing the flaming cup out the window
The flaming cup lands in a large rusted garbage can filled with other cups and various refuse
The flames spread
dejected   walks into a multi-mirror-and-sink bathroom
Using a glass off one of the sinks, she gargles some water and then spits it at her own reflection

Save the speeches for Malcom

She notices an incited slither to the smiling  who chats with some ,   on his arm

What's your damage

No
Hell no

She flings herself down off-screen with some ugly retching sounds
' savagely scrawls in her diary, tears burning fierce

) Betty Finn was a true friend and sold her out for a bunch of Swatchdogs and Diet Cokeheads
Killing Heather'd be like offing the Wicked Witch of the West

In back of , the trashcan bellows like Mt
Vesuvius
You stupid cunt
You goddamn bitch
The flickering flames cast   in a demonic light

She seems ready to burst out all her anxieties but instead
Sure
But 'm Blue
-- The viewer's viewpoint glides through the grass of Veronica's backyard uncovering combinations of wickets and articles of clothing
pair of girls shoes and a pair of guys shoes rest together by the first wicket
(
) Goddamn, no wonder you looked so mangled when  came through the window
Feminine socks and masculine socks lay crumpled by the next wicket
(
) 've always treated Heather's teen queen power plays as bullshit
As  quiveringly pauses, a stylish blouse and a rugged shirt are revealed mingling by another wicket
(
) But 'm really scared
Who am  going to eat lunch with on Monday
sound like an Afterschool Special
The viewer's viewpoint moves to a dress and a pair of jeans resting side by side at another wicket
(
) That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know
thank you
(
) You're welcome
It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set
' blue mallet has been staked into the ground
Her panties hang on one end,
's underwear hangs on the other
(
) Well,  don't know
There's something to be said for
Ouch
and
are finally revealed, entangled in an artful pose upon
's gunslinger coat
They warmly kiss
breaks off to uneasily giggle
What a night
gently bites in to 's neck
grooves on it, closing her eyes tightly
What a life
almost moved into high school out of sixth grade because was some genius
We all decided to chuck the idea because 'd have trouble making friends, blah-blah-blah
slides her head down against
's chest and gracefully rests on his lap
Gently fighting slumber, she murmurs up to
, who showers her face with slow kisses
Now blah-blah-blah is all  do

to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew
Some genius
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die
Killing her won't solve anything
well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift
Well then, 'll pray for rain
See the condoms in the grass over there
We killed tonight, Veronica
We murdered our baby
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky
Just saying it's not hard to end a life
There's a big difference between the most popular girl in the school and dead sperm
They laugh
maneuvers herself into a sitting position
guess  don't know what the hell 'm talking about
know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about
Let's just grow up, be adults, and die
Good plan
But before that, 'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out
' -- 's bedroom is lushly and expensively furnished with a glass coffee table as an eye-catching centerpiece
half-sleeps in twisted bedsheets as
sticks her head in the door
We are leaving soon for your grandmother's
If you care to join us
Bag that
Is that a "No" in your lingo
As the door closes,   raises her arm and gives her departed Mother "the finger
" Lingo this

She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover
Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue

opens the cupboard beneath the sink
What about orange juice and milk
What's the upchuck factor on that
holds up a bottle of Pine-Sol
'm a Pine-Sol man, myself
Don't be a dick
That stuff'll kill her
and
make queasy eye-contact
descends back into the refrigerator with some worked-up enthusiasm as suavely pours bits of various toxic containers (detergent, scouring powder) into a glass beer mug
-kay
We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke
Sick, eh
Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon
Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit
say we go with Big Blue
raises the glass filled with what is now a strange blue liquid
stares at the glass, scared by her own thoughts
What are you doing You just can't go
Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that
Okay we'll use this
She won't be able to tell what she's drinking
pulls down a ceramic cup and triumphantly pours the poisonously blue beer glass contents into it
An eerie pause ensues
takes out a milk carton and a container of orange juice
She struts back to the counter in anger, icily muttering
Just give me a cup, jerk
sheepishly pulls down an identical ceramic cup tears it from him and pours some milk and then some orange juice into the cup
Milk and orange juice
Hmmmm
Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something
Yeah, great
They both start coughing harshly
No luck
Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely
Quite nicely
Chick-en
You're not funny
turns on his heel and slinks away
glares down at the mess of toxic containers
With both arms,  clumps the toxic containers together and drops beneath the sink to put them away

Not the one with milk and orange juice in it

Morning, Heather
Like a lion,   rouses herself up
Veronica
And Jesse James
Quelle surprise
Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night
Did we
How the hell'd you get in here
Veronica knew you'd have a hangover
So  whipped this up
Family recipe
holds out the ceramic cup

Did you put a phlegm globber in it or something
'm not drinking that piss
knew this stuff would be too intense
Intense
Grow up
You think 'll drink it just because you call me chicken They do
They're right
Just give me the cup, jerk

in anger
She takes the cup, slams her head back and downs it all
She then launches her head forward, her face contorted in agony
Corn nuts

Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup
No shit, sherlock

And your worst enemy

Oh jesus, 'm gonna

What are we going to tell the cops
"Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge
" Stop kidding around
'm going to have to send my
scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford

He scopes onto the rubble of the shattered coffee table and sees Cliff Notes for The Bell Jar plus a magazine proclaiming "     " sticking out from beneath 's body
We did a murder
In Ohio, that's a crime
But if this was like a suicide thing
Like a suicide thing
Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion
(calming down) can do Heather's handwriting as well as my own
takes some stationery from the desk and begins writing, calling out her words
"You might think what 've done is shocking
" "To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me
" That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad
" This is the last thing she'll ever write
She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss
She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right
That only proves my point more
The word is a badge for her failures at school
You're probably right
"People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun
Nobody understood  had feelings too
" " die knowing no one knew the real me
" That's good
Have you done this before

Heather Chandler's not your everyday suicide
She was very popular

The parents will be sympathetic, sir
These are troubled times for the young
must say  was impressed to see that she made proper use of the word "myriad" in her suicide note after brutalizing it in a vocabulary test
(dramatically cutting in) find it profoundly disturbing that we are told of a tragic destruction of youth and all we can talk about is adequate mourning times and misused vocabulary words

Oh Christ
The school, meaning both students and teachers, must revel in this revealing moment

Let us share together the feelings the suicide has spurred in us all

She drank Liquid Plumber and Comet and stuff then she smashed
Now, now, we're not here to rehash the coroner's report
Let's talk emotions - Are we going to be tested on this
stunned  glares until preppie   speaks
The note continues to be breathlessly passed around
Heather and  used to go together, but she said  was boring
realize now  wasn't really boring
She was just dissatisfied with her life
That's very good Peter
lets out a laugh that she disguises as a sob by putting her hands over her face
Dear Veronica, Heather was your soulmate
Share
Heather was cool, but cruel
The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness
The class stares to  as the suicide note is passed to her
She acknowledges it in horror, passes it on, then continues, realizing her ability to create truths for a captive audience
She realized the only way she could be happy was to give up her power and the only way she could do that was death

Hi Guys
came to check on this week's lunchtime poll topic
Don't worry about it, Veronica, sit down
That funeral yesterday must have been really rough
Oh
Sure
We were, uh, wondering if maybe you had some poems or artwork that Heather did that we could put in the Heather Chandler yearbook spread

Shut up, Courtney
Don't shut up
'd like to know just what  did

Hi, Kurt
This is Veronica Sawyer didn't expect to be calling either guess my emotions took over

It's always been a fantasy of mine to have two guys at once
Sure, you can write Penthouse Forum

Don't forget Ram

Get crucial
We won't be using blanks this time
You can't be serious
Hey listen, my Bonnie-and-Clyde days are over

With a patient smile,
pulls her back down
Do you take German
French
flicks open his gun and pulls a bullet from the chamber
These are Ich Luge bullets
My grandfather snared a shitload of them in
Two
They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm
So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding
nods then stands to pace the room, his mind whirring
We shoot Kurt and Ram
Make it look like they shot each other
By the time Kurt and Ram regain consciousness, they'll be the laughingstock's of the school
The note's the punchline
How'd it turn out
clumsily extracts the note from her purse
She also plucks out the crumpled yellow sample of Kurt's handwriting of the opening note-forge scene
She proudly displays both papers
First tell me this similarity is not incredible
(warmly) Incredible similarity
pulls back the note and reads
Ram and  died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world
The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown
Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole
Exquisite, but  don't think ununderstanding is a word
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent
Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people
mean it was World War Two, not a school play
(rapid-fire) They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead
Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce
Neat
Let's try it out on

Uh well hey, let's take a look at the homosexual artifacts  dug up

What about you

Oh
Good idea

Three
almost non-chalantly shoots  in the forehead
rips out her gun and swings it toward
Using both hands, she fires, but misses completely
runs away onto the path
throws down her gun with a smile
Shucks
races to  in a white sweat
Did you miss him completely
(giggling) Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on
Don't move
'll get him back

Suddenly trembling and confused, she watches
bolt into the woods
panicked  runs on the path through the woods
, with a cold efficiency, weaves through trees

sees the opening at the end of the woods
suddenly moves into the light at the end of the woods and raises his gun

approaches Ram's body with increasing shivers
He does not look bleeding and unconscious
He looks bleeding and dead, dead, dead
barrels into the clearing as
howls from the woods
Now
In a burst of frightened, animal instinct,  whips around and fires her gun right into 's chest
Two cops,  and McCORD, smoke marijuana in a squad car already filled with smoke
After a coughing fit,  shouts

McCORD Wha
Another gunshot
From the woods
McCORD Shit, let's roll

Kurt doesn't look too good
Remember he's left-handed
quivering  puts the gun in 's left hand

) Keep going until you hit the clearing

Call in
looks toward where  and
ran out
heard something out there
'm checking it out

McCORD This is Officer McCord and 've got two dead bodies in the woods behind Westerburg High
Oh my God, one of them's Kurt Kelly, the quarterback

and
reach the car, panting
races out of the woods just as  and
slam the car doors closed behind them
huffs up the hill
and
somersault into the backseat and begin taking off their clothes
continues to move up the hill
and
, stripped down to their underwear, embrace
approaches the car and peers in
His crackling walkie- talkie startles him
McCORD (
/walkie-talkie) Milner, can you hear me
What's going down
moves away from the car, then speaks into his walkie-talkie
Think what  heard was just a stinking owl
All  got is two kids making out in the backseat of a car
Should  pry them apart
McCORD (
/walkie-talkie) Forget it
got all the answers back here, partner
Seeing the cop move away
and
stop kissing
They catch their breath, smile, then continue passionately necking
runs back into the clearing
What's the deal
McCORD Suicide
Double Suicide
They shot each other
That's Kurt Kelly
McCORD Yeah, and the linebacker, Ram Sweeney
Oh my God, suicide
Why
McCORD Does this answer your question
McCORD reaches in the feminine shopping bag and pulls out the bottles of Perrier water
Oh man, they were fags McCORD Listen up, "We could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world
" Ah Jesus
Fuck
Kurt was a Parade magazine Honorable Mention
shakes his head slowly then suddenly looks up
Wait a second
How did they shoot each other if we heard two separate sets of gunshots
McCORD Shit,  always hear gunshots when 'm high

So it's come to this
(turning to the viewer) Heather Chandler did polls
want you to do a Petition, as a favor, as the favor
Do you know the group Big Fun
sits at the desk opposite him torching the manilla envelopes (photographs) with a butane lighter
; '
(post-chortle) Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom
It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock
flips across a stack of blank, connected computer printout sheets
At the top is a small paragraph and the word
blows ashes off her desk and grabs it, giggling
'll get right on it coach
And hey, a little gift
won't be needing it
twirls her copy of Catcher in the Rye to a pleased
-- gothically ascends a staircase, holding the petition
She stops, arms raised high, to bathe in the sunlight blasting through the staircase window
-- , petition in hand, sashays toward the Country Club Kids table
Oh great
Here comes Heather
' Shit
-- chirps to a schoolbusful of various
-- The provocatively dressed Petitioner charms a bleacher of Jocks
continues to bizarrely bathe in the sunlight of the staircase window
-- Now in Heavy Metal gear,   slams down the petition atop a booth of Metalheads
- --                                   139 Decked out in denim,   vanishes into the Stoner Hallway smoke, with the petition
further writhes in the sunlight until 's perplexed voice cuts into her bliss
(
) Heather
brings down her arms and the petition and turns to , revealed to be descending down the steps
Veronica
Color me stoked, girl
've gotten everyone to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags
People love me
(giggling) My God, you haven't signed
People love you but  know you
Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria
And Doug Hylton
(verbally winking) So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others
(happiness evaporating) Hey, just sign the petition
Don't talk to me like that
It was
's idea
He made out the signature sheet and everything
Now will you sign it
(queasy) No
Jealous much
slaps   with all her might
Heather, why can't you just be a friend
Why are you such a MegaBitch
Because  can be
The same fucking cheek, goddamnit
Why are you pulling my dick
Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made her Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends
No way
Uh-Uh
stumbles down the stairs
's voice cuts into 's concentration
(
) Wanna go out tonight
grimly turns to see a smirking, descending
Catch a movie
Miniature Golf
(jokingly but caustically) was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide
could be up for that
've already started underlining meaningful passages in Heather's copy of Catcher in the Rye, if you know what  mean
So are we on
somberly steps forward to
, grabs his elbows, then pulls him gently, seemingly for a kiss
She spits in his face and bolts down the stairs, calling up to him
It's over,
Over
don't get it
You were wrong
was right
Strength, damnit
Come back
-- Intensely clutching her schoolbooks,  walks through the front door into the living room where  and  sit with aggressively compassionate faces
is a bit confused
Yes
and  glance at each other before  speaks
Your friend Jason Dean just stopped by
He seemed very concerned about you
He said he thinks you might try to kill yourself
You have been depressed lately
Oh, he said this is for you
holds out an envelope
nabs it and rips it open
The note reads, in feminine manuscript:
Oh my God
runs off, her mother's voice trailing behind her
(
) He says we should keep you away from sharp objects, closed garages, toxic
' vaults through her bedroom door
Barbie doll wearing a BigFun -shirt hangs from a noose
With a whimper, she swerves away from it and dives onto her bed
-- laconically leans against his motorcycle with his legs suavely crossed
He looks up to Veronica's bedroom window and hears another whimper emerge
He puts a cigarette in his mouth and lights it with a smile
' curls into a fetal position on her bed and closes her eyes
tighter and tighter as
's voice
(
) "You can't ever find a place nice and peaceful because there isn't any
" flops around to see
kneeling over her on her bed reading Heather Duke's copy of The Catcher in the Rye
Nice
It's got that Catcher-in-the-Ryey- -hate-the-world-and-the-world-hates-me- so-let's-commit-suicide ambience
Give it a try, underline something
giddily underlines words then slides into a prone position, tossing the book to an enraged
Get off my bed, you sick psycho
You think you're a rebel
You're not a rebel
You're a sick psycho
Do you think you're a rebel
Do you think you're a rebel
wanna know
"You say tomayto,  say tomahto
Let's call the whole thing off
Hold it
freezes and
reaches up to her hand where she holds the Catcher in the Rye
Her index finger is curled into the book
Sitting up,
carefully opens the book at that place and peers in
Look at that
Eskimo
One word love it
usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto
Eskimo
So mysterious
Wait a
You're not listening
'm not on your side
obliviously underlines the word then pulls the flailing up like an enthusiastic camp counselor
-- The sound of a lock being jimmied is heard moments before and
burst through the door
moves to the dishwasher and opens it like a burglar opening a safe
You're still not listening
'm not
(pulling out the knife) Nag, nag, nag, nag
nag
(taking the knife from him) This knife is filthy
What in the hell do you think 'm doing
Taking out her tonsils
think  know Heather a bit better than you, okay
If she was going to slash her wrists, the knife would be absolutely spotless
grabs a dishtowel and vigorously wipes off the knife
How's this
Can you see your fucking reflection
She can and so can the viewer
Tears well in 's eyes
She begins to shudder, a shattered smile quaking on her face
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place
That person could be me
(suddenly deliriously defiant) Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think 'm doing another suicide note
(laughing) You don't get it, do you
Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself
We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting
tears his gloves off with a giggle
He takes a pen from the kitchen counter and paper from a cutesy memo pad
He shoves the pen in 's hand and grabbing her hand, forces her to scribble   on the paper
Perfecto
Man, 've even got a marked-up Catcher in the Rye
What else does a suicide need
pulls out the copy of the Catcher in the Rye and opens a door revealing  , asleep in an artful pose on a couch,  images from the
flashing against her
(raising the knife) If you'll excuse me
No-o
hops in the adjoinging room and slams the door races to the door wailing
She maniacally rattles the doorknob trying to open the locked door
The sound of the rattling doorknob subtly turns into wild African music thundering on the soundtrack as  , in a
screen, maniacally addresses the viewer
shiny number 4 flashes on and off in the corner
/ -- In speeded-up imagery, , , and the manuever pictures of  , , , and in mind-bogglingly countless ways in order to accomodate them all on the same two page layout
-- With even more speeded-up imagery, four  wearing "What a Waste, Oh the Humanity" -shirts toss out tons of black armbands into a hungry crowd
-- The wild African music and the speeded up imagery slams to a halt at the sigh of   lying serenely in a coffin
wearing dark sunglasses and a terrifying toupee, walks in front of her to address a sizable group of  and sitting in foldout chairs before him dramatically looks over the crowd before finally speaking
Eskimo
lets the word hang in the air, then holds up the copy of The Catcher in the Rye
Heather Duke underlined a lot of things in this copy of The Catcher in the Rye, but  believe the word Eskimo, underlined all by itself is the key to understanding Heather's pain
stands in a corner with an "Oh brother" look on her face
On the surface, Heather Duke was the vivacious young lady we all knew her to be
But her soul was in Antartica, freezing with the knowledge of the way fellow teenagers can be cruel, the way parents can be unresponsive, and as she writes so eloquently in her suicide note, the way life can suck
We'll all miss Sherwood's little Eskimo
Let's hope she's rubbing noses with Jesus
moves next to  holding a plate of steaming spaghetti
She is wearing nerdy glasses and something that looks like an intergalactic prison unifrom
Is this turnout weak or what
had at least seventy more people at my funeral
Heather
Wha
Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring
If  have to sing "Kumbaya" one more time
What are you doing here
made your favorite
Spaghetti
Lots of oregano
With a squeal,   plunges 's face into the plate of spaghetti
Dinner
' -- Uncurling from the fetal position that she had fallen asleep in, 's tightly closed eyes snap open in a sweat as her mother's voice continues to filter through the door
It's all been a dream
(
) Dinner
Veronica
Dinner
closes her eyes and holds her heart
She suddenly launches to her desk, opens her diary, shoves on her monocle, catches her breath, and begins writing
(
) Dear Diary, no one can stop
Not the
, the
, or the
That is to say, no one but me
know where
is coming from and where he is heading
He's wrong, but 'm going to teach him what's right
'm going to stop
If it's the last thing do
leans back in her chair, sweating
She reaches in the pocket of a blazer draped over the back of the chair and pulls out the cigarette
had given her eariler in the film
She puts it in her mouth unlit then takes it out and puts it back in the blazer
-- remains laconically leaning against his motorcycle with his legs suavely crossed as he was before Veronica began dreaming
finishes his cigarette and pulls out a gun
He checks the bullets, puts the gun back in his coat, and heads toward the house
' hugs
the cat then rips down the hanging Barbie
leans a ladder against the Sawyer house
sets down three plates of spaghetti
watches on
Does she want a written invitation
(yelling upward) Veronica
Dinner
' crawls through 's window
Hanging from the rafter, neck in a noose of bedshoots, is
sets a glass of milk at 's place, distressed
Honey
' paces the room, sweating and ranting, waving a gun in one hand, the Barbie doll in the other
can't believe you did it
was teasing
loved you
Sure,  climbed up here to kill you, but first  was going to try and get you back
With amazing petition
throws the gun on the bed and pulls from his coat the computer printout sheet petition, then savagely rolls it out on the floor
It is filled with signatures of different sizes, styles, and colors
blinks
It's a shame you can't see what our fellow students really signed
flicks open a switchblade
He runs the blade beneath the typed paragraph at the top causing it to peel off, reavealing another typed paragraph
Listen
"We students of Westerburg High will die
Today
Our burning bodies will be the ultimate protest to a society that degrades is
Fuck you all
" Not that subtle but neither's blowing up the school
Talk about your suicide pacts
When our school explodes tomorrow, it's going to be the kind of thing that infects a generation Woodstock for the 80's
Damn, we coulda toasted marshmallows together
(
) Honey, are you all right in there
swiftly picks up the petition and heads out the window
enters the room and, seeing her hanging daughter, launches into frantic screams
Oh God,  knew it
No, no
want my baby back
should have let you keep that job at the mall
was just afraid of you coming home alone at night
opens her eyes
made your favorite
Spaghetti
Lots of oregano
undos the noose around her neck but still remains hanging for the rope runs all the way down her back beneath her blazer and is tied around her waist
She undos the waist- knot and lands on her bed
She quickly puts a small pillow over the left-behind gun, unnoticed by her dazed
Hey Mom, why so tense
Montage music plays as  rears up from her dinner plate to see her stonefaced  and her  staring at her
' -- tools with a bomb at his desk
on the door
turns down his stereo (and the Montage music)

) need some help with my homework
Sorry tiger, 'm a little busy
turns back up his stereo (and the Montage music)
-- The Montage music continues as school buses arrive in front of the school
pour out
-- come out of their cars
-- Typically hectic start-of-another-day-opening-and-slamming-of- locker-action
darts through the thoroughfare to her locker
passing   screeches to a halt, grabbing as she chokes on some styrofoam cup coffee
Veronica
told me you committed suicide last night
Where is he
Where's
We have to talk
Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make
Get a job
storms away to her nearby locker
She swirls her locker combination and opens it
She glances down the hall and freezes
In the distance,
moves mechanically down the hallway carrying a large gym bag, wearing a Walkman
climbs into her locker
She closes it until it is barely perceptibly ajar
strides past the locker and into the Boys bathroom
smoothly moves into a stall and closes the door
He turns off his Walkman and ends the Montage music
The hallway slowly clears as  go to class
The bell rings
races through the empty hallway
carefully hatches out of her locker
She treads down the hallway as if something were about to jump out at her
group of cheerleaders including   are lazily doing cartwheels on the gym floor
On a small stage set up beside them, other  are putting up folding chairs
says "Testing" into a microphone
, toting the gym bag, quietly opens the gym door and slips inside
He swiftly moves unnoticed to a position underneath the bleachers
peers around a corner to see an empty hallway
Using heavy black masking tape,
tapes a thermal bomb to a steel support beneath the bleachers
Other thermal bombs can be discerned taped to other supports
cautiously treads down the empty hallway, trying to keep in control
Suddenly, packs of  burst from classroom doors behind
The excited swarms of move toward and past , who has braked her troubled treading to stiffly contemplate her passing peers
She latches onto Geek  in a panic
looks down at his clutched arm with a nervous smile
Rodney, where's everybody going
It's Friday
Oh my God, the damn pep assembly
Yeah, these things are pretty artificial, but at least we all get out of class
ignores 's amiable attemots at conversation to inquisitively move forward through the crowd
darts from out underneath the bleachers to the gym doors
He pops the doors open and sees the crowd of  move toward the gym
He suavely pauses then dashes down a nearby set of stairs
continues to tensely surf the tidal wave of heading for the gymnasium
She stops to watch her classmates file into the gym like lemmings with increasing sense of dread
She again latches onto a passing
Rodney, what's underneath the gym
(unconsciously) dramatically stops, turns to
and says
The boiler room
blanches then lunges through the crowd
She topples a couple disgruntled  before careening down the staircase beside the gym
walks by the firm glass windows of the boiler room, eyeing the pounding generators inside
He stops at a heavy steel door
Placing down his gym bag,
proceeds to swiftly pick the lock
He swings open the steel door
(
) May  see your hall pass
weilds around
sweating  moves toward him, pointing the bedroom gun at him
knew that loose was too noose mean, noose too loose
Goddamn you
Like father, like son
serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs
Okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground
looks down at the gym bag already on the ground
He folds his arms and smiles
forcefully moves closer
Okay, okay
knew that
knew that
Put your hands on your head
You didn't say Simon Says
suddenly kicks out into 's stomach, doubling her over and causing her to drop the gun
gracefully retrieves it
The pep assembly is in full swing with rowdy  in the bleachers earthily shouting, giggling cheerleaders making swaying pyramids, valiant band members struggling to be heard
Various Jocks, including , stand on the stage with as a   flashes away
bends over quivering and clutching her bruised ribs
raises the gun to her head
Live by the sword
swings her left arm up knocking
's gun hand upward
She then sails her right fist into his face
The blow annoys him more than it hurts him but
's momentary loss of composure allows  to come in with another much harder right hook
The blow sends
stumbling back against the boiler room, jarring the gun loose
They simultaneously lunge for the gun
, having the better grip, pulls so forecfully that after wrenching the gun from
, she loses control of it, flinging it down the hall
pops up to retrieve it but
moves his legs scissors-style around her and trips her
The assembly mindlessly blares on
Cheerleader rah-rah-rahs
and the other Geeks pass around a pair of opera glasses, all intensely scoping out the cheerleaders
group of  toke away beneath the bleachers, one of them lackadaisically leaning against a thermal bomb
snarling
stands up, pulling  with him
You think just because you started this thing, you can end it
violently kisses/bites
While kissing, sees a fire alarm on a nearby wall
She closes her eyes then savagely knees
in the groin
bolts to the alarm and pulls it down
Nothing happens
gasps
You, really didn't think 'd, forget, forget, to disconnect the
rockets her body down and picks up the gun
grabs her and throws her against the steel boiler room door
jostled  raises the gun
howls then bounds toward , causing them both to careen down the steel steps of the boiler room
At the same time, he inadvertently kicks the gym bag/bomb down along with them
The gun spins from 's hand and slides away
The bomb flies out of the bag onto the boiler room floor
digital clock on the bomb clicks on at 5:00
4:59
4:58
The frenzied pep assembly crowd is now doing "The Wave" and her similar co-horts deliriously get into the act, all sit in a circle at the bottom rows of the bleachers, pouting as  bounce up and down around them
and the other Jocks stand on the stage grinning and preening before the crowd
and
are in a heap at the bottom of the boiler room steps
faintly works into a semi-sitting position and gives an astonished glance to the bomb, its digital clock clicking to 3:00
crawls to the gun and levels it at a rousing-up
The bomb's gone on,
How do you turn it off
Tell me
Fully standing,
flicks open his switchblade
He gives "the finger," screaming in exploded saliva
Fuck you
Seething,  shoots up at
blowing off "the finger
" Shrieking in pain,
drops the knife to hold this sudden geyser of blood
achingly stands, pointing the gun
The bomb clicks down to 2:25
It's all over,
Help me to stop it
You want to wipe the slate clean as much as  do
Okay, so maybe  am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me
You have a purpose though
Remember
Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven
fires the gun at
's feet
The bomb clicks to 1:49
How do you turn the fucker off
You're not listening
People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school was society
Is that deep or what
'll let you put it in your diary, babe
Free of charge
The bomb, asshole
Just push the red button twice
That's what stops it
If that's what you want, babe
You know what  want, babe
What
fires the gun twice into
's throat
Coughing and moaning, he splatters against a generator
Cool guys like you out of my life
saunters to
's writhing body
But babe, don't worry, these here were Ich Luge bullets
closes his eyes and slumps to the ground
turns to the bomb and crouches over it
lit green light is next to a green button
Above it, an unlit red light is next to a red button
The bomb's digital clock clicks to 00:17 presses the red button twice, turning on the red light and stopping the clock
falls back into a sitting position and sorely exhales, tears streaming down her face
cheerleader does a cartwheel in slow motion as eerie music plays
The manic crowd in the bleachers vibrates in slow motion as well
At normal speed,  walks to the doors of the Gym and peers in
The panorama of roaring students, posing jocks, and prancing cheerleaders continues to unfold in slow motion
walks away from the gym
wearily pushes open the front door and emerges outside of the school
She closes her eyes to therapeutically bask in the sun's rays
slight smile trembles onto her face
strange voice kills it
(
) Color me impressed
stands starkly in the distance before her, blood spurting from his throat onto his gunslinger coat
He painfully speaks through his assasinated vocal cords
You really fucked me up, Veronica
(vertigo city) thought
you
You've got power, Veronica
Power didn't think you had
The slate is clean
pulls open his coat revealing that the bomb is attached to his torso
The green light is on and the clock says 00:10
00:09
Pretend  did blow up the school
All the schools
Now that you're dead, what are you gonna do with your life
takes the unlit cigrette from her blazer pocket and puts it in her mouth
She then folsd her arms
Perfecto
raises his arms in a crucifixion pose as the bomb clicks to 0:00
Nothing happens
An annoyed
breaks out of his crucifixion stance and raps the bomb with his palm
The sound of the bomb explosion plunges the cheering up-and- down pep assembly into chaos
Wailing students pour out of the bleachers screaming less out of fear than a "Whoa Dude" sense of excitement
stands in the same position in front of the school with her arms still folded
Only now her cigarette is lit and her face and clothes are blackened in ash
Flames flicker in bushes behind her
drags on the cigarette and turns to go inside
strolls into the school and into a hallway of howling students, some of whom are tearing down Prom banners for the thrill of it
rushes up to  and grimaces
Veronica, you look like hell
Yeah,  just got back
tosses away the cigarette
She then grabs by the shoulders and forcibly turns her around
What are you doing
Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town
takes off  's red ribbon and ties it around the hair of her own head
She kisses   on the cheek, leaving a black stain
calls off
Hey, Martha, wait up
/ revealed to be in an electric wheelchair, brakes to a stop and looks to Veronica, confused
walks up beside her
starts up her wheelchair and accompanies  away into a deserted hallway
My date for the prom kind of flaked out on me, so  thought if you weren't doing anything that night we could go to the video store and rent some new releases or something
Maybe pop some popcorn
'd like that
So would
