) (over a dark screen) All my life, 've lived and worked in the big city
We see: - The camera swoops towards the entrance, then dives inside, past a couple of tough-looking soldier ants who stand at the gates of the ant colony like insect bouncers
into an access tunnel that snakes this way and that, past a row of ants plodding along
and into the   of the colony, a huge, teeming vista that seems to stretch away forever, filled with ants rushing here and there on their business
We see -- a "traffic cop" directing foot traffic, waving his arms like crazy so both sides move at once -- a column of soldier ants marching along in formation -- a chain of ants letting down matchbox elevator filled with workers
(
) which is kind of a problem, since 've always felt uncomfortably in crowds
'  - We join , a worker ant with issues
He's lying on a couch, recounting his woes
feel
isolated
Different
've got abandonment issues
My father flew away when  was just a larva
My mother didn't have much time for me
when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention
(pause) feel physically inadequate -- 've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight
Sometimes think 'm just not cut out to be a worker
But  don't have any other options
was assigned to trade school when  was just a grub The whole system just
makes me feel
insignificant (enthusiastic) Terrific
You should feel insignificant
For the first time, we see the ant
He's a mixture of Tony Robbins and Ron Popiel (the hyperactive late-night  huckster, and founder of "Ronco")
should
(hopping around enthusiastically) You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy
" And  tell them it's mind over matter
don't mind that  don't matter Do you get it
Do you get it
gives a fake smile
(incredibly "up") , we're part of the fastest growing species in the whole world The counsellor rolls down a chart from the wall
An arrow shows ant population going up, up, up
Ask me why we're so successful
Why are we so successful
'm glad you asked me that question
The motivational counsellor opens some blinds
and we see a vista of the ant-filled chamber below
What do you see out there
Ants
Right
Ants
Millions of creatures, each with his assigned task, all pulling together
Down below, we see a group of ants carrying a boulder up an incline
One worker ants slips, and the boulder rolls down, crushing his leg
The other ants rush over -- it looks like they're going to help their fallen comrade, but instead, they climb right over him, and pick up the boulder, continuing with their task
You see
Being an ant is being able to say, "Hey -- 'm meaningless, you're meaningless
" But -- but 've always felt life was about finding meaning
and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love
The motivational counsellor puts his arm on 's shoulder
he seems to understand
you need help
(looking at a clock) Whoops
We're gonna have to stop there
Your minute is up
The counsellor ushers  out of his seat and towards the door
Now back to work
We've made real progress Remember -- let's be best superorganism we can be
- - gigantic tunnel, with the size and scale of the "Chunnel"
banner strung overhead reads: "The Mega-Tunnel -- Tunneling Our Way to a Bright Future
"  Along the walls hang 50's work- incentive style posters with messages like, "You asked for it, you got it -- more work
" and " "  Line after line of ants is working on the tunnel, digging, passing clumps of dirt from ant to ant, everyone synchronized
on a clump of  being passed from hand to hand
, a feisty, cynical, female worker ant, who stands there, waiting to pass the dirt on
is daydreaming behind her, with clumps of dirt starting to pile up in front of him
Hello
Earth to
You better snap out of it, or there's gonna be a lot of pissed off ants
looks back, and sees the ants behind staring at him angrily
(snapping out of it) Sorry Azteca
Here you go, fellas
Fresh dirt
Alley oop
(looking at the dirt) Shouldn't we be wearing gloves mean this dirt is very
dirty
Doesn't anyone think of hygiene
('s stomach growls) Boy am  hungry
'm so hungry 'm seeing double
It looks like there's two million ants in here
When's lunch
Tomorrow, or the day after
(sweetly) , old pal
(shouts) It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day
The squeaky wheel gets the oil
No,
The squeaky wheel gets thrown away , alright
You're a good ant, , even though you are a pain in my rear- segment
don't wanna see anything happen to you
So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble
Thank goodness
Breaktime
All the ants put down their tools
beat
Then the All the ants pick up their tools again
(resigned) Break's over
(getting back to work) This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground
Why are we even digging this thing
Who cares,
All  know is, we gotta dig
We're not the ones in charge
- The huge, spacious main chamber of the colony
Looming over the scene is the royal palace, which seems to be inaccessible, perched on top of a hill-like pedestal
Around the base of the pedestal, a crew of workers loiters, seemingly aimlessly
can these be the only unemployed ants in the place
The workers look up and
Then they start forming a stairway with their own bodies, linking arms, stepping on each other's shoulders
It's extremely unpleasant work
One ant is a little tardy, and just manages to get in place before
, the Pattonesque military leader of the colony,    , using it as the first step as he ascends to the palace, his aide-de-camp Carpenter in tow
As Formica mounts the "stairs"  we can hear the workers going, "
" etc
Cut the chit-chat down there
(turning to Carpenter) We've spoiled these workers, Carpenter
They've never had it so good, and listen to them -- always grumbling and complaining
Formica steps on the foot of one of the "stairway" ants, who muffles a yelp
Yes, sir
What have they got to complain about
Three square meals a day
Actually, sir, we've cut them down to three roughly rectangular meals a week
Don't give me statistics, Carpenter
know what 'm talking about
Formica and Carpenter have reached the top of the staircase
There, the two guard ants on either side of the massive throne room doors pull them open -- and one door hinge (to guard ant, while passing) Oil that, soldier
- The  is on her throne, her huge abdomen sprawled behind her
Ah
General Formica
Formica salutes and marches to her, Carpenter behind him
Note:  Throughout this scene, the Queen is giving birth repeatedly
Each birth is accompanied by a herald playing a short "Happy Birthday" fanfare on his trumpet
Mid-wife ants bring each baby to the Queen for inspection, who  a few words
The midwives put the babies on a moving bassinet- line, powered by ants on a treadmill
General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony
pains me
The thought of any of my children going hungry
(she shudders; then, to baby) Who's the cutest widdle worker
You are
Yes, you
Don't forget to brush your teeth
(to mid-wife) Ship 'er out
(back to Formica) What steps are you taking to remedy the situation
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory
Yes, what else
Please don't worry, your majesty
Leave the worrying to me
As you know, 'm not an ant of half- measures
don't pussyfoot around
This crisis is my number one priority, and  promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively
The Queen's attention is interrupted by another baby being put in her arms
(to baby) No snacking between meals
Off you go
(to Formica) Now -- what were we saying
(Oliver North-style) do not recollect, your majesty
Will that be all
Yes, General Formica
Carry on, my good man
don't know what we would do without you
Formica clicks his heels and bows his head
Carpenter bows low
Formica smartly about faces -- (
) General Formica
hurries through a second doorway, carrying a swatch book
Something about her sets her apart from the with her
Her tiara, probably
Formica tilts his head quizzically to Carpenter behind him
(sotto) Princess Bala, sir
Your fiancee
Princess
You look -- outstanding
Is there anything  can do for you
Well --  thought -- since we're getting married
it might be nice if we
got to know one another
Formica looks confused
Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General
It's just that -- well, 'm honored that you selected me, and everything, just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation
(uncomfortable) Conversation
yes
well
(to Carpenter) Wasn't she briefed
(holding up a baby) Look, General
darling baby soldier
(emotionally, to baby) Don't try to be a hero
Just make sure you come back in one piece
(handing it off) Next
(using the interruption) 'll take your suggestion under advisement, Princess
In the meanwhile -- Formica turns to go
General -- we have to talk sometime
Very well
Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship
Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule
We have thirty-six seconds available right now
Outstanding
Princess
Bala's a little fazed
but grabs her chance
So, um
how was your day
What did you do
(scouring his mind) Well
(that's it
) declared war
(sadly) Oh
and  was afraid we had nothing in common
(under his breath) Fourteen-fifty hours, sir
Duty calls
He strides across the floor
Bala watches him go, her antennae drooping unhappily
No squeak
Outstanding
We see through the now-open doors into the throne-room as Formica and Carpenter double-time out of the frame
The Queen sees that Bala is unhappy
(sympathetically) felt the same way before  got married
Confused
Scared
(hopefully) You did
Yes -- but  did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings
The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged
Even marriage
You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood
(unconvinced) Yes
he's wonderful
The doors swing shut on them -- revealing the two guard ants who were  in the wake of Formica's exit
'  - Bala enters, followed by her handmaidens, who are in a state of giggling infatuation over Formica
Bala is scowling as she leafs through a wedding catalogue
#1 (swooning over General Formica) The General's body segments are so
symmetrical
#2 (giggling) 'd let him order me into battle anyday
Bala hurls the swatch book against the wall
#1 Princess
What's wrong
Wrong
How could anything be wrong
'm going to marry General Formica and be a queen and have millions of babies, just like my mom
(concerned) Do  look fat to you
#2 (knowingly, to Handmaiden #2) Pre-wedding jitters
#1 You just need to blow off some steam
Let's go to the bar at the Royal Club
The Club's so stuffy want to try someplace different
#2 There isn't anyplace else -- (making a joke) Except the worker bar
The worker bar
Yes
That's where want to go
The handmaidens look shocked
#1 But -- we can't -- there'll be workers there
- long bar filled with ants
The bar itself seems to stretch for miles, and there are hundreds of ants trying to get a drink
unfortunately, there's only one bartender
is at the bar with , a burly ant soldier
We declared war again
(off Weaver's nod) Are you scared
(shrugs) 'll be back
The , a grizzled veteran, slaps down what looks like a couple of large green beer mugs
Actually, they're aphids, little green critters he fills up from a number of kegs hanging from the ceiling
The kegs are specialized ants with hugely distended stomachs, which spray liquid into the aphids
(as they're slapped on bar) Ouch
Ouch
Two aphid beers
(as Bartender leaves) Did you see that
How he gave you the beers, not me
'm telling you, he's got something against workers
don't know what you're talking about,
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers
You soldiers get all the glory
Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them
Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes
We can see that Weaver is eyeing a nearby table of "Worker Babes", including 's friend Azteca
Weaver, they're career girls
They're obsessed with digging
(sighs) No, 'll probably never meet the girl for me
Who said there was a girl for you
was talking about a girl for me
(quaffing his aphid beer) Don't you want your aphid beer
can't help it
have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature
Call me crazy
, we've known each other a long time, right
Of course
You were born two seconds after me
And all the time 've known you, you've been grumping and groaning
You should quit making waves
Go with the flow
Weaver, 'm an insect, not a liquid
Down the bar, there's a commotion
grizzled old  ant has had too much to drink
Have you been to Insectopia
Have you No, ya goddam larvas
But have
(becoming emotional) Mosquitos n' caterpillars n' beetles -- all livin' in peace, stuffin their guts with food
No rules, no regulations
you can be your own ant there
(howling drunkenly) It's Insectopia
Insectopia Hey, Weaver, listen
was cut off from my unit -- found it by mistake -- (slurring) It changed my life
(spraying another soldier with saliva) You see -- ya follow the great yellow egg, and you come to the land of red and white -- You've had enough for one night
Come on, Gramps, before you get in trouble
The soldiers pull him from the bar, carrying him out
(excited) Hey, did you hear what he said
Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions
- Princess Bala is peering in at the entrance to the ant bar, accompanied by her worried-looking handmaidens
#2 We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper
'm the Princess, aren't
#2 Of course -- And do Princesses do improper things
#2 Of course not -- Then if  go to the worker bar, it isn't improper
Anyway, don't worry
No one will recognize us in our disguises
She adjusts her "disguise", a hardhat, tied down Jackie
- style with an ant's version of a Chanel scarf
'm just a common worker, cooling off after a rough day
Music starts
An ant  takes the mic at one end of the dance floor
(on loudspeaker) Okay, folks
It's six-fifteen, and that means it's time to dance
Every ant gets up to dance
Weaver turns to
(draining his beer) Time to cut a rug,
'm not in the mood
(disgusted) Even when they're off work, they follow orders
Well, you just sit here and be a party-pooper
Weaver joins the rest of the ants who are lining up for the dance
The Barker calls out the steps in a bored monotone -- all the ants already know the steps
Everyone dances in perfect synch
(southern twang) And a left-right-quarterstep-back step-halfstep -- a left-right- quarterstep-backstep-halfstep -- a left-right-quarterstep-backstep halfstep -- , Bala smiles mischievously at her handmaidens
'm going to ask one of these mindless, primitive worker-types to dance with me
#1 But General Formica would be furious
(enjoying the idea) know
The handmaidens are appalled
Bala whirls away from them, sets her sights and searches the crowd -- zeroing in on -- , who's watching the other ants dance
What a bunch of losers
Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system -- Wanna dance
Bala's standing right there
is instantly smitten Me
Yes mean -- (regaining suavosity) Just let me finish my beer
Not breaking eye contact with Bala,  smiles suavely
Reaches suavely for a beer
Suavely grabs the candle in a glass jar off the bar
Suavely singes his face
He plays it off with a rakish little laugh
bit apprehensive, Bala heads onto the floor
follows her
So uh -- how come  haven't seen you around here before
(covering up) work in the palace,  don't get out much
The palace, hunh
bet those royals really live it up
Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding -- (shocked) What and Bala step onto the dance floor with the rest of the ants, but  can't do any of the steps
Now, let's see,  -- it's been a while since  --  think you -- Bala watches , trying to follow along
It's the blind leading the blind, as  tries in vain to follow the barker's rapid instructions
Here, 'll lead
starts doing his own, individual dance
With a suave expression on his face, he leads Bala in a helter-skelter mixture-of Tango, Charleston, and hand-jive
Are you sure this is a real dance
Well, actually, uh -- 'm sort of making it up -- (surprised) Really
Why should everyone dance the same way
It's as exciting as watching fungus grow
You're right
(surprised) You -- you think 'm right
Why can't  just do whatever  want to do
Why can't  just go wild
Yahoo
Bala starts to get into it, making up her own steps in reply to 's, loosening up, having fun
For a moment, the two of them are actually sexy together
Then they get a little too wild -- and the other ants, who are still doing their intricate dance, start to collide with Bala and
almost knocks over a big soldier ant
We can only see the ant's back at the moment
Hey
Watch your step, worker has turned around to see the soldier ant,  , glaring at him
Mandible is about twice 's size
He's got one eye missing, and half of his left antenna his been chewed off
You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up
(terrified) Oh, that's okay, 'll let him off this time
(whispering to Bala) Are you crazy
This guy's built like a pebble
(ineptly trying to placate the soldier) You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays -- Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself
's caught between a rock and a hard place
He doesn't want to get beaten up, but on the other hand, he doesn't want to lose face in front of Bala
More soldiers have gathered around, looking hostile
How come you don't dance like the rest of us
glances over at Bala
Then, shaking with nervousness, he says defiantly
Because -- because 'm an individual #2 An individual
Never heard of it
You look like a worker to me
Hey, lay off my little buddy
, meanwhile, looks far away, ecstatic, as if he's just realized something very important
Unfortunately, just at this moment,  soldier pushes Weaver
Weaver pushes him back
somebody makes a dive for  -- and before you know it, there's a regular bar brawl going on, with Weaver in the middle of it, cracking heads together, punching ants in the face, having a great time
Just then, the Princess' handmaidens hurries over
#1 Princess Bala
Princess Bala
, who's scrabbling around on the floor, overhears
Princess
You're a Princess #2 The police are coming Uh oh
(to ) Goodbye
Gotta run
Wait
When can  see you again
Let me think
Hmmnn
(thinks) Never
Bye
Bala rushes off with her handmaiden, just before a squad of whistle-blowing  wade into the crowd
Wait
Princess
Wait
But she's already gone, leaving  holding her scarf
: - is talking to Weaver, who's getting ready to go off to war
Nearby, columns of ant soldiers march by
Get real,
She just dropped the scarf by accident
Are you kidding
There were sparks between us
This scarf is a sign
It's a sign that you're crazy
Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is
What's gonna go wrong
take your place for the royal inspection
Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- bingo Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little
(wags his eyebrows suggestively) tea and crumpets
and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content
Weaver looks unconvinced
You have to help me
Please, Weaver
Think of all the things 've done for you
(thinks) can't think of any
(pause) Well 'm gonna start doing things for you
Will you introduce me to some worker girls
You bet
They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you
Maybe 'll get lucky
(Weaver thinks about it) You know, ,  wouldn't do this for anyone but you
Weaver hands  has helmet
Wear this
(overjoyed) You're a real buddy
(sourly) Yeah,  know
What do  do
Don't tell anyone you're a worker
Follow that column over there
And come right back after the inspection
Weaver points to a bunch of soldiers hurrying by in formation
(overjoyed) Thanks
owe you
skips off and joins the column, marching in time with the soldiers but too excited to keep from jazzing it up a little
- The ant army has gathered in a huge  in front of a reviewing stand
We can hear the murmuring of thousands of soldiers -- but all we can see is a   of an ant General pointing right at the camera
The poster reads, "    -- to obey"
turns to some of the soldiers near him
Any of you guys know when the Princess will show up
She's kind of a personal friend
The soldiers look at  like he's nuts
- sounds, and we hear thousands of ant feet as they snap to attention
imitates the soldiers awkwardly
struts to the middle 6f the screen, slapping his thigh with a swagger stick (the antenna of some unfortunate insect) First of all, let me make one thing clear
Nobody ever won a battle by thinking for himself All this "thinking" stuff is a load of crap If the almighty had wanted you boys to think , he wouldn't have given you huge mandibles and a brain so small you'd misplace it if it wasn't trapped inside your head In the audience,  starts laughing -- he thinks Formica's just made a joke
(slapping his thigh) "Trapped inside your head" -- that's a good one -- notices nobody else is laughing
He stops
Geez -- tough room
From the stage, Formica is squinting at the audience, trying to make out who was laughing, but there are just too many ants
He continues
(striding back and forth) We ants survive as a species because we do what we're told
We survive because we work together, as one, we get the job done, we do whatever it takes to persevere
(dramatic pause) Hell, we're not an army of ants
we're one giant ant, with giant fists , and giant jaws The soldiers
along with the rest of them
(to the soldier ant next to him) Lays it on a little thick, doesn't he
If you ask me, he's one giant bore
Now 've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a food shortage Well you boys are gonna be taken care of
But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for breakfast , we are gonna eat the enemy for lunch , and we are gonna eat the enemy for dinner Geez, and  forgot my toothbrush
(reflective moment) Dammit, 'm proud to be an ant
(he looks out at his army) And  know each and every one of you boys will do your duty
Dismissed
applauds and whistles as the other ants look at him in confusion
(clapping) Bravo
Bring on the Princess
Stow the gab there, soldier
Let's move 'em out
The soldiers turn to the right and start to march out past the reviewing stand
marches at the head of 's column as  looks around for the Princess
Eyes
left Finally, as 's part of the army marches past the end of the reviewing stand, he sees her, looking bored, standing next to the Queen, who is giving the royal wave
(waving) Princess
Princess Bala
Hey
It's me
've got your scarf
, Bala sees  -- that is to say, she sees one of the thousands upon thousands of ants marching by
(peering out) Who is that idiot
Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave
Bala waves unenthusiastically, little more than flopping her hand back and forth on her wrist
Down below,  takes this as a sign that Bala has seen him
(excited) Excuse me, guys -- That's my date
Well, it's been fun
Have a great war
tries to squeeze his way back towards the royals, but he's surrounded by a solid wall of soldiers -- and they're carrying him along with them
Hey
Wait
loses sight of the Princess as he's carried away
, a hard-as-nails "grunt" soldier ant, taps  on the shoulder
You new, kid
just joined up
But 'm quitting
got a trial membership
Trial membership
Kid, when you join this ant's army, you're in for the full hitch
At that moment,  is swept out of the cramped corridor they've been marching along, as the army emerges into the outside of the colony
- It's a starry, moonlit night
The shadows crowd around the panicked , who looks up at the sky as we see the army on the march
Wait a minute, there's been a mistake
've got to get back to the colony
starts to fall out of line, but Barbatus, looking concerned, stops him
Are you crazy, kid
They shoot deserters
swallows hard
You just stick by old Barbatus
He'll watch out for you
(off 's look) Whatsamatter, kid
Leave a girl behind
Yeah
Well -- no
She's kind of playing hard to get
As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable
(nervously) So, what's on the schedule
brisk walk
a foraging expedition
No -- we're going to attack the termites
(alarmed) Attack
But --  hate attacking
It's so hostile
Around  and Barbatus, the ants start up a marching song, which we intersperse with dialogue between Barbatus and  to form a montage/time-cut as the ant army marches on to the termite capital
(to the tune of "When Johnny Comes Marching Home") We ants go marching one by one, hurrah, hurrah
We slaughter termites just for fun, Hurrah
Hurrah
So -- these termites, they're little, shy, retiring insects
(grim smile) No such luck
Those dirty terms are five times bigger than us, and they shoot acid from their foreheads
We ants go marching two by two, hurrah
Hurrah
We'll all be dead before we're through, hurrah
Hurrah
Montage shots of an ant column marching diagonally across the screen, fading into another column marching diagonally downwards across the screen
Well, what exactly does our platoon do
Serve beverages
Process paperwork
Our platoon has the best assignment of all
We're the first into battle
We ants are marching three by three, hurrah
Hurrah
Dead ants is what we soon will be, hurrah
Hurrah
montage shot of 's column crossing a bridge composed of living ants -- all of whom look extremely uncomfortable as they're getting stepped on
So we're going back for more armor, right
mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them
Superior numbers, kid
- looks up to see
looming high above them
the , which is built in the stump of a dead tree
From here it looks like a demonic Mount Fuji
The   shouts an order
The front line of ants starts rushing towards the termite colony
is swept along
Over the -
is swept along and up the side of the stump as thousands of ants invade the colony through every possible entrance
Up
over the lip of the stump
and down inside, to the very middle of the termite colony
Into a disquietingly peaceful scene
They're in the middle of the hollowed-out trunk, and ants keep pouring in -- but there's not a termite to be seen
Barbatus looks around suspiciously
It's too damn quiet
Then we hear a strange tapping noise
Barbatus looks over, and sees that 's teeth are chattering with fear
Don't be scared, kid
Barbatus's got yer back
(petrified) Maybe they went out for the evening
Let's leave them a message and head home
(ignoring him) Light it up nearby soldier ant take a firefly out of his knapsack and pinches him The firefly, yelling "Yipe
Yipe
Yipe
", shoots into the air like a flare, lighting up the interior of the stump with eery, shifting luminescence
Then we notice, hollowed into the inside of the stump like innumerable pockmarks, termite holes staring out upon the stump
and, with an unearthly , we see the first of hundreds of termites emerging to pour into the center of the tree, right onto the ant army
They're here
(to ) Keep your head down
Within moments,  finds himself in the middle of a The ants have broken into the colony, but are taking heavy losses from the gigantic, blind, acid-spewing termites
The battle scene is as sprawling and chaotic as something out of Braveheart In a few   from 's perspective, we see: --  squad of ants rushes towards a termite soldier, but are literally melted into smoking heaps of flesh by a jet of acid from its forehead
--  termite warrior is overwhelmed by a crowd of ants and is pulled to pieces with hideous ripping sounds
-- Another termite warrior takes on an ant soldier one on one and slowly crushes his head in his huge jaws
(looking around) Guys
Guys
It isn't too late for all of us to just talk this over
Just then, a termite burst up from the ground and turns to face
is dwarfed by this hulking, roaring, drooling monstrosity
Wait
Please
Acid makes me come out in spots
-- Could  just say have always had the greatest respect for your species
mean, eating wood -- why didn't think of that
-- The termite rears, getting ready to melt , when
he's knocked backwards by
You -- you saved my life
Don't get all sappy about it
As Barbatus and some other soldiers kill the termite, the Colonel strides up to , puffing on a cigar
love the smell of formic acid in the morning
Look out
stream of termite acid engulfs the colonel, instantly burning him to a cinder clutching a still-burning cigar; 's paratroop buddies turn in terror to see a herd of termites rumbling towards them
, terrified, dives into the hole that the huge termite made
- and tumbles headlong into a corridor of the termite mound
The corridors here are primitive, caveman-like, pocked with jagged access holes
No sooner has  landed in the tunnel than a termite comes burrowing out from one of the side walls, snapping at 's head
just avoids getting decapitated, and digs straight through the wall in order to escape
'  - straight into the hub of the entire termite complex -- the Queen's chamber
This is nothing like the civilized court of the ant colony -- it's a huge, stinking, fetid dungeon whose walls are held up by one massive (to ) column of piled stones
The termite queen, a repulsive, slimy, squirming, foot-long monster, is attended by a crew of diminutive, blind termite nurses
The queen turns to look  right in the eye
Excuse me
seem to be lost, and was wondering if you could give me -- Before  can say, "directions", the queen gives out a piercing, blood-curdling shriek The nurses start shrieking too
(backing away) 'll let myself out
But the queen's shriek has summoned a soldier termite -- the biggest one we've seen yet -- who is charging headlong at , jaws snapping open and shut like huge scissors
(backing away) Shoo
-- Torro
Torro
At the last moment,  jumps out of the way -- and the termite runs headfirst into the supporting column of the chamber
As if on a spring release, the termite's jaws clamp shut -- and shatter the base of the column
The walls of the room begin to rumble
The termite turns to eat
but is crushed by a stone falling from the ceiling, which gives a final shudder and collapses , raining earth and stones down on the queen
As the walls of the chamber crumble, melees of ants and termites pour into the room from the corridors around and above
they keep struggling until
(points at ) He's killed their Queen
Hey, 'm sorry, it was a mistake -- We can see that the termite warriors, deprived of their leader, are suddenly confused and directionless, easy prey for the ants
(facetious) This is terrific
Let's exact crippling war reparations
Let's set up a puppet government
Let's slaughter them all
The ants set about killing the disoriented termites when
we hear another rumble coming from the outside
the ants look up confusedly
And a (from the ant's point of view) five-hundred foot long tongue bursts through the top of the chamber with a The ten or so ants standing directly below are smashed by the tongue, which squirts out a spray of saliva around the crater
As quick as it appeared, the tongue retracts, with a hideous  sound
We can now see the end of the snout of an ant-eater poking through a hole in the ceiling high above
The tongue comes down again, smashing some more ants, whose bodies are slurped up by the tongue
the ants scatter, but to no avail, as the tongue comes smashing down again and again
heads into a side corridor as the tongue smashes down again, barely missing him
retreats along the corridor as the tongue searches for him, across the tunnel from intersecting access-tunnels, getting closer and closer to , dragging more and more screaming ants and struggling termites
Then the tongue disappears
Silence
wipes his brow
And we hear a thunderous  noise as the anteater searches for more prey
and the tongue starts rumbling down the corridor right towards , the tip squirming as it ricochets along the walls
gets up and runs, the tongue lapping towards him, reminiscent of the stone sphere that nearly crushed Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark The walls disintegrate under the pressure of the tongue, which gets closer to closer
and just misses him as  tumbles out of the stump and down to the ground
sits there, dazed, as we see the huge form of the anteater withdraw its tongue and, with a final contented burp, shuffle off into the distance
- makes his way across the corpse-strewn battlefield, an expression of horror on his face
(
) Over here
(hopeful) Barbatus
looks down at his feet, where Barbatus's still-living, decapitated head is looking up at him
(shocked) Barbatus
Be honest, kid -- am  hurt bad
No, no, you're
lookin' good
You've got good color in your cheeks
No --  can see it in your eyes
'm a goner
It's alright,
In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus
(he winces) can't feel my legs
Hang in there, buddy
You can make it
Just -- take deep breaths, 'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere
(gasping) wonder
what
was it all
for
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus
Don't make my mistake, kid
don't
be a grunt
your whole life
Barbatus dies, leaving  heartbroken
: - - Weaver is "passing" as a worker, working alongside much smaller worker ants
He actually loves the work
He's throwing up dirt like a bulldozer
He's so enthusiastic, he scoops up a   in his shovel and tosses him aside
Azteca, who's standing next to him in line, is shocked by, and a little attracted to, this turbo-worker
Hey, slow it down, big boy
You're making the rest of us look bad
How come  haven't seen you around here before
(covering) 'm new
was born yesterday
Tell me about it
Nobody told me digging was so much fun
You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers -- (ogling him) Mmm, yes,  see what you mean
While Azteca is checking out the hunky new worker, work has effectively stopped
clods are piling up behind Weaver Foreman comes striding down the line, furious
What's the holdup here
Weaver whips his shovel up to his shoulder and salutes, as if he's dealing with a superior officer
Sorry, sir --  was just having a little chat with my friend -- (yelling at Weaver) Who said you could have a chat You're not a chatter, you're a digger
So shut up and dig
Leave him alone
He's new
You  too
Well just for that, you lose your day's rations
Now get back to work
The Foreman heads down the line, shoving and berating the other workers as he goes along
(surprised at herself) don't know what came over me, talking back like that
must be going crazy
Sorry  got you in trouble
But listen, you can share my rations
(flirting) Are you asking me out to dinner
(blushing) No --  mean yes --  mean -- if you don't have other plans
'll make myself available
Listen, better watch out with the backtalk
don't know want you to end up like the guy who used to work next to me
'm afraid he got
downsized - Some guard ants are looking out across the sandy main entrance to the hive
Look
They're back
The army's back
Alert the colony
The other ant starts ringing a bell, rushing down into the colony
: - huge crowd is forming, eager to welcome the army back band is striking up a triumphant victory song, confetti and streamers are being thrown, as General Formica strides in, followed by Carpenter
The army's returned
Our brave boys are back
(etc
) Everyone waves little flags as the tuba player Oompah-oompah- oompahs
and  walks into the hall, looking bedraggled and exhausted, his helmet hanging over his ears
The band slows to a halt
At the edge of the crowd, Azteca, sitting on Weaver's shoulders, can just about see over the crowd
It looks like only one soldier made it back
Weaver looks distraught
(to himself) Poor  --  should never have let you go
Far down the hall,  is describing the battle
It was horrible
a massacre, a massacre upon a massacre
First we massacred them, then they massacred us, then it was halftime
've never seen such violence, such bloodthirstiness, such bad manners
'm the only one that made it
The atmosphere is somber
This is a tough one to try and put a spin on
but that doesn't stop Formica from trying
The band strikes up again, and everyone cheers
No -- you -- you don't understand
Damn, 'm proud of you, boy
wish had a hundred ants of your caliber
The world would tremble
Now, time for some  and
You're invited to the royal victory party
Royal victory party
Will
will Princess Bala be there
Of course
The entire royal family will be there to honor you
(thinks) Renewed , as  is lifted onto the shoulder of some of the soldiers who stayed behind
Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's
Our The little guy made it
is following Formica away from the cheering crowd
- and Formica are going up the royal "stairway" together
Son, you're an ant after my own heart
warrior
An ant that looks death right in the face and laughs Well,  generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back
So, tell me, fellow war-monger
do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform
Well she better -- she's engaged to one
Me Engaged
As in you're getting married
Affirmative
So
you two are in love
In love
(shakes his head) 'm just a plain old soldier at heart
'll tell you what  love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders
and the company of other warriors
Formica gives  a manly slap on the back
looks a little uncomfortable as we
: - follows Formica and Carpenter into the throne room
At the end of the hall, a society band is playing
The room is full of courtier ants and officers
Waiters are gliding around holding trays of hors d'ouevres
Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony
Yes, and do you know why there's a food shortage
Not enough food
Negatory
Too many ants And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home
Feeling a little hot,  wipes his brow
Well ,  don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"
tell you son, sometimes, at night, see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake
And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart
(spooked) Oh, hey, that's great,  think  see an old war buddy over there, it's been fun chatting
Good luck with the hallucinations
escapes from Formica, who gazes after him suspiciously
mingles in with the crowd, then he sees Princess Bala standing with a group of officers who are eating hors d'oeuvres
(telling a joke) What do you call it when 10,000 workers are killed in a tunnel cave- in
(a beat) Who cares
They're workers
The officers laugh, but Bala looks bored in this stuffy social scene
But
don't you think the worker class is the very foundation of the colony -- (realizes he's getting odd looks) mean, uh, without them, who would we stand on
More laughter
You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you
Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes  am
reaches for a tray of canapes that a waiter is carrying by, and  the whole thing  to the ground
(feigning nonchalance) And you are
'm Princess Bala
Ah, yes
(affected) Well, charmed, 'm sure
So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero
Yes
(deflated) Oh
oh well then, one more won't matter
She moves towards the dance floor
spit-combs his antennae, struts after her -- until he trips on his sword
He tumbles, falls, but hops to his feet just as Bala turns toward him, turning it into a ballet plies
Just warming up
She frowns
there's something familiar about this guy
But then they start dancing
: The Queen and General Formica watch the party
All these parties are so marvellously alike They should be
(suspicious) But there's something funny about that soldier
Formica strides over to where  and Bala are dancing
(glowering) May  cut in
(intimidated) Oh, of course -- (pulling  back) No, General
'm dancing with the war hero
(trying to placate Formica) Uh, sorry, General,
've always had this animal magnetism, it -- Bala   back onto the dance floor, dancing away from Formica
You dance
Divinely
No weirdly
You remind me of someone
Formica catches Bala's eye
She frowns at him, and decides to get a little shocking
He was swarthy
primitive
earthy
sensual
As she says these things,  tries to act accordingly
He was a worker
danced with him at a worker's bar just the other day
'm not shocking you, am
(proudly) No
as a matter of fact
(shocked) , '
' filthy, stupid, disgusting
Everybody gasps
The dancing stops cold
Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder,  think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you
'
(offended) That's not what you said the other night -- (now she's panicked) Quiet -- sshhh
(digging it in) -- At the worker bar You were pretty hot to trot then
livid Formica is stalking over towards them
(furious) What's this worker has been masquerading as a war hero
Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what 'd call a clever ruse -- Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore -- Angry officers begin to surround , who hides behind Bala in fear, using her as a shield
Oh my god
He's taking her hostage
No 'm not --  mean -- nobody move
Or the Princess gets it
People shout and scream, as  backs up with the Princess
into the kitchen
- backs up into the kitchen, still pulling Bala along with him
Here, ant chefs are preparing food for the party, vomiting little florets onto a platter
Formica and the soldiers follow them in
(to Formica) Stay back, you lunatic Do you think don't know how to use this
realizes that he's pointing his finger at them Uh-oh
The officers rush for
and , with Bala in tow, falls backwards into an opening marked, ""
- : the
Nothing happens for a moment
Then -- From a distance, we hear the faint sound of , dopplering closer -- -- and then  and Bala come flying out of the exit, right into the mud, cutting off the scream abruptly
Bala sits up, coated in mud
is nowhere to be seen
Because she's on top of him
This is thoroughly unacceptable
You're telling me
She gets up and runs back towards the colony entrance, where soldiers are already issuing to get her
'm coming
'm coming
But
just as Bala'a about to be rescued
what looks like a gigantic   sweeps along the rim of the colony, sizzling the ground as it moves along
and  the lead soldier into
Bala looks stunned
watches in horror as another soldier ant is , and we look up to see a    casting the beam
we can just about make out the huge, grotesque figure (a seven year old kid) holding it
Bala, who has no idea what's really going on, turns from the colony and runs the other way
'm going
'm going' unfortunately, this draws the fire of the laser, which follows after her in what looks like a strafing run, in her footsteps
, who's running towards the princess, suddenly realizes that he's running towards certain doom
and joins Bala in legging it away from the colony; under a brown leaf , which bursts into flames between the redwood-like stalks of some flowers
and finally into the relative safety of some grass
where they throw themselves on the ground, exhausted
: - and Bala dust themselves off
What was that thing
How should know order you to find out where we are
Alright, alright, 'll try to get directions from one of the locals
tries to flag down some passing bees
Excuse me,  -- (it passes him by; he tries the next) Pardon me -- (same response) And they call them social insects
Climb up that tree and get a better view
Bala points to a thin blade of grass
Gingerly,  tests the grass and starts climbing up it
but his weight bends it, so that he's lowered back to the ground, face to upside-down face with Bala
've been kidnapped by the village idiot
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot
How dare you speak to me like that
'm the Princess
squares up with her
Theoretically, yes
But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it
Of course
It defines society
To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself
But can there be a society composed of just two ants
No
There's no such thing as "just two ants
"  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants
Look around, sweetheart
She looks around
She doesn't like what she sees
She glowers at
-- hate -- you
Well  guess that makes us even
Ha
Don't make me laugh
You're crazy about me
That's why you lied and cheated to get near me
Oh come on, you're the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker
(repulsed) was slumming it danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica
didn't choose him
What kind  of idiot would
(unconvincingly) choose who she wanted to marry
She shakes herself out of it
Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole
Well, that's an appealing offer, but
considering the options
(he decides) You go back
Me, 'm going to Insectopia
Insectopia You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale
Yeah, well  have it on a reliable source
(he knows that was maybe stretching it) that it exists
Now you follow the yellow egg
(looking around) That direction
Worker
Come back here now
've got a name It's That's not a name
That's just a letter
, meanwhile, hits the road
Bala has no idea of where to go
Just then, the scariness of the outside world comes through to her
We start hearing  -- the equivalent of scary jungle sounds in a Tarzan movie -- the , , Bala sees eyes looking out at her from all directions
and spots a colossal monster (a sparrow) fixing her with his beady gaze
(clears her throat) Worker
(no response
louder now) Oh
Where are you
(getting desperate) Wait for me
Bala heads off after
- - The mass of worker ants are swinging pick-axes in the tunnel
The foreman moves up the line,  the workers, yelling at them to dig faster
tell ya, 'm gettin' sick of bein' yelled at
#1 What do you want, we're just workers
You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be
Look at
He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier
That's right
He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly
#2 heard about this guy
(turning to the other workers) He crashed a party at the palace
Then he took a hike with one of the royal babes
And when they tried to stop him, he just looked at a couple'a guards, and they burst into flames
#1 You're nuts, how could a worker do all that
Well, because he's more than a worker
he's a
what did he call it, Azteca
Invisible
No -- an individual #2 What's that Well, it's
someone with his own point of view
someone who does what he wants, not whatever he's told to do
(eyes lit up, watching Weaver) Someone who follows his heart
(taking Azteca's hand) Right
because every ant's important
#2 (scoffs) But that would mean 'm important
#1 'm outta here, this sounds like trouble to me
But more ants are gathering 'round
We can all be individuals
Just like Weaver and Azteca hold hands
More ants are gathering around, dropping their tools
- glimmering desert landscape (think of "The Sun's Anvil" in Lawrence of Arabia )
Two small figures can be seen, tiny dots moving across the arid whiteness
They're Bala and , who are crossing a concrete path in the park, which they perceive to be a "desert"
Water
water
Water
water -- oh, you already said that
(walking along) My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking
wish 'd never met you, you ruined my life
ruined your life
Look,  was perfectly happy until  met you -- alright,  was miserable, but  was happily miserable Over 's line, we can see a  , getting larger and larger and heading right towards them, a (the front wheel of a bicycle which is heading right towards them)
Look out
Bala pushes  out of the way just as the wheel rolls past with a cacophonous ,  noise -- like a gigantic millwheel
We're going to die
Come on -- it's gone
What are the chances of that happening again
No sooner has he said it than the rear wheel of the bike thunders past
Well 'll be
Bala notices that they're clutching one another in fear; she pushes him away
Why didn't  listen to my mother why'd  have to go looking for trouble
Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position
what's wrong with me
Want a list
(urgent) Wait,  hear something
We can, in fact, hear a low, musical
there's a pause and then we can hear it again
and Bala walk over a rocky "dune" (the soft shoulder of the path)
Beyond, the grass starts up again
They have come to the end of the "desert" (i
e
the other side of the path) Through the blades of grass, we can see
It's
it's
- (a puddle) stretches before them
It is, in fact, the overflow of a drinking-fountain whose drain is jammed
as and Bala run to the lake, water dribbles from the fountain and into one edge of the pool (to the ants, it's a waterfall)
Bala and  run to the edge of the water and start slurping
They smile at each other, until they remember that they don't like each other
This lake is huge
And so close to the colony
Think of the vacation potential
Cut me down a soft leaf so  can take a nap
Listen, "Princess", you can't order me around
Out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just -- -- But before he can finish, a water droplet from the fountain falls on him
It may not sound like much, but to it's as though a ten-foot diameter sphere of jello had engulfed him
's stuck inside because of the surface tension of the droplet, which doesn't burst, just quivers up and down
Inside,  is slowly, frantically drowning and screaming for help
But his screams are muffled in the water
(annoyed) Out here 'm just what
(through the water) Hlllllllp
(hands on hips) Stop fooling around in there
By now the droplet has started rolling , and  is being turned upside-down
He manages to get one foreleg out of the droplet, and, in a frantic attempt to pull himself out, pulls Bala in by the leg Let me go
But it's too late -- they're now both stuck in the droplet, and, as  continues to drown, he also has to deal with Bala yelling at him -- though we can't hear exactly what it
is she's yelling through the water
Then, having run out of air, she too starts thrashing, alternately trying to swim and trying to slap him as  tries to defend himself Finally all this commotion is enough to make the droplet burst , spilling the two coughing, sputtering, drenched ants onto the ground
They both lie there, miserable, wet, and cold
(chants to herself) 'm going to be rescued soon
'm going to be rescued soon
'm going to be rescued soon
watches her incredulously
Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're not going to rescue you General Formica won't let me die out here
'm his fiancee
Look
How many other Princesses are there
Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no
About five thousand four hundred by now
And only you can become a Queen
Well
no, but -- So what makes you so special
(hesitates) Well am the oldest
Bala turns from
She's thinking things over, realization dawning on her
By three seconds
She looks out into the grass forest
(to herself) You're right
There are as many Princesses
as there are blades of grass
, overhearing her, slowly puts his hand on her shoulder
- - Formica and Carpenter are walking into the entrance of the tunnel with a squad of soldiers
Dammit, this tunnel is priority -1
We can't afford any delays on this project
've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're
well, look
Ahead of them, a group of a few hundred workers have stopped work and are sitting down, chanting
worker moves forward to join the strikers, tossing down his tool
(yelling at him) Where do ya think you're going
Get back to work
#1 Buzz off, 'm important
(joining the others) At the center of the group, Weaver and Azteca are holding hands, leading the chant
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir
(calculating) No one should have to
Have him brought to me
'  - nervous Weaver is sitting across from Formica, flanked by a couple of stoic guards
Carpenter stands smiling by the side door
There is no obvious threat to Weaver, but the atmosphere is truly intimidating
So this
he fancies himself an individual
Yeah
mean
well
don't know, really, sir
(patronizing) Well now you haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you
Oh, no, sir
Good
You're a good soldier
Thank you, sir
Weaver begins to relax a bit
So tell me
Where's
have no idea, sir
Okay, son
He pats Weaver on the shoulder
We know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we
We know that no ant can be an individual
No single ant matters, right
(enthusiastically) That's correct, sir
(points at a guard) Not that one
(another guard) Or that one
No, sir
Formica nods at Carpenter, who smiles and opens a door
Two soldiers walk in, holding Azteca The color drains from Weaver's face
(calmly, with satisfaction) Or that one
Her life doesn't matter, does it
Don't tell that tightass anything, Weaver
Weaver starts to get up, but the guards behind him hold him down
Wait
Just let her go
's long gone anyway, following some golden egg to Insectopia
You'll never catch him
Formica's face lights up
Insectopia, hunh
See why individuality is so dangerous
It can always be used against you
(to the guards) If this sissy here wants to dig, he'll dig
Send them both back to the tunnel project
Double their workload
The guards exit with Weaver and Azteca
What do we have on this "Insectopia"
Scattered reports, sir
Rumors
Nothing reliable
Desperate times call for desperate measures
Get me Ant Team Six
(frightened) Ant Team Six
- and Bala are lost, wandering through the grass (looking hopeless) swear, we've passed this blade of grass three times
keeps marching on
Face it, , we're lost
We must have walked halfway across the world by now
How did  get into this mess
(too shy to look at her) Come on
tell me there wasn't just a little
something between us that first night at the bar
The night we danced
(sadly) What difference does it make
we're both going to starve to death, or get squished, or set on fire
But  is just gawking
The shot expands to show that they have stumbled onto
The land of red and white
- red and white picnic blanket , which to the ants looks like a vast, undulating pavilion , stretches before them
They gaze up at two obelisks: a salt and pepper shaker
Behind that is a gigantic tupperware jar full of potato salad, and sandwiches stacked high
It all looks perfect, with the clean lines and monumental proportions of fascist architecture
In fact, it looks a little too perfect
We've found it
Insectopia Look at all this food' (amazed) You were right
you were right
(smiling happily) , it's beautiful Let's dig in
goes over to a gigantic sandwich, but --
-- he's prevented from getting at it by the saran wrap covering it
There's - there's some kind of force field
Bala joins him, laboring against the saran wrap
Then both of them hear laughter from above
(
) (lockjawed accent) Muffy, look, party-crashers
(
) (laughing) They're simply too much , Chip
Bala and  look up to see two large, yellow  hovering in the air above them
The husband and wife wasps have lockjawed, William
Buckleyesque accents
(to  and Bala) You down there, haven't you ever been to a picnic Hunh
Habla Ingles (to Male Wasp) Well  really don't know who they are
We're ants
The Male Wasp zooms in closer
Poopsie, we know some ants, don't we
(to ) Are you related to the Fifth Avenue ants
Darling, do you have to talk to any insect from off the street
Just being friendly, Poopsie
Hello
'm not just "any insect"
My mother is the Queen
(momentously) 'm Princess Bala
(under his breath) They're Eurotrash, dear
We hear a loud  noise -- the family is about to sit down for their picnic lunch
Gigantic hands reach down and pull away the "force fields"
Lunch
(to ) little piece of advice, sport -- bob and weave
Bob and weave
What do you mean
Well -- like my father used to say -- there's no such thing as a free meal
The wasps dive in to the picnic, darting in for a bite, and then dashing away again
Excuse me -- 'll have some potato salad -- thank- you -- don't mind if do
After you
(etc
) -- But all is not well
We pull back to reveal that  and Bala are standing in front of a giant sneaker logo, which is attached to a giant sneaker Which moves sort of imagined Insectopia a little differently -- Just at that moment, we hear a whistling in the air -- and the female wasp is crushed by a huge swatter that sweeps out of the sky, sending the picnic blanket billowing up in an aftershock that throws Bala and  to the ground
Oh
my
God
(shaking her) Muffy
Muffy
Wake up
But she doesn't move
The Male Wasp stares up at the sky
(heartbroken) But , also looking up, has no time to commiserate
Bala, look out
They are only saved by the fact that they are so small -
the holes of the swatter pass over them
The woman, realizing that the swatter won't work on ants, throws it to the side and tries stomping on them
Before Bala can get away, a sneaker falls on her with a thunderous  that shakes the ground
MMMffllmmm
The shoe rises, as the person wearing it steps away
and we see that Bala is stuck in one of the ridges of the waffle- soled sneaker, adhering to a big piece of bubblegum Help me
But Bala is carried off on the sneaker in a huge, looping, ferris-wheel-like motion
The sneaker on which Bala is stuck falls again, as the woman tries to step on , too -- Bala
(mournfully) 'll never see her again
-- But he does, instantly, as the shoe rises again, showing Bala stuck deeper in the bubblegum -- Get me out of heeeeere
-- The woman has decided to walk away from the picnic to get the bubblegum off her shoe
heart sinks as the shoe Bala's stuck on lopes off into the distance
(thinks) These things always come in twos
He sees a   starting to rise -- Take me to your leader
runs towards the shoe as it rises
and at the last moment catches on to the snaky, swinging shoe-lace Whoooooooaaaa
The sneaker lifts off into the air, with  holding on for dear life to the lace, and getting further and further away from Bala as he's drawn to a vertiginous height
the landscape can be seen rolling and pitching crazily in the background
Bala
Come back here
For a moment, the sneaker seems to pause in the air
then it descends again, in a stomach-churning, roller-coaster free- fall as the sneaker on which Bala is stuck rises up again
'm stuck
--  But  is trying to keep his lunch down as he descends
The sneaker hits the ground, and  can feel himself again
it's now or never
(Tarzan whoop) Aa-ee-ya-ee-yaaaaaaaah
As the sneaker rises again, he swings off the lace, hurtling through the air and catching one of the laces of Bala's sneaker
the momentum swings him up and under the sole
You're here
gets smashed into the bubblegum next to Bala
Now he's stuck too
(ruefully) Yeah
'm here
The sneaker descends again
and Bala hold hands and as they see the ground rise too meet them
They're squished deeper into the bubblegum
The sneaker rises again
(emotional) if we don't make it
just want you to know
(touched) Yes
This is all your fault The sneaker rises, and seems ready to fall again
but instead it just hovers there
(The person wearing it is balancing on one leg and about to scrape off the bubblegum with a penny)
We're safe
Just then, the hand holding the penny looms up
the penny is, by ant standards, about sixty feet high
The huge image of Abraham Lincoln stares down at them
Who the hell is that The penny starts scrapes the bubblegum off the sneaker, bringing Bala and  along with it
They're carried through the air as the penny gets thrown away
turning over and over in a lopsided orbit as Bala and
and land with a  in total darkness - The "lake" where  and Bala were nearly drowned by the water droplet
The earth shakes as a ,  creature approaches the lake - and begins to drink from it
The creature seems to hear something, and, growling , turns its ugly head
It's a Pomeranian, one of those yappy little lap-dogs -- but seen from ant perspective, it's something out of a horror movie (
) Ant Team Six -- take him out The monster bears its huge fangs at the approaching intruders -- a bunch of flying ants who look as though they're attacking the Death Star The monster rears and snaps at two of the ants, who are making a diversionary run
and then gets it from the rest of the ants, who land on his soft, wet nose and start stinging away like crazy The monster rears back in pain -- and runs away,
The members of   , a crack team of hardcore flying- ant commandoes a la Seal Team Six, break off the attack and land
And don't come back, you sissy , Ant Team Six's lethal commander, steps into frame
He's the one-eyed killer we met in the bar earlier
The rest of his team fan out to search the area
Talk to me
and the Princess were here, sir
Signs of a struggle
Let's get a read on that feremone track
#1 (to the others) Get the sniffer Two other commandoes come running up with what looks like a piece of machinery on a tripod -- only it's an ant -- a highly specialized, blind ant with an incredibly acute sense of smell
Bala
find Bala
The tracker, drool running out of its long proboscis, sniffs the air and starts signalling like a geiger counter
(as he's swivelled) Nnononononononoyeahyeahnononononono no
Finally the tracker stops swivelling, pointing in one direction and saying, "Yeahyeahyeahyeah
" #3 Got 'em
Ten clicks from here
-- you dirt-digging, fancy-dancing, wisecracking, royalty-grabbing, rebel (yelling into the distance) ,
Mandible's muscles bulge
The veins in his head throb
This is one ass-kicking ant
Even Mandible's troops look scared of him
Let's
, people
Ant Team Six takes to the air, heading in the direction indicated by the tracker ant
- Darkness
Out of it we hear the voices of  and Bala
Come on,
Forget it
You go ahead,  give up
don't know what  was thinking
"Insectopia"
In one corner of the screen, we can see an irregular little hole through which a shaft of light is falling
Bala proceeds towards it, the hole appears to get bigger and bigger
(defeated) There's only one thing worse than an ant who goes around mindlessly following orders, and that's an ant who's too dumb to go around mindlessly following orders
Bala stops
she notices that they're being watched
She's emerging from a tied off garbage bag -- the yellow ties loop away gracefully
Bala and  have been tossed into a garbage area
And above them and below them, peering from garbage cans, recycling containers, bags, etc
, a multi-cultural assortment of insects are regarding them
laid-back  voices their thoughts
What's with the bummer attitude
nearby  joins in
Yeah -- nobody stresses out in Insectopia Did you say
(joining Bala) Insectopia
and Bala look around
Just to get things straight, the garbage dump doesn't look disgusting -- that would be seeing it through human eyes
Instead, we're looking at it through ant eyes -- and, reimagined this way, it's Paradise Not the ordered, sterile, paradise of the picnic, but an earthly land of plenty
The sides of the plastic garbage bags are sheer, reflective walls of smoothest obsidian
the garbage cans are gigantic, thick metal columns put there by the gods (think the pyramids); a coke bottle, refracting the sunlight into a gorgeous rainbow, trickles a fountain of sweet nectar into the pink, bittersweet flesh of a grapefruit half, which appears as a multi-chambered concave dome
Everywhere, insects are disporting themselves -- a multi- species love-in that's like an insect version of Woodstock
Bala and  are awe-struck
Bala turns to
(happily) , we made it
(alighting on the grapefruit) 'mon in
The nectar's fine
Like a kid at an amusement park,  slides down the smooth side of the garbage bag, whooshing this way and that until he slides into one end of a straw (a red and white striped tunnel), and is shot out Yippeeeeee
into a bottle-cap filled with lemonade, which he alternately drinks and swims through
Down at the bottlecap,  is drying himself off
Then he sees, emerging from behind a lemon peel, a gigantic
(terrified) Surprisingly, the termite seems equally terrified
(to ) Hey, take it easy
There's nothin' to be afraid of
Yeah, well,  make it a practice not to trust anyone who shoots acid out of their forehead
Dude, here in Insectopia, we don't judge people by how many arms and legs we've got
Yeah, back home, they called me a fruitfly
But here, 'm known as
(with attitude) Superfly
Anyway, big Gus is mellow
The termite sticks his hand out
drop of acid drips from his head and splashes at 's feet
(taking his hand, disgusted) Charmed
reaches out and shakes the termite's hand, as Bala watches, smiling
: - The insects are having a cookout , their faces illuminated by the still-red ember of a match Platters heaped with food lie untouched as they pat their bellies
and Bala sit next to one another, smiling shyly as if they had just met for the first time
So
you never did tell me
what made you come out to the worker bar that night
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble,  guess
Well, "trouble" is my middle name
Actually, my  middle name is
985, but  don't tell people
Hey, Bala, actually have something of yours
you left it at the bar that night
takes out Bala's scarf, which he's been keeping folded in a pocket
Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else
You held onto this all that time
Well,
know it's a little strange, but
thought it might come in handy if
needed a scarf someday
(embarrassed) Well, to be honest,  just liked having it
He hands it back to her
Bala looks at , frankly, openly
For a moment  is shy
Then he looks at her too
They're two lovers, leaning closer, about to have their first kiss, when -- Hey The moment is wrecked
looks up
chubby beetle stands there with Gus the termite
Wanna bring back dessert
There's a thirty foot long blimp in the next can, made completely of chocolate
(annoyed) Sure
wasn't busy or anything
gets up to go with them
Great timing, guys
Ever wonder why they call you "pests"
,    - As Ant Team Six lands and takes up position above the feast
The tracker ant is going nuts
Yesyesyesyesyes -- One of the commandoes puts his hand over the tracker's mouth to shut him up
Mandible communicates with his troops by pulling down his one functional antenna and gruffly whispering into it, as though it were one of those commando headsets
His troops do likewise
Talk to me
#1 've got a read on the Princess -- but target  isn't accounted for
Let's move in
- Back at the feast, a cricket strums on his legs like a guitar, opining about life and the universe to a bunch of other chilled-out, hippyesque insects
Bala taps her feet to the song
What if, like
we're just these tiny little things, and we're just like part of this whole other huge universe, that's like, so big we don't even know it exists
Man
that's so deep
At that moment Ant Team Six rapels down from the top of the garbage bin, landing amongst the insects
The cricket gets up to confront Mandible, but Mandible cold cocks him with a right to the jaw
The other insects, too surprised to fight, just do as they're told
Alright, you hippy scum
Make one move and 'll exterminate you
couple of commandoes grab Bala by the arms and heave her up
Stop
You don't understand
don't have to understand, Missy -- 've got orders Now where's : - , the termite, the beetle and the fly are happily carrying a huge & back to the feast
Man, your girl is fly , know what 'm saying
(overdoing it) Oh, Bala
guess she's okay, you know, for a princess
mean, usually date queens, or you know, empresses, because sometimes the lesser nobility are too much in awe of my smouldering sensuality
Please stop me if 'm making you feel inadequate
They throw down the &, which lands with a
notices that the rest of the insects look spooked
What's the matter
This place is as cheery as a Roach Motel at check-out time
looks around
Bala's been kidnapped
Some flying ants took her back to the colony
She's been kidnapped
But  can't live without her
just stands there, heartbroken
(determined) 'm going back
've got to get her
Who'll come with me
looks around
Nobody's volunteering
Nothing but sheepish looks and shuffling from the insects of Insectopia
looks disheartened
He's about to leave when -- (
) 'll go
The male wasp is hovering nearby
(surprised) You
know what it's like to lose someone
keep hearing the sound of Muffy's flapping wings
so 'll take you
hops on the wasp's back
Let's go, pal
The wasp takes off, leaving the other insects looking a little chastized
Geez
feel like a real stinkbug
: - The wasp and  fly high above the colony
Wow
never saw things this way
From here, we can see the whole layout of the land around the colony
the "desert" (an asphalt path) and across it, the "lake" (the overflowing water fountain) Things look so close together from up here
there's the desert
and the lake
(thinking about something) it's not far from the colony at all
Suddenly, the wasp bounces up and down in the air
Sorry
Turbulence
'  - Formica sits at his desk, going over some plans
Formica's chambers are located inside a snake skull, with the eye sockets serving as windows, and the mouth serving as a door
The walls are hung with trophies -- the heads of other insects
Ant Team Six burst in the doors of Formica's office, carrying the struggling and kicking Bala
One of the commandoes sets the tracker ant one the floor
then Formica gets up from his desk as the commandoes bring the princess to him
Princess Bala
Good
(with urgency) Where's
Bala replies warily
He's
he's dead
(covering for ) You don't have to look for him anymore
He was eaten by a praying mantis
(regretfully) It's a shame he died prematurely was hoping to kill him myself
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now
(sadly) miss him already
(surprised) You miss him
Why (angry) Because
because he's twice the ant that you are
could never go through with marrying you
'm -- 'm an individual , and when  get married, it'll be to someone choose
The soldiers look shocked
For a moment, Formica looks furious
Then he just shrugs
(shaking his head) Princess Bala, 'm just a simple old soldier, and the ways of the feminine mind are a little too complex for me
But one thing  do know is, there are more Princesses where you came from
just hope they're not all like you
In the meantime, maybe we can arrange for you to see  again after all
He gestures to the commandoes, who drag her out the door
We notice that the tracker ant has been left behind
- hops down from the wasp, who has landed near the entrance to the colony
Good luck,
For a wingless insect, you're alright by me
Thanks, Chip
They shake hands and the wasp flies off
(to himself) How am  going to get in
The place is crawling with soldiers
starts for the nearest entrance -- but he's spotted by a couple of
You there
Worker
's caught -- it's over
He turns around with his hands up
Don't bite
surrender
What are you doing out here
All workers are to remain inside the colony, by orders of General Formica
can't believe his luck -- and his curiosity is piqued
(heading inside) Well
if you insist
- The Queen, with Formica striding at her side, is carried by a personal escort of fifty or so struggling workers to the bottom end of the Mega Tunnel, where a red ribbon waits to be cut
Very impressive, General
Behind her, hundreds of thousands of workers are crowded, looking confused and expectant
Some of them clutch little flags and noisemakers
Wave that flag, you maggot
which we see are being handed out to them by Ant Team Six
Is there anything wrong, your majesty
The Queen is looking around unhappily
It's just
How  miss Bala
wish she were here for this special moment
Formica warmly places his hand on the Queen's shoulder
(falsely supportive) She is, your majesty
She is The  heads up the long, long tunnel, where we see
Bala, tied and gagged
She's at the point in the Megatunnel where it begins to curve upwards towards the surface
She struggles against her bonds, but can't get loose
: - Elsewhere in the colony, a column of soldiers marches by, and we hear the -- of their boots
When they've gone,  pokes his head out from behind a pile of dirt
he heads in the opposite direction of the soldiers
'  - creeps around the outside of Formica's chambers
This part of the colony seems to be deserted
Geez, this place really empties out in August
Where is everybody
walks up to the skull that houses Formica's chambers and peeks in the eye socket
' Inside, the Tracker Ant, who's been left behind, switches "on", eyes glowing
enters the chamber cautiously
(sniffing) smell
For a moment, 's afraid
Then he sees the small Tracker Ant doesn't seem hostile
You "smell" me
Well look,  -- 've been out in the wilderness for a while, and -- The tracker ant keeps sniffing
waves his hand in front of the blind ant's eyes
(getting it) Hey, wait, you're
you're one of those pheremone sniffers, aren't you
Maybe you can help me
'm looking for a friend of mine, Princess Bala
(enthusiastic) Bala
Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeah
Find Bala
Yeahyeahyeahyeah
picks up the tracker ant
Just remember,  met her first
, carrying the little tracker ant, heads out, following its lead
Through this and that passage, as the Tracker Ant gets more and more insistent
And finally straight to a blank wall Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah
Bala's through there
Bala
Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah
Great
More digging
This is why left in the first place
can answer his own question
He puts down the tracker ant, with a look on his face like a kid forced to eat broccoli, starts digging through the wall
- Meanwhile,  member of Ant Team Six -- the stupidest member, in fact, waits at the very top of the tunnel , where it narrows almost to a point
He's hanging from a winch, and has a little hammer and chisel in his hand
He's , awaiting instructions
- - emerges from the tunnel he's dug, spits a load of dirt out of his mouth and wipes his hands off
Nearby, Bala lies there, bound and gagged
Bala
unties Bala and undoes her gag
You came back
They
Why do they have you tied up here
There's something going on,  -- From here,  can see far down the tunnel to where the crowd is gathering
They're having a ceremony to open the Megatunnel
We can hear the sound of   somewhere above
He looks up the tunnel
in the distance, we can make out the silhouete of the commando set to break open the wall
Bala, that -- that lake we found -- think the tunnel's right underneath it
(horrified) -- Formica's going to flood the colony That's what he meant when said there were too many ants
Oh no
Bala looks too shocked to move
starts pushing her into the tunnel he made, and starts heading down towards the crowd
what are you doing
know it's crazy, but --  can't just leave
Don't argue with me
If 've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world
Or beans
Something like that
Anyway, 've got to warn the others looks into Bala's eyes
Head for the surface, Bala
If don't make it, well
we'll always have Insectopia
kisses Bala
Then he starts running down the tunnel towards the crowd
(following him) Wait for me
- All the  are filtering out of the assembly area, leaving the workers behind
As his troops march by, Formica steps to the side and hands the Queen a pair of scissors to cut the ribbon strung across the Megatunnel
Your majesty, 'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony
But General -- this tunnel is your baby
You're sure you can't stay
'Fraid not, your majesty
(with regret) Goodbye, your majesty
Very well, General --  know you -- all work and no play
Alright, let's move out
Formica, surrounded by his bodyguards, hurries off as the Queen readies to cut the ribbon
In the name of the colony,  declare this tunnel open
- - and Bala sprint towards the bottom end of the tunnel
Stoooooop
-- and then pull back to see Queen cut the ribbon -- she looks up and sees -- Bala
Mom
calls out to the crowd
Listen up
We've all got to get out of here
This place is going to flood
The workers are unconvinced
#1 Are you nuts You've got to believe me
#2 Oh yeah
What makes you so special, Mr
Know-It-All
'm
The workers are even more sceptical
laugh goes up from the crowd
#3 You're
Gimme a break
's ten milimeters tall
#4 -- and he can kill termites with his bare hands
You're just some scrawny worker with a mental problem
am #1 No you're not
Yes he is Weaver steps out of the crowd
Weaver
Weaver runs up to  and hugs him, starting to cry
Hey
it is listen to what he says
[etc]
'm so sorry
-- Don't worry about it, pal
Nearby, Bala and the Queen hug
The Queen looks over at
(distastefully) Oh
it's that social-climbing worker again -- what does he want
(in response) To save you all
Now we've got to go
: - Outside of the colony, where Formica, surrounded by the army, gives a signal to Mandible by drawing his finger across his throat
(talking into his antenna) Let 'er rip
- , the commando starts chiseling away furiously at the wall
and nothing but dust falls down
The commando looks at the dust as it falls down, down the long tunnel
he looks up at the dry wall
Hmmm
Then
And a  starts pouring out -- swallowing the terrified commando as if he were a crumb and heading down the tunnel like a freight train, ripping up the walls as it goes
- - Everyone turns to hear the rumbling sound coming down the tunnel -- Listen
#1 He's right
From here, we can see deep into the tunnel, at the point where it levels out
and the torrent can be seen rushing down at them
'
All of a sudden there's panic as every ant tries to scramble away from the oncoming water
in the confusion, the Queen's bearers drop her and scramble over her
You there
Stop
say
The Queen turns, and for a brief moment is silhouetted against the white-capped torrent of water
and then she picks her abdomen up like a skirt and high tails it away from the torrent , running so fast that she passes some of her bearers on the way
And then the torrent spits out of the mouth of the Megatunnel , quickly filling up the chamber and branching into all of its side tunnels, as we see: group of workers  up a side tunnel and getting consumed by a wave, which crashes down on them like a hand slapping a table
Another group , the members of which are getting swallowed up one by one; one of the ants runs up on the ceiling of the tunnel and keeps on going, upside-down
it works for a while but eventually he, too is swallowed up
-- In the Nursery , nurses are evacuating stacks of crying ant babies
In one of the larger access-tunnels, down which thousands of workers are fleeing, a group of ants turns and decides to make a stand for it -- they link up in a mass and form a It holds for a while but then  scattering and smashing ants along the sides of the tunnel before eating them up
And we
: - The huge main chamber of the colony, where most of the workers -- as well as , Bala, Weaver, Azteca, and the Queen -- have run to
The chamber is rapidly flooding from all sides
Water flows out of every escape tunnel the workers try
and the crowd is becoming more and more closely packed together as the waters rise around them
There's no way out
We're all going to drown
what can we do
clenches his fist
he feels utterly powerless
then he shouts
Dig The workers turn to look at him questioningly
We've got to dig a trench around us
-- But one of the workers raises his hands
#1 Uh
we don't dig any more
We're individuals
#2 Yeah
We're too important to dig
You taught us that,
You hate digging
(at his wits end) Yeah, but  hate drowning more
Now dig You heard the ant --
The workers start to dig a circular moat around themselves, passing the dirt back into the middle of what remains of the dry ground
-- But they seems to be making little headway against the water as it continues to rush in
The ant labor we saw up to now were nothing compared to this
As the moat gets deeper, the pile grows higher and higher
Weaver is digging up huge chunks of earth
nearby, Azteca is digging like crazy too
runs around, directing traffic and encouraging the workers
That's it
Pass the dirt back to the center
Go on
Nearby the Queen stands there, looking squeamish
Your highness
time to get your hands dirty
Gingerly, the Queen reaches out for a clod of dirt
and passes it along
Next thing you know, she's practically crushed by a huge load thrown up by Weaver
The water keeps rushing in
but now we notice that
the pile of dirt in the middle of the "island" created by the digging of the moat is growing higher and higher, reaching up towards the ceiling of the chamber
And the water is getting swallowed up by the moat, swirling around angrily
Now  looks up, and sees that with a little more effort they can reach the top -- We need to form a scaffolding around this mound -- let's
The workers start to cluster around the mound, covering it, forming a tight network of living bodies around the mound up towards the ceiling
Now climb The ants start to scale the scaffolding, up towards the top of the chamber
it's a swarming mass of ants, hauling each other up, giving each other legs up, climbing ever and ever higher towards the top
Where they start to dig through the very ceiling
as, at the bottom of the mound,  starts to organize the hauling away of the Queen, as though she were a big cargo container
Okay boys -- take her up
slaps the Queen on the butt, and she's winched away on a cable composed entirely of ants linked arm in arm like those plastic toy monkeys
- And Azteca's head pokes through the ground
she hauls herself up, and hundreds of ants pour up from the ground, widening the hole
- The water is rising
but almost all of the ants have escaped
clambers up the mound, as the scaffolding of ants rolls up from the bottom
And the rushing water finally wears down the earthen core of the structure
As  hauls himself through the hole in the ceiling
The entire structure collapses into the angry waters below, which seem furious to have missed their prey
- He did it
The "" cheer goes up, with everyone joining in
But the jubilation is short-lived, for, appearing on the ridge, surrounding the workers, is ' , circling the mass of workers, backing them in towards the roiling water behind them
Formica himself appears in the front lines, with Carpenter and Mandible at his side
should have known
All that work, all that preparation, come to nothing
All because of one stinking ant
He steps forward to address the surrounded, trapped workers
The workers, trembling but silent, cower inside the unbroken circle of soldiers
,
, '
Formica laughs, shaking his head
Folks, you may have survived that flood, but there's no way you're gonna escape from me 'll make you a deal
Hand over the rebel leader , and you survive
This sends a ripple of murmurs through the workers
But if you don't hand him over, you're all going to die, each and every single
"individual" one of you
The workers all look at each other
What shall it be, workers
The workers remain frightened but silent
trembles, terrified
Have it your way
As Formica raises his swagger stick to order the attack, a lone figure steps out from the crowd
Wait
stands there, shivering with fear
'm
For a moment,  stands alone, under the glare of Formica's gaze
Then another figure steps out from the throng of workers
No, 'm turns, astonished, to see Weaver, still and unwavering, bravely risking his life for his friend
Then,  also steps forward
'm Next, Bala comes forward
No, 'm More and more ants step forward
'm
'm
'm  and so is my brother
've been  for weeks now
(regally) We are
Now, the workers are all shouting the same declaration
am
am
am
is plainly flabbergasted
Formica is outraged
He gives the signal
The army swells forward on all sides, pushing the workers towards the swirling water
Some workers surround the Queen to protect her
All seems lost, when   from Insectopia alights on the rim of the horizon
Hey, guys
appears on the other side of the horizon
It's them
Suddenly, on all sides,     appears on the ridge, looking not unlike ambushing Indians in a John Ford film
Formica's soldiers stop in their tracks, awed by the unfolding spectacle
It looks like all of Insectopia has turned out: spiders, caterpillars, rhinoceros beetles, all manner of creatures crawling and flying have shown up, and now surround the army, dwarfing them
Are these hooligans giving you trouble,
Say the word, , and we kick their butts
The ant army remains frozen, unsure of what to do next
Formica is furious
If ants had veins, Formica's would be bulging out of his face
What are you doing
(berating his army) Come on, you yellow-bellies
(turning on Carpenter) Don't just stand there, Carpenter
Make an example of yourself
Uh, actually, we are outnumbered sir
Formica turns towards the insects gathered against him
With his chin raised pridefully, Formica steps forward, and Formica runs so quickly and with such force that his helmet blows off his head
's eyes get big, he stumbles backwards, slipping, and Formica goes flying over him, toward the whirlpool behind
He scrabbles at the edge of the water, and then tumbles over
For a moment, it looks as if he's gone
(
) Help
help me
goes to the edge of the precipice and looks over
Formica is struggling in the waters of the very flood he created, which are roiling not far below
He looks up into 's eyes, a new expression crossing his features: fear
Please
can't swim
Help me
Formica goes under for a bit, then his head comes up again -- but he's not going to be able to stay afloat for long
Suddenly he sees a line dropped down
Above,  looks down on him
thought you said that the life of one ant doesn't matter
Formica looks at the line
and in that moment seems to realize his error
guess it does
to the ant
Formica reaches up and takes the line, and is pulled up by and a bunch of other ants (the line, we see, extends from a nearby spider, one of the cavalry from Insectopia)
Formica is left, broken and alone, by the precipice, while surround  to congratulate him
Bala fights her way to his side and the two of them embrace
Then the ants pick up  and Bala, and, , bear them away
Only Carpenter stays behind
He walks up to Formica, carrying his dented and dusty helmet
He cleans it the best he can with his jacket sleeve and hands it to his fallen general
Sir, if it's any consolation,  still think you're completely worthless as an individual
: As he addresses the audience, stand-up style
So, uh, that's pretty much it
Just your basic "simple worker overthrows the government and winds up with the princess" kind of a story
You know: there was the big parade and everything
: - applauds as  who is given a medal by the Queen
: ' , looking extremely dispeptic
(
) General Formica was almost unemployable
He eventually got a gig as a honeydew keg
Formica clinging to a wall, his belly hideously distended with honeydew
(
) The Queen asked me to take over his job, but  said "Sorry, but 'm really not the general type
'm more the specific type
"  So they gave the job to Weaver instead
: , in Formica's old office, in a general's uniform, his feet up on Formica's desk, smoking a cigar
Carpenter is on his hands and knees scrubbing the floor
(
) Weaver cut the defense budget in half
Now we only have an army of five million
cut back to ,
And me,  guess you could say that lived happily ever after
Bala enters the frame, embraces and kisses him
mean, 've got the whole package, right
great life, a beautiful wife, and a few kids
few '  - and Bala stand in the midst of their living room, up to their knees in
The children cover every horizontal surface
They run around, cry, laugh, and tease each other
looks around the room, looks back at us, and shrugs
Well, so nothing's perfect
But you know
wouldn't change a thing
The camera pulls up
and away from the ground
to reveal that this whole story has been taking place in a small area of
We pull back and back, and see all the familiar landmarks from the story: the bike path, the drinking fountain, etc
