Clear sky, snow on the ground
Cold as fuck
With the sounds of laughter and music, we   : - An office Xmas party in progress, not a pretty sight: tipsy receptionists laugh and spill drinks on the rug, red-faced reporters loosen their belts and burp cocktail weiners
Arriving just in time for the door to  in our face
- woman stomps back over to her desk and picks up her pen
(dirty blond, striking, manic energy)
Ink- stained fingers, notepads in every pocket: Cass doesn't have time for office parties, she's working
Her door cracks open and  (almost as good looking as he thinks he is) appears, holding a Kahlua bottle
'm working, Stewart
Come on, take a break
(enticing) 've got Kahlua
Cass picks up a stapler and  it at Stewart's head
Stewart   just in time
The phone rings
Answering: Cassidy Daley

) It's Jimmy

) 've got a confirmed place and time
Cass is on her feet, excited

So, when

(
) You think 'm gonna say this shit over the phone

Just meet me at the usual place
Oh, and Cass
This one's gonna cost an extra hundred
He hangs up
Cass drops the phone, grabs her stuff
- Cass races for the elevator, Stewart hot on her heels: Where ya going
Hooters

Please
Nobody goes there for the hot wings
You got a tip
You got a hundred bucks on you
Stewart considers this, then hands her 5 20's
Now are you gonna let me in on it
Sorry
No can do
have to protect my source
You know what
We need to talk about our relationship
We don't have a relationship
We made out 3 years ago in the copy room

Yes, but you made out with me

She exits
He shouts after her: want in on that story
/ - Cass driving like a maniac, doing the one thing she loves: - -  -   (' ) ' - (20's, goatee, Mets baseball hat, nervous) sits in his car, rolling a cigarette while he waits for Cass
Jimmy puts the cigarette in his mouth and pulls out a lighter
Just as he flips the lighter open, (, heavyset, crew-cut, rarely speaks, all business) reaches through the broken window,
- Cass drives into the lot and pulls up next to Jimmy's car
Hey, Jimmy,
She realizes he is not in the car '
Jimmy
behind her
Cass glances up and sees ' The Chevy is racing out into traffic
Cass throws her car into reverse
' - Cass tries to follow the grey Chevy, but Shit
She looks around, decides fuck it, and Her car leaps into the intersection

Cass looks into her rearview mirror: , signalling for her to pull over
Up ahead, the Chevy is getting away
Cass debates: pull over
Or follow the story
No contest - Cass' car  down the street, ' - Cass is losing sight of the Chevy
She races around traffic and is suddenly
She panics,  the wheel to the right
- '    ,   , - Cass is out of her car now, arguing with a cop who has her by the arm: Let go of me, 'm a reporter, 'm warning you
The cop pulls her towards his squad car
Cass leans over and '
The cop screams
: "24  " -     ' : windswept hair, head tilted coyly, smile that says "'m on top of the world
Beneath the photo, the byline: " "
Someone whistles "We Wish You a Merry Xmas" as a improves on the photo: , -,
Then a enters frame, and
Milo

: ' / - Holding the flaming photo,  : rumpled shirt, messy hair, looks like he slept on the floor
The bartender (, 50's, Eastern European) scowls at him: What did  say about the fires
You said "please set fires in my bar"
Wait, no, that's not right
"Please don't set fires in my bar"
(off her look) Ok, jeez, you try to get in the holiday spirit
He drops the flaming photo to the floor, pours his drink on it, then
Shouldn't you be working
That's the beauty of my job, Crystal
Tracking down idiots is something you can do pretty much anywhere
See, there's one
He points to      , ' "  "
And there's another one
Pointing to
And there's
Glances at the , which is showing Looks closer, recognizes someone, groans: don't believe it
That idiot
(to Crystal) Save my seat
Tosses back his drink and

' - Milo climbs into a Cadillac: dents, patches of rust, cracked windshield, bumper askew
: half a block away,
- The man behind the wheel (, large, babyfaced, Metallica t-shirt) eats a hoagie as he watches Milo get into his car
There you are, you dipshit
He takes a last bite then tosses the sandwich and pulls away from the curb, tailing the Cadillac
- - the parade we just saw on
Baton twirlers in Santa Hats
Men dressed like reindeer, pulling a sleigh boys choir singing "Joy to the World", the kids dressed like orphans that escaped a Broadway musical
beautiful scene, if you like that sort of thing
- the Cadillac, half a block away, cruising sideways into a spot just beneath a " -" sign climbs out of the car
Shoves his way through the crowd to the curb, cracking open a can of Pabst
Milo does not like this sort of thing
He scans the crowd impatiently
Meanwhile,       parks half a block away
emerges and heads for: , who has just found what he's looking for
The reindeer are passing him and he makes eye contact with , who does a double-take
Yeah, you
Rudolph
Come here, you fucking ding-dong
Milo takes a step towards Rudolph and ' ,
We have to stop meeting this way
7
Not now, Dwight
You owe my boss money
() Hey,  owe everybody money
Suddenly,
Milo doubles-up, gasping, then     , Dwight goes flying sideways and -
Ouch
The barrier tips over, knocking over the one next to it Milo turns to see that Then he catches sight of the , working their way through the crowd
Milo lunges after him and Rudolph drags other reindeer with him as he tries to avoid Milo
Santa tumbles from the sled All of a sudden, '    : ,     , ,
Meanwhile, , who picks up one of the packages and throws it Just what Milo has been waiting for: () am so happy you did that
Milo
Around them, people scream and scatter
One boy bursts into tears: That man is killing Rudolph
Uh-oh
Cops  the scene, surrounding Milo and Rudolph,
The   (, short, over- zealous) steps forward: Release the reindeer
Release the reindeer
Milo looks around
He's got 8 or so guns pointed his way and Rudolph gasping at his feet Gelman bristles: Hands behind your head, asshole
8
Take it easy, skippy, 'm just doing my job
Milo flashes his
Gelman inspects it, rolls his eyes
Bounty hunter
Figures
Why don't you get a real job
So  can be like you patrol boys and sit around all day with my thumb up my ass
Gelman turns bright red
What did you just say
Suddenly, a sergeant (, late 30's, obnoxious but likeable, Milo's ex-partner) marches onto the scene, takes one look at Milo and laughs
Milo Boyd
shoulda known
Sarg, you know this asshole
Yeah
know this asshole
Guy used to be one of us
- ,  ,
- Milo drags Rudolph through the crowd towards his car
Bobby follows, shaking his head, bemused expression on his face
Look, Milo,  know this is a tough time of year for you
This isn't a tough time of year for me
It's Christmas
Who doesn't love Christmas
and  try to be sensitive to your situation
9
What situation
Being a man who works his own hours and has his freedom and lives the high life
because  realize you're unhappy
Unhappy
Are you kidding me, Bob
Look at me: 'm the happiest man alive
Just then, they come to where Milo left his car
'
Bobby squints at the huge "-" sign: That sign is pretty hard to see
And with that, Milo loses it: He rips the sign off the pole
Stomps on it
Kicks it
Tries to shred it with his teeth
Hmm
He doesn't really seem like the happiest man alive
Rudolph, to Bobby: Take me to jail
Please
' - Bobby's car is decorated with photos of his many children, all of whom look exactly like him, even the girls, poor kids
Milo's in front by Bobby, Rudolph's handcuffed in the back
Ok,  got one for ya: why doesn't Santa have any children
Cause he only comes once a year and when he does, it's down a chimney
Rudolph snickers
Milo does not
Bobby glances at Milo
So
Have you talked to her lately
Talked to who
10
Katie Couric, motherfucker, who do you think
haven't talked to her in three years, why would  talk to her now
Well, for one thing, so you can stop taking out your rage on innocent bystanders
(piping up from the back) Talk to her, man
For real
Milo reaches back, gags Rudolph with his own scarf
Do what you want
But this kind of shit will eat a hole in your intestines, you don't deal with it
/ - They pull up
Milo exits the car, pulls Rudolph from the back
Bobby leans out
Hey, why don't you come by the precinct tomorrow for our Xmas bash
'm not invited
'm not a cop anymore, remember
Fuck that, 'm inviting you
don't know, Bob
'm sorta busy
That's what 'm worried about
(sighing) Just
take it easy, Ok
Bobby really seems worried, but Milo waves him off
Bobby drives over, parks by other cop cars
Gets out, mingles with some cops
Laughter, inside jokes
Milo watches from afar
11
You should go to that party, man
Seriously
You need it
Do  look like  need advice from a grown man in antlers
Milo gags Rudolph and drags him into the station
: Milo
Hey
Princess
'  / - Hazy pieces: a tilting clock on the wall
battered metal desk
Filing cabinets, spitting up papers
man,  (wound sorta tight, Milo's best friend) peers down at us: You're drooling on my sofa
Milo unsticks his face from the leather couch, wobbles upright
Are the walls throbbing, or is it just him
You do have an apartment, don't you
With a bed of some kind
Milo grunts
Sid hands him a coffee
Heard you shut down 5th Street yesterday
Gave every kid in the county the gift of nightmares
Hey, 'm a giving kind of guy
Anyway, what do you care
brought your guy in, right
Milo holds out his hand, palm up
Sid '  / - Swearing under his breath, Sid is trying to stuff a Xmas tree into the back of a station wagon
At least half of the tree is hanging out of the back
Milo drinks a beer and watches
12
You gonna give me a hand, or just stand there killing your liver
Is that a trick question
Sid glares at him
Milo sighs, puts down his beer, and grabs part of the tree
So  told her, fine, 'd handle Xmas this year
mean, what's to handle
You buy a tree, some gifts, cook a ham, hang some lights
An idiot could do it
Well, we'll soon find out
Sid checks him out
You have plans for the holiday
The usual
Gonna drink some cheap whiskey and put your fist through a wall
Jealous
The tree is definitely not going to fit
They let it go, and Sid pulls out a small hand saw
Then forget it
Forget what
've got an open bond, but your thing sounds like more fun
'll give it to Doug instead
Sid starts hacking away at the tree
13
Whoa
Hold up, Heidi
What the fuck
want the job, 'm in the hole
You're always in the hole
What's your point
() The truth is, 'm not sure you're the right person for this job
It could be a total disaster
On the other hand, when one friend sees another friend stagnating in his own filth, he has to do something, right
Hey
just woke up
was gonna shower
Sid drops the saw
With one final shove, the tree is in
Phew
Sid slams the back shut
Ok
But remember: you asked for it
He reaches into his pocket and extracts Hands it to Milo
Milo unfolds it, gives it a quick look
second look
third
No
Yes
No
Yes
No
Are we done yet
14
Is this a joke
Because if it is, 'm gonna have to kill you
It's not a joke
She got arrested
And then she jumped bail
Apparently the whole thing started with some reckless driving, and ended with her assaulting a police officer
Milo gives him a questioning look
() She bit him
Milo snorts
Yeah
That sounds like her
But here's my question: why the hell did you post her bail
Hey,  know she dumped you
Whoa
She did not "dump me"
() Ok, whatever,
No, not "whatever"
dumped her
The point is, 'm aware you guys have issues, but 'm running a business here
person needs bail, don't have time to check with you first
Well, had you checked with me first, you wouldn't be out of a bond right now
15
'm not out of a bond if you go pick her up
It's five grand to bring her back by 9am, Xmas day
() You're telling me it's five grand to go pick up my ex-wife and bring her to jail
(beat) On Xmas
You're a good listener
Milo takes a deep, calming breath
Then he  into whoops and hollers
He throws himself into a snow bank and thrashes around
He does a Fred Astaire around a lamp post
take it you're interested
Milo grabs Sid and pulls him into a crushing bear hug
love you
You're the best friend a guy could ever have
Ok, take it easy
(mid 40's, overly made-up, popping gum) pokes her head out the front door: Sid, you got a  on line one
(off their looks) What's going on
Milo drops Sid, grabs Teresa, and gives   , He releases her
She stumbles back a bit
Ok
(beat) Can  have my gum back
Right
Sorry
He reaches into his mouth, extracts her gum and hands it to her
She retreats back inside
Milo beams at Sid
You know what this is, don't you
Karma
Payback
You know how they say "What goes around comes around"
Turns out it's true
() 16
(cont'd) (checking the paper) That middle initial stands for Rhonda, by the way
She tells people it stands for "Rachel", but that's a lie
Sid shakes his head
can't believe you guys broke up over a stupid article
We didn't break up over a stupid article
We broke up because she is a cheating, manipulative liar
Are you sure you can handle this
Why wouldn't  be able to handle this
Let's face it: you're not exactly rational around her
mean, if was a cop working a case and some reporter came snooping around, 'd say "no comment"
Not "no comment, but care for a cocktail"
And then a month later, running off to some love shack called "Caveman's Cabin" and tying the knot
Who does that
That's not even close to what happened
For one thing, it was called "Cupid's Cabin"
And for another, that was before  knew how conniving she was
Now  know
So all  have to do is track her down, cuff her up, and bring her in
(checking his watch) And 've got, what, two days
Shit, man
Easy as pie
Famous last words
Sid is regretting his decision as he watches Milo go dancing down the street

know where his bimbo wife takes her yoga classes,  know where his idiot son shoplifts after school, so he can pay me my money or
She comes to a sudden stop at: What the hell happened to you
, the guy who tried to collect from Milo, Milo Boyd
Fucker head-butted me
(not interested) Yeah
Did you get the money
He did not
Lorraine scowls

- Milo gets a cut and a shave
- Milo gets his shoes shined
' - freshly showered and shaved Milo packs for the job, singing at the top of his lungs: 18
Luck be a lady
He puts an empty duffle on the bed and starts filling it: ,  ,  ,
Toooo
He stares at his collection and smiles: (to his weapons) told you this day would come
Milo zips up the bag

He pulls out the job sheet and inspects it

Pulls out his cell phone, then hesitates
He glances around and sees a

Hurrying towards her car when she sees up ahead
She slips into a doorway, waiting for them to pass, when her phone rings
She checks it (" ") and answers: Jimmy
- Nope,
Milo doesn't speak
Cass listens for a moment
She can hear breathing
What the fuck
An evil grin crosses Milo's face
Cass goes pale
Milo takes a step forward
Cass takes a step back

19
You better run, you crazy bitch
'  '- Sid shuts his door, then speaks into his phone, low: Yeah
He took the job
But if this thing goes bad, 'm blaming you
He hangs up
- Milo sips from a coffee cup and watches: ' -
woman with a toy poodle emerges from the building, struggling with the heavy door
- Milo appears next to the woman and holds the door for her: Nice dog
Very compact
The woman exits and Milo enters
-    : 301, 302, 303
- Milo stops in front of 303, and knocks on the door
Candygram
No answer
Milo glances around, then works the lock
/-- Milo slips inside, pulling the door shut behind him
It's dark and quiet
He glides through the room, scoping it out
The place is huge, white rug and couch, flat screen
And lining the bookshelves are  , , : the home of a successful and dedicated journalist

Milo is halfway across the room when he realizes he has left a set of   across the formerly pristine white rug
Whoops

Nervous looks all around as she tries the knob
Surprise:
She hesitates
/-- -  , ,
Looks like Milo had a little field day here
He is taking a closer look at the shelves: no photos of a boyfriend, family, pets: '
He picks up one of the framed articles with the headline "       13TH "
There's a photo of -
Milo's face clouds over

Big grin as he replaces the frame and draws his gun
couple careful steps across the room and a floorboard

Grabs a heavy saucepan off the stove
Grips it like a weapon, soft-foots it towards the hallway

Positions himself up against the wall, waiting

Whoops
So, if we didn't know already: ' /-- Stewart is trying to explain himself to a skeptical Milo: (poor liar) so,  heard a noise in here and became concerned
Wrong
Try again
Ok, the truth is she asked me to pick up her dry-cleaning
22
Milo just waits
() Ok, Ok, look, she's working a big story that was supposed to be mine, and  want it back
Milo considers this
You sleeping with her, Stu
(turning red) You mean, like, at this moment
Yeah, that's what  mean
Are you sleeping with her at this very moment
We have a history, yes
"history", huh
(snorting) Good luck with that
' /-- Cass tries to coax the terrified cat out from under the sofa: Here, kitty kitty
Suddenly the  (as wide as she is tall) pops her head in the door, startling Cass: Aahh
You're not Jimmy
(recovering quickly) Oh
No
'm looking for him
Under the sofa
23
Maybe you can help
'm his girlfriend
() You're LaKeesha
Oh
Whoops
Yes
That's my name
LaKeesha
Maybe  should call the cops
Wait
Ok, look: Jimmy's in trouble
What kind of trouble
Money trouble
Drug trouble
(lower) Sex- change trouble
"Sex-change trouble"
Something like that
All  know is, he's missing

My cousin Linda fell off a cruise ship
Oh
'm sorry
Hey
grown woman outta know how to swim

Anyway
Mind if  take a quick look around
The landlady thinks this over
Jimmy's behind on his rent
bet his girlfriend would want to take care of that
- Dammit
24
bet she would
' /-- Milo explains, as he pokes around: The thing is, Stu, she'll make you think she's interested in you, when really all she's interested in is the case you're working on, because she wants to launch her big hot- shot career
It is just dawning on Stewart: Wait a second: you're Milo
She talks about you all the time
(immediately interested) Really
Oh yeah, dude
She hates you
Milo turns an angry red
Oh, she hates me
Yeah
She says you're the most selfish, immature, stubborn
() 'm selfish
'm immature
You know what
Forget it
'm not even gonna dignify this with
whatever
Hey, man, 'm on your team
No you're not, Geraldo
don't allow reporters on my team
Milo tosses some papers around on her desk furiously
25
And for the record: 'm the one who hates her
Just so that's clear
He picks up the phone and checks the last dialed number: it comes up "' "
Milo smiles
(to himself) That figures
Run home to mommy
Milo erases the number, then heads for the door
Well, nice meeting ya, Stu
Wait, where are you going
'm going to pick up your girlfriend
But don't worry, if she ever gets out of jail, 'm sure you'll be very happy together
Milo exits
Stewart hurries to the phone and checks it, but Milo erased the number
Shit
Stewart  to the window

She slips the envelope into her pocket just as the landlady appears: Time's up

() Ok, ok,  told one person about the Xmas Eve job, but she doesn't even have all the details,  swear
Mahler lets go of one of Jimmy's feet
Now Jimmy is hanging by one ankle
He starts to scream again
Gimme a name
/ - Milo gets in, on the phone with Sid: and this loser she's dating looks like he buys his clothes from Kmart
-: Sid is at home, trying to get the hacked up Xmas tree to stand up straight
His 5 and 6 year old sons beat on each other in the background
Why do you care
don't
just think it's funny
Hilarious
Listen to me: you guys made a terrible couple
know that
You don't have to tell me that
27
Relationships aren't about competition, they're about compromise
You mean like when your wife wants to do one thing, and you want to do another, and you compromise by doing what she wants
Exactly
Now just get her here
Cause  can't afford to lose this bond
No worries
In fact,  already know where she is and 'm gonna go pick her up right now

Milo Boyd
Ex-cop, current bounty hunter

lives in Jersey City, drives a 68 Caddy
Been in the hole on and off with us the past 3 years
We checked his place, his hangouts, no luck
28
This is no good
We let this guy slide, suddenly everybody thinks, hey, it's the holidays
All debts are cancelled
Get the word out, want this guy brought here so he can pay what he owes us, Dwight can break something of his, and we can all enjoy our Xmas
Ray nods and picks up the phone

: "1:00PM

" Milo exits his car and heads inside
, feeling super sly, pulls up to a space near Milo's car, but another car slips into the spot
That's my space, you asshole
'   - Milo knocks on the door
woman in heavy makeup (, Cass' mother) opens the door, takes one look at Milo,  the door shut
Milo waits
After a moment, Lois opens it again
Happy to see you, too
How dare you
after what you did to my baby
Lois bursts into tears and collapses into Milo's arms
Ok
What say we do this inside
'   - Men running around in gowns and feather boas
completely recovered Lois sits by a make-up mirror, adjusting a wig
Stuck to her mirror is a     , ,
Milo gives the photo a dirty look
29
What happened to the pirate show
got sick of it
Now 'm a female impersonator
But
you are female
That's why 'm so good at it
Help me with this
She stands and wiggles into an evening gown
Milo struggles with the zipper
Where is she, Lois
need to talk to her
Oh, Milo, where did it all go wrong
Do you have any idea what it means to waste a woman's child- bearing years
It's criminal
Every month her eggs are jumping out of her ovaries like sailors abandoning a sinking ship
mean,  know you were mad about that article
wasn't mad about that article
In fact: what article
Listen to me, Milo: Cassidy may be a strong independent woman on the outside, but on the inside she's just a girl who wants to be protected and loved by her man
What happened between the two of you devastated her
Devastated her right to the top
() She has done well, hasn't she
() 30
(cont'd) must admit, it makes me proud to think that my little girl, whose only friend growing up was an imaginary orphan with a tin leg named Leslie, now gets invited to tour the White House
Milo's jaw hits the floor
She got to tour the White House
Now he really wants to take Cass to jail
Tell me where she is, Lois
Oh, who knows
She was running around like a chicken with its head cut off, said she was on the biggest story of her career
Said she was going somewhere to think
Milo thinks this over, then a grin breaks out on his face
'   - Stewart has finally found a parking space, and is exiting his car when he sees Milo come out and jump into the Cadillac
Dammit
Stewart hurries back into his car
- Stands mobbed with people, horses galloping down the track, dust rising in their wake
- Surrounded by people cheering,
Notebook open, phone to ear, lap holding the plain envelope, ripped open, contents exposed:      : " " She has underlined "Sparrow" and made a list: "Person's name
Company
Hotel
Casino

(into phone) No one with that name
What about a casino
Nothing
Thanks
She clicks over to an incoming call, " ": Jimmy
-: , at the mobbed track entrance, lost and frustrated: No, who's Jimmy
Look, Stewart, 'm busy
Ok
(casually) Where are you, by the way
mean, exactly
'm in Miami, if you must know
'm on the beach building a sand castle and drinking from a coconut
Someone taps her shoulder
She glances up and sees: , ,
She slowly closes her phone, not bothering to say goodbye
Hello, Cass
Hello, Milo
'
Surprise, anger, anxiousness
All the mixed emotions you have when you suddenly run into
Fancy meeting you here
Yeah
Fancy that
Strange, charged moment as they look at each other
Then they have a casual contest: 32
How are you
Fine
You
Swell
Nice day
Bright
Brisk
Crisp
Invigorating
(can't hold out anymore) What are you doing here
Milo smirks
"Building a sand castle, drinking from a coconut"
Man, once a liar, always a liar
Cass immediately stands
You know what
don't have time for this, 'm working
She grabs her stuff
Milo blocks her with his leg
Working
Hey, me too
Congratulations
Move your leg
Milo doesn't budge
Spelling it out for her: What  do is,  track down criminals
People who jumped bail
Idiots who decided to go on the run after biting police officers find them, and  take them to jail
33
Cass stares at him, eyes wide: Now, hold on just a second, Milo
Tell you what: 'll give you more than a second
'll give you 10
For old times sake
Milo moves his leg, kicks back, starts to count

Cass stares at him, her jaw working, trying to decide what to do
Then, all of a sudden, she
Milo smiles : " '

She tries again, then hears soft laughter
, Strike one
Cass leaps from the car and runs
- Cass runs for the elevator
It opens and people exit, : Strike two
Cass turns heel and bolts
- Cass races out, flagging a taxi
Milo pulls up: Strike three
Get in
'm not going to jail, Milo

beg to differ
She heads for the cabs
Milo exits his car,
Oh please
Like you're gonna shoot me
Nope
(loudly) 'm gonna shoot a cab driver
Head whip around in his direction -
Cass stomps her foot, furious
Chicken shits
Cass marches back over to Milo
Ok, look: let's talk about this
Ok
With that, Milo sweeps her up into his arms Cass stares at Milo
Is he gonna kiss her
Again, she feels weird
Confused
() Listen, Milo, 'm not sure we should
Suddenly,
Hey, wait a minute
He smiles at her, waves, then  down the lid
Well, now she knows exactly how she feels: : (
) Bastard
: "2:00
9
43   "
35
And immediately:
(
) Great
Perfect timing
match is struck, illuminating the trunk as Cass scrambles for her phone
Trying to sound professional: Cassidy Daley
-: - , head tilted back, tense smile on his face
a little to reveal the It's me
Jimmy
(exhaling with relief) Shit, Jimmy,  thought you were dead
Don't be silly
(hurrying on) Listen: you didn't happen to go to my place and find that envelope left, did you
did, but  don't really get it, what's "Sparrow"
It doesn't matter
Did you tell anyone else about this story
Are you kidding
You think  want to share a story like this
Ok
Good
Cause the truth is, there is no story
made the whole thing up
So you should just drop it
Uh-uh, no way are you backing out on me now, Jimmy
This story is way too good
36
Mahler nudges Jimmy
() Where are you
'm at the Atlantic City Boardwalk
Actually, 'm in the trunk of my ex- husband's car
Long story
More importantly, where are you
'm
- she stares at her phone
Uh-oh: Jimmy
Hello
Suddenly,    and we hear : (
) Deck the halls with boughs of holly, fa la la la laaaa
- Now Milo really is the happiest man alive
He pulls out his cell phone, dials: -: Teresa removes her gum, sticks it on her mouse-pad, answers: Sid's Bail Bonds
Guess who's in my trunk
Is that some sort of perverted innuendo
Who is this
Aw, come on, Teresa, you know it's me
Put Sid on
37
Sid's busy shopping
(snorts) He thinks he can handle Xmas
Ok, just tell him  got her and 'll be back in 2 hours
want a bonus for bringing her in so quick
Yeah
want a bonus for getting through the holidays without stabbing anyone with a fork
Don't be such a pessimist
You still have time
His phone beeps
'
Gotta go
got another call
He clicks over
Tina's Thai massage
Where every ending is a happy one
-: Cass rolls her eyes
You're disgusting
Let me out of the trunk
Hmm
Nope
By the way, your boyfriend Stewart's been following me
Unfortunately,  had to ditch him at the track
Why is Stewart
(realizing) And wait: who said he's my boyfriend
Aw, don't be embarrassed
These things happen
You were drunk when you guys hooked up, right
Cass turns bright red
She was drunk when they hooked up
Changing tactics, she tries to flatter him: 38
You know what, Milo
shouldn't have run from you like that was
don't know
You caught me off-guard
The truth is, 'm kind of in some trouble and  could really use your help
Bad news for you, then
wouldn't help you if you were the very last baby sea turtle in the world, dragging its tiny weak body across the burning hot sand while sea gulls circled overhead
'd just pull up a chair, sip a pina colada, and let nature take its course
Long beat
Suddenly,
, Milo listens for a moment, out of a purely clinical interest, then: Hey,  used to be a sucker, but no more
You can cry til the cows come home, for all  care
Cass instantly stops crying and slams her phone shut
Then, the sound of a trunk opening, and ,   :
- Mahler reaches into his trunk and
Checks the cartridge, pockets the gun
Slams the trunk shut
He climbs into his front seat, and as he pulls out of the lot, we see ' , on the passenger seat
- Milo drives along happily humming when, suddenly, drifts over his shoulder
What the hell
He glances into the rearview mirror and: Holy shit
(calling out) Hey, um, Cass
(no response) Cassidy
39
Still nothing
Milo jerks the car to the right, and  on the brakes
- The car screeches to a halt on the embankment
Milo leaps out of the driver's door and races to back, fumbling with his keys
It's Ok, hang on, 'm coming
Gets the key in, pops the lid and sees: , ,
Cass tosses the matches and handkerchief,
Milo groans and crumbles to the ground
Cass jumps out of the trunk and stands over him: You know something, Milo
You're one of the most gullible
, Milo grabs her ankle and  and Cass hits the ground
Next thing you know, '  , Milo gets her pinned, but Cass grabs his ear and : He pulls her arm behind her back
Ow ow ow
and she jerks her head back,  him in the nose
Son of a
He gets her in a
and she  him
40
Finally, he has her on her back,
He gets his face right over hers and Uncle, uncle, uncle
Milo collapses onto the ground next to her, laughing
She looks at him and she starts laughing too
Dirty fighter
Me
'm the dirty fighter
They both laugh harder
Then Milo stands and offers her a hand
She takes it, and he helps her up
Awkward pause as they look at each other
Should we
don't know
hug, or something
Sure
What the hell
He opens his arms
She moves closer
They hug
Milo feels her hands moving towards the gun in his belt
He smirks
Hey
had to try, right
Get in the car
- They are driving along, both a little dishevelled, '
They pass casinos as they head out of Atlantic City
Your windshield's cracked
Thanks, Captain Obvious
Cass turns to inspect him more closely
41
And you look like shit, Milo
What have you been doing, sleeping on the floor
Milo has been sleeping on the floor
enjoy sleeping on the floor
Matter of fact,  love sleeping on the floor
love everything about my life
Great job, good friends, hot girlfriend
You have a girlfriend
(he does not) Yes  do
Cass is skeptical: Really
What's her name
(the first name that pops into his head:) Teresa
Rocking hot body
Likes to cook pasta for me and perform strip- teases
Wow
Is she missing a chromosome
Oh, she has all her chromosomes, believe you me
Cass thinks this over, then counters: Well, my life is great, too
can tell
You and Stewart make a great couple, by the way
You and me made a terrible couple
But you two
Like peas in a pod
About to deny that she and Stewart are a couple, it occurs to Cass: Milo seems a little
She jumps on this: 42
You know what  like about Stewart
can't imagine
He's not you
Not even on his best day
Or his worst
'll bet he has a lot of those
Still betting, huh
You can't win if you don't play
Or, in your case, even if you do
He shoots her a sharp look
She stares back, waiting
win all the time
Really
hadn't noticed
Ok
That is definitely a challenge
You know what
Seeing as how 'm about to come into five grand
Milo makes a      and pulls into the parking lot of '
think 'll do a little betting right now
Don't you have to take me back
Please
have two days
monkey could get you back in two days
43
Again: famous last words
Milo exits the car
Cass smiles to herself
This is obviously what she hoped would happen
She glances around, spots   in the back seat Hmm
- Milo opens her door
Aren't you afraid 'll get away
Nope
He uncuffs her from the door,
- Stewart is heading back to the city, cursing his bad luck, when he happens to glance over and see '
Damn, 'm good
He makes a quick turn off the highway and into the Bally's parking lot
' - The clerk at the chips cage recognizes Milo as he and Cass : Merry Xmas, Mr Boyd
Behind the clerk, a   perks up at this name
What a nice surprise
Let's hope your luck is better today
Milo glances at Cass
() Sure, if there's such a thing as better than great, which is how my luck has been lately
Great
44
() Oh
Yes sir
Of course
My mistake
While the clerk is counting out chips, - Lorraine on the phone, listening intently
Then she hangs up, grinning
The idiot just showed up at Bally's
() 'm on it
Uh-uh
Not you
(calling out)
appears next to her
Go get this asshole
Ray cracks his knuckles, smirks at Dwight, and exits
'  - Milo sits at a blackjack table, pulling Cass into a seat next to him
Prepare to observe the master
He bets while Cass sits next to him, scheming: Ok, how about this: She uses her free hand to pull out her wallet: If  give you all the cash in my wallet, will you let me go
Hmm
Lemme see
45
He takes the cash from her and thinks for a moment
Nope
Guess not
Milo adds her cash to his bet on the table
(to the dealer) Hit me
'd really like to
The dealer deals the cards
Dealer wins
Nice going, master
Milo quickly lays out some more money
(smells like an ashtray) appears: And for the couple over here
() We're not a couple
(just as quick) Why would you think we were a couple
We used to be together
Back when was young and foolish
And  was confused
And  was slumming
And  was drunk
The waitress looks back and forth between them
46
() Great story
have to get back to work now
Wait
Champagne
'm celebrating
The waitress rolls her eyes and leaves
Milo turns to see he has lost more money
(under his breath) Son of a bitch
Ok
Cass has had enough of this
She leans closer: Look, Milo, the truth is
my Mom is in the hospital
Milo perks up
Oh
Old Lois not feeling up to par
She might be really sick
That's why  had to jump bail
(overly sincere) Taking care of her, huh
Putting aside your career for a loved one
Golly, that's so you
"Golly"
Cass stares at him, realizing: You've already been to see her
Impressive
No wonder you got all those awards
So lemme guess: the real reason you jumped bail is cause you're on a story
Cass narrows her eyes: Stewart
Stewart told you
47
() would have figured it out on my own, trust me
wouldn't trust you if you were the last man alive
You think about that much
Me being the last man alive
Am  naked in this fantasy
Cass takes a deep breath
This is getting her nowhere
But she is clearly hesitant to give him the real story
Ok, you're right
'm on a story
very important story
It just so happens that 'm possibly about to uncover a whole ring of dirty cops
Milo snorts
What
Please
Isn't the whole "dirty cop" thing kind of old
Maybe you should do a story about something people are interested in
Like internet porn
Or lesbians
'm serious, Milo
This is gonna be big
And here's what 'm willing to do (magnanimous): 'm willing to credit you in the article
Oh, sure, like you credited me in the 13th Street Article
Cass stares at him
Why on earth would  have credited you
worked my ass off for that story
That's one way of putting it
48
What's that supposed to mean
Forget it
don't want to be in your article
In fact,  would rather eat a bowl of broken glass than have my name in any way associated with one of your lousy articles
Fine
Forget  mentioned it
already have
mean, you're not a cop anymore, right
What do you care if people were murdered
Please
Nobody was murdered
Just my source
() Oh yeah
How
Bullet to the back of the head
Well
Dumped in a reservoir
() don't know
Car accident
Ok, ok, maybe he wasn't murdered yet
But  wouldn't be surprised if
Milo breaks out into loud guffaws
Cass is furious
49
Maybe this whole thing sounds like no big deal to you
You know what it sounds like
It sounds like you're going to jail
Cass can't believe this
Milo, listen, you have to believe me, come on, you know me
(getting red) Exactly
do know you
Which means know you are a deceptive, cold- hearted bitch who is going to jail where she belongs
Wow
That was pretty harsh
Cass looks at him, stunned
They stare at each other in silence
The waitress arrives with the drinks: Champagne
So
What are we celebrating
() have to use the bathroom
Alrightee, then
Cheers
'   - Stewart taps his steering wheel restlessly, watching the door of the casino for signs of Cass and Milo
Waiting in this parking lot is boring
Finally, he exits his car
Sidles over to Milo's car
Checks the door handle
'
Stewart glances around, then climbs in
'  - Cass enters and Milo follows: Can  have some privacy, please
50
Milo checks the room
Looks like there is no escape from here
He  , but then: 'm gonna have to frisk you
Get it over with, then
Milo checks her pockets
Her ankles
Her legs
He goes behind her and checks her shoulders
Her back
He reaches around and checks her belly
You gain a little weight
(snapping back) You lose a little hair
Milo reaches higher and: Yeah
Right
'm hiding a weapon in my breasts
Milo backs off, turning red
Make it quick
He exits
As soon as he is gone,   ' - Stewart is rummaging around inside Milo's car when he looks up and sees: , standing there, smiling at him
Shit, man, you startled me
(beat) Can  help you
Night-night
Suddenly, Ray  ' ,
- Milo checks his watch, then raps on the door
51
You almost done in there
- Cass squints at the taser gun, trying to read the tiny instruction label on the side: "Put open end in direct contact with skin
Press button
" (
) Hello
Ok, that's long enough, 'm coming in
He comes in and , ,
- ,
Sorry
and keeps going
She hurries to the curb and tries to flag down a ride
-   , '
Mahler compares her to the newspaper photo he is holding
Yup: '
Cass glances around, keeping an eye out for Milo, and Suddenly, he starts heading towards her
Cass backs up slightly, nervous
Need a lift
Cass looks around
trucker has pulled up next to her
Relieved, she quickly climbs on board
- ,
He doesn't seem worried
He turns and heads for his car
- Cass is fixing her hair, pulling herself together
52
He says we made a terrible couple
Which is true
know that
'm the one who thought that first
'm the one who came up with that
The fact is,  don't want to be with someone who can't admit he was wrong
So you're available
Cass looks at him
He smiles coyly
Available for what
have a waterbed in my trailer
hope you don't think you're telling me something that interests me
You know what  want for Xmas
The driver mouths something at her we can't see
Cass leans over and
- The truck  to a halt by the side of the road
Cass gets booted out the passenger door
The door is slammed shut behind her
Cass gives the guy the finger as he drives off
She turns to see a car headed her way
She starts flagging it down
But wait
Yup, '
Shit
She looks around, but where's she gonna go
Meanwhile, as Milo nears, Cass stares
He keeps coming, an evil look on his face
She turns and
- Milo is laughing
You better run
53
- Cass runs into a field
Milo drives off the road and follows
He gets her cornered by a pen
He looks triumphant
She scowls
Then she throws open the pen,
Now she looks triumphant
He scowls
-    ' ,  ' -
Hey, it's locked
() know
: Open the door, you son of a bitch
Finally, Milo opens it
She just before the
Cass and Milo watch, stunned, as the bull looks at them for a moment,   ,
Milo and Cass hear a strange sound, and look over to see     , Uh-oh
, : "5:00
9
40
" - Lorraine waves Dwight over
Ray's got something to show you
Merry Xmas
54
Ray  open the bathroom door to reveal: ,
Stewart blinks up at them, disoriented
Lorraine hands Dwight
Pick something and break it
Whoa, wait just a minute
Feel better
You know,  do feel better
(beat) Who is this guy, anyway
Lorraine and Ray stare at him
Milo Boyd
That's not Milo Boyd
He was in Milo Boyd's Cadillac
They all look at Stewart, who moans in pain
Both of you go this time, and make sure you get the right guy
don't have time for this shit
What about me
Lorraine considers him for a moment, then  the bathroom door in his face
- Milo and Cass are back on the highway, both looking a little worse for wear
Milo's nose is swollen, Cass' clothes are muddy
55
Milo He smirks at Cass
Clever
(noting all the weapons) Wow
You were gonna use all that stuff on me
guy can dream, can't he
He turns his attention back to the road
Cass studies his profile
Ok, look, Milo, let's just clear the air, Ok
So maybe it was a mistake, thinking we could be involved while working on the same case
Hey,  know it was a mistake
Don't think you're telling me something don't know, cause you're not
(deep breath) Ok
Fine
But can we just put aside our differences for two seconds
Because back at the casino,  think saw someone following me
Sure that wasn't me
don't think so
This guy was lacking your trademark smell of booze and
Ha ha
Milo surreptitiously sniffs himself
Anywho
If these dirty cops have my source hostage somewhere
Milo starts to laugh
Cass flushes: What's so funny
56
You think dirty cops are trying to kill you
Look,  know you think you're hot shit and everything, but 'm pretty sure the only one around here who might want to kill you is me
Cass     in the rearview mirror, gets a look at the driver and goes pale
Oh no
What
Behind us
It's him
The guy  saw back at the casino
Milo glances into the mirror, checking the guy out
Yeah
He doesn't look like a cop to me
(freaking out) Speed up
Would you just calm down for a second and
Cass kicks a leg over and
The car  forward
Jesus christ
Milo tries to push her foot off the gas while they wrestle for the wheel
-
,
57
She points past him
Milo turns to see ,    '
They both duck as Mahler starts firing and
- -  '  , - Cass is hunched over in the passenger seat, excited and frightened at the same time
Mahler pulls alongside them again and Milo  the wheel to the left,     '
Mahler's car goes skidding across the road, hits a ditch and - The cadillac  away, leaving Mahler's car behind
- The Cadillac is parked on the shoulder, Milo changing the tire, Cass standing by the passenger door, still handcuffed, : 58
told you they were trying to kill me
Yeah, well, no one's killing you until  get you to jail
Cass whips her head around to look at him: You're still taking me to jail
But it's the cops who are after me
First of all: that guy was not a cop
Second of all, we just left him unconscious in a ditch
You'll be fine
But
this is important
This is my job
And this
(pointing between them) is my job
Milo, you don't understand what's going on
Milo rolls his eyes and straightens up
'll lay it out for you: some loser with a minor sheet calls you up and says, hey, 've got a big story for you, you interested
It'll only cost you a couple hundred bucks, and 'll tip you onto some criminal activity, it's your chance to expose some bad guys and write the story of your life
Then the moron gets himself caught, he's probably in cold storage somewhere, and now you think the bad guys are after you
(beat) See
get it
just don't care
Milo finishes with the tire, throws the jack in the back, and heads back around to the driver's seat
59
Cass watches him closely, getting an idea
She reaches into her pocket and pulls out the paper from Jimmy
() If only  knew exactly when and where this deal was going down
Course, if  can't figure out that part, then you definitely can't figure out that part, because we both know 'm much smarter than you
Milo flinches, then forces a laugh
Please
My brain can dance circles around your brain
don't even know what that means
Case closed
() Fine
Guess we'll never know
Milo hesitates
Then decides: fuck it
He strides around the car and  the paper from her hand
He reads: "Atlantic City
Xmas Eve
Sparrow
" What's "Sparrow"
knew you couldn't figure it out
() It's a business
No
Casino
Nope
Stripper
60
don't think so
What kind of strip bars have you been going to, anyway
Milo stares at the paper, wracking his brain
Cass sighs loudly and  the paper back
Oh, well, forget it,  knew you couldn't do it
Please
could crack that story and still get you to jail on time
Oh yeah
Cass stares him in the eye and says the magic words: Wanna bet
Milo stares at her
She stares back
Long beat
Milo's face is red
He clenches his fists
He unclenches them
Fuck
He thrusts out his hand: You're on
They shake
have to make a call
He starts to walk away
Hey
Aren't you going to uncuff me
Why
You going somewhere
Um
no
Then you don't need to be uncuffed
61
- Cass sits in the passenger seat and watches in the rearview mirror while Milo paces behind the car, on the phone
(to herself) Asshole
- Milo is talking to Sid: So there's just gonna be a little delay
-: - Sid's at the mall
On Dec 23rd
With all the other desperate, last-minute shoppers
In other words, '
don't get it
Why are you helping her
But that's the beauty of it, Sid, 'm not helping her, she only thinks 'm helping her
Yeah
If you're not helping her, what are you doing
Milo notices Cass watching him and turns his back slightly
- Cass narrows her eyes: (to herself) What is he up to
- Milo is making this up as he goes along: 62
'll tell you what 'm doing: 'm gonna crack this case first, and 'm gonna take all the credit
Who knows, maybe 'll even get my job back
You are so full of shit
You don't want your job back
You just want to prove you're smarter than she is
(instantly heated) am smarter than she is
would have cracked that 13th Street case way before she did if she hadn't
cheated, right,  know, you've told me a million times
Did it ever occur to you that a normal couple wouldn't compete the way you guys do in the first place
Sid spots what he is looking for
So does another last-minute shopper
They both reach for the toy
This from the man currently trying to prove to his wife he can handle Xmas
(instantly heated) can handle Xmas
Sid  the toy from the other shopper
Just
trust me, Ok
Do  have a choice
Nope
Milo hangs up and gets in the car
63
- The cadillac pulls a -turn and : "6:00
9
39
" (
) So
Atlantic City
Xmas Eve
- Milo buys a chili dog while talking to Cass who stands next to him, handcuffed
so what exactly are these dirty cops supposed to be doing
Stealing evidence from property rooms
Then destroying it, for the right price
Milo stares
What
Nothing
It's just
it's a good idea
If it weren't, you know
Wrong
(continuing) So
Your plan is to catch them red-handed before they can destroy the evidence, then write an expose for the paper and win yourself another big award
Something like that
Only, you don't know what Sparrow is
(thinking) Could be a nickname
Or the place where the evidence is stashed
Or a code word of some kind
But the guy who knows has gone missing, and you think the dirty cops got a hold of him
64
() When Jimmy called earlier, someone else was there
And they disconnected the call
Milo is staring at her
So we find your source, we find the dirty cops
Gimme your phone
She hands it to him
Milo checks the record of incoming calls and smiles
What
(
) Milo
Merry Xmas
-: - Bobby talks into his cell phone while supervising a parade of hookers being loaded into a van: Here's one: why did the snowman pull down his pants
Cause he heard the snowblower was coming
Funny
Listen, Bob,  need a favor
Anything
need an address to go with a phone number
But  need it
Kinda got a guy on my tail
- tow truck is pulling up, towing Mahler's car
The tow truck driver turns to Mahler, who is in the passenger seat: The garage is closed for the night
Guess you'll have to wait til tomorrow
65
Mahler thinks this over, then The driver crumples in his seat
Guess not
Mahler leans across him, opens the driver's side door, and him out of the cab
- The tow truck is driving away from the garage
- Milo climbs back into the car, holding a piece of paper with the words "Trump Casino, room 2504" on it
He grins at Cass
Pretty proud of yourself, ey
Hey
You're a reporter
Great
But used to be a cop
Let's face it: 'm naturally gonna be one step ahead of you
(under her breath) You weren't last time
Milo whips his head around: What did you say
said you're doing a great job
- The Trump Casino on the strip, coming into view
- Milo pulls into the crowded parking lot and checks the cartridge of his gun
Beside him, Cass is bubbling over with excited energy: 66
Ok, here's what  think we should do: 'll go up first, Jimmy knows me, so if anything's wrong 'm sure he'll give me a sign
Excellent plan
Oh, except you're staying in the car
Milo exits the car
(shouting after him) But
it's my story
But he is already headed for the casino entrance
He waves at her and disappears inside
Asshole
- Milo glides through the casino, past the blinking lights of the slot machines, headed for the elevators
in a Hawaiian shirt is coming towards him and (steadying the guy) You Ok
My bad
Watch where you're going
(under his breath) Prick
The drunk guy continues past
Milo holds up : (calling after him) Merry Xmas to you, too
25TH - The elevator dings and Milo exits
He turns a corner and heads down the hall
Another elevator  behind him
Milo continues down the hall
Suddenly, he  and looks behind him
No one is there
67
He turns another corner and  2504
There is a " " sign on the door 2505
Room service
No answer
He glances down the hall and sees a slight movement
He moves away from the door, continues down the hall, - Milo hits the light switch off and waits just inside the door
Someone steps in, and The person
Milo slaps a hand across the person's mouth and switches on the light
And finds himself face to face with: What the
He looks at the handcuff dangling from her wrist, (loud whisper) What the hell are you doing
() It's my story,  don't break stories by staying in the car
Yeah, well, (re: the armrest) you're paying for that
Oh, ok
Here's a nickle
Suddenly, Milo goes still
as someone creeps down the hall
Milo puts a finger to Cass' lips
Then he peeks out the door
' - The maid stops by a room and enters
68
Perfect
(to Cass) Play along
- Milo passes the maid's cart, glancing at her , then continues on to room 2505
He uses the on the door
Of course,  '
() Godammit
Son of a bitch
The maid peeks out into the hall
(to Cass) This is like the third card they've given me
(playing along) Take it easy, honey
Don't tell me to take it easy, now we have to go all the way downstairs again
Cass looks pleadingly at the maid
What's the name
Davenport
Room 2505
The maid checks her chart, then crosses the hall and You're an angel
Milo and Cass go inside
2505- Milo closes the door carefully behind them, then tiptoes across the room to the connecting door, Cass close on his heels
All is silent
69
() Wait a second: where's my gun
() don't know
Where is your gun
don't have one
Then you've answered your own question
Milo tiptoes closer to the door
Cass pulls on his sleeve
Come on, give me something
You've got, like, a million weapons in the jacket
She reaches for his jacket, and Milo pulls away
Hey
These are not toys
You can't just give them to someone and have them know how to use them
seem to remember doing just fine with your taser gun
They are at the door
Milo puts a finger to his lips and tries the doorknob:
He is about to work the lock when No time to do this quietly
, - Halfway down the hallway, Nervous, she backs away, headed for the elevators
2504- Milo    , Milo clicks it off and checks the room
The place appears to be deserted
He crosses to the bathroom and peers in:
70
Meanwhile, Cass has cautiously entered the room and sees spots on the rug: Oh, god, is that blood
Hey
Columbo
Wait by the door
'm just trying to
This could be a crime scene
There are clues all over this room that only a trained eye can find
And as seem to recall, you were the one who was unable to figure this out by herself
Oooh
Cass grits her teeth
(under her breath) He is unbelievable
Who are you talking to, your imaginary friend Leslie
() Hey
Lots of kids have imaginary friends, despite what my mother believes
Whatever
You wait by the door
And 'll handle this
() Fine
She moves back to the door
As she does, she notices a matchbook on the floor: ' So you're saying you don't want my help
'm saying  don't need your help
71
() Ok
As he turns away,
Milo catches this movement out of the corner of his eye and glances back: What was that
() What was what
Did you find something
How could  find anything
'm not the detective
Lemme see your purse
Milo takes a step closer to her, but: Cass and Milo turn to see ,
Milo rolls his eyes
Hotel security
Stay where you are
Ok, Ok, no problem
You're probably gonna want this
Milo holds up
() ,
Take it easy
'm just gonna unload it
Milo drops the cartridge, then '
72
The guard instinctively raises his hands and Milo him, tackling him to the ground, then handcuffing him to the table
Milo  Cass hand and races from the room
- Cass and Milo run up to the elevators
: -
Milo hits the fire alarm and pulls Cass into the stairwell
- Milo and Cass are almost to the bottom, Milo looks up ,
Shit
Milo cracks the stairwell window and peers out:   4
You're gonna have to jump
can't
Milo considers this, then picks her up and - Cass screams as she falls
Milo falls next to her
They fall and fall and : Seconds later, they are on their feet,
(
) Ok, so some guy you're looking for has disappeared
You want me to put out an all-points on him
- Milo and Cass are speeding away from the Trump Casino
(into phone) The thing is, Bob: Cass thinks dirty cops might be involved
73
-: - Bobby is in his office
His door opens onto the squad room, busy with police activity
Bobby sits up straighter in his chair
Whoa, whoa, whoa
You're with Cassidy
Shit, Milo, you know when you're around her your brain turns to mush
Yeah, well, that doesn't change the fact that someone took a couple shots at us
Beat
You get a plate number
Happened too quick
But it was a dark 4-door Chevy, blue or grey, New Jersey plates, and the car was wrecked,  know that
Bobby thinks this over
Ok
Lemme look into it
See what can find
Just hold tight, Ok
Milo checks his watch
Ok
But we're kinda on a clock here
Milo, don't fuck around with this
If there are dirty cops in the house, we all have a problem
So do me a favor: get off the strip, find somewhere to lie low and wait for my call
74
- The scene has calmed down a little
appears and exit the car, looking like a an ugly, dangerous Odd Couple
An employee slips out the back door and hands Ray a Dwight snatches the photo from Ray
Yeah, that's him
Who's the chick
Who gives a fuck
Anyway, they can't be far
It's true
They aren't too far
They are: 9- ,  &
Xmas lights winking on the trees, "Come All Ye Faithful" gently wafting out the oak front door
: "9:00

" The whole scene looks beautiful, peaceful, romantic
(
) Ok
Kill me now
, parked in front : "  ' "
Yup
The place Milo and Cass ran off to and got married 3 years ago
'm sorry, it's the only place know off the strip
'm not going in
What if they remember us
They won't remember us
Why would they remember us
Just
try to act normal
75
&- small, family-run, luxury bed and breakfast
The kind of place that prides itself on its service
(long, graying hair, glasses, moccasins) greets them with a smile: Can  help you
(realizing) Wait, it can't be
She looks behind her at a bulletin board
At photos of all the happy couples who have passed through her
And finds: ,    , ,
(to the back room) Edmund, come quick
balding man in flannel comes out, takes one look, and clasps both hands to his chest
Be still my beating heart
() Looks like they remember us
() Ya think
What a lovely surprise
It's been, what, 3 years
Milo and Cass both try to downplay: Has it
don't really remember
() And you came back
To celebrate your anniversary
Oh, no
No, no
76
What an honor for us
Actually, we're not
You know what
In light of this special special occasion: it's on the house
Before Cass can protest more,
Honey
Can  talk to you
He pulls her slightly aside
() You have any money
() No, as you recall,  gave you all my money at the blackjack table
(realizing) You blew all the money
Hey
would have won it back if someone hadn't tasered me in the bathroom
So
Use a credit card
Mine's max'd
Lemme have yours
Mine's max'd too
(off his look) What,  like to shop
They give each other a horrified look as they both realize what this means
Then they turn back to the couple, put their arms around each other, and smile: / It's our third anniversary
/ Congratulations
77
/ Thanks
Milo and Cass snuggle closer
He surreptitiously squeezes her ass
She surreptitiously  on his foot
& -- Full of couples in love
Young couples, old couples, gay couples, straight couples
Even a dog couple snuggled up by the fire
And then there's Milo and Cass, bruised and dishevelled, being served an elaborate romantic meal
They smile uncomfortably as Edmund arrives with a tray of oysters: To begin: a little aphrodisiac
He gives them both a broad wink
() Wow
() Great
So tell me: how have you managed to keep the romance alive all this time
Well, 'll tell you, Edmund
The secret to our success is that the little woman here knows her place
She cleans for me, cooks for me, and every night when  come home she gets down on her knees and massages my feet
He beams at Cass
Cass grins through her teeth
Yes, Edmund, it's true
massage his feet to help him feel like a man
It's important, especially when your husband has such a teeny tiny
Just then, Dawn hustles over, interrupting: 78
How is everything
Is it like that magical night 3 years ago
Uh-huh
Yup
You betcha
This calls for a toast
She raises a glass, tapping it with a spoon
Milo and Cass both groan under their breath
(to the room) May  have your attention please
Edmund and  would like to share with you the most romantic moment we have ever seen
It was three years ago today, in this very restaurant, when this lovely young man here, right in the middle of the meal, threw down his napkin, got down on one knee, and said marry me, right now, right this second,  want to go to sleep tonight knowing you're my wife
(jumping in) And she said yes, with tears in her eyes and a tremble in her hand, let's get married, and they ran out to the all night chapel and came back an hour later, man and wife
The whole restaurant starts clapping
Milo turns to Edmund: Can  get a whiskey
Make that two
& - Milo and Cass stumble down the hall, laughing hysterically, falling down drunk
79
After we broke up,  was so mad at you,  told everyone  know you have herpes
told everyone you flunked out of 3rd grade
told everyone you have a moustache
told everyone you like to wear my panties
Hey
This one is obviously true
Both laugh harder
&  - Milo and Cass stagger in, blinking hazily at their new surroundings
heart-shaped bed
Champagne
bubble bath fireplace
The works
Like Cupid threw up in here
The laughter slowly fades
Long beat
Then: Wow
This would be really awkward if we still had feelings for each other
Which we don't
That's right
Luckily, we're different people now
We don't feel the way we used to
Right
We've moved on
We have no feelings about each other whatsoever
Just two people who used to know each other
Two casual acquaintances
80
Feels good, doesn't it
Feels fantastic
platonic relationship
Working together
Helping each other
Trusting each other
Which reminds them:  '
Awkward pause
Then: Well
Mind if  shower
Ladies first
Cass disappears into the bathroom, closing the door behind her
Beat
Then
& - ,
She reaches over and turns on the shower
&  - As soon as Milo hears the water, : & - Cass is seated on the toilet lid,    : () Hey
It's me
(
) Sheryl
81
- Mom is at a gay bar, having a cocktail
No, not Sheryl
Cass
(beat) Your daughter
Jesus Christ, where the hell are ya, Niagara Falls
No
You're not gonna believe this, but: 'm at Cupid's Cabin with Milo
() Oh my god
Mom
always knew you two would
Mom
We're not back together
Long beat
Why the hell not
&  - Milo is looking through Cass' purse While searching through her wallet, he suddenly stumbles across Huh
He glances at the bathroom door
She carries their wedding photo around
& - Cass listens while Mom rants: 82
mean,  just don't get it, you're in this romantic place, you have a perfect opportunity to win him back
Why should  have to win him back
He should have to win me back
And who says  want him back, anyway
have never understood this competitive streak of yours
(losing her patience) Look, the reason  called: remember you worked at this one place where they had these bright green matches with, like, this silhouette of a horse on them
(immediately defensive) That was a long time ago
And all did was serve drinks
just need to know the name of the place
Charley's
And Ok,  admit, maybe did a little dancing, but how often do you make 200 an hour in tips
gotta go
want grandkids
Cass hangs up
She sits for a moment, staring at her phone
Is her mother right
Is she making a mistake right now
She looks around the bathroom
Candles, flowers, thick robes
bottle of champagne chilling by the heart-shaped tub
She slowly stands and checks herself out in the mirror, brushing back her hair with her hands
Suddenly, on impulse, she grabs the bottle of champagne and two glasses
,
83
They're here, maybe they should seize the moment
She peeks out the bathroom door and sees
& - ,    ,
(to himself) Sneaky bitch
- Cass is disappointed and vindicated all at once
She puts the champagne back
(to herself) Sneaky bastard
& - Milo hears the water go off
, tosses the purse away and lies on the bed, striking a casual pose
Cass emerges
Good shower
The best
Great
You know what's great
Trusting each other
agree
He holds up the handcuffs: Time for bed
: "Silent Night"
84
& - , ,      ,  , Suddenly, '
She sits up a little and glances over at ' She smiles
& - Cass is doing a slow, careful,    ' in an attempt to reach the gun without waking Milo up
She puts a hand on the headboard
She is lifting her knee over him, when he stirs
She freezes, waiting for him to settle
It's like playing Twister, only if the person you're playing with finds out, '
She manages to get herself  , arms stretched, , when: Excuse me
Cass
What are you doing
She looks down
Milo is watching her, wide awake
Hmm
This is going to be a tough one to explain
Um
Are you trying to seduce me
() Yes
Yes  am
She tries to reach for the gun while they talk
() didn't know you were still so attracted to me
mean,  remember how you used to like to greet me at the door in nothing but a
85
() Yes, it's true, 'm still attracted to you
Her hand is groping around blindly, where the fuck is it
She stretches more, bringing her face even closer to Milo's
Really
Wow
That's great news
You know what would be really sexy right now
Uh-oh
If we both just went to sleep
No
If you talked dirty to me
The gun seems to be getting father away Ok
(in a sexy voice) Sewage
Mold
Rotting carcass
No,  mean, tell me about your attraction to me
Um
can't stop thinking about you
Really
What part of me
Just
all of you
Be specific
Cass blushes fiercely
If she didn't want that gun so bad
() My great hair
My chest
Or
something lower like
He reaches down and  : 86
My gun
That's why she couldn't reach it She flips off him and back onto her side
Milo sits up, flipping on the lights
knew  couldn't trust you
knew  couldn't trust you
When were you gonna tell me about the matches you found back there in the hotel room
When were you gonna tell me you have no intention of helping me with my story
() You're right
'm not helping you
This is my story now
This time get to come out on top
Karma, babe
-a-r-m-a
Karma
Oh my god, would you get over it already
So  cracked the case before you did, it was 3 years ago, it happened, stop being such a baby and move on
Oh 'm moving on
You know how 'm moving on
By cracking this case before you, then taking you in so you can spend this Xmas in jail, all alone
He rolls over, turning his back to her
Cass stares at the ceiling, fuming
'- strip club on the boardwalk
87
'  - Jimmy, tied to a chair, watches nervously as '
So this is your place, huh
Nice
Cozy
Probably more fun to sit where you can actually see the dancers, but
Mahler has all the boxes loaded up
He grabs a rag and approaches Jimmy
Oh
Hey, listen, no need for that, swear 'll be as quiet as a mouse
Mahler gags him, know you will
Mahler grabs the dolly, flicks off the lights, and &  - : "2:00PM

No more Mr Nice Guy
She is scheming her way out

No,  do not keep my ex's photo in my wallet
Sid passes through, kids in tow, and carrying  , Sid looks like he wants to put a bullet through his brain
88
Teresa mouths "Milo"
Sid picks up the other extension
What's the problem now
No problem
She keeps their wedding photo in her wallet
He wants to know what that means
It means she's madly in love with you
Really
No, you idiot, it means she hasn't cleaned out her wallet in 3 years
'm pretty sure 'm still carrying around a condom from 1987
(to one of the kids) Son of a bitch, Jeremy, don't eat things you find on the floor
think it means she loves him
Really
Cause it did make me wonder
Why do you care
Listen to me: you hate this girl, remember
You drank yourself out of a job over this girl
quit my job
You were fired
quit by getting myself fired
Are you sleeping with her
89
Teresa, get off the line

Milo, do me a favor
Don't call me again until you get her to jail
Sid hangs up
Milo turns to see Cass (to himself) Shit
- Milo joins Cass
Re: Dawn: What was that about
Nothing
had her add mayo to your burger
remember you like that
Milo glances at Dawn and she nods in confirmation
Oh
(surprised) Thanks
Milo takes a bite from his burger and considers Cass
Ok, look:  know you're probably upset that you're not gonna get the story
But a person can't win every time, right
Depends on the person
Whadya mean
Well, if the person you're referring to is you,  agree: you can't win every time
Suddenly,
() What's wrong
90
(choking a little) This burger
One day stuff like that is gonna kill ya
(pause) Who knows
Maybe even today
My tug
is thwelling
(gasping) tink dere might be sesame
Yeah,  had her add that with the mayo
Is that bad
Oh wait, you're violently allergic to sesame
Whoops
My bad
' Cass calmly reaches across the table, taking his keys and unhandcuffing herself
Car keys in hand, she bends down to whisper in his ear: You know what that is
"Karma"
Oh, and, 'll get the story
Watch me
and heads for the door
(into her phone) 911
Yeah, there's a guy here about to go into anaphylactic shock
Better hurry

(listening) On the boardwalk
Great
Thanks
&  - Next to an ambulance, Milo is unconscious on a stretcher

Relax
That was an adrenaline shot
don't believe it
She tried to kill me
The  exchanges a look with the ambulance driver, then helps Milo off the stretcher
No one tried to kill you, buddy
You just need to be more careful about what you eat
Thanks
Great tip
He checks his watch, then pulls out the  : Know where this place is
Sure
Charley's, on the boardwalk
And just : when they say "don't touch" the dancers, they mean with with any part of your body, not just your hands
The  folds the stretcher, loads it into the ambulance, and , leaving Milo in the parking lot
(calling after them, ) Thanks for the ride, by the way
Milo starts trying handles of parked cars until he finds one that's open and
- Cass pulls up, parks in a lot, and instantly spots ' , squeezed between a burger place and a souvenir shop
She slips out of the car, takes a careful look around, then works her way towards the club
92
'- ,   ,
' -  ,
Seedy and cheesy at the same time
Cass thinks this over, then slowly lets the door swing closed
'- Cass finds the back entrance
She is looking for a window to climb into, when she spots ' '
Shit
Cass stares at the hat:
She presses her ear up against the back door: () Jimmy
Suddenly,
Or grunting
She looks around
There is a window higher up on the wall
Cass drags a trash can beneath the window, stacks another one on top of it, and cautiously climbs up
The window is locked and she can't see through it
Hmm
Fuck it
She takes her purse and  a pane of glass
She wobbles on trash cans and ,
'  - Jimmy is staring nervously up at the broken window
He can see hands and can hear someone cursing under their breath
The top of a head appears, then a face: '
Relieved, Jimmy starts gesturing excitedly for her to come in
Cass climbs in, drops to the floor, hurries over to Jimmy and ungags him
Untie me, quick, that psychopath is gonna be back here any second
'- Cass peeks out the door, then gestures for Jimmy to follow
93
- Cass and Jimmy are hurrying to the Cadillac
- Cass and Jimmy climb in
So what the hell is "Sparrow"
but before Jimmy can answer: (
) have a better question
Cass looks in the rearview mirror
: ,
Where the fuck is Milo
Jimmy almost bursts into tears
You know what
think 'll get a real job
Work at Kinko's
Or Burger King
That doesn't sound so bad anymore
() Hey
Who the fuck are you
Nobody
Right
So what the fuck are you doing in this car
Jimmy glances back at them
Do they mean he can just
(spelling it out) Run, you jackass
Jimmy gives Cass a quick look ("sorry"), then exits the car and
' She drops her forehead into the steering wheel in despair
94
- Milo is driving along in a stolen Volvo, cables hanging under the steering wheel from where he hot-wired it
He is just coming up on the boardwalk when his phone rings
() What do you want, you crazy bitch
'- Cass is seated in a booth with Dwight and Ray
Into phone: What kind of asshole runs up a gambling debt with a bunch of Neanderthals
That's not what  told you to say
Ray grabs the phone away from her
Into phone: As you can see: we have your girlfriend
() And 'm not his girlfriend
Oh, she's my girlfriend alright
But fair is fair: you guys can keep her
Ray stares at the phone
In disbelief: think he hung up
He what
(grabbing the phone) Gimme that
95
- Milo is pulling up
Sees Charley's
Then
He glances around:
His phone rings again
Hello, Lucky's Libations
-: Dwight tries to explain: Look, Milo,  don't think you understand: we're gonna hurt her
Milo hears    '
-
He heads for '
Into phone: Oh,  understand, alright, and don't blame ya
want to hurt her all the time
Cass grabs the phone from Dwight
Into phone: Milo, listen, they're not kidding, Ok
'- Milo slips inside and scans the room Into phone: Ok
Fine
Say you were wrong
Cass hesitates
Into phone: For what
For what
For poisoning me with sesame and almost killing me
Beat
96
Ok
Maybe that was not the best
Say you were wrong
could have found a more mature
Say you were wrong
was possibly out of line
Say you were wrong
(blurting out) Ok, ok,  was wrong
Ok
Now
Admit that the only reason you were able to crack that case three years ago was because you looked through my files
Long pause
What
think 'll hang up now
() Ok, Ok
looked through your files
Are you happy
Thrilled
Now tell them 'll be there in 20 minutes
Meanwhile, stop shifting in your seat like that and just tell them you have to use the bathroom
Cass sits up straighter
Wait a second, he's here
Don't look around
Just do it
He hangs up
97
-
You boys mind if  use the ladies room
- Cass enters
Milo is behind the door
He  the door closed after she is in, and blocks her escape
You know what my mistake was never should have let you out of the trunk
'm fine, by the way
The doctor said  may have been technically dead for a few seconds, but 'm fine now
Cass is not impressed
She stares at him coldly
So that's what you really think
That  stole information from you
It's not what  think, it's what know
How else did you beat me
(as though to a 5 yr old) Did it ever occur to you that just might be good at my job
Milo stares at her
Huh
It actually didn't occur to him
That's what  thought
You know what, Milo
You're an even bigger asshole than  previously suspected, and you deserve everything that's happened to you
(beat) And everything that's about to happen to you
"About to happen"
Milo is just starting to realize
You wouldn't

She is pulling away, victorious,

Then how is it that a statewide all-points was just put out on the two of you
() It's a long story
Ok, look, you guys better come to me, 'll protect you til we figure this out

He can just make out Pier 19 in the distance, a mile or two away

Yeah
19- Milo and Cass drive up in the Cadillac and park out of sight
They exit the car and look around
The pier seems to be deserted
Then they hear a soft motor, and Get in
- The sound of a motorboat chugging along
- Bobby is at the back of the boat, steering
Cass and Milo are up front, explaining: So, these guys have a bunch of stolen evidence stashed somewhere in Atlantic City
And we think they're ditching it tonight
Bobby steers the motorboat towards it , : ""

got mouths to feed

Aw
That's what all the dirty cops say
Bobby quickly frisks Cass, and frisks and disarms Milo
He steers the boat one-handed up next to the yacht and cuts the motorboats engine
Milo makes a sudden  for Bobby and , ,
Milo struggles back up to a seated position
You've always been such a stubborn asshole, Milo

You guys make a great couple
Bobby exits and Cass and Milo are alone
Suddenly,
What's so funny
My mom was worried  wouldn't have plans for Xmas Eve
104
Cass is laughing harder and harder until  : Hey, are you crying
() No
'm not
Milo doesn't know what to do
His hands are trapped in front of him, he can't even pat her on the shoulder
Ok, just don't
'm not crying
know you're not
just
(miserable)  can't believe  going to die by being blown up and sinking to the bottom of the ocean with someone who thinks 'm a total liar
We're not gonna die
Oh yeah
What's the plan
() Well
Milo looks around
There is a
Milo assumes a take-charge manner: Ok
Here's what we do
We're going to synchronize our efforts in order to cross the room and manipulate the bomb out of the room and into the water in order to diffuse the explosive impact
Beat
You mean we're going to throw the bomb out the window
105
Uh, yeah
Or we can just wait to get blown up
-  : "1:19, 1:18, 1:17

Go, team, go
That's the spirit
Ok, first we're going sideways: to the left
Milo leans one way, Cass leans the other:  '
Ok
My left this time
They both lean to the left and topple over
Milo is facing the direction of the bomb
Now we're gonna work our way over to the bomb
They start moving like a sideways inchworm, creeping along
And  don't think you're a total liar, but in my own defense,  was one of the top detectives in my division,  had been working that case for months, and then you just waltzed in and solved it
didn't just "waltz in"
You know had been working it for months, too
Isn't it possible that we're both good at our jobs, and  just happened to come out ahead
Beat
() Oh
Well,
(blurting out) Look, was confused,  had never been in love before
Well, neither had

Milo seems surprised to hear this
But before he can respond, ' : Ow
Shit
Dammit
They are stopped when ' Milo lets out a grunt
Beat
Milo
() 'm Ok
Ok, we need to turn to the right, and wait for the next wave
They both start turning separate ways: My right
They turn to the right and wait
After a moment: So
You were in love with me
Of course  was in love with you, why do you think  married you
No response
Behind her back, Milo looks sheepish
Cass : Oh
My
God
You think  married you so  could get info on the case

Milo looks confused
He is trying to figure out
She's a spy, Milo
Aaah

Everybody knows that
Mata Hari the spy

Milo clears his throat
Well
It might be a little late for this
But

Now we get up
Cass and Milo push against each other, and struggle up to a standing position
Great
So far, so good
108
Only,  ' Did you throw it
Not exactly
Well, what are you waiting for
'm waiting for a pig to fly in here and grab it
(starting to panic again) Milo
Ok, Ok
Um, on 3,  need you to jump

Silence
Think the water defused it
Lemme ask you this

Cass and Milo get drenched,
Nice job
Hey

- Bobby is paddling frantically, pausing every once in a while to curse the motor, He see the lights of another boat coming up behind him, and he paddles faster
- Milo steers the yacht right up behind Bobby, dwarfing the motorboat
Calling out: Hey, Bobby

Bobby looks up to see : What's the difference between a snowman and a snowwoman
(holding something up) The spark plug
Bobby checks the motor:  '   ' Milo and Cass grin down at Bobby while he kicks the motor and swears

" Cops are everywhere
Cass and Milo are seated on a bench, exhausted, watching as Bobby is cuffed in the back of a squad car
After a moment: Merry Xmas

Milo hands Cass some seaweed
You shouldn't have
Milo checks his watch
Hey

Looks like 'm gonna win that bet after all

Cass' eyes go wide
Suddenly, she   and
(to himself) You have got to be kidding me
- Like an action sequence in slo-mo, Cass stumbles across the sand, exhausted, Milo at her heels
Finally, he makes one last effort,  for her, brings her down and  on the cuffs
(muffled, face in the ) 'm not going without a fight
Yeah
'm getting that
He pulls her to her feet
- Milo leads Cass up to the clerk, both of them looking like a mess
He checks his watch: 9am
See
Easy as pie
(nudging Cass) Go on, say it

Stop talking

(a little disoriented) Oh
Ok
The clerk leads her into the jail
- Milo exits
He passes some cops on their way in
, Hey
It's that jerk-off bounty hunter
Milo stops in his tracks
Mentally weighs the pros and cons
: Ah, what the hell
He turns around, walks back to Gelman, - Cass is trying to find a clean place to sit down, when Oh my god, what happened
Hey
couldn't let you spend Xmas alone
Besides,  didn't really have any plans other than drinking some cheap whiskey and putting my fist through a wall
'm touched that you would give that up for me
Hey
It's the kind of guy  am
Cass grins
: (
) Well, you were right
