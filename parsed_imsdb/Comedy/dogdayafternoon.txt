/
'  -  - It is parked in a drab Brooklyn street
Beside the car stands , medium height, also good-looking in an intense boyish way
His eyes dart about suspiciously, the ever-watchful Sal
There is a watchful reserve in Sal that contrasts to Sonny's outgoing bounciness: first impression is Sonny is all bark; Sal is the bite
Sal is dressed in impressive blue suit style, he looks like a kid trying to impress the Godfather
He even wears a hat
Now, matching Sal's preparations inside the car, he checks his tie's alignment, shoots his cuffs and is ready
Meanwhile, on their car radio: (Amoreena) As he turns, from the back of the car,  appears with a huge florist box, tied with ribbon
Jackie is an eighteen year old with bad complexion and in contrast to Sonny and Sal is dressed in teenage sloppiness
Adidas, -shirt, bowling jacket, jeans
He is uncertain: waits for directions from Sonny
Sonny takes the florist box from him
We see a water truck drive down the street, followed by Sonny's car, which drives up near bank
It stops, Jackie gets out, crosses to bank window, peers through, then returns to car
Leans in, has fake conversation with Sonny
They are waiting
Sonny checks his watch, turns to Sal in back seat: 30 seconds, Sal
They wait
At appropriate moment, Sal exits car, walks toward bank
Slowly Sonny gets out
- slightly seedy little branch bank, old yellow brick, blond varnished wood, a rubber plant, an American flag
Through the windows we  , the aged black bank guard, in uniform, taking down the American flag from outside
Past him comes Sal carrying an attache case
He passes Howard coming toward us through the door into the bank
As he passes : : as it  from 2:57 to 2:58
as he moves toward the left-hand deposit-slips desks
He picks out a car-loan application slip, then walks toward the manager's desk (as the sign on the desk proclaims) of Sal sits down, his back to Mulvaney, facing the front door of the bank
Mulvaney is on the phone
as Sonny bustles through in his bouncy dancer's walk
He carries the large florist box
He moves toward the left- hand deposit-slips desks, takes one out and begins to fill one out
as he pulls out the keys, attached to the belt of his uniform
Jackie approaches the door of the bank and stops, neither in nor out, as though he can't make up his mind
Howard watches him, waiting patiently, keys in hand, folded flag under his arm
- still sitting, back to Mulvaney, watching Jackie's approach and entrance, ready to move on cue
on Howard as he looks at Jackie, still half in, half out
Howard speaks to him: Closing time; you want in or out
Jackie steps in and as Howard locks the door to prevent more customers from entering, Jackie walks toward Sonny, filling out a slip at the left-hand area
Jackie
He stops at deposit-slips desk, next to Sonny
- as if by pre-arranged signal, Sal now stands up, moves to the side of Mulvaney's desk
You the manager
who is still on the phone
He gestures at the sign on his desk that says so, and gestures for Sal to sit down
as he sits, producing as he does a machine pistol, which he holds on Mulvaney's chest, out of sight from others in the bank
His mouth simply stops, and he stares at the gun
Mulvaney is a comic opera Irishman in his early fifties, florid
cheerful, bushy eyebrows; he acts out everything he says
Just go on talking, like nothing was happening, okay
(into phone) Listen, lemme call you back
He hangs up, and looks from the gun up to Sal's blank hard face
To his own amazement, he grins: a hopeful grin that says: "Like me - don't hurt me
"  And he's embarrassed by it
As we watch, his smile turns sour
- Sal's absolutely unmoved face
- Jackie moves over to Sonny
Sonny, 'm gettin' real bad vibes
Jackie - what are you talking about
Maybe we can take something smaller
like a Spanish grocery
(indicating what's happening with Sal and Mulvaney) It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place
Jackie moves to another deposit-slips desk - takes one out and begins to fill it out
' as a  with a  in a stroller moves away from the Teller and starts to walk toward the front door
is marking figures on a piece of paper at 1st Teller's cage
and  stand behind her - their backs to Sonny
Howard, who has put the folded flag in a plastic bag in a front desk, follows Lady toward the door
He unlocks the door and hands the Baby a lollipop, courtesy of the bank, and she exits the bank
-   - glancing at clock, taking a sharp deep breath
staring at Mulvaney
the ruins of his smile still on his face
straightens up from locking the door; the figure of the Lady and the Baby can be seen receding outside
seeing that the bank is closed, locked in, with no customers, crosses toward the front teller's cage area, carrying the florist box
As he reaches the other side, he rips open the box and takes the rifle out and aims it level onto , the teller, who automatically takes the "closed" sign and holds it in front of her face as though to protect herself from the rifle
(holding sign in front of her face) Sorry, this window is shut
- as Mulvaney stands and yells to Sylvia
, as , an accountant, comes out of the ladies' room, starts to cross downstage toward her desk, sees what is happening, and momentarily freezes in her tracks
The cues have got all fucked up, but he's so programmed and ready, he can't adjust, so the speech he had ready comes out now: Okay, this is a stickup
Nobody move
This is a fucking stickup
Just freeze now, goddammit
Get away from your desk
get in the center - get in the center
Sylvia and Edna start to move toward the rear of the bank, toward Margaret's desk
aghast at his own outspokenness
Sal holding the gun levelled on him
Okay, okay
we know it's a stickup
(to Jackie, re: Howard) If he moves - blow his guts out
Cover him
-  & Jackie, staring at the real guns, turns to Sonny
'm sorry, Sonny
can't make it
Jackie starts to move toward the front door
Hey, for christ's sake
now
fuckin' asshole
(turns to Sal) He can't make it
Fuck him - let him out
Sonny yells out at frozen Howard
Hey
let him out
(yells) Do what the gentleman says, Howard
Sonny sees that Howard is useless, so he runs to Howard, grabbing the keys from him and pulls Howard along with him to the front door
Jackie unlocks the door, and Jackie, with a last apologetic glance, gives his gun to Sonny and vanishes into the sweltering afternoon
Sonny then frisks Howard and has a sudden afterthought as he locks the door again
He quickly unlocks it and shouts out at Jackie
- Hey, don't take the car
(on sidewalk) Well, how'll  get home
Take the subway
We need the car
(as Jackie starts to walk away) Hey, gimme the keys - the keys
Jackie stops, fumbles for keys, crosses back to Sonny with them
(points to fig
desk) Sonny, there's somebody under that desk over there
'm sorry
It's okay
it's okay
Sonny turns into the bank once more, as Jackie walks off toward the subway, pointing inside at a desk near the window as he does, to point something out to Sonny
- Sonny, re-entering the bank, speaks to Howard
Lock it
Sonny now crosses to desk that Jackie indicated, as everyone watches him, as though it's all in the game
(taps loudly on top of desk) Hey
get outta there
Nobody's gonna hurt you
, a young, frightened girl, peeks out from under the desk, obviously afraid to reveal herself
Sonny starts to move toward the front of the bank
Sal turns so he can cover everyone
Sonny turns to order Howard
Pull the drapes
Howard doesn't move
Pulla drapes
Howard belatedly leaps to work, pulling drapes that screen off the interior from outside
The door has no drapes or blinds and thus when the drapes are closed there is a corridor of space across the street we will always be able to see
And from which people outside will always be able to see in
As Howard finishes the task, he then walks back to the huddled group on the rear
on his way to the back of the bank, is digging into his jacket pocket; he swings around as he passes the camera that is bolted to a wall bracket covering the tellers' area
He whips out a spray can and gives the lens a shot of red paint
There are three cameras in all, each of which he sprays
(grinning) No replay, folks
no alarms
After spraying the three cameras, he has reached Mulvaney's desk area
The girls are scattering to group farther back and Sonny and Mulvaney are heading for the vault
(on cross to vault with Sonny) We're hip
let's just get you all fixed up and on your way
, a young, awkward, overweight Jewish girl, chewing gum with nervous machine-like rapidity, moving toward the vault
The gate is closed, and she holds one key and Mulvaney the other
They pass Sal, who now holds the others in the bank under his gun while at the vault gate
Okay, is the vault open
can take care of that
Mulvaney is about to insert his key in his lock
Sonny quickly reaches out and grabs Mulvaney's hand, and looks at the key he has extended
He explodes
Son of a bitch
He almost hits Mulvaney with his fist
What the fuck you tryin' to do
Trip the alarm
Use the spur key
Use the other one
He's grabbed the keys from Mulvaney and holds up the key Mulvaney was going to use
we're in a: -   ' Sonny holds the key right in the middle of the  where Mulvaney and the audience can  the key has a tiny projection or spur at the end
If this key is used, the spur triggers a silent alarm
must of been outta my mind
(furious) Well, you get your mind right
'm a Catholic and  don't wanna hurt nobody, but goddamn it, don't you play no games with me
Unnastand
Mulvaney nods and picks out a key that is identical except for the spur
He shows it to Sonny
Sonny nods
as Mulvaney carefully uses the safe key to unlock the gate
Miriam is crying as she unlocks her side
The gate swings open
Sonny shoves Mulvaney inside and, as he passes Miriam, notices her tears
She just stands there staring into his face like a hypnotized chicken, the tears streaming down her face
Sonny stops, staring at her
Mulvaney, starting to open the gate, moves inside the vault, impatient
Okay
Let's get you on your way
Miriam - open the safe
Miriam hesitates
What's the matter with you
(to Miriam) Come on, lemme load you up
There isn't any money
Sonny looks at Mulvaney, alarmed
They picked it up this afternoon
No money
(moves inside the vault) There's only about four thousand in singles, and maybe a few hundred in larger bills
he's going to kill us
Sonny storms into the vault
as Mulvaney pulls a cash drawer out to show Sonny: even we can see there isn't much there
Sonny searches for more, finds nothing
This is it
What am  gonna do with this
Holy shit
It's all we got
Okay, don't worry about it
Stick it in the bag
At this, Sonny pulls out a plastic bag from his pocket, hands it to Miriam, who opens it and puts the money into it
As he turns, we see that Miriam is still staring at him, terrified, and as his rifle swings around, she reels back with a little screech of terror
Ah, Jesus
Let's go, Sonny
(suddenly gentle) What are you crying for
Jesus Christ
It's not your fault there's no money
She's afraid you're gonna shoot
(hands Sonny the bag of money) Sonny starts out of the vault toward the teller's area with bag of money
He speaks to Mulvaney
What the hell would  shoot her for
Miriam follows Sonny to teller's cages gate
He carries the bag
(#1) Answer the phone
Mulvaney crosses to his desk, picks up the receiver
Sal follows him, yanks receiver from one ear to the other, so he can hear conversation
(to Miriam) Okay
open this
Miriam crosses to gate, presses the necessary button and the gate opens from them
Sonny watches this carefully, noting where the buzzer button is
He crosses in front of the drawer at the first cage
He tries to open the drawer
It's obviously locked
Okay, who's the head teller here
am
Open this up
Sylvia comes forward and unlocks the first drawer, and begins to remove the cash, but Sonny grabs her hands
alarmed
Don't take it all out
He grabs a piece of paper or cardboard
- ' He takes all the singles but one out of the singles slot in the drawer, leaving the bottom single in place
It is held there by a metal clip
He carefully slips the paper under the clip and then removes the single
It is clear this is an automatic alarm - meanwhile
Boy,  can't trust a one of you worked in a bank,  know the alarms, so don't try to fool around with me
as they move to 2nd cash drawer at 2nd teller's cage
Sylvia unlocks the drawer and starts to reach in for the cash, but Sonny pushes his hand into the drawer instead
He begins to stuff the money into the bag
Some fives, packaged with rubber bands, in the drawer, he holds up so Sal and all can see them
He laughs
Decoy money, right, it's marked
Shit
He throws it into the air so the bills flutter all around him, gaily
In the background, Mulvaney, having finished with the phone conversation, is moving to the rear with the rest of the girls
Sonny now moves to the 3rd cage's cash drawer
Mulvaney ends phone conversation and Sal moves him over to group at vault
(mimicking Sylvia) 'This window is shut
' Again, the same procedure begins
Sylvia unlocks the cash drawer and Sonny starts to scoop it out and put it into the opened plastic bag that Miriam holds
Cheer up, you'll be the veteran of a robbery, the bank sends you a dozen red roses, you know that
At this point,       (#2) (yelling to Sal) Sal, let him answer the goddamn phones, they're driving me crazy
Look at this chicken shit
Again, Mulvaney starts to cross back to his desk, again followed by Sal
Sonny yells out to Mulvaney as he crosses to answer the phone
Hey, you, manager
Don't get any ideas, fucker
See that man there
bark and he bites
Believe me, 'm on your side
My side, shit
They move to Drawer #4
Listen, we got young girls here
you could watch your language
speak what  feel
Hello
'm sorry  can't talk to you right now
suggest you call during banking hours tomorrow
What is your name
, Gimme the traveler's checks and the register
They cross toward the last drawer area (#5)
Miriam is still crying silently
Sonny holds out the plastic bag for the checks for her
She drops it
Please
quit that
It's not necessary
With everything in the bag, Sonny now takes the register and starts to move the two girls toward the rear near the vault
Can you hurry it up
as he moves toward the rear (Sylvia and Miriam now re-joining other women), to get a wastebasket
Accomplishing this, he starts to burn the pages of the register, tearing out pages as he does so
It's smokey as hell, but not burning well
He drops it, smoking, into the wastebasket
(to Howard) Hey, you
Give me the keys
We're gettin' outta here
(gasping for breath) Huh
Howard
Huh
The old man is panicked, great patches of sweat spreading around his armpits
He breathes in asthmatic gasps; now he flinches at his name, as though he's been hit
(stands, receiver still to ear, then covering it with his hand) Howard, give him the keys
Gimme the keys to get outta here
Howard is unable to move
Seeing his predicament, Edna moves to him and starts to unfasten his belt to remove the keys
Mulvaney continues with his phone conversation
who now crosses to Howard and Edna, losing patience with the situation
As he moves closer, Howard backs away from him, frightened by his rifle
Seeing that, Sonny puts it down and looks over to Sal for coverage
Sal
As Sonny approaches Howard, he realizes that he can't get close enough
Take it easy
just gimme the keys
'm not gonna hurt you
Listen, calm down, huh
You're gonna have a heart attack
Just gimme the keys
that's all  want
Howard gives him the keys and as Sonny starts to walk back toward the burning register
with Mulvaney still on the phone
(looking past camera, falling onto the floor behind Mulvaney) Sonny
who's that
Across the street
who now starts to move quickly toward the front of the bank, being sure to hide behind the posts as he moves
(
) (on phone) No, it was the credit rating
The credit rating
don't know, you'd have to find that out from him
Sonny has now reached the front of the bank
He carefully peeks out through the closed draperies to look outside
- ' man, in a business suit, sweaty and harassed-looking, is walking from an insurance office across the street directly toward the bank
The man continues coming straight toward them and us
Sonny starts to run back to get his gun from Margaret's desk
Mulvaney is still on the phone
It was something a couple of years ago in St
Louis,  don't know
Sonny grabs the gun from the desk top and moves over to Mulvaney
The man walks straight toward the glass door, already lifting his hand to shadow his eyes, so when he reaches the door, he'll be able to see inside
Sal brings the gun up so he can shoot the man, at the same time, crabbing himself aside so he is concealed behind Mulvaney and the desk
Mulvaney sees the approaching man and cups his hand over the phone
It's the insurance guy across the street
He probably saw the goddamn smoke
(motions toward smoking register) Please
Put out the fire
The last few feet from the door
who rushes through the teller's cages gate toward the register, grabs the smoking register, throws it onto the floor near Edna's desk, and starts to stamp it out
'll get some water
Before anyone can move, Sonny grabs the gun on them all
Nobody move
Freeze
The women now begin to scream as real hysteria sets in
Deborah screams, collapses
- : The man actually kicks the glass with his foot, then leans against the glass, shades his eyes, trying to see in
(
) Sorry
can't talk now
'll call you back
of hanging up
The man is looking all around
Get rid of him
Howard, wave him off
Tell him we're closed
Whatever
who is useless
who starts to move toward the front door, looking over at Sonny trying to put out the fire
; Sonny moves with him, covering him all the time
as Sonny stands behind closed venetian blinds to listen to the conversation and to cover Mulvaney
The gun's right on your back
Give me the keys
Sonny hands him the keys
- He raises the gun and sights it now, and in this moment, we should sense a kind of luxurious relaxation into anticipation on Sal's part
He is smiling a little, and for the first time, looks happy, and that's what makes him seem dangerous
He's looking forward to an excuse to kill
It's here now: survival
There is something almost sexual about the way he settles his body down behind the weapon, getting ready for the squeeze on the trigger, the report, the violent shove of recoil against his muscles and sinews
In the background, we see Sylvia bringing Howard a cup of water
emphasizing the small of Mulvaney's back
The man is somebody he knows from across the street
He looks worried and mystified
(unlocking door) What is it, Sam
Everything's all right
You okay
Yeah, just a cigarette got in a wastebasket
Silence
Sam stares around
thinking
You all right
Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all
Yeah
Well, you're okay
Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out
Okay
He's not satisfied, but he can't see anything and he can't think of anything more to say, so
Thanks again, Sam
'm glad it's okay
It's okay
[Regards to the family, Sam
] Mulvaney locks the door and walks inside the bank, giving the keys back to Sonny
For God's sake, will you please go now
We gave you every nickel we got
You're goin' outside with me
If there's no cops around, we just split
Otherwise, you go with us
Mulvaney and Sonny starts to walk back toward Sal
As they do, the      (#3)
(to Mulvaney) Answer it
Mulvaney shrugs helplessly
Picks up the phone, standing at desk opposite his
He's gone
Yeah - it's all right
let's go
Hello, Mulvaney here
-  & Sal, get 'em in the vault
Where's the money
Get 'em in the vault
As Sal starts to herd them into the vault (Sylvia helping Howard, still with the cup of water), Mulvaney is still on the phone
Sonny moves down to get the money bag atop the teller's cages and we hear Mulvaney on phone
(tired) What property is that, Mrs
Anterio
The Third Avenue property - you already got a second mortgage on
We discussed it before
The girls are afraid; Miriam unlocks the gate as Sonny uses Mulvaney's keys to the matching lock
(from inside vault area) You won't close the vault
How can we breathe
No, that's okay
just close the gate
Sylvia, helping Howard, is the last to go through the gate
As Sonny is about to lock the gate, she turns to him
Listen, 'll never make it
'll have to go to the toilet
What's the matter
they never housebroke you
It's not a joke
got this terrible fear of being locked in
Goddamn women
Ah shit
Okay
go ahead
Anybody else have to go
Me, too, please
You see
now they all gotta go
As Sylvia starts to move out, Sonny starts to cross ahead of her
Wait a minute -  want to check
Mulvaney finishes his phone conversation
He moves toward the group at the vault
as Sonny sprints for the door to the Ladies' Room
' It is a little lounge; sitting on a couch under the window, making up her face (or painting her toenails) and listening to her tiny transistor radio, oblivious to all that's happened, is , heavily-painted and voluptuous Latin girl
Sylvia, following him in, is shocked
She's forgotten about Maria
Now she runs over to her, puts her arms around her
Oh - Maria
Who the hell is that
God damn it
What the
Maria is about to protest, but Sylvia grabs her and starts to hustle her out
What are you trying to pull
forgot she's in here
Come on, nobody's going to the bathroom - come on
He moves with them back to the vault area, herds them into it
At this point,    (#4)
Sonny moves to get the empty wastebasket, shoving it into the vault for the girls to use in case of emergency
Mulvaney moves to his desk and phone
Mulvaney has by this time answered the phone, and is now holding it out to Sonny
(to Sonny) It's for you
They both stare at Mulvaney
Sonny slowly moves toward Mulvaney
For the first time since he entered the bank, he's quiet and slow
He takes the instrument and slowly puts it to his ear
The group from the vault now slowly starts to move out to listen to the conversation
(into phone) Yeah
(
) What are you doin' in there
Who's this
(
) This is Detective Sergeant Moretti, asshole, we got you completely by the balls
You don't believe me, 'm lookin' you right in the eye
Right now,  can see you
Who is it
Sonny turns and looks out through the door
Sure enough, in the window of the barbershop across the street, the dim figure of a man on a telephone can be  looking out toward us
He wears a hat in spite of the weather and a cigar is clamped in his mouth
He is an old-time, hard-nosed, uneducated, street-wise, sarcastic New York cop, outspoken, rude and sentimental
Right now he's a distant silhouette and a voice on the telephone
holding the phone
Listening to the voice of his death speaking in New York accents
(
) Okay
Let's be reasonable and not stupid and not get anybody hurt
You come to the front door with hands folded on your head, unnastand
Nobody's gonna shoot or
Sonny slowly, almost sadly, puts the telephone receiver back down, cutting off the little voice at the other end
He looks up at Mulvaney, then to Sal
(to Sal) It's the cops
Shit
How'd that happen
(backing away from Sonny) swear to God
on my salary, 'm not gonna be any hero
took too long
It was the fire, asshole
Sonny paces
told you, just go, get out when you could, but no, you just got to hang around
Sonny is pacing back and forth, trying to figure out what to do
Oh, shit
gotta have time to think
What is it
Did you just barge in here
He doesn't have plan
It's all a whim
(sarcastic) 'Rob a bank
What not
' Just give me time to think
(#5)
We're all in the barrel together
Phone continues to ring
Sonny finally grabs it (desk opposite Mulvaney)
(into phone) All right, bastards
You keep away from the bank or we start throwing bodies out the front door one at a time
You got that
startled apologetic man's voice speaks: Now (#6)
'  (
) just called to ask Jenny what time she's gonna get off
Who's this
(
) It's her husband
Sonny abruptly holds the phone out from his body at arm's length, disgusted
Is there a Jenny here
Nobody moves
They all stare at him
Finally he singles her out
It's your husband
Jenny starts to move toward Sonny
What do  say
Tell him the truth
Tell him whatever you tell him
(#6)
As he puts down the phone for her to pick up, Sonny reaches for the other phone that is
What a fuckin' comedy
(into phone) plays all the hits
(
) Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there
But you keep away from the bank or we start throwing bodies out the front door one at a time
You got it
Okay
He hangs up the phone
Sal looks at him
You mean that
What
The bodies out the door
want him to think that
But do you mean it
At this moment, Jenny, phone in hand, is turned to him, respectfully like a child in an authoritarian household, addressing her father: He wants to know what time you think you'll be through
stares at her
For the first time, he realizes how frightened she is, how serious, grotesque, and funny it all is
He takes the time to be tender with her, as though she were a not-too-bright child in the presence of a tragedy she'll never understand
Tell him  don't know
Now Sonny turns to speak to Mulvaney
Where's the back door
It's locked on the inside
(beat) It's through that passageway and to the right
Sonny disappears toward the back door
Jenny continues her phone conversation
(
) Jenny
He says he doesn't know
Why don't you cook whatever's there
(
) It looks like a whole roast
Honey, send out for Kentucky fried chicken
The baby, just open a bottle of prunes, and one of the beef
The bottles are in the fridge
(to Jenny) Hurry up
(
) know how to fix the bottle
They got guns
(with the baby on her mind) What guns
(
) The robbers in the bank
They got guns
Yeah
lot of guns
(
) Well, stay away from them
Don't get close
Oh, yeah,  will
Now Sonny returns from the rear door area, sees that she's still on the phone and signals to her to hurry up
Hey, Jenny - let's go
Hon
got to go
(
) love you
Jenny hesitates
Everyone is looking at her
They look away, as though to give her privacy
Yeah
Well,  got to go now
beat of silence
Realizes she can't talk
(
) 'll kiss the baby for you
(past embarrassment) love you
She hangs up and then crosses to the group by the vault
on Sonny as he moves to Sal, to reassure Sal out of some guiltiness about trapping him in this situation
His tone apologetic
almost tender
Sal, 'm sorry about this
But we can get outta this thing
There's a way outta this
Are you serious
About throwin' a body outta here if we have to
Well,  stalled him for a while
When it comes the time, then we'll work it out
Okay
But do you mean it
But you just told him that if worse comes to worse
want him to think that
But  want to know what you think
We won't have to
'll tell you right now - that 'm ready to do it
Now Sonny moves over to the group at the vault gate and speaks to them
What  want to say is
everything's gonna be all right
if we all cooperate and we don't, you know
carry on
don't know you and you don't know me
and what 'm tryin' to tell you is that if you stay cooled out, we can work this thing out and nobody's going to get hurt
believe me,  don't want to hurt anybody
Everybody is going to have a chance to do what they have to do
she's gotta go to the bathroom - so you go - and you can go after
Everybody's gonna get a chance
Everybody's gonna get a chance to use the phone
Let's just take it a step at a time
Sonny now turns toward Mulvaney
Howard lies down, head on jacket, in the vault
(to Mulvaney) Now, you -- what's your name
Mulvaney
You and me are checking the other ways in and out
Sal takes a position where he can cover the door and also the girls and Howard
as Sonny and Mulvaney move toward the rear of the bank
Let's go to the back door
(referring to Howard) How'd that guy get to be a guard
Well, they go to guard school
To what
learn how to shoot
They don't get a gun
They make $105 a week to start
They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning
don't know what they learn, Sonny
At some point in their move toward the rear door, Sylvia exits the Ladies' room and moves back toward the group
Here we are
the back door
They look at it
It is big, black, steel and seems solid
Sonny tests it
They could shoot the lock
want to block it, so if they try comin' here, we're gonna hear it
Here, you pull on that side
(puts gun aside) He has found a big office machine, a Xerox or whatever, which he now starts to push toward the door
On the opposite side, Mulvaney starts to pull it toward the door
It's very heavy and they have to strain to budge it at all
Meanwhile: You got kids
got two kids
and 'd like to see them again
Ah,  know
You're being very cooperative
got no complaint against you whatever; you got bank insurance
Mulvaney has removed his suit jacket
You know  do
You seem to know a lot about bank procedure
Sonny laughs and pushes the machine
Mulvaney pulls from the opposite side
Don't ask me questions
got connections
You find out who  am, you're cold meat
don't care who you are
(shove) just want to get you outta here, safe, right
What if  take you with me
(stopping to rest for a beat, thinking) If you take anybody, please take me
They'll shoot you; the fucking cops'll shoot you
they don't give a damn
In spite of that bank insurance
You see what they did in Attica, they shot everybody, the hostages, prisoners, cops, guards, forty-two people they killed, the innocent with the guilty
They have the machine almost to the door now, with Mulvaney almost pinned between the machine and the door
He eases himself out
Looks at the gun, then at Sonny, then they shove the machine against the door
Sonny then gives Mulvaney his jacket to put on again
Anyway, 'm not gonna take you
'm gonna take one of the girls, a married one with a couple of kids
The cops don't like it in the papers when they kill a mother, especially if she's got young kids
Finished with the task, Sonny takes his gun and with Mulvaney, they start to cross back toward Sal and the rest of the group
You're just a nice guy, Mr
Mulvaney
Only don't fuck around with me, you know what  mean
don't fool around with you
Mulvaney crosses back to his desk and sits down
At this point, all the phones are off the hooks
()
( ) As it banks steeply we can see past Pilot to bank, and cops around car
We see a small crowd being held back by a few police still setting up barricades
It is the first indication of the crowd event it became
It also sets the geography for us, but very quickly another copter swims into view and the two circle each other
The other copter -- only feet away -- is a  news helicopter, with a big camera sticking out the open door on our side
It is turned down by the Cameraman to focus on the bank in the police helicopter yells through his bullhorn at the  Cameraman
This is a restricted area
You are flying in a restricted area
The  Cameraman swivels his camera up to focus on the Cop, and as the lens hits us dead center
Though an open window a fire escape can be seen and beyond it an angle of street and the bank
Near the window in a corner is a  set, and on the  set we are seeing the shot of the police helicopter and the Cop yelling on the bullhorn as seen from the  copter
couple of Elderly Men are sitting watching the  set, ignoring the bank, which they can see in the flesh, as it were
Outside we are the copters, and on the  set likewise, and the voice of the Announcer
(
) police as yet have made no contact with the bank robbers who are locked in the bank
There is a  at the door, and the men at the  set barely have time to look around before several burly Cops wearing flak vests and helmets and carrying sniper rifles with telescopic slights move through the room, ignoring the men
They move out onto the fire escape, a couple going up higher, settling themselves down to aim in their rifles on the front of the bank
lot of   dialogue, but what we note is the Cops, as a man, take a look at themselves on the
- The  is full of cop faces
tough, mesomorphic faces with a layer of fat under the skin, increasing as age
They have the look of cops: alert, curious, weighing
They are city cops; they don't have that old-fashioned condemnatory expression, there is an element of playfulness in their nature -- the fact is they love their work, which is criminals
There is a peculiar delight in ferreting out the criminal impulse in everybody, and a matching fury in punishing it -- which is the action of repressing their own strongly developed criminal unconscious
These are tense, funny, violent, and rigidly controlled men
is an old-line cop, a lot more relaxed than the younger men and the cold professionals of the , who as a group resemble astronauts, and like them hide (but do not deny) the psychic chaos underneath
Right now they are looking at the sky
We  a heavy helicopter track
We feature , the silver-haired  Agent-in-Charge, who looks like an accountant, and Moretti, with hat and cigar, and a face out of Warner Brothers movies of the Forties
In spite of Sheldon's age, Moretti plays though he's a smart kid who still needs a little help
Sheldon is getting out of a gray car, wears a gray suit
Three men with him are carbon copies of him at younger ages
The three hang around him
They approach Moretti who looks at them without moving
(to no one) Here comes the
(to Sheldon) You men lookin' for protection
We got all the police right here
Why didn't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street
Moretti looks at him, cheerfully sarcastic
made an error in judgment thought the sons of bitches would be overwhelmed with remorse at the sight of a police officer
And you know somethin'
Nobody has said hostage yet
Unnastan
They are moving past Cops on the corner heading toward a small barbershop across the street from the bank
We now sense the growing crowd, standing quietly, just staring not yet knowing what's going on
From down the street come a group of odd-looking men in suits, carrying all kinds of electric junk: The
They run heavily, sweating martinis and cigarette smoke
they run up to Moretti and Sheldon, who walk along, trying not to catch an eye
-
How many in the bank
Have they got hostages
Any shots exchanged
(Etc
,  ) No, we don't know that yet
This young fella without the hat is
'm Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti ----double--
Eugene don't give a shit, but my wife cries if you spell it wrong
They have arrived at the barber shop where Moretti fights his way inside
- is talking on the wall phone as , , etc
are trying to get inside
no, just get hold of Al, tell him to get the catering truck over to 26th and Avenue , there's a bank robbery in progress and big crowd
Big
Tell him to bring ice cream -- got to hang up
He hangs up and immediately begins thumbing through a Throughout this Cop is engaged in personal business on the fringe of this affair, and though he's on duty he hardly knows what's happening on the robbery
He's trying to get his brother-in-law with the ice cream truck down here, etc
Moretti has got the crowd cleared back, so that now we why this has been chosen as a tactical command post
From here, while talking on the phone, Moretti can see the bank, and through the uncurtained door he can even see some distance inside
Moretti picks up the phone
(to phone cop) You get the phone company
It's being set up
this phone'll be a direct line into the bank
Moretti is already dialing
The phone is answered
- (Re Moretti's 3rd conversation on phone with Sonny
) The group inside the bank have now been waiting approximately twelve minutes since anything last happened
Sonny is seated at Mulvaney's desk, all the phones off the hooks
The rest of the group is huddled around the vault area where Sal is keeping his eye on them
Suddenly, Sonny jumps up and puts all the receivers back on the hooks, crossing back to sit at Mulvaney's desk again
and Sonny picks it up
Okay, you're in there and we're out here
What do we do now
told you -- keep away
don't know what we do now
Awright, but  wanna talk to you
First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay
They're okay
You alone, or you got confederates
'm not alone
How many you got in there
got Sal
Sal
What's that for
Salvatore
Sal
He's the killer
We're Vietnam veterans so killing don't mean anything to us, you understand
cop passing by presses a portable two-way radio into Moretti's hand: He accepts it and holds as though he expected it
The Cop passes the same type of set to certain other officers
These sets are tuned in to each other, and throughout the movie, there is a constant background talk on these sets
This is police procedure; the orders are for everyone to talk about everything
If anyone has a question, has heard a rumor or a sound, whatever, it is immediately responded to, so that there can be the fewest possible surprises
Sample dialogue might go: "Did  hear a shot
" "Over here, by the bank, there was a report like a gunshot, inside
"  "Roger, we heard that from the barbershop
it was inside the bank
"  "Barbershop, you can see inside
" "Roger, we heard from the barbershop
it was inside the bank
"  "Barbershop, you can see inside
"  "Roger, this is the barbershop, we see inside, the perpetrator is moving toward the rear of the bank
"  "Who's that guy walking through the barricade
"  "The blue suit
"  "Yeah
"  "Off-duty Inspector come down to see can you use him
"  Etc
They really do use the word Perpetrator, Felon, etc
The Cop handing out radios makes Moretti sign for it -- which Moretti does during the following: Right -- got ya
Okay, so there's you -- what's your name
What do you want to know that for
Give me a name, any name, just so got somethin' to call you
Call me Sonny-boy
Sonny-boy, one word
One word
You won't find it in the phone book
Listen, Sonny
can  call you Sonny for short
Call me whatever you want
Okay, Sonny,  want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what  want to do is work out a way to get them out of there
want to come over there, without a gun
and you can frisk me
So you can see you can trust me
So we can talk and find a way outta this mess
frisk you
You frisk me
Right -- 'm with you, buddy
'd like just some sign  can trust you too, Sonny
don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me
Some sight
right
Sure
like
'm not gonna shoot you
How about letting the people out of the bank
Why put them in this position
They're what's keeping me alive
You think you're dealing with an idiot
Talk to me then
Okay, give us the women
Oh, no
Women is all we got
You're all one way
'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin'
Give me one of them, anyway
Just one
So -- you want me to send one out there
Okay
'll see what  can do
Sonny hangs up and moves over to Sal
The rest of the group has been trying to make out what's being said at the other end of the conversation
(to Sal) He wants one
Dead or alive
Alive
Now Sonny looks at the group
Okay
who's gonna go first
Mulvaney now stands up at his desk, looks over at the group near the vault
They look back at him, waiting for some instructions
It's up to you ladies
Howard
They are now unified
Sonny whispers something to Sal
To show that we're negotiating
All right
send them the guard
All right
let's go
Sylvia takes Howard by the arms and starts to lead him toward the front door
Sal watches as they move toward front door
Cover her, Sonny
Sonny moves with them toward the front door, his gun aimed at them during the walk
Finally they arrive, and Howard moves toward the door by himself
But the door is obviously locked
He needs the keys
Sonny gives her the keys
(from the rear) Only one, Sonny
Sonny covers Sylvia as she moves to unlock the front door for Howard
Go along, Howard
As Howard is pushed out the door by Sylvia, a cop from a nearby car rushes up to him and shoves him to a curbside car where he bends Howard over the car, putting his hands behind him for handcuffs and starts to frisk him
'  - About 100 weapons ranging from machine guns to hand guns to sniper rifles are whipped up and pointed straight at his chest and head
The effect is as though he is about to be blown entirely away
Moretti rushes out, screaming to the cop with Howard
Don't fire
Did he say fire
What fire
Do we fire or what
Who fired
(Etc
) Confusion reigns
They don't know if the perpetrator or not, since they haven't yet seen Sal or Sonny
Guns  are up, aimed, being pushed down
Cops run for better vantage points
as Moretti reaches him
He pulls the cop away from him and starts to give him hell for the rough treatment being given the guard
With Sylvia in doorway, staring wildly at the street scene
Sonny is beside her covering her with his rifle
My God
That's Howard
We voted to send him out
as the cops slowly realize their mistake
They stand back from Howard, who is virtually catatonic with fear and shock now
They get him up, a reluctant to believe they could have made such a mistake
Near barber shop, across the street, jockeying, trying to focus in on him, elbowing each other, they yell out: Hey
Come out, get in the light
Hey, out where we can get a shot, huh
Who's the black guy
(etc
) -  (  ) swings in over street to try for a shot
Howard is being taken in the direction of the barber shop
to Cops
Get him outta here
Sonny back in the shadows with Sylvia, looking at Moretti, appalled
Behind him a mob scene
Howard is being led away, weeping
Photographers, cops, a phalanx of cops have their weapons levelled on Sonny like a firing squad
It is right on the edge of violence
of blowing up
Sonny and Sylvia are in the shelter of the doorway, Moretti stands on the sidewalk, looking toward Sonny inside the bank
Sonny - come out here a minute
At this point, he removes his jacket and drops it to the ground, showing Sonny that he is unarmed
You got these cops outta here
They're comin' in too close
Come on
want you to see something
You want me to give up, huh
Look, Sal's in back with the girls
Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them
Boom boom
How do  know you won't jump me
don't forget about Sal and the boom boom room
want you to see this
Sonny turns back to tell Sal he's going outside
Moretti stands well out in the street, to reassure Sonny nobody is going to try to jump him
Sonny stares around; he nudges Sylvia out ahead of him
As they edge into sight of the Media across the street: Out in the light
Hey, Lady
You're on , Lady
Smile, any
god damn thing
- straining against police lines: this is where we begin to sense the size of the event
People are eating popsicles and ice cream
They are diverted and excited
Sonny and Sylvia begin to emerge:  and  of greeting
- as he looks around, and the impact of his situation really hits him: he's not only totally surrounded, he's an event
Some of the crowd  him
An army of Cops, and guns all levelled on Sonny
Let Sal come out, take a look
What hope you got
Quit while you're ahead
All you got is attempted robbery
armed robbery
Well, armed, then
Nobody's been hurt
Release the hostages, nobody is gonna worry over kidnapping charges, the worst you're gonna get is five years -- you can be out in a year
Sonny stares at him, his face utterly blank
Kiss me
Moretti stops, stares back
What
(deadpan) When 'm bein' fucked,  like to be kissed a lot
(bursting out) Who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal
You're a city cop, where's the
This is a federal offense,  got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me
You know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me
Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me
Calm down, you're not
Calm down
look at this, look at him
Gestures at the cops, the wall of rifles and machine guns levelled on him
It is incredible and terrifying
(continuing) They wanna kill me so bad they can taste it
He takes a defiant step into the street
The crowd as they get their first view, which is of Sonny telling the Cops off
They don't need to hear the words, they can see it
(screaming) Attica
Attica
Go ahead
Blow off the front of the whole God damn bank
He holds his hands wide offering himself as a target to the hulking officer
(to the ) If it wasn't for you guys they'd kill everybody and say it was me and Sal
(to Moretti) You tell 'em to put the guns down
can't stand it
He means it
Moretti gestures to the officers to back away, lower the guns
The crowd : Sonny has beat the Cops
He is momentarily their hero
It's a breaking point
Moretti makes a decision
(Cop language command to put gun away) All right - put the guns down
He has to  it twice before the Cop slowly, angrily, stuffs the gun into his holster
: The crowd screams
hearing the Crowd
He turns and grins and waves to them
They  more
He turns and waves to the media
They've been
Hey, over here
Give us a wave
It is at this point that newsman leans out a window of the second floor of the bank, quickly lowering a mike boom
Sylvia sees this above her head
unhappy, looking around at Sheldon, who shrugs
He did what he had to do
Suddenly realizing what control he has, enjoying it
He turns mockingly his left and his right profile to cameras
runs heavily, stumbling, a delighted grin on her face, up the stairs  , yelling to someone unseen upstairs
Vi
Oh, Jesus
Vi
Turn on the , turn the  on, you can see it's him
'  - Small, jammed with little things of sentimental value and cheap furniture, clean, but well-worn
, a small woman in her fifties, with a perpetual smile, and the sweating Fat Woman trot in, just as Vi's , a dour man in his fifties, is exiting
swear to God it looked just like him
He hesitates in the doorway as the two women rush to the which is already on, the station showing live coverage of the bank robbery
On , Sonny can be seen ordering the cops around
Moretti looks furious
(as the recognizes Sonny) Oh, My God in Heaven
the robber, whose identity is not known, came out of the bank, with a hostage, Mrs
Sylvia Ball
(proud) Did  tell you
He looks good
What's he doin' this for
He didn't tell me he needed money
He would of told me
Mrs
Ball, is everyone all right in the bank
Why rob a bank when you got a sucker for a mother
Oh, yeah, the one girl was cryin', but we're havin' a ball, so far, if just nobody shoots
Why didn't he tell me
What about the man inside the bank
What is he doing
just hope he gives the wrong name
He reaches for  to turn it off
Vi stops him
Sal
He never talks, only goes: 'Sonny, you want me to shoot that one, this one
' Is that all there is -- that little bastard down there in the bank
Mrs
Ball, do you think they might shoot, if they get desperate
You got money for the subway
Hey, wait, he's goin' back in
(she turns ) Subway
It's a special occasion -- take a cab, for God's sake
Sonny returning toward bank
- - as they shake hands
As Sonny starts into the bank first, he holds the door open, waiting for Sylvia
In the meantime, the 2nd-floor media man yells down to her
(looking up toward them) gotta go now
(2ND ) Hey, lady
you're out now
Stay out
Sonny, waiting patiently, holds door open for her
They're my girls
They need me in there
And she walks through the door past Sonny and into the bank
Moretti yells up at the media to get the hell away and at the same time, turns to a nearby cop and gives orders for the air conditioning to be turned off inside the bank
As the crowd realizes what has happened, they  and At the door: as Sonny turns to grin and wave back at crowd
: - as Sonny and Sylvia walk into bank and head for the group at the rear
Mulvaney is seated at his desk, but the rest of the girls are standing around the vault area
Sylvia heads for the girls as Sonny walks toward Sal
Hey, girls --  was on television
(to passing Sonny) What about Howard
Sonny makes reassuring gesture to let him know Howard is safe
(to Mulvaney) Turn on the
Mulvaney turns on the  set
In the meantime, Sylvia has reached the other girls
What happened
And Sylvia begins to recount the events out on the street, mainly about herself as a television celebrity
as we see the image of a   across the street
Then, as his director , we will see on the  set an The  Cameraman  and the  image   through the door to show a partially-screened but quite clear image of Sonny, talking to Sal
(to Sal) The whole media is out there
it looks a lot better for us than it did before
absorbing this
'  (
) We can see the robbers inside the bank, and we're trying now to establish contact
'  (
) We're on the telephone to the bank manager, Patrick
Mulvaney
Mister Mulvaney
Mulvaney answers the phone
'  (
) Yes,  can hear you
serious, nodding to Sal
'  (
) Can you put the robber on the phone
Will he talk to us
'  (
) You wanna talk to him
Sonny
Sonny turns, trying to understand
What
The
they want to talk to you
He holds out the phone
Sonny walks over to him and takes the receiver
On the  screen, we can see him doing this
(into phone) Yeah
Who's this
Sir, you're on the air
wonder if you'd answer a few questions
(to Sal) Hey, Sal
(to phone) Sure
Why are you doing this
Doing what
Robbing a bank
don't know
It's where they got the money
mean, if you want to steal, you go to where they got the money, right
Jenny now edges over and sits on top of Edna's desk
But  mean, why do you need to steal
Couldn't you get a job
Get a job doing what
You gotta be a member of a union, no union card - no job
To join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card
What about, ah, non-union occupations
Like what
Bank teller
What do they get paid - (now looks over at girls who offer the information - $135
37) they pay one hundred thirty-five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start
got a wife and kids can't live on that -- You want to live on that
What do you make a week
(swiftly, evasive) 'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not
Wait a minute
'm talkin' to you
'm askin' you a question
The audience is interested in you, Sonny
not me
Yeah
We're hot entertainment, right
You got me and Sal on
we're entertainment you sell, right
You're news, Sonny
How much you have to pay an entertainer to fill this slot
Newsman, not
Okay, newsman
How much you make a week
(beat) You're not talkin'
You payin' me
What have you got for me
We're givin' you entertainment
what are you givin' us
What do you want us to give you
You want to be paid for
don't want to be paid
'm here with Sal and eight other people
and we're dyin'
They're gonna blow our guts out, man
You're gonna see our brains onna sidewalk
How's that for all you shut-ins and housewives to look at
You gonna help, or you just put it on instead of
We're dyin' here
What have you got for me
You could give up
Oh yeah
Give up
You ever been in prison
Of course not
Then talk about somethin' you fuckin' know about
At that instant, the  screen switches to a card and we hear an announcer's voice over: (
) Ladies and gentlemen, our transmission has been temporarily interrupted
Please stand by
Sonny hangs up the phone, looks at Mulvaney, puzzled at the outcome of the conversation
Why the hell did he do that
What the hell did  do
guess he didn't appreciate your use of language
They don't speak that way on television
It's a rule
Do you realize you've cut off a valuable source of communication
Sonny now moves over to Sal
Okay, Sal
what do we do
(no answer) figure maybe we can get the  to make a deal
What kind of a deal
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive
get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges
What do you mean
You talkin' about coppin a plea
(starts to speak, but Sal interrupts) because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, 'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal
'm never going back to prison
We got our own deal already
Do you remember the pact we made
You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar
we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do
Right
What did we say
What did we say
We'd kill ourselves
Does that still go
We're not there yet
Sonny now walks over to the ringing phone on Edna's desk
Jenny, sitting on top of the desk, thinks the call is from her husband, starts to reach for it but as she does, Sonny grabs it away from her
You're on the phone
1ST  (
) Kill them all
Now
It's a heavy adhesive voice that can be heard clearly throughout the bank
Kill them all now
You fuckin' creep
Don't call here again
Sonny slams down the receiver, looks around at the group
You see what we're dealing with
They want me to kill all of you
What now, Sonny
Wait a minute
've been looking at this all wrong
Let's look at it the other way
He crosses over to Sal
Look, we gotta get a jet outta here
outta the country
We gotta get a helicopter
Okay, Sal
We get a helicopter on the roof to take us to the jet and we fly to the sunny Caribbean
Algeria
We got to look at the bright side
We got 'em by the balls, we got the hostages, we can get anything we want
They gotta give it to us
Edna exits ladies room as Sonny crosses back to the phone, picks it up
(into phone) Get me Moretti
Now Sonny turns and speaks to the group
We're all gonna get outta here
You're all gonna be all right
'm gonna ask for a helicopter and a jet
and we're gonna get outta here alive
You've all been all right with me and as long as it stays that way, then things are gonna be all right - as long as you cooperate
(into phone) Moretti,  want to talk to you
'm comin' out
Sonny slams the phone down and walks over to Sal, rifle still in his hands
You realize, Sal, that we're gonna get outta the country, so if you wanna talk to somebody, do it now
You gotta Mother or a Father
Friends
(Sal nods no) If we gotta be outside the country, where do you wanna go
Any country
Just name a country
Wyoming
(stopped for a moment) Wyoming
That's not out of the country -- that's in the United States
Look, 'll be back
Sonny starts to walk toward the door
As he does, Sal calls back to him
Sonny
Gimme the gun
You don't need that
Sonny realizes what he's saying and crosses back to Sal and hands him the gun, then moves toward the front door
- Much as before
Sonny steps out
The guns start to come up
Put them down
The Cops lower their weapons
Moretti comes out on the sidewalk
He's eating an ice cream bar, and stands seemingly at ease, an island of calm control in a storm of passion about to be let loose
The Cops are always about to explode
Sonny, ya want somethin'
Sonny is about to open his mouth when a medium-size dark- haired Man who has been standing among people behind the barriers puts his head down and runs at astonishing speed right across the street towards Sonny
He catches everybody so by surprise he is already on Sonny before anyone can do more than start to yell at him to stop
Sonny, himself, can't believe it
He is slammed to the ground and the Man begins to punch him and beat him viciously
Cops charge in and with great difficulty pull him off
on the radio network;  Reporters and the crowd up and  for blood
as Moretti steps in
Sonny gets up, dazed
The Man goes on kicking and fighting Cops
Who the hell is that
Mulvaney stands in the door
(to Maria's boy friend) Hey
What the fuck you tryin' to do
You don't think the whole police department can do the job
' think he's got Maria in there, and see blood, man
wanta jam him up
Jesus, the Spanish
You gotta do it yourself, right
Eye for an eye
Go wan get outa here, we'll take care of her
(turns to Sonny) You okay, Sonny
Boy, he hung a couple good ones on you there
(from door; alarmed) Sal wants to see Sonny
He says he'll shoot unless he can see Sonny
He means Sal
Sonny, dazed and bleeding, reels to the door and calls in
Sal now stands alone behind 3rd pillar
It's okay, Sal
He turns back to face Moretti, Sylvia, Mulvaney
(continuing; hurt, wondering) He wanted to kill me
It's okay, you got a lot of protection
- Looking around, bewildered, the crowd is  and now it sounds unfriendly
He is really shaken up
He shakes himself -- stops that line and starts over in a business- like tone
want a helicopter to get outa here
And a jet to take us to
(cagey) wherever we want to go
Outa the country, so no little jets
big one with a bar and a piano lounge
don't know, Sonny
don't know if the helicopters can land in here
'll have to check it out
got superiors, unnerstan
They don't always see eye to eye with me
'll do what  can
Sonny looks him in the eye
Suddenly he makes kissing motions and sounds with his lips
We know what he's referring to: he thinks Moretti's trying to fuck him over
(continuing) Sonny, be reasonable
want to see my wife
want you to bring her down here
Okay, what do you give me
What do you want
The girl hostages
Nothin' doin'
give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet
(kiss) 'll see what they'll do
Sonny smiles and pantomimes kissing
Okay, you pick out who you're gonna give us
Where's your wife
- There's Heidi
Her body lies exactly as before, baking in the sun
The transistor  plays
she seems to be asleep
the leader of the pair, a Vietnam veteran, Sonny Abramowicz, has demanded in return for releasing one of the hostages that police allow his wife to visit him at the bank
Police spokesman
Heidi sits bolt upright, stares at the radio, which continues to blather on
Abruptly she begins to gather up her things, her children, in a characteristically scatter-brained and hyperactive sort of way
Heidi is a one woman panic:  she hustles away across the broiling sand carrying the radio wadded up in towels, and lugging a child, crying helplessly, by one elbow, as though it were a handle, a silhouette against the late afternoon sun, out of Fellini
meanwhile on the we are hearing her voice
It is a breathless, harsh childish voice that pours out the words in a torrent: (
) The transistor goes Sonny what couldn't believe my ears, so  shut the transistor, get outta here, who needs this
say Sonny didn't do it
It's not him to rob a bank
It's not him to hurt anybody, to threaten anybody, to steal or do anything wrong
'Cause he's never done nothin' wrong from the day know him
She is stumping off into the sunset as she says these words and we : - Out of a subway crowd, she struggles, pulling the two kids by the hand, a very ordinary woman in a most ordinary New York scene
(
) Only he tells me this and he tells me that, he's with the Mafia,  say, Sonny, where do you get the money, you're on welfare, how can you rent a new Eldorado, red, you don't like the color you rent a yellow
'   - working class block, dirty, shops in the first floor, three story walk-ups above
Heidi appears and runs up the stoop
get out of a squad car where they've been staked out and move up to her
They never really get in a word edgewise
They follow her into the hall
Now as we to her, we will  Heidi's mouth in  with the words
So night before last we're at Coney Island, he's on the rides with the kids, an'  have this habit of goin' in glove compartments an' all, an' see
- Heidi struggles up the stairs, dragging the kids -- the cops following
this gun with bullets in there, an' go to myself, oh God, Sonny
That's all  had to see,  didn't say anything
She's got her door unlocked
Below and on the stairs behind the Cops, curious neighbors peer in
'  - Chaos out of cut-rate furniture stores
Full of unwashed glasses, kids' clutter
Throughout, the children rush around unchecked
Neighbors enter without ceremony and listen
The Cops stand, trying vainly to communicate
As they enter
(continuing) And things are adding in my head, how crazy he's been acting, and in with a bad crowd, an'  look at him, he's yellin' at the kids like a madman
So inna car  said to him, Sonny, what you gonna do with the gun
You gonna shoot me and dump my body inna river or what
was so scared of him,  never been scared of Sonny never
You know, his mother says the cops was always at our house, we was always fighting
hit him with the jack in the car once, but only missed and hit myself, you should of seen my leg
And all he would ever do is put on his coat and go out
So they say it's Sonny but don't believe it
1 Lady, you saw him
You saw his gun
He might of done it, his body functions might of done it, but not he himself
-   -
5 The group is now situated like this: 1) '  - the  is on; seated in his chair, filing her nails is
Seated to her left, having pulled the chair a patron uses, is , watching  and listening to her transistor radio, against her left ear, at the same time
(at back water cooler - will eventually move back to his desk, sit down to Miriam's right
) 2)  - is now behind the Tellers' cages, straightening up the mess; she picks up the loose money that Sonny had scattered thru the air, puts them into packets and ties them with rubber bands
3)  - is seated in the rear Conference room, still holding his rifle, feet up on the table
4)  &  - at the rear water cooler (from which she will move to see what's wrong with Margaret) 5)  - seated at her desk, obviously ill, wiping her forehead, head bowed
6)  and  - at far right table, doing a crossword puzzle
7)  - pacing back and forth Mulvaney's desk, posing a legal puzzle for Maria
Sonny, his gun now lying across the top of Mulvaney's desk, is pacing back and forth between the desk areas
He's talking to Maria in particular, but anyone in earshot in general
Let's say  put a gun to your head and  tell you to kill a cop
and you did
Who'd go to the electric chair
you or me
You would
you told me to do it
But you shot him
(joining in) But you told her to
Yeah - But you did it
Deborah crosses to Margaret who is ill
Deborah goes to Sylvia - who returns with her her to Margaret
It should begin getting dark in through here
It is very hot and sweaty in the bank
: He is sweating, worried
He is listening to a conversation we can
as it goes on   to reveal the others in various postures of waiting
Sal more disheveled, Sonny's restlessness is unabated; he paces about like a caged animal
The voice on the phone is breathy and youthful: Sonny has been listening for a long time
(
) Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed
(gently) Yeah, well  don't blame him
(
) You know, Sonny,  used to dope a lot, and  was into dipping
And did a couple bank jobs, and the Lord Jesus in his everlasting mercy saved me, you know how
Sonny is desperate to get off the phone but doesn't dare risk the wrath of God by hanging up on this guy
He might have the secret after all
No
Look, we're kind of
(
) That's why  can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny
You got to merge your whole soul with God
And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost
Yeah, well
maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay
(
) Sonny
Don't send me away
can help you save your soul
Sonny hangs up
Deborah moves to Margaret, who is ill
She goes to tell Sylvia who immediately crosses to Margaret
& The air conditioning is off or something
(Looks at Margaret) she's sick
Sonny runs around, notices her - sees that air conditioner is off
Where's the air conditioning
don't know, Sonny
on the roof somewhere  guess
(improv
about going out back to find the air conditioning mechanism) Sonny moves toward Sal in the Conference room
Mulvaney follows discreetly behind him
Sal, 'm gonna take a look at the air conditioning
Sonny and Mulvaney start to move out toward the back door area
(to Mulvaney) Do you think we can turn it on
don't know
At this point, Sal calls out to Sonny, and gets up to move to him
Sonny - Yeah
never been up in a plane before
It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world
Safer than a car
Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right
they're great
And Sonny and Mulvaney exit toward rear of bank
-    -   (
5 ) Sonny and Mulvaney move toward the back door and stop under a trap door in the ceiling
Mulvaney looks up at it
It's gonna be up there
As Sonny is staring up at the trap door, thinking about what to do, he hears a tiny scratching
What's that
Sonny, tensing like an animal, peers around wildly to locate the source of the little scratching : like mice at a steel door
who quickly runs back toward the desk area
- ' Sonny races back in, grabs the gun from atop Mulvaney's desk, and with the cartridge in the other hand, runs back toward the back door again, jamming cartridge into rifle
At this point, Sal runs in from the Conference room, covering everyone point-blank again, yelling for Edna to join the rest of the group
(whispering) They're trying to come through the door
(to Edna) Everybody
Back here
Edna quickly obeys, moving quickly to the rest of the group
as Sonny races toward Mulvaney and back door with gun
Somebody or something is working on the other side of the door
as he moves back from the door, turns and levels the rifle on the back door
Sonny, if you shoot, shoot high
my car's parked out there
staring at the door
He hears the continued scratching noise and might even see the door knob move
Abruptly he swings the rifle up so the bullet going through will clearly go over the head of any man, out through the transom
He
- They all scream, some of them falling to the floor, huddling together in terror
- Sonny races back into main area where Sal covers group
(to group) Get over here
Get over here
-   - knot of half a dozen police are working at the door
Two were trying to work tubes under it to pump in gas, others were trying a nylon line to the doorknob, the idea being that if Sonny came out that way, the moment he began to open the door the cops would yank it open, exposing him completely and gun him down
The cops  as the  comes through the door, showering them with brick fragments
They scramble over cars, over each other, over fences, running into other cops, who also, not knowing what's happening, turn and flee, running into the crowd, which panics
on men, women, children, cops, detectives, dogs, cats, reporters, all in the area of the rear of the bank fleeing in waves over fences, cars, etc
flood of people like lemmings
This is  : 1)  fainting
2)  herds group into vault area
3)  dashing back and forth into rear bank area
Moretti, Sheldon, others come charging out, wondering what the hell, pulling guns out
The cops, safely distanced and back in cover, peek out at: It is okay
(
) What's happening
He shot through the door
Is he coming out
Can you see in
(Etc
, etc
) reaches out his hand for a bullhorn that is thrust into it immediately
(on bullhorn) Sonny
few louts in the crowd yell out in imitation: Sonny
Sonny
(echoing) Sonny
Moretti shrugs off his irritation and raises the bullhorn one more time: the crowd is ready and  in unison as Moretti says: & Sonny
You could hear it for a half a mile
Sonny starts to yell at Moretti
(inside bank) What the hell you doin' back there
Sonny, come on out
Sonny walks over to Sal, gives him the rifle
Sal, watch 'em
'm goin' out
as Sonny comes charging out
What the fuck do you want
They were
You tryin' to fuck me
No, 'm not tryin' to fuck you
So, what were they doin'
You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there
swear to God  had nothing to do with it
Bullshit
don't walk to talk to you
Wait a minute
everything you asked for is on the way
Yeah
Is on its way
The helicopter can't land but we got a bus
the jet's on its way to Kennedy
we got a bus coming here
You're full of shit
Sonny, your wife's on the way
We reached her
your wife's on the way
everything you asked for, you got
Well, what were you doin' back there
It can't happen again
'll do everything  can to stop anything can
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here
Can't land
you'd kill people
Don't fuck with me
'm not
'm not
you're gettin' a bus
you're gettin' a bus
the jet's comin' into Kennedy
and your wife's on the way
what else do you need
What else can  get you
Listen,  don't know how you can do better
see that man over there
the  guy
Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body
There won't be
there won't be
What else do you need
How else can we help you
All right
got some hungry people in there
want to get some pizza
some stuff like that
What else
Cokes, seven-ups
(Moretti repeats) also some aspirin
Aspirins
okay you got it
(turns behind him to a near-by cop) Charlie
Six pizzas
Okay
Sonny turns and walks back into the bank
- as Sonny enters and walks toward Sal
Okay
okay
all right, Sal, it's okay
got everything straightened out
it's gonna be okay
Get over there
Look,  talked to him and it's not going to be a helicopter - they can't land on top of the roof - so they're comin' with a big
limousine bus and they'll take us to the airport - and they're gonna get a jet
so things are rollin'
They're movin'
also ordered some food
got some pizzas for us, all right
got some things to drink -  got sodas
even asked them for aspirins
'm doin' what  can
now  gotta pay for the pizza
where are the marked bills
He now walks behind Tellers' cages and picks up some of the decoy money that Edna had started to clean up and re-stack
Mulvaney walks over to him
Are we going to get the ball rolling
What are you talking about
What do you think 'm doin'
'm gettin' the ball rollin'
'm keeping these people happy
'm keeping you happy
gotta keep the cops cooled out
gotta do everything gotta pay for the pizza
'm workin' on it, do you know what  mean
'm workin' on it
Jesus Christ gotta do it all
got all the ideas
you want me to give you the gun
You want to take it over
Sonny walks to the front door with the money
- as Sonny appears in it
guarded by a couple of cops
You the guy wanted the pizza
Sonny grabs bills from the wad he holds and thrusts them at him
It's paid for
(looks at Moretti; Moretti nods) Keep the change
As the cops reach for the money, knowing it's bank money, people in the crowd yell: Hey, over here
Hey, robber
How about a thousand
Throw some over here
Hey, no shit,  need an operation,  don't even have a job
(Etc
) Sonny holds up the money
The crowd cheers
He throws the wad of bills and it scatters in the air
The  is blowing now
Even some cops join the ensuing melee to gather it up
as cops move forward and try to catch the bills
Some blow into the crowd
Fights break out in the crowd as they scramble for the money
The crowd breaks the barriers and swarms after the cash
Cops try to retrieve bills; fist fights, arrests
staring at the mess
Sonny also watching the people
There is in both of them the same reaction of faint disgust at the greed unleashed
Sonny angrily hurls another bundle after the first
then laughs as he watches the people fighting
Moretti nods ironically at him
Sonny turns and enters the bank with the food
The fighting goes on in the street
- as Sonny enters carrying food
Okay - Chow
He puts it down in front of Mulvaney, on Mulvaney's desk
Mulvaney looks at it, sickly
As Mulvaney looks up at Sonny: You eat it first
don't know if they put something in it
- Moretti, Sheldon, other top cops march fast-time toward the barrier where uniformed cops stand around a limousine that has drawn up to the barrier
It is full of white-haired officials, one of them the
He has a voice broken by whiskey, cigars, good food and yelling at football games
It looks like they may be going into action
Moretti's attitude is not that subtly different now he's talking to brass
Commissioner doesn't get out; he talks through window
The Commissioner's hand, pudgy and freckled with age, covers Moretti's where it rests on the door: he massages Moretti's hand fondly
Gene -- you smilin'
No
never smile any more
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene
never make bets or guesses, that way 'm never wrong and  never have to pay out
Gene, Jesus, what a bull he is
lot of comfortable  inside the limo
The Commissioner's hand lingers on Moretti's -- they are fond of each other, these men, linked in a relationship of a lifetime of shared experience, of attitudes, of maleness -- an accumulation of years of jokes about being late for dinner, of women waiting and women panting with desire, men secure in the bastion of their roles
What is being passed on here is a purely emotional force of approval and acceptance from top to bottom of a social institution that is the last totally masculine society: police
The homosexual content of this should not be lost: it lies in the comfortable fit of their feelings, in the fact, simply, that they love each other, for what they share
So whatsa deal
They jet's comin' out
But don't let 'em off the ground
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people
Don't let 'em off the ground
Listen
He leans down to get close to his commissioner, because he's not fooled by the camaraderie into a false sense of security
- (anticipating) If you're right 'm gonna back you a hundred percent, you know that
(pleasantly) Fuck you, sir - if 'm right, don't need you
What  want is - if  make an honest mistake  want help
The Commissioner nods - presses a button and the window goes up to keep the air conditioning in and the heat out
-   -
5  - as we hear Jenny on the phone with her husband
Sonny is doing the manual of arms with his rifle
well, just pick him up and hold him
No, he's not spoiled, he's just got to settle his stomach after eating
He's used to me feeding me, that's all
At one point, Sonny starts to show Miriam how to hold the gun and in mock seriousness, she tries to do the manual of arms
where Sal is seated at the Conference table, rifle on the table
Edna and Sylvia are also seated there
Maria enters
Somebody give me a cigarette
Maria walks over to her, offering her one, then remembers: Sylvia, you don't smoke
never smoked before in my life but got a right to start now if  want to
You don't smoke
why do you want to start now
Because 'm scared, that's why
You never smoked
used to, but  stopped
You stopped
Why
Because  don't want cancer
You don't want cancer
You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer
(to Maria) Gimme the cigarette
Maria starts to hand one to her
No
'm not kidding
Don't you understand
You're pure
Pure
You shouldn't start now
For God's sake
As soon as 'm outta this bank robbery, 'm gonna stop
okay
Go ahead
Do what you want to do
hate to see you break a perfect record
You oughta take care of your body
My body
What for
Your body is the temple of the Lord
(staring at him) You're serious
You're really pure, you know
You got a perfect record
You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now
You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground
God forbid should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house
You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it
You gonna smoke the cigarette
Yes
Sal gets up and starts to leave the room
(calling to him) Sal
If  die of cancer it's going to be half your fault
Sylvia grabs the cigarette from Maria
(exiting) No - it's because you're weak
Sonny continues with "Manual of Arms" business with rifle
Mulvaney is on the phone
(overlapping Janet into phone) Mulvaney
(listens) (into phone) don't know
(to Sonny) It's for you
Moretti
Sonny takes the phone
Yeah
We're bringing in your wife
He comes alert, looks around at Sal, nods, and starts for the door of the bank, turns to Sal
(gives him gun) They've got my wife
They're bringing her in
He exits bank
Sal walks toward the door, stops behind the first post
- The fire escape with the old lady and her jigsaw puzzle, the flak vested snipers, etc
Below in the street a police car plows through the crowd with red lights flashing but no sirens -- or perhaps just a low growl to help move the human sea aside
People are leaning over trying to see inside
Moretti and Sheldon and staff move out into the street
The cop car is moving through police lines, cops lifting barricades aside to let it pass
with Moretti and others as they move to intercept the police car where it will stop on the corner
As they stop, we can see Sonny step into the door of the bank, in the distance
He is greeted with  from the crowd
But is intent on the car
We are     ,  ' and Sonny
The  of the police car gets out, with a huge grin on his face and nods to Moretti
The back door opens and another cop gets out, also grinning
They look around toward Sonny, as his wife gets out of the police car, on this side
She is spectacularly good looking in a lithe cruel sort of way, like Lauren Bacall, but right now she is a mess
: as Sonny sees Leon get out of the car
Leon
Leon
Over here
Happy Birthday, Leon
who doesn't hear Sonny calling, the detectives and Moretti start to take him to the barbershop
(to cop driver) What's that
We went to the hospital, where he told us - and asked for his wife
He
(indicates Leon) says they got married in a church
Jesus
They continue along the sidewalk
Leon, coming to, starts to look around him
He sees Sonny
as he yells again to Leon
Leon
Happy Birthday
who faints
The crowd yelling in increasing waves of ; Moretti and cops pick up Leon and rush him toward the barbershop
who dashes toward the bank door, enters
- as Sonny comes running in
Sylvia is now showing off her new-found expertise with a cigarette to Miriam, Jenny and Deborah, seated around Edna's desk
(Deborah is talking on the phone
)  Meanwhile, Edna is back in the Conference Room with Mulvaney; Margaret is seated at her desk, speaking on the phone; Maria, speaking on phone, is seated at Mulvaney's desk - where television is still on
Sonny, wanting to use a phone, realizes that all are in use, rushes to a desk at the front of the bank
Sal follows him there
Sonny grabs a phone
(into phone) Get me Moretti
where Moretti and cops are trying to revive Leon
cop at the phone turns to Moretti
Moretti - he wants to talk to you
Moretti walks over to phone, takes receiver from cop
Sonny waiting for Moretti to answer phone
Is he all right
Is he all right
(
) He's all doped up
want to talk to him
(
) He's groggy, Sonny
Let me get him on his feet and he'll call you back
(hangs up) as Moretti hangs up phone and walks over to Leon, who now has a glass of water and a cold towel
Leon
Whatsa matter
They give you a shot down the hospital or what
Oh, God, they shot me with like unreal
Well, you got to get hold of yourself
You got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up
Oh no
He's got eight people in there with him
He's got this kid with him
they're gonna shoot the people
can't help it
can't stop him from anything
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to
He won't listen to anybody
He's been very crazy all summer
Since June he's been trying to kill me
You try calling the police
What good is that
They couldn't stop him
And it'd just make him mad
They don't know him
Somebody's got to stop him, Leon
He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person
He's makin' threats in there
He's scared
It's crazy
never met anyone like him
His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children
His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent
Unbelievable
wanted to get married
He didn't really want it
he's married already
But he did it
don't know why
thought it would help me, but it didn't
was just as confused and unhappy was before; did terrible things
What kind of things, Leon
Ten days  spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew  was drinking; he didn't know where was
who  was with
couldn't explain why  did the things  did
So  went to this psychiatrist who explained to me  was a woman in a man's body
So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that
2500 dollars
My God, he's in hock up to his ears already
He needed money
For the operation for you
It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages
And  got more depressed than ever;  saw 'd never get the operation
So  tried to take my life -  swallowed about a half pound of pills
blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers
you name it
But just threw them up and wound up in the hospital
Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow
' So when  hear he's in the bank, almost go crazy because  know he's doin' it for me
Well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there
can't talk to him
You're in it up to your ass, Leon
You're an accessory
You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case
'm afraid
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone
don't know what to say to him can't
You think it over, Leon
Moretti walks over to the wall phone, picks up the receiver, and waits to be connected with the bank and Sonny
Terrified
He really can't do it
waiting
- as the phone rings
Sonny picks it up, hears Moretti's voice
(
) He won't talk to you
Let me work on it
Sonny hangs up
He and Sal walk toward the group at the rear, around the desks
as we see  newsman speaking
police are questioning Leon, a year-old admitted homosexual, who claims to have been married to one of the bank robbers in a ceremony last November
[etc
]
During the speech, Sylvia and her group wander toward Mulvaney's desk to listen, as Edna wanders down from the Conference Room, crosses to the set and turns up the volume
pacing back and forth
They all stare at him
Slowly the group shifts to other positions, without a word being said
Our coverage of the Brooklyn robbery where two homosexuals are holding hostages for their demands of a helicopter, a jet, and safe passage out of the country
Sonny, you hear that
What
They keep sayin' two homosexuals
'm not a homosexual
want you to stop them saying that
That's all they're interested in - it's a freak show to them
can't control it, Sal - let'em say what they want
Forget it
It don't matter
Where's the god-damn jet
They're always flying overhead - going somewhere
- snipers area at positions, waiting
small group of men make a last check
signal is given
They get in their car and drive away
An  sniper lights a cigarette and settles down to wait, moving his rifle to a comfortable position
- The old lady dozes over her puzzle
The police agents are being relieved
Light floods the front of the bank
-  (
8
) Sonny paces back and forth (with ad-lib dialogue to group)
Margaret, seated at her desk, has feet up on another chair while Jenny sits on top of her desk
Mulvaney is back at water cooler, starting to feel very ill
Miriam and Deborah are seated at Mulvaney's desk
Edna is seated at her desk, while Sylvia sits on top of desk, talking on phone
Suddenly, the lights go out, leaving only emergency lights on (4 in the main area and 2 at back door area)
Sylvia immediately moves over toward the vault area and turns on 2 hand lamps
That's it, Sonny
Both rush toward the front of the bank
They see that even the flood lights are now out, but across the street can still be seen lights in the store windows
Sonny rushes to a near- by phone to try to reach Moretti, but even the phones are dead
They hear Moretti's voice over a bull-horn outside: (
) Sonny
Sonny
Come out a minute
Come out a minute
Sonny moves toward the front door
- / Moretti and Sheldon are in the barbershop
We're all set at Kennedy
What makes you think you'll be able to control it
He's totally unstable
He'll make a mistake
He hasn't so far
'm the one who can make a mistake
That's what scares the shit out of me
Eugene, at 3:07, this became Federal
Why don't  take it over now
: - as the door opens and Sonny peeks out, the once-illuminating floodlights now out
Moretti
What the fuck is goin' on
There's no answer
Sonny steps out into the street
He can't see anything anymore
The atmosphere is suddenly chillingly dangerous: the crowd  "come out of the dark" and "we can't see from here"
The street seems empty except for a few threatening silhouettes of heavily-armed cops
Sonny responds with bluster
Get the lights back on
He steps out farther into the street
From behind him, , the  man, approaches
He is alone
Unsmiling
Sonny dashes back into the bank
- as Sonny rushes in, warns Sal about the  confrontation he's about to have
Sal - it's the
'm goin' back out to talk to him
At this, he walks back toward the door and exits the bank again
- Sheldon is walking toward Sonny as the latter exits the bank
What is this
The
Jesus, now we're talkin', maybe we can get this thing moving
As Sheldon reaches him
First off, get the lights back on and the air conditioning
(showing ) No more favors
That's all over, Sonny
(sarcastically) Aw, Jesus
you been doin' us favors all night
've got a jet
'll have airport limousine here in a half hour want the hostages
Bullshit
'd like to work with you on this, not against you
Sonny comes around, looking for Moretti: can't see him
Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive
Okay, when do  get them
At the airport
We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out
Except one
want them all
want to talk to Leon
Pause, while Sheldon thinks this over
want to come in, and see if everybody's okay
You got guts
You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out
have to see
Sonny re-enters bank
- Sonny goes over to Sal
It's the
He wants to come in
Have him walk in backwards
Sonny exits bank
- Sonny crosses to Sheldon, grins, grabs him and executes a very professional-looking pat-down search
He removes Sheldon's
38 from a shoulder holster, producing it for the crowd with a flourish like a magician: some of the old playfulness returns for a moment
He carefully and with showbiz flourishes searches Sheldon's thighs and groin
The crowd
Sheldon bears it with stoic calm
as Sonny stands up from the search and finds Sheldon's eyes locked to his with flat calm
Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too
wouldn't like to, but  will, if have to
Nothin' personal, huh
The man that kills me,  want him to do it because he hates my guts
Not because it's a job
Okay, let's go
but you gotta walk in backwards
The move toward the door of the bank, where Sonny opens the door, preceding Sheldon, both men entering backwards
- Except for the 4 emergency lights, it is very dark - and very hot as Sonny and Sheldon enter the bank
Sal now stands behind the desks, covering Sheldon and the group assembled at the vault
Sheldon takes in every detail as he walks toward the group in the rear, followed closely and covered by Sonny
As they near the desks, Sonny yells out an order for the group: Nobody give their right name
it's the
just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here
- She's pissed
Listen, we asked for the jet hours ago, what are you doin' out there
Sheldon is watching Sal, trying to gauge him
This is the first time anyone from outside has seen Sal
(his eyes on Sal) It's all being set up, we'll have you out of here in a couple of hours
(to Sheldon) Just give them what they want
Sheldon now walks closer to group, looking into the two small examining rooms as he moves
Sonny covers him every inch of the way
They're getting what they want
We just want to be sure we get what we want, which is to get all you ladies out safe
And you two boys, too
Sheldon is now standing very close to Sal
(to Sheldon) You got to talk to the , tell them to stop talking about the two homosexuals
'm not gay
that's the truth
Tell 'em that
will
(he turns to Sonny) Sonny
Outside for a minute
Sal
They gotta stop sayin' that
- as they (Sheldon and Sonny) exit and stand in the doorway out of earshot of the others
Sheldon is matter-of-fact, but insinuating and conspiratorial
Sonny, you handled yourself real well
lot of men would have choked, and we'd have a lot of chaos and panic and maybe a death or a multiple death on our hands, but you handled it
respect that
Don't you try to take Sal
We'll handle him
You just sit tight and you won't get hurt
He starts to go
Sonny grabs him
Wait a minute
What the fuck you tryin' to tell me
(quiet) What  said
You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal
And he turns and starts to walk away, leaving Sonny staring after him
- as Sheldon steps into the door
The place is jammed, Moretti stands inside the door where Sonny could not have possibly seen him
Sheldon quietly turns and stands beside him, both men looking back across the street
The little bastard miss me
Sheldon smiles the supercilious Ehrlichman smile of his
- as Sonny re-enters
He's restless, hyperactive, constantly moving during this scene; a man with a potentially guilty conscience
Sal moves toward him and both men walk to area in front of the Tellers' cages
What'd he say
He was talkin' about arrangements
we were talkin' about the
Why couldn't he talk about that here
He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal
(notices Mulvaney start to faint) What's wrong with him
In the rear, Mulvaney slumps into a chair beside Margaret's desk
Sylvia rushes to help him, untying his tie, etc
Maria runs into the Conference room, hoping to find remains of sugar as Deborah crosses to his desk, looking through the drawers for medication
Jenny simply can't cope with it and walks away
Hey, you okay
He's got diabetes
He's not a well person
Those bastards -- they poisoned the pizza
Sal - you didn't eat any pizza
didn't eat any pizza
told you, he's got diabetes
You're supposed to balance your sugar diet, right
Sonny starts to move toward the front door
- Sonny rushes outside
Hey
Is there a doctor over there
Get him over here
Come on, on the double
Sheldon and a young  appear, concerned
What's wrong
The manager, he's diabetic, he's lookin' bad
Sheldon turns, calls out
Doctor
man comes forward - is frisked by Sonny, who then dumps contents of his Black Bag and looks for weapons
Sonny then dashes inside bank
- as Sonny comes in, walks over to Sal
Sal - the Doctor's coming in
Sonny then rushes back outside bank again
- Sonny crosses to Doctor
(to Doctor) You go on in
The Doctor hustles past
on Sheldon
(picks up the phone) 've convinced Leon to talk to you
He's on the phone now
Sonny rushes back into Bank
Sonny rushes in
The phone rings
He picks it up
Hello
Hello, Leon
Hello, Sonny
How are you doing
Well

(pleased) Yeah
You said
thought you were never getting out
never thought 'd get out this way

Ooohh
Oh

'm really shakey
Well, you know
Moretti told me before that you were drugged up
Yeah
It was terrible
That

You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy
And they start putting things in your arm
you know
How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time
Yeah
You can't talk or do anything
You really feel

(pensive) So

Yeah
So how are you
(chuckling) Fine, thank you

That is

(chuckling) Yeah

Boy
'm dying
What
What are you talking about
You are dying
Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that
What are you talking about
What do you mean
what am  talking about
Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life
am dying
Do you know
do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you
Now don't give me that deep shit now
Don't start with that shit
No really
don't think that you realize what it means
The things that you do, Sonny
You put a gun to somebody's head
don't know what 'm doing
(annoyed) Yeah
obviously you don't
when you put a gun to somebody's head
and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when  pull the trigger
Death
Don't talk about death to me
have been living with death for the last six months
Why do you think 'm in the hospital
take a handful of pills to get away from you
And then here  am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone
again
have no friends left
No job
can't live have to live with people
This death business
'm sorry
'm not on the phone to talk to you about that
Well,  don't know what to say, Leon
When you gimme that
when you hit me with that shit mean, what am  supposed to say
(indifferent to Sonny) 'm sorry
told you
That  got a lot of pressures
You said to me that you needed money, and  knew that you needed money
saw you there lying in the hospital like that
and said
shit, man,  got to get this guy some money
(excited) But  didn't ask you to go rob a bank
(getting louder) All right
know you didn't ask me
You didn't ask me but  did it
Well
did it on my own
did this all on my own
ain't laying it on anybody
Nothing on anybody
'll tell you something, though, it's about time that  squared away my accounts
you know
am squaring away my accounts with life
Maybe this whole thing is gonna end, somehow
Maybe it'll just end
Maybe 'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over
That would be all right too said
thought  would square it away with you
you know
That would get you down here and that would say so long to you
or, if you wanted
you know, to take a trip
What trip
'm getting out of here, man
'm not going to stay here and 'm not giving up
mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway
So fuck it
But, if  can get out of this
am going to get out
And, how 'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and 'm flying the fuck out
That's all, Leon
If you want to come with me, then you're entitled
you can come
You're free to do what you want
'm free to do what  want
And you think  would want to go with you some place on a plane
Where

(pleased) like that
yeah
Sal wanted to go to Wyoming
told him it wasn't a country
We gotta get outta the country
To hell with a guy who doesn't know where Wyoming is
Okay
Can you imagine what kind of a shape 'm in
Laughter from both Sonny and Leon
So
Sal is with you
Sal
Yeah
Sal is with me
Oh
wow

(making fun of Sonny) Sal
Sal
Naturale, oh boy

And if  go out he's just gonna kill the people
There's a lot of lives that 'm responsible for
that's all
So, can't do anything
got myself into this mess and 'll get myself out of it
the best way  know how
One of the ways is not giving up
'm telling ya
Would you do something for me
Please
What
These guys that got me down here, you know, huh
they think that 'm part of this whole thing
They think 'm part of the plot to rob the bank
How did they think that
What are they

What do you mean
That's bullshit, Leon
They're giving you a fucken story
Well

Oh

That's a snow job
Don't listen to that shit

Shit

All right
Then what do you want me to say
Sonny, would you please just tell them

Where are they now

(meekly) Yeah
(annoyed) That's great
Just terrific
You talk to me with them on the phone, right
That is really smart
And, you don't tell me

You don't have a choice
No
They're standing all around me
Seven thousand fucken cops

Look

Who's on the phone, now
What do you mean

You knew it, right

But, what choice do  have

All right, enough
Who the fuck is on the phone

(angrily into phone) You on the phone
Will somebody talk to me
They won't talk to you
Are they on the phone still
Yeah

(still angry) All right
He didn't do it
All right
Now

(calmly to Leon) Anyway, Leon

Yeah
huh, thank you
'm going to go back, Sonny, to the hospital
They're really nice people
They're really trying to help me
That's good then
You've found something
Well

Do you still want the operation
(moody) Yeah
yeah
Well, then
It's my only chance
don't know what to say to ya guess  just wanted to say 'll see ya
or whatever
Thank you much
and huh, bon voyage
Right
See you sometime
Yeah
see ya in my dreams, huh
Yeah
'll write a song
Ha, ha
don't know
Life is funny
You said a mouthful
sweetheart
Sonny hangs up, walks back toward rear of bank and picks up receiver again on Edna's desk
(into phone) You cut off incoming, gimme a line
want to talk to my wife,  want to say goodbye to my kids
(line is connected, he begins to dial; anguished; to the group) Here  am,  could call, and they'd put anybody on the phone, the Pope, an astronaut, the wisest of the wise and who do  have to call
(to phone; as she answers) Heidi
'  - The  is on, the kids up and racing around, neighbors pouring beer -- An event
(on phone; excited) Hey, Sonny
'm watchin' it on
What about the kids
They don't know,  sent them to the neighbors
Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you
can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day knew you
Heidi, 'm dying
(oblivious) blame myself, Sonny
notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me
And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one-year- old kids
It's ridiculous
'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride
' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it
Yellin' at me in front of all those people
Because you never talked and  never been scared of you, never
think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river
Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up
Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen
(afraid) See
You're screaming with the language and all
person can't communicate with you
You become a stranger in your own home
he sits, dispiritedly listening to this rap: seeing her in a clear and unambiguous light as before he saw Leon: what a waste to live in the company of people like this
because you hurt me, God how you hurt me
Can you imagine, marrying another man
Did  do something to make you do that
Did  ever turn you down, or anything
The only thing  couldn't do, you're gonna laugh, is go on top -  got this fear of high places
(giggles) And  let myself get fat
Don't call yourself fat
know you can't stand me to say 'm fat
Like  can't stand you being a bank robber
guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny
(weakly) Heidi - why didn't you come down here
Jesus - what - 'm afraid - 'm gonna get shot or whatever
You oughta see it on , the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear
They're not after you, they're after me
Listen, it's late already when realize it's not just a couple of ordinary faggots, it's just you and Sal
couldn't get a baby sitter
Heidi goes on and on, but Sonny just drops the phone on the hook
As he walks toward the rear of the bank, Sylvia, seated atop Margaret's desk, gets off and follows Sonny toward the Conference room
At the same time, Edna is lifting Margaret's feet up onto a chair and Jenny and Deborah start to walk toward the Conference room, too
Maria paces back and forth, transistor to her ear
Sonny walks into the Conference room
The doctor is through examining Mulvaney
Miriam is seated across the table from him
Listen -  think  better take him back for a cardiac check
Mulvaney waves, protesting
He's had a shot; he's rapidly recovering
Anything
what's wrong
Is he gonna die
No,  just think
'm okay
'm okay
You know more than the Doctor
You're not okay, look at you
Come on
(to Doctor) let's get him out
'm not going
'm okay
As Sonny grabs him to try to help him up, Mulvaney wrenches away
little physical here
Hey
'm tryin' to help you
stay here
Damn it
just needed the insulin
'm used to it
Go on
Go on
(to Doctor) You tell me
Is he endangering his health, because if you tell me he is, 'll get him out
'll be God damned if you will
Oh, Jesus
You want to be a martyr or a hero or what
Maria and Miriam dance to transistor's music
Edna walks into Conference Room to tidy up
Sal is still sitting there
Deborah tries to comfort Jenny
don't wanta be either,  just want to be left alone
You understand that
wish the fuck you never came in my bank, that's all, don't try to act like you're some angel of human kindness
(he crosses toward Tellers' cages to start straightening up) Sonny nods, staring at him
As Doctor moves toward front door Sonny walks with him
Grabs marked bills and stuffs them into the Doctor's pocket
Here, my man
Whattayou get for a house call
As Doctor tries to wave it away: (continuing) No, no
want a top specialist for my friend,  expect to pay top money
He's hustled him to the door, where he ushers him out door
( ) -   -   [1ST  ] hastily made, about 40 feet long, being raised above the heads of crowd to where Sonny can see it
We can't read it until it's all the way up
Then is reads: As the crowd reads it, fist fights break out and it totters and staggers, but the defenders fight bravely
They are ordinary looking people -- not freaks
looking at it, at them with mixed feelings
standing across the street looking at him
Sheldon indicates his watch
Holds up ten fingers: "ten minutes"
He turns into the bank
- Sonny comes back into bank, his face mad with pain
He walks over to Sylvia, standing at open gate of Tellers'  Cages, and brings out a wallet with pictures for her to see
She takes it, smiles
My kids
Kimmy and Jimmy
They're beautiful
She looks over toward Mulvaney, now behind the Tellers' Cages, trying to tidy up, and walks over to show him the pictures
Sonny stands on the other side of the cages
(as Mulvaney looks at pictures) 'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney
They look like good kids
They're like any others but they're special to me
You got kids
You told me; you got two
Special to me, too
You like me
Sure - we like you
No you don't
You seem like a likable enough guy
It's hard to judge
Sonny walks back toward Sal, who is seated in Conference Room
Hey, Sal
How you doin'
Okay
Sonny crosses back downstage again to Mulvaney and Sylvia
(referring to Sal) You know,  don't know him very well - but he's not gay
and he's not going back to prison
One time when he was in prison, they gang- banged him; 13 years old and eight guys gave it to him
So Sal isn't goin' back to prison, no way
'm sorry
You know
like you people
really do
We like you, too
You know -  had a job once
used to work in a bank
had been training
used to have a boss
Mr
Don Frio
he wore a toupee
wonder if you'd hire me if  came in here and asked you for a job
Would  hire you
Yeah
Why not
(grinning) don't think so
Sonny walks back toward Sal
told you -- they're sending a jet
It's all worked out
But doubt hangs in the air like a pall
- looking at him
Implacable
This tension between them over the question of Sonny's loyalty must be kept constantly alive with  and looks, over dialogue
& Somebody give me another cigarette
Sal turns to look at her reproachfully
wish somebody would tell me 'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit
My parent, she'll be okay
My husband, he'll be okay
even know who the bum is gonna marry
Terrific
She'll take good care of him
Girls,  wanta apologize
For my language back there
Embarrassed, he walks toward the rest of group in the rear, stands by Edna's desk
Ladies
want to apologize for my language back there
(he walks over to his desk, sits down) Sonny exits Conference Room and moves downstage
(amazed) What'd you say
didn't hear you say anything
They think for a moment
He said the '' word
They stare at her incredulously
Someone giggles
What
The '' word
He did
He said the '' word
Edna crosses to her desk - disgusted - and starts to tidy up
The giggle catches the edge of their panic and anxiety and sweeps them into uncontrollable giggles and laughter: Sonny roars
Sal and Edna alone remain unsmiling
After a few seconds they force themselves to stop, to behave like they should under the circumstances
They are gasping and crying
Then
What's so funny
Well, 'm a Christian, and my ears are not garbage cans
It sets them off again
They howl and giggle and laugh
Until at last they run down again
At this point, Sal rushes out of Conference Room
Who's that
He has seen something in the middle of the street, and now
as they all turn to look out through the door
Backlighted by the floodlights in the middle of street escorted by Sheldon, stands a figure, dumpy and gray, tentatively waving, a figure that bends over baby carriages in the park, picks beans one by one out of supermarket bins, lip reads get-well cards in pharmacies
They hear Sheldon, outside, on bullhorn: (
) Sonny
Could you come out, please
Could you come out, please
It's my mother
Who needs this shit
But as a dutiful son he starts for the front of the bank
- as Sonny walks to his
Baker tactfully moves away, leaving the two of them in the center of the floodlighted street
Again the crowd can be  but not seen; armed police fringe the lights and shadows, in
What do you want here, Ma
You could of watched it on
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - - Alla Brooklyn is here
On all 3 networks
Mom -  got it all worked out; it's over
The best thing is you go home
Watch it on
talked to the ,  told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay
You did what
Who did you talk to
What for
Well, 'm only trying to get you outta this
told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems
Oh my God, mother
said you were never a faggot
Don't talk to them anymore
Sal and me are getting a jet, we're going to Algeria - 'll write you from there
He was very understanding - you ought to talk to him
Algeria
We can't stay here
Oh my God
don't understand
If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me
Everything  got is yours
got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings
It's yours
You know it
Sonny abruptly realizes he is getting sidetracked by Mom - like always
Tries to get it back again
Mom - they're sending a bus to take us to the airport
You understand
If you're here - they're not gonna send it
They'll think 'm gonna come out with you
What's wrong with that
The  was very understanding when  explained it to him
Everybody knows it isn't you
It's the pressures from your home life
For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again
Did  say a thing against her
God forbid  should say anything against that fat cunt
Mom
Mom
There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son
If she comes down here, so help me 'm gonna mash her brains in
Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her
Since then, forget it
She doesn't have anything to do with it
You understand that
Mother
This is me
know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right
The thing  don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway
You got two kids on welfare now
What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare
(this is old stuff) Not now, Mom, please
What'll you do
Come out
(patiently -  told you a hundred times) can't, Mom
If  come out Sal will kill them
Oh
(she thinks for a moment) Run
What the hell for
Twenty-five years in the pen
Maybe
Maybe
Aw Christ, what dreams you live on
Maybe what
She stares at him
He talks slowly and carefully to her
'm a fuckup and an outcast
There isn't one single person in my life haven't hurt through my love
You understand that
'm the most dangerous person in the world, because if  love you, watch out, you're gonna get fucked, fucked over and fucked out
No
Did Pop come down
No
This really pissed him off, Sonny
He says you're dead
He says he doesn't have a son
He's right
You shoulda done what he did
Go home
(embraces her) Don't talk to the  anymore
He walks away and moves toward the bank door
Her desperate smile, apologetic and false at the same time, glistens with a mother's tears
After a long beat: remember how beautiful you were
As a baby you were so beautiful
We had such hopes
-    - as Sonny enters and stops, controlling his emotions
He walks toward Mulvaney, who is putting visitor's chair back into position, then waters his plant
Maria and Miriam are still dancing; Margaret is at her desk; Sal, Jenny and Deborah are in the Conference Room; Sylvia is still behind Tellers' Cages
Mister Mulvaney
Yeah
Are you a lawyer
No
had some legal training, but
want to dictate my will
need a notary
'm a notary
She leaves Tellers' Cages area, crosses to Sonny, grabbing a pen from Edna's desk on the way
Sonny's urgent mood reaches them
Sylvia gets note pad from Mulvaney
Takes the dictation
Being of sound mind and body, and all that shit
Sylvia nods: got it
To my darling wife Leon whom  love as no other man has loved another man in all eternity,  leave $2,700 from my $10,000 life insurance policy, to be used for your sex change operation
If there is money left over it is to go to you on the first anniversary of my death, at my grave
expect you to be a real woman then, and your life full of happiness and joy
To my sweet wife, Heidi, five thousand from the same policy
You are the only woman  have ever loved, and  re-pledge my love to you in this sad moment, and to little Kimmy and Jimmy
hope you remember me, Jimmy
You are the little man of the family now, and will have to look after them for me
To my mother ask forgiveness
You don't understand the things  did and said, but 'm me, and 'm different leave you, the rest of the policy and my stamp collection
want a military funeral and am entitled to one free of charge
Life and love are not easy and we have to bend a lot
hope you find the places and the people to make you all happy as could not
God bless you and watch over you, as  shall, until we are joined in the hereafter, sweet Leon, my Heidi, dearest Kimmy and Jimmy, and my mother
Sonny
here 'll spell the last name
He sits and writes it for Sylvia
Type that up and 'll sign it
Nobody says anything about this document
What is there to say
Sylvia walks to her desk at the front of the bank, near the window, and begins typing
-   - The restless crowd , sensing something happening
Turning to see something coming
The Cops gear up their weapons: radios
Something, a vehicle, is moving through the crowd, Cops shoving people aside to let it through
The Old Lady pays no attention
She is down to one of the very last pieces of the puzzle and is searching for the spot for it
as the vehicle clears the crowd and slowly draws up in front
It is a long airport limousine of the type with many doors
It stops
Everyone's attention is on it
black gets out, a gay Afro knit on his head, coke dealer's shades, for the cognoscenti, one very long little finger nail, a nifty Van Dyke style beard and one gold front tooth
He looks around, holding a sheet of paper
Sheldon, others, approach
They are looking into the vehicles, opening doors, checking tires, etc
Sonny appears
He strides to the limo
Okay
Get away from it
After a moment the Cops all move back
Sonny opens the front door and begins to check it out
The Driver starts to move away
These seats come out
Yeah
-  - Together they remove the seat so Sonny can check for guns concealed below, etc
Improvise to fit conditions of the car
(dawning on him) Jesus, you're the man
Come on, what's under this
They pry up a seat and look under, etc
, all through: was lookin' at it
saw you, man
Jesus
You oughta see yourself
You wouldn't believe it
Yes,  would
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it
They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to (address in Brooklyn) and  say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors
' (finished) Okay
Driver stands up, getting a good look at Sonny
Well, by God 'm gonna remember you
And he turns and walks away
Driver stops, uncertainly
Cops grab him to hustle him away
Sheldon steps forward with a neat twenty-years-younger carbon copy of himself
Here's your driver, this is agent Murphy
Sonny and Murphy
Sonny eyes Murphy, thinks, then begins to frisk Murphy
He finds nothing
He stands up and eyes Murphy
He just doesn't like it
don't want him
What can he do, he's clean
Gimme the black guy
The Driver is still close enough to hear
Aw, hey
(overlapping everybody) Come on, nobody's gonna get hurt
If they were gonna shoot, they'd shoot now
can't allow that, Sonny
You can't allow
'm running this thing, what gives you the idea you can say shit
(to Driver) Come on
'll pay you
Whatta you want
Two hundred
thousand
The Driver looks around desperately to the , to get him out of this
Don't look at him
'm running this
Pause
Sheldon finally reluctantly nods
Sonny motions for him (the Driver) to step forward
Before he can get in the car, Sonny stops him
Signals to him to get ready
Gives him a thorough pat search
Thighs, the whole bit
It is tense
The Driver seems uptight
Sonny finds nothing until he touches a breast pocket
The Driver is very uptight
Sonny reaches in, pulls out a -- tiny bottle, with a coke spoon chained to the lid
Before Sheldon can see it, but the audience has, Sonny shoves it back, grins, slaps the Driver on the buns
The Driver laughs delightedly
He was afraid he'd get busted for the dope: the drive will be a cakewalk
You'll be okay
(to ) You men shoot, aim for the white meat
He loves the joke
They act as though they hadn't heard
Sonny slaps him playfully on the arm and smiling turns to Sheldon
want him
He points at Murphy
Sheldon stands there speechless
Driver stares at Sonny, his smile fading
(delighted) What do you think you're dealing with, an idiot
Sheldon nods to Driver and Murphy
Murphy resumes role as driver of the limo
Driver gets out
So long, copper
as they position the stretchout in front of the bank
It can be seen from inside
The  men stand well back from it
Murphy stands by the door
He also can be seen
Okay, Sonny
You follow my car
Murphy nods
Sonny is satisfied and turns to the bank, takes Murphy into vestibule, indicating for him to stay there
Sonny continues toward group at rear
- Sylvia is finishing her typing
The girls and Mulvaney are slowly getting ready
Deborah is getting her purse out of Margaret's desk drawer; Margaret gathering her own purse, books, etc
; Jenny is getting her purse from Edna's desk as Edna gathers up her belongings; Mulvaney is seated at his desk; Miriam is at her desk, by the front door
Sal stands with his gun ready
[As Sonny enters and takes up his gun, Sal carefully and methodically begins to redress himself, comb his rumpled hair, knotting his tie carefully
] as he rebuilds his sartorial image before the various reflecting surfaces of the bank, knotting his tie in a glass partition, checking his suit for wrinkles in a glass door, etc
Meanwhile we are seeing the following, which Sal ignores: Hey, let's get ready
(gets up, walks to Sonny) Sonny - Here's your document
looking at the will, taking up pen
, watching him with compassion
Sonny signs fast and firmly
Sylvia's notary seal clamps and imprints the paper
- Okay, okay, okay
What a bunch of cold fish
It's an adventure
Everybody's gonna remember you the rest of your lives, the day you got held up and kidnapped
hey
His eye has struck some reminder
They handle this
You got Bank Americard
(tired) What now, Sonny
(gathers money from near-by money bag) Listen,  owe a couple hundred dollars
don't wanta leave owing anybody anything
clean slate, a new leaf
He plunks his card down before Sylvia
(continuing) paying off
(money from attached case) Here
Two hundred should do it
They start the action of filing the form and accepting the money
Sonny stops them
Just give me a receipt
Hey, Sal, you okay
(deep in his hair or tie or
) Okay, Sonny
All right
(accepts receipt) Here's your document, Sonny
Yeah - it looks real official
They are ready
moment in the dark
Sonny holds out the will to Mulvaney
Hold it for me
Mulvaney takes it
Sonny shakes his hand
Suddenly, emotionally, he embraces Sylvia
Suddenly they are all saying silent goodbyes
Shaking hands all around, formally
Only Sal is left untouched, standing apart, watching them, in the dark
- Everyone waits in silence
The lights
The limo
The Driver waiting in the driver's seat
After a beat the door begins to open
as Cops' guns are brought to bear
On the apartment fire escape the Old Lady is asleep, her puzzle complete
The snipers raise their rifles
- Sheldon stands there
The police radio network : "They're coming out
Perpetrators and hostages together
Only authorized personnel may previously authorized, and etc
"  Sheldon's eyes go to: - middle-aged Man who looks like an overweight accountant, in flak vest and helmet that seems too small, aiming through a telescopic sight at: (letting Murphy out first; yells outside) Get away from the car
Something that looks like a multi-legged animal emerges
It is Sonny and Sal in the center of a tight group of the girls and Mulvaney, so they are completely protected on all sides by hostages
Over their heads is thrown some drapes from the bank that further prevent the police from drawing a clear head on Sonny or Sal without hitting a girl
In fact they can't be seen at all
This weird apparition appears, hesitates
The crowd : "
" so the group hesitates, takes a step forward, then it's clear Sonny can't see well enough to go direct to the car, and the girls are uncertain which direction to go in, not having been briefed
So they stumble about, make false starts, and finally arrive at the car, where one girl gets into the second row of seats behind the Driver
Then Sonny slides across next to Driver
The police have no chance to shoot
The group looks like a bewildered centipede finding its way
Mulvaney detaches himself from the group and slips into the front seat, on Sonny's right
standing alone, outside filled-up limo
Sheldon walks over to Mulvaney's window
(to Sheldon) Okay - you got your one
(to Murphy) You follow my car
(he moves off) Maria gets in the rear-most row of seats
Sal next to her in the middle and then another girl
One woman, Edna, a plain middle-aged woman who has not said a word until now is left over
She stands by the side of the limo as the doors close and this phase of the operation ends, without mishap
(elated) Fuck
We did it
(to Edna) Goodbye, honey
Wish us luck
Edna pecks out dry little kisses to the nearest girls
' as Edna pecks
goodbye
'll be a son of a bitch -- we're all okay
Hey, man
Honk the horn
Let's go
Sal has his gun pointed on back of Driver's head
Hey, Sal - do me a favor
point that gun up, huh
We hit a bump and the fuckin' gun'll go off
The Driver honks the : they're ready
The crowd
Cops keep jockeying for position, but there is no way to get a shot in
No emotion
He steps into his car, a police car pulls up behind, and the procession starts to pull slowly toward the crowd
As the limo pulls away, she is bewildered by the rush of police, bank people,  men who stream past her, ignoring her, all pouring into the bank
crews move by and finally -- one stops to interview her
being rammed through the jam of Cops and screaming people trying to get a last look
The hostages looking out, wan, worried
Sonny and Sal inside, alert, ready with guns
- Sal - please keep that gun pointed up, huh
- from inside the limo
The faces of the poor, the excited, the vicious the curious, and in   some of the people from the Gay Liberation Movement carrying hastily lettered signs: one protesting Sonny: And another: Their scared and wan faces swim past in the mob
Sonny's mother is briefly seen looking out of the barber shop window, alone and forgotten
The Cops stare heavily, sullen with anger
Now the limo is moving faster
People are running alongside, insults, trying to see in, asking for hand-outs, but they are going faster
Inside, they say nothing
Up ahead, Sheldon's car flashes a red light
Behind, the police car does the same
- as the procession moves through Brooklyn
helicopter follows above them
They move along, followed by a  parade of kibitzing cars, like a Mexican wedding
They turn onto the thruway, trying to out-distance the cars tagging along
Silence
Sonny and Sal hold their rifles ready between their knees
as they veer off the thruway, a barely seen Guard swings open a gate and they  through
The Guard pushes the gate to, and the following caravan of cars brakes, skids and a pile-up of fender bender accidents begin, cars going into the fence and each other
- Cars are strewn all around
Doors open and Drivers leap out ready to  and do battle
The Cops guard the now closed gate
- Distant lights, some moving
Total darkness
The  car, the limo, the following police car move across the darkness
- They sit quiet, following the  car
The  car stops
They stop
Silence
Murphy, can you see what they're doing
He's still got some arrangements to make
Sheldon is getting out of the car up ahead
Sonny and Sal and all of them come alert
As Sheldon and the other men get out of their car, a pair of aircraft landing lights become visible, taxiing towards the limo
There it is, Sal
Sal
'm here
Oh, Jesus
Hey
How about food
forgot to ask to have food on board
Sheldon has been walking down to the limo
He stops beside Mulvaney and  on the window
Mulvaney rolls it down
That's the jet
You give us one more, now
That's the deal
Okay
Which one goes
There is silence inside the limo
Mulvaney turns to Sylvia
Sylvia
From a handkerchief, Sylvia draws a slip of paper
It's Maria
Go on, honey
They open the door
They urge her out, and Maria goes with a show of reluctance
As she stands up outside she is revealed to have a rosary she's counting
goodbyes, tearful and fearful all around
Then: pray for your safety
(meaning Sonny and Sal) Sal
Because  know it's your first plane trip
Don't be scared, you know
(gives him her rosary) And Maria walks away
Now the plane has taxied into position, where it can be seen in floodlights
It looks big and impressive
We know the  has snipers ringing it
ain't eaten all day
just realized it
We'll have hamburgers on the plane
You ready
(turns to Sal again) Sal, keep it up, huh
The gun - please
- looking at the plane, grasping his money and his gun
The rifle stands straight up between his legs
Sheldon leans down, peering in at him
What do you think, Sal
You ready to go
- in front of Sonny, behind Mulvaney
For the first time he smiles
He realizes that escape is within their grasp
The smile transforms him from a formidable Mafia imitation into an utterly sweet and defenseless youth
(gun pointing high) Hey, Sonny - You did it
- Let's move it, goddamn it
(to Driver) You ready to get out first
Yes
Driver starts to turn in the driver's seat
Sheldon brings up his hands to reach through the open window to grab Sonny's rifle barrel, pushes it away, aiming out windshield
Mulvaney sees them beginning their move and starts to duck
Sal begins to see movement out of the corner of his eyes and is barely beginning to react
Sonny sees it, and Sheldon's hand grabbing the barrel of his gun at the same moment
Sheldon drives hard into the side of the limo, reaching in
Mulvaney grabs the girl next to him and pulls her by the hair down toward the floor
Sal, open-mouthed with amazement, is a split-second late bringing his gun up
Driver completes his turn and has his gun leveled at Sal between Miriam and Margaret in middle row
Sheldon grabs his rifle barrel and pulls hard
Sonny lets it go
Sal stares at the gun barrel, trying to get his gun up
Driver
Mulvaney hits the floor
Sheldon holds Sonny's gun
Sonny, , watches
Sal, hit, slams back into the seat; the gun flies upward
Another  hits him, flinging his head back
Driver holds his third shot, turns to Sonny - holds gun to his temple
Sonny looks down so he can see fully as: Sal's head snaps back for a split second and stares directly into Sonny's eyes, upside down
He stares sadly, into Sonny's eyes
As though he knew it all along -- betrayed
And dies
The  is
Now , ,  doors, panic
Sonny's voice:  "Shoot me
For God's sake, shoot me
" They come pouring out of the limo, scrambling frantically away from it
The limo -- the people fleeing it
Agents pull people away from the car
Driver and Sheldon and Cops peer into the back
Sal's body lies slumped
Driver, Sheldon, other Cops stand about, recovering
No one makes the slightest sort of congratulatory move, it was just another job
Driver clears his weapon, hands it to Sheldon to be filed in case of investigation
, , They hug, cry, laugh, jump up and down: they're alive
(to Mulvaney) been dying to do this for years
And she kisses him hard in the mouth
He laughs and kisses back
- Tears are beginning to flood past his defenses: (
) You are under arrest
You have the right to remain silent
You have the right to counsel to be present, during your interrogation
(etc
) His voice is dry, as though he were reciting from memory something he learned in a language he doesn't understand
: -  - like a Warhol interview on
Segue
Well,  don't see how Sonny can survive in prison, he was very loud, very boisterous
He was obnoxious
-   - being manipulated like so much beef by impersonal agents
(
) He was very hard to live with
(
) He made me laugh
- Remnants of the crowd of sightseers, being interviewed by men avid for more, more, more news
these are people among the group that held up the big banner earlier: now we see them up
They're folding up their banner
very ordinary-looking
love him
He put an end to all that pansy limp wristed shit
They're getting off his belt, his shoe laces
(
) Because he always had a way of getting out, always in the army he was
manacled and helpless
He is twisted into some yet more uncomfortable position by the uncaring Agents
(
) can't help thinking how he might ring the bell one of these days
That's why 'm nervous, because 'm always thinking some day he's gonna come along and ring the bell
Sal's body is carried, Sonny, seeing it out of the corner of his eye
He tries to look
Keep your eyes front
- faded, rattled woman, perhaps a little drunk
How did you know your son was involved
It was on the
When was the last time you saw Sal
Oh, a long time
Because  kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be
He wasn't around here
thought maybe he was in prison or some place
Did you know he was a homosexual
No, not until after they killed him
Did you always call him Junior
Yeah
Do you remember anything else about Sal
No, that's all
- Sonny isn't even listening
he sees something o
s
: Hey
The hostages moving toward a car to take them home are passing nearby and turn to look at him
Goodbye
You were terrific
Mouth
You're beautiful
See you
They stare at him; they've already begun to forget him: the moment in the bank when they said their goodbyes is already receding from their consciousness
Their smiles are forced, and they don't really know what to say
Ah, Sonny
Good luck, you know
You were terrific, too
Hey
It's raining
And, as the first welcome drops of cooling rain fall, they begin to move fast
looking after them
The rain hitting his face
the adventure is over
But the everlasting smile overtakes him
'm glad
Life is easier with him in prison
It would be like always, the bell would ring, we'd have a ball
