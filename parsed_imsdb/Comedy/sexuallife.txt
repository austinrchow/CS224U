Written by Ken Kwapis Draft: 08/03 : - From an   we see the outline of a city
Any city will do
Mirrored high rises
Sprawling apartment complexes lot of people live here
whoever they are
As we move closer we discover that this is not a real city at all, but a scale model of one
Everything is in miniature -- the buildings, parks, and freeways
over this tabletop metropolis, we find that none of the buildings have roofs, allowing us to peak inside
We  through miniature coffee shops, offices, and bedrooms, where toy figures are arranged in tableau of everyday life man dines alone
woman walks her dog
Two kiss on the street
One waits for a bus
Over this we  Marianne Faithful's smoky-voiced cover of the standard "When We're Alone" Just picture a penthouse Way up in the sky, With hinges on chimney For stars to go by,  sweet slice of heaven For just you and , When we're alone
From all of society We'll stay aloof, And live in propriety There on the roof, Two heavenly hermits We'll be in true, When we're alone
As the song ends we find a miniature girl who lies on a miniature bed
: '   - cramped one-room studio
Asleep on a futon is a slender girl of nineteen --
Her blood red toenails give the place its only color
An alarm clock rings it's twelve noon
Lorna uses her foot to turn it off
Terri
Why did you let me sleep so late
Lorna looks over to an empty pull-out sofa, its only occupant a skinny kitten
(') (cont'd) Terri
(to the cat) She must already be at work, huh
The cat meows -- very non-committal
: '  - Still in her -shirt and panties, Lorna opens a can of cat food as the kitten looks on
She probably forgot what day it is, right Arthur
Some friend she turned out to be
Not like you
You remember what day it is, don't you
(off the cat's blank stare) 'm not giving you any food until you tell me
Arthur the cat responds with a pitiful meow
Lorna smiles and sets down the food
(') (cont'd) That's right
knew you'd remember
- Lorna, dressed casually, walks to the bus stop
Reading the crossword puzzle in the paper, she doesn't see the curb and trips, spilling her purse
Embarrassed, she gathers her things, then takes a seat next to a Latino Woman
Lorna smiles and resumes work on the puzzle
Stumped by a clue, she turns to the Woman
Hmm
Simon and Garfunkel hit
Eight letters
Any thoughts
The Woman shrugs and looks off
Suddenly, Lorna's phone rings
She reaches into her purse but it's not there
Then, she spots it
in the street
But the moment she goes to get it, a truck roars past and smashes it to smithereens
(') (cont'd) Oh my god
But as she scoops up the pieces in her hand a smile creeps across her face
(') (cont'd) No, this is right
This is exactly right
- few notches up from a greasy spoon
Lorna sits at the counter, stirring her coffee
approaches
Excuse me, whatever happened to that sign, the one that used to hang next to the pies
The Waitress looks over her shoulder
What sign
The one that said, "Today is the first day of the rest of your life
" That thing
We got rid of it
Oh
Have you decided
Before Lorna can speak, we hear-- She'll have the steak and egg special
Lorna turns as , her roommate, joins her at the counter
little older than Lorna, Terri is cute but a little dangerous
Look at her, she needs protein
Lots of protein
(to the Waitress) White toast
Dry
The Waitress leaves
Working early today, huh
No,  had something important to do
Terri opens her bag and pulls out a small, gift-wrapped box
Miss nineteen
knew you'd remember
Terri gives Lorna a kiss on the lips
Of course  remembered
Go on, open it
No, no
wasn't born until ten minutes before midnight
And that's when 'll open it
You better like it
don't want to tell what  had to do to pay for it
Ooh
It must be good
So what's the plan, Stan
Something special today
Other than splurging on toast
Yes
There is something
Good
Count me in
No
Something big
Something 've been thinking about for a long time
Terri sighs -- she knows exactly where this is going
can't do this forever, Terri
Look
Lorna points to the corner of her eye
Crow's feet
'm nineteen
Crow's feet
know  keep talking about it, but this time 'm going to do it
In fact,  did it
This is my last day
Okay
called them
told them  was out
You did not
Uh-huh
have one more appointment
Then, 'm
free
Give me your cell phone
'm calling them back right now
Lorna smiles and pours the shattered remnants of her phone on the counter
bus ran over it
Isn't that perfect
It's a perfect sign
Terri pops a cigarette in her mouth as the Waitress delivers the toast
(to Terri) Can't do that here, Miss
know,  know
'm not going to light the damn thing
(beat) Fuck me
Look, 'm good for next month's rent
This takes Terri by surprise
What, you're leaving too
Maybe
Get out of town for a while
really feel good about this
(beat) appreciate everything you've done for me this year, Terri
wish you'd talked to me first
didn't because
knew you'd try to talk me out of it
That's because 'm looking out for you
It's because there is so much opportunity here
(beat) And it's because 'm your friend
Lorna fiddles with her toast
know
(beat) Listen, 'm late
Lorna leaves some change on the counter, picks up her gift and gives Terri a hug
Thanks
Well
Happy Birthday
As Lorna goes, the Waitress reappears
Your friend comin' back
Hard to say
'  - Someone is flipping through a stack of wedding photos
Festive shots of various couples
At the altar
Cutting the cake
Posing with relatives
We're in -- living room, Lorna sits on the couch browsing the wedding photos
She has a quizzical look, as if the photos were of some incomprehensible alien culture
The apartment is cluttered but not dirty
The decor suggests an occupant of modest means and bohemian taste
The occupant is , who  counting a wad of money
Late twenties
Unshaven
By turns, cocky and nervous
He sets the money in front of Lorna
Seventy-five, right
For the half-hour
Not including tip
She smiles
Todd paces uneasily
And, typically, the size of the tip is
Depends on how generous you feel
Of course
Is
this your first appointment
No
've done this before
Lorna thinks otherwise
She pats the seat next to her
Come over here, you're making me nervous
He plops down next to her
So, how much extra do you feel like spending
don't know
Another fifty dollars
Uh-huh
She thumbs through the wedding photos
So, this is what you do
Weddings
It pays the rent
These are good
You're really a good photographer
Well, somebody thinks so
get a lot of work
And you can only spend another fifty on me
Todd walked right into that one
(') (cont'd) Maybe you'll feel more generous once you get to know me
Lorna smiles
Her face has an open, unguarded beauty
You have a great smile, do you know that
Yeah, 've heard
And  like your name
Lorna
Like the cookie
Gee, 've never hear that one before
She laughs at him
But it's not unkind
(') (cont'd) have a friend who makes photos
She's had some stuff in magazines
Really dirty stuff, though
Worse than dirty
Sick, really
You probably wouldn't like it
Hey, 'm not afraid of sick images
In fact, it's what  aspire to do, create pictures that are edgy, that really assault you, that reach out and slap you in the face
Lorna considers this
Why
Well
don't know
Shake people out of their
complacency
Your friend would understand
What's her work like
She photographs people pissing on each other
Uh-huh
Yeah
disgusting
Maybe that's the point
But who would want to look at that
mean, bathrooms have doors for a reason
What do you like
like things that make me happy
Like this
Lorna holds up a photo of a beautiful, smiling bride
bet she's going to have a very happy life
She lingers over the photo
don't think 'm the marrying kind, though
Me, neither
Marriage, it's so
medieval
Sometimes when 'm doing a wedding  look at the bride and groom and think, "What a couple of lemmings
" 'm not sure people can be true, that's all
Right
That, too
Lorna puts down the photos
Well
Now that we've gotten to know each better, maybe we should get started
'  - Alone, Lorna prepares
She tears open a condom wrapper, stares into the mirror and runs her lines
Oh, you really have a big cock
My, you really have a big cock
God, what a big cock you have
'  - Lorna and Todd are having sex
She's on top, her movements slow and hypnotic
Occasionally, Lorna offers a moan, some are more convincing than others
: Throughout the scene, our  generally exclude Todd from view
We may  him, but our focus is on -- As she goes about her work, Lorna wears a vaguely puzzled expressions
In fact, puzzles are on her mind
Forty-two across
Simon & Garfunkel hit
eight letters
begins with ''
'm  Loser
Did they sing that
Susie used to play Mom's Simon & Garfunkel records all the time
scratched one once and she pulled my hair
haven't spoken to her for almost a year
Her little kid must be walking by now
Maybe should give Susie a call
Nah, fuck that
She's perfectly capable of calling me
mean, 'm listed
'm
am a rock
that's it
Am  Rock, that's the answer
am a-- Suddenly, Lorna remembers the job at hand
(flatly) God, you really have a big cock
Like Pavlov's proverbial dog, Todd  and the whole thing is quickly over
Lorna gives Todd a look -- it's an astonishing impersonation of tenderness
Wow
That was something
Yeah
was it
Let me tell you
that was something
Really
Cut the modesty
You really know what you're doing
'  - Lorna, dressed, is dialing the kitchen phone
From the kitchen window she can see a school playground across the way
It's recess
Girls in uniforms perform a jump rope cadence
(into phone) Hey, it's Lorna
'm clocking out for the last time
No, 'm not done for the day, 'm done
Wait,  don't think you heard me
Well, just give it to one of the other girls
Give it to Terri
don't care if he's an important client,  told you 'm
Well, you'll just have to cancel it, won't you
don't care what it pays, it's not my fuckin'-- She turns to find Todd in the doorway, listening
(into phone) Hold on
(to Todd) What
Nothing
Are you alright
'm fine
The cab fare will be another twenty
You never said anything about cab fare
Of course  did
Are you calling me a liar
No
swear, you didn't say a word about it
Lorna slowly brings the phone to her ear
(into phone) Alright
Where is it
'  -  - Todd is at the wheel of his vintage Buick
Lorna sits on the passenger side
She looks off, distracted
On the seat between them is the gift from Terri, still unopened
You haven't told me where we're going yet
Make a right at the light
He does
Can  ask you a question
(without a beat) No, forget it
it's stupid
Go on, ask
Well, after we
after we did it, you didn't really mean what you said, did you
About me being so good
Lorna looks at him like he's the biggest fool in the world
This is not lost on him
(back-peddling) 'm only asking because 'm fascinated by this whole scene you're in
So, don't worry about sparing my feelings or anything
'm just curious
Pull over
What
Pull over here
He does
Up the block is a high-rise, luxury hotel
Limos and cabs line the driveway
Uniformed doormen guard the entrance
You see that hotel
In one of those rooms, there's a man waiting
he's waiting for me
don't know what his name is or what he looks like
He may have bad skin
He may be really ugly
But no matter how he looks, or how bad he smells, or whether he makes weird wheezing sounds when he comes,  tell him the same thing
the same thing  told you
Right
Well, that's what  thought
mean, a guy would have to be pretty lame to think that
Todd knows better than to even finish
To think what
Nothing
Quite out of the blue, she leans over and kisses him on the cheek
It's Todd, right
Yeah
Well, Todd, you're alright
(beat) And that  don't say that to everyone
She opens the door, starts out-- If  wanted to see you again-- No
You can't
You can't see me again
(beat) But thanks for asking
'  - Lorna closes the door and starts for the hotel
Todd drives past, watching her recede in the rear-view mirror
The moment she disappears, Todd looks down and sees the gift box from Terri -- Lorna left it on the seat
Without missing a beat, Todd slams on the brakes, jumps out and races back to where he left her
Looking everywhere-- Lorna
Lorna
But Lorna is gone
- business that specializes in sentimental portraits -- weddings, graduations, anniversaries
even beloved pets
photo shoot in progress
Todd and his colleague  -- mid-30s, are doing an engagement portrait
The couple -- very straight and suburban -- are just of out Todd and Phil's earshot
(to the couple) Beautiful, just beautiful
(to Todd) You used a rubber,  hope
Of course
And how much did this afternoon delight set you back
Oh
About a buck and a quarter
(to the couple) We just need to reload
As they do-- Since when do you have a hundred and twenty-five dollars to throw away
'm sure you spend just as much on porn rentals
There's no comparison
Here, 'll do the math for you
Phil pulls a calculator out of his camera bag
(') (cont'd) (punching in numbers) video rents for $2
65
That's a two-day rental
That means you can get off at least a couple times before it's due
$125 divided by $2
65 equals approximately 47
47  2 = 94
can get off ninety-four times for the same amount you paid to get off once
Now tell me who gets the better deal
You're right
can't argue with that
Anyway,  stopped watching porno
You did
Why
They kinda depress me
(beat) When  want to get off now, you know what  use
What
Phil taps his forehead
My imagination
(to the couple) Okay, folks
It's magic time
The couple is gone
Phil and Todd wrap some equipment
Phil (cont'd) What  don't understand is, aren't you getting enough action from that Sarah
What's Sarah got to do with it
You're seeing her, aren't you
Sarah
that's a whole different situation
But you're doing it with her, right
like Sarah a lot
And  don't want to blow it by pushing too hard
Phil stares
You mean, you haven't
Technically
No
She won't put out
No, no, no
You don't get it
You can't equate the two
What did with Lorna-- Lorna
That's her name
Lorna
mean, that's the name she gave me
What  did with her
that was like going to some exotic place
For a visit
Haven't you ever wondered what that kind of person is like
What that world is like
was just
doing research
The lower depths
(beat) You think 'm full of shit, don't you
didn't say anything
: - revival house in a college neighborhood
The ticket seller hangs a "Sold Out" sign in the box office window, just as Todd and  come running down the sidewalk
Shit
Sold out
Sarah, at twenty-five, is cute, brainy, articulate, and hopelessly insecure
They lean against the wall and catch their breath
am so sorry
That's alright
hear it's really overrated
And long
could just kill him
This is not the first time he's done this, either
Done what
Cooked up some phony emergency, right as 'm getting on the elevator
He's your boss
Being an asshole is part of the job description
We're talking about the most self-centered man  have ever met
God forbid  should have a life, right
(beat) But 'm not going to let him do it
Do what
Ruin my evening
Our evening
(without a beat) You know, he also thinks he's God's gift to women
'm surprised he hasn't been sued by now
Okay, okay
Stop me
He takes her by the shoulders
Sarah
Take a breath
Okay
'm taking a breath
And she does
Now, take another one
like you
Have  told you that
Not today
You know what  want to do
want to go shopping
Shopping
For what
For a house
(completely thrown) Just what  was thinking
'  -  - Todd drives Sarah through a neighborhood full of beautifully-maintained old homes
She is a kid in a candy store-- Look at the detail on that one
Wow
Every one of these is a gem
Makes the stuff  work on look pretty shabby by comparison
She shifts to get a better look
In doing so, her foot hits an object on the floor
What's this
She lifts up Lorna's birthday gift -- still unwrapped
Todd reacts -- he forgot to get rid of it -- and Sarah reacts to Todd
Obviously, not for me
Something
somebody left in front the studio
just picked it up
Sarah nods -- she seems to buy it -- and promptly opens the box
What are you doing
Maybe we can find out whose it is
Inside is a silver bracelet, and a hand-written note
(reading) "Lorna
Remember, 'm in your corner
Love, Terri
"  Pretty cool bracelet
You just found this
Stupid of me
should've left it
Lorna
That's a name you don't hear very much
Lorna
Like the cookie
(off Todd's look) What
You've never had a Lorna Doone
No
Terri and Lorna
Sisters, maybe
Lovers, more like it
Or
witches
And this bracelet is some sort of talisman
You have a perverse mind
(beat) which  like, by the way
Or
perhaps Terri killed Lorna, and this "gift" provides her with an alibi
Maybe you should put it back
What, aren't you a little curious
Todd pulls over and stops
Sarah
don't know how to put this
This is our fourth night out, and  feel a lot of pressure
for this to work
want it to work, too
(off his look) Oh
Is this about sex
Don't you think we're being a little
methodical about the whole thing
Maybe we should just
What
Get it over with
Not exactly
Don't you think it's better to be sure of each other first
To have a little bit of trust
Sarah absently fingers the bracelet that's not hers
You can trust me
know,  know
(beat) But you're not sleeping with anyone else, right
Of course not
It's not such a strange thing to ask
Sometimes relationships
overlap
just need to feel-- told you
'm not
Beat
You haven't asked me if 'm seeing anyone
Is that bad
It's silly,  know, but it makes me feel like you couldn't imagine anyone being interested in me
What
You should be flattered  don't ask
respect you enough to assume you'd tell me if you're involved with someone
Sarah considers this
Hmm
Ask me, anyway
Are you serious
(off her look) Alright
Are you seeing anyone
Absolutely not
Todd takes the bracelet, puts it on the dash, then leans to kiss Sarah
do want to make love tonight
'm just worried that all this talk is going to kill the spontaneity-- She presses her finger to his lips-- think spontaneity is overrated
'   - Todd and Sarah are making out in her bedroom
To expedite matters, they're also trying to undress
It's not very practical
Todd can't quite kick off his shoes
Sarah can't quite get her blouse unbuttoned
Finally-- Todd, the light
He switches it off
They sit side by side and undress down to their underwear
They look at each other
Wait
Don't say anything
Okay
Beat
What were you going to say
wasn't going to say anything
Oh
You look beautiful-- No, don't say that
Let's get under the covers
They climb into bed and move into each other's arms
Let's go slowly
They kiss, caress, shedding their inhibitions
Then-- Oh
Oww
What happened
Dammit
my foot
've got one of those
what's the word
bunion Not a bunion
spasm
Oh, a foot spasm
Here let me-- He throws back the covers and massages her foot
Oww
No, stop
It hurts
hate this
What can we do
Nothing, it's fine, it's fine
Lemme just walk it off
She gets out of bed and hobbles into-- '  - Dressed in bra and panties, Sarah hops up and down the hall, desperate to relieve her pain
Todd appears in the doorway and watches her mad little dance
His thoughts-- She has a better-looking body than  imagined
Breasts are definitely bigger than  thought
You can just never tell with breasts, can you
don't know what to make of this foot problem
Maybe she gets a spasm every time she has sex
've heard of people with problems like that
People who can't have sex without laughing, or burping
Oh, God, what if she's one of them
Sarah looks up from her hopping
am so embarrassed
Trust me, this doesn't happen all the time
The thought never crossed my mind
'  - Sarah and Todd, back under the covers, making love
Todd is on top, moving slowly
Sarah bites her lip and closes her eyes
Todd looks at her and wonders -- She won't look at me
Why won't she look at me
'll bet she's preoccupied with her foot
She's praying she won't get another spasm, another foot freak-out
She's being awfully quiet, too
Why is she so quiet
Maybe she needs to concentrate
Some women need to concentrate
read that in a magazine at the grocery store
That blonde check-out girl who works there is really cute
love the way she says, "Paper or plastic
"
Todd lets out an excited gasp
Sarah opens her eyes with alarm
Todd
Shhh
Todd stops
Everything stops
What's the matter
These walls, they're paper-thin
This building is so poorly built
Everyone can hear you
Todd rolls off of her
Is that why you're so quiet
Yes, the walls are
What are you saying
It's hard for me to tell if you're enjoying this
Of course,  am
'm sorry if 'm not vocal enough for you
That's not what
Sarah,  just want to make sure 'm doing something right here
There's no right or wrong way to do this
know
just want to make sure 'm
you know, in the ballpark
Sarah stares at him
Todd,  don't expect you to do everything right the first time
Sorry, that didn't come out the way  meant it
They roll away from each other and stare at the ceiling
We hear a distant siren -- a fire engine, maybe
Somewhere there's a five-alarm fire blazing
Not here
You didn't like it
No,  didn't say that
was just
Let's be still for a while
Alright
: : '  -  - Sarah and Todd haven't moved
It's not clear how much time has elapsed
Everyone expects fireworks the first time you do it
But that's just a myth
myth
You're right
Let's not be too hard on ourselves
agree
Our expectations were a little high, that's all
Todd nods his agreement
And at the end of the day, sex is only one part of the picture
True
What do you mean
know this couple
They had nothing in common but good sex
They went at it like a pair of rabbits
And guess how long it lasted
month
They were hot for each other
but there was nothing else
Right
(beat) There's got to be something else
And they stare at the ceiling
: : '  -   - They still haven't moved, but unbeknownst to Sarah, Todd has fallen asleep
She looks at him
She caresses his face
Then, her hand slides down under the sheets
She tries to arouse him, but after a while she stops
He's very much asleep
Sarah lies back
She slides her hand between her legs and begins to touch herself
Quietly
: : - Early morning
The air is cool and crisp as Sarah, wearing sweats and a -shirt, jogs through the neighborhood
She turns down a side street, heading for-- '   - nondescript house with a faded American flag hanging off the front porch
Sarah climbs the steps where an elderly man -- her , sits with the morning paper in his lap, unread
Sarah gives him a kiss
Morning, Pappy
How's she doing today
Don't pay her any mind, Sarah
The things she says, they get stranger by the day
Sarah pays him no mind and heads into the house
- Sarah and her  sit on the back porch, which offers a splendid view of
other people's back porches
Sarah's Grandmother has a sense of mischief that's quite at odds with her deteriorating frame
The two drink coffee
They keep telling me 'm doing fine, that 'm even improving
Why do they have to lie
At my age
What are they trying to protect me from
Maybe they know something you don't
Like hell
She pulls out a pack of American Spirit cigarettes and lights one
Sarah reacts
Nan
What
One in the morning with coffee
One at night with cocktails
Where was
(beat) Oh, yes
My story is coming to an end, Sarah-- Oh, please
Your story, that's the one  want to hear
wish  had a story to tell
Hmm
The last time there was talk of an admirer
All you want is dirt, Nan
Admit it
The world is made of dirt, Sarah
So, please, dish
No detail is too small
'm sleeping with two different men
Hmm
Continue
One of them is a good man
He's good for me
Like vitamins
Sort of
The other one, he can be a complete ass
total jerk
In other words
he excites you
He does
And  hate it
hate him
And, on top of that, can't have him
Can you see your Pappy
Sarah looks back over her shoulder
She catches a glimpse of her Grandfather
He's still on the front porch
He hasn't moved
Good
Keep an eye on him
Why
Because 'm going to tell you something he shouldn't hear
Something no one knows
Once,  had two lovers
One was your grandfather
He had prospects, then
He had a car and we drove everywhere and people would look at us and say, "Now, there goes a couple
" He never pushed me
He told me he respected my virginity
And  liked that
They hear a loud creak
Don't worry
He's not moving
The other man -- he was a boy, really -- he had no prospects
And he had no car
And he had no respect
for anything
He certainly had no respect for my virginity
And  liked that, too
She takes a long, luxurious drag
But  had to make a choice
chose your grandfather
The day before the wedding,  went to let the other boy down
Met him by a river where we used to swim
Well, one thing led to another, and when  returned home that night, 'd left my virginity back in the tall grass by that river
Sarah sits on the edge of her chair
But  did bring something back
bite mark
That sonuvabitch left on my neck, the size of a peach pit
Did Pappy see it
He did and he didn't
On the wedding night -- in this house --  managed to squeak by
It was dark
We were shy
He took me in his arms and said, "'m glad you waited for me
"  In other words,  lost my virginity twice in the same week
They both laugh
No small feat
It's an accomplishment
But the next morning, your Pappy saw it
He demanded an explanation
And, Sarah, do you know how got out of that pickle
You lied
Damn right
said, "What, you don't remember giving me this
" He said, "No
"  And  said, "Well, you were so fired up last night, it's a wonder you can remember anything
" (beat) And the beast was tamed
Sarah considers the story
And you've never been tempted to
What
Come clean with your Pappy
Why should  tell him
He had nothing to do with it
Right
It's mine
Not his
wonder what became of that boy
Never saw him again
don't regret a thing, if that's what you're wondering
was, in fact
Look what  have
have you
(beat) And you know what else
have the tall grass by that river
And those clouds
From where  was laying the clouds looked really beautiful that day
/ - The same model we saw at the start of our story
We glide toward a miniature suburban development
Row upon row of houses, each no different than the next
Over this -- don't believe it
You're actually asking my opinion
You really want to know what  think
We   to reveal that we're in-- The well-appointed office of the well-heeled , an architect in his early 40s
Josh studies the model like a boy with a train set
Sarah stands beside him
To tell you the truth, no
just wanted to hear your voice
You've barely said "boo" to me all morning
(shrugs) Boo
Alright, what do you think of it
You'd have to pay me to live in that neighborhood
(off his look) Hey, what do  know
'm just the assistant
What are they going to think
That's all that matters
To paraphrase you, this is going to give them a major hard-on
Not the women, of course
You haven't met these women
Sarah laughs, catches herself and stops
- Sarah and Josh move down a hall toward the elevators
Josh is in micro-management mode -- The champagne order
Done
Dom Perignon
Fifteen cases
Invitations
messenger is meeting us at the site with the proofs
Good
He reaches behind her and pats her butt
Stop it
can't
Have you never heard of the phrase "impulse control"
They reach the elevators
love it when you're full of contempt
She just glares
People are starting to notice, Josh
work very hard to act completely indifferent toward you
The least you could do is to keep your hands to yourself
've got a better idea
What
Why don't  distribute a memo, informing everyone that you and are not sleeping together
Josh, just for the sake of variety, could you take me seriously for a moment
Alright, alright
have another idea
Please, don't
Let's just end it
Beat
Yes
think we should
Josh didn't expect this
The elevator arrives
He steps aboard and holds the door for her
Coming
'm going to take the stairs
Josh shrugs and lets the doors close
beat
Sarah considers the stairs, then hits the down button again
- Sarah and Todd eat lunch on a bench in a busy promenade
Deli sandwiches in wax paper rest on their laps
can't put my finger on it
just don't feel it's happening with us
You don't want it work out, that's what you're saying
do
mean,  did
It's no one's fault
It's chemistry
Beat
You want your pickle
Do you want your pickle
You know what the problem is
The first night we went out, we should've just fucked
Right away
Without thinking
Two dumb bunnies
Without any history,  any baggage
pair of blank slates
Fucking
It could've been perfectly meaningless
You want chemistry
The less you think, the better the chemistry
Less talk, more action
'm sorry
It's just not happening for me
The least you can do is give me your goddam pickle
They look away from each other
Todd eats in silence
The pickle sits between them
- Josh's model come to life
fallow stretch of land lined with unfinished houses, some more skeletal than others
At one site we find two parked cars
gold Lincoln Navigator and an old  convertible
- house-in-progress
The walls are in place, but little else
Stray two-by-fours, saw horses, electrical cable
And
no roof
In an upstairs room -- what will soon be the master bedroom, Josh confers with a construction supervisor
Nearby, Sarah talks on her cell phone
(into phone) don't care if it costs the same, if it's not Dom Perignon tell them we don't want it, alright
Good
Anybody else call
Nobody, huh
Okay
As she hangs up the construction supervisor exits
Sarah and Josh are alone
Guess 'll be heading back
Wait
(beat) About the other day
Are you having any second thoughts
(shrugs) No
None
You're angry  called it quits, aren't you
You can admit it
No
In fact,  want to thank you
For what
For sparing me from the most unhealthy relationship 've ever had in my life
For that,  thank you
Josh raises his hands in surrender
Touche
Are you having seconds thoughts
No
say, let's make a clean break
Let's just walk away from it
Sarah smiles
She extends her hand
What are you doing
Let's seal the deal
Shake
It's a little awkward, but they do
Alright
Now that we've put that behind us, there's one problem left
What
Where do we put the bed
Josh gestures to the empty room
Sarah smiles -- it's a familiar game
Oh, the bed
Let's put it against this wall
Away from the morning sun
Wrong
It's got to go here
So you can see the hallway
They head out
As Josh and Sarah leave the house, they "decorate" several rooms
-- Not enough height for bunk beds
Why do you assume there will be two children
There has to be
They need to keep each other company
-- Definitely not enough space for two people to cook
prefer to eat out
-- They size up the space, enjoying their play
Sara walks around imaginary furniture
Oh, no
wouldn't put the ottoman there
Where would you put it
It needs to go over
She waves her hand, accidentally brushing against Josh's chest
She lets her hand linger
Hmmm
What
and linger
They both know what's happening
We have another problem
And that would be
What do we do with the elephant in the room
You're very clever
She rubs his chest
We shouldn't be rude to an elephant
She lets her hand drop to his crotch
They can get very annoyed
if you ignore them
She pulls Josh to her and kisses him
Josh fairly attacks her, his hands all over her body
After a few lustful beats, he lifts her and she wraps her legs around him
Josh
The door
It's an absurd request -- the room is completely exposed, but Josh carries her to the front door and kicks it closed
--as the door slams, obscuring our view
With Sarah's back against the door, Josh enters her
She looks up
With no roof above them, she has a brilliant view of
the clouds
They float past as she thinks-- (
) (cont'd) Let's not put a roof on this house today
let's leave the walls unfinished
it's okay not to know where the sofa goes
The colors
We can choose them another day
like it the way it is
undone
undecided
a work in progress
She moans -- there's nothing quiet about her at all
Fade out
: -  - Josh and Sarah have finished
He tucks in his shirt
She puts on a shoe
have to tell you, that was the best "break-up" sex 've ever had
Sarah considers this
Nods
It was, wasn't it
(beat) Closure is important
jOSH Now you can move on
You can meet someone who
sarah What
Someone who's not a prick like you
Josh reacts -- slightly offended
joSH No
Someone who's
free
sarah Oh
Right
(beat) As if that would have made any difference in this
what is this thing called again
relationship
She's fishing -- she hates herself for it
sarah (cont'd) It wouldn't have made any difference, right
jOSH 'm surprised you have to ask
sarah 'm not asking
He'll answer, anyway
joSH If my hands weren't tied
it might have made all the difference
Beat
sarah said  wasn't asking
And that's the worst answer you could've given
cUT - Josh and Sarah get into their respective cars -- her , his Navigator
Josh looks at himself in the rear-view mirror
He reacts-- JoSH What the hell is this
Sarah looks over
joSH (cont'd) You bit me on the neck
've got a goddam hickey
Sure enough, there is a bright red mark on his neck
Sarah comes over
She reacts with shock, embarrassment, then
laughter
joSH (cont'd) What's so goddam funny
You did this on purpose, didn't you
sarah did not
was just
didn't mean to
was caught up in the moment
And she laughs again
jOSH What the hell are we going to do about this
sARAH Josh, you are a big boy
You can take care of this on your own
Josh glares at her, starts his engine, and leaves her in the dust
cUT : '  - Todd is on the kitchen phone
Lorna's bracelet sits on the counter
(into phone) No, no, no
You don't understand
don't want an appointment, just need to get in touch with her
She left a package here by mistake, a gift
No, 'd rather give it to her myself
Lorna, but  assume none of you use your real names
What
But she was working last week
And you don't have a forwarding number
Look, it's really important that  get this back to her, so-- The line goes dead
Dammit
He dials again
Then, a knock at the door
Todd reacts -- he's not expecting anyone
He opens the door and finds-- Still dressed in the clothes she wore earlier
She holds a small paper bag
Sarah
brought you something
She hands him the bag
He looks inside
Pickles
Huh
(beat) What's in your hair
She touches her hair
Oh
Sawdust
Lots of sawdust at the job site
(beat) Can  come in
Todd puts the bag of pickles on the kitchen counter
He sees Lorna's bracelet
and slides it into a trash can
- Josh, still sporting his hickey, approaches the humorless teenage behind the counter
Need some help
Yes,  have a problem
need some
something to cover up a
Hell, just take a look
Josh shows the Girl his hickey
Yeah
You're fucked
can do without the attitude, thank-you
Try concealer
Aisle three
(impatient) But what do  do with it
Just put it on
And call your lawyer
She smiles
'  - In the driveway of his fashionable home are two parked cars
Josh's Mercedes S430 and his wife's Lexus RX300
In the Mercedes, Josh finishes applying the concealer to his neck
He checks himself in the mirror -- the hickey is completely gone
His hands, however, have concealer all over them
'  - Josh washes his hands in the master bathroom
He double-checks his neck in the mirror
From the adjoining bedroom, we hear -- but do not see -- his wife
Unbelievable
What
'm reading a stupid article in a stupid magazine
If it's stupid, why read it
(ignores this) The whole issue is devoted to famous couples who are breaking up
Listen to this
Remember the blonde doctor on that show you hate
Yeah
She's a bore
She's breaking up with her husband of twenty years
Said a friend, "Her show's in syndication, she's thin, she's rich and she wants to play
" Josh dries his hands
Some poor tree gave its life so we could know that
It's comforting, reading about these broken marriages
Josh opens the door into the-- '  - Gwen sits under the covers with her magazine
In her late 30s, she is a refined, patrician beauty
As Josh undresses for bed-- Why
It's not enough for our marriage to succeed
Everyone else's must fail
Is this going to be one of those nights
What
One of those nights we talk
No
There's no need to talk, because there's no problem
He gets into bed next to her
've been under a lot of stress
You don't have to apologize
There's nothing wrong with the slump we're going through
In fact, it's a good thing
How's that
He turns off the side light
We can't see them -- the room is completely dark
Too much passion can ruin a marriage
Look at Eric and Sylvia
At the beginning, you couldn't pry them apart
They were joined at the genitals
And, then
total burn-out
marriage cannot sustain that kind of intensity
It's good for people to grow bored with each other
That way, they can meet and fall in love again
She snuggles up to him, strokes his back
In case you hadn't noticed
'm trying to seduce you
can feel that
You're welcome to reciprocate
Josh turns on the light and sits up
can't
It's alright
To seduce
to be seduced, there needs to be an element of surprise
know all your moves
You know mine
How can there be any surprise
Gwen sits up, throws back the sheet
Rub my feet
He does
think we should have an affair
What
With each other
That makes no sense
You pick me up at a bar
And, what
Pretend  don't know you
(ignores him) Or we could meet at a hotel
'll register under my maiden name
Just like
is about a married woman having an affair with a college boy
When  met you, you were a college boy
Gwen,   is a story about a very unhappy woman who has an affair out of wedlock
As  recall, it turns out rather badly for her
Alright
Bad example
(rethe foot rub) You can stop
Actors pretend
That's what they do
'm not an actor
And love you the way you are
love you, too
And he turns out the light again
Pretending to be strangers is not going to solve the problem
Beat
Who said there was a problem
- cocktail party at Josh's firm
Josh is the center of attention, greeting investors, fielding compliments
Gwen stands beside him, drinking champagne -- Dom Perignon, after all
' Through the crowd he spots Sarah, entering with her date -- Todd
Your lovely assistant is here
(reTodd) You didn't tell me she had a new boyfriend
don't ask her about her personal life
Sarah and Todd arrive
Hey, you two
Todd, this is my boss Josh, and his wife Gwen
Todd and Josh shake hands
Sarah's told me a lot about you
Josh is not sure how to take that
Sarah, you look great
You've been keeping my boy on his best behavior
It's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it
know he asks to go above and beyond the call of duty
He can be tough
But fair
Josh, 'm trying to thank Sarah for all the extra attention she gives you
You're welcome
We should really have you over for dinner, Sarah
It's been too long
You can bring
Todd
Sorry
'm hopeless when it comes to names
Especially after two glasses of champagne
Hey, 'm still working on the first, thank you
(to Todd) So, are you two living together
Living together
No
Sarah and Todd both laugh
We've only known each other a few weeks
Josh reacts -- he knew nothing of this
You two seem to fit
It only took me a few days to know with Josh
In fact,  knew after the first date
You knew what
That he was the one for me
(to Sarah) She loves to embarrass me
(to Gwen) Don't stop
want to hear about this first date
Well, it was the cheapest date 've ever been on
was broke
Do you know the Chinese place on Third
That little hole-in-the-wall
know it
Used to be a cool dive
Now it's ultra-hip and overpriced
This news gives Gwen pause
Really
think our first dinner cost a grand total of ten dollars
Gwen loves to dissect our first date
It was a momentous night
Babe, we should really go back there
Josh gestures to the bar
Gwen, why don't you continue your stroll down memory lane while drink
Todd, you up for it
Sure
They move away toward-- -   - As Josh and Todd sidle up--
(to bartender) Gin
Straight up
Olives
(Todd) What are you having
'm fine, thanks
So
Sarah's an attractive girl
Very
You two serious
(shrugs) Hard to say
She wants to play the field, right
No, that's not it
see
You want to fuck around
Todd reacts
'mon, we're guys
know the drill
Todd considers his audience, then decides to open up-- We dated a few times, and to be honest,  was on the fence about Sarah
liked her, but  didn't think we were in a good groove
Then, a couple weeks ago, her grandmother died
Things changed
didn't know
(beat) She didn't say a thing about it
It wasn't unexpected, but Sarah took it really hard
So where did that leave me
was ambivalent about things, right
But then my ambivalence had to take a back seat
had to be there for her
Completely
And, ready or not, our relationship became
a real relationship
Josh simply listens
You know,  wasn't ready to be that involved with anybody don't know
Death has a funny way of making you get outside yourself
Josh looks past Todd-- ' Gwen is still chatting with Sarah
Gwen makes eye contact with Josh and sends him a warm smile
'  -  - Josh and Gwen drive home in silence
Gwen notices something out the window
You missed the on-ramp
know
Why
Somewhere we need to go first
- The Mercedes pulls up to the "Happiness Chinese Restaurant
" Josh and Gwen get out and take in the sight-- We don't have to do this tonight
Yes, we do
She peers in the window
We can't go in here
Everything's different
He opens the door for her
That's okay
We're different, too
- Upscale lighting
Modern, non-Chinese decor
Anything but a hole-in-the-wall
Josh and Gwen are in a booth-- Sarah's a very interesting girl
Did you know she's training for the marathon
don't want to talk about Sarah
What do you want to talk about, then
want to talk about me
beat
and what a fool 've been
Gwen is not prepared for this
thought if we came here tonight we could
start again
(flustered) But  thought you were over this place
And, look
There's nothing left
Not one remnant of our first date
anywhere
Josh sees a plate of fortune cookies on the next table -- somebody left without eating them
(brightens) The fortune cookies haven't changed
He brings over the plate
You're supposed to wait-- can't wait
have to know
He opens the first
(reading) "You are on the verge of success"
in bed
Gwen laughs, opens one herself
(reading) "You will have a change of plans"
in bed
Josh reacts, opens a third
(reading) "You are very creative"
in bed
Hmm
That's what 've heard
The last cookie
Go ahead
No
You open it
He slowly cracks in open
It's blank
(checks both sides) got a blank
Blank
in bed
That's disappointing
No, it's perfect
Blank
no problems, no history, nothing
in bed
He takes her hand
- Josh and Gwen approach their car
It's late
Behind them, the restaurant is closing
By the way,  didn't get your name
What
(off his smile) Oh, my name
She glances across the street
shop window sign reads, "Bail Bonds
" My name is Gail
Gail Bonds
Well, Gail, 'm not usually this forward on a first date, may take you to my car and ravish you
Hmm
On one condition
What's that
That you tell me your name
Oh,  thought everyone knew my name
'm Bill Gates
Billionaire
She laughs
'  -- They get into the back seat and begin to kiss
Is it true what they say, Bill, about billionaires
That all the wealth is just a way to compensate
for size
People are jealous
can imagine
It must be so lonely at the top
He reaches between her knees
What are you doing
What do you think 'm doing
(beat) The fortune cookie said you're on the verge of success
in bed
We're not in a bed
You shouldn't read fortune cookies too literally
Josh swings Gwen onto his lap
They go at each other like
a couple of college kids
As he makes love to his wife, he thinks-- Can anyone see us
Is anyone looking
Why should it bother you
You're alone
with your wife
That's the way it's supposed to be
You know every inch of her
every smell
every sigh
every freckle
the shape of her ass
the mole under her nipple
the whole history of her body
And, you know that if you really concentrate, you can succeed
in imagining
she's someone you don't know
He puts his mind to it-- : : '  - Gwen and her mother  are in the living room looking at samples of fabric
At sixty, Joanne is robust and shrewd
Color
That's the problem with this room, it needs color
Think of
the vibrant colors of Haiti
Personally, Haiti does nothing for me
When your father and were there -- this was before you were born,  almost died from a piece of lettuce, and  wouldn't want anything to remind me of that trip
(beat) Anyway, quit changing the subject
Gwen puts down the swatches
Alright
didn't say anything
Because you're not sure
No, 'm sure
'm sure he's sleeping with her
(beat) And  may have to kill him
Hmm
What
You think  should just forget about it
Yes,  do
Mother, don't you think honesty is essential in a marriage
It depends
It can be quite detrimental
Gwen begins to pace in exasperation
Alright
Confront him
You know where it will get you
Your whole marriage will unravel, and you'll have nothing
All the things you take for granted -- month-long vacations in St
Lucia -- they'll disappear
You'll be a divorced woman in her late 30s
Lonely
Why did  invite you over
You make me feel like shit
That's my job
The phone rings
The machine can get it
don't monitor calls
It makes me feel like 'm hiding in my own home
From the answering machine-- Gwen, this is David Warren
Hopefully, a welcome voice from your past
My show's on hiatus and 'm in town for the weekend
'd love to catch up
Are you free for coffee
or something
Pick up the phone
Gwen just stares at the machine
have no idea what you're up to
hope life is treating you well
heard through a friend of a friend of a friend that you're still married
Congratulations
If you want, give me a call
'm crashing at my sister's
The number is -- hold on-- the number is 235-4511
Hope to hear from you
Wow
How long has it been
College
Have you ever seen his show
It's absolutely dreadful
never miss it
If Josh isn't home, 'll watch it
Hmm
It's Kismet, then
What
brief liaison with an old flame
The perfect way to deal with your anger
You're insane
You're an insane mother
It'll be good for your self-esteem
Did it occur to you that maybe he just wants to have coffee
Joanne crosses to the answering machine
Rewinds the tape
Hits play
' on hiatus and 'm in town for the weekend
Are you free for coffee
or something
She hits stop
"Coffee
or something
"  He's flirting, admit it
Coffee
or something
He's stammering
He's nervous
He's calling out of the blue
Joanne gathers her purse
You're wrong
'm right, and 'm going
But take a tip from someone who's been there
Opportunity is knocking, Gwen
You have a chance to level the playing field
(beat) You have a chance to do something good for your marriage
Joanne exits
'  - Morning
Gwen, fresh from the shower, studies her face in the mirror as Josh -- unseen, in the bedroom -- dresses for work
You're right
We could use some more color in the living room
(beat) Gwen
Yes
said you're right
About what
About more color in the living room
Oh
'm glad you think so
She leans closer to inspect a new wrinkle
- An upscale hotel
Gwen, in a sheer blouse and a slim leather skirt, fills out the registration card at the front desk
The looks up from his computer
And how many nights will you be staying with us
One
We do have a two-night minimum
Then
two
She hands him the card
'd like to pay in cash
That won't be a problem
We just need a credit card imprint for your incidentals
Gwen reacts
The Desk Clerk puts her at ease
which we tear up when you check out
Gwen smiles
Will you be needing more than one key
Two, please
- Gwen and  lunch in the hotel's elegant dining room
David is quite the draw, turning heads across the room
And, it's no wonder
He has real magnetism
'm still reeling
It was the most humbling experience of my life
Getting raked over the coals by a bunch of sixteen-year old drama students
At my own alma mater
'm surprised they weren't all over you
They were, with knives drawn
What did they say
Basically, why am  working on a piece of shit like when  should be doing Shakespeare or Chekhov
(beat) It was brutal
delivers a bottle of champagne to David
Compliments from the table in the corner
The Waiter gestures
David and Gwen turn
In the corner three middle-aged women are smiling
David mouths a gracious "thank you" their way
See
Those women are happy you're not doing Shakespeare
Beat
Gwen
You look great
You haven't changed a bit
don't think 'm   material
Those women
Walking boob jobs
They're appalling
You look like you enjoy kissing them
It's very simple
close my eyes and imagine 'm kissing someone else
Hmm
Someone else in particular
Yes
If she's as tan as you,  don't want to hear about it
David reaches for his wallet
Here, take a look
He hands her a photo
In it, we see David standing with a distinguished man in his mid-40s
With them is a smiling boy, about eleven
Gwen is nonplussed
What's wrong with this picture, huh
She smiles
Well
Let's start with the man, upper left
Andy
My partner
And the best thing that's ever happened to me
Okay
And the boy
Eric
He's Andy's son from a marriage that -- needless to say -- didn't work
Andy came out when Eric was just five
Great kid
And when did you
Come out
About fifteen years ago
(off Gwen's look) Is this too much information
No
But fifteen years ago
That was right after-- You and me
Was  the last woman
David nods
Was  that bad
David laughs
No, you were fantastic
was completely confused
Gwen quickly gulps down some champagne
What's the matter
Nothing
'm very happy for you
And,  have to confess, 'm relieved
Why
Beat
Oh -- what the hell -- we're friends, right
'm listening
had this ridiculous idea that you wanted to get together to have a
Oh
You know
for old time's sake
Uh-huh
And, frankly,  wasn't looking forward to turning you down
Which  would have, of course
Had you
asked
Which you're not, because you're
you're
Married
Right
Happily
Right
She slides her empty glass toward him
Would you pour me a little more, David
- Gwen leans against the front desk
Tipsy
The Desk Clerk approaches
Can  help you, ma'am
Gwen looks lost
Are you okay
'd like to check out
Was there a problem
Yes
was stood up
by the past
Beat
'm sorry
We won't charge you for the room
No, you don't understand
Yes
do
(beat) More than you might think
Gwen stares at him
Shall  close out the account
No
need the room after all
(beat) Will you show me the way there
The Desk Clerk looks at her with no apparent interest
You're in luck
was just about to take my break
- The Desk Clerk and Gwen ride in the elevator
Silently
There is no discernible connection between them
- The Desk Clerk leads Gwen to the room
It couldn't look more business-like
- They enter
He locks the door
She surveys the room
Something from the mini-bar
No
How's the air conditioning
Fine
Shall  pull down the covers
suppose
Do you want to know my name
No
He takes her in his arms
You're shaking
'll be fine
(beat) This could get you in trouble
You could lose your job, right
don't care
You don't even know me
You're right
We have nothing in common
Beat
That's where you're wrong
He begins to unbutton her blouse
Without touching
Without affection
After a beat, she begins to unbutton his shirt
- little later
maid vacuums the carpet as the Desk Clerk emerges, followed by Gwen
They cross to the elevator, as business-like as before
(to the Maid) Buenas tardes, senora
- Gwen and the Desk Clerk board the elevator
He presses "" for lobby
She presses "" for parking
Thank you for taking care of the room
Your welcome
And they ride in silence
In Gwen's mind-- And now the score is tied
Oh my God, what will  tell my mother
did it with a desk clerk
Hardly the affair to remember
Of course, she will disapprove
"Is English even his first language
This is your idea of a liaison
Your idea of leveling the playing field
You don't even know the boy's name--" Gwen touches the Desk Clerk's arm
What's your name
David
What
You're kidding me
Gwen laughs -- she can't help it
No
What's so funny
Nothing, it's just-- She laughs even harder
The elevator door opens
David gets out and looks at her oddly
Sorry,  just
didn't think you'd be named David
- The door closes on Gwen, leaving David in the lobby
bit befuddled
- David resumes his post
#2 works beside him
He leans to David-- #2 There's a woman waiting to see you
She's been here for half an hour
He points to a lobby chair, where we find  -- 22, spunky, mercurial
In short
trouble
She and David made eye contact
She springs up and advances toward him
Why are you here
You weren't going to return my calls
Don't you have more important things to do
Picking flowers, honeymoon reservations
Is there somewhere we can talk
The desk phone rings
David picks it up
(into phone) Front desk, David speaking
No, sir
Tap water is very drinkable in this city
Of course, sir
We'll send up some bottled water right away
He hangs up
Is there somewhere we can talk
What's wrong with here
Privately
But here,  won't be tempted to raise my voice or do something rash
That's the first lesson of hotel management
Never lose your cool, no matter how annoying the guest is
Not that  plan to go into hotel management
don't have ambitions in that direction
Or any direction, if  recall you correctly
The desk phone rings again
Exasperated, David grabs it
(into phone) Front desk, David speaking
Yes, ma'am, the restaurant has a smoking section
Well,  didn't make the policy
If it's any consolation, the smokers are seated in a little corner of the patio, and they feel very bad about themselves
He hangs up
And gives Rosalie a very deliberate look
Rosie, you'd better leave
Before  get myself fired
She starts to protest
Thinks better of it, and exits
- David hangs his uniform shirt in his locker
He gathers his personal things
jacket, a knapsack, and
a violin case
The   approaches
Yo, fiddler on the roof
David reacts -- this is the last person he wants to deal with
(regards the violin) Wish  could play an instrument
Chicks really dig that stuff
Tried the guitar in high school
What can  say
No discipline
Discipline
Always a struggle
hear you
For instance, it takes a certain discipline to know that when you're working at the hotel, when you're on the clock
(shrugs) you shouldn't fuck the guests
David was not expecting this
(cont'd) You want to bring your girlfriend here on your day off
That's a different story
'll even give you the corporate rate on a room
(beat) Just don't do it while you're on the clock
You hear me
It won't happen again
Good
David marches away
- In a sun-lit practice room, a string quartet rehearses
Four men -- David included, perform an energetic movement from a Beethoven quartet
: Throughout the film, we've heard this string quartet as underscore
Now
we meet the soundtrack
David plays with emotion and a physicality we haven't seen in him -- truly, this is where he lives
- After the rehearsal
Violin at his side, David trudges through the exit
Music emanates from every room
He turns a corner, runs smack into-- She's been waiting
Jesus
She simply picks up where they left off-- want you to be there on Sunday
No
You told me we'd always be friends
lied
You're an important part of my life, David
There's so much history between us
don't want to trash it simply because-- Because what
Because you're getting married
Beat
Rosie,  want you to be happy
do
And someday, we'll be friends
Someday, we'll all go out to dinner
The four of us
The four of us
Sure
Me, you, Jerry, and whatever pale imitation of you  can dig up to be my date
Stop it
But he's on a roll-- And the check will come and Jerry will pick up the tab and 'll protest, but not too much
Then, you'll give me a kiss on the cheek, and some dim memory will stir in me, but not for too long
And we'll say, "It was great to see you
"  And it will be great to see you
(beat) then
But, until then
good-bye
David exits, leaving Rosalie alone in the cacophonous hall
- clean, modern apartment that Rosalie shares with  -- late 20s, upstanding, sturdy good looks
Rosalie and Jerry sit in the living room, meeting with their -- a highly efficient woman in her mid-50s
We've  got a few more things to cover
The photos
There's a courtyard behind the church
It's a popular backdrop
Our photographer says the light is gorgeous
We need twenty minutes before the ceremony for singles
(beat) Oh
Jerry, your father's press secretary insists on sending someone from the papers
told him you want to keep this as private as possible, but
What could  do
know
It is an election year
Exactly what he said
It's okay
Right
The guest list
We have a few more no-show's
She consults a list
Mr
and Mrs
Bennett send their regrets
Also, Ms
Rothman will no be attending
Oh
David Freeman
He's not coming
Jerry reacts
He's not
No
He's not
After all that shit you put me through, now he's not even coming
The Wedding Planner smiles politely
So, if there are any last-minute-- (ignores her) guess that means you've been talking with him
Yes,  talked to him
And
(to Wedding Planner) Would you excuse us for a minute
Take your time
Rosalie gets up and leads Jerry into-- -- Once they are out of earshot-- talked to David
And
uninvited him
What
told him it wasn't right
told him he shouldn't be at our wedding
When did you decide this
don't know
just realized  don't want our wedding to be about where 've been
want it to be about where you and are going
What did he say
Jerry
want to know
He was disappointed-- Of course he was
He's still in love with you
But he understands
drew the line, honey
Thank-you
did it for us
Rosalie gives him a kiss
'  - Amidst a clutter of unpaid bills, take-out cartons, and laundry, David practices the violin
He plays a Bach Partita -- not for the easily intimidated
The phone rings
He lets it ring a while before picking up
(into phone) What do you want, Rose
Were you sleeping
Yes
was
Liar
You're practicing
can hear you
He moves to the window
' Rosalie -- on her cell -- waves to him from the sidewalk, three stories below
It's so sad
Why do you always play sad songs
don't write 'em, Rose
(beat) Is our conversation over now
Please let me in
No
She laughs mischievously
You don't trust me
No
(beat) Stay there
'll be right
Wait a minute
This is insane
'm not coming down
Go home, Rose
mean it
'm going to wait here for one minute
Sixty seconds
You do that
Then, 'm gone
You won't see me again
She hangs up
He hangs up
' Rosalie sits on the front steps
Stubborn
(to himself) Be my guest
Sit there all night
David turns from the window
He accidentally knocks his metronome to the floor, setting it off
Click
click
click
David shuts it off, goes to the door
His hand on the knob-- If  go down those stairs
it will only lead to one place
right back here
the two of us
a short, brilliant moment
one more to add to the gallery
then, empty-handed again, with nothing to show for it but an emotional hangover
'm not going to open this door
Discipline
Like the man said, don't fuck the guests
'  - Rosalie is on the front steps
She smiles as she hears the door open -- it's David
He joins her
've got nothing to say to you
Fine
'll talk
beat
The reason  won't just leave you alone is not because 'm "confused
" My feelings are perfectly clear
know you find it incomprehensible that  can love Jerry and love you
And that one love has nothing to do with the other
But it's true
Rose
What
This is bullshit
can't spell it out any more plainly
It's impossible
Why
Because  can't be this close to you
and not want to touch you
That's it
That's
it
And he does touch her
He puts his hand on her leg
And if  can't do that,  don't want to be your friend
Not now
Not ever
Don't be so mean
David flashes an angry look
Then, he pulls Rosalie close to him
The bottom line is
If 'm with you,  have to touch you, to kiss you
That doesn't work for friends, does it
She doesn't answer -- she lets him stroke her leg
When 'm not with you -- this is more than you need to know
If touch myself,  can only think about one person
You
No one else
Just you
(beat) Friends
that's bullshit
What do we do
What do you mean "we"
This is your problem
(beat) My only problem is how to get you out of my mind
How to erase you
Delete every bit of you
(presses an imaginary key) Into the ether
Stop
She kisses him
He engulfs her in his arms
You have to say good-bye
don't know how
'  - David and Rosalie have sex on the single bed in his spartan room
She's on top of him -- they face each other
The lovemaking is both fierce and tender -- longing and leaving, rolled into one
As Rosalie grows more aroused, she begins to cry
Tears quietly stream down her cheeks
David reacts-- Should we stop
Rosalie is too choked up to answer -- she shakes her head "no
" And they continue -- tears and sex
'  -  - David sits in bed alone, while Rosalie showers in the adjoining bathroom
David, will you hand me my shampoo
It's in my purse
David opens Rosalie's purse and finds a travel-size bottle of shampoo
He just shakes his head
'  -  - Rosalie drives home
Checks herself in the mirror -- her hair is still damp
She rolls down the window to "blow dry" it
She turns on the radio, finds a rock-and-roll station
Noisy, mindless, perfect
In her mind-- Hail Mary, full of Grace, blessed be the  fruit of thy womb Jesus
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death, Amen
Hail Mary, full of Grace, blessed be the fruit of
'  - After midnight
Rosalie slips inside the door
No sign of Jerry
She removes her shoes and tiptoes into-- '  - The television is on -- the sound is muted
An infomercial is playing
Jerry is sleeping
She nudges him
He doesn't stir
Rosalie sits at the foot of the bed
She grabs the remote and "un-mutes" the sound
'  -   - physical fitness  is talking
And the change is not just physical
You'll be amazed how quickly your whole outlook will-- '  - She flicks off the
Rosalie undresses and climbs into bed
She starts to kiss Jerry
Slowly, he wakes
Hey
Hey
What time is it
Late
He looks at the time
It is late
What happened
Oh
The girls
Wedding talk
We could've gone on all night
She rubs his chest
Jerry
What
We need to make love now
Okay
why now
can't explain it
We just need to make love now
He nods
He kisses her neck, her breasts
Suddenly she stops him, taking his face in her hands
What's the matter
just need to fix this moment in my mind
long beat
She studies his face
love you
Totally
Completely
don't want to spend another minute of my life without you
(off his reaction) You don't have to say anything
She climbs on top of him
You're forgetting something
No, 'm not
He laughs uncomfortably
Don't you think
No,  don't
Let's not use it tonight
(beat) 'm ready
beat
If you're ready, so am
She straddles him, rocking back and forth
With grim determination
Jerry
What
Talk to me
: : - Jerry and Rosalie -- dressed informally -- pose for a publicity photo
The photographer is Todd
Each click of his camera brings a blinding
todd Very good
you both look great
perfect shot for the paper
rOSALIE (to Jerry, sotto voce) didn't mean to put pressure on you
jeRRY Babe, you're making too much out of this
(beat) It's not like  didn't enjoy making love
rOSALIE know
(beat) But  also know you would've enjoyed it more if  hadn't
jeRRY Raised the stakes
roSALIE wasn't going to put it that way
(beat) But it's true
jeRRY Maybe it is
But, please don't read too much into it
rOSALIE won't
promise
cUT : - High ceiling
Stained glass windows
Dark mahogany pews
At the altar, Jerry and Rosalie confer with their  -- late 60s, doctrinaire
They're rehearsing
lot of young couples prefer "husband and wife" to the traditional "man and wife
"  Personally,  don't feel the phrase "man and wife" gives the woman a diminutive status
But  leave the choice in your hands
Do you have a-- Husband and wife
Definitely
Jerry simply nods
Good
(to Jerry) After the blessing, 'll instruct you to kiss the bride
Keep it simple
No slobbering
That could be tough
For him
The Priest feigns amusement
Remember, this is God's house
And there will be prominent people here as well
Not to mention the press
So, let's keep things on the up-and-up
JerRY Right
: - Jerry accompanies his  -- late 50s, on a cigar-buying expedition
Tobacco enthusiasts relax in leather chairs
Wafts of smoke hang in the air -- expensive smoke
Jerry's Father finds a brand he likes
Here we are
Bahia Gold
Two hundred a box
You don't have to do this, Dad
If  can't come to the bachelor party,  want to be there in spirit
(beat) The boys will like these
Classic
Thank-you
remember my bachelor night
Frankly,  wish  didn't
Not a night 'm particularly proud of
'll leave it at that
Why are you sharing this
Reminiscing
That's all
Or warning me
Nonsense
know you
You won't make an ass out of yourself
(beat) Oh
little something from your mother and me
He reaches into his pocket, hands Jerry a key
What's this
It's a key
(smiles) There's a new housing development, just west of here
've been giving the developer a lot of breaks, and
now he's giving me one in return
'm almost embarrassed to say how little this cost me
can't accept this
Yes, you can
(beat) 'mon
Make your old man happy
Jerry says nothing
Uh-huh
get it
This is Rosalie's domain
She should have a say in where you two settle down
But don't worry, you won't be forcing her hand
Know why
Because she's going to love it
Jerry just nods
Let's ring these babies up
- Bachelor party in progress
In the living room, a dozen guys smoke Cuban-rolled cigars, drink shots of Tequila, and watch a Stripper perform
The least boisterous of the group is Jerry, who watches the action with a drunken glow
The party's host, Jerry's  , enters and summons Jerry into-- -- The Best Friend aims Jerry toward the stairs
Alright, my man
You ready
Do  have a choice
No
Then, 'm ready
The guys pitched in for this
He pats Jerry on the back
So go up there and get our money's worth
Jerry starts up-- - Jerry approaches the bedroom door with a fateful air
He touches the door knob
In his mind-- Why am  stopping
There's a hot girl waiting on the other side of the door
Why worry
Everyone cuts you slack for this kind of thing
This is supposed to happen
It's a tradition, a time-honored ritual
Losing your tooth, losing your virginity, losing the championship
If  walk through this door, what am losing
Nothing
My father was here, and his father was here, and his father's father was here, hand on the door
What am waiting for
He pushes it open
- Jerry enters
The room is dark, except for a shaft of moonlight that silhouettes a girl on the bed
Her foot dangles off the side, the toenails painted blood red
Jerry turns on a lamp to meet -- Sitting on the bed in a tank-top and a short skirt
As fetching as ever
You must be the groom
Jerry laughs
The guys were right
You're a looker
Did they also tell you  don't usually do this kind of thing
She pulls off the tank-top, revealing a black brassiere
All the better
like challenges
She crosses to face him
Getting married tomorrow, huh
Yes,  am
Love, honor, and obey
That's the drill, isn't it
Yes
Tomorrow,  take the vows
Without much ceremony, she starts massaging his crotch
Tomorrow
So, technically, this doesn't count
How's that
You can't break a vow you haven't taken, can you
You sound like my lawyer
Lorna kneels down before him
She unzips his pants
've done my share of lawyers
They spend most of the hour negotiating the tip
(beat) That's a joke
got it
She pulls down his pants, looks up at him
Something bothering you
don't know if  should be doing this
She starts to stroke him
Want my philosophy
If we don't make mistakes now and then, how are we ever going to learn from them
Now you sound like my priest
've done a few of them, too
Priests
Lousy tippers
They spend most of the hour feeling bad about what they're doing
But they do it anyway
Then, they shortchange you on the tip
One of them absolved me once, before he left
That's something,  guess
Who are the best tippers
The guys who can least afford it
Guys with families
And the worst
Hands-down
Politicians
Jerry reacts
Politicians
Sure
Both parties
don't discriminate
Besides, a penis doesn't know from politics
penis is the most politically incorrect part of the body
It has a simple agenda
(rehis erection) He knows what he wants
And she proceeds to give him a blow-job
Jerry guides her with his hands
He tries to relax
He tries
But he can't
He yanks her away from him
Stop it
can't do it
Don't worry about it
can't
'm sorry
Lorna instinctively puts a little distance between herself and Jerry
Hey, it's no sweat
get paid either way
No, you don't understand
can't fucking go through with it
(off Lorna's non-reaction) can't get married
All at once, his face fills with rage
Jerry swings his fist into the wall, punching a hole in it
Jesus
Adrenaline pumping, he doesn't even notice the blood on his hand
She shakes her head --  she's completely nonplussed
That was smart
Now, you're bleeding
Here
She takes him by the arm into-- -- She runs cold water over his hand -- it's really banged up
Then, she wraps a towel around it
Better
Yeah
Do you love her
don't know
'mon
Let's sit down
They return to-- -- Lorna and Jerry sit on the floor, their backs resting against the bed
Now the mood is intimate
She wants to have a baby
That's the way it's supposed to be, right
wouldn't know
My parents approve of her
Her parents approve of me
Everybody approves
What's wrong with a little approval
Jerry gives her a hard look
That's my whole life
My whole goddam carrot-and-stick-life
Ever since  can remember, 've been chasing after this person or that person's approval
Playing one role, then another
Then another
The good student
The good son
The industrious boy
Good grades
High ambitions
Pats on the back
Handshakes from people who matter
The good boyfriend, getting on his knees and proposing to the good girlfriend
The dutiful bachelor, receiving the traditional blow-job from a
Jerry stops himself
(lets him off the hook) Professional
've lost count of all the roles, there's so many of them
(beat) have no idea who 'm playing now
Huh
beat
don't see what the big deal is
play roles all the time
And you want to do that your entire life
You can't
you
(beat) don't even know your name
Lorna
And 'll do whatever the hell  want
Well,  can't live somebody else's version of my life anymore
Do you understand
Sure
do
She gets up and crosses to the window
Lifts it up
Here's your chance
What
It's not too far a drop to the lawn
You have gas in your car
Then, go
It's the first day of the rest of your life
Go
promise you, this opportunity will not come around twice
(beat) Go
Jerry stands
He looks out the window-- The suburbs at night
Cozy, warm-lit
'm going to do it
He smiles at Lorna
Then, he climbs out the window
' She watches him hit the ground, hobble across the lawn, and get into his car
And he's gone
-- See
Easy
She sits on the bed, takes in the room
It seems ordinary and strange, all at once
Lorna spots the bloody towel -- Jerry left it on the floor
She folds it neatly, concealing the blood
- Later
The wee hours
The only person at the counter is Lorna
She pours cream in her coffee, watches it swirl
Clouds
Something else catches her eye
' Behind the counter lies a crumpled newspaper
(to Waitress) Mind if  have that
It's yesterday's
Morning paper should be here any minute
just want the crossword puzzle
The Waitress puts the paper in front of her
It falls open to the Metro section, where Lorna sees a photo of Jerry and Rosalie -- the one Todd shot
The accompanying headline"Deputy Mayor's Son to Wed Tomorrow
" Oh my
The Waitress cranes her neck to see
There's a catch, alright
'  - Morning
Terri -- still under the covers -- studies the torn clipping from the paper
Lorna brushes her teeth
Hello
It's the oldest condition known to man
Cold feet
You're wrong
'm telling you he's two states away by now
(beat) He made a clean break
know it
Terri shakes her head
If you're wrong, you're paying for drinks tonight
- Lorna and Terri walk briskly down the sidewalk
They round a corner to see-- -- magnificent Catholic church
white limousine -- decorated with streamers -- sits in front, surrounded by expensive cars
Well, what do you know
Lorna can't believe it -- she almost feels betrayed
Told you we should've dressed up
'mon
we're going inside
What for
Wait
But Lorna is bounding toward the cathedral
- Lorna and Terri enter
The vestibule looks empty
Suddenly, they are startled by a
They turn to find a photographer checking a bulb -- it's Todd
Lorna, we shouldn't be here
Hearing her name Todd looks up
Then, he gathers his gear and starts inside
But Lorna intercepts him
Excuse me, could you tell me who's getting married in
(beat) Hey,  know you
The wedding guy
'm sorry
Have we met
Yeah
You don't remember me
You must be thinking of somebody else
Lorna reacts
Stops herself
Right
must be thinking of someone else
Sorry
Excuse me
And he disappears into the church
What was that all about
Nothing
Nothing, my ass
Alright, alright
slipped
Slipped
You broke the cardinal rule of the trade
(pedantic) Never acknowledge a client in public
What is this
Hooking For Dummies
'mon
Lorna grabs Terri by the wrist and slips into-- -- They take a seat in the last pew
' The front pews are packed, all eyes focussed on the wedding party at the altar
Jerry and Rosalie face the priest, who blesses the ring
The wedding ring is a powerful symbol
It is a circle, with no beginning and no end
It is also the circle that encloses your love for each other-- 'll bet that dress is Vera Wang
Shhh
Jerry and Rosalie turn to face each other
Do you, Rosalie, take this man, to have and to hold, in sickness and in health, till death do you part
do
And do you, Jerry, take this woman, to have and to hold, in sickness and in health, till death do you part
beat
Lorna studies Jerry's face for any sign, any hint of his real feelings
do
Then, by the power invested in me by Christ, Our Lord,  now pronounce you husband and wife
(to Jerry) You may kiss the bride
They kiss
Lorna leans forward
She's moved, despite herself
Terri looks over
You're crying,  can't believe it
No, 'm not
(beat) Weddings make me cry
The congregation applauds
Jerry shakes hands with the best man -- his Father
He gives his son an approving pat on the back
Suddenly, a   appears in Lorna's face
Ladies, this event is strictly for invited guests
We're with the groom's party
Ma'am
Let's not do this
You're not with the groom
Terri points to Lorna
She had his cock in her mouth last night
Doesn't that count
Lorna bursts out laughing
Laughing through her tears
The Guard is not amused
- Lorna and Terri race down the church steps, giggling like school girls
- They turn a corner, lean against a wall
Catching her breath, Terri lights a cigarette
don't know why he came back
(beat) It wasn't love
Guess you'll never know for sure
They start down the sidewalk-- Remember the guy  told you about -- the writer
Yeah
He said he wanted to immortalize you
What a line
He's been steady work
Every Tuesday for the past month
Well, get this
Yesterday, he called and asked me out
On a date
Yeah
date
non-paying date
No money will be exchanged
You want to hear the weird part
said yes
You're right
That is weird
You gotta keep an open mind, Lorna
(beat) You never know with people
They wait at the crosswalk
Lorna idly glances at the window of a brownstone apartment
Man finishing a cigarette
He catches Lorna looking his way
Woman comes up behind the Man and casually embraces him
The Man gives Lorna a last look before pulling the curtains closed
The light has changed
Terri starts walking
'mon, what are you waiting for
She lingers at the curb for a moment, pondering her next move
