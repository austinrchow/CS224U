He suddenly drops his hands to his side
The organist discontinues and the voices of the soloists trail off: Spruance, would you like to show me where it's marked smearing here
(hitting at the score) because  swear,  don't see it
Sorry

Also, 'd be mildly content if could have a little less delirious self-appreciation and some small regard for remaining somewhere in the vicinity of the goddamned note

While Joan grumbles to Helen, a late arriving member of the chorus ( ) can be seen taking his seat amongst the others: wasn't smearing
Sssh, come on now
No, 'm telling you, this is personally motivated
Since moved out he's been doing this, making remarks and being
incredibly pricklike
* Now, if our lovely soprano would like to stop grumbling for a moment, 'd like to take it once again
(under her breath) See what  mean
Pardon me
said fine, let's do it again

Discomforted by her flinty stare, he glances away, to the window where the faint sounds of the can be heard
feel like he's not plugged into my needs, and 'm not getting enough positive feedback
Harry shakes his head, shifting about uncomfortably
See, look at him shaking his head
Well, let's see what he wants to say here
Harry, how do you feel when she brings out this material
How do  feel
feel she just overheats on every little side issue, and when  go to try and communicate with the woman, for some unknown reason she doesn't believe a damn thing  say
Oh that's a lie

(to Therapist) See what she does
She wants to dig up and haul out miscellaneous things that's got nothing to do with this
mean,  agreed to come here, okay, but  have to tell you, Iwo Jima's got a lot of faulty notions in her head about me that
Alright, there
Right now
That's another thing  want to interject
Pardon me,  was making a statement here
Yes, let's try and hear each other out if we can
Go on, Harry
Well,  forgot the upshot of what was saying, but
Okay, this syndrome where 've asked him to address me by my given name and he just goes on ignoring my wishes
Alright
Look at him and really tell him how you feel about that
don't want you to ever call me Iwo Jima again
That's a legitimate request, isn't it
Harry begrudges a slight nod
If you can't call me Adele, don't call me anything at all

Can you look at Iwo Jima, Harry, and tell her
She darts a confused frown at the Therapist
Better yet, can you take her by the hand and say, ' hear what you're saying'
Reluctantly, he reaches over and takes her hand, mumbling something which though indistinct, causes Adele's features to pucker with emotion and brings her to the edge of tears
Good
That's good
because there's a lot of love here, isn't there

Pictures have been pulled from the walls, books have been swept from the shelves, chairs are upended and area rugs lie rumpled and dislocated

Her gaze moves to a bank of windows overlooking a garden patio

Dammit, you're making my work more difficult for me, you know that
What is this, have  come at the wrong time or something
tell you what the hell to do and you don't listen to me
Joan looks down at the floor, attempting a drollery: Well, someone abates your maidenhood and suddenly feels they can start ordering you around
'm not ordering you around
'm just giving you my opinion
And maybe  get tired of hearing about this stuff all the time, this book business, this manu-whatever, and Red Layls, and your sister
Oh
Well
(deeply hurt) 'm sorry if 've overtaxed you with my problems, Harry, but never asked you to consider them a part of your work

She disappears into the reception room and can be heard going out the door
Harry moves to the window, unhappily watching as Joan gets into the Mercedes and drives off
again seated at his desk
He stares out the window, in the throes of a moral conflict
Then making some sudden resolve he opens a drawer, takes out an envelope and a paperback book and lays them on the desk
The price sticker is still attached above the title: Dante's Divine Comedy - Simplified Edition
He opens the book, removes the Typhon voucher from between its pages and begins addressing the envelope with the information on the check
Then he puts the voucher into the envelope and seals it

He approaches a mailbox, pulls the handle on the letter drop and inserts his hand inside the chute
He holds it there a moment, seized by indecision, and then brings his hand back out, still holding the envelope
Turning around, he angrily stuffs it into his back pocket and heads back to the House of Bliss

Looking in the   direction   of Joan's gaze she sees the dark figure of a man   wearing a   hood over his head, stepping out from behind   the sheet   of plywood, holding the ax in his hand and as   he moves   toward the front of the car, she screams
He lifts the ax over his head and swings it down vio- lently, cleaving the blade into the hood of the Mercedes

She grabs one of Helen's crutches and raises it up as if to hit him
As he steps back to the ax and tries to extract it from the hood, she suddenly rushes at him and begins belaboring him with the crutch
He lifts an arm to fend off the blows while his other hand con- tinues to tug at the ax handle
Helen
Help me

Raising both arms to protect himself, the man is forced to give ground, moving further back into the garage, with Joan continuing to batter at him
Then in a sudden burst of rage he grabs hold of the crutch, yanks it from her grasp and lunges at her

They don't care

Just wait 'til he hears what 'm going to come out with now
Joan thrusts her skirt at Andy: Put this on
Remember when he passed me off as staff and  was put on official government payroll all through Maui and the Yucatan Mission
No,  don't
And hurry up, will you
And as Andy steps into the skirt, Joan takes over the uncompleted buttoning chores: Yes you do, remember, when almost died of the vomito negro
Well that's when he was doing all that illegal oil drilling off the Mexican Gulf

Ellerman, we'll be right back
Andy, wearing dark glasses and with her hair hidden up under the stingy-brim hat, steps out into the hallway

She hands him the skirt out through the window: You know what that prick had his lawyer say to me
Harry lays the skirt on the hood of the car and begins getting out of the doctor's jacket

Here, put this on

She sighs impatiently, then:                                     * Anyway,  if  remember correctly,                   * we only  kissed
But if that led you to  believe something that hurt you in  any way,  apologize

Somebody did
He returns his hand to the steering wheel
She looks at him, with a slight smile, waiting for him to elaborate, then: Well, am  supposed to guess, or are you going to
She breaks off, suddenly aware that the teeth marks are her own: Oh, Eddy

Eddy shifts into four-wheel
Joan, jostled about by the uneven surface beneath them, looks over at him: Why did you do these things
Because you deserved it
didn't deserve it
've always thought of you and treated you as one of my closest and dearest friends
use to think very highly of you, too, but now  don't like what see
In fact, it's been very disturbing to me, Joan
(pauses, then) Very disillusioning
To see that before you've even gotten rid of Lewie, you've started up with some other man
Eddy,  want you to take me home now

Harry gets out and looks up toward the taillights of Eddy's Jeep, disap- pearing in the hazy distance
He looks for a rock and finding one large enough, wedges it under one of the rear tires
Then he quickly gets back into the van

You never ask me about my  life or what 'm thinking, because  you have no interest
Yes  do
You can tell me whatever you want to, but let's go back down to
She breaks off as she catches sight of a knife held in his left hand
Creative things, and dreams, and feelings  have, that Lewie or anyone else in your life, are not capable of
She suddenly reaches frantically to the door handle and tries to get out
He grabs hold of her arm and pulls her back into the seat: (') See
You're not genuinely interested
You're not at all sincere, Joan
Eddy
You present yourself like you are, but you're not

The intensity and violence of their struggle is such that she is knocked further down the incline
Harry, quickly glances down the hill to see if she is alright and is left open to severe blow by Eddy, who breaks free and runs to his car
