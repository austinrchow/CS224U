- Written by Kate Angelo August 30th, 2007 - We're not exactly sure where we are
And we're not exactly sure who's talking
All we know is that we are looking at a foot
One bare foot with chipped red polish
(
) can't believe  didn't get a pedicure for this
How embarrassing
Look at that
The toes open and then curl down as if trying to hide
(
)(') What's wrong with me
If  were with a real guy doing this, would've gotten a pedicure
And a wax
'm pathetic
The   to the other foot, which is also chipped
(
) (') Fuck, that one's even worse
And when did my toes get so fat
No wonder 'm alone
'm a fat-toed animal
Zoe lets out a sigh
She speaks out-loud now
(') Sorry  didn't get a pedicure
What
(mid-fifties, jovial) looks up from between Zoe's knees, the light on his head flashing right in Zoe's eyes
My toes
sorry
'm not looking at your toes
Right
Duh
Dr
Harris stands and takes off his gloves
All done
2
That's it
And now, for the first time, we see
Despite the paper gown and worried look on her face, she's a late-30-something, girl-next-door type
She could be your best friend
'll elevate your legs for ten minutes and then you're good to go
He sets a kitchen timer and then pushes a button to raise her legs
We hear the loud   of the timer
This is the first time 've heard that ticking clock sound and it doesn't freak me out
Good
Just relax
can't, 'm totally freaking out
Everything's going to be great have a feeling you and
(checks empty syringe) Number -101404 are going to make beautiful babies together
Zoe smiles
Maybe he's right
Yeah
of course he's right
(
) Number -101404
Are you high
'  - : , 39 (but says he's 33,) gay and gorgeous, opens a file and points to a piece of paper
Says here he has red hair and freckles
And glasses, too
And why are we picking him
3
Because he's honest
He's ugly
Zoe points to a stack of potential donors
You think they're all telling the truth
If they're so smart and good looking, why are they beating off into a cup
Have you ever fucked a guy with red hair and freckles
No, and  won't have to
But what about your kid
No one's going to want to fuck your kid
(beat) That came out wrong
Yeah
it's a good thing you're not going to be the father
- : Bobby spits out a mouthful of Sauvignon Blanc
What
can't be the father
Come on, we don't have to have sex
Oh, Jesus,  didn't even think about that
Rewind, rewind, rewind
You're one of my best friends
Don't you want to help me
4
Yeah, but
that's too much
'll walk your dog, tell you when you look fat, be honest about your eyebrows
Just a few sperm
Big deal
You waste billions of them every night
You know  flee at the slightest chance of intimacy
Do you see these bags under my eyes
Ricardo slept over last night, and he wanted to hold me
actually had to fake a seizure
Forget it
Forget the whole thing
Zoe sighs and puts her head in her hands
(
) Forget the whole thing
It's just a phase
'  - :
Zoe and , Zoe's age but looks much older, sit at the kitchen table
You don't want kids
Trust me
Easy for you to say
You have four
Yeah, and it's awful
Three  run through the kitchen yelling and screaming
beat later, a  runs after them crying
(') They've ruined my life
Come on
5
Have you seen my vagina
Zoe shakes her head
(') Do you want to
Zoe shakes her head again
(') would do that for you
To prove to you that you don't want to have kids,  will show you my vagina
don't want to see your vagina want a baby
My own baby
Is it possible you're just a little lonely
You know, you haven't met the right guy and-- It's not about a guy
don't need a guy
don't even think  want a guy at this point
've dated a hundred guys in the last five years, and not one of them is even close to being the one
How long am  supposed to wait
You never know
He could be right around the corner
Well, then he's late
And  hate people who are late
And what if he's not right around the corner
What if he's miles away
Zoe shakes her head
She becomes very serious
(') want to have a baby
And time is running out
hear a clock ticking every time  close my eyes
need it to stop
We hear a loud
6
- Zoe opens her eyes
We're back in the exam room
She looks at the timer, which just hit zero
She smiles
Ding
Then a tear forms in the corner of her eye
She wipes it away
She wipes a tear from the other eye
Happy tears
Then she looks at her legs high above her on the table
(') How the fuck am  supposed to get down from here
'   - Zoe walks down the hall with her legs pressed firmly together, moving only from the knees down
Dr
Harris passes
You don't have to walk like that
Oh
Okay
Zoe separates her legs an inch
And then closes them
(') Should we hug
We might have just made a baby together
- Zoe walks through the waiting room with her legs still pressed together
She sees two  , touches her own stomach and smiles
She finally feels part of this exclusive baby club
Hi
Hi
- Zoe enters the elevator where there is a  holding a Zoe smiles at them
Another member of the club
7
Hi
Hi
The elevator descends
Zoe continues to stare at the baby with a big smile
She stares for an uncomfortably long time
(') You're starting to freak me out
Sorry
Zoe looks down
After a beat, she sneaks another look
Stop it
- It's  outside
The kind of rain that turns umbrellas inside out
run for cover with newspapers over their heads
Despite the rain, Zoe skips out of the building with her hands in the air and twirls around
Realizing that she's spread her legs too far apart, she snaps them back together
pushing a baby stroller covered in plastic runs by
Hi
Zoe looks uptown for a cab
Nope
Nothing
She starts to walk, still keeping her legs firmly pressed together
She rounds the corner towards the subway station and then, miraculously, spies a cab
(') Taxi
She runs (little steps) across the street
- Zoe closes the door behind her
Hallelujah
8
As soon as the word comes out of her mouth, she notices someone entering the cab from the other side
This is , early 40s, but looks more like a college kid -- faded jeans, t-shirt, cute, messy hair
(') Uh
excuse me
This is my cab
You own it
No, but 'm about to rent it
Actually, if we're being technical, you kind of stole it
don't think so
If you see someone about to get in a cab, you can't just run in from the other side and say it's yours
didn't see you
saw you see me
(to the cabbie) Sir, who saw you first
The  picks up his paper and starts to read
Maybe you're not from around here, but there's a code
It's like war, even though it's brutal and bloody, there are still certain rules we-- Fine
Forget it
'll get out
Zoe grabs the door handle and then turns back
(') But not because you're right, but because  am in a terrific mood, and you are ruining it
9
No
'll get out
They each get out
- Zoe and Stan stand on opposite sides of the taxi in the Zoe crosses her arms
Now what
don't know
You tell me
That question is answered by the cabbie, who now peels out
What
Where's he going
(waving her hands, then) Come back
They both stand there with a taxi's width between them
(') Well, that was stupid
Why'd you get out, you, stupid-head
You said you were in a great mood and  was ruining it
felt bad
(then) Did you just call me stupid-head
Zoe storms off with her little steps
68TH    - Stan and Zoe each swipe their Metrocards at the same time
They enter the subway platform which is jam packed with all the other   who are shit-out-of-luck in the cab department
Rain droplets drip from the ceiling above
Oh, man
How's your great mood now
10
6  - packed subway car
Zoe and Stan are back-to-back, pushed together by the crowd
Zoe tries to read her paper
How `bout now
Please stop talking to me
- Zoe and Stan walk up the stairs a few feet apart from each other
Zoe does her best to ignore the obvious
So, why are you in such a good mood anyway
They reach the top of the stairs
The rain has stopped, and the sun is just starting to peek through
Everything is wet and has a magical quality
Not that it's any of your business, but
good things are happening to me
Stan is moved by this
What a thing to say
That's nice
hope it continues
Thanks
Well, have a nice life
Try not to steal any more cabs
You do the same
They nod and separate
- Hudson Pets is a small but quaint West Village pet store filled with dogs, cats and a few rabbits
Zoe enters
Her dog, , a raggedy, pug-like dog with hind legs in a , bounds/wheels towards her, barking
11
Hey, Nutsy
How's it going
She gives Nuts a good scratch
, mid-30s, Latina hottie, and Bobby run from the back
Oh, my God, you're glowing
(to Jalisa) She's glowing, right
Glowing
Tell us everything
Everything
There's not much to tell
You just got shot up with a wad of red-headed-freckle sperm
There's something to tell
He had red hair and freckles
tried to talk her out of it
Why'd you do that, Mami
(to Jalisa) know, right
Red pubes
Eek
'm never going to see his pubes
You'll see your kid's pubes
doubt it
But you'll know they're there
12
What is wrong with you
So, what happened
Come on
lay down, put my feet up, five minutes later it was over barely felt a thing
Sounds like Ricardo
Tell me about it, Papi
Bobby and Jalisa high five
Bobby then turns to Zoe
So
what happens now
Now, we wait
That's no fun,  want to know if 'm going to be a fairy godmother
We'll just have to wait and see
Zoe smiles and heads for the back
- The lights in the pet store go dark
Moments later, Zoe, Bobby, Jalisa and Nuts exit
Come on, Zoe, one drink
You can have an 'Dhouls or something
We'll go to the piano bar and get Bobby to sing some Ace of Base
Forget it, she's not coming
can tell by the dull look on her face
Love you
13
They all hug
Bobby and Jalisa walk away arm-in-arm, singing
/ saw the sign and it opened up my eyes,  saw the sign
Zoe turns to lock up
While her back is turned, Stan appears from the shadows
Hi
Aahhh
Zoe screams and drops the keys
Nuts, overexcited by Zoe's reaction, starts to run/wheel in circles and then tips over
(') You scared the hell out of me
Oh, wow
Is he
okay
Nuts is still on the ground, his wheels spinning
Zoe sets him upright
What are you doing here
'm sorry
didn't mean to scare you
Or hurt your dog
Don't worry, 'm not a stalker
How'd you know  worked here
followed you after the subway
(thinks, then) That sounds a little stalkery, huh
Yeah
just really wanted to see you again
Almost like  had to see you again
Can  walk you home
(then) Is it me or does everything  say make me sound more like a stalker
14
Zoe allows a small smile
(') Can  just give you my card
Here
Take my card
'm not a freak
Really
sell cheese
This hangs out there for a beat
Cheese
Yeah
My family has a goat farm
We make cheese
You like cheese
guess
've never really thought about it
Little Goat
Maybe you've seen us at the Farmer's market
Come by sometime and you can taste my cheese
(then) Okay, 'm going to go
This has not gone as planned
Stan smiles meekly and then turns to go
Bye
Stan lifts his hand to wave but doesn't even turn around
Clearly, he feels like an idiot
Zoe watches him go
- Establishing shot of a cute brownstone with window boxes and a front stoop
We   to the third floor window
'  - Zoe is asleep with the morning sun on her face
Nuts is beside her, his two little, lame legs hanging off the pillow
Zoe opens her eyes
After a beat, she gets up and walks to the mirror
She lifts up her pajama top and looks at her stomach, sticking it out as far as it will go
It's flat as a board
15
'  - Seven  sit around the cramped living room of this small, East Village apartment
At least one woman is nursing a child that looks entirely too old to still be nursing
This is the     Support Group
, 40's, short hair, tank top and no bra, is the leader
Everyone, please say hello to Zoe
Hi, Zoe
Welcome to Single Mother's By Choice
As the name suggests, we are all single mothers by choice
Some of us have adopted, some conceived with a donor, every story is different, but with the same common denominator
We wanted to have a child, and we didn't need a partner to make it happen
The women smile and nod
They are a proud, no-nonsense, somewhat masculine bunch
, pregnant with a buzz cut, turns to Zoe
Are you a doer or a tryer
Excuse me
Are you already a single mother or are you trying to become one
Oh,  guess 'm trying
was just inseminated a few days ago
(then) Inseminated
makes me feel like a cow or something
Well, when we don't have partners with penises, we do what we've got to do, right
(then) So, tell us a little bit about yourself
16
Okay
Let's see
um,  own a pet store on Hudson Street
Dogs, cats, rabbits
no birds, they creep me out
Before that, worked for Google, which completely hated
One day, decided life was too short, and, against my accountant's advice, quit Google, cashed out and bought the pet store
Now 'm really happy on the work front, but still haven't found, you know, the one
Ah, yes
The elusive "one
" always imagined 'd be married with kids by now, but it doesn't look like it's going to happen that way
So, time for Plan
Society tells us we're supposed to find that special person to make us happy and complete
But guess what
you have to create your own happiness
You don't need someone to complete you, some
man
You already are complete
Amen, sister
If you want to have a baby, we here at Single Mothers By Choice can be your partners
We will be your emotional rocks
Zoe looks around at her new "partners
" There's , the one nursing the toddler
And , a tall women with an even taller afro and a nose ring
, a young girl covered in tatoos
And several more
(') From inception to college graduation and everything in between
We're here for each other
Sara smiles and nods at her nursing child
17
Dakota was actually born right here in this very room
Right where you're sitting, actually
(uncomfortable) Really
Right here
Imagine that
Best day of my life
And how old is she now
Dakota looks up from the breast
'm three
- Zoe and Mona are sitting by the window sharing a plate of pastries and a pot of coffee
Why did you join a support group of unattractive, militant lesbians when you have me
Because you're really not that supportive
Sure  am
You just told me that if  breast- feed "my girls" will end up looking like empty tube socks
'm just being honest
And don't even get me started on what childbirth does to your bladder
What does it do to your bladder
Mona cracks up and then stops abruptly
18
just peed a little bit
don't think 'm pregnant
The doctor says it will probably take several tries
Something about frozen sperm being lazy
Good
Take your time
Zoe takes a sip of coffee and looks out the window
So, should  call this guy
Do you think that would be weird
Do  think it's weird that you're pursuing someone at the exact moment in time that you might be most unavailable
No
Because that's what you do
You sabotage
(ignoring her) He works at the Farmer's market
And it's right around the corner
Are you thinking what 'm thinking
look fat and old
No
Then, no
Let's go spy on him
Come on
It will be fun
Like high school
can't
(checks watch) This twenty minute breakfast concludes my "me" time for the week
More proof that you should not have kids
19
'  - The Farmer's Market is crowded with people
We hear the sounds of a bluegrass band playing somewhere nearby
Zoe spies the   sign
But Stan is not there
She looks around the neighboring stalls for him, but no luck
Oh, well
She walks towards 14th street
We see the bluegrass band on the steps by the subway station
It's not a big band, just a few guys with an open banjo case and a sign that reads, "The Organics
" The country twang of the music is in sharp contrast with the tall buildings all around
As she gets closer, she notices that Stan is in the band
He's playing banjo
Zoe quickly ducks into the nearest food stall, ' , mid-twenties, natural beauty, approaches
Can  help you
(distracted) No, 'm fine
Zoe watches Stan
She mindlessly starts eating some blueberries out of the display pint
Olivia sees that Zoe is looking at Stan
Tasty, huh
Zoe nods and takes another berry
(') All ripe and juicy
And firm, too
Bet you could just eat him up in one bite, right
Zoe now turns, confused
What
And don't look now, but he's coming this way
20
Olivia winks and moves off
Zoe turns back and is now face- to-face with Stan, who's smiling from ear-to-ear, his banjo slung over his shoulder
-ha
didn't scare you away after all
(trying to be casual) was just in the neighborhood thought 'd come by and get some blueberries
'm going to make a pie
love blueberry pie
Stan takes two pints of blueberries and hands them to Zoe
'm confused
thought you made cheese or something
What makes you think  don't
don't know, you're over there playing the banjo
Can't someone do both
Honestly,  didn't know anyone did either
Olivia returns
Aren't you going to introduce me to your new friend
Nope
(to Zoe) Come on
Let me show you around
Stan puts his arm around Zoe and leads her away
Olivia watches them go with her arms crossed
21
- Stan walks Zoe through his cheese stand
This is our basic chevre, probably our best seller
The cheese that started it all, as they say
Then over here we have our surface- ripened cheeses
These are the aged/raw milk cheeses
(realizing) This is really boring, huh
No, not at all
It's like you're in a foreign country and the only thing to watch on tv is a documentary on cheese
You don't want to watch it, but somehow you can't stop
(laughing) think it's interesting
Really
All right, you asked for it
(boring voice) The aged/raw milk cheeses are made from raw milk and then aged for four to six months
Sometimes more
Sometimes less
Usually more
Depends on the cheese
Stop
You're killing me
, early twenties, white guy with Rasta-type dreads, looks up from behind the counter
Fred, Zoe, Zoe, Fred
(then) She's the one  followed from the subway the other day like a total psychopath
Right
heard about you
22
don't know whether to be flattered or terrified
Be afraid
Don't scare her away
'm trying to redeem myself
Then you should put down the banjo
You look like a doofus
Doofus
(then, to Zoe) Do you think  look like a doofus
don't really know what a doofus looks like
Fred points to Stan
Okay
If  put the banjo down, can take you to lunch or something
should really get back to work
Come on, say the word and we can have a six-course tasting menu at Union Square Cafe
know the chef
That sounds nice, but,  should probably go
Well, can  call you
Zoe smiles
- Zoe enters the pet store with two big bags of vegetables
As soon as she steps foot in the store, Bobby and Jalisa accost her
23
Okay, spill it
Who is he
What does he do
How do we know him
What are you talking about
Stan from the Farmer's Market
He's called twice already
Really
Is he a farmer
Because that's not okay
No
He makes cheese
He's a pilgrim
don't know what he is
He's cute and different and plays the banjo
(then) think  like him
What about the, you know, bun in the oven
really doubt 'm pregnant
You want to be pregnant
You don't want to be pregnant
'm confused
want to be pregnant
Of course want to be pregnant
mean,  put a lot of thought into this, right
(then) So what did Stan say
He says to name any restaurant you want to go to
() 24
(') He'll be there with bells on
(then) He didn't say the "bells on" part
added that
Sounds a little too gay, though, so  take it back
8TH  - Zoe walks down 8th street
This is the first time we've seen her really pulled together, and she looks hot
She turns into the restaurant she's chosen for the big date
'    - Zoe and Stan stand at the counter with an array of hot dogs in front of them
Stan looks at the hot dogs skeptically
We could have gone anywhere
Just take a bite
You'll see
Per Se, Jean Georges, Nobu
Gray's Papaya
Cheers
She clinks his dog and then they each take a bite
(') Good, right
Stan nods, covering his mouth because the bite is so big
(') You've lived here your whole life and never been to Gray's Papaya
What's wrong with you
actually haven't lived here my whole life
We moved out of the city when my parents bought the farm
not died, but actually bought a farm and moved upstate
That must have been a nice place to grow up
On a farm
25
What about your family
It's just me and my grandmother
She lives in a retirement community in Queens
(an awkward beat) My parents died when  was young
'm so sorry
There is a long silence
They both stare at the hot dogs
(') don't know what to say now
've made it all awkward and sad
It's okay
(then) My dad was kind of a bad guy, anyway
Shit
'm so sorry, Zoe
No, come on, we'll get all this stuff out of the way so we never have to talk about it again
Let's ask all the awkward, get-to-know- you questions right now
Okay
Good idea
Let's see
are you religious
Nope
What about you
No
Have you ever been married
No
26
Aren't you sick of going to weddings
If  have to listen to one more couple write their own vows
hate when they write their own vows
They clasp hands
Not in a high-fivey way, but in a connected, we have so much in common way
Their hands stay together, feeling the charge between them
(') What about kids
Zoe feels the blood rush to her cheeks
Like everyone there must now be looking at her
What about them
Well, do you want them
Yeah
want kids
She pulls her hand away
This has all gotten suddenly real
She looks at Stan, almost afraid to ask the next question
(') Do you
Yeah
Absolutely
Zoe nods
Slowly, she starts to breathe again
- They are now walking home together, arm-in-arm
Okay, first kiss
Jen Salzer
Seventh grade
She wore a head-gear
What about you
27
Summer camp
think his name was-- Stan interrupts by kissing her
And it's a great kiss
Full of promises and answers
They linger there for a moment
(') That was way better
When can  see you again
Zoe feels her heart jump
She kisses him again
'  - Zoe is lying in bed with Nuts on the pillow next to her
The sun is shining and they are both waking up
She gets up and goes to the mirror
She lifts up her nightgown and looks at her stomach, this time with a slight look of concern on her face
- Zoe and Mona are side-by-side on the elliptical machines
Zoe is going very fast, while Mona is barely moving at all
What if 'm pregnant
Then you'll get fat and hormonal and 'll say, " told you so
" But what if this could go somewhere with Stan
Like, really go somewhere
Then it will work out perfectly
What do you mean
Because just when you really like him, you'll break up because you're pregnant and then you never have to put yourself out there and possibly get hurt
That's your dream
28
(thinks, then) 'm not pregnant
She gets off the machine
- We are in a foggy steam room with Zoe, Mona and a few other So, when are you seeing him again
Tonight
Well, don't have sex with him
That's the last thing we need
You get knocked up and we'll have no idea who the father is
few women look over
(') And then we'll have to do a paternity test
Is it the cheese farmer or the red-pubed bandit
More women look over
'm not going to have sex with him tonight
It's too soon
(for the women's benefit) 'm not a slut
Well, bring condoms, just in case
(thinks, then) And a pregnancy test
Very funny
'm not joking
All of the women are now staring at Zoe
'm really not a slut
29
'  - Zoe sits on the bed, holding a pregnancy test in her hands
Nuts is beside her
He looks up at her
There's no way, right
'  - Zoe pees on the stick
Nuts is beside her, watching with his head tilted
Stop looking at me like that
'm not pregnant
Zoe finishes peeing and looks at the test
Nothing yet
(') Come on, come on, come on
We hear the doorbell
(') Shit
Zoe looks down at the test
Still nothing
We wait and watch the test
The doorbell  again
(') Shit
faint   is forming
(') Shitshitshitshit
The plus sign then turns
Zoe's heart stops
There it is
Plain as day
Pregnant
(') No, shit
Zoe stands
Looks at herself in the mirror
And then
(') Holy fucking shit
30
- Manhattan fades into the distance, as they drive over the Brooklyn Bridge
Zoe cracks the window
Are you feeling okay
Zoe nods
Her face looks pale
(') Good, because this should really be a culinary adventure
This is an underground restaurant that moves from apartment to apartment, depending on the chef
Zoe nods again
Hasn't heard a word he's said
She rolls the window all the way down and hangs her head out
(') And some of the guys from the band will be there
So, we might get a little jam going
Sounds fun, right
(then) Zoe
Zoe's
Headlights from passing cars whiz by, and the wind swirls her hair into her face
Brooklyn approaches like a bad dream
/  - Stan walks down a long table filled with appetizers
He is making a plate for each of them
Zoe trails behind, beads of sweat on her forehead
And this looks like a mache salad with grapes and feta
He takes some for each of them
(') And this, oh this must be white beans and lamb's tongue
You've got to have some of this
Etienne is famous for his lamb's tongue
Olivia approaches
31
Hey, stranger
Oh, hey, Olivia
You remember Zoe
Right
How'd that blueberry pie turn out
What
You bought blueberries from me
Said you were going to make a pie
Um, can you excuse me for a second
Zoe hurries off
Olivia watches her go
Eyes narrowing
No way she knows how to bake a pie
/  - Zoe hovers by the window, whispering into the phone
'm pregnant
(
) What
Where are you
'm on my way
Brooklyn
(
) Where's that
Zoe hangs up the phone
/  - Zoe is now on the phone with Mona
(
) Don't panic
Could be a false positive
Take another test
32
can't
'm at some underground foodie party in Brooklyn
Where am gonna-- Out the window and across the street, we see a drugstore
- Zoe runs down the aisle and empties one, two, three
what the fuck, every pregnancy test into her basket
Her cell phone
It's Bobby
She picks it up
(
) Okay, 'm looking at a subway map
Which way is Brooklyn
She hangs up again
/  - Zoe hurries through the living room, a packed drugstore bag hidden under her arm
Stan comes up behind her
Where have you been
Zoe jumps and accidentally drops the bag
The tests spill out onto the floor
She quickly scoops everything back in
Sorry
You scared me
Did you just go to the store
Yeah,  had a little emergency have a, a, um
corn, and  needed to get those little
corn pads
Corn pads
know, it's gross
Do you know where the bathroom is
Zoe walks off leaving him to ponder
33
What's a corn pad
- Zoe pees on eight sticks at once
Corn pad
What the hell is wrong with you
Someone  on the door
(') Corn pad
Jesus Christ
The knocking turns to an angry
(') Relax
'll be out in
(checks box) Three to five minutes
Zoe holds up the tests
One by one, the little windows all show   and   and
/  - Zoe exits the bathroom with a wide-eyed, terrified look on her face
By the bar, she sees a   sipping a glass of wine
She rushes over
Excuse me, are you allowed to drink when you're
Zoe makes hand motions at her belly, but can't say the word
(') You know
More hand gestures
Pregnant
(off Zoe's nod) My doctor says one glass is-- Zoe doesn't wait for her to finish
She rushes the bar, pours a glass of wine and downs it like a frat boy funneling a beer
34
Outside, we hear a banjo and guitar tuning up
- Stan,  and  are just starting to play
small crowd gathers round
Stan starts to sing an old tune called "Sweet Little Miss Blue Eyes
" Who makes me forget all the other girls  met, sweet, little Miss Blue Eyes
Who's sweeter to me, than she really ought to be, sweet little Miss Blue Eyes
Zoe appears at the door to the patio
Stan smiles at her while he sings
(') Who's gonna start takin' care of my heart, she makes me realize
And it's lucky for me and  really want to be with
(winks at Zoe) sweet, little Miss-- Stan's  as Zoe covers her mouth with two hands and bolts for the bathroom, puking
(') Blue eyes
- Zoe's head is in the toilet
Just when we think she's done, she pukes again
Finally, she lifts her head
Ohhhhhhhh
She spies an unused pregnancy test on the floor
One that must have dropped
Maybe this will be the one with the answer she's looking for
She sits back on the toilet, mustering up all of her focus to pee again
She closes her eyes
(') Please, God
But she can't pee
She tries and tries
35
(') Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to
She doubles over and pukes between her knees
When she's done, she holds up the test
of the stick, which has no pee on it but is covered in vomit
Slowly the test reveals a
(') Fuck me
- Stan and Zoe walk towards Zoe's brownstone
Stan is practically holding her up
Zoe stumbles along
My singing made you vomit
No
It's not that
Sure, we were a little out of tune, but
really don't feel well
Is it your corns
Hurts to walk
on Carol, from Single Mother's By Choice, approaching
Zoe's face pales
Zoe
Wow
Hi
Hey, there
Where have you been
You haven't been coming to any-- (cutting her off) Right
know
've been so busy
Next one, 'm there
For sure
(then, awkward) This is my friend, Stan
36
Hi
(eyeing Stan suspiciously) Hello
Are you two-- Late
Yes
We are
We really are
(pushing Stan along) 'll see you at the meeting
Bye
They walk on
Stan looks at Zoe
An old
boyfriend
Her name is Carol
We're on a
committee together
They reach Zoe's front stoop
Zoe peers over Stan's shoulder to make sure Carol's gone
(') All right
have to go to bed now
'll call you, okay
Okay
(then) Hey,  was thinking, if you don't have any plans this weekend, maybe you'd like to come up to the farm and get away for a few days
'll call you tomorrow
Something's not agreeing with me
Was it the lamb's tongue
Zoe runs inside holding her hand over her mouth
Stan stands there for a beat
He calls after her
(') Okay, well
this weekend
Think about it
37
'  - Zoe lies in bed
Nuts sleeps beside her
Zoe stares out the window at a flickering street lamp, her face full of fear
What the hell have  done
- Establishing shot of a retirement compound in Queens
- The lobby is well-appointed and cheery
young  works behind a front desk area
Were it not for a scattering of , you might think we were at a Ramada
Zoe walks by the front desk
, an employee, looks up
Hi, Zoe
You look fantastic
don't know how that's possible
Something's different
Did you get highlights or a spray tan
Your face looks like it's
Please don't say glowing
Yes
Exactly
- There is a small group of  speed walking around the courtyard
They are fully decked out in jogging suits, visors and nose shields
The ringleader is , 83, fit and fabulous
On the sidelines is , 87, with his walker and big grin, as he watches the ladies exercise
Morning, Arthur
38
Hello, my dear
He struggles to get up
No, no, no, don't get up
Good, because  can't get up
Came to see my lovely fiance
She's looking fine today, let me tell you
Fine
Nana rounds the bend and waves enthusiastically
Hi, Nana
One more mile to go
Do you have a minute
Talk to Arthur
Zoe looks at Arthur who's now watching Nana's ass, nodding
That's what 'm talking about
Work it
Horrified, Zoe quickly runs after Nana
- Zoe is now speed walking with the ladies
She mimics the same strong arm movements and heel-toe foot action
Do you want a nose guard
have an extra
No, 'm fine
Are you sure
Ethel Silverbeck just had another carcinoma removed from her nose
(to Nana) kind of need to talk to you
Alone
39
Nana gives her friends a nod, and they fall back several paces
Zoe waits for them to be out of earshot
Don't worry, they can't hear anything anyway
'm pregnant
(can't hear her) What
'm pregnant
What
'm pregnant
can't hear you, darling
Jesus, Judy, she's pregnant
Turn your hearing aide up
Zoe closes her eyes
Nightmare
'  - Nana hands Zoe a cup of tea
Zoe's eyes well with tears
What am  going to do
'm confused
Isn't this what you wanted
You bought sperm and were inseminated by your doctor
This isn't what we would call an accident
But now it's all happening so fast
Did  really think this through
40
We talked about it for months
You said it was what you wanted more than anything in the world
But this guy, he's
special
It's all going to fall apart now
What makes him so special
don't know
He's very
real
And funny
And different
The other guys 've been with all had their briefcases and their five- year plans and their secretaries they were fucking
Stan doesn't have a five-year plan
don't even know if he has a plan
What about a secretary
Some kid named Fred
(then) like him, Nana
Well, if he's the right one, he'll stay
Do you really think so
Gosh,  don't know
hoped that would be enough to appease you
Should  still visit him for the weekend
Or should  just vanish and hope he forgets  ever existed
Don't be silly
Go up there for the weekend
Spend some time with him and see what he's really like
Yeah
You're right
41
You might find out he's a total douchebag and then the whole thing is moot
Zoe looks at Nana
Douchebag
- Zoe is in the car
We are  on her as she talks rapidly and a bit maniacally
Okay, so we'll just hope that he's a douchebag
Could happen, right
to reveal Nuts in the passenger seat
He's yawning
(') 'm sorry
Am  keeping you up
Nuts closes his eyes and lays down
(') My whole life is falling apart and you can't keep your bug-eyes open
(yawning) Thanks
Now 'm yawning
But why am  so tired
slept nine hours
(thinks, then) And 'm starving, too
What the hell is going on
Zoe sees a gas station and jams on the breaks
- Zoe pours a massive cup of coffee
One of those gas station Big Gulp cups
Even the  next to her chooses a smaller cup
Then, a look crosses her face
Am  even allowed to drink coffee
The trucker looks at her
She looks at him
(') Do you know anything about being pregnant
42
- Zoe's car is now parked on the side of a highway in the middle of nowhere
- Zoe is sound asleep with her head back and her mouth open small, empty coffee cup in her hand, crumpled candy bar wrappers on the floor, and an almost empty bag of Cheetos is in her lap
Her cell phone
Zoe doesn't move
After the third ring, she lifts her head and looks around
It takes her a few moments to realize what's happened
She looks at the little coffee cup
Thanks a lot, decaf
She picks up the phone
(
) Where are you
Zoe looks around
have no idea
- Zoe bumps along the winding driveway of this idyllic Hudson River farm
There are red barns in the distance and green pastures filled with goats and sheep
The house is an old carriage house with a rusty weather-vane on top
Zoe parks the car and takes in the whole scene
Stan opens the front door, with a huge smile on his face
Zoe sighs
He's so not a douchebag
- They enter the front door
Zoe takes in the charming carriage house
can't believe you live here
This is ridiculous
43
just come on weekends
My parents really live here
Oh
Where are they now
In the kitchen
Zoe stops short
Wait, they're here
Now
Is this a "meet the parents" kind of thing
wasn't prepared for this
No
Not at all
mean, you'll meet them, but-- When you said come up for the weekend,  assumed it was just us
(then) think  need to lay down
'  - Zoe lies in the small bed with the covers pulled up to her chin
Stan stands above her with an odd look on his face
Are you hung-over or something
'm just
not myself
Give me ten minutes
ten-minute power nap and 'm good
need to regroup
Are you sure you're okay
(then) Zoe
Hello
But she's already out
Stan gives her a little poke
- Stan enters the kitchen
His parents,  and  look up expectantly, as if about to meet their new daughter-in- law
44
Oh
It's just you
She's taking a nap
nap
Now
She just got here
Mom,  need you to not be judgemental, okay
like this girl a lot
How can  be judgemental
We haven't even met her yet
We hear a , ,  coming down the hall
(') What the heck is that
The  continues and then all eyes turn as Nuts rolls into the kitchen and stops
He tilts his head
Oh
This is Nuts
Joan and Edward take in the raggedy/wheelchair-bound dog and then look at Stan
Stan shoots his mom a look
Who's judging
'  - It's now dark
Zoe is asleep in the exact same position
Suddenly, we hear a loud
Her eyes open
What was that
We hear the  again
It's her stomach
She puts her hands over it
(') Whoa
Zoe gets out of bed and goes right for the Cheetos
The bag is empty
She smears her hand on the inside of the bag and then licks the orange cheese from her fingers
45
- Zoe peeks out of the bedroom and looks both ways
(whispering) Stan
No one in sight
She waits a beat and then whispers louder
(') Stan
- Zoe peers her head into the empty kitchen
Nuts is with her
Stan
Hello
Zoe stands there unsure of what to do next
Then we hear her stomach  again
Her eyes turn to the stove
Something smells out of this world
She tiptoes over and opens the pot
It's beef stew
(') Oh, my God
She makes sure the coast is clear and then looks for a spoon
She can't find one
She spies a loaf of white bread
Grabs a piece, folds it and then scoops up a heaping bite of stew and devours it
(') (mouth full) Oh, my God
She replaces the lid on the pot
And now she just stands there
And stands there some more
(') Oh, who am  kidding
She quickly takes two slices of bread and goes back in
This time, she uses one piece of bread as a ladle and then the other to turn it into a sandwich
She takes a huge bite
(') Oh
My
God
Stew dribbles down her chin
She takes a third piece of bread to wipe her face and then takes a bite of that one
46
Nuts starts to whine and beg
Zoe uses her bread-ladle to toss some stew on the floor for him
It lands with plop
And now Joan enters
Zoe and Nuts turn, their mouths bursting
Joan doesn't quite know what to do
All she knows is she's supposed to be open-minded
Would you like a plate
Zoe shakes her head no
Wow
This is embarrassing
(') napkin
Zoe nods her head
Joan gives her one
Zoe holds it over her mouth as she tries in vain to swallow this inhuman bite
(') 'm Joan
Zoe nods
Still can't swallow the bite
(') And you must be Zoe
Zoe nods again
She tries to shake Joan's hand
It's the best she can do
Unfortunately, her fingers are fluorescent orange from the Cheetos powder
Joan pulls her hand back
- The dining room is warm and lovely
There's faded wallpaper and an old stagecoach lamp serving as a chandelier
Despite the inviting room, Zoe looks very uncomfortable
The stew is delicious, honey
Yeah, Mom, it's awesome
(to Zoe) Have you ever in your life had stew like this
Come on, be honest
Zoe looks at Joan
Joan smiles
It will be their secret
Uh
no
Never
47
- They are having coffee and dessert in the living room
Things seem more comfortable now
Zoe actually looks like she might be enjoying herself
Nuts sits beside her
So are all the animals in your pet store
differently abled
Oh, you can say paralyzed
He doesn't mind
(then) No, our pets are all in great shape
Purebreads mostly, but not from puppy mills
Those puppy mills are terrible read about them in the paper
Well, that's actually how  ended up with Nuts
bought him from this pet store near my house
Six months later,  had thousands of dollars in vet bills and had to put him in a wheelchair
You should have sued that place
thought about it, but what was that really going to do
They were still going to sell inbred dogs
So
took the money  made when left Google and just bought the place figuring  would do better
You worked for Google
Zoe nods
(') How could  not know that
You never asked
48
And you made a lot of money and then bought a pet store
Stan puts his arm around her and gives her a squeeze
(') love that
It's been fun
Beats brand management, that's for sure
(to Edward) That sounds like us, honey
It's true
(to Zoe) When we bought this farm we just wanted to make cheese because we couldn't find anything we liked in the stores
And now, twenty years later, here we are
Sometimes in life you just have to take matters into your own hands
Make things happen your own way, you know
Zoe forces a smile
If only they knew
- The moon is full and fireflies dot the air as Zoe and Stan walk the grounds of the farm
Nuts trots/rolls ahead of them in a different wheelchair
This one is more rugged, with mountain-bike-type wheels
can't believe that Nuts has an off-road wheelchair
He's got one for snow, too
With little skis on the bottom
Stan smiles and shakes his head
49
(') What
You're really something
Are you making fun of me
Do you think  spoil him
No,  really think you're amazing
mean, that story you told tonight
You just quit your whole professional life because of this little dog
Started your own business, just like that
Zoe shrugs
(') You're very
unique
Well, you're a dime a dozen can't tell you how many banjo playing, cheese makers 've been with
keep waiting for the other shoe to drop
Like, how can you be so perfect
Why are you even still single
can't believe no one's snatched you up by now
drive them all away,  guess
Yeah, right
Stan takes her in his arms
(') Look,  know this is all going fast
the time we're spending together, meeting my parents and everything
but, 'm okay with that
want it to go fast
It is going fast
50
But isn't that okay
Aren't we old enough to skip all the bullshit
What are we waiting for
want to be with you
Zoe opens her mouth
She's got to tell him
Before this goes any further, she has to tell him
Stan
Come on
There's something  want to show you
- It's floor to ceiling wooden shelves all filled with cheese
Stan ceremoniously unwraps a wheel
What is it
It's cheese
can see that
It's a new kind of goat's milk we're using
've been developing the recipe, and now it needs to age
It'll be ready for market in several months
(then, excited) Want to know what it's called
Okay
Zoe
You named a piece of cheese after me
Not just one piece
The whole line
This will forever in history be known as the Zoe
() 51
(') Unless, of course, it tastes like shit, and then we'll just scrap it
(with a wink) But that'll never happen
How do you know
Because it's going to be fantastic
Sweet and sassy and very complex
Why do you think 'm calling it Zoe
No one's ever named a piece of cheese after me before
Zoe stares at the cheese for a long time
You're kind of hard to read right now
You're either seriously flattered or totally repulsed
Zoe smiles
(') What
want to kiss you right now, but it really smells like cheese in here
- The door to the dairy kicks open and Stan carries Zoe out
Her legs are around his waist and they are making out like crazy
- Stan carries Zoe up the stairs
They are tripping and kissing and now tearing at each other's clothes
'  - Stan throws Zoe on the bed and then peels off his shirt
His body looks amazing in the shadowy moonlight
Zoe lies there, looking at him before he jumps on top of her
52
(under her breath) You're such a douchebag
What
Zoe shakes her head and then melts into him
: '  - They are now on their backs staring at the ceiling
They look happy and worn out Their
Those little glow-in-the-dark star stickers are all over the ceiling
There's barely any glow left
Stan lets out a big sigh as he looks at the "stars"
That was amazing
mean, like, totally and exceptionally, over-the- top, amazing
Zoe turns to him
Takes a deep breath
Stan
Yeah
There's something  really have to tell you
There's something  have to tell you, too
Now Stan turns to her
They are face-to-face
(') Can  go first
`Cause if we're going to say the same thing,  want to say it first
We're not going to say the same thing
53
Well, let me go, because this is really embarrassing, and  just have to say it
Okay
've dated a lot of women
mean, not tons, but a lot
And, the thing is, 've never
been in love before
've never even told anyone  love them before
Because just never felt it
But from the day we met, from the first time our backs accidentally touched in the subway,  feel this, this
(he shakes his head) Maybe this is too much to say right now, but
love you, Zoe really do
Stan finishes
He looks at her and smiles
Zoe just stares at him
(') In my mind, you were supposed to say,  love you, too
Instead, Zoe covers her mouth and runs to the bathroom beat later, we hear her vomit
'  - Zoe is at the sink, furiously brushing her teeth
Stan enters
Zoe
He looks at her
Sees the tears in her eyes
(') Why are you crying
Everything's perfect
It's not
Sure it is
54
Zoe takes a deep breath
(') What
'm pregnant
Uh, 'm pretty sure it doesn't happen that fast
Zoe shakes her head
just found out
Pregnant
As in you're going to have a baby
Zoe nods
(') don't understand
know
It's hard to explain
Well, who's it
don't know
What
don't know who the father is kind of know him
just don't know his name exactly
It was sort of anonymous
Anonymous
He's a donor
From a sperm bank
Seriously, what the fuck are you talking about
Sperm bank
What
55
know, this is so fucked up
When did all of this happen
The day we met
That same day
And  didn't tell you because didn't think there was any way could be pregnant
But
why
Because supposedly with frozen sperm it takes a few tries and
No, why would you do this
Because  wanted a baby
And 'm almost forty, and  never met the right guy
was afraid if waited any longer it would all pass me by, and 'd miss my chance
Stan just looks at her
Speechless
(') didn't know you
would have never done it if-- just told you  loved you
Well
do you not now
You're pregnant
Don't say it like that
You're pregnant
Yes
'm pregnant
'm pregnant
56
tell you 'm in love with you and you tell me your pregnant with some stranger's child
Don't say it like that
You make it sound dirty
'm sorry
'm stunned don't know what to say
What the fuck am  supposed to say
This is great fucking news
Congratulations
Why did you wait so long to tell me
Because 'm freaking out, okay didn't know what to do
made this big decision to do this and then  met you-- Well, what am  supposed to do now
This isn't how it was supposed to be
This isn't what-- 'm sorry
'm sorry, okay
Life isn't perfect
It's not all neat and tidy like your perfect family and your perfect farm and your bluegrass band
It's messy
It's fucked up
This is real life, okay
'm sorry to break it to you
They both stand there
After the raised voices, the silence feels more pronounced
(') 'm sorry
Sorry
What's sorry going to do
Stan walks out
Zoe stands there
And stands there
And then she starts to cry
'  - Zoe lies in bed awake
Nuts is beside her
They are alone
57
- It's daybreak at the farm
move herds of goats from one pasture to another
- Stan lies awake in a small guest room
Joan enters and is startled to find him in there
Oh,  thought you were in your room
Sorry
(then) Everything okay
Stan doesn't answer
Joan sits on the corner of the bed
(') Well, she seems really terrific
Dad and  both think so
She's smart and poised and
Next door, we hear Zoe puking again
Joan stops
Then, wanting to seem open-minded, continues
(') And warm and gracious
Another very
(') And pretty and
Another
Joan looks at Stan
(') What the hell's going on in there
She's pregnant
Oh, dear God
We hear the toilet
- Zoe sits in the passenger seat with the key in the ignition
Stan leans against the car
They are both quiet
58
don't know what to say
Neither does Stan, who says nothing
He runs his foot back and forth in the gravel
(') guess 'd given up on meeting someone like you, and  did what thought was best
Stan still doesn't say anything
(') But, for what it's worth
love you, too
She puts the car in gear and pulls out
Stan watches her go
His hands in his pockets
'  - Zoe stands in the hallway of Mona's apartment building beat later, Mona opens the door and holds out her arms
Come here
Zoe walks slowly into her embrace
They stand like this for a long time
Just holding each other
Until Mona's three kids run out with wiffle-ball bats and chase each other down the hall
beat later, the toddler runs after them crying
'  - Zoe lies in bed with Nuts
She opens her eyes and stares at the ceiling
Then, with a sigh, she gets up and does her morning ritual
She pulls up her nightgown and sticks out her stomach
For the first time, we actually see a little bump
- Zoe lies on the table with a paper gown over her lap
She looks down at her feet in the stirrups
Sadly, we notice a perfect pedicure
Dr
Harris comes in with a big smile
59
Congratulations
What luck to get pregnant on the first try, huh
And with frozen sperm, too
So, how are we feeling
(unconvincing) Okay
You sure about that
It's been hard
don't know if was really prepared for this
Well, your hormones aren't helping, and going through this without a partner must be difficult
Dr
Harries readies the ultrasound wand and inserts the device
He turns the monitor so that Zoe can see
(') Well, the good news is everything looks great
You are now eight weeks pregnant, which is an important milestone
With a little luck, we should be able to see a heartbeat today
On the screen we see a small flickering dot
Dr
Harris smiles
That's it
That's
my baby
Saying these words out loud for the first time hits Zoe
Tears fill her eyes
(') Hi, Baby
(then) Is it okay
Is it healthy
Everything's just
(makes a face, then) Wait, a minute
What
Wait a minute, what
60
Well
see another heartbeat
(freaking out) It has two hearts
No
but you have two babies
Zoe's mouth falls open
'  - We're back at Single Women By Choice
The women are sitting on the floor
Sara is still nursing Dakota
Zoe has her head in her hands
Twins
That's fantastic
Zoe bursts into tears
Why are you crying
That's so lucky
Yup
That's me
Lucky, lucky, me
The women are sensing the sarcasm, but not getting it
Are you okay
Is it a financial concern
There are many programs-- No
'm fairly loaded, actually
Used to work for Google
(blows nose) 'm sorry
This is hard for me don't know if  can talk about it yet
Take your time
When you feel like sharing, we're here for you
We're all sisters here
(then, to the group) Let's give Zoe some space
When she's ready to talk, we're ready to listen
Deep, cleansing breaths, Zoe
61
Carol takes a deep breath and then lets it out
(') Now, in the meantime, does anyone else have anything they want to discuss
Problems
Concerns
Tabitha, the tall woman with the nose ring, raises her hand
'm having a hard time
Luca keeps asking why he doesn't have a daddy, and  just don't know what-- (blurting out) There's this guy
His name is Stan
And he's fantastic
knew it
Uh
wasn't  just speaking
knew you were with that guy
What guy
Zoe, this group is called Single Mother's By Choice
know
'm sorry-- Um, excuse me
What about Luca
He's been really, really sad
(floodgates opening) Have you ever met a guy and you get butterflies and you think this is the kind of man who could take care of me forever
The kind of guy who makes you re-examine everything
Like, maybe  can be a stay-at-home mom and be barefoot and pregnant
The women stare blankly at Zoe
62
(') He actually lives on a farm
Plays the banjo
Maybe  could learn to sew and take care of the animals
Like Laura Ingalls
Even Dakota stops nursing and looks over at that one
'  - The women file out
No one dares look at Zoe
It's very awkward, although Zoe seems unaware
She turns to Carol
Carol, thank you
This has been really helpful
Just getting it all out and being with other women who-- 'm going to have to ask you not to come back
What
Why
don't think we can help you, and, quite frankly, you're against everything we stand for
But,  thought we were all sisters
No
Not you
(then) Do you know how long it took me to conceive
Five years
had three miscarriages and spent every last dime on in-vitro
And Dana
The woman with the short hair
Which one
The one with the really short hair
Yeah, that doesn't really narrow it down much
63
She   just flew to Memphis to watch her   baby being born
Seconds after the   birth, the birth mother changed her   mind and refused to give it up
Zoe's face changes
She starts to get it
(') So, as you can see, we are really dedicated and choosing to be single mothers, and you seem to be in a slightly different place
You're carrying two healthy babies, and you have no idea how lucky you are
(after a beat) You're right
like you, Zoe
We all like you
But you kind of need to figure out where you are
Zoe nods
- Zoe and Nana are walking the loop around the courtyard
Zoe looks terrible
Like she hasn't slept in days
They complete a lap
Arthur gives them the double thumbs up sign
That man is obsessed with my ass
know
It's kind of upsetting
He wants to take me on a cruise so that we can finally tie the knot
But,  don't know
What's the hurry
You've been engaged for nine years
No reason to rush into anything
Nana looks over at Zoe
She sees the bags under her eyes
64
(') You look terrible, dear
Thanks
You must really love him, huh
guess  do
Honey, 'm sure he's wonderful, and 'm sure he loves you, too
But, you have put him in a really awkward position
Having a baby is a big adjustment for any couple
And you're not married
And he's not the father
And you've only been together a little while
And now you're having twins
And-- Please stop
'm just saying, if he actually wanted to stay with you right now, he'd be the greatest man in the world, and, quite frankly,  don't think any man is that great
They complete another lap around the courtyard
Arthur smiles at them and then "raises the roof
" (') Arthur's just about the best man know, and look at him
He's a fucking idiot
- Stan leans against the fence looking at the goats
He has the beginnings of a beard growing
The scruff makes him look older
Thinner
Joan approaches and stands next to him for a bit
You know, people thought we were crazy when we bought this farm
() 65
(') All of our friends in New York, they thought we'd lost our minds
Stan nods
We get the feeling he's heard this before
(') guess 'm saying that you may have envisioned your life going one way, but the reality is, it could go a totally different direction
You just have to be open to it
Stan watches a nearby goat coaxing her baby to nurse
He shrugs
Having a baby with someone  barely know, someone else's baby
it's just not how  pictured it
used to work on Wall Street
Now wear boots covered in goat shit
This isn't how  pictured it, either
But guess what
'm happy
She gives him a sympathetic hug and walks away
'  - Stan lies in bed looking up at the "stars
" There's even less glow now than last time
He sighs and then turns over to try and sleep
Nuts' off-road wheelchair in the corner of the room
Stan looks at it and can't help but smile
'  - Zoe and Nuts lie in the bed
They are looking at each other on the pillow
Zoe scratches behind his ears
Zoe goes to the mirror and does her usual
The bump is growing
For the first time, we see a smile
'  - The Single Mother's By Choice women are sitting in their usual circle
Lori is passing around a list
66
Make sure you put your numbers down
want to have everyone's number handy in case  go into labor early
Zoe enters
All eyes turn
She waves sheepishly
Hi, guys
No one knows what to say
Hi, Zoe
just wanted to apologize
'm sorry  got into a relationship and wasn't honest with you guys, and 'm sorry  interrupted you, Tabitha
hope Luca is doing better
Thanks
(to Carol) And 've thought a lot about what you said, about how lucky  am got into this whole situation because  wanted to have a baby
And, somehow,  lost sight of that
(then) Anyway,  need partners in this, and  hope you'll take me back
Lori smiles and hands her the piece of paper
(') What's this
It's a phone tree
'm due next month, but my midwife thinks  may go sooner
want everyone to be there
Are you in
Zoe smiles
'm in
67
- Zoe has her head held high and her cute belly pushed out as far as it will go
with a double stroller approaches
Zoe smiles
Hi
Hi
Hi
/Hi
Zoe walks on
She sees her reflection in a store window and smiles
She looks like an actual pregnant person now
As she is walking and smiling to herself, we hear a familiar voice
Hi
Her
Stan appears next to her in the reflection
For a brief second, they look like a family
Zoe turns
They both stop
Unsure of whether to hug or what
They just stand there
Hi
Hi
You said that already
You
look great
Zoe touches her belly
Proud but protective
(') How are you feeling
Okay
Good
long silence
68
You have a beard
Yeah, it's awful isn't it
No
Don't lie
(then) Did  tell you how pretty you look
Zoe nods
Another silence
(') miss you
group of  , lost in their own conversations, push up the block, separating Zoe and Stan for a moment
This separation makes the moment all the more tense
miss you, too
This whole time we've been apart, 've been trying to figure out what it is about you that  love so much
And  think that it's that a lot of people talk about doing things, but you actually do them
You're really kind of daring
How you quit your job and took over a pet store all because some asshole sold you a lame dog
You came and found me at the Farmer's Market even though the night before acted like a total stalker
Zoe smiles at the memory
Stan continues
(') And now you're pregnant
Because you wanted to have a baby and didn't think you could wait any longer
Well, that's just the same kind of thing
It's
brave
And can't love you for being that way but then walk away for the same reason
Stan takes her hands
69
(') love you
've been waiting my whole life for you
And  can't let one little baby get in the way of that
just
can't
There's something  need to tell you
Okay
It's big
And you're allowed to take all of this back when  tell you
What
It's not just one baby
'm having twins
Stan looks at her
Is she joking
Her look says no
He takes a beat
And then, even though it's not a joke, he starts to laugh
little laugh at first and then a big one
And then, Zoe starts laughing too
The whole thing is just so ridiculous
This is insane
'  - It's late
Zoe and Stan are naked in bed, lying face to face
Stan puts his hand on her stomach
He feels the little bump, new since he's last been with her
Do you feel any kicking
Sometimes
What does it feel like
Like butterflies
70
Stan smiles
He likes this image
He runs his hand over her belly
Zoe moves in closer
Touches his cheek
(') Are you really sure you want to do this
Yeah
'm really sure
They look at each other for a long time
Finally, Zoe closes her eyes and settles in for sleep, with Stan watching her as she dozes off
- of a  where we see two distinct baby shapes floating head-to-toe
Dr
Harris holds the ultrasound wand to her belly
Stan doesn't say anything
He looks on in total amazement
Are you okay
They're so
perfect
They look like real babies
Would you like to know the sexes
They look at each other
Zoe smiles
Stan shrugs
Zoe nods
Stan does, too
Yes
Tell us
You're having two healthy little girls
Stan gets tears in his eyes
Two girls
Two girls
Congratulations
71
- Stan and Zoe walk down Madison Avenue
All of the other are on some kind of mission -- shopping, rushing to meetings, or fighting for cabs
But Zoe and Stan just walk slowly hand-in-hand
Every so often looking at each other and just smiling or laughing
Then, suddenly, Stan picks her up in the middle of the street
Two girls
with a  in a Baby Bjorn passes by
Stan smiles
Now he's part of this exclusive club
(') Hi
Hi
- We  past several small plates of food on a table
chef tells us what delectable items we are looking at
Here we have a yellowtail sashimi with ponzu sauce and pea shoots
This is carpaccio with shaved white truffles
And, finally, an heirloom tomato salad with fresh Buratta flown in from Italy this morning
Thanks, Sam
It looks incredible
Sam tops off their champagne and exits
Stan picks up his fork and starts eating
Zoe does not
(') Aren't you hungry
can't eat any of this
Why not
72
(pointing to each dish) Raw
Raw
Unpasteurized
(re: champagne) Alcohol
Let me get Sam back
He'll make you anything you want
don't want to hurt his feelings
You go ahead
'm fine
Well, what are you going to eat
' - The  reads back Zoe's order
Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with cheese, four large fries, and a six piece chicken McNuggets
Make that an eight, no, ten-piece McNuggets
(to Stan) You'll have some, right
No
(back to the cashier) Ten-piece
Someone will eat them
Stan stands behind Zoe with an incredulous look on his face
'  - Zoe and Stan lie in bed, each reading a copy of "What to Expect when You're Expecting
" Zoe has the McNuggets box on her chest
She dips each nugget in three different sauces and then takes a bite
Stan watches with a mixture of amusement and revulsion
73
(re: book) Have you gotten to page 79 yet
No
stopped reading when you ripped out one of my pages and used it as a napkin
Says here many women in the second trimester experience an increased sexual appetite
Really
Zoe smiles and then slowly triple dunks another McNugget
She takes a seductive bite
(') Are you coming on to me
It's kind of hard to tell right now
Yeah
'm coming on to you
Zoe throws the McNuggets on the floor and climbs on top of him
She puts his hands on her body and then starts to kiss him voraciously
After a beat, Stan stops
(') What
You have chicken in your hair
- Zoe and Mona are on the elliptical machines
Zoe is going very fast, while Mona is barely going at all
Why are you even working out
This is the one time in your life you're allowed to let it go
Because look at me
just keep getting bigger and bigger
74
Well, yeah
That's kind of how it goes
'm afraid 'm going to scare him away
'm like one of those giant bouncy castles
Soon 'm going to take over the whole back yard
Come on
He loves you for you
'm just getting kind of freaked out by everything
He asked me to go to this wedding with him
What kind of first impression am  going to make on all of his friends
Well, you're knocked up with some stranger's twins
So, already you're not exactly
Not helping
Do you have anything to wear at least
'  - Stan, dressed in a tux, sits on Zoe's bed
He turns to the closet
Everything okay in there
cocktail dress  out and hits him in the head
(') Never mind
He waits a few beats
Another dress  out
(
) This
Honey, whatever you wear is fine
75
(
) don't have anything to wear
That's the problem
Another dress sails through the air
(') Fuuuuuuck
You always look great
've never seen you not look great
Stan goes to the closet
Zoe is pulling on a long black dress
She tries to smush her boobs down into the top
(') That's perfect
You look hot
Really
You think
Zoe turns to reveal the back
The two sides of the zipper are ten inches apart
Do you have a shawl or something
Zoe bursts into tears
- cab pulls up in front of Zoe's brownstone
Stan opens the door for Zoe who is now wearing a long silver dress
While it's certainly hugging every curve and bump, it looks great
You look smokin'
Thanks, honey
Zoe pauses in front of the open taxi door
Let's go
We're super late
She tries to bend at the waist, but the dress is too tight
Then she tries to go in butt first and swing her legs around, but again, the dress is too tight
Hmmmm
76
Why don't you sort of go in
head first and then turn around
Zoe leans her head in and then has no other choice but to lie down sideways on the seat
Stan tries not to laugh
Shut up and push me
Push you
Just do it
Stan pushes her legs, and Zoe disappears inside the cab
- Zoe lies down straight across the seats like a board
hate everyone
She sucks in her breath and tries to sit up
As soon as she bends at the waist, we hear a horrific
She bursts into tears again
'  - We  over the coffee table
There's a pint of melty Ben and Jerry's, a roll of cookie dough (half eaten,)  Weekly, and The National Enquirer
Zoe and Bobby lie on the floor looking at the ceiling
Do you think he's telling everyone why  didn't go
'm too much of a fat-ass walrus to go to the wedding
You're not a fat ass walrus
You're pregnant
Zoe eyes well up with tears again
(') Why are you crying
So what
You missed a stupid wedding
() 77
(') You got to have girls' night with me
This is way more fun
don't know
'm just so emotional lately
It's the hormones
You can't help it
Being pregnant sucks
You're emotional, and irrational, and you get back fat
have back fat
No
'm just kidding
(then) Okay, yes
You have back fat
Zoe feels her back
How's Stan going to stay with me through this
'm disgusting
We'll go shopping tomorrow
We'll get some hip maternity clothes
whatever that means
Look at me, Bobby
What
(pinching back fat) Look at me
What do you see
see the most amazingly wonderful person  know
Zoe smiles
Tears come to her eyes again
(') With back fat
78
- Stan leans against the bar with a beer in hand
He is watching all of the Farmer's Market girls and his co-worker, Fred, on the dance floor
Everyone looks drunk and happy
Olivia stumbles towards him with an empty glass of champagne
Why aren't you dancing
'm just about to go
It's late
Come on, one dance
The spaghetti strap of her dress falls over her shoulder
Stan notices
She steps in closer
(') For old time's sake
have a girlfriend, Olivia
Never stopped you before
She tries to kiss him
Stan steps away
It's serious this time
Olivia pulls back, surprised
'  - Zoe is asleep in the bed
Her bump looks very cute under the covers
Stan quietly gets ready for bed
She turns to him, half asleep
How was it
Boring
Good
Stan gets in bed next to her
Zoe scoots into him
79
(') miss my old ass
Excuse me
It was one of my best features
You know what's weird
never knew your old ass
It's kind of like this ass but way hotter
also don't know what you really like to eat and what's just a craving, or when you start laughing hysterically and then crying and you say, this isn't me, if that's true because  don't really know the real you
All  know is the pregnant you
That is weird
Or like how you're horny all the time
Is that you
Or is that pregnant you
(lying) That's me
When all of this is over, who will you be
Hopefully, myself again
But
who is that
80
'  - The clock by the bed says 2:30 a
m
Stan is snoring slightly
Nuts is on the pillow beside him
Zoe's side is empty
'   - Zoe sits on the floor of the living room sifting through a box of photographs
We  her back into the bedroom and onto the bed
As Stan slowly opens his eyes, she holds up a photograph
His
It's a picture of a woman's ass
This is my old ass
Stan blinks a few times
His eyes adjusting
Why do you have a picture of your ass
My college boyfriend took it
So, guess in fairness, my ass doesn't look exactly like this anymore, but it's pretty close
It's held up
It's a nice ass
You said you don't know the real me, so  thought 'd show you
She picks up another photograph
This one is of Zoe at twelve and at her most awkward -- short hair, braces and acne
(') This is me in seventh grade
Stan props himself up in one elbow
Wow
know
81
You look like Anthony Michael Hall
This period, as horrible as it was, made me who  am
think every person should go through a hideously ugly phase
It builds character
(then) It also taught me that  should never, under any circumstances, have short hair and a perm again
She picks up another picture
It's Zoe in a bathing cap and Speedo
She's holding up a yellow ribbon and has her arm around Nana
(') This   is one of my favorites because look   how happy  am
don't even know   what place yellow is, but 'm sure   it's not good
Fifth place
But  still look super happy, right
That's all because of Nana
Whatever  did, she thought it was the best
The next picture is a Halloween shot of Bobby, Mona and Zoe
Bobby is all in green, Zoe is all in yellow and Mona is in regular clothes
(') These are my best friends, Bobby and Mona
Mona and  met in high school and Bobby passed out on my couch in college and never left
You haven't met them yet because they might scare you away
Why are you dressed like that
Halloween
We were supposed to be a traffic light but Mona bagged out at the last minute and so Bobby and just look like idiots
That's typical Mona, by the way
82
Zoe puts the picture down and picks up another
It's a woman in a hospital bed
She's giving the thumbs up sign
(') This is my mom
Stan takes the picture and studies it
You look just like her
This is the last picture of her that  have
She lived for a few more years, but we never took any pictures because she didn't want us to remember her like that
was eight when she died
can't imagine
She had a great laugh
And really soft hands
She used to rub my back before  went to sleep
Zoe puts the picture on the bedside table, propping it up next to her clock
Do you have any pictures of your dad
Zoe doesn't say anything
(') 'm sorry
If you don't want to talk about it
My mother was in a coma for two years before the end
That's when my dad left her
Oh
So
that's when he died
To us, anyway
God, Zoe
'm so sorry
83
(after a beat) It's okay
It was an important lesson
That's when  realized that nothing lasts forever
This sad statement hangs in the air for a few moments
(') So, that's my story
That's the real me
Things can last forever, you know
Not for me they can't
Stan takes her hand, and they stay like that for a while
Just holding hands on the floor of her moonlit room
Finally, the silence is broken by the telephone
(') That's weird
'    - Zoe and Stan enter the lobby of an old building in Tribeca
'm confused
Why did you say you would come witness this birth in the first place
don't know
Seemed like a good idea at the time
was trying to get back in their good graces
Go home
'll meet you there don't want them to see you anyway
It's four in the morning
'm not letting you walk home alone
Fine
'll just pop in, show my face and leave
Ten minutes, tops
84
'  - There are candles everywhere and a table of food and drinks
Kind of like a birthing cocktail party
Zoe eats a brownie
Carol approaches with Lori, who is wearing a caftan and rubbing her large stomach
They all hug
Zoe, it's so nice of you to come, especially at this crazy hour
You're really one of us now
Are you sure you're in labor
You're so calm
Oh, 'm sure
Well,  just wanted to come and say a quick hi and good luck
You're not staying
You have to stay
Lori wants us all to be together for this
Well,  really want to be here but
um, the truth is
actually 've been wanting to tell you guys for a while but, the truth is
Lori drops her head on Zoe's shoulder and lets out a giant It's long and it's awkward
(whispering) She's having a contraction
Zoe nods
This is weird
Lori breathes through it
Okay
What was it you were saying
'm back with Stan
85
Stan who
The farmer
Actually, he makes cheese
He named a cheese after me
Isn't that romantic
Sort of
(off their blank stares) Well, anyway, 'm not technically a single mother by choice anymore
So, if you want me to leave right now,  totally understand
'll just walk out the door and-- No,  really want you to stay
(bummed) Oh
Listen, Zoe, if you're happy, we're happy
We'd love to meet him
Bring him to group any time
Well, actually, he's downstairs, so should probably get back to-- Great
Invite him up
Oh, no, no, no
'm not shy
've been through this before
It's quite beautiful, really
Zoe stands there trying to come up with another excuse
After a few moments, it's clear that she cannot
'    - Stan looks up from the Hunan Lotus take-out menu he's been reading to pass the time
86
Excuse me
Just a few minutes
don't know, Zoe
You have to come up
They begged me
And truthfully, 'm kind of scared of them
Please
'  - Zoe and Stan hover over the dessert table
They both eat brownies and keep their eyes down
Sara is next to them nursing Dakota
This is weird
Good brownies, though
This one has peanut butter in it
Carol walks by with a little , which she bangs rhythmically
Come on everybody, it's time
She's getting into the water
The what
Oh, it's a water birth
Didn't Zoe tell you
Carol starts banging the drum again and moves off
What's a water birth
don't know
But just so we're clear, this
(re
the whole scene) Is not the real me
87
'll wait here
Zoe grabs another brownie and exits
'   - In the middle of this very small, very cramped living room is an inflatable baby pool
And in this baby pool is Lori, who is now naked and pushing
Zoe watches, horrified, the brownie still in her hand
Carol is beside her, playing the drum and chanting
Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya
(eyes wide) Wow
Wow
Wow
know
It's amazing how the body can open up like that
Zoe covers her mouth
It looks like she is going to throw up
She stumbles for the door
'm just going to get some air
'm feeling a little
Don't move, Zoe, you're my focal point
Lori then  through another big contraction
Push, Lori
Push
While Lori's eyes are closed, Zoe tries to sneak out
Carol chases after, still beating the drum
You can't leave
You're her focal point
Can't she use someone else
88
She's in labor
You want to argue with her now
: '   - Carol beats the drum faster now
Some of the other Single Mothers by Choicers join her in the chant
Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya
Lori lets out a  as Tabitha and the  pull her legs back
Zoe watches with both hands over her mouth
Oh, Jesus
(then) What is
that
Sssshh
It's perfectly natural
Sometimes the bowels just let go
(then, back to chanting) Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya
The midwife fishes out the poop with a plastic bag
Zoe turns away, gagging
She drops her brownie
(yelling) Don't move, Zoe,  need you
You're my focal point
What does that even mean
Zoe turns back
Her face white as a sheet
Lori lets out another
need to turn over
Please
Do it, Lori
We're here for you
We're all here for you
Carol beats the drum faster as Lori gets on all fours
The midwife lifts Lori's leg up to the side
Lori lets out a loud, -
89
(excited) Here comes the head
Lori's moan turns into a -
We can see the head, Lori
There's so much hair
(woozy, afraid) don't think that's the baby's hair
want to see the head
Get me a mirror
It's in the bedroom
'll get it
Zoe makes a desperate attempt to run from the room
, '
'  - Out in the foyer, Stan is paralyzed
Next to him is Dakota, who is crying
Through the hallway mirror, he can see what's going on in the living room: a hefty woman on all fours in a dirty inflatable swimming pool with a hairy head coming out of a hairy vag
(
) Stan, get the mirror
'   - Stan, walks backwards with his head down, holding a mirror
Excuse me
Hello
'm Stan
Excuse me
Hi
'm Stan
Carol grabs the mirror and holds it under Lori
Lori lifts her leg like a dog taking a piss and then starts to cry
90
Look at all that wet, curly hair
Stan steals a look, starts to dry heave and rushes to Zoe
(freaking out) Let's get the hell out of here
can't
'm her focal point
What does that mean
don't know
Suddenly, we hear a huge
Zoe and Stan turn just in time to see the baby emerge and plop into the water
of the baby in the dirty water still attached to the umbilical cord
of Zoe and Stan's horrified faces
Zoe's eyes roll back and we: we hear silence
Blessed silence
No drums
No chants
No screams
Nothing
Until, we hear the
'   - We are  on Zoe's face
She opens her eyes
Blinks a few times
Are you okay
don't know
Why am  wet
to reveal that Zoe is lying in the inflatable pool
Her eyes go from side to side
The horror of the situation becoming clear
spongy, purple thing floats by
(') What is that
91
(afraid) think it's the placenta
Zoe's eyes roll back again and we
14TH  - 14th street is just coming to life as the  start to unload their wares
Zoe and Stan head up the street slowly, wearily, like soldiers back from battle
Wow
We really shouldn't have seen that
No
did mention that  barely know those people, right
Like forty times
feel the need to say it again
They turn into the Farmer's Market
Fred unloading cheese from the back of the Little Goat truck
Stan and Zoe slowly walk towards him
It won't be like that for us
How do you know
Well, for starters, you wax
Olivia crossing from her berry stand to the cheese stand with a blueberry pie
She is about to place the pie on Stan's table when she looks up and sees Stan and Zoe
Oh, hi
92
Hi
(awkward beat, then) You remember Zoe
Right, hi
And then Olivia notices Zoe's pregnant belly
(') Wow
(then, to Stan) Wow
At the same time, Zoe notices the post-it on the pie
It says,
What is that supposed to mean
It's nothing
Olivia crumples the post-it and turns to Stan
(') (re
Zoe's pregnant belly) had no idea it was that serious
told you it was serious
(interrupting) What the hell does, "sorry about last night" mean
It's stupid
was drunk and
It was nothing
What was nothing
Olivia turns back to Stan, flabbergasted
You're having a baby
didn't know you'd been together that long
93
Well, they're not mine
but, yeah, we're having a baby
Two actually
On Zoe's look of shock we
: '  - The fruits and vegetables and flowers become a blur as Zoe runs out of the Farmer's Market
Stan chases after her
Nothing happened
Get away from me
Stan runs in front of her, forcing her to stop
Nothing happened
You said, "they're not mine
" didn't mean to say it
How could you say that
don't know
was flustered
Flustered
'm sorry, 'm not exactly thinking straight
've been up all night watching Orca give birth
(incredulous) "They're not mine
" (at a loss ) Well,  mean
technically, they're not
94
The minute he says this, he wishes he could take it back
Zoe just looks at him
She shakes her head
You know, all this time you're trying to figure out who the real me is, but who the fuck are you
Zoe
She runs to a nearby cab and slams the door
'  - Zoe enters the apartment and slams the door behind her
She runs to the couch and collapses in tears
Nuts wheels over and stands beside her
- Zoe and Mona are at their usual table
Zoe looks like she hasn't slept
Do you really think something happened with the berry girl
They both said nothing happened
Well, are they going to come out and tell me
And that's not even the point
He said, the babies weren't his
And if he says that, he thinks that
And if he thinks that, he's not really committed
So, now you run
Why should  stick around for the end of the story when  know what it's going to be
Mona says nothing
She looks like she might say something and then doesn't
(') What
If you want to say something, say it
95
Do you know the end of the story
Can't you just give him the benefit of the doubt
He seems like such a good guy
You haven't even met him
Yeah, and don't think  don't know the reason for that
You were never going to see this through, Zoe
Never
It was doomed before it began
Just like all of your relationships
You get out before you get hurt
You don't think 'm hurt right now
Every man is not your father
When are you going to realize that
You don't know what you're talking about
've known you for thirty years know you don't trust people
You and your grandmother, both
She's been engaged to Arthur for how long now
Leave Nana out of this
She's never going to marry him
Just like you'd never marry Stan
No wonder you ended up with a sperm donor
He'll never let you down
It's your ideal boyfriend
Zoe's face changes
She looks incredibly hurt
used a donor because  wanted a baby
'm sorry
went too far
96
Because  wanted to have a family
Because Nana is the only one 've got and she's eighty-four years old
And then it will just be me
So, yeah, you went a little too far
Zoe leaves Mona at the table
'  - Zoe and Nuts lie on the pillow together
Zoe scratches behind his ears
Guess it's just you and me again
Nuts licks her face
She gets out of bed and goes to check her belly in the mirror
It's actually getting kind of huge
'  - Zoe walks down the steps
Stan is waiting for her on the sidewalk
His hands in his pockets
What
It's Thursday
We have a doctor's appointment
There is no "we", Stan
Come on,  didn't mean to say it, and that's not how  feel
Zoe shakes her head
made a mistake trusting you
Don't say that
That's not true
You're not good for me
You made me think  needed you, and  don't
97
So that's it
Because of one stupid, asinine thing that  said, it's all over
This is how it ends
Yes
This is how it ends
(then) don't know why you're so surprised
told you, nothing lasts forever
Zoe gives him a matter-of-fact shrug and walks off
'  - Dr
Harris moves the ultrasound wand over Zoe's belly
Zoe holds up her shirt and watches the monitor
Things look great
Good
So, 'll see you back in two weeks, and we'll start checking to see if the babies are dropping
It's hard to believe we're in the home stretch
Dr
Harris helps Zoe sit up
Now's the time  start discussing a birthing plan with my patients
Do you want me to wait until next time when Stan's here
Oh
Uh, no
He won't be here
He's out of town or something
No
He's just
out
98
Oh
'm sorry to hear that
It's back to just you and me now
We've come full circle
Well, don't you want anyone with you in the delivery room
You know, like a birthing partner
- Zoe and Nana are speed-walking
Nana stops, excited
Me
Yeah
Is that okay
Of course
Good
`Cause you're all 've got
What do  have to do
don't know
It will be a c-section, so, basically, just stand there and try not to faint
can do that
Thanks, Nana
It means a lot to me that you'll be there
Are you kidding me
've been waiting my whole life for this
They pass Arthur, who is in his usual spot, but instead of leering at Nana, he's in his chair with his head back and eyes closed
Holy shit, is he dead
99
Sleeping
How can you tell
He's been like that all morning wore him out last night
Wow
did not need to know that
We were celebrating
(with a smile) We finally set a date
Zoe stops dead in her tracks
Excuse me
- Nana walks Zoe through the Shadybrook dining room
So, we'll put the band here and the dance floor right here
can't believe you're getting married
What made you change your mind
All of a sudden it just hit me, what am  waiting for
love him
He loves me
What am  so afraid of
Wow
This is
really big news
You don't seem happy
No,  am
It's just
it just makes my situation seem all the more tragic
You're getting married and here  am
100
Her voice trails off
Zoe
Don't worry
'm fine
'm really happy for you
'm worried about you, honey
'm fine
just don't want you to make the same mistakes  made
've been alone for over thirty years now, and that's too long
Sometimes in life you have to forgive and move on
Are you talking about my father or Stan
Both, baby
'  - Zoe has her box of photographs
She pulls out a picture from the very bottom
(
) Because if you don't learn how to forgive, you will always be stuck in the past
The photo is Zoe at age four and a man who looks so much like her, that it can only be her father
After a long beat, she puts it on her bedside table, next to the one of her mother
The two pictures, side-by-side make up a family
Zoe and her father in one shot and her mother from the hospital bed giving the thumbs up sign in the other
Over this image, we hear a quartet playing
101
- The music takes us into the church and there we find Nana, lovely in her wedding gown, and Arthur, dashing in his morning suit, standing at the alter holding hands
Both have tears in their eyes
Arthur lifts her veil and gives her the sweetest kiss
Zoe and Bobby in the first pew, passing a handkerchief back and forth
- Bobby leans against the piano singing a beautiful rendition of "What a Wonderful World
" Nana and Arthur are alone on the dance floor
It's their first dance as husband and wife
(singing) see trees of green, red roses too
see them bloom for me and you
Zoe watches, her hands on her belly
Mona stands beside her
This song always makes me cry
Me, too
Is it happy or sad
The words are happy but the song is so sad
guess it's both
Happy and sad
(singing) see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed day, the dark and sacred night
'm sorry about the things  said
know
102
It was really shitty of me
It was
Especially because you were right
Mona takes Zoe's hand
(singing) And  think to myself
what a wonderful world
don't want to be alone forever, Mona
Then don't be
'  - Stan stares off into space
His beard is back surveys the different cheeses on the table
Is this new
The Zoe
Yeah
This is the first week it's been out
Can  have a sample
What's it like
It's
very stubborn, overly suspicious and distrustful of men
The customer looks up at Stan
Huh
- Bobby pulls Zoe onto the dance floor
Come on, you old maid
103
No
Dance with me
One dance
Forget it
Fine
But it doesn't mean that won't dance with you
What
Bobby starts dancing
But really dancing
Justin Timberlake style
Zoe smiles at the absurdity and then tries to walk away
But Bobby won't let her escape
He blocks her path and keeps dancing
This time turning around and shaking his ass triple-time, like Beyonce
Haaaaaay
Go away, you freak
crowd of old people gather round
They start clapping, thinking this is some kind of young person's dance routine
Smack it, Bitch
Bobby takes Zoe's hand and smacks his ass with it
(') You know you love it
Uh-huh
That's right
Smack it
The old people do the same
Trying to learn the hip new dance the kids are doing
Several octogenarian couples smacking each other's asses
While this is happening, a weird look crosses Zoe's face
Bobby jumps up and turns around to face Zoe
But when he lands on the ground, his feet slide out from under him and he hits the floor
(') What the hell
An   in the crowd looks down at the puddle
104
Damn it
Not again
(then, checks pants) Nope
Not me
few other old people look down and check themselves
At which point, Zoe looks down and realizes
think my water just broke
- The whole retirement community is outside throwing rice as Zoe, Bobby, Mona, Nana and Arthur try to figure out the logistics of the trip to the hospital
'll drive
You're in labor
You can't drive
'll drive
You don't have a car or a license
(then, to Bobby) You drive
We're in Queens
don't even know what side of the road they drive on here
Will someone please just drive me to the fucking hospital
All of a sudden, a white   pulls up
Mona's at the wheel
She leans out and waves
This was my surprise for after the wedding, but let's hit it
This works
They all pile in
105
And then the car pulls off, revealing a sign that says, "Ensure" cans tied to strings bump along behind them
- Things are a bit frantic in the car
Are you okay
Remember to breathe
Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in
Mona looks at Zoe in the rearview and does Lamaze breaths
Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, hee-hee
(joining in) Hoo-hoo
Hee-hee
/ Hoo-hoo
Hee-hee
Please stop
It's getting really breathy in here
'm fine
What about me
have amniotic fluid on my Gucci tux
on the mini bar, which is fully stocked
Who needs a drink
Everyone (including Zoe) raises their hands
- Zoe is being wheeled into Labor and Delivery with the gang in tow
Bobby still has a glass of champagne in his hand
Nana grabs the glass and swigs it
(whispering) Bobby
What
106
don't know if  can do this
What
can't go in with her
Well,  certainly can't do it don't do vaginas
They look at Arthur, who struggles to keep up with his walker
Don't look at me
Nana starts to hyperventilate
Help me, Bobby
Nana, pull yourself together
This is the biggest moment of Zoe's life, and you can't let her down
'd slap you right now, but 'm afraid your teeth would fly out
- Zoe is now alone in a room wearing a hospital gown
Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, hee-hee, hoo-hee
Bobby enters, all sweetness and light
Hey, girl
How ya doing
Okay
Good
(smiles, then) So,  really don't want you to worry, but Nana just passed out at the nurse's station and is now down in the  getting stitches
107
What
Everything's under control
Good thing we're at the hospital, right
Zoe jumps out of bed
Where is she
Get back in bed
All is well
Arthur's with her
Now, on to bigger and better
who do you want to be your birthing partner
Your choices are me or Mona
Zoe starts to cry
(') know
They're shitty choices
Do you want me to call your scary lesbian friends from your group
don't know
We're going to get through this, okay
You just have to really think about it
Who do you want with you in the delivery room
Zoe wipes her tears
(') Who is the one person you want by your side
77TH  - Zoe runs down the street with a blanket over her hospital gown
Taxi
- Zoe jumps in
The cabbie looks at her in the rearview mirror 108
You're not an escaped mental patient, are you
Kind of
14TH  - Zoe runs across 14th street
The blanket flaps behind her like a cape
She looks like a hugely pregnant super-hero
And suddenly, she has to slow down and then stop completely for a contraction
She leans against a parked van to steady herself
Ow
Son of a bitch, that hurts
Are you okay
Out of the corner of her eye, Zoe sees an enormous strawberry on the side of the van
And then next to it, she sees Olivia
(') Are you in labor
As soon as the contraction ends
Fuck off
Zoe takes off again
Olivia watches her go
'  - Zoe runs through the market looking for Stan
Stan's truck, where Stan and Fred are unloading cheese
Stan
Fred turns around and sees Zoe running
All belly and boobs bouncing towards him
Her gown starting falling off
Whoa
've had nightmares that started like this
109
Stan
Stan turns
Zoe
Stan
Are you okay
Don't run
can't help it
She keeps running towards him
He now runs towards her
They finally meet
Zoe is out of breath and can barely talk
Are you all right
(panting) Great
'm great
Why are you in a hospital gown
'm in labor
What
What the hell are you doing here
It's you
What
Nana's my birthing partner, but she passed out and needed stitches, and Bobby asked me who  most wanted with me, and
it's you
It's only you
(then) don't want to be alone anymore
love you
You don't know how much  love you
110
Stan doesn't know what to say
He's literally speechless
(') More than anything in the world, love you
've been in love with you since the moment you stole my cab
Zoe bends over, holding her stomach
contraction
Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, it was my cab, hee-hee, hoo-hoo
The contraction ends
Zoe can finally smile again
Stan laughs and throws his arms around her
(') Ow
Ow
Ow
'm sorry
Oh, 'm sorry
just love you
love you so much
(then) Let's get the hell out of here
Yeah
think  really need to go to the hospital now
They kiss again
And then pull apart and look at each other
Stan has tears in his eyes
Let's go have our babies
People clap and cheer as they hurry out of the Farmer's Market
Even Olivia, watching from a distance, can't help but applaud the big moment
- Some fantastic song that makes us want to cry is playing
We are  on Zoe's face
She is smiling
She does not look scared
And she does not look alone
to reveal Stan by her side
111
And we   and above the operating table and see Dr
Harris performing the -section
He pulls out the babies one by one
We  the babies as they get swaddled tight and handed back to Zoe and Stan
Zoe and Stan look at the little girls and then at each other
They are both in tears
Even Dr
Harris can't help but cry
- It's night
Zoe is asleep
She opens her eyes and takes a moment to figure out where she is
She turns to the side and finds Stan sleeping next to her, curled up against her in the tiny hospital bed
To the side of the bed are two bassinets
Each baby sleeping soundly in a little pink hat
And in the next bed is Nana, asleep with a bandage on her forehead
6TH  - Nuts trots/rolls down the sidewalk wearing a sweater that says, "'
" We  up and see Zoe and Stan strolling arm in arm, each with a Baby Bjorn with a rosy-cheeked baby girl in it
Both girls have flaming red hair
woman pushing a stroller passes by
She smiles at Zoe and Stan
They smile back
Hi
Hi
Hi
'    - They are now at the counter with hot dogs in front of them
Who knew you were such a romantic
112
Well, it's the anniversary of our first date
Where else would take you
(then) Cheers
They clink dogs and each take a bite
(') What a year, huh
Incredible
Wouldn't change a thing
Well, except for the part where you dumped me
And the part where you dumped me
(to the babies) Girls
Mommy and Daddy were stupid
The babies smile and coo
(baby-talk) Yes, we were
Yes, we were
The first time we held hands was in here
It started out as a high- five, but then  strategically turned into a hand-hold
How do you remember that
We both agreed that we were totally sick of weddings and hated when people wrote their own vows
That's right
remember that
So
hope you won't hold it against me
What
113
Nana and Arthur come through the door smiling
Zoe looks at them, confused
(') What are you doing here
And then Bobby comes through the door
(') Bobby
And then Mona
(') What's happening
And Joan and Edward
And Jalisa
And Fred
And Carol, Lori and Sara with Dakota planted on her breast
And a priest
And we
: '    - Zoe and Stan, still wearing the Baby Bjorns, stand face to face in front of the guests and the priest
promise to love you even though you still eat chicken McNuggets in bed
promise to name cheeses after all of our children no matter how embarrassed they are by it promise to always check out your ass when you walk away, and promise to love you more tomorrow than  do today, which doesn't even seem impossible
And slowly, the sound of Stan's voice fades out and the sound of Louis Armstrong's voice fades in
And we watch Zoe's face as she realizes that there are some things that really will last forever
