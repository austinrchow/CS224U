Anthony's nineteen
He's got on a red jacket with an Enco patch
Dignan's twenty
He has a buzz-cut and wears a short-sleeved terrycloth shirt
He carries a vinyl tennis bag
It's got a pouch for a racquet but no racquet in it
What color hair does he have
Black hair
Paul Michael Glaser
Making Hutch David Soul
Right
The blond guy
That's wrong
Dignan, it's -- Plus where's Huggie Bear
He's not there
Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode
think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony
No
It's a real episode
The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones
They climb over a high wooden fence
They walk through somebody's backyard
Why
As part of his plan
don't know why
See, that's what 'm saying
It has the logic of a dream
The point is the killer always goes, May  speak to Starsky
He says his name
(pause) What does Starsky say
He says
This is he
This is he
No
This is he
They climb another fence
There's big house on the other side
Anthony and Dignan are inside walking through the foyer
Anthony goes up the stairway quickly and quietly
Dignan walks to the master bedroom
Goes in the closet and grabs a box
Looks inside
Dumps it into his bag
Anthony goes into a bedroom
Looks in a dresser and takes out two watches
Digs through some socks and finds some cash
Dignan goes in the study
Opens a drawer and closes it
Opens another and lifts out a set of thin leather coin books
Anthony's in a kid's room
Looking at posters of a football player and John McEnroe on the walls
He grabs a walkman and a calculator
Then suddenly stops moving
He crouches down
Looks at a shelf of dozens of little metal soldiers
They're in formations with different uniforms
Dignan is walking down the hallway as Anthony comes down the stairs
They walk to the door and go out
twenty-four hour diner
Anthony and Dignan are eating at the counter
Did you see what  meant about the window
Kind of
Except we've already got the keys
That's true
But what if they change the locks
Would they do that
Who knows
That's why  filed it down
Dignan nods
Now that window can never be locked
It's impossible
See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details
Whereas my strength would be -- good-looking  about forty-five years old interrupts them
Can  use your Tabasco
Sure
Anthony hands her a bottle of Tabasco off the counter
She walks away
Down the counter
You don't see many women who like Tabasco
They watch her for a minute
Dignan looks away
She's really kind of hot
(looks back at her, nods) She's an attractive older woman
' huge house with a wide lawn
, who's about twenty-six, wearing black jeans and a -neck -shirt, is spraying down a battered 1972 Mercedes with a garden hose
He's got his shirt off and a towel around his neck
Dignan has an expression of intense concentration as he looks at the car
Well, what do you think
don't know, Bob
What about one of those
Dignan points to a new  and a Lexus in front of the garage
'm not allowed to drive those
Not even for emergencies
(a little angry) No
thought your parents were in Italy
They are
So who's going to know
My brother
Future Man
Who
Futute Man
You know
Cause he looks like he's from the future
He looks like he was designed by scientists
For desert warfare
That never would of -- Let's cut the bullshit
Silence
They all look at the car
Pause
It's got a -8, Dignan
What do you think the cops have
' They're sitting at the coffee table in Bob's great big living room
It's got high ceilings and two Persian rugs
They're eating sandwiches and chips
If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one
What are you talking about, Bob
Can you use a coaster
Bob slides a coaster under Dignan's glass
Did you ever steal a car bdfore
Yeah
've stolen two cars before
One Jaguar
And one Trans-Am
With -Tops
That Trans-Am was fun to drive
You stole a Trans-Am
Yes
did
, Bob
It's true, Dignan
Well
What do you want to do
You want to steal one or just drive your car
(thinks for a minute) 'll just drive my car
Anthony's playing pinball at a machine in the back of a little grocery store
Dignan's watching
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone
That's less than what it's appraised at
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins
know about money, Anthony
know the value of money
Plus the earrings are worth three times that
Anthony looks at Dignan
Dignan points at the pinball machine
Your ball
Dignan tries to hit the flipper
told you not to take the earrings
Anthony keeps looking at Dignan
Dignan doesn't look up from the machine
Anthony turns and walks away
You got another ball
Dignan watches him go
'm playing your game
They're walking fast down the sidewalk
The list, Dignan
know you remember the list because you signed it
"Things Dignan was not supposed to touch
" Every valuable item in the house was on that list
That doesn't make any difference bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday
They have a very special value for her
Yeah, but  can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary
There's just not time for it
Then you shouldn't of gone in there, Dignan
Maybe we should of robbed your house
Did you ever think of that
Dignan stops walking
Anthony looks back at him
Pause
What
Dignan turns and starts walking the other way
Where are you going
don't appreciate you ridiculing me
How was  ridiculing you
You're making fun of my family
You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig
You know exactly what you're saying
That's not what  meant, Dignan
They both see something
They keep walking
Dignan looks back down the sidewalk
Did you see that
Yeah,  saw it
'm lookout
Dignan, it's got an alarm
don't think so
Just reach on in
That sets it off
No, just do it real quick
(starts down the sidewalk) 'll meet you down there
Dignan cuts into an alley
Anthony turns back
Looks at a parked car
Looks left and right
Walks to the car and reaches in the half-open window
An alarm goes off
Anthony unlocks the door and opens it
Leans inside
Grabs a wallet off the seat
standing on the sidewalk watches Anthony get out of the car
Anthony looks at him, then walks down the sidewalk not too fast
He turns down an alley and runs
Anthony comes around the corner and meets Dignan beside a dumpster
The alarm is still ringing in the distance
Anthony starts looking through the wallet
It had an alarm
Yeah,  heard that
(counting the money) Five, seven, eight dollars
He looks at Dignan
(taking the wallet) Holy shit
What'd  tell you
Eight dollars
That's not bad
Anthony keeps looking at Dignan
Dignan smiles
He hands Anthony a five dollar bill
Anthony looks at it
He takes it
He puts it in his pocket
Dignan puts out his hand to shake
Anthony waits a second
He shakes Dignan's hand for just a second and walks down the alley
Dignan smiles and walks behind him
Anthony and Dignan are sitting at a table with Bob
What do herbs have to do with it don't understand the -- Pot is an herb
It's just like any type of gardening
How much could you grow
Realistically
As much as  want
When these plants bud 'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed
Six thousand dollars
Come on, Bob
You should take a look
have an entire crop in my backyard
In your backyard
How do you protect them
It's private property
Plus  have Hector
Hector woudn't do anything
But he's got a loud bark
That's the most important thing is a loud bark
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them
Good question
Bob looks at Anthony and Dignan
He suddenly gets worried
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants
You're paranoid, Bob
Yeah, but don't tell anybody
Could you grow cinnamon
don't know
Sure,  guess
You could make your own cinnamon toast
Bob looks at Anthony for a second
He looks at Dignan
Back at Anthony
Are you a fag
You're the faggot
Bob turns around to see  , short but muscular, wearing a down vest and a baseball cap
Little Richard
don't believe it
They'll let anybody in this place
Sit down
Little Richard sits down
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard
He's crazy
Totally nuts
(smiling) don't know about that
Little Richard
Trust me
You're insane
Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk
You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets
It seemed like a good idea at the time
The one and only Little Richard
Are you named after  Little Richard
(stares at Dignan) Ha
Ha
Ha
Why don't you stick it up your ass
Great group of guys you're hanging out with
Little Richard goes out the door
What was that all about
can't believe you said that
What did  say
told you he's crazy
But he didn't say anything
Hang on a second
Dignan gets up and walks out of the restaurant
Anthony and Bob look at each other
They start to get up
Anthony and Bob go out the door
Dignan is walking over to a station wagon
Little Richard is getting in
Little Richard
Wait a second
Hang on
didn't mean to -- Little Richard opens his door hard into Dignan's legs, then gets out fast and takes off his shirt
Dignan tries to hit him but doesn't connect
They grab onto each other and start knocking around
Another  gets out of the station wagon
Two more  rush out the door of the burger place
Anthony and Bob stand back, nervous
Let them fight
Let them fight
They all watch
Dignan keeps trying to punch Little Richard, but he's hanging onto him too tight
They keep spinning around together, moving down the sidewalk
(calling out) Anthony
Anthony looks at the other guys then moves toward Dignan
Break it up
Break it up
Little Richard lets go of Dignan
They separate
separated my shoulder
Dignan is holding onto his arm
He kind of moans
Hang on
Anthony grabs hold of Dignan's arm
Everybody's watching
Just pull straight up
Anthony pulls up hard on Dignan's arm
Dignan tries not to yell, then suddenly he's  and relieved
Is it back in
(moving arm slowly) Yeah
#1 , man
Let's go
No
'm not fighting anymore
His shoulder went out, man
It's over
#2 You guys better get out of here
Guy #2 pushes Dignan
Anthony turns and pounds him in the face
Right on the nose
The guy goes crosseyed
He falls down with his legs all tangled-up in a strange position
Everyone stands there stunned
Anthony takes a step back
He looks up
He and Dignan take off
Bob stands there
Frozen
Everyone looks at him
Bob looks at Little Richard
Bob
Bob takes off
The next day
They're driving with Bob
Dignan's up front
He's banged-up from the fight
The guy is fucking insane
warned you, Dignan
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob
Like he's wild
No,  was saying crazy like a lunatic
know that now
He's a fucking psycho
Well, don't blame me
told you
do blame you, Bob
And woah
Look at her
There's a beautiful  on the sidewalk
They drive past her
Loop around real fast
Just turn right here
Bob immediately turns and they drive past the girl again
They don't say anything as they go past her
They all just look at her
They drive on
: minute later
They've looped back
They're looking for the girl
Where'd she go
Maybe she turned
There she is
She's on a side street
Bob hits the brakes hard
The girl looks back at them
They back up a few feet and turn down the street
They drive slowly toward the girl
Bob, don't be so obvious
The girl keeps looking back at them
think we might of scared her
Let's just go
They come up, beside the girl
She looks right at them, still walking
Her expression is angry and also a little scared
They drive away
You blew it, Bob
Anthony, Dignan, and Bob are meeting with
Temple is in his mid-fifties, short, heavy, completely expressionless wide face
They listen intently as he briefs them on the intricacies of firearms
gun is a firearm
pistol is a firearm
But anything you hold in your hand is a weapon
knife wrench
ballpoint pen
ballpoiht pen
Anyone who tells you a ballpoint pen is not a weapon needs intensive psychiatric treatment
You can stick them in the esophagus
You give them a ballpoint tracheotomy
They nod seriously
Temple laughs
They're standing behind Temple's car in the middle of an open pasture
The trunk is open
Temple's got some guns in metal cases
They draw targets on pieces of paper
Anthony draws a man running on his target
They fire a bunch of different pistols
The last one they shoot's a
44 Magnum
They buy it
' The  room
There are two big couches and a nice giant
The doors are open onto the balcony
The
44 is on the coffee table
Dignan is sitting there with a map and some diagrams laid out
Anthony and Bob are on either side of him
Dignan's pointing at a notebook page with the heading "Escape Route
" Escape route
The most important thing you can have is an escape route
Just in case somebody's tailing us
Or even chasing us, as the case may be -- You think we're going to be chased
That's a good question
No
don't
'm just being hypocritical here
However,  will say -- Bob reaches for the
44
(quietly) 'm going to take a look at this
(puts hand on gun) Hang on This is important, Bob
Anthony and  are responsible for the internal situation
The money and the people
You're responsible for the external situation
The streets and the getaway
(nods) That's my responsibility
That's your domain
Anthony is making a little man out of a scrap of paper
Now
One thing we need to discuss is timing
Timing is absolutely crucial
What are you doing
Anthony
(looks up) Nothing
Go ahead
Bob picks up the gun
(to himself) How many bullets can that hold
Dignan grabs the gun away and sets it down out of Bob's reach
Bob
'm paying attention
just want to look at it for a minute
(screaming) What's your fucking problem
You're a shithead
just want to see how much bullets it takes
Anthony picks up the gun off the table
He clicks the action
Anthony, give me the fucking gun
(pulling away) No, Dignan
It's not your gun
It's all of ours
(quietly) paid for it
God
Dignan stands up, grabbing his papers
You two just don't give a shit, do you
Dignan starts out of the room
Anthony stands up
Dignan, calm down
(turns back, screaming) You're out
'm not working with either one of you
Dignan
Stop
Dignan stops
Looking at Anthony
Calm down
Take a deep breath
(pause) You're right
You're right
Dignan sits back down and starts spreading out his papers again
Freezes
Looks at Bob
Bob's looking at the gun
Bob looks at Dignan
Bob looks away
Nobody moves
Anthony and Dignan have moved outside to the hot tub
Anthony pets Bob's dog
Bob's brother walks up the path from the driveway with his blonde cheerleader
What are you guys doing
Nothing
We're just -- You seen my brother
He's inside
Future Man goes inside
His girlfriend stands there on the deck
(smiles) Hi
& Hi
She stands there, looking across the yard
Anthony and Dignan sit there in the hot tub, looking around
We hear Future Man's loud voice inside: Goddammit, Bob
Get your shit together
Future Man comes back out
He stops by the hot tub
What are you guys up to tonight
Nothing much
Just hanging around
Future Man walks back out the gate
Bye
She follows Future Man
Anthony and Dignan watch them walk away
Bob comes back out with some drinks
He looks shaken
What'd Future Man want
Bob shrugs and gets in the hot tub
They sip on their drinks
Bob's got a Heineken
He doesn't get it
Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here
It's too dangerous for him
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob
It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing
Yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you
The only nut with a gun is going to be Dignan
Anthony gets out of the hot tub and dives in the pool
(whispering, very serious) You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone
He electrocuted our janitor senior year
He electrocuted someone
It was an accidental
don't want to go into the details
It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right
mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead
That's why Anthony never graduated
His name was Swifty
Yeah
One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know
That's too bad
(nods) You know, when somebody gets electrocuted, their skin starts smoking
At least Swifty's did
Anthony, Dignan, and Bob are sitting in Bob's car, parked in the dark
Bob's at the wheel
Anthony and Dignan are in the back
Anthony has on a dark blue ski cap
Dignan's wearing a baseball cap with the brim pulled down low
He puts a piece of adhesive tape across his nose and hands the roll to Anthony
What are you doing
'm putting a piece of tape on my nose
Anthony tapes his nose
They stare out the windshield
The alarm on Dignan's digital watch goes off
(immediately, dead serious) Let's get lucky
/ Anthony and Dignan walk through the shadows in front of a huge bookstore
The lights are on inside
They watch for a minute and then go to the front door
Dignan hides behind a post
Anthony knocks on the glass
An  appears
left my sweater inside
The employee shakes his head
He can't hear through the glass
Do you have a lost and found
The employee unlocks the door and opens it an inch
We're closed
left my sweater in there
Oh
see
Come on in
Anthony goes inside
Dignan comes out from behind the post
We're closed, sir
Where's that guy going
He left his sweater
Well,  left some money in there
Where
(pulls out the gun) In the cash relister
Step away from the door
Dignan goes in
They walk through the store
Where's the manager
Where's the other stocker
There's another stocker, right
We know there's another stocker
Rob
Dignan points the gun at the employee
Where is he
Where is Rob
don't know
Maybe in literature
That's his section
You got that
Sure
Literature
The classics
The  is locking the door of his office
Is that the manager
(to manager) Unlock that door
(to Anthony) Check the aisles
Anthony starts walking through the store, checking down each aisle
He picks up a copy of The Air War on Hitler's Germany and takes it with him
He goes through literature and sees in travel, kneeling in front of a low shelf with a carton of books beside him
Rob
(looks up, a little puzzled) Uh-huh
Why aren't you in literature
(hesitates) It's all full up
Dignan is in the office with the manager and the first employee
He's pointing at a drawer
Open it up
The manager opens it
It's full of office supplies
Open the other
Let's go
The manager opens the other drawer
It's full of cash
Dignan looks at the manager
He looks back at the cash
Put it in one of those
Dignan points at some bookstore bags
The manager picks up a little one and starts to put the money in it
bigger one, you idiot
(glares at Dignan) Don't call me an idiot, you punk
'm sorry
But that bag's too small
: Anthony waiting outside the office door
Rob, the first employee, and the manager are sitting against the wall in the office
The manager's got an intense, angry look on his face, staring at Dignan
Dignan hands Anthony five little bags full of money and starts to close the office door
, guys
Just
Sit tight
Dignan closes the door
Anthony and Dignan jump into the car
Go
Go
Drive slow
Bob drives
Pretty slow
Anthony and Dignan keep looking back out the rear window
They're nervous
Nobody says anything for a block or two
What happened
Shhh
Slow down, Bob
Drive natural
This is natural
(looks at speedometer) That's good
Keep it at forty
Did we get it
Be cool, Bob
Be cool
(quickly) Make that light
They keep driving
Breathing hard
Holy shit
We got it
We got it
How much is there
Don't count it
picnic table in front of a hamburger place
Dignan is standing up with his drink in his hand
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag
No
was calm
What about what that guy said
Oh, shit
That was scary
In the middle of the robbery
The manager looks at me
Right in the eye
And goes, 'm going to remember you
Are you serious
Yeah
He said that
swear to God
In a very quiet voice
Like he meant it
Yeah
Like he would find Dignan
One day
Like 'm going to hunt you down and kill you
Dignan stands there a minute and lets this sink in
Then he finally sits down and they all eat their burgers
You really think he'll remember you
(smiles) No
All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose
They laugh smugly
7-11 Anthony, Dignan, and Bob come out of a 7-11
Bob's got a slurpee
He's carrying the  book
See you
See you, Bob
Hang on, Bob
Dignan goes up to Bob and hugs him
Bob's not smiling
That was really good driving
Seriously
mean it
Bob nods and starts walking away, down the sidewalk
We'll see you later, Bob
Good driving
Anthony and Dignan sit on the curb
Anthony's drinking a milk
Dignan's still watching Bob walk alone down the sidewalk
What's wrong with him
What do you think
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress
He got what he deserved
He was the driver, Dignan
He did what he's supposed to do
didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings
Considering  did the plans, you're actually lucky you got -- Don't even say it, man
' Dignan and Anthony are following Bob through his house
Bob is playing his electric guitar, not plugged in
Bob, will you please listen
don't want to talk about it
Bob strums more intensely
They're walking through the kitchen
Look,  admit  was wrong for not telling you before the robbery that your share wouldn't be as equal as ours
But the fact remains me and Anthony were much more exposed to danger
Bob has now come to the big glass patio doors where Hector sits outside, looking in
Bob keeps playing as he looks at Hector
mean, Jesus Christ, Bob
You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "'m going to remember you
" (smiles slightly, keeps playing) That's true
That would give me nightmares
Bob, 've got nightmares
Bob stops playing
He looks at Dignan
You'll probably have them the rest of your life
What was that
Anthony opens the door to the patio
What
They hear breaking glass somewhere as they follow Anthony onto the patio
voice yells out
Motherfucker
What's going on
Bob sets down his guitar as they go out of the yard to see what's happening
' Anthony, Dignan, and Bob go around to the front
Bob's neighbor  runs down the driveway with a wrench in his hand
Phil is short and heavy, wearing a golf shirt
He's got a bloody nose
Phil
What happened
(hysterical) Motherfucker
'll kill him
(looks around, suddenly concerned) Who
'  comes running out the front door
' 've called the police
Oh, my God, Phil
She reaches to hug him
Don't touch me
swear to God 'll get that guy
' know you will, Phil
There was nothing you could do
All you had was a golf club
You're bleeding, man
Sit down
couple of  have come over from across the street
What happened
' Some black man beat Phil up
He didn't beat me up
He attacked me
' He took two hundred dollars
(to Phil) Tilt your head back
Later
It's dark out now
There's a police car parked across the street and another pulling over, lights rolling
One of the  walks across the yard, shining a flashlight in the bushes
Dignan is talking with one of the other officers
He was probably on drugs
They usually are
Two other cops are getting a statement from Phil
Anthony and Bob are listening
Some neighbors are milling around talking
As soon as  opened the door  saw him
black guy
Looking through my dad's tool box
wanted to trap this guy
So  closed the garage door
And that's when he hit you
(looking up to sky and concentrating) He struck me
fell down
He took my wallet
Then he opened the garage door and ran away
How'd the window break
hit it with the golf club
Dignan's still talking to the other cop
How long do you have to go
26 weeks
And what does that cover
Social issues
Crime prevention
Hand to hand combat
Dignan suddenly looks toward Bob's backyard
The cop nods
Ground defense
Did you hear that
What
Shhh
Anthony's looking up into the treetops
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop
He loves them
There's a million places to hide around here
Oh, yeah
They'll never catch the guy
hope not
Phil probably provoked him
(looking at Dignan) Where's he going
Dignan and the officer are walking over to the backyard
No, it was a rustling sound
' The dog
Look out for the dog
Is this dog going to bite
No
Shit no
Dignan jumps the fence
The cop looks over and shines his flashlight
Dignan's petting Hector
Hector's calm
See
don't know what he's talking about
Bob starts walking across the street
Where you going
Move
As Bob walks away he is looking back, past Anthony, toward the backyard
What's wrong
Anthony turns to look
In the backyard
Dignan is looking in the bushes
He probably went into the next yard
Shine the light over here
Dignan looks across the yard at the officer
The officer is shining the light on the marijuana plants
He looks at Dignan
Those are
Dignan sprints across the yard and over the gate
Halt
Sir
Anthony and Bob are standing in the shadows across the street
They see Dignan come racing down the driveway
The officer is yelling behind the gate
Bill
He's running
The other officers are running from their cars
The prowler
That way
The officers run past Dignan, toward the back
Anthony and Bob take off as Dignan runs by
The three of them run full speed down the street, cutting across yards, between houses
They throw themselves over fences and scramble through bushes
Way to go, Bob
told you they were there
(about to explode) So it's my fault
Be quiet
' Bob's at the wheel, Dignan in front, Anthony in the back
They're driving fast down the interstate, past fields and farmhouses
Dignan's drawing out a route in felt tip pen on a Texaco roadmap
In all probability nothing would of happened
But why take the chance
That's why  ran
mean how many plants were even back there
Five
Ten
There were more than that
Why don't you just tell them the truth
Those belong to my neighbor Phil
don't know
personally don't need that shit in my life right now
Nobody does
Obviously
That's why we go on the road
The thing about cops is they have short attention spans
Dignan fills up the tank and checks the oil
Bob tests the tire pressure
Anthony does the windows
Can  get that credit card from you
(pause) don't like to use that credit card, Dignan
Why not
Because my mom gets the bill
She's not going to notice, Anthony
don't want to use it
(pause) Well, then cut it in half
keep it for emergencies
Anthony, we're on the run
This is an emergency
It's only fair that
Anthony gets in the car
Pause
Dignan reaches into his pocket and takes out a wad of cash
He counts some
Stands there a minute
Goes inside to pay
Anthony stretches out across the backseat on pillows, playing electronic football
Dignan reads Bob's  book
Bob eats a Ding-Dong and smokes a cigarette
fireworks stand on the side of the highway
The car's pulled over and they're buying roman candles, -80's, and Black Cats from a  wearing a baseball cap way back on his head
As they get back on the highway Anthony lights a roman candle and fires it from the window
Dignan lights an -80 and throws it out of the car
They drive to a big lake
dog splashes in and swims for a tennis ball
Anthony does some nice dives
Dignan swings from a rope out over the water and lets go
Bob sits on a bench
Late afternoon
They're driving on the interstate
Anthony's got a copy of Runner's World magazine
Here's mine right here
See
Anthony lifts up his foot so Dignan can compare his shoe with the picture
See if mine are in there
(looks at Dignan's shoes) Dignan, those aren't running shoes
Yes, they are
Look at the treads on those
What about them
They obviously weren't designed for racing
Well, those treads stink
You'd blow a knee out racing on those
Will you guys shut up
God
It's like having two little kids in the car
, Dad
Really
, Dad
But seriously, Anthony
These are fast shoes
You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan
(to Bob) In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for
That's real cool, Anthony
Yeah, wore boots
My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours
wasn't spoiled
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan
You were spoiled rotten
Enough
Jesus Christ
Anthony and Dignan are lined up to race on the side of the road
(yelling) You want to say it, Bob
Fifty yards away, Bob's sitting on the hood of the car parked on the shoulder
He's reading a magazine
He shakes his head without looking up
'll just say it
'll say it
Go ahead
On your marks
(waits a second, says very fast:) Get set go
They take off
Dignan has the jump, but Anthony pulls past him
car blows by going the other way and they keep racing
Anthony's out in front as they pass Bob sitting on the car
Bob's watching
Dignan raises his fists into the air
(points at Anthony) You owe me fifty bucks
Bob
Anthony won
Bob gets in the car
Bob wasn't even looking
/ Holiday Inn
Bandera,
Bob's car is parked in front
Inside: Dignan, Bob, and Anthony are checking in
There's a teenage  behind the counter
Dignan pays cash
The girl hands over the keys
She's looking at Dignan's shirt: Was that shirt made from a towel
What
(seeing his reaction) It's just terrycloth, isn't it
Yeah
think so
They're walking along the balcony, looking for their room
Anthony has on his backpack
Dignan's got his tennis bag
Bob's got two large suitcases, a carry-on, and a garment bag
Look, man
She didn't know anything about shirts
No, 'm not saying her
'm just saying,  don't know
It's a great shirt
Don't worry about it
They find the room and unlock the door
Driving in a small town
Bob's behind the wheel
Dignan's in front
Anthony's in back
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony
know
But once you get inside you're home free
Right
Get back to me on that one
Once your plan is worth a shit
It's not a plan
It's just -- Actually
If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up
True
There's a car stopped in front of them
couple of girls are standing beside it, talking to the driver
Bob can't get around
What the fuck is this
Dignan leans over and holds down the horn for about five seconds
The guy in the car sticks hi s hand out the window and shoots the finger at them
Dignan sounds dead serious: Ram him, Bob
Bob waits for a nervous moment
He does two quick honks
The guy's reverse lights go on
Hit him
Bob hits the gas and slams into the car
He puts his car in reverse and backs up a couple of feet
He leans forward and sees the back of the guy's car
It's all smashed up
The guy gets out of his car, shaken up, and looks at them
His expression is confused
Bob punches it and flies backwards down the street
The guy stands beside his car and watches them
Shit, Bob
What the fuck did you do that for
He wouldn't move
They go around the corner
Bob shifts into first and goes
Is he chasing us
don't know
Speed up, Bob
They're unlocking the door
They go inside
You think he got my license plates
He looked too shaken-up
'm sure he did
We'll have to get new plates
It's registered in my mother's name
(shakes his head) What the fuck possessed you
You're the one who kept saying ram him
Dignan's walking into the bathroom
meant tap him
As a warning
Dignan closes the door
Anthony lies down on one of the beds
Bob just stands there
The next day
Dignan and Bob are still asleep
Bob's on a folding bed
Anthony's sitting at the table, reading a newspaper eating some cereal from one of those little boxes where you cut open the sides
Ahthony's swimming laps
He stops and hangs onto the side for a minute
Across the pool he can see a good-looking Mexican  about twenty years old standing beside her cart looking at him
He waves
She waves and gets back to work
little while later
Anthony's sitting in a chair by the pool, letting the sun dry him off
He's wearing just a swimsuit
Dignan and Bob are fully dressed, standing beside him
Dignan,  can't get my hair cut
That's just not possible, all right
Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony
We've got to hide our identities
Especially after Bob crashed the car
Bob has no reaction to this
No, Dignan
'm sorry
can't do that
Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not
Silence
Well, Bob, Samson has decided that his hair is more important than our safety
(screaming) My friend, that is a reckless decision
Let's go, Bob
Dignan starts walking away
Bob
Are you coming
See you in a little while
See you, Bob
Anthony's wearing a bathrobe, sitting on one of the beds
The maid unlocks the door and looks inside
She sees Anthony and starts to go back out
No, it's
Come on in
She goes in and starts cleaning up
Anthony sits down in one of the chairs and makes conversation
It's hot out, isn't it
Yeah
This is a nice little town
So, what, do you do all these rooms yourself
Or what
'm Anthony
He puts out his hand
She shakes it
What's your name
Inez
Inez
She nods
Let me give you a hand with that
He helps her make the beds
Anthony walks with Inez from room to room, helpinq her clean up
How do you say nineteen
Dies y nueve
Right
Yeah
Yo soy dies y nueve
How old are you
Inez opens the door to one of the room
They go in to clean it
Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms
(laughs) No
It could happen
This is the exact kind of place where it happens
But don't want to scare you
Anthony picks up a magazine off somebody's suitcase
He flips through it
Inez takes it out of his hands and puts it back on the suitcase
Inez is putting a new bar of soap in the shower
Anthony picks up some wet towels off the floor
It's cramped in there
People think because they're in a hotel they can act like a slob
It's bad manners
Inez takes the towels
She pulls the shower curtain shut
Were you born in Mexico
Cuba
Oh, really
That's interesting
Do you prefer Cuba or the United States
Inez is trying to get out of the bathroom but Anthony's in the way
Scuse me
Inez is pushing the cart
Anthony has his hand on the cart
These towels are still warm
He picks one up and holds it to his face
guess from the dryer
He hands the towel to Inez
She holds it to her face
've never met anybody from Cuba before
Inez says a few sentences of very fast Spanish
Anthony nods
Inez knocks on the door of a room
Housekeeping
about thirty-five years old opens the door
We're just checking out
The woman goes back into the room
Inez follows her
The woman's packing a bag on the bed
Anthony comes in
The woman looks at him
8he's about to say something when Anthony takes the liner out of the trashcan
The woman's comes out of the bathroom
Anthony picks up some stuff off the floor
Hi
Hi
Anthony follows Inez into the bathroom
The husband looks at his wife
Diqnan's sitting in the waiting area of a barbershop reading a newspaper
We can see Bob out the window, talking on a pay phone
He hangs up and comes inside
You can go first, Bob
My brother's in jail
What are you talking about
They're standing next to the spinning striped pole
The weed
But it's not his
How can they arrest Future Man
They said he's a drug dealer
Bob looks off into the distance
Sickened
Those assholes
We got rapes
Murders
Violent crimes every second
And this is what they come up with
(shaking his head) They're just fucking him because he's from a prominent family
They're sitting at a table, waiting for their order
don't think they can make it stick, Bob
mean, what do they actually have on Future Man
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start
That could be anybody's
They also found my two beam scale in the garage
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house
Everybody has a scale
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana
So tell them the truth
What do you use it for
(pause) was just going to use it to see how much  had
Dignan mulls this over for a minute
How long has he been in there
don't know
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet
That's unconstitutional
We'll have to see when we get back
Dignan looks at Bob for a minute
What do you mean get back
(pause) Well, obviously, we got to go back
Bob, that makes no sense
Dignan, he's my brother
can't just leave him there
This could be a trap
Come on, Dignan
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me
'm going back
(louder) Not in that car you're not
Watch me
Good luck, since  got the keys
Bob glares at Dignan
Dignan shrugs
The waitress brings over some glasses of water, ice clinking
Nobody says anything while she sets them down
She walks away
Give me the keys, Dignan
can't do that, Bob
Dignan
You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt
Don't threaten me, Bob
Goddammit, Dignan
It's my car
If you don't give me my keys,  swear to God -- Dignan drives the car slowly alongside: Bob walking down the sidewalk, staring straight ahead
Dignan's, got his window down
Look, Bob
understand your loyalty
You're a good person
But right now you're not using your best judgement
Bob keeps walking
Future Man would not want you to go to jail  promise you
Just get in the car and we'll talk about it
No reaction
Bob keeps walking straight ahead
Future Man would never go to jail for you, 'll tell you that
His name's not Future Man, Dignan
know it's not
You don't even know his name
Yes,  do
What is it
Just get in the car, Bob
What's his name
, Bob
don't know his name
You know why
Because  don't care
He's Future Man
But  care about you
And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime
Will you get in the car, Bob
This is stupid
Bob stops walking
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan
That's right
only have one vote
We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out
Pause
Bob gets into the backseat
Dignan looks back at him for a minute
You're going to ride in the back
Bob nods and looks out the window
Come on, Bob
Get in front
Bob exhales and gets out
He gets in up front
Dignan looks at him for a minute
You've got a beautiful walk, Bob
Let's go
Dignan and Bob open the door and go in
Inside: Inez and two other Hispanic  are sitting at the table by the window
One's about seventeen and a little heavy, the other's in her mid-thitties
There's a bunch of glasses and a bottle of rum on the table
One of the maids is cutting up a banana
Inez smiles at Dignan
Dignan looks puzzled
Hi
How's it going
Suddenly there's a loud crunching, grinding sound
Dignan and Bob are startled
They look around the room
The sound stops
Anthony comes out of the bathroom carrying the pitcher from a blender
It's full to the top with yellow liquid
He sees Dignan and Bob and stops
Pause
thought you guys went to get your hair cut
No
We didn't
Silence
We're making banana daqueris
Anthony holds up the pitcher
Dignan looks at it
Nods
Pause
This is Inez
Carmen
Anita
Hi
Inez, this is -- Jerry
(pointing to Bob) And this is my associate Cornelius
strange expression crosses Bob's face
May  have a word with you, please
Sure
Outside the room
Dignan closes the door
There's three housekeeping carts in the hall
What the fuck is going on here
What
What's the matter
Anthony, we're on the run from the law here
Did you tell these people your real name
No
didn't
Dignan, they don't speak English
They don't
No
Not really
Inez speaks a little
Which one was that
On the left
Dignan cracks open the door and looks inside
She's from Cuba
No kidding
Dignan
(closes the door) Anthony
Bad news
They walk around the motel
How long are they going to hold him
don't know
don't know anything
Except Phil says they got him
And he's in jail
He needs to hire an attorney
No, no
Look
Let's stay here until we find out what's going on
Anthony,  -- And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back
All right
Now that makes sense
We'll hang out for a couple of days
Get a little &
Make sure Future Man's and then get back on the road
As long as he gets out
Obviously
That's a given
Bob
What
Is that
Pause
Bob looks at Dignan
Looks at Anthony
(shrugs) Yeah
guess so
They shake hands and start back to the room
See, now we've got a plan
Don't worry about it, Bob
Anthony, Dignan, Inez, Carmen, and Anita are sitting crowded around the little table by the window in the motel room
They've got banana daqueris and a bottle of wine
Moonlight comes through the window
Bob is standing up in front of them with a banana daqueri in his hand
He's singing a blues number acapella
He's got a good voice
Dignan and Bob are playing slapjack with Carmen and Anita
Everyone's got their hands ready as  Carmen turns one card then the next
Bob's having a conversation in fluent Spanish with them about Las Vegas
He's talking about the rules at different casinos: Bally's, Caesar's, the Desert Inn
Dignan's paying close attention to the deck
jack comes up and he slams it
There's a light in the pool
Anthony and Inez are swimming
Anthony swims around her with his eyes just above the water
He goes under and comes up grabbing onto her
She laughs
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony
(passionate) God, yes
Like silk
Inez starts to giggle
What
(starts laughing) What
Like silk
God
That does sound corny
Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky
But it really kind of does
He kisses her
No lifeguard on duty
Swim at your own risk
They look up
Dignan's standng at the other side of the pool
He smiles
You know,  did save Anthony from drowning once, Inez
Tell her, Anthony
: Dignan sitting with his feet in the pool
Anthony and Inez are sitting on the steps beside him, in the shallow end
See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr
Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious
had to dive in and save him
This was in fourth grade
Mr
Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation
've never said this before, but frankly  thought Anthony was dead
The veins in his face were all sticking out
His skin was blue
He truly did look dead
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again
They blamed my family for everything
They always said Mr
Langston saved Anthony's life
Dignan stares wistfully across the pool
Anthony looks at him for a minute
But if it wasn't for Dignan probably would of died
(nodding, whisper voice) Yes
It's true
They're all quiet for a minute
Inez hangs onto the side
Bob's sitting in the room by himself, close to the , watching a war movie
The next morning
Dignan bursts out the door of the motel room
He runs across the parking lot
Son of a bitch
Dignan runs back into the room
He comes out with Anthony
He's gone
He stole the car
Where was it parked
Right here
Anthony looks around the parking lot
That coward
Son of a bitch
Maybe he just went to the store
He took his stuff
He's gone
(pause) should of seen this
should of expected it
Bob doesn't have any character
Anthony puts his hands in his pockets
Looks out at the highway
He went back for his brother
We said 48 hours
That's a long time to be in jail
They stand there in the empty parking lot
Anthony goes inside
In the room
The blinds are pulled
Anthony's sitting at the end of a bed
Dignan's pacing around the room
We'll get him
Don't worry about that
We'll go back
We'll find him
And we'll blow up his car
Or do something
promise you
Anthony gets up and walks to the bathroom
He shuts the door
Dignan follows him over to the sink and sits on the counter
mean, let's face it
Bob was dead weight
We're a lot better off without him
(pause) But who could expect it
Just like that
Steals the fucking car
What kind of person pulls that -- Anthony opens the door and walks out
Bob didn't steal the car
He told me he was going
He had to go help his brother
Anthony sits back down on the bed
Dignan's shocked
When'd he tell you
This morning
Where was
You were asleep
He told you and you let him do it
He told me because he wanted to know if  wanted to go
(hesitates) If you wanted to go
What were you going to do
Just leave me here by myself
Well,  didn't do it, did
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real suprised, that was just an act
You were just -- Bob went to help his brother understand that and  can't help it if you don't
understand that if  had a few more friends like you and Bob 'd be dead
If you say so
Anthony and Dignan are sitting at a booth
Anthony's got a roadmap spread out on the table
There's a long silence
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now
Of course 'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped
didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan
Well, the world is a little bit colder today
Anthony sits there thinking for a second, stating into space
Then he looks back at his map
He draws some lines in two different colors of felt tip pens
You want to look at the map
Pause
Dignan kind of looks at the map, without leaning forward
Anthony turns the map more in Dignan's direction
Dignan leans forward, looking
See
Here's where we are
They look at the map for a minute
Dignan looks out the window
didn't know he had it in him
(pause) guess you could say the child has become the father of the man
/
/ Anthony runs down the sidewalk, cuts across the street, and goes around the side of the motel
He pulls off his jacket as he goes up the stairs
He spots Inez's cart
He walks over to the room she's cleaning
She's in there making the bed
Anthony closes the door and grabs her by her belt
She's laughing and he pushes her onto the bed
He unbuttons her dress
She jerks a sheet out of the way
It swings in the air
Then we see Anthony and Inez walking down the sidewalk
He's got one arm wrapped tight around her shoulders and she's got hers around his waist
They're talking while they walk, going past people in the town
They watch each other walking reflected in a window
Dignan is doing the butterfly in the pool
Anthony and Inez walk over and wait for him at the end of the pool
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going
No
'm going to swim
'll see you later
Dignan treads water
Inez looks at Anthony
Why don't you come with us
Dignan gets out of the pool
Anthony, Dignan, and Inez are drinking beers with limes and salt
The mood is good and they're getting drunk
Anthony and Inez dance
Then Dignan and Inez
Mexican-style, stomping their feet and clapping
There's a scruffy dog in the bar and he barks at the dancers
Anthony kisses Inez and they whisper to each other
Dignan orders another beer and moves over to the pool table
skinny Mexican  puts his arm around Dignan's shoulder
He's drunk and slurring his words
So's Dignan
Hello, my friend
You in the Army, yes
No
just have short hair
Is that your chiquita
No, my friend knows her
She Chicano, yes
Dignan nods
You like Chicanos
Sure
He says something in fast Spanish to the people at his table and they smile
Play pool
For one cerveza
Dignan nods
The guy racks up the balls
They start shooting
Dignan makes a hard shot
(smiling) You a good pool player
Got a little lucky
Where's your friend
He go with the chiquita
Dignan looks over to the bar
Anthony and Inez are gone
don't know
She is a good looking woman
Dignan ignores this
They keep playing
Dignan finally makes the eight ball
The man shakes Dignan's hand and holds on
Guess 'll get another Tecate
Si
Tecate
You like to fight
What
Fight
You know
He pulls Dignan in and with his other hand fakes a hard punch
No
Just pool
You Hoto
(pulls away) Fuck you
You a Hoto
(smiles) No
Me no Hoto
Tecate
Right
The bathroom is very small with one bare light bulb
Dignan stands at the urinal, muttering to himself
The door opens and Dignan turns around just in time to see the Mexican man throw a hard punch
He hits Dignan in the stomach, punches him in the face
Dignan goes down hard
The guy kicks him and curses in Spanish
Pinche cabrone
Puta madre
The bartender comes in with a bat in his hand and starts talking fast and angry in Spanish
The guy gets out
Dignan's sitting in bed, watching
He's got a fat lip and a big bruise over his eye
Anthony's sitting in a chair beside him
Inez brings over a glass of water and some ice in a washcloth
She gives the ice to Dignan for his eye
She puts the glass of water on the nightstand where there's some fast food layed out for Dignan: burger, fries, an apple pie
Inez goes into the bathroom, closes the door, and turns on the water
Anthony's sitting there with his hands clasped, not looking at the
can't believe he just jumped you
Can you hand me those french fries
Anthony hands him the fries
Dignan watches the
wish 'd been there
Would of been nice
Anthony looks at Dignan
Man
'm sorry
We just went for a walk -- don't really feel like talking about it
The only thing  feel like is getting the fuck out of this place
(pause) We need a car
For the first time Dignan looks away from the , at Anthony
have an idea for that
What
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she
(pause) Doesn't she
don't think we can do that
know we can
It's real simple
We go into a room, grab some car keys and -- What 'm saying is she wouldn't go for that
She doesn't need to know
(pause) don't know, Dignan
just -- Look
'm ready to get the fuck out of here
It's real torture for me to be here
Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans
Shh
No one to back me up
Now  have a good idea
So unless you come up with something better -- Dignan
can't do that
All right
just can't
The bathroom door opens
Then you better think of something
Inez comes back in
How are you, Jerry
(staring at ) feel great, Inez
(kisses her) 'll see you later
Inez goes outside
She closes the door
don't think we need any keys, Dignan
think  can hotwire a car for us
You don't know how to hotwire
Yes,  do
Bob taught me
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted
No, 'm serious
He made me a diagram
Dignan's standing on a corner alone
He looks sullen
Anthony walks down an alley
He goes past a beat-up convertible
He stops, hands in his pockets
He looks both ways
He cuts back to the car, opens the door, and slips inside
Anthony's behind the wheel
He hand signals a turn and pulls up next to Dignan
Dignan shakes his head as he looks at the car
He gets in
They drive through the town
The wind's blowing hard
Anthony smiles at Dignan
Dignan tries not to smile
: Dignan sitting in the parked car with the motor running
In the side mirror he's watching Anthony and Inez
Anthony's saying goodbye
He walks back to the car and gets in
He puts it in gear and they drive off
What'd you say to Inez
Anthony shrugs
"'ll come back for you
love you, Inez
" Anthony is silent
"'m going to take you away from all this windexing and making beds
" Silence
Dignan exhales and looks out the window
The car is on the shoulder, raised up on a Jack with the hood open
Anthony's looking underneath the car
Dignan's standing in the middle the road with his hands in his pockets
No cars in sight
Anthony starts messing around under the hood
He tests some wires and connections
He steps away from the car
Man,  don't know anything about cars
Dignan stares down the road
You really know how to pick them
Anthony walks over to Dignan
He stands beside him for a minute
think we better go home
Don't panic, Anthony
'm not
But there's -- You can't just run home every time things get tough
First of all, we've got enough dough to -- Our money situation is not good
(clapping him on the back) You're so spoiled
What is "not good" to you
Only a few hundred -- We've got sixteen dollars
That's not correct
Dignan stares at Anthony
Give it to me
Pause
Anthony reaches into his pocket and pulls out the money
Dignan takes it
He counts it
He looks at Anthony
Sixteen dollars
know
Where's the rest
Dignan stares at Anthony
Pause
had to give some to Inez
How much
$383
Dignan frowns slightly
Pause
He screams: What
Pause
Dignan runs at the car and kicks the door as hard as he can
It makes a big dent
He runs down the shoulder and grabs a big rock
He runs at the car and smashes the rock through the windshield
He stands still
He turns to Anthony
He walks back over to him, yelling
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper
What the fuck is your problem
She needed it
$500 tip
For the housekeeper
Her name's Inez
Stop calling her the housekeeper
That's what she is
know that
But -- You're in love with the fucking housekeeper
Shut up
What are you going to do, get married
Have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats
And go around scrubbing the -- Anthony slaps Dignan hard in the face
Stop
(pause) Now listen to me
Dignan punches Anthony is the face
Follows it up with one after another
Anthony ducks and puts his arms out
He falls on one knee
Dignan immediately turns and walks to the car
Anthony stands up
He's got a bloody nose
He stares at Dignan
Not angry
Just weary
Dignan pulls his tennis bag out of the car
He shuts the door and walks down the highway
Anthony walks to the car and takes out his backpack
He pulls it tight around his shoulders
He looks down the highway at Dignan
Then turns and walks the other way, into the distance
: cold day on a nice country club course
Anthony watches Bob hit a hard slide straight into the rough
Bob stands there in a frozen follow-through
Then he suddenly swings his club and hums it down the fareway
He starts to walk back to the golf cart
Bob, where you going
'm not playing any more golf
Why not
Cause 'm not getting any better
It's a waste of time
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob
It takes a long time to learn this game
You think 'm improving
(pause) Yes
You just got to stick with it
Bob looks down the fareway
He takes a deep breath and starts walking toward his club about twenty yards away
In the cart
Bob's driving
There's a brief silence
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to
No,  don't mind
know it must of been a bad experience
But it doesn't sound like it was your fault
Well,  didn't mean to electrocute him
But the whole operation was my idea
: Electronics wizardry
Splicing wires
Buzzing electrodes
filament lights up blue
Pliers and clippers rewire a circuit breaker, short out the
system, electrify doors and windows
Anthony continues in
() It took six months of research did all the wiring myself
Switched to
Doubled the voltage
Shorted out the generator
The whole school was shut down
() That's pretty complicated for a senior prank
() don't like that word prank, Bob
was trying to do something more than a prank
large school building
Tall oak trees and benches in the shade
Green and blue lights blink in the windows
White flashes and loud jolts of energy dance from room to room
Mozart plays in the distance
Students begin to swarm out into the yard
() wanted to create an event
Something everyone would remember
And at first it worked perfectly
The whole school was standing around outside
Kids running all over the place
Everybody laughing
Anthony and Bob are standing on the seventeenth green
Even the school custodian Swifty thought it was great
He kept laughing and shaking his head the whole time he tried to disconnect the generator
And then suddenly (snaps his finger) total silence except for Swifty hanging off the generator with his leg stuck to it being electrocuted
Anthony stares down the fareway
Actually he died of a heart attack brought on by the shock
He was an older guy
Anthony and Bob are driving back to the clubhouse
felt terrible
'd known Swifty since first grade
He was Dignan's medicine man for Indian Guides
They called each other Rattlesnake and Killer Whale
Whenever Dignan came to visit me he would act like he and Swifty weren't that good of friends, but that was just to make me feel better
The whole rest of the school had turned against me
' Anthony and Bob are sitting by the pool, drinking beers
Future Man's swimming laps even though it's cold out
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter
That's partly why  was in custody so long
Sixty days
Sixty days
Yeah
One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary
Prison tatoos
got to be pretty good
It's not like drawing on paper
: Future Man toweling off
He wears a Speedo swimsuit
He walks over to Bob and Anthony
Anthony's just finishing a drawing of a leaping jungle cat in black and red ink on Bob's shoulder
Future Man stops and looks at them with no feeling
(pause) It's a panther
Pause
Future Man looks at Bob
How's that 700 bucks coming
'm working on it
Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting
He walks inside
thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation
Three days sitting in a cell
(pause) Were you adopted, Bob
Why do you say that
Well, because you guys don't look alike
No
wasn't adopted
Long pause
Was Future Man adopted
Jesus Christ
No
Dignan and  are sitting in, a '72 Monte Carlo by the curb two houses down from Bob's
Applejack is a small black man with white hair
It's hard to tell exactly how old he is
Around sixty-five
There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack
The silver and the china
The crystal
And the grandfather clock
Goddammit,  bet that clock's worth ten grand
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car
It doesn't make any goddamn sense
Just settling an old score
You might say revenge
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail
We might have to take that chance
Cause  feel pretty strongly about this
Is that Buckethead
Anthony is walking Hector down the driveway
Get down
Anthony does some stretching exercises in the driveway
Is that him
Wait a second
They watch Anthony and Hector start down the street
That's Anthony
That's your friend Anthony
Yeah
What's he doing here
Looks like he's staying with Buckethead
That's what  figured
He's probably got his own room
Let's see where he's going
Applejack puts the car in gear
They drive slowly
Don't get too close
Anthony looks back
Stop
He saw us
Anthony keeps jogging with Hector
Wait
Did he see us
We're going too slow
It looks like we're following him
Anthony goes around a corner, down an alley
Speed up
They pull down to the end of the alley
Anthony and Hector are racing down the alley
Dignan gets out of the car
Anthony
Anthony looks back
He stops running
Wait up
Dignan jogs down the alley
He stops a few feet away from Anthony
Where you going
Anthony points down the alley
Just walking Hector
Dignan looks down the alley
He looks at Anthony
Pause
When'd you get back
Ah
Couple days ago
Pause
(under his breath) You want to shake hands
Anthony puts his hand out
They shake
Pause
Anthony looks down the alley
Who's in the car
That's Applejack
You want to meet him
Sure
They walk to the car
This is Applejack
They shake
Nice to meet you, Applejack
You're Anthony
Yeah
hear you're a good thief
Anthony shrugs and smiles
He nods
hamburger place with no other customers
Anthony, Dignan, and Applejack are sitting at an outdoor table
It's cold and their jackets are zipped up tight
'm just sitting at this bar drinking my drink when this fine chick walks by
She was a living doll
And the big motherfucker who came in with her sees me looking, when he walks by he steps on my foot
Doesn't say shit
Just takes a seat with his lady
Well, holler out to him, If  was as big as you, ain't no way in the hell you'd of stepped on my foot like that
He just laughed
He says, Little man, take your foot and put it in your pocket
said, No, how about  take my foot and  stick it up your ass
Man, we went to war right there
hit him so hard knocked his nuts in his watchpocket
But this motherfucker wouldn't go down
Then all the sudden, out of nowhere, Dignan came up behind him and smashed a bottle on his head
And that big old boy went down
That's how  met Dignan
Good cat to have on your side
He'll go to war with you
He don't give a fuck
Applelack and Dignan slap hands
Applejack would of got him anyway
This was just the quicker war
You really hit a guy with a bottle
Dignan takes a little notebook out of his pocket
Pretty much
He kind of fell into me
But wait a second
Dignan opens the notebook on the table
want you to look at this
What is it
It's big, Anthony
Real big
It's called Hinckley Cold Storage
What's Hinckley Cold Storage
Anthony, Dignan, and Applejack are standing in front of a massive structure with ladders and towers and huge doors
Applejack's car is parked behind them
There are trucks lined up along the loading docks
big sign says Hinckley Cold Storage
Mr
Henry has an inside source
We call him Steve
That's where we get our information
Who's Mr
Henry
You'll meet him this afternoon
He's helping us set it up
Did you ever hear of the
Cooper Trust robbery
(shakes his head) Uh-uh
Cooper Trust,in San Francisco
Uh-uh
Mr
Henry pulled that job in 1965
It's famous
Applejack was the wheel man
Did you use this same car, Applejack
Hell, no
This is a '72
was driving a '63 Pontiac
What exactly is this place
Freezers
Right
Freezers
Imported foods
Anthony stares at Hitckley Cold Storage
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz
Abdul-Shabazz
Just a nickname
Anthony, Dignan, and Applejack are standing on the sidewalk at the front door of an old warehouse
Dignan knocks on the door, then tries the bell
They all wait
What time did he say to be here
Right now
Dignan looks in the window
He tries the door
It's locked
can knock a man out with a six inch punch
What do you mean
Feel this
Anthony puts his hand up
Applejack does a short, hard jab
Anthony shakes his hand out
(whistles) You could give somebody a concussion
Let me feel that
Dignan puts his hand up
Applejack nails it
(grabbing his hand) Ow
Shit
drop of water hits Dignan on the head
He looks up
More water falls on him
He gets out of the way
Everyone looks up
There's a man on the roof
He laughs, hysterically
They stare up at him
How's the weather down there
(pause) Mr
Henry
Come on in
It's locked
No, it's not
Dignan shrugs
He goes over to the door
Mr
Henry pours some more water on him
minute later: a steel garage door opens and the man steps outside
He is tall, about sixty years old with white hair clipped short and a trim goatee
He wears black trousers, black shoes, no shirt, and a string of animal teeth around his neck
This is
He puts a towel around Dignan's shoulders and pats him on the back
Dignan
Good to see you
Good to see you Applejack
(looks at Anthony) Who are you
This is Anthony Adams, Mr
Henry
This is no good
Mr
Henry stares hard at Dignan
He looks to Anthony
He looks back to Dignan
This is no good, bringing him here
What are you thinking
What the shit, man
Are you crazy
Mr
Henry stares at Dignan
He looks to Anthony
'm pulling your leg
Abe Henry
They shake hands
Mr
Henry points to , a tall, older black man standing in the doorway
Rowboat wears a white windbreaker
This is my business manager, Rowboat
Nice to meet you
That's a sharp jacket
Thanks
The second floor of the warehouse is one huge room painted all white
Mr
Henry and Anthony are playing ping-pong
Dignan watches
Rowboat-and Applejack are on the far side of the room playing chess
It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle
It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong
That's ghetto play
Hold it like this
Anthony changes his grip
Mr
Henry serves
The ball clicks back and forth
They're both solid players
Anthony whips a shot crosscourt and wins the point
You know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent
Thanks
Mr
Henry serves
Anthony returns
Mr
Henry suddenly fires a scorching shot down the line
Anthony watches it click past him
He looks to Mr
Henry
Nice shot
Mr
Henry smiles
He looks to Dignan
Is he in
don't know
Are you in, Anthony
Anthony stands there silent
He looks to Applejack and Rowboat
He looks to Mr
Henry
Then Dignan
Yeah, 'm in
Mr
Henry puts down his paddle
Stares at Anthony
Smiles
, kid
Let's go talk about cops and robbers
The ground floor is crammed with cars
Some have been taken apart
Some are shiny and perfect
Anthony and Dignan walk among the cars and junk with Mr
Henry
They've each got coffee in a styrofoam cup
Every once in a while some cat comes to me
He wants to know how made it
How did  become a success
The first thing  tell them is: follow your instincts
Let your instincts guide you
The second thing  tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar
Grammar
What do you mean grammar
The basic grammatical rules of robbing
You mean like techniques
(nods) Technique
That's right
Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control
Seventy-five percent
Do you believe that
(pause) Yes,  do
On the roof of the warehouse
They're standing near the edge, looking out
Mr
Henry is smoking a joint
He's got on a black beret
Anthony and Dignan are listening to him talk
On the other hand you got to have the right equipment
don't care if you're Harry Houdini
You can't pick a lock without a hairpin
Dignan nods
'd like to live in that place
Hinckley Cold Storage
Yeah
Convert it into lofts
Pop quiz
What's the single most important aspect of your job
The grammar
Crowd control
Crowd control
Wake up, guys
Oh, yeah
You're going to need a boxman for this one
But that can be arranged
You mean a safecracker
Yeah
And 'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali
Is he good
He's damn good
' is about sixty-five with white hair
He's short and wears a pale-green button-down shirt, dark trousers, and sandals
His room is small and has everything he needs in it
Books
Little
Possessions from all over the world
Kumar sits on his bed
Anthony and Dignan sit in wooden chairs
Kumar stares out the window
They sit for a long silence
So what do you think of the plan, Mr
Kumar
Kumar shrugs
Pause
We'd love to have you on the team
Kumar nods
He looks at a plant growing by the window
Silence
What is that
An orchid
Kumar shakes his head
Sighs deeply
Long pause
Kumar suddenly stands up and unbuttons his shirt
He throws it on the bed
He undoes his trousers and takes them off
Anthony looks at Dignan
Kumar takes off his socks, then his shorts
He is naked
He walks over to his dresser and takes out a small satchell
He looks around the room
Right at Anthony
He walks quickly toward him
Anthony gets nervous
Kumar grabs Anthony's shoulder and lifts him up a little
He pulls a towel out from underneath Anthony
He puts his hand on Dignan's shoulder as he walks to the door, into the hall
Good plan
He goes out
Anthony and Dignan sit there for a minute
They're a little disoriented
What do you think
(nods) He seems pretty good
' The foyer of Bob's house
The doorbell is ringing
Bob walks in wearing a velour robe
He opens the front door
Anthony and Dignan are standing on the dootstep
Dignan and Bob shake hands
It's a little awkward
Hey, Dignan
How's it going
Not bad
Come on in
What you been up to
Not a whole lot, Bob
They walk through the house
It's too bad about what happened on the road
Yeah
It is
Let's not even talk about it
It was stupid
Right
It was extremely stupid
don't expect an apology and don't even want one
just want us to -- can't fucking believe this guy
An apology, Bob
Man,  don't want to go into this
Yeah
Let's keep it -- Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail
You said 48 hours
never agreed to that
Bob, you're lying
Bullshit
All right
Backyard
Right now
Dignan walks straight to the back door and goes out
He stands on the deck
Let's go, Bob
Anthony gets up and tries to calm Dignan down
Dignan
Take it easy
Bob
Bob is slowly moving toward the back door
No, Dignan
This is stupid
Bob is standing just inside the back door
Yeah
Dignan
Look
Let's just -- Dignan grabs Bob's shirt and pulls him out the door
Stop, Dignan
Anthony breaks them up
He stands in front of Bob, shielding him
He doesn't want to fight
Get out of the way
No, Diqnan
This isn't -- Dignan gets around Anthony and lands a glancing punch
Come on
don't want to fight you, Dignan
Dignan, we're friends
Take it easy
Dignan lands another punch
He grabs Bob's shirt and pulls him around
Then he starts landing punches
One
Two
Then Bob nails Dignan in the shoulder
They grab onto each other and start fighting hard
They're about the same strength
After a couple of seconds Anthony tries to break it up
Dignan
Dignan
All the sudden Dignan stops fighting
All right
Stop
Dignan puts his arms around Bob
No fighting
Dignan turns to Anthony
There's tears in his eyes
No fighting
It wasn't Bob's fault
Easy, Dignan
It's
They all catch their breath for a minute
Dignan hugs Bob again
It wasn't your fault, Bob
You had your brother
didn't have any choice
They stand there another minute
'm sorry, Bob
That's
(starting to laugh) Shit, Dignan
(smiles) What the fuck are we doing out here
don't know, Dignan
You went crazy
'm sorry, Bob
That's
Look
We want you on the job
The restaurant at Bob's country club, People are dressed for golf and tennis
The waiters wear white jackets
and black bow ties
The whole crew sits at a big table by the front window
Let me get this straight
You don't play golf and you don't play tennis
So why do you belong to a country club
You got me
(shakes his head) You're a piece of work, Bob
black waiter about thirty-five, , stops by the table
How you doing, Bob
Hey, Jackson
How's it going
Jackson refills their water glasses
You keeping out of trouble
'm trying
(looks at others at table) This boy's a troublemaker
He used to tear this place apart
Mr
Henry laughs
Bob smiles sheepishly
Jackson stands there for a minute looking around the room
Your brother was up here the other day
He said you ran away from home
He said what
He said you ran away from home
No
didn't run away
went out of town
Jackson nods
Bob
Bob looks at Dignan
Dignan's looking across the room
There's Future Man and his friend  fresh from a round of golf
They're standing on the other side of the room, looking across at Bob
They're smiling
Jackson picks up two empty plates and walks away
Future Man and  walk to Bob's table
Fancy seeing you here, Bob
Yeah
Hey, Clay
Hi, Bob
(smiling) So what's shaking
Nothing much
Future Man looks at Anthony and Dignan
His smiles fades
How's it going
Fine, thanks
Future Man looks at the rest of the crew
His smile comes back
Mr
Henry smiles
John Mapplethorpe
(shaking hands with crew across table) How are you
Hi
Good to know you, John
Jackson says you told him  ran away from home
Clay laughs
Future Man smiles
might have mentioned it
John, 'm twenty-six years old didn't run away from home
know, Bob
You were on a secret mission
'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me
Right
'm sorry
(looks at Clay) You've got a reputation to think about
Clay smiles
Bob shakes his head
Mr
Henry stands up
Everyone looks at him
He's got a cold but calm expression
The world needs dreamers, son
What
The world needs dreamers
To relieve the pain of consciousness
Future Man nods
Pause
Mr
Henry doesn't sit down
Well, we'll see you later, Bob
Pleasure to meet you, John
(hesitantly) Nice to meet you
Future Man and Clay walk away
Mr
Henry sits down
hope this doesn't offend you, Bob
(looks closely at Bob) Your brother is a cocksucker
Bob smiles
They all smile
No
That doesn't offend me
Dignan's hidden in some bushes, watching the Hinckley Cold Storage building with binoculars
Anthony's crouched beside him taking notes in a notebook
Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door
He is entering a white van
What time is it
Eleven fifteen
Mark that down
did
Dignan keeps watching through the binoculars
He suddenly looks back at Anthony
God
Isn't this great
Working on the job
Got a wheel man
Got a safecracker
Good friends with Mr
Henry
Yeah
It's pretty good
It's like we've finally arrived
Anthony nods
He's writing something
What are you writing
Anthony shows him a little flip cartoon of a guy pole vaulting
/ We see the team assembled around a table
They're drinking coffee and looking at pictures, charts, maps, diagrams, tools
Dignan passes out some walkie talkies
They test out some smoke cannisters on the roof
Dignan throws one down
They all run for cover
Applejack and Dignan drive fast through a slalom course in a deserted parking lot
We see Kumar working on a safe
He wears a stethoscope and listens to the tumblers
He turns the dial
Dignan is timing him with a stopwatch
Kumar opens the safe
He looks at Dignan
Dignan nods with a serious expression on his face
Anthony and Mr
Henry are jogging along railroad tracks in the warehouse district
Anthony wears a blue -shirt and shorts
Mr
Henry looks like a boxer in grey sweats with the hood up and a crisp white towel wrapped around his neck and tucked into his sweat top
He's wearing black Chuck Taylors
They've both got smooth running styles, though every twenty yards or so Mr
Henry rolls his shoulders and gives a quick flurry of punches
An older woman rides a bicycle across the tracks
She's not pretty, but she's got a strong face
Pioneer stock
Look at that woman
She's what
Fifty
Fifty-five
But she hasn't let herself go
appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body
So do
They watch her ride down the street
Tell me something
What the hell kind of name is Dignan
'm not really sure
think it's Irish
Or maybe -- guess what 'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan
What do you mean what kind of person
He's a good person
Sure, sure
He's a great person, and 'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently
But  wonder if the kid has the goods (taps his temple) up here
(long pause) don't think you're giving him enough credit
know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through
He gets too excited
But -- As far as  can tell he hasn't thought his life through
He'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car
But business
(looks at Anthony) You  can work with
You  could groom
Dignan's not going to make it
Anthony stops running
Mr
Henry stops ahead of him and looks back, jogging in place
Pause
You're wrong about Dignan
Mr
Henry stops jogging in place
And you're wrong if you think, 'd turn my back on a friend
Hold it
Mr
Henry walks to Anthony and puts his hand on his shoulder
Anthony knocks it off
Anthony
want
to say one thing to you
Mr
Henry looks Anthony right in the eye
Congratulations
You passed the test
What do you mean
The Abe Henry double-cross test
You just made a perfect score
Anthony has to recover
That was a test
Take a deep breath
Anthony takes a deep breath
Mr
Henry massages Anthony's shoulders
He takes Anthony's head in his arms and does a quick pull to one side: cracks his neck
Then the other side
How does that feel
It feels good
Anthony rubs his hands on his neck and moves his head around
Did Dignan take the test
(pause) Yes, he did
How'd he do
They start jogging again
Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped
And he also agreed you were a liability
But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses
That sounds like Dignan
They veer away from the tracks, picking up the pace, and head into a field toward Mr
Henry's warehouse
They're having a party at Mr
Henry's warehouse
There are tables and a  on the roof, with white Christmas lights strung up and music playing
Anthony, Dignan, Bob, Kumar, and Mr
Henry are there
Plus a couple of young , eighteen or nineteen years old
Mr
Henry's got a name tag that says, Hi, my name is Mr
Henry
Everyone's mingling on the rooftop
Rowboat is at the grill
Applejack comes up the stairs with a grocery bag under his arm
Woah
There he is
Applejack
What it is
Mr
Henry and Applejack shake hands
Is my car  out there
love it
He always wants to know if the car's
Get a hot dog
don't eat pork
Super
Kumar
Come here
Mr
Henry goes over to Kumar and throws his arm around him
don't know why the fuck we're having a party
The damn job's not over yet
Well, this isn't really a party per se
You don't celebrate til it's over
True
Dignan's solemn for a minute
He takes a bite of a hot dog
What the fuck are you doing
Dignan hesitates
He takes the hot dog away from his mouth
He's embarassed
Applejack shakes his head, disgusted
He walks away
What was that all about
Ramedan
Anthony and Mr
Henry are standing together in a doorway
Mr
Henry's got a martini
'll tell you, Anthony
Times like this  get philosophical
What does it mean
What's it all about
Are you afraid to die
Me
No, that door over there
don't want to die
Are you afraid
Yeah
mean,  don't think about it all the time
But once in awhile kind of go, Woah
Man
Exactly
Woah
Death
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness
(taking a sip) Did you mix this martini
No
Bob did
Bob
Bob
That's a palindrome
(laughs uproariously) love palindromes
Are you afraid to die, Mr
Henry
(looks right at him) Anthony, 'm petrified
Bob is talking to the other girl
Is that sugarless gum you're chewing
2 'm not chewing gum
Would you like a piece
2 (smiles brightly) Sure
Thanks
Kumar and Applejack are sitting at a table
If someone could copy my life story
If  had someone, man, to just write what  talk
have so many stories
Bestseller, man
've been all over the Goddamn country
've seen things
used to go to Vegas and do headstands
No kidding
Easy
Kumar does a handstand
Anthony, Dignan, and Bob are sitting at the table in Mr
Henry's office
Dignan's got plans and diagrams spread out
There's music playing in the next room and we can hear people talking outside the door
Come on, Bob
know it, man
Hang on
Jesus Christ
Give him a second
Hopscotch
The code name is hopscotch
Good
Mr
Henry looks in the door
He's got a glass of wine in one hand and a bottle and empty glasses in the other
Join the party, fellas
We're just going over a few things
Mr
Henry looks at the plans on the table
He sets down the three glasses and pours some wine
'll tell you something, Dignan
It is possible to overplan
You don't want to turn the crew into robots
Right
Dignan nods seriously
You got to have fun with it
There's no point if you're not having any fun
Would you like me to be there tomorrow
Yes
(immediately) Why
Well,  think -- No, if  go out on this job, then it's just another score by Mr
Henry
And  don't see it like that
This is your job
Your creation want you to try this
They all try the wine
Mr
Henry watches their reactions
This is good
want to ask a favor, boys
One day, when 'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to Abe Henry
And remember me as a friend
They drink
Back on the roof
Bob and Dignan are sitting at a table with one of the girls
Applejack is dancing with another
Kumar's talking to Reudi
Anthony and Mr
Henry are standing at the edge of the roof, looking out at the city
Mr
Henry's smoking a joint
Well, that's just it, Anthony lot of criminals have problems
Some of them are alcoholics
Some have drug problems
Others dome from broken homes
see a real need for healing
Mr
Henry passes the joint to Anthony
Anthony smokes it
But you're thieves
It's what you are
Yeah
It's an esoteric journey
Anthony passes the joint back to Mr
Henry
We're renegades from despair
(nods) Can  ask you something, Mr
Henry
Absolutely
Why'd you want to help us
(inhales, pause, holding in smoke) Because  was like you once
And there was no one there to help me
Mr
Henry exhales the smoke
He hands the joint to Anthony
Anthony takes a hit
They stare out at the darkness
' Anthony and Dignan are sitting in the kitchen
Anthony's got on a t-shirt and boxers
Dignan's wearing a bathrobe
All the lights in the house are out except one in the kitchen
Anthony's drinking a glass of milk
Dignan's got orange juice
Next week we'll be drinking pina coladas
(nods) Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one
Dignan nods
Or  might end up with a broken nose
Did that hurt
Anthony shrugs
There's a long silence
This'll be a good trip
Anthony nods
Pause
He smiles slightly
'll try not to hold you back tomorrow
don't think you will
don't want to be too much of a liability
Look, you're going to do fine
It's to be scared
(laughs slightly, shaking his head) don't think  ever said this to you
But it meant a lot to me the way you were after that Swifty stuff happened
Silence
Dignan's a little embarassed
He was a nice guy
(shrugs) He was all right
They both sit there for a minute
Quiet
Anthony sips his milk
Do you like Inez
As a person
Yeah
As a girl
Yes
do
So do
Bob comes into the kitchen in his bathrobe looking haggard yet wired
Anthony and Dignan look at him
He goes to the refrigerator
He takes out a chocolate cake and a carton of milk
He pours himself a glass of milk
He goes over to the table with the cake and sits down
He cuts himself a piece of cake
He swallows two pills, one at a time, each with a long drink of milk
The pills are big capsules and he struggles a little when he swallows
You , Bob
(snaps) No, 'm having a heart attack
Of course, 'm
What's that supposed to mean
(pause) Nothing
was just asking
Jesus, Bob
Bob senses that's he's over-reacted
He backtracks
No,  know
'm just saying
feel fine
You want a piece of cake
(pause) Sure
Bob starts to cut him a piece
'll take one of those, too, please
Anthony is positioned behind some bushes, across from the building
He's wearing a black parka
He looks through some binoculars
Re pulls out his walkie talkie
Bird Dog to Scarecrow
Bird Dog to Scarecrow
() Go ahead, Bird Dog
You're all clear
() Roger
(pause) We all set
() Hang on a second
Anthony waits a second
We see Dignanr Applejack, and Kumar getting out of the car
(into walkie talkie) Let's do it
Dignan starts to move out
He remembers something
Says back into his walkie talkie: Let's get lucky, Bird Dog
Dignan, Applejack, and Kumar start across the parking lot
Dignan's got on a business suit
Applejack has on sunglasses
Kumar is carrying a leather satchel
They go in the side door and down a narrow passageway
They get into the freight elevator and go up
Bob's voice comes through on Dignan's walkie talkie
() Scarecrow
Yeah
We see Bob: standing on the loading dock behind the building
He's wearing an extremely heavy wool jumpsuit with a hood
Everything
() Yeah
We're in the elevator
How's it look back there
It looks pretty good
There's nobody back here
Stand by
Bird Dog
We see Anthony: still in the bushes
Uh-huh
() Take your second position
Roger
Anthony gets up and starts out across the parking lot, hands in his pockets, not too quickly
Dignan, Kumar, and Applejack get off the elevator
Six minutes
Applejack goes one way down the hall
Dignan and Kumar go the other
They turn the corner
They go down a wide passageway
Where did he go
Who
Applejack
Why did he go that way
(points back down hall) He's going to watch the back stairwell, remember
(pause) Don't worry about it
Dignan and Kumar come up to a door
Dignan slides a crowbar out of his jacket
He snaps open the door
They go in
It's a small office with a desk and a little safe in the corner
Dignan clears everything off the desk with one quick sweep of the arm
He puts down the briefcase and opens it up
It's full of tools
Kumar unzips his satchel and takes out a roll of tape
He immediately sets to work on the safe
Dignan steps back out the door and closes it
(into walkie talkie) Bird dog
You in position
We see Anthony on top of a fire escape, about four stories up
'm in position, Scarecrow
() Any activity
Not at all
The place is totally deserted
() Good
It's supposed to be
've got a great view up here can see all the -- () Stand by, Bird Dog
We see Dignan standing in the hall, outside the office
Jacknife
Come in, Jacknife
(pause) Hello
Bob
Are you there
We hear the sound of an elevator moving
(beat) Bob
What the fuck is going on
Anthony
Who's in the elevator
We see Anthony on the fire escape
don't know
() Check the fucking elevator
It's moving
Anthony goes in a little door
Down a passageway
Through a freezer
Into a corridor
Past the freight elevator, which is open on this floor
Then around a corner to a smaller elevator as it opens: Bob's inside
What are you doing
My walkie talkie's busted
1 can't tell what's going on
Let me see it
(fiddling with it) Did you drop it
No
Dignan's still standing in the hall as Anthony and Bob come around the corner
Dignan yells at them down the hall
What's happening
What's going on
It was Bob
His walkie talkie's busted
couldn't hear anything
Who's watching the door
What the fuck are you doing
Get back in position
The elevator starts whirring again
Who did that
What the fuck is that
It's going back down
(pannicking, into walkie talkie) Applejack
What's happening
() What
Bob
Get back in position
For just a second we hear the sound of music playing
Everyone freezes
, two of them in jumpsuits like Bob's, step out into the corridor
They've got bags from Jack in the Box
They're drinking drinks and shakes
One of them is holding a jam box
They stop
Dignan pulls out his gun
Don't move
Get up against the wall
Anthony and Bob pull out their guns and hold them on the four guys
(into walkie talkie) They're back
Get down here
(not into walkie talkie) What are you doing here
We work here
Time
(checks watch) Two minutes
Simultaneously: Kumar opens the door
Applejack comes running down the hall with his gun out
Where'd they come from
The front stairs
(to Bob) Where were you
My walkie talkie broke
Applejack reaches in his pocket and pulls out a dark blue nylon stocking
He pulls it over his head
Dignan, Anthony, and Bob immediately do the same
Anthony's is red
Dignan steps into the office with Kumar
What's the story
Can't get it
It won't
(make s gesture) What can we do
Kumar looks at his tools
Moves them around on the desk
Fuck it
He goes back into the hall
Let's go
Fuck it
with a cart stop at the end of the corridor
Freeze
Nobody move
Get against the wall
Bob's gun goes off
Everybody looks at him
Dead silence
Bob looks around like it must have been somebody else's gun that went off
Jesus, Bob
didn't do anything
Applejack falls to his knees
He drops his gun
Applejack
Are you
Applejack clutches his arm and rolls onto his side
(shouting) What's wrong with Applejack
He's having a heart attack or something
(screaming) Let's go
Dignan throws down his smoke cannister
Bob and Anthony automatically throw down theirs
Smoke instantly fills the hall
The hostages stand completely clear of the smoke
They watch Anthony, Dignan, and Bob rush around blindly in the haze
Help me move him
Careful
Check his pulse
Anthony holds all the guys at gunpoint
Dignan and Bob carry Applejack down the hall, into the elevator
Is he breathing
think so
An alarm starts ringing
Jesus Christ
What the fuck is that
didn't think there was an alarm
Take him to the car, Bob
Dignan runs back down the hall to Anthony
Who tripped the alarm
It's the fire alarm
Somebody pulled the fire alarm
Where's Kumar
(looking around) don't know
Jesus Christ, Anthony
Did you lose him
He's in the freezer
What
He went in there
What for
The guy on the floor kind of shrugs
Anthony crosses the hall
He pulls open one of the big freezer doors
Kumar is standing there with his bag and the briefcase
You can see his breath in the air
What are you doing
Let's go
Come on
They go down the hall to the freight elevator
They start down
What were you doing in there
Kumar shakes his head and shrugs his shoulders
They go out the front door, across the parking lot
Kumar's lagging behind
Wait for Kumar
Come on, Kumar
They come up to the car
Anthony tries the door
It's locked
Bob comes running around the side of the building
The elevator broke
Where's Applejack
He's stuck between two floors
You're kidding
Applejack's stuck in the elevator
Yeah
Who's got the car keys
Everyone looks at everyone else
Applejack drove
(pause) Run
Run
Let's go
Bob takes off at a sprint
Kumar follows him
Jesus, Dignan
Anthony pulls off the red stocking and throws it down
He tries the other doors on the car
What the fuck happened to the the plan
Dignan pulls off his stocking
Anthony starts walking fast across the parking lot
Dignan stands still by the car
Staring straight ahead
Come on
'll see you there
What
'll see you there
What are you talking about
'll get him
There's not enough time
Yes, there is
Let's get organized
Dignan starts toward the building
Anthony moves after him
Dignan, it's too late
don't think so
Dignan and Anthony look at each other for an instant
Dignan turns and sprints back into the building
Anthony stands alone in the parking lot
: a bedroom with big French windows
No furniture
: a wood-panelled study
Stripped bare
: an elegant dining room
Cleaned out
' in a moving company uniform carries a Louis  chair out the front door of Bob's house, down the path to the street
Two other  pass him on the way
They've got a dolly
The guy carries the chair into a huge moving van
It's full of furniture and paintings
Mr
Henry and Rowboat are standing in the street
Rowboat's smoking a cigarette, writing on clipboard
Hector stands behind them in the grass
Mr
Henry takes out two cigars
He holds one out to Rowboat
Rowboat shakes his head
Mr
Henry shrugs and lights one for himself
You know, Rowboat
People who smoke cigarettes die
People who smoke cigars just keep on going
Rowboat nods, smoking
Mr
Henry looks at Hector
He points
Sit
Hector sits
Mr
Henry smiles a broad smile
The movers go buy with a beautiful Moroccan divan
Dignan comes out the front door pulling Applejack, semi- conscious, to the car
Dignan loans Applejack against the door
He checks Applejack's pockets for the keys
He looks around on the ground
He hears sirens in the distance
He looks across the parking lot
Two squad cars screech in off the street
Dignan takes off into the building
Dignan sprints down the corridor
Races up the stairs
Runs down hall after hall
Two  appear out of the elevator
Freeze
Dignan ducks into a stairwell
He runs down the stairs and into another corridor
He can hear cops yelling from two different directions
He crosses a catwalk
Cuts through an office
Pulls open a door and goes into one of the freezer rooms
Cops come yelling down the hallway
Dignan runs through the freezer room and tries the other door
It's stuck
Three come inside
Dignan instantly puts his hands up in the air
#1 Drop the fucking gun
#2 Don't move
Dignan drops the gun
The cops rush him
They nail him into the wall
Get him in a headlock, pulling hard
#3 You're caught, buddy
They pull him into the hallway
#1 Put your hands behind your back
'm not going to do anything
#3 (squeezing his neck) Why'd you try to run, buddy
Don't you know what freeze means
Don't you speak fucking English
#1 Take it easy
They put him face down on the floor and cuff him
#1 (to Dignan) Calm down
They move him down the corridor
Dignan's nose is bleeding
He looks terrified
Applejack is sitting propped up against the wall
He's got an oxygen mask on his face and a team of paramedics and cops around him
Somebody's taking his blood pressure
Another one's giving him an
: Anthony running down a sidewalk
He drops his gun in a trashcan without slowing down
He crosses a bridge and runs into the the trees
: There's snow in the air
The prison yard is wide with dry grass and concrete
It's split up by chain link fences
Guards sit in the towers
Dignan's wearing an inmate jumpsuit
Anthony and Bob walk with him across the yard
They've brought along two bags of food from a hamburger place
said to the , That cop who hit me must of given me  disease
What's that
That's just what the  asked is a disease where you can't remember shit
Dignan smiles
Like amnesia
Can't remember shit
Oh
Anthony kind of smiles
Tell Mr
Henry  said that
Anthony nods
Silence
They walk past a bunch of guys lifting weights on the other side of a fence
So is Mr
Henry going to come by and see me or anything
(pause) don't think so
mean
Actually, he robbed Bob's house
He did
Yeah
You got to be kidding me
'm not kidding
(pause) What'd he get
Pretty much everything
The grandfather clock
He got everything
Dignan nods
Pause
Wow
(pause, looks at Bob) Sorry, Bob
Bob shrugs, looking at the ground
Dignan looks to Anthony
You think Applejack knew
(shrugs) We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital
His case got dismissed
Dignan's stunned to hear this
Why
We're not sure
We think Mr
Henry maybe -- His health isn't very good, you know
They take that into account
Pause
Dignan nods
No
That's true
Long silence
Mr
Henry never gave you a test, did he
What do you mean
Nothing
: a picnic table in the prison yard
There's frost on the ground
They're eating lunch
You're living on a sailboat
(nods) It belongs to Bob's uncle
How big is it
Oh, 'd say about -- It's in the driveway
(pause) Temporarily
Where
Behind Bob's house
Long pause
Does it float
We're not sure yet
It's going to need some repairs
Dignan nods
So how is it in there
(pointing at cell block) (shrugs) What can  say
It's jail
You don't sleep when you want to
You don't eat when you want to
Do you have your own room
We don't have rooms, Bob
We have cells
Do you have your own cell
No
have a cellmate
His name's Carl
What's he in for
He stole a tractor
Do they let you -- don't really want to talk about it, Bob
Long pause
Anthony takes a sip from a milkshake
Dignan unwraps the foil from a cheeseburger
He takes a bite
(with his mouth full of food) This sure beats the shit out of the shit they crap out in this joint
Anthony and Bob laugh
Dignan takes another huge bite
(smiling) might have to have another one of these
: Dignan in handcuffs behind a chain link fence
He's standing in line with some other inmates
Thanks for coming
Anthony nods
They stand there in silence
The line moves forward a few steps
Anthony and Bob walk with Dignan on the other side of the fence
The line stops
Pause
Dignan leans toward the fence
Hey
He motions for them to come closer to the fence
He whispers: think  may have found a way out of here
(pause) You're kidding
No
'm not
How
Shhh
Wait for my instructions
Dignan,  -- The line starts moving
Anthony and Bob walk with Dignan on the other side of the fence
When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard
What
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint
Bob and 'll -- Dignan,  -- The line starts moving faster
Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land
And Bob
Remember: Scale the -- Shield me from the bullets
They won't shoot civilians
Ready
Hold on -- Here we go
Wait a second -- Now
Anthony and Bob look all around in a panic
They look to Dignan
Dignan shuffles along with the rest of the inmates
He looks at Anthony and Bob
He smiles
He shrugs
So long
Bob and Anthony slowly half-smile
They wave to Dignan as the line of inmates turns away
Anthony looks to Bob
Bob smiles
The line of inmates stops about fifty feet away
Dignan looks back
Anthony looks at him
Dignan's expression has changed
He wasn't expecting them to see it
His eyes look cold
Anthony puts his hand on the fence
Dignan turns and the line of inmates disappears into the cell block
Anthony stands there in silence
He lets go of the fence
He walks with Bob down the long path in the cold air
