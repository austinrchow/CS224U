It'll probably work out
We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention

It's terrible
She's perfect for this gig
These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her

Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own

Maybe three

You'll go straight to the gas chamber

What did they do to her
Do
Jesus Christ, man
They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot
Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood
( ad-libs a summation of the crime) And nobody did anything
What could they do
The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds
He was packing two Lugers, and the others had -16s
They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up
Like big lizards
and every one of them stacked naked
Naked

Not a major
He wanted the pineal gland
Really
That's how he got so big
When he quit the Marines he was just a little guy
Usually, it's whole families
During the night

What do you mean by that
You know what  mean
We've done it before and we can damn well do it again
Cut their goddamn heads off
Every one of them
That's what we're doing in California

But since  know you're here with the Police Convention
Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again
We're watching her very carefully
this woman has been into laudanum
It's a controlled experiment, but suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over
(/) (hesitantly) Well, certainly
We're always happy to cooperate with the police

Don't worry
You're protected
Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble

Of course
And now  have to get back to the news

Good work
They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that
(slowly, carefully) Lucy is looking for you
(laughing) No, she's looking for you

The only way  could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown -- that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her all to yourself

The manager told me a story about the owner of this place
about how he always wanted to run away and join the circus when he was a kid
Well, now the bastard has his own circus, and a license to steal, too

Where's the ape

People are recovering from some kind of battle
3RD Forget it, he just attacked an old man
he took a bite out of the bartender's head
The cops took the ape away
Goddamnit
What's the bail want that ape
've already reserved two first-class seats on the plane

She was definitely in charge here

What are you doing
You were supposed to turn back there
(/) We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help
The only chance now, felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it
suddenly

Jesus Christ
There, crossing the road in front of them, is  -- her paintings under her arm -- looking lost throws the car into a - looks wildly around

We are all wired into a survival trip now
No more of the speed that fueled that 60's
That was the fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip
He crashed around America selling "consciousness expansion" without ever giving a thought to the grim meat-hook realities that were lying in wait for all the people who took him seriously

All those pathetically eager acid freaks who thought they could buy Peace and Understanding for three bucks a hit
But their loss and failure is ours too
What Leary took down with him was the central illusion of a whole life-style that he helped create
--         20  30 a generation of permanent cripples, failed seekers, who never understood the essential old-mystic fallacy of the Acid Culture: the desperate assumption that somebody
or at least some force -- is tending the light at the end of the tunnel
