It doesn't look like a pleasant experience
He is sixteen, dirty blonde, his eyes visibly moving under closed lids as he sits huddle under a blanket in his window seat
The lights are dim -- the shade on the window closed -- a bead of sweat dribbles down his forehead
The  of the jet's engines vibrates through the cabin
The boy's eyes snap open
Jacob glances around nervously
He looks like an escaped convict who just accidentally walked into the Policemen's Ball
two seats away from him gives the teenager a cursory glance, then goes back to his book
Jacob lays his head back and tries to relax
The engines continue to drone
Until a new noise starts
The sound is very faint
But distinct from everything else
Jacob frowns
The noise gets
Jacob's sure he's hearing it now
He looks at the Greyhaired Man
The man catches his eye and the two of them stare at each other for a heartbeat - then Jacob turns away
The Man returns to his book
And Jacob immediately turns back to him
Do you hear that
The man gives him an annoyed look as the  gets louder
Hear what
That noise
don't hear anything
The man turns back to the book as the sound gets even  - - like it's coming closer
Jacob squirms in his seat -- sneaks a look at the man again
How can he not hear that walks by and Jacob catches her attention
Excuse me
Yes
The  is completely obvious now
The greyhaired man tries to ignore the two people talking over him
What is that sound
That's just the engines, sir
No, it's different
It's not the engines
It's getting louder
The man sighs -- the stewardess smiles patronizingly
We're just gaining altitude to get above some rough weather
That's the sound of the engines speeding up a bit
Everything's fine
Um
okay
The stewardess walks away as Jacob sits back and starts to bite his nails
The whooshing is really starting to now
He looks between the seats in front of him -- twists around to look behind
He snaps back to the greyhaired man
(cont'd) Can't you hear that
(losing patience) Look, kid
Will you relax
It's just the damn engines, okay
The man glares at him, and Jacob backs off
The sound has grown
Jacob grinds his seat like he's going mad
He looks at the closed window
He reaches out his hand, grabs the handle then rips up the shade for all to see: 747 coming
Jacob
The planes
Impact - decompression - explosion
The hull of the cabin buckles violently - moaning like a dying elephant - peeling inward revealing     on the outside
huge wing section  through the structure - barely missing Jacob - taking the greyhaired man's head clean off - nailing the stewardess in the gut and shoving her body across and out the other side of the cabin
And Jacob's seat drops down - sending him and us into: - Like an intricate ballet, Jacob, his body strapped to his chair, tumbles away from the -10 and 747 as they seem to merge and bend into some kind of mutant -47 - wings and tails wrapping around each other as debris blooms out like a flower and together they  - a fiery ball lighting the nighttime clouds and Jacob's shrieking face
And Jacob falls and falls and falls, his hair sticking straight up from the blasting wind
That's when  start falling past him
The captain of the plane - the stewardess, her body bent in half - the greyhaired man, his head gone but his book still in his hand
More men, women, crew people - and
But these children aren't dead bodies
Two   and one  , all dressed in white, plummet down next to Jacob, head first, like high divers
And they're singing: One two, Freddy's coming for you
The children turn around in the sky so that they are travelling feet first
The Little Boy's pants puff up and the Girls' skirts poof out and   - the wind taking away their clothes and their skin and their bodies and their hair
(cont'd) Three four, better lock your door
Leaving three tiny  - taunting and laughing as Jacob screams and covers his eyes
(cont'd) Five six, grab your crucifix
And the Skeletons sprout wings - leathery and veiny - the wind catching them and sending them up and away as their voices echo in the sky
(cont'd) Seven eight, gonna stay up late
Jacob takes his hands away from his face and starts to frantically pull on his seat belt
- it flies off his back and miraculously turns into a
Rope swirls into the air - the wind grabs the canvas - and Jacob's body slows with a violent jerk
But at least he's not falling anymore
Jacob catches his breath as he starts gently floating through the sky
He smiles
This isn't so bad
This is actually kind of fun
Not for long, though, because his new upward momentum carries him back up to: The winged children's Skeletons
Jacob's eyes bug out as he rises into them and they start to circle
They move closer and we can see something in their hands: Jacob twists his body, trying to steer his parachute away from the demons
One of the Skeletons swoops up to his face and pokes its scissors inches away from Jacob's eyes
It sings alone: Nine ten, never sleep again
The Skeleton cranks its arm back - ready to plunge the scissor's blades into Jacob's sockets
The arms swings toward him - then suddenly diverts up past his head, heading for: ' The Skeleton flaps its wings and poises its scissors at one of the ropes
The other two Skeletons join it over Jacob's head
The three of them look down at Jacob, their boney jaws in a perpetual smile
No
The Skeletons nod "yes"
-  -  - they cut away at Jacob's parachute as he swings underneath them, trying to pull away -  -
The parachute flutters away - the Skeletons cackle - and Jacob plummets
We stay with him as he screams and shrieks and yells and the clouds part and the ground rises quickly up to meet him
The ground becomes a town, the town becomes a block, the block becomes a house, the house becomes a roof, and
'  - -
The ceiling explodes as Jacob's body plows through, slams down, shatters the bed, and we immediately: : '  - Jacob's eyes blast open as he sits up from bed in a cold sweat
dream
The worst fucking dream from hell anyone would ever want to have -- but still just a dream
He takes a few deep breaths as a soft  is heard at the door
Yeah
opens the door and sticks her head in
She's thirty-two, blonde, with a caring smile
You okay, honey
Yeah, Mom
'm fine
Alright
Better get cooking or you'll be late for school
On my way
Alice closes the door as Jacob gets out of bed and stretches
Sunlight is leaking through the bedroom window shade and Jacob walks over to it
He reaches out and pulls up the shade
And there's nothing buy sky
Jacob frowns and pokes his head out the window
'  - is once again racing up towards us at seven-thousand miles an hour
The entire house is falling
Jacob leaps away from the window
The reappear outside -- dancing in the air -- cackling with glee
The bedroom starts to  violently as Jacob stumbles into the center
The roof starts caving in and the walls begins to crumble
Jacob grabs his head, looks up at us, and
We suddenly stay where we are as the house drops down and we punch out through the roof and our shot becomes an: as it falls away towards the ground
We watch as it becomes a small dot - and finally impacts on the surface
mushroom cloud of smoke silently puffs out in the distance below -  - Smoke and dust whirl around a huge hole in the earth
Splintered shreds of lumber stick up in the air like giant toothpicks
Some of the toothpicks start to move
Jacob rises out of the destruction, charred, scraped, battered and, unfortunately, alive
He climbs up to the edge of the crater
He looks back a the remnants of his home
Then something starts to happen
Something his growing from the crater - spreading out
It's not a cloud, it's not smoke - it's a
Even though it's night, this darkness is darker
It creeps out from the hole - fingers of blackness reaching out
What it covers doesn't disappear
It becomes
The shroud is getting bigger
And it's getting faster
Jacob runs
- He bolts down the streets of the small town in a blind panic
He looks behind him and sees the darkness getting bigger, its gloominess covering houses
Then whole blocks
Everything it touches seems to fall deeper into
Jacob comes across a  walking her dog
He stops and yells at her
Get the hell out of here
It's coming
What's coming
Jacob points down the street
The shroud is swooping down the road - browning out street lights in its wake
And the woman doesn't find anything threatening about this
Jacob screams at her
Don't you see it
See what
And it's obvious now: she doesn't see anything
The Woman is totally oblivious to the danger
Jacob shakes his head -- stumbles away
The woman watches him go as the darkness
She sighs
And begins to
Her hair gets scraggly, her skin bursts out in sores, her back grows a hump -- all of which she ' seem to notice
She just shrugs her twisted shoulders
(cont'd) Kids
watcha gonna do
She hobbles away with her dog - which now has six legs and two heads
- Like a bat running from hell, he tears through the streets passing buildings that turn creepy and people that become passively accepting monsters
booms out from nowhere
(
) Jacob
You're too old to run away from home
Jacob covers his ears and races out of town
- Jacob falls onto the deserted road just outside of town
He rolls on the asphalt and looks behind him
most of the town is covered in an opaque gloom
Suddenly a  sound is heard and Jacob turns to its source: : The town can still be seen behind it -- the darkness over almost all of it now
The sign reads:
And the numbers after the word "population" are changing
They're counting , clattering away like an old-time gas pump in reverse - faster and faster - blurring as the "thousands" digit disappears, then the "hundreds", then "tens", then
- the count stops at "1"
Springwood is entirely engulfed in the shroud
There is a pause
- the sign is violently  into the ground
It vanishes into the earth and a   at the edge of the road
The crack grows - moving out to the center of the highway
Jacob watches the crack as it splits wider in the middle of the street and a  sound starts to build
The tar in front of Jacob becomes molten
It bubbles and pops
Jacob scrambles backwards as something begins to rise from boiling asphalt
It's a hat
The hat, a fedora to be precise, pushes itself up
left hand - burned and scarred - pokes out next to it
Four sharp blades jut out of the muck on the other side
head is up now - a curtain of tar dripping from the rim of the hat - hiding the face
The body beneath the head ascends
The veil of asphalt parts: It's
Jacob
Freddy
He shakes off his layer of tar and looks towards the clouded town of Springwood
look of pure hatred appears on his ragged face
Payback time
Freddy opens his mouth - lets out a large breath - and then an even larger one
starts, the source being Krueger's own lungs
The gale force begins to yank at the shroud surrounding Springwood
Fingers of darkness pull up from the town and towards Freddy's mouth -- and houses begin to
Freddy continues to inhale like he's never going to stop
Krueger is sucking the black gloom into his body - and the entire town of Springwood is going with it
Trees, buildings, cars, picket fences
It's all crumbling and fusing, becoming a part of t cloud that itself is caught in the nightmarish wind tunnel, all piling into Freddy's mouth
The vortex swirls into Krueger
Then it's gone
Nothing but a vacant lot the size of a town remains
Freddy turns to Jacob and , it sounds like a
No
Don't worry,  have a strong stomach
Freddy reaches down and yanks up his red and green sweater
He pulls apart his putrid abdomen to reveal his guts - and a transparent stomach
Inside the stomach: a black swirling mass
Flashes of houses, people, homes, couples, all trapped in horrible anguish
Freddy drops down his sweater
(cont'd) Springwood is mine, boy
dreamed you away before  was born
Mom said you couldn't come back
Is that true
Then she told you all about me, huh
Let's see what else she has to say
Freddy reaches his left hand into the bubbling tar at his feet, digs around a bit, then pulls out: Jacob's mother
Tar dripping down her body
Krueger has her by the neck, waves his blades in front of her
Jacob gets up and runs toward him
Freddy pulls a foot up from the asphalt pit and  Jacob back a good fifteen feet
Run, Jacob
The boy rolls painful on the hard road
He sits up and screams: Leave her alone
You're such a momma's boy
Freddy swings his knives out, pauses for a terrifying beat, then swoops the daggers towards Alice
as   we hear a horrible multiple
Jacob shrieks in gut-wrenching anguish
We're far enough away so that we don't barf at the sight but close enough to see that Freddy has impaled Alice's body on his blades
He lifts her up effortlessly and raises her limp figure
Krueger swings his arm out, shaking off Alice, sending her flying over Jacob's head
The body lands behind him
as he runs to his mother
She  just as he reaches out to touch her bloody body
He turns to Krueger and raises his fists
look of sheer rage is growing in him, blind, insane anger
He bellows: You fucker
Springwood is only the beginning
All need from you is a ride
Suddenly, between Jacob and Freddy, three burst up from the road
Three  appear as the light dissipates
They're dressed in metallic black, heavy boots, helmets with dark visors covering their faces
One is large and muscular
The one in the center has an obviously feminine figure under her skin-tight outfit
The third is a little smaller than the other two with a slightly different face  that allows us to see his mouth
They're the
Jacob doesn't know this yet, but Freddy seems to
The bastard son of a hundred maniacs frowns at the sight of these new apparitions
Then he looks past them and smiles at Jacob
(cont'd) See ya later
Freddy violently  down into the bubbling asphalt pit
Two of the black figures start after him
The third one turns to Jacob as his partners leap into the hole after Freddy
The sound from his exposed mouth is
Jacob grabs his ears in pain as we suddenly: : - Jacob's eyes snap open so fast his sockets suffer whiplash
He's lying smack in the middle of the road tucked in a fetal position
Jacob slowly uncurls his body and sits up
He shivers and wipes his sweaty forehead - and that's when he notices something in his hand
: ' it's a bracelet, a simple band of gold with a larger plate in the middle, like an  band
Jacob's fingers turn the plate over
Printed on the other side is the name of the bracelet's former owner:
Jacob has a souvenir
He raises his face and looks at the road in front of him
It goes off into the distance surrounded on both sides by empty fields
This is where Springwood used to be
look of anguish crosses Jacob's face as he stares at the desolation
Mom
Jacob whips his head around in time to see a huge moving van blasting right at him
He rolls off to the side of the road
The truck barely misses him, kicking up a cloud of dust in its wake
Jacob chokes on the dust
He slowly recovers and looks back down at the bracelet in his hand
He clenches his fist around it as a wild-eyed angry look starts to grow on him
He takes a few deep breaths, then stands up and walks
We can see a pickup truck in the distance
Jacob's , thumb sticking out, his mother's bracelet dangling from his wrist
The pickup truck starts to slow down
- sprawling little community with pleasant streets and cheerful houses
It looks a lot like Springwood, the only real difference being that it actually exists
It also has a sign:
: 8,786 Volkswagon bus drives past the sign and stops a couple of blocks down the road from us
Jacob steps out of the passenger side and wearily waves his ride goodbye
He shuffles into town
It reads:
The sign pulls away to reveal a middle-aged man with an angry expression: Clean up your act somewhere else
He walks along as we - It's a nice-looking two-story house in the middle of a usually quiet neighborhood
Today the home is surrounded by about a dozen townsfolk carrying picket signs: , ' , and
The crowd mumbles amongst itself, occasionally bursting out with a chant in protest
We catch him walking down the sidewalk
He tramps along with his hands stuffed in his pockets and his eyes on the pavement
He looks like he hasn't slept in days
The sound of the crowd ahead of him finally grabs his attention
Jacob approaches the disturbance and comes across a young girl standing behind a bush holding a
She is  , dark hair, sixteen, very pretty, but with a faraway look in her eyes
Jacob stands next to her and stares at the crowd like a zombie
She doesn't turn to look at him as he speaks: What's going on
Free speech
The right of assembly
What is this place
It's a home
foster home
For teenagers
It's where you go when things get bad
It's the place to figure out what to do next
It's a home for kids that no one else wants
(beat) It's  home
Karen hasn't looked at Jacob once
She suddenly seems to steel herself and walks away from the bush, towards the house
Jacob is befuddled
Oh
He stands there and watches
Karen quickly makes her way into the crowd of people, head up, eyes staring forward
The crowd parts ever so slightly as the irked townsfolk start to heat up
They have an actual human to vent their anger on now
Mr
Hopkins lays in on her as she passes him
Why can't you find somewhere else to shack up
Karen turns to him, still walking, flustered and hurt
What have we ever done to you
Nothing
Karen turns quickly away from him and trips over a sprinkler head
Her groceries tumble onto the grass
hand reaches down to help her
It's Jacob's
He quietly helps her re-bag her groceries as Mr
Hopkins looms above them
Both angry and embarrassed now
(cont'd) Look, we've been here for years
This is a quiet street
We'd just like to keep it that way
Jacob can't take this guy anymore
He stands up and faces the older man with a scowl
Lighten up, mister
(smirks) And what gutter did you crawl out from, kid
(frowns) We don't want your kind here
My kind
What kind is that
Drug addicts
Dope pushers
We have stand up and take charge
Swell
've just got a couple of questions for you
Do you love your parents
Of course  do
Are they alive
My mother is
What's it like
Jacob stares at Hopkins
He doesn't answer
He just huffs and puffs as Karen grabs Jacob and pulls him up to the front porch of the home, then into the floor
-   - Karen slams the door and takes a deep breath
Assholes
can think of a stronger word
Are you okay
Yeah
Thanks
'm Karen
Jacob
Jacob suddenly gets a little light-headed and has to use a wall to hold himself up
Karen looks concerned
Are  okay
Yeah
just haven't had much to eat lately
Then come help me unpack
She smiles and leads him further into the house
-  - Jacob is feverishly eating a sandwich at the table while Karen finishes putting the rest of the food away
guess the sandwich is alright, huh
It's incredible
Best 've ever had
You're not from around here, are you
No
've been on the road for a couple of days
Do you need a place to stay
are heard from below and a couple in their mid- thirties enter from the basement door
They're  and , both greasy and frustrated
So, we have to get it fixed
We don't have the money to get it fixed
They both start washing up at the sink, not really noticing the teenagers in the room
Karen speaks up
What's wrong
Our plumbing has a bad case of hardening of the arteries
Who's your friend
David gives Jacob a wary glance as the boy stands shakily
This is Jacob
Jacob Johnson
David Ross
My wife, Mary
They run this house
They're helping me and three other ids get a footing in reality before they kick us out of the nest to make room for the next batch
David is looking out the window at the now dissipating crowd
He lets out a weary sigh
If there is a next batch
see the welcome wagon is back
Was there any trouble
little
Jacob came to my rescue
(pleasant) Where you from, Jacob
Springwood
Springwood
Where's that
Upstate about a hundred miles
(suspicious) know this state like the back of my hand
've never heard of Springwood
There is an uncomfortable pause
Then Karen suddenly breaks in
Jacob's a little down on his luck told him he could stay here a few days
Jacob gives here a surprised look
Are your parents in Springwood
My father died before  was born
My mother, she's dead, too
You have a legal guardian
No
Been in any state or federal program
No
Just for a little while
So he can get his bearings
Got any
Jacob reaches for his back pocket - it's empty
He shakes his head "no"
(to David) think we can help him out, honey
The budget's tight, but we can't turn down someone in need
David doesn't acknowledge his wife, he just stares at Jacob sternly
Karen bites her nails
Then David sits down and starts to lecture
Okay
You got three, maybe four days to rest up while we try and find a more permanent arrangement for you
But his isn't going to be a free ride
We're part of a community summer work project and eighty percent of the money you make goes to the house
Everybody works - and that includes you
Are you on drugs
No
Good
If  catch anything stronger then an aspirin on you, you're outta here
No arguments
You got that straight
Yes, sir
Okay
Dinner in two hours
Why don't you go meet the rest of the gang
Thanks, David
'll go fix up the spare bed in Wesley's room
David gets up
He gives Jacob a final once-over
And take a shower, for chrissakes
David leaves the room
Karen gives Jacob a huge grin
-    - Karen leads Jacob into the room
There are two teenagers on the couch:  is a fifteen-year old, curly hair, kind of small
is also fifteen, brunette hair, seems pretty happy
Hey, guys,  got someone for you to meet
This is Jacob
Jacob, this is Wesley and Gina
Hi
Welcome to fun central
He's going to be staying with us for a while
Oh yeah
How'd you get through the blockade
Another kid, , pops into the room
He's sixteen, dark hair, with a tough-guy  could give a shit attitude
He doesn't seem to care about anybody in the room, except for Karen
Hey, beautiful
How's it going
Hi, Scott
Scott notices Jacob and frowns
Karen is a little annoyed
Who's Barney Rubble
This is Jacob Johnson
He's a new resident
At least temporarily
He better not be rooming with me value my privacy
No,  believe that honor goes to Wesley
Good
could use the company
So what's your story
Divorce
Custody battle
Your parents just plain assholes
They're dead
Mellow out, Scott
Give him a chance to settle in
Just curious
Scott reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls out a pack of cigarettes
As he lights one up, Wesley's cheerful attitude suddenly turns grim
He gets up from the couch and quickly leaves the room
Karen gives Scott an angry look
Is he alright
He'll be fine
He just has a problem with cigarettes
His parents used to use them as a sick kind of discipline
That's why he's here
If you know that, then why do you smoke in front of him
It's not my problem
This really pisses Jacob off
These two are not going to get along very well
Just what is  problem, then
took care of my problem
That's why ' here
Scott lets out an aloof puff of smoke and leaves
Jacob gives Karen a confused glance
His dad used to beat him
One day he couldn't take it any more
What happened
He killed him with his father's gun
Self-defense
Jacob sits down on the couch and lets that sink in
Gina scootches away from him on the couch, then gives him a glum look
Everyone here has a fun tale to tell
Isn't that right, Karen
Karen is staring out the window
She has that spaced-out expression we saw before when she was hiding behind the bush
Yeah
Right
No one has anything left to say
Gina turns the sound on the back up as the three sad kids start to watch cartoons
-    - Jacob is alone in the dark watching some kind of b&w sit-com re-run
cheerful family lovingly banters away on the flickering tube
Jacob just stares blankly
Karen sleepily shows up at the doorway in a long tee-shirt with a glass of milk
Why don't you go to bed
can't sleep
You need to talk
No
'm fine
Thanks
Karen gives him a worried look and heads off to bed
Jacob continues watching  with a creepy glean in his tired eyes
- The kids are here cleaning up the building
The guys throw rotted lumber into trash bins while the girls sweep up
We catch Jacob and Scott tossing some debris into a wheelbarrow
Jacob looks pretty ragged
Come on
Let's hop to it
Gotta make way for those new indoor tennis courts
The fate of the world lies in the balance
Okay, this load's full
Jacob grabs the handles of the wheelbarrow and shakily picks it up
Scott sneers
(cont'd) You got that
Yeah, no problem
don't know
Maybe you should think about switching to de-caf or something
Jacob ignores him and pushes the wheelbarrow along
Scott takes some time off to smoke a cigarette
He spots Karen across the room bending over with a dustbin
Scott lingers on this view for a long time
Jacob pulls up with the wheelbarrow and starts to unload the junk
Gina is next to the dumpster sweeping
She tries to push a large crate aside by herself, but slips and falls
Jacob jumps over to her, reaches out, and grabs her arm to help her up
You okay
Gina
No
Yes
Let go of me
She shakes off his grip and he jumps back
She runs away with a wild look in her eyes as Karen steps up to a confused Jacob
She doesn't like to be touched
No shit
Don't take it personally
It's not her fault
What happened to her
Her mother was a hooker
She forced Gina to carry on the tradition
When she was thirteen
Jesus
Jacob looks off at Gina with genuine concern
Karen gives him the same expression
You look terrible
(smiling) Thanks
'm sorry
just wish you'd tell me what happened to you, that's all
can't talk about it right now
'll tell you later
promise
Okay
Why don't you sit and rest for a bit
The supervisor's not around
You look like you could use it
think  will
He gives her a gentle squeeze on the forearm, and Karen likes it
Jacob spots a pile of wood next to a wall and heads off for it
He's watched the entire interchange between Jacob and Karen, and he ' like it
as he goes around the stack of lumber and sits down facing the brick wall
He lets out a heavy sigh and stares at the inside of the building
'  - sits there quietly for a few beats until: Bricks fly out at us as a gaping hole blows into the wall revealing nothing but  and our shot  through: - Horrifying apparitions and images  by us
Gloomy buildings under a pitch black sky
and twisted Shadowy streets and dark alleyways
And -  suddenly ripping right through the sky and down upon us as a  rings out
Hey, you
-  - Jacob's eyes are closed as a  looms above him
No slacking off
Back to work
The boy's eyes snap open and he jumps to his feet like a babbling crazy man
What
Jesus fucking
Oh, shit
Whoa
Get a grip, boy
The supervisor backs off from Jacob as he slowly gets used to reality again
Huh
What's going on
Nothing
That's the problem
Now that you've gotten your beauty rest, let's see if you can change it, okay
Jacob calms down and nods
He walks away, snatching a nervous glance at the perfectly normal brick wall
- We watch as various lit windows go dark and the residents of the house go to bed
& '  - Wesley is getting in bed
Jacob is sitting in a chair staring out the window
Wes switches off the lights and turns to Jacob
Aren't you going to bed
'm not tired
Bullshit
If you looked any more tired, you'd be dead
Jacob cracks a weary smile in the darkness
That's right
You gotta sleep, man
Why
Who says
You know, people don't even really know why we sleep
They haven't found any physical reason for it
But they do know that you go nuts if you don't
Sharks don't sleep
They can't pump water through their gills on their own
They have to always keep moving
If they stop, they can't breath
If they go to sleep, they die
You're not a shark
know
'm just a kid
Don't worry about me, Wes
Go to sleep
Wesley shakes his head and gets under the covers
Jacob continues to stare out the window, desperately trying to keep his eyes open
'  - the trees sway quietly in the breeze outside
There is a pause
Then we are suddenly    , glass, careening back into: - We  through the gloomy air, over the creepy buildings
And suddenly  , right for the street, and end up three inches off the asphalt, really ripping down the road until we grind to a
Right in front of: '
Our shot
Freddy looms above us and grins
You can't stay awake forever, boy
He , his mouth gaping wide, and then splitting open impossibly wider
Something starts pouring out of his mouth, right at us
Hundreds of   spew down upon us, covering us completely as everything goes to  and we: & '  - his eyes are open, his mouth is hanging in a
It looks like his head is about to explode
He lifts his hand up to his face
He's holding an eight-inch long Jacob  out loud this time, tosses the mutant insect away
It lands on a windowsill and escapes out the opening
Jacob jumps to his feet, sending his chair tumbling backwards with a
He shakes and moans, a little drool dripping down his chin
Wesley sits up with a start and stares at Jacob
told you you'd go nuts
Jacob catches his breath, gives Wes a dead serious look
Get everybody else
have to tell them something
In the middle of the night
it
Wesley is shocked by Jacob's manic state and jumps out of bed
-   - Five kids are gathered around the room in various stages of sleepy grumpiness and annoyed disbelief
Jacob paces back and forth
don't get it
Is this guy alive or dead
He's neither
He haunts your dreams and if he kills you, you die for real
Wesley, the most gullible of the group, looks pretty scared
haven't dreamed of him
have nightmares like you wouldn't believe, but never of this guy
That's because this all rates an eleven on the bullshit meter
don't know why we have to listen to this crap
You're scaring the hell out of Wes here
Keep your voice down
It doesn't matter
The Ross's sleep like rocks, which is what we all should be doing
know this sounds crazy, but  swear it's true
went to bed one night and woke up in the middle of the road
Freddy Krueger killed my mother, blasted my whole town into his nightmare, and, worst of all,  think he wants to use me to kill more kids and bring more towns into his world
How
'm not sure
think 'm some kind of carrier
He's somehow inside me and as soon as  fall deep enough into sleep he'll be let loose
You guys were great to take me in
just don't want to thank you by getting you all killed
Scott gets up and goes to a desk
He pulls out a map and shows it to Jacob
Okay
Show me Springwood
Jacob looks at the map and points
(cont'd) There's nothing there
That's what 've been trying to tell you
There's  been a town there
That's how  see it
was part of the nightmare, so 'm the only one who notices the difference
Scott stares at Jacob
He actually grows sympathetic
Look, Jacob
You don't have to convince us that nightmares are real
Everybody in this room has been through one
And some of us are still living it
But the thing is, we know it's just in our heads now
It can be just as bad as the real thing was, but it's still only a memory
It can't hurt us physically, unless we do the hurting ourselves
And we don't want to see you get hurt
We know it gets crazy
And we'll help out the best we can
But this is just too hard to believe
Jacob plops down on the couch, defeated
He hangs his head while the kids start to get up
Wesley gives him a pat on the back as he, Scott, and Gina leave
But Karen is still here
She sits next to a window with a faraway look in her eyes
Jacob looks up at her
You don't believe me, either, do you
don't know
Why are you still here
'm not sure
guess,  guess  see a lot of me in you
Feels good to see someone more fucked up than yourself, huh
Karen smiles and sits down next to him
Yeah
That must be it
But you haven't told me why you're here at this place
can't talk about it right now
Maybe later
Do you want me to stay with you
Yeah, that'd be great
Don't let me sleep, okay
'll do my best
She reaches for the remote control and flicks on the , moving a little closer to Jacob when she sits back into the couch
The two of them watch the screen with glassy eyes
(cont'd) Thank God for cable
Yeah
Thank God
They continue to watch in silence as Karen takes hold of Jacob's hand
-    - We are   as she sleeps curled up on the couch
Jacob is in the background putting on his shoes
He has a brown paper bag with him
Jacob gets up, grabs his bag, and steps over to Karen
He gently pulls a lock of hair away from her face
Then he heads for the front door
-   - Jacob walks out the door and closes it behind him
He crosses to the porch steps and stops
He has to hold onto a porch column just to keep standing
Karen appears behind him
Jacob jumps a bit
Where are you going
'm leaving
Why
He can't hurt you if 'm gone
Maybe 'll go to the desert or something
'll lie down in the middle of nowhere and finally get some sleep
Krueger can feed of the dreams of snakes and vultures
Fine
You're just going to take off then
Karen has an angry expression on his face
Jacob gives her a pained look
Don't do this to me
'm just trying to protect you and the others
Right
You blow into town and then blow right out
Terrific
don't understand why you're so mad at me
You just don't get it, do you
Get what
Karen, though still very angry, looks like she's about to cry
Jacob, confused, sits down on the porch steps
(cont'd) Maybe 'm crazy
Running away doesn't help
He sighs and smiles a bit
And you're going to convince me, huh
Maybe
This time Karen smiles
Jacob looks at her and sighs
Then he yawns
(cont'd) 'm going to make some coffee
You promise not to move
Yeah
Sure
Karen jumps and heads back into the house
Jacob stares at the grass in front of him, his eyes heavy
'  - bush sits there doing nothing
Until it suddenly comes Its leaves start to shrivel, the lawn turns brown, the sky turns dark
Everything changes and turns into - We're in a different front yard in a different town, in a different dimension
The mutant bush starts to change, sprout legs, grow arms, become human
Her body takes shape as she reaches out a pleading arm to us
Jacob
Help me
She's fully formed now
And Freddy bursts out from the ground behind her
He grabs Alice, reaches his knife arm around (cont'd) No-o-o-o-o
Her words are cut off as Krueger jams his blades in her gut and we re-live her death once more
But it's even worse this time
Blood  from Alice like a burst fire hydrant, spraying and showering the entire nightmare lawn like a human sprinkler
Freddy
Say it, don't spray it, huh, Jacob
Come and join the fun
(
) Jacob's voice rips through the scene as everything starts to -   - Jacob is lying in the grass, violently shaking
Karen drops down next to him
Jacob
Nooooo
His body jerks around as if caught in the throes of an epileptic seizure
He , ignoring Karen completely, and continues to shriek and scream and yell and shake
Like he's never going to stop
'   - We're directly across the street from the Foster Home as Jacob's cries echo through the neighborhood
Mr
Hopkins opens the front door
He sees what's going on, scowls, and yells into his house
told you
It's an overdose
Jesus Christ,  saw this coming
Call 9-1-1
He watches the commotion growing across the street, and never once moves to help
- Jacob is being strapped into a stretcher, babbling incoherently
The residents of the Foster Home stand off to the side while neighbors gawk from the street
Karen is next to the   looking frantic
No
Don't let them take me
Jacob, it'll be alright
#1 Calm down, kid
We'll take care of you
Jacob grabs the Ambulance Guy
You don't understand
Let me go
The ambulance guy straps Jacob's arm down
Mr
Ross grabs Karen and pulls her away as they start loading the crazed teenager into the ambulance
Scott shakes his head
Wesley looks terrified
Gina keeps her distance from any human
Karen can't take it and runs into the house
Mr
Ross frowns
This is just what we need
The ambulance drives away as the gathered crowd stares at the kids angrily
- Jacob yells and struggles as an Ambulance Guy prepares a syringe for injection
Don't fucking put me under
You'll set him free
The ambulance guy holds Jacob down and slams the needle home
Jacob screams and his eyes start to glass over
(cont'd) He'll kill them all
Jacob's head starts to go limp
rings out in the van, a voice only Jacob hears: (
) Every town as an Elm Street
echoes as Jacob turns his head towards a window
- The ambulance zooms by
All is quiet for a second until twisted rusty sign post erupts out of the sidewalk and settles at an ugly angle
It's an
sign
- We   from a wide awake Jacob, who is now suddenly alone in the van
Outside the window there is only darkness
Jacob twists and struggles on the stretcher as the ambulance doors crash open revealing  and -
the stretcher is shot out of the van like a cannonball
- The stretcher with Jacob  through a wall and starts to race across the floor of the building that Jacob had been sweeping up the day before
It careens along, actually taking a few turns, like it has a mind of its own, heading for a shallow pit in the middle of the warehouse
The stretcher hits the pit, drops a bit, swings up violently, and stops in a vertical position like a rake that has been stepped on      shoots out of Jacob's body from intertial force, staying upright as it slides across the floor, spins, stops, then changes into: Freddy has his hands on his hips and a grin on his face
Thanks for the lift, kid
He saunters up to Jacob who is still strapped to the vertical stretcher
Krueger waves his knives and wiggles his tongue
What do you want from me
already got it
The rest 'm going to get from your new little friends
Leave them alone
It's my duty to clean up the neighborhood
What have you done with my town
Aw, poor baby's homesick, isn't he
Don't worry
We'll all be one happy family soon
Wanna be the first recruit
Freddy raises his blades and
The straps around Jacob drop away as his body falls to the floor
He scrambles to his feet and starts to
Freddy laughs - as he heads for a door
Before he gets there, the door swings open and Freddy leans casually in his way
(cont'd) What's the matter
Don't want to be part of my expansion project
Jacob turns right around and races back across the warehouse
Jacob races around to the other side and there's Krueger again
(cont'd) Today, Rosedale
Tomorrow, the world
Over my dead body
As you wish
Freddy cranks up his knives and looms over Jacob
And three blast out behind the boy
Jacob rolls away as Freddy holds up an arm to block the blinding glare
The light fades
The   have arrived
We'll call the small one
He stands there motionless as a loud and horrible  noise emanates from his clenched teeth
This guy's bark is worse than his bite
The female in black is
From nowhere she produces two nasty-looking knives, one in each hand
She spins the blades in the air like an expert Samurai
The large one we'll call
He reaches out for the dumpster, and with one hand sends it tumbling away with a Freddy frowns
(cont'd) Uh oh
Too many parking tickets
The Dream Police fan out around Krueger, surrounding him
Power Cop leaps at Freddy, grabs him and  him in the air
Freddy tumbles, rolls and bounces right back up on his feet
Right next to
She swings her knives
Freddy dodges
Swings hi own blades at her
She ducks
Freddy spins again
Right towards: The short man in black opens his mouth and a sound like a foghorn at a rock concert
The force of it hitting Freddy like a fist
Freddy bounces back
And once again he nimbly pops up
He glares at the Dream Police
(cont'd) Don't interfere
We have to
It's our job
Get a new one
And Freddy starts to
Slowly at first, then faster and faster, until his image starts to
The Police circle the whirling image, holding back to see what will happen next
Krueger stops spinning
And his clothes are different
His red and green stripes have been replaced by black and white ones
There is a number printed across his chest
He's dressed like a
Freddy grins
(cont'd) Time to blow this joint
hole is suddenly blown in the high ceiling above Krueger
The building is suddenly filled with the beams of moving  and the sound of blasting
rope falls down through the hole
Freddy grabs it and he's yanked up
(cont'd) You'll never get me, coppers
and away he's gone
After a few seconds the spotlights fade away and the sirens die
The Dream Police look up seemingly unsure of their next action
Then Power Cop kicks a pile of lumber, sending wood flying dozens of yards away
Goddamnit
Sound Cop shakes his head
Blade looks frustrated
Jacob steps up behind them
Alright
just who the hell are you guys
The black-clad trio turn around in unison and look at Jacob
There is a pause
Then: We're the Dream Police
Jacob almost laughs
The what
The Dream Police
Didn't you hear her, man
Power Cop turns to Sound Cop and flips up his visor revealing his face
He's a sixteen-year old black boy
Heavyset features, sweat dripping down his cheeks
He's  from 3
And he's pissed
(cont'd) We try and save this guy's ass and then he goes off and cops an attitude
Sound Cop flips up his helmet
He's , the former mute boy
think you're the wrong guy to talk about attitudes
Guys, guys
This is getting us nowhere
She takes her helmet completely off, long dark hair tumbling over her shoulders
It's , the ex-junkie
These three, they're the Dream Warriors
Or at least they used to be
Hello
May  butt in here and ask some more stupid questions
The three of them stop bickering and turn to Jacob
Blade walks up to Jacob
Her two partners assume position behind her
We don't know much more than you do
What we do know is that we've been recruited
By who
We don't know
Why
think that's obvious
The shit's about to hit the fan
Krueger's discovered new powers
He's ripped a hole between dreams and reality
Our own powers have been amplified
We only hope it will be enough
But we're going to need your help
Me
What can  do
Just who are you guys
really
Blade puts her helmet back on
Her face turns grim
We were like you
We fought Freddy Krueger many years ago
Our souls were released from his grip
No we're back to try again
All three of them drop their visors down at the same time
still don't understand what
Jacob's voice starts to
He keeps trying to talk but the words come out twisted and clipped
He raises a hand to his throat
The hand is transparent
Jacob looks at his body as it slowly starts to disappear and now he's completely mute
Freddy Krueger can't hurt us anymore
Because we're already dead
Jacob vanishes completely
- Jacob opens his eyes
He's in bed, dressed in a white smock
stands next to him with a clipboard in hand
What's going on
Just relax, everything's fine
That's what you say
You're lucky you're here instead of juvenile hall
You put up quite a fight
But you're clean
No traces of drugs or alcohol in your blood
could've told you that
Jacob starts getting out of bed
Hold on there
You said  was fine
have to get back
My friends are in trouble
said you weren't on drugs, but  never said you were fine
You're suffering from extreme fatigue and stress that manifested itself into one hell of an anxiety attack
At least that's what we hope it is
You had a major seizure, Jacob
You don't understand
This whole town is in danger
We're keeping you here for observation
You're not going anywhere tonight
You can't do that
You don't have the right
Yes we do
Your temporary guardian, Mr
Ross, signed all the papers
If you're okay in the morning we might let you go home
Until then, you're bed bound
But
We took off the restraints
Do you want us to put them back on
Jacob drops back in bed
The doctor goes to the door and turns out the lights
Sleep
He closes the door behind him
Shit
and we hear it : suddenly  into the lens with desperation
Dark circles under bloodshot eyes, hair matted with sweat
guy not having a good day
: The man is tightly bound in a regulation straight-jacket in a tiny, claustrophobic holding cell
We can now tell that the image is in
We continue -   - Gina sits on the couch with a stark white blanket on her lap, watching a b&w 1940's potboiler with something less than enthusiasm
Wesley appears in the doorway, checking out the source of the screaming
He looks at Gina, who tosses the blanket aside and rises, frowning
The lunatic on television continues his blood-curdling
Nice movie, huh
And  came in here to mellow out
She smiles at Wes as she exits
(cont'd) It's all yours
Wesley murmurs a goodnight, then looks back at the screen: Some orderlies enter the lunatic's cell and attempt to sedate him as he thrashes violently,  bloody murder
It is gritty and awful but somehow riveting
moves to the couch, clearly mesmerized by the scene
He curls up, absently pulling the white blanket around him as he watches: The orderlies in the movie manage to get the needle into their patient, who  and  pathetically
Relax, will ya, buddy
Everything's gonna be just swell
The second orderly leans on a wall and pulls out a pack of cigarettes from the pocket of his scrubs
(He bears a suspicious resemblance to
) vaguely tenses at this and absently pulls the blanket more tightly around him to compensate, like a cocoon
The second orderly smiles
Yeah, mac
You've just had a hard day, that's all
The orderly produces a pack of matches
He goes to the lunatic on the cot, and  the match off the guy's forehead
As the match , the lunatic
he shuts his eyes tensely as the  is magnified, becoming a sudden  that fills the room
Wesley blinks his eyes open, looks around from his blanket cocoon
Whatever that last sound was, it did  come from the
Beads of sweat line his upper lip as he nervously glances about the room
It remains quiet, serene
Deciding it was his imagination reacting to the scene on , Wesley nestles back on the couch, laying down now as the The carpet at the edge of the room is bunched up as though the walls of the room itself have budged a few inches inward
the second orderly lights his cigarette as he hands the pack to the first
They both look down at the madman as they savor their cigarettes
You heard the man, Wesley
Just relax
Have a smoke with us
Wesley's brow furrows, reacting to the coincidence
Then he stiffens as the two orderlies in the movie begin to hold the lit cigarettes over the lunatic's face Yeah, Wesley
Have a smoke
Wesley has seen about enough of this movie
He starts to get up Fuck this
but finds that he can't move
The white blanket around him restraining him tightly like the straight-jacket on
He squirms and struggles
(cont'd) Hey
He struggles harder now, but to no avail
He's wrapped tight, like a cigarette
the two orderlies torment the straight-jacketed lunatic, poking his face with their lit cigarettes
As the lunatic , the screams become magnified, again becoming that loud, deafening  we heard before
Wesley squirms in his blanket/ straight-jacket, he jerks his head around, with each of the man's , the walls of the room and Wesley's   with horror as he realizes not only is he like a sardine in his stark white blanket, but the walls of the room are starting to   on him
He back to the  set, where: The first orderly is now looking
Wesley  as he notices something familiar about the man's face
Relax, Wesley
Dad
The second orderly  into view
He has become Freddy Krueger
Yeah, Wesley
Everything's gonna be great
Just have a smoke on us
As they hold their smokes out  , their arms with their lit cigarettes
Wesley  and jerks his head away from  and he the floor with an ugly
The wind knocked out of him
He rolls
The couch is
As he squirms and struggles to escape his white cocoon, the frightened boy looks around and sees that everything in the room - furniture, carpet, , even the door - are all gone, leaving just the white walls
Then we see that on the floor all around Wesley are long, cylindrical white objects
Clearly, they resemble , and Wesley - wrapped neck-to-toe in his white blanket cocoon - looks just like one of them
He continues to squirm and  as the walls   from all sides -- closer --  -- pushing the long white things toward him, around him, bunching them together until they are in a tight cluster, as the room   , blocking whatever light source there is, until all Wesley can do is  one last time, and The screen goes
After a few beats, we hear a huge, deafening  , and a new   appears as  Wesley looks up, eyes wide with unspeakable horror as the giant, scarred face of looms over him, grinning, and we: - The room is back to normal, but not the occupant
Freddy Krueger now stands here alone
He has just peeled the wrapper off a pack of cigarettes of which Wesley has become one
Didn't Daddy ever tell you what the Surgeon General says
Krueger reaches in and pulls the tiny Wesley out of the pack
As before, Wesley is immobile, helpless
Freddy holds him between two fingers
(cont'd) Smoking's bad for your health
Freddy looks around, as if searching for something, then beams as he reaches into the air and
(cont'd) Ah
match made in heaven
He produces a puny version of '  In one hand
His body is straight and rigid, like a match stick
Freddy places his thumb on the stiff man's head, and flicks his thumbnail, causing the man's skull to   , an evil grin spanning Wesley's Father's face
He brings the Father-Match to what would be Wesley's tiny feet, and lights the end
' Wesley  as Freddy tosses the - and brings the teenager's little head up to his fire-scarred lips
The boy is enveloped by the massive cracked opening as Freddy takes a huge drag off of Wesley's head
Where his feet should be, the tip of the Wesley-Cig  , causing Wesley to with supernatural pain
Smoke billows from Freddy's nose and mouth
He savors it
(cont'd) Ahhhh
Now we're smokin'
He  horribly as he continues to suck on the Wesley- Cig
With each puff, Wesley's white-wrapped body becomes slat-black ash
(cont'd) What's your sign, Wesley
It wouldn't be Cancer, would it
In between his demonic , Freddy  on the Wesley- Cig, each puff turning more of Wesley into ash until all but his head is black and charred
Freddy holds the Wesley-Cig out, poised to tap the ashes loose
(cont'd) Now say the secret word and you know what you'll win
Go to hell
Freddy grins
Right
And he taps the Wesley-cig with his finger
The ashes immediately fall, sifting in the air as Wesley's head - charred and black at the neck where it's been separated - falls loose
Wesley
Noooooooo
and his severed head falls and falls and falls
-   - on '
Eyes closed, head normal and everything from the neck down charred mass of burnt torso, shriveled limbs, all wrapped in the scorched blanket
body bag hides this ghastly image from us as we
and a  are talking at the doorway in the background
The  is here, a world weary seen-it-all older guy, with his nervous  who's never seen anything like this
They whisper their conversation as they lift the body bag onto a stretcher
don't get it
The couch is barely scorched
And how can he burn from just the neck down
It happens
It happens
That's your explanation
've seen worse
We  them as they push the stretcher towards the doorway
What
What worse
Never mind
Our shot  at the doorway with the fire Marshall and cop while the wigged-out assistant's voice trails off outside
No
wanna know
Really
What could be worse than
You know what the gossip rags are going to say
Spontaneous human combustion
What's that
That's where bodies are supposed to go up in smoke for no reason
It's all psychic bullshit
What really happened is called the candle effect
tiny fire gets started, usually from a cigarette
It slowly smolders through the blanket and clothes until the skin starts to actually bake
The body fat begins to melt and liquefy, fueling the fire like a slow burning candle
It takes hours, but it's real
The cop makes some notes
Behind them we see Scott, Karen and Gina
The girls have been crying, and even tough-guy Scott looks pretty screwed up by all this
The cop nods
He fell asleep while smoking
What a waste
The kids shoot unbelieving looks at each other as the two men walk off
That's impossible
Scott and Karen head for the front door
- coroner's van, a fire chief's car and the now familiar mob of suspicious neighbors are gathered around the front of the house as the stretcher with Wesley's body is put away small van marked    pulls up and Jacob jumps out of it
Jacob's face turns grim as a tearful Karen runs up to him, Scott following
Who
Wes
Oh my God
It's started
He fucking burned alive
They said he fell asleep smoking
And we all know that can't be
already told you how it would happen
Mr
Ross appears behind the three teenagers, a wasted look on his face
Don't start with that shit
It's not shit
'mon, kids
Everyone inside
Now
David leads them back to the house as the coroner's van pulls away
- Jacob, Scott, Karen and Gina stand around in various states of utter shock as David tries to console them
We have to be strong
He puts an arm around Karen and reaches out to put the other one around Gina, but pulls away at the last minute when she starts to flinch
(cont'd) We need to pull together and help each other
Mrs
Ross is upstairs in bed
She's pretty messed up
We need to help her deal with this
He would never touch a cigarette
You know that
We don't know anything until the authorities are finished with their investigation
In the mean time, no work for tomorrow - three day weekend
But Monday, it's back on the job
Jacob wasn't covered in our health plan and his little stint at the hospital cost us a bundle
We have to work together or we might lose this place
Okay
The kids all nod, but not convincingly
They care more about Wesley than the house
& '  - Jacob closes the door
All the kids are here
Gina absentmindedly plays with some of Wesley's things
When  was put under, Freddy was released
know this because  dreamed it
And that dream was real
Yes
Wesley was his first victim
Aw, man
You said it yourself
How could it have been a cigarette
And how could he
dire that way and not wake up
(mockingly) Maybe the "authorities" will figure it out
'm sorry
just can't buy into this
Call me crazy
but  think he's after Rosedale
The whole place
In my dream he said something about needing a few souls to get the job done
think he has to kill in order to get the power to suck in a new town
You are crazy
Thank you
There's more
There are
other people in there
In the nightmares
Like him
No
Different
There are three of them
They're dressed in black
They have powers like Freddy, but they seem to be on our side
Who are they
Well, you gotta hang in there with me on this one
They call themselves
the Dream Police
Scott actually laughs
This is too much
You mean
like cops
guess
Where are they from
They're kids that Freddy killed years ago
don't even know how they got there
But they're somehow patrolling dreamworld to put a stop to Krueger
Then why haven't these guys done the job already
They say they need help
don't know what or why
yet
can tell you who needs help
Hey, 'm trying to save all of us
won't believe it until  see it
Jacob is crushed that he's not getting through to them
By then it'll be too late
It was too late for Wesley
The kids stare emptily at Wesley's earthly possessions
-   - Jacob and Karen sit on the steps
Across the street we can see window curtains part as Mr
Hopkins sneaks a wary peek
They're going to use all this to shut us down
know
It's my fault
You going to try to run away again
It's too late for that
have to stay and try and put a stop to it
'm sorry
It's all so hard to accept
wish  could convince you of the danger you and the others are in
've been in danger before
can handle
This is worse than anything you can imagine
wouldn't be so sure about that
Come on
Let's go inside
She stands up
'  - Jacob and Karen lie in bed, clothes on, cozy
Not sexual
She stares at the ceiling while he listens
She was great
Loving
Supportive, caring - everything a mom should be
Except she had one fatal flow: my father
You see, she was raised at a time when they still had the "obey" part in the wedding vows
He was always jealous
She couldn't talk to another man without him thinking she wanted to go to bed with him
He never hit me
But the things he did to her
and she would always just take it
She never fought back
He'd get drunk and
she'd tell people she just fell down or something
Then one night
was thirteen
Something happened
My mom suddenly wouldn't take it anymore
Something made her say enough is enough
She hit back
Tat only made it worse
watched as he hit her over and over
Then he knocked her down the stairs
She broke her neck
And when y father saw what he'd done - he finally became human
He cried over her body for a while, then went into the garage and blew his brains out with a shotgun
To this day  don't remember what that final straw was
The shrinks say 've blocked it out of my memory
There's no one else alive who knows what really happened
have dreams about it sometimes, but there's always that blank spot
missing piece
She stops and closes her eyes
Jacob closes his eyes for a second also - feeling her pain
Jacob opens his eyes and touches Karen's arm
She finally turns to him
'm sorry
know nightmares are real, Jacob know
So did my mom
She taught me a lot about dreams
Like what
She told me that a lot of people have special dream powers
inherited some from her - and some  have all to myself
She showed me how  could link up with other people's dreams - to actually be inside with them
That sounds wonderful
But
don't know
little hard to imagine, huh
Yeah
'm sorry
can convince you
How
Easy
We're doing it now
Jacob smiles, gets up and walks over to the bedroom door
Karen is confused
What do you mean
mean we're dreaming
You and me
Together
He opens the bedroom door
And there's a
Karen is a little scared at first, totally blown away by what's happening
But then she stands up and smiles
(cont'd) Want to go for a walk
Karen steps up next to him and they walk through the doorway into daylight
- Shafts of sunlight filter through as leaves flutter down from the towering trees and Jacob and Karen step out of the bedroom door
don't believe it
It's true
We're really doing it
But what if 'm just dreaming of you telling me that
We'll compare notes when we wake up
Then you'll know
Karen looks around
Then she giggles
She likes this a lot
Karen suddenly runs away into the trees like an excited little girl
Jacob frowns
(cont'd) Karen
Wait
He heads off after her
Jacob runs
Karen jumps out from behind a tree and laughs
(cont'd) You have to be careful
Did you bring us here on purpose
Can you go anywhere you want
Sometimes
It's not as easy as linking up, though
Wow,  never knew
She starts wandering off again
Jacob follows her
(cont'd) You know what  like to do in my dreams
She ducks behind a tree
And comes out suddenly dressed as a sharp
Jacob is slightly taken aback
(cont'd) like to be other people
Jacob grins as she steps behind another tree - and a walks out in her place
Jacob is really taken aback this time
(cont'd) (as fireman) can be anybody  want
Show off
Karen slips past another trunk and comes out as a tall ( ) When things get bad it helps to be someone else
use it to protect myself
The redhead walks seductively towards Jacob
He raises his eyebrows as she slinks right up next to him - her ample cleavage inches away from his nose
(cont'd) (as redhead) What do you think
think  like you the way you always are
He smiles
And now Karen is herself again
They're still very close
(cont'd) Much better
They look like they're about to kiss
but Karen suddenly sees something that grabs her attention
Look
Jacob turns as Karen runs over to
It's not the one to the bedroom
It just hangs there in space between two trees
(cont'd) wonder where it goes
She reaches for the knob and opens it
Karen, no
But she's already stepped through
Jacob runs up to the doorway and it  in his face
Jacob tries to open the door
It doesn't budge
He keeps twisting the knob to no effect
(cont'd) Karen
Jacob starts to pound on the door as we: : '  - Sixties style decore, appliances that look about twenty-five years old -- not the Foster Home kitchen at all
Karen is standing in the middle of the room, completely disoriented
She walks across to a counter top where she finds a framed picture
It's a picture of , Karen, age thirteen
Karen sets the picture down and quickly walks back to the door she came in
'  - Karen steps out of her old kitchen expecting, hoping to be back in the forest again
Nope
She blinks
Then she starts to walk down the corridor
More pictures on the wall this time
One of a  and another of a  (Karen's  and )
Karen's sure of it now
She's home
The center of her worst nightmares
She creeps along to the main stairs
And that's when the  begin
thumping from upstairs
, like something hit the floor above
More thumping, repeatedly and then human , the sound of pain
Somebody is getting beaten
Oh no
Something is twisting deep inside the girl
Her face goes shallow as she slowly shuffles around to the foot of the stairs
and starts to climb them
Karen goes up, step by painful step, as the sounds of the increase in their intensity
Every hit seems to touch Karen as she flinches
She's afraid to go on - but can't seem to stop
'  - Karen slowly heads for a door at the end, nervously reaches out for the knob
' ' Karen opens the door
What she thought she was going to see was bad enough - but this is worse: Freddy Krueger is in the middle of the room
In front of him is a giant human-sized version of an inflatable punching doll, the kind little kids hit that keep bouncing back
But the doll doesn't have the image of a clown on it
It's a flattened wrapped-around version of ' , a pitiful beat-up look on her plastic face
Freddy  the doll - it falls to the floor - and just bounces back up
And now the face on it has a
He hits it again,  with glee
Swoop, bounce
More bruises develop
Krueger looks at Karen
Welcome to Romper Room
The face on the punching doll changes again, it's even sadder now
And it's looking at Karen
Why are you doing this
Don't you remember
Krueger whips up his finger knives
he them through the plastic doll
SISSSSSssss
The doll starts to deflate
SKREEEEeeeee
The escaping air sounding like a human
Freddy turns to Karen
And a  reaches out from behind her and pulls her out of the room
'  - Jacob pulls Karen away from the door and slams it shut
He grabs her hand
Come on
They turn to run down the hallway, and it's
There are now   and
The only way out is the bedroom door they just closed
They stop and Jacob turns to Karen
(cont'd) Wake up
What
You heard me
said wake up
How
This is my old house
How did get here
He begins to shake her
She is confused and disoriented is heard at the bedroom door
'
And Jacob  Karen
Nothing major
It's a good slap, nonetheless
She stares at him unbelievingly
He  her again
(cont'd) Why are you doing this to me
This is a dream
You have to get out of here
'm not hurting you, only he can really do that
Wake up now
Karen's getting angry
She doesn't know what she's supposed to do
-
Freddy blasts through the door in a shower of splinters
He sees them and grins
Gettin' kinky, huh
Jacob turns to Karen, raises his hand
-
Something blasts through the wall across from them
It's
The other wall explodes
appears in the rubble
piece of wall falls down at the end of the corridor
steps through
Karen looks at all this nonsense, then at Jacob
think  get it now
She closes her eyes and  out of Jacob's hands
The stand in the hallway
Freddy just puts his hands on his hips and  at them
Then Krueger lays his arms flat on his sides, takes a deep breath and begins to
His body expands, his clothes and skin stretch and flatten
The bottom half of him getting fatter
He turns into a giant
Power Cop jumps in front of the plastic horror and lets loose a devastating swing
The Freddy Doll swings back and right up again
The big Dream Cop pummels away at the Krueger toy as it slaps back and forth between the floor and his fist until
Two knives appear in Blade's hands and She swings them out
The Freddy Doll tears, air blasting out in a grating which screeches and hisses until it becomes: Freddy's
The red and green plastic flutters to the ground as the evil guffaws fade away and we: : '  - Karen shakes Jacob awake
His eyes open
They stare at each other for a few beats, then Karen frowns
You hit me
Are you hurt
Um
no
If he had done it, you'd be dead
Karen is confused
She doesn't know what to make of all this
She looks at a clock
It's late
You better get back to your room
We don't want anybody to get the wrong idea
(smirks) Or the right one
Karen finally relaxes
She smiles and playfully pushes him
Get out of here
Jacob reaches under a pillow and pulls something out
It's the framed photo of Karen, age thirteen - from her dream
He hands it to her and she looks at it in astonishment
That's something else my mom taught me
He gets up and goes to the door, turning back to her
(cont'd) Don't sleep
No
Not tonight
She holds the picture tightly- staring at it with those faraway eyes
-   - Scott comes out of the bathroom in his night clothes, the toilet flushing in the
He goes into his room, but stops at the doorway when he hears Karen's door open
Scott ducks behind his door as he watches Jacob leave Karen's room and head for his own
Scott frowns
His is not pleased
-   - David Ross is sifting through some mail when a heated conversation in the kitchen catches his interest
He stops to listen
Karen is finally convinced, Jacob and Scott are looking like they're ready to punch each other, and Gina looks scared
'm telling you, this Freddy guy is for real
And 'm telling you a dream is a dream
Jacob was in there with me
And where else was he with you last night
What the hell is that supposed to mean
have the picture in my room if you want to see it
He brought it out from the nightmare
Or from your hope chest
bet your bed isn't the only thing he's been into
That picture was destroyed years ago
You better watch your mouth, pal
'm the last person you want to start fucking with
Go ahead and be a tough guy, Scott
Krueger will cut you to pieces before you can even flex a muscle
Will you two stop it
You're scaring the shit out of me
You should be scared
Mr
Ross enters the room, none too pleased
Alright
What's going on here
Join the fun
Jacob and Karen were just telling us about their new excuse to sleep together
Nothing happened between us last night
You mean in plain old reality, right
Okay, everybody
Out
Jacob and  are going to have a little talk
Now
Scott, Gina and Karen grudgingly leave the room
David turns to Jacob
(cont'd) Your days are numbered here, buster
'm sorry, but
Hey,  don't know what kind of shit you're shoveling to these kids, but it's going to stop
My Good Samaritan instincts have their limits
We've had enough tragedy around this place
We don't need you making things worse with fantasies
You don't understand And  want you to stay away from Karen
Jacob starts to get defiant
It's a free country
This isn't America, it's my house
've been checking up on you
You have no record with the police or the state or any of the runaway groups
You're the invisible kid
And if  sense even a little bit more trouble-making from you, you're going to vanish from here
Got it
Yes, sir
David catches his breath
He looks like he wants to say more, but doesn't have the energy left
He just walks out of the room leaving a frustrated Jacob
- Mr
and Mrs
Ross are getting into their car
The engine starts and they drive away
'  - Jacob sits in bed, staring into space
Karen quietly enters the room, carefully shutting the door behind her
She sits down next to him
Jacob looks at her with weary eyes
You're supposed to be off-limits to me
It's okay
The Ross's have gone to a council meeting and Scott's in his room
We should be safe for awhile
Wonderful
Jacob, what are we going to do
'm going to go to bed soon
Now you  to sleep
have to find the Dream Police
think 'm somehow their link to all this
They only seem to appear when 'm around
You woke me up before  had a chance to talk to them last night
'm sorry
was scared
your fault
have to ask them what we're supposed to do to help them
And maybe  can protect Gina while 'm in there
What about Scott
He's on his own
Oh
don't mean to be cold,but we've done everything to convince him
Gina's too scared to understand
think Freddy will go after her next
What should  do
You have to stay awake
That's not going to be easy
'm half asleep already
You have to try
She nods her head quietly
Then 'd better get out of here
Okay
Be careful
be careful
'm not going anywhere
She kisses him quickly on the cheek
He needed that
Karen gets up and quietly leaves
Jacob yawns '  - Gina sits on her bed in her night clothes
She holds a deck of cards in one hand while she plays solitaire on her bed sheets
She flips a card from her deck:  black nine
She puts it on top of a ten
Another card
Queen of diamonds
She lays it on top of a king of clubs
Gina yawns
Takes another card
It's the Freddy of Spades
Gina frowns
Freddy Krueger's image stares up at her from the card
She looks at her stacks
There's no place to put this one
She starts flipping through the deck of cards, trying to see if there are any more Freddys
That's when a through the bed and grabs her arm
Gina , pulls away from the hand's grip and jumps back up on the bed
And   shoots up from a pillow and grabs her shoulder
Gina twists
More hands appear out of the mattress, lunging for any part of Gina's body as she  from their touch
And Gina jumps out of bed
She leaps to the other side of the room, bumping against her dresser drawers
Turns to her bed
The multiple hands disappear down into the mattress
There is a quiet beat as she catches her shivering breath
Then a half-dozen    pop out from the drawers next to her
Latching indiscriminately
Some grabbing her legs and arms
Some grabbing more intimate parts
Gina
Pulls away from the dresser
Yanks a few drawers out as the hands vanish and she spins over to another wall
Where the wall  with outreaching arms all around her
Two grab her hair
Three on each arm
Her legs are pinned
Gina shrieks and yells and flays her arms
Beating the hands with her fists as two grabs her breasts viciously
She starts kicking as one particularly perverse hand , pops out between her legs
Aiming right for her crotch and in an incredible show of strength, the girl pulls away from the horde
Gina heads for the door
Hands blast up from the wood floor
She leaps around them
More hands try to block her way
Gina jumps around like she's in a mine field made of hot coals
She finally reaches to door and flings it open
Gina hits the lift's opposite wall having expected it to be a hallway
The elevator's doors close on her bedroom and she turns to see: Freddy
razor finger poised over the elevator's buttons
He smiles politely
Going up
Gina is shocked and speechless
She backs away into a corner like someone trapped in a closet with the devil
Which is exactly what she is
Rising past the terror is Gina's realization that everything Jacob's been saying is true
(cont'd) At your service
He punches one of the buttons and the elevator
Gina grabs onto a wall as the lift races up and Freddy actually begins to  nonchalantly
You're not real
Ah, but who is
The elevator begins to slow
(cont'd) Fourth floor
Overpopulation
The elevator stops
The doors begin to open
Gina leaps for the way out
But she's blocked
Blocked by
They fill the entrance to the lift and start to pile in
All kinds of people: businessmen, nurses, plumbers
And they're all
Vacant expressions fill their dark hollow eyes as the zombies keep coming in
Pushing Gina back into the elevator
Filling it to capacity and beyond
The doors close and the elevator starts to move up
Twenty bodies are crammed into the tiny enclosure, smashed together, surrounding the poor teenager, drool oozing out of their mouths, breathing down her neck
her so hard she can't even yell for help
Gina turns her head
is pressed up next to her
very dead look on his face
Begin squeezed by the zombies around him
One of his eyes  out of its socket
Gina finds the breath to scream and scream and scream
(cont'd) Eight floor - the morgue
The elevator doors open and the mass of zombies starts to spastically pile out
Gina, having only been held up by the crushing bodies, falls to her knees as the last of the monsters exit the lift
She breathes in ripping gasps like she's having a coronary
But she sees the open door
And Gina jumps for the exit
Freddy grabs her shoulder and pulls her back violently
Gina falls to the floor again as the doors shut
Freddy waves his fingers down the row of buttons and stops above the very bottom one
This button doesn't looks like the others
It's in the shape of a little heart
Freddy turns and gives Gina a frighteningly serious look
(cont'd) Time to go down, Gina
He presses the heart button
And the floor disappears
Gina falls  into blackness as Freddy hangs in mid-air and Gaudy colors, mirrors, a cheesy heart-shaped bed
Gina's body drops down, unexpectedly softly, landing on the fluffy satin sheets
she's dressed in a skimpy piece of bright pink
She moans and tries to sit up
And four snake-like strips of satin swoop out from under the bed and quickly wrap around each of her limbs, pulling her down and yank her tight
She's trapped
That's when the door to the room opens and in walks an incredibly huge
He barely fits through the door as he closes it behind him
Puffy cheeks, permanent seat, dirty fingernails, and a lecherous smile
Gina's eyes widen
Hi there, princess
Your mom's told me all about you
Gina  as he approaches her, the ground actually shaking from his weight
(cont'd) She said you're even better than she is
He looms above her, now
Starts to unbutton his shirt to reveal a hideous mound of hairy stomach flesh
Gina is repulsed
(cont'd) Aw, come on
'm really a nice guy
You know what they say
Inside every fat person
Krueger's finger blades  out of the abdomen ad start tearing a huge  up the front of his body
The Fat Man starts to fold back as Freddy's head pops out of the front
is a maniac trying to get out
Freddy steps out of the Fat Man, sluffing the bulbous remains aside
He towers over Gina
That creepy serious look on his face again
(cont'd) Now it's time for  to put out, Gina
Gina gasps in horror as Krueger moves in
But then a at the door
(
) Room service
Huh
didn't order anything
Freddy frowns and walks over to the door
He turns back to Gina
(cont'd) Maybe its complimentary champagne
Krueger opens the door
On the other side is a dinner cart and a waiter behind it
The waiter is
Jacob shoves the dinner cart into the room and into Freddy's gut, shoving Krueger across the room into a tumbled heap
Three     into the room
The Dream Police materialize
Freddy jumps up growling
Power Cop grabs him from behind
Blade leaps over to the bed and in a  of steel, releases Gina from her satin bonds
Jacob yanks Gina off the bed and pulls her towards the door
Come on
Freddy jumps out of Power Cop's grip and the Dream Police surround him as the two teenagers bolt out of the room
Jacob pulls Gina along as the hotel room door  shut by itself
Gina yells at Jacob
Let go of me
She squirms out of Jacob's grip and bounces away from him like he has the plague
is heard from the hotel room
violent battle is under way
Jacob pleads with Gina
'm here to help
He holds out his hand to her
Gina shivers, than looks into Jacob's sincere eyes
of destruction continue behind the door as the girl battles with her worst fear
Finally Gina takes Jacob's hand
Let's get out of here
They start running down the corridor - together
The entire room is filled with   and , completely obscuring everything from sight
As the sound of and grunting fighters echoes, a few pieces of debris bounce into view
And then there is
The dust settles and the smoke dissipates
The stand alone in the rubble of a totally trashed room
Where'd he go
thought you had him
Shit
Krueger has escaped
Jacob runs, Gina trailing behind him, the two of them trying to find a way out
They pass a door
The door  open and Freddy reaches out, grabs Gina and yanks her into the room
The door  shut
Jacob twirls around and runs towards the door
And the door
Nothing but flat wall remains as Jacob hits it
He starts banging his fist against the side of the corridor
No no no no
The Dream police run up next to him
Jacob spins around angry
(cont'd) He's got Gina
Stand back
Everyone backs off
Sound Cop opens his mouth
An almost visible sound wave bursts forth from his lips and , a huge hole is punched in the wall
The Police leap into the hole, quickly followed by Jacob
This one's pretty normal
Maybe the business suite
And it's  except for a heart-shaped box of candy in the middle of the bed
Jacob and the rest of the Police watch as Blade picks up the box and opens it
Dozens of pour out onto the floor
Now Jacob's really pissed
You let him get away
It's difficult
He's been at this longer than we have
He can do anything
But we have to catch him in the act to get him
What
there are rules to all this
They're not rules
It's just the way it is
Jacob, we need you to bring the rest together
The rest
You mean the kids at the home
Yes
We need as many of you as we can get
And you must bring them to Springwood
How
You have the power to link your dreams with other's
Dream of Springwood, then bring the rest with you
Living souls are what he thrives on
Living souls are what we need to help stop him
Before it's too late
Before he takes everyone
And every
Jacob just shakes his head
All is
Except for Freddy and Gina
He has her from behind, his hands locked on her shoulders
Ah
alone at last
Gina cries horribly like a person who knows death is seconds away
Freddy wraps his arms around her, hugging her
And he  wrapping his arms
They  and elongate, wrapping once around his body and then around her's again
And then again
Freddy's rubber limbs curl around and around an around Gina's quivering body
Spiraling up and down
Encircling on all sides on every part of her, touching and grabbing her
Until Krueger's arms cover her entirely
Gina whimpers
(cont'd) Touching, isn't it
And he starts to
Gina gags as Freddy's snake-like embrace  around her, draining the life out of Gina's body
'  - Jacob wakes with a start as the entire house around him shakes
Gina
Jacob jumps out of bed
- Jacob dashes down the corridor
Karen comes out of her room
Is it an earthquake
No
It's Freddy
They run to Gina's room and fling the door open
' The  of the house has stopped
Gina's in bed, her tongue sticking grotesquely out from the corner of her mouth, her skin completely blue
Jacob and Karen run to her to try and help
Gina's already dead
But Freddy's not quite done with her yet
Jacob and Karen watch as Gina's chest
Karen - The coroner's back, the neighborhood gawks
Jacob, Karen and Scott sit on the front steps in a daze
But this time there are police barricades up
In another part of the front yard we can see Mr
and Mrs
Ross with a social worker,
Mary Ross is crying while her husband David is having a heated argument with Silverman
The kids watch on gloomily
The social worker leaves as Mr
Ross walks over to the kids
Mary walks right by them and into the house - to broken up over something to talk
Pack your bags, kids
You're kicking us out
No
They're taking you away
They say it's for your own good
They can't do that
Yes, they can
They consider Mary and possibly unfit to act as foster parents
They're going to find temporary homes for you until this mess is straightened out
'm so very sorry
Karen runs up to David and hugs him desperately
He holds her
No, please
They're not calling it an accident this time
They don't really know what to call it
Karen lets go
Scott stands up
What's going to happen to us
You'll be alright
What's going to happen to you
don't know
They're thinking of pressing charges
Aw, Jesus
Come on
car from juvenile hall will be here in an hour
He leads them up the stairs
- sign reads:
- Mr
Silverman, the social worker, is talking to the teenagers
Karen and Scott look understandably worried
Jacob looks like the world just ended for him
'm sure most of you know how this works already
You'll be assigned new foster homes tomorrow afternoon
Tomorrow morning the police will be talking to you regarding the matter at the old house
What about it
Anything you know
Are we considered suspects
You'll talk to the police about that
Don't worry
We'll all try and work this out
Will we be able to go back to the Ross's
don't know
You'll have a place to stay in the mean time
Will we be together
No
We don't have anybody willing to take more than one person
'm afraid you'll be split up
Great
Hey, you can visit each other
You'll be in the same town
If it's still here
Silverman frowns at that last comment as the kids get up to leave
The teenagers walk glumly out of the office
Jacob is still strangely silent, not making eye contact with anyone
Jacob, what are we going to do
Nothing
What do you mean, nothing
It's over
We're finished
He's won
Jacob walks on ahead of them
Karen is flabbergasted
She stops and just stands there with Scott
The two of them watching Jacob walk away
Looks like your hero just gave up
And Karen still can't believe it
- Jacob is sitting on a bench looking like a beaten man and hating himself for it
Karen and Scott step out of a door
They watch him for a few seconds
Then Karen walks towards Jacob
Scott stays behind and lights up a cigarette
How can you do this
Do what
'm not doing anything
Exactly
After all we've been through you just throw in the towel
Why
Because we're fucked
The last thing the Dream Police told me was that they needed all our help
Together
Even if we weren't about to be split up there aren't enough of us left to make a difference
How do you know that
don't
But, it's all just too much
've tried so hard and nothing's worked
'm spent
'm wasted
'm
'm so tired
Jacob puts his face in his hands
(cont'd) 've had enough
So you're just going to give up
'll bet that's something your mother never taught you
That hit home
Jacob uncovers his face
His  bracelet dangles from his wrist
He looks at the bracelet glints in the setting sunlight
He remembers
Jacob looks up at Karen
(cont'd) We still have one night together
And we're not going to waste it
Jacob stands up
- Jacob paces back and forth in front of Scott and Karen
Scott, we need you
Look,  don't know what's going on anymore
Two of my friends die and now you tell me  have to drop into dreamland with you guys to do battle with the dude that did it
We'll have help
Ah, yes
almost forgot
The Sleepy Squad
Alright
'll make you a deal
told you  wouldn't believe this stuff unless  saw it
If  understand this correctly, all  have to do is fall asleep and you just whisk me into the action
Right
Okay
If that happens, if both of you show up in my dream, 'll help you out
If nothing happens, then 'll get a good night's sleep and laugh at you in the morning
Fine
You got a deal
And you won't be disappointed
'm going to be sleeping in the girl's dorm
Will you be able to bring me in
hope so
Then  got to make sure we all end up in Springwood
The old stomping ground
Yeah
Only right now it's not a very pretty place
What do we do when we get there
Play it by ear
And try and stay alive
sticks his head into the lounge
Half hour til lights out, everyone
The kids get up and start for the door
Off we go
Into the wild black yonder
Scott shakes his head as they leave
'   - Karen lies in bed, under the covers
She holds the picture of herself, thirteen years old
She stares at it
Still that missing piece
Karen puts the picture on a nightstand and closes her eyes
& '   - Scott lies on the top of a set of bunk beds
Jacob is on the bottom and already looks asleep
He's still awake
Maybe he's starting to believe some of Jacob's ramblings, because he nervously fidgets in bed
Freddy Krueger
Yeah, right
Years ago some sicko gets fried and now he comes back to stick it to you when you're snoozing
Stupid bedtime story
he sighs, looks at his wrist, but his watch isn't on
Then: (cont'd) Hey, Mr
Creepoid, you still up
(a beat) Yo, Jacob
There's still no answer
Scott rolls and peeks over the edge of the bunk bed
And Jacob's not there
(cont'd) Huh
Scott sits up, looks around
And  right through the middle of his bed,  appearing underneath the top bunk
He just disappears
-   - Scott falls out of a tree and lands with a
He groans, slowly gets to his feet and takes in his surroundings
The road is dark and desolate
The street lights emit a grim brown glow and there are no stars or moon in the sky
echo through the trees and buildings
Weird , odd , eerie , and an occasional unearthly This does not comfort Scott
Oh, this is lovely
He starts cautiously walking down the sidewalk flies by with a
Scott ducks
Was it a bird or a bat or what
It's already gone
Then a craggy voice calls out from behind a tree
Hey, buddy
Yeah, what
Scott is understandably jumpy
The dark figure of a starts walking towards him
Scott backs away
Can you spare some change
Um, well, let me see
Scott starts sifting through his pockets, and the  steps out into the light
He has   and a
Scott
(cont'd) Holy Jesus Christ
The Bum grins and Scott starts stumbling away, his voice trailing off: (cont'd) 'll catch you next time, buddy
The mutant bum belches
-
- Karen rounds a corner
She walks nervously down the middle of the street
There are no cars, and she wants to keep as far away as possible from the houses on either side
There is a  sound from one of those houses
Karen turns her head to look
craggy   is rocking back and forth on her front porch
She's eating something, something stringy and slimy
She munches away with a vacant look in her eyes
The something in her hands  slightly
The old woman's meal is still alive
Karen gags and walks faster
And a  sound is heard, like two dogs
Someone is walking their pet down the sidewalk
It's the   from Jacob's opening nightmare: straggly hair, oozing sores, limping
The source of the multiple paintings is her single dog, all two heads of it
The mutant woman waves unpleasantly at Karen
Karen whimpers and starts to
- She stumbles quickly down the street
We catch fleeting glimpses of other horrors, twisted shapes, bent shadows
Karen rounds a corner, and  when she bumps into someone
It's Scott, out of breath from his own sprinting
Scott
You're here
Yeah
Fun town
Talk to any of the neighbors, yet
They're a swell bunch of folks
Uh-huh
Real friendly, too
So this is a dream
And 'm in it with you
Convinced
Maybe 'm just dreaming bout being here with you
Wouldn't be the first time
Nope
tired that one already
Doesn't work
Come on, we have to find Jacob
Scott nods and they take off down the street
cat with three tails slithers by
-   - Jacob is standing motionless in the middle of the road
He stares down into the darkness, a wooden expression on his face
Karen and Scott are running up behind him
Jacob
Thank God
So this is the place, huh
Jacob's eyes are steady
He hasn't yet acknowledged the other's presence
He eyes are fixed on the gloominess in front of him
look of vengeance beginning to grow as our on him
'm home
Karen and Scott are next to him now
They stand silently with Jacob for a few seconds
Then: What now
Scott, are you with us
deal's a deal
Then we wait
And not for long
In three bursts the Dream Police appear directly across from the teenagers
Scott and Karen jump back
Jacob hold his ground
Whoa
The threesomes stand face-to-face in two parallel rows
(cont'd) Nice outfits
Is this all
All that's left
It'll have to do
We can always come back later
Like when it's daytime
It's always night here
What's the plan
We need you to draw him out
Terrific
We're supposed to be bait
Essentially
Then let's do it
huge  , ten feet high and spreading out across the street and through the houses,  up from the asphalt
Right between the Police and the kids
The three cops crouch into battle positions
' The three of them have hardly any time to react before three perfectly round  open up underneath each of them
And Scott, Jacob and Karen fall into darkness
Sound Cop stands up and his body begins to
new noise emits from his mouth: a
And like the walls of Jericho, the bricks in front of them fall apart and tumble to the ground
Dust settles and the Police walk over the rubble to the other side
The kids are gone
Fan out
The Dream Police break formation and scatter
hole opens up in the road and ,  is elevated up into the scene and the hole seals up instantly
She jumps  a few feet and drops to her knees, holding onto the ground
She looks up at a street sign
It reads: Karen stands up and heads down the road
Another hole, and , Jacob is shot up into the street
He spins around, trying to get his bearings
It doesn't take him long
He knows exactly where he is
Oh no
He starts to run and we  him
Jacob jumps over a procession of  making their way across the street and just keeps on sprinting
Until he reaches a certain house
He catches his breath as he looks at the building, pain registering on his face
(cont'd) Mom
Jacob runs towards the house as our shot    to the mailbox and ate name printed across it
It reads - Jacob bursts through the door
He turns on a light switch
lamp  into semi-life, and keeps sputtering, casting a candle-like glow over the interior
Cobwebs and dust cover everything
Rats and tarantula spiders skitter about
Jacob grits his teeth and walks in deeper
Scott  out of the asphalt
He staggers for a few seconds from the ride, then looks at the building in front of him
puttering neon sign,  ', marks the local saloon
Muffled  and  seep through the cracks of the double doors
Scott looks around, then shrugs
He heads for the entrance
Dump is too clean a word, dive is too nice, abomination is more like it
greenish haze covers everything
Instead of sawdust on the floor there is a collection of debris that looks like a compilation of human teeth, crushed bugs, and pools of unmentionable goo
Then there's the people
Imagine any profanity, any obscenity,any blasphemy, add them all up - then double them
It wouldn't even come close to the patrons of this joint
They dance, they yell, they drink bloody bubbling mixtures
There's a guy to the right that doesn't seem to mind that half his brain is showing
That girl over there has no jaw
In a booth is a couple that are connected at the lips ventriloquist on stage is entertaining the troops with his hand up the back of a real body
Scott steps through the door and blinks about a dozen times
Then he decides that the smart course of action is to turn around and go right back out
, half his face a skull, blocks Scott's way
Two drink minimum
Ah, that's okay
think 'm underage, anyway
Two drink minimum
No, really
'm driving
Two drink minimum
The bouncer with the limited vocabulary seems adamant
Scott backs off and turns around
He carefully moves forward with three breasts slips next to him
Can  get you anything
That's okay
'll just sit at the bar
Alright, honey
You call if you need anything
You bet
You'll be the first to know
Scott turns away, trying to keep his eyes in their sockets
He slides up to the bar next to a
The man's head is on backwards, his arms lean on the bar while his face looks out into the crowd
He has to twist his neck to sip his vile drink
, surprisingly normal-looking, steps up to Scott
What'll it be
Um, a beer,  guess
The bartender fills a twisted glass with a sickly brown liquid
Chunks of matter float amongst the foam
Scott takes the drink warily and looks up at the businessman next to him
The mutant smiles at him
Go on
Puts hair on your back
And that's all
The bartender returns
Holds one of those half pineapple type drinks in his hand, except this one has the back end of a wriggling lizard sticking out of mucousy fluid under a tiny umbrella
He gives it to Scott
(cont'd) That's okay, this'll be plenty
No charge
Compliments of the man at the end of the bar
The bartender walks away and Scott cranes his head to look down the bar
' The crowd blocks his view, but we can see a gloved hand with four blades strapped to it tapping nonchalantly on the surface of the wood
He picks up his drinks, holding the moving one at arm's length, and heads down the bar
sits Freddy Krueger
He sips coolly on some hideous concoction as Scott sits down in the chair next to him and lights a cigarette, trying to look equally cool
Welcome to my favorite haunt
So you're the man
At your service
What's on your mind
deal
deal's what got me into this
Bring Jacob to me
Scott, valiantly holding on to his nerve, raises an eyebrow
What's in it for me
Power
You don't need to hang out with those losers
You're a take-charge kind of guy, Scott
Like when you took charge of your father
Suddenly Freddy is spinning a gun on the bar with his free hand
Scott grimaces
Leave my father out of this
'll make you mayor of Rosedale
After you make it look like this
You can have Karen
That was Freddy's trump card
It really hits a nerve in Scott
Karen's everything he's ever wanted
Alive
Any way you want her
(after a beat) Okay
Shake
Krueger holds out his knives
Scott shakes his head
No thanks
trust you
Freddy laughs
- ' Jacob opens the door into darkness
Mother
He turns on the light and a   blankets the room
Jacob looks up
The dish-like ceiling lamp is filled with blood
Jacob walks into the room, tears welling
He walks by Alice's vanity, her makeup still sitting there as if she might show up and use it at any moment
He steps up to a wardrobe closet and touches the edges of it lightly
He reaches out and slowly, almost reverently, opens the doors
Dozens of writhing  drop out of the closet and slither onto the ground
Jacob jumps back and
Then he just stands there in the middle of the teaming reptile mass, not giving a shit anymore, going insane
His fists clenched, his head tilted back, as he  into the air like a wolf baying at the moon
Scott steps off the sidewalk and looks up and down the street
He thinks and we   on him
Mayor of Rosedale
Scott sneers
(cont'd) What a crock of shit
We   as Scott cups his hands around his mouth
(cont'd) Hey
He's over here
Yo
Dream Police
Hello
Come on
Move you collective asses
He puts his hands on his hips and sighs
(cont'd) Never a cop around when you need one
a stabbing sound of flesh, and Scott  violently as our shot   to reveal: Freddy behind Scott, his deadly fingers buried in the boy's back
Scott chokes on his own blood as Krueger growls
hate a snitch
Freddy pulls out his blades as Scott falls forward and with his final breath utters: Eat shit
His body hits the ground with a  as a sudden  fills the air
Freddy looks around for its source
And Sound Cop drops down on him with a
The two of them tumble, then both jump up
Freddy laughs
Sound Cop looks down at Scott's body, then back up at Krueger
His body is shaking with fury,and he opens his mouth
The loudest sound yet comes from Sound Cop
blast of air at Mach 3 smacks into Freddy and sends him sailing back,  right through the Tavern wall
Freddy flies sideways, right through the bar, destroying chandeliers as he careens through and punches yet another huge hole through the opposite wall
The nightmarish customers don't even seem to notice
- Jacob is shuffling down the stairs as a   of noise echoes through the streets outside
He knows exactly what that sound means as we   on his face
Krueger
Jacob races for the front door
The dust is just starting to settle as a  is heard coming from the hole in the opposite wall
Quickly followed by Freddy's soaring body
Krueger  into some tables and slides across the floor
Power Cop steps through the hole, his fists clenched
Freddy stands up and dusts himself off
Lighten up, bone brain
Power Cop has no intention to
He bolts over, grabs Krueger, raises him over his head like a wrestler, slams him down on the bar, and  Freddy, knocking glasses and ashtrays aside until he  into yet another poor wall
Krueger barely gets back on his feet when Power Cop is right on him again
The big man in black , but this time Freddy
a support column bursts into dust
Freddy twirls around
And the two of them start to each other
It's a barroom brawl between non-humans as Power Cop and Freddy Krueger exchange multiple blows
Freddy nails Power Cop, whose head barely seems to budge from the hits
Power Cop lays into Krueger, sending him spinning and tumbling only to pick him up and start the process all over again
This goes on for a while, and Krueger is losing
The mutant bouncer finally steps up to Power Cop to try and put a stop to all this
Take it outside
Power Cop puts a stop to the bouncer with a vicious elbow in the chest
All this gave Freddy a few seconds to grab a chair and crack it ineffectually over the Cop's head
The pummeling begins again
Power Cop is punching Freddy towards the door
Like in an old wester, Krueger flies out of the double doors and somersaults onto the pavement
Sound Cop is a few yards away knelt down next to Scott's dead body
He looks up as Freddy sneers
No more playing around
Freddy raises his left fist and it begins to
It grows like an inflated beach ball, except it doesn't look soft at all
Freddy slides up to the side of the entrance, and raises his giant hammer hand
Power Cop steps through, looking for blood
Sound Cop tries to warn him
Kincaid
Too late
Freddy's fist slams down on Power Cop's head
He's actually shoved down into the ground a full two feet - trapped at the legs
Freddy hits him again
Power Cop is down to his thighs and he can't get out
is heard
Freddy turns to see Sound Cop starting to open his mouth
Krueger instantly reaches down and grabs a brick from the rubble and  it at Sound Cop
Put a lid on it
The brick lands squarely in Sound Cop's mouth, stretching it painfully and blocking it completely
Sound Cop reels from the impact
Tries to pull out the firmly wedged plug
Freddy turns back to Power Cop,
Hits him down to his hips
The giant fist swings,
like hammering a nail until Power Cop  into the ground
Freddy's hand deflates to regular size as he turns to the struggling Sound Cop
Sound Cop's head is
Pressure seems to be building up, something's gonna blow
Freddy picks up a boulder from the street rubble
He catapults it with both hands at Sound Cop
The boulder hits Sound Cop's head and takes it Sound Cop's decapitated skull tumbles away with the brick still stuck, as a blast of air shoots up from the stump of his neck with a
Sound Cop's body stumbles for a few seconds, then falls over limply
Freddy  and laughs and laughs
until a embeds itself in his back
Krueger spins around
Three more knives slam into his body as he staggers back in surprise
Blade Cop stands twenty feet away reaching into thin air and whipping out knife after knife, flinging them at Freddy
They sail like flying bullets
Krueger falls back from the sheer force of the onslaught, at least a dozen blades sticking out of his body
Blade stops
She stands there for a beat, waiting to see what Freddy will do next
Krueger sways, looking like an inhuman pincushion
Then he grins
His body steadies, and he suddenly poses like a body builder and flexes every muscle
The daggers shoot out of his torso and limbs, to the ground
The girl in black steps back and raises her arms Two-foot-long sabers jut out from her forearms
They're not held by her, they're a  of her, exiting from the tops of her wrists under her clenched fists
She crosses the blades in front of her
(cont'd) (smiling) Ah
a girl after my own heart
Freddy shoots out his finger knives and they to double their normal size
He raises them and takes on a fencing stance
(cont'd) En guard, bitch /
swordfight ensues
Freddy swinging his four long knives
Blade slashing her rapier-arms
They lunge, they parry, they leap, they duck
They connect
Metal scrapes metal
It's a bastardized version of an Errol Flynn movie and Blade Cop and Freddy are equally matched
Blade moves to get the upper hand
Blades shoot out of the girl's
Now when she takes a swing with her fists, another sword is right behind it on the follow-through
Freddy gets caught off-guard
Gets slashed twice in the shoulder and twirls away
Then starts to move
Blade counters with an equally increased intensity
Freddy ducks,  out twice quickly
fold of black cloth drops down on Blade's stomach, revealing naked skin and a little blood
They pause for a second
(cont'd) Touche
And Blade becomes  putting a Samurai to shame, twirling her legs up and out as a blade juts momentarily from her  , chopping off Freddy's left hand
Krueger stumbles back in astonishment as green goo spurts out of the stump
Astonishment turns to rage as the two converge again, swinging away at an incredible rate
An impossible rate
rounds the corner
He stumbles into the action just as the battling pair are becoming an obscure swirling Pieces of them start to drop away
Blade's foot hits the ground
Freddy's arm plops away broken sword hits the asphalt under the spinning cloud, then one of Blade's arms
as he watches, his eyes dart to try to follow the action that's moving too fast for him to see
Then there's silence
We   and   to follow Jacob as he walks into the scene of carnage
He steps up to two pills of remains: one black and flesh colored covered with red blood, the other a heap of red and green cloth, scarred tissues, and pukish green glop
Blade and Freddy have literally chopped each other to bits, the two mounds of body parts steaming in the cold night air
Jacob sees something else and walks over to it
It's Scott's body
Jacob kneels down next to the dead teenager
'm sorry, Scott
sound makes Jacob stand up
Over to the now- silent bar entrance a   punches up through the cement
With a crumbling of granite, Power Cop rises from the earth
Something else moves behind Jacob and he turns, then
Sound Cop's headless body walks into the shot, his arms held over his neck
Then Sound Cop's arms lower his dismembered  onto his stump, push it down, twist it til it stays
With great effort, Sound Cop yanks the brick out of his mouth
Jacob now looks   at something else, something that makes his eyes widen
We get to see the shadow of what Jacob sees, projected on the wall of the bar behind him
The shadow of the pile of body parts that was Blade Cop begins to
The pieces start to , leg to torso, arm to shoulder, head to neck
The shadow on the wall rises and we
Blade Cop stands across from Jacob, whole again except for a flash of exposed flesh on her abdomen to remind her of the experience
Jacob raises his eyebrows as the resurrected Dream Police step around him
(cont'd) Okay, 'm impressed Blade whips her visor up to reveal an upset girl's face
You shouldn't be
Jacob frowns as the four of them walk over to the pile of Freddy remains
But they're not remains anymore
All that's left of Freddy is a stack of  remnants
rises and pieces of cloth blow away into the darkness
The other two Dream Police raise their visors, looking equally distraught
They all face Jacob
(cont'd) This is what we were afraid of
He still exists
What
How
We're already dead, that's why he couldn't destroy us
But he's not dead
He's not alive either
He's something in between
He's not entirely part of reality or part of dreams
He's unique
can't kill him
We can wail away on each other until doomsday and not do any good
Then who's going to kill this fucker
have to
How the hell am  supposed to do that
Krueger's power comes from his rage and the souls of children
You have to find the original source of that rage and use it against him
This town in its present condition encompasses all evils from all times in its history
The answer is here somewhere
Jacob sighs, then gets an idea
think  know where
And he starts to run down the street
Jacob, wait
We have to find him first
No time
You guys find Karen
He disappears down the road as the Dream Police snap down their visors Karen stands in front of a rotted gate in front of a run down building with shuttered windows and a crumbling foundation
This isn't just an   house, it's  Elm Street house
And for some reason Karen is drawn to it
She looks to her let at the bent mailbox
It has a name plate on it
Another one underneath it
And another
It's as if people moved in and out and instead of changing the plates on the mailbox, they just whacked a new one over the old
Karen steps closer to the mailbox
The little sign on the top reads
She touches it with her finger and it drops off, the nails holding it on rusted away to dust
new plate is revealed
This one says Karen picks lightly at it, and it swings away
The name underneath makes Karen gasp
It reads
And there's still another one under that horrible name
Karen quickly hits the Krueger plate off
The last sign reads
Karen frowns
She turns back to the house, a determined expression on her face
No more
She  the gate open and walks up to the house
We've been here before, haven't we
But for Karen it's the first visit as she opens the front door and walks in
She takes in the twisted skeleton of a home for a few seconds and then begins to  it
- Karen races through, pulling open desk drawers, rifling through shelves, flipping through books
She doesn't know what she's looking for, but she knows she hasn't found it yet
- The intensity of Karen's quest increases as she yanks open cabinets and tosses plates to the floor
Still nothing
- Karen runs up them, a girl with a mission
- Karen flings the door open
Nothing but a bed and a set of drawers
No hint as to the occupant's lives
She doesn't bother ransacking this one and goes on to: - ' Jackpot
Karen stares through the open door at a child's room, a very twisted child's room
She slowly walks in
bed, a desk, a dresser
There's a Jack-in-a-box with its head torn off
disemboweled Teddy Bear
White puffy guts hanging out of it
clown doll with its face caved in hanging mobile made of strange bent shapes
And a pile of more-than-dirty clothes
Karen goes over to the pile and picks through it with her toe
small pair of pants, about the right size for an eight-year-old
black pair of shoes
And a little sweater, a     sweater
Karen goes over to the desk
There is stack of drawings on it - a child's drawings
On one of them it looks like someone was practicing writing their name
, ,   over and over again
Until the final attempt has the last name angrily crossed out, replaced underneath by a hastily scrawled
Another piece of paper: a set of human stick figures small one is labeled
The large one is labeled
The Daddy figure is depicted  the Freddy figure
There are more drawings, all of them violent, the large figure beating away at the small one
Suddenly a
Karen jumps
Hides behind a bookshelf
She's nervously trying to figure out what to do when a framed picture catches her attention on the shelf
It's a picture of a tall, dark man and a little boy
Karen reaches out to grab the picture, but accidentally knocks over a glass mug with a
can now be heard tromping up the stairs
Someone's coming and Karen's on the edge of panic
She looks around and finds an old baseball bat
She grabs it and runs to the side of the doorway as the  approach down the hallway
Karen raises the bat
And Jacob appears
Karen pulls back with the bat as Jacob jumps away from her
Jacob
You scared the shit out of me
The feeling is mutual
Where are the Dream Police
told them to look for you
What are you doing here
Don't you know what this place is
do now
Look what  found
She starts to drag him over to the desk of drawings
You've got to get out of here
Wait
You have to see this
You don't understand
The Police can't kill Freddy
They literally chopped each other to pieces and he's still alive
Now 'm supposed to figure out how to get rid of him
But  think  found the answer
Shut up for a second and look at these
She starts showing him the scrawlings
Okay, so he's a bad artist
No
You told me Krueger's mother committed suicide and no one knows who his father was, right
Yeah
Freddy's been pushing all our buttons with our pasts
These are  past
Don't you get it
was a foster child, too
She walks over to the bookshelf and grabs the picture of and '
(cont'd) Someone had to have taken care of him
This guy
he was Freddy's father
Those drawings
they were Freddy's childhood
This house
it's where it all happened
But in reality Freddy hasn't lived here for decades
Like you tried to tell me once before, this is a dream
Who knows why this is all here
All evils from all times in history
And isn't this where it all started in Springwood
On Elm Street
Jacob thinks for a second
It's all starting to make sense
But what does this do for us
There's got to be a way to use it against him
Okay, but we're not going to stand around here to figure out how
It's too dangerous
He grabs her hand and pulls her towards her door
(cont'd) Let's get out of this house
They head out to And Blade Cop is standing in the middle of the corridor
The two teenagers stop
(cont'd) Thank God
Freddy's going to show up any minute
knife shoots out of Blade's right hand, ready for action
(but wait a minute, her uniform isn't ripped anymore
)  Karen and Jacob make their way to the stairs
He turns to Blade
(cont'd) Where are the others
Blade walks up to him and stands there
Then into '
Karen
Jacob chokes
Blade Cop shoves the knife in further until it juts out of Jacob's back
She turns
Then
Time to join your mommy
Krueger yanks his finger blades out and Jacob's limp body falls at Karen's feet
Karen shrieks and cries, dropping to her knees to hold him
No no no no no no no
Jacob
He looks up at her, slowly dying
She strokes his forehead while Freddy laughs at the sentiment
Young love
ha
Karen
dream
powers
And Jacob is gone
Karen sobs, so torn apart that she is ignoring the incredible danger above her
But not for long
Krueger grabs Karen by the neck
It's past your bedtime, young lady
And he starts to  her, kicking and screaming, her body scraping across the floor towards the Freddy drags Karen in and  her across the room
She lands with a  on the bed
He saunters over to her and climbs up on the bed next to her
Gets on top
Karen yells and hits him uselessly with her fists and it's horrible because there he is, pressing down on her, right in her face, mounting her as if he's going to rape her
(cont'd) Aw, sweetheart
This won't hurt a bit
She screams as he presses even harder
(cont'd) Come on
Be Daddy's little girl
And the last three words of that sentence seem to through the room, swirling around Karen
' "Daddy's little girl
"  Karen twists her head away
And Freddy's become Karen's
He looks down on her with a lecherous grin
' That's my baby
That's Daddy's little girl
Karen stops struggling
The realization grows on her face with the resurfacing memory
Oh no
' (Freddy's voice) Now do you remember
She does
And she has an answer for him
You're  my father
' But we're going to have the same fun
Karen stares at him defiantly
And a  grabs Karen's Father, and yanks him away
We
'  is next to the bed
Furious
' That's enough
And she  Karen's Father
He stands up,  her across the jaw
She tumbles back
Karen sits up
Mommy, no
Karen's Mother gets up, a defiant look just like Karen's on her face
' You're never going to touch her again
' 'll touch what  want
He strikes her again, sending her right out the door
He follows her
Karen stands up and runs after them
The man hits the woman down to the floor
Karen's mother stands up, just taking it
She's at the top of the stairs
Karen's Father swings his arm back, and Karen jumps on him
He shrugs her away violently
as she hits the ground and the wall next to Jacob's body
She looks up
And Karen's Father is now  again
He swings his fist
Karen's Mother reels from the hit, falls backwards
Karen jumps up to try and help her, reaching past Freddy
But it's too late
Karen's Mother tumbles down the stairs, head hitting, bones cracking, disappearing into darkness
Freddy grabs Karen by the neck and lifts her
her over the top of the steps
Be honored, bitch
You're the last soul need
And Jacob   behind Krueger
him
Freddy Karen
She hits hard and rolls down the steps as Freddy turns, his knives swinging out and  Jacob's gut one more time,  him against the wall
Jacob gasps out his final breath
'll be back
'll be waiting
Freddy pulls his blades out of Jacob and the wall
The boy's body hits the floor for the last time
Freddy turns back to the stairs and looks down them
(cont'd) Where's my little pumpkin
He strolls down the steps
Freddy walks down and no one's there
Karen's Mom was just an illusion, but Karen herself, dead or alive, is nowhere to be seen
(cont'd) Play time is over, bitch
He walks down the hallway
Eyes darting
Until a is heard from the kitchen
Freddy cocks his head and frowns
(cont'd) Frederick
What have you done
And, amazingly, a look of  crosses Krueger's face
Something about that voice has struck terror in the heart of the creature that fears nobody
Krueger turns to the kitchen door
man steps out of the shadows, a big muscular man with a horrifying look in his eyes
man we've seen somewhere before - in a picture
It's '   -
And he looks pissed beyond belief
Freddy shrinks back, eyes widening
Daddy
Don't you "Daddy" me
Mr
Underwood raises his arm and  Freddy across the skull
Krueger tumbles back into the hallway
Freddy scrambles to his feet
Shakes with dread
Looks like a scared little boy
Mr
Underwood advances on him
No, Daddy
Please
Freddy turns and bolts for the front door
He flings it open
Power Cop stands in his way and  Freddy back - back in front of his foster father
- a vicious blow from Underwood sends Krueger into where Freddy falls over a couch
Underwood stomps into the room
Krueger scrambles up and heads for the archway leading into the dining room
blocks the escape
The ripped flap of her uniform proving she's the real one
She  Freddy back and into Underwood's hands
The man picks up Krueger and  him again
And again
And again
(cont'd) Stop
You're hurting me
Stop
Freddy wriggles away and opens a window
Sound Cop fills the window, cutting him off
Pushes him back inside
Mr
Underwood grabs Krueger and slaps him over and over
Slugs him
Gives the beating he's got coming to him
And Freddy  and  like a blubbering child
Shrinks into a corner but is yanked out for more pummeling
Power Cop stands at the exit to the hallway
Blade Cop continues to obstruct the dining room arch
Sound Cop steps through the window and stands in front of it
The Dream Police just stare in silence
It's not a street fight, not a punching match
Just a ruthless thrashing that would be hard to watch if it weren't for the fact that we are all cheering because no one in history has ever deserved it more
Underwood stops the whipping and stands over Krueger who is lying on the ground whimpering, pleading for mercy
(cont'd) Why, Daddy
What did  do
You took some things that don't belong to you
And with that, Underwood brings his fist down and  it into Freddy's stomach
Right
Shoving it into his very body
Freddy
Underwood violently pulls his fist out and there's  in it
shimmering flowing thing
Crackling with unworldly
It's a
It's Wesley's Underwood flings his arm out and lets go
Wesley's soul flies into thin air and
Krueger's father brings his hand down again and  out '
Again
'
Freddy opens his mouth and shrieks
As Underwood raises his arms and begins to of light bounce around his body
He's changing
And something's happening to Freddy's too
Steam is rising from the creature
His feet are starting to flatten as he lays on the ground and   oozes from his pores
He's melting
And still screaming as he watches his foster father's image turn into: An aura of  vanishes around her body as she lowers her arms with a victorious yet sad look on her face
Freddy
look of horrified realization burns in Krueger's eyes as he sees Karen and  to scream inhumanly
His body dissolves, all of it liquefying into
Gone
Just a bubbling black puddle of gunk is left
His echoes through the room and everywhere else
Then the  grows and changes into a dark cloud that begins to
Power Cop runs up, grabs Karen and yells
We gotta get outta here
Karen, almost mesmerized by the black cloud spreading in front of her, stumbles away with Power Cop
The Dream Police and Karen bolt out the front door and run down the street as a  joins Freddy's thunderous and the entire town begins to
We stay with a shot of the house as the noise and vibrations continue
And the Elm Street House
The   punches out the roof and the walls, sending wood and debris flying everywhere
The rubble flies into the air, hangs there for a beat, then falls to the ground
All is
And the dark cloud turns
The milky fog spreads out
Karen falls to her knees on the pavement, not looking back at the destruction one block away
The Dream Police stop running to turn to face her
Karen hangs her head and cries
Blade steps forward
It took a human touch
It took knowing nightmare
Goodbye, Karen
Karen raises her head as the Dream Police turn away
'  - walk off into the distance
Just as they are about to vanish into the darkness, a   appears and joins them in formation
Then they all disappear
Her mouth drops open at what she's just seen
What she ' see is the white cloud swooping down the street behind her
She just closes her eyes as the ivory mist envelops her and the
: - Karen lies sleeping on the bench amongst the grass and trees
Her eyes open and squint at the bright light
She sits up and tries to get her bearings
Some hair falls into her face and she brushes it away
Only then noticing that she's holding something in her hand
She opens her hand and looks down
' It's an  bracelet
band of gold with a larger plate dangling from the middle of it
Karen's hand turns it over
This time the printing reads
she chokes back the tears
We hear a
Then a woman's voice
You okay, honey
Karen looks up as we
pleasant-looking woman, no longer a mutant, is walking her cute dog
She looks sincerely concerned
Karen nods
Yes
'm alright
've never seen you around
Are you new in town
Sort of
Well then
(she smiles) Welcome to Springwood
The woman continues on her way
Karen sighs and puts the bracelet on her wrist
She stands and our as the pretty young girl starts walking through a town she's never seen - except in her dreams
