Written by Ricky Gervais & Matthew Robinson June 8, 2007 -    - small caveman community made up of five large caves, all facing out towards a crackling fire
Slack-jawed, yet strong and confident  stumble about, dragging haunches of meat, pounding the dirt with sticks, dragging the women
to a small cave
Not even really a cave at all, but a crack in the rocks barely large enough to sleep in
Stepping out of this "cave" is a small, weak, nerdy-looking caveman
The chief caveman, set apart by the large mallet he wields, steps towards the fire and grunts loudly to mark the beginning of a caveman meeting
"Loser caveman" steps forward apprehensively, only to be met with laughter from the other cavemen
"Loser caveman" sighs and shrinks back into his sad, little cave, watching them from the shadows
(grunting; subtitled) Me see beast today
Beast scary
Beast danger for caveman
The rest of the cavemen look nervous
If caveman kill beast
Caveman safe
Caveman have food
The cavemen grunt in understanding
Who kill beast
The cavemen grunt amongst themselves
The toughest of the bunch steps forward, pounds his chest and grunts
Grob kill beast
Good Grob
The chief notices "loser caveman" watching from a distance
Loser want kill beast
All the cavemen turn and laugh at the "loser caveman"
Loser kill nothing
2
All the cavemen laugh hysterically
#1 Look at Loser cave
So small
#2 Loser dumb
#3 Fuck that guy
All the cavemen pick up rocks and begin throwing them at the "loser caveman", who dives out of his cave and runs around the camp, dodging their blows
-    - Everyone in the village is asleep
Everyone, that is, but "loser caveman" who sleeps uncomfortably in his tiny little cave, tossing and turning, unable to get comfortable
stirring in the trees causes "loser caveman" to sit upright
There's something outside of the village
Something big
Suddenly a    pushes through the trees and stands, looking quite menacing, not ten yards from the village fire
"Loser caveman" is practically shaking with fear
The boar makes eye-contact with "loser caveman" and charges directly towards his tiny little cave
The giant boar runs head first into the cave opening, but the opening is too small for the beast to fit its head inside
"Loser caveman" screams like a girl
The boar backs up to strike again -- this one sure to be the end of "loser caveman" -- when a large boulder, knocked loose by the Boar's first hit, tumbles down and lands smack on the Boar's head, killing it instantly
The entire village runs out to see what has happened
The "Loser caveman" stumbles out of the cave and dusts himself off
The chief steps forward
The beast
It dead
3
#2 Hey, look at loser
He almost die
Look he scared
Everyone laughs
The Chief looks towards Loser, standing nervously near the corpse of the Giant Tusked Boar
Loser, what happen
() The Beast, it came at me
It smash my cave
Everyone laughs hysterically
over the many laughing faces, pointing and hooting at loser caveman's cowardice
We watch as the "loser caveman's" face turns bright red, the veins in his neck pop out and his fists clench up tightly
into the caveman's skull, traveling through his cerebral cortex and towards the frontal lobe of his small, homo erectus brain
Sparks are flying back and forth across his brain as his synapses fire in rapid succession
There is a
We fly back out of "loser caveman's" skull -- his face contorted in rage
He interrupts everyone's laughter
Hold on one minute
Everyone stops laughing
Loser wasn't finished
Loser caveman stands up straight and tall -- all of a sudden the Bruce Willis of cavemen
After beast smash cave, Loser look at beast and say, "not on Loser's watch
" Loser grab rock on ground, lift above head and smash it down
right onto motherfucker's head
The entire village gasps
4
Loser kill beast
() Now fuck off, Loser going back to sleep
The chief steps forward ominously, then proclaims: Loser kill beast
Loser caveman hero
Loser steps forward, grabs the prettiest of all cavewomen and drags her towards his cave as the entire village erupts in cheer
: The world's first lie
monumental occasion in the history of mankind
() That lowly caveman who stumbled upon the ability to lie went on to become chief of his village, married dozens of cavewomen, and passed on the lying gene to hundreds of newborn cave-children
() Over time lying spread throughout the world, sparking the eventual birth of imagination itself, story- telling, religion, and the oh-so- important polite lie, as in, "Oh Patty, have you lost weight
You look fantastic
" () The world would be a very different place if events had gone otherwise on that prolific, Paleolithic eve
If not for that night, man would have never acquired the ability to lie to himself and to others
() world without lying would be a world without dreams
world without pretense
world without fiction
world without flattery
world very unlike our own
: The film rewinds about thirty seconds, to the point where the chief asked what happened with "loser caveman" and the boar
5
Loser, what happen
() The Beast, it came at me
It smash my cave
into the caveman's skull, traveling through his homo erectus brain
Sparks are flying back and forth across his brain as his synapses fire in rapid succession
But this time there's no explosion
We fly back out of "loser caveman's" skull -- his face contorted in rage
The rage slowly fades and Loser just stands there, everyone in the camp waiting for him to say something
Rock fall on beast
Loser do nothing
think Loser even soil bear pants
(pause; sniffing) Loser smell bad
Everyone falls onto the ground laughing hysterically
Loser biggest loser ever
Caveman, throw rocks at loser
Everyone in the camp joins in on another round of throwing rocks at "loser caveman" as he runs around the camp, terrified and miserable

" : '   - completely indistinguishable Los Angeles mid-rent apartment complex
pulls up in his early nineties Volvo, parks and enters
6
'   - Mark (40's), average to semi-handsome, twists and turns through stucco hallways
He knocks on apartment "9C"
opens, her face flushed
She's beautiful
Hi
You're early
was just masturbating
That makes me think of your vagina
'm Mark, how are you
little frustrated at the moment
Also equally depressed and pessimistic about our date tonight
'm Jennifer
hope this date ends in sex
Not me
don't find you attractive
Come on in
Mark enters
Jennifer's apartment is new-adult, as if she just found out she was an adult yet hasn't had the time or the money to complete the transition
need to finish getting ready
While doing that  might realize 'm still horny and try to finish masturbating without you hearing
Jennifer heads towards the bathroom
Mark stands alone in her living room, looking around
(shouting to her) feel awkward and  regret being early
7
(
) (shouting back) Yeah, 'm disappointed you're early and not really looking forward to tonight in general, but the thought of being alone the rest of my life scares both my mother and equally
It's completely silent for a long beat
Mark looks around, then sits on her couch
(shouting to her) have an erection now because assume you began masturbating once we stopped talking
More silence
(shouting to her) 'm embarrassed because  think the restaurant 've made reservations at might not be expensive enough or hip enough to impress you, but it was the best  could do because don't make very much money
You see, 'm forty years old and have no real financial assets to speak of, 've never owned a home, and never had a significant relationship
My boss even told me today that 'm most likely going to get fired tomorrow and
Jennifer enters the room and Mark stops talking
just masturbated
That makes me very horny
Shall we go
Sure
Mark stands up
Jennifer picks up her purse and opens the door
8
After you
'  - Mark and Jennifer drive in silence for a beat
'm only doing this as a favor for my cousin Greg
He keeps begging me to go out on a date with you
He says you're funny
Greg's a good friend
Where are we eating tonight
cute little place called La Bonisera in West Hollywood
You obviously don't have very much money but that's not necessarily a deal breaker
have very little money
also don't really care about a guy who knows all the latest, hippest restaurants
don't know any of them
In fact, there are very few things in life that  care about all that much
The only things  have to offer myself or anyone else are my good looks and my affected sense of quirkiness which artistically inclined men interpret as intellect
() 9
(cont'd) In fact,  think my best trait is the fact that 've made very few mistakes: socially, academically, financially or romantically
take very few risks and therefore lead a relatively happy and light-hearted existence
Mostly though, 'm a kind, sweet person with the potential of genuinely becoming a vital and interesting human being the day  take the energy  expend on hyper self-reflexivity and apply it to actual action in the reality of my life
found that boring and started thinking about this place's fish tacos
- The Volvo pulls up in front of the restaurant and the valet parking guy opens Jennifer's door
'm extremely bored
Hello
The valet parking guy hands Mark a ticket
- They enter the quaint Mexican restaurant
This isn't as nice as  remember it
What are we going to talk about
They approach the hostess
(to Jennifer) 'm threatened by you
Two, please
10
Of course, come with me
The hostess seats them in the midst of the semi-crowded restaurant
young, awkward waiter approaches
'm very embarrassed that  work here
Hi
Hello
Hello
(to Jennifer) And you're pretty and that only makes me feel worse
Can  get you two started on some drinks
'll have a Budweiser
'll start with your Mango Margarita and probably have three more drinks by the end of the night
Excellent
(to Mark) She's out of your league
Yup
The waiter leaves
Jennifer and Mark peruse their menus woman screams out from a table on the other side of the room: () All of a sudden  got angry
No one in the restaurant reacts
11
'm going to ask you some questions about your life because that's what you do, but 'll only really listen to about half of what you're saying
Jennifer nods
How do you spend your days
get up at eight in the morning because the noise from my alarm clock interrupts my sleep, so lean over and
That's a little more specific than expected
Well what did you want to know
Do you have a job
Yes
What job do you have
have a job at an office
What do you do
Just typing and filing and stuff
Do you enjoy it
No
But  enjoy the end result of the job which is money
And the hours are pretty good for the amount of money  make, which spend on things  like, such as clothes, hiking, drinking -- even though  know it's bad for me
() 12
(cont'd) () But 'd rather just get all the money and not work for the results
Sure
Tell me more
'm trying to get a little insight into you
Well you already know a lot about me
You know 'm good looking because
well
here  am
You know 'm successful because you've seen my apartment and the clothes 'm wearing
And you know 'm happy because 'm smiling
Jennifer smiles brightly
Are you always happy
Usually
Some days  stay in bed eating and crying
Sure
The waiter returns with their drinks
(hands beer to Mark) Here you go
(hands drink to Jennifer) had a sip of this
Okay
Do you guys know what you want or do you need a moment
'm ready
'll have a caesar salad with chicken because  think 'm fat but also think  deserve something that tastes good
13
'll have the fish taco's because had them once here and it's all know
Excellent, 'll get those both started for you
The waiter leaves
Jennifer's cell phone rings from inside her purse
Sorry, one second
She pulls out her cell phone and checks it
It's my mother, this won't take long
Probably checking in on our date
Jennifer answers the phone
She talks openly and in plain view of Mark
( ) Hello
Yes, 'm with him right now
No, not very attractive
No, doesn't make much money
He's all right though
Seems nice
Kind of funny
bit fat
Funny little snub nose
No,  won't be sleeping with him tonight
Nope, probably not even a kiss
Okay, you too
Bye
Jennifer hangs up
Sorry about that
Don't think twice
How is your mom
She's all right
Fantastic
: Both of their plates are now empty
Three empty Margarita glasses sit in front of Jennifer
14
The waiter approaches with the bill and places it down in the middle of the table
(to Jennifer) If  give you my number will you call me
No
'   - Mark walks Jennifer to the front door of her apartment complex
Thanks for going on this date with me
You're way, way out of my league and  know you were just doing it as a favor to Greg, and that most likely 'll never hear from you again
actually had a better time than thought 'd have, but  won't know for sure how  feel about you until 'm less drunk
Give me a call if you still like me once you're sober
might
Mark leans in for a kiss
Jennifer kisses him on the cheek and goes inside
Thanks for kissing me on the cheek, know you didn't have to do that and
Jennifer waves and heads inside
(shouting after her) you're very pretty
Thank you
15
'  -  - Mark plops into bed in his boxers
His bedroom is bland, uninspired and completely furnished by the cheapest stuff found in an  catalogue
Mark flips on the  and gets under the covers
commercial comes on
: man in a suit stands next to a single can of coke resting on a small table
Hi, 'm Jim and 'm the spokesperson for the Coca-Cola company
'm here today to ask you to continue buying coke
'm sure it's a drink you've been drinking for years, and if you still enjoy it, 'd like to remind you to buy it again sometime soon
It's basically just brown sugar water, we haven't changed the ingredients much lately, so there's nothing new about it  can say
We changed the can around a little bit
See, the colors here are a little different, and we even put a polar bear on it for the kids
Also, coke is very high in sugar, can lead to obesity in children and adults who don't sustain a healthy diet, and has a Ph acidity level high enough to dissolve teeth and bones over extended periods of time
Coke also works great at removing corrosion from car batteries and loosening rusted bolts
So that's it, it's coke
Everyone knows it
It's very famous
'm Jim,  work for coke, and 'm asking you to not stop buying coke
That's all
Thanks
: Coke logo with tagline: "It's Coke
It's very famous
" Mark falls asleep with the  on
: 16
Mark's alarm clock blares
Groggily he rises and sighs deeply
He has nothing to look forward to today
Or any day
- '  - Mark stands in his building's elevator
The doors open and , mid-forties and bald, enters
Hi Mark
How's it going
Not so good
Last night  went on a date with a girl 've had a crush on for years who will most likely never call me again and 'm pretty sure 'm going to get fired today
You
spent the whole night throwing up pain killers because 'm too afraid to take enough to kill myself
The elevator doors open on the lobby
Mark nods at Frank
See you tomorrow
Bye
'  -- As Mark drives to work we take in a bit of his world
homeless man stands on a street corner with a sign that reads: " don't understand why 'm homeless and all of you are not
" business man talking loudly into his cell phone pulls up next to mark at a red light
'm not talking to anyone on my cell phone
only want people to assume 'm very busy
At another red light Mark eavesdrops on a couple having a loud argument in front of a coffee shop
17
woke up this morning and realized that, not only do  not love you, but that the thought of touching you sickens me
The more you hate me the more fall in love with you
Bus passes in front of Mark's car
: The bus ad simply shows a can of Pepsi, and reads: "Pepsi
When they don't have Coke
" car honks behind Mark
The man leans out of his car and yells at Mark
Move it, fatty
Mark drives forward, waving to the man apologetically as the man zooms past him
-   - Mark parks his car and walks towards a large office building
The sign on the building reads: " -- We Film Someone Telling You About Things That Happened
" In front of the building is a man in a suit standing on his briefcase with his tie around his head, screaming
This isn't natural
None of this is natural
We're all animals
This doesn't feel right
Why am wearing clothes
How can you people live like this
Where did all this concrete come from
Mark walks right by him
woman in a business suit stops him on his way through the front door
don't want to go in there today
just don't
You know
Mark nods understandingly and enters the building
18
-  - As Mark walks through the lobby we get a brief glimpse of some of the movie posters lining the wall: "The Holocaust", "The Death of the Dinosaurs", "Napoleon", "The Civil War"
Each poster shows a different austere man sitting in a chair, holding a script in his lap, with a title above his head
The posters are extremely boring
tour guide leads a row of tourists through the lobby
As Mark enters we overhear the tour guide's speech
All of Lecture Films' productions are written, filmed and edited right here on this very lot
In fact, this building is where Lecture Films' talented writers scour through the world's past events, searching for the most entertaining, dramatic and even hilarious moments of world history, which are then turned into scripts, handed over to our world-famous Readers, and filmed for your viewing pleasure
The whole tour "oohs"
The tour guide walks over towards a large flat-screen television embedded into the wall
If you'll just follow me over to this monitor you'll get a sneak peak at Lecture Film's upcoming summer's blockbuster: "Napoleon 1812 to 1813
" Everyone "oohs" again
Mark, curious as well, stops to watch the trailer with the tour
:
black screen
Coming this summer from Lecture Films Motion Picture Studios
Written by Oscar winning screenwriter Rob Marlowe
Mark scowling at this name
19
(
) And starring Oscar winning Reader Nathan Goldfrappe, comes the epic sequel to last year's most talked about film: "Napoleon 1810 to 1811"
Prepare for the adventure
The black fades to  , a middle-aged austere man sitting before a fire in a velvet smoking jacket, holding a script
() And so Napoleon invaded Russia with a brute force of nearly seven hundred thousand men behind him armed with muskets and supported by canon brigades
(
) Learn of his defeat
() Through the devastating snow they marched, crippled by disease and hunger, Napoleon's men marched on
(
) Listen to his redemption
the tour, enraptured by this trailer
few of the tourists whisper to each other
#1 love these films
Saves me reading the book
the trailer title slamming onto the screen: Napoleon 1812 to 1813
Coming this summer from Lecture Films
The trailer ends and the tour applauds
The tour guide turns to find Mark walking away
Look everyone, there goes Mark Bellison, one of Lecture Films very own screenwriters
The whole tour turns towards Mark
Mark turns around and dejectedly waves
20
He's one of our least successful writers here at Lecture Films
() also hear he's most likely getting fired today
The tour nods at Mark
Mark nods back
Now let's head to editing bay where we can watch
- '  - Mark walks past cubicle after cubicle until he comes to his office and , his attractive late-20's receptionist
Hi Shelley
'm still attracted to you today
Hi Mark
Everyday  realize more and more how over-qualified  am for this position and how incompetent you are at yours
Any messages
Anthony's coming by within the hour to see if he can work up the courage to fire you
If he can't, he said he'll definitely do it tomorrow
Nobody else called
No calls to do with actual work
Well,  told everybody you were getting fired this week and not to expect their calls returned, so no one left any messages
Next time 'd rather you took down the messages just in case  don't get fired
21
You're almost definitely getting fired
Well, it hasn't happened yet
Okay, but everybody knows you are
Okay, 'll be in my office
Okay, 'll be searching for new jobs on Craigslist
- '  - Mark's office is completely boring and unremarkable, much like his apartment
There's a knock on his door
enters, looking very much the boss in his expensive suit, yet nervous and fearful as well
Wow, you look really depressed today
That's going to make this so much harder
Anthony, don't fire me
Anthony sits down on the other side of Mark's desk and leans forward
Mark, the 1300's are boring
Nothing interesting happened in that century
Nobody cares about the post-Roman, pre-enlightenment era
The last few scripts you turned in were depressing
They were about the black plague
It's the 1300's Anthony, what else am  going to write about
22
It's not totally your fault, Mark
You got stuck with a bad century
No
can make it work
Give it up Mark, it's not like something new is going to have happened in the 1300's
At Lecture Films we're no longer interested in searching through the less well- known historical periods for great events, we just want to take the big name Reader's of the day and have them read the historical events that people know and love: the holocaust, -day, the birth of electricity
These are the stories people want to see, because they know them
They find comfort in them
Anthony pauses
Do you think  could come back and do this tomorrow
just got very nervous about firing you
don't do well with confrontation
Is there anyway you could do it now
'd rather not put it off
Anthony thinks for a moment, struggling to find the courage
() You're fired
Damn
Anthony slinks out of the room
Mark looks down at his computer to see he has an email in his inbox
: '  -- The email reads: " woke up this morning, sober, and realized that, while  did enjoy your company, based on your looks, your financial situation and your position in life,  have no interest in you romantically
'm just too far out of your league
-- " 23
Mark sits back in his chair and sighs deeply
She's a really good writer, too
- '  - With all of his meager belongings stuffed into a box, Mark leaves his office, stopping in front of Shelley's desk
loathed almost every minute worked for you
often fantasized about you naked
What are you going to do now
have no idea
But  have very little hope for the future
don't have much hope for you either, but  wish you good luck
Bye, Shelley
Bye, Mark
Mark heads towards the elevator and is stopped by , a little weasel man with a hip haircut and expensive clothes
So they fucking fired you, huh dipshit
always knew the Black Plague would never work as a movie
Guess the 1300's were as much of a loser as you are
Please don't make me feel worse
Or actually whatever, go ahead, don't think  could possibly feel worse
24
fucking always hated you
You're a shitty writer assigned to a shitty century and you're a little man bitch
But  was always threatened by you because  knew there was something different about you that  didn't understand and fucking hate things  don't understand
But you will always be a loser and  will always be more successful than you in nearly every way
That's just the way it is
And Shelley calls you an ass fag behind your back
Well, now  feel worse
Rob storms off
Mark slinks into the elevator and hangs his head in shame as the doors close
- : "      " Mark enters the building
- Mark walks up to the front desk to find a young receptionist
Are you looking to abandon an elderly person
already have
Martha Bellison
'm her grandson
Ooh, it's good you're here
She's not doing well
You should say your final goodbyes today
You say that every time 'm here
She's at the top of our death pool
25
Mark walks down the hall, passing different elderly people who reach out to him
#1 You look like my dead son
#3 Life gets worse with each passing minute
#4 'm on pills that make everything orange
Mark opens a door and enters
'  - An elderly woman in a light blue robe sits on the side of her bed, with her back to Mark, staring at the wall only inches from her face
Oh Grandma, that is so depressing
Come on, at least stare at the ceiling or something
Mark takes his grandmother by the hand and steers her to the other side of her bed
The television is broken
The television isn't broken
You probably sat on the remote and changed it to channel two again
Mark flicks on the  with the remote
Static fills the screen
He changes the channel and a picture comes into view
See, you had it on the wrong channel
It needs to be on channel three in order for the satellite to work
don't understand anything you just said and that makes me scared and angry
26
can't understand what it feels like to be you so it just irritates me and makes me think you're stupid
But  also love you and wish things were better for you
do too
Grandma,  lost my job today
'm forty years old
'm completely alone and 've got absolutely no prospects for anything
'm sorry, Mark
Things aren't any better for me here
can't afford most of my medication, 'm very alone and  forget more and more every day
'm just so tired of life
Why does life have to be so
what's the word
Don't you sometimes wish you could change things
Don't you sometimes wish you weren't such a loser
don't think 'm a loser
Of course you're a loser, grandma
Our family is made up of losers
We're all poor, we're all average looking, we're all only moderately intelligent, we're all lonely and unloved
Well, we're poor because we weren't born with money and it's very hard to make enough money in a single lifetime to move from one social class to another
We're only moderately intelligent because there's been a lot of inbreeding in our lineage
And we're only lonely and unloved right now
Remember, 've had two husbands  loved very much in my lifetime
() 27
(cont'd) And maybe one day you'll have a wife that you love very much too
Yeah, but 'm not talking about the past, Grandma
'm talking about right now
And right now we're both losers, Grandma
We're both shitty, shitty losers
Don't you know that
suppose we are
But things could be worse
We could be homeless
'd rather be dead than be homeless
That's why  need to get out there and find a job
If  have to be homeless, 'm going to kill myself
Well that's sad
love you, Mark
Good luck finding a job
love you too, Grandma
Mark leaves
As he shuts the door from the hallway he hears the channel change and turn back to static
(
) Oops
- Mark and his friend  (40'), an even less attractive, less interesting and less intelligent version of Mark, are bellied up the bar with half empty beers in front of them
'll start looking for a job tomorrow
Lately  don't like Indian people
() don't like white people even more though
fucking hate white people
fucking hate people
28
Hey, thanks for setting me up with your cousin by the way
Third cousin
She's hot right
Very
Way out of your league
Dunno why you bothered
It felt nice to go out with someone that pretty
Like for just one moment  experienced what it would be like to be the type of person someone like that would date
It felt good
Doesn't matter anyway will always be just who  am right now: average looking, of average intelligence with an average personality
Just a completely generic human being
Your life is still better than mine
By a good margin
sad beat
Lately 've been crying in my sleep and waking up in a pool of urine
really wish  had a better friend than you
So, what are you going to do now
don't know
Guess 'll start looking for another crappy job
29
Doubt you'll find one
Not much need for an out-of-work writer specializing in the Black Plague
Mark downs his last shot
'm going to go now
You're seriously depressing me
really wish  was cool enough to have a better friend than you
'm the best you're gonna get, man
Call me later
Yeah
Mark gets up and drunkenly stumbles out of the bar
'  -  - Mark drunkenly lies in bed
He picks up the phone and dials
( ) Hello
Mark just breathes, too scared to say anything
( ) Hello
can hear you breathing
Is this a rapist
() No, it's Mark
'm sorry
Mark hangs up quickly, embarrassed and ashamed
He sighs and turns off the light
: The alarm clock goes off
Shut the fuck up,  don't even have a job
30
Mark tosses the alarm clock across the room and goes back to bed
loud banging wakes Mark who groggily stumbles out of bed
'  -   - Mark opens the door to find his landlord, a middle aged, well- groomed man
'm here for the rent
was going to come talk to you about that
got fired yesterday
know
That's why 'm here for the rent
Well,  haven't got it
How much do you have
think 've got about three hundred dollars in my bank account
The rent is eight hundred dollars
know
haven't got it
Then you're evicted
'll help you with your things
stunned Mark stands helpless as the Landlord pushes past him, grabs a lamp from his living room and carries it out into the hallway
Help me with the couch
It looks heavy
Mark sighs and follows the Landlord back into his apartment
31
'   -  - With all of his belongings piled up in the hallway, a tired and sweaty Mark stares defeatedly at his landlord
You have one day to get your things out of this hallway
How am  supposed to do that
You've got three hundred dollars
Rent a truck
Oh, fuck me
Mark grits his teeth in rage
- Mark steps up to the female teller at the bank
Mark is at the lowest point in his entire life
How can  help you today
'd like to make a withdrawal
Okay, sir
'm confident  can help you with that
've just been evicted from my apartment so  need to withdraw what  have left in my account so can move my things out
guess need to close out my account to do that
() think 'm about to be homeless
: This sinks in
32
Unfortunately sir the system is down right now so 'm not going to be able to perform an account closure until the system is back up
But  can assist you in a withdrawal
How much would you like to withdraw
Well, 'd like to withdraw eight hundred dollars
The bank teller smiles at Mark
How much are you going to withdraw today, sir
All of it
Just whatever is left
The system is down, sir
Please tell me how much you have in your account
At the peak of his despair something suddenly comes over Mark
His face turns a light shade of red as the wheels begin to spin in his brain
He is fighting something within
into Mark's skull, traveling through his cerebral cortex and towards the frontal lobe of his brain
Sparks are flying back and forth across his brain as his synapses fire in rapid succession
There is a small explosion
We fly back out of Mark's skull -- his eyes are locked on the Bank Teller's like a deer in the headlights
Sir
(awkwardly fast) Eight hundred dollars
Pardon me
33
(more confident) have eight hundred dollars in my bank account
The teller locks eyes with Mark
then looks towards her computer
Wait a second here
The system just came back up
(to co-worker) System seems to be back up, guys
(to Mark) Just one second while  access your account
You said you're withdrawing eight hundred, correct
Mark breaks out in a cold sweat
Yup
The bank teller types on her keyboard
Well, look at this
It says here you've only got three hundred dollars in your account
But you said you wanted to withdraw eight hundred
Mark doesn't know what to say
He tries to speak but nothing comes out
apologize for this sir, but it seems our system has made a mistake
Hold on one second while go and get your eight hundred dollars
Did you want that in large or small bills
Mark gulps
Large bills
The teller walks away
Mark looks around nervously, awkwardly smiling at the other tellers
34
(to co-worker) Guys the computers seem to be a bit buggy
Will someone call James to come in and look into it, please
Moments later the Bank Teller returns and begins counting out eight hundred dollars for Mark
Mark stares at the money with wide eyes
There you are
Eight hundred dollars
Anything else  can do for you today
In shock, Mark shakes his head
The bank teller smiles big at him
Sometimes our computers can get a bit buggy, especially when the system goes down
Sorry for any inconvenience
It's no problem
Mark takes his money and hurriedly walks away
Bursting out of the bank, Mark is a caveman who just invented fire
'   --  1A Mark knocks on his ' door
short, stodgy old man opens the door
What are you doing here
Mark holds out a wad of money
Paying my rent
The landlord looks at the money and slowly reaches out to take it
Where did you get this money
35
It was amazing
went in to the bank and the system was down and was going to take out three hundred dollars but she asked me how much 'd like to take out and
Mark stops himself
Something else takes over within
found it
Lying on the street
The Landlord and Mark both lock eyes for a tense beat
Okay
Lucky
Give me my key back
'  - Mark jumps around his apartment, dancing and screaming
Mark is a caveman who just invented sex
(
) Today  stumbled upon something no man has ever stumbled upon before
What  have done today they will write about in history books for generations to come
And yet, only moments ago
it was unfathomable not only to myself, but to mankind as a whole
What  have found there is no word for
And it was as simple as
(long pause) how do  explain this
(long pause) : - Mark and Greg sit at the bar, Greg half listening as an inspired Mark ends his monologue
(') said something
that wasn't
Greg perks up
36
Huh
said something
that
wasn't
what's the word 'm looking for
Well, there is no word
Of course there's not,  just invented it
Mark is frustrated by his inability to explain
Here
Watch
(calling over bartender) Jim
, mid-40's, short and stout, waddles over
What
Mark, stands up, clears his throat, and holds his hands out like "gimme some room"
There's a long pause as Mark summons his newfound talent: () My name is Doug
Greg and Jim look at Mark confusedly
(dead serious) Your name is Doug
(without hesitation) Hi Doug
It amazes me that  never knew your real name
() Doug is good
It suits you
Mark is flabbergasted
Come on guys
Are you serious
What's my name
37
It's Doug
Doug
No
My name is Mark
(still dead serious) Your name is Mark
(still without hesitation) Hi Mark
Mark suits you much better
Mark-o
You guys aren't following me
() Okay, guys
'm black
knew it
You're very light skinned, but can see it
've always wanted a black friend
Mark punches the bar in anger
Fuck it, 'm an Eskimo
Fantastic
've never seen a black Eskimo
Okay, 'm a pirate
didn't know they still had those
38
Are you a dangerous pirate
Okay then, 'm a lion tamer
and have purple hair
Aren't you scared you'll get bitten one day
(to Greg) want to die my hair purple just like Mark's
Greg nods
Mark sighs
: "  " Mark sits at the bar looking completely bored
'm a one-armed Jewish space explorer
When's your launch date
Shalom
How'd you lose your arm
invented the bicycle
love your work
Can you get me a discount on a ten speed
Mark sighs, finishes his beer and gets up to leave
give up
And 'm bored
Mark heads towards the door, dejected
He turns back
Guys, if you had the power to make things the way you wanted them, what would you do first
39
If  could do anything in the world
Anything at all
Pretty much
Greg and Jim think this over long and hard
'd bone bitches asses
Right in the ass
Specifically the ass
If  could change things  would make all the hot chicks bone me
Agreed
Mark mulls this over
Alright then, let's try that
Mark downs his beer and heads towards the exit
Where are you going
Out
- Mark walks the street, a hunter looking for his prey
Within seconds Mark spots a gorgeous blonde walking right towards him
He stops in his track, quickly trying to decide how best to proceed
But as the blonde passes him he just stares at her like a deer in the headlights
40
Don't look at me, 'm not attracted to you
The blonde walks away
Mark stands on the sidewalk staring off into space, the wheels in his mind working overtime
Then it hits him
Wait
Don't bother
've heard it all before
() '
Immediately the blonde's eyes well up in tears
She is terrified
Do we have time to get to a motel or do we have to do it right here
Mark is a caveman who just invented his penis
-- The neon sign outside reads " Cheap Motel for Intercourse with a Near Stranger"
We slowly   on the door of room 206
We hear noises inside that at first sound like moaning, but as we get closer
they sound more like crying
-  206 - Bawling her eyes out and sitting on the bed doing her best to get her shoes off, is the hot blonde
Mark sits across from her, a look of guilt and revulsion on his face
This is not what he expected
() 'm sorry, 'm just so scared don't want the world to end
() 41
(cont'd) don't want to die in this motel room
think 'm going to throw up
Help me get my pants off
Mark stands up
The blonde grabs him and pulls him towards her
He pulls away
This isn't right
The blonde screams and drops to her knees
No
We have to have sex
The world is going to end
Think of the children and little babies
Mark looks down at this panicked, helpless girl and feels really, really bad about himself
Just calm down for one second
Mark walks over to the phone and picks it up
How can  be calm
The world might end any second
' ' (to phone) Hello
Yes, it's
me
Oh, good
That's very good news
Good news indeed
Mark hangs up the phone
The blonde is rocking back and forth on the bed in a fetal position
We're going to be okay
The world isn't going to end
Everyone is going to be fine
The blonde tackles him in a bear hug, sobbing and laughing
'
We're going to live
Thank you
Thank you
The blonde falls onto the bed in exhaustion
42
This has been the worst
and the best
day of my life
Okay,  gotta go
Oh no, please stay
We've been through so much together
Mark stares at this helpless girl for a moment
'm an asshole
The blonde's face and mood do an instant 180
() Well,  hate assholes
Get out of here
The blonde chucks her shoes at Mark as he closes the door
-- Mark walks across the parking lot
look of total shock on his face
- Greg is in the exact same position Mark left him in, but he's twice as drunk
Mark plops down next to him, dazed and upset
That was one of the worst experiences of my life
(-) Did you invent a new kind of bike
What else would you do if you could do anything in the world
Bone chicks asses
That's what 'd do
43
What else though
What's the second thing you'd do
Greg nods off
Mark nudges him
What else would you do, dipshit
'd get money
'd get all the money
Greg passes out
Mark nods his head, takes the three full shots sitting in front of Greg and does them all
Yeah
Let's do that
Greg, let's go
What
We're going on a trip
Greg immediately perks up
'll drive
'  -- Greg is driving, Mark rides shotgun, both of them are completely plastered
Thanks for driving man, 'm completely plastered
'm just as hammered as you
But don't care if  get arrested
'm trying to hit bottom
- come the flashing lights of a cop car right behind them
Greg begins to pull over
Here comes bottom
Mark looks worried
The cop comes to Greg's window
44
Nothing safer than pulling over two nerdy white guys in their forties
don't want to go to jail
Are you drunk
Yes
Then you're going to jail
Blow in here, son
The cop pulls out a Breathalyzer and holds it up to Greg's mouth
Wait, officer
Don't do that
don't think you can afford my bribe, son
How much does it cost to bribe you
At least five grand
Wow, that's high
need to feel that 've got some sense of integrity
Greg blows in the Breathalyzer
Whoa, that's off the charts
Step out of the car, son
You're drunk and going to jail
Greg opens the door
Wait
() He's not drunk
45
Greg stumbles and falls, passing out in the dirt
The cop stares at Mark for a long beat while his brain wraps around this
Oh
The cop bangs his Breathalyzer against his leg
Damn thing must be broken
In the background we can hear Greg vomiting profusely
The cop picks up Greg and puts him back in the driver's seat
(to Greg) Son, you might want to drive yourself to the nearest hospital
You have food poisoning or some kind of flu
Mark is basically passed out, vomit drooling down his chin
He couldn't look more drunk
The cop and Mark stare at him for a beat
(to Mark) Maybe you oughta drive, son
Good idea
Driving away with Greg in the passenger seat, a giant smile comes across Mark's face as he begins to laugh
That was awesome
Stop laughing, 'm sick
You're gonna be all right, Greg
Oh good
Greg vomits all over himself
46
Stupid stomach flu
() Where are we going
Vegas, baby
Vegas
- Mark pulls in front of the Bellagio hotel and casino
Both Mark, and a very hungover looking Greg, pop out of the car
Mark hands the keys to the valet and they both stumble inside
- It's the Bellagio
We've all been there
What are we doing here
We don't have any money to throw away
Sure we do
Mark pulls out a small wad of money
What is that, a few hundred bucks
That's not going to last us very long
Sure it will
Mark and Greg step up to the chip counter
Mark slides his small wad through the window
Chips please
The   looks at his money
There's a very good chance you'll lose all this money here tonight
know
47
And even if you do happen to win, there's an even better chance that in the long run we'll win it back
know
Some of the games are fixed
Like all the ones that use computers
know
The woman slides him a short stack of chips
Greg frowns
Mark and Greg walk towards the tables
Mark and Greg look around
cocktail waitress approaches
If  could be a stripper  would, but 'm not attractive enough
Drinks, guys
No
have a stomach flu
We'll both have beers and we'll take them at that roulette table over there
Mark points to a table and walks away
The waitress nods
Oh come on, roulette is the stupidest game of them all
It's pure chance, no skill whatsoever
It's okay
'm feeling lucky
You've never had a lucky day in your life
Just watch
They arrive at the roulette table
48
Get your bets in, get your bets in
The house always wins in the long run
Because of the zero's on the board every bet is slightly favored towards the house
Mark puts his chips down on seventeen black
The dealer starts the wheel
The ball comes to a stop on twenty-seven red
Twenty-seven red
No one wins
In full view, Mark slides his chips over to twenty-seven red
'm on twenty-seven red
The dealer looks at this
His brain takes a moment to respond
We have a winner
Congratulations, sir
The dealer stacks up Mark's new chips and pushes them over to him
You did it
You just, like, quadrupled your money
You lucky son of a bitch
That's nothing
Watch this
Mark puts all of his chips on double zero
bunch of other people scatter their chips around the table as well
Get your bets in, get your bets in
The house always wins in the long run
Fork over your money right here folks
say this so often want to kill myself
The dealer spins the ball
It comes to a halt on nine black
Nine black
No winners
49
Mark takes  of the chips on the table, both his and ' and slides them together into a giant pile and sits them right on nine black
'm on nine black
These are all mine
The table cheers for Mark
Some people are a bit confused, and a slight hubbub arises in the background: " thought had chips on the table
" "Yeah, me too
" "We must be drunk
" "That guys is lucky
" Even the dealer looks a bit confused
but gets over it quickly
Nine black wins
Big winner
Congratulations, sir
The roulette dealer slides about five grand in chips over to Mark
Greg's jaw is on the floor
Do it again
Mark notices the confused people around him
don't think  should
Lets go play slots
Mark is talking to a Pit Man right in front of a slot machine
Hi,  just won a major jackpot on this slot machine but no money came out
'm sorry about that, sir
Let me get that fixed for you
And can say congratulations, sir
Thank you
The Pit Man whispers a few words into his lapel mic
Mark and Greg, each carrying four giant buckets overflowing with chips, waddle through the casino
50
This is the most amazing night of my life
-   - Mark and Greg lounge around the Bellagio penthouse suite, piles of chips and cash lying around them
Greg is pacing delightedly
Mark lies on the couch, unsatisfied
It amazes me the winning streak you're on
You must be the luckiest man in the world
Well, sort of
It was like we couldn't lose
We couldn't lose
Do you have a system
've got a system
Well, with your system in just a few weeks  figure we could be the richest people in the world
And then what
Well, here's what 'm thinking
We take all the money in the world
and put it on black
Why put it on black
Why stop there
Put it on a number and get thirty five times back
Greg's eyes widen at the thought
That's exactly what we'll do
51
Hold on,  think  found a flaw in your plan
How can they pay us if we have all the money in the world
Well, they'd just have to
Well, they can't because we've got it all
Well, they'd better find it
They can't let us bet if they're not going to pay us back
They'll have to just give us the casino
We already own the casino
We've got all the money in the world
We'll be betting against ourselves
Then we'll go to another casino
We own that one too
We won that
So we own all the casino's
Yup
And if we win we can't pay us back because we already have all the money
Yes
Greg thinks this over for a long beat
Only one thing we can do then
'm listening
Take ourselves into the back room and break our own fingers
52
Brilliant
'   -  - Mark, exhausted from his long night, waits for the elevator to arrive
The elevator doors open and Frank, the depressive neighbor, steps out
Hey there, Frank
Mark
How's it going
Pretty good, thanks
Frank stops and turns around, this is a different response
Really
Yeah
You
Awful
was doing some internet research last night about suffocation suicide
'm probably going to give that a try tonight
Oh
() All right
Bye, Frank
Bye
Mark gets in the elevator, Frank walks away
short beat
Mark exits the elevator and yells after Frank
Frank
Frank, halfway out the building, turns around
Yeah
Don't do it
53
Frank thinks this over
Why not
'm miserable
And no one will care
'll care
You're a loser, though
Don't do it, Frank
Things are going to be all right
They are
Yes
You're going to meet someone soon
You won't be so lonely
Things are going to turn around at your job
My job's actually fine
Well, things are going to get better
Better than they are
What about the depression
It will go away very soon
You're going to be happy soon, Frank
You just need to wait for it
Listen to me: you don't need to kill yourself
Something changes in Frank
slight smile comes over him
Really
Really
Frank laughs
54
Wow
Man, and that suffocation thing really seemed like a good idea
It wasn't
Okay
Well, my night's open now
You want to hang out later
don't know
Not really
Frank's smile fades a tiny bit
Sure
Of course
Let's hang out
'll see you after work
Great
Mark gets back in the elevator to the sound of Frank laughing to himself as he exits the building
We hold on Mark for a moment as he smiles and nods his head
'  - Mark sits at kitchen table, pen and paper in hand
(
) () 've discovered something today very important
and very powerful
Mark doing various good deeds throughout the day
plays throughout
Marks walks up to the homeless man with the " don't understand why 'm homeless and you are all not" sign
He says something to the homeless man, who quickly drops his sign and follows Mark
(
) 'm as excited as 've ever been in my entire life, and equally scared
() 55
(
) (cont'd) 'm writing this down in a letter in case this thing 've discovered somehow ends up killing me
want to ensure that, even if  wasn't strong enough to use it, that my invention doesn't once again disappear, never to be discovered again
Mark and the homeless man are at the bank
Mark is talking to the bank teller
The homeless man looks at Mark nervously
The teller leaves and comes back with stacks and stacks of cash
(
) In just a few hours since stumbled upon my discovery  have seen its potential for evil and have seen its potential for good
Outside Lecture Films, Mark talks to the woman who was adamant about not wanting to go to work
He whispers a few words into her ear
She smiles, picks up her briefcase and gladly walks into work
(
) must be careful with my discovery, for at this point barely understand it, let alone think  have the power to control it
All  know is that if 'm not careful  could easily do irreparable damage to the world, or even cause my own premature death
Mark walks up to the arguing couple at the coffee shop, who are now sitting at different tables, not even looking at each other
He pulls up a chair next to each of them, individually, and says a few words to them
Within moments, the two of them are running into each other's arms and making out passionately on the floor of the coffee shop
(
) Now, to explain my invention
In essence, my creation is the act of saying words that simply are not
For example, if  tell someone that my eyes are blue, then it simply becomes fact
still know that, indeed, my eyes are brown, but no one else is aware of this fact, so therefore  have blue eyes
() 56
(
) (cont'd) It's a game of numbers: there is only one of me who knows  have brown eyes, and so many of them who do not
The numbers always win
Mark is at the elderly home, walking the halls and whispering to his grandmother and each elderly person he passes, leaving each one of them with a smile upon their faces, and some with tears streaming down their cheeks
Whoever is reading this, go ahead and try it
Tell someone your eyes are a different color then they are
think you'll be amazed at the results
It's so simple and yet
so powerful
this thing 've invented
Mark and Frank are watching  in Mark's apartment
The two of them are drinking beers and having a good time watching television
(
) Au Revoir, future reader, au revoir
Mark signs his letter, seals it in an envelope, writes " " on the outside of it and sticks it in a drawer in his kitchen
'  - Mark lies in bed watching
He picks up the phone and dials
Jennifer
It's Mark
Are you gonna hang up on me again
No
Maybe
Who knows
'm calling because  want to ask you out on another date
Why would you do that
57
discovered something yesterday found out  can pretty much have my life anyway  want it from now on
Congratulations
gotta go
Wait, and  know you said you didn't want to date me ever again, but 'm different now
Things have changed
think 'm in your league now
You're better looking
No
'm not better looking
'm just more
powerful
think you have to see it for yourself
Have you been to the gym
No,  haven't been to the gym
It's just
it's amazing
Things are different for me now
You have to see this
think you'll hardly recognize me
Did you buy better clothes
No, look can we just meet up
There is silence on the other end of the phone
Jennifer, If there was even a glimmer of something about me that you liked, please say yes
You even admitted that we got along well
Just give me one more chance
Just one little teensy, tiny date
Okay, fine
58
Fantastic
Tomorrow night
'll pick you up at eight
Most likely it'll be our last date though, so just know that
() That's very sweet
No it wasn't
Did you not hear what said
Yeah, no  was being
(pause; searching) there's no word for it
See you tomorrow night
Bye
Mark hangs up happily
(
) In Our World
in the 1800's
: The screen is all black
(
) came the greatest revolution of them all
(climactic music) The Industrial Revolution
The black fades to  , a middle-aged African American man sitting before a fire in a green smoking jacket, holding a script
(
) Written by famed screenwriter Rob Marlowe and read by Oscar winning Reader Angelo Badsmith
Hello, 'm Angelo Badmsith
Come watch me read about the exciting events that took place during the Industrial Revolution
() 59
(cont'd) Also,  will tell you all about my personal misfortunes, such as my wife who cheated on me with a man named Perry
The screen reads: "The Industrial Revolution
Summer `07
" : His eyes are wide
The wheels in his head are spinning again
Rob Marlowe, your streak of success has finally come to an end
Suddenly Mark jumps and runs to his kitchen table
He grabs a pen, pulls out a sheet of paper
and begins writing
: Mark writing furiously throughout the night, piling up page upon page
By the time the sun comes up Mark is exhausted, with barely the energy to keep his head up as he writes "the end" and places the final page on his large stack of finished pages
: -   - Mark hustles through the parking lot, manuscript in hand
He reaches the door and then stops -- remembering something
Mark runs to the curb and throws his manuscript onto the dirty, filthy street
He gets down on his hands and knees and rubs his manuscript into the grime, making sure to get every page equally filthy
Satisfied, he organizes the pages into a neat pile and enters Lecture Films
- '  - Mark walks the aisles of Lecture Films
People stop to stare at him
There is a whispered hubbub from the many cubicles and offices
Mark passes his old office, stopping to read the sign on the door: "14TH  --
" Mark grimaces and keeps walking
(
) He's gone crazy
60
Mark turns his head to see Shelley, standing down the hall, terrified, staring at Mark
Mark ignores her and keeps walking
Leaning against his door jamb, is Rob, smirking as Mark passes him
Come to beg for your old job back
Hey everybody, here's the loser who thought the Black Plague would make for an interesting film
Good luck, douche bag
Freaking loser
Mark walks right up to the door that reads, "Head of Development -- Anthony James
" Mark opens the door
Anthony is on the phone, his back to Mark
( ) They're going to fire me any moment,  just know it
'm really, really horrible at my job
don't know anything about movies
don't even like movies
like sports
Head of development, what does that even mean
'm not a smart person
Okay, talk to you later
Anthony turns around to find Mark
His face becomes very, very scared
That was the head of the studio
() 'm very scared that you're mad at me about the whole firing thing
'm not mad at all
Anthony is relieved
Oh good, because  feel really bad about it
mean,  would be horrible at your job too
would be horrible at any job in this place
() love sports
They both stare at each other for a long beat
61
Why are you here
Mark pulls up a chair
When you fired me,  was very depressed
knew it
And so  left this building and just started walking
And  walked all the way out of town
And then walked into the desert and  fell asleep under a tree
don't do well with other people's life changing events
And when  woke up  found this strange old chest sticking out of the ground
So  started digging
And  unearthed a very old and ancient box
Probably, oh
about
seven hundred years old
And inside the box
(holding up manuscript) was this
Mark places his muddy, dirty, manuscript down on Anthony's desk
Anthony is scared to touch it
What is it
It's a never-before-heard historical event from the past
When does it take place
The 1300's
The excitement drains from Anthony's face
62
told you we're not interested in Black Plague movies here, Mark
This one isn't about the black plague
Well it isn't just about the black plague
Let me read you some of this
Anthony rolls his eyes
Anthony, get excited about this
This is a brand new event from history that no one has ever heard before
It's a great human discovery
Yeah, but is there a movie there
The greatest movie Lecture Films has ever made
Anthony's eyes widen
Start reading
Mark picks up the manuscript and opens the first page
() On the very first day of the fourteenth century, a momentous occasion occurred
It began as a day much like any other
The sun rose, the people awoke, workers began to work, babies began to cry
But all of that was interrupted when a giant flying space ship crashed down from the skies and landed in the heart of Babylon
Anthony's mouth drops to the ground
What
Mark smiles
Anthony picks up his phone and presses "intercom"
63
( ) want everyone in here now
We've got a
Anthony hangs up
Please, Mark
Continue
() As the smoke cleared, the door to the spaceship opened and inside, were hundreds of beautiful, half naked alien women
: The room is filled with people now, all of them hanging on every word Mark reads from his manuscript
Even Rob and Shelly lean against the back wall, their minds blown by the story Mark is telling
() And then the ninja army unleashed a giant fireball that brought the robot dinosaur to its knees, saving Mars, Earth and the Nude Amazonian Alien Women all in one sweeping motion
The earth was saved
Jebediah and Aleena were allowed to marry by alien king Xardon
It was to be the First Human-Nude Amazonian Alien Woman wedding, and no expenses would be spared
All of Babylon and Mars were invited to join in the celebrations
People around the room wipe tears from their eyes
() The wedding was held on a brisk summers day on Mars, with all of the survivors of the Great Ninja War and the Black Plague present
They feasted and danced and laughed and it was a joyous occasion
() 64
(cont'd) The moment the bride and groom kissed, King Xardon performed a mind-wipe on all of the humans, thereby erasing all knowledge of these events from their minds, and sent them back to Babylon
For seven hundred years these events would be forgotten by mankind until one day, a great writer by the name of Mark Bellison, would stumble upon them in the desert, after being fired by his shit boss Anthony and mocked by Rob and Shelly, two huge douche bags
Lecture Films Motion Picture Studios would go on to make the picture and it would be a big success, and Mark would become very wealthy and famous from it
The End
The entire room bursts into applause
Not just normal applause, but massive, epic applause
Everyone crowds around Mark, hugging him, touching him, blown away by the magnanimity of the moment
Mark, tell us what it's called
Mark thinks it over for a moment and looks right at Rob
(to Rob) The Black Plague
Rob sneers
Everyone "aahs" and claps again
- Mark and Jennifer sit at a candlelit table in the corner of a hip and fancy restaurant
Jennifer looks beautiful
Mark is on cloud nine
Congratulations on selling your script today
Thanks
Thank you for having dinner with me
65
Everyone needs to eat
() And  enjoy your company
Mark smiles
They both sip their drinks and look at their menus
The waiter comes up
'm an extremely important waiter
() What can  get you
don't want to know what it is, just want to order the most expensive thing on the menu
'll have the duck
And  think you look like a little rat faced man
Okay, 'll have those right up for you
The waiter leaves
Mark and Jennifer stare at each other for a short beat
Something has changed between them and they can both feel it
Things seem to be turning around for you
Today is the best day of my life
Hands down
Easy
Best day
It's not every day you unearth a monumental historical event and sell it for a ton of money
That wasn't the best part
It was great, but it wasn't the peak of my day
() 've had a crush on you ever since saw a picture of you on Greg's refrigerator two years ago
Oh
66
The best part of my day today is right now, sitting at this table here with you
Oh
You're the most beautiful woman 've ever seen in my life, and you're special
and it makes me happy to be around you
Thank you
Jennifer is touched
but she doesn't reciprocate Mark's feelings
Jennifer moves on
Tell me something about your family
really don't know much about you
Ah, my family
We're what you'd probably call "not lucky"
My whole family is kind of marked by tragedy, bad luck and general
shittiness
It goes back a long ways and could probably drive someone to suicide just hearing about it, so 'll keep it simple
My mom died when  was six
Cancer
Sad
And my dad got real depressed and lost his job
Out of work and with a kid to raise he had no choice but to turn to a life of crime
What kind of crime
He was a robber
Houses mostly
: 67
- Nice, mid-to-upper class home
Lots of white wood
The house is very quiet, until
the phone rings and the answer machine picks up
'  (
) (on answer machine) Hi, 'm calling to let you know 'll be robbing your house today
'll probably be there within the hour
() hope you're not there
The message ends
to a   standing in the doorway
She drops her coffee and screams
: - He was a very unlucky man
He spent his last days behind bars
never really knew him
(sad moment; pause) But  guess 've also had a little luck in my life
did have a wonderful grandmother who raised me
Oh, that's sweet
Yeah, she's great
Where is she
Old person's home obviously
Who wants to live with that
Gross
know, right
But 'm going to get her out of there tomorrow
() 68
(cont'd) 'm going to buy her a big beautiful mansion where she can spend her few remaining days in luxury
That's nice
The waiter arrives with their food
don't know what's wrong with the chef today, but these just look awful
He places them down
They look fine to me
Well, you're stupid
Mark and Jennifer begin eating
Mark wants to say something and takes a moment to summon the courage
Right
was thinking that since 'm going to be rich and successful now that  might be in your league
() And that maybe we could be together
Romantically
What would be the point
Mark didn't expect this answer
Well,  don't know, maybe we might enjoy it
Maybe we'd be good together and could have a happy life, raise a family together
Jennifer thinks this over
Well,  do like you
And  enjoy your company
() 69
(cont'd) And if we were to get together and procreate  would like the offspring that are carrying half my genetic code to be well taken care of and financially stable
also think you'd make a good father and a good husband, which  like
Mark smiles
This is going well
Good
Fantastic
Unfortunately, none of that changes the fact that you'd still be contributing half of the genetic code to our children
() don't want short, fat kids with little snub noses
And that's the end of that
Mark nods
Sure
Mark takes a bite of his food
Jennifer smiles and does the same, oblivious to Mark's pain
Mark's cell phone rings
( ) Hello
() What
Mark's face melts in terror
( ) () - Mark bursts into the hospital room to find his grandmother, looking tired and scared, hooked up to dozens of machines, the heart monitor beeping ominously
Grandma, they just called me
What's going on
Are you okay
70
don't know,  fell on my way back to my room
What do the doctors say
They say 'll probably die tonight
What
There's a knock on the door
The doctor enters
Oh, hello
was just coming in to check on her, you must be Martha Bellison's grandson
What are you talking about she's going to die
'm sorry
It just doesn't look good
She's suffered a major heart attack and her heart is very weak, her pulse not very strong, her blood pressure is dropping rapidly and most likely she'll have a fatal heart attack during the night
Fuck
The doctor checks Martha's chart
Yup, still going to die
Mark sits down next to Martha, in total shock
'm sorry, guys
wish  felt something for you two, but  really don't
do this exact thing about thirty times a night and it's really hardened me to human suffering
On a side note, it's fajita night at the cafeteria downstairs
You might think about grabbing a bite to eat there after your grandma dies
71
The doctor leaves
Mark holds his grandmother's hand, her hand is shaking
'm so scared, Mark
don't want to die
You know, people don't talk about it much, but death is a horrible thing
One minute you're alive, there's a whole world around you, humming and jumping, people coming in and out, doors opening and closing, love and anger and the whole mess of it all, and then like that, it's all gone
() This is it Mark, only a few hours left of this until an eternity of nothingness
The wheels in Mark's head are spinning again
Suddenly the heart monitor starts beating rapidly and Martha lurches in pain
Grandma
Mark immediately slams on the big red "call nurse" button, holding his grandmother down as she lurches in pain
Seconds later three nurses burst into the room
#1 She's seizing
Nurse #2 begins filling a syringe
Mark sits by his grandmother's head, they're both looking right at each other
'm scared
Listen closely to me, Grandma have a surprise for you
We focus on Mark and his grandmother, inches from one another as the paramedics busy themselves around Martha's dying body
You're wrong about what happens when you die
It's not an eternity of nothingness
Martha is hanging on to every word Mark is saying
72
When you die you're going to go to your favorite place in the whole world
And you're going to be with all of the people you've ever loved and who have ever loved you
And you're going to be young again, and you'll be able to run through the fields and dance and jump, and there will be no sadness, no pain, just love and laughing and happiness
There will be ponies made of gold, and everyone will live in giant mansions, and everything will smell like cookies
And it will last for an eternity, Grandma
An eternity
Tears are rolling down Martha's face as a glimmering smile overtakes her face
Mark looks up to see the nurses, paramedics and doctors all staring at Mark in total shock
#1 Go on
What else happens
The cardiogram flat lines
Do your jobs
Everyone distractedly goes back to helping the grandmother
You're going to be happy forever, grandma
promise you
Say hello to my mom for me
Tell her  love her
Again, everyone has stopped helping Martha, they're all listening intently
Some of them are crying
#2 () 'm going to see my mother again when  die
Tell us more, please
73
Martha stops breathing
The machine flatlines
And with that Martha is gone
Damn it
Mark turns away from his grandmother
Standing outside in the hallway is Jennifer, watching Mark with true empathy in her eyes
'  -- Mark and Jennifer pull up in front of Jennifer's apartment
There is a long beat of silence
'm so sorry, Mark
think  just did something bad
Do you want to come inside
Mark nods his head
'  -   - Mark and Jennifer sit side-by-side on her couch
Mark holds a can of beer in his hand, gently turning it around in his palm, staring down at it vacantly
Jennifer sadly watches Mark
Slowly and almost absentmindedly, Jennifer's hand moves over and rests gently upon Mark's wrist, settling there
We hold on them for a long beat
: Mark and Jennifer have fallen asleep in the exact same position, both of them sitting side-by-side no the couch, her hand still on his wrist
Mark opens his eyes and looks down at her hand, then up at Jennifer who slowly opens her eyes and smiles at him
74
Hi
Hi
They share a moment
'  - bleary eyed Mark drives home from Jennifer's
As he turns onto his street he finds hundreds of cars blocking the way massive crowd of people are leaving their cars and walking
Mark gets out of his car to find a wild scene: hundreds of people camped out on the lawn of his apartment building
Standing by his door is the  from the hospital
She immediately points at Mark and screams
#1 There he is
Mark is bum-rushed by a question-asking throng
All of them are pelting Mark with questions, all of them confused and hopeful and desperately looking for answers
#1 Is there only one place you go when you die
#2 Will everyone who has ever died be there
#3 What's this place called
#4 Will  get to have sex with people there
Mark pushes through the crowd, overwhelmed by it all
He gets to his door and opens it, only to have the Nurse step in his path and block the door
#1 You owe us an explanation
If you know something this important, you better tell us all
Who are you people
75
#1 The words you spoke last night, to your grandmother, spread like wildfire
Please, tell us more
Explain what you said
Fine, fine, just give me a minute
Mark pushes past her and into his building, closing the door behind him
'  - Mark goes to his fridge and pulls out a beer
His mind is reeling
As he opens a drawer to get a bottle opener he sees the letter: " "
Mark eyes it ominously
The phone rings
Mark screens the call
(
) (leaving message) You've been gone for twenty minutes and  turn on the
to see you on every station
What's going on
This is seriously the weirdest thing
Mark picks up the phone
Remember last night when  said think  did something bad
Well now know  did something bad
They're saying that you know something different about what happens after you die
Mark walks into his bedroom and turns on the
Sure enough there's a newscaster on his lawn, giving a report, with a banner on the screen that reads, "New Death Discoveries"
Hold on
Mark puts down the phone and listens to the
(
) Twenty-four hours ago, Mark Bellison was just your typical nobody writer
() 76
(
) (cont'd) Today, people are saying he knows new information about what happens after you die
Mark puts the phone to his ear again
Fuck
Mark, what do you know
What did you tell your grandmother last night
What's going on
can't explain it all right now
Why don't you come over
Okay
'   - Jennifer pushes through the throng of people, which is now even larger than before
As she reaches the door Mark opens it for her and slides her through
Come up quick, they look like they could get out of hand any second
Mark hurries Jennifer into the elevator
'  -   - Jennifer sits on the couch while Mark, agitated beyond recognition, paces the room
Just tell me what you told your grandmother
don't think  should
Who knows what could happen next
'm just going to keep my mouth shut from now on
What you said obviously affected a lot of people
don't think you have the choice to keep it in now
77
Sure  do
could just walk out that door and get on a plane and go to Namibia
No one knows me in Namibia
Just tell me what you said
Please, Mark
My grandmother was dying, and she was terrified, shaking all over
She didn't want to just become nothingness
So  told her that when she died there wouldn't be nothingness
That she would be with all of the people she loved who had died and that she would live an eternity of joy and happiness
Jennifer's heart skips a beat
(barely able to speak) How do you know these things
Mark sighs and looks out the window
The crowd extends down the block, all of them sitting calmly on his lawn, talking quietly to each other, trying to make sense of it all
Jennifer gets up and stands beside Mark
You have to tell them everything you know
This is too big
You have no choice
But you don't understand
The words said
they weren't
it's not right
How did your grandmother feel when you told her these things
Happy
At peace
And how did that make you feel
78
Good
(sweeping her hand over the crowd) Think how good it will feel to do the same for all of these people
Mark thinks this over
Okay
But  need a few hours to get my thoughts together
'll go tell them
Wait
Are you sure this is right
Of course it is
You know something that's going to change mankind forever
It's the most important thing the world has ever heard
Jennifer leaves the room
Mark, alone with his thoughts, sits down at his kitchen table, pulls out a few sheets of paper, grabs a pen and starts writing
: '   - Mark's neighborhood is a sea of candles
The crowd has grown beyond measure
massive sea of people, all holding candles, all waiting quietly like serene cows for Mark to come down and make his announcement
'  -   - Mark is hunched over his table writing
There's a knock at the front door
Greg walks in with a large pizza and beer
brought pizza
How come you never told me we all get mansions
didn't
79
Jennifer comes out of the bedroom and quickly "shhh's" Greg
Inventing the bicycle is one thing, but this
Shut up
Let him work
Jennifer pulls Greg away from Mark
Mark goes back to work
: Mark puts down his pencil and places both written sheets next to each other
He has finished
'  -  - Mark opens the door
Jennifer and Greg are on his bed watching
The same newscaster stands outside the building
(
) In Seoul Korea, they wait
In Rome, Italy, they wait
In London, England, they wait
In New York City, they wait
The world has come to a standstill, everyone at their televisions and radios, or here on this lawn, waiting for Mark Bellison to come forth and tell the people what he knows
Mark waves his manuscript in the air
'm done
Jennifer and Greg jumps off the bed
Are you ready
guess
'  -   - They head towards the door
80
feel like  should be reading these off of something other than just notebook paper
wish they were like, written on large tablets or even just nicer paper or something
Greg grabs an empty pizza box off of the counter, rips it into two pieces and tapes his two pages onto them
Mark holds the two halves of the pizza boxes awkwardly and nods his head
Feels better
Mark looks at Jennifer and Greg with fear in his eyes
Just tell them what you know Good luck out there, man
'   - of Newscaster cameraman
The newscaster is interviewing a young man, with Mark's apartment building in the background
heard that he said we all get mansions, and that there's even ponies
(to cameraman) Ponies
Mansions
Ice Cream
These are the things we can all expect when we die
What else can we expect
We won't know until Mark Bellison steps out of that
() Mark cracks open the front door and steps out onto his front steps, with Jennifer right behind him
The newscaster and cameraman run to get into position
Mark looks out at the sea of people staring silently at him, waiting for answers
81
Hello
man runs up and hands Mark a microphone
Oh, thanks
His voice echoes through the neighborhood
Wow
You could hear a pin drop
No one is even breathing
So
guess you've all heard the things  told my grandmother last night and
understand why you're here
() know
some things
Some very important things
And 'm going to share these things with you now
Intercut throughout: different video feeds, people listening to radios, standing in the cold watching 's through store windows -- all around the world
Mark takes a deep breath and holds up his "pizza box commandments"
Everything you want to know is written here
On this old pizza box
Mark looks out at the crowd, all of them so hopeful, so needy
Mark looks back at Jennifer and Greg who give him a proud nod
() Number one: There is a man who lives in the sky who controls everything
Number two
#1 (interrupting; shouting) Whoa, whoa whoa
What does he look like
Mark wasn't prepared for questions
82
() Tall
Big hands
good head of hair
#1 What ethnicity is he
(making it up as he goes) He's a new ethnicity
It's like a mix of all of our ethnicities
#2 Does he live on a cloud
#3 Can we see him
(becoming confident) No
He lives much higher than the clouds, too high to see
#2 So he lives in space
No, not that high
#3 So you mean the Thermosphere
Look, people  got a lot to get through here
'm just telling you what  know: Man
Lives in the sky
You can't see him
Controls everything
Cool
Everyone nods
Number two: When you die you don't disappear into an eternity of nothingness
Instead, you go to a really great place
() Number three: In that place every person will get a mansion
#4 What kind of mansion
83
don't know
Whatever kind of mansion you're thinking of right now
#3 Oh no
wasn't thinking of a mansion
lot of people echo this sentiment
#5 Shit
was thinking of a horrible mansion
Look, it's the best mansion you can think of, not just now, but ever
Whatever the best mansion for you can possibly be, that's the one you'll get
() Number four: When you die, all the people you love will be there too
#6 Will they have their own mansions
Yes, of course
Everyone gets a mansion
#6 What if  want them to live in my mansion
If they want to live with you, they can leave their mansion and live in yours
#6 What happens to their mansion
don't know, it goes back on the market
#4 What about the people  hate
Will they be there too
No
84
#4 Where are they
Okay, they're probably there, but you'll never see them
They're far off, too far for you to get there
#4 But what if they try to find me
They won't
They hate you too
#4 But what if they don't
What if they love me but  hate them
Well then you're just
you'll both be fine with it
There's only love there, okay
() Number five: When you die there will be free ice cream
All day
All night
Whatever flavor you can think of
#5 What, even bad flavors
But why would you eat bad flavors
#5 Well, you just said every flavor can think of
#8 Oh no,  just thought about vanilla and skunks
Well don't eat it then
#6 've just thought the chocolate sauce is diarrhea
Well don't put it on then
What's wrong with you people
mean
() () 85
(cont'd) Number six: If you do bad things you won't get to go to this great place when you die
#9 Where will you go
terrible place
The worst place imaginable
rumble of terror moves through the crowd
#7 What constitutes a bad thing
Murder
Crime
Rape
Things like that
#7 You have to tell us all the things or else we might do them and it wouldn't be our fault
The whole crowd echoes this sentiment
Fine
#9 Is punching someone bad
Yes
#9 What if they're trying to hurt you
Then it's fine
#7 Is cursing bad
No
#1 What about being late for work
86
That's fine too
mean, you might lose your job if your boss doesn't like it, but it won't effect what happens after you die
#2 What about if you forget to feed your dog
That also is fine
Unless the dog dies
Then it's bad
#1 If you do just one bad thing do you go to the bad place
No
You get
(thinking about it) three chances
If you do three bad things you're out
#1 Like baseball
Kind of, yes
There's a hubbub throughout the crowd: "It's like baseball", " love baseball" "'m scared of the bad place"
Any more
About fifty people stand up and ask their questions at the same time
Look, can we just move on
#2 No
We have to know everything that's bad
Fine
Let's start with you
() #3 Is it bad to wear pants
87
Mark sighs
: : "  " No
There's no hairstyle that will put you in the bad place
Like 've told you, the main things are hurting people physically on purpose, taking people's stuff, doing things to people they don't want done, killing people on purpose
Okay
Are we good
The crowd nods apprehensively
Many of the people in the crowd are crying
One of the crying men, shaking like a leaf, stands up, with terror in his eyes
() 've done many of those bad things
Is there anything  can do to not go to the bad place
Help me, 'm so scared
Well, you didn't know about these bad things until  told you just now so you're fine
#8 () Am  fine
#5 () What about me
Tons of people shout similar sentiments
You're all fine
'm only talking about people who do bad things starting right now
Everyone else is fine
The crowd erupts in a massive cheer
People hug each other passionately, wiping tears from their eyes
88
() Number seven: The man in the sky who controls everything decides if you go to the good place or the bad place
He also decides who lives and who dies
#4 Does he cause natural disasters
Yes
#3 Did he cause my mom to get cancer
Yes
#4 Did he cause that tree to land on my car last week
Yes
The crowd is quiet for a long beat
they're mulling this over
The first man to speak is a blue collar guy with a thick Brooklyn accent
say fuck the guy that lives in the sky
The whole crowd erupts in agreement
People stand up shouting, flicking off the sky
#5 Yeah
That guy's a fucking asshole
#5 That motherfucker better hope never see him face to face
#6 That guy's a fucking coward
Hiding up there and doing bad shit to us
Why doesn't he do it to our faces
#6 We need to stop that motherfucker before he kills us all
89
Mark looks worried
He didn't anticipate this
Suddenly a thought occurs to him
() Everyone quiets down
This guy who lives in the sky and controls everything is also responsible for all the good stuff that happens
The whole crowd "aaaahhs"
#7 He's the guy who saved my life on that fishing trip when the boat capsized
Yup
#7 Did he capsize the boat
Well, yes
#7 He's the one who killed my grandmother and left me those millions of dollars
You betcha
#3 So is he the same one who cured my mom's cancer
That too
The crowd thinks this over
#8 So he's kind of a good guy, but he's also kind of a prick too
90
Right
But check this out: () Number eight: Even if the man in the sky does bad shit to you, he makes it up to you by giving you an eternity of good stuff after you die
The crowd "aaahhs" again
#1 As long as you don't do any of the bad stuff you listed, right
Right
Of course
#2 So it's kind of a test
Yes
Right
() Well, that's it
That's everything know
Mark looks out at the crowd, they're all exhausted, their minds completely blown
The Nurse who started this all steps forward
#1 How do you know these things
() The man in the clouds told me
#1 Yeah, but how come we're just learning these things now, millions of years into our existence
don't know, he forgot or something
gotta go people, good night
Mark takes Jennifer by the hand and pulls her back inside his building
91
'   -  - Mark, Jennifer and Greg wait for the elevator, all of them exhausted
You think that went well
The doors open and they get inside
All three of them stare ahead, Mark looking exhausted, Jennifer and Greg with their minds completely blown
as the doors close and we : Spinning magazines and newspaper headlines proclaim "Mansion for Everyone (almost)", " searching for Man in the Sky", "Finally --  Reason to Do Good", "Time: Man of the Year: Mark Bellison", "Mansion Prices Plummet Worldwide", "Cult of Bellison Await Further Answers", "Man in Sky Murders forty- two in Earthquake", "Man in Sky Continues to Give  to Babies", "Workplace Productivity down Fourteen Percent -- Everyone Daydreaming About Mansions"
Mark is at Lecture Films turning in the script for "The Black Plague" to Anthony
Rob gives Mark a dirty look as he passes him in the hall
Mark, smiling proudly, stands behind the camera while Nathan Goldfrappe reads his script
In the background are Jennifer and Greg, hanging out on set
Jennifer can be seen chatting with Rob by craft services
Mark removes the "For Sale" sign from the front yard of a brand new, beautiful home
Jennifer and Greg congratulate Mark enthusiastically
Mark and Jennifer are walking down the street together when Mark stops to point out a new building with a sign that reads, " Quiet Place To Think About the Man in the Sky"
The building boasts a large stained glass window portraying Mark holding the two halves of the pizza box
Mark, Jennifer and Greg laugh it up in a stretch limousine as it pulls up to the movie premier of "The Black Plague"
Mark, Jennifer and Greg walk the red carpet at the premier of "The Black Plague"
Mark is the center of attention
Rob stops by on the red carpet to say hello to Jennifer and whisper something into her ear
Jennifer laughs
92
Mark and Jennifer have dinner together, the best of friends, but as they cheers their champagne glasses there is a tinge of sadness in Mark's eyes
: : "  " '  -  - disheveled Mark, unshaven and sloppy looking, sits in a reclining chair, wearing boxers and a bathrobe, drinking a beer
Beer cans are littered everywhere
young gay man in a suit stands before him with a pad and a pen writing down everything Mark says
So then the flying duck flew all the way to Alaska where it met up with a polar bear who could talk
And the polar bear's name was Martin
And the polar bear was wearing a green cape
And Martin and the flying duck both had race cars with their names printed on the side and
Jennifer enters the room, upset
just saw three people climbing the fence into your backyard
You really need to think about getting better security
(noticing beer cans ) Mark, how many of those have you had
Jennifer grabs the beer out of Mark's hand
(continuing; glaring at ) But then the evil goblin witch came in and stole the flying duck's race car and made the flying duck very angry
(grabbing at his beer) () 93
(cont'd) Luckily the Polar Bear was there to snatch the race car back
(But he misses) Unfortunately, the witch was a smart witch and the polar bear was powerless
Is that the end
Yeah
That's a strange ending
Hey, don't look at me: it's the Man in the Sky's story
You want me to take this over to Lecture Films
Yeah
Tell them to shoot that one this week
The assistant walks away
() Tell them it's for kids
Jennifer glares at Mark, disappointed
What
You haven't left the house in weeks
Every time  come by you're just sitting here writing down stories you get from the Man in the Sky
Hey, he's the boss
Don't you think you should go outside sometime
You know there's about five thousand people on our lawn waiting to ask you questions
94
Yeah, yeah
Jennifer sits down next to him
What's with you
You seem sad
Mark shrugs
don't get it
You're a very successful writer, you've won countless awards and Oscars
Jennifer waves towards a shelf full of Oscars and various other awards
You've changed the way people see the world, the way they see death and life
You've made the entire world happy
Not the entire world
know
Not you
The one person who should be happy, the person who has everything
() Not everything
What else do you want
Mark sits up in his chair and looks right at Jennifer
'd trade it all in for you
All of it
Jennifer sighs and sits down beside him
Well, you've got me
As a friend
(not sarcastic) Yeah
That's important
() 95
(cont'd) But why can't we be together
Why can't you be with me
Because of the whole snub nosed thing
With kids, your genetics
You know, fat, short
(stopping her) Yeah
Okay
Yup
() It's almost a shame that being rich and powerful and famous doesn't change your genetics
What
It would be great if it changed your genetic material because really love you but  just don't
Suddenly Mark has an idea
He looks right at Jennifer
It does change your genetics
Jennifer lights up
Does it
Mark stares at her for a short beat
He can't go through with it
No
No, it doesn't
Our kids would be short and fat with little snub noses
Right
Too bad
() Anyway, 've come to tell you can't go to the movies with you tonight
Why not
've got a date
96
What
With who
Rob Marlowe
Mark stands up
You've got to be fucking
Rob Marlowe
He's a complete and total asshole
Not to me
He's very sweet and kind to me
Well of course he is, look at you
mean, for fuck's sake, a shark would be nice to you
It would
Well no,  mean
() Don't go out with him
Why not
He's a great match for me
What's he got that  don't
We talked about this
If you and got together it wouldn't be fair to our kids
They have the right to be attractive and have good genes
() If Rob and  get married You can move into our mansion with us when we all die
don't want to move into your fucking mansion
And what are you doing thinking about marriage with him already
You haven't even gone on one date
Mark sits down
97
It's like nothing's changed
lot of things have changed wish you could be happy
There's a knock at the front door
That's him
Gotta go
He's picking you up here
It was his idea
Mark stands up, in shock and follows Jennifer to the front door
She opens the door to find Rob looking handsome and arrogant
What's up
Wow,  can't wait to have sex with you
Rob notices Mark in his boxers and a bathrobe
Oh hey there, Mark
You look like trash
(to Jennifer) Come on Jennifer, let's go have some fun
And then have some sex
Jennifer turns back to Mark, sad that he's upset
'll call you tomorrow
The door closes and Mark is left standing there alone
Greg, dressed in a bathrobe and looking even more slovenly than Mark, waddles up behind him
Who was that
'  -  - Mark and Greg are shit-faced, sitting around Mark's giant swimming pool
98
Hey, watch this
(yelling over the fence) About forty voices shout back: "He's talking to us
" "Maybe he has more answers
" "Finally
" The man in the sky just told me something
Mark snickers to himself
Greg, drunk and stupid, can't help but snicker too
You're all gay
Mark and Greg explode laughing
From the other side of the fence we can hear people mumbling shock
" am gay
" " always knew it
" "This is going to be awkward for my husband
" And adopted
Mark and Greg almost roll into the pool they're laughing so hard
The people on the other side of the fence aren't laughing: "Who's my real mother
", "This explains so much", "Dad, why didn't you tell me
" don't know why we're laughing
It's really probably very sad for those people
'm gettin' a beer
Mark hobbles up and walks into the house
Moments later he emerges with two cokes
Out of beer
Just Coke
Mark tosses Greg a Coke and sits down on his chaise lounge, cracking open his Coke and taking a sip
want to do something big again
Like telling the people what happens when they die
That felt good
gotta do something big like that again
99
Maybe the Man in the Sky will tell you something new
Maybe
Mark looks down at his can of Coke
: The warning label is extremely long and written in very small type
It starts with, " The following are diseases, physical ailments and general health issues that coke might cause:" The label then goes on to list dozens of ailments
Mark's eyes scan down to the very bottom of the label where it says simply, "If you still want to drink Coke, do so at your own risk
" Mark looks over to find Greg staring at the depressing label as well
Ugh, this shit is so bad for you really shouldn't drink this
Mark stares at this label for a moment, thinking
With his hand he covers everything on the label except for "Please Enjoy Coke
" He smiles widely
Hey, Greg
What if  told you that drinking Coke was good for you
Greg turns to him, his face full of hope
And not just Coke
But all the delicious foods you're not supposed to eat
What if they were all of a sudden really, really good for you
It would be the happiest day of my life
: 100
- dozen high powered executives from all over the globe sit around a massive board room table
The head seat at the table is unoccupied
They mumble back and forth to each other, unsure why they're there
Mark bursts into the room in a suit, looking very manicured
Gentleman, thank you all for coming here on such short notice
have some very big news for you all today
#1 Is it from the Man in the Sky
Nope, this one  came up with all on my own
And it's going to change the way you all do business
forever
Mark hits a button and a projection screen comes down on the far wall
Mark starts a slide show
Up until now, all products sold worldwide have warning labels printed on them
Warnings like these
: We see the same warning we just saw on the Coke can, a commercial jet with "This Plane Might Crash -- Four Of Our Other Ones Did" printed on its side, a car dashboard light reading "This Car will Ignite Upon Impact - Always", and a sticker on a grocery store package of ground meat that reads "Injected with hormones that make it taste better -- but will eventually give you cancer"
As you can see, a lot of these products can be very depressing
They remind people of all the horrible things that can happen to them in life
People hate thinking about horrible things
#2 Yeah, but they have to know those things
() 101
#2 (cont'd) They have to be able to protect themselves
don't want to hurt anyone
Especially now that  know about the "bad place"
Everyone in the room shudders
Hear me out, fellas
Allow me to introduce you to the future of your companies
Mark changes the slide to a can of coke that simple reads, "Coke -- Tastes Great
And It's Good For You
" Everyone in the room "ahhhs"
#3 Where can  get some of that healthy coke
It's the same Coke as before
The executives all squint their eyes
#4 But this one is healthy
And it tastes great
#1 Do you have any samples
Guys, it's the same Coke on the inside
've just changed the outside
#1 () Somehow by changing the outside, he's also changed the inside
Everyone "aaahs" in understanding
Mark sighs and changes the slide to that of a commercial airliner with the words "Completely Safe" writing on the outside
#2 Oh, thank goodness
've always hated flying
#3 Me too
102
#4 What an invention
How did you do it
didn't do anything, guys
made this on my computer last night
The plane is exactly the same as it was before
Nobody in the room gets it
#1 That's the only plane 'll ever fly on again
That's the point here guys
With these new advertising strategies, people will buy your products with abandon
#2 But it will take years to replace all of our stock with these new improved products you've invented
No
It won't
All you have to do is print these words on the packaging
That's it
Mark changes the slide again: The car dashboard light now reads, "This Car Prevents Crashes", and another slide that shows a package of meat with a sticker reading, "This Meat Actually Cures Cancer"
Even if you don't understand it, just start shipping these products out to people as you see them here and you're all going to get very, very rich
#3 How did you do it
Look, they're still the same products you have on the shelves right now
The only difference now is that people won't get bummed out or scared when they use them
Isn't that a good thing
103
The executives all nod their heads in agreement and rise to shake Mark's hand
Gentleman, if you'll excuse me, have five thousand gay orphans on my front lawn that are going bananas
Mark exits
: - We follow a suburban housewife as she pushes her shopping cart through the aisles of a bright and shiny super market
She picks up a six pack of Coke and notices the label: "New Coke -- It Tastes Great
And it's Good For You
" The housewife smiles widely and enthusiastically tosses it in her cart
: The housewife grabbing different products, marveling at the new, improved features: "Cures Sadness
", "Tastes Better than Real Chicken
", "This Candy is All Your Body Needs To Survive
" With a full cart the housewife wheels it to the checkout counter to find swarms of people already there, all of their carts bursting to the brim with new, exciting products
Everyone looks excited and happy
- Back at his old stomping ground, Mark sits at the bar by himself drinking coffee and watching the
Greg sits next to him, with two boxes of cookies and a liter of coke in front of him
Different newspapers are spread out on the bar, all of them with similar headlines, "World Rocked By New Healthy Products", "People Everywhere Line up for Guilt-Free Treats", "    --
"
:    is being interviewed in front of a super market, he holds a bag full of junk food in front of him
104
Thank the Man in the Sky for this
've never been happier in my life
Now  can eat whatever  want, whenever  want
The man takes a bite of a Twinkie and wavers a bit like he's going to pass out
Are you all right, sir
The man steadies himself
Yeah
must just be real happy
It says on the wrapper that they help boost your happiness
The man smiles, but he's obviously not feeling well
He's watching the  with a bit of worry on his face
He turns to Greg who is eating a stack of cookies and washing it down by gulping from a liter of coke
You should slow down there, Greg
Why's that
Just because the package says it's not bad for you doesn't mean you have to gorge yourself on it
But it tastes so good
Greg shoves three more cookies into his mouth
That's just stupid
No it's not
Greg holds up the package of cookies and points to the disclaimer which reads, "These cookies make you smarter"
See
105
Mark sighs
You look sad
Here, have a brownie
They'll cheer you up
Greg hands Mark a brownie that, sure enough, says "They'll cheer you up
" right on the package
wish that worked for me, Greg
What
Nevermind
'll see you around
Mark gets up and leaves
'  -- Mark drives while we take in a bit of his world, highlighting the various changes he's wrought
homeless man stands on the street corner with a sign that now reads, "Screw it
'll be in my mansion soon
" He has a big smile on his face
The same business man pulls up beside Mark's car, this time eating a giant donut and talking loudly into his cell phone
'm not talking to anyone on my cell phone
But from a distance look very important and busy
At a red light Mark eavesdrops on the same arguing couple
No,  won't move into your mansion with you when we die
You're really smothering me
The more you push me away, the more attracted  am to you
bus passes in front of Mark's car
The ad now reads, "Pepsi
Just As Good as Coke
" car honks behind Mark
The man leans out of his car and yells at Mark
106
Move it, fatty
As the man passes him, he looks at Mark and pulls up beside him
Hey you're Mark Bellison
Yeah
So are you going to apologize
For what
The honking man speeds away
- Mark sits in front of the gravesite of his grandmother
: Her tombstone which reads, "Martha Bellison 1918- 2007
Lived an average life for a woman in her time
" Nothing's really changed
gave people the Man in the Sky, made myself rich and successful, told the world they can eat whatever they want and feel good about it
Everyone's happy but me
Because 'm the only one who knows it all
isn't
made it all up
() You're not up there living in a mansion
You're right here
In the ground
That's all
And 'm the only one who knows that
() And the one thing  want  can't have
Because the world is too stupid to change
The world only cares about what they can see, and what they can know, and what they're used to and what
makes sense
No one listens to what they really want
And that's why 'll always just be a loser, grandma
And that's why 'll always be alone
: 107
'  -  - With a beer bottle in his hand Mark searches through his kitchen drawers for a bottle opener
He opens a drawer and something catches his eye
: The envelope which reads, " "
Slowly Mark pulls it out of the drawer and stares at it
The sound of his front door opening startles him and Mark shoves the envelope into his back pocket
Who's there
(
) It's me
Can  come in
Sure
Jennifer enters the kitchen
Haven't seen you much lately
know
've been busy with work and things
And 'm getting married
That's why  came over
To tell you
Mark nods
Don't do it
The wedding is tomorrow
Jennifer pulls out an invitation, Mark waves it away
hope you'll come
Mark shrugs and Jennifer puts the invitation back in her purse
No point really
108
It would make me happy
Being around you makes me happy
Mark turns towards her
So don't marry him
only have a few years to marry someone with good genes and financial stability so  can have children and the family 've always wanted
One day 'll be old and wrinkly and ugly
No you won't
Not to me you won't
love you
If you really love someone it doesn't matter what they look like
What do you mean
Do me this favor
Just one favor
Don't accept everything you see
Don't just do something because that's the way it's done
You're confusing me
Think about what you want
Find out what you really want
And if it's not the same as what  want, well then 'll know that and 'll never darken your doorstep again
() want you
What do you want
Jennifer and Mark stare at each other for a long beat
'm going to go
Please don't
Will you just stay a little bit longer
don't want to be alone
Just sit with me
109
Jennifer nods
Mark leads her into the living room and they sit down far apart from each other on the couch
Mark turns the  on and they both sit in silence
Mark has fallen asleep on the couch
Jennifer checks her watch and stands up
She takes out her wedding invitation and lays it on the coffee table by Mark
She unfolds a blanket and is about to place it on him when she notices an envelope sticking out of his back pocket
She pulls it out and looks at it
() My invention
She opens the letter and begins to read
Once finished, she folds up the letter and hurriedly leaves, scared and confused
: Mark wakes up and sees Jennifer's wedding invitation on the coffee table
He sighs
'  -  - Mark stands before the mirror, dressed in a suit, putting on a tie
Greg pokes his head into the room, dressed in a suit as well
We're gonna be late
"" - The sign outside reads, " "
Makes sense people would start getting married at these places mean, who you marry decides who's mansion you're going to live in one day
It's a big decision
110
Yeah
They enter the building
"" - small stage sits before a large stained glass window portraying Mark holding the two halves of the pizza box
Rob stands at the altar
Mark and Greg take their seats amidst a crowd of people sitting quietly in their chairs
"" -   - Jennifer sits in a small room in a beautiful white dress, looking as beautiful as any woman has ever looked
She stares absentmindedly out the window
There's a knock at the door
'  pokes her head in
' It's time, dear
Jennifer doesn't answer
We   on Jennifer to see she's clutching Mark's letter in her hand
' Jennifer
don't feel all right
' What's wrong
Do you have food poisoning
No
don't think there's a word for what  have
"" - "Here's comes the Bride" plays over an organ and Jennifer walks down the aisle towards a smiling Rob
Mark watches her in awe, stunned by her beauty
Rob notices Mark staring at Jennifer and mouths "loser" at him
111
Jennifer reaches the altar and stands across from Rob
The , an elderly man in a suit, stands between them holding a few sheets of paper in his hand
We are sitting here in this building today to share in the wedding of Rob and Jennifer
Two young, attractive people who have agreed that this union would be mutually beneficial and that their genetic match-up would most likely produce favorable offspring and a life of financial stability and physical security
Both Rob and Jennifer nod at each other
Rob, do you promise to stay with Jennifer for as long as you want to and to protect your offspring for as long as you can
do
Jennifer, do you promise to stay with Rob for as long as you want to and to protect your offspring for as long as you can
Jennifer doesn't respond
Jennifer
(to Overseer) 'm sorry, hold on one second
(to Rob) Rob, can  ask you something
There's a slight hubbub in the room
Mark perks up
() Sure
But what are you doing
What color are my eyes
112
dunno
() Oh, they're brown
Jennifer's eyes
Indeed, they are brown
No Rob, they're blue
Rob looks again
Mark stirs in his seat, amazed by what he's hearing
Oh, look at that
So they are
You've got pretty blue eyes
on Jennifer
It works
Her mind is reeling
Can we get on with this
Jennifer, do you promise to stay with Rob for as long as you want to and to protect your offspring for as long as you can
Jennifer is confused
Her mind is fighting it, but she doesn't know what exactly she's fighting
Finally
do
There is a sigh of relief from the room
Mark shakes his head in sadness
Before  pronounce these two man and wife, is there anyone here who thinks they'd offer either of these people a better genetic match-up
Mark bolts up in his chair
Me
The whole room gasps
Oh come on
Look at you
You can't be better
113
Yes  can
You've got shmuck genes
Schmuck genes
What's that
And  love her
(to Jennifer) Jennifer, don't marry him
Is this what you really want
don't know
(pause; unsure) Yes
Mark thinks this over for a beat
All right
'm done
Goodbye
Awkwardly Mark makes his way to the aisle and leaves the room
The room is thick with tension
Are we married yet
Because 've got plans this afternoon
"" - Mark loosens his tie as he walks out of the building and towards the street
In the background we can see the "church" door open
() Hold on a minute
Mark turns, confused and tired
Jennifer runs to him
She stands before him, they both stare at each other
What
Jennifer pulls out Mark's letter and shows it to him
'm confused
114
So am
Is any of it
the things you said
are they
can't think of the word
() Is there a Man in the Sky
No
Why'd you say there was
Because  couldn't cope with the look on my grandmother's face
But how could you say something that
wasn't
'm not sure
just did it
And what did you mean that  could grow old and ugly and still be beautiful to you
mean just that
You'll always be beautiful to me
But what if my looks
It doesn't matter
feel funny
Me too
() Everything is so hard
Nothing is easy anymore
There is a long moment of silence
Jennifer moves closer to Mark and looks directly into his eyes
115
know what  want
What
want short, fat kids with little snub noses
The biggest smile we've ever seen comes across Mark's face
() Easy
That's an easy one
Just   like she did the night on her couch, Jennifer reaches over   and puts her hand on Mark's wrist
They both stare at each   other for a long beat, holding hands, love beaming from both   of them
The world is changing before their eyes
Does anyone else know about your invention
No
But 'm sure it won't be long
Should we tell them right away
'm not sure
don't think everyone will understand
Greg sticks his head out of the church door
What's going on out here
Everyone's just sitting in there
Are we gonna finish this wedding
Jennifer smiles at Mark
Yes
Mark smiles back
Praise the Man in the Sky
116
as Mark and Jennifer walk hand in hand towards the church -- and an unknowable future
The world's last moment of honesty
monumental occasion in the history of mankind
() That lowly writer who stumbled upon the ability to lie went on to become one of the most important men of his age, married to one of the most beautiful women of his time, and passed on the lying gene to generations to come
() world without honesty is a world with dreams
world with pretense
world with fiction
world with flattery
And most importantly, a world with true love
Put simply, a world very much like our own
