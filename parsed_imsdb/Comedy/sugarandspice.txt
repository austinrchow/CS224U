Squad
(') Yeah
This summer at church camp
'm pretty sure  had, y'know, an orgasm
Hold up, hold up
Any sentence that starts with "at church camp" ain't leading to the big "

Those pictures of Christ - all sweaty and bare-chested on the cross - always kinda made me hot

Anyway, last time  checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm
And know she ain't seen the lord on all fours - so 'm just saying

The parents react with shock, then absolute joy
DeeDee starts to cry - turning the  on
Oh, oh, mother of the bride - 'm allowed
But not before

All  - the calm before the shit storm
Suddenly, Jack's Mom throws her head back and lets out a : ' to  we're: '  - so when your dad said, " never want to see your "f-'in' faces again
" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up
don't know
And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table
Well, if  had to guess
(convincing self) 'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own
(getting an idea, cradling his face) Jack, do you know what  see here
Spit from your dad
(wiping his hair) see a flower
And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt
Yeah
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this

Stunned silence

Holy shit
You just became a statistic
(suddenly happy) Oh my -d
'm not first
But you're not married
Wait
Did you say you are pregnant or you were pregnant
You had it, threw it out and you're gonna go back and dance all night
Shut up, Cleo
Di, how much do you need for an abortion
(suddenly freaked) What
No
Not an abortion
My church can arrange for you to go to Oregon and take care of a "sick aunt" for nine months
Then they put your baby good home and you come back - a little dazed and puffy - but everything's fine
Oh please, Di, don't be a whore and a murderer
All  - no one can believe she just said that

just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head
know, Hannah
Look, 'm not going to get an abortion
mean,  always planned to get married and have kids - 'm just going a little out of order
Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep
'Course, that was a long-long time ago
But no matter what, she held her head high and said
"Pappa don't preach, 'm in trouble deep
Pappa don't preach, 'cause 'm keepin' my baby
Hey
'm gonna keep my baby

All take hands and lower their heads

Then they could give you the money
(building from a slow burn) With all due respect, Jack and Diane Bartlett
They exchange a smile, first time saying this

We are two young, able-bodied Americans
We do not want a handout
We want a hand-up
Give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow
Give us corn - the kind you plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own food and
and, uh, then cut it, and - uh, y'know eat it
Now, if you're interested in giving us a home loan, will sit back down
If not, have a nice day, Ma'am
Sorry

Moist to the touch
It's at that moment  think control her - she's mine

More proof God's a guy

Okay
Jack, y'know how you and Diane

(looking to tards, pleased with himself) Well now that you can't, y'know, (fuck) "sleep together," but you still sleep together, don't you ever get, like, just, super horny
If so, how horny
'll be quiet now so  can listen to your answer
(flirting her ass off) Yeah, Jack - 'd love to hear your answer
She sets her videos on the counter, smiling seductively
Jack starts to run them under the scanner
The answer's easy
(quickly) Oh, "Lolita" is due tomorrow - Same for "9 1/2 Weeks

She immediately kneels beside him, placing his aching head in her lap - smothering him in her breasts

All but Diane ,
Oh my -d, you've been robbed

Di, are you okay
We can skip the girl party this week
(unconvincing) Everything's fine

Diane forces a smile
You want us to help you pick up

If you don't like it - you try being a pregnant teen
Diane  the Safeway bag from Hannah and storms
And we have our first pregnancy mood swing
All that's left is -- Diane

Diane eats
Did you guys hear that in China - or one a those places that makes the really cheap silk shoes and kids are super smart - that as a reward for good grades, mothers get their kids hookers to blow 'em
All stop and look at her
No
Huh
Musta been a dream
'm sorry to keep asking this, but are you guys sure 'm not fat
Squad looks to each other, nervous, then - "No
" (') "No" you're not sure or "No" 'm not fat
Uh, "no"
You're not fat
You sure 'm not fat
(can't take it any more) Look, you're fat, Diane
You're fat, fat, fat
Because you eat, eat, eat
(to shocked squad) What
She keeps asking because she wants some honesty
(breaking down) No  don't
keep asking because feel fat
Oh -d, 'm sorry
You're not really fat
was just saying that because, uh,  thought that's what you wanted me to say
You sure

: - Squad is watching " " on : Bank Robbery about to start
Diane eats Snickers
Oh my -d,  read about this
It's called a "pregnancy insanity
"  Quick, she needs a sitz bath -- (putting down her Snickers) Look,  might be moody
might be gassy
But  am perfectly sane
Think about it
In school, they tell us, "Dreams can come true
"  Right
Squad - agreement - not knowing where this is going
(') But they don't tell us how
Well, thanks to Keanu,  figured it out
Money makes your dreams come true
Squad - their concern for her mental health
(') (old spirit returning) Listen, Kansas,  know you dream of springing your mom some day
Stop, you're gonna make me cry
And if the
trial taught us anything, it taught us that in America, you can cut off someone's head and still be found innocent if you have enough money
Your mom only shot a guy
Kansas smiles at the thought
(') Now Cleo,  know you dream of an all leather apartment with Conan -  heard the school shrink telling a lunch lady
Cleo blushes and smiles guiltily at the thought
(') And Hannah, you could give your share to your church - or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids Sally Struthers advertises
Or,  could get my own horse
Or that
Look, you guys,  just want to provide a future for my baby
know my bank branch like the back of my puffy little hand
could open that safe in my sleep
'm in
Squad reacts with  - did she just say that
(') mean it
'm in
This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that 've ever had
If one of us needs something, we all do
Stop it
This is crazy
'm in, too
Cleo
Kansas is right
We're like sisters -- we're closer than sisters
And you don't turn your back on family
'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time
And they get caught
That's right
So all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes
And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu
Forget it
've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head
won't risk it
(sotto, to Kansas) Conan went to Harvard
(sotto) Shut up
Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship
No
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard
don't know
Probably not
So then this isn't crazy
It's a sure bet
Well
Squad - their encouragement
(') guess we're in this together
They jump around, thrilled
(') But, we have to make a smart plan
Of course - of course
Hands in
Squad puts their hands in
(') We all have to cross-our-hearts-hope-to die-stick-a-dirty-needle-in-my-eye that we'll never tell Jack
We all know he can't lie - that's why he's going to be such a great senator
: as the squad goes through their "Cheerleaders Kick Ass
" routine
: '  - It looks just like Diane's basement
Cleo sits on the couch, eating from a bag of microwave popcorn
The   for "Reservoir Dogs" plays in the tiny picture-in-picture
: '  - The room is neatly ordered
Lucy sits at her computer - case of "Heat" sits beside her monitor
She's taking copious notes
Her mom enters with milk and cookies
Lucy stands, concealing her monitor
Her mom sets down the cookies and kisses Lucy's good-night before she exits
Relieved, Lucy sits at her computer again
: '   - It's a sparse room, filled with religious icons
Hannah nervously places a video into the  above the , then sits on the couch
She smiles about to push  on the remote when her stern, -   and take a seat on either side of her
Her look turns to fear as her father takes the remote and hits

We pass the   (from "Candidate Speeches") and his two friends

Even cigarettes are fags over there

He slices off the guy's ear, and mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the -- Cleo, 've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie
(vamping) Well
uh
they, y'know, uh
They had nicknames
: -  - Squad sits at their lunch table in this large, open room
Only Diane eats - from all the trays
Lucy walks around the table, handing out stapled packets
Page one is a plot summary of "Heat
" Two has my character summaries
Three is my overall critique and on four through ten, you'll find my Nexus search of all prior analysis of this film
All stare at her
She stops - starts to pick up the packets
(') Uh, in summation, no part of "Heat" is really applicable to a grocery store bank branch robbery
(
) What the heck is going on here
All turn to see Jack, followed by football players and the Video Barn Geeks
Uh, Jack - look,  can explain
Diane, there's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins
Now, if you guys were really friends, you'd remind her to take these
He smiles, gives Diane her vitamins and kisses her head before exiting to the "jock table
" Uh, Cleo
would you just say my name
: '  -   - The squad, in uniform, sits along the wall
Pregnant fill the rest of the room
so, while it's a laugh riot for the whole family, and Tim Conway is just about as funny as they come, especially when he goes
Wait a minute
You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang
'm only allowed "" movies
(losing it) Am  the only one who cares about this
At least  watched "Dog Day Afternoon
" Excuse me, could you please keep your voice down
We're not introducing anger into the womb
(snapping back) Well how'd you like me to introduce my foot into your ass
Kansas
(lowering her voice) 'm sorry, Diane, but 'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies -- Those of us who have parents, know that they have rules because they care
All fall silent - she went too far
Kansas stands
You sure you wanna go there
(nervously standing) Uh
maybe
'Cause  will Jerry Springer you faster than you can say "Fat-assed lesbian
" Kansas and Hannah go at it - the   is on
Diane, Cleo and Lucy try to pull them apart, - "Stop
" and "Knock it off

Diane Weston
Diane pushes her way through the fight, forcing a smile
- disheveled squad enters to find Diane on the exam table, crying
Her sweater is pulled up, pregnant belly exposed
An   and  is on beside her
Di, we're sorry
We
It's off
can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility
We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls
The squad rushes to a sobbing Diane, embarrassed by their behavior and what it's done to Diane
(') (through tears) It's all my fault
'm sorry  ever started this
Di, it's not your fault
We all wanted to do this - for you
for ourselves
Squad - agreement
Cleo picks up the - beside Diane and starts fiddling with it
Look, maybe  can watch a  movie
'll just say 'm counting dirty words for Sunday School
That's okay, Hannah
It was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies
Sex - you can learn from movies
But robberies
There's no way
Cleo sets the - on Diane's belly
The squad stares in wide-eyed wonder at the monitor - for the first time they see Diane's baby
Diane doesn't notice
(') Besides, - had a "Little House On The Prairie" marathon and the Ingalls made baby Carrie's bed in a dresser drawer
guess  can just do that
Diane sees the squad staring and turns to the monitor
(') Oh my -d
She     and   her belly with both hands
It's all very real
Suddenly, the and we see a  '
Ahh
Baby's got two heads
It's twins
Oh, thank -d
'm not just super fat
(building) Oh - okay, we ain't done with this
Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load
We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals
'm gonna visit my mom
Squad can't believe what she just said
: '  -   - Mrs
Hill, a tough looking woman who smokes like a chimney
You don't look nothing like your pictures
What happened to the curly red hair
Kansas
Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl
They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me
Thank -d
was starting to think 'd killed the wrong man
There's an awkward silence as the reality of this hits Kansas
Her mom lights up a cigarette
You shouldn't smoke so many of those
know, but it keeps down the size of my can
They could kill you
So could half the women in here
And 'd rather go out with a nice can
So watcha here for
To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me
don't hate you
need your help
My what
Your help
Now how the hell can  help you
(sitting close) Okay, you can't tell anybody
Gee, 'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk
Whaddya want
My best friend got pregnant
Before you
Whoo-hoo
They high-five through the glass
know - that's what  said too
Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever
know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it
(near tears) So you need my help
Oh my -d, this is like asking me for help with your homework
(calling behind her) Hey, Mink, c'mere
, a tough-looking woman with short spiky hair joins her
(') Kansas,  want you to meet someone special
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom
Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here
Now  have to add, "
My mom's a dyke" too
What
Hush up, you mouthy little shit
Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - 'm outta here
Wait, Petunia
Mommy's a little amped up - didn't get her yard time this morning
Mink ain't my bitch
She's a specialist
in banks
'  -   - The rest of the squad, in uniform, waits in folding chairs
stares at them, while slowly mopping the floor
All but Diane appear nervous
The inmate works her mop  '  and stops
#1 Thems some sweet skirts y'got there
Well, thank you
They're actually uniforms - we're cheerleaders
#1 Mmm-hmm
y'sure are
As she moves in closer, Kansas is let through a metal door
All jump up
Diane steps politely over the mop handle that's pressed between her legs
Excuse us
The squad joins Kansas as they all hustle out the hallway
Same time tomorrow - we have a visit with our favorite "aunts
" : '  -   - the visitors' row
sit across from even to the , sweet and small in comparison - each sitting across from a Mrs
Hill walks behind the inmates, supervising
Robbin' a bank is like pullin' a trick
You gotta stay in control, know how far you'll go for the dough and always put the rubber on yourself
Well, y'know what  mean
And you gotta do it the day after Christmas
Why
Banks never have a holiday pick up, so vaults are full
Besides, everyone's at home eatin' left-overs and beatin' their kids
#1 You're only seventeen
Shit,  was havin' my third by th'time 's your age

You were cell mates with her

And you're called "Itchy" because

Hannah frantically writes down
: -  - Jack is on his side of the bed, rubbing cream on Diane's exposed belly as he sings to it
Diane is writing on her "From the Beautiful Mind
"  , which rests above her big belly
(talking to Diane's belly) so although their dad said, "Don't get out of the car until  get back with help," they knew the sheriff's voice as he yelled
"Run to my voice - and don't look back
"  The twins did as he said, but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient, bouncing their father's head on the top of the car
(feels something) Ah
They jumped, Diane
They jumped
That was gas, Sweetie
Oh
What are you working on
Jus some girlie things for the squad
: - "  " Notepad
"From The Beautiful Mind of Diane"   to first item listed: 1) Buy ski masks and maternity underpants
As it's crossed off, we: : -   - Diane watches as the squad over their Addidas sweats, with pillows and stuffed animals in the belly portion
It's like some bizarre fashion show

Diane points to Cleo's style, then hands the surprised saleswoman : - as 2) Buy gats from "The Terminator" is crossed off

Diane walks to the counter and rings the bell
Kansas, you should never judge a book by its cover
(greasy hair, dirty coveralls, big rubber gloves)
He's a chain-smoker and reeks of insecticide
The squad reacts
Yeah
(sotto) guess there's an exception to every rule
You're the "Terminator
" You come in here to bust my balls kill bugs for a livin'
-d already beat ya to it
He turns to exit
Wait

(nervous, but smiling) We're the -squad from Lincoln High
So, uh

Yeah
"Itchy" sent us
She did, did she
How is the old girl
Definitely old
(warming) That's Itchy, alright
How many y'need
Well, we'll each probably want one - so let's make it five
Five should do it
Okay
How much ammo you reckon you'll need
Ammo
Bullets
Bullets
No bullets
Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people
Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full
You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it
Right
(beat) That'll be fifteen hundred - cash
Squad
What
You piece-a-shit bug zapper
Hey, hey, hey
'mon you guys
(to Hank) Obviously that's a little more than our budget will allow
Basically, we're looking for something around two-hundred dollars
Oh, why didn't you say
For two-hundred got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back
'll gift wrap it for you
The deal is fifteen hundred
Cash
Take it or leave it
What kind of deal would you make if said we were going to the police and tell them you're selling illegal guns
to minors
To girl minors
(big toothless grin) 'd just hafta kiiiiiill you
Well, okay then
It was a pleasure meeting you
Take care, let's go you guys
Squad quickly exits
Hold on
They stop, still facing the door
Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone
Promise
Maybe we can make a deal
Look, we're not gonna trade sex for guns
Unless Cleo
Cleo hits her
My daughter's always dreamed of bein' a cheerleader

) Holy shit
That's a poster child for "Planned Parenthood

) The vagina, forming the lower portion of the birth canal, will normally expand its folded walls to allow for the birth process
Suddenly Diane and the squad walk across the screen
Sorry, we had our first basketball game - went into overtime
Excuse us
Sorry

Pissed, the instructor continues in the Room starts
Diane joins in

We're gonna make it, baby
What a sad waste of a man

Diane gets down on her pillow - squad surrounds her Lucy takes out a piece of paper which she sets on Diane's belly for all to see

Kansas glares back
Hey
Eyes on your own belly
Hee-hee-h-wait a minute
Hold on, now
What do we do before a big game
Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross
My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are
personally think of how Conan started as a writer, then became a
(jumping in) -- We practice
Sorry, Cleo
That's right
Practice makes perfect
'm practicing to have a baby right now
If we do a practice job, we'll not only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns

The Older Woman starts to     from a roll
Impatient, Lisa grabs the roll, rips off some tickets, tosses the roll on the table and
The Older Woman (key around her neck), , then
Diane   and gives her money
The older woman counts off tickets, smiles and gives them to Diane who bends down to tie her shoe
The Older Woman  the metal box to put the money in as ,     and fakes
Cleo runs up to Kansas - begging for help
The Older Woman hurries around the table to help as Hannah , takes the open metal box and dumps the contents into Lucy's Winnie the Pooh  as she walks quickly Hannah hands the box to Diane who shuts it and puts it back on the table
in opposite directions as Kansas  , gets up and exits, followed by Cleo, who first helps the Older Woman to her feet and then exits

) You guys wanna hurry up
My grandparents get back from dinner at four-thirty

It looks like a   - a unique combination of her grandparents' old '60's furniture and high school memorabilia
can't believe your grandparents never come down here
You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs
Shit - forgot to pick up the cigarettes
Squad forms a circle around the trunk
Ready
She flips  the latches

All help
Stunned
What the hell
the trunk is filled with
Stocks, barrels, flint locks, rusty triggers, etc
Nothing seems to go together
Oh no

Okay
How many signs do we need
We're not supposed to do this
Maybe Lucy's right
Maybe this is a sign
Screw Lucy

) Kansas
at the top of the stairwell

) (') Is that you down there
Shit

) Are you girls talking about boys
Practicing kissing your hands
Oh yeah, you caught us

) Oh well, then 'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals
Thanks
That'd be great
Old legs
Girls relax
Legs , and head
Squad springs into action again
(
) You got that big retarded girl down there
