: - Mist
Dark trees
Dripping vines
An   in the distance
The full moon shimmers on a puddle
, splashing a one man pup tent
's eyes pop open, disoriented, realizing he's fallen asleep reading by flashlight
He's nineteen, still slightly awkward and unaware he's growing handsome
He listens as the   , closer
He peers out through the tent flap
Glaring head lamps toward him
Scrambling out of his sleeping bag, he himself against the side of the tent, as
an   nearly plows down the tent, skidding to a stop in the mud
Stillness
Luke extricates himself from the tent
He runs to the driver- side window of the
Are you all right
Inside, , thirties, earthy, looks up at him bleary-eyed
She nods 'yes
' (') How did you even get here
There's no road
'm sorry
'm from Utah
It's okay
Are you alone out here
2
He nods 'yes
'    She bursts into
(') My husband
Bastard
've been driving for days
don't even know where 'm going
Oh, wow
'm really sorry
She gathers herself, sniffling
have warm apple kringel in the camper
Would you like some
Uh, what is it
Pastry
Luke stands at the 's tiny kitchen counter, wolfing pastry off a paper plate
So, this "Survival Quest" is your vacation
Yeah
It's my third try
Kind a' lame, huh
No
Seven days alone in the wilderness
'd be afraid
It's just something  really wanted to do
Luke notices an odd pile of stuff by the sink
His shoes
Fishing lures
The electric drill
Good
3
She smiles, grateful, eyeing his torn t-shirt and shorts
You're all wet and muddy
Why don't  hang those up to dry
Thanks
'm okay
'm propositioning you
Oh
Oh, wow
You are
He considers, fearful, but thrilled
- Students crisscross on bikes in front of the quadrangle
The huge round headlights and muscular front grill of an old -  up to the curb
It's the cab only, like the sliced-off front of a train engine
Luke hops down, startling his friends,  and , passionately making out on the sidewalk
Twenty, brainy and athletic, Janine adjusts her glasses, the only remnant of a bookish past, as she thoughtfully considers Luke's massive truck
It's remarkable
Sort of retro thought you were gettin' a pickup
changed my mind
Hoping for a more enthusiastic response, he turns to Keenan, who climbs up and peeks inside the cab
He's rugged, streetwise, perpetually bemused, -maybe Ed Norton and Bill Murray had a son
It's awesome
It's pleather
Fuck you
You think it's stupid
4
Janine stares at him
(') What
She shrugs, trying to put her finger on it, and when Luke rolls up his -shirt sleeves, she grins
(') What
Oh my God
You got laid
Finally
Who is she
Luke glares at Keenan
didn't say a word
swear
You know Janine
She's got -ray vision
(to Janine) Camping
total stranger
knew that whole "waitin' to meet the right girl" thing was crap
Congratulations
have to get to Physics
The truck's great
See ya', hottie
Could find something to call me, other than what every guy in the world would say
"Sweetheart
" "Babe
" "Aphrodite
" Janine sneers
At a loss, Keenan grabs her and kisses her passionately
She walks off rolling her eyes, but secretly loves it
Keenan climbs up into the cab
(') So this is gonna' be like your car
5
Look,  know it's dopey
But don't you recognize it
It's painted and the muffler's switched out, -but this was my dad's
Keenan looks around with fresh eyes
He reaches an arm way up under the glove box and , pulling out a small stash of weed
Ten years
little dried out
- The truck barrels along through the trees
Luke and Keenan share a joint
First off, that woman
We didn't go all the way, you know
Yeah
Okay, so
You think technically 'm still a virgin
Were you inside her
Yeah
It counts
Next
What
been havin' this weird dream
The thing is,  think maybe the dream's real
Forget it
No way 'm tellin' you
You know enough of my secrets to get me shot
Sharon's mom on Thanksgiving
What the fuck dream is there you can't tell me
6
It's about part of me gettin' smaller
An important part
Keenan looks over warily, then busts out , then realizes Luke's serious
You have gotta' be fuckin' kiddin' me
You're not thirteen
Screw you
Maybe  caught something
think it's good you bought this truck
They both
- small, run-down service garage, crammed with tires, tools and discarded car parts
Luke's truck idles in the service bay, billowing smoke
, nineteen, lean, in overalls, with shoulder-length hair and edgy eyes, wipes his greasy hands on a rag
Dripping with masculinity, he swaggers around the truck, chewing gum, wielding a pneumatic torque-wrench, which he occasionally  for emphasis
can do the gasket for twenty bucks
But new -sprocks, for this thing
Two, three hundred, maybe
Shit
Can  hold off on that
No skin off my ass
But a few days, weeks, your whole transmission could blow
Ah, Jeez
shouldn't got this
7
Max considers, sets his baseball cap on the truck fender and Four hundred seventy-five horsepower
Twenty-eight inch wheels
It's a classic
Let me dig around out back
Maybe we got a used set
That'd be great
Thanks
Max disappears through a squeaky door at the back
Luke picks up a rag and wipes fingerprints off the fender
He sits, impatient for Max to return
He examines Max's cap, tries it on
He picks up the torque- wrench, swaggers about, trying to look macho, in the manner of Max
He spins around and  the wrench, catching sight of , twenty, watching him from out front in jeans and - shirt, with warm, confident eyes
Luke swallows, wide-eyed, a deer in headlights
He sets down the torque-wrench
(') It's not my wrench
It's my truck
What's wrong with it
Oh, just needs a new gasket and a couple -sprocks
The flanges are sheared off
No big deal
You have to watch my brother, Max
He's sellin' you "-sprocks
" Yeah
There's no such thing
Last week he sold Mrs
Gustafson a whole set: six hundred bucks
My name's Michelle
8
From New York
Poli-Sci transfer
sort of asked around campus
You did
You've prob'ly already got a stalker, huh
No
Luke stares, awkward
You heard about Cafe Lunizia
Italian
They got New York style pizza
Make you feel at home
You askin' me out
Oh, well, uh, -definitely
An  pulls up at the gas pump, stuffed with Keenan and , exuding supreme self-confidence, calls over to Luke as he pumps gas
Hey, Spanky, let's go
Look forward to kickin' your puck ass
My ride
Your name's "Spanky
" No, Puck Ass, but people just call me Luke
We're beatin' his frat boy team in street hockey
Pisses 'em off
'll talk to Max
Tell him to just replace the gasket
Luke's  grows
9
Thanks
So, what do you think
'll just sit there while you eat
won't even talk
Look,  just split up with this total amoeba
Oh, 'm a paramecium
That's way more evolved
'm practically pond scum
Maybe 'll give you a call when the truck's ready
Great
You mean to go out, right
Michelle smiles, and walks out through the squeaky door at the back
Keenan approaches
(a whisper) Whoa
That was her
Jesus, you're sweatin' like crazy
Luke sits, nods 'yes,' wipes  of  from his brow
We're goin' out
Keenan gives him a high-five
Luke smiles, catching his breath
& ' small, run-down house
Hockey gear, dirty laundry and Keenan are strewn across the garage-sale sofa
He munches a burrito while watching the game
(
) ,
Keenan leaps up
He races down the hall, sliding on the linoleum
10
Luke, a towel around his waist, stares at himself in the mirror, horrified
Look
My chest
Keenan looks, clueless, a little uncomfortable now
Yeah
had hair
Come on
Not a lot, but you've seen me -some- right
Okay,  don't know
So
Well, where'd it go
Keenan takes a bite of the burrito in his hand, now mashed
really thought you gettin' laid was gonna' help
What is it with you, man
mean, you're smarter than me, you're better lookin' than me
am not
know
But 'm just sayin', you can get any girl you want
Easy for you, you've got Janine
'm still workin' on my
How long you think Brainiac's gonna' wanna' hang with that
She worships you
11
Man, 'm gonna' be that wild fling she had with the local dude from the bike shop
"God, what was his name
" You're crazy
Keenan gives him a look of "'m crazy
" You're gonna' have a great time with her tonight
Just be yourself
Mostly
- Cheap elegance
Luke and Michelle dine on the patio, strung with far too many white lights
caught him with my best friend
Former
Such a cliche'
Sorry
Winthrop Hawkins
"Hawk
" From this Park Avenue family
He'd know what kind of mushrooms those are, what the best wine is
The best wine is beer
'm such a moron
You're not
No,  am
have incontrovertible proof
She kicks off her shoe and sticks her bare foot on the table, a  of a   on her ankle
12
(') It's a hawk
Get it
"Hawkins
" See, you're smirking
'm not
And it's
That's the one color tattoo they can't
Oh
Bummer
'm considering a prosthetic foot
She smiles
They sip from their glasses and drink each other in
Luke contemplates a kiss,
but his breathing grows shallow, he
(') What's the matter
Nothin'
Maybe just kind a' hot out here
You want moron
When my dad died, -it's okay,  was nine
barely knew what was goin' on- But  thought the tombstone was really sad looking, so  painted smiley faces and fish all over it
That's sweet
Yeah, 'm sure dad would've loved that
His face
Overheated, Luke tugs at his shirt, brushes  from his brow
So, what do you think makes a good relationship
13
For real
don't know
Friendship
Great sex
Knowing you want to be there even when it gets scary or bloody
Whoa
Where'd that come from
Sorry
No, it's just not the usual guy thing
You're great, you know
Luke puts his hand on his chest,  something
He stands, puts on his jacket
Will you excuse me a sec'
-, his arms   , on his forehead, Luke checks the Men's Room door:
He ducks out the service entrance
By the dumpster, Luke reaches behind his head,  off his jacket and shirt, and looks down
His eyes
-
On his chest:
Two  come outside for a smoke
Table twenty-nine
Like to bring her the cannoli special
14
Luke peers over the dumpster, down at his breasts, with a , and  , slumping to the ground
- Luke's eyes open, dilated, disoriented
He's lying on the ground, shirtless among bits of garbage
He watches bleary-eyed, as a  peers at him from inside an empty milk carton
The mouse runs over and sniffs at a canteloupe, which triggers Luke's memory: He  his chest, relieved to find it's back to normal
He stands, dizzy, surveying the dark, locked restaurant, and staggers across the deserted parking lot toward his truck
- Luke's Semi  along
Luke stares out in shock
He hears  , ,
(
) Oh yes
Don't stop
He looks around for the source of the sounds, glances over
in it's reflection a leering male, stripped to the waist
(
) Lie down for me, baby
The   of an oncoming car  at him
As he glances out the driver-side window,   from the passing car
glimpse of what might be an  of  intertwined
The   -    at Luke as the by
Luke  to one side, glancing at the truck's 15
The car recedes in the distance, but the Female Driver appears  in the mirror's reflection,
She from the inside, and disappears
Luke stares out,
' The decrepit old garage looks as if it may collapse any second
Barbells on the floor
Luke dodges and weaves, slugging a makeshift punching bag
Keenan appears, wiping sleep from his eyes
We takin' up boxing
don't know
am
What's goin' on
You competin' for Mr
Universe this week
Everyone should just mind their own fucking business
Keenan recoils at the attitude
Didn't go so great, huh
Luke punches the bag, harder and faster, a near : He collapses in a heap
(') Dude
It was goin' great
She's amazing
Funny
And really smart
And the way she eats ravioli, like 'aah
' Cool
16
Then  started feelin' all weird again, and,
oh, man, you'll think 'm nuts
Keen,  had breasts
felt 'em
Whoa, first date
Definitely the 'new Luke
' No
On me
You're startin' to creep me out
Listen,  think  know what's goin' on, okay
"Acute Adolescent Anxiety
" It's from the stress of college, girls, grades
It's really common
'm not an adolescent
Where'd you get this crap
The Net
found all the symptoms right off: panic attacks, "Localized Alopecia" -that's hair loss
This doctor wrote back, "Any chance your friend, Luke, just lost his virginity
" You told, -you gave him my name
He's a doctor, back East
He's sending this information pack
Look,  started thinkin' you're goin' bipolar on me or somethin'
Come on, man,
Luke considers
- Luke hops down from the truck cab, fixes his shirt and hair, trying to look nonchalant as he rings the doorbell
Hearing something behind him, he turns as Max  him in the stomach, knocking the wind out of him
17
You son-of-a-bitch, stay the hell away from my sister
Luke  for air
(') You don't say a word
You just leave her sittin' there
came to apologize
Max shoves him across the yard
Get out a' here
She's not home, anyway
Will you tell her  came by
No
She's honest with you, so you bolt
And then what, you wake up feelin' sorry for her
No
Is that what she thinks left 'cause a' what she said
That's crazy
She's like the most incredible girl  ever met
Max sneers, skeptical
(') had this 'pasta quattro funghi' - four mushroom
It took me a while to even figure it out, but  think someone put shrooms in it, or somehow they got in there by mistake
was hallucinating and everything
Amazes even me, a guy's capacity to be a world-class asshole
Fortunately, 'm familiar with the cause
18
Will you please just tell her came by
Forget it
'll catch up with her on my own
No
You won't
Look, 'm gonna' see her again, -if she'll see me
don't care what the fuck you say about it
Oh, really
They face off
Yeah, really
You get near her, 'll feed your nuts to the neighbor's dog
What kind a' dog is it
Huh
mean, is it a pitbull, or what
Caught off guard, a smile escapes Max
(') 'm crazy about her
Shrooms, huh
Luke nods 'yes
' (') 'll tell her you came by
Luke nods, appreciative
19
' - - tanker truck  past
Surrounded by fir trees, the eerily empty mini-mart glows with fluorescent junk food
- Luke stands behind the cash register, leafing through "The Outdoors Man
" The   and  enters, early thirties, elegant in thrift-store chic
She's cool and in control,
at least on the outside
She surveys random candy bars, stealing glances at Luke
Had a sudden intense craving for a cherry popsicle
You can check in that freezer
What a relief
'm Sydney
You
Luke
Workin' late, huh
Luke
Yeah, four
It sucks
Sometimes you guys are just unfathomably stupid
Excuse me
Why in the world do guys say "it sucks" as if it were a bad thing
mean, every guy's dying to get a blow job, right
So, you think they'd treat those words with profound respect, like holy scripture
"What an unbelievable sunset, honey: doesn't it just ,"
"You won an Olympic Gold Medal
, that
" 20
guess you're right
It must be great at your age
That river of testosterone coursing through your veins, the damn about to burst
How about we just lock this place up and go for an Olympic Gold
No thanks
Jeez, lady
Disappointed, she checks her reflection in the freezer door
ought to dye my hair
Don't you think
Uh,  don't know
Looks fine
Your hair is such an incredible color
It's brown
love it
Do you think  could cut just a little piece
Match the color
It really "sucks
" Nah, c'mon
You're messin' with me
'm not
love it
You really should get rid a' that thing, anyway
have clippers in my bag
What thing
Cowlick
Right here
See
can just snip it off
She  his hair
Luke pulls away
21
Hey
What's the matter
Don't you like being touched
Don't you like being a guy
No
mean,
What
Sorry, but you're just bizarre
She , lays money on the counter
May be
But  learned long ago, you can't change your true nature, even if it can change you
As she leaves, she takes a provocative bite of the popsicle
'   - Acres of yellowing corn surround a dilapidated farmhouse converted into a pool hall
The windows glow from warm lights inside
Parked along the gravel driveway are pickup trucks, cars, and Luke's Semi
Smoke,   and the  of cue balls
Keenan and Luke snake their way through the pool tables
Holy shit
It's that lady from the store
Grey and black at the bar
Keenan looks over at Sydney, finishing off a bourbon
Janine and Michelle check out a rack of billiard balls from the worldly British owner,
She runs the place like a wild west saloon, with such ease and confidence, it suggests there may be a shotgun under the bar
22
That boy, Keenan, still giving you trouble
Actually,  tried exactly what you said
And
Unbelievable
Thanks
Works every time
(to Michelle) Nice to meet you, darling
hope you'll find not too many rules here, and the drinks not too dear
Yeah, thanks
It's amazing
Polly moves off
Isn't she great
Guys drive across the state just to buy a beer from her
Total loner, though
No one's ever seen her with anyone
What did she tell you to try
Janine whispers in her ear
Michelle's jaw drops open, scandalized
They
Luke hands his keys to , the handsome bartender, in exchange for a full pitcher of beer
Thanks, man
Oh, God
She's eyeing you think she's comin' over
23
Sydney saunters up
Can  buy you a drink
Uh, no thanks
We're already here with dates and stuff
You are
Who
Where is she
They're around somehwere
Luke, if you like this girl, we better talk
What
Sydney glances around, talks quietly
Anything happen since we last spoke
Hot flashes
Pressure in your chest
Luke pales
No
Who are you
Dr
Sydney Catchadourian
Keenan, right
You know him
We exchanged -mail
came right away
Luke gives Keenan the evil eye
From Philadelphia
Why
24
Your friend here has an extra chromosome
The little remaining color in Luke's face now drains away
He shakes his head 'no
' Someone put mushrooms in my mushroom sauce
tested your hair
You're like some whack job
Get the hell away from me
Luke moves off, sloshing beer
Sydney sighs
Denial, denial, denial
Always the first step
Keep him away from that girl
What're you talkin' about
Chromosomes
Most people have forty-six: Two  if you're a girl, an  and  if you're a guy
He's got forty seven: An , a , and a Janine and Michelle select pool cues
We've only been together six months
And he's such a guy's guy, everyone's buddy, but, alcoholic parents, six months in "Juvey
" Wild past, huh
25
think the only reason he's even alive right now, is okay, partly 'cause he's so damn smart, but mostly 'cause there's this one person, he knows, absolutely, no matter what, won't bale on him
You
No
He doesn't trust me at all
Luke
He's a rock
Yeah
So, yes, you can trust him
'm hoping Keenan's the same way
'Cause believe me, 'm not used to rocks, 'm used to pebbles
Michelle
Grains of sand
Luke rejoins them with the pitcher of beer, glancing back toward the bar
Keenan comes too, with a look of concern
Everything okay
Sure
need a drink
Keenan steals glances at Luke, trying to sort it all out
(') (aside to Luke) That lady's nuts
Luke nods
Sydney sits at a bar stool, keeping an eye on Luke and Michelle
Jeremy lays out a cocktail napkin, speaks with a slight Texas drawl
26
Another round
Please
You see that couple over there
don't get it
What's he see in her
The brunette
You kiddin'
'd give my left one to be with her
Yeah
So could he
- Now alone with Michelle, Luke lines up his cue stick, then catches Michelle's admiring eyes
She smiles, glances over at Keenan and Janine, making out by the jukebox
Your friends sorta' like each other, huh
Super-glue
Thirty seconds together, you can't pull 'em apart
How'd they meet
Keenan sold her a bike
don't think they've been apart more than six hours since
Luke peers over the corner pocket, and watches Michelle shoot and sink the ball
(') never thought in a million years you'd go out with me, let alone twice
You're not s'posed to say that
That's a total pathetic, loser thing to say
But 'm gonna' take it as a huge compliment
27
(') Okay, two word answers only
Why'd you ask me out in the first place
Beautiful
Unpretentious
Why'd you say 'yes
' Gentle
Luke sneers, not his favorite compliment
(') Hot
Deep
Three words
He smiles
Okay, two words
What're you most passionate about
Friendship
Trust
You
Hockey
Hockey
So much for "deep
" They
You
The electricity between them charges the air
Luke maneuvers himself closer
(') Okay, 'm gonna' take a wild shot
Ricochet off the back, over here, then straight into that side pocket
What are my chances
Point zero zero zero one
Luke takes his shot,
and
The ball ricochets off the back, across the table, and sinks in the pocket at the side
28
Jeremy looks on, aroused
Sydney squints, dismayed, barely able to watch
Damn
Will you look at that tonsil hockey
'd prefer not
This could get bad
You've been staring at him all night
You got a thing for him, or what
Actually, 'm hoping he's got one for me
Keenan and Janine rejoin Luke and Michelle, all four elated
Looks like you two are gettin' on okay
Should we rack up another game
Definitely
'd like to get good at this pool thing
Luke racks up the balls as Michelle lines up the cue
(') Okay, 'm gonna' break this wide open
Go for it
Before Keenan has lifted the wooden triangle rack, Michelle  the cue ball
It  off the rack, off the table,
and  Luke in the
29
Keenan, Michelle, and Janine
They , poised, waiting for Luke to react
God
Sorry
Luke picks the cue ball up off the floor and sets it on the table
He sees them watching him
What
Man, 'd be on the floor cryin' like a baby
No, 'm all right
Surprised, they return to the game
Michelle lines up the cue ball again, as Luke considers,
with a slow-dawning realization that something, somehow, just isn't right
He casually touches his hand to his pants
He pales slightly
(') Would you excuse me a sec'
He looks to Keenan for help
Sydney watches as Keenan and Luke cross the hall toward the back
She flags Jeremy
Jeremy
Bourbon
Fast
(a glance at Luke) Better give me the whole bottle
30
' Luke tries the men's room door, locked
In here
Keenan opens another door that leads them into a store room
Luke follows, with a look of concern
(') mean, it was like a precision- guided missile
Luke unzips and gently digs in his trousers
He looks down, ,
Uh- ah- Luke's face , terrified
'll get some ice
Luke shakes his head "no," points toward his crotch, , barely able to make a sound
It's-
Look
Keenan gives him a look, repelled, perplexed
What
then takes a look,
His
(') Sydney  in with the bottle of bourbon
was afraid a' this
(to Keenan) Make sure no one gets in
31
(') (to Luke) Now, will you listen to me
Luke, slack-jawed, keeps checking himself
Each time the horror of it grows more intense
Oh,
Sydney uncaps the bourbon and drops capsules in from a prescription bottle
It's gonna' come back
Drink this
What're you givin' me
Valium
Flexeril
And a shitload of Darvon
You gotta' calm down
"Caaalm Down
" Here we go
He and Sydney have to yell to hear over Luke's escalating "
" What's wrong with him
He's a Zerophiliac
what
'm gettin' a doctor
This isn't right
Sydney  Keenan,  him against the wall
am a doctor
You breathe one word, anyone else sees him like this, and he's fucked
Pictures all over the net, tabloids, television
32
-
No
We're gonna' get it back
(to Keenan) You let me help him, he gets a normal body, lives a normal life
Now, you his friend or not
Keenan nods that 'yes, he is
'     Sydney releases him
(') Hang onto him
So he doesn't get hurt when he passes out
Now just wait a sec'
Is it There are no recorded incidents of transmission from physical contact
"Recorded incidents
" Oh,  God
What did Nothing
You're a
"
"     Oh my God, used his deodorant
Oh, will you calm down
"
" "
" Luke's eyes glaze over
He weaves, losing his balance
Finally
33
Sydney helps Luke   on the floor
He passes out
(') He'll be alright
He didn't go all the way
When you fall asleep or pass out, a  almost always reverts back
It's called a Nocturnal Remission
Keenan approaches Luke, then steps back
(') Oh, relax, it's not contagious
Keenan grabs the bourbon-Darvon concoction from Sydney, wipes the rim of the bottle just in case, then takes a big swig
'  &  - On a corner table sits high-tech laboratory equipment
Keenan and Luke gulp beers, still in shock
Luke keeps one hand down his pants for reassurance
In the world
hundred thousand
There's no way to know
It doesn't show up in any normal test
It's triggered when you first have sex
The woman in the
(dark) From Utah
Now, you're Morphescent whenever you're aroused
You tellin' me this is gonna' happen any time he gets the hots for a girl
Keenan looks over at Luke
(') Man, this could be a problem
34
Is there a cure
It's not a disease
But there are steps you can take
Well, what are they
Take it easy
You can't rush this
Before anything, you need to try going all the way
"All the way
" You need to turn all the way into a female
You out of your mind
You have to give it a try
Maybe we should get a second opinion
Yeah, may be
'Cause you can Fine, but  warn you, they've never seen this before
First, they'll try a barrage of antipsychotic medications, surgery, electroshock therapy, -god knows what
If he were to try goin' all the way, then what
Luke glares at him
(') 'm just askin'
35
It ain't gonna' happen
Oh, for Chris' sake
'm trying to help you
That  chromosome's not latent anymore
You don't get control a' that thing, you don't know when it's going to kick in, what it's gonna' do
You want to end up with three left breasts, behemoth hips and one testicle
Luke and Keenan swallow, wide-eyed at the prospect
Sydney calms herself down
(') Now, there's no reason for that to happen
Sorry
You're not the only one who didn't get any sleep
Now, are you going to let me help, or not
How would he even do that
Go all the way,  mean
He's a
(to Luke) You become Morphescent when you get turned on
You can change all the way when you have an orgasm
With who
'm available
No way
Well, excuse me
Truth is, at this stage, you don't really need anyone else
Huh
36
Sydney wearily sips a highball
She looks to Keenan for help
Keenan flashes the international sign for jacking off
(') Oh
It's a lot to absorb,  know
When you're ready, give me a call
Your first time, you shouldn't be alone
- deserted, hilltop cemetery
Luke sits on the manicured lawn, across from a gravestone with vestigial images of brightly colored smiley-faces and fish
Michelle
And  really like her, dad
But,
He bounces a soccer ball against the headstone
(') You know,  always thought your dying was the worst thing that ever happened to me, and that happened more to you than it did to me mean, a lot more, really
Luke paces nervously
(') Look, every day  wish you were around, but  swear, if  tell you this, you damn well better stay dead
He glances at a burial ceremony, half-mile away
(') And  swear to God 'm gonna' beat this thing
No matter what it takes
Before  tell you,  just want to make sure you know that, okay
hushed voice
(') think  might be a Zerophiliac
37
Keenan and Luke spar on roller blades, hockey sticks in hand
Luke  the hockey puck with such intensity, it may land on Mars
'm not doin' it
don't care what she says
can control this thing
How
didn't know what was goin' on before
do now, so, it's not gonna' be a problem
just need to stay focused
You mean, keep yourself from getting turned on
How're you gonna' do that
You get turned on by two scoops of ice cream
Luke glares at him
(') 'm just sayin'
mean, you think Larissa, the horse-faced girl's got her good points
Michelle and Janine ride up on their bikes
knew we'd find 'em here
We just wanted to know if you're alright
After last night
Yeah
'm fine
Thanks
Perfect
Good
(slightly suggestive) Good
Luke smiles, his face
38
(') had a really good
Me too
Luke smiles, nods, followed by a look of
(') Will you excuse me a sec'
He ducks away
What is goin' on
We just need to be alone
We got a big game tomorrow
Sometimes guys just need to hang with the guys, you know
No distractions
Janine gives him a look of "What the hell are you talkin' about
" Keenan stares back,
Janine relents, despite herself
'mon, Michelle
Let the boys play with their pucks
Luke leans against the logs, wipes sweat from his brow, and realizes
'
Panicked, he grabs his crotch, feels it, Everything's normal
Or is it
He frantically unbuttons his shirt and peers inside,
He slumps back against the logs, 39
'  - Luke storms through the house, trying to evade Janine, who enthusiastically follows
Keenan traipses after
You
had to
You know Janine
She knew somethin' was up
've read about this kinda' thing, but  didn't think it was real
It's so cool
It's disgusting
How can you say that
If  had a chance to be a guy for a day, 'd jump at it
Seriously, Keen, wouldn't you want to get inside a girl's body
Realizing she just handed him the perfect straight line
(') Don't  go there
(rolling her eyes) Fine
You're boys
Still, isn't it every guy's dream to have a pair of boobs to play with anytime he wants
Not my own
(to Keenan) Man, how could you tell her
She should be here
It's just weird, two guys alone, one turnin' into a girl
Yeah,  can't wait
Not exactly something you get to see every day
Forget it
40
What,  gets to, and  don't
No one gets to
Luke goes in the bedroom,  the door
Keenan and Janine take up residence outside
Janine tries to peek through the keyhole, beneath the door
Should we put on some soft music
You want a magazine in there
(
) Shut up
Janine keeps an ear held close against the door
How 'bout a couple beers
Maybe you want to take a bath
(
) Will you  shut up
Does he sound different
Think so
(
) Oh God
(lewd) Oh, my God
(rising in pitch) Oh my
Keenan and Janine exchange a worried look
41
Now approaching the mirror, in awe,
gently raising a hand to touch the exquisite   reflected there, stands a real female, an absolutely
Janine knocks
Luke
You alright
The door opens, revealing Female Luke, wrapped in a sheet
Keenan clutches Janine
They ,    ,
Whoa
Dude
Female Luke speaks, with an unmistakably female voice
Happened fast, huh
Can we see
Female Luke hesitates
Come on
It's not like  haven't seen you naked a hundred times
And she's a girl
Female Luke shyly parts the sheet, revealing her stunning naked torso
(') Whoa
Dude
(exasperated) Of course they're perfect couldn't have tits like that
Female Luke checks herself out in the mirror
42
Oh, God
Look at me
Keenan and Janine sit on the edge of the bed, in shock
(') What's the matter
Keenan, afraid to answer, looks to Janine
They both have the same reaction
You're really hot
Victoria's Secret hot
Sports Illustrated Swimsuit edition
Latvian Lesbians' Hidden Camera Chronicles
(to Keenan) Don't look at me, -it's your tape
Keenan keeps his distance from Luke, embarrassed, if turned on
Look,  just wanna' get one thing straight
No way 'm gonna' sleep with you
Man, even as a joke, that's just will
'm definitely not into the butch hair thing, though
You gotta' do something about that
Keenan looks at her shocked
(') thought you're into watchin' two girls
Keenan's speechless
Female Luke can't stop gazing at herself in the mirror
43
This is too weird
This is freaking me out
Should we call Dr
Catchadourian
What for
did it
Now,  can switch back
Get outta' here
Already
Yeah, okay, yeah
Will you stop starin'
Janine rolls her eyes, as she and Keenan back out of the room, their eyes locked on her amazing body
- Janine and Keenan are sprawled on the nearby couch
Luca opens the door
Janine
It's like  can't get in the right mood or something
Welcome to my world
Oh, honey, no one could in this situation
You gotta' help
need to do this right now
You can't force these things
Some girls go half their lives before they even have one
Okay, Studly, what do you suggest
44
She likes it when  tell her stuff
Like what
"You're so beautiful," " love your smile," "The English Patient was my favorite movie too
" Janine and Female Luke both roll their eyes
Female Luke swings the door shut
The
(
) Who's that
Pizza
Figured you'll want some after
Janine throws it open, Max stands outside
Hey
Can  help you
was lookin' for Luke
Hey, man
He's not around right now
What's up
Female Luke comes out of the bedroom, wrapped in a sheet
Thank God
'm starving
She stops in her tracks, stares at Max
Max stares back, intrigued
How ya' doin'
45
Female Luke nods 'okay
' (') 'm Max
You live here too
Janine, Keenan, and Female Luke are momentarily speechless
No
She's just visiting
She's Luke's cousin
Luca
Keenan and Luca  at Janine
Max gazes at Luca, spellbound
always thought "Luca" was a guy's name
Italian or something
Luca wraps herself more tightly in the sheet
'm part Italian
Cool
'm part Italian too
The important part
(perfect Italian) Lei sono una bella donna
Amerei per mostrarlo il che inclinando torre di pisa
What's that mean
His eyes fixed on Luca, he smiles
You in town for a while
No, just a few weeks
'Weeks
' Days
46
'm leaving today
Now
Is there anything you want me to tell Luke
Max gets fluid, scanning the room for a toehold, infatuated by Luca
He seizes on a hockey stick
'm way into hockey
was hopin' Luke could show me the ropes
Is he as awesome as 've heard
Yeah
He's alright
Do you play
Uh,  don't know
She's gotta' pack
You need to go
Really nice meeting you
Janine ushers Max out the door and shuts it on him
Luca ducks into the bedroom, shuts the door
Luca at the window, peers out between the curtains, watching, as Max walks away
As Max gets to the end of the driveway, he stops and turns back, sporting a charming smile
Luca jumps away from the window, smacking into Janine
Are you okay
Luca just stares back at her, nonplussed
47
(') What is it
What's the matter
(beginning to get it) Oh
"Oh" what
What do you mean, "oh
" (shrugs) He's a hunk
got to switch back
Right now
What's the big deal
Get out of here
Just
Okay, okay
Janine emerges from the bedroom to join Keenan
He looks up at her, questioning
What's goin' on
It's a girl thing
Does he need any help in there
Not from you
- Keenan and Janine sprawled out, leaning against the door, half-eaten pizza between them on the floor,
emanates from inside the bedroom
(
) This is good
48
Keenan and Janine
Finally
Alright, okay, now open those little levers on the sides,
and flip that center thingy back
Keenan finds this particularly unsettling
(
) (enthused) Did you get this thing at the mall
No
Janine wouldn't have one a' those
Please
And mine's got way more features than that one
(Keenan's crotch) Or that one
Keenan gives her the evil eye
(
) So, where'd you get it
It was Larissa's
My roommate
Inside the bedroom, the
(
) Keenan grabs the last bottle from his six-pack
'm just sayin', he's not that experienced with girls
Oh, and you are
49
'm startin' to wonder if you are
'm not gonna' feed your fantasies
Keenan flips the  remote, disturbed
Luca sits on the edge of the bed, frustrated
(
) (') Luca
Don't call me that
(
) You gotta' just think about whatever turns you on
No matter what it is
Luca considers, she goes over to the window, peers out momentarily, then draws back
Janine lies down on the floor
(') (last ditch) Okay, pretend you're thrown on your back, pinned against the bed
Spread eagle, eyes closed, she fantasizes, as she directs
(') You can't move an arm, a leg, nothing, even an inch
Keenan glances over, taken aback at her tone
(') And two strong hands feel your thighs,
Keenan watches, getting turned on
(') creeping firmly, slowly toward your breasts
50
Keenan lunges for Janine
(') Keen
Babe, every time  look at you, get the shivers
just want to rip your clothes off, and throw you down
Oh, Keen
They're kissing,    now,
want to envelop every inch of you, that incredible curve along your side,
They roll on the floor, clothes torn
(') want to pin your arms over your head, and make mad, passionate
(
) Keenan and Janine
Whether agony or ecstasy, it's a frightening sound
The door opens
Luke stands in his shorts,
You're a screamer
- Sydney makes her way through a barbed-wire fence, past a "No Trespassing" sign
lone   in the distance
Life-size replicas of Greek Gods, Venus and David, all face one way in the mist
Their cold stone bodies press up against each other; nude, indifferent
figure peers out between the statues in a long black coat, a baseball cap over his eyes: Luke
51
What are we doing here
Didn't want anyone around
So, did what you said
Amazing, huh
Weird
Awful
Hmm
Was it difficult making the switch
No
It was hard gettin' back need an owner's manual
Sydney smiles, nods in agreement
lot of guys could use one of those
So, what now
Do  take pills or something
No, it doesn't work like that
This may sound odd, but  need to know if you're attracted to me
What
No
Hmm
You're not gay, are you
Jeez
'm just not attracted to you like that
Okay, calm down
This could be a problem
Right now, you can go either way anytime you want
It's a very special and critical time for a , something you'll experience only once in life
52
Good
You need to use this incredible opportunity you've been given, to figure out which you're supposed to be: male or female
What
Don't you see
You get to choose
don't want to choose
want to be a guy
Yes, well, the thing is, sometimes your desires can conflict with your desires
It's important to know for sure
Believe me,  know
think you need to try again
No way
Why're you so resistant
If the truth is, you want to be a guy, great, but if not
Don't even say that
Well, clearly some part of you feels differently
You couldn't change if you didn't want to
What
That's crap
53
That's the thing about the truth
It'll set you free, but first it can really piss you off
Sydney moves to leave
This is nuts
'm supposed to be a guy
Then what's the problem
You are one
Sydney turns to leave
You're not gonna' help
will, the moment you're ready to try again
You can come back to my place right now if you want
Forget it
- Bikes and 's outside the shut down mill
Abandoned timber surrounds an asphalt clearing
Luke, Keenan, Chad, Jeremy, and   in the midst of a friendly, if brutal roller hockey game
Luke glances over and spots Max high up on a pile of logs, cheering them on
Jeremy passes the puck off to Luke who drives it to score the winning
The Guys
Well, ain't we a basket a' biscuits
Yeah, Luke, what got into you today
54
The Force
The guys gather up their belongings near the cars
Luke sits on the running board of his truck, unlacing his skates
Max comes over
Hey
Good game
Yeah
dropped by your place
Any chance you could give me a few pointers
Me
You're awesome out there
And according to my sister, you walk on water
Luke grunts, a smile
(') Truth is,  uh, met your cousin
Luca
Oh
Yeah
You both have practically the same name
We were both named after our Uncle
Locasto
Well, she's cool
Actually, she's hot
was hopin' maybe you could hook me up
55
Huh
No
Not a chance
Boyfriend
No
She just wouldn't be interested
She a Lesbian
No
Of course not
Jesus
She's, -my cousin
Yeah, okay
So
Michelle's my sister
You gonna' tell me you wouldn't like to do her
, man
Luke  Max, who  him right back
What is your deal
You
Luke lunges for him
They go at it, wrestling
Max gets the upper hand, and pins Luke down to the ground
Luke surges with , breaks free
Grit teeth, ripped clothes, they roll on top of each other, two rabid pitbulls
Keenan and the Other Guys rush in, pulling them apart
Keep the fuck away from me
And Michelle too
You can fuck off
What the hell's goin' on
56
(to the guys) Luke's datin' his sister
(recognition) Aaaah
Oh, you can all fuck off
Luke breaks free of the guys, and moves off
'   - Sydney stands at the bar with a cup of coffee, chatting with Jeremy
This shirt
've had it for years
Well, it's very sexy
love men's clothes
What else have you got in your closet
Jeremy smiles, unsure what she means
When Polly approaches, her eyes a little red, Jeremy pulls her aside
Polly, are you alright
Didn't mean to walk in on you
Oh, hon
'm fine, thanks
Love, tears
That's the trade-off
She puts a hand to his cheek, reassuring
Jeremy ducks behind the bar
My God, he's gorgeous
Yes, he's a Michelangelo
And the sweetest boy in the world
Sorry, darling, 'm afraid you'll find he's not your type
Oh, we'll see about that
57
think he may prefer men
certainly hope so
Keenan and Janine enter
(') You two better have a seat
Is Luke alright
He should have full control over this now
Something must be really confusing him
The only thing can think of
What
When he became Luca, was he attracted to one of you
You can get really thrown by that
Janine
No
Not me
Well, he sure as hell wasn't attracted to me
No
Definitely not
Wasn't it just the two of you
Not exactly
Janine glances to Keenan, as his eyes  , grossed out
Oh, give me a break
No way
Max
They just had a huge fight
He tried to beat the crap out of him
Janine and Sydney exchange a knowing look
58
(') Oh, Christ, Luke's not queer
He was just turnin' into a girl
Exactly
He was a girl
Oh
This is just wrong
Would you rather she was attracted to me
Would you
Maybe  would
Whoa
Right now, Luke needs your help
He needs to know you're behind him, no matter what he wants
Janine nods
So, what's all this mean
Bottom line
Maybe Luca really likes this boy, -enough to want to be female
(to Keenan) Don't sneer
Oh, come on
know the guy
We've done all kinds a' shit together: Hoops, hockey
Oh, and girls can't play sports
Oh, -whatever
Christ, Janine
Why the hell would he want to be a girl
59
That's so hard to imagine
Uh, -
know what 'm talking about
You see this
Sydney pulls out a , shows it to Janine
Who's he
An Ex
Oh, my God
Ex me
You're one too
You're a
You're a guy
Was
made a terrible mistake
She and Keenan keep staring at the photo
(') And once you finally figure out who you are, it's a horrible thing not being yourself
That's why it's crucial we help Luke
Janine nods, grasping the significance
Keenan keeps looking from the photo to Sydney and back again
You musta' worked out
- Luke sits, waiting on the steps of a campus dormitory
Janine approaches, grinning, carrying a box tied with a bow
Keenan trails behind, straddling his bike
What's this all about
Janine hands him the box
60
Keenan sneers, cringes
It's just a little something we thought you might want
Luke opens it, pulls out a
What the hell is this for
(elated) told her
(to Janine) told ya'
What a stupid ass idea
Keen
Don't
We just want you to know, whatever you decide, it's all right with us
Decide
No, it's not
Get this thing away from me Luke  the box out to the curb
Keenan gives him a thumbs up
Sorry, man
Think she wishes everyone was female
What's that s'posed to mean
Oh, Christ, Janine
It means he doesn't want to be girl
Like he'd have to think about
There happen to be millions of us out there that like being female
Well, bully for
Janine walks over to pick up the box
61
want to know
Just exactly what's wrong with being a girl
Nothin'
It's great
It's fuckin' , if you happen to  one
Maybe we should've had this conversation the other afternoon
That wasn't my choice
sure as hell didn't make you do it
Janine, will you just let me talk to him for a sec'
Oh, what
It's a '
' Give me a fuckin' break
Janine storms off with the box
Sorry, man
She talked me into it
You know Janine
Keenan picks up his bike, gets on
(') Look, uh,
you do like bein' a dude, right
Asshole
Keenan , rides off
(calling back) You should thank me
The one she picked out was
62
Luke passes a sidewalk trash can and notices the gift box mangled inside
Glancing around to make sure no one's watching, he pulls the dress out, brushes off some dirt
He shoves it back in the trash, stares at it
- - Luke kneels on the floor, stocking candy shelves
The
He peers over the aisle, looks around, no one in sight
Michelle appears by the soda dispenser, wary of him
Hi
Hey
How are you
'm okay
You
As they talk, Michelle maneuvers to get closer
Luke maneuvers to keep his distance
Okay
You look really nice
Thanks
was hopin' you might call
was going to
There's something  need to talk to you about
-But did  do something wrong
No
Nothin' like that
There's just some stuff 've got to sort out
63
Like what
They gaze at each other across the magazine rack, a mountain range of silence between them,
(') There's nothing you can't tell me
Me too
What did you want to talk to me about
They stand silent, beneath the hum of fluorescent lights
Nothing really
So, heard you and Max really got into it
Yeah
kind a' lost it
He knows how to push buttons, huh
What exactly did he say that got you so pissed off
don't know
We'd just finished a game
was all revved up
He's actually a really nice guy
Not sure he's too crazy about me seein' his sister
Did he scare you off
No, he doesn't "scare" me
What, his struttin' around, thinkin' he's such a bad ass, with his shirt hangin' open half the time
Luke's surprised and embarrassed by his own words
Michelle steps away, confused
64
It's just an act
He likes pretending he's Joe Cool
Always says you gotta' just be whatever you want, and fuck 'em if they can't take a joke
Well, he's a joke alright
Look, 'm not sure this is gonna' work out
'm sorry,  didn't mean- No
can't do this
'm not sure you even know who you are
Much less who  am
Have you ever even had a girlfriend
What's that supposed to mean
Well, if you think my brother's such a "joke," how much better could you think of me
We're not that different, you know
You're totally different
He's a guy, for one
And he's my best friend
If you don't like him, you can't like me
She exits
- - Luke kneels in the aisle, stocking shelves, distracted, fidgety, distressed
He glances up at the magazine rack
Female Fitness magazine catches his attention
The   model seems to
He stares at it: no movement
65
Luke approaches the rack, and flips over the magazine cover
As he steps away, he glances back at the rack, The  on the cover comes to life
He rips off his shirt as he moves off one magazine cover and into another, where he passionately kisses the -
on half a dozen covers begin stripping down, moving to other magazines and making out with each other all across the rack
- The windows glow among the dark trees
Inside, Luke rips up covers,  magazine after magazine across the floor
: - Michelle leans against the shower wall, staring at the spray of water, upset
Steam rises, filling the bathroom
She begins , longingly,
" wanna know how to go To the inside of love
can't find my way through
" Washing herself, behind the shower curtain, the timbre of her singing voice mysteriously shifts
As her hand turns the shower faucet, it changes
(') "'m outside of love, To the side or above, can't find my way with you" 66
glimpse of her shoulder behind the shower curtain, grows more muscular, and her voice begins   ,
as
"Must be a special view, Finding a me with a you, On the inside of love
" Max steps out of the shower, and towels off in the mirror
'  &  - persistent  on the door
Sydney pulls on a robe over a pair of men's boxers, wiping sleep from her eyes
She swings the door open
Luke stands outside in
Oh, honey
Come in
Sydney pours hot tea
You're one too
Why didn't you tell me
didn't want to confuse the issue
So, it's true what you said
You really know
wouldn't change unless  wanted to
Maybe some part of you
What part
How much of me mean, for it to work
Half
More than half
What if it was only a tiny bit, -a thought
67
don't know
But  believe there may be thousands of 's out there, millions for all we know, go their whole lives without even knowing they are one
Nothing ever happens
You couldn't keep it from happening
love being with Michelle
How come  can't control it when she's around
think whatever part of yourself you deny, just gets bigger and bigger until it takes you over
Luke nods sadly
You think  don't really want to be a man
think for some, making it stop is more important than knowing who you are
It was for me
Maybe for me too
Right now, you're Morphescent
The key is to have sex with another
You become Adulmorphic
Your gender locks
You can't just change anytime you want
Another
That's why  came all the way out here
And why you keep tryin' to get me in the sack
68
Thought maybe  could save you some distress
But you say you're not attracted to me
For it to work, both of us have to be into it
That won't be a problem
Okay then
Tonight
Not right now
Okay
Tonight
- Morning dew
Acres of empty grass
Luke sits at the top of a hill by his dad's grave
Remember that Christmas when Keen and me accidentally set the Scofields' house on fire
He stares up at the sky
(') And that burning shingle drifted over and lit up the Robertson's place
The whole town was ready to lynch us, and we snuck back home
Two , you were up drinkin' coffee,
He tugs out hunks of grass
(') thought you were gonna' kill us
But you just looked me right in the eye, and said, "Son, there's leftover pizza in the fridge
" tear rims his eye
(') That was the coolest thing anyone ever said
Dad, 'm in such trouble
69
(') feel like if  let this thing in, it's all over
But  don't know what else to do
Guess you can't figure out who you are, until you accept who you might be
'  &  - Department store shopping bags and boxes are strewn across the bed
Sydney checks herself out in the full-length mirror
man's gray tuxedo jacket over lingerie
- The giant work floor of the abandoned mill
Sunlight beams through holes in the roof
Max, on roller blades, practices guiding the hockey puck along the floor
He stops when he notices the figure watching him from outside the giant metal doors: Luca in the blue dress, on roller blades, hockey stick in hand
You're about the last person expected to see
can show you a few moves if you want
Yeah
What the hell
Luca demonstrates hockey technique, expertly guiding a hockey puck through an obstacle course of broken equipment, timber, and sawdust piles
All the while, she dodges Max's attempts to steal the puck
Max finally gets it, which riles Luca
She hip checks Max
They swerve to avoid a pipe, crash-landing on top of each other on a sawdust pile
They bust out
70
Not bad
You're better than Luke
taught him everything he knows
Luca pulls away from Max, suddenly self-conscious that Max's leg is on top of hers
Awkward from the broken connection, they gaze up at the blue sky through a hole in the roof
thought you left town
Had to come back
Good
Where'd you learn to speak Italian
Just tourist stuff
"'ll have the spaghetti bolognese
" "How much for a room
" Have you been
Little Italy
In New York
Someday, though
Want to go with me
Max leans over and  Luca
She responds, tentatively at first, then as she grows more confident,
her face , she
Luca pulls back, self-conscious, confused
She brushes sawdust off her dress, stands
Look, this was a mistake
71
Yeah
Of course
know
Looking up, Luca sees Keenan, staring at them from across the floor, incredulous
Keenan exits out through the giant doors
Oh, Jesus
Are you and he
Huh
It's really none of my business
No
'm sorry
shouldn't've come here
Max stands, brushes off the sawdust
Please don't say you're "just visiting
" That you "need to leave
" 'm the one who needs to leave
Max skates off across the giant shop floor
- The Semi Truck is parked alone in the middle of the asphalt
From inside the cab, the blue dress flips over the rolled down window
Keenan leans against a tractor, rolls his eyes, and twists open another beer, which he gulps
Luke hops down from the truck cab wearing Langford
sweats and a -shirt
Keenan sits on the running board
72
mean, what the  is goin' on
You do wanna' be a girl
You're into guys now
No
don't know exactly
don't know
Keenan downs his beer, pensive
He crushes the can and hurls it,  a garbage can
What about Michelle
had to be sure
am now
Come on, it's sort of a Catch-22 make out with a girl,  start turning into one
You gotta' admit, it's a little weird, isn't it
Suddenly uncomfortable sitting so close to Luke, Keenan stands
(') Let's get outta' here
You want a ride somewhere
Janine's
Why don't you go see her
Think you're more her type
Keenan picks up his bike
(') 'll see ya' round, okay
"See me around
" Keenan shrugs
Look, 'm gonna' find my own place, okay
This is gettin' too fuckin' weird for me
'm goin' to Dr
Catchadourian's tonight
To make this stop
73
don't care
've had it with all this crap
mean, you gonna' start hittin' on me next
Yeah, that's right Keenan, you and me: let's do it
Keenan rides off, leaving Luke shell-shocked
'  &  - Sydney wears a stunning black silk evening gown
Small Greek statues now adorn the room
guess  really did need to face it head on in order to see
It was courageous
Girls, are just,  don't know
It's a different energy
They're soft and warm, they can make a guy feel complete
And multiple o's
Actually, male 's have multiple o's too
Been so long  nearly forgot
Cool
Okay, to be honest, 'm relieved you sorted this out
My conscience would have bothered me for decades if we'd just gone ahead without you being certain
Sydney pops a cork and pours herself and Luke glasses of champagne
toast
(') To womanhood
74
To manhood
They drink
(') So, how does this work
We just do it
And,
it just happens
Luke and Sydney begin undressing
Do you like this dress
Sure
Looks great on you
Man, dresses
Even without everything else, dresses are reason enough right there to stay a guy
Sydney takes this in, considers,
"Stay a guy
"   Let me get this straight
You didn't decide to be a woman
No
Of course not
What
Sydney, realizing her mistake, regroups: Plan
Just testing you
Hold on a moment
There's something forgot
She retrieves some
What's that for
You've never done it with another Trust me, you need to be tied down
75
Does it hurt
On the contrary
- The alabaster eyes of a small Greek Statue stares blankly in the direction of the   coming from the bed, (
) Just let yourself go completely
(
) Wow, this is intense
(
) When two 's do it, the lateral hypothalamus gets completely overwhelmed,
(
) ,
(
) Cellular fission kicks in, and, well,
you can go Zytusional
(
) Unbelievable
The chiseled eyes of a two-foot Statue of David, blankly stare
(
) (') Oh no
What's happening
Luke's voice begins
- (
) What have you done
(Luca) The  , growing increasingly more , culminating in the extraordinary, never before heard, 76
/   (
) Silence
- great-looking, bare-chested guy with Sydney's hair appears in reflection:
Behind him, still strapped to the bed, is now Luca, a  in her mouth
Male Sydney carries a phone while fussing with his hair in the mirror
(into phone) hear you're the best
Yes, it's an emergency
Please
Or 'll have to cut it myself
(to Luca) Now, you look me in the eye, and tell me that wasn't the best sex you ever had
Luca ,
(') (into phone) Half an hour
you
Male Sydney clicks the phone off
(') You can have all my clothes
Oh, and  just bought these incredible Anna Felucci pumps
(reconsiders) Maybe  should keep those
Male Sydney returns to dressing, a ribbed tank beneath a gray Italian tux
(') Okay,  wasn't completely honest with you, but  never lied either
It stopped
That is what you wanted
You're Adulmorphic now
The only way to switch is to do it with another
77
He gazes at Luca, a pang of guilt
He sits on the bed, speaks softly
(') know you don't believe me, but this is the right thing for you
Eventually, you'll figure that on your own
But  could tell it was just gonna' take way too long
Luca stares, distraught
(') Oh, for Chris' sake
Being a woman doesn't make you any less of a man
The entire bed  back and forth as Luca struggles
Male Sydney winces, pangs of guilt, which turn to anger
(') Damnit
can't live my whole wrong 'cause of one stupid mistake
'm a man
love havin' this chest, these arms
But most of all,
(grabs his pant crotch) Welcome home, boys
Hang in there, 'm takin' you out for a
Luca lies alone in the room, bound and gagged on the bed
at the door
Luca  and tries to  through her gagged mouth
The
The ivy parts and Keenan peers in
His eyes
He pushes the window open a little, whispers
What's goin' on
Where is she
Luca  and struggles against the ropes
78
(') Whoa
guess  really didn't think you were gonna' go this way
Okay
Whatever
Keenan sits on the edge of the bed
Luca  trying to get Keenan to remove the gag
(') Hang on a sec'
Look, 'm sorry about earlier, -what  said
But all this stuff
Janine and split up
Luca stops struggling, shocked
(') All  ever did was piss her off
'm not sure she even wants a guy
And you think 'm so much better with girls than you, and sure  can get laid anytime  want, but truth is,  never even woulda' hit on her if it weren't for watchin' you
Keenan climbs on top of Luca, starts untying her hands, straddling her
(') The way you just talk to 'em about anything, like it was okay gotta' get her back, man
With Herculean effort, Keenan struggles to hold back tears
(') It's like the whole world's blown apart
Ah, shit
Man, you havin' tits now is just weird
The truck  along through the trees, head lamps , dashboard lights bright
Keenan's at the wheel
Janine said he's definitely there
79
Did she mention me
Luca indicates 'no
' (') Women
God, 'm glad you want to be a guy
You are absolutely sure, right
Yes
'Cause it really is totally cool either way
'm
Okay,  just don't want you to think 'm zerophobic, or somethin'
'   - Students gather outside the farmhouse pool hall
Male Sydney spots his prey, and approaches Jeremy, who hangs out alone on the grass near a small bonfire
The firelight licks their faces
You're on the wrestling team
Yeah
You catch the meets
Just an educated guess
Wanna' wrestle
Jeremy , glances around, unsure what to make of him
The truck  around a
Can't this thing go any faster
80
Luca considers
(') You know me better than anyone
What do you think
Huh
mean, if  weren't a hundred percent sure which 'm s'posed to be
If you had to say
All  know is, every time you look at Michelle, or think about her, you smile
What the hell else do you need to know
It's not right
She deserves to be with a normal guy
So, you don't get to be with anyone
They drive in silence
(') That why they call it "zero- philia
" She's not gonna' want some guy who thinks maybe he's supposed to be a girl sometimes
How do you know
Did you ask
No way 'm gonna' ask her that
Well, you have to
Where are your nads, man
Luca glares at him
Keenan realizes his mistake
(') We'll get 'em back
81
The truck  on
' As Janine looks on, Male Sydney moves in for the kill
Come on, let's grab a couple beers
Sydney tugs at his -shirt
(') Of course,  see you brought your own six-pack
Keenan and Luca hop down from Luke's truck, scanning the crowd
Janine waves to Luca and points across the way
Luca nods
Let's go
Jeez
She won't even look at me
They stride across the field
Male Sydney shoves Jeremy passionately against the wall
do love to mess with Texas
Keenan and Luca appear around the corner
There
We better get outta' here
Keenan reaches them first
He wrenches Male Sydney and Jeremy apart
82
Keenan
It's not the way it looks
Oh, Jeremy,  so profoundly don't care if you're queer
Trust me, around here, that's nothin'
Luca catches up and  Male Sydney, throttling him on the ground
You son-of-a-bitch
We're doin' it again, right now
Jeez
She your wife
No
She just said, she wants sex
(to Luca) can't
'm sorry
"Sorry
"     Fuck you
It won't work
We're goin' inside right here
'll scream rape
So will
They pull Male Sydney toward the barn door
But 'm gay
So what
We both need to be into it, or nothing happens
83
Such bullshit
Jeremy moves off, wide-eyed and disturbed
That's why  became a woman in the first place
couldn't handle it
Figured if  was female, it was okay to like guys
She's lyin'
Male Sydney shakes his head 'no
' You're tellin' me, 'cause you're straight as a girl and 'm straight as a guy, we can screw and switch, but
'cause you're straight as a girl, and 'm gay as a guy, even if we do it
'm just screwed
Keenan's confused
Jeez
You need trigonometry to figure this thing out
Maybe you're 'bi
' In my world the Kinsey scale's three-dimensional, but trust me, girls do nothing for me
Zilch
(to Keenan) You, on the other hand
Keenan
What am  gonna' do
What if he's lying
say, do him again anyway
84
Fine
Fine
Waste of time
Luca notices Michelle standing nearby
Michelle
Oh, man
It's not what you think
Keenan and Luca realize that she's Luca right now, not Luke
What does she think
'm not sure
You asshole
Michelle moves off
Luca runs up
don't believe this
You slept with that guy
It's not what you think
Oh, please
What about Max
What about him
Don't you care about him at all
Not like that: 'm straight
'm attracted to you
85
Oh, who cares, you idiot
And sorry to break it to you, but 'm straight too
No
This'll sound crazy, but 'm not who you think  am- Oh, Christ, Luke, -Luca:  know who you are
Luca stares, stunned
You know 'm a Zerophiliac
Yes
So you can just go fuck yourself
-Literally
Does Max know who  am
What if he does
Do you
He's a guy
And you're a girl
'm not
Michelle gestures "Oh really
" (') 'm not supposed to be
There's no supposed to be anything, you just
Is that what you think
86
Well, then congratulations
You're a guy, just like every other guy ever met
can't believe you slept with him
He was a woman
was tricked didn't know 'd switch
Michelle stares, incredulous
You're gonna' tell me he's a too
Both of you
Yes
Well, that's just perfect
What, is there something in the water around here
She told me it would make it stop
That it would keep me from turning into a girl
So what
Why's that so important to you
There's no way this was gonna' work
Because 'm a Zerophiliac
Because you can't stand being one
Bye, Luca
(correcting her) Luke
She glances back, sad and angry
Luca watches her go, distraught, and then
Luca collapses on the ground, overlooking Polly Wog's
87
Janine and Keenan run up, a few yards behind
They sit nearby, catching their breath, unsure what to say
Luca gazes up at the moon
(') What's it like
To really make love
They all three gaze up at the moon
Keenan steals a glance at Janine
The best part's just lyin' there after
Really close, really far away
Like goin' to the moon, maybe
Yeah
They should open a pizza joint up there
Janine glares at him, and Keenan winces
What am  gonna' do
Maybe being a woman'll turn out okay
Like being an elevated member of the male species
Elevated "member
" just mean, maybe he'll learn to like it
(sarcastic, to Keenan) As hard as that is to conceive
Shut up
Both of you
What, you want a written guarantee
You're so damn lucky
You're into him, he's into you
Super-glue
What the hell else do you need to know
88
Janine looks to Keenan with a look of remorse, hopeful
think you're the female half of me
think you're the macho half of me
They kiss
And  don't know what half of who the hell  am
They look to Luca surprised,
then all three bust out
What are you gonna' do
don't know
prefer being a guy, but 'm a girl
'm attracted to Max, but 'm in love with Michelle
It's like 'm s'posed to be both
Her own admission surprises her
(') Not too practical
But at least now  know
She almost laughs, sad, but relieved
'   - The place is cleared out, save for Polly cleaning up behind the bar and Max, alone, shooting pool
Girl trouble
Boy trouble
Max shrugs
(') How about we get a game in before dawn
89
Max nods, sets up a new rack
What's the point
It never works out
Or they just cheat on you anyway
Liverpool was a veritable shagfest when  was your age
boulevard of broken hearts
But eventually, found him
She sinks the cue ball in a corner pocket
(') Scratch
Then he died
Sorry
Everything reminded me of him
So, came here, half way round the world to forget
Then created this place, just like the one where we met
He can't handle this
Us
He can't handle who he is
You being a guy too
Or him being a girl
Polly's confused, but presses on
Everyone's terrified
But once you really know someone, and they know you, it makes you whole
No one wants to know who  really am
You're so sure
90
It's impossible
He was the one person  thought could understand
But no, it's impossible
Max puts the cue stick down, and moves off
Polly calls after,
It's worth finding out
- Max slides out from under an old car
Seeing Luca, he hardens, wiping his greasy hands on a rag
Hey
Hey
know she doesn't want to talk to me
But do you know where  can find her
New York
Left two days ago
Oh, man
You're staying
Just 'til Friday
Max returns to his work
wanted to apologize to her
Forget it,  don't know,
Obviously, nothing's gonna' ever be with me and her, but  just wish she knew how much , -and that wasn't cheating,  was just trying to be a man for her
(laughs) She'd have a field day with that one, huh
True
91
If you talk to her, please just tell her, 'm sorry, and  wish her the best,
everything
Thanks
Luca 'nods', not fully understanding Max's response
'm sorry
To you too
For what
Mixed signals,  guess
Max walks toward the back, then , wincing
Ow
Son-of-a-bitch
You all right
Stepped on a nail
Damn it
Max sits on a crate, starts untying his boot
(') So, you gettin' used to this at all
wish
You definitely had me confused
For whatever it's worth
think you're a pretty hot guy
Thanks
But you're not interested
Truth is,  am
And  guess it sounds crazy, but  couldn't do that to Michelle
92
Luca moves off, as Max removes his boot, and his sock
For whatever it's worth,  think you're pretty hot too
Thanks
Too bad you're a moron
Excuse me
have incontrovertible proof
Luca stares at Max, and then down at his ankle, at the Max meets her eyes, and it finally dawns on Luca, standing, in shock, and now putting it all together, she  for him, nailing him to the ground, kissing him
She  Max's -shirt as they fall to the asphalt, knocking over oil cans
Passion
Unbridled
Luca manhandles Max, shoving him against a pile of huge tires, as Max's face transforms
Michelle slams back onto the crabgrass
She pulls Luca toward her as Luca's face transforms into Luke
Luke and Michelle roll on the crabgrass, kissing, as they roll, into Luca and Max and Michelle and Luke and Luca -or was that Max
93
'  - White gauze curtains billow in the morning breeze
The sun's first rays light up the down comforter and white pillows
Michelle stirs slowly, then
She grabs Luke, a vise grip around his torso
He awakens, groggy
Hey you
Good morning
What's up
Michelle bites her lip, embarrassed, releases him
(') You still think 'm going to bolt, don't you
And leave me stuck
He smiles
What do you want, a gender pre-nup
Maybe
have to go to work
She nuzzles him playfully
Luke glances at the clock,
Only place 'm going is back to sleep
No
can't show up at work like this
Oh, yeah
He smiles, folds into her
