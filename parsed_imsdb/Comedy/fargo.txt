href <b>// --> </b> a screenplay by Ethan Coen and Joel Coen The following text fades in over black: This is a true story
The events depicted in this film took place in Minnesota in 1987
At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed
Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occured
Slowly the white becomes a barely perceptible image:  white particles wave over a white background
snowfall
car bursts through the curtain of snow
The car is equipped with a hitch and is towing another car, a brand-new light brown Cutlass Ciera with the pink sales sticker showing in its rear window
As the car roars past, leaving snow swirling in their dirft, the title of the film fades in
Green highway signs point the way to , /,
The roads for the two cities diverge
sign says     and another just after says   , ,
44,412
The car pulls into a Rodeway Inn
man in his early forties, balding and starting to paunch, goes to the reception desk
The clerk is an older woman
And how are you today, sir
Real good now
'm checking in - Mr
Anderson
The man prints "Jerry Lundega" onto a registration card, then hastily crosses out the last name and starts to print "Anderson
" As she types into a computer: Okay, Mr
Anderson, and you're still planning on staying with us just the night, then
You bet
The man turns on the , which shows the local evening news
- whether they will go to summer camp at all
Katie Jensen has more
It was supposed to be a project funded by the city council;  it was supposed to benefit those Fargo-Moorehead children who would otherwise not be able to afford to attend a lakeshore summer camp
But nobody consulted city controller Stu Jacobson
Anderson sits alone at a table finishing dinner
Muzak plays
middle-aged waitress approaches holding a pot of regular coffee in one hand and decaf in the other
Can  warm that up for ya there
You bet
The man looks at his watch
We are pulling into the snowswept parking lot of a one-story brick building
Broken neon at the top of the building identifies it as the Jolly Troll Tavern
troll, also in neon, holds a champagne glass aloft
The bar is downscale even for this town
Country music plays on the jukebox
Two men are seated in a booth at the back
One is short, slight, youngish
The other man is somewhat older, and dour
The table in front of them is littered with empty long-neck beer bottles
The ashtray is full
Anderson approaches
'm, uh, Jerry Lundegaard - You're Jerry Lundegaard
Yah, Shep Proudfoot said - Shep said you'd be here at 7:30
What gives, man
Shep said 8:30
We been sitting here an hour
've peed three times already
'm sure sorry
- Shep told me 8:30
It was a mix-up, guess
Ya got the car
Yah, you bet
It's in the lot there
Brand-new burnt umber Ciera
Yeah, okay
Well, siddown then
'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud
Yah, how ya doin'
So, uh, we all set on this thing, then
Sure, Jerry, we're all set
Why wouldn't we be
Yah, no, 'm sure you are
Shep vouched for you and all
got every confidence in you fellas
They stare at him
An awkward beat
So  guess that's it, then
Here's the keys - No, that's not it, Jerry
Huh
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom
thought Shep told you - Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry
Well, okay, it's - Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then
Yeah, you already said that
Yah
But it's not a whole pay- in-advance deal
give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and - 'm not gonna debate you, Jerry
Okay
'm not gonna sit here and debate
will say this though:  what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense
Oh, no, it's real sound
It's all worked out
You want your own wife kidnapped
Yah
Carl Stares
Jerry looks blankly back
You - my point is, you pay the ransom - what eighty thousand bucks
-   mean, you give us half the ransom, forty thousand, you keep half
It's like robbing Peter to play Paul, it doesn't make any - Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom
The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off
Now, 'm in a bit of trouble - What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry
Well, that's, that's, 'm not go inta, inta - see,  just need money
Now, her dad's real wealthy - So why don't you just ask him for the money
Grimsrud, the dour man who has not yet spoken, now softly puts in with a Swedish-accented voice: Or your fucking wife, you know
Or your fucking wife, Jerry
Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know  need it, see
Okay, so there's that
And even if they did,  wouldn't get it
So there's that on top, then
See, these're personal matters
Personal matters
Yah
Personal matters that needn't, uh - Okay, Jerry
You're tasking us to perform this mission, but you, you won't, uh, you won't - aw, fuck it, let's take a look at that Ciera
Jerry enters through the kitchen door, in a parka and a red plaid Elmer Fudd hat
He stamps snow off his feet
He is carrying a bag of groceries which he deposits on the kitchen counter
Hon
Got the growshries
Thank you, hon
How's Fargo
Yah, real good
Dad's here
Jerry enters, pulling off his plaid cap
How ya doin', Wade
Wade Gustafson is mid-sixtyish, vigorous, with a full head of gray hair
His eyes remain fixed on the
Yah, pretty good
Whatcha watchin' there
Norstars
Who they playin'
OOOoooh
His reaction synchronizes with a reaction from the crowd
Jerry walks back in, taking off his coat
His wife is putting on an apron
Jerry nods toward the living room
Is he stayin' for supper, then
Yah,  think so
Dad, are you stayin' for supper
(off) Yah
Jerry, his wife, Wade and Scotty, twelve years old, sit eating
May  be excused
Sure, ya done there
Uh-huh
Goin' out
Where are you going
Just out
Just McDonald's
Back at 9:30
Okay
He just ate
And he didn't finish
He's going to McDonald's instead of finishing here
He sees his friends there
It's okay
It's okay
McDonald's
What do you think they do there
They don't drink milkshakes,  assure you
It's okay, Dad
Wade, have ya had a chance to think about, uh, that deal  was talkin' about, those forty acres there on Wayzata
You told me about it
Yah, you said you'd have a think about it
understand it's a lot of money - heck of a lot
What'd you say you were gonna put there
lot
It's a limited - know it's a lot
mean a parking lot
Yah, well, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot - ha ha ha
Yah, well, it's a chunk, but - thought you were gonna show it to Stan Grossman
He passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice
That's why you pay him
'm asking you here, Wade
This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty - Jean and Scotty never have to worry
black like curls through the white
Twisting perspective shows that it is an aerial shot of a two-lane highway, bordered by snowfields
The highway carries one moving car
Carl Showalter is driving
Gaear Grimsrud stares blankly out
After a long beat: Where is Pancakes Hause
What
We stop at Pancakes Hause
What're you, nuts
We had pancakes for breakfast
gotta go somewhere  can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe
Not more fuckin' pancakes
Come on
Grimsrud gives him a sour look
Come on, man
Okay, here's an idea
We'll stop outside of Brainerd
know a place there we can get laid
Wuddya think
'm fuckin' hungry now, you know
Yeah, yeah, Jesus - 'm sayin', we'll stop for pancakes, then we'll get laid
Wuddya think
Jerry is sitting in his glassed-in salesman's cubicle just off the showroom floor
On the other side of his desk sit an irate customer and his wife
We sat here right in this room and went over this and over this
Yah, but that TruCoat - sat right here and said  didn't want no TruCoat
Yah, but 'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems
It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert - You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles
You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already
Yah, but this TruCoat - We had us a deal here for nine- teen-five
You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, , for nine- teen-five
Okay, 'm not sayin'  didn't - You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it
Ready to make delivery, ya says
Come on down and get it
And here ya are and you're wastin' my time and you're wastin' my wife's time and 'm payin' nineteen-five for this vehicle here
Well, okay, 'll talk to my boss
He rises, and, as he leaves: See, they install that TruCoat at the factory, there's nothin' we can do, but 'll talk to my boss
The couple watch him go to a nearby cubicle
These guys here - these guys
It's always the same
It's always more
He's a liar
Please, dear
We went over this and over this - Jerry sits perched on the desk of another salesman who is eating lunch as he watches a hockey game on a small portable So you're goin' to the Gophers on Sunday
You bet
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there
They're playin' the Buckeyes
Yah
Ya kiddin'
' Jerry re-enters
Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat
One hundred
You lied to me, Mr
Lundegaard
You're a bald-faced liar
Jerry sits staring at his lap
fucking liar - Bucky, please
Jerry mumbles into his lap: One hunnert's the best we can do here
Oh, for Christ's sake, where's my goddamn checkbook
Let's get this over with
: There is a restaurant with many big rigs parked nearby, and a motel with an outsize Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox flanking its sign:
Carl Showalter and Gaear Grimsrud are in the twin beds having sex with two truck-stop hookers
Oh, Jesus, yeah
There ya go, sugar
Nnph
Yeah
Yeah
Oh, yeah
The couples like in their respective beds, gazing at the offscreen
-  Johnny's guests tonight will be Lee Majors, George Wendt, and Steve Boutsikaros from the San Diego Zoo, so keep that dial - We hear a morning show on television
Jean Lundegaard is making coffee in the kitchen as Scott eats cereal at the table
'm talkin' about your potential
(absently) Uh-huh
You're not a  student
Uhn
And yet you're gettin'  grades
It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me
Uh-huh
You know what a disparity is
(testily) Yeah
Okay
Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey
Oh, man
The phone rings
What's the big deal
It's an hour - Hold on
She picks up the phone
Hello
Yah, hiya, hon
Oh, hiya, Dad
Jerry around
Yah, he's still here - 'll catch him for ya
She holds the phone away and calls: Hon
Yah
It's Dad
Yah
Jerry enters in shirtsleeves and tie
Yah, okay
Look, Dad, there is no fucking way - Scott
Say, let's watch the language - He takes the phone
How ya doin', Wade
What's goin' on there
Oh, nothing, Wade
How ya doin' there
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal
Says it's pretty sweet
No kiddin'
We might be innarested
No kiddin'
'd need the cash pretty quick there
In order to close the deal
Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it
If your numbers are right, Stan says its pretty sweet
Stan Grossman
Yah
2:30
Click
Dial tone
Yah, okay
Jerry wanders through the service area where cars are being worked on
He stops by an Indian in blue jeans who is looking at the underside of a car that sits on a hydraulic lift with a cage light hanging off its innards
Say, Shep, how ya doin' there
Mm
Say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in Fargo
Put you in touch with Grimsrud
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there
He, uh - Well,  don't vouch for him
Well, that's okay,  just - vouch for Grimsrud
Who's his buddy
Carl somethin'
Never heard of him
Don't vouch for him
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so 'm not worryin'
just,  was wonderin', see,  gotta get in touch with 'em for,  might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see - Call 'em up
Yah, well, see,  did that, and haven't been able to get 'em, so  thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya
Nope
Jerry slaps his fist into his open palm and snaps his fingers
Okay, well, real good, then
Carl is driving
Grimsrud stares out front
After a beat: Look at that
Twin Cities
Building, the big glass one
Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest
After the Sears, uh, Chicago
You never been to Minneapolis
No
Would it kill you to say something
did
"No
" First thing you've said in the last four hours
That's a, that's a fountain of conversation, man
That's a geyser
mean, whoa, daddy, stand back, man
Shit, 'm sittin' here driving, man, doin' all the driving, whole fuckin' way from Brainerd, drivin', tryin' to, you know, tryin' to chat, keep our spirits up, fight the boredom of the road, and you can't say one fucking thing just in the way of conversation
Grimsurd smokes, gazing out the window
Well, fuck it,  don't have to talk either, man
See how you like it
He drives
Total silence
' He is on the phone
Yah, real good
How you doin'
Pretty good, Mr
Lundegaard
You're damned hard to get on the phone
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it
That's for sure
Now,  just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us,  can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so  - But  already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place,  already got the, the what, the - Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month
Yah, so we're all set
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on,  just can't read the serial numbers on your applicaton
Maybe if you could just read them to me - But the deal's already done, already got the money - Yeah, but we have an audit here, just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist
Yah, well, they exist all right
'm sure they do - ha ha
But can't read their serial numbers here
So if you could read me - Well, but see,  don't have 'em in front a me - why don't  just fax you over a copy - No, fax is no good, that's what have and  can't read the darn thing - Yah, okay, 'll have my girl send you over a copy, then
Okay, because if  can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then  gotta call back that money - Yah, how much money was that
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars
See,  gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on
Yah, no problem, 'll just fax that over to ya, then
No, no, fax is - mean send it over
'll shoot it right over to ya
Okay
Okay, real good, then
morning-show host in an apron stands behind a counter on a kitchen set
So  seperate the - how the heck do  get the egg out of the shell without breaking it
Jean Lundegaard is curled up on the couch with a cup of coffee, watching the television
You just prick a little hole in the end and blow
Jean smiles as we hear laughter and applause from the studio audience
She hears something else - a faint scraping sound - and looks up
Okay, here goes nothing
The scraping sound persists
Jean sets down her coffee cup and rises
From the studio audience: Awoooo
We track toward the back door
curtain is stretched tight across its window
Jean pulls the curtain back
Bright sunlight amplified by snow floods in
man in an orange ski mask looks up from the lock
Jean gasps, drops the curtain, rutns and runs into - - a taller man, also in a ski mask, already in the house
We hear the crack of the back-door window being smashed
The tall man - Gaear Grimsrud - grabs Jean's wrist
She screams, staring at her own imprisoned wrist, then wraps her gaping mouth around Grimsrud's gloved thumb and bites down hard
He drops her wrist
As Carl enters, she races up the stairs
Unguent
Huh
Grimsurd looks at his thumb
need
unguent
As the two men enter, a door at the far side is slamming shut
cord snakes in under the door
Jean, sobbing, frantically pushes at buttons on the princess phone
The phone pops out of her hands, jangles across the tile floor, smashes against the door and then bounces away, its cord ripped free
With a groaning sound, the door shifts in its frame
Grimsrud has a crowbar jammed in between the bathroom door and frame, and is working it
Jean crosses to a high window above the toilet and throws it open
Snow that had drifted against the window sifts lightly in
Jean steps up onto the toilet
The door creaks, moving as one piece in its frame
Jean glances back as she steps up from the toilet seat to the tank
The groaning of the door ends with the wood around its knob splintering and the knob itself falling out onto the floor
The door swings open
Grimsrud and Carl enter
Room empty, window open
Carl strides to the window and hoists himself out
Grimsrud opens the medicine cabinet and delicately taps aside various bottles and tubes, seeking the proper unguent
He finds a salve but after a moment sets it down, noticing something in the mirror
The shower curtain is drawn around the tub
He steps toward it
As he reaches for the curtain, it explodes outward, animated by thrashing limbs
Jean, screaming, tangled in the curtain, rips it off its rings and stumbles out into the bedroom
Grimsrud follows
Jean rushes toward the door, cloaked by the shower curtain but awkwardly trying to push it off
Still thrashing, Jean crashes against the upstairs railing, trips on the curtain and falls, thumping crazily down the stairs
Grimsrud trots down after her
: ' Wade sits behind his desk; another man rises as Jerry enters
How ya doin' there, Stan
How are ya, Wade
Stan Grossman shakes his hand
Good to see ya again, Jerry
If these numbers are right, this looks pretty sweet
Oh, those numbers are all right, bleemee
This is do-able
Congratulations, Jerry
Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty - What kind of finder's fee were you looking for
Huh
The financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee
My fee
Wade, what the heck're you talkin' about
Stan and 're okay
Yah
We're good to loan in
Yah
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us
No, but, Wade, see,  was bringin' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in
It's my deal here, see
Wade scowls, looks at Stan
Jerry - we thought you were bringin' us an investment
Yah, right - You're sayin' - what're you sayin'
You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off
No, no
- 'd, 'd - pay you back the principal, and interest - heck, 'd go - one over prime - We're not a bank, Jerry
Wade is angry
What the heck, Jerry, if  wanted bank interest on seven hunnert'n fifty thousand 'd go to Midwest Federal
Talk to Bill Diehl
He's at Norstar
He's at - No, see,  don't need a finder's fee,  need - finder's fee's, what, ten percent, heck that's not gonna do it for me
need the principal
Jerry, we're not just going to give you seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars
What the heck were you thinkin'
Heck, if 'm only gettin' bank interest, 'd look for complete security
Heck,
don't see nothin' like that here
Yah, but  - okay,  would, 'd guarantee ya your money back
'm not talkin' about your damn word, Jerry
Geez, what the heck're you
Well, look, don't want to cut you out of the loop, but his here's a good deal
assume, if you're not innarested, you won't mind if we move on it independently
We are high and wide on the office building's parking lot
Jerry emerges wrapped in a parka, his arms sticking stiffly out at his sides, his breath vaporizing
He goes to his car, opens its front door, pulls out a red plastic scraper and starts methodically scraping off the thin crust of ice that has developed on his windshield
The scrape-scrape-scrape sound carries in the frigid air
Jerry goes into a frenzy, banging the scraper against the windshield and the hood of his car
The tantrum passes
Jerry stands pantin, staring at nothing in particular
Scrape-scrape-scrape - he goes back to work on the windshield
beat, silent but for a key scraping at the lock
The door swings open and Jerry edges in, looking about, holding a sack of groceries
Hon
He shuts the door
Got the growshries
He has already seen the shower curtain on the floor
He frowns, pokes at it with his foot
Hon
Jerry walks in
He sets the groceries down on the toilet tank
He looks at the open window, through which snow still sifts in
He shuts it
He picks up the small tube of uguent that sits on the sink, frowns at it, puts it back in the medicine chest
He looks at the shower curtain rod holding empty rings
Once again we are looking at the rumpled shower curtain
From another room: Yah, Wade,  - it's Jerry,
Then, slightly more agitated
Yah, Wade, it's, , it's Jerry
Beat
Wade, it's Jerry,  - we gotta talk, Wade, it's terrible
Beat
Jerry stands in wide shot, hands on hips, looking down at a telephone
After a motionless beat he picks up the phone and punches in a number
Yah, Wade Gustafson, please
Hold in black
slow tilt down from night sky brings the head of a large paper-mache figure into frame
It is a flannel-shirt woodsman carrying a double-edged ax over one shoulder
As we hear the rumble of an approaching car, the continuing tilt and boom down brings us down the woodsman's body to a pedestal
sweep of headlights illuminates a sign on the pedestal: -
The headlights sweep off and a car hums past and on into the background
The two-lane highway is otherwise empty
Carl drives
Grimsrud smokes and gazes out the window
From the back seat we hear whimpering
Grimsrud turns to look
Jean lies bound and curled on the back seat underneath a tarpaulin
Shut the fuck up or 'll throw you back in the trunk, you know
Geez
That's more'n 've heard you say all week
Grimsrud stares at him, then turns back to the window
At a loud  Carl starts and looks back out the rear window
Fifty yards behind a state trooper has turned on his gumballs
Carl eases the car onto the shoulder
Ah, shit, the tags
Grimsrud looks at him
It's just the tags
never put my tags on the car
Don't worry, 'll take care of this
He looks into the back seat as the car bounces and slows on the gravel shoulder
Let's keep still back there, lady, or we're gonna have to, ya know, to shoot ya
Grimsrud stares at Carl
Hey
'll take care of this
Both cars have stopped
Carl looks up at the rear-view mirror
The trooper is stopped on the shoulder just behind them, writing in his citation book
Carl watches
We hear the trooper's door open
The trooper walks up the shoulder, one hand resting lightly on top of his holster, his breath steaming in the cold night air
Carl opens his window as the trooper draws up
How can  help you, officer
The trooper scans the inside of the car, taking his time
Grimsrud smokes and gazes calmly out his window
Finally: This is a new car, then, sir
It certainly is, officer
Still got that smell
You're required to display temporary tags, either in the plate area or taped inside the back window
Certainly - Can  see your license and registration please
Certainly
He reaches for his wallet
was gonna tape up the temporary tag, ya know, to be in full compliance, but it, uh, it, uh
must a slipped my mind
He extends his wallet toward the trooper, a folded fifty- dollar bill protruding from it
So maybe the best thing would be to take care of that, right here in Brainerd
What's this, sir
That's my license and regis- tration
wanna be in compliance
He forces a laugh
was just thinking  could take care of it right here
In Brainerd
The policeman thoughtfully pats the fifty into the billfold and hands the billfold back into the car
Put that back in your pocket, please
Carl's nervous smile fades
And step out of the car, please, sir
Grimsrud, smiling thinly, shakes his head
There is a whimpering sound
The policeman hesitates
Another sound
The policeman leans forward into the car, listening
Grimsrud reaches across Carl, grabs the trooper by the hair and slams his head down onto the car door
The policeman grunts, digs awkwardly for footing outside and throws an arm for balance against the outside of the car
With his free hand, Grimsrud pops the glove compartment
He brings a gun out and reaches across Carl and shoots -  - into the back of the trooper's head
Jean screams
Shut up
He releases the policeman
The policeman's head slides out the window and his body flops back onto the street
Carl looks out at the cop in the road
(softly) Whoa
Whoa, Daddy
Grimsrud takes the trooper's hat off of Carl's lap and sails it out the open window
You'll take care of it
Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know
Whoa, Daddy
Jean, for some reason, screams again
Then stops
Clear him off the road
Yeah
He gets out
Carl leans down to hoist up the body
Headlights appear:  an oncoming car
Grimsrud notices
The car approaches, slowing
Carl, with the trooper's body hoisted halfway up, is frozen in the headlights
The car accelerates and roars past and away
We just make out the silhouettes of two occupants in front
Grimsrud slides into the driver's seat
He squeals into a - turn, the driver's door slamming shut with his spin
Small red tail lights fishtail up ahead
The pursued car churns up fine snow
Grimsrud takes the cigarette from his mouth and stubs it in his ashtray
We hear the churning of the car wheels and the pinging of snow clods and salt on the car's underside
In the back seat, Jean starts screaming
Grimsrud is not gaining on the tail lights
He fights with the wheel as his car swims on the road face
The red tail lights ahead start to turn
With a distant crunching sound, they disappear
The headlights now show only empty road, starting to turn
Grimsrud frowns and slows
His headlights show the car up ahead off the road, crumpled around a telephone pole, having failed to hold a turn
Grimsrud brakes
Jean slides off the back seat and thumps into the legwell
Grimsrud sweeps his gun off the front seat, throws open his door and gets out
The wrecked car's headlights shine off into a snowfield abutting the highway
young man in a down parka is limping across the snowfield, away from the wrecked car
Grimsrud strides calmly out after the injured boy
He raises his gun and fires
With a poof of feathers, a hole opens up in the boy's back and he pitches into the snow
Grimsrud walks up to the wreck and peers in its half-open door
young woman is trapped inside the twisted wreckage, injured
Snow swirls in the headlights of the wreck
Grimsrud raises his gun and fires
blue-winged teal in flight over a swampy marshland
The room in which it hangs is dark
We hear off-screen snoring
We track off to reveal an easel upon which we see a half- completed oil of a grey mallard
The continuing track reveals a couple in bed, sleeping
The man, fortyish, pajama-clad, is big, and big-bellied
His mouth is agape
He snores
His arms are flung over a woman in her thirties, wearing a nightie, mouth also open, not snoring
We hold for a long beat on their regular breathing and snoring
The phone rings
The woman stirs
Oh, geez
She reaches for the phone
Hi, it's Marge
The man stirs and clears his throat with a long deep rumble
Oh, my
Where
Yah
Oh, geez
The man sits up, gazes stupidly about
Okay
There in a jif
Real good, then
She hangs up
You can sleep, hon
It's early yet
Gotta go
Yah
The man swings his legs out
'll fix ya some eggs
That's okay, hon
gotta run
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge
'll fix ya some eggs
Aw, you can sleep, hon
Ya gotta eat a breakfast
He clears his throat with another deep rumble
'll fix ya some eggs
Aw, Norm
Leavings of a huge plate of eggs, ham, toast
Wider, we see Marge now wearing a beige police uniform patch on one arm says
She wears a heavy belt holding a revolver, walkie-talkie and various other jangling police impedimenta
Norm is in a dressing gown
Thanks, hon
Time to shove off
Love ya, Margie
As she struggles into a parka: Love ya, hon
He is exiting back to the bedroom; she exits out the front door
Dawn
Marge is making her way down the icy front stoop to her prowler
Norm sits back onto the bed, shrugging off his robe
Off- screen we hear the front door open
Marge stamps the snow off her shoes
Hon
(off) Yah
Prowler needs a jump
Two police cars and an ambulance sit idling at the side of the road, a pair of men inside each car
The first car's driver door opens and a figure in a parka emerges, holding two styrofoam cups
His partner leans across the seat to close the door after him
The reverse shows Marge approaching from her own squad car
Hiya, Lou
Margie
Thought you might need a little warm-up
He hands her one of the cups of coffee
Yah, thanks a bunch
So what's the deal, now
Gary says triple homicide
Yah, looks pretty bad
Two of'm're over here
Marge looks around as they start walking
Where is everybody
Well - it's cold, Margie
Laid out in the early morning light is the wrecked car, a pair of footprints leading out to a man in a bright orange parka face down in the bloodstained snow, and one pair of footsteps leading back to the road
Marge is peering into the car
Ah, geez
So
Aw, geez
Here's the second one
It's in the head and the
hand there,  guess that's a defensive wound
Okay
Marge looks up from the car
Where's the state trooper
Lou, up on the shoulder, jerks his thumb
Back there a good piece
In the ditch next to his prowler
Marge looks around at the road
Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal
Yah
'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd
Yah
Marge is studying the ground
Yah
And 'll tell you what, from his footprints he looks like a big fella - Marge suddenly doubles over, putting her head between her knees down near the snow
Ya see something down there, Chief
Uh -  just,  think 'm gonna barf
Geez, you okay, Margie
'm fine - it's just morning sickness
She gets up, sweeping snow from her knees
Well, that passed
Yah
Yah
Now 'm hungry again
You had breakfast yet, Margie
Oh, yah
Norm made some eggs
Yah
Well, what now, d'ya think
Let's go take a look at that trooper
' Marge's prowler is parked nearby
Marge is on her hands and knees by a body down in the ditch, again looking at footprints in the snow
She calls up to the road: There's two of 'em, Lou
Yah
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy
Oh, yah
In the foreground is the head of the state trooper, facing us
Peering at it from behind, still on her hands and knees, is Marge
For Pete's sake
She gets up, clapping the snow off her hands, and climbs out of the ditch
How's it look, Marge
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy
It's a real shame
Yah
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya
No way
She is looking at the prowler, which still idles on the shoulder
Somebody shut his lights
guess the little guy sat in there, waitin' for his buddy t'come back
Yah, woulda been cold out here
Heck, yah
Ya think, is Dave open yet
You don't think he's mixed up in - No, no,  just wanna get Norm some night crawlers
Marge is driving; Lou sits next to her
You look in his citation book
Yah
He looks at his notebook
Last vehicle he wrote in was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a
m
Under the plate number he put -  figure they stopped him or shot him before he could finish fillin' out the tag number
Uh-huh
So  got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin'
They don't got no match yet
'm not sure  agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou
Yah
Yah,  think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates
Oh
Lou gazes out the window, thinking
Geez
Yah
Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685
Yah, that's a good one
Yah
The police car enters with a whoosh and hums down a straight- ruled empty highway, cutting a landscape of flat and perfect white
Jerry, Wade, and Stan Grossman sit in a booth, sipping coffee
Outside the window, snow falls from a gunmetal sky
-  All's  know is, ya got a problem, ya call a professional
No
They said no cops
They were darned clear on that, Wade
They said you call the cops and we - Well, a course they're gonna say that
But where's my protection
They got Jean here
give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go
Well, they - million dollars is a lot a damn money
And there they are, they got my daughter
Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade
Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go
You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade
Heck, you don't know
You're just whistlin' Dixie here
'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this
'm sayin' call a professional
No
No cops
That's final
This is my deal here, Wade
Jean is my wife here
gotta tell ya, Wade, 'm leanin' to Jerry's viewpoint here
Well - We gotta protect Jean
These - we're not holdin' any cards here, Wade, they got all of 'em
So they call the shots
You're darned tootin'
Ah, dammit
'm tellin' ya
Well
Why don't we
He saws a finger under his nose
Stan, 'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million
Now come on here, no way, Wade
No way
We're not horse-trading here, Wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing
Yah
What's the next step here, Jerry
They're gonna call, give me instructions for a drop
'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow
Dammit
She rings up two dollars forty
How was everything today
Yah, real good now
Snow continues to fall
Jerry and Stan stand bundled in their parkas and galoshes near a row of beached vehicles
Wade sits behind the wheel of an idling Lincoln, waiting for Stan
Okay
We'll get the money together
Don't worry about it, Jerry
Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call
No,  - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear
Yah
Jerry pounds his mittened hands together against the cold
Ya know, they said no one listenin' in, they'll be watchin', ya know
Maybe it's all bull, but like you said, Stan, they're callin' the shots
Okay
And Scotty, is he gonna be all right
Yah, geez, Scotty
'll go talk to him
There is a tap at the horn from Wade, and Stan gets into the Lincoln
We'll call
The Lincoln spits snow as it grinds out of the lot and fishtails out onto the boulevard
' Scotty lies on the bed, weeping
Jerry enters and perches uncomfortably on the edge of his bed
How ya doin' there, Scotty
Dad
What're they doing
Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom
It's okay, Scotty
They're not gonna want to hurt her any
These men, they just want money, see
What if - what if sumpn goes wrong
No, no, nothin's goin' wrong here
Grandad and , we're - we're makin' sure this gets handled right
Scott snorfles and sits up
Dad,  really think we should call the cops
No
We can't let anyone know about this thing
We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing
Yeah, but - We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but we gotta play ball
Ya know, that's the deal
Now if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in Florida with Pearl and Marty
Scotty starts to weep again
Jerry stares down at his lap
That's the best we can do here
It is a lakeside cabin surrounded by white
brown Ciera with dealer plates is pulling into the drive
Grimsrud climbs out of the passenger seat as Carl climbs out of the driver's
Grimsrud opens the back door and, with an arm on her elbow, helps Jean out
She has her hands tied behind her and a black hood over her head
With a cry, she swings her elbow out of Grimsrud's grasp and lurches away across the front lawn
Grimsrud moves to retrieve her but Carl, grinning, lays a hand on his shoulder
Hold it
They both look out at the front lawn, Grimsrud expressionless, Carl smiling
With muffled cries, the hooded woman lurches across the unbroken snow, staggering this way and that, stumbling on the uneven terrain
She stops, stands still, her hooded head swaying
She lurches out in an arbitrary direction
Going downhill, she reels, staggers, and falls face-first into the snow, weeping
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
Jesus
Grimsrud, still expressionless, breaks away from Carl's restraining hand to retrieve her
We track behind Marge as she makes her way across the floor, greeting various officers
She holds a small half-full paper sack
Beyond her we see a small glassed-in cublcle
Norm sits at the desk inside with a box lunch spread out in front of him
There is lettering on the cubicle's glass door: Marge enters and sits behind the desk, detaching her walkie- talkie from her utility belt to accomodate the seat
Hiya, hon
She slides the paper sack toward him
Brought ya some lunch, Margie
What're those, night crawlers
He looks inside
The bottom of the sack is full of fat, crawling earthworms
Yah
Thanks, hon
You bet
Thanks for lunch
What do we got here, Arbie's
Uh-huh
She starts eating
How's the paintin' goin'
Pretty good
Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year
Aw, hon, you're better'n them
They're real good
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them
Yah, ya think
He leans over and kisses her
Ah, ya got Arbie's all o'er me
Lou enters
Hiya, Norm, how's the paintin' goin'
Not too bad
You know
How we doin' on that vehicle
No motels registered any tan Ciera last night
But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank
Geez, that's a good lead
The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on -35
Yah
Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company
Oh, yah
Marge's prowler is parked in an otherwise empty lot
Snow drifts down
Marge sits talking with two young women at one end of an elevated dance platform
The club, not yet open for business, is deserted
Where you girls from
Chaska
LeSeure
But  went to high school in White Bear Lake
Okay,  want you to tell me what these fellas looked like
Well, the little guy, he was kinda funny-looking
In what way
dunno
Just funny-looking
Can you be any more specific
couldn't really say
He wasn't circumcised
Was he funny-looking apart from that
Yah
So you were having sex with the little fella, then
Uh-huh
Is there anything else you can tell me about him
No
Like  say, he was funny-looking
More'n most people even
And what about the other fella
He was a little older
Looked like the Marlboro man
Yah
Yah
Maybe 'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros
Uh-huh
subconscious-type thing
Yah, that can happen
Yah
They said they were goin' to the Twin Cities
Oh, yah
Yah
Yah
Is that useful to ya
Oh, you bet, yah
It is now dusk
The brown Ciera with dealer plates still sits in the drive
We track in on Jean Lundegaard, who sits tied in a chair with the black hood still over her head
As we track in, we hear inarticulate cursing, intermittent banging and loud static
We track in on Gaear Grimsrud, who sits smoking a cigarette and expressionlessly gazing offscreen
We track in on Carl Showalter, who stands over an old black- and-white television
It plays nothing but snow
Carl is banging on it as he mutters: days
be here for days with a -
- a goddamn mute
nothin' to do
and the fucking - Each "dammit" brings a pound of his fist on the
doesn't even
plug me in, man
Gimmee a -
- signal
Plug me into the ozone, baby
Plug me into the ozone -
With one last bang we cut: In extreme close-up an insect is lugging a worm
- The bark beetle carries the worm to the nest
where it will feed its young for up to six weeks
pull back from the screen reveals that we are in Marge's house
Marge and Norm are watching television in bed
From the we hear insects chirring
After a long beat, silence except for the , Marge murmurs, still looking at the set: Well, 'm turnin' in, Norm
Also looking at the : Oh, yah
Marge rolls over and Norm continues to watch
We hold
Hold
snowflake drops through the black
Another flake
It starts snowing
The lone traffic light blinks slowly, steadily, red
Snow sifts down
There is no other movement
We are looking up at the bottom-lit statue
Snow falls
' Snow drops away
' The bedroom is dark
Norm is snoring
The phone rings
Marge gropes in the dark
Hello
Yah, is this Marge
Yah
Margie Olmstead
Well, yah
Who's this
This is Mike Yanagita
Ya know - Mike Yanagita
Remember me
Mike Yanagita

Marge props herself up next to the still-sleeping Norm

Jerry Lundegaard
All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself

Jerry sits dumbly
The voice solemnly repeats: Blood has been shed
What the heck d'ya mean
Three people
In Brainerd
Oh, geez

And we need more money
The heck d'ya mean
What a you guys got yourself mixed up in

You ask those three pour souls up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal
Go ahead, ask 'em

Click
Jerry slams down the phone, which immediately rings
He angrily snatches it up
Yah
Jerome Lundegaard
Yah
This is Reilly Deifenbach at
Sir,  have not yet recieved those vehicle IDs you promised me
Yah
those are in the mail
Mr
Lundegaard, that very well may be
must inform you, however, that absent the reciept of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, will have to refer this matter to our legal department
Yah
My patience is at an end
Yah
Good day, sir
Yah
We are looking at Jerry's cubicle from across the showroom
Noise muted by distance, we watch Jerry slam down the reciever, rise to his feet, fling the phone to the floor, raise his desk blotter high over his head with pens and pencils rolling off it and slam it onto his desktop
He stands for a moment, hands on hips, glaring
He stoops and picks up the phone, places it back on the desktop, starts picking up the pens and pencils
On steam-table bins of food, each identified by a plaque: ,  ,  , complementary track shows two rays being pushed along a buffet line, piled high with many foods
They sit next to each other at a long cafateria-style Formica table, silently eating
hip with a hissing walkie-talkie enters frame
Hiya, Norm
How ya doin', Margie
How's the fricasse
Pretty darn good, ya want some
No,  gotta - hey, Norm,  thought you were goin' fishin' up at Mile Lacs
Yah, after lunch
He goes back to his food
Whatcha got there
Gary hands her a flimsy
Marge takes it with one hand and looks, her other hand frozen with a forkful of food
The numbers y'asked for, calls made from the lobby pay phone at the Blue Ox
Two to Minneapolis that night
Mm
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence
Shep Proudfoot
Uh-huh
what
Shep Proudfoot
That's a name
Uh-huh
Yah
Yah, okay,  think 'll drive down there, then
Oh, yah
Twin Cities
Norm, who has been eating steadily throughout, looks over at Marge with mild interest
He stares for a beat as he finishes chewing, and them swallows and says: Oh, yah
Jerry, Wade, and Stan Grossman sit around the kitchen table
It is night
The scene is harshly toplit by a hanging fixture
On the table are the remains of coffee and a cinammon filbert ring
Dammit
wanna be a part a this thing
No, Wade
They were real clear
They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone
It's my money, 'll deliver it - what do they care
Wade's got a point there
'll handle the call if you want, Jerry
No, no
See - they, no, see, they only deal with me
Ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they're very - these guys're dangerous - All the more reason
don't want you - with all due respect, Jerry -  don't want you mucking this up
The heck d'ya mean
They want my money, they can deal with me
Otherwise 'm goin' to a professional
He points at a briefcase
There's a million dollars here
No, see - Look, Jerry, you're not sellin' me a damn car
It's my show here
That's that
It's the way we prefer to handle it, Jerry
Marge is at the reception desk
How ya doin'
Real good
How're you today, ma'am
Real good
'm Mrs
Gunderson, have a reservation
The clerk types into a computer console
You sure do, Mrs
Gunderson
Is there a phone down here, ya think
Marge is on a public phone
Detective Sibert
Yah, this is Marge Gunderson from up Brainerd, we spoke -  Yah
Well, actually 'm in town here

Oh, yah
Well, maybe 'll go visit with him if  have the
No, can find that
Well, thanks a bunch
Say, d'ya happen to know a good place for lunch in the downtown area
Yah, the Radisson
Oh, yah
Is it reasonable
Through a windshield we see a sign for the The brown Ciera enters and drives lazy -curves around the few snow-covered cars parked on the roof of the lot
It stops by one car and Carl emerges
He quickly scans the lot, then kneels in the snow at the back of the parked car and starts unscrewing its license plate
Carl pulls up and hands the attendant his ticket
Yeah,  decided not to park here
The attendant frowns uncomprehendingly at the ticket
What do you mean, you decided not to park here
Yeah,  just came in
decided not to park here
The attendant is still puzzled
You, uh
'm sorry, sir, but - decided not to - 'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out
'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars
just pulled in here
just fucking pulled in here
Well, see, there's a minimum charge of four dollars
Long-term parking charges by the day
car behind beeps
Carl glances back, starts digging for money
guess you think, ya know, you're an authority figure
With that stupid fucking uniform
Huh, buddy
The attendant doesn't say anything
King Clip-on Tie here
Big fucking man
He is peeling off one dollar bills
You know, these are the limits of your life, man
Ruler of your little fucking gate here
There's your four dollars
You pathetic piece of shit
Jerry is staring up, mouth agape, at the underside of a car on a hydraulic lift
Bewildered, he looks about, then asks a mechanic passing by, his voice raised over the din of the shop
Where's Shep
The mechanic points
Talkin' to a cop
Jerry looks
Cop
Marge and Shep face each other at the other end of the floor in a grimy and cluttered glassed-in cubicle
Said she was a policewoman
Marge and Shep silently talk
Jerry stares, swallows
- Wednesday night
Shep is shaking his head
Nope
Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace
Yep
Anyone else residing there
Nope
Well, Mr
Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning
It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling
Shep says nothing
Now,  know you've had some problems, struggling with the narcotics, some other entanglements, currently on parole - So
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater
Uh-huh
Now,  saw some rough stuff on your priors, but nothing in the nature of a homicide
Shep stares at her
know you don't want to be an accessory to something like that
Nope
So you think you might remember who those folks were who called ya
' Jerry is worriedly pacing behind his desk
At a noise he looks up
Marge has stuck her head in the door
Mr
Lundegaard
Huh
Yah
wonder if  could take just a minute of your time here - What
What is it all about
Huh
Do you mind if  sit down - 'm carrying quite a load here
Marge plops into the chair opposite him
You're the owner here, Mr
Lundegaard
Naw,
Executive Sales Manager
Well, you can help me
My name's Marge Gunderson - My father-in-law, he's the owner
Uh-huh
Well, 'm a police officer from up Brainerd investigating some malfeasance and  was just wondering if you've had any new vehicles stolen off the lot in the past couple of weeks - specifically a tan Cutlass Ciera
Jerry stares at her, his mouth open
Mr
Lundegaard
Brainerd
Yah
Yah
Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox
Babe the Blue Ox
Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there
So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then
No
No, ma'am
Okey-dokey, thanks a bunch
'll let you get back to your paperwork, then
As Marge rises, Jerry looks blankly down at the papers on the desk in front of him
Yah, okay
He looks up at Marge's retreating back
He looks back down at the papers
He looks over at the phone
he picks up the phone and dials four digits
Yah, gimmee Shep
The heck d'ya mean
Well, where'd he go
It's only
No,  don't need a mechanic - oh, geez - gotta talk to a friend of his, so, uh
have him, uh
oh, geez
Marge enters
She looks around the bar, a rather characterless, lowlit meeting place for business people
Marge
It is a bald, paunching man of about Marge's age, rising from a booth halfway back
His features are broad, friendly, Asian-American
Mike
He approaches somewhat carefully, as if on his second drink
They hug and head back toward the booth
Geez
You look great
Yah - easy there - you do too
'm expecting, ya know
see that
That's great
waitress meets them at the table
What can  get ya
Just a Diet Coke
Again she glances about

It's okay, Mike
Carl Showalter is sitting at a small table with a tarty- looking blonde in a low-cut gown
Each holds a drink
Just in town on business
Just in and out
Ha ha
little of the old in-and-out
Wuddya do
Carl looks around
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before
With other, uh, clients
don't think so
It's nice
Yeah, well, it depends on the artist
You know, Jose Feliciano, ya got no complaints
Waiter
The reverse shows a disappearing waiter and the backs of many, many people sitting at tables between us and the very distant stage
Jose Feliciano, very small, performs on a spotlit stool
The acoustics are poor
Carl grimaces
What is he, deaf
So, uh, how long have you been with the escort service
don't know
Few munce
Ya find the work interesting, do ya
What're you talking about
Carl is humping the escort
We hear the door burst open
The escort is grabbed and flung out of bed
Shep
What the hell are you doing
'm banging that girl
Shep
Jesus Ch - Shep slaps him hard, forehand, backhand
Fuck out of my house
He hauls him up - Shep
Don't you dare fucking hit me, man
Don't you - - punches him and flings him away
Carl hits a sofa and we see his bare legs disappear as he flips back over it
Shep enters frame to circle the sofa and kick at Carl behind it
Fuck outta here
Put me back in Stillwater
Little fucking shit
There is a knock at the door
Hey
Come on in there
Shep strides to the door, flings it open
man in boxer shorts stands in the doorway
'mon, brother, it's late -  Unghh
Shep hits him twice, then grabs both of his ears and starts banging his head against the wall
The hooker runs by, clutching her clothes, and Shep kicks her in the ass as she passes
He spins and goes back into the apartment
Carl is hopping desperately into his pants
Stay away from me, man
Hey
Smoke a fuckin' peace pipe, man
Don't you dare fuckin' -  Unghh
After hitting him several times, Shep yanks Carl's belt out of his dangling pants and strangles him with it
Carl gurgles
Shep knees Carl repeatedly, then dumps him onto the floor and starts whipping him with the buckle end of the belt
Carl listens to the phone ring at the other end
His face is deeply bruised and cut
Finally, through the phone
Yah
All right, Jerry, 'm through fucking around
You got the fucking money
' Jerry is at the kitchen phone
Through the door to the dining room we see Wade picking up an extension
Yah,  got the money, but, uh - Don't you fucking but me, Jerry
want you with this money on the Dayton-Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up
Yah, okay, but, uh - You're there in thirty minutes or find you, Jerry, and  shoot you, and  shoot your fucking wife, and  shoot all your little fucking children, and  shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads
Got it
Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now - Okay, real good, then
The line goes dead
door slams offscreen
Wade, briefcase in hand, gets into his Cadillac, slams the door and peels out
Wade's jaw works as he glares out at traffic
He mumbles to himself as he drives
Okay
here's your damn money, now where's my daughter
Goddamn punk
where's my damn daughter
He pulls out a gun, cracks the barrel, peers in
You little punk
' Jerry sits in the foyer, trying to pull on pair of galoshes
Scotty's voice comes from upstairs: Dad
It's okay, Scotty
Where're you going
Be back in a minute
If Stan calls you, just tell him  went to Embers
Oh, geez - Thunk
- his first boot goes on
Marge sits on the bed in her hotel room, shoes off, massaging her feet
The phone is pressed to her ear, and through it, we hear ringing
Hello
Norm
It is late evening, blowing storm
leisurely pan across the bleak gray expanse finds a little hut in the middle of the frozen lake with a pickup truck parked next to it
' They bitin'
Norm has a cellular phone to his ear
His feet are stretched out to an electric heater
The interior is bathed in soft orange light
Yah, okay
How's the hotel
Oh, pretty good
They bitin'
Yeah, couple a muskies
No pike yet
How d'you feel
Oh, fine
Not on your feet too much
No, no
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too
How's the food down there
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table
Buffet style
It was pretty darn good
Was it reasonable
Yah, not too bad
So it's nice up there
Yah, it's good
No pike yet, but it's good
- The top, open, level
Snow blows
car sits idling
Another car pulls onto the roof
It creeps over to the parked car and stops
It continues to idle as its door opens and Wade steps out, carrying the briefcase
The door of the other car bangs open and Carl bounces out
Who the fuck are you
Who the fuck are you
got your goddamn money, you little punk
Now where's my daughter
am through fucking around
Drop that fucking briefcase
Where's my daughter
Fuck you, man
Where's Jerry gave    - Where's my damn daughter
No Jean, no money
Drop that fucking money
No Jean, no money
Is this a fucking joke here
He pulls out a gun and fires into Wade's gut
Is this a fucking joke
Unghh
oh, geez
He is on the pavement, clutching at his gut
Snow swirls
You fucking imbeciles
He bends down next to Wade to pick up the briefcase
Oh, for Christ
oh, geez
Wade brings out his gun and fires at Carl's head, close by
Oh
Carl stumbles and falls back, and then stands up again
His jaw is gouting blood
Owwmm
One hand pressed to his jaw, he fires down at Wade several times
Blood streams through the hand pressed to his jaw
Mmmmmphnck
He fnkem shop me
He pockets the gun, picks up the briefcase one-handed, flings it into his car, gets in, peels out
Carl screams down the ramp
He takes a corner at high speed and swerves, just missing Jerry in his Olds on his way to the top
' Jerry recovers from the near miss and continues up
Oh, geez
Carl squeals to a halt at the gate, still pressing his hand to his bleeding jaw
Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe
May  have your ticket, please
Jerry pulls to a halt next to Wade's idling Cadillac
He gets out and walks slowly to Wade's body, prostrate in the swirling snow
Oh
Oh, geez
He bends down, picks Wade up by the armpits and drags him over to the back of the Cadillac
He drops Wade's body, walks to the driver's side of the car, pulls the keys and walks back to pop the trunk
He wrestles Wade's body into the trunk, slams it shut and walks back to the scene of the shooting
He kicks at the snow with his galoshed feet, trying to hide the fresh bloodstains
Jerry approaches in the Cadillac
The wooden gate barring the exit has been broken away
The booth is empty
Jerry eases toward the street, looking over at the booth as he passes
Inside the booth we see the awkwardly angled leg of a prostrate body
' The car pulls into the driveway
Jerry enters and sits on the foyer chair to take off his galoshes
' Dad
Yah
' Stan Grossman called
Yah, okay
' Twice
Okay
' Is everything okay
Yah
Thoonk - the first boot comes off
' Are you calling Stan
Well
'm goin' ta bed now
' Carl mumbles as he drives, underlit by the dim dash lights, one hand now holding a piece of rag to his shredded jaw
Fnnkn ashlzh
Fnk
Carl's car roars into frame, violently swirling the snow
Its red tail lights fishtail away
:   - It is a starky sunny day
We are cruising down a street of humble lookalike houses
We pan right as we draw toward one house in particular
In its driveway a man in a hooded parka shovels snow
He notices the approaching car and gives its driver a wave
The driver is Gary, the Brainderd police officer
He gives a finger-to-the-head salute and pulls over
Gary slams his door shut and the other man plants his shovel in the snow
How ya doin'
Mr
Mohra
Yah
Officer Olson
Yah, right-o
The two men caucus the driveway without shaking hands and without standing particularly close
They stand stiffly, arms down at their sides and breath streaming out of their parka hoods
Each has an awkward leaning-away posture, head drawn slightly back and chin tucked in, to keep his face from protruding into the cold
So, 'm tendin' bar there at Ecklund && Swedlin's last Tuesday and this little guy's drinkin' and he says, 'So where can a guy find some action - 'm goin' crazy down there at the lake
'  And says, 'What kinda action
' and he says, 'Woman action, what do look like,'  And  says 'Well, what do  look like,  don't arrange that kinda thing,' and he says, ''m goin' crazy out there at the lake' and  says, 'Well, this ain't that kinda place
' Uh-huh
So he says, 'So  get it, so you think 'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk
unnerstand
And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now
So don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that
'  So says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then
' Ya got that right
And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and  don't mean a old age
'  And then he says, 'Geez, 'm goin' crazy out there at the lake
' White Bear Lake
Well, Ecklund && Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so  made that assumption
Oh sure
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs
Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought should call it in, so  called it in
End a story
What'd this guy look like anyways
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny-lookin'
Uh-huh - in what way
Just a general way
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr
Mohra
You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in
Oh sure
They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow
Yah, got a front movin' in
Ya got that right
In his car, now parked, one hand holding the rag pressed to his mangled jaw
He is staring down at something in the front seat next to him
His other hand holds open the briefcase
It has money inside - a lot of money
Carl unfreezes, takes out one of the bank-wrapped wads and looks at it
Mmmnphh
He paws through the money in the briefcase to get a feeling for the amount
Jeshush Shrist
Jeshush fuchem Shrist
Excited, he counts out a bundle of bills and tosses it onto the back seat
He starts to take the rag away from his chin but the layer pressed against his face sticks, its loose weave bound to his skin by clotted blood
He pulls very gently and winces as blood starts to flow again
He carefully tears the rag in half so that only a bit of it remains adhering to his jaw
It is pulled over to the side of an untraveled road
THe door opens and Carl emerges with the briefcase
He slogs through the snow, down a gulley and up the embankment to a barbed-wire fence
He kneels at one of the fence posts and frantically digs into the snow with his bare hands, throws in the briefcase and covers it back up
He stands and tries to beat the circulation back into his red, frozen hands
He looks to the right
regular line of identical fence posts stretches away against unblemished white
He looks to the left
regular line of identical fence posts stretches away against unblemished white
He looks at the fence post in front of him
Mmmphh
He looks about the snowy vastness for a marker
Finding none, he kicks the fence post a couple of times, failing to scar or tilt it, then hurriedly plants a couple of sicks up against the post
He bends down, scoops up a handful of snow, presses it against his wounded jaw, and lopes back to the idling car
Marge has a packed overnight back sitting on the unmade bed
She is ready to leave, already wearing her parka, but is on the phone
No, 'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd
Well, 'm sorry  won't see ya
Mm
But ya think he's all right
saw him last night and he's - What'd he say
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' - His wife
Linda
No
Linda Cooksey
No
No
No
They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year
Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone
So
they didn't
No
No
They never married
Mike's had psychiatric problems
Oh
Oh, my
Yah, he - he's been struggling
He's living with his parents now
Oh
Geez
Yah, Linda's fine
You should call her
Geez
Well - geez
That's a suprise
' Marge drives, gazing out at the road
- She leans out of her open window and yells at the order panel: Hello
She sits in the lot, eating a breakfast sandwich
' Jerry is at his desk using a blunt pencil to enter numbers onto a form
Beneath the form is a piece of carbon paper and beneath that another form copy, which Jerry periodically checks
The carbon-copy form shows thick smudgy, illegible entries
Jerry hums nervously
Glass rattles as someone taps at his door
Jerry looks up and freezes, mouth hanging open, brow knit with worry
Marge sticks her head in the door
Mr
Lundegaard
Sorry to bother you again
Can  come in
She starts to enter
Yah, no, 'm kinda - 'm kinda busy - unnerstand
'll keep it real short, then
'm on my way out of town, but  was just -  Do you mind if  sit down
'm carrying a bit of a load here
No,  - But she is already sitting into the chair opposite with a sigh of relieved weight
Yah, it's this vehicle  asked you about yesterday
was just wondering - Yah, like  told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing
Okay, are you sure, cause,  mean, how do you know
Because, see, the crime 'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates
And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected
Yah,  see
So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently
The car's not from our lot, ma'am
but do you know that for sure without - Well,  would know
'm the Executive Sales Manager
Yah, but - We run a pretty tight ship here
know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir
Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of - Ma'am,  answered your question
There is a silent beat
'm sorry, sir
Ma'am,  answered your question
answered the darn -  'm cooperating here, and
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me
'm just doin' my job here
'm not, uh, 'm not arguin' here
'm cooperating
There's no, uh - we're doin' all we can
He trails off into silence
Sir, could  talk to Mr
Gustafson
Jerry stares at her
Mr
Lundegaard
Jerry explodes: Well, heck, if you wanna, if you wanna play games here
'm workin' with ya on this thing, but He is getting angrily off his feet
Okay, 'll do a damned lot count
Sir
Right now
Sure right now
You're darned tootin'
He is yanking his parka from a hook behind the opened door and grabbing a pair of galoshes
If it's so damned imporant to ya
'm sorry, sir,  - Jerry has the parka slung over one arm and the galoshes pinched in his hand
Aw, what the Christ
He stamps out the door
Marge stares
After a long moment her stare breaks
She glances idly around the office
There is a framed picture facing away from her on the desktop
She turns it to face her
It is Scotty, holding an accordion
There is another picture of Jean
Marge looks at it, looks around, for some reason, at the ceiling
She looks at a trophy shelf on the wall behind her
She fiddles idly with a pencil
She pulls a clipboard toward her
It holds a form from the General Motors Finance Corporation
She looks idly around
Her look abruptly locks
Oh, for Pete's sake
Jerry is easing his car around the near corner of the building
Marge's voice is flat with dismay: Oh, for Pete's sake
She grabs the phone and punches in a number
For Pete's s- he's fleein' the interview
He's feelin' the interview
Jerry makes a left turn into traffic
Detective Sibert, please
We are looking across a steam table at a man in blue
He moves slowly to the right, pushing his tray along a cafeteria line
Behind him, in the depth of the room, is an eating area of long Formica tables at which sit a mix of uniformed and civilian-clothed police and staff
We are listening to an offscreen woman's voice
Well, so far we're just saying he's wanted for questioning in connection with a triple homicide
Nobody at the dealship there's been much help guessing where he might go
The woman is entering frame sliding a tray
Marge enters behind her, sliding her own
We move laterally with them as they slowly make their way along the line
Uh-huh
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there
And his wife
She's visiting relatives in Florida
Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared
Nobody at his office knows where he is
Geez
Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought
You call his home
His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months
The big
Oh, my
And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling
He's now wanted for assault and parole violation
He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large
Boy, this thing is really
geez
Well, they're all out on the wire
Well, you know
Yah
Well,  just can't thank you enough, Detective Sibert, this cooperation has been outstanding
Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you
When're you due
End a April
Any others
This'll be our first
We've been waiting a long time
That's wonderful
Mm-mm
It'll change your life, a course
Oh, yah,  know that
They can really take over, that's for sure
You have children
Detective Sibert pulls an accordion of plastic picture sleeves from her purse to show Marge
thought you'd never ask
The older one is Janet, she's nine, and the younger one is Morgan
Oh, now he's adorable
He's three now
Course, not in that picture
Oh, he's adorable
Yah, he - Where'd you get him that parka
They have reached the end of the cafeteria line
With a nod to the cashier, Detective Sibert indicates hers and Marge's trays
Both of these
Oh, no,  can't let you do that
Oh, don't be silly
Well, okay - thank you, Detective
Oh, don't be silly
He sits eating a Swanson's  dinner from a  tray he has set up in front of an easy chair
He watches the old black-and-white  set whose image - it might be a game show - is still heavily ghosting and diffused by snow
The audio crackles with interference
Despite the impenetrability of its image, it holds Grimsrud's complete attention
At the sound of the front door opening, Grimsrud looks up
Carl enters, his face suppurating and raw
He reacts to Grimsrud's wordless look with a grotesque laugh
You should she zhe uzher guy
He glances around
The fuck happen a her
Jean sits slumped in a straight-backed chair facing the wall
Her hooded head, resting on her chin, is motionless
There is blood on the facing wall
She started shrieking, you know
Jezhush
He shakes his head
Well,  gotta muddy
He is plunking down eight bank-wrapped bundles on the table
All of it
All eighty gran
Forty for you
He makes one pile, pockets the rest
Forty for me
Sho thishuzh it
Adiosh
He slaps keys down on the table
You c'n'ave my truck
'm takin' a Shiera
We split that
Carl looks at him
' Ya dummy
Widda fuckin' chainshaw
Grimsrud looks sourly up
There is a beat
Finally: One of us pays the other for half
' '
' ' '
' ' - '
' '  ' Carl waits for an argument, but only gets the steady sour look
Carl pulls out a gun
' - '
beat
Carl returns Grimsrud's stare
Are we shquare
Grimsrud says nothing
beat
Disgusted, Carl pockets the gun and heads for the door
Fuckin' ash-hole
And if you shee your friend Shep Proudpfut, tell him 'm gonna  hizh fuckin' ash
We are pulling Carl as he walks toward the car
Behind him we see the cabin door opening
Carl turns, reacting to the sound
Grimsrud is bounding out wearing mittens and a red hunter's cap, but no overcoat
He is holding an ax
Carl fumbles in his pocket for his gun
Grimsrud swings overhand, burying the ax in Carl's neck
In her cruiser, on her two-way
Through it we hear Lou's voice, heavily filtered: His wife
This guy says she was kidnapped last Wednesday
The day of our homicides
Yah
Marge is peering to one side as she drives, looking through the bare trees that border the road on a declivity that runs down to a large frozen lake
And this guy is
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant
Gustafson's accountant
Yah
But we still haven't found Gustafson
(crackle) -  looking
Sorry - didn't copy
Still missing
We're looking
Copy
And Lundegaard too
Yah
Where are ya, Margie
We hear, distant but growing louder, harsh engine noise, as of a chainsaw or lawnmower
Oh, 'm almost back - 'm driving around Moose Lake
Oh
Gary's loudmouth
Yah, the loudmouth
So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em
Copy
We've got a - There's the car
There's the car
We are slowing as we approach a short driveway leading down to a cabin
Parked in front is the brown Cutlass Ciera
Whose car
My car
My car
Tan Ciera
Don't go in
Wait for back-up
Marge is straining to look
The power-tool noise is louder here but still muffled, its source not yet visible
Chief Gunderson
Copy
Yah, send me back-up
Yes, ma'am
Are we the closest
Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters
Marge pulls her prowler over some distance past the cabin
She gets out, zips up her khaki parka and pulls up its fur- lined hood
For a moment, she stands listening to the muffled roar of the power tool
Then, with one curved arm half pressing against, half supporting her belly, she takes slow, gingerly steps down the slope, through the deep snow, through the trees angling toward the cabin and the source of the grinding noise
She slogs from tree to tree, letting each one support her downhill-leaning weight for a moment before slogging to the next
The roar grows louder
Marge stands panting by one tree, her breath vaporizing out of her snorkel hood
She squints down toward the cabin's back lot
tall man with his back to us, wearing a red plaid quilted jacket and a hunting cap with earflaps, is laboring over a large power tool which his body blocks from view
Marge advances
The man is forcing downward something which engages the roaring power tool and makes harsh spluttering noises
The man is Grimsrud, his nose red and eyes watering from the cold, hatflaps pulled down over his ears
His breath steams as he sourly goes about his work, both hands pressing down a shod foot, as it if were the shaft of a butter churn
The roar is very loud
Marge slogs down to the next tree, panting, looking
Grimsrud forces more of the leg into the machine, which we can now see sprays small wet chunks out the bottom
Marge's eyes shift
large dark form lies in the snow next to Grimsrud
Grimsrud works on, eyes watering
With a grunt he bends down out of frame and then re-enters holding a thick log
He uses it to force the leg deeper into the machine
Marge is advancing
She holds a gun extended toward Grimsrud, who is still turned away
Grimsrud rubs his nose with the back of his hand
Marge closes in, grimacing
Grimsrud's back strains as he puts his weight into the log that pushes down into the machine
The dark shape in the snow next to his side is the rest of Carl Showalter's body
Marge has drawn to within twenty yards
When she bellows it sounds hollow and distant, her voice all but eaten up by the roar of the power tool
Stop
Police
Turn around and hands up
Startled, Grimsrud scowls
He turns to face her
He stares
Marge bellows again: Hands up
Conscious of the noise, she shows with a twist of her shoulder the armpatch insignia
Police
Grimsrud stares
With a quick twist, he reaches back for the log, hurls it at Marge and then starts running away
Marge twists her body sideways, shielding herself
No need - the heavy log travels perhaps ten yards and lands in the snow several feet short of her
Grimsrud pants up the hill - slow going through the deep snow
Behind him: Halt
She fires in the air
She lowers the gun and carefully sighs
Halt
She fires
Grimsrud still slogs up the hill - a miss
Marge sights again
Halt
She fires again
Grimsrud pitches forward
He mutters in Swedish as he reaches down to clutch at his wounded leg
Marge walks toward him, gun trained on him as her other hand reaches under her parka and gropes around her waist
It comes out with a pair of handcuffs, which she opens with a snap of the wrist
All right, buddy
On your belly and your hands clasped behind you
Marge drives
Grimsrud sits in the back seat, hands cuffed behind him
For a long moment there, he is quiet - only engine hum and the periodic clomp of wheels on pavement seams - as Marge grimly shakes her head
So that was Mrs
Lundegaard in there
She glances up in the rear-view mirror
Grimsrud, cheeks sunk, eyes hollow, looks sourly out at the road
Marge shakes her head
At length: guess that was your accomplice in the wood chipper
Grimsrud's head bobs with bumps on the road; otherwise he is motionless, reactionless, scowling and gazing out
And those three people in Brainerd
No response
Marge, gazing forward, seems to be talking to herself
And for what
For a little bit of money
We hear distant sirens
There's more to life than money, you know
She glances up in the rear-view mirror
Don't you know that
And here ya are, and it's a beautiful day
Grimsrud's hollow eyes stare out
The sirens are getting louder
Marge pulls over
Well
She leans forward to the dash to give two short signalling on her siren
She turns on her flashers
She leans back with a creak and jangle of utilities
She stares forward, shakes her head
We hear the dull click of her flashers
just don't unnerstand it
Outside it is snowing
The sky, the earth, the road - all white
squad car, gumballs spinning, punches through the white
It approaches in slow motion
An ambulance punches through after it
Another squad car
: : It stands next to a highway on a snowy, windslept plain
One or two cars dot the parking lot along with an idling police cruiser
We are looking over the shoulders of two uniformed policemen who stand on either side of the door, their hands resting lightly on their holstered sidearms
One of them raps at the door
Mr
Anderson
title fades in:    , After a pause, muffled through the door: Who
Mr
Anderson, is this your burgundy 88 out here
Just a sec
Could you open the door, please
Yah
Yah, just a sec
We hear a clatter from inside
Just a sec
One of the policemen unholsters his gun and nods to someone whose back enters - a superintendent holding a ring of keys
This man turns a key in the door and then stands away
The two policemen, guns at the ready, bang into the motel room
The rough hand-held camera rushes in behind them as the two men give the room a two-handed sweep with their guns
The room is empty
Cop one indicates the open bathroom door
Dale
The two men charge the bathroom, belts jingling, guns at the ready, jittery camera behind them rushing to keep pace
man in boxer shorts is halfway out the bathroom window
The policemen holster their guns and charge the window, and drag Jerry Lundegaard back into the room
His flesh quivers as he thrashes and keens in short, piercing screams
The cops wrestle him to the floor but his palsied thrashing continues
The policemen struggle to restrain him
Call an ambulance
You got him okay
Cop One pinions Jerry's arms to the floor and Jerry bursts into uncontrolled sobbing
Yah, yah, call an ambulance
Jerry sobs and screams
We are square on Norm, who sits in bed watching television
After a long beat, Marge enters frame in a nightie and climbs into bed, with some effort
Oooph
Norm reaches for her hand as both watch the television
At length Norm speaks, but keeps his eyes on the
They announced it
Marge looks at him
They announced it
Yah
Marge looks at him, waiting for more, but Norm's eyes stay fixed on the television
So
Three-cent stamp
Your mallard
Yah
Norm, that's terrific
Norm tries to suppress a smile of pleasure
It's just the three cent
It's terrific
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent
People don't much use the three-cent
Oh, for Pete's - a course they do
Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps
Yah
When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones
Yah,  guess
That's terrific
Her eyes go back to the
'm so proud a you, Norm
Norm murmurs: love you, Margie
love you, Norm
Both of them are watching the  as Norm reaches out to rest a hand on top of her stomach
Two more months
Marge absently rests her own hand on top of his
Two more months
Hold; fade out
