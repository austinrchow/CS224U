Written by Mike White (v

) As a girl, you see the world like a giant candy store, filled with sweet candy and such
But one day you look around and see a prison and you're on death row
You wanna run, or scream or cry
But something's locking you up
Are the other folks cows, chewing cud till the hour come and their heads roll
Or are they just keeping quiet, like you
Planning their escape
(Camera zooms on Holden/Tom) On your left, honey
What's that cashier's name
Can't say
When did he start working here
Don't know
Yesterday
Who is he
Don't know
Can't say
What are you doing
It's called work, princess
Kind of fun
You might want to give it a go someday
Attention, shoppers
There's a Retail Rodeo special on aisle three
Liquid drain cleaner
Two 12-ounce cans for $5
Liquid drain cleaner has churning power and will churn right through your pipes
Ladies, shove something clean and new up your filthy pipes
Liquid drain cleaner on aisle three
Have a good day and thank you for shopping at Retail Rodeo
Hey, Justine
Can  talk to you for a second
Yeah
was just curious
Have you ever been to a Bible study
Yeah
We got a good one going on every Wednesday at the First Church of Nazarine
Rodney comes, Benita comes
You got any interest in reading the Bible
have my own, you know, beliefs
We don't preach fire and brimstone
Just the Ten Commandments
Were not interested in scaring people
Were about loving Jesus
kinda like my nights to myself
Well, maybe you'll have nights of eternal hellfire to yourself
Just kidding you
Drive safe
Bye-bye
Hey, Justine
Hey, Teeny
How was your day
The same
How was yours
The wind was flipping paint in our eyes
Paint stings
Feel like 've been attacked by hornets in my eyeballs
Bubba, stand up
Why
For Christ's sakes
Look at that couch, Phil
'all got paint all over it
This ain't gonna come off
Damn it, Phil
including this gorgeous eggplant
think we got most of it out
You two were stoned
You, keep frying your brain liike that, you'll slip off a ladder and crack open your head bone
You do really stupid things when you're high, Phil
Like what
Like sitting on my couch with your big blue ass
Everything just turns to shit
You finally get nice things, then everything just gets messed up
Why is this buzzing
It's the wind doing that
They the wind's coming in different lately
Different from what
What you reading
Catcher in the Rye 'm named after it
What's your name
Catcher
Holden
After Holden Caulfield
He's the main character
What's he do
He's put upon by society
Hypocrisy of the world
notice that you're, uh, not very social
'm a writer
What do you write
Novels, plays, screenplays, stories, poetry
(to costumer) That's good
Justine will be right with you
Where is she
better go
What happens at the end of your book
Oh, he has a nervous breakdown
Goes to a mental hospital
You don't get paid to pick your crack
You get paid to work
'm not sure  can do makeovers
Oh, come on
little pancake, eyeliner, mascara, rouge on the cheeks and powder it up
Then you take a moist tissue, roll it in a ball and toss it in their face
Jeez, Louise
'm talking to a tree stump
Girl, where are you
Sorry, Im just a little tired
It's the food you eat, Justine
Look at me
am 10 years older than you and have 10 times your energy
Cause don't eat meat and  don't eat dairy
It's probably why you can't get pregnant, honey
And why you have that hung-jaw look on your face
It's the cheese in your pizza and the chicken in your salad
went to the doctor
He says 'm fertile
He says  could repopulate the entire planet
Then what's the deal here
Did he say you get enough vitamins
He didn't say
You could make paint where, at different angles, the house is different colours
You stand at the front door and the house is red
You stand at the street and the house is green
Or you could make, like, an invisible paint
Make the whole house disappear
What would be really neat is a paint that could change the molecular structure of a house, like a chemical acid deal
What do you think, Teeny
think you two are a pair of potheads
You getting a whole one of these or a half
That oneright there
You didn't bring this into the store
No
Well then, 'll charge you for it
This is a hand lotion
So don't put it anywhere else, even if you need lubrication
We try to keep frivolous lawsuits to a minimum, unless, ofcourse, the customer is at fault
Here's your change and Fuck you very much
Excuse me
Thank you very much
Good as new, 'll tell ya, good as new
Now, you might be interested in purchasing some of the products  used today
Oh, 'm not buying anything today
Well, that'd be a mistake
These are bargain prices
didn't bring my purse
hate my job
That makes two of us
hate everyone here
hate Gwen don't know what the hell she's so happy about
'm sorry  don't understand why maniacs get shotguns and shoot everybody to pieces
Maybe you're a maniac
Maybe so
You know you're lips are real pouty, like a woman
And how your eyes droop off to the side
How old are you
Twenty two
'm an old lady next to you
How old are you
How old do you think
don't know
am thirty years old
How long you been workin' here for
Forever and a day
You don't have a car
Oh,  live right down the street
Well, you can ride in here, there's room
You wanna come in
don't know
'm in a funk
Well, 'm not gonna beg ya
'll be in my room
Okay, Tom
They call you Tom
It's my slave name
Holden's what call myself
This is my room
Not aolt to look at
What are your folks like
They're okay
They don't get me
mean, they're alright
My husband doesn't get me
Since when do you have a husband
Since seven years
He's a painter
What's he paint
Houses
He's a pig
He talks but he doesn't think
You go to college
Um,  had to drop out
had a problem with drinkin' and stuff
'll go back
just gotta prove to my parents that can fly staright
You go to college
No,  was afraid 'd lose Phil if went
Now that'd be reason enough to go
saw you in the store and  liked how you kept to yourself
can see in your eyes that you hate the world
hate it too
You know what 'm talkin' about
After livin in the dark for so long a glimspe of the light can make you giddy
Strange thought come into your head and you'd better think 'em
Has a special fate been callin' you and you not listenin
Is there a secret message right in front you, and you're not reading it
Is this your last, best chance
Are you gonna take it
Or are you goin' to the grave with unlived lives in your vains
( conversation) Teeny, you're pretty
Bubba, isn't Teeny pretty
've seen better, 've seen worse
Nah
That's why  ain't never married
You got yourself the best fish in the sea
wonder what it'd be like to be a woman
All that smooth skin and long hair
If  was a woman, 'd be a slut
lesbian slut
Gwen says smokin' marijuana lowers your sperm
Lowers it to where
Maybe you're the infertile one 'round here
Maybe every time you smoke a little dooby, you're killin' our unborn children
Alright, close
Why you limping
twisted up my ankle on the stairs
was wonderin', maybe you could give me a ride home
Yeah, sure okay
Alright 'll talk to you about it later
All  know is, everyone should have one beau, before anyone has two beaus
He's not my beau, he's my friend
Happy Halloween Retail Rodeo shoppers
There's a Retail Rodeo special on all bulk candy on aisle four
Ghouls and goblins, witches and warlocks, wandering these aisles, day after day
'll put a Halloween curse on you
Night Corny
Happy Halloween
Well 'm not a pagen but thanks all the same
Which ankle did you twist, Holden
My, uh, left
Maybe you should put some cold water on it so it doesn't sweel up and inflame
Okay
You're a writer so you have yourself a goal
used to lie in bed and imagine other cities, other jobs  could have
Other husbands
Now  don't even know what to imagine anymore
Holden,  have a husband
You said he was a pig
Well, Holden
don't want to hurt anybody
( sounds) was thinking about what you were sayin' about my sperm bein' low
mean, know  got good sperm
It's baby-makin sperm
suppose it couldn't hurt to have it confirmed by an expert
Oh who gives a shit, who needs a &$%' baby around here anyways
If you wanna make yourself useful, why don't you get that goddamn  fixed
What the hell
It sounds like a helicopter is landin' in here
You want a blackberry, honey
man was sellin' 'em on the road
No thank you
This is for you Justine
It's from Holden
Well where is he
He's got the day off
He came by this morning with it
Thanks
Don't mention it
Hey, Gwen
Hey sugar
Dear Justine
Because of you 'll be quitting the Retail Rodeo
The last two days have been the most god-awful days of my life
've not been able to get rid of you in my head
never wanted anything so bad, and  have wanted many things
'd given up long ago on being gotten by someone else, and then you came along
The idea of being gotten, because of circumstance, will never get got is the worst feeling 've ever felt, and  have felt many bad feelings
'm sorry  can never see you again, Justine, forgive me for being so weak, but that is who  am
Goodbye, Holden Wurther
If for some reason, you could change your mind and want to be with me, body and soul, meet me after work
will be waiting for you at five outside Chuck
Cheese
If you are not there at five, you will never see me in your lifetime
Gwen
What's wrong
Gwen 'm okay
feel a little sick
Gwen
Gwen you sick
Justine
Justine what's goin' on in here
Gwen, you sick
We gotta get her to a hospital
Justine you drive her
Well what time is it
It's aquarter to five
Why, you gotta be somewhere
Gwen
Oh,  had a dream
had dream that sprouted a beard made of bean sprouts
'm gonna let you off here, okay
Okay,You'll meet me inside
Yeah, you know what 'm gonna do
'm gonna park the car, then 'm gonna meet you inside
Okay
Your a doll
Hey
Oh god, 'm really glad you came
just ditched Gwen at the hospital
Oh god, thank god
Where are we goin'
Let's go to my house
No, with your folks there
Let's just park somewhere
This isn't well planned
Look
don't know
don't care  just wanna hold you
That's fourty five dollars even
And need you to fill this out for me
(Justine and Holden are in the hotel room and make love
) (after the made love) can't do it
We'll be back here before you know it
don't wanna
don't wanna go
Justine
'm yours
'm all yours
(they kiss) Hey
Hey
Were you been
Gwen got real sick today
She was throwin' up all over the store
had to take her to the hositpal, and sat with her
Did she sick up on you
No
Did she sick up on anybody
(chuckles) It's not funny, Phil, this is serious
'm gonna go up there tomorrow too
And the next day
Justine
What happened to you
What
went down to St
Catherine's to check up on Gwen
looked all over for you, she was askin' for you
Well, how is she
She was heavin' up until there was nothin' left to heave
Doctor said she must've eaten somethin' with some kind of parasite in it or somethin'
bet it was those blackberries
They're gonna keep her in there until she gets better so you're gonna have to supervise cosmetics
(there they go again) Stop it, somebody's gonna see
Who cares,  don't care
crave you
wanna know everything about you
Who are you
'm just this woman
moved to Texas when  was eleven
My daddy was in the Air Force
wanna knock open your head and see what's inside
've had so much pain in my life
know you have too,  can see it
(at the hotel, in bed, probably after they made love) Holden gave me two of his stories to read
It's like what a story would be
was about a boy who was put upon, his mother was cold and selfish, and his father wanted him to play football
Other people didn't get him, especially girls
Then the boy comes to believe no one can ever really know him
So he starts actin' out, drinkin', and doin' all kinds of drugs
At the end the boy kills himself but jumpin' over abridge
The second story was pretty much the same as the first
Except at the end, the boy kills himself by drinkin' a bottle of bug poison
Your stories are intense
just wanna leave some kind of legacy
Somethin' great
After that  don't care what happens to me
Don't say that
wish there was a story about me
don't know who would read it though
would
like this
like havin' a secret
You gave me a secret Holden
Seee, now that you met me you're mysterious
And dark and twisted
'm going to hell, aren't
Yes, you are
(she rolls on top of him and they kiss) (they exit the hotel and Justine sees a car) That's Bubba's truck
Get in the car
Phil takes that truck to work everyday
Bubba picks him up, and drops him off
Why, why would that truck be parked there
don't know
If he finds out about us
won't let him hurt you
He's big, Holden
He'll kill you
He'll beat me, but he'll kill you
You can't worry about somethin' that hasn't even happened yet
gotta go to the hospital
Okay
(leans in to kiss her; she pulls away) Don't
mean he could be followin' us
Justine
Poor lady
She just passed
Who
Gwen
She just passed away
What do you mean
thought she had a stomach ache
It got worse
She was on life support all day
don't understand
It's God's will, Justine
No one can understand it
It was just Gwen's time to fly away home
(Justine looks guilty and shocked) Gwen died today
What
Are you kiddin
What for
Parasite
Somethin' she ate
You okay
Where were you this afternoon
Paintin' on Bovery
Why
What time did Bubba bring you home
We knocked off early 'bout four
Bubba had a date with a stewardess, why
Oh
can't believe she's dead
wasn't a very good friend to her
Don't say that, Teeny
'Course you were
'Course you were
Retail Rodeo employees this is Jack Fields, your store manager
Before we open today,  just want to share some terrible and shocking news
One of our best employees, Gwen Jackson, died yesterday
Gwen was a real class act
She had a good attitude, she had ideas
We're all gonna miss her
Now, if any of y'all need to collect you thoughts and remember Gwen
, then today's the day
You'll be excused from work and we'll just have to do without you
Gwen, this one's for you
(music comes over ) Holden had the notion to go to Gabler's Creek, skinny dippin' and makin' love
He said we'd be like Adam and Eve, rollin' around around in the sticks and the dirt and bein' one with nature
He was so fixed on the idea thateven when the clouds started rollin' in, and the sky was gettin; dark, he kept on swimmin'
All my thoughts turned to death
thought of Gwen's body, rottin' away
thought of how nice a person she was, so full of life and good will
If there was a heaven, Gwen would be there
Givin' makeovers and offerin' up helpful advice
thought if  died today, what would happen to me
hateful girl
selfish girl
An adultress
liar
(Justine and Holden are running towards the car and get in) (Next scene they're in the car; back seats, kissing) What are we doin'
Makin' one out of two
(sighs)  haven't thought this through
Justine, will you leave him
And go where
Away
With you on my arm, my folks'll think 've changed
They'll stop thinkin' 'm suck a loner,  got a girlfriend, a pretty one, who knows me and likes me
And they'll be so happy, they'll give me money to write my novel
But where will we
We'll be like
Catcher in the Rye
Only by me
'll be immortal and then like  Salinger 'll just vanish
Hey, Teeny
We've been up to no good
We got the day off on account of the rain
thought you might
( sounds) So  heard about your friend bein' dead, and all
'm sorry
Yeah
She was real healthy too
Well, at least you were with her when she went
(intense voice and look) Ain't that right
You were
with her, when she went
Yeah
Oh,  wish it would rain every day from here on out
Never have to paint again
Hey Justine
How you holding up
Fine
Real shocker
decided to move Cheryl over to cosmetics
She got a little too creative on the
Maybe she'll watch her 's and 's over here
If not she's out on her but
Now you listen to Justine, sister
You want me to help you get stuff out of storage
Not right now, maybe later
Well, are you gonna give me a ride home
My ankle's actin' up
gotta get home
Maybe Cheryl can
What, you need a ride
Forget it
think we gotta take a breather
'm nervous
Well, can't we go to the motel
Not today
Well, let's go in the store room
Just be patient, Holden
(Holden looks freaky; sort of like he's losing his mind not being able to be close to her) was wonderin', when was that, uh, bible study
Tomorrow night at eight
We'd love to have ya
Can  bring my husband
'Course
couple that prays together stays together
What's this
The Holy Bible
There's one for you, and one for me
Not very light is it
We're goin' to Bible study
couple that prays together, stays together
heard it was the couple that lays together stays together
Well you heard wrong
Cheryl
You think you can take this one
Sure
Sit right down here ma'am, we're gonna make you pretty
Now how do you like your hair
Wait, you gonna do my hair
No,  just need to know if that's your usual way of wearing it all big and high
If it is then 'll just put more makeup on your chin to off-set
Now, you're gonna want to take a whole bottle of this home wtih you
It's got quite alot of ingredients in it so you're getting a good deal
It's got Ginco extract in it, do you know what that is
No
It's extract of the Ginco and it makes your skin real slick so that any liquid will roll right off, be it water or lemon juice or urine
'll put that in a bag for you
Phil, what the hell are you doin'
We're gonna be late for Bible study
You're stoned, you got paint in your hair, would you just get in the shower
completely didn't remember
Get in the shower
Workin' on your spiritual life
Yeah,  guess
Ain't that a hoot and a holler
What do you mean
saw you, Justine
Saw me what
saw you
We got some things to talk about, you and me
You come by my place after work
If you knwo what's good for ya
Hey
Where's Bubba
He left
Well, 'm ready
Let's go
don't know what to say about Jesus
'm stoned
Just let the other people do the talking
Jeez
We forgot the Bibles, Justine
Well, that's alright, they'll forgive us
Hi
Welcome
Hey there people
Glad you could make it
Hi Corny
This is my husband, Phil
'all are in for a treat
We got a good discussion going tonight
If man is made in God's image, what does that say about God
Yeah, that sounds like a good one
(Justine recognizes one of the people
It's the guy who works at the motel where she and Holden have been going to
) Phil, come with me to the car
What
Come with me to the car,  gotta get somethin'
What's goin' on
Just get in the car
Get in the car, Phil
What the hell
don't want to go to Bible study
Why not
Because  don't want to
Now, can we please just get out of here
Justine, this is embarassing
We're runnin' away from Bible study like a couple of Devil worshippers
don't care
'm not in the mood
You are freakin' me out, man
Why
Why
Beacause we forgot our Bibles is why
You just said a few minutes ago they'll forgive us
Yeah, well, they may not, alright
So can we please just get the shit outta here
'm never goin' back to Bible study again
don't care, fine by me
think  look too white, don't you think
'm just tryin' to match your face with your hair,  was thinkin' you're not white enough
think  look kinda wierd
Well, the first rule of fashion is that you have to look wierd
What 'm doing here has come straight from France
Oh
It's called circ du face, meaning circus of the face and it's all the rage with the Frenchies
Well, you're the professoinal
That's right
Justine, what happened to you
looked up and  saw you two drivin' off like vampires in the night
Oh geez, we forgot our Bibles
You coulda looked off your neighbor
It's a church, you know
You can't make water without bumpin' your nut on a bible
Oh
Well, we felt bad
(looks at the customer) What in blazes
Do you like it
can't go
What
can't go today
There's something important  need to tend to
thought you said we'd go today
Well, something came up
What came up
Um, okay
think, maybe, somebody's found out about us
'm starting to wonder if you even want to go
'm startin' to think you don't get me
Well, maybe  don't get you
You do, you do get me you just don't want to me 'cause 'm too intensified for you
Justine, who cares, who cares if someone finds out
We don't have to live like this, Justine
know what it's like to go home every night and feel like you're hidin' out
We can leave all this behind
That's easy for you to say, Holden, you are not married
You just, you just gonna give up
You gonna go crawlin' back
Holden, you are gonna get us caught
You're so fucking afraid it makes me sick
Don't give up on us
won't
(Justine goes out of the backdoor of Retail Rodeo, takes a few deep breaths, trying not to freak out) 'll see you tomorrow, okay
Okay
Okay
Good luck on your important thing
Thanks
(Justine arrives at Bubba's
He opens the door and his dog, Bitz, is barking
) Easy Bitz, easy Bitz
Back in your corner
Back in your corner
Back in your corner, Bitz
Come on in
wanna show you somethin'
Sit
(Yells at dog again) 'm in shock
Why
You know why
Bubba sat like that for what seemed like ten years before he began to speak
Finally, when he opened his mouth, he talked a blue streak about the ruin that was his life
He talked about how he loved Phil, and how he loved me
And how he always wanted a girlfriend just like me, and to be a guy like Phil, to this imaginary girl like me, that he never found
Then he wen on about givin' up your dreams and how it's all a part of gettin' older
Bubba had given up on his dream to be like Phil, and accepted his fate as Bubba, always and forever
Then, last week, a door that remained shut swung wide open
Bubba thought this no chance coincidence, a cosmic force was at work
The sounds of me makin' love to a man that wasn't Phil was like a shout in Bubba's ear from the creator himself
What it meant, or what to do, or why Bubba didn't know
All he knew was that he hated me for poisoning the well of idealism that he had drunk from for so long
was no longer Bubba's image of perfection
To him  was just a liar, and a whore, and that sickened him
But on the other hand he loved me for opening his eyes and releasing him from the bitter chains of evny that bound him to Phil
Phil was no superman, just a cuckhold, and a foll, and that was beautiful
Bubba felt that there was just one thing left for us to do
Something that would solve both our problems and end this whole tragic cycle
Bubba,  am not gonna sleep with you
But don't you see
This is my chance, for liberation
But, one person's liberation is another person's, well, badness
There's just no way
'm gonna have to tell Phil then
Why
He's my best friend
can't keep him in the dark about somethin' this big
He's a cuckhold
You wanna cuckhold him yourself
Well that's different
That isn't about him
That's about my salvation
Look, you've got your choice to make
Either destroy your marriage, and break your husband's heart
Or have sex with me right now
(Bubba is yelling at the dog again, and saying Justine's name) Oh god
There was someone in the window
Did you not see
You're paranoid
gotta go
Phil is never gonna find out about any of this
Don't fret
(the dog is still barking) Get this damn dog away from me
You're lookin' at a free man, Justine
free man
Great
Good for you
Thank you
(Yelling at dog again
) ( sounds as Phil comes out of the bathroom, still brushing his teeth) 'm nervous
You're nervous
Why
'Cause  gotta go to that doctor tomorrow and jism into a cup, that's why
What if  can't do it
You can do it
You know, If you said you'd help me 'd feel alot less nervous
It's gonna be on your lunch hour anyway
Okay
You didn't even say nothing about the bein' fixed
Oh
Is it
Thanks
You're welcome
Well aren't you a fright
Justine, you talked to Holden lately
He didn't show up for work today,  wanna know what gives
know you two are friends
We're not friends
You eat lunch together every day
No, we don't
Well, if you see him, tell him Jack Fields is lookin' for him
(Justine gets in the car and is shocked when she sees Holden in the car, more depressed than ever
) Oh my god
What are you doin'
You're a hooker, you hooker
saw you
You followed me
So, how many guys you gettin' with
You gettin' with every guy in the state
No, Holden, this is all because of you
He had me over a barrel
If  didn't sleep with him he was gonna tell Phil about us
'm so alone
You've gotta get a hold of yourself
Are you drunk
Yes, 'm drunk
And 'll be drunk every day until the day  die
What do you care
You jump on any pecker that's put in front of you
It's not what you think
saw everything
Oh god
Oh god
Look, go home
Sober up
And meet me after work
Where you goin'
gotta help Phil with his sperm
What
Just go
Go
can't share you, Justine
Maybe with one man but not with a whole bunch of 'em
Great
Mr
Last
Would you come with me
Wish me luck
Good luck, honey
Knock 'em dead, partner
(Justine and Bubba watch Phil walk into one of the rooms) You look nice
No,  don't
know you're angry and  can figure why
But, from where  stand, what happened yesterday was a wonderful thing
Nothin' happened yesterday, so drop it
Well, 'm awful grateful to ya, Justine
Bubba,  mean it
Let me just ask you one thing
How do stack up against Phil
You know, how do  stack up where it counts
Ma'am
Your husband asked me to request for your presence
(Justine knocks on the door
) Who's there
It's Justine
(gets into the room) 'mon
can't do this on my own need help
You've never done it on your own
Not in a place like this
Not where have to hand over the results
Just, let me hold your boob
(holds her boob; Justine's face is full of pain) Ah, they're sore
(Justine looks fed up with everything) What's wrong with you
You look like death
My stomach's crampin'
feel sore
Is it your period
Nah, it's stress
This job is stressful
'm breaking out
You're breakin' out 'cause you put so much makeup on your face
Maybe you're pregnant
What
No
(thinks about it) You know, sometimes,  think to myself, at least it can't get any worse
But it can
can worse
As long as you can say you've hit rock bottom you can
Oh my god, Blackberries
blind man can go deaf
widow can lose her children
Babies starve and they never get food
They never get any food
They just come into the world and they die
Calm down, Holden
can't calm down
'd be easy if was a hooker like you
could calm down all over town
Hey, hey
am not a hooker
know you're not
'm in agony
Why
What do you mean 'why'
thought you hated your life
do
mean 'm depressed but
You are really depressed
'll kill him
'll murder him in his sleep
'll kill my parents, 'll steal the money whatever it takes
You just, just whatever you want as long as it's you and me
Please don't forsake me Justine
Oh
,  promise
(car is parked somewhere; Justine and Holden are sitting on the car, Holden's smoking) realized then that Holden was at best a child, and at worst a demon
If was ever gonna go straight 'd have to ditch him
Sometimes, to get back on the road to redemption, you have to make a few pit stops
(Justine goes up to the "Blackberry Man") How much are the blackberries
tin for two dollars, miss
(gives her the blackberries) There you go
Thank you
(Holden and Justine are in the car again, Justine's driving) Have a blackberry
We need a plan
We can't keep livin' day to day
We gotta chart a course and we just gotaa stick
Have a blackberry, Holden
But, they're dirty
(hesitating, he eats a blackberry and then smiles) They're sweet
If  could only get my hands on some money, someone could just tell me the answer
gotta do
But If ever do,  end up thinking about it instead
gotta do
But do what
(Justine pushes the blackberry he's about to eat away from his mouth) What
What was that for
They looked dirty
,  think  saw a bug in them or something
(Jack talking to Holden about something) (Justine's talking to Holden's parents
) 'm worried about Holden
Tom
'm worried about Tom
just befriended Tom, recently, and now, well,  think he's mentally ill
He has this idea in his head that we've had some sort of affair
Which is crazy because 'm, 'm married
He's been sayin' all sorts of strange things, and makin' threats
And drinkin'
And, and  just think he would be better off in a place where people, professionals, could take care of him
Otherwise, he's just gonna get himself in trouble
What are you doin' in here
What's that
It's a home pregnancy test
Why you takin' it
'Cause  still haven't gotten my period
What's it say
Well,  haven't taken it yet
Could you give me a minute please
wanna be here when you find out
Okay
The little plastic doohickey's turnin' blue
What's that mean
Blue
Bright blue
It means 'm pregnant
knew it
Waste of time going to that sperm doctor
We did it
We're gonna have ourselves a baby
Maybe
And tomorrow, we're gonna celebrate at Senor Tuna
Yes we are
'm gonna bring Bubba
You can bring some of your friends from work
Or Bible study guy
Whoever
Too bad Gwen's dead
The test could be wrong, Phil
It's a little early to be havin' a party
Let's do it mellow then
You sure don't seem too excited
No, 'm excited
It's just, a lot of worries come with havin' a baby
Don't think negative
Think positive
We could have ourselves a tiny Phil
Or a tiny Teeny
Teeny's gonna have a tiny weeny Teeny
Do you think anything's gonna change havin' a baby
What do you mean
Everything's gonna change
Yeah, but  mean, do you think anything's really gonna change
What do ya mean
(Holden and his parents sit on the couch and watch  when the phone rings
Holden gets it
) (picks up the phone) Hello
Hi, this is Dr
Williams returning the call of Jean Worther
'm calling from the Holland County psychiatric hospital
(Holden hangs up) Who was it, Tom
It was a wrong number
(Holden goes into his room with a crazy smile on his face
He starts to laugh
When he hears the phone ring again, he stops smiling and starts to look like he's thinking of something
) Either of you seen Holden
Boy is out on his ass
Justine, somethin's goin' on
Something is definately happening
Go find out
It's big
It's very big
'mon Cheryl, 'm gonna kill you
Someone stole fifteen thousand dollars from the safe
They blew the thing open with a gun
Oh my god
Not only that but the cops know who did it
Who
Somebody who works here
Cheryl
Holden, Holden did it
Fool left his cashier key in the door
Oh my god

Suit yourself
Justine
Can we talk to you for a second
Hi, Justine
Go ahead and have a seat
Justine, you like workin' at the Retail Rodeo don't you
Like the company, like the people
You wouldn't want to jeopardize that by makin' some silly error in judgement would ya
Holden stole fifteen thousand dollars from the safe last night
Did you have anything to do with it
No
don't know anything
'Cause we know you're pretty tight with Holden
hardly know him
've seen you in the store room with him Justine
On many the occasion think you know him pretty well
don't know anything
Justine
Justine

finally did somethin'
Holden, the police are lookin' for you
Oh, who cares
'm proud of myself
Fuck them, Fuck all of them
Hey
They think that 'm in on it, too
Corny's got a camera in that storage room
That Bible thumpin' pervert's been watchin' us the whole time
Well, we're outta here
Justine,  got over twenty thousand dollars
got a gun, what else
'm gettin' all goosey
think 'm gonna crash
(takes a right turn and stops the car) 'm pregnant, Holden
It's my baby
Not necessarily
Yes, it is
You know it is
Even if it is, you cannot raise a baby on the run
Yes, you can
mean, you can't raise a baby here
You know that
Justine
You hate your husband
You hate your job
You love me, so let's go
can't go tonight
gotta pack my things and 'd have to get more money
Well, then tomorrow
'll go to the motel and wait for you
Just be there by noon
This is all going too fast
Justine, what have you got to lose
Nothin'
So be there by noon
Okay
love you, Justine
This is all gonna work out

almost forgot
This is a story of your life
You inspired me
(they kiss and Holden gets out of the car) Hey Teeny
Hey
We were gettin' worried about ya
Sorry
Justine, this is Liberta
Liberta, this is Justine
Hi
Hi
Congratulations, on your expectation
Thanks
Do you think it's a girl or a boy
Doesn't matter
As long as it plays quarterback for the Cowboys
Well,  hear Senor Tuna callin'
(phone rings) (picks up the phone) Hello
Yeah
Well, that's not right
What's that supposed to mean
Hey look
No
You don't know shit okay
Justine's pregnant
You got that
Well, look you better check your records again, pal, then call me
(hangs up) Some doctor says my sperm's no good
Does that mean Justine's not pregnant
No
That just means they got it wrong, is all
They don't know everything
They just got it wrong, so
(Justine and Phil are in bed together
) Looks like that wind's pickin' up again
(Justine is packing her things, she seems to be in a hurry
She drives down the street with her car and stops because of the red lights
) How it all came down to this, only the devil knows
Retail Rodeo was at the corner on my left, the motel was down the road to my right
closed my eyes and tried to peer into the future
On my left  saw days upon days of lipstick and ticking clocks
Dirty looks and quiet whisperings
and burning secrets that won't ever die away
And on my right, what could  picture
The blue sky, the desert earth streching out into the eerie infinity
beautiful, never ending nothing
Hey Justine
know where you can find him
Holden
He's at the Hotel Glen Capri, and he'll be there till noon
You done good
You're a good girl
Hey
Hey
What's going on in the bedroom
Looks like a twister hit it
Oh yeah
was doin' laundry
thought we were robbed
Why aren't you at work
They gave me the day off
( reporter talking about Holden killing himself at the hotel) Retail Rodeo
You know that guy
No
Attention Retail Rodeo employees this is JAck Fields, your store manager
As most of you all know by now, We lost another employee yesterday
Holden was a thief and a disturbed young man, and what happened was a sad thing
Perhaps we can learn a lesson from this tragedy, like don't steal and don't be disturbed
The important is to move on
Like dozens of those who quit
This one's for you Holden
thought we were gonna get a day off and go to the movies
What
was just at your house and the mail came
Phil was opening letters, and he opened this bill from the credit card company
And &$%
Please don't tell him about us, Justine
Please
Please
love Phil
love him more than myself
Please have mercy on me
Hey Phil
Have you been sleepin' around behind my back
What
said, have you been sleepin' around behind my back
Yes
(he slaps her) Why
Why
don't know why
Don't you love me
Don't you love me at all
You're the only man alive that  love
Oh god
Please don't tell me it's not my baby
It's your baby
Are you sure
It is
swear
swear to God
Who is he
It doesn't matter
Yes, it does
Was it some guy from work
Yes
Yeah,  know who it was
It was that Bible guy, wasn't it
The Nazarine
That's why you were actin' so spooked
Yeah, yeah
'm gonna beat his ass
Don't
You're gettin' all swollen
'm sorry hit you, baby
'm sorry, Phil
need to get stoned
Okay
Get stoned
just gotta escape, you know
You ever feel like that
Like you gotta escape
What are those
Fake eyelashes
Extra long
Just do it normal for once
You want me to make the other cheek purple to even it out
No
'you hear about Corny
He was goin' home after Bible study last night and two beefy guys with painted faces pulled up in a truck and jumped him
That's terrible
(shot of Justine in the bathroom of Retail Rodeo
She's sitting on one of the toilets, she's wearing fake eyelashes and just looks trashy
) That day  read the story Holden wrote for me
It was kinda different from the other one, but kinda the same
It was about a woman who was put upon
Whose job was a prison, and whose life had lost all meaning
Other people don't get her, especially her husband
One day she meets a boy who is also put upon, and they fall in love
After spending their whole lives not getting got, with one look they get eachother completely
In the end, the boy and the girl run away together in the wilderness, never to be heard from again
