" " Screenplay by Tom Butterworth and Jez Butterworth : In a Russian summer meadow, a young girl spins around and around
simple guitar theme plays as the low sun catches her hair
Around her neck is a pair of field binoculars, and she runs through the meadow with them pressed to her face, spying butterflies, birds, rabbits
She reaches the top of a hillock, and jumps into the air, and flies up into the sky
We float up and up with her as she aims the binoculars up, up, into the sun
: An aerial shot of the rolling English countryside
Nothing but fields and trees for miles
The shot describes a panorama before looking directly down, at the earth, and we begin to move
We fly low over a field, a ditch and straight out over six lanes of motorway
Cars and lorries tear below at a hundred miles an hour
We fly over the hard shoulder to another field beyond
We descend on two young boys in the field
pornographic magazine is spread out of the flattened grass
One of the boys puts a match to the centre page and as the flames lick up, we begin to move again, across the field, over a path and into a suburban garden
We fly over five or six gardens, over a barbecue, over children splashing in a pool, over a woman sunbathing, a man mowing his lawn, a young boy bouncing up and down on a garden trampoline, to arrive on the patio of John Buckingham
He walks out onto the patio, where he sits in a chair, facing his house, setting down a mug of tea
: blurred face sharpening into focus, John Buckingham, about thirty-two, sitting on his patio, his garden behind, fields beyond
Hello
His hand adjusts a microphone on his lapel
Hello, hello
Hello
He shifts in his chair
Coughs
He looks straight at us
don't believe in perfect love
You know, love that comes out of the sky like a thunderbolt and uh
This is ridiculous
He removes the microphone
He sits there, thinking very hard
No
No no no
Nope
He stands, turns and stretches
: : He is sitting as before, looking at us
Running
Reading
Going out
Staying in
The countryside
Films, if they're good
: : Thoughtful
Outgoing
Ambitious
Well-read
Reasonably popular
Balanced
Trusting
Quite attractive
Outgoing
: : Someone intelligent, of course
Kind
Pretty  suppose
But its not critical
'  - John watches while two removal men lift a new double bed from the back of a van
(
) Someone with a sense of humour
Someone you can communicate with on the same level
Someone you can really talk to
think communication is key
- John's hands smooth a crisp white sheet over the double mattress
An ant runs across the sheet
John squashes it and picks it carefully off
(
) think that by the time most people turn thirty they know where they're going
: - John encircles his house, leaving a thick trail of yellow powder behind him
(
) And where they've been
suppose they have some baggage stroke history
- We see that John is talking to his
It has a small digital camera on the side
We all have someone in our past who uh
one skeleton, if you like
We've all got at least one person, as it were, under the patio
Not literally of course
suppose only say this because  always thought people who did this sort of thing were
had an image that they were losers
Not losers
bit sad
But  think this is the modern world
And  think really it's quite a brave move
Quite a brave, reasonable thing to do
He smiles
Sorry can we start again
: John's fingers in close-up, type  , and his number into his
Finished, he stops, and rests his face on his hands
He hits
That instant, a worry of black crows bursts up in the field behind him and takes to the swirling air
Blackout
Music
Titles
The titles pop and slide over footage of Russian women, on computer video, advertising themselves
They mostly speak in Russian, some of which is subtitled, some speak in English
The women slide on and off the screen, overlap and collide, as the titles appear
Close-ups on mouths and eyes, tight and pixellated
It becomes a wall of image and sound
: - The   of a Boeing 747  down the screen
- John slides across the screen, motionless, towards Arrivals
-
Last calls for flights leaving for the other side of the world
Travellers criss-cross and swirl
- 1880  On time
- He dries his face with a paper towel, then checks himself in the mirror
He looks okay, a little white
- The Arrivals gate slides open and passengers flood through
John stands among the chauffeurs and cab drivers, as the passengers trundle by
We follow one young woman long enough to think this must be her, but it's a false alarm, she's lifted up and spun around by someone else
They've all passed
That's that
She wasn't on the flight
John wanders away from the gate
He stands about in the swirl in the middle of the airport
People bustle by
Everyone going somewhere
Gradually, we get the sense we are being watched
woman stands nearby
She is about twenty, very beautiful, tired and laden with luggage
Nadia
She nods
'm John
They shake hands
Welcome
(pause) Well
Look  didn't have a speech but
distorted passenger announcement breaks above us
It's too loud to talk
It ends and they stand there in silence
He points to her luggage
Is that everything
Yes
Right
Okay
Good
They stand there
- Nadia and John stand side by side in a huge lift
We can talk in the car
deafening roll of thunder
- It's pouring with rain as they cross the car park towards a patched up yellow Rover
John stows the suitcase in the boot and opens the passenger door for her
/
'  () - John turns the key in the ignition
The  wheezes and coughs
He tries again
Nothing
The third time it just catches and he coaxes it to life
The colour's drained from his cheeks
They head for the motorway
The silence in the car lasts just long enough for John to feel he is breaking it
It's about forty miles from here don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself
Roman city
It's a nice house
'm having a problem with ants
uh
It's the warmer weather
can't seem to find the nest
Sorry, do you understand "ants"
Yes
just can't find a nest
The root of the problem
've looked everywhere
What's the Russian for ant
Sorry that's a stupid
Sorry
This is strange isn't it
Yes
'm pretty nervous
Are you
Yes
mean
"Ants
" "'ve got a problem with ants
" He shakes his head
had this
He pulls a sign from his jacket which says "Nadia
" As a joke but uh
He tosses it onto the back seat
They drive
He sees Nadia looking at England
So
Is it different to how you imagined it
Yes
bet
(pause) What about me
Am  how you imagined
Yes
He double-takes, changes lanes
And how was the flight
Sorry, am speaking too fast for you
Yes
John looks across
Do uh
Sorry
Can you follow me
Do you understand what 'm saying
Yes
Good
Or should  speak slower
Yes
Do you follow or should  speak slower
Yes
He looks across
Back at the road
He changes gear
Uh
Are you a giraffe
Yes
John turns to face the road ahead
(to himself) Oh Jesus
He drives in silence
Oh Jesus
Suddenly she winds the window down and vomits out of the speeding car
John panics and swerves onto the hard shoulder amidst loud horn blasts
- John navigates his way round the Rover in the rain to find her kneeling on the verge, throwing up
He puts a hand on her shoulder, but she stands up quickly, maintaining an icy dignity considering what has just happened
'  - It has stopped raining and a group of young boys are playing cricket in the road
They clear as a Yellow Rover pulls into the Close, and into the drive of the little house at the end
As John climbs out of his car he eyes the boys
The boys eye him, and his new friend
'  - The front door closes behind them
John and Nadia stand in the silence of his hallway
There is a small banner hanging there: "Welcome Nadia"
They study the banner together, gravely
Eventually he opens a door
(quietly) Lounge
She peers round him and looks inside
He leads her down towards the kitchen
Kitchen
She glances around it
Then back at John
He nods to himself, looking tense and pale
'   - He puts her suitcase down on the landing, and opens a door
Without looking inside: Bathroom
He closes it
- Standing in the doorway of John's bedroom
Bedroom
There it is
The Double Bed
John frowns gravely
Without warning, he marches out
She comes out onto the landing to catch John plus suitcase kicking open another door and vanishing inside
- Nadia peers around the door to find John standing next to a narrow monk-like single bed
The uh
the other bedroom
She looks at it, then up at John
She turns and walks out
Now she's back, with her camouflaged hold-all, dumps it onto the floor, heaves the suitcase onto the bed and smoking no- hands, starts unpacking
John plugs in the lamp by the bed
To show Nadia how it works he switches it on, off, on, off, and then feels stupid
'll get an ashtray
With John gone, Nadia stops unpacking
She walks to the window and stares out over the rooftops of the estate
: - John on the phone
You have reached From Russia with Love
Our office reopens on Monday
If you are interested in our services
(etc
etc
) Thank You
This is John Buckingham from St Albans
need to speak to you urgently
There's a critical problem
It's
Call me back as soon as possible
It's critical
/  - John climbs the stairs holding a saucer for an ashtray
He knocks lightly on the spare room door
/  - Nadia is lying asleep on the bed in only her black underwear
We duck straight back out
John composes himself
He puts his head back round the door as if there's a real chance it will be shot off
She's facing away, arms folded, still holding the cigarette
It has burnt out, leaving a long curl of ash on her bare hip
He approaches the bed with immense trepidation, eases the cigarette from between her fingers and drops it in the bin
He stares at her bare hip, with the ash on it
Holding the saucer under the ash, he blows on it gently
It takes three careful breaths before it drops in the saucer
Unseen by John, her eyes are wide open as he steals out onto the landing
We stay with her a moment
: pot of stew, bubbling on the hob
- John is stirring a pot on the hob
By his expression he might be defusing a bomb
His head cocks, he stiffens
Nadia walks right into the kitchen
She's changed, jeans and a tee shirt
Nadia takes the spoon from him, says something in Russian, gestures for him to sit
She tastes the stew
Now she stirs the pot
He watches her
: - John and Nadia sit opposite each other
She takes a mouthful
They catch one another's eye
And again
On the wall across, six ants careen in crazy circles
John can see them, but doesn't move
He puts his fork down
don't know what to say
Your letters were in English
Good English
You said you'd studied English
Nadia reaches down into her bag and pulls out a small box wrapped in brown paper
She places it in front of him
He warily unwraps a little wooden box
He opens the lid and fishes out a simple gold ring
He holds it in his palm
can't take this
He puts it back in the box, hoping it will disappear
She fishes it out again and holds it on her palm for him to take
can't take it
'm not really a ring guy
She takes his hand
He automatically yanks it away like he's been burned
She takes his hand again and to stop it becoming unbearable, he allows Nadia to push the ring onto his ring finger
It goes on easily
Okay
No big deal
Thank you
Yes thanks
Thank you
- John and Nadia sit next to each other on the couch watching John's gaze seems to go through the
and a thousand yards beyond
Nadia is knitting a half-finished jumper, blood red
John stands and disappears out of shot
(
) If anyone gets this message please call as soon as possible
It's an emergency
John sits back down
He steals side-glances at her
Her mouth
Her red-painted fingers knitting fast
John flips through the channels -- The Money Programme
Antique's Roadshow
Cup Rugby
Eventually he offers Nadia the remote control
She takes, aims it at the
but doesn't press it
Just as it seems she won't, she does: University Challenge
They watch University Challenge with Nadia still aiming the control and smoking
After another long pause she flips the button -- The Money Programme
Antiques Roadshow
Rugby
She flips again then hands the controls back to John and they watch University Challenge
Nadia puts down her knitting, stretches and yawns
/  - Nadia climbs the stairs
John watches her, hovering in the doorway of the darkened lounge
He hears the bathroom door close before venturing up
- John sits on the edge of his bed
He cocks his head: Door opening and shutting; feet padding along landing; door closing
Silence
He squeezes his door open and peers down the dark landing
The coast is clear
- Brushing his teeth, staring accusingly at his reflection
Spits
Finished, he takes a deep breath and opens the door, and gives a small shout
Nadia is standing right outside the door; Nightshirt, damp hair, toothbrush in her mouth
Good night
He squeezes past and quick-steps down the landing
- He climbs into the big bed, fully clothed, turns off the light and lies there in the moonlight
After twenty seconds, the bedroom door clicks open
John climbs out of bed as casually as possible and stands around
You should go now
We'll talk in the morning
His eyes widen but he can't speak
He wants to but she's placed her hand across his mouth
She reaches down and takes his hand, and draws it towards her, slowly tracing his fingers across her breasts
She unbuttons her shirt and pulls his hand inside
He's breathing hard, her right hand still clasped over his mouth
Her free hand lowers to press against him, and unzip his fly
He lets out a moan
We concentrate on their faces
Above the silence all we can hear is John's breathing -- Before long Nadia looks down -- He's come
Nadia turns and walks out, leaving John marooned, gasping in and blowing out, angry almost, buttoning his trousers
'  - Exterior view of John's darkened house
fox trots across the Cul-De-Sac and sits under John's car, where it curls up
'  - John lying in bed staring out at a streetlight
'  - The morning
Nadia opens her eyes in the sun-filled room
- She pads down the hall in her nightshirt and opens the door to the bathroom
There on the toilet, naked, is John
He gives another short shout
Nadia holds his eye for a couple of seconds too long, before shutting us inside with him
'  - John sprints down his lawn, scattering the big black crows eating his garden
He jumps the fence, and across the fields
- John jogs along by a river in the countryside behind his house, wearing shorts and a tee shirt
His breath billows around him in the sharp morning air
He stops running by a gate overlooking a small hill
He doubles up to recover, panting hard
'  - Two wild rabbits are nibbling the remains of a big breakfast left on the lawn
John climbs heavily back over his fence
There's a deck chair out there, surrounded by the remains of breakfast
Some glossy Russian magazines, a full ashtray, Nadia's knitting
The patio door is ajar, the net curtain billowing
He scans the garden jumpily
The boy next door is on his trampoline, bouncing up and down, watching John at the top of each bounce
'  - Sweating from the run, John peers up the stairs
The house is silent
In the lounge he picks up the phone and dials a number
You have reached From Russia With Love
If you are interested
He hangs up
- John stands with his ear to the bathroom door
The shower's on
'  - It's empty
He slips inside
Stuff everywhere
Cigarette cartons, several lighters, spare wool, suitcase, rucksack
Huge poster of Bruce Springsteen on wall
Warily, he opens the bedside drawer: Different coloured bras and knickers
In her open suitcase lies a small wooden chest
He lifts it out and puts it on the bed, hesitates, then opens it
pair of Russian Army field binoculars
He puts them on the bed beside him
small silver pistol, the size of a Derringer
He studies it, and pulls the trigger
It's a cigarette lighter
brochure of prospective husbands provided by the marriage agency
After a dozen or so photos he comes across his page but the photo has been cut out
He sees his name in the strange lettering, under the hole
- Nadia in the shower, eyes shut, water pouring over her face
'  - John flicks through a stack of photographs
One of Nadia as a young girl in a meadow, with binoculars around her neck -- John looks at the same binoculars on the bed next to him
He turns them over in his hands
He looks through them
He slowly lowers them
He's seen something
He stands and crosses the room
On the mantelpiece, in a silver frame, is his picture, cut from the brochure
He holds it in his hands
The shower has stopped
In a panic he replaces the picture, the photographs, the gun lighter, the brochure, and the binoculars
- Nadia leaves the bathroom, hair wrapped in a towel, and heads straight towards us
'  - John shuts the chest, drops it back into the suitcase
The photo of the binoculars girl is on the pillow
He whips it under the bed just as Nadia enters
She doesn't seem surprised to see him standing there, in her room, in his tee shirt and running shorts
Nadia
This isn't going to work
'm sorry
It's been a terrible mistake
You must go
He takes the ring off and holds it out to her
She doesn't take it
He puts it on the bed
'm booking a flight for tomorrow
'm sorry
John and Nadia on her bed, Nadia tearing off his tee shirt
She gets on top
'  - The milkman hops a low fence between two houses
He waves to a man watering his rose trees
'  - John and Nadia having sex
They don't take their eyes off each other
'  - mother corrals her school children into a Volvo
They don't want to go
'  - John sits on the edge of the bed, holding his head in his hands
The door has just shut behind him
He looks at his left hand
He has the ring on
Problem solving
John identifies most problems within appropriate time frames
,   - The large oak doors of the bank swing open
Most of the time he develops several alternative solutions to problems
We move fast through the banking hall to the furthest counter
The blind snaps up to reveal John, wearing a smart suit
He usually resolves or minimises most problems before they grow into larger problems
- John's skilled hands loading a stack of banknotes into a drawer
The cashier next along, Clare, smiles at him
Good weekend
Uh
Yeah
Pretty good
Do anything special
Uh
No
Communications
John listens and comprehends well
'  - John sits in front of a large desk, hands on knees
(
) When communicating he is good at selecting the most efficient methods and displays effective verbal communication skills
Across the desk the Branch Manager reads a report out loud in an impersonal, flat manner
On one occasion John showed first class communication skills in a delicate customer situation
'  - Nadia opens a kitchen cupboard and stares inside at John's groceries
(
) Initiative
John is reasonably quick to volunteer whenever others need help
Although he is sometimes reluctant and or unwilling to ask for it himself
She opens some pickled onions and pops one in her mouth
- Cradling the jar of onions, she scans his bookshelf
(
) He is adequate at resolving difficult or emotional customer situations
Bluffers guide to the Internet
She opens an old copy of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe
Inside is written 'John Buckingham Class 3F'
(
) He usually fulfills commitments made to customers within expected time frames
'  - She opens the wardrobe
In a shoebox she finds some photos
(
) Customer Service
John shows a high degree of respect for customers
One of John as a little boy, holding a football, flanked by his parents
On the back someone has written "Summer 1973"
(
) John still has some reluctance to / or has problems in, carving out new relationships face to face
There is a photo of John, about three years ago, arm in arm with a plain, thin-looking girl, with small eyes
Another of him kissing her on the cheek
'  - John listening
Judgment -- John makes able decisions in most areas of his job
'  - Nadia sees something at the bottom of the cupboard
She bends down to retrieve a black dustbin liner
She reaches in and pulls out a small stack of hardcore pornographic magazines
(
) John follows instructions conscientiously and responds well to personal directions
She upends the bag and a half dozen videos fall out
She picks up a magazine and begins flicking through it impassively
- Nadia downstairs kneels in front of the
and slips a video into the machine
Nadia's face is lit up by the screen
The sound of sex
(
) John is normally very punctual and in most situations assumes responsibility for his own actions and outcomes
She pops a pickled onion in her mouth, and watches
We see the images close and pixellated, as we did the marriage videos in the titles
It's a bondage scene, the woman wears a gag
'  - John back in the room
The report has finished and the manager is scrutinising him in silence
Thank you --  think that's very fair
/
'  () - John drives his Rover through the centre of town, the low orange sun on his face
'  - The Rover pulls into the driveway
John opens the glove compartment and removes the ring Nadia gave him, and puts it back on
He collects a brown paper package from the passenger seat
'  - John and Nadia at the supper table
She is knitting the jumper
Despite the silence, John seems more relaxed, in shirtsleeves and loosened tie
He puts his fork down, and places the brown bag on the table, pushing it across to Nadia
She opens it and removes a big hardback Russian - English dictionary
John smiles and nods "open it"
She flicks through it
She turns it over in her hands, nods, puts the book down, reaches under the table and surfaces with the stack of porn magazines
She puts them on the table next to the dictionary
John beholds the pile
"Wet ' Wild" is on top
He rises slowly from the table and sleepwalks from the kitchen
'  /  /  /  - John, frozen-headed, floats down the hall, up the stairs into the bathroom, locks the door, sits on the toilet
'  - Downstairs Nadia clears, the dishes
The porn stack still sits on the table, beside the dictionary
- Still on the toilet
He hasn't moved
He closes his eyes
- It's dark
The bathroom door opens a crack
The coast clear, he dashes for the cover of his bedroom
- John rests his head against the doorframe and heaves a sigh of relief
He turns and freezes
Nadia is there next to him
She slowly loosens his tie
Holding it in her hands she examines the strange little bank logo on it, before deliberately tying the tie over her mouth like a gag
second tie is pulled from a hanger in the cupboard
Quickly and skillfully she ties her hands together, pulling it tight with her teeth
Finished, she flicks her hair back, and gives him a long, level look
It will feel very strange at first but then you get used to it
: - close up of John's face
He closes his eyes, falls backwards, and is caught in the arms of a colleague
Good
Again
John stands again and closes his eyes
After a short wait he falls back and again his colleague catches him just before he hits the ground
Very good
How does that feel John
It feels good
Weird
It's called Trust and Letting Go
John nods
Trust and Letting Go
simple guitar theme begins, and plays over the following sequence: Kids playing cricket in John's Close
boy hits the ball and others chase it as it bounces off cars
John at dusk tied to the bed with his two bank ties
Nadia is on top
They are having sex
Hands stacking bank notes into the back of a cash machine
Fast, mechanical
At the bank, John walks to his desk
His phone rings
He answers it
Silence
Then soft breathing
John listens intently and looks around
"Nadia
" -- John sits there, surrounded by his colleagues, listening to Nadia breathe
Close up on a man's hands tying a tie tight a-round a woman's wrist
Pull back to a close up of Nadia's face, her eyes fixed on John
John running by the river
John watches Nadia rise from his bed after sex and leave the room
He stares out the window
Nadia's fingers, knitting skillfully
Nadia sits on her bed alone, pulling on black stockings and attaching them to suspenders
The street cricketers run for cover as a thunder storm breaks over the close
Rain coming down in John's garden
The pair sit under the shelter of the back porch
John has his hands out as Nadia is winding red wool it into a ball
The jumper is half finished
The rabbits shelter from the rain under broad leaves
John in a pub with a four colleagues from the bank
He sips his half, half listening to the conversation
It all seems so dull
He finishes his drink and looks at his watch
They ask him if he's staying for another
knitting needle is drawn from a row of red stitches on the nearly-finished jumper
Nadia kneels over John holding the knitting needles
She presses one to his skin and we watch it drawn across his chest in close up, up to his neck
His eyes are fixed on hers
Close up on Nadia's face
Her mouth is gagged and she's lying on her front, head half-buried in a pillow
We can just make out John behind, on top of her
Both are lying still and breathing hard, covered in sweat
Catching her breath Nadia yanks the gag off and wriggles out from underneath him
She snatches up a towel and covering herself hurries to the bathroom
The guitar theme ends
- John presses his ear to the bathroom door
The sound of retching
The toilet flushes
John pads back to his bedroom
Through the gap in the door he sees Nadia coming out, go to her room, and shut the door
He rests his head against the door frame
: - beautiful morning
Through the patio window, John watches Nadia in the garden, sitting on the lawn reading her dictionary in the sunlight
In dungarees with her hair up, she looks very young
- He walks warily out into the sunlight
She looks up, then back to the big book in her lap
He places the tea next to her on the grass
Are you
She looks at him, then down at her tome
She speaks slowly, in a heavy accent: Today is bath day
Sorry
She studies her book
Looks up
Today is bath day
He shakes his head
Bath day
She nods
don't understand
Happy bath day
The penny drops
Today
She frowns
John leafs through the dictionary
Syevodnya
Syevodnya Happy Birthday
Happy Birthday
He puts his hand on her shoulder
Party
(pause) Party
Syevodnya
John nods, smiling
Yes
Party
Party syevodnya
She lights a cigarette from the butt of her last
Blows smoke
She holds the jumper up to John, as if to try it for size, and the theme returns
- John is on the telephone
It might just be a twenty-four hour bug
- Clare listens, concerned
Well you just get better
'll tell Beaky
You just get some rest, ok
- John puts the phone down
He looks down the hall, where Nadia is killing ants on the table, with her dictionary
He smiles
'  - shot from above, of the Rover's windscreen, reflecting the passing trees
The roof is down
We glide up the windscreen, up Nadia's body, in the passenger seat
Her face is upturned slightly, she's wearing sunglasses, which reflect the passing trees
'  - Nadia sits alone at the dining room table
Suddenly the lights go out
John enters, carrying a small birthday cake glowing with candles
The light throws huge shadows on the walls and flickers across their faces
He sets the cake down on the table and sits down opposite Nadia Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday dear Nadia
The front doorbell rings
loud long burst
Nadia's face transforms into a big grin
She hurries out into the hall, leaving John alone with the cake
Nadia whooping and shouting excitedly
Other voices
Shouting
Shouting in Russian
man bursts in carrying Nadia in his arms
He spins her round in the candlelight, kisses her, puts her down and goes to the table where he blows out the candles
They are plunged into darkness
Lots of whooping and laughing
Zippo flares up and illuminates some faces, all laughing
: John's hand groping along the wall
It finds the light switch
There are two men here
One small and wiry, one big and dark, like Rasputin
They each carry rucksacks and a guitar case
You must be John
You seem very nice
Excuse me
In Russian, the first man introduces Nadia to the other man, who is relighting the candles with a Zippo
It seems they haven't met before
The first man, Yuri, pulls out a bottle of vodka and hands it to John
How's that
We can't drink our piss can we
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates
What are you doing here
Yuri stops
Sorry
You've lost me
'm asking what you're here for
What
Yuri speaks to Nadia in fast Russian
(to John) You don't speak Russian
Pratsteetye
This explains your cold eyes
Nadia begins gabbling to Yuri in Russian
Yuri says the English word -- "Friends"
(to John) "Frenzy"
Yes  know
(himself) Yuri
(Rasputin) Alexei
Alexei and Yuri
Alexei speaks
What did he say
He says he feels safe here
Nadia talks fast to Yuri
She says she wanted to tell you but her English is shit
And no one speaks Russian, it's very hard for her
The light please
Alexei turns off the light again
Nadia blows out her candles
They are plunged back into darkness
John turns the light on again
Yuri is already sitting down

Oh

And what
You mean from the beginning

Except she's not
But we say cousin
This is for you
He hands John another bottle of vodka
Hold on
Toast first then we talk seriously, can see you are serious about us
Vodka is splashed into their glasses
Yuri raises his glass and shouts a toast in Russian: "Vashe Zdarovye
"
They down their vodka, John sips at his, then realises he must finish it
Yuri makes as if to throw his in the fireplace
Just kidding
Sausages, cheese, bread and pickle bottles rain onto the table from Yuri's rucksack
(to Yuri) So hang on
You're both Nadia's cousins
(shaking his head) Of course not
Alexei, he's is my problem
Right

He's crazy

Pause
So

Yuri speaks to Nadia in Russian, she replies looking at John
What was that
asked her if you were happy to see us
find it hard to tell with you
Yes it's okay
Thank you for the food
Nadia lights a cigarette
John notices that on both wrists she has bold red marks from the ties
He freezes
She says you are a little shy think  know this
John is thrown, panicking that one of them will notice the marks
So how long will you be in England
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth
You must have a visa or something
You're asking for my documents
No, no
Yuri laughs, translates for Alexei and they both get a big laugh out of this
Yuri gets his passport out and makes a big show of presenting it to John
But John keeps glancing at the marks on Nadia's wrists
We see a close up of her neck
There is the tiniest blood mark
John sees it and starts to sweat
We are all Europeans here
Europe, Tony Blair and Maggie Thatcher
Yuri raises his glass and they all drink to Tony Blair and Margaret Thatcher
John drinks his vodka in two hot gulps
So
You have nothing to say to your Fiancee
Maybe to wife of forty years it's understandable
Come on
You speak and  will translate
John looks glazed
The room falls silent
Hello
Yuri translates -- She replies
She says 'Hello' to you
Go for it John
Uh
Do you like England
Classic
(he translates) Thank God
She says 'Yes
' John nods
He watches Nadia tap ash
The wrist again
Uh
They all wait
Yuri nods encouragingly
can't think of anything
Hang on
Nadia speaks in Russian to Yuri
She says she has a secret to tell
What
Nadia speaks
John waits uncomfortably
Silence
She says she watched you at the airport
John stops
When
(translating) " saw you waiting there, by the gate
" " have these uh
" She explains to you
"When  was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses
" Like
don't know the word
Like for watching uh
for watching the birds
We see John's face
Binoculars
Binoculars
He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war
: Scene 1 reprise
- young girl runs through a summer meadow with a pair of Russian Army field binoculars, around her neck
(
) would run around with them taking pictures of things  liked with my mind
If  saw something beautiful would take a picture
With the binoculars pressed to her face, she spies butterflies, birds, a rabbit
She stops running and aims the binoculars up, up, into the sun '   - Yuri translates
The day before  left Russia my father gave me the old binoculars
He said that when  saw you  was to stand far away and look at you with these, and to examine your face closely
And if you were a bad person  could run away
Nadia looks at the table
She says she took a picture
John watches Nadia looking at the table
She glances up once and catches his eye
Alexei suddenly slams his hand down on the table
He raises his palm
There is an ant squashed there
He shows Yuri
Nasyekski
'  - The small party has moved outside to the patio, where they sit around a low wooden table in the mellow candlelight huge late Summer moon hangs over the fields
Alexei tinkles beautifully on his guitar
He stops asks a question in Russian
What was that
Oh nothing
Tell me
No
It is too judgmental
Tell me what he said
He says why did you send to Russia for a wife
Silence
John suddenly looks sick
You are not ashamed of it
It's no surprise to want to love
No
It's not that
Do you believe in love
suppose it's
mean define your terms
It's very strange
How many people are truly themselves with their love
It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers
There are no Marches Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment
We look away
And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us
The one thing we all share but don't say
Look John  will show you something
He takes a plate and starts reaching for the food
Here look, something beautiful from Russia
Here is Life, there, take it
John accepts the plate
Here is bread
Khylep
This is work
We all need this, here eat
John eats
Good
But we cannot survive with just work, so here is meat and blood
Myasa
This is family and country, flesh, strength, eat
John bites the sausage
But again this is not life
Here is joy and pain
Chyesnok
Without these life has no flavour, is too serious
Eat
John nibbles some pickled garlic
But this vodka
(pause) Is love
Only this magic changes you inside
The moon and the stars and the sun
Yuri offers John the glass
He looks at Nadia, takes it and swigs it down in one
He looks across at Nadia, wiping his mouth, his eyes watering
She looks back at him
Alexei begins softly singing a song
As he sings: This is a love song, a soldier's song to his beloved -- Alexei, he's Afghanstya, a veteran of Afghanistan
He saw terrible things
They listen to the beautiful, sad voice
For the second verse Yuri joins in, a slow stirring lament
For the end Nadia joins in too and the three of them begin harmonising beautifully
John watches in the candlelight
John, Nadia and Alexei pose with the cake
Nadia puts her arm round John and Alexei
With a
Yuri takes a Polaroid
The guitar theme returns as we see the Polaroid on the table in close up, developing speeded up
John comes into focus, beaming
- We track across the sleeping faces of Yuri and Alexei tucked into their sleeping bags with guitar cases for pillows
John switches the light off and closes the door
'  - John and Nadia seen from above lying asleep, with their heads together, in the moonlight
Nadia whispers something in her sleep, in Russian
Fast asleep John mutters something in English
Their sleeping, unintelligible conversation, drifts on in the night
- John sits at his desk in the open plan office
He looks nervous
This is because he is wearing Nadia's ring
People pass his desk, a couple say hello, but they don't notice
He rubs his chin
Nobody notices
Eventually his manager approaches
Quick word John
He leans over the desk
This is sensitive
Your car
Lovely car
Doesn't necessarily give the right impression
Ch
To customers approaching the bank from the rear (thrown) Right
You can see why it's sensitive
Uh
Yes
The manager smiles and taps the desk twice
'll leave it on your desk
John is left alone
/   - The front door opens and John walks into his hall
The two rucksacks are still side by side where they were the night before
- He opens the fridge and pours himself a glass of orange
He stops -- There on the draining board lies the bloody skin of a rabbit
John jumps out of his skin
Next to the rabbit skin is a hand-drawn map
dotted line winds around the map and ends with an  in a small wood
He looks at the rabbit skin, with its eyeless sockets
- John follows a path through a big silent wood, the low sun flaring and catching his white work shirt
through binoculars, a long way off and squinting into the sun
Nadia lowers the binoculars and looks past us
: John spots some figures lying on the grass in the distance
He heads towards them, and watches them for a moment from thirty yards away
Alexei, Yuri and Nadia sit in a small clearing
blanket, cushions, bread and vodka are scattered around
Yuri is strumming a guitar
Alexei and Nadia are laughing and chatting
He removes a small twig from her hair and flattens it under his big hand
John watches the gesture
It's so intimate they could be lovers
(calls) John
We can see you hiding
John steps out of his hiding place and approaches the group
Alexei has Nadia falling about laughing about something
He smiles at her then nods to John
Pieces of cooked rabbit lie in tin foil
Alexei feeds a piece to Nadia with a big hunting knife
Nadia smiles at John, and starts knitting
How is bank
Fine
thought you were leaving today
To be indoors on such a day
It's crime
Nadia stops knitting and takes her shirt off and stretches back to sunbathe in her black bra
Alexei takes the knife he has just finished cleaning and holds the cold wide blade flat above Nadia's bare stomach
Just before pressing it down he looks across at John
Nadia yelps and sits up
They laugh, and Yuri joins in
John laughs uneasily
Alexei notices marks on Nadia's midriff
He asks her about them in Russian
John goes white, unable to understand Nadia's explanation
He has no idea what she told him
- At sunset, the four run towards a lake in their underwear
They jump and dive in, and begin splashing each other
John duck-dives under the water and swims through the sunlit streaked green water
We see him under the water, swimming towards us, caught by the sun's rays
John surfaces, and wipes the water from his eyes
He spots Alexei and Nadia playing in the water
Alexei grabs her and throws her in the air and she comes down with a splash
John treads water nearby
He watches them both hold their noses and disappear under the surface
They've both vanished
John ducks under the water
John's underwater
: It's too murky to see anything
The two surface, breathing hard, laughing
John watches them
Alexei holds Nadia tight and looks like he might even kiss her
But instead he ducks her and holds her under the water
John treads water nearby
She's been under a long time
Hey
John begins to swim toward Alexei
Just as he gets near, Alexei lets Nadia surface, coughing and spluttering -- she shouts at Alexei in Russian, angry
Alexei makes for her again but she pushes him away, twice, almost slapping him
She is very uncomfortable
She swims away
Yuri admonishes his friend in Russian
Alexei stares at John, then swims off powerfully back towards the shore
He's just having fun
He's maybe too strong you know
John watches Nadia walk out of the lake towards her clothes
- John walks into his bedroom
Nadia is on the bed with a dictionary
She puts it down
She speaks very slowly
They go
John
They go
What's wrong
They go
Of course
They go
Yes
Yes
They go
'   - John stands at the end of the two sleeping bags
understand
'm so sorry You can stay tonight
have brought you trouble
Maybe should have come alone
Good night
Alexei stares at John as he backs out of the room
'  - John closes his bedroom door and slips back into bed
Nadia is already asleep
John lies back in the moonlight, and stares at the ceiling
- light summer rain
Drips fall from rose petals
'  - John opens his eyes
He rolls over towards Nadia, but she's already up and about
Alone in his bedroom, John holds the now-finished jumper up to himself
He tries it on
It's a good four sizes too big, the arms are too long and it hangs down to mid-thigh
He looks at himself in the mirror and smiles
: /  /  - He pads downstairs in his pants, picks up his mail from the doormat and peers into the living room
The sleeping bags and guitar cases have gone
About to peruse his mail, his eye is caught by something else
There is a small wild deer standing in the living room
Looking at him
John stares back at it transfixed, when he hears a scream
The deer starts and bolts out of the patio doors
John is thrown
It was a woman's scream
He goes back out and looks down the hall
Twenty feet away, down the hall, is Yuri, sitting on the kitchen floor, his back to the cooker
He's crying
John
You must call the Police
Suddenly Alexei steps between them in the doorway
As he moves out of view, we see he is holding his hunting knife
John hears Nadia cry out, from inside the kitchen
He drops his mail and rushes forward
- Nadia is tied to a chair
Alexei pulls a gag tight around her mouth and holds the knife to her throat
What are you doing
Alexei shouts at Yuri in Russian
John, 'm sorry
It's my fault
Alexei shouts again
Nadia is frozen with terror
What's he doing
What the fuck are you doing
Leave her alone
Alexei addresses John
He says sit down
Or he'll cut her
Alexei and Yuri shout at each other
Nadia begins crying
Sit down please
John sits across the table from Nadia
Tell him to stop and let her go, and we'll talk
The kettle boils
Alexei takes the kettle and holds it over Nadia's head
John springs up
Put the fucking kettle down
John
Put the fucking kettle down
Tell, Yuri, tell him put it down or 'm going to make him
Yuri translates -- Alexei replies
He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers
John, he is a soldier
trained killer
We must do what he says
What
What does he want
Alexei speaks
What did he say
Tell me
He says you are very sad ridiculous man
don't agree of course
And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute
Nadia is a prostitute
'm sorry
What does he want
The Russian shithead
What do you want
He wants money
Tell him to put the kettle down and 'll give him money
Yuri translates this for Alexei
Alexei has a reply
He wants a lot of money
'll give him money
Tell him to put the
He wants the money from your bank
'll fuckin' give it to him
We'll go down there
You don't understand
He wants all the money that is in your bank
've got eight hundred pounds
Oh Jesus
The penny drops
Oh Jesus
He is sure you can do this
Of course you can not
Oh Jesus
Of course  can't
Alexei doesn't need the translation he tilts the kettle, and a small amount of boiling water trickles onto Nadia's hair
She screams through the gag
John tries to reach across to her but Alexei draws the knife and holds it to his face
Just leave her alone
'm so sorry
Leave her alone
On Nadia's terrified eyes, imploring John to help her
/
'  - John drives grim-faced through the morning rain
Yuri is next to him staring ahead at the road
Alexei is in the back with Nadia who is still bound and gagged
He's holding his knife to her ribs
-   - The car parks on the top floor
John turns off the engine
He looks at Nadia in his rear view mirror but she seems in shock
- John strides towards us down St
Albans High Street, carrying the two guitar cases, his raincoat flapping
His eyes look glazed, the busy street sounds around him muffled
- The doors slide apart and John enters his branch
The place is full of customers
He cheeks himself through the security door and into the back
-  - John walks through the open plan office
His Branch Manager is there with another bank official, and Clare
Ah John
This is Robert Moseley, Head of South East New Business
Robert, this is John Buckingham
Hello John
Hello
thought you could give us the tour this morning
Sort of be our Indian Guide
Right
(i
e
the guitars) Do you play
Yes
do
That's John
He's always surprising you with hidden talents
used to be in a band
Keyboards
Sort of like very loud, uh -- very loud Marillion
They laugh
Pause
(to John) Well, Maestro, give us a tune
They laugh
Pause
'll give you a tune later
The Branch Manager takes John to one side and stage-whispers
Take the ball and run with it John
- John leads the team down the corridor past the training room where his colleagues are busy with Trust and Letting Go
This is uh
This is the uh
colleague passes carrying a file
Morning John
Give us a tune
'll give you a tune later
- They enter the training room
This is where we're doing Trust and uh
Trust and Letting Go
We're not doing this till the fourth quarter -- Has it, uh -- any results, has it been been beneficial
Yes
It's weird at first
Sort of exciting and frightening at the same time
Wouldn't you say John
Yes
We're starting to see results
This is Karen, who's uh
taking uh
it
They say hello to each other and  asks her a couple of questions
Excuse me
- John nips out and fetches his guitar cases
He rounds the corner, down a couple of steps
He checks himself into the Safe Area
Colleague passes him
Morning John
Hey, Moseley's here
'll give you a tune later
- John punches in the security code
He opens the safe door and goes inside, closing it behind him
We see his stricken face peering through the toughened glass
- Robert Moseley falls backwards into the arms of an employee
It's weird isn't it
little bored perhaps, Moseley gazes out through the open door
He sees
- John bowling out of the safe-room backwards heaving two guitar cases
One bursts open spilling bundles of fifties onto the floor
- Moseley, the Branch Manager, Clare, and five Trust and Letting Go catchers all watch
- John scoops up the money, refasten the case and stand to see them all watching him, as the five Trust and Letting Go fallers crash to the ground in unison
- John hauls ass towards us straight down the middle of the road, a guitar case in either hand, footsteps clapping loudly on the wet cobbles
Alarms sound, dogs bark
- He skis around a corner, and sprints up this other street
We are close by his head, as he sprints one hundred metres
- Running flat out across the car park
Yuri throws open the car door and John hurls the guitar cases inside
He dives in, turns the key in the ignition
The Rover coughs and wheezes
He tries again
It spits and misfires
The third time it catches and lives
John grinds the gears and lurches off
- The Rover hurtles down the ramps
- It careens down a side-street
/
- Alexei opens one of the cases and looks inside
He takes a deep breath and swears in Russian
He shows what is in the case to Nadia
Her eyes widen
Alexei gently lowers the gag and kisses her on the mouth
She returns the kiss hungrily
John spots them in the mirror and nearly crashes the car
He looks desperately across at Yuri
Yuri is now pointing the big knife at John's ribs
The Russian shrugs almost apologetically
In the back seat Nadia has freed herself and is beginning to pull at Alexei's clothes
They begin making out passionately
John's eyes slowly lose focus
He turns grey, then white
He drives and we watch the life seep out of him
- Cars tear through the night along the carriage way, past a Happy Eater
We pan round, across the motorway to a single storey run-down Motel
17 - crusty motel chalet
Yuri and Alexei are sitting on a double bed counting the money
The
is on in the corner with the sound turned down and there are empty miniatures from the mini-bar scattered around
Nadia appears from the kitchenette area
They all seem more relaxed, more themselves, as if what we've seen before was an act
For the first time in the film their conversation appears as English subtitles
So
Alexei says "SSShhh" He is counting in his head
He stops
(to Yuri) You first
Fifty thousand
Almost exactly
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred
There's over eighty thousand here
They look at each other, absorbing the moment
Sweet Jesus
He lies back on the bed and chuckles
Put it in the cases
Split it up
And don't forget you owe me 150
What for
You know what for
No  don't
got you those trousers from Paul Smith
've been buying you stuff all week
've been buying him stuff all week
Such as
Nadia is smiling at them as they squabble
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe
Who paid
When we went to see 'Cats'
Who paid
Those aren't presents
That's normal friendship stuff paid for those guitar cases
What was 'Cats' like
It was alright
Yeah it was okay
Yeah
It was quite good actually
Some bits  really liked
The sets were good
The sets were excellent
Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size
It was really clever
Yuri goes into the bathroom, leaving Nadia and Alexei alone on the bed
Alexei runs his hand across Nadia's cheek
(softly) So
How many times did you have to fuck him
- Yuri in the bathroom, he undoes his flies pees
At the other end of the bathroom, tied to the bidet, gagged, is John
How you doing
John refuses to meet his eye
Yuri flushes and wipes his hands
'll show you something
It should make all this easier  think
From his back pocket, Yuri takes out an old envelope
He opens it and removes a dozen or so Polaroids
John looks down at the first Polaroid
Nadia, Alexei and a man John doesn't recognise at a birthday party
There is a cake with candles and everyone is smiling
The next picture is the same
And the next
Sometimes Germany, sometimes France, but otherwise the pictures are the same, each 'fiancee' beaming with his arm round Nadia, Alexei looking on
John studies the faces of his fellow dupes and at last comes to his own picture
Despite himself tears come to his eyes
Not all these bastards were like you, believe me
You should not too feel bad
Yuri takes John's left hand and pulls off Nadia's ring
He puts it in his pocket
- Alexei smokes on the bed
Nadia is lying the other way
She holds her hand out for his cigarette and he passes it
They have the relaxed air of longtime lovers
Subtitles again
It's enough isn't it
What do you mean
You know what  mean babe, It's enough
We can stop
Do you want to stop
Yes
We'll stop then
They kiss
He takes her hand, and notices the tie marks on her wrists
What's this
It's nothing
burnt myself
That's not a burn
It is
did it cooking
They sit there looking at each other
On both wrists
Nadia looks back at him
The seconds pass
What
did it cooking
Alexei studies her face
She pulls a face
He keeps staring
What
They sit there in silence
Alexei is so big, and she is so small
Listen,  made you something
Nadia leans over the bed, and searches in her bag
Alexei watches her closely
She comes back up with the jumper she has knitted
Put it on
He looks at the jumper, then back at her
It's taken me weeks
want to see you in it
She starts pulling at his shirt
Eventually he pulls the jumper on
It fits perfectly
Do you like it
Yeah
He is still staring at her
Say thank you
Thank you
She takes his hands
He is still looking at her
He strokes his hair
He places his big hand around her throat and holds it there, holding her at arms length
She doesn't react, but just looks levelly back at him
They sit like this for about ten seconds, looking at each other
We're going to have a baby
Alexei seems not to relax
He keeps his hand there
What
You heard what  said
'm pregnant
've been throwing up for weeks
Alexei removes his hand
Now he seems shocked
He lights a cigarette
We're having a baby
Pause
baby
What are we supposed to do with a baby
Name it
She comes to him and holds him
He is still absorbing the news
We see Alexei's face over her shoulder, behind her back, unreadable
Behind his back she rubs her wrists
- Some hours later, it's dark outside
John still tied to the bidet
The door opens a crack and somebody slips inside
We hear the toilet seat go down
As his eyes adjust he can dimly see Nadia sitting on the toilet
She doesn't look at him
As she finishes she finally turns and holds his eye
She stands and slips out the door, leaving him alone
- Cars crawl by on the road outside, their tail-lights stretching over the hill
The shot processes and fades into dawn and light
The early morning commuters now use the carriageway
- Bright sunlight pours through a high window
John is still on the toilet
He begins to try to struggle free
After a great deal of fierce deadpan shimmying and pulling, he succeeds in loosening his bindings
Freeing an arm, he yanks the duct tape from his mouth and sits there panting
The first thing he does is take a pee, then he drinks handfuls of water
He catches his reflection but can't look at himself
- John collapses in an armchair, rubbing his eyes
He looks shattered
The Russians have gone
- John in the shower, just standing there, letting the water hit him
- John dries himself in silence
He pulls on his trousers, sits down to do his socks
One sock on, he walks to the smaller bedroom
He opens the door and peers inside
- Tied to the radiator, gagged with duct tape, is Nadia
John looks down at her
She looks away as her eyes fill with tears
He sits on the bed facing her
They stay like that for a long moment before he reaches over and starts untying her knots
He peels the tape off her mouth
Suddenly he slaps her across the face
Her head hits the radiator
Nadia gasps hard from the shock of the blow
Without warning she slaps his face, equally hard
This starts a long silent fight; kicking, hitting, biting, a real struggle
Its intensity is almost sexual, but has the edge of real violence
They end up on opposite sides of the room, both panting, hurt and beaten
(in English) Great
You've split my fuckin, lip
John lies there on the floor, panting, and he hears the English words
Exhausted, John stands, wipes his mouth, and rushes her anew
Nadia dodges out the way and cuffs him painfully on the ear
The whole fight starts again and ends only when neither has the strength to go on
Nadia staggers into the bathroom where she shuts the door and begins to sob uncontrollably
John lies on the bed listening to her cry
- The mid morning traffic flows by on the dual carriageway
- Nadia and John sit in silence in the half empty diner
Nadia has a cut lip and a graze on her chin
John has a Thousand Yard Stare and a lesion over his left cheekbone
The Waitress comes over
Good morning
What can  get you
'll have an espresso, with a small pastry, a croissant or something
We only do a croissant with the Continental breakfast
Just get me a coffee
One coffee
And for you Sir
John doesn't answer
He'll have a coffee
The waitress leaves them
Nadia lights a cigarette and they sit in tense silence, the pain of betrayal, and recent violence, thick in the air
You can't smoke in here
Nadia ignores him
John bellows '
The diner falls silent, people stare
She takes a last drag and crushes the butt on the floor
waitress comes over and puts down two coffees
don't expect you to understand
It seems as if John has no intention of replying
He sips his coffee, and puts it down
He begins speaking very calmly
Oh,  don't know
In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals
This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems
But, you see, 'm not in that line of work anymore
Nowadays 'm a bank robber
You don't understand anything
think that about covers it
think have grasped the part about you being dumped though
That's got to hurt,  imagine
That's got to smart a bit
mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously
He sips his coffee
Unless
Unless this is part of the routine
You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee
It's makes it easier
Okay
don't want to know
It makes it faster
If  don't speak to the men, they fall faster
It's pretty obvious why
That's a relief
It's nice to know 'm a regular guy
Pause
So what are you going to do
'm going to drink my coffee
Then, we're going to the police station
Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison
They don't blame you
When a bank employee does this they understand
You get your life back
Anyway  bet you hated that bank
Even so  always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me
Why else would you send off for me
If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute
Well as it turns out  did
She slaps his face
He slaps hers back
The waitress comes over
More coffee
Yes please
No
She pours for John
Splendid
Thank you
Pleasure
She smiles and leaves them
John watches her walk away
John,  need your help
This really tickles John
He has to put his coffee down
You must think
'm the biggest pillock
In the world
No  don't
In the world
know you just want to punish me -- do
want to very badly
So you're just going to be vindictive In every sense
If at all possible
You can't hurt me more than 'm hurt already
Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, 'd like to give it a bash
Pause
My name isn't Nadia
John stares back at her
- John drags her by the arm across the car-park towards the Rover
John drags her out of the Rover
She wrestles her arm free and walks up the steps on her own, with some dignity
John follows her
- They sit side by side in the waiting room, not talking
Nadia looks resigned to her fate
John is tight-jawed, unyielding
They wait as the the Duty Sergeant deals with a woman who's lost her hat
(quietly, to John) Where's the restroom
What
'm going to be sick
Where's the
What
No you're not
'm going
am
'm going to be sick
(overlapping) No you're not
How
Nice one
How dumb do you think  am
Nadia stands and addresses the Duty Sergeant
Where's the restroom
The what, love
The toilet
Where's
Down there on the left
She heads off
John springs up
He seizes her arm as casually as possible
- John frog marches Nadia down the corridor to the Ladies
She wrestles her arm free again and disappears inside
John lurks outside
He seems certain she's got one leg out the window
He can't bear it any longer
He looks both ways and nips inside
- Standing in the Ladies, John hears Nadia in a cubicle, throwing up
He hears the toilet flush
Nadia comes out
He looks at her
You're pregnant
Nadia looks at the floor
- John walks out of the toilet and stands against the wall of the corridor
He looks both ways
After a few seconds Nadia appears in the corridor
They stand there
John isn't looking at her
policeman appears from round the corner, and walks towards them
He stops, and addresses John
Can  help you
John looks at the Policeman, then at Nadia
The seconds pass
Sir
Can  help you
John is still looking at Nadia -- He closes his eyes
No
- John walks back to the Rover, Nadia behind
They reach the car
Nadia looks at John over the roof of the car
What are you doing
John looks sick
He speaks very quietly
Get in the car
He gets inside
Nadia is left standing there
She gets in too
/
'  - John driving with Nadia in the passenger seat
She is looking across at him
He is taking no notice
Plenty of women have babies in prison
John ignores her
(tersely) You don't have to do this
can look after myself
(flatly) Have you got your passport
What
Shut up
Have you got your passport
Yes
They drive along
We've got to get off this motor-way
- From above we watch the car turn off the motorway, around a roundabout and into a country  road
- John is turning the pages in his Road Atlas
He is trying to drive and map read at the same time
Nadia is looking out of the window
Soon a big tear rolls down her cheek
She starts to cry
John glances up from his map but ignores it
But she keeps crying
He tosses the map in the back, pulls the car to the side of the road and switches off the engine
As Nadia cries, John gazes impassively out of the window
This goes on for almost a minute, until Nadia pulls herself together, when without looking across John restarts the engine and pulls away
- John's car pulling off a  road, into a slip road into a garage
- Stern-faced, John fills the car up with petrol
He eyes the Closed-Circuit
Give me some money
don't have any money
John stops squeezing petrol
What
said  don't have any
John stares at Nadia
He eyes the
Give me your sunglasses
Nadia passes them and John puts them on,trying to look casual
He gives the pump a couple more squirts, hangs it up, nonchalantly sidles up to his door
In one move he opens it, dives in, turns the key in the ignition
The Rover coughs
He tries it again
It howls, barks and sneezes
The attendant comes out onto the forecourt and starts approaching the yellow Rover
Miraculously it roars throatily to life, he floors it and the Rover tears away from the station and off down the road - We see John at the wheel of his Rover, sunglasses on, wind in his hair, fleeing from the scene of the crime
Nadia watches him in the late sunshine, but John is too busy making a getaway to notice
- John's car shimmering as it comes over the brow of a remote country lane, surrounded by fields and rolling hills
/
() - Nadia puts a cigarette in her mouth and pops the dashboard lighter
John takes the cigarette and throws it out the window, followed by the lighter
Nadia just gazes out of the window
So, uh, Alexei, which  know isn't his name
don't want to talk about him
Fine
It's none of your business
Fine
Absolutely
Must be disappointing though
Must come as a hell of a shock
Nadia ignores him
So uh
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is
Oh Jesus
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does
(overlapping -- bigger) Of course
Of course
Of course he does
Of course
Thank you
Thanks
But, you know, so what
They drive
It's his baby  take it
She doesn't answer
Not the kids type then is he
Not that broody
You must be pretty miffed
He will come back
Excuse me
He left me my passport and ticket
It's pretty clear he wants to see me again
Yeah
tend to tie up and abandon women  really want to see again too
No
But you tend to tie them up
John freezes
He looks across
Nadia gives nothing back
Fuck off
Nadia is just looking at him
Fuck off
You started it
She is just looking at him
don't want to talk about it
Why not
Shut up
'm not listening
You don't want to talk about it
No
Okay we won't talk about it
Nadia looks out the window
We'll pretend it never happened
So
What's it like having to fuck men you hate
don't hate you
Okay
Let's
Okay
Okay
You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you
For money
To make money
And
What are you saying
And
It's wrong
And who says what is wrong
And that would be Morals
That would be one's own moral sense of decency
What's a moral orgasm John
Tell me how it feels exactly
So
What then
You just detach sex from everything
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey
"Tied and Tethered"
It's pretty moving huh
Like Anna Karenina
Listen
didn't go rooting around in your private stuff
John remembers he did
Nadia looks across knowingly
Funny
Usually it's the first thing they do
Pause
So what
Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what
Sometimes
Sometimes which
Sometimes neither
Some
What does that mean
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John
don't like sex
don't think 'll be having sex ever again
Why
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die
So now you hate all women
think it's my safest bet, don't you
Oh
think you will recover okay think you got what you paid for
John looks across
What
You
got what  paid for
You didn't mind too much
Pause
(quietly) It wasn't what  wanted
So what did you want
think we understand each other, no
(quietly) You don't understand me
You don't understand you either
John turns to her
It's no big thing
You are the same as most men
You are a man so you are a savage
Not a monster, but half animal
You put on a tie and you go to the bank, but really you are a beast
But also you are from woman so you have a soul
Half beast, half soul
But you hide your beast in the bottom of the wardrobe
It's not so healthy
It's fucked you up, no
John stops the car
Get out
She sits there
Excuse me
Get out You are throwing me out
Get out
She collects her bag from the back seat, her cigarettes, gathers up her belongings, clicks open the door and gets out, leaving the shot
John sits there staring ahead
We hear her voice offscreen
(
) You prefer your women mute
John turns the key in the ignition
The engine bellows and screams
Silence
He tries again
The engine shrieks and wails like a soul in torment
terrible, mournful grinding noise
Silence
(
) Car trouble
John tries to start it
It lets out a whimper, a crying, a few juddering moving sobs, and dies
John sits in his dead car
He shakes his head
He rubs his face
He sits there
- The two of them on a verge ten feet apart
John stares into the distance
Nadia studies the map
It's another twenty miles
It's going dark
She gets her holdall from inside the car and stuffs the map inside
What now
Nadia scans the horizon with her binoculars
John watches her
Jesus
You weren't even on the plane
Nadia lowers her binoculars and looks at John
-
- John watches the passengers stream out of the arrivals gate
woman is greeted and spun around
Across the airport, Nadia lowers her binoculars
We pull back to see she is standing next to Alexei
They say goodbye in Russian
Even though we don't see subtitles, it's a telling exchange
She kisses him, and he watches her leave him and walk across the floor
Alexei watches Nadia approach John, and see him shake her hand
They walk away together
-
'  - Alexei, dressed in a suit, stands outside John's house, looking up
Nadia is in the window, her lipstick smeared
They gaze at each other
- In a clearing, John watches Nadia carry a pile of sticks to a fire she is building
She lights it with her gun cigarette lighter, and teases the flames to life
- John and Nadia sit by the fire
She sits wrapped up to her neck in a blanket
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women
It's a different world
(interrupting on "different") You don't have to say anything (overlapping on "say") What
wasn't saying
(overlapping on "saying") Please, there's no
Oh
wasn't saying anything
Then okay
(pause) So how old were you when you met him
Pause
Fifteen
You don't know him
He was very kind and strong
Yeah
He's a smashing bloke
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St
Albans
Thank Christ for that
You are pretty naive if you think it is
'm pretty naive
Look at you
You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it
Nothing
don't have nothing
Well what have you got
Pause
have my baby
They sit there in the lapping firelight
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl
No
Have you had any before
No
Are you scared
Not really
Maybe a little
fox cries out in the night
Listen
think it's a fox
She listens
It cries out again
She gets out her binoculars
It sounds close
She looks through them and searches the brush
John watches Nadia with her binoculars
He looks suddenly very sad
can't see anything
It's too dark
She puts them back in her bag
John watches her
He sees her wrist again
She lights a cigarette, and blows the smoke into the air
What happened between you and the blonde
What
The thin
the girl with small eyes
The one in your cupboard
It's none of your business
She didn't have small eyes
Did she leave you
Come on
It's nothing to be ashamed of
Who did she leave you for
Your best friend
Her boss
woman
Did she leave you for a woman, John
She's dead
Pause
'm sorry
didn't mean to hurt you
'm sorry
That's awful
Forgive me
Pause
'm sorry
don't know why  said that
She's not dead at all
Nadia looks at John
What
don't know why  said it
'm sorry
She's alive
Nadia starts to laugh
Long and loud
We have never seen her laugh before
She's alive
She is not dead
Laugh it up
She starts to cough
She gets on her hands and knees and coughs like fury
You should stop smoking
You're pregnant
You smoke like a fucking lab dog
'm trying to quit
've got news for you
It's not working
smoke more these days
smoke more when 'm unhappy
Nobody's that unhappy
Maybe  want to die
Don't you want me to die
don't want anyone to die
Except for Small Eyes
Except for Small Eyes
She laughs again
So why did it end
John thinks
It looks as if he's going to tell the whole story
In the end he shrugs
don't know
What was her name
What's your name
The fox cries out again
Listen
It's definitely a fox
Now 'm scared
They listen to the fox crying in the night
You know you can come under the blanket
It's alright
The scene from bird's eye view
John lies back and stares at the stars
Nadia curls up on the other side of the fire, and hugs herself
We push down closer and closer until we are on John's face
The theme returns
The cricket boys from John's Close stand in a line in the middle of the street, bathed in flashing blue light
We pan round and end on John's house
It is surrounded with Police
Police cars, Police Vans, plastic police tape "
" John's neighbours press against the tape as officers come and go
Inside the house is full of police, ransacking his possessions and dusting fingerprints
policeman is standing reading The English-Russian Dictionary
We push on upstairs and along the landing to the spare room
An officer dumps a pile of porno magazines and videos on the bed
He then spots the belts tied to the bedstead and points them out to a detective
They exchange a knowing grin photographer steps up and snaps the paraphernalia in a blinding flash
The birthday cake is there, half eaten
Policewoman puts it in a baggy
We pan across the bed, across the magazines and underwear in plastic bags, down below the bed, where we find the photograph of Nadia with the binoculars
The young girl smiles hopefully out at us from the past
Early dawn
woodpigeon coos
John wakes up next to the dead fire
Nadia is gone
/  - John slides down a rocky slope
He scans the forest, but there's no-one around
He hurries through high bracken then stops suddenly by a large oak
- In a pool in a stream below, Nadia is washing herself
She has her back to us
John watches her for a moment, before his eyes avert, and his head bows
- shimmering sun
giant combine harvester cuts a wide swathe through a field of high corn
As it passes we find John and Nadia coming towards us through the heat haze
They aren't speaking and both look tired
As they pass we crane up out of the corn to catch an enormous 757 Jumbo Jet just above us, coming into land
We pan round to see, half a mile away, the massive airport beyond
They walk towards it, two tiny figures
: Aeroflot 1311
Boarding Gate 12
- An attendant pushes a train of trolleys past
Businessmen talk into mobile phones
've got an hour
Can  buy you a coffee
No
think  better just go
Okay
Thank you
Whatever
Nadia hesitates
There's just a touch of regret in this goodbye
John
These are for you
She hands him the binoculars case
Yeah
No thanks
Please
Why not
Because it was a lie
She smiles
No it wasn't
John shrugs
He takes them
Goodbye
John nods and turns
Nadia watches him walk away
/
- On the other side of the airport, John stands in front of the exit to the taxi ranks
He's got nowhere to go
Passengers swirl around him
He looks at the binocular in his hands
He removes the binoculars and looks at them
Suddenly he stops
In the case is a folded note marked John
John holds it in his hands -- Slowly, deliberately, he screws it up, and drops it in the case like a bin
Through the binoculars
Passengers criss-cross, but we find Nadia sitting alone, waiting for her call
John lowers the binoculars and gazes across the airport
He raises them for one last look
Nadia, glimpsed through the crowd
We spy someone standing about twenty feet behind her
It is Alexei
We watch Alexei approach her
She looks up and is completely thrown
Yuri stands about ten feet away, in shades
John lowers the binoculars, horrified
He looks again
Nadia pulls her arm away
Alexei crouches down in front of her and puts a hand on her knee, coaxing her
Alexei takes her by the arm and leads her away
- John hurries out of the exit to catch the trio leaving a different exit fifty yards away, where they get into a taxi
- John runs across a car park and over a low fence
- He chases down a slip road, as the taxi rounds the corner behind us
He takes cover behind a van as they drive past, and away
- John runs across a grass verge and another car park
He sees the taxi rounding the corner and head down the road in front of him
John runs as fast as he can up this road, but the taxi is getting away
Eventually he gives up, and he drives away
- At the roundabout it turns round and starts coming back up the road
John hides behind a car, and watches the taxi pull up outside a small hotel about fifty yards away
He watches the trio head into the hotel
- John skirts around the edge of the hotel
He peers in through one of the windows
It's the foyer
He heads around the back
- At the back of the hotel he looks through another couple of windows
Suddenly he drops like he's been shot, and sits on the grass
Warily he looks again
/ Alexei stands smoking in the middle of the room
Nadia is sitting in a chair crying
Alexei kneels again and appeals to her
Nadia is resisting and yells back, but something Alexei says seems to melt her resolve
He holds her face, and kisses it
She turns her face
He tries again, and this time she accepts the kiss
Slowly she kisses him back
'  - John stares through the window at the scene
'  - In the room, Yuri pops his head round the door and says something to Alexei
Alexei says he's coming
He kisses Nadia again and leaves
Nadia is alone
She looks very sad and confused
She moves towards the window and stares out into the blackness
'  - John's face at the window
Almost cheek to cheek with Nadia
'  - Inside the room, looking out
It is pitch black
'  - John watches Nadia walk over to the dresser and search the drawers
She goes over to the bed and looks under the pillow
There she finds what she is looking for
Alexei's hunting knife
She hears Alexei coming and stands hard against the window
the huge knife behind her back
'  - John outside
He is four inches from the knife
Oh Jesus
John ducks down, panting, swallowing hard
At once he springs up and skirts the building again
He finds a window to the next suite
He tries to force it open
Suddenly Yuri's face appears in the window, cupped by his hands peering out into the blackness
John drops down holds his breath
John scrambles back to the previous window
With real effort he presses it open
He pulls himself up and drops inside
'  - Nadia still stands by the window, one hand behind her back
Alexei sits on the bed
The scene is subtitled
love you
don't need to tell you that
Nadia looks at the floor
wouldn't leave my child would
You know that
was confused
That's all
'  /  - John opens the bathroom door a crack
He is at the opposite end of a corridor from the bedroom
He can hear Alexei's voice
Breathing hard, he tiptoes out and stands in the corridor, his back pressed hard against the wall
He takes one step down the hall
The floor creaks loudly
'  - It wasn't easy for me
You know what 'm like
needed to know what wanted
Now  know
It's simple
'm happy
'   - John takes another step down the hallway
There, by the door are the two guitar cases full of money
Next to them is Nadia's bag
Crouching, John opens the bag and searches inside
He finds what he is looking for; the Silver Cigarette Lighter-Pistol
We hear the Russian lovers' voices next door
John is absolutely terrified, breathing hard and shaking, holding the little gun
'  - You still love me
Eh
Of course you do
Come here
Yuri won't be here for a while
Come on babe
He takes his shirt off -- Nadia glances up -- With horror, she sees John in the doorway
Alexei turns to see John stand by the door, holding a little silver gun
What are you doing here
John and Nadia look at each other
What the fuck is he doing here
He looks at the little gun
That's that cigarette lighter  gave you isn't it
Alexei stands
John takes a step back
Alexei walks calmly towards John and throws a punch
It catches John right on the chin and he hits the wall and goes down very fast
Stop
Alexei turns round to see Nadia holding the knife
He is dumbstruck
What
What are you doing
(to John) What are you doing here
Alexei kicks John in the ribs
(in Russian) Stop it
He looks at Nadia, the girl he came back for, angrily pointing the knife at him
He suddenly looks completely punctured
John has struggled up again and stands behind him
They are both looking at Nadia
What
You're what
You're with this creep now
Leave him
You have
You've actually fallen for this prick
No  haven't
Alexei looks dumbstruck
He laughs emptily Babe it's me
won't let you get away
Nadia stares back at him
The seconds pass
She speaks in a whisper
'll kill you if you try
In the impasse, John picks up a lamp and hurls it at Alexei's head
It is going to hit him, but reaches the length of its cord and stops six inches short
In the confusion
Alexei grabs Nadia's wrist and forces her to the ground
He grabs the knife, just as John brains him with one of the guitars
It emits a fruity final chord
/ '  - Whistling, Yuri comes out of his suite, knocks briskly on the door of Alexei's and enters
We walk with him down the hallway into the bedroom to find Alexei, heartbroken, tied and bound to a desk chair
Yuri murmurs something in Russian
Fuck a duck
: '  - Nadia stands at the window and stares at her reflection, or past it into the blackness
Get their passports
John finishes tying up Yuri, and removes his passport from his jacket
Behind Nadia another plane arcs up into the night sky
He takes Alexei's passport from his pocket, but Alexei is only watching Nadia
Don't do this
She carefully places tape across his mouth
Almost as if having second thoughts she bends down to kiss his cheek
The 'kiss' suddenly makes Alexei's eyes widen in pain
As she stands her lips are bloody
She's bitten him on the cheek
single streak of blood runs from the gash
(to John) Get your money
John collects the cases and they head for the door
Nadia stops to look back at Alexei
final look
- The front of the terminal
Taxis pull up and idle at a rank, bringing travelers to their flights
The automatic doors slide back and forth
- (
) Last Call for Aeroflot flight 1311 to Moscow
Proceed immediately to Gate 12
John carries the guitar cases full of money
Nadia just has her small camouflaged hold all
They walk quickly together in silence and come to a stop at the departure lounge gate 12
Are you okay
She nods
Okay
Goodbye
Goodbye
They shake
What will you do now
Nadia shrugs
Something else
Okay
Promise
She looks at him
Promise
They stand around
She takes the last cigarette from a pack
You can probably buy them on the flight
'm quitting
This will be my last one
So
Goodbye
Goodbye
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham
Whatever
'm sorry
Please
Pause
You prefer your women
She seems about to say something more when the tannoy interrupts
(
) Gate closing for Flight 1311 to Moscow
Please have your tickets ready
She leans forward and kisses him
As they kiss, John puts a guitar case in her hand
Nadia looks down at the case
It's not mine
It's not mine either
It's what you came back for
John frowns and looks a little embarrassed
She speaks to him in Russian and we see the subtitles
(in Russian) You're a big surprise, you know
Pause
Yeah, you see when  said  didn't speak Russian  wasn't actually just making it up
She leans forwards and whispers in his ear
John looks at her
He looks to the four corners of the airport
And back at her
Why
'm not asking you to marry me
No
What
No
know
It's more like a date
It's a long way to go for a date
Tell me about it
Pause
She speaks softly in Russian
We see the subtitle: All that matters is to try
John frowns
(in Russian) We can only try
Say it
John repeats the phrase in Russian
What does it mean
Maybe you will find out
Pause
Nadia kneels and opens the guitar case
She stealthily removes about five hundred
Hurry
'll wait for you here
Right
- John runs across the airport to the ticket desk
He joins a queue of about three people
He works his way to the front
Is the flight full
'm sorry Sir
believe the flight is closed
Please check
Is it full
Please could you check
: - Nadia stands alone holding her unlit cigarette, thinking
She looks at the two guitar cases at her feet
She looks across at John, anxiously drumming on the ticket sales counter
What is she thinking
- on the photo of Yuri in his passport
The Aeroflot desk official holds the passport and studies at John
With his four day beard there is a resemblance, but it's far from perfect
You have excellent English
Thanks
How do you want to pay
Cash
John collects his ticket, turns and heads back to where he left Nadia with the guitar cases
He suddenly stops
She's gone
He looks all around
People swirl about
She's nowhere to be seen
John hangs his head
He turns, and walks away
- John sits at a cafe table, and watches the people come and go
He looks strangely calm, resigned
: John's fingers uncrumple the note from the binoculars case
He smooths it on the table, then opens it
Inside is written a short phrase in Russian: Kam Kapsi Schta
John looks at the note
He folds it closed and surveys the airport for an exit
Through the crowd, fifty feet away, getting a light off two policeman; it's her
Nadia blows out smoke, and speaks to the policeman
John watches her
He smiles
Suddenly she turns and points straight at John
The Policeman look straight at him
As they head towards him, Nadia picks up the cases and walks away
John sits frozen as the Police approach
1 Excuse me Sir
He takes John by the arm
John stands
2 Okay
Come with us now
1 He doesn't speak English
He's epileptic or something
2 Can he walk
Can you walk
The Policeman help John to the front of the gate, where he is shown to the front of the queue
The Policeman explains to the airline staff
We see that Nadia is one behind in the queue
The Police turn and walk away
-  1311   - John pushes his passport and ticket under the perspex window
He glances at Nadia, then looks at the young airport official, the blood beating in his ears
For a few interminable seconds the official's eyes burn into John
John turns to Nadia and holds her gaze
Kam
Kapsi
Schta
The subtitle appears: You've saved me
Nadia looks down at the floor
She smiles
: The passport is snapped shut and pushed back through
- John walks without looking back
He turns to see Nadia is behind him
As they round the corner, she hands him a case
They walk side by side without speaking
Both look forward, straight-faced, as it both are thinking about what it is that they are actually doing
John looks back once, but he keeps walking
He looks across at Nadia, but she doesn't look back
They stop opposite the automatic boarding doors
Nadia turns to John
My name's Sophia
Sophia
Hello Sophia
Mine's still John
Hello John
The doors slide open
John and Sophia walk through, and disappear
The roar of Jet engines
- With a deafening roar, an Aeroflot Boeing 757 lifts slowly from the runway and climbs up into the night sky, where it becomes a distant star
- distant aeroplane in a cobalt blue sky, through binoculars
The young girl from the very first scene lowers the binoculars and lets them hang around her neck
She squints up at the sun
voice calls her
' Nadia
The girl looks round
' Nadia
She runs past us and we follow to see a couple sitting on the grass having a picnic
The girl hurries towards them and we realise the couple are John and Sophia, the girl her child
She sits down with them
