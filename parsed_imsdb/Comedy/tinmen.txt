-                                    1 (""), a wiry, dapper-looking man in his mid-thirties, is circling a baby blue Cadillac follows on his heels
She's a beauty
(looking at Salesman) Who
What
Who's the beauty
The car
thought maybe you saw some chick walking by
lost my concentration
Why do they call cars 'she'
They never say 'he'
always 'she
' The Salesman shrugs his shoulders
walks around the Cadillac
Very nice
very nice

-                                              3 , a rather plain, but attractive woman in her early 30's, is yelling up the stairs
You're a sick man
Sick
Do ya hear me
Do ya hear me

Who's sick
Who do ya think 'm screaming at
How many of you are there up there
There's only you, and you're a sick human being
(quietly, coming down a few steps) Where's my white on white shirt
The nice one, you know
It's like yelling through a wall to you
'm carrying on about what a disgusting human being you are, and all you want to know is where your white on white shirt is
Yes, the one with the permanent stays

-                                4 is now sitting in a cubicle in the office with the Salesman, going over the contract on the car
Now don't try to hustle me here you know what  mean
hate being hustled
Give me an honest price, not one of your 'special' deals
give me an honest price
Do  make myself clear
Now, how much are you willing to pay
There ya go
there ya go
you're doing it
you're doing one of those hustle numbers

4   :                                               4 'm just trying to get an idea how much you're willing to pay
Four dollars
want to pay four dollars a month
That's not an honest answer
What do ya want to hear
That 'd love to pay three hundred and fifty a month
is that what you want to hear
Tell me how much you want me to pay and 'll tell you how much 'll pay, but don't do a hustle on me
don't like that
How much do  want to pay
'd like to pay nothing

'  -                                      5 Tilley's leaving the house with his tie undone around his white on white shirt
He carries his sports jacket, and Nora is standing at the door yelling at him
You're being unreasonable
You don't even want to listen
don't know what  did
got no idea
If it's my fault, 'm sorry
'm sorry
can do no better than that
full unconditional apology
Tilley walks down the steps of the house and goes to his car -- a Cadillac
He gets inside,  the  and pulls away
Nora remains on the porch watching the car one lonely figure in a neighborhood of hundreds of duplicate houses

-                                 6 and the Salesman are coming out of the office

6   :                                              6 If you even have the smallest problem, call me personally and 'll just shoot you straight into the service department
And  get a loaner if the car's got to stay
As we discussed, you get a car if the car has to be kept overnight
get a loaner
The Salesman nods

'  -                                       7 He drives along, mumbling to himself
She's gonna drive me to my grave
'm headed to my grave
the woman's driving me insane
it's not supposed to happen this way
He starts moving his head -- stretching his neck from right to left
It's not even eleven o'clock and my neck is stiffening up
He juts his jaw out
My neck's tight
it's tight

-                                8 gets into the shiny, baby-blue Cadillac, puts it in reverse and starts to back out of the car lot

'  -                                       9 Tilley is doing neck exercises, rolling his head from left to right as he drives
He sees a red light ahead and starts to slow down, continuing to roll his head
10
'  -                                 10 sees the light is red and starts to back into the street

'  -                                       11 Tilley rolls his head back as he slows to 15 miles an hour

'  -                                 12 backs into the street thinking that Tilley's car is going to stop

'  -                                       13 Tilley is still rolling his head
: 14
-                                        14 Tilley's Cadillac and 's Cadillac  into one another
The entire right rear of 's shiny, baby-blue Cadillac is smashed
Both men are shocked and momen- tarily confused
After a beat, both Tilley and  bolt from their cars
Tilley looks at his buckled hood races up to Tilley's face
Are you a lunatic
Can't you see 'm trying to back out of this lot
There's a red light, you shoulda stopped
Me
What are you, crazy
You just want to back into the middle of the street like that
man's just driving along and you back into the middle of the street
What kind of driving is that
What kind of driving

14                                                         14 There's a red light, 'm making a space for myself
that's what 'm doing, in order to get into the street
that's something ya do
You came out of nowhere
you bolted out of no place
bolted out of nowhere
Bolted
At six miles an hour 'm bolting into the street
You schmuck
You schmuck
He moves toward Tilley
Back away from me, do ya hear me
Back away from me
Back away
You want me to back away
'll back away
He turns to walk away from Tilley, walks and then turns back and kicks in the headlight of Tilley's car
You're a fucking lunatic
He goes for , jumps him and they both fall on to the trunk of 's car
People have started to gather and immediately jump in and pull  and Tilley apart
You're a madman
Smashes into me, attacks me
the man is crazy
People continue to pull them apart
#1 Come on now, calm down, calm down
He holds 's arms
Another  grabs for Tilley and tries to pull him off
#2 Take it easy
take it easy

Will ya get this guy
Backs in front of me, and then  kicks my headlight in
and  'm crazy
You lunatic
Tilley makes another jump for
Again, people try pulling them apart
You're going to prison
Death
Death
They're going to give you death
looks at his brand new Cadillac with the smashed-in side
Car only has one sixteenth of a mile, and 've been hit
He turns back and looks at Tilley
'm gonna get even with you, you son of a bitch
'm gonna get even with you
This is no ordinary traffic accident
You want to drive a Cadillac, learn how to drive
You want to get even with somebody
You picked the wrong person to get even with
Nobody backs into traffic, smashes my car and says they want to get even
'm gonna get even

-                                               15 Seated at a booth are three aluminum siding salesmen having their late morning breakfast
, a heavyset man in his 50's, delicately butters his toast, and is shaking his head sadly
Did ya see 'Bonanza' last night
Can you tell me why Ben Cartwright had a colored guy stay over

15   :                                              15 , who is pouring half a pound of sugar into his coffee, looks up
Ben Cartwright had a colored guy stay overnight at the Ponderosa
, who is picking his teeth with a matchbook, squints at Sam with an investigative look
Did he know this guy personally
No
he was just passing through, asked if he could stay over, and Ben Cartwright said 'sure thing
' It doesn't make any sense
he invites a strange colored guy in
invited him in to stay
Is that crazy or what
If a colored guy came to my door and said 'can stay the night,' 'd tell him 'get the fuck out of here'
It's nothing personal, mind you
You're not a bigot, is that what you're telling us
Me
No, 'm not a bigot
If you're not, how come you're making such a big thing out of it
It's the fact the Ben Cartwright's on the Ponderosa
he's in the middle of nowhere
It's not like he's living on Reisterstown Road with houses all around
we're talking about the West here
It's the idea that a strange guy comes to the door in the middle of the West
It doesn't make sense, that's all 'm saying
Come on
you're a bigot, that's what you are
() 9
15   :   (2)                                             15 Listen, 'll sell tin to anybody don't care who he is mark's a mark, whether he's Chinese, Indian or from Mars
'm thoroughly integrated
Makes no difference to me
just wouldn't have one of those guys sleep in my house

-                                  16 Tilley gets out of his car and enters the diner

-                                              17 He starts walking to the booth where the other tin men are
On his way he yells over to the waitress
Florence, eggs and the toast, the way  like it
, who doesn't have too much energy, calls back to Tilley
Not too gooey
Coffee right away
She trails the last word
Sam is still talking about his problem with "Bonanza
" just don't believe that 'Bonanza' is an accurate description of the West
say no more
Tilley slips into the booth next to Sam
He indicates for Sam to give him more room
Come on, give me a couple of more inches
You want me to take my plate
'll eat in the parking lot
() 10
17   :                                              17 Come on, Sam, 'm having a terrible morning
You're not going to believe this, some guy just crashed into me
right in the middle of the street
then he attacks me
One of the loonies
(biting into his toast) Did ya live
Did you get his name
Yeah,  got his name
The police came
God,  can't believe it
the guy's an idiot
He pulls a piece of paper from his pocket
Yeah, here it is
some Polish name
Babowski
Bill Babowski fucking son of a bitch

they call him You know the son of a bitch
Yeah, he works with Bagel
He sells aluminum siding don't believe it
of all the people that could run into me, it has to be a fucking tin man
How come  don't know him
You musta seen him
He hangs out with Carly Benelli, Cheese you know, that group

17   :   (2)                                              17 Don't you remember, he was up at the Corral one night when we were there
he's a good dancer
You must have seen him
don't know the guy
Gil, he doesn't know the guy
thought he knew him, Sam can't believe he doesn't know him
He seems to be indicating that he doesn't know him
don't know the guy
He's a good dancer
What do you want me to do, date him
What do  give a shit if he's a good dancer
thought you saw him
was amazed, he does a Marengay tell you if  was a girl 'd be impressed
You're not a girl and you're impressed
Florence comes over and puts down some coffee in front of Tilley
Is it fresh
Yes, it's fresh
Just asking, Florence

17   :   (3)                                                17 Florence starts to walk away
You're always just asking
Gil still talking about
'm telling you, you just can't believe how well this guy does the Marengay

'll  tell you one thing,    when get a  hold of this guy,    'll break  both his legs and    then he won't  dance the Marengay    too good

-    - DAY18 We see  pulling up to a building in his banged-up, brand new Cadillac
There are three or four nice Cadillacs parked outside of the run-down building
: 19
-                                          19 The office is filled with second-hand furniture, mis- matched desks and a conglomeration of styles
In one corner of the room there are two or three  working the telephones -- canvassing -- talking to people on the phone to see if they're interested in a demonstration on the benefits of aluminum siding
They all speak in a very congenial tone of voice
#1 Good morning,  represent the Superior Aluminum Siding Company
We will have a representative in your neighborhood today
Would you be interested in seeing the benefits of our aluminum product

another corner of the room where we see 4 "tin men" salesmen sitting around one of the desks playing cards
is beginning to tell a joke
He is a man in his 50's
So the guy goes to the doctor for a physical
they do all those tests, all that stuff, blah, blah, blah
enters the scene and goes over and gets himself a cup of coffee
Doctor says 'when we get all the   information back, we'll give you   a call
' Leaves the doctor
One   day the telephone rings
the   guy goes and picks it up
The guy
(immediately aggravated) The guy
Not the doctor

He gets a phone call
it's    the doctor on the line
Doctor     says ''ve got some bad news and    some worse news
' join the tin men to listen to Moe's joke
Guy    says 'Well, let me hear the bad    news first
' 'The bad news is,    you've got twenty-four hours to    live
' The guy says 'What's the    worse news
' Doctor says '    forgot to call you yesterday
' They all laugh
, a thin guy who twitches and blinks a lot, stands up
It's good
like it
never heard bad news and worse news
smart joke
Yeah

It's dumb, but good
, who is not laughing, stands behind Cheese who throws 50 cents into the card game
Up it fifty cents

Very serious cards

Ballsy move
Moe throws his hand in, too
(to ) Did you get the new Cadillac
Yeah
It's already been hit

Didn't have it     five minutes, backing out of     the place, and a guy comes out     of nowhere and bangs into my     car

Cheese throws his hand down

'd get rid of the car
That much damage it won't be any good
You may have dented the frame
didn't dent the frame
When you hit the frame, the car doesn't ride right
He didn't hit the frame
'll tell you this, 'm gonna get the son of a bitch
If he would have apologized or something, but this guy gets out, tries to push me around
You're kidding me
Yeah
the guy's totally off the wall
He takes a sip of his coffee
'm gonna get him
just for the fun of it

/   -                    20 's Cadillac moves through the neighborhood, and we see homes that all look to be about 30 to 40 years old
: 21
'  -                                21 Moe is with  in the Cadillac

Moe is looking through some papers

we gotta be at the Hickey house at four
(he looks at his watch) It's about three-twenty now
we've got some time on our hands
You want to get some coffee
No, 'm up to here with the coffee
He indicates his throat
They got any good pool halls around here
don't know
(beat) You know what would be fun to do
Let's try the Life Magazine routine
(smiles) Yeah
: 22
-                                 22 Slightly run-down
We're looking  the  of a 35mm camera
(
) You know,  think we've got to come over about two feet
The   as  moves the camera
: 23
-                                 23 is looking through the curtains, suspiciously
the window and we see Moe and moving the 35mm camera around on a tripod
We can faintly hear their talk
() 18

the light is  hitting it, which is accentuating  the effect we're going for
It's very good
very good
(in a creative pose) This shows the flaws in the structure
: 24
-                                 24 and Moe at the camera and tripod
(under his breath, to Moe) She's at the window
Yeah
(in a loud voice) This is going to be terrific in Life Magazine
(even louder) Terrific in Life Magazine
(under his breath) Come on outside, honey
(in loud voice) This should be our single biggest issue of Life Magazine
We see the Housewife coming out of her front door
(quietly) Bingo
The Housewife approaches  and Moe suspiciously
Excuse me
What are you doing
() 19
24   :                                              24 Oh,  hope we're not disturbing you, ma'am
We're with Life Magazine
we'll be out of here in just a minute
(still looking through camera; to Moe) Move the tripod another foot
another foot
Moe moves the tripod
What do you mean, Life Magazine
(looking up from camera) Two minutes, ma'am, and we'll be out of here
We just need the picture for Life Magazine, and we'll be out of here
Life Magazine
don't understand
It's very simple
Ya know, we're doing this layout about the benefits of aluminum siding -- a 'before' and 'after' kind of presentation
'before' picture
So they see your house, and another one done with aluminum siding
the other house looking so much more beautiful
In Life Magazine
It's a special issue on home improvements and ways to beautify your home
() 20
24   :   (2)                                              24 wonderful issue
it's one of the finest pictorial things we've done here at Life
the ways you can improve your house
(he adjusts the camera) We're gonna be out of here in no time, ma'am
It's gonna look very good,
My house is going to be the 'before'
Can't mine be like the 'after'
No, no
we've got a house that looked like yours and it's been done in aluminum
it's very nice
Yeah
really shows the contrast of what a house can look like
What does it cost
What
The aluminum siding
Oh
don't know the figures offhand
Do you have any idea, Moe
think it's fairly reasonable
Could my house be the 'after' in Life Magazine and you get another house for the 'before
' You mean have your house as the 'after' and find another house that looks like your house for the 'before'
Is it possible
() 21
24   :   (3)                                             24 What do ya think, Moe
Would that be ethical
Well, we didn't sign any agreement with the 'after' house
We'd have to move very quickly, ma'am
you know what  mean
You'd have to work out an arrangement with an aluminum siding company and they'd have to do the job very quickly for us to make our deadline
we've got a deadline, that's the problem
How quickly
, what do you think
Can we slide the deadline, or what
Six or seven days
Pressing it
Do you think we could manage it, Moe
It's pushing it,
(to Housewife) What time would your husband be home, 'cos he'd have to go over the figures with the salesman
that's if there's a salesman available this evening
He'll be home at seven
We might be able to work it
That would be wonderful
: 22

-                             25 and Moe are sitting on a sofa sipping coffee, looking as if they were members of the family
The Housewife and her  are sitting across the dining room table from Carly
Carly is going  through papers, adding up figures
Okay
we've got a total of thirty-seven hundred dollars
Thirty-seven hundred dollars
Honey, we're gonna be in Life Magazine
(to Moe) Moe, did you call  the office and make sure we  can hold up the issue until this  job is completed
This house really  could be a showcase
Thirty-seven hundred dollars
tell you what
've got an idea
Do you mind my guys working on a Saturday
'Cos if my crew can work on Saturday next, that'll free my guys up on Monday
Yeah, that'll really help me out on another job
Anyway, if we can do that, think 'll be able to knock off three hundred and fifty dollars from the job
You see, 've got an overlapping situation on Monday
don't want to go into it
What do ya think
We got a deal
Yep

The table is filled with papers, folders, etc

He's reviewing a paper from a job that Mouse has done
Forty-six hundred dollars
This looks like a sound deal
They own their own house
we won't have any problem getting the financing for them
Real good, Mouse
He picks up his check book ledger and writes out a check
(writing) So, that's one thousand, one hundred and thirty-eight dollars
Finishes writing check and hands it to Mouse
Thanks, boss
Pleasure doing business with ya
Mouse takes the check and pockets it
Wing turns to Tilley and Sam
Now, what's your guys' story
Nothing again
came up short
Let me get a little advance

Something like that

Don't try to go walking on me
What do you mean, walking
You think 'm gonna work somewhere else

very honorable
He's always said that about you, Wing
Always said that about you
he has
'll give you hundred and fifty
Wing,  need a bit more than that
got expenses
What's wrong with your wife
She doesn't work
Yeah, but how much is she gonna make working at the Social Security office
Wing writes out a check and gives it to Tilley
Come on, Wing, can't you do better than this
a man in my position in terms of this firm
dunno
All right, 'll give you two hundred

Now listen, guys, we got a problem here

My sources tell me this Home Improvement Commission is for real
it's no jackpot
These guys are going to be a real pain in the ass, so any of the scams that you guys are pulling, they get wind of it, they take your license and it's goodbye to this business
They take away your license
They take away your livelihood
What kind of people are these
They have no respect for the working man
Which scams are they talking about
They got a list
Any irregularities, you know, selling a house on the pretense that it's a model house and every job sold in the area they get a kickback
the Life Magazine hustle
you guys know all the bullshit numbers we can run

What a pain in the ass
Do you think this commission's gonna stick around or is it gone with the wind

We hear the    sound of
Tilley responds to the sound
He looks out of the glass doors and sees kicking in    the headlight of his car
runs back towards his    car
It's that fucking lunatic again
He races out of the door of the hotel towards 's car which pulls away and speeds down the street
Several of the tin men run after Tilley
He stands in the street watching the car disappear

Is he sane or what
Isn't that something

He takes off his coat and throws it on a chair

Do things together that are enjoyable

we put a thing on the ground, and we eat
Yes
it's nice to do that

don't get it
It's better sitting at home and watching
think there's something nice about a picnic
it's fun
What's fun about it
Ants get into the food
there's bees
don't get it
We have to drive, it takes maybe an hour to get there, then you sit in grass and eat
Why is that fun
just thought it might be nice to do something together, that's all
thought it might be fun
It doesn't sound like fun to me
you take the stuff you've got here in the house, you take it someplace to eat it
It's just as much fun eating in front of the , and we do that together, don't we
No ants and no bees
much more comfortable
It's not the same thing

He is dressed in the "Ivy League" look of the times
(to Stanley) Sure you wanna get into the tin game
Money's good,  understand
Lot of crazy people you're gonna run into when you're knocking on those doors
Hermits that don't see the outside world, Jehovah's Witnesses that try and sell you the Bible at the same time you're trying to sell them tin
People that are just lonely and want to have conversations
Every time you step in that door, you've got to be fast on your feet
Interesting
(quizzing Stanley) What's the best way to qualify a mark
What
How do you know if you can get the upper hand
How do you know if you're dealing with a guy who's in an inferior position to you, or superior position
How do you know
Moe puts Stanley on the defensive

Guy bends down to pick up the matches for you, you got a mark
you got this guy in your pocket
If he looks to you to pick it up, you've got a long, hard, tough sell on your hands
walks over to the guys, having just poured himself some coffee
You want to get in good with these people
you want to win their confidence
Good thing to try
get a five dollar bill, take it out when the guy's not looking, drop it on the ground
Guy looks back, pick it up, hand it to him and say, 'Mr
Blah blah, you musta dropped this five dollar bill on the ground
' Two things happen
he says, 'It's not mine,' you say, 'Musta been, 'cos it's certainly not mine,' or the guy takes it
Right away this guy is thinking you must be one hell of a nice guy
you're in
You start chipping away
you start getting inside those people
Stanley is quite taken by their information

Come on, Moe, let's split

Tilley is crazy
he had a nervous breakdown

What's that
He's been under a lot of pressure recently
he snapped
he had a nervous breakdown
it's the saddest thing 've ever seen
Let's be honest about it, nobody gives away forty-two hundred dollars' worth of aluminum siding free
thought it was very generous, but sometimes the Lord moves in mysterious ways

he'll lose his home his wife and kids will be thrown out onto the street
He'll probably spend some time in an institution, so God knows what will happen to his wife and kids
Anyway, it's not your problem
Why do they have to be thrown out onto the street
You don't expect his boss to pick up the forty-two hundred job, do ya
Hmm
Yeah, it's a bad state of affairs
(beat) Let me ask you something, sir
Yes
You don't think there's some way you could work with me to try and resolve this, do you
How so
Let's look at it this way, what if  can sell you this job at a wholesale price
kind of lessens the burden
The big boss won't get so angry, and maybe won't throw the guy's wife and kids out
at least they'll have a roof over their heads
What kind of wholesale price are we talking about

He's doing some good moves, and it's obvious that he's a real crowd pleaser
Sitting at the bar are Looney, Stanley and Carly
The buzzard had a great gimmick
You know, when it came time to measure a job, he'd cut the yardstick and reglue it together he took out seven inches so his square footage would always be higher
That way he'd always make a few extra bucks on the job

You're kidding
Yeah
he'd always put his hand over the break when he was measuring
Nobody looks at a yardstick to see how long it is
(laughs) never did that
never did that
was never very good in arts and crafts
could never make the ruler come out right
The song ends
He pats his dancing partner on her rear, she walks back to her table, and  walks over to where Moe is sitting
picks up his beer can, holds it up to Moe as if he's going to make a toast
Here's to Nora
Moe smiles, picks up his can, they tap their cans, and both take a swig of their beers
Stanley is really enjoying the stories Carly and Looney are telling
What else
Give me another story these stories are great
Just a minute

He'd say to the guy 'here let me show you how bad a shape your house is in,' and he'd rip off a piece of wood, maybe fifteen feet wide
The guy's house looks like shit so it makes it hard for him to back out of the deal when half the side of his house is missing
The Shoe's a fucking wonder

When will you be home

Twelve

Holy God

Looks like there's good action here tonight
What do you expect, it's half price night for divorced women
The place is hopping
Look how much more complicated things are now
There used to be a time you met a girl, you courted and then you got married and lived happily ever after
Now, see that one over there
(he points to girl at a table) that's Helen Armstrong
maiden name used to be Tudor
Get this, she dated Charlie Rider when  was in high school, seemed like they were together forever

that marriage goes in the toilet, but fast
Now she's dating Charlie Rider who was divorced by Evelyn Chartoff who used to be Evelyn Gage before that

'm beginning to believe in God
You were never one of those atheists, were you
No, 'm not saying that, but 'm beginning to give God more thought
So, what did you do
Have some kind of religious experience
tell ya
took my wife for lunch yesterday
we went and had some smorgasbord, and it kind of happened
You found God at the smorgasbord
Yeah
Sam, people have religious experiences like on a lake or when they go up into the mountains, that kind of thing

went to get myself a salad and  started to see all these vegetables, you know how they have all those salads laid out so that when it's time to get to the main course you won't eat too much
that scam to get you filled up so you don't eat too much chicken and beef and all that other stuff
Yeah, yeah
get the point
So
So  see celery,  see the lettuce, tomatoes, cauliflower
and think, all these things come out of the ground
they just grow out of the ground
They had corn -- out of the ground
radish -- out of the ground
You say to yourself, how can all these things come out of the ground
You know what 'm talking about
All these things are out of the ground
(not understanding) Yeah
mean, how can that be
It just happened that way
And 'm not even getting into the fruits
'm just dealing with vegetables right now
With all those things coming out of the earth, there must be a God

Banana Head is here

That crazy guy that banged into my car and smashed my windows in

Both  and Tilley weave their way through the crowd to get to one another

You didn't smash my windows in

The band keeps playing

Oh, no

What is this crowd here
We're charging admission
Back away
give me some elbow room

police car pulls into the lot
The sound of   the tires on the gravel catches Moe's attention and  he sees it's the police
(quietly to and Tilley) Police
Tilley and  immediately drop their guards and lean against a car
One cop gets out of the police car and heads into the club, the other cop stays behind in the car
No one knows quite what to do since the policeman is so nearby

No, not right now
They dance quietly for a moment
Every time  listen to Sinatra, always remember when  used to work in Atlantic City back in the late 40's
you know, a busboy job
Sinatra used to play at the 500 Club, and we used to take our dates and say, 'Hey, you wanna go and hear Sinatra
' Then we'd just lean on the door of the club in the alley and listen to the music
think the girls were looking for something a bit more uptown
Nora laughs
'd go with you and lean against the door

Nice pick, Tilley
Why don't you just throw the twenty dollars in the trash can right now
'Rider's Revenge'
like that name
've gotta go and see Wing
(a little pissed off) Look, we can be scientific from now to doomsday, but we gotta be gutsy and go for the big one

As Tilley closes the    door, his coffee, which is filled to the top of his cup,    spills over the top and starts to burn his hand
Ah
Ah
He jumps back, and puts his coffee down on a desk, and wipes his hand on the back of his jacket
What's up, Wing
Wing is sitting at his desk which is cluttered with papers
You lost a sale, Tilley

typical aluminum sidings salesman, in his early 40's
He leans into the microphone
Free storm windows
Yes
That you would provide a free set of storm windows with the sale of aluminum siding
No, sir
wouldn't be able to make any money if  was giving away storm windows
My cost of a storm window is somewhere like

Standing by the door at the back of the warehouse
(
) The storm windows, as  can recall, was not an issue
mentioned that  thought the storm windows would cut down on their heating bill, and that they would obviously enhance the look of the house with the aluminum siding work we were going to do
(
) So, you weren't dangling a free set of storm windows as a come-on to selling them the aluminum siding job
Because it says here, and 'm reading from a statement from Mr

Well, try
As an example
came home last night,  get undressed, and realize you're sleeping on my side of the bed
've always slept on that side
it's something 've always done

Fuck him

Masters throws a file down on the table
This is good, Stan
nice work
Stanley nods
Fossey says it should go down very well with the city council
Could help us appropriate more funds
This goes a long way to establish our credibility in what we're trying to do
We hear a ,  noise and  echoing through the warehouse throughout this scene
There's a lot more where this came from
You know what  think you should do now
Why don't you pull some files
some files that were completed, others that went unsold, and 'll have somebody run it down, talk to the customers and get some statements
Pulling files is another thing
That might not be easy

He comes out of the back room into the pool hall, and walks over to the table where Tilley and Gil are playing pool
He drops an open envelope onto the pool table
(to Tilley) Take a look at this crap
They're not gonna leave me alone

With those words there's a genuine moment of concern from all of the tin men -- even Mouse stops singing
Tilley picks up the envelope and pulls out the letter
We've got to appear

The government is after me

Mr
Marengay somebody is always after me
What the hell's going on here

What's the big deal
They can't get along without me
The government can't operate unless they've got Tilley's money
the Commission's after my job
This shit's driving me insane
All the lying, thieving, stealing corporations in this world, and the  takes the time to come for me
There's billions of dollars out there but they've got to come and get Tilley's four thousand dollars

There's a lot of activity during this interaction
people coming and going
guy breaks into my house and 'm being charged with assault
It makes no sense
(with pencil and paper) Let's get it down right
The guy broke into your house, you hit him in the head with a gun, went to the refrigerator, took out eggs and tomatoes and threw them at him
was defending myself
he was stealing from me
It doesn't sound like defense to me
wanted to humiliate the guy
Here  am, out busting my ass all day making a decent living,  come home, and some schmuck is trying to steal from me
So you hit him with a gun, and pelted him with eggs and tomatoes
If  had some soup  would have thrown soup at him
is there any law you can't throw eggs
Mr
Babowski claims he didn't break into your house
What did  do
Invite him in so that  could throw eggs at him
() 107
116   :                                              116 Maybe Mr
Babowski intended to break into your house, but these circumstances of the guy being pelted with eggs and tomatoes is something we need to look into
Tilley shrugs his shoulders
He's lucky that he didn't rob me last week, 'cos then my wife was living at home and we had all kinds of things in the fridge
could have thrown barley soup, pumpkin pie, candied yams
yeah, he got off light

Couple of eggs over,   some hash browns, some toast --   toasted dark
butter on the   side, large grapefruit juice and   some coffee
The Waitress writes his order
On second thought, instead of the eggs over, if  ordered soft boiled eggs do you take them out of the shell or leave them in the shells
We can see that  is getting a little irritable
We leave them in the shell
don't like them that way because they get hot in the hand and it's hard to scoop the stuff out
it's not good
and you get little bits of shell in there and it doesn't taste good
Why don't you just order some scrambled eggs and be done with it
all right
If 'm going to order, at least ought to be content with my food
'm getting a little hungry
've got a headache as it is
Just order some eggs so some other people can have something to eat before the lunch trade comes in

we're ordering breakfast, for Christ sake
It so happens  haven't been to this restaurant before
don't know how they do their eggs
if they're over easy and they're gooey, 'm not happy with it

Come on, guys

Tilley and Sam sit at the defense table
Masters presides over the commission table where four or five other commis- sioners sit
(into microphone to Tilley & Sam) Didn't you approach Mr
Boloshevski August 18, 1961, while he was cutting his front lawn and tell him that his house had been selected, as one of only 16 homes in the state of Maryland, for a free aluminum siding job
What's the name again
Boloshevski
Doesn't ring a bell
(to Sam) Sam, does it ring a bell to you
(leans into microphone) It doesn't ring a bell to me either, sir
Didn't you suggest that for a nominal labor charge, he would receive over five thousand dollars' worth of aluminum siding
() 118
125   :                                             125 That's an awful lot for nothing
Doesn't sound like good business to me
Mr
Boloshevski was ultimately charged twenty-four hundred dollars for labor, which according to our figures is about the average cost of an aluminum siding job
(leans into the microphone) don't get the point of this
Twenty-four hundred dollars that you charged for labor, is the same as if Mr
Boloshevski had purchased the aluminum siding and had the labor done
Maybe 'm missing the point here, but if he paid twenty-four hundred, which is the cost of the job, can't see anything wrong with that
don't know the guy, but  don't quite get the problem
What we're getting at here
what we're trying to stress, is that the job was sold under false terms
The man didn't win any award
he was not getting aluminum siding at a special price
clear case of deception was involved here
(to Sam) What's he talking about
The man got the job for twenty-four hundred dollars, and that's what it costs in aluminum siding

don't know
we have no recollection of this particular job, but  don't know if this is deception
Look, if you work in a clothing store, some guy tries on a suit, it looks like shit, but you tell him it looks wonderful
The guy's standing there looking like a sack of shit, the salesman says what a great suit and the man buys it
That's deception as far as  can see, but  don't understand the deceptiveness that you say we're responsible for
if  make myself clear
(leaning into the microphone) 'd go along with that as well
What we're trying to establish are the principles that have been laid down as part of the Home Improvement code of ethics
that you cannot mislead someone intentionally, and  think that's the principle that applies to this
Did somebody put a gun to this guy's head and make him spend twenty-four hundred dollars don't get the point here don't know the specifics of this case, not being privy to all the information, but all  can say is this guy got a fair price for a fair job
Another commissioner,  , takes the microphone
(to Tilley) Do you know Mr
and Mrs
Rayburn of 156 Aberdeen Avenue, Essex

The couple purchased twenty-eight hundred dollars' worth of aluminum siding and the two of you were the salesmen on record
They say, and quote here, 'that they would have received one hundred and fifty dollars per home for every person in the neighborhood who saw their house and decided to buy aluminum siding

It sounds right
Are you aware that, according to the Home Improvement code, you are not allowed to exceed a twenty dollar limit in incentives
(shrugs his shoulders) We wanted to be a little more generous, that's all
The couple said that they never did receive any money from any other jobs, as you had promised
(leaning into microphone) We didn't get any leads from them
Their house was not the showplace that we thought it would be
It didn't generate the activity that we had hoped

(leaning into microphone) Excuse us for one moment
He then leans over to Delaney, and they start to confer
Tilley and Sam watch, wondering what's going on
Masters leans in the other direction, holding his hand over the microphone, and he talks to the other commissioners
They nod in approval, then Masters leans back into the microphone
Thank you very much, gentlemen
Should there be a reason in the future to call you back, we would like to reserve that right

Suddenly  slips under the umbrella with her

She pulls away from  and continues walking
walks behind her, getting soaked in the rain
gotta talk to you
don't want to listen
Give me a chance to explain
You owe me that much
Nora still walking toward her car in the downpour
don't owe you anything
lets her walk away
After a beat, he yells out
It was a lousy thing to do, okay
It was a lousy thing to use you to get back at your husband
but the fact is that  never would have met you otherwise
Nora stops and turns to look at
(more quietly) It was lousy
it was a disgusting, terrible thing
but a lot of good came out of it
What kind of a person would come up with such a devious thing
'm not always a nice guy, admit that

it's an occupational hazard

What kind of character flaw do  have
didn't want to have to come here
wish that  didn't have to ever see you again
've gone this far in my life without having to have this kind of thing happen to me
was going through life, sailing along, pretty good
doing okay, and  tried to get even with some crazy guy
and 'm here
The wet becomes you
Gets rid of some of the slickness

Okay, said that

It pisses the hell out of me, and 'm gonna tell you that to your face, but want to be with you because

Ya know what  mean

'm just getting used to ya, Sam
Let's face it, we're not exactly setting the world on fire
It's a slump

They're taking the furniture
The furniture, the whole house
They locked it up
they confiscated it

You expect to get some preferential treatment you're some special case
You've got to pay your taxes just like everybody else has to pay their taxes
Tilley shrugs
How many arguments did we used to have about filing your taxes
We had a lot of arguments
Nora starts toward him
Tilley sits on the steps

He told you it was about eggs
The guy tried to break into my house
He tried to steal things from me

Bad choice

No divorce
Nora looks at him, starts to say something, then stands up and walks down the steps of the house toward her car

Nora turns toward Tilley and suddenly snaps
My benefit

You know something, Stanley, can always smell a guy who's not made of tin
He walks over to Stanley
It's against the law to steal files

You work for the Commission, is that it
Stan nods "yes
" Doesn't the Commission have enough information
They got to send out guys like you to spy
Well, we just started out, and if we had some really good hard facts of some infractions, it would give us a lot of credibility in the community
walks closer to Stanley, looks at him for a second, grabs him by his tie and pushes him backwards
Stanley crashes into the filing cabinet
You know what your big problem is, Stanley
You're lazy
If you want to find out stuff, then you dig
you get on the phone
you canvas
'We're from the Home Improvement Commission

that's what we do all the time
You're just lazy, Stanley
If we're doing something wrong, you should collect all your evidence
Instead, you snoop around
steal files

Undercover time
You think you're breaking up some big drug ring
Is this the Mafia you've infiltrated
All you've got here is a bunch of guys selling tin for Christ sake

As he's about to park his car, he sees Wing talking to Masters in the car next to his
Tilley's a bit confused, stays in his car watching them
After a couple of beats, Wing gets out of the car and heads for the Pimlico
Masters drives off
Tilley gets out of his car and catches up to Wing
Hey, Wing, isn't that the putz from the Commission
Points to car driving out of parking lot
Masters
Yeah
What the hell's he doing hanging around here
He wants information
nailed his ass the other day, Wing
Can't lay a finger on me
was amazing, you should have been there
was amazing was respectful, courteous, but was slipping and sliding
they couldn't touch me

138   :                                             138 got a real problem, Tilley
Come inside, 'll buy you a drink

The pianist is playing, and people are sitting around the piano joining in with the song
You're gonna sell me out to the Commission
Wing, am  hearing this right
'm up front with you about this
'm up front with ya, Tilley
've got my balls in a vice
what am  gonna do
Is this about the money  owe you
Are you just pissed
You want to get even because of the horse race
told ya it was an accident
Tilley, it's got nothing to do with the money
You're selling me out
You're gonna let them bury me
Jesus Christ, Wing
Jesus Christ
'm not gonna be able to work in this business
Wing, this was my chosen field
Masters was gonna take this company apart
You're the low man on the totem pole, Tilley
There's a lot of guys earning a good living
no sense for it all to go up in smoke
You understand, don't you, Tilley
It's just business

Listen, Tilley, you owe me sixteen plus from the race, and you're in for over two grand on the books, so  tell you what
'll wipe the slate clean
He takes out his wallet from his pocket, and peels off a few notes
Here's a thou until you get yourself set up
can do no better than that
(looking at the money) You'd sell me out for a lousy three thousand dollars
Three thousand dollars and  got to go down the toilet
Jesus Christ, Wing, how long the two of us been busting our asses together Jesus Christ
We got some history to this relationship for Christ sake
Masters puts a little squeeze on you, you just sell out
Three thousand dollars
The bottom line is, 'm running a business, Tilley
(he peels off another couple of hundred dollars from his wallet) Here's another deuce
carried you a long time, Tilley
've done a damn sight more than a lot of other guys would have done for you
and  don't see no gratitude from you
He gets up to leave

comes into the kitchen of his apartment
He is tying his tie
to include Nora
can't believe that you're up so early
This is a rare occasion
Yeah
just got some business downtown  gotta take care of
He stands there watching Nora as she prepares the plates of food
Toast will be ready in a second
Coffee's on the table
He continues to stand watching her -- she's not aware that he's watching her
She waits for the toast to pop up out of the toaster
Listen, Nora
um
er lied to you the other day
Nora is still waiting for the toast, looking inside the toaster to see if it's getting brown
How so
went to see Tilley about the divorce
She turns to look at him
He was not too agreeable, and one thing led to another, and we decided to shoot some pool to settle the matter
What

We played pool
If  won he'd give you up, if  lost 'd give you up
You played pool for me
Nora,  had no choice
It's the most despicable thing 've ever heard in my life mean, it's disgusting
guys shooting pool to determine my future
Nora,  had no choice
(beat) Hand me the toast
Get the toast yourself
takes the toast out of the toaster
'm just trying to be honest
It's been on my mind
on my conscience
He picks up a plate
This plate yours or mine
Why don't you take both
maybe you can choke to death on one of them
takes one of the plates and goes toward the table
Nora watches him a beat, amazed that he doesn't seem to recognize the seriousness of the situation

how     can you not understand how wrong     that is
can't understand that     mentality
Shoot pool for me
It's      insane
dips his toast into his eggs
Tilley is not the     most rational man in this world
tried to talk to him
he     wouldn't listen
So, what      are my options
You know what 'm     saying
What are my options
can't believe you had to shoot pool
Don't you understand that don't you understand how crazy that is
You're sitting there
you're eating your eggs as if it's normal business in life here
Like feudal lords or something you used to read about in history books
All right, 'm sorry
Beat
What happened

He dips more toast into his eggs and eats
You lost
blew the eight ball
You lost

It means 'm supposed to give you up, and 'm never supposed to see you again
Will you stop eating the eggs for a minute
How can you tell me things like this and casually eat your eggs
What does this mean, Bill
Well, 'm supposed to give you up as part of honoring that agreement, but 'm not that honorable a guy
He smiles, takes a quick sip of his coffee
gotta go
Why are you running off so fast here
told you,  got some business downtown
He gives her a kiss
Starts to go, turns back, gives her another kiss, more passionate this time

He glances up, his eyes drop and then he looks the opposite side of the corri- dor where  sits on another bench against a wall glances off at Tilley and then drops his eyes Tilley

Both men are uncomfortable with one another's presence
(finally, to ) You gotta testify, huh
You

You got a lawyer
Nah

The only way  could think to get out of this business
He smiles
(points, laughing) Hey, that's good
that's good, yeah
There's activity in the hallway

Tilley stands

She's doin' all right

-      -  147 of the Home Improvement Commission
Five  or six commissioners are behind a long table, led by John Masters, there is a gallery of observers, and Tilley sits at the defense table across from the commissioners
(into microphone) Are you aware that that's a violation of sections 258 and 261
() 154
147   :                                                  147 'm not aware of the section numbers
Sometimes you get a little overzealous in the heat of the sales pitch, that's all
is watching the proceedings
him
(
) Was it the heat of the sales pitch on February 23rd of this year that made you write across a contract 'This Job Is Free'
who is falling apart
As  remember, no sale was made concerning those customers
It fell out because a loan couldn't be arranged, but the people did agree in principle
(beat) The point that we'd like to stress, is that you misled these people
Told them the job was free
Then you sent in your closer with some cover story about how you had suffered a nervous breakdown, and a sale was ultimately made for twenty-three hundred and seventy- seven dollars
That is misleading and deceptive sales practice
It was    temporary insanity don't    know
it just came over me it    might have been something ate
don't know
it was crazy,    'm the first to admit it was a    crazy thing to do
Believe me
() 155
147   :   (2)                                            147 (cutting him off) We have other specific examples of deceptive sales practices on your behalf concerning a job carried out on December 11, 1962
You violated sections 241 and 247
And concerning a job sold to Mr
and Mrs
DeFranco on October 9, 1962, violations of sections 251 and 257 took place
What are all these numbers here
'm not familiar with all these section violations
who is watching the proceedings intently
(
) It is the feeling of this commission that these infractions are severe violations of the Home Improvement Laws, and therefore constitute misuse of the license to sell aluminum siding as approved by this state
It is the decision of this commission to revoke your license to sell aluminum siding
He's not very happy
(
) Which will prohibit you from practicing in the state of Maryland
Are you sure
Maybe the guys want to think this over

147   :   (3)                                           147 Thank you, Mr
Tilley
You may hand over your license to the clerk of the commission on your way out

Tilley pulls out his wallet, takes out a small document, and throws it down on the desk
He exits the building

You have the right to have a lawyer present if you so wish
do not wish

Suddenly he realizes that there's an empty space and his car is gone
Tilley's a little confused, thinking that perhaps he parked elsewhere
walks up to Tilley

Cadillac
Yeah
What about it
man told me to say they took it
Who took it
Man said, the tax man
Gave me a dollar to tell you so
Tilley walks over and stands in the empty space where his car had been
Tax man
Fucking
How low can you get
How low can you get
He walks around in the space as if somehow his car might reappear
He mumbles to himself
They're lowlife
How can people come and take a man's car
His Cadillac

think with the number of violations on your record, Mr
Babowski, this commission has no recourse but to revoke your state license

) Would you please drop    off your license with the clerk    of the commission on your way    out

gets up and walks to the back of the  room
He stops at the same desk as Tilley, but instead  of going into his wallet like Tilley, he just reaches  into his suit pocket, pulls out a license document and  tosses it onto the table
Then he heads out the door
: 151
-                                  151 walks down the street, making for his car
He sees Tilley still standing in the vacant parking space
Tilley sees

Some bullshit commission, huh
(beat) Tell me, where's it written it the Constitution that says you can't hustle for money
Where's it written
It ain't like  went into an alley and hit a guy over the head with a brick and stole his money
not like  broke into somebody's house and stole his stuff
All 'm doing is selling
where's the crime in that
