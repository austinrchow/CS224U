"  " by Peter Berg September 2, 1997 : Pitch black
Dead quiet
Dim faint light appears in the distance, approaching, growing larger
As the light nears, we recognize car headlights
Closer and closer until the car is bearing down upon us with great force
Two men in the front seat,  and
Fisher drives
All seems quite normal until we take a closer look, sweat matts hair, dirt stains on white tuxedo shirts hands are blistered and bloody
They seem almost entranced
That ought to be about the end of that
Yup
Fisher
(
) "The Oakland Raiders have taken a 7 - 6 lead in a, tough, football game and this crowd is standing
" '  -  -        - 23RD, 1972 Playoff game between the Oakland Raiders and the Pittsburgh Steelers
Scoreboard reads: 22 seconds, 4th down, 10 yards to go, 4th quarter
(
) "Hang on to your hats, here come the Steelers out of the Huddle
" - transfixed
(
) "It comes down to one big play, 4th down, ten yards to go
Terry Bradshaw at the controls
" Bradshaw throws
(
) "And Bradshaw, back and looking
Again, Bradshaw running out of the pocket
Looking for someone to throw to
" Bradshaw throws
(
) Bradshaw fires it down the field and there's a collision
" The ball bounces off the helmet of a Raider player and is caught low by the Steelers'
(
) "
and it's caught out of the air
The ball is pulled in by Franco Harris
" - (
) Franco Harris running for the end zone, all but home
" Oncoming headlights illuminate Fisher's face
: : -
- down a long line of couples
Some with kids, some old, some young, all waiting to pay their $55 and pick up their marriage license
We  on a young couple, late 20's,   and his fiancee,
Fisher has a blondish quality to him, unassuming, pleasant, attentive, a bit more reactive than he could be
Liz is quite attractive, but somewhat tense, and not at all happy about having to stand in this very slow moving line
This is ridiculous
Government cutbacks
Why can't we do it through the mail
(patient) We missed the deadline
Can't we do it on the phone
don't think so
In front of them a middle-aged   make-out intensely while their chubby little    stares at Liz
Why is this Kid staring at me
'm not sure
Liz pulls a note-pad out of her daypack
(reading from her notes) Did you send in all of the deposit checks
think so
(pause) What do you mean, you think so
sent a lot of checks, 'm not sure what all of them are
The wedding cake check
Sent it
Photographer
Sent it
Florist
Yup
Caterer
Yes
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge
(beat) think  forgot the tent
(somewhat alarmed) You forgot the tent
think so
Why
Why what
Why did you forget the tent check
didn't mean to Liz
'm sorry
You can't play around with these tent people
'm not playing around
forgot
What else have you forgot
How could  know what else  forgot
'm working my ass off here
've taken care of absolutely everything Keith
Because you wanted to
You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's
Don't you dare
What
Don't you put this on me
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't
behind them stares at Liz, a bit confused
(trying to calm her) Stop it
'm sorry
(trying to control herself) You know how important this is to my mother
You know that
'm sorry
'm sorry  forgot the tent
don't think  forgot anything else
(not bitchy) bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks
Are we going to do this again
'm just saying  bet those checks all found the mailboxes
wouldn't know
It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas
(patient) They organized this, not me
have nothing to do with it
Well it's bad timing
How do you figure
Right before the wedding
It's a bachelor party
You sort of have to do it before the wedding
suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this
He is
He's a moron
He's my friend
He's not a moron
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas
a "Fred Sands" realty sign being pounded into the ground
Pictured on the sign, as "offered by," is realtor , 30-ish, short hair, smiling with bizarre sincerity
to reveal, David Boyd in the flesh, suit jacket off, pounding away, sinking the sign into the front yard of a cute little house
His
Boyd, gets the phone from his jacket
(into phone) David Boyd
Tina
Great
Okay
Here's the deal, we're talking five guys
Hard Rock
Nice guys Tina
My friends
Yeah
'm calling you directly so you don't have to go through the agency
(suddenly, over his shoulder) (back into phone) That's correct
Cash straight to you
Yes
Twelve hundred
don't think so
It's just stripping
Just a show
Hold on
(
) Could you please wait off the property
, obviously here to see the house
We're just trying to sneak a peak
Just stay off the property until 'm off the phone
Why
Cause that's the way they do it
Bewildered and somewhat intimidated, they back off
(back into phone) So it's five guys, Hard Rock Casino
Nine hundred bucks and you do the thing with the rubber hoses
Are you in
Tina, are you in
Good
Boyd hangs up, puts on his jacket and turns with the same bizarre insincere smile in his photo
Hand extended
David Boyd, nice to meet you
Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality
What are you talking about
'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with
about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself
asked you to marry me
'm ready for marriage
That's responsibility
That's growth
just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships
Who else
Charles Moore for instants
You don't like Moore
Since when
It's not that  don't like him
But the wedding has really got me thinking and
just keep myself opening up
Growning
And  want you keeping up with me here
What does Moore have to do with your growing
just don't see him in the big picture
've known him since Cub Scouts
He's weird
He's quiet
He's weird
- Late twenties, a chef in a very upscale, very busy
His name, "Moore," is embroidered on his white chef's jacket
Food orders fly all around as Moore works with a mesmerizing focus, a poetic sense of purpose, fifteen things going on at once; he chops, sautes, braises, etc
, in a perfect mute silence
He just doesn't talk a lot
Why
What's his problem
He's a great chef
He's weird
And  expect more from you
You expect more what
You're going to be hungover for three days
Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them
Time out
It's vile
People are staring
That's absurd
've seen it on television
'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body
(starts to cry) am not common Keith
am not common
am a creature like no other and  will not be commoned
Is that to much to ask
(screaming) Is that to much to ask
You will not be common
Finally, at the head of the line, Liz steps up to the clerk
Marriage license please
Fisher and Liz emerge, start for the parking lot
Liz stops to look at Fisher, her eyes well with tears, vulnerable and apologetic
Do you love me
Of course
How much
With all my heart
(vulnerable) Kiss me
takes her into his arms, pulls her to him, kisses her hard, for all it's worth
Desk after desk after desk of identical men, seemingly repeating the same task
We find Fisher at one of the desks, number crunching
At the desk across from Fisher sits
, short, compact, with a severe personality disorder, masquerading as semi-appropriate behavior
That's just insecurity
don't know
She's really been stressing out
Just insecurity
Nut crunching gut splinters
What does that mean
It means she's insecure
About what
Michael's phone rings
(picks up) Mike Brenn
Yes
Yes

5 for 6
At 29
83 at 9
(hangs up) 'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards
(beat) just want her to be happy
Same alarm clock every morning, same two pops on the same snooze button
( ; picks up) Michael Brenn
Yes
Yes
(looking through stacks of stats) Hold your horses
Okay
Got it

321 at 17
28 for 6
6 at 9
256 out at 3432
343
(hangs up) Same shower, towel, toothbrush, razor, hair gel
It's a fucking epidemic Fisher and you better start addressing it
You're getting married and 'm not going to candy-coat it
It just gets worse
It's an eighteen wheel cement mixer that will crush every bone in your body
Fisher looks pale
'm not breathing right
You're not breathing right
Lately 'll just start getting lightheaded, dizzy, and  realize haven't breathed in like two minutes
, Michael's older brother, mid-30's, a bit soft in the belly, approaches, more or less in charge
(to Michael) We're leaving from my house in three hours
If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then
First of all
(cuts him off) No first of all
'm not in a game mood
You're interrupting a personal conversation
(to Fisher) Sorry Fish
We'll be ready Adam
know you'll be
(to Michael) Three hours
Adam goes
don't care for him
He's your brother
So
Fisher's phone
(pick's up) Keith Fisher
Liz sits at the kitchen table, in a mild panic
(into phone) We've got problems here
Problems
Liz and Fisher
Seating problems
Okay
Keith do not trivialize this
'm not
What's the problem
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded
What kind of seats can we have
Not padded ones
So what do we do
You go down there
Go down where
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out
Honey  don't have the time
need your help
We're leaving in three hours
(starts to cry) need your help
'll call them from the road
Do you love me
More than  ever imagined being able to love anyone ever
Take care of those chairs
We're leaving from Adam's
Come send me off
Maybe
'  - , ,  in the middle,  and his older brother, , all in suits pose in front of Adam's brand new, state of the art, Chevy Minivan while Adam's very aggressive wife, , mired in domestic resentment, focuses her camera
Notice how clean and well-behaved they all appear, respectable members of modern society
Timmy, Adam Jr
, take a good look at this
Adam's and Lois' kids, Timmy, 8, and Adam Jr
, 10, watch with Liz
(Adam Jr
, in leg braces and crutches, suffers from muscular dystrophy) We will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours, no matter how low, how vile
embarrassing, shameful
regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state
The stone age
The post-Vegas Man
mutant species
Okay boys, smile
Lois clicks off photos of the men
All right
As you were
The guys break
Fisher goes to Liz
Will you please call the chair people
will
Do you love me
Of course
Just call and let me know that your okay
love you
Have a nice bachelor party
Adam kisses Lois and the kids goodbye
Adam Jr
nearly looses his balance in the excitement, Adam catches him
Boyd starts to get in the drivers seat
Not on your life
Boyd slides over shotgun, cranks the
Fisher's the last one in
He slides the big Minivan door shut and they're off
Adam looks in the rearview mirror, Lois, Liz, Timmy wave goodbye
Adam Jr
waves one of his crutches
-    - The minivan cruises east: from Santa Monica; through downtown Los Angeles; and the City of Industry
At the turn off, a freeway sign reads; "Las Vegas 385 miles
" - You're a fucking moron
It's my fucking opinion
It's really a stupid opinion
You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak
Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed
No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me
Boyd brought up divorce statistics
The hell  did
The hell you didn't
The hell  did
You said one in two marriages end in divorce
never heard that
You said that Boyd
Well,  didn't mean it
You're an asshole Adam
You're an asshole
Oh, and why am  an asshole
Multiple reasons
Name one
don't have to
As they ride through the lifeless desert, Fisher dials his cell phone
(into phone) Is this Pico Party rents
Can  speak to whomever is in charge of chairs
Chairs
Boyd checks his watch
Four hours and fifteen minutes can make Vegas in 3 and change
'm not getting a ticket
(on cell phone) Tony
This is Keith Fisher
You're doing my wedding and 'm calling about the chair situation
Yeah, 'll hold
Who's up for making some real money
Don't even start
You want to hear me out
Nope
Moore
No  don't
Fish
Not really
(into phone) Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs
Prison Communication Systems
(no response) An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado
Yes sir
Nobody gives a fuck
(into phone) No, 'm holding for Tony
In chairs
Keith Fisher
Okay
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars
(into phone) We need padded chairs
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4
38, or, in plain English
What is wrong with you people
'm a helper here
Your investment ideas never work out
That's the whole point
They rarely work out
But on occasion they do
And when they do, they do big
Your ideas never work out
Oh really
Starbucks
That's one idea
(into phone) No
we want padded chairs
okay
One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars
You can't keep bringing up Starbucks
That was your only real hit in like 75 tries
set up Fisher with the broker that found his house
Took care of that one, didn't
(beat) Prison Communications
don't think so Boyd
Fine
Don't come crying to Boyd
No sir
He turns away from the guys and stares out the window
(
) Yes,  was holding for Tony in chairs
have a chair problem
No, 'm not Tony,  need to speak to Tony
The minivan cruises through Death Valley in route to Vegas
'  -  - North of Vegas
The minivan is parked high on a cliff overlooking the city
couple of Tequila bottles on ice, a case of Heineken
The boys are arming up
All the bullshit aside Fish, we've been coming up here for what, eight years
Boyd, carving a branch with his boy scout knife
More
Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life
Good times
Drum banging real times
Real times
They've all been real times
And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as  have, come to except the letting go of of old ways
Soon, the mellowing will begin
But not tonight
Not tonight
Tonight we return once again to the cave
Tonight we let the monsters out
We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Kahn, Joe Namath, , Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway
(screaming) Franco mother-fucking Harris
Keith Richards, Dean Martin
Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter
Thompson
dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing
So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard
Boyd holds the bottle above his head as the guys raise their glasses in a toast
He who acts the beast, rids himself of the pain of being a man
The guys smash the bottles together in an explosion of glass and the golden Tequila
- Improvised
fly
and    on cell phone calls about the chairs again
Shot after shot after shot after shot
throws back a shot, falls off his stool
Fisher sneaks a call to liz
(
) Hello
Hi
- '  ' Liz is making place cards, " Love Lucy" is on the
Hi
(teasing) Are you calling from jail
(
) Not yet
Well, the night is young
Did you straighten out the chair situation
(
) 'm working on it, 've made three calls
(beat) can't stop thinking about how much love you
That's sweet
(
) Well  do
Well you should
(
) What are you doing
Just a bit of organizing
(
) Nesting
Yeah
Nesting
(
) 'm mad at you
Go have fun
Not too much
(
) 'll see you tomorrow
Fisher hangs up, a "crazy about the girl" smile on his face
' -   - The  is
The boys are super drunk in the swank bachelor party suite
stagger-dances on a table
stand at the wet-bar
don't hate women
You hate women
False
True
Not true
You have a King fantasy
am a lover
In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night
And what happens when you can't
(swigs whiskey; looks up) New king
Adam and Fisher
No
No
No
It's what my father said to me
He said it and he meant it
He said to me
He said, Adam, he said
He told me and  heard him
he said
(struggles to remember) Hell he said so many Goddamn things can't remember everything he said for Christsake
Right
That's exactly what 'm saying
My father said, first of all, 'm your father not your friend
'm your father
Are you solid with that
No
think it's fucked
Then fuck what your father said, cause 'm gonna tell you right now
You'll know what it's all about, why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning, and the streetlight's coming through the window and it's just catching a corner of her face, like a sleeping angel
And her hair smells sweet and she's your's
She's all your's
Do you see where 'm going here
speed hitting cocaine
If 'm the king of Israel,  say to myself, King,  say to myself, King
Take a good look around
What do see
Israel doesn't have a King
Then what do they have
They have a president
Benjamin Yahoo something
say to myself, look at the map
Look what's all around you
People who wish bad bad things for you and your people
For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody
It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears
Then the gunpowder revolution
Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot
What's your point
Now if 'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time
right
Am  right
The Israelis can protect themselves
They got the Mossad thing happening
Mossad's for real, man
They scalp babies
There's my point exactly
What
What's your point
Take Mexico
What
Look up the chickens, dig up the holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long, stick it all on a big fucking tug boat
The whole country picks up and takes Mexico
crazed with the rhythm of the "Chemical Brothers," jumps up and down on the table
Fisher and Adam power shooting Tequila
The bucks gonna stop right here
(pounds his chest) If my son doesn't know the six New England states, if he has trouble with geography,  won't stick it in his face
'll help the little guy
'll put him in the car and take him out there
'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee Stadium
won't stare him down
Don't ever stare him down
won't do it
Don't eyeball your kids
On the coffee table, dances the beasty dance
The Mexicans would love it
They're dying for a little order down there
They need direction
They need leadership
That's what 'm saying
Let the Israelis straighten it up
They got plenty of room down there, number one
Plus, and this is just a plus, they kind of look alike -- the Jews and the Mexicans
So  think on a whole your average Joe Mexican is gonna have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing
Am  right
The
tell mine that they're little men
tell them they're strong
They make me feel joy
let 'em know
So they really know that  need them just as much
You know
Just as much man
And you know, you're their godfather
know and 'm honored
If anything ever happens to me
know
'see
That's the real point here
That's what 'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare
What's left
The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see
The tiny little
Moore is on the balcony
The stripper's here
(bombed) Excellent
He and Fisher stagger aside
Boyd introduces , a devastatingly sexy Asian girl, to all the boys
Gentlemen, this is Tina
The guys, wasted, attempt to greet Tina
Who's the lucky groom
The guys point at Fisher, roaring
Tina presses her lips to Fisher's ear
Hi Fisher
Boyd dims the lights, cranks up the  as the guys stumble for position on and around the couch
Tina starts to move, very sexy
Michael tokes a joint
God,  love women
' : dances, slowly peeling off her clothes
The guys are into it
Michael seems especially turned-on
Tina moves in on Fisher, starts a very nasty lap dance
somehow incorporating a rubber hose
The guys hoop and holler
Michael is mesmerized
Tina grinds on Fisher's lap, touching her nipples
Michael's going crazy
He tries to touch her, she slaps his hand away
Fisher can't take it anymore
Tina relents
moves on
Michael reaches for her leg like a dog in heat
She passes over him, teasing, tormenting him, and settles onto Adam's lap
The guys roar in approval
Michael glowers
Adam turns bright red as Tina arouses and rides him
Michael starts to burn
The guys egg Tina on, she gets off on Adam's shyness, rubs her breasts in his face
The guys are howling
Tina sucks one of Adam's fingers into her mouth
Michael looks like he's going to explode
Adam's overwhelmed, he politely bails out
(whispers to Fish) She's all your's Fish
Anything you want
Happy bachelor party
can't
(jumps up) 'll take a ride
Go for it
(to Tina) Come on
(to Boyd) You said just dancing
(re: money) 'll take good care of you
(dead flat; re: Michael) With him
(beat) Lucky me
Michael moves in on Tina
Hesitantly, she leads him into the master bedroom
She's fucking hot
need a drink
Tequila
Boyd reaches for the bottle as the beat goes on
- Distorted, a bit crooked
and  constantly changing levels
We're not sure who's saying what
We're not sure of physical geography
The one thing we are sure of is that  is fucking the hell out of Tina in the bathroom
: : Michael works Tina from behind
: bouncing off the furniture
and , wildly high
sprays beer on Adam, who returns fire
Drunk they start wrestling, throwing each other around the room, knocking over furniture
: Michael, tightly, ties Tina's hands behind her back with her rubber hose
Oh come on
want to play
It's gonna cost extra
will pay
: Fisher spraying beer all over Adam and Boyd as they knock a table over and end up tangled and brawling on the floor
: Michael screwing the hell out of Tina
Easy baby, easy
: : Moore wildly leaps from the couch to the chair, to another chair, back to the couch
: Michael plows like a monster into Tina, hands tied behind her back
her stiletto heels, digging into the marble floor
One of her heels breaks
she starts to slip
: Moore jumps, misses the chair, falling down on the glass coffee table,
: Tina falls, Michael reaches too late, she can't break her fall with her hands tied behind her
she's going down
: Moore falls through the shattered glass, to the floor
: Tina hits her head hard on the porcelain toilet
: Fisher, Adam, and Boyd stop brawling, stare down at Moore covered in glass
(beat) Cool
Moore is fine, not even a scratch
The guys break into , completely ; shaking, roaring, releasing
of each  until
One by one
they sober up
looking
as his smile slowly fades to confusion, he stares
at
Standing in the door, face ghost white, blood dripping from his fingers
really fucked up
The guys rush in
Stop dead in their tracks
On the floor, legs twisted underneath her, lies growing in a growing puddle of dark blood
as the guys stare, trying to comprehend
Jesus
Don't touch her
Call 911
(in shock) was just playing
we were playing just playing around
(examines Tina) She's dead
No
No
How do you know she's dead
She's got no fucking pulse
You don't know what you're doing
Boyd pushes Adam out of the way
Starts feeling her pulse
(not getting anything) Where do you look
What side of the neck
Left side
Either side you idiot
'm calling 911
(semi-gone) What happened
Oh my God
We were playing
she slipped
she hit her head
(incredulous) Playing
Adam moves into the living room, heads for the phone
Boyd intercepts him
They wrestle for the phone
Wait
What
What are you doing
(hysterical) What are you talking about
What do you think you are doing
'm calling the ambulance
Just wait a second
Wait one second
Okay
What are you doing
Calling the ambulance
Why
(beat) Why
She's dead
Why are you calling an ambulance
reasonable point
We have to call the ambulance
Why
Fisher entering, freaked
Oh, Jesus
call the police
No
She's dead
Call somebody
Shut up
Call 911
Shut up
She slipped
(attacking Michael) What did you do
(defensive) You never heard of accidents
Get off me
Adam slaps Michael
Moore tries to break it up
Everybody shut up
Listen to me
Please
Everybody just calm down a bit here
Okay
First
are we sure she's dead
Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating
She's dead
It was an accident
Are you sure this was an accident
You're a lying deviant
What did you do
The floor was wet
She slipped
Why was the floor wet
don't know why the floor was wet
Why
Fisher wanders back to the bathroom door where Moore is; they stare down at Tina as the conversation rages in the b
g
Stop it
Listen to me
Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation,
Let's just review our options here
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom
What options
Call the police
Call the police
Okay, that's one option
That is not an "option
" There is no multiple choice here
Yes sir, there sure is an option here
There are always options
Fisher and Moore
've never seen a dead person
As Moore moves in, transfixed, to take a closer look
(enraged) Fuck
Fuck you fucking guys
Well we can definitely call the police
That's an easy call
If we call the police
What happens
(silence) They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom
They ask us
What happened
We say, ah
our friend, Michael
(to Adam) Your brother
got a little out of control
they were making love
and he got a little excited
and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose
Stop it
There's more
Just stop
Just giving the facts
'm calling the police
What were we doing officer
Why didn't we help her
Well
we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing
Fisher here is getting married in three days
Beautiful wife
he didn't have anything at all to do with it
It was all Michael here
just Michael
You don't play games with Homicide police
There are no options here
There is not the luxury of worrying about how the fallout will settle
've known him for while maybe twenty years kind of a close friend but hey what the heck officer, take him away, go on it's for his own good
(outraged) What are you talking about
Adam's right
We don't have a choice here Boyd
mean what are you talking about
What options
(calm) Bury her out in the desert
(sarcastic) Sure, why not
He's right
We can take her out to Red Rock
Find some quiet place
and put her in the ground
You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman
We can do this
We can get her out of here
Have you completely lost your mind
So you get her out of here
So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone
Nobody knows she's here
called her personally
Nobody knows
Oh for Christsake Boyd
Somebody must know she's here
Nobody knows
, as the guys digest this point
Her blood is all over the bathroom
'd say that's a bit of a  problem
It's a marble floor, we can clean it up
Oh God
This is insane
What's insane is the fact that Michael here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet
That's insane
They'll get us on accessory to murder
Bullshit it's not accessory
didn't do shit
You call the cops, you explain it was an accident
Her fucking head was caved in
So
didn't fucking do it
She's got bondage burns on her wrists
There's blow all over the room, Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion
This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month
Michael goes down, we all go down
'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore
That's a horrible ugly comment
"Dead whore
" She's a person
(falling away) 'm getting married
'm sorry
'm sorry
'm sorry
've got a wife and two boys
Fisher shuffles to a corner, collapses, head in hands
(unflappably calm) Lets take a vote
simple vote
Two choices; we clean up the mess
Right now
Bury it in the desert, go home, and never look back
Or, we can call the police
Open those doors, roll the dice and hope that it's only Michael who falls
Let's take a vote
Desert
or police
looks around
Raises his hand
Desert
He looks at
(beat) Fucking desert
(to Fisher) Fish, 'm really sorry
just owe you man
(puts up his hand) Desert
All eyes on , no response
Nobody knows she's here
Good God
Good God
All eyes on
He takes a while
Finally, How do we get her out of here
reasonable question
Boyd thinks
Wrap her up in blankets
Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car
Done
(beat) You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear
What about the blood
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works
Have you ever done this before
The reality is, you take away the horror of this situation, take away the tragedy of the death, take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned, beaten, into your head since grade one
What are we left with
What
115 lb
problem
115 lbs
that must be moved from point to point
Now, a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line
But that line exists and  see it
see that line
Trust me
Adam
Trust me
can take care of this
The five men stop breathing
Somebody's at the door
Stunned silence
The guys stare at each other in horror
(
) Hello
Is anyone in there
Boyd races to the door, eyes the peephole
' , through the peephole, outside in the hall, a man
, early 30's, fairly unassuming
(calls out) What is it
(
) Ah, yeah, hi
Is Tina there
Adam throws his head in his hands
(through door) What
(
) 'm with Tina
Is she there
Boyd indicates to the guys to be cool
She's not here
(
) Where is she
She's here
She's just
Hold on a second
Boyd turns as the guys freak
Crazed bits of panicked conversation --
(
) Could you open the door please
Boyd moves back to the door, slowly, opens it
Ralph steps in
Takes a good look around
'  of the fairly destroyed hotel room and five severely traumatized men
Okay
Hi
So who's the lucky guy
Who
The groom
Me
Cool
(beat) You all dudes from
Yup
Doing the bachelor party thing
That's right
Sin City
Devil's Playground
The Black Bitch
All day every day
(beat) Where's Tina
She's in the bathroom
she's still working
She's still working
That's right
Sweet deal
Ralph checks the rest of the guys
Some strange eye contact
Extremely uncomfortable
Is everything okay
Great
Fine
Perfect
More
(indicating bathroom) 'm gonna just tell her 'm waiting
He starts for the bathroom
She's in there
'm just gonna let her know 'm here
And Ralph is on his way to the bathroom
And the guys are freaking as Ralph moves through the bedroom up towards the bathroom
Hand on door -- opening door -- stepping in -- and Ralph sees Tina
, in shock, staring, back-peddles
My God
As Ralph starts to turn -- (
) No
-- his Boy Scout knife raised above his head -- driving it into Ralph's neck
as Ralph's jugular is severed
Ralph struggles
Boyd wrestles him back toward the bathroom
Help me
Don't let him bleed on the carpet
And  is there
Helping Boyd wrestle the thrashing Ralph into the bathroom
Ralph fights like a gilled Marlin
They shove him into the bathroom
Boyd slams the door shut
Holds it tight as Ralph tries to force it back open
He'll bleed out
He'll bleed dry
Help me hold the door
And help they do
Michael, Moore and Adam all hold the door shut as Ralph continues to fight for his life
Slowly the force of his  eases
We hear Ralph slowing down
The thrashing slows
softer
The  quiet
softer
Just a slight
Ralph is going
going
Ralph is gone
Eight hands slowly peel off the bathroom door
Devastating as the guys attempt to process this, the latest of developments
with Fisher staring, blotto
The door slowly opens
Boyd first -- then the rest of the guy's heads slowly appear in the doorway
Oh God
And Moore is out the door, racing for a garbage can to relieve himself
' An absolute blood bath
The walls are covered with Ralph's arterial spray
Tina lies, still dead on her side
Ralph has somehow "assumed the position" dead, head in the bathtub bizarre and gruesome sight
Boyd surveys the carnage, takes charge
(with military precision) All right people
New plan
Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan
(beyond shock) 'm calling the police
So help me God you touch that phone and  bury you with them
(beat) Surrender is no longer an option repeat -- It is not an option
Is there anyone who does not understand that
Fisher's response is to join Moore, as he searches for a garbage can to puke in
Michael just stares
little gut check time fellas time for some serious self- exploration
How do  function
For real
No more bullshit
Can  keep my cool when they bounce my bananas
When they won't play my fucking song
etc, etc
Do you get me
Do you get me
Not really
no
Not a problem
Understand not my words, but follow my orders
Follow my orders - The boys move down the isles of the massive 24 hour everything store, Boyd pushes a cart, grabbing; cleaning supplies, tarp, tape, giant pruning shears, etc
(
) We will organize, we will mobilize, we will maximize and prioritize
Moore grabs a plastic garbage can off a shelf and pukes in it for all he's worth
The boys attempt to look natural as they stroll through the casino with their supplies
Late night gamblers pay them little notice
Boyd turns up the
Let's do it people
: Moore and Fisher scrub blood from the carpet
Fisher keeps forgetting to breath
Michael and Boyd put Tina and Ralph in the bath tub
Adam sits in shock on the floor
Fisher and Moore try to fix a broken chair
Boyd starts to dismember Ralph with the pruning shears, like cutting the joints of a roasted chicken
Adam stares at the wall
Michael wraps one of Ralph's feet in plastic, puts it in a suitcase
Boyd saws
Michael wraps
Fisher and Moore clean
Adam slowly straightens up a lamp, begins to help
-- the last of the body parts, Tina's head, is wrapped in plastic, packed in a suitcase
The bathroom has been remarkably cleaned up
Just a bit of blood left in the tub
Boyd looks pleased
All right
Looking good people
The minivan bumps along a deserted road at a snail's pace
Adam drives, cringing with every bump and bang
Everyone is tense
Boyd eyes the clock
It's 4 a
m
Sun rises at 5:52
'm not wrecking the transmission
: The guys off-loading the suitcases
Fisher and Boyd digging holes
They start putting the suitcases in the holes
Wait
Wait a minute
What
We can't do this
We've already done this
No,  mean the suitcases
We can't bury them in suitcases
Why
It's sacrilegious
How do you figure
According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being
They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace
So that's what we're doing
No we're not
The bodies are all mixed up
We can't do this to them
She's Asian
They don't have Jews in Asia
That is absolutely not true
(beat) Well what the fuck are we supposed to do
(as if reasonable) Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs
No way
It has to be done
We have to get going
am not flexible on this
Alright
Let's do it
The guys start breaking down the body parts, ripping open cases
got her arm
Here's his head
As the guys put limbs with bodies
: Dirt being thrown on top of the reunited bodies until they are all completely buried
As the last of the dirt is packed down by Boyd
The guys stare down at the grave site
Now  am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing
It's not
It's not a good thing
But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play
We did what had to be done
And
well
'm proud of us
'm proud of each and every one of us
We performed
Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered
feel proud
We are all going straight to hell
Either hell or prison, whichever comes first
Wrong
That is flat out wrong
hell is for cowards, for hypocrites who fear to live by the strength of their own convictions
This is war
Given the circumstances and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we have chosen life over death
Two wrongs don't make a right
So our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less
Boyd
don't know man
It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing
you're all fucked-up in the head
got to agree with that
That is a load of shit
Personal power has nothing to do with any of this
Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this
Well that's just more than the man deserves
think we should say some words over the grave
What kind of words
'm talking about prayer
Go ahead
Fisher steps to the grave, looks down
Dear God
don't know how to pray
Just go ahead and say what's on your mind
Speak from the heart my brother
Adam turns in disgust
This is pathetic
You're pathetic
(turning on Michael) What did you say
(pointing) You're not a team player
Don't point at me
You never were a team player
That's why you never had any friends
have plenty of friends
The hell you do
The hell  don't
You have acquaintances -- business friends and superficial golf buddies
You have always been a fringe player
You have some serious male on male intimacy problems
What are you fucking talking about
Michael looks at Boyd
Michael, now is probably not the best time for this
No, this is the perfect time
This is real time
Adam
Your brother and , as well as several others present, have always suspected that you
(points to Adam) are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker
Adam stares stupefied at Boyd, then Michael
Finally, Fisher says his prayer
Dear God, please forgive us for what we have done here tonight
We have lost our way
Speaking for myself, let me say
: - Fisher's prayer over the guys driving home
Each lost in his own thoughts
(
) am deeply in love with the woman am about to marry and  look very much forward to raising a family and being a positive member of society
We promise, if you forgive us, we will never forget this tragedy and will try with all our powers to use it as a daily reminder that we are here on earth to do good not evil
Let us go from this day forward with new purpose and spirit
You have given us a second chance and let us take that second chance and use it as fuel to feed our fires of productivity so that the spirits of the two we now bury live on forever in the good deeds and positive achievements we from this moment on shall make our life's work
Continue as the minivan disappears down the freeway, heading back to Los Angeles
freeway sign reads, "Los Angeles, 358 miles
" (
) Thank you lord, and again, we ask for your forgiveness and guidance
Amen
- Adam watches his mini-van move through the wash and rinse cycle, staring, paranoid at the Mexican Towel Boy cleaning the interior
tries to open a child proof bottle of Excedrin
plays "Mrs
Pac-man" in the corner
' Moore dry heaves for all he's worth
Fisher finishes dialing, waits
Finally
(
) Hello
Hey
It's me
(
) Where are you
We're on our way home
just
we're running a little late
(
) How late
No
Just like an hour or so
(
) What about the chairs
Okay
(
) What okay
What
(
) The chairs
left a message
think it's going to be okay
(
) You sound funny
Did you do cocaine
No
No
'll see you in about four hours
As he hangs up the phone
(
) (distant; unheard) Do you love me
Fisher, in a daze, turns and walks into right into Adam who has been standing there listening
Adam doesn't look so good
want you to hear me out
What
You and  have done nothing
You especially
We are innocent
don't think so
We are
We go to the police
We tell them the truth
Now
Before they find out
Now
We save ourselves
The     beeps the horn, Adam jumps
The van is ready
Let's go
Adam stares daggers into Fisher
We save ourselves
It's our only chance
Adam heads back to the car, leaving Fisher alone
: '  - The shiny clean minivan cruises to a stop in front of the house
Adam Jr
, "Little Adam," and Timmy play in the fenced yard along with a couple of other kids
Adam stops the car
The guys sit in silence as the kids assault the truck, climbing all over it
Little Adam waves his crutches wildly
(screaming) Daddy's home
Daddy's home
Boyd addresses the fellas
The past is the past
Today is the beginning of the rest of our lives
Today is the best day of the rest of our lives
(disgusted) The first day
What
As Lois, with camera, and Liz, come out the front door
(disgusted & depressed) It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives
" However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever
Right
Right
Right
That's right
As the little kids put their lips up to the windows, making funny faces, You're goddamn right
Adam
Adam is silent, watching the beautiful chaos that is his family
(reluctant) Right
As the guys get out and are mauled by the hyper kids and Lois and Liz
(with camera) Group shot
Here we go boys
Yes sir, compare and contrast time
She starts herding the boys into a group pose
Feeling a little  are we
Do you kids take note
(taking pictures) See how pathetic Daddy and his jackass friends look
Fisher makes eye contact with Liz
What's the word on the chairs
'm working on it
Then you'd better work on it in the car
We gotta go see the Judge
' We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore
And we don't say "till death do us part
" Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love
" How does that sound
kind of like "till death do us part
"  mean, this is forever
In sickness and in health, through good times and bad
Honey, what do you think
Liz looks at Fisher who is a nuclear wreck, barely coherent
Yea
It's great
seems like don't know you've got all the important stuff in there
All right then
It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment
Will you have friends or family saying words -- singing or anything
(beat) Are we supposed to
It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision
Some do some don't
We don't think so
mean, we just want the singing when  come out
Okay great
What will that be
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar
Acoustic
What song
"You Send Me
" Oh  know that
How does it go
You know, (talks it) Darling you
you send me
Darling you
You mend me
(to Fisher) Honey, sing it for Judge Tower
In lieu of an anxiety attack, Fisher
(sings) "Darli
ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli
ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me
"At first  thought it was infatuation
But oh it's lasted so long
" & "Now  find myself wanting to marry you, marry you and take you home
" Judge Tower joins in and the three squeak out the chorus and it's pretty pathetic
: The guys are being fitted for their wedding tuxes
Lois takes pictures of the five groomsmen
Liz closely watches as the  makes adjustments to Fisher's tux
Adam looks sick
- Fisher and his dad walk along the pier eating hot dogs father and son moment
wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you
You know, just to be with you, father and son, before you run off and do your own husband, daddy thing
(starts to choke-up) 'm just so goddamn proud of you
God knows  didn't always play it right with you
You did all right dad
could have done it better
'm a fucking ball-buster  am
You never walked away dad
You could have walked away
'm just so scared of that song
That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day
he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play
got lots of bills come again next day
He's grown up just like me
My boy is just like me
" Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me
Harry Chaplin
"Cats in the Cradle
" Just kills me
love you dad
love you so much it hurts
Me and your mother marvel at what you have become
You're going to have a wonderful journey with this girl feel it deep inside
wonderful, magical journey
(cries again) And 'm, like  said, just so proud of how you turned out
(hugs Fisher) You go out and knock 'em dead Keith
Knock 'em dead
Off Fisher we
: ' Vegas Newspaper Metro Section slammed down on a desk --  small article on Tina, the now missing prostitute
Where did you get that
At the newsstand on 3rd
(falling apart) Fucking Boyd
That fucking idiot
They're on to us
They're not on to us
'm gonna call Boyd
Michael picks up the phone
' talking into cell phone
Oh that's just nothing
That's just a missing persons thing, that's all
You said nobody would miss her
No
said nobody knew she was coming to the hotel
(grabs phone) Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down
What does that mean
You got us into this mess
Oh  did
think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head
(freaks) Would you, shush
These phones aren't secure
Lighten up Adam
Show some character
Don't talk to me about character
Watch the tone fella
Fisher realizes he's not breathing
Fuck you Boyd
Any time fat boy
Boyd hangs up the phone, looks at his picture on the realty sign he just pounded into someone's yard
Behind the bizarre sincere smile we now see the eyes of a maniac
Boyd picks up the sledge hammer and swings wildly, destroying his sign, splintering it into kindling
Fisher and Liz taste different samples of cake and compare different cake designs with a
Surrounded by hundreds of different floral arrangements, Liz shows a zombied Fisher the flowers she's picked for the wedding
' beautiful country style beach house in Santa Monica
Liz, Fisher and the realtor, , walk into the charming kitchen
Fisher seems stresses by the price tag
love it
just love, love, love, love it
Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids
You sure got room for them
We're in no hurry
think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids
Take your time
wish  had
(hugs Fisher) We will
So where to on the honeymoon
This is our honeymoon
After the wedding, which we're paying for ourselves, and this house
Smart
Smart
Smart
Think big picture, take your time
wish had
That's our plan
Well,  just need your signature on these contracts and a deposit check so  can get the ball rolling
Liz looks at Fisher
She really wants the house
He takes out his checkbook
Liz throws her arms around Fisher, kisses him
How much
Five percent should be fine for now, which is, let's see, twenty thousand dollars
Of course 'll be splitting my commission with your friend
(beat) He is a very sweet man
Liz stares at Fisher
His hand shakes as he writes the check
- Adam, Lois and the kids pull into the mini-mart, up to the gas pump
' - Adam, ghost white, fumbles for a credit card as the kids go nuts in the back seat
(singing) "Do your balls hang low, do they wobble to and fro, can you tie 'em in a knot, can you tie 'em in a bow
" (snapping) Knock it off
Don't snap at them
They're driving me nuts
They're singing
black sedan, looking like an unmarked police car, pulls up nose-to-nose with them at the pump
in dark suits in the front look like cops
Adam can't help but notice
(getting out) It's a disgusting song
Adam slides his card through at the pump and starts filling his tank as one of the "suits" gets out of the black sedan and does the same
Adam and the "suit" make eye-contact
How ya doing
(nervous mumble) What
What's that
What did you say
said how's it going
didn't hear you
Well that's what  said
Adam nods, eyeing his gas pump, willing it to pump faster
His heart starts to pound, he looks away, sees
An  police car pull into the station, stops in front of the mini-mart
inside
adam, eye-balling the cop car
He slowly turns to steal a glance at the "suit
" How do you like that mini-van
Adam's tank is almost filled
He wants nothing more than to get out of there
Lois rolls down the window
Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts
What
They're screaming for Starbursts
Later
They're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache
Go get some fucking Starbursts
Adam looks from the suit to the cop car
Fine
with Adam as he walks from the pumping across the parking lot, past the cop car, his
- Adam quickly searches the candy section for Starburst
He looks out the window
' The "suit" has finished with the gas but he's not leaving
He's taking a close look at Adam's van
He seems to be checking the license plate
Oh my God
Adam is blocking the aisle
He doesn't notice a trying to get past
(
) Excuse me
Adam turns, panics, stumbles back, into the candy display and topples to the ground
lies flat on his back in a monster mess of candy
You okay
Adam scrambles to his feet, trying frantically to fix the major mess -- only making it worse
The approaches, pissed
Just leave it
(determined) It's okay
Leave it
Startled by his tone, Adam staggers back, into a Gatorade display, slips and topples to the ground
(on his back) 'm sorry
They young cop gives Adam a hand up
Adam stare at the cop
(tears in his eyes) 'm sorry
Adam scurries out of the Mini-Mart, the Cop watches in confusion
- As Adam races back to his car, the "Suit" moves in on him
The wife's begging me for one
How's the mileage
Adam jumps in the van, quickly starts it up
Where's the candy
There is no candy
What do you mean
It's it's a goddamn Mini-Mart
Dad
Adam, in a cold sweat, hauls out of the Gas Station, pulls into traffic, nearly gets hit, slams on the brakes, Lois rockets - into the dashboard

Moore smokes alone at the bar
Boyd and Michael charm a group of
Adam arrives with his family, Adam Jr
, Timmy and
Lois sporting a nose cast and two very black eyes
Boyd and Adam check each other out; hostile and suspicious
Adam takes Fisher aside
Have you thought about what  said
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please
got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack
(cuts him off) got you
(dazed) Where's the bathroom
- large dining room in a Westside restaurant has been taken over by the wedding party
Seventy-five guests, dressed up, are into the desserts
The toasts are about halfway over
stands in the middle of the room with the large blown-up pictures of Keith at different stages of his life
(holding picture of Keith, age 4, on a mule) And this is Keith at age four and his best friend "Bunker the Mule
" Evidently, when they were in camp, Keith and Boyd got into some serious arguments over exactly who was Keith's best friend -- Boyd or the mule
Mr
Fisher holds up a photo of a young Fisher and young Boyd, both scrappy and bloodied from a fist fight
Boyd sits with Moore at a table
Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey
(seated next to Liz) You always were a jealous man
Mr
Fisher holds up a picture of Keith, Boyd, Moore and Michael all in a Peewee Football uniforms
After camp came football, and for those of you not following the sports pages back in 1977, you might not remember the Peewee Powerhouse Oklahoma, who, under the brilliant leadership of your's truly, rolled to an auspicious league record of 0- 12 scoring exactly zero touchdowns
Adam, looking extremely uncomfortable, surrounded by his family
The problem was coaching
Poor leadership
As the room , Adam becomes visibly upset
Not keeping it together
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left
No, the problem, as  recall, was the lack of blocking
As the guys debate, in front of the room, who's fault Oklahoma's 0-12 season really was
Adam
He's had enough, excuses himself from the table
Fisher, seeing Adam, he quietly excuses himself
- Adam stands by his car trying to compose himself
Fisher approaches
You all right
can't fucking breathe
'm sorry
Boyd, followed by Michael exits the restaurant
(approaching) Definitely not cool
Definitely inappropriate behavior here
Shut up Boyd
Negative
This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior
He's having a problem here
What's the problem Adam
Moore joins the group
What's the problem
All eyes on Adam, who's eyes are starting to tear up
What is your problem
can't do this
Can't do what
We're gonna get caught
know we're gonna get caught
They were eyeballing my car
What
At the seven-eleven
Who
What are you talking about
They're on me
They're smoking me out
(shouts) Nobody's smoking anybody out
Shut up
Quiet
Liz is at the door of the restaurant
Keith
Is everything okay, honey
Fisher bolts over to Liz
Yeah baby
Everything's great
Well, can you come back inside
(not moving) Yeah
Sure
Now
Yeah
Look honey, 'll be right in
just
we're just taking care of some Groomsmen last minute business
Mr
Fisher approaches
Everything okay
Yeah, Dad
It's great
Well, 'm in the middle of my goddamn toast here
,
You guys just go back in
Dad, keep going with the toast, we'll be right in
Go on
Fisher ushers his father and Liz back inside, then turns, to quickly head back to the parking lot where things are escalating
(on Adam) You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam
We got a rehearsal situation here
don't give a damn
About anybody but yourself
You never have
And you're a little fucking reject
Eat my ass
' Hey
Michael kicks it again, harder
Adam shoves him
If you ever touch my minivan again, 'll make you sorry
Real sorry
You're a loser
You're the loser
big black hole sucking up everything you touch You're the loser
You think your shit's so fucking righteous You were there with us, boy
Right there
Shut up
Shut your fucking mouths
Boyd and Fisher separate the brothers
(freaking) didn't do anything
'll turn your pathetic ass in
Adam
Calm down
won't calm down
can't do this
We can't do this
It won't work
It will not work
It has worked
'm talking about  samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners,  scientists
They figure this shit out
They always figure it out
They won't figure it out
got children
've got a life
You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife
You fucking bastard
Adam attacks Michael, slashing, biting, mauling, the brother's go down hard, slugging it out on the ground
Liz is back at the restaurant door
Keith
Fisher bolts over to Liz
Everything's
Just some more preparations
Are they fighting
No baby
We'll all be right in
Fisher pushes her inside and charges back to the
Fisher helps break the fight
Adam and Michael try to contain their rage
This is going to stop right now
Right now
(seething) You will not screw this up
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck
Don't you fucking threaten me -- 'll fucking kill you
Go home
You go home
Boyd pulls Michael to his car
Why don't you just cool out
Go home and go to sleep
Boyd opens Michael's car door, puts him in
Just go home, chill the fuck out
Okay
Michael starts his car
Boyd shuts the car door
Just go home
, eyeballs Adam
Adam eyeballs him right back
Michael hits the gas and screeches away
All right
Let's all go back in
Adam
You're cool right
No
'm not Boyd
am not cool at all
Reluctantly, they start back in
hundred or so feet away, Michael's car comes to an abrupt stop
They all turn
Michael turns his car around, idles for a moment
' Michael in a trance, staring at the guys watching him
Mr
Fucking Minivan
He hits the gas
Wheels spin, rubber burns
The guys watch as Michael speeds full throttle, like a battering ram, right at Adam's beloved minivan
Adam jumps between the minivan and Michael's car
' Michael's expression turns to horror
He slams on the brakes, but it's too late
Michael's car crushes Adam like a sandwich meat between his car and the minivan
Metal, flesh, severed limbs, Adam explodes like a gnat
: , - Chaos
The room is filled with people from the Rehearsal Dinner
Black-eyed, nose broken,  sobs, surrounded by her kids and Liz
Boyd and Fisher talk to the
It was just a crazy freak accident
He thought the car was in reverse
He didn't realize
The  takes notes
sits in a corner by himself
Ghost white
Trembling
Was there some sort of an argument
No
Nothing like that
We heard there was some arguing going on
Some loud talk
No
No
We were just all outside just talking
What were you talking about
The wedding
We were talking bout how it was going to be one of the last times for us to all be together with Fisher not being married
lot of people seem to think there was some hostility out there
(getting righteous) Well  can't really comment on what "a lot of people" thought
can only tell you that we had a horrible accident here and were all feeling extremely traumatized and your questions are a bit poorly timed
We're in full on grieving mode right now thank you very much Officer
Randone
Easy Boyd
No easy Boyd
got a best friend in there in pieces
How about a little sensitivity
Boyd storms off, goes and sits with Michael
Fisher stays with the cop
That's all  wanted to know
appears in the doorway
His situation is critical
He's asking to speak to his wife
of the guys eyeing each other nervously as Lois slowly gets up and follows the Doctor into a treatment room
The guys move to the door, where they can see Lois, leaning over the hospital bed, talking to Adam
Adam hooked up to dozens of wires, etc
Lois leans over to kiss him
Adam appears to be whispering something to her
Watching Adam speak to Lois
Nervous
Lois has her ear to Adam's mouth
He is clearly speaking to her
Lois is sobbing when
'
rushes into the room
Adam is a v-tach -- Heart's not beating
The team injects medicine, defribulates
Lois watches in horror as her husband dies in front of her
Finally a  calls time of death
Lois collapses on the floor
The guys have witnessed Adam's death
Michael turns in horror
Boyd, Fisher and Moore stare
Liz rushes to Fisher, throws her arms around him, overcome with grief
' - Fisher, Boyd, Moore and Michael eat eggs
The need to know is clear
What did Adam tell Lois
That's the name of the game
What did Adam tell Lois
What does Lois know
Ball park sausages
You want some breakfast meat, Michael
Is that what you want
(clearly starting to crack) Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic
The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for "The Immaculate Reception," his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception
say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America
(inappropriately loud) Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company
By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime
Easy Michael
(on a roll) He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share
Before the clock runs out
are starting to pay notice
Shut up Michael
(screams) All eyes on Michael
Boyd is immediately up trying to get Michael out of the booth
Casually, sweetly
Okay
Time to fly
Fisher helps Boyd lift Michael, who is becoming more and more frenzied
ran down my brother in cold blood
Shame on me
Shame
Shame
Shame
,  and    stare, confused as the  Michael is carried to the door
(struggling) Time to pay the man
"For if we confess our sins he is faithful and just, to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
" Fisher and Boyd struggle with Michael
(tipping Waitress) Thank you
She watches them haul Michael outside
Michael thrashes wildly in the parking lot
"Kill one man and you are a murderer
Kill millions and you are a conqueror -- Kill all and you are a God
" Michael breaks free, starts running away
Boyd, Moore and Fisher give chase
Moore dives on Michael's back
Fisher helps Moore hold Michael down while Boyd gets the car
(calming down) "The memory of the just is blessed but the name of the wicked shall rot
" Boyd is there with the car
They load Michael into the back seat, climb in and disappear into the night
- Boyd drives, Fisher rides shotgun, Moore's in the back trying to contain Michael
You will get yourself together here mister
Are you hearing me
Michael, now catatonic, stares out the window
He's cracked up
He is not cracking up
Boyd
What have we done
What did you ask me
What
What is the question you asked me
said, what have we done
Yes, you did
Now that is the question
That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves
You tell me Fisher
What have we done
don't know
just want to get married
Say it again
What
What you just said
Say it again
just want to get married
Exactly
Exactly my point
What's your fucking point
'm not talking to you
What's your point
You want to know what you are doing here
You are love pumping
You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies
You are walking the walk
This is it Fisher, the real stuff
You love this woman
Love is second to nothing
love you
love Moore
love Michael
This car is full of love, and nothing -- absolutely nothing -- supersedes love, man
Nothing
We will do what it takes
Whatever it takes
Boyd takes Fisher's head in his hands and kisses him deeply on the mouth
Love does not lose
Fisher, speechless
: : '  - Jewish ceremony
hundred or so guests
conducts the service
Lois sits in shock flanked by her boys
Michael, Fisher, Boyd and Moore stand in positions of honor up front
They're all eyeing each other
Michael starts emitting deep, uncontrollable, highly inappropriate
Easy Michael
Michael can't control himself as his body starts to seize and tremble
Moore and Boys attempt to stabilize Michael who breaks away, charges over to Lois and buries his head in her lap sobbing deeply
Everyone is stunned but the Rabbi Continues
- Liz and Fisher
(hysterical) Cancel
Cancel
Are you out of your fucking mind
Nobody's saying cancel
'm talking about modifying
No way
Can we just talk this out
Talk what out
We are locked and loaded here
We are non-refundable
've got relatives on the airport right now
've got
The phone
Fisher freezes
Answer it
Fisher picks up the phone
Hello
' Lois on the phone, near hysteria
Keith
It's Lois
just found a note up in Adam's study
It's some kind of crazy confession about killing a stripper and cutting up bodies and
(explaining) burying them outside of Vegas, about Boyd being the ring leader
She wants to know what the hell is going on and 'm starting to freak out here
Boyd, Moore and Michael, looking particularly traumatized, are seated at a booth with Fisher
We're goosed
We're not goosed
What's goosed
What is her disposition
Regarding what
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile
Did she mention the police
No, but she's definitely pissed and hostile
And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right
Michael starts sobbing uncontrollably
We're goosed
Goosed by God
Michael get a grip
(to Fisher) What did you tell her
told her that  have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter
Did she believe you
have no idea
You can tell when people believe you
It's obvious
Well  don't have that skill and if had to guess  would say that in no way did she believe me
(screaming) Goosed
Stop it
Goosed
People are staring
Stop
Goosed
(to Moore) Give me the Valium
He just had two
Give me two more
Moore counts out two Valium, hands them to Boyd as michael continues to freak
(to Michael) Open sesame
Michael complies like a puppy
Jesus Boyd you're going to
him
Suck my ass
' Lois, busted nose, eyes black
never liked you Boyd
You're a snaky little fuck
Always have been
the guys, seated around a little breakfast table
Michael's in a Valium stupor
What are you talking about
Don't sweet lip me
don't understand where this personal attack is coming from
You're a liar
want to know what happened in Vegas
Nothing happened in Vegas
don't want to hear it from the liar
Stick a plug in it Boyd
Fisher
What happened in Vegas
(beat) Nothing happened in Vegas
(not buying it) Moore
(sheepish) Nothing happened
Michael starts back in with the power sobbing
All eyes are on him
Guilty, uncomfortable silence
Michael's coming unglued
Michael
Do you have something to tell me
Michael
Tell Lois that nothing
Shut up Boyd
Michael
All eyes on Michael
(quiet) Goosed
Fisher struggles to breathe
Boyd tenses up
What
Lois we were bad, we were very, very bad
He's upset about Adam
We're all upset
will call the police right now if don't start getting some answers
Lois please
She heads for the phone
Fuck you Boyd
The guys are freaking as she picks up the phone
Boyd looks at the kitchen knives
Fisher sees him, intervenes quickly
Okay
Lois
here's the deal
(beat) Adam was with a prostitute in Las Vegas
Lois freezes, puts down the phone
Boyd and Moore look stunned at Fisher -- good lie
What
'm sorry he was unfaithful to you
And it wasn't the first time
He had a thing about prostitutes
Fisher gives Boyd a look
Lois starts to choke up
(crushed) My Adam
Lois crumbles before their eyes
We're sorry
Lois starts sobbing
Michael joins in
Adam Jr
and Timmy appear in the door, in their pajamas, awakened by the noise
Seeing their mother in tears, they start to sob
The room is filled with anguished tears
Boyd give Lois a glass of water and a Valium
' Fisher and Moore load Michael into the car
Boyd leans into the back window
Adam Jr
and Timmy are in the backseat, still in their
's
Mommy just needs a little time out
Everything's gonna be okay
Okay
(the boys don't answer) Okay
Fisher starts to get in the car, Boyd pulls him aside, very wound up
After you drop the kids off, take Michael home
Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep
don't think that's such a good idea
Just do it
What are you going to do
Take care of business
(accusing) What does that mean
And what does that mean
(off no response) Are you insane
(whispers) You think  would hurt Lois
She's the mother of those kids
What is wrong with you
don't know
You got a nasty side to your thought process
: ' Fisher
'm sorry
Honey
it's just for tonight
Liz is in her robe, none too pleased
Adam Jr
and Timmy sit in the b
g
at the kitchen table eating cookies and milk
Lois is a mess and Michael's really upset
Everyone's upset
We're not canceling
know
won't even discuss it
No one's discussing it
'm just gonna run Michael home
'll be right back
need you to pick up the cake tomorrow
Don't we already have someone to do that for us
Yeah
You
Okay
Okay
Fisher kisses Liz and goes
Dark, smoky,
Michael, Fisher and Moore sit in a corner booth
(finger in his ear) Do you hear buzzing fish
Buzzing
Yeah
got some kind of buzzing
Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull
don't hear it
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem
Have another drink
'  - down hallway into bedroom where Lois sleeps peacefully
- Fisher and Michael
Moore, drinking, just listening
Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam
Out back we'd light 'em up
The three of us
We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light
Sparks
And dad would be all
"Get ready"
"watch for it"
"here it comes," here comes the "wahoo" The wahoo
The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter
and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect
Perfect
It would only last a second, but that second was it
It was it
That's what dad had us looking for
You get me
The wahoo moment
That's my point
You see Man
burning at his absolute
To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony
That's what 'm driving at
You get me
think so
've been looking for that flash and look and  look and  can't find it
And what if  already had it
You know
My moment
What if it's gone
And  never saw it
(finishes drink) You're getting married, man
That's a fucking beautiful thing
Just a beautiful thing
just can't stop breaking beautiful things
'  - Lois' bedroom
As Lois sleeps, Boyd softly enters the room
Moving in on the sleeping Lois, another couple of steps, he looms over her, reaches his hand to her throat when, suddenly, Lois' eyes snap open
Boyd is startled
Lois grabs mace from her night stand and sprays Boyd in the face
He , stumbles back
Lois leaps on him like a shark slamming a side of beef
They go down hard on the floor and start fighting like wild animals
You picked the wrong woman mother- fucker
As Lois sinks her teeth into Boyd's balls
You see for me it's over
Over baby
'm gonna turn myself in
After the wedding of course
After the wedding
Out of respect
don't think that's a good idea
said out of respect
Respect for you Fisher
For you and your wedding and your beautiful bride
There will be no more rain
You see where  am here
appreciate it
do, but
maybe you ought to just ease up on yourself a bit
No
No
No
This is my doing
You see 'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own
For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco
'm gonna turn myself in
am all that
'm gonna do it for sweet Lois
' Boyd and Lois are choking the living shit out of each other
Boyd pulls back, swings with a left, Lois ducks, she swings, a right cross to Boyds eye
He goes down
She jumps on him
Choking him like a mad dog
As Boyd struggles for air
Fisher checks his watch as Michael fumbles with his eighth shot of Yukon Jack
If  was to think
If  were to think
No  mean  have thinked it over
have
And without putting a lot of pressure on you  just
Well  just
What is it
(drunk-slow) Well if you do think about names
Michael's a pretty good one
It's done me all right
Michael's eyes bore into Fisher, like he knows something Fisher doesn't
Fisher's cell phone
(answers) Yeah
' Boyd, eye swelling, scratch marks, hair a crazy mess
(into the phone) Okay
Here's the deal and it's a good one
Lois is cool
It's a pacified situation
What does that mean
Michael stares at Fisher
'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety
Only deal is
you still got Michael there
Yeah
Good deal
Lois just wants to hear it from Michael
Hear what
That it was all an accident
She wants to here it from Michael's mouth
Now
Michael drunkenly nods his head as if can hear the conversation
That's right
Isn't it a little late
Hold on a sec
(turns) Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning
to see Lois, half hanging off the bed, strangled to death
Boyd won
(back into phone) She says now's the time
(quietly) got a peace treaty thing happening over here
let's get this over with
' Fisher's car pulls up
Boyd is waiting outside
He opens the back door
Michael is drunk in the back
Fisher and Moore are up front
Okay Michael, let's go
(helps him out) Upsy daisy big guy
(hammered) How about my Fatburger
Come on tough guy
Listen to me
(takes Michaels face in his hands) You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident
Okay cowboy
You got me
love you
He's too drunk
He's fine
Okay Mikey, let's go
(to Fisher and Moore) You guys stay here
Boyd leads Michael into the house
Fisher and Moore wait in silence
(beat) 'm thinking about maybe making a move
move
Greenpeace
Greenpeace
Maybe go up to the North Pole, the Arctic
Tag polar bears with dart guns
've always had a pretty good aim
"" resounds from within the house
Moore and Fisher lock eyes, frozen
Boyd comes jogging out the front door, hops in the back seat
Fisher and Moore turn, eyes wide
Michael was having an affair with Lois
That's what Michael and Adam were arguing about in the parking lot
Michael killed Adam in a jealous rage
Lois broke it off with Michael, he strangled her to death and then shot himself in the head
(beat) Happens all the time
Boyd touches the painful scratches on his face
That Lois fought like a fucking Comanche
Fisher and Moore in stunned horror
, mid-40's, attorney
don't see how this could have been kept from you
The facts are quite simple; last month Adam and Lois changed their will
They requested that you two, as a married couple, be the Custodians of Record for their estate including all properties, cash holdings, security holdings and
children
You are legal custodians of the Brenn Trust
Liz and Fisher, flanked by Adam Jr
and Timmy, eyes wide, they sit across from the attorney, totally bazooka'd
They stare in horror at Morris
My god
There's more
More
Adam and Lois were not terribly prudent in terms of providing for the possibility of the unforeseen
What are you talking about
'm talking about Life insurance
'm talking about money
Money
Yes money
Adam had a five hundred thousand dollar Term Life Insurance Policy
What does that mean
That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids
(amazed) No
Yes
Actually, no
Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam
and failed to make his last payment
so his Term Life lapsed
So it's value is null and void
(off Liz's horror) Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand
(relieved) Well, oh
And a house
Valued at 350 thousand
So where's that leave us
150 plus 350
we still get 500 thousand
(beat) No
Not even close
With property values down, the house is worth 100,000 less than 450 he paid for it
With three credit cards, the minivan payments, and other outstanding debts
Plus the Income and Estate Taxes assessed on his (punches his calculator) You'll get, oh
in the neighborhood of, ah
14,223 dollars
Adam Jr
suddenly slips off his chair, lands flat on his back, starts struggling to get up
Fisher tries to help Little Adam up
Get away from me
'm just trying to help
don't want your help
Stop kicking
Stop kicking
Fisher manages to get Adam Jr
back up in his chair
Liz looks rather horrified
(breaking the tension) So
When is the wedding
Tomorrow (at Fisher) We are getting married tomorrow
Fisher drives, Liz up front, Adam jr
and Timmy in the back
Everyone is shocked in silence
Fisher looks deathly ill, like he's about to vomit
He pulls the car over and gets out
' Fisher leans on the trunk, puking
Liz gets out to help him, he starts crying
Liz is gentle and loving
It's okay
It's okay baby
Cry for Mama
Cry for Mama
No it's not okay
It's not
The kids watch from the rear view window but can't hear
Cry for Boom Boom
It's okay
(sobbing) Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off
(ice) Don't even
Do you love me
What
Do you love me
What kind of stupid question is that
(breaking down) Oh God
We
Liz
We
We
Killed a woman
We
What are you talking about
(completely hysterical) Oh Liz
We
God
We, in Vegas
Michael crushed her skull
She was dead
There was nothing else to do
It was an accident
Who's dead
The prostitute
You fucked a prostitute
No Michael did
It was an accident
You killed a prostitute
Michael, by accident
Call the police
It's too late
My God
You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident
Where is she
She's in the desert
She's out in the desert
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert
Alone
She's not alone
She's
Boyd
Oh God
He's gone nuts
He killed Lois and Michael
it's all
Stop
You stop right here
don't want to know anymore
told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing
You were warned
But
No buts
told you your friends were Jackasses
But
No buts
've waited twenty-seven years, twenty-seven years  have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle
will not be derailed
will not be embarrassed
will not be denied
am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell or high fucking water
Liz marches back to the car, gets in and slams the door
Fisher just stares in shock
/
-   ' It's pouring rain outside
Shots of guests dashing from their cars to the church
Fisher's parents with Adam Jr
and Timmy, looking overwhelmed
Upstairs: Liz and her Bridesmaids help Liz get dressed
Everyone looks depressed
Fisher and Moore in tuxedos
Boyd enters, shuts the door
Fisher looks ill
Okay, we're about two minutes out
Moore, better take your position
Moore looks at Fisher
Chop chop
Moore goes
long tense  between Fisher and Boyd
This is a situation that defies judgement
We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most
'm getting really tired of your bullshit
My what
You've got a warped thought process
Your brain doesn't function properly
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation
(snaps) 'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things
Bad things
Those are bad fucking things
Okay fine
Fine
Fine what
Whatever you say Kojak
'm serious
'm serious
'm the serious one here
'm the one making the play
'm the Indian Runner
And  want my money
The organ is playing
The guests are seated
Liz and her father are waiting in the front hall
told Boyd two fucking minutes
- ' What money
Blood money
Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all
In no way have you mentioned that money
And  find that to be very very offensive
You're sick
(veins pulsing) And if you think you can fuck me, don't
Cause 'm fucking insulated Fisher
Protected
Backed up on floppy
Do you get me
want my fucking money
Not a prayer
'm a lifesaver
lighthouse
Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes
stay lit for you stay lit
don't go dark
never go dark
You need help
Fisher turns away
combusts
He leaps on Fisher with a wild cry
want that money
Boyd and fisher fight like animals; choking, pounding, mauling, a fight to the death
Fisher is losing, Boyd is choking the life out of him, killing him
Fisher is going down, eyes rolling back, he's dying, until
Boyd's head is caved in from behind
Liz wielding a big, heavy crucifix
Boyd slumps to the ground
Fisher gasps for air
Boyd stirs
Liz beats him repeatedly with the crucifix until he's dead as a door knob
Fisher is stunned
Liz tosses the cross
Miraculously, only one perfect droplet of blood has gotten on her wedding dress
She flicks it off with her finger
(composing herself) Here comes the bride
Liz gathers up her train and marches out
Fisher looks at Boyd, a bloody dead mess
Fisher joins Moore at the alter
smiles warmly at Fisher
Where's Boyd
(whispers) Downstairs in the closet
Before Moore can ask, the  begins playing the Liz starts down the aisle, escorted by her father, She smiles radiantly
Liz's father kisses her and gives her to Fisher
They stand before the Judge who starts talking
Fisher
His head pounding
He hears none of what the Judge says until
May we have the rings please
What
The rings
Fisher looks at Moore
Moore opens the closet
Boyd falls out
Everyone waits patiently
Fisher is sweating
He looks at Liz who stares straight ahead
Moore rolls Boyd over, checks every pocket, trying not to get blood on himself
Moore returns
Got 'em
He hands the rings to the Judge, at which time, he, she, Fisher and Liz all see blood on his white shirt cuff
The Judge looks at Moore
He pulls his jacket sleeve down
(continues) These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day
Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part
do
Liz slides the ring on Fisher's finger
Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part
do
Fisher slides the ring on Liz's finger
now pronounce you husband and wife
Fisher kisses Liz
They turn to face their guests who applaud
Liz cries tears of joy
- Liz drinks champagne and talks with her guests
- Fisher and Moore load Boyd's body in the trunk of Fisher's car
He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money
Said he was gonna get what was his
My God
He said he was the Brain Trust
Said he was smarter than all of us
He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror
Did he try to kiss you
All week long
Fisher slams the trunk closed
- Only a few guests remain
Fisher's parents watch the boys
The caterers are cleaning up
Fisher and Liz sit alone
He kept saying he was protected
What does that mean
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us
Like how
don't know
He could have told someone
He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried
The only proof is those bodies
So what do we do
Move the bodies
Move the bodies
(
) Excuse us
Fisher and Liz look up at a sweet  , who talk at the same time, oblivious to each other
We just wanted to say congratulations and wish you great happiness
Mazeltov just did
said Malzeltov
You never listen to me
We're your Uncle Henry's parents
Opal and Earl
Tell them from both of us
Malzeltov
Wish them luck
The secret to a good marriage is to listen
(cheerleader smile) Thank you
Thank you
We will
Bye bye
The Old Couple shuffles away
Fisher watches them go, he suddenly breaks down, crying
Liz
all  ever wanted, was for you to be happy
just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of
(sobs) just love you so much
So much
(beat; unmoved) You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them
In fact, put Moore in the ground too
What
If you don't tie up all the lose ends it'll never be over
(horrified) No
You put him down or don't bother coming back
But
Do you love me
Fisher
- Fisher's car blasts past a road sign reading, "Las Vegas, 358 miles
" ' Fisher drives, Moore's in the passenger seat
They're still in their tuxedos
Extreme silence
Fisher, almost in a trance
You alright
Yeah
'm thinking about Michael's Franco Harris fixation
You know how Michael was always harping "Immaculate Reception
" 've seen that play lot of times
and  have to say this
Franco was lucky
Flat out, right place, right time
That's it
He was where the ball bounced
You get me
guess
'm saying it's luck
All luck
You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant
Where does the ball bounce
My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money
He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot -- "Pup Corn
" Pup corn
That's right, "Pup Corn
" Doggie treats
Little snacks for dogs
He's figured it out
There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it
Spends all out money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up
After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt
He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school
We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt
"Here Shelmer," my dad cries
He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl
" This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything
She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room
Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn
" Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there
Not one dog ate Pup Corn
Not one
Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down
Chapter Eleven
My father never got over it
Never
hangs again
- Fisher and Moore search for the graves of Tina and Ralph with flashlights and shovels
think it was over here
They move into a new area and start poking around
Nothing
It was over by those rocks
Again they search, prodding into earth with their shovels
Nothing
Fisher stops digging, tired, he pauses, shines his light around until
There
Where
Fisher moves to a new spot
There
This rock is where  stood when  said the prayer
He starts digging in front of the rock
The earth is soft
Bingo
Moore and Fisher quickly start to dig, until, finally, Moore's shovel makes contact
Got it
And they dig some more
: in the hole, passing the suitcases up to Fisher
: loads the cases into the car
The suitcases are unloaded
Fisher and Moore dig a new grave
Moore's back is to Fisher as he digs
've been thinking about what you said that day
The prayer
About using this whole mess to bring out the good in me
Fisher is directly above Moore, holding the shovel, looking down at the back of Moore's head
Yeah
think there's a lot of truth in that
'm gonna pursue some options
want to join that Big Brother thing
(slowly raises the shovel over his head) That's a good one
want a black one
little black brother
That's a big problem it seems to me
Lack of racial integration
That's a big one
You think
Moore looks up to
, tears running down his face, the shovel high above his head, ready to bring it down hard onto Moore's skull
confused and then realization
between Fisher above, poised to strike, Moore below, still and vulnerable
Their eyes locked for several beats
Finally
What do you think
Slowly, Fisher lowers his shovel
think you'd make an excellent Big Brother
(back to work) That's what 'm thinking
: - The cases are in the hole with Boyd's body
As Fisher and Moore re-fill the grave with dirt we
: '  -  - Fisher drives, Moore rides shotgun, both mean are dirty, sweaty and tired
Well that ought to be about the end of that
Yup
Fisher, staring deep into the road, a faint smile creeps on to his face
: The distorted but definitely recognizable image of Franco Harris running for his life
(
) And it's Franco Harris running for
Franco makes it into the Raider end zone
(
) : Lost in his reverie, wakes up in a hair pin turn
The speedometer reads 80
They run out of road
The car skids on the shoulder, Fisher cranks the wheel, jumps the divider, into oncoming headlights
Fisher and Moore lit up bright
Fisher's car  head-on into another car Fisher and Moore are launched through the windshield in an of glass and steel, flesh and blood
: We hear the sounds of
: -  - Liz, on her hands and knees, scrubbing around the toilet of what is clearly a filthy kids bathroom; soiled jockey shorts, Tonka trucks, mess everywhere
we hear voices outside
Liz gets up off her knees, brushes a piece of hair from her sweaty face and peers out the bathroom window
Okay let's try it again
Adam Jr
and Timmy, in ill-fitted Cub Scout uniforms, recite the "Scout Laws
" scout is thrifty, saves for the future
scout is clean, he keeps his body
scout is brave
scout can face danger, even if he's afraid
Let's see the salutes
Timmy snaps out a fine salute
Adam balances on one crutch to salute but looses balance and falls flat on his face
He starts
Fisher, in a wheelchair, both legs amputated above the knee
He leans over, trying to help Adam Jr
up and his wheel chair tips over
Fisher falls on top of Adam Jr
who even louder, flailing arms and legs like a turtle on its back
Moore, in an electric wheel chair he operated with a mouthpiece
As he is paralyzed from the neck down, he's no help at all
Timmy suddenly snaps
(to Adam Jr
) Shut up
Shut the fuck up
It's okay, it's okay
Liz watches the pathetic chaos that is her life with the dull lifeless eyes of a concentration camp prisoner
(
) Timmy
Help your brother
Let him help you
Liz as her mouth slowly opens in an anguished - Adam Jr
gets back on his feet, with the begrudging help of Timmy
As Fisher struggles to hoist himself up, back in his wheelchair
Remember a scout is helpful
scout doesn't scream in the face of adversity
Suddenly,
from the bathroom, Liz
Fisher looks up at the window
(to the boys) Okay, let's skip to the Scout's Oath
& On my honor,  will do my best
The boys recite the "Scout's Oath" as Liz's deep, heaving, wailing  grow in intensity
& to do my duty to God and my country
To obey the Scout Law, to help other people at all times
Fisher, Moore and the kids
& To keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight
, past Liz at the window, out of the yard, over the house,  to reveal the surrounding track-like homes, housing track-like families, with track-like nightmares as Liz's plaintiff wails echo the communal despair of the human village
