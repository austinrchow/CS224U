Fred happily discards his hard hat, leaps out of the canvas-roofed cab on the dino's back, slides down the tail and bounces right into the seat of his stone and timber car
He gets up to a running start with the only motor (his feet), slows to allow a "time clock" dinosaur to punch his stone timecard, and then he's trotting back up to speed and out of the gate

He takes a giant sea shell "speaker" off of its wooden stand and hooks it to his car door
He leans over, puts his arm around Wilma

) Suddenly a garbage truck appears out of nowhere and runs over the Xenosaurus

The Xenosaurus grabs its sack and some silverware spills out
Then it runs off into the bushes and out of sight

The garbage truck guys drop their feet down through the floorboard and trot over the rise, coast down to the street below
The driver yanks a wooden brake and the truck stops, and the rear guys hop off
One of them waves to -- 9                                                       9 who returns the wave, then takes a four-pack of stone bottles out of his milk truck, heads towards a doorway
As the milkman drops off the milk, he passes a big with trash cans on its back
The Tortoise nods familiarly to the milkman, then it waddles down the curb,
The garbage men take the cans off the Tortoise's back, dump them into the truck

The garbage men   dump the cans into its maw
it happily swallows the   works, licks its lips,

As it begins to spin around, it squirts water out of its snout

The monkey holds up cue cards which the octopus reads, and then waves nautical semaphore flags

the face of Fred, his eyes at half-mast, his face covered in fashionable "Bedrock Vice" stubble

How about a great big good morning kiss for your Freddy-weddy

Dino begins    to roll Fred across the room like a seal playing with   a ball
Dino, that's enough -- here, look, Daddy has a nice dino bone for you, just please stop it -- Fred has now backed up to a dresser, where he grabs a brightly-colored box labeled "

Yes, the fiercesome intruder was sighted in the Bedrock Hills for the third time this month
Outlying shops and residencies report extensive looting and property destruction
Fred, stop playing with Dino and sit down
Your breakfast's getting cold
Saying this, Wilma puts   a huge egg at Fred's place
Meanwhile, Fred manages   to get to his feet, holds out one arm to keep Dino at   bay
Fred does a big "take," looking out the window   -- () 7

Pause
Dino gives him a big look as if to say, "Oh, yeah

Fred cackles, slams it shut, then sits down at the table

Of course not, baby
That's right, sweetheart
The only thing that's gonna eat you up is -- me
And he grabs her and bites her and tickles her
(giggling, calming) 'm still a little scared
Pebbles, don't worry
These stories are very exaggerated
Like, you know, the boogyman
There's no such thing as a huge, inhuman reptile that attacks without warning -- Dino reappears, bounding through the window and knocking Fred onto the floor
Once again Dino is happily licking and loving and cuddling his callously unresponsive owner
Fred struggles to avoid the slurping tongue, pulls himself up to the window sill, looks out
-- Oh, look, everybody, the mailman is here -- "---
"  buys it again, runs to the door, lets himself out
This time Fred puts a chair against the door
Meanwhile, Wilma turns at the sound of the We see that the "claws" we saw earlier were the actual claws of a  in a little fireproof suit who is tucked inside the toaster

Fred slaps jelly on the toast, takes a big bite, and then something outside the window catches his eye

In the bike's basket is a stack of dried, rock-hard clay tablets
21                                                      21 Fred leans out the window, waving his hands
Arnold
Arnold
Don't aim at the house -- please, not at the house -- Fred ducks back just as the stone newspaper slams into the window frame,  a , taking out a chunk of wall, and continuing diagonally through the kitchen and out another window
Fred follows this action in time to see -- 22     -                           22 The rock paper drops like a foul shot, rips through the canvas roof of Fred's car, and then bangs a huge dent in the hood
23                                                      23 Fred sighs, turns back to his breakfast
Lucky it wasn't the Sunday paper
(slight smile) Yeah
What else can go wrong
He slices through the big egg with his knife -- releasing a baby  which  and flaps, knocking Fred over as it takes off through the window

(wiping their mouths) Come on, kids
Time for nursery school
'Bye-bye, Daddy
'Bye, little sweetheart
(as Wilma clears her throat) 'Bye, big sweetheart
Fred kisses them both and they drive off
Fred sighs, tries to stretch the canvas roof edges close enough to stitch
Nearby, Dino struggles to drag the stone news- paper inside the house
The twin headlines are, of course,    and Suddenly a pink flamingo appears over the hedge
As its mouth opens and closes, it appears to be talking, but the voice is that of -- Nice morning, huh, Fred
What's nice about it
Heh, hey
That Arnold's got a real arm on him, don't he
Now we see that Barney is holding the flamingo's stiff legs which he scissors, making the bird's beak trim the hedge
This is the third ragtop this year say, shouldn't you be at work
Ah, well, that appliance store and me, we kinda had a little adjustment -- You got fired, didn't ya

got dreams, Fred
Ideas -- Yeah,  know,  know, those crazy inventions of yours
Be honest with me, Barn
tell me one thing you invented that really caught on
invented fire
(pause) You invented fire
told you that, Fred
But the coal conglomerate ripped me off
The case is still in court, but meanwhile  got lotsa other ideas -- Yeah, but did any one of them ever put bread on the table
How long are you and Betty gonna live on those penny-ante royalties you get
Fred pulls his car hood off of its wooden hinges, examines it with dismay
If you ask me, pal, you're just blowing smoke up your own volcano
Maybe, Fred
But first
He uses the flamingo's jaws to snatch the car hood from Fred's surprised grasp
Let me try some of that smoke on your car

' / -                          25 We can still see Fred's car in the neighboring driveway
(We can also see Dino, who drags the newspaper on a bit more, then collapses from exhaustion)
Barney's garage is cluttered with all kinds of odds and ends, plus various inventions and scale models in different stages of completion
(Interestingly, a number of these anticipate Leonardo da Vinci's work)
Many of the models are made of a strange celadon green material
Fred watches, skeptical, as Barney presses the car hood into some soft clay between two big blocks of stone
(as he works) -- See, the first step, we make a mold of the old car hood, smooth out the dent in the clay -- He tosses the original car hood aside with a crash
Then, moving rapidly, he starts heaving a variety of ingredients into the reverse imprint of the car hood
-- Add some lava granules
some woca leaves
juice from two coo-coo berries
(impressed) Two coo-coo berries
You made of money, Barney
Anything for a pal, Fred -- a lump of coal
bamboo sawdust
eucalyptus sap
a touch of the La Brea tarbrush -- and -- voila
Barney dips a finger in this mess, "tastes" it; satisfied, he yanks on a hanging rope and a giant rock weight slams down on the whole mess, making Fred jump out of his skin
26                                                       26 Fred is caked with dust
He coughs and spits
Barney, why don't you try inventing a brain for yourself
Look at what you did to -- () 13

As Fred examines it, impressed despite himself, we

Somehow both of the kids' faces are messy again
Working together with beautiful precision, they are carefully dismantling the rear armrests and door handles
(in mid-speech, driving) Oh, it's not that 'm complaining, Wilma
mean, Barney's sweet, but
well, he's just not cut out to punch a clock
And he's such a dreamer, you think he ever once picked up a hammer and chisel and tried to balance a checkbook
They pull up in front of a pleasant-looking simple little nursery school
, a pleasant-looking 65, sees them from the schoolyard, waves while Wilma and Betty un- load the kids
No, Barney just keeps looking for that coo-coo berry pie in the sky, and  don't want to pop his balloon by talking about the price of mastodon ribs
She wipes off Bam-Bam's mouth with a handkerchief
Wilma does the same with Pebbles and then they kiss the kids, who immediately run into the schoolyard
(approaching) Mrs
Rubble, Mrs
Flintstone, wanted to thank you personally
You're welcome, Mrs
Granite
But we wipe their mouths every day
No, no,  mean for all your wonderful support the past few years
It's parents like you that make me think twice about retiring

Wilma and Betty laugh

Barney grins, gestures towards the front of the car
Not bad, eh
After it cures for an hour or so, it's solid as a rock
Okay, you fixed a dented hood

'm a big man there, Barney -- You're a big man anywhere, Fred -- 'm serious, pal
Me and Mr
Slate are just like this -- He takes his hand off the wheel to hold up two fingers
ends up swerving instead
-- just like that
know,  know -- you're not a clock-punching guy -- but face it, Barney -- it's time to grow up and put your nose to the grindstone, batten down the hatches and join the ratasaurus race with the rest of us
(meaningfully) It's time to retire those dreams
Barney looks glum, doesn't say anything
Suddenly Fred pulls over, stops the car
Barney

Hey
Lava Lane
Remember the old days, Barn
We used to race our go-carts here to impress the girls
(wistful) Yeah, those were the days

Fred gets a malicious grin on his face

thought you said it was time to retire those old dreams
Hey
Since when do  have to be consistent
The two pals laugh, and then    with a whoop they begin pedalling like mad
They go     over the top, gravity takes over and they are flying past    that billboard with all the Rotary Club welcomes on it
But now we see a different sort of welcome, as a       out from behind it

Out pops a little bird in a police helmet
It has a stopwatch (actually, stop-sundial) around its neck
Feldspar points -- the bird salutes -- takes off
31                                                     31 (spotting the cops) Oh-oh
Fred, slow down --
Suddenly both Fred and Barney see the   flying alongside them
It checks its stopwatch, writes a note to itself
Fred is so preoccupied he doesn't notice as -- 32                                                      32 cuts in front of Fred
Fred  on the "," sits helplessly as Feldspar gets out, walks over, grinning
Well, Flintstone, looks like today's the day
Sergeant Feldspar,
wasn't speeding

Fred reaches down to the floorboard as he speaks

Gravel
Get me the radar reading and 'll show you how we deal with scofflaws
Gravel nods, steps towards the bird
The bird checks its stopwatch
and then it notices the flying lizard which is hovering nearby, licking its lips
Whoa
Wings, do your stuff --
The Radar Bird flies away at a hundred miles an hour, leaving a cloud of dust and the stopwatch behind
Feldspar catches the watch, startled
Well, Sergeant, if you don't have a radar reading,  guess we'll -- (quickly) -- justbeonourway --
new cloud of dust appears as Fred  away

Young man, if you're through flirting, 'd like some service

Of course, Mrs
Slate
Just take a number
Wilma senses the tension, quickly steps forward to break it with a smile
Ah, hello, Mrs
Slate
Morris reacts with relief
Mrs
Slate reacts with a blank look
(prompting) We met at the quarry picnic
Oh, of course
Mrs
Flintstein
She turns her back to Wilma, forces her way towards the counter again
Wilma burns

38   :                                                     38 Ladies, the meat's not getting any fresher
Mrs
, what'll it be
Oh, 'd like some ground mammoth patties and uh
some dodo drumsticks
Gino
We got any dodo bird
turns, looks at his end of the counter
There's one left -- and it's the last one
Good
(handing him the note) Give it to Mrs
Rubble along with this
Gino nods, smiling
He picks up a crate, begins to load it with giant fryer parts and several manhole-sized meat patties
(turning to Betty) How about you, Mrs
just need a few things for Fred
'Fred
'
(calling into the back) David
Herman
Get Rob and BoBo and tell 'em to bring the big dolly
(
) Flintstone again, huh
You got it
Now then
Mrs
Slate
(pointing at the limo outside the shop) You're in a no parking zone there

38   :    (2)                                               38 Well, if  get some service, 'll be out of it, won't
Mrs
Slate steps to the counter
Meanwhile, the staff begin using a refrigerator dolly to bring out giant ribs, steaks and sausages which they pile up in front of Wilma
want a nice fresh, juicy chickensaurus, Morris
And not one you've had laying around on the shelf
mean fresh
Mrs
Slate, we're kind of busy now -- don't care if you're busy
What care about is my adorable little grand nephew
He's staying with me for the summer and  intend to make his favorite dish
Southern fried chickensaurus
Now  want a fresh chickensaurus and  want it now
Boys, you heard her
she said fresh
39                                                           39 with a sigh, they buckle on elbow and knee protectors, go to a side door, open it
Inside is another barred door
They open it, go inside
Immediately we hear loud  and
,

They try       and restrain it with ropes but it's enraged and flops      around the store
(oblivious of the trouble) Morris, while you're at it, 'd like it plucked -- () 21
40   :                                                   40 Suddenly the chickensaurus snaps the ropes, flaps its wings and leaps through the front window -- 41
-                                       41 The huge bird lands with a crunch atop Mrs
Slate's car, which is practically squashed flat
Then it disappears around the corner
(We hear   and as it goes
) 42                                                     42 My car --
Wilma and Betty try and hide their laughter
: 43
-                                 43 Clouds of dust rise from behind the fence
We see the heads of the heavy equipment dinos rising and falling
two-story office building is at one end of the site with a big "Slate Construction Inc
" sign on the roof
as Fred's car turns into the lot, Barney seated beside Fred
The new green hood gleams in the morning light
44    - '                                           44 Fred digs his feet into the ground, slams to a halt
He gets out, surveys the activity
Immediately, the various workers shout   greetings
Fred acknowledges these, beaming in the respect he gets here
He lovingly dusts off his construction helmet, puts it on, knocks an offending speck from his parking sign (
Flintstone - Shop Steward)
He leads Barney towards the quarry area
Barney, you won't regret this -- hiya, Al -- fixing dents in cars is one thing, a career's another
Here, you're getting in on the ground floor of the first footstep of a new leaf -- hi, Wally, how's the old backhand
And with a guy like me ta show you the ropes, you can skip all the red tape, all the malarky, all the dino doo -- 22
45                                                          45 Fred stands near the weight station booth, where a plump in a beehive hairdo sits inside a trailer
(New York accent) Hi, Mr
Flintstone
Hiya, Shirley
This is my very special neighbor and pal Barney Rubble
He needs an application form, okay
Anything for you, Mr
Flintstone
She slams down two clay tablets and a stylus
Here you go
(smiling) Thanks again for the football tickets
My boyfriend and  both liked them
My pleasure, Shirl
Anytime
Okay
But do you think next time we could go to the same game
(confidently) No problem
Fred smiles at her, hands the forms to Barney
Fres steps towards the quarry, admires the activity, hands on hips, master of all he surveys
He waves to more friends
Well, Barn, what did  tell you
When you're in with Flintstone, you're in like Flint
Gee, Fred
knew you were a big shot
just didn't know how big
Fred beams at that, and then follows Barney's gaze to the read-out on the truck scale
Fred is standing on it and it's pushing 250
With a scowl, Fred grabs Barney's sleeve and they go into the quarry
As they move, the and    the window of the Slate Construction Office
: 23
46
-                           46 The room here is dominated by a tabletop architectural model of a large scale construction project
There's acres of little development houses, then some tall office buildings, a mall, you name it: There's even little foot- powered model cars in the model parking spaces
Near this we see
, a giant in the Bedrock con- struction business (but not in height)
Slate drinks coffee from a "Boss" mug, listens with growing impatience to
Several of Slate's lackeys listen, their heads nodding up or down in sympathy with Slate's mer- curial moods
Uncle, if you'll look at this unit cost projection
it intersects here with -- -- how'd you like my fist to intersect with your nose
've told you a hundred times, don't call me uncle in the office
Now,  didn't arrange your scholarship to Harvrock University so you could waste my time
So stop beating around the bushasaurus and get to the bottom slime
You'll be bankrupt in six months
Slate does a Danny Thomas spit take all over the model
47
-                                   47 Fred and Barney cross the busy lot, sidestepping workers and animals
Fred does a lot of backslapping, waving
Barney's filling out the forms on the move
Behind them, we see the wide access ramp which spirals around the quarry's sides
(to himself) Social Security number
dependents
'how learned of job' newspaper ad, carrier pigeon
(writing) Personal reference
Hearing a loud , Fred looks up and sees -- 48   '  -                         48 burly and rough looking guy named , he grins in- side his dino-topping cupola, winds his winch handles and then propels his wrecking ball towards the
24
49     -                                           49 -- where the huge stone   into some walnuts balanced on a boulder
50                                                           50 Piltdown's compact buddy  cackles, sweeps  up the walnuts
Munching them, he balances a new one   in place
(It should be noted here that the relationship  and physi- cal appearances of Piltdown and Pyrite mirrors  that of our heroes
they're sort of an anti-Fred and  Barney
) Way ta go, Pilty baby
Five bucks says you can't hit one on the fly
(calling up) Yer on, Pyrite -- Pyrite tosses a walnut, which bounces on the ledge
The wrecking   into the stone wall
51                                                           51 Workers near Fred duck as dust and debris fall down
People grab for their construction helmets
Not again
Fred hustles up a ladder to a ramp which leads him up to the level of Piltdown's cab
Barney hurries to follow
All right, Piltdown, that's enough
You're endangering your fellow workers
Yeah
Sez who
Says me, Fred Flintstone -- shop steward of Amalgamated Neolithic Workers 101
Yeah
Well,
one-oh-one gives us workers a snack break
So
(a nasty grin) 'm breakin' some snacks
He swings the wrecking ball again
25
52                                                        52 This time he's overdone it:   The wrecking ball flies past the walnuts -- Pyrite ducks  for cover -- and then the wrecking ball whips over and  around the handrail which runs along here, twisting as  tightly as Indiana Jones' whip
The handrail wobbles   dangerously in its foundation -- 53   '                                              53 , backs up -- the crane  on its back begin to  and  with the strain -- 54                                                          54 Workers scatter, fearful of the imminent collapse
Fred runs to grab the dino's reins
Whoa, whoa, big fella -- He calms the beast by giving it a carrot
As it munches, Fred quickly ties the reins to a post
(calling up to the cab) You're on report, Piltdown
If it's up to me you'll be pushing a wheelbarrow
(leaping down) You've been asking for this, Flintstone
'm gonna kick your fat butt -- Fat butt
Hold me back, Barney -- (sotto, very sincere) -- Barney, hold me back -- Quickly the men form a circle around Piltdown and Fred
Barney looks up and sees -- 55       '                                 55 It is shuddering and threatening to come crashing down
56                                                    56 Hey, maybe you guys oughta fix that first
Why should we
() 26
56   :                                                  56 It looks dangerous
Besides, you can kick Fred's fat butt anytime
Yeah
That's right
(realizing, a glare at Barney) mean -- this ain't over, Piltdown
(turning, shouting) Come on, guys
Let's clean up the mess
With much grumbling, ropes and grappling hooks are gathered and the crew hops to it
57
'  -                               57 Slate stands in a blubbering fury as Lava mops coffee up from the model and Slate's face
Bankrupt
Are you crazy
Lava holds up a clay tablet covered with figures
It's all here in hack and slice
When you committed to this housing development the price of dino kibble was a few clams per ton
Since then, it's gone up a hundredfold
(indicating the model) You can't build a project like this without the heavy equipment dinos, and we can't afford to feed those dinos
Slate glowers, paces around the model
'm two months behind schedule, my option's running out on the land and Donald Trumprock is just waiting to jump in and steal the whole deal meanwhile that damn union's on my back, hell, they'll probably want an eighty hour week or something
(frustrated) There's got to be an answer
outside the window attracts everyone's attention
() 27
57   :                                                      57 What's that
(worried) Sounds like a worker's comp claim if  ever heard one
All rush to the window
They look out and see -- 58     -                                                58 Supervised by   Fred, all    the workers are straining on the ropes to haul   the rear    legs of the crane back into their sockets on the   back of    the big dino
Only the last critical rope   is still    dangling
Barney
Grab that line
Hurry
Barney scrambles up Fred's back, shoving a foot in Fred's face, but finally snatching the rope
He pulls on it
Fred throws his own weight into the effort
59                                                           59 into place on the dino's back -- the workers cheer -- 60                                                    60 alas, with its cable now twisted shorter, it's become an immovable object, and as the shortened  , the wrecking ball begins to roll down the quarry wall
61                                                           61 Men and   and dive out of the way as the rolls downwards,  everything in its path
62
'                                        62 The executives watch concerned as -- 63                                                    63 tumbles down, down, knocking scaffolding and ladders aside, reaches the end of a ramp, and drops through the air right onto -- 64      '                                           64 -- where, astonishingly, the  sinks in resiliently like a trampoline and then with a loud "" the wrecking ball flies straight back up into the air, followed a beat behind by the unhinged hood itself
Both hurtle  the  -- 28

With a howl, they all dive aside -- 66
'  -  -                              66 The wrecking  flies through the window,  onto Slate's desk, crushing everything in its path and then sails on  right into -- 67                                              67 -- where all of the lined up     with a sound like falling pins
68                                                      68 The workers pick themselves up and now their eyes follow the path taken by the long-gone wrecking ball
Oh boy
Goodbye pension fund -- They rush for the office building
69
'  -                                      69 Dust is still settling
The staff rises from the mess, coughing
Lava rummages in the debris, finds a stiff body
Uncle, Uncle, speak to me -- But it's only a statue of a golfer from one of Slate's trophies
(sitting up) 'm over here, you moron -- and don't call me 'Uncle'
Slate's eyes fall on Fred's car hood, swinging from a bookshelf
He reaches for it -- pulls it -- it stays put, and only releases a new deluge of rubble and plaster which reburies him
At the same time, the door slams open and Fred, Barney and the other workers tumble inside
70     -                                             70 As they take in the destruction
Barney notices the wrecking ball amidst the model buildings
As we watch, the last remaining little

You even got the spare -- Barney, shut up -- (turning) Mr
Slate -- Mr
Slate -- are you all right
Slate staggers to his feet, seething with fury
He finally yanks the car hood free
It bounces and in his hands like a hand saw
(eying the men) For five years Slate Construction has had the finest safety record in Bedrock
(pacing, angry) Our workers are trained in first aid, our equipment is first rate and our dinos are worm free
And then something like this happens want to know how
cacophony of voices starts to answer
Shut up
(in the sudden silence) want one person to answer me: (waving the car hood) Who's responsible for this
71                                                           71 nudges the wrecking ball off the edge of the table
It falls on Fred's foot
Fred starts to scream and Piltdown shoves a pencil holder into his mouth
(quickly) It was Flintstone, Mr
Slate
That's right, Mr
Slate, it was Flintstone
That's a lie, Mr
Slate
Who are you

71   :                                                        71 (pointing to his forms) Rubble
White male personal reference -- (pushing Barney aside) Flintstone,  have just one thing to say to you -- Fred cringes
Piltdown and Pyrite smirk
(pumping his hand) Congratulations
Huh
What
This stuff you had on your car is the most incredible building material 've seen in thirty years in the construction business
(testing it) It's strong -- (twirling it) -- Light -- (bending it) -- Resilient -- It rebounds, "" him on the chin
He recovers, shakes it off
Where on earth did you get it
Oh, it's ah, just something whipped up in the old garage workshop -- (quickly) -- with a little help from my buddy Barney, right, Barn
Well, actually, Fred, it was the other way ar-- Fred hisses between his teeth, repeats the "Slate and me are just like this" gesture he made earlier, points at Slate

71   :    (2)                                              71 (reluctant) Sure, Fred, right, right
Slate nods, distracted, his eyes and hands running over the smooth lines of the car hood
The rest of you men go back to work
want to talk to Flintstone and the personal reference alone
Come on, move, move
They go out, Piltdown looking furious
(a man in love) Light  as a Pterodactyl feather
why, a  child could handle this
Lava,  we could cut construction costs  in half
in quarters
in uh
whatchacallit -- (patiently) Eighths -- Eighths, right
Flintstone, what do you call this stuff
Well, Mr
Slate,  call it -- (hesitating, sotto) -- Barney, what do  call it
(sotto) Fibrerock, Fred
--  call it Fibrerock Fred --
(realizing) mean, ah, 'Fibrerock'
(rolling it over his tongue) 'Fibrerock'
'Fibrerock'
(playing with it) 'Fib-bre-rock' -- Slate's staff make disparaging noises

' (instantly reversing themselves) Love it
great
has a nice ring
says it all, you know
(Etc
) Slate takes the piece of material, leans it on the table so it catches the light
Despite himself, Lava comes over, examines the car hood
can't help but marvel at it as well
Meanwhile, Slate puts his arms around Fred and Barney
(to Lava) You see this, Lava
All those courses of yours at Harvrock University, and who saves my bacon
Two simple-minded run-of-the-mill nobodies
Gee, thanks, Mr
Slate
Lava glowers
Slate pulls Fred and Barney close with genuine excitement
Boys, this is a small step for Slate Construction
a giant step for all mankind
He points to the translucent material it
We see Fred, Barney and Slate's reflections in it
(dramatically) The Stone Age is over
Let the Fibre Age begin

Fred puffs on a cigar
Barney flips the pile of legal sized tablets in his lap
In the back seat are some boxes and bundles
Gee, Fred,  don't believe it
Eight hours ago  didn't have a job and now look --  got 1/2 of one percent of the after-taxes after-expenses net breakage profits on Fibrerock
Just be thankful  was there to go over the fine print
(full of himself) It's like  told you this morning -- There's something noble about a man digging in with his hands and doing an honest day's work
Once you file those dreams under 'old business' and put your nose to the plow, well, the world is your oyster
And was  right
No, Fred, you weren't
didn't nose any grindstones and you didn't shoulder a wheel
We just hung out together and everything that happened was a total accident
(after a moment) Details, Barney, details
(smiling) just can't wait to see the girls' faces when we tell 'em the news

Unless they were forced to go bowling again
Remember that time a burglar pointed a gun at them and said, 'go bowling right now'
Betty, sometimes you're a little too gullible -- Don't tell me
still can't believe what  did today
No kidding

And get this
it's non-refundable -- know,  know
just couldn't stand that woman's attitude
But we had to find a new school anyway, and there we were

And
And
if a friend can't help you do something stupid, who can

Then reality intrudes again
What do we tell the boys
What's wrong with the truth

(pause) Maybe we could rephrase it
Suddenly the door bursts open
Fred and Barney run in with candy and flowers
Surprise
Pause
Flowers
Rock candy
That's nice, but
why
Why
Oh, me and Barn, we suddenly realized that we had a little spare change
(sotto) Not anymore you don't
(presenting flowers) Betty, these are for you
For sticking beside me during the tough times, and well
for making a little guy feel like he was ten feet tall
Aw, Barney
don't deserve these
did something really stupid today
Hey
Fred does something stupid every day and  still love him
Fred laughs good naturedly, grabs Barney in a headlock
Noogy, noogy, ha, ha --

In reply, Fred whips a bottle of champagne into view
Ready when you are
(noticing the label) Hey, '1'
a good year
This confuses the girls even more
Fred, there's no easy way to say this so -- She closes her eyes, swings the enrollment forms over on the table so that Fred and Barney can read them
Fred and Barney look at them, look at each other
and yawn

Boys
did you see
the dollar signs there at the bottom
The non-refundable dollar signs
Plenty more where that came from
We see your dollar signs, ladies

The girls squeal
You bet they're real, sweetheart
They're as real as
as
well, as real as -- (embracing the group) -- the best darn friends and neighbors in the whole world
Barney squeezes back
Yeah
And nothing's ever gonna change that
right, Fred
(emotionally) Right, pal o'mine
As they laugh and the girls slowly absorb the truth, we -- : 77

We hear the sound of a
(
) Attention, fellow Water Buffaloes

-                               78 The members are milling about the main room, schmoozing, drinking, kibitzing
All wear the furry and horned ceremonial Fez of the Buffalo
One wall of the lodge displays a big version of the lodge coat of arms (with the motto "Ackus Ackus Adackus" below); a trophy case holds a mind boggling display of various bowling trophies, balls and pins
At the lectern, the (a mustachioed, inspirational type) bangs again for order
Brothers, your attention

He clears his throat, raises his chin, and gives a strange mournful bellow

78   :                                                  78 ("ritual" type tone) The herd is now called to the prairie
(holding fingers above ears) Antlers
up
The entire Lodge dutifully imitates this gesture
Ack-ack-a-dack
(banging gavel) This meeting of the Water Buffaloes is now in session
Sergeant-at-Arms, have we got any old business
Barney stands, acknowledges his friends and Lodge brothers
Indeed we do, Brother Herdmaster
Tonight we are to hear speeches from prospective candidates for Lodge offices, such as good old Fred and some other guys
79                                                       79 Seated across the room with Pyrite and other cronies, he immediately leaps to his feet, paws the ground, and gives an eerie moan even stranger than the Herdmaster's earlier call to order
80                                                    80 After the   away: Brother Piltdown: You have given the Cry of the Gelded Buffalo at the Poisoned Water Hole
Do you wish to file an objection
You bet  do
How come Flintstone is 'good old Fred' and me and the other candidates are just 'some other guys'
Yeah, how come
() 41
80   :                                                  80 (rising) My apologies, Brother Piltdown
Allow me to rephrase
Tonight we will hear speeches from a whole bunch of good old guys
(pause) plus the one and only Fred Flintstone
Cheers go up, which drown out Piltdown's renewed cry of the poisoned water hole
Fred moves towards the podium as the noise dies down
81                                                       81 Barney moves to the wall, where he pulls a rolled up tapestry from a hiding place behind a plant
He tacks it to the wall, yanks a string
It unrolls
It's a big "   " poster
Barney turns, gives Fred a "thumbs up," and as he does, Barney's hand brushes against a folded parchment in his pocket
Barney pushes his way through the seats, catches up to Fred and hands him the document
Fred takes it, continues up to the podium
There, the Herdmaster hands Fred the ceremonial hoof and antler, crossed over each other like a Pharaoh's badges of office
Fred does a Papal-like wave with these, sets them down, and unrolls the crib notes Barney gave him
(reading, at first wooden, then confident) Brother Buffaloes, honored Herdmaster, Junior Bucks and Apprentice Antlers, a great good evening to you all
Ahem
As you know, our organization has survived difficult times that have seen the extinction of such other lodges as the Order of Whooping Cranes and Brotherhood of Giant Sloths
But we here have come through the croo the crux
(hissing) -- crucible -- () 42

Now, the future holds many promises and many problems
As your next Herdmaster,  would bring to you the same determination, courage and -- if  may say so -- bold thinking that  have brought to the workplace
Thank you, and ack ack a-dack
Applause follows Fred's return to the floor
82                                               82 The only ones in their row not clapping, they scowl as Fred passes them
: 83
-   -                          83 as Barney propels   a bowling ball (stone, of course) rumbling down the alley,   sending pins flying
The Buffaloes cheer Barney's   strike
We notice that most (if not all) of these Lodge   members also work at the quarry
84                                             84 It descends
It consists of a bent snout creature which "cranks" down   a shelf with several monkeys on it
The monkeys grab   the pins with their tails, straighten them up
Then the    shelf cranks back up
85                                                 85 Now it's Fred's turn
He trots up to the line, bowls
another strike
More cheers,   complaints, etc
The scorekeeper picks up hammer and chisel and fills out the last frame
Congratulations, Fred
Hey, when you're hot you're hot
boys, lemme buy a round of drinks for everyone
Thanks, Fred, but here at the lodge drinks are free

85   :                                                   85 But the principle is the same, Barn
Don't forget that
Fred leads the group over to the bar
Piltdown and Pyrite come along with a shrug
why not, for a brew
Fred reaches -- 86                                                 86 where he pulls out a hook-beaked little  -- 87                                                     87 Fred uses this creature to open several beers

Fred tosses the "Opener" aside -- 88                                                 88 The critter bounces into the shelf, slides
when it re- covers, it realizes that its overbite has been straightened out by the impact
Very happy, it grabs a hat and coat, exits
89                                                     89 (raising drink) Well, here's to

(an obvious prompt) Anybody else got a toast
'Here's to the Water Buffalo and their next Herdmaster
Fred'
Aw, gee, Barn
you shouldn't say that
(winking) at least not till after next week's election
Fred, what was all that stuff in your speech about the workplace
thought the only decision you made there was how many lunches to eat -- Laughter
Fred accepts it good-naturedly, reaches into his pocket
Well, Harry, it just so happens that old Fred is moving up in the world
Boys, you're looking at Mr
Slate's new partner
You and Slate
Who are you kidding, Flintstone
The only partner you got is hanging over your belt
Pyrite laughs, a bit too much
Prepare to eat those words, Piltdown

Whoa, gonna switch from a hard hat to a top hat, Freddy boy
(examining the card) Ah, it's probably a phony
Saying this, he bites down on it
winces as a tooth cracks

Gee, Fred, how come  didn't get any business cards
Barney, it's all part of the plan
(to the others) Yes, boys, you see,  went up to my pal, Mister Slate and single- handedly made him an offer he couldn't refuse -- (Barney reacts to the "single-handedly" --) -- 'Freddy boy,' he sez to me, 'We gotta talk turkey -- ' Fred, we gotta talk turkey -- That's right -- just like that -- Fred --
Fred realizes Barney's got something on his mind
Ah, excuse us, boys

95                                                         95 Fred pulls Barney into a quiet corridor
They stand near a trophy case
There's some bowling trophies here with a variety of names on them
(There's also trophies for "pie-eating contests" and "beer drinking chug-offs"; these have only Fred's name on them
) Fred
what's this single-handed stuff
distinctly remember at least four hands and two of them were mine
(lowered voice) Barney, we could tell everyone how you invented this Fibrerock stuff, how Slate and Lava found out about it by accident and all, but what would that be
The truth
This is big business, Barney
We can't start telling the truth, it'd create the wrong impression
Think about all the really big deals in history -- back to the beginning of recorded time
Barney knits his brow in thought for maybe three seconds
Okay
What do they all have in common
(as Barney is stumped) 'll tell you
front man guy who's out in the public eye running the point, fighting the crowds
and meanwhile
back in the corner is the silent partner
never knew that
That's because the silent partner is always silent

'm out here running the guts of the operation but you got a cut
It looks like my mind, but you're really behind
get it
got the brains, but you just pretend to have them
Attaboy
And a confident Fred shakes hands with an unsure "silent partner"

Thanks, Betty
What would  do without you
Hmm
Probably run off to the tropics with one of those executive secretaries

Fred
Wait a minute
There's something wrong with your lunch -- ("weighing it") Yeah
it does feel a little light
He returns to her, opens the pail, is surprised to find it's empty
Before he can comment, she smilingly presents him with a spanking new briefcase

Fit for a king

Inside is a huge drumstick and some ribs

Finally -- Piltdown, this Fibrerock program is going to create a lot of changes around the plant
want to make one more
You've been a wonderful thug and goon for me
Now, 'd like to expand your duties
want you to become a provocateur
Gee, Mister Lava,  donno kinda like girls myself
(patiently) What  mean, is, 'm going to use you to double-cross your Lodge and Union brothers, and make their lives a living hell
Oh, okay
Good
You and your little pal will report directly to me and take orders only from me

Trust me
you'll get used to it

You already did
Lava leads them to a wood-sided trailer
Well, gentlemen, here you are
As soon as you're settled, come over to the assembly line
We'll go over the Fibrerock formula before the first run

The single window here looks out over the quarry scrap heap
(As we watch, somebody dumps a load of debris
) Threadbare furniture on a worn rug sits under a portrait of "Our Founder" (Slate)

Pause
Then they whirl, give each other high-fives
All-right
Welcome to the top -- partner
And as they shake, we -- : 106    -   -                                   106 Now, accompanied by heroic "industrial"-type , we see the Fibrerock assembly line in full operation
This cannot be described    now with appropriate justice, but it involves a series    of animal-powered conveyor belts, Rube Goldberg-like    funnels, spouts and chutes, and all sorts of gadgets,    gizmos, bells and whistles, to wit: () 53
106   :                                                    106 At one end of the building, dino-powered dumpsters and lifters drop off all the ingredients; these get stomped/ chewed/bashed and otherwise reduced to powder, which is then (courtesy of some squirting Mastodans) mixed with water into a foam, which bubbles through a long sawmill- type trough and is held back by a gate
Meanwhile, we see a sample item (in this case, a stone sofa) as it is placed before two "goatasauruses" which butt heads and smash the sofa between the two halves of a clay mold
When the mold is opened and the sofa tossed aside, Barney appears and personally "aims" the foam trough at a funnel in the top of the mold
Pausing to "taste" the mix, he smiles, then shouts -- Ready
aim
fibre
Barney pulls a rope which opens the trough
"Fibrefoam" pours into the mold
107                                                      107 gets "winched" unpwards by monkeys, and then an alliga- torsaurus whaps it with its tail
108                                                            108 Presto
Fibrerock copy     of the stone sofa drops neatly out of the mold, bounces    lightly on the conveyor belt below
It sparkles with     the tell-tale celadon-green shimmer of Fibrerock
As     it chugs along, the process repeats, and soon a score    of identical sofas is in view
109                                                109 as a beaming Fred watches, workers easily stack the Fibrerock sofas (often one-handed)
Nearby, we see Fibrerock window frames, doors, chairs, etc
110     - '                               110 Slate and Lava watch the progress, dollar signs in their eyes
: 111      -   -                 111 Fibrerock products are stacked up everywhere, stretching away like the inventory in Charles Foster Kane's warehouse
We see everything from Fibrerock bricks to Fibrerock table lamps to Fibrerock toilets

112    -                                          112 Fred and Barney, weary, approach each other, shake hands as they view the day's incredible output
Other weary, but proud workers gather around them: Mr
Slate is about to address them from his office balcony
Men, this is a proud day for Slate Construction
You have seen the first pieces of Fibrerock roll off the assembly line and into history
a history you are all part of
thanks to your very own fellow worker, Fred Flintstone
113    -                              113 They cheer Slate's remarks, pat Fred on the back
114                                                    114 No longer will man and beast bend under the backbreaking load of stone and rock and timber
because Fibrerock is so light that even a child can handle it
(pause) That's why on Monday we're going to hire two dozen children from Bedrock Technical Junior High
They'll be replacing the 36 heavy equipment operators, 15 shaft diggers and 22 laborers we're laying off today
Your pink slips will be in your final pay envelopes along with a ticket to the grand opening of Slate City
It's non-transferable, so hang on to it
Thank you, and have a nice weekend

Stopping it with his little hockey stick, the Mouse gasps, raises its hockey mask

And it's still pre-season
He whaps the ball to Slate again

Fred barges in, banging the door
Startled, Slate drives the ball instead of putting it
It sails across the room and  a of Mrs

Slate -- we gotta talk -- We do, eh
About what
About those guys outside, Mr
Slate
Some of 'em, well, they been here for years
And you, well, you can't lay them off just like -- (snapping fingers) -- that
Slate looks at Lava, who shrugs
Slate looks back at Fred, stays surprisingly calm
He toys with the putter, balances it on his palm
Of course  can, Fred
can lay them off like -- (snapping fingers) -- that, or like -- (a different style snap) -- that, or like -- He does a really nifty snap which combines with a buck- and-wing with the putter
-- that
(bravura slipping) Oh, you can, huh
Of course he can, Flintstone
It's his quarry
(still calm, warm) That's right
Why -- (chuckling) could lock the front door and go fishing if  wanted
Lava laughs along with the office staff and Slate
Fred chuckles a little to fit in

Lava quivers with mock surprise
Everyone really laughs, now
Or
(wiping away a tear) could fire you, Fred
(guffawing) Me
Ah, ha, that's rich, Mr
Slate, that's -- Suddenly Fred stops laughing
Flintstone, Lava, here, recommended that you be in charge of public relations to get Fibrerock off to a good start
'm a member of that public, Flintstone, and  have to say
this isn't a good start
'm getting a bad feeling about Fibrerock
bad feeling about
you
You want that feeling to go away, don't you
Uh
well, gee,
uh, yeah
Good
Then turn around and walk out of here and we'll forget all about this
Fred swallows, looks at Lava, goes meekly out

Now, what kind of act will you do
- How about a disappearing act
He takes a tentative step away but Betty grabs him
We're waiting
Pebbles and Bam-Bam sigh, huddle
We hear snatches of discussion
- Wanna recite something
Nah, what are we, little 'Inky Dinky Spidersaurus

How 'bout magic tricks
We could cut up a newspaper -- But then we'd need a hammer             - and chisel
oh, what about    That dumb thing
You that thing with Dino
think so
Pebbles turns, the decision made
Okay
We're gonna sing a song with Dino
Instantly, on cue, Dino leaps out of nowhere, holding a straw hat and a cane
Wilma and Betty look at each other, skeptical
Bam-Bam reaches into his shirt and takes out a whistle
He blows it -- one-and-a-two and-a -- 122                                                              122 comes  and Dino and his little friends do a dance routine we will call "The Dino Dance
" It is a spectac- ular blend of soft-shoe and the kind of dog-and-pony-show gags usually seen in the circus or on the Ed Sullivrock show
Most importantly, the routine includes the following: )    Dino leaps back and forth through a hoop

)   And finally, Dino uses his tail to flip the kids onto his back, culminating in a big "ta-da" after they all slide down the rope for a big finish
123                                                           123 (winding up) You can keep the Twist, The Frug and Hop don't need to Shimmy, don't need to Bop 'Cause 'm doin' doin' doin' The Igneous Rock
Panting for breath, Pebbles, Bam-Bam and Dino wait for a reaction
(to Wilma, impressed) Well
Think they're ready for the talent show
think they're ready for Rock Vegas

In a few moments we will cast our votes for the lodge officers

The election committee will make the preparations
(confident) Since when do you have to prepare for a landslide, right, guys

He turns as he realizes no one is sitting near him
He looks around and sees -- 126     - '                                         126 It's been altered to read "Fred Finkstone

127                                                       127 Fred looks around, sees Barney approaching, having just left a group of angry Buffalo
Barn -- w-what's going on
They're mad at you, Fred
it's understandable,  mean, they all got laid off today -- Fred crosses to the other guys, puts on a big smile
Guys, guys, come on now -- what's a quarry fulla layoffs got to do with a lodge fulla Buffaloes
Is that a riddle
Give me a second -- (stepping forward) 'll tell ya what
Mosta the guys in this lodge work for Mr
Slate -- -- You mean used to work for him -- until somebody opened their big mouth -- Fellas, come on
We're all big boys here -- He gestures vaguely towards the outside world, then back to the little band of brothers here
Surely we can separate in our minds work, and play
Job, and Lodge

and the election
second the motion
All in favor, say -- Wait, wait
Your Antlerness, please, one second --
Fred grabs Barney by the shoulder, spins him around, pushes him forward like a refrigerator on a dolly, stands him up center stage
Barney, you gotta tell the other guys what really happened
Tell 'em the story behind Fibrerock
The true story
The room quiets
Barney clears his throat
Fred waits, hopeful
Well, there's not much to tell
(trying to remember Fred's phraseology) True,  got a cut
but Fred's got a gut
No, no, the rest --
Oh, yeah,  remember
got the mind, but Fred's got the behind
Right, Fred
Barney turns, gives Fred a big wink
Fred groans
Thank you, Brother Rubble

Everyone does a bull-like stomp and scrape
All for Piltdown, bellow now
The room  with -
All for Flintstone, bellow now
Fred snorts, sounding like Herb Alpert's lonely bull
Even under his furry fez we see him "looking around" desperately, hoping to hear one more snort
He kind of sneaks in one more forlorn grunt which fades away
finally, as Fred squirms miserably, there is one more lonely snort
from Barney, of course
Order furs
The fezzes come up
The snorts have it
Brother Piltdown, it is my privilege to install you as the new Exalted Herdmaster Erect Antler and Big Buck of our Lodge
If you'll come forward,  will present you with the tokens of office
Cheers and applause as Piltdown goes to the podium
128                                             128 Fred's a broken man
Barney moves over, puts his arm around him
voted for you, Fred
Big deal, after you screwed everything up in the first place
Barney reacts, really hurt
He moves away on the bench
Fred's so agitated he doesn't even realize it

129                                                         129 Piltdown accepts the festooned fez and shoulder ribbon, smiles at the group
Thank you, Brother Chairman
Fellow Buffaloes, 'm a man of few words
It's no secret that most of our lodge members are also members of Amalgamated Neolithic 101
which means that most of us aren't gonna be able to make our cave payments next month
So my agenda for tonight
ends right now
There's a time to be a Buffalo
there's a time ta be a brown nosin' double-crossin' creep
All heads turn and swivel to look at Fred
swivel back
and there's a time to stand up and be a man
So let's go down there and make the Slate shop into slate scrap
then we'll see how he gets along without the heavy equipment operators of Neolithic 101
Meeting adjourned
With angry grumbles and threats, the meeting breaks up
Fezzes are thrown into cubby holes and hard hats are slapped on
The Buffalo run out
When the dust clears, we see that only one member has avoided the herding instinct: Barney
Now, he turns, runs into -- 130     -   -                     130 Fred is at the bar, opening a beer
He looks wistfully at the old, framed picture on the wall -- reacts as he sees -- 131                                                       131 Even his childhood shot has been defaced
132                                                   132 He sets his jaw with a "screw 'em" expression, downs his beer
Then Barney runs up, shakes him by the shoulders

Fred
The Buffalo are heading for big trouble --
No kidding
They rejected the best candidate -- No, no, not that
Piltdown's got the guys all worked up and they're heading down to the quarry
They're gonna wreck the assembly line
(genuinely worried) Oh, no
That -- that's horrible
(pause) We could end up with half a percent of nothing
No, Fred, if they do that they'll be breakin' the law
Our brother Buffalo could go to jail
Oh, yeah, yeah, that, too
come on, Barn, we gotta stop 'em
: 133
-                                      133 Silent, empty
the still yard  the gate
Down the road, we see Piltdown leading the angry mob
Quickly, they go to the gate, climb up and over it
Okay
Let's start with Slate's golf trophies and work our way up to the assembly line
angry cheers, and the mob storms into the plant, knocking aside equipment and supplies
134     -    -                               134 Both pedaling like mad
() 66
134   :                                                     134 don't believe this
how did things ever get this out of hand --
know
Makes you wish things were back the way they were
before we was big executives
Well,  wouldn't go that far
Suddenly they're interrupted by the sound of a
Fred looks back and sees -- 135                                                 135 Coming up from rear
Feldspar grabs his megaphone as he pulls abreast of Fred
Flintstone
Pull over
Oh, no, not now
Feldspar signals Fred onto the shoulder
Fred smiles, nods
136     '                                            136 He slams them down through the floorboard -- 137                                                             137 Fred's  , spins out, whirling around like a record on a turntable
It jerks to a halt 180 degrees later, and then  off in the opposite direction
138                                                          138 So astonished he follows this action with his head
a bad move because -- Sarge
Look out --
139                                                          139 The patrol  runs off the road,  into a stone fire hydrant
Water squirts into the air
Feldspar and Gravel are drenched
They're just coming to their senses when the ground heaves -- the car's front wheels rise -- 67
140                                                          140 As we see that the water spout is actually coming from the blowhole of a whale which now sticks a bit of its head up from under the broken curb
'm gonna sue you for everything you got -- : 141     -                                            141 Led by Piltdown, the workers have grabbed a big timber which they're using like a battering ram on the doors of the assembly line building
Suddenly, with a crash, the doors go down
Piltdown and Pyrite stand back while the angry workers rush past them
(loudly) Now we'll show 'em who's boss
They can't push us around
Piltdown and Pyrite smash a few items to get everybody juiced up, and then
when no one is looking
they slip out the back
142      -                                          142 Fred pulls into the lot, slams his feet down to stop -- we hear  -- they fishtail all over, slam right through a storage area for crates and barrels which collapse all around them
Finally they slam broadside into the main Quarry build- ing, knocking a hole in the wall
143                                                          143 Fred and Barney cough in the rising dust
Neither one of them sees what we see, which is that visible in the hole in the wall is the Slate Company's granite-doored safe
and right beside it is the Xenosaurus, which now jumps up, startled, dropping a crowbar and a big hand drill
Recovering its composure, the Xenosaurus grabs up the tools as well as a big canvas bag and tiptoes away, vanishing just as our heroes stir
() 68
143   :                                                  143 (double-taking) Barn
Did you see that --
(peering through the dust) -- Huh, now it's gone coulda sworn
Come on Fred
Time to earn those big bucks
They rush into the plant
144
-                                   144 As the workers continue their rampage, Piltdown and Pyrite reappear
Darn that Flintstone and Rubble
they're gonna screw everything up
Not if we give 'em a nice long vacation
in the hospital
Saying this, he grips tightly on a wrench
Then some rampaging workers rush by
Piltdown gives them an encour- aging cheer, and then he and Pyrite lead them up some stairs to the assembly line catwalk
There, Pyrite begins  some   with a club, while Piltdown uses brute strength to snap big support beams which he flings below
145    -                                               145 Winds up for another   baseball-type swing -- but as he follows through, the   ball-shaped light fixture jerks up on its cable
Unable    to stop in time, Pyrite spins around, falls on his   ass
Barney drops down  , hanging horizontally from the rafters
He's holding the light fixture with his free hand
Stee-rike one
Heh-hey
Ready for a curve ball
Pyrite doesn't have a sense of humor; club in hand, he jumps up, starts chasing Barney through the rafters
69
146                                                        146 Spits on his hand, grabs another big beam
He pulls down on it
but it doesn't snap, it goes right up again
Puzzled, he pulls down on it again
there's another see-saw motion
This time Piltdown goes with the flow, pushes up and peers under the beam
147                                                        147 Fred is hanging on the other end
Brother Piltdown
can we talk about this, antler to antler
Piltdown roars, begins slamming the girder up and down
Guess not
Fred inches down the shuddering beam, jumps off
Freed of Fred's weight, the other end "" down on Piltdown's head
He groans, recovers in time to chase after Fred
148                                                 148 Square off in the rafters
Give me your best shot
Pyrite swings
Barney ducks and Pyrite  a pane
Barney dodges again and the same thing happens
Getting cocky, Barney does it one more time
but this time the window is hinged in the center and the swivel action after the hit whaps Barney on the back and knocks him into Pyrite's next blow
149                                                            149 Is backpedaling away from Piltdown on the upper super- structure of the assembly line
Fred scrapes one foot in an arc in front of him
Dare you to cross that line
Piltdown crosses it
That line
() 70
149   :                                                 149 Piltdown crosses it
Fred "marks" another one
Piltdown doesn't even wait for the challenge, takes a giant step
Oops
Bad idea: The last "line" was at the edge of a straight drop
Piltdown yelps, "treads air" in the best cartoon manner -- and then desperately grabs a handful of Fred's clothing
Both men fall -- at the last minute Piltdown catches a ladder
150    -                                        150 Fred lands with a thud right in the clay mold used to form the Fibre products
Worse, the impact arouses the goatasauruses out of their sleep
Dutifully, they rise, and then ram both sides of the mold just as Fred is struggling to his feet
Fred's yell is muffled by the clay
151                                      151 Aroused by the "start up" of the assembly line, they do their job
Fibre foam begins to chug down the trough: The alligator crane picks up the mold, shakes it
152                                                          152 is flung to the conveyor belt, stiffly caked in clay
153                                                  153 shudders -- and shakes out a Fibre statue of
Fred
154                                                         154 The real Fred, moving stiffly like a robot, is getting to his feet when his Fibre doppleganger slams him to the mat again
moment later, another "Fred" drops down beside him
155                                                      155 Has descended the ladder, hopping mad
Now, he sees Fred coming toward him
Piltdown breaks a big lever off the equipment, swings -- reacts astonished as "" 156                                                          156 Back down the line, he's seen this
His clay-caked Adam's apple gulps
Quickly, he turns and tries to "tip-toe" away -- then, with a  and  -- the clay and Fibre all over him solidifies
Desperate, he tries to move
can't

157                                                        157 Watches, confused, as dozens of Fred Flintstones chug towards him on the belt
He shrugs, smashes the next one in line
Another phoney
He smashes the next one
: 158     -                                             158 Dodging Pyrite's renewed attack
Now, Barney becomes aware of the activated assembly line
Getting an idea, he moves behind an inspection table, grabs a big rubber stamp
Pyrite comes around the    corner
Barney's head butts him in the gut, dodges under    his legs
Then, as Pyrite stumbles, Barney stamps    his ass with the word "
" Pyrite looks back, sees    this, reddens
raises his club
Reject, huh
Whaddya say we reject your head
He raises the club
when an alligator swings down and grabs him by the seat of his pants
Pyrite drops the club, howls -- 159                                                           159 The alligator crane swings him away and over a big bin marked  -- and drops him
Howling, Pyrite falls into a big bin of broken and defective Fibrerock goods
160                                                          160 Chuckles to himself
and then looks down, reacts
and we see that Piltdown has smashed yet another of the duplicate Freds
Worried, Barney looks around, sees that he's just above the Fibrefoam chute
Without another thought, he jumps into it -- slides downward like a passenger on the Magerock Mountain Log Flume ride -- 161                                                           161 Piltdown is about to swing at the real Fred -- when Barney sails out of the end of the chute and slams into him and Fred
All three of them roll across the floor towards -- 72
162                                               162 where a squad of policemen has just appeared -- led by a dripping wet Feldspar and Gravel
All right
You're all under arr -- Wham
Barney, Fred and Piltdown roll right into the cops, who go flying like (what else
) tenpins, complete with appropriate sound
(sitting up) Whattya know
Even got the spare again
Then he gasps as he looks over at Fred, whose head has just fallen off
Pause
Fred's real head slowly pokes up out of the clay and Fibre shoulders
Before he can extricate himself further, Feldspar and his men are dragging them out of the building

"Wanted" posters of stone are hanging on the walls
As we watch, the contrite buffalos are bailed out by friends and relations
Wilma and Betty are just now clunking down stone money on the night sergeant's desk
Barney,  don't understand
what came over you boys
'Night, Barney

Who knew Flintstone and Rubble would show up, too
The day after Slate City opens there's going to be an audit
If the stuff isn't gone by then we'll all be doing time until the Bronze Age
Don't worry, Mister Lava
we're on top of it
They both turn and start down an alley
jamming together as they do
Lava sighs
then jumps as Barney comes up behind him and taps him on the shoulder
Excuse me, Mister Lava -- think you oughta know
something could be wrong with the Fibrerock mix

ah, why do you say that

Tastes
different
Yup
See, ever since  started with Fibrerock --  mean, since me and Fred started with it, always take a little taste of the Fibre foam
And tonight's batch, well
didn't get much of it, but it seems a little off
(smacking his lips) Can't fool the old taste buds, heh-heh
think there might be an ingredient missing
So tomorrow, 'll run a couple of tests and stuff -- Rubble, Rubble
We're fighting a deadline to finish Slate City
and we're not pulling the plug on production to satisfy your tastebuds
If you ask me, you and your tastebuds are overworked overwrought
how long have you been with us, anyway
Nine days, Mister Lava
Jumping Jurrasic, no wonder you're so run down
He puts his arm around Barney, leads him towards the car where Betty is waiting
'm authorizing a nice vacation for you, Rubble
Starting tomorrow
You can catch some rays, maybe invent something

'  -                                   165 Slate and Lava are examining a newer and larger model of Slate City
It's even more grandiose than its predecessor
Now the housing development has two huge office buildings beside it, and then a convention center beyond that
As you can see, the Fibrerock is so light we're using it for construction, for furnishings
for everything
You can't stack a two-bedroom cave this high
but the sky's the limit with Fibrerock
'Sky's the limit'
'sky's the limit'
why, these two buildings, they
they practically scrape the sky
We should call them
Slate scrapers
That's brilliant, Unc
Mister Slate
In fact, maybe you can help me with the centerpiece of the complex
(indicating the convention center) wanna call 'em the FibreSphere and the '____' something Needle
but  just can't
(modestly) How about, 'Slate Needle'
'Slate Need

(heading for the door) Oh, Mister Slate, we're going to hold the Bedrock Junior Talent Show in the uh, 'Slate Needle
' Good for public relations -- Lava breaks off
He's just looked out the window and seen -- 166   '  -                                166 small figure appears behind some of the equipment, tiptoeing from console to cabinet and thus towards the assembly line
Wearing sunglasses with attached nose and a hook-on beard, it at first appears to be some sort of bizarre hermit or bum
and then we realize, hey, this is Barney
167                                                            167 Looks around, spots Piltdown and Pyrite, now resplendent in security guard uniforms
Lava whistles softly to get their attention, can't
Then he sees one of Slate's golf trophies
He shrugs, throws it
168    -                                              168 Reacts as the trophy bounces off his head, then looks up to see Lava gesticulating
Piltdown nods, grabs Pyrite in tow

Then he tiptoes
, right into the massive bulk of -- 170                                                        170 -- who looks down at him with a big smile, Pyrite at his side

(chuckling) Ya can start by cleaning the street with your pants
Still laughing, Piltdown and Pyrite cross over to Lava, who has come out of the office building
That takes care of the half-pint

(on the move) But Barney doesn't want to take a vacation -- he says he's gotta be here to check up on the Fibrefoam -- (pointedly) -- Oh
Or check up on us
Emotionally, Lava turns, indicates a picture of Slate on the wall

172   :                                                    172 Flintstone, that
that's a slap in the face of our founder
our employer
our uncle
(turning back, another tone) Unless, of course, you agree with Rubble
that Mister Slate isn't capable of running this operation that 'm not capable of running it
(nervous) Of course not, Mister Lava
But -- Call me Jerry
Sit down, please
Fred complies
Lava winces as his designer under Fred's weight, but he only says -- (offering one) Cigar
Why, yeah, sure, Jerry
Fred, let me get to the bottom slime
Some men -- you and me, for instance -- we're cut out for the big time, the big bucks
(eyeing Fred's girth) the big everything
Lava smiles, prepares the tips on two cigars
He puts each one in turn in a gizmo on his desk

The Lizard bites the tip off the cigar, practically chokes on it, finally manages to spit it out with difficulty

Well, actually,  wouldn't say small part
'd say
Yes
Kind of a medium-sized
well, almost medium-sized
well, really a semi-partial assistant counsulting type, of -- (giving Fred a playful punch) You're too kind, Flintstone, that's what  like about you
But you're a big guy with a big decision to make
Are you gonna keep covering for Barney, keep pulling his acornsauruses out of the fire
or are you going to concentrate on your own important duties
Well, gee, that's tough one -- (pause) -- Uh, what are my important duties

Lovely little guest 'ouse, Mister Flintstone
So simple, so ordinary, so unexceptional
why, h'it's almost quaint
Let's say we start with the camera 'ere, except
Leach breaks off, looks over the fence at the Rubble homestead
He shakes his head sadly
-what's wrong
Well, just look at that yard over there
barbecues and trikes, not exactly the right image
(pointing) Maybe you could move those plants to block them out
Good idea
Rodney, get 'hoppin' with those greens
The aide nods, gathers some workers
They start moving the potted plants
Puzzled, Wilma comes over
Fred, this was supposed to be a 'typical evening' at the Flintstones, and you invited fifty people  don't even know
Now what's going on
Where are they taking my ficus-sauruses
It's the Rubble yard, Wilma
It's just not the right image
He starts away, suddenly notices his own barbecue and trikes
quickly, without missing a stride, he tosses a tarp over them, slides a potted plant over for good measure

after the way Fred's been treating you lately -- Fred's in a high-powered executive job, Betty
There's a lot of pressure on him
Yeah

If it wasn't for poor Wilma wouldn't give him the Geological Time -- Trust me, Betty
After the Fibrerock debut, he'll be the same old Fred

Now the big potted plants are dropped into place
With each hammer stroke or thud a little more of the late afternoon sun is shut off until Barney and Betty are in shadow
Finally a canvas tarp is tossed as gracefully as pizza dough, sails into the Rubble yard and covers their bird bath
One last stray end lands on Barney's head

Fred seems oblivious to the fact that they're oblivious to him
Yas, yas, it's a challenging commodity market these days
Personally, 'm considering petrified forests, but they do say that volcano futures are ready to explode, ha, ha

Come on, Pebbles

Just you and me now, Dino
Yeah
That's okay
Man and man's best friend
He gives Dino one of the canapes
Dino tastes it, makes a face, spits it out
runs off, going "" all the way
We see him run to the corner, jump in Betty's car and drive away
200                                                           200 sighs, looks around, down at his blazer and the "" patch
He suddenly rips it off in a fury
Then he looks at -- 201        '                       201 202                                                    202 Fred stares at it, his face slowly darkening
Then he grabs a lawn chair from the yard, begins to smash it in a fury against the divider
The wall cracks, splinters; the potted plants go flying
203                                                           203 His anger spent, he stands panting, splattered with dirt
then he sees -- 204     -  -                      204 -- standing in the ruins of the wall
The figure sneezes, whacks dirt off of itself
It's -- (disbelieving) Barney
(moving closer) Hiya, Fred
(noticing his ruined tuxedo) Boy, the rental place is gonna be mad
(eyeing the mess) You feeling better, pal

204   :                                                    204 'Pal'
How can you call me that
Barney,

Well, yeah
But more of a -- (helpful tone) Fool
Well -- Slimeball

(wincing, but taking it) Barney

can you ever forgive me for being such a jerk
(stepping closer) Sure, Fred
(smiling) 've had lots of practice
(touched) Aw, Barn
And he grabs Barney in a big bear hug
Tears in both their eyes, they slap each other on the back, two prehistoric sensitive guys

and those iridescent vegetable pearls we've come to know

Underneath are all kinds of daring and tantalizing fashions woven in the tell-tale fibre colors
The clothes are a blend of the future and retro (that is, prehistoric retro)
Because the clothes of the Stone Age are as extinct as stones themselves
Yes, thanks to the wonder of Fibrerockfibre, the world of high fashion will be totally transformed

all of it upstaged by a choir consisting of every animal, bird and critter we've seen in this film
Wilma, Betty, the kids and Dino ooh and ahh with the other guests as the mechanical animals all sing in unison -- (

'  -                                212 Fred and Barney are surrounded by books and cartons and memorabilia
They have their arms around each other and are singing
& 'Now it's time to do or die, grab that rock and kick it high, let's fight, fight, fight for Bedrock High
' They break up laughing
Fred chuckles, looks at one of the many old photographs strewn around
Boy, those were the days, Barney
Bedrock High winning all those games
and you and me right in the middle of it
94
213     -                                    213 The photograph (dots in stone) shows the young Fred and Barney in their cheerleading costumes
Barney has a sweater and megaphone; Fred is in a Godzilla-like "mascot" costume
He's holding the hideously-sculpted head under his arm
Yeah
Too bad we never made the team
So what
We made the team spirit
That's just as important
whatever happened to those cheerleader costumes
You know Betty
She never throws anything away
He hauls out an old footlocker, opens it
There they are
(rummaging in it) Boy
Talk about memories
Fred tosses the cheerleader sweater to Barney, who grins, pulls it on
Fred also starts to get into his old "uniform," but has to suck his gut in mightily
Finally, he can zip it up, stern to stem
Back then, we thought a pop quiz was a big problem
We didn't know how good we had it
No problems, no worries
Saying this, Fred attempts to put on the Godzilla-like head
He has a hard time sliding it into a hinge rail behind his neck, an even harder time swinging it down and forward
Speaking of problems and worries, shouldn't we get on over to Slate's party
Fred has finally "clinked" the monster head down into place
Now, when he talks, the monster's mouth moves in sync
() 95
213   :                                                      213 (echo-y) What for
So him and all his fancy friends can look down their noses at us
Completely covered in the ferocious-looking suit, Fred steps over to Barney, stabs an angry claw in his direction
(echo-y) All they've been doing is using us, Barney
And meanwhile -- Now Fred reaches up to take the head off
It sticks for a moment
Finally he gets it to flip back on its hinge where it hangs behind his neck like a ski parka hood
(normal voice) -- Meanwhile all the time they were laughing at us
Yeah
When did you notice that
About an hour ago
Boy, there's no fooling you, Fred
Suddenly, with a  ,  and , a scale model of Slate City in the corner begins to fall apart
Fred and Barney look at each other, startled, then rush over to the model
It's the interim version we saw earlier
214    -                                                   214 The decomposition continues, walls and supports turning into sand and running down before our eyes
In a Rube Goldberg-like continuum, the little houses go first, falling like dominoes
Wha
what's happening
Barney tries to stop the process, can't
() 96
214   :                                                   214 don't know
the Fibrerock it's
it's decomposing
but this shouldn't happen
Your old models are just fine

216                                                     216 It should be
There's enough coo-coo berry resin in there to petrify a brontosaurus -- Suddenly Barney gets it
He looks from the older models to the now decomposing little Fibresphere with growing awareness
(snapping his fingers) -- The coo-coo berries
Fred, that's it
What's it
Remember  said the Fibrefoam tasted funny
It was the coo-coo sap that was missing
But
why would -- Why
Because coo-coo berries are as valuable as goldrock
And we've had tons of 'em delivered to the plant since we started
somebody musta got greedy -- -- Not 'somebody' -- Lava
(alarmed) Fred, that sap acts as a fixative -- it's the glue that holds the whole formula together --

what's happening here
(finishing it) Is gonna happen for real in the real Slate City
Oh no
Barney
Wilma and Betty -- and the kids -- they're all there -- With a final , the little and then the nearby   , model story by model story
Finally the "" on top of the needle is all that's left, wobbling around like a spun dinner plate
It finally falls
(worried) -- -barney
what do we do
Barney runs to a locker, grabs a big plunger-powered flit gun, begins filling it with a red liquid
Coo-coo berry sap, Fred
It's our only chance -- their only chance
Barney gives it a quick test squirt
Fred nods, and they rush out of the room
the ruins of the model "Slate City"

Obviously, the talent show has begun
In the audience, Lava fidgets with nervous and confident energy
gives Wilma a big look
You're certainly looking lovely this evening, Mrs
Flintstone
Life with a junior executive must agree with you

thank you
think
(looking into her eyes) Yes
think so, too
(smiling) Imagine how good you'd look with a senior executive
Oh
Is Fred getting promoted
Lava laughs, sure she's kidding
then not so sure
The ventriloquist finishes to scattered applause
The kid bows, gets up
splashes across puddles of water on the stage area
The Headmistress of 'ecole Superior et al steps up
Behind her, the picture window displays the expanse of Slate City: The twin Slatescrapers framing endless rows of little tract houses stretching to the distant volcanic ridge

Slate's vairy own gran' nephew

She steps aside
Curtain rises on little Poindexter
He is carrying a leather-and-bone accordion
He begins to play: (singing loudly) 'Dino of Spain,  adore you Right from the moment  saw you -- ' 99

221                                                    221 It's the xenosaurus, lurking behind the   exhibits

What'll we do when we get there
We just tell Mister Slate that all 500 acres of his development are going to crumble into dust any minute
(holds up the flit gun) Then we zap the stairs and corridors with some of this coo-coo sap
just hope we have enough to get everybody out -- whoops
He's said this last because as he held up the flit gun, the handle whacked the back of Fred's monster costume, and the head has flipped down with a solid "clink

Hang on, hang on -- Oops
He rotates the head completely around

"'"  -                          224 "Rockdonald's" is, of course, complete with golden arches of stone, a drive-up window, etc
It even has the oblig- atory cops on a break
in this case, Feldspar and Gravel
They're sitting in their patrol car eating from little bamboo containers shaped just like McDonald's Styrofoam
(Of course, the logo on the building behind them proudly reads " 100
") (mouth full, bitching) Speed traps again
Face it, Gravel
'm in a rut
and meanwhile, the guys who went through the academy with me, they're all big shots now: Sam Slate
Dirty Harock
Magma,
And you know why
'Cause they got the breaks, that's why

They look out their window at -- 225      -                                   225 both still battling the wheel and the resistant costume head

Some sorta creature was attacking that little guy --
There's a lesson there, Gravel
never pick up hitchhikers
Besides -- (realizing) -- Did you say 'creature'
They do a big double-take at the now-vanishing car
& The xenosaurus
Excited, Feldspar bangs his dashboard and a in a police uniform pops
Feldspar grabs it around the neck, holds it like a microphone
This is a xenosaurus alert
Repeat, a xenosaurus alert
The creature has been sighted on the Slate City exit of the Venturock Freeway
It is driving a brown late model sedan and eating a white male Caucasian
Car twelve is in hot pursuit
He releases the bird, which doesn't fly away right away, but gives him a look
(remembering) Oh, yeay
over and out
The bird nods, appeased, flies off
(as it goes) Awwk
Car Twelve is on the way
Car Twelve is on the way
(thrilled) Gravel, this could mean promotions for both of us

Something breaks
Barney falls back on the passenger side of the car
Fred drives with one hand, "raps" the monster head
It rattles
When Fred speaks again, the monster mouth no longer opens and closes in sync
(muffled, shouting) Ho, gweat
Hoo bwoke hit, Bahnee
Hi khnat twalk hennymore
Suddenly both men (pardon, man and xenosaurus) react to an approaching
They both look back at -- 228   '                                        228 Closing in
Gravel has produced a little sabre tooth and is "cranking" its tail
As it  away, the cops close in on our heroes

What, and explain what you're doing in that costume
Start talking about coo-coo berries and Fibrerock

Barney, covered with debris, rummages around and sighs with relief when he finds the flit gun of coo-coo sap is still intact

" However, whereas the previous version of this was done impromptu and a cappella with only a few primitive props and straw hats alone, this time the kids and Dino are fully costumed, with sequins, batons and the like, and the dance is completely choreographed
You can keep the twist, the frug and hop -- 234                                                234 As the Dino dance begins,

Suddenly Mrs
Slate jumps up, barges on stage
The Madame Slate, what ees wrong --
'll tell you what's wrong
This 'act' is an absolute disgrace
This is supposed to be a talent show
And a pedestrian animal act like this belongs in a circus

circus, huh
Well, if our kids belong in a circus with their act, then your little nephew belongs in a zoo with his -- Yeah -- a zoo where the animals are dead -- because if they aren't, they will be
Why, how dare you
Mrs
Flintstein, 'll have you know that my little Poindexter has been trained by the finest tutors

Nervous, he tosses the accordion aside
But the destruction continues: Another Then, the entire building shakes

Slate gets to his knees and looks out the window
and his jaw drops in astonishment

) Behind him,
Feldspar tenses, but it's -- No sign of the driver
You kidding
By now he's a couple of shinbones and a belch
Gravel drops down on one knee, excited
He shines his light on Fred's big "clawprints

Look how deep these tracks are
That xeno thing must weigh a ton
They aim their lights at the tracks, begin to follow them
Suddenly they round a corner and come face to face with -- 240     -                                            240 He's stopped between two sample homes to wrestle with the monster head again
Now, he freezes in twin flash- light beams
Okay, lizard, reach for the sky

Nogh, wate, chum baggk -- As Fred "roars" and moves forward, Feldspar and Gravel scream, panic, and run

It collapses totally, falling in on itself, obscuring Fred
Finally the last
Pause
Fred staggers out of the rubble, realizes that the impact has knocked the monster mask off his head and back on its hinges
He rubs dust out of his eyes, turns and looks at the Slate Needle
He's much closer to it now
Quickly, he runs toward it

too late
He ends up with a face full of Fibredust
Now, he whirls as Fred runs up, points -- Barney
The elevator --
Barney runs toward it, hits the button

Seeing the mouse, a nearby mastadon becomes frightened, begins running
heavy cable tied to the mastadon runs over a pulley and into -- 247                                                247 -- where the elevator rises out of the sub-level and Fred and Barny start towards it
when suddenly the Fibrerock elevator begins to crumble
Quick
Use your coo-coo gun --
Barney aims, pulls back the plunger
too late
The elevator is gone
The cable swings back and forth loosely, "whapping" the shaft walls as it shoots upwards
Fred dives for the cable, misses
As he stumbles, Barney leaps on Fred's back, catches the cable
As Barney starts to whizz upwards, Fred garbs onto his ankles

Suddenly one of those police   comes flying excitedly through the window, lands on a perch in front of the Chief
Calling all cars
Calling all cars
Unconfirmed reports of destruction and collapse at Slate City
Rescue vehicles are on the way
The xenosaurus has been spotted in the area
That is all
That is all
(excited) You see --
told you -- All right, Feldspar, 'm convinced
As of this moment you're completely in charge of operation
(dramatic) 'Xeno Dino'
Now, what do you need
Feldspar
This is the moment he's waited for all his life

The elevator cable sways from its uppermost pulley
Slowly, something stirs in the pile of arms, legs and scaly limbs

Next, Fred sits up
Damn
The impact has knocked Fred's monster mask back on his head
Fred mutters angrily
Barney starts to help
and then they both notice that there's another monstrous head in the middle of their group
There're big "takes" all around, and then the xenosaurus leaps out of the tangle of bodies, treads air, and runs away
(recovering) Fred, stop it
It might know the way inside
Fred "gets up to speed" and chases the xeno
Barney follows
251                                                                251 Fred and Barney both leap on the mysterious xenosaurus -- all crash through a wall -- 252
-                                         252 The panicked partygoers turn as a section of wall collapses
Dust and debris billow upwards
The battered monster mask breaks loose from Fred's costume, bounces on the floor
Slowly, everyone gets up: Fred
Barney and two halves of the xenosaurus: The bottom half is Piltdown; the top-half is Pyrite
Fred
Barney
- Daddy
Pop
Piltdown
Pyrite
What the devil's going on here
It's real simple, Mister Slate
Your boy Lava here has been stealing the coo-coo berries from the Fibrerock mix and fixing the books to hide it
That's ridiculous, Flintstone
Nobody could get that many coo-coo berries off our premises

Thousands and thousands of coo-coo berries tumble out
253                                                               253 Slaps his hands over his face

Rubble -- part of our exciting display -- Fakes
(to Piltdown) Gee, Pilty,  thought the real ones were gonna be moved up here for us ta steal -- whatta waste a time -- Pyrite, shaddup -- (snapping fingers) Now  remember
These guys were pulling this xenosaurus act that night at the plant
What's this, Lava
'Plan '
Uncle
Are you going to stand there while aspersions are being cast at the Slate family
This is absurd -- Of course it is
Why, without the coo-coo berry sap, Fibrerock would be completely -- (realizing) -- unstable
Suddenly the entire building shudders
Dust falls from the ceiling
Everyone looks at Lava

254   :                                                     254 All right, all right,  admit it
got in over my head in the stock market
took some big losses
had these guys pull jobs for me all over town disguised as a monster
but it still wasn't enough
and when  saw all those coo-coo berries being delivered every day,  guess  just lost my head
figured with the Woca sap in the Fibremix, the berry juice as superfluous
'll tell you what's superfluous, Lava
your liver
So why don't we remove it --
He leaps, snarling, on top of Lava
Fred and Barney pull them apart
Then, more falling dust and beams give everyone more pressing problems -- : 255
-                                   255 Rescue  and police   up, slam to a halt, The rescue workers jump out
Firefighters carry circular trampolines of hide stitched to bamboo frames; others go to the back of their trucks and start to turn cranks on the hook and ladder trucks to raise the ladders
256                                    256 It's actually a wheeled carriage carrying a firesaurus, which is a critter with a very tiny body and an incred- ibly long neck
The bony plates on the creature's back make perfect stairs
However, the creature is noticeably listless and uncooperative
Come on, come on, what's the hold up --
It's the kibble crisis, sir -- the firesauruses have been on half-rations for a month
Above them, the   again

When they hit the floor, the oil lamps inside spills and fire spreads
(pointing) Fred
There's a fire hose --
Indeed, it's on the back wall in a closed box marked --
Fred and Barney take a step towards it, but the fire quickly spreads and cuts them off
Helpless, they step back
With a  , the two   visible through what's left of the picture window
Then the big statue of Slate just outside the window begins to decompose
It falls in on itself like a sand sculpture in a storm
finally, for a split second it is, well, life-sized, and then the head of the statue snaps loose, through the only remaining pane of  here rolls up to Slate's feet
Pause
Everyone looks at everyone else
This is it: Titanic time
Fred embraces Wilma
Barney embraces Betty
Their kids are pulled into the clinch
Even Slate takes Mrs
Slate's hand
Talk about grace under pressure

(pause; false smile) Sure, pal
We just gotta wait for the fire department
Right, Fred

Everything's gonna be just -- Whoa, hoo-hah, aggh -- () 113

-- Wait a minute --  don't feel anything at all -- With his other "claw" he slaps tentatively at the flames, and then confidentially snuffs it out
It must be the suit, Fred -- old Bedrock High built them things to last -- Fred looks over at the wall of flame separating the guests from the fire hose
As everyone gets the same idea, Dino rushes up, the costume head in his mouth
All brighten
Barney helps Fred with the head, twists it into place
(rapping on the head) -- Okay
Hist hust fine
He lowers his head, runs through the fire, which licks at him harmlessly
Then with his claw, he  the amber  -- 260                                                          260 big  is curled up inside,
(Note to herpetologists: The pythonosaurus is      not quite a snake: it has little vestigial forepaws      the better to emote with
Right now the snoring head      is in those little paws
) The Pythonsaurus stirs, looks at Fred, "sniffs" the smoke
Then he raises one hand and finger as if to say "one moment
" Then the pythonsaurus turns his head towards a nozzle like the ones in hamster cages, slurps loudly
We hear gallons and gallons of   away

261                                                  261 Everyone retreats from the fire
Slate picks up the head of the statue, his only souvenir
262                                                           262 Waiting impatiently until the pythonsaurus finally finishes drinking
It wipes its mouth daintily with a napkin, slaps a little fire helmet on its head, turns and runs back into the other room
(Behind him, yards and yards of pythonsaurus unroll from a hidden compart- ment behind the box
) Water shoots out of the creature's mouth
263                                                              263 Fred turns in a semi-circle and puts out every lick of flame in the room
All the guests cheer, rush forward and slap Fred on the back
Pebbles jumps up on him and kisses him
Hit fuzz nudding
wheely
The pythonsaurus looks around at the attention
Hey, what am , chopped liver
Come on, everybody -- we'll go out the way we came
Barney squirts a pathway with his flit gun, solidifying a route in the crumbling Fibrerock
Then Barney and Fred stand back nobly, wave everyone on into the adjacent Fibresphere
(pushing and shoving) Outta the way -- outta the way -- women and children first -- mean, ah, children and women first, yeah, yeah, provided that uh, there's room for the women
Meanwhile, the pythonsaurus gives Fred (or rather his costume) a big look up and down, looks  the
Hey, not bad
Wonder if she lives around here
Just then Fred tilts back the monster head
The pythonsaurus reacts

Depressed, the pythonsaurus follows the others
Fred and Barney cross over into the Fibresphere
As the do, Slate Needle completely collapses

-                                 264 The Slate Needle tumbles down, taking a big chunk of the Fibresphere with it
But the rest of the huge globe stays put
for now

(panicking) Oh, geez, we're all gonna croak -- neva shoulda left Far Rockaway -- Wilma gives her a big suspicious look -- blanching, the Headmistress slides down the cable -- 267                                                           267 The rescue teams catch the people in nets as they hit the ground

Poindexter Lava pushes his way forward

Embarrassed, Mrs

Barney's carrying Bam-Bam

slamming the monster head back in place

Their kids on their backs, Fred and Barney exchange a heroic forearm-to-forearm gladiator-type handshake
both put their hands on the cable
and then the whole pulley mechanism falls right down between them and through the hole
second later, the entire remaining structure collapses

When we can see again, well, it's not a pretty sight
The entire fibresphere is gone
All that's left, teetering on two spindly supports, are two tiny islands of safety connected by a twisted maze of rubble too small for a human to negotiate
and all that's holding that up is a long guide wire leading to the ground
275                                                        275 Figures on one of the islands stir: Fred

The platform shudders again
Barney aims the flit gun -- empty

His eyes fill with courage and he charges toward the spindly bridge that leads to his master and friends
282                                                  282 Dino dives through the hoops of bamboo, duplicating his steps in "The Dino Dance
" He reaches the other island
Without a beat, still keeping time, he puts the two kids on his shoulders, just like in the dance
Then he "presents" his tail to Fred -- Fred hands his tail to Barney -- and then -- 283                                                        283 -- Dino slides down the long wire, carrying everyone to safety
They all plow into the biggest rescue net as Wilma and Betty wind up

He's slightly stunned, still in the suit
He sits up
suddenly lights snap on all around him
Fred looks up and sees -- 285     -                           285 All with weapons aimed right at him
Spotlights on the police car roofs (actually little fires with parabolic mirrors) are operated by uniformed monkeys
Feldspar is at the head of the group
He cocks his shotgun
The elastic catapults at the hammers twitch menacingly -- It's the xenosaurus -- stand back, men -- it's a vicious killer -- Ready -- Aim -- (with desperate poignancy) High ham noght a zenosore
High ham hay hooman beeng --
Bullets and projectiles begin slamming all around Fred
He ducks behind a big fallen chunk of Fibrerock -- catches his breath as the bullets and shells bounce off its resilient surface
286    -                                                  286 Momentarily safe, he tries desperately to remove that stupid head -- bangs it against the wall, tears at it with his claws -- -- meanwhile, the chunk of Fibrerock protecting him decomposes
He's back in the line of fire

"---," he races forward,   -- and with lightning reflexes grabs the seat of Fred's monster suit and -- de-pants him
Instantly, Dino whirls Fred around, points to the now revealed striped undershorts

Hey, those are the biggest shorts 've ever seen

it must be Mister Flintstone
Cease fire

Now Fred confirms Gravel's hunch as the costume head finally pops off

Fred holds up one finger towards her
She nods, scampers Fred rubs his hands and licks his lips with antici- pation
and then the girl returns with a massive rack of ribs on a car tray
She hooks it on the edge of the driver's door

Fred and family pull up
Dino runs in first, followed by Wilma with Pebbles already asleep on her shoulder
Fred follows, the saber-tooth cat on his heels
Fred stops in the doorway to put a milk bottle on the doorstep, and then puts the cat down beside it
He shuts the door
Quick as a flash, the cat leaps through the side window
Pause
The door opens and the cat puts Fred out, then slams the door
Fred recovers from his shock, tries the door
it's locked
