Story by Harry
Chandlee and Douglas
Churchill 1 -  - General atmosphere, typical of a busy newspaper office
Copy boys running about, shirtsleeved reporters and rewrite men pounding away on typewriters
Little wire baskets containing cylinders of copy whizzing back and forth, such as are used in some department stores, etc
(Morkrum machines,[1] typewriters, telephone bells and all other sounds relative to a newspaper office) When shot has been fully established: It takes in the battery of Morkrum machines clattering away; the crescent-shaped copy desk; the desk of the sporting editor, with a big cauliflower-eared pugilist and his manager standing by the side of the sporting editor, a hefty guy in his shirtsleeves, smoking a big cigar and wearing a green eye-shade; the desk of the society editor, a prissy old lady, who takes down a worn copy of the Blue Book as the camera passes her and starts looking up some data; and any other interesting or typical bits that can be thought out
At the far end of the room is the desk of Conroy, the City Editor
Everything shows evidence of feverish activity and great haste
2 On Conroy, the City Editor at his desk, speaking on the telephone
Yeah, that's all  ever get from you guys - a lot of hard luck stories
You come back here and 'll give you an assignment
It will be a last interview - with the cashier
He hangs up, looks around with a scowl
Stew
Stew Smith
Oh Mr
Conroy, give me a crack at that Schuyler story, will you
You
If you ever got your foot into a drawing room, you'd step on a sliding rug
Stew is the only man that's got brains enough to handle this
Scram
Copy Boy rushes by on an errand
Say Spud, did you find Stew
Not yet
Well, did you look in the 4
First place  looked
Not there, eh
For cryin' out loud, where is that
Go and dig him up
Stew
Stew Smith
: Until it takes in a sort of make-shift screen, concealing a corner of the room
: 3 On the other side of the screen
Stew Smith is holding something in his hand
His hat tilted back on his head, and he is regarding this plaything intently
Gallagher is sitting close to him, also gazing intently at the plaything
Gallagher is a girl, one of the sob sisters[2] on the newspaper, dressed in a trim but inexpensive little tailored suit
Here it is
Pray for me, Gallagher
Pray for me
Hold everything
4 On the object in his hand, one of those hand-puzzles where you have to land jumping beans in the holes
5 Stew, your hands are shaking
You've been drinking again
Come on, come on
Here they come, Gallagher
Here they come
Conroy's shouts are heard in the background
(conspiratorially) The boss is getting hoarse
There's the third one
If  don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister  know that's going to get a kick right in the
oh
Whoops, almost had that
6 Conroy, the City Editor at his desk, looking about with a scowl for Stew
(bellowing) Stew
Stew Smith
The Copy Boy races over to whisper something to Conroy
5
What
The screen
7 On Stew Smith Gallagher
made it
8
( ' ) The screen, concealing the washbasin corner
,  6 wrathy Conroy, his eyes centering suspiciously on something
With his eyes on the screen, Conroy reaches out and grasps a heavy telephone book on the corner of his desk
Still looking off, he heaves it forcefully
9 Showing the screen
The telephone book crashes into it, overturning it and revealing Stew and Gallagher on the other side
They both look up, startled
The newsroom erupts in laughter
,  6 Conroy, glaring off fiercely
Come over here
10 Conroy at his desk
Stew saunters into the scene
Look,  quit
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
You're always picking on me
It took me three hours to get those little gadgets in those holes, and you screw it up in a minute
Hey, look
He gives the hand-puzzle to Conroy, who is immediately captivated by the fascinating object in his hand
11 (superior) Mmm, not as easy as it looks, is it
Conroy puts it down with a disgusted look
Aagh
No wonder you're batty
Would it be imposing too much upon you if asked you to do a little work today
Just to sort of break the monotony
6
With me you can always do business
Do you know what to do in a drawing-room
It isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts
The telephone rings, Conroy answers it
(speaking on the phone) Yeah, yeah
Okay, okay
He hangs up, turns back to Stew
Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame
Gloria Golden
Yeah, little Gloria
The human cash register
Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh
Right - for the first time this year
(modestly) Well - it's only April
Come on, get going, get going
(loftily) Get going where
can write that yarn without stepping out of the office
Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit
It wouldn't be the first time
Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid
Any of them - but get it
(resigned) All right
Give me a voucher for expenses
12
( ) What expenses
All you need is carfare to Long Island
You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is
7
know those bluenoses
Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists
So they swam over
He turns away and exits
: 13
-  - Someone pacing outside the mansion gates
14
( ) -  - guard dog pacing inside the gates
15
-  - parrot on its perch, hopping from foot to foot
16
- - Michael Schuyler, a callow youth with the usual dissipated, spoiled look
His fingers are nipping out little chunks of a folded piece of paper, dropping the bits on the floor
This is indicative of a habit of the individual in question when undergoing nervous stress
He is very fidgety and apprehensive, as he glances around
Anne Schuyler, a beautiful and aristocratic, though slightly hard girl, a few years older than Michael
Mrs
Stuyvesand Van Alstyne Schuyler, mother of Anne and Michael
grande dame, stern and glowering
Her attitude indicates suppressed nervousness and anger
She glares over in the direction of Michael
Then she turns and looks in another direction
(viciously) Dexter Grayson, if you were any kind of a lawyer, you'd get those letters back
Dexter Grayson, the family lawyer standing, his hands clasped behind his back, just completing the pacing of a few short steps in his best courtroom manner, his head bowed in an attitude of deepest thought
He is dressed in striped afternoon trousers and black coat
He turns to regard Mrs
Schuyler
But  keep telling you how difficult it is, Mrs
Schuyler
The last time asked her for those letters, she made very uncouth noises with her mouth
Anne Schuyler, trying desperately to keep from laughing
To reveal a full shot of the room and group
They are in the magnificent drawing room of the Schuyler home, resembling the Union Depot and furnished with almost imperial splendor and magnificence
They very much resemble a jury in session
As they continue: 8
don't know why you're making all this fuss
only sent her six of them
(sarcastic) If you had to make a fool of yourself, why didn't you tell it to her instead of writing
Because  couldn't get her on the phone
Imbecile
You should have known better than to write, Romeo
found that out a long time ago
should say you had
At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces
Splendid, Mother
Let's hop over to Monte Carlo
It's a great place to save a face
Oh, shut up
butler appears in the doorway
He is about to say something, but he stammers and turns
(stopping him) What is it, Smythe
Pardon me, madam - but what am  to say to the newspapermen
Mrs
Schuyler looks distractedly at Grayson
17 Mrs
Schuyler and Grayson
She rises and speaks imperiously: Dexter, go out and tell those ruffians have nothing to say
Grayson faces her placatingly
You can't do that
Leave it to me know how to handle reporters
(with a shudder) All right, then - get it over with
9
18 Grayson turns officiously toward the waiting butler
We've decided to see the reporters
Send in the man from the Tribune first
Very good, sir
Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength
know those news mongrels[3] will upset me
've anticipated it, madame
The bicarbonate is ready
The butler exits
19
-  - This room resembles the Grand Central Station
It is lined with bookcases filled with gorgeous first editions and special bindings, and is furnished in the extreme of magnificence and luxury
Present are Stew and Bingy, reporter from the Tribune
Stew is seated, idly leafing through a first edition
Bingy, still with his hat on, spots an expensive music box on a nearby table, opens it and does a little jig to the tune that is emitted
20 Bingy, as he lingers at the table
He is a lazy, sloppy-looking guy
His face needs a shave and his pants need pressing
There is a spot of dried ketchup on his tie
On the table is a humidor
Bingy opens it and lifts out a handful of cigars
21
- As he looks up from the book, he suggests: Hey Bingy, you'll find the silverware in the dining room
,  20 Bingy turns, putting the cigars in his pocket
Much obliged
22 Smythe enters
(frigidly) Mr
Grayson has decided to see you
10
Both Stew and Bingy start forward eagerly
Smythe continues: The gentleman from the Tribune, first
23 Bingy beams broadly and Stew is disappointed
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune
understand, sir
Smythe leads the way out
As Bingy passes by, Stew trips him
Say, take it easy
Take it easy
Listen, my boy
No use you hanging around here
Just buy the Tribune tonight and read all about it
You can rewrite it for your last edition
Couldn't make the last edition
It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English
Oh, is that so
'm afraid
Bingy turns to leave
Take off your hat
You might make an impression
Bingy dutifully doffs his hat
Impossible
Put it on again
Hey, make up your mind, will you
Bingy hurriedly puts his hat back on as he disappears
24
- - By the door which leads out into the hall
The butler enters and stops, standing stiffly
Bingy enters behind him, shambling awkwardly
He stops in some consternation as he sees: 25
(  ) The Schuyler jury
Grayson, Mrs
Schuyler, Anne and Michael, all surveying him in varying degrees of unfriendliness
,  24 Bingy hesitates uneasily as he regards this impressive assemblage
Quickly, he takes his hat back off
Then he smiles nervously and starts forward
Hi, folks
11
,  25 Grayson comes forward to meet him, attempting to be very cordial
Bingy is seized by a sudden impulse to sneeze
He does so, violently
There is awkward silence
Mrs
Schuyler throws off a visible shudder
What's the matter
Isn't there a 'bless you' in the crowd
You're the Tribune man
Yeah, hello
How are you
Bingy extends his hand
Grayson pointedly ignores it
(cordially) Fine
Have a seat
Thanks,  will
Bingy crosses the room, taking note of the beauteous Anne
This way
Oh, man
Bingy sits gingerly on the edge of a handsome chair
Oh, boy
26 Bingy and Grayson
Grayson picks up a very flossy and expensive cigarette box from the small end table beside the chair
It is made of gold and semi-precious stones are inset in the cover
Grayson opens the lid and takes out a cigarette, but pointedly does not offer one to Bingy
Grayson remains standing before the reporter, who is very uncomfortable and ill at ease
Fine newspaper the Tribune
Well,  should say
knew your managing editor very well
Is that so
Yale '21,  believe
12
(uncomprehending) Huh
We were classmates
27
- She clears her throat menacingly, as she looks sternly at Grayson
Ahem
What's the matter
She got a cold
,  26 Bingy and Grayson
Both look over
Grayson gives her a quick reassuring glance, as though to say "leave it to me now
" He continues his conversation with the reporter
got him his job on the paper
'm a stock-holder, you know
Is that so
As one Tribune man to another He laughs
(laughs) Yeah
But right now 'm acting in the capacity of Mrs
Schuyler's attorney
Oh, that's all right with me
won't hold it against you
But you see, 'm here to find out about know,  know
But there's no truth in the story whatsoever
Oh yeah
28 Grayson and Bingy
He takes Bingy by the arm and leads him over to a corner of the room, assuming a confidential pose
(speaking as they walk) However, 've taken the trouble to prepare a little statement
Here it is
Here
13
29 Grayson and Bingy
Grayson takes an envelope out of his pocket and hands it to Bingy
Bingy opens the flap and sees the contents
: The corner of a fifty dollar bill protrudes
: Bingy quickly shuts the envelope up
Grayson is watching him closely
So, you see how silly that rumor is
Why, sure
It's a lotta hooey
That's what  wanted to say, but  couldn't think of it
Grayson starts leading him toward the door
as Grayson leads him toward the door, talking as they walk
Thank you very much
All right, all right, don't mention it
Give my regards to your managing editor
certainly will
They stop at the door
Bingy extends a handshake, which is again refused
He stops and looks back at the jury
30 The Schuylers all sitting silently and contemplating him
Well, so long folks
He flutters his eyes at Anne
Thanks
He takes one last look at Mrs
Schuyler and is again gripped by a violent sneeze
(rising to the occasion) Uh, bless you
Bless you
Thanks
The butler appears in the doorway behind him
Bingy exits past him, beaming
14
(waving to butler) So long
Grayson nods to the butler
Smythe, bring in the other reporter
Yes, sir
31
- The group awaiting the advent of the Post reporter
Stew is shown in by the butler, still carrying the Conrad book in his hand
They give him the once-over
Mrs
Schuyler raises her lorgnette with a magnificent gesture
Stew eyes them with animation, not in the slightest discouraged by this supercilious scrutiny
He starts toward them
32 As Stew approaches them
Schuyler's the name,  presume
Yes, thank you, thank you
My name's Smith - Stewart Smith
No relation to John, Joe, Trade or Mark
Of course you can't have everything
He smiles engagingly on them
Stew addresses Mrs
Schuyler ingratiatingly, disregarding her expression of obvious distaste
Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs
Schuyler
was just glancing through this one
(indicates the book in his hand) What's Michael tearing the paper about
Just a habit
Mr
Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around
33
- Rumors
Rumors
Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor
No breach-of-promise case has been filed
The matter has been settled out of court
(very cagey) Oh  see, but Gloria doesn't seem to be satisfied with the twenty thousand dollars
34 At this, Mrs
Schuyler rises wrathfully
(furiously to Grayson) Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousandand you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel
15
Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh
and there are letters
Behind Stew's back, Grayson makes violent gestures for her to shut up
Well, well
That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it
We admit nothing
However,  have a little statement all prepared
He takes Stew's arm and walks him off toward a corner much in the same manner as he handled Bingy, and lowers his voice confidentially
35
- Apart from the others
statement
Good
have it here
Good
Grayson takes an envelope out of his pocket and hands it to Stew
Stew puts the book under his arm, takes the envelope and extracts the contents
It is another greenback
(with interest) Fifty bucks, eh
He regards it a moment, then replaces the bill in the envelope
His voice is matter-of-fact, and almost casual
Don't you know you should never offer a newspaper man more than two dollars
If you do, he'll think it's counterfeit
don't need fifty dollars
As a matter of fact, 've got fifty dollars
Grayson is considerably disconcerted
He tries again
The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly satisfied
Who, Bingy
Yeah, Bingy would
He never saw fifty dollars before
You could have bought him for six bits
Funny thing about Bingy
The more he gets - the more he prints
He looks stupid, doesn't he
But oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter
He hands the envelope back to Grayson and turns away
16
36 Schuyler group - taking his action with dismay
Stew starts walking back toward them, talking as he walks, Grayson beside him, considerably distracted
So ten grand was the amount you gave the girl
Any other statement you folks would like to make
There is an explosive chorus from the group
(ad-lib talking at the same time) That's not so
We have nothing more to say
We'll make no statements
He turns to them, holding up his hand and speaking plaintively
Wait a minute
Don't get excited wouldn't worry about it
little publicity never hurt anybody
37
- She is on the point of an apopletic stroke
She advances menacingly toward Stew
She calls to Grayson
(shrieking at him) Dexter, have this person leave immediately
38
- Stew is not at all perturbed
Dexter takes him by the arm and starts to lead him out
think you'd better go
Go
Wait a minute - that's a great story
Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from Schuyler Mansion, and Anne comes up to him
Wait a minute He faces her and cannot help but register an appreciation of her beauty
Don't mind Mother
(cheerfully) don't mind her if you don't
37 Mrs
Schuyler, almost choking in her wrath at this outrageous stranger
17
Anne
39
- Anne stifles a smile at this cheerful insolence
'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this
Decent
Why Miss Schuyler,  want to be noble
Anne continues in her most devastating manner
You're not going to print this silly thing, are you
(noncomittally) No
Why not
She puts her hand lightly on his arm
Because my name's Schuyler too
And haven't done a thing, but 'll suffer with Michael
And so will Mother
40
- He has been listening to this and enjoying it immensely
He looks over at Mrs
Schuyler
41 Who is making a show of holding back a flood of tears
40 Mother's suffering already
39 Anne, not wanting to lose her point, looks up at Stew pleadingly
As a special favor to me, you won't print that story, will you
40 Stew, looking down at her in frank approval and admiration
(pleading) Please Stew hesitates still
42 Mrs
Schuyler, Michael, and Grayson
All watching the couple intently, hanging on the next wordswondering if Anne is going to succeed
They are tense and expectant
18
43
- He is looking down into her soft, melting eyes
Then he smiles
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, 'd go for a policy in sixty seconds
Oh, thank you,  knew you'd understand
42 The three
They relax and exchange relieved and triumphant glances
Apparently Anne has won
44
- Stew turns aside
May  use your telephone
(eagerly) Certainly
Right over there
You're all right
She indicates
Stew starts for the telephone
Anne walks to her mother's side
Stew gets to the telephone and picks up the receiver
Hello, Beekman 1300
(he turns to wink at the group) That's an unlucky number
You know that, don't you
45
- At the telephone
He turns back to the instrument as he gets his connection
(into phone) Hello, Toots
Is Conroy there
Give me Conroy
(pause) He isn't
Try the washroom, will you
While he waits for the connection, he turns and addresses the group expansively
Say,  interviewed a swell guy the other day - Einstein
Swell guy, a little eccentric, but swell
Doesn't wear any garters
Neither do  as a matter of fact
What good are garters anyway
(he turns back to the phone) Hello, Conroy
This is Smith talking
'm up at the Schuylers
No, 'm not having tea - that is, not yet
(again, he winks expansively at the groupthen returns to Conroy) Is she beautiful
Oh boss, her pictures don't do her justice
If  was that guy Ziegfield - what
19
46
- Anne smiles in spite of herself at this flattery
Stew's voice goes on
' Yes, it's easy to see where her beauty comes from
From her mother
For the first time, Mrs
Schuyler unbends to the extent of giving forth a smile
She cannot help but be pleased at this compliment
The atmosphere is now very friendly
Everybody feels that everything is all right
45 Stew at the phone Now wait a minute
Just hold on
Keep your shirt on
'm coming to that
The Schuylers admit the story is true
Right
They gave the gal ten thousand bucks
But she's got some letters - and she's holding out for more dough - and it looks to me like she's going to get it
47
- Horrified and shocked at this betrayal and double-crossing
(on the phonebreezily) Right boss
'll be right over
Right - no,  don't think  can get any pictures now
Right
He casually hangs up and turns from the phone
(involuntary gasp) Oh-h-h
Anne confronts him as if he were a reptile of the lowest order
(voice cold as ice) 've met some rotters in my time, but without a doubt, you're the lowest excuse for a man 've ever had the misfortune to meet Stew starts walking toward the door, still holding his book
The family is tremendously indignant and agitated
Stew stops, turns, looks at them
He is met by icy glares
He indignantly takes a nickel out of his pocket and hands it to Grayson
(with dignity) Well, if you feel that way about it, here's a nickel for the phone call
He glares at themturns and walks out
They watch him walk out, stunned and open-mouthed

Gloria Golden, Follies Beauty, Retains Love Letters
: '  - 48 reasonably respectable speakeasy, smoke-filled
Quite a number of men and a few women are leaning on the bar and seated around at the tables
Stew and Gallagher are seated at one of the rude round tables, smoking, drinks before them
Gallagher is reading the newspaper story
49
- She is grinning at the story
and she walked up to me and put her hand on my shoulder and said, (mimicking Anne) 'Mr
Smith, You wouldn't print that story, would you
' Oh no,  wouldn't print it - read it
50
- Over Stew's shoulder
She laughs at his attempted imitation
You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on
hope not
've got to call on her this morning
Gallagher looks up in astonishment
You what
Sure,  must drop in on the mad wench
Her wounds need soothing
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats
What for
thought the story was cold
You can't go back there
Sure, the story is cold, but 'm not
'm sizzling - look
Psst
21
He moistens a finger, touches it to his wrist, and makes a sizzle noise
Gallagher looks over quizzicallya little suspiciousa little jealous
(a drawn-out knowing utterance) -o-oh
Came the dawn, came the dawn
51
- Over Gallagher's shoulder
And with it came love
Oh Gallagher, you've got to meet her
She's it and that (enthusing) and those and them
Gallagher takes a sip of her drink before answering
Well, 've seen her pictures, and don't think she's so hot
(disparaging gesture) Oh, you don't appreciate it
Her pictures don't do her justice
Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and know queens
(continues in exaltation) And oh, has she got herself a nose - and  know noses too
That little snozzle of hers is the berries,  tell you
And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens
52 Of course  haven't got a nose
Stew gives her a hurt look
(shaking his head) Sure, sure
You've got a nose, Gallagher
You've got a nose
But there's different women, Gallagher
You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds
(deliberately misunderstanding) On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her
wouldn't call her a brewery horse
Gallagher
She's the real McCoy
22
And the rest of us are truck horses
(reproachfully) There you go, talking like a woman
(a trifle resentfully) Well
Well, you're my pal, aren't you
Then don't turn female on me
During these last few speeches, Gallagher has been regarding him with a curious expression
She loves being his pal, but wishes he would realize she is also a woman
53 Stew seems a little resentful of her attitude
He rises
Pay that check, will you Gallagher
'll give it back to you some time
Maybe
He flourishes the book of Conrad, which has been lying on the table in front of him, and makes a grand gesture
go now -  go with Conrad in quest of my youth
Fry those tomatoes, will you, Gallagher
He strikes a poseand exits
Gallagher, sits, looking after him, considerably disturbed
54
- Sitting, looking dismally after Stew
She opens her bag and takes out a mirror, surveying herself with frank disapproval
She pulls out a curl of hair before each ear, tries to soften the severe brim of the hat
She puts a finger to the tip of her nose and tilts it up, studying the effect
Then, with a sigh of disgust, she throws mirror and bag onto the table
: 55
- - Smythe, the butler, previously introduced, comes from the direction of the rear of the house, and proceeds down the long, vast hallway towards the front door
The bell keeps ringing steadily
The butler reaches the wide front door
56 As the butler opens the door and reveals Stew standing outside, hatless, a book in his hand, a spring overcoat slightly askew, the pockets bulging with contents
The butler quickly tries to slam the door in Stew's face, but Stew's right foot comes forward with a practiced newspaperman's gesture and he forces his way into the room
23
(reproachfully) Now, now Jeeves
[5] Was that nice
Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves
Was it, Jeeves
Your name is Jeeves, isn't it
(stiffly) The name is Smythe
Smythe
Well, well, well
With a  , huh
(wags his head) Congratulations
What a small world
Brothers under livery
Shake
(he grabs the butler's hand) Now, as a Smith to a Smythe (glacially) Mrs
Schuyler is not at home
57
- know,  know
waited outside till she went out
She's a very nice lady, but we don't vibrate well together
58 Anne, dressed in smart sports clothes, starts to cross thru the hall
She stops as she sees the butler engaged in conversation with Stew
(hollowly) No one's at home, sir
Anne starts walking toward them
Stew spots her
Now Jeeves, what would you call this - 'no one'
Anne comes up to them
59 Anne looks up and sees that the butler is frowning and uncomfortable and addresses him
What's wrong
Mrs
Schuyler left orders, Miss, that if this person came here again,  was to call the police
That's a good idea - telephone the police
The number is Spring 3100
Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge
You may go, Smythe
24
But Now the lady said you may go The butler bows stiffly and exits
(to Stewdirectly) What do you want
Well,  tell you, yesterday when  was here,  had one of your books in my hand, and when  got outside,  realized still had your book in my hand
So as long as  had your book in my hand, thought  might as well take it home and read it
This morning,  got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand
He extends the Conrad book, and Anne, making no effort to take it, he throws it on the table
(haughty) That's considerate of you
Yeah, that was considerate of me recommend you read it
60 (stiffly) 'm not interested in your literary recommendations
Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you
Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance He takes a package of letters out of his overcoat pocket held together by a rubber band
He extracts one of them and opens it
Just listen to this (reading) Adorable Babykins Does her miss her Baby
Him sends his booful li'l sweetums a billion oceans full of kisses
Bobo is so lonely
(interrupting coldly) Just a moment
don't see how that trash could possibly concern me
Stew advances a little closer, putting up a finger
25
(mysteriously) Ah
But you don't know who Bobo is
And you don't know who Babykins is
'm not interested
Smythe will open the door
She begins to walk away
(brightly) But Bobo is your brother, Michael
And of course nobody would ever guess who Babykins is
Anne turns and stares at him, incredulously, for a moment
Where did you get those letters
stole them when  was interviewing Babykins about Bobo
Anne looks up coldly
suppose you're going to print them
No - give you another guess
61
( ) The two
Anne surveys him with frank scorn and dislike
(scornfully) Oh,  don't need another guess
It's quite obvious
So, it's obvious, huh
She turns toward the library
Will you step into the library
(with alacrity) Sure, 'll take a chance
Anne walks majestically with head held highthru the hallthru the living room and to the library This is a very long walk with Anne walking ahead, Stew trailing
(while walking with Anne single file) You know, the Indians used to walk like this
(pause) Except the squaw always walked in the back 26
(pause) You know why that was
That was in case of attack from the front
(pause) Of course, if the attack was from the rear, she had to depend upon her papoose
(pause) Oh yes, the papooses always had bows and arrows
(pause) Of course, if she wasn't marriedthen she'd have to protect her own - er, er (indicates rear with thumb over shoulder) (still walking) What country is this library in
(pause) Miss Schuyler, how about carfare back to the front door, huh
62
- Anne sweeps in, followed by Stew
She walks directly to a desk, opens a drawer and takes out a large check book
She draws up a chair and seats herself
63 Anne at the desk, starting to fill in the date on a blank check
What are your initials - Mr
- er 64
- Who has remained standing
He is watching her with a peculiar expression
Smith
Stewart Smith
My friends call me Stew
It's an injustice too because hold my liquor all right
63 Anne writes on the check
Then she looks up
Will - uh - five thousand be enough
65 For what
For the letters, of course
66 As Stew walks closer and addreses her
Gee, you shouldn't do that, Miss Schuyler
That's all right for your lawyer friend, but you shouldn't go around thinking you can buy people
(hands her the letters) They're yours
27
Anne has been listening to him with a puzzled expression, impressed by his obvious sincerity
don't know how to thank you
Mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you
Your mother will want to kiss me
Give me back my letters
(grabs the letters) That's the breaks  get
It's the mothers that are always grateful to me
(with a smile, he hands the letters back) Here
You're a peculiar person
Why the other day  pleaded with you not to send in that story and (gestures with letters) 67 (patiently again) know but that was news
This is blackmail and  don't like blackmail
Anne is regarding him with searching scrutiny
She smiles
Her icy, belligerent attitude has vanished
won't even pretend it isn't a very great favor
wish there was something could do for you Well, you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide
(he leans over closer to her) There is something you can do for me, Miss Schuyler
The smile goes out of Anne's eyesthe suspicion returnsshe is saying to herself" was right the first time
" (engagingly) haven't had any lunch yet
Have you got anything in the icebox
The hard, disdainful look leaves Anne's face as she stares at this incredible guy with his incredible request
With a twinkle in her eyes, she responds: Oh, you fool
: 68 lovely, sunny room, cretonne drapes and colorful painted furniture
Stew and Anne are sitting at the table
Anne looks amused and 28
definitely speculative
Stew has the manner of having lived in this house all his life
He draws the cup of tea to him and puts in a lump or two of sugar
Between him and Anne on the corner of the table is a modernistic, squatty little tea-pot
After years of research,  finally discovered that  was the only guy in the world who hadn't written a play, so believe it or not, in my spare time 'm now writing a play
69 Anne is casually amused
Really
Yeah,  haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you
Me
No - most ordinary guy in the world, me
Only one thing wrong with me You don't wear garters
Stew helps himself to another lump of sugar
Naw, that's just a symbol of my independence
He leans closer, looking directly into her face
'm color blind
That's what's wrong - 'm color blind
've been sitting here for a half hour looking at you and  don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet
Anne smiles at this unexpected statement, and stares at him very critically
'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to
Putty - just putty, that's me
(leaning closer) Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if  kind of got closer so  could see them
29
Not if you're going to lose any sleep about it
70 He gets closer, takes her chin in his hand and gets an eyeful
Now, how would you like themopen like this
She smiles radiantly
Close them both
(getting warm) Something tells me 'd better leave
During the last speech Mrs
Schuyler enters and stops in the doorway, surveying this astonishing scene with stupefied indignation and rage
Anne gets quickly to her feet as Mrs
Schuyler sails forward
That's an excellent idea
Oh, hello Mother
(easily) Hello - hello, Mrs
Schuyler
Come right in
Will you have a slug of tea
He hospitably indicates the table
Mrs
Schuyler is speechless with fury
She does not immediately reply
Then: What is this person doing here
Why Stew goes on
As a matter of fact,  was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes
can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet
What would you say, Mrs
Schuyler
(bursting) Why (quickly) Don't say it, Mother, please
Mr
Smith came here today to do us a great favor
71 Anne, Mrs
Schuyler and Stew
Mrs
Schuyler, with an effort, restraining her impulse to yank Stew out by the collar, speaks: 30
(bursting with wrath) Indeed
Perhaps he will do me a great favor
(elaborate bow) With pleasure, Madame
Get out of here
(distressed) Oh, Mother
(with dignity) It's all right
It's all right, Anne
can take a hint
bit subtle, but get it
It's all right
Please go
'll explain to Mother
He steps close to Mrs
Schuyler's side
The caviar was lovely, Madam
72 Stew starts to the door, smiles at Anne, and remarks to Mrs
Schuyler as he passes her: You must come over and see us sometime
Mrs
Schuyler freezes in inarticulate anger, as Stew gives a courtly bow and exits
- 73 Anne in a stunning evening dress is seated, a cocktail in one hand, cigarette in the other
Dexter Grayson, in evening clothes, is standing before her
Where were you yesterday
74
- She has a faraway, speculative look in her eyes
Oh, Stew and  went for a long ride
(dreamily) Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to
31
75
- (witheringly) Yes - Sing Sing
74 Anne
She ignores this crack
Just the same, he's going to be a different person when  get through with him
75 Grayson
He is looking at her, deeply disturbed
When you get through with him
76 Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment
(sneering) To make a gentleman out of a tramp
Exactly
Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player
You don't seem to understand that this one's different
He has brains
77 Grayson seats himself beside her on the divan
(fervently) But what about me, Anne
She looks at him coldly with almost an expression of dislike
You
Oh, don't go serious on me, Dexter
: - 78 An elaborate, modernistic roof apartment, thronged with people all in evening dress
Stew and Anne are walking down among them
Anne is radiant, and Stew is happily guiding her among the stuffed shirts
Anne stops before a group
There is the sound of conversation, laughter, clink of glasses, music from stringed invisible orchestra, etc
32
Hello, Natalie
Mr
Stewart Smith
Miss Montgomery, Mrs
Eames, Mrs
Radcliff, Mr
Radcliff How-di-do
(ad-lib acknowledgements) 79
- Standing, helping himself to a cocktail, which a footman is passing about
Dexter looks off with a frown of disapproval
80
- They are looking off in Anne's direction
Say, who's Anne's new boyfriend
Well, if these old ears don't deceive me,  believe his name is Smith
Smith
Can't be one of the brothers - he hasn't a beard on
[6] Well, he must have something if Anne has got her clutches on him
There is the sound of a piano chord being struck
81 Mrs
Baxter, the hostess, is standing importantly by the grand piano at which is seated an anaemic-looking young man
Beside her stands a stout, swarthy Italian with bristling mustachios
Mrs
Baxter bows toward the swarthy one, who bends almost double in acknowledgement
There is a polite scattering of applause, and some of the guests seat themselves
Martini starts to sing
Unnoticed by the rest, Stew and Anne slip out of the door into the roof garden
82 most beautiful, romantic spot
Rose trees in blossom, a vine-covered pergola, a splashing fountain, a few choice marble statues, low, deep chairs placed to make a gorgeous spot
Stew and Anne enter from the direction of the house
The garden is dark except for the lights from the interior of the house
From within, comes the voice of the singer rendering an extremely romantic, sentimental Italian love song
This will continue to the   of the scene
Stew and Anne walk, still hand in hand, toward the edge of the pergola where the shadows are deeper and where a couple of glorified steamer chairs are placed
There is a full moon overhead
She leads him toward a waterfall effect, a glass partition down which water trickles
They go behind the dimly lit fountain and sit 33
in a low, deep divan
We see them in silhouette as they go into a passionate embrace
All we hear is the faint voice of Martiniand the uninterrupted splashing of the fountain
: 83
-  & On divan, arms around each other
Anne, pinch me, will you
Throw me out of here
Give me the air
Throw me out of this joint, will you
Anne smiles happily and pinches his nose
Why should
We're happy, aren't we, darling
Throw me out - because 'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne
(passionately) None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me
(struggling) My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month
'm white, male and over twenty-one
've never been in jail - that is, not often
And  prefer Scotch to Bourbon
hate carrots,  hate peas,  like black coffee and  hate garters
make seventy-five bucks a week and 've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and -  don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet
(although he is very close to her) That's because you're too far away, Stew
Throughout his speech, Anne never takes her eyes off him
As he fumbles now, he turns
Their eyes meet
His overwhelming desire for Anne overcomes him
He dismisses as futile his effort to be practical, sweeps her into his arms and kisses her passionately
: - 84 Typical atmosphere, as before
: 85 Featuring Stew at his desk, which is directly in front of the battery of Morkrums whose clatter comes into the sound track
34
Stew finishes up a phone call
He sits at his desk, staring pensively at his typewriter
He is smoking a pipe and is in his shirt-sleeves
His hair is rumpled, and strewn over the desk is a bunch of crumpled up pieces of paper, indicating that he has made numerous unsuccessful starts at writing something
fresh blank sheet of paper is now in the typewriter
Nearby, at another desk, asleep in a swivel chair, with his feet elevated to the desk, the low snoring of another reporter blends with the sounds of the Morkrums and other noises of the City Room
At the reporter's elbow is a telephone
86 Desk of Conroy, the City Editor
small upright plate on his desk indicates his position
This is near the copy desk
Characteristic activities are background for any action that may take place
Reporters come up to throw their stories on Conroy's desk; the phone rings, etc
boy comes in with a large number of newspapers under his arm which he throws on Conroy's desk
There are several copies of each of the rival newspapers in town
Conroy spreads them out and begins to examine them
87
- It is evident that he is nervous and jumpy about something
Finally he starts to pound the typewriter
: Sheet of paper in typewriter on which is being typed
1 1 88
- As she talks on the phone to one of her girlfriends (sotto voce) Sure  got a new dress
new hat too
(listens) Well, 'll try to get Stew to come with me
(she glances in his direction) Yeah - he's all right
You know, he thinks he's stuck on some society gal
(listens) Naw, it won't last
It better not last
89
- Hastily glancing over the headlines of the papers
The phone rings
Without looking at it, Conroy answers: What
Oh, 'll be surprised, eh
Listen if there's any news in that sheet that haven't thrown in the wastepaper basket, 'll eat it
He is looking down at the papers and suddenly his eyes focus on something which causes the cigar to drop from his mouth and an expression of mingled amazement and rage comes into his face
We do not see at this point what it is he has read, but we know it must be something sensational
Abruptly he hangs up the phone
35
: 87 Stew, as he studies his typewriter
Over his  comes the excited outraged voice of Conroy
' Hey Stew
Stew Smith
look of infinite weariness and disgust comes over Stew's face and he grits his teeth
Me
His general expression registers "Good god, there he goes again
" With one finger he pounds out four letters: : Sheet in typewriter: Next to Stew has typed: He yanks the sheet out of the typewriter
89 Conroy
He looks over and bellows furiously
You double-crossing hound
Come over here
87 Stew gets up from his machine, crumples the sheet of paper into a wad and flings it at the sleeping reporter
The wad strikes him in the face; he wakes abruptly and automatically reaches for the phone
He picks up the receiver and in a voice fogged with sleep calls a number
Stew exits
90 At Conroy's desk
Conroy's expression is one of bitter reproach as he leans back in his swivel chair as Stew approaches and stands by the desk
Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account (interrupting fiercely) Do you call yourself a reporter
91 Of other reporters, the older man at the copy desk, and perhaps a sob sister or two nearby, who look up with expectant interest, expecting to hear Stew get a bawling out
92
- At her desk
She looks up worried and apprehensive
36
90 Stew and Conroy
It has been alleged - yes You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first
So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped
(defensively) Not on my own beat, no
(howling so that he can be heard all over the room) No
Well, where were you when that happened
He slaps the copy of the Tribune furiously and shoves it into Stew's face
93
- Not knowing what it is all about, Stew, with an injured expression, takes the paper and looks at it
: Front page of Tribune (with subheads giving more explicit information) 94 The other reporters, copy readers, sob sisters, etc
, seeing the unusual commotion and Stew's bewildered reaction, get out of their chairs and cross over to the City Desk, where they take up other copies of the same paper to look at
There are amazed and excited exclamations
95
- Stew, still staring dumbly at the paper
few others are crowding around, glancing over his shoulder, etc
've heard of people being scooped on their own funerals, but this
Holy mackerel
Why, it's news when Anne Schuyler gets her fingernails manicured, but this
She gets married to one of our own reporters and the Tribune beat us to it
(he notices other reporters milling around) Well
What do you guys want
Go on, get back to your desks
Go back to your work
(returning his attention to Stew) Now don't tell me you were drunk at the time and don't remember
Or is this one of Bingy's snow-storms
No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all
Why not
37
Well, you see, 've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea
So we were going to wait till she went to Europe
What do  care about your mother-in-law
You're still working for this paper, aren't you
Or are you
Yes, sir
Well, it's your business to get news
And here you had a story right in your own lap and you let the Tribune scoop us on it
Making a first class Grade monkey out of me
If it ever happens again - just don't bother about coming back
That's all
He dismisses Stew with a wave of his hand
Thanks for your congratulations
96 Stew turns away from Conroy's desk, and a group of his confreres come up, surrounding him in a series of ad-lib congratulations
(Some slightly profane, pounding him on the back, whooping, and in general manifesting great surprise and glee
) This group is increased by copy readers, office boys and everybody jabbering and shouting at him
(ad-lib congratulations) Stew manages to break thru them and exits from scene
97 Gallagherto intercut with above scene
She gets up and goes over, and picks up another copy of the paper and reads the headlines
98
- Her face stricken and sick as she reads about Stew's marriage
Abruptly she turns away, out of scene
99 At Gallagher's empty desk
Stew comes in trying to stave off the mob
He turns on the congratulators, pushing them off
What's the matter with you mugs
Can't a guy get married without all this
(looks around) Where's Gallagher
Anybody seen Gallagher
He forcibly breaks away from them and walks back toward the door, the last of the wisecracks and goodnatured jeers being flung after him
38
: ' 100 Gallagher is seated alone at a table, looking very forlorn
Her life is suddenly empty
drink is in front of her, untouched
She is fighting hard to keep her emotions under control
Stew enters the speakeasy and mingles with patrons, who offer congratulations
He comes to a stop by the table
She looks up, forcing a smile
Well, well, well
Gallagher, old pal
There you are
What did you run away for
didn't run away
Stew draws out the other chair at the table and sits down
101 He looks across at her, grinning boyishly, utterly unaware that what he has done has hurt her deeply
Sure, you ran away
Aren't you going to congratulate a guy
(with sincerity) Sure
wish you all the luck in the world, pal
She puts her hand tenderly on his
Thanks, thanks
hope you'll be very happy
Stew expands under the comradeship of Gallagher
He wants to talk
Oh sure, we'll be happy
What's the matter with your eyes
It's the smoke
(calling to bartender) Joe
little snifter
(returning his attention to Gallagher) Say, wasn't  a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh
(he notices the newspaper, which Gallagher has been reading) Look at that
don't know how  rate that, Gallagher
Gosh, there's a swell girl
want you to meet her
39
Who me
She wouldn't want to meet me
'm just an old load of hay
102
- As his drink is served
Ah
Thank you, Joe
(returning his attention to Gallagher) Tell you what - we'll have one of those parties down at your house - one of those spaghetti parties, you know
Gee, we haven't had one of those in a long time, have we Gallagher
103 (quietly) Not since you broke into society
(waxing reminiscent) Remember the time we had a spaghetti party, and while  was serving the spaghetti dropped it on the floor, and while those mugs weren't looking,  picked it up and served it to them anyway
Remember that
Yes, Anne would love that
104
- Looking across at him
Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates
105 Who - Anne
Sure, Anne would love that
Remember, she's a Schuyler
Now get this, Gallagher - Smith
That's the name
(murmurs) My error
Well, if she doesn't want to come, 'll come down alone
(shaking her head) Oh no, you won't, Mr
Smith
You're a married man now
Mother always warned me never to run around with married men
40
(resentfully) Say, what kind of a pal are you
You're not going to leave me flat
Gallagher tries to be elaborately casual
Oh, 'll call you up some time
And if your social duties permit - why - Cut that out
Just because 'm married - there's no reason for that
Gallagher looks up and off, seeing something that startles her
106 Conroy, the City Editor, entering the speakeasy
105 Stew and Gallagher
(interrupting in a whisper) Hey, ixnay - here's the ossbay
[7] Stew looks around, also startled
107 Stew buries his head in the newspaper, in pretense of looking for something
Conroy appears at the table and stops
He indicates Stew
What's the Benedict[8] looking for in the newspaper - his lost freedom
Stew slowly sticks his head up over the top of the table, looking up
(grinning sheepishly) Well, if it isn't old Fagin[9] himself
Conroy sits down at the table
Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story (disgustedly) Baloney
(calls off) Joe
Bring me a special
108 Gallagher tries to be very bright and smiling
(to Conroy) Isn't it swell about Stew's marriage
41
(looking straight at her) Is it
Gallagher, self-conscious, realizes this tough old buzzard is on to her
She looks back at him for a moment - then drops her head
Stew is oblivious to this by-play
Conroy turns to Stew
Well, when are you quitting
Quitting
'm not thinking about quitting
Joe comes in with a drink for Conroy
take it you don't have to work for a living any more He takes a sip of his drink and looks over meaningfully
Mr
Schuyler
(in a flash of anger) Now get this, Conroy
My name is Smith
Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith
Is that so
That's so
109
- He shows that he is genuinely interested in Stew and his problems, but can't help being a little sarcastic
Anne Schuyler's in the Blue Book - you're not even in the phone book
Think that one over, sucker
to  of
(quickly in Stew's defense) That doesn't make any difference (quietly) if they love each other
to  of
Blah
It's like a giraffe marrying a monkey
(looking off at Stew) Listen - you'll never be anything but just the reporter that married the Schuyler's millions
Stew Smith is dead and buried
From now on, you'll be just Anne Schuyler's husband
rich 42
wife's magnolia
If you can smoke that without getting sick, you're welcome to it
to  of : ' But that's perfectly ridiculous
(defensively) Wait a minute
Now, Gallagher, let me do the talking
Get this, Conroy - Anne Schuyler has got a lot of dough, all right - and  married her, all right - but her dough and me
No connection
110 Gallagher is looking fixedly at Stew - very much worried about Conroy's dismal prophecies
Conroy shakes his head in sorrowful gloom
(as if he had not heard Stew) Just a boid in a gilded cage -[10] what
You heard me
bird in a gilded cage
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids
Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr
and Mrs
Stew Smith
How do you like that
(sarcasm) And live on your salary,  suppose
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until finish writing my play
(snorts) What play
My play
The one about the Siberian bloodhound
Siberian bloodhound
No
That's been all rewritten
It's laid in Araby now
Araby
Sure
43
Araby, my eye
111 Conroy, having finished his drink, pushes back his chair and rises
He puts an affectionate hand on Stew's shoulder
Well, 'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey (starts away) Let me know when you're quitting
'm not quitting
No
No
(singing) 'For he's only a bird in a gilded cage, a beautiful sight to see' (he waves his hand) Tweet, tweet - ha, ha He laughs loud and raucously and exits
112
- Stew glares after Conroy
(under his breath) Laugh - laugh, you hyena
Gallagher realizes that Conroy has hit home with the truth and is sorry for Stew
She puts her hand over his sympathetically
Don't pay attention to him, Stew
He doesn't know what he's talking about
Pay attention
'm not paying any attention to him
You think that guy could get me upset
Hah
Not that mug
He's a tough mug - hard, cynical
He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy
(he swirls his drink, thinking) bird in a gilded cage, huh
It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia
Stew Smith, a magnolia
Not me
Say, 'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life
'll tell you that
Not me, not me
'm going to step out and mean something in this world
You watch me
(he swirls his drink, clearly bothered, lost in his own thoughts) Say, am  a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler
've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me  know it
Lucky, 'll say 'm lucky
44
(pause) Don't you think 'm lucky, Gallagher
Sure -  think so, Stew
knew you would, pal
(clearly bothered) bird in a gilded cage, eh
How is her family going to feel about it
Her family
Oh, they'll be all right
'll bring them around
(swirling his drink) Gilded cage
Besides, 'm not marrying her family
Stew Smith in a gilded cage
Stew Smith
Ha
(clearly bothered) That mug
What does he know
: - 113 Another jury scene
This time it is Anne who's on the carpet
Grayson, in correct afternoon attire, his hands behind his back and his head sunk, is pacing back and forth in a very depressed and gloomy fashion
Anne is seated, her demeanor betokening sullen defiance
Michael is pacing, nervously smoking a cigarette
don't know what you need me here for - it isn't my funeral
Mrs
Schuyler stands by a table, staring at a spreadout newspaper which is laid out on the table
She flings the newspaper aside
You stay right here, Michael
Some day you'll be head of this family, but thank heaven  shan't be here when it happens
And  hope you never have a daughter who gives you gastritis as Anne has me
She pulls the bell rope for the butler
Now Mother, calm yourself
There's no use in getting so excited
114 Mrs
Schuyler is vastly agitated
Oh, isn't there
45
(as Anne starts to get up) Sit down
(looking off) Smythe
The butler appears in the doorway
(in a weak, agonized voice) Some bicarbonate - quick
Double strength
The butler bows and exits
She passes a nervous hand over her eyes
Anne comes up to her
Mother, if you keep this up, you'll have a nervous breakdown before you go to Europe
115 Anne, Grayson and Mrs
Schuyler
It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family
can't imagine what made you do such a thing
reporter
Of all things, a reporter
barbarian who lets his socks come down
Mother,  promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer
Once  get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher (as Anne starts to get up again) Sit down
116 The butler enters with a tray on which is a glass of bicarbonate of soda and brings it to Mrs
Schuyler
Walking immediately behind the butler is Stew, airily debonair
The butler glances somewhat uneasily at Mrs
Schuyler as he presents the tray
She glares blackly at Stew without a word of greeting, and taking the foaming glass from the tray, starts to lift it to her lips
(airily) Drink hearty, Mother
Once more, Anne starts to rise out of her seat
Anne
Mrs
Schuyler pauses - glowering at Stew
Stew nods perfunctorily to each member of the jury, the total innocent
Hello, Anne
Mr
Grayson
46
(to Michael) And you
(to Mrs
Schuyler) Mrs
Schuyler
Grayson does not acknowledge the greeting
Mrs
Schuyler, having drained the glass, dismisses the butler with a wave of the hand, and directs her attention again to the matter at hand
(in command) Well, what's to be done
He's here now
They are all silent - reluctant to speak in front of Stew
Stew looks at them all - a little puzzled - then he walks over toward Mrs
Schuyler
117 Mrs
Schuyler and Stew
Nobody seems to want to do anything (to Mrs
Schuyler, brightly) Why not ask me
Perhaps  can offer a suggestion
Do what about what
(witheringly) About what
Your marriage to Anne
(with a tone of dismissal) Oh, my marriage to Anne
Now Mrs
Schuyler, we don't want you to go to any trouble about that
We just want the usual blessings, that's all
118 Mrs
Schuyler's eyes flash
She draws herself up with haughty dignity
Young man,  want you to know that object violently to this whole affair
This finally brings Anne out of her seat
She rises and crosses to Stew, making a show of embracing him
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous
It's done now
Stewart and are married
(to Mrs
Schuyler) 'm afraid she's right, Mrs
Schuyler
'm really very sorry, Mrs
Schuyler, that you feel this way
was in hopes that you would like me
'm not the burglar that you think  am
After all, we're married
think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother
(furiously) Stop calling me Mother
47
(easily) All right, Grandma (glaring) This man's impossible
can't talk to him
Grayson, let's go where we can talk - hic
(she emits a burp, then fixes a glacial look at Anne) See what you've done to me
Without another word, she turns and flounces angrily out of the room
Grayson follows her
At the doorway he pauses, starts to say something
They all look at him expectantly - but no words come out
Got it too, huh
Grayson gives a harrumph and exits
119 Anne, Michael and Stew
Michael grins at Stew
Who won that round
Michael starts moving toward the door
(ruefully) 'm afraid your mother won that round - that is, she got in the last blow
don't feel the way they do
You're really not as bad as everybody thinks
(effusively - shaking his hand) You're beginning to appreciate me, eh
Thanks
Don't worry too much about Mother - she's enjoying this
Come on upstairs, 'll give you a little - He indicates a snifter, grins and exits
Anne crosses to Stew and puts her arm around his shoulder
(to Michael) little
Sure, 'll be right up
(to Anne) He's all right
like him
'm glad
He sees two figures pass above in a proscenium alcove, first Mrs
Schuyler, then Grayson
He makes an elaborate bow to each, and is impressed by Grayson's return bow
48
He can bend
120 Anne takes a step backwards and sits down with him on one of the divans
He puts an arm about her
Come here baby
Anne starts fussing abstractedly at Stew's tie
They kiss
haven't seen you for three hours
You're neglecting me already During her speech she has been picking away at a stain on his tie
Stew looks down and notices it
What's the matter
Something  et, no doubt
Egg marks the spot You ought to get some new ties, Stewart
don't need any new ties
've got another tie - 've got another one besides this one
And it's a pip, too
There's only one thing wrong with it
You know what that is
It has a little weakness for gravy, and once in a while it leans a little toward ketchup
Of course that's only in its weaker moments
When you move down to my place, 'll show it to you
Anne is somewhat taken aback at the suggestion that she's to move into his place
Your place
121
- Yeah
Oh, it's great
Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve
(elaborate) The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids
(gently insistent) Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house When 'we'
You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house
49
Anne cuddles closer into his collar
Sure
We can have the whole left wing and be all by ourselves all the time
Stew is slightly dazed
122
- He is slightly dazed
(cynically) We could have the whole left wing
Wouldn't that be nice
Would that be room enough for us
123 (seriously - missing his sarcasm) Oh darling, of course it would
If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too,  think
Oh, Mother will give us the blue room
You haven't a red room, have you
Well, bless her heart
Wouldn't that be nice
My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room
guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she
But we don't need it, 'm sure
see, we won't need that
Plenty of room, plenty of room
124 He gets up and paces the floor
He looks at Anne and sees that she is taking him seriously
He drops down beside her
(dropping his kidding) Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you
Of course  am Stewart
125 Now let's get this settled She cuddles closer, tweaking his nose
You have the cutest nose 've 50
Never mind my nose
What kind of a chump do you think  am
You think 'm going to live here in your house - on your dough
What do you think my friends would all say
Don't be silly
'd get the razzing of my life for that
' bird in a gilded cage' - that's what 'd be
Not me
Oh no, not me
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat
It isn't cheap
It's nice
(cuddling closer) Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now Wait a minute
'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but  will not live (cuddling closer - and stroking his nose) Oh,  love that nose
It's such a sweet nose
They kiss
Nevertheless, whether the nose is sweet or not, 'm not going to live in your house
You may as well get that straight
They kiss again, longer
You do want me to be happy, don't you
Then 'm not going to live in your house They continue to kiss as
: '  - 126
- In bed, asleep, all curled up, his head on his arm
showing the magnificent bedroom, with carved wooden panellings, a raised, canopied bed
The clothes that Stew has taken off the night before are draped haphazardly about the room
When the Camera gets to a point that takes in a of the room, the door to the hall opens and a correctly attired valet appears
He closes the door noiselessly, goes over to the windows, and draws the brocaded drapes aside
Then he crosses to a covered object and with a small flourish removes the cover - revealing a birdcage
He approaches the bed
127 As Dawson the valet stops beside the bed
The valet leans over and speaks distinctly
Mr
Smith, sir There is no movement from the form on the bed
51
Mr
Smith, sir
Still no response
The valet taps the bedclothes-shrouded shoulder gently
Mr
Smith, sir Sleepily, Stew turns, his eyes heavy with sleep
128 How do you like your bath, sir
like my bath all right
How do you like your bath
Stew peers up, puzzled
Who are you
(surprised) 'm your valet, sir
Dawson is the name, sir
You're my what
Your valet, sir
Stew still stares at him
Then he nods to himself - thinks he gets the idea
Stew kicks back the covers and sits on the edge of the bed in his pajamas
Still sitting on the edge of the bed, he starts to slip his feet into a pair of slippers
The valet bends on one knee to help him
Thank you, thank you, thank you
'll do that for you some time
That's very sweet
Say listen, what did you say your name was
Dawson, sir
Dawson, huh
Was  very drunk last night
Drunk, sir
Stew rises and starts to reach for a dressing gown, but again the valet beats him to it - holding it for him and helping him slip into it
Yes
must have been pretty much plastered if  hired a valet
Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir
52
Stew, surprised, turns on him quickly
Who did engage you then, if  didn't engage you
What are you doing with my pants The valet picks up his pants
Did you take anything out of those pants
Oh no, sir
What are you doing fooling around in here
Miss Schuyler -  mean, Mrs
Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir
Stew pulls out a cigarette
The valet, without missing a beat, leans over and offers a light
wary Stew accepts
Hmmm
So Mrs
Smith engaged me a valley, huh
That's very nice of Mrs
Smith - to engage me a valley
129 Stew walks over and gets a cigarette out of a box on a small table, waving his hand in a gesture of dismissal
The valet is right behind him, holding up his bathrobe for Stew to step into
(putting on the bathrobe) Say, you are nice
You're all right
You'd make a good wife
Thank you, sir
But not for me
Though  like you well enough
You're a nice fellow
You're all right
But 'm sorry  don't need any valleys today
The valet pays no attention to him, but walks around the room, picking up the clothes that Stew has flung about
Oh, but indeed you do, sir, if you don't mind my saying so
gentleman's gentleman, as it were
Someone to draw your bath, lay out your clothes, help to dress you - it's really most essential, sir
Stew, with his cigarette between his lips, stands watching the valet as he retrieves the various articles of cast-off clothing
The valet's manner is somewhat patronizing
He walks over to a chifferobe and starts opening the drawers, preparatory to laying out fresh things for Stew
Suddenly, Stew stalks over to him, takes him by the shoulder, and yanks him around to face him
53
130
- The valet is astonished and somewhat alarmed at the belligerent expression on Stew's face
(over-sweetly) Are you trying to tell me that  need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up
Quite so
Quite
Now 'm sorry
appreciate your efforts
But  don't need anybody to help me button my pants - 've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and  can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact
Now Mr
Smith, now please Stew is rapidly losing his temper
You've got a nice face, Dawson, you wouldn't want anything to happen to your face, would you
The valet puts a bewildered hand to his face
Oh no, sir Stew releases him with a definite motion toward the door
All right, outside
(bewildered) beg your pardon, sir
(gesturing violently) Outside
The valet gazes at Stew as if he thinks the man is insane
He is considerably alarmed
think  understand, sir
You mean you want me to go
(smiling admiringly) There you are
You caught on
You see, you're nice and you're smart too
You caught on right away
Outside
Go on
Outside
And don't come back
131 The valet starts edging toward the door
54
No, sir
No
Stew's eyes bulge as he notices the birdcage for the first time
Wait a minute, what's this
: Birdcage
: That's a canary, sir
That's a canary
Who brought that in here
Canary, huh
Go on, get that out of here
Get that out of here
(frightened) Yes, sir
Very good, sir
(ranting) bird
bird in a gilded cage
Get that thing out of here
Yes sir
The valet hurries off, carrying the birdcage
As he nears the door, there is a light tap on the door connecting Stew's room and Anne's
The door opens and Anne comes in, wearing a ravishing and revealing negligee
She carries a small jeweler's box in her hand
She crosses the room toward Stew
Good morning, darling
She looks over and sees Dawson at the hall door
Oh, Dawson, see that all Mr
Smith's clothes go to the cleaners this morning, please, will you
The valet bows
Stew looks at her blankly
Very good, madame
He closes the door discreetly and goes out
132
- As they hug
Say, who is this mug
Anne sits down on the rumpled bed
55
've got a present
Shut your eyes
Keep 'em closed
know you're going to love them
(eyes closed, feeling the package) Little - couldn't be an automobile, could it
(he opens the package) Well, well
Ain't that nice
He holds them up - expensive garters
Do you like them
Got my initials on them too
They're cute
They're nice little things - what do you do with them
You wear them of course, silly
Oh no
No, no
Not me
haven't worn these things for Years
know that
Besides 'd look foolish
couldn't look Gallagher in the face
Darling,  don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters
Honey,  love you
'll eat spinach for you
'll go to the dentist twice a year for you
'll wash behind my ears for you
But  will never wear garters
His arms go about Anne
Under the force of his embrace Anne sinks back on the pillows
Stew leans forward looking down at her
133
- Nose to nose
(adopting a sing-song) Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too
(picking up her sing-song) Oh, no  won't my dear - oh, no  won't my dear - 'll wash behind my ears, but no  won't my dear
He bends to kiss her again, but she gently resists, and continues the sing-song
56
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon
Oh no, won't wear garters Oh yes you will wear garters They melt into each other's arms
: - 134 General activity, as before
until it centers on Stew at his desk, sitting low in his chair, his feet cocked up on the corner of his desk, reading a newspaper centering on his feet on the desk
One trouser leg is pulled slightly up and reveals a garter
135 Stew, reading the newspaper
It is opened up before his face
: Headlines - about a three-column article: As Stew reads this, he looks very glum and depressed
136 reporter, the one Stew had socked with a wad of paper in an earlier sequence, shambles past and stops abruptly, staring at Stew's feet
: Of what he sees
Stew's feet
The socks are strangely taut
: The reporter glances up and sees that Stew cannot see him, and then carefully lifts Stew's trouser leg a few inches
: Stew's feet and legs
As the reporter's hand lifts the trouser leg, the fancy solid-gold garters are on full display
: The reporter stares at them goggle-eyed
He can hardly contain himself at the sight of the garters
He looks off: (cautiously) Psst
137 One or two other reporters hear him and look over curiously
The reporter looks very mysterious and important and makes a motion for silence and caution
They get up and cross on tip-toe to join him
57
138 The men around Stew
They quietly gather around his feet and the reporter who made the discovery proudly displays his find
One or two more step by and all stare
Stew still has the paper up in front of his face
Is it real
2ND Of course it's real
3RD Any diamonds on them
Musta set him back at least six bits
[11] 139 Stew
(Camera behind him and shooting over his head
) He is suddenly attracted by this unusual conversation and lowers his paper, revealing the group of six or seven men in a huddle round his feet
2ND One just can't wear those and be decent
3RD Yes you can, if you belong to the Four Hundred
[12] 2ND wonder what number he is
Stew flares in anger
Several of them are bending low to get a close peek
With a violent gesture, Stew kicks his foot forward and sends a couple of them sprawling
Stew gets to his feet
Go on, get out of there
What's the matter with you mugs
Didn't you ever see a guy with a pair of garters on before
140 The two reporters who have done most of the talking scramble to their feet
The second reporter speaks in mock perplexity
What do you suppose he wears them for
2ND Can it be possible to hold his socks up
3RD Yeah, exactly
(effeminately) You know, one's hose look horribly untidy when they hang loose-like, don't you think so, percifield
Stew gets up as his phone rings
He pays no attention to it
Hank, another reporter, answers
58
4TH (same effeminacy) Yes, my dear chap - they look ghastly - they look ghastly
Go on
Screw
Get out of here
He starts out when Hank calls to him: Hey, Stew
Stew turns
(indicating phone) Your policeman
Stew comes back and, frowning, picks up the phone
141 Stew at phone
Hello
Oh hello dear
Wait just a minute (to reporters, hovering around) Come on
Beat it, will you
Screw
Screw
This is my wife
In your respective chapeaux and over your cauliflower ears
(ad-lib teasing comments as they exit scene) ' 142
- She is lying on her stomach on a rubbing table, as used by a masseuse
We see a considerable part of her back, on which a middle-aged Swedish masseuse is industriously working
Anne has the telephone in her hand
Throughout her scene, we hear very telling whacks: (into phone) But it's nearly six o'clock darling, and you know how long it takes you to dress
(pause) But the Ambassador is coming at eight, and you've got to be ready by the time he gets here
: 143 : 144 Two footmen stand at either side of a huge iron gate
Cars and limousines are arriving, dropping off guests in evening wear
145
Gallagher is just entering
Smythe holds door open for her
59
'd like to see Miss Wilson, please
Who shall  say, madam
Miss Gallagher of the Post
Yes, miss
He leaves
146 are doing a beautiful tango
Guests scattered around the room, watching interestedly
: 147 Gallagher is still waiting
Smythe enters, leading Miss Wilson, a refined-looking girl of 26 or so, her hand extended
Miss Gallagher of the Post
Oh yes - of course
Miss Gallagher
Yes
'm Miss Wilson - Mrs
Schuyler's social secretary
was sent from the Post in place of our social editor
Yes, of course
Miss Ramsey telephoned me
Well, what would you like to have
Why, a list of the guests
That's the usual thing, isn't it
Yes, of course
'll get it for you (smiling) In the meantime, would you like to take a look around
Yes, thank you
The     as they start for the Reception Room
That's a lovely dress
60
Thank you
(pause) Where is Mr
Smith
Mr
Smith
Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband
Yes
He's probably very tired
You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight
bet
You newspaper people have a lot of fun with him, don't you
What is it you call him - the Cinderella Man
: 148 Moss and Fontana are just finishing their dance
Gallagher stands in doorway with Miss Wilson, watching them
Excited voices comment on the dance
Miss Wilson beckons to Gallagher to follow her
with them as they weave in and out of crowd
Miss Wilson points out celebrated guests to her
There's the Spanish Ambassador
Gallagher steals a glance at the celebrated gentleman
You know, he looks like one
Miss Wilson laughs delightedly
At this point they are interrupted by a butler
149 Miss Wilson Yes
Mrs
Smith would like to see you
(to Gallagher) Will you excuse me
Make yourself at home for just a moment, please
Thanks
61
Miss Wilson follows butler out of scene
Gallagher is left alone
She wanders about the huge ballroom, peering here and there, searching for Stew
Finally she comes to a large open French door and steps out
150 Several groups of men and women are seated at tables
Gallagher enters from ballroom, glances quickly at all the men
Disappointed at not finding Stew, she crosses terrace and descends broad stone steps and advances into garden
151 Stew, his head cupped in his hands, is seated on a stone bench
Gallagher wanders into scene
She sees Stew and stops
Stew does not move
Gallagher, with a happy smile on her lips, moves closer to him
Stew suddenly becomes conscious of someone near him and looks suddenly up
He sees Gallagher; his face breaks into a happy grin
Mr
Smith, 've read some of your plays and 'd like an autograph
Well, well
If it isn't my old friend
Turn around, gal
Let's get a look at you
There you are
152 Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto
'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight
wanted to see some life in the raw
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh
Well gal, 'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here
Well, 'll have to look someplace else
No, no
Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts
And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck
(fixing his tie) Say, who's been tying your ties lately
It looks rotten
He suddenly realizes there's something different about Gallagher
He takes a step back so as to look her over carefully - blinks his eyes
62
Gee Gallagher, do you look good
What are you doing to yourself
Nothing
What did you do to that hair
And where did you get that dress
dyed one and washed the other
(enthusiastically) Oh, you dyed one and washed the other
Well
You certainly look good
153 Anne is walking in direction of Stew and Gallagher
She stops suddenly when she sees them
Her body stiffens
: - From Anne's angle
Gallagher is facing in the direction of Anne
Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us
Staring at us
My mistake - she's glaring
Must be my wife
He turns - sees Anne
It is my wife
Hi Anne
Don't go away
Stay right there, because 'm going to bring a friend up  want you to meet
They exit
154
- Standing as before
She is looking off with slightly narrowed eyes
Stew and Gallagher come up to her
Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life
This is Gallagher
(astounded) Gallagher
63
Sure - my pal on the paper
She's subbing for the society editor tonight
Anne turns an acid smile on the uncomfortable Gallagher
155 Oh, yes, of course
How do you do
Gallagher, this is Mrs
Smith
Anne winces slightly at this name
How do you do
There is a short, awkward pause
(bitter-sweet) You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl
Gallagher
Gallagher flashes a look at Stew - seeing that he fails to get the dynamite behind Anne's casually pleasant phrases
Anne plunges ahead
Her tone is unmistakable now
Yes
As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl
(surprised) Didn't
That's funny
Isn't it funny
(with a world of meaning) Yes - isn't it
156
- Stew is beginning to realize that all is not well as it could be
You see, we never look at Gallagher as a girl He breaks off
(with her eyes on Gallagher) No
What do you look upon her as
(fumbling for words) Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all
of She tries to back Stew up
64
(not so comfortable herself) They all consider me just as one of the boys
Right
157 (a deadly acid smile) Indeed
How interesting
(same kind of smile) Yes - isn't it
Anne takes Stew's arm, drawing him away from Gallagher
Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher
(resenting the tone of dismissal) Thank you
'll go and look for her at once
Goodbye, Mrs
Smith
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher
Goodbye, Stew She leaves scene
158
- Stew turns and faces her
That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne
After all, Gallagher is my friend
The least you can do is be courteous to her
thought  was very charming, Stewart
You did
That's a lot of hooey
'll go and apologize
He promptly walks away from her in Gallagher's direction
(furious) Stewart, please
She glares angrily at the departing Stew
159 Gallagher has just reached the ballroom when Stew catches up to her
65
'm sorry, Gallagher - really,  am sorry
(reassuringly) Oh, that's all right, Stew
Forget it
As far as she's concerned, 'm just part of the hired help
No, no
Strange, 've never seen Anne act that way before
(pause) It's funny never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it
Yes
160 The butler is just opening the door
Bingy, looking more disreputable than usual, steps inside
Hello, there, Meadows
[13] (disapproving once-over) Who is it you wish to see, sir
want to see Stew Smith
Oh excuse me -  mean Mr
Smith
Pardon me, Mr
Smith is engaged
We are having a reception here this evening Oh, a party
Great, great
Jolly times and merry pranks
That's me
'm a guy who loves parties
You know He is distracted by two elegantly-dressed ladies strolling by
a beautiful pair of shoulders
But listen now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] and tell Stew Smith  gotta see him because if you don't my whole family's going to die
'll tell Mr
Smith at once, sir
Have a seat
Well,  got a seat, but  have no place to put it
The butler turns to leave, then turns back, his face expressing distinct disapproval
Pardon me, sir, but 've heard that one before
66
161 Stew and Gallagher standing together
The butler is seen leaving the scene, having just informed Stew of Bingy's presence at the reception
(to Gallagher) Excuse me
just want to make sure and see he doesn't take away any of the vases
(starts to leave, then turns back) Well, well, well
My little pal, Gallagher, a girl, huh
(unexpectedly, he bends to kiss her hand) (tenderly) That's just to give you an idea that know how to treat a gal
Get fresh with me and 'll sock you in that little nose of yours
Excuse me
'll be right back
He exits
Gallagher is left staring at her hand wonderingly
162 Bingy gets up from his throne chair, and crosses into the doorway of the library opposite him
He stops by a carved low-boy, and curiously examines a large antique vase
Stew comes in and stops with a smile as he sees him
Bingy, his hand on the vase, looks up
Stew walks over to him
(referring to vase) What's the matter, Bingy, a little clumsy to get in your pocket
Bingy sets down the vase and surveys him
No
was just looking at it
Pretty, ain't it
was just looking for the price tag
163 Bingy looks him up and down in silent, insolent scrutiny
Stew begins to burn
What do you want
Oh, nothing
just blew over -  wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman
(sore) Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy
Oh boy, 'd love it
67
Stew makes a complete turn and faces Bingy again
How's that
(appraisingly) Not bad - not good - but not bad
You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody
Is that so
Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph
photograph
What's the matter
Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet
(singing) "Just  Gigolo
"[15] Now get this mug
You've got the kind of chin  just love to touch
And if you don't get out of here, 'm going to hang one right on it
Bingy assumes a conciliatory attitude
Take it easy
Take it easy, Dempsey
[16] Just relax, my boy, relax and open your pores
164 Stew glares at him
Bingy goes on
bring a message from Garcia
Yeah
Yeah
The boss sent me over to offer you a job
He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune
(skeptically) Yeah - go on
It's all right
You can write your own ticket
hundred and fifty bucks a week
(thinks a bit - quietly) 'll bite
What's the catch
There's no catch
This is on the up and up
Of course all you have to do is just sign the article - by Anne Schuyler's Husband
68
165 Taking in the doorway
The butler starts to pass by
Stew's eyes are blazing
Well, how does the old Cinderella man feel about that
With a quick motion, Stew clips Bingy on the jaw
Bingy, caught unawares, reels backward
166 Bingy describes a backward arc, just as Smythe, the butler, seeing he can be of service, steps forward and catches him
Well done, sir
Very neat
(through his teeth) That's what  think of it, Bingy
Bingy sags in the butler's arms
The butler looks at Stew inquiringly
Stew nods
(to butler) Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving
Yes, sir
Bingy is carried out
Stew stands glaring after them
: 167 Anne and her mother at the breakfast table
Good morning, Mother
Didn't  tell you that he'd be marvelous
Everybody thought he was so charming last night
was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something
must have acted like an idiot
(notices the morning paper in Anne's hands) What does it say about the reception last night
Oh, the usual thing
Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things
(reproachfully) Stop it
Anne
You're behaving like the person you're married to
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother
He was all right last night, wasn't he
told you not to worry about him
69
It was a miracle
The man was ill or something
She suddenly notices front page of paper Anne is reading
Her face freezes in horror
She screams
(screaming) Ah-ah-ah
Mother
(frantically gesturing at paper) Look
Look
The front page
Anne turns paper and reads the article
: : " wear the pants," says Anne Schuyler's husband
"It's Okay with me," says Anne
168 Mrs
Schuyler gets up
Paces wildly about room
In a frenzy
knew it
knew it
felt it in my bones
She is interrupted by the entrance of Grayson, who dashes into the room, his eyes ablaze
In his hand he has a copy of the morning paper
(tapping paper in hand) Did you see the papers
"Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest
" This is the most terrible kind of publicity that could possibly (interrupting) Don't you think  know it, Grayson
(as Smythe the butler enters with tray) Smith - send for Mr
Smythe
Er - Smythe, send for Mr
Smith
(as he turns to go) Double-strength
(muttering, as she exits scene) "Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest
" (close behind, contemptuously) " wear the pants," says Anne Schuyler's husband
70
- 169 Stew, now dressed in a business suit, comes from the direction of the stairs and stops just before he gets to the door of the drawing room
From within there is an ominous silence
Stew looks longingly in the direction of the front door - then back at the drawing room, squares his shoulders and goes in
170 As Stew stops just inside the doorway
He had been prepared for this, but it strikes terror into his soul, just the same
171 From his angle in the doorway
The jury - Dexter Grayson, hands behind his back - is standing, gazing at Stew with a fishy eye
Mrs
Schuyler stares haughtily
Anne is crying softly
170 Stew - looking around at the gallery of faces
Then he forces a jaunty smile to his face as he starts to enter, whistling as he goes
Good morning, everybody (he gets a cold, frigid, silent reception) Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh
(to Anne) Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you
172 Have you seen this
(shows him newspaper) Yes - the worm
beg your pardon
He's a worm - and 'm gonna step on him
To engage in a brawl
cheap, common brawl, in my own home
" wear the pants
" The pants
Not even the trousers
've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless
173
- You quit trying to stop anybody Well, at best you might deny it
71
Why deny it
The more you deny, the more they print
Let them alone
The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut
Traps shut
Certainly
'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally
(sees Anne crying) Now what are you crying about
174 Is this true, Stewart
Did you really say it
Yes,  said it
Sure,  said it
didn't say it for publication, however
And you struck him right here in our house
Yes, 'm sorry,  struck him right here in your house
And 'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man
Well, what else do you expect them to call you
Dexter
175
- (burning) That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me
'm keeping count
When you get to twenty, 'm gonna sock you right on the nose
As a matter of fact, ought to sock you right now
176 Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us
Haven't you any decency left
(defending him) Why doesn't Dexter show some decency
And you might show some too, Mother
What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names
(to Stew) 'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart
He deserved it
72
(rising) All right, all right
It's your funeral, Anne Schuyler
She flounces out
Grayson remains behind
(to Grayson) Go on, beat it, shadow
Grayson turns to go, then braves the last word
Cinderella Man
That's fifteen
He leaves in a huff
Stew puts his arms around the crying Anne
: 177 Six or eight people of distinction scattered around the room
All dressed in full evening clothes
Among them is Grayson, Anne, her mother, and one man in aviator's uniform
The men have their coats and hats in their hands, the women have their evening wraps on
Apparently they are ready to leave for someplace and are being detained
An indistinct murmur of ad-lib conversation is heard
178 On Smythe, the butler, as he approaches Mrs
Schuyler
Pardon me, madam
They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception
Are the cars ready
They've been ready for the last half hour
179
- Including Captain White, a young, handsome aviator
(modestly) hope  don't have to make any speeches tonight, Anne
Oh, you can't disappoint all the women
After all it isn't every day they get to see a famous round-the-world flier
Yes,  know, but they scare me to death
This is the fourth dinner you've taken me to this week
'm running out of material
Are you complaining
73
Yes, there are always too many other people around
Anne, it's getting late
What are we waiting for
We're waiting for my husband (lightly, concealing her irritation) If you'll excuse me, 'll run up and see what the slowpoke's doing
(to aviator) 'll be right back She starts out, climbing stairs to Stew's room
' 180 Stew stands in front of a mirror, fumbling with his dress tie
He pauses, his hands still on his tie
(reproachfully) Stewart
We're all waiting for you
Where's your valet
poisoned him
Stop trying to be funny, and get ready, will you
As he struggles with his collar, it springs off
'm not going
What are you talking about
'm talking about - 'm not going out
181
- (controlling her anger) What am  going downstairs and tell those people
Go downstairs, and tell them - anything
Tell them 'm not going
Tell them 'm not home
(getting angrier by the minute) Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going
74
182
- Yes, 'll tell you - for the same reason 've never wanted to go out with those social parasites, those sweet-smelling fashion plates
don't like them
They bore me
They give me the jitters
' Do you know you're talking about my friends
Yes, 'm talking about your friends, and they still give me the jitters
183 Well, are you going - or aren't you
Stew makes a move to embrace her
Anne, come here
Listen (sternly - slipping away from him) Look out for my lipstick, Stewart
'll tell you what
Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves (interrupting) Are you crazy
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford
How's that
Will you stop being silly, Stewart
(trying hard) 'll tell you what let's do - 'll take you and introduce you to all my gang
Would you like that
(hard) But  don't want to meet your gang
don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like
Another gang  know - you'd love them
They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things
People who are worthwhile
75
Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, suppose
Oh, they're all right, Anne
But (interrupting belligerently) That's exactly what you mean
Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough
Well, 'm sick and tired of it
've given you party after party - 've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful
No
You insult them and act like a bore
'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done
Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight
Maybe  can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do
With which violent declaration, she flounces out of the room, leaving Stew staring after her, angry and hurt
Impulsively, he follows her to the door - a retort on his lips
When he gets there, however, she has vanished
He returns to the room, wanders about thoughtfully, extracts cigarette from box, fumbles it - walks to window - stares out - turns back to room - heaves a lonely sigh
He notices his reflection in the mirror, and gestures toward it
And that, my friends, is what is known as the society belle telling ex-star-newspaper-reporter to go to - how-have-you-been, Mr
Smith
184 As Stew sits in a typewriter chair
He rolls up the sheet in the machine so that he can read what is already written
:  , 1 1 Strumming of guitars are dimly heard
: He studies it for a moment, frowning in dissatisfaction
He's stuck
He leans back in the chair and looks up for inspiration
:   , 185 Of Stew Smith pacing the grand foyer
Seen from overhead, he is dwarfed by the surroundings
He tries hopscotching on the pattern of the floor
That wears thin quickly
Supremely bored, Stew gives a shout and is rewarded with a cavernous echo
Smythe the butler then appears, nervously crouched behind some grillwork
76
186
- Did you call, sir
Smythe, come here
want to talk to you
(Smythe looks unenthusiastic
) Come on, Smythe, talk to me
Smythe, 'm going nuts
'm going nuts in this house
This big
come on, 'm not going to hurt you
Come on, what's the matter with you
Stew gives another shout and is rewarded with another loud echo
This coaxes Smythe out from behind the grillwork
Shhh
Do you hear something
Yes, sir
You try it
(reluctant) Me, sir
Yeah
Smythe gives it a timid try
No, no
Give it more volume
Smythe gives a more satisfactory yell
Stew nods approval
Smythe begins yelling and shouting in earnest
No, that's enough
just wanted you to get the idea
Now you know
This house is haunted
(incredulous) No, sir
Yes
Have you looked in the closets all over
Yes, sir
Found no skeletons
No, sir
It's haunted just the same
77
Yes, sir
Smythe has heard enough
He turns to leave, but Stew grabs him
Smythe, what do you do with yourself -  mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself
Well, sir,  putter
Smythe
mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what
just putter
Hmmm, you just putter
Do you have to have a putter to putter
Oh no, sir
putter with me hands
Well, isn't that nice
You just go right ahead and putter with your hands
That's all right
How do you do it
Well sir, 'll show you
He demonstrates, touching objects on a table and blowing dust off a lampshade
That's puttering, sir
No
Well, well, well
That's all right, if you like it
Can anybody do that
Oh no, sir
Some people are natural putterers
Others can never master it
Oh my
You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers
Yes sir
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic
To know that you could never be a putterer
Yes sir
78
How about me
Do you think if  concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day  might be a putterer
You sir
Uh-uh
You could never be a putterer
Not a good putterer, sir
Well, if  couldn't be a good putterer, wouldn't want to putter
But why
What makes you think  couldn't be a good putterer
Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease
person with a problem could never be a putterer
For instance, sir, a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place
An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy
Now sir, if you will pardon me, with all due respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith, you are an eagle in a cage
bird in a gilded cage
Yes
That's all  wanted to know
Stew rushes off upstairs
Smythe gives the echo one last try
: ' 187 As Stew makes a telephone call
Hello, Gallagher old pal
How are you, old pal
'  - 188 simple room, probably in a boarding house or cheap hotel
Gallagher is on the phone
typewriter stands nearby
Oh, hello Stew
'm pretty good, can't complain
How's our gentleman of leisure
187 Stew at phone
'm on the coast of Norway and  can't get out - will you come and get me out of the coast of Norway
188 Gallagher at phone
79
Oh, your play
Hmmm, Act One, Scene One: Coast of Norway - and then a lot of blank
Is that it
187 Stew at phone
Yeah
Come on, don't be silly
(pause) All right, if you feel like you need a chaper-one, call up Hank
Yeah
You'll find him at Joe's, no doubt
Yeah
Hank would be my idea of a perfect bodyguard
(pause) Sure you would
knew  could depend on you, old pal
Snap it up, will you, Gallagher
188 Gallagher at phone
Okay
She hangs up, joyful at the prospect of seeing Stew
She hums softly to herself as she picks up the receiver again
- 189 (bell ringing) Stew comes out of the library
Smythe is going down the hall
Stew intercepts him
Smythe, 'll get this
'm expecting some friends
Very good, sir
190 At entrance door
Stew enters and opens it
Gallagher and Hank enter
Well, Gallagher
Glad to see you
Hello, Stew
Hello, Hank
How are you
Fine, but kinda thirsty
Come right in - 'll get you a drink
Okay - you remember Joe 80
Sure
sort of invited him along to bend an elbow
You don't mind, do you
It's all right
Bring him in
Joe appears in the open doorway
Stew sees him
Come in, Joe
It's all right
Hello, Joe
Hello kid, how are you
Glad to see you
Stew starts to close the door
Just a minute - Johnson's outside
You don't mind if he comes in and dips a beak[17] do you
No, no, bring him in
The more the merrier
Come on in
Johnson appears in the open doorway
Stew sees him
Hello, Johnson
Hello, Stew, old pal
How are you
Glad to see you
Come in, kid
Stew starts to close the door
Wait a minute
got two of the boys brought along - they were cruising around with nothing to do
You don't mind if  bring them in
You brought two of the boys
That's all right
Bring them in
What's the difference
The two enter, followed in a single file by 12-14 men and women, all of whom greet Stew as they enter, ad-libbing hello's and hand-shakes
Stew stares at them dumbfoundedly
191 They swarm into the hallway and overflow into the rooms on either side
The butler stands aghast at this invasion
Stew starts to close the door when three or four more troop in, shouting cheery greetings
Stew regards them in amazement
81
192
- As he watches them file past
'm sorry nobody could come
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later
Now Hank, are you sure they're coming
It will be lonesome without them
(to Smythe) Smythe, take this crowd in there and give them a drink
And find out what the boys in the back room want
Smythe gulps nervously, as he is dragged off by the revellers
193 The gang have taken seriously Stew's suggestion that they make themselves at home
They have draped themselves about the place - a couple are strumming on the piano and others are inspecting the room in awe-struck attitudes
Smythe is being propelled around the room by the revellers
It isn't done, gentlemen
It isn't done, say
It isn't done
194
- Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you
'm sorry, Stew
asked Hank, and Hank did the rest
see
Hank brought them all
That's all right
We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out
How's that
Okay
(as Smythe passes by, being propelled by revellers) Smythe
Give them one drink and throw 'em out
(dazed) Yes, sir
82
Bingy pokes his head in the door, wearing a false beard
(spotting him) Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana
No, it's just little Bingy Baker
Stew rolls up his sleeves, preparatory to launching a punch
(warningly) Uh-uh
Bingy dons a pair of glasses, and points to them meaningfully
He enters, cautiously, watching Stew warily
(striking a pose) Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends
Big Chief very sorry
To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines
Excuse me, Gallagher
wouldn't miss this one for the world
He bends over, and Stew winds up and delivers a hard kick to his backside
Bingy straightens stiffly, then removes a bottle of alcohol from the target area
Fire water all right
(he takes a drink) Both start laughing
Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out
By golly, 'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore
You know our racket - after all, news is news
Sure, sure
That's all right
That was a great story, Bingy
great story - wish 'd printed it
gave you the breaks, didn't
That hairy chest story
(indicating Bingy's false beard) You've raised it up to the chin,  see
(laughs) Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink
Bingy emits a war-whoop and proceeds into the drawing room, where Smythe is still being held hostage by the party
83
195 Gallagher and Stew
You know what  should do with you
should sock you right in that funny little nose
Yes - and 'd love it
Sure, you'd love it
He draws her out of the entrance hall, and the     as they head upstairs, the party around them going in full force
' 196 Stew and Gallagher enter
Apparently they have been talking about Stew's play on the way upstairs
How far have you gotten
Well, 've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far
Stew gestures toward the typewriter from which a sheet of paper is protruding
Gallagher crosses to it
She rolls up the sheet so she can read what is typed on it
(reading) 'Act One - Scene One -  Street in Old Madrid' She turns as Stew walks over to her
(smiling) Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory
(grins) Haven't  covered some territory
It feels like 've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place
197 Stew, standing before her
(seriously) Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid
(grinning in spite of himself) Been where
Gallagher To Old Madrid
84
Never even been to New Madrid
Then how do you expect to write about it
Oh - draw on my imagination,  suppose
Did Conrad draw on his imagination
Stew is brought up with a start
Did who
Conrad
What do you know about Conrad
don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about
Stew is noticeably impressed with this point of view
Gosh, you look cute
Gallagher warms up to her subject
Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about
Right
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it
Right
198 Then why don't you write about something you know
Write about yourself and Anne
The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher
That's an idea there
wonder now
Oh, sure
She'd make a beautiful heroine 85
(warming up - he puts arm around Gallagher's shoulder) And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you
(smiling) What could  be
You could be something
(inspiration striking, he dashes to the typewriter) 've got an idea, Gallagher
Let's get this set
That's a great idea for a play
Pal, get me a cigarette, will you
Here you are
All right, thanks
Now, let's see
How will  start
Hey pal, how would you start
: 199 Shooting through into the drawing room
It is many hours later
The members of the party, including Smythe, are pretty well lit
On the floor of the entrance hall a dice game is in progress
In the drawing room four or five are hanging over the piano singing "The Grasshopper Jumped Over Another Grasshopper's Back
" In general, a large time is being had
As the scene opens a door-bell is ringing
key is heard in the lock
200
-  - The outer door starts to swing open
One of the party guests, very wall-eyed now, and carrying a whiskey bottle in his hand, staggers toward the door
It opens wider, and Anne and Mrs
Schuyler and Dexter Grayson stand gasping in the opening
The guest comes up to them
(starting to close door) Say, you can't come in here - this is a private party
Anne pushes the door violently, which sends the guest sprawling
He stays where he lands, holding the bottle in both arms across his chest
Anne and her mother advance into a and look off with incredulous horror and amazement
201 On a drunk Bingy as he peers at them from an alcove above
(recognizing Grayson) Hey, my old classmate from Harvard
Whoopee
Harvard, '98
(spotting Mrs
Schuyler) Hello, mama
86
202 Most are too cock-eyed or too engrossed in the ongoing crap game to notice them
know who's the cause of it all
Oh, Dexter
One of the men wanders in from the drawing room in time to hear this conversation
He assumes an attitude of exaggerated courtesy and gallantry as he bows before them
Anne and her mother are almost bursting with fury
They spot Smythe, across the room, thoroughly in his cups
(to butler) Smythe
Smythe - who are these people
Smythe comes stumbling up, a grin plastered on his face
(thoroughly plastered) Friends of mine
Very lit-lit-literary people
(confidentially, to Mrs
Schuyler) He's drunk
(aghast) Smythe, you've been drinking
(proudly) have
Double-strength
(confidentially) Very drunk
(indignant) Where is Mr
Smith
Well, for crying out loud,  don't know
And  don't care
Whoopee
He jubilantly exits scene
(confidentially) Very, very drunk
' 203 Stew gets to his feet as an idea strikes him
Now Gallagher, if we could only get a great scene - a tremendously emotional scene - some- 87
thing that would just wring the hearts out of the public - to bring the curtain down in the second act - that would be okay
Couldn't dig one out of your hat some place, could you
Nope - afraid 'm all out of tricks tonight
Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that
Very good
204 At the partially opened door into the hall
It opens wider, and Anne looks in
She stares in horrified amazement
205
(  ) Gallagher, her shoes off, sprawled out on the chaise longue, stretches luxuriously and yawns
Stew at the typewriter, hair mussed, coffee pot and cups prominent, the dressing gown over the back of his chair
Neither of them has seen Anne
204 Anne
She gasps as she quietly steps further into the room
206
- Gallagher, caught in the midst of a grand stretch, sits up abruptly, startled
She stares uncomfortably off at Anne
207
- At the typewriter
He glances up momentarily and very absently, and goes right on typing
(absently) Oh hello, Anne He types furiously
(tight-lipped) Good morning
What does this mean
Stewart looks up surprised at the tone of her voice
What does what mean
208
- Gallagher, sensing scene, starts hastily looking for her shoes
One of them has been shoved under the chaise longue and she has to get down on her hands and knees to retrieve it
Anne comes in and confronts them, her hands on her hips
Oh, that mob downstairs
guess  got so interested in the play  forgot all about them
see
88
Have we got a play, Anne
Oh, have we got a play
Of course most of it is Gallagher's
She did most of it
That brain of hers just snaps like that all the time
He indicates by snapping his fingers
Gallagher quietly gathers up her things, apprehensive of the storm about to break
(coldly) 'm not interested in the way her brain snaps
Stew stares at Anne as Gallagher, her hat in her hand, her coat over her arm, starts for the door
think  better go, Stew
think you should, Miss Gallagher
Wait a minute, Gallagher
Gallagher stops, transfixed by the new tone in his voice
He comes over to Anne
209
- What's the idea, Anne
The idea is simply this - that  want those people to leave here immediately
Now wait a minute
Aren't you being a little unreasonable
Unreasonable
Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs
Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne
There's no reason for that
Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink
That's all right
'm sorry
'll go right down and throw them out
That's no reason for you to take this attitude
After all,  certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't
(pointedly) Your house
(getting the implication; after a pause) -o-oh,  get you 89
(a knowing chuckle) All right
All right
don't blame you
kinda forgot myself for a moment, there
That's what  call getting me told, isn't it, Anne
Anne remains silent
That's exactly what she has done
suppose 've been boarding out this past year
210 He takes his coat off back of chair and slips into it
(quietly; grimly) All right, 'll tell you thisI don't like your boarding house, lady As he gathers up loose manuscript, he continues
and if it's all the same to you, 'm moving out
Stewart
(hotly) This is something  should have done a long time ago, only  didn't have sense enough to do it
No,  had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that  knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning
But no more
No more
So that's that
You can't walk out of here like this
Throughout the scene, Stew is gathering his things togetherand probably packing an overnight bag
Oh  can't
Who's going to stop me
'd like to see somebody stop me
If you think 'm going to stick around this joint just to look at this mausoleum, not on your life
You're going to make no stuffed shirt out of me
Now what do you think of that
Mrs
Schuyler stalks majestically in
What's going on here
Who is this woman
(snappily) Joan of Arc
What's it to you
Heavens
The man's insane
90
211
- Sure 'm insane, but 've got some good news for you
(points to himself) This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint
This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on
And that is what is known as telling the mother-in-law
Gallagher's cry of joy is cut off by an icy look from Mrs
Schuyler
Eurek
212 Stew is stuffing things into a bag
(heatedly to Anne) You've done nothing but watch me - watch me
- ever since 've been here
Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me
Every time  leave the house, that Jane (indicating Mrs
Schuyler) goes out and counts the silverware
That's ridiculous
Fine
don't blame her
know 'm out of my own crowd
should have had better sense in the beginning
But 'll stay in my own backyard from now on
You're acting like a child
All right, 'm a child
Have it any way you want
But 'm going back to my own apartment, where  should have lived in the first place
But no, got to listen to you and move here
All right
If you want to live with me, Anne, okay
But the sign outside will say "Mr
Stew Smith" and you'll have to be "Mrs
Stew Smith" or there's nothing doing
No more Anne Schuyler's husband He has his bag all packed by this time
He snaps it shut viciously, lifts it off the chair, picks up his hat, and notices Mrs
Schuyler staring open-mouthed at him
(to Mrs
Schuyler, pointedly) and here's some more news for you
You can take your red room, your green room, your left wing and your right wing, and you know what you can do with them
91
(to Gallagher) Come on, Gallagher
He brushes by Mrs
Schuyler and Anne, exiting
(exasperated) Oh, Stewart
- 213 Stew and Gallagher appear, coming through the iron gates
214 As Stew and Gallagher move off down the street, a ragged old panhandler comes wheedling up to them
Pardon me, could you spare a dime for a cup of coffee
Stew is struck by a sudden idea as he regards the bum intently
Coffee
How would you like to be a Knight of the Garter
(stupidly) Huh
No Stew raises one foot, then the other, and quickly removes the solid gold garters which he presses into the bum's surprised hand
(as he removes the garters) Just a minute
(to Gallagher) Entertain the gentleman, Gallagher
(to the panhandler) There you are, my man - with those you can eat for a couple of months
He walks away, leaving the bum staring dazedly at the luxurious pair of garters
(an afterthought) How about the socks
215 As Stew and Gallagher pass the Camera and go down the street, arm in arm
As they get past the Camera, Stew is seen to square his shoulders and throw out his chest
He shakes first one leg, and then the other, as if he were throwing off shackles
216 Stew and Gallagher moving along
Gallagher has a peculiar expression as she glances at Stew
She has been deeply affected by the scene she has just witnessed
Stew's face is very thoughtful
(comfortingly) wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew
She'll see it your way
92
Huh
(snapping out of it) Oh, 'm not worrying about her - 'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all
Gallagher stares at him, realizing he is thinking more about the play than his split-up with his wife
Then she breaks into a grin
Why, you're just a first-class chump
You just staged a scene that would play like a million dollars
How about that declaration of independence for the second act curtain
Stew stops stock still and stares at her
(almost reverently) That's an idea, Gallagher - a great idea
Gallagher happily links her arm in his and again they move down the street
: : " " : : On it is being typed: Act 3
Scene 1
: 217
'  -  -
Inexpensive but comfortable
Stew is in his shirtsleeves
battered old typewriter stands on the table with a sheet of blank paper in it
Stew is seated in a chair before it, and is picking out the letters, typing
He pauses, running up the roller to regard what he has written
218
'  -
Gallagher, in a little apron, is frying some ham and eggs
She looks up as she sees Stew from the doorway
Hey, Gallagher
Yeah
How about my breakfast
How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach
It'll be ready in a minute
93
(accusingly) Never mind that
If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job
(in mock contrition) Sorry, boss Don't be sorry
Just get the breakfast, that's all
219
'   -
There is a knock on the hall door
Stew crosses and opens it
220 As Stew opens the door
It reveals Dexter Grayson in the little hallway, immaculately clad, as usual
Stew regards him in frank surprise for a moment
Hello, Smith
(puzzled) Holy jumping swordfish
suppose you know why  came
No,  have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing
Now don't be absurd, Smith (as he brushes past, walking inside) May  come in
Surely, come right in
(as he sits down) Thanks
May  sit down
Surely, sit down
If  had known you were coming,  would have thrown you up a waffle
don't eat waffles
You don't
221 Grayson sits stiffly on one of the Grand Rapids chairs
Stew remains standing, and waits silently for Grayson to speak
Grayson clears his throat
94
Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce
(with enlightened expression) She did
(uncomfortably) She wants me to arrange the financial settlement
Listen Grayson, 've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank
Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because 'm spending it awfully fast
(interrupting) You don't seem to understand
Anne doesn't expect anything from you
222
'  -
Gallagher
Overcome by curiosity at the sound of voices, she leaves the frying eggs and goes quietly to the doorway and peeks out
223 Grayson and Stew
We should like to know how much you would want to Stew stares off incredulously
(interrupting) Wait a minute
Do  get from you that she wants to pay me alimony
That's putting it crudely, but Stew starts advancing nervously toward him
Grayson, a bit alarmed, rises
(closing in on him) Remember what  told you about that twentieth crack
All right, you've just made it
Before you go unconscious want you to get this through your nut
beg your pardon
Unconscious
You know, when you don't know anything
Your natural state
There are some people - you can't buy their self-respect for a bucket of shekels - well,  happen to be one of those guys
95
224 Showing kitchen door open a crack
Gallagher's eyes are glistening as she watches and listens
225 Stew and Grayson
(weakly) We just thought that (snaps) Don't think
Let me do all the thinking
Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that  didn't marry that dame for her dough and  don't want any of her dough now
was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married, so 'm giving her a divorce for a wedding present
Now, stand up
Grayson does so, completely intimidated by Stew's manner
Stew grabs him by the lapel
Yes
And now for that twentieth crack Stew punches Grayson on chin and knocks him through the open door into the hall
He slams door shut
226 Stew thrusts his hands into his pockets and walks thoughtfully back to the typewriter
227 Stew standing staring down at the typewriter
He is still flushed with anger
Suddenly a thought strikes him, and his face breaks into a broad grin
He sits down quickly, and begins pounding away
228 Gallagher enters from the kitchen, carrying a platter of ham and eggs and a coffee pot
She sets them on a small table and this is spread with a cloth
Then she crosses over to Stew
(pretending ignorance) Who was that
(without looking up from his typing) Grayson - Anne's lawyer
What did he want
Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act
They sit at the little table
96
229 What was the idea he gave you
Stew dives into the ham and eggs
It's a swell idea, Gallagher
How's this
The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce
Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out
How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh
Well, from now on the play will be easy
All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over
230
- He looks over at Gallagher with a peculiar expression
(vehemently - as he scoops out some melon) What's the matter
Do you think 'm going to let that guy go back to his wife
Not on your life
He's got to go to the other girl
231
- She almost drops her coffee cup in a wild gleam of hope as she looks back at him
Gallagher tries hard to keep her voice steady
(not sure of herself) What other girl
232 The little 'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story
(ecstatic, but still fighting) But that's ridiculous
You can't make a sudden change like that
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play
No
There's nothing sudden about that (tensely) He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her
Well, that's all right - we can fix that
He will 97
go to the little 'Brien girl, and - here, 'll show you
He gets to his feet, and comes around to her
233 Gallagher watches him a bit uncertainly
(tenderly) He goes to the little 'Brien gal and he says to her - in some pretty words of some kind - something that you can write - he'll say (as if reading part - very emotional) Darling, 'm sorry
've been a fool all my life
've always loved you, only  didn't have sense enough to see it
As quick as  can get a divorce from my wife,  want you to marry me
Then she'll look at him that way - yeah - then they'll embrace, or something like that
(they draw closer) Then he'll kiss her, or something
To demonstrate the point, Stew takes her in his arms and kisses her
They hold the kiss longer than is justified
Stew is swept away by his sudden emotion and clings to her desperately, while Gallagher's arms instinctively go around his neck
Gallagher chokes back tears that persist in coming
She stifles a sob
Stew folds her in his arms
(tenderly) What's the matter, Gallagher
What's the matter
Gallagher buries her face in his shoulders
