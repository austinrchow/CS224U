Written by Eric Stuyvesant : '   - , thirty-six, is Middle America personified
He blends in at the crowded ballpark
Blue jeans, work boots, a ball cap and leather jacket complete his attire
He snacks on a bag of popcorn
The  of the bat and the  is on their feet
slides safely into second with a double
, thirty-three, business clad, talks on his cell phone
Calm and collected he appears unaffected by the cheering crowd
The sits with the crowd
Helluva talent, that kid
John flashes a quick grin, never missing a beat in his phone call
Probably be in the bigs in another year
John nods, smiles and turns away from Rick to continue uninterrupted
: ' , twenty-four, scurries around a sparse, but neatly adorned house getting dressed
Zach
Are you ready
Mommy, can't be late again
: '  - ' , six, sits on his bed in pajamas
'm ready
Melanie
Come on baby
Don't do this to mommy
Not today
2
don't want to go
Melanie hastily dresses her son
Zach, do you want mommy to get fired
Yes
If  get fired we won't have the money to go to Six Flags
Zach quickly dresses himself
: '   - John still talks on his cell
Must be something to have that kind of talent
He's just a kid, nineteen, twenty tops, and if he stays healthy and he stays focused, the world is his oyster
Guys like you and me, we squandered those opportunities long ago
John ends his call and turns back to Rick
You
Huh
Guys like you
And me
squandered opportunities
, on the other hand, knew where  was going
had that kind of drive, just never had the talent
You knew where you were going
3
Absolutely
At nineteen
Without question
The only thing  knew for certain was that  would run to the corner store every day for beer
: - Melanie pulls into a parking space and turns the car off
Lock your door
'll be right back
Melanie opens her door
Mom
Melanie pops her head back in the car
What
'm not thirteen
It's against the law to leave me alone in a car until 'm thirteen
Come on
Zach
: '   - John's phone
He ignores the call
had priorities
understood what it meant to have an attention span
4
You could focus
was the King of Focus
The Duke of Diligence
The Count of Concentration
Rick is still looking at John when he hears the  of the bat
Duck
Huh
Rick ducks
John appears perplexed
John's :  foul ball is screaming in his direction
Too late: The ball strikes John in the face knocking him out of his seat
Rick recovers and continues to snack on his popcorn
The Polestar Prince
: Melanie carries a soda and a bag of chips
Zach stands at the cooler looking through the glass
Did you decide
want Coke
Get one
No, Pepsi
( beat) No, Seven-Up
Maybe root beer
Make up your mind already
5
So many choices
glance to her watch
: -   - The game is over
Rick and John stand at the front gate
The exiting  flows around them
John holds an ice pack to the side of his face
'm just saying grow up
You can't keep drifting
thought  did grow up
When you got married
Yeah
You matured a little
It's a process
No Bueller, it's a decision
One you need to make
You can't keep running without direction
If you don't know where you're going you'll never get what you want
: Melanie and Zach stand at the counter
The  rings them out
Zach grabs the bottle from the counter
want Sobe
Melanie snatches the bottle back
Too bad
6
An impatient    waits
don't want Coke
want Sobe
Melanie puts the bottle back on the counter
(To clerk
) We'll take the soda
Zach stomps his feet
Two dollars and
Hold on a minute
Please
Come on lady
beat as Zach and Melanie exchange glares
Get your Sobe
: -   - The crowd has waned
thought  got direction
When Cindy had kids
Yeah
They gave you purpose
But purpose, my friend, is not direction
East
Huh
7
My direction is east
parked in the deck
'm right around the
Corner
Yeah
We're always going in different directions
Mine are much more productive
And much less adventurous
Well, 'm gonna
Go
Yeah
Then go
That's what 'm going to do
Responsibility calls
John turns and heads south
Rick takes a bite of popcorn, looks to the sky for a moment, grins, and heads off Northeast
: '  - Zach takes a long swig of Sobe
Sobe sucks
want Coke
: 8
-   - John jogs up behind Rick
You want to
Get a beer
Yeah
Can't
Can't
Gotta get home
Why
Family, my man
Take time off for a ballgame ya should probably tend to the family too
You should try it sometime
In the grand scheme of things family is a liability, not an asset
Rick continues on
(Calling out
) Do you even know what you're doing or where you're going
(Yelling over his shoulder
) East
East leads nowhere, my friend
You should be heading south
The bar is south
East takes you places you don't want to go
9
Rick reaches the corner and darts across the street
: Melanie stands in front of her  (20's)
You're late
know, but
No buts
You're late
But
It's the third time this week Mel
You put me in a rough spot here
My boss wants me to let you go
His boss wants me to let you go gotta let you go
But
If a person isn't responsible enough to be prompt to their job, they're not responsible enough to work for me
But
You're fired Mel
Just get your things and go
beat as Melanie turns to leave
We still on for dinner
: - parked on Main watch Rick cross the street
10
Is that
You think
Naw
Officer's :    of Rick Stevens
Can't tell from here
Too far away
Let's roost him
Call it in
: '   - Rick walks East on Buchtel as Police cruiser creeps behind
- Officer's : Slowly driving past, the officers recognize Rick
It's him
get him, get him, get him
They curb the car in front of Rick
'   - Rick appears dumbfounded as the officers exit the cruiser with guns drawn
Officer One remains stationary
Officer Two circles behind Rick
Get em up
Up  said
up
Huh
Get `em where we can see `em slimeball
Rick raises his hands, dropping his popcorn
11
Oh, we got ourselves a litterbug here
What
Placing his pistol back in his holster Officer Two grabs Rick by the collar and throws him against the cruiser
Officer One remains drawn on Rick
His hands shake with nervous anticipation
What's going
Shaddup
Officer Two cuffs Rick
Leaning in, he speaks in Rick's ear
You know your rights, cretin, but just in case you don't
What the hell
Officer Two spins Rick to face him
You have the right to shut the hell up
Do you understand this right
Yes
Officer One appears very eager to discharge his weapon
Shut him the hell up, Jimmy
If you don't shut the hell up my partner might exercise his right to shoot you
Do you understand
`Yes' begins to form on Rick's lips
quick glance at Officer One and he decides to nod
He's looking at me funny, Jimmy
12
You have the right not to look at my partner in any way that might be construed as `funny' which could result in harm to your person
Do you understand this right
Rick nods again
He twitching
Really
don't think he is
Are you twitching boy
No Sir
Look at him, he's twitching
Nothing pisses me off more than twitching and talking
If he doesn't stop 'm gonna waste him
You have the right not to twitch or shiver or make any other odd movements that might encourage my partner to discharge his weapon, do you understand
: Melanie grabs her stuff
You never answered about tonight
You're making a huge mistake
: - An unmarked car pulls on scene
The door opens
Low in on walking feet and pan up to reveal  , (50's), a gruff man in tweed
13
What do we got here boys
It's him
We got him
He's a twitcher
a twitcher and a talker
Boy,  tell you, if he'd twitched one more time  would've deposited large amounts of hot lead in his ass
'll take it from here boys
Report too
No, that's your job
If we have to write the report say  get to shoot him
No one's getting shot today, Bobby
Can't  just wing him or something
Jimmy; get him out of here
Officer Two moves to his unwilling partner and helps him place his weapon in his holster
Officer One's hand is still clenched to his gun as Officer Two drags him around the car and forces him into the cruiser
: '  - Melanie drives
Tell me 'm not responsible
asshole
have a kid
He has a goldfish
have my dignity
( ) 14
(cont'd) He has a brown ring on his collar
He's nothing more than a turd with feet
: - Rick is restless in the back seat
Johnson glances in the rear view mirror
You don't want to piss Bobby off
He's a little unstable
little
He represents your force
Affirmative action
We have to hire our fair share of disabled --- Quota thing
His psychosis doesn't appear disabling
: - , (60's), prepares a snack
Where's Zach
Fired again
don't want to talk about it
The first thing  learned when retired was that time management is an asset
: 15
- diverse , including Rick, stand against the wall
On the other side of the mirror Detective Johnson sits with (30's)
black veil streams from her hat covering her eyes, circa 1930's
Take your time, Ma'am
We need you to be certain
Can  see their profiles
Detective Johnson keys a microphone
Turn to your left
The men follow their instruction
just
just don't know
Back to front
Three men turn to face forward
The other two turn to face the wall
All of you face forward
The two turn forward
Number three
Are you sure
Could you have him step forward
The Detective keys his microphone again
Number three take two steps forward
Rick steps forward and the lights dim on the other four
Caught in the spotlight, Rick squints from the brightness
The lady in black shifts in her seat
long beat
16
That's him
You're positive
'm positive
That's the man that needs to be in custody
The detective keys his microphone once again
Okay number three step back
Rick does as he's told
Turn to your right --- all of you
The group follows the detective's instruction
and exit
One by one the men filter through the door
Rick
: - Rick  on stage
The entire theater is cast in shades of gray
The stage is barren
There is no audience
He looks around for a moment and as he reaches center stage is once again flooded with the spotlight
Rick uses his arm to shade his eyes
:
Looking stage left Rick realizes   have appeared in their box
small has congregated
: of a gavel and Rick's attention swings to a white haired  (70's)
Order in the court
The noise level wanes, but not completely
Another  of the gavel
Order in the court,  say
Focused on the Judge, Rick doesn't notice approaching from stage right
17
Carrying a folding chair in one hand, notes and manila folders in the other, he sets the chair behind Rick
Have a seat
Do you know why you're here today, Mr
Stevens
Why am  here
Are you being rhetorical
Are you asking me
You stand here today an accused man
Accused
Accused of what
You have been placed in custody of your children
Huh
Your children, Mr
Stevens
You do realize you have children, don't you
Yes, but
But nothing Mr
Stevens, either you have children or you don't
do
So, you accept responsibility for bringing young life into the world
guess
18
There's no guessing, Mr
Stevens, either you're responsible for siring offspring or you aren't
am, but 'm not sure it was responsible
crime of passion, Mr
Stevens
How convenient
( beat) And you accept the consequences of said actions
Why am  here
Why are you here, Mr
Stevens
Why are you here
'll tell you why you're here
Are you familiar with Ms
Cynthia Stevens
Yeah, she's my wife
Was your wife, Sir
Was your wife
She recently filed for divorce
Were you aware of that
No, no  wasn't
Well, she did
She also named you as her coconspirator in the act of having children
Were you aware of that, Mr
Stevens
Again, no
Mr
Stevens, you just told the court that you aware you had children
You have also admitted that Ms
Cynthia Stevens was, in fact, your wife
( ) 19
(cont'd) On top of that you told this court that you accepted the responsibility of having said children, did you not
Yes, but
Then why, Mr
Stevens, do you continue to deny culpability in this situation
Rick realizes the audience has swelled to nearly a full house
Beads of sweat form on his brow
Answer the question
Answer the question
Like a trapped animal, Rick looks for his escape
The question, Mr
Stevens
How can you be sure it was me
The audience hisses
The Judge  his gavel
She picked you out of a lineup, Sir
What more do you need
Time
Time is not an option, Mr
Stevens
Time --- is not --- an option
look of sad resignation crosses Rick's face
You don't deny being married to Ms
Stevens, nor do you deny the act of procreation
You seem to understand that your actions bear consequence
You seem to understand that with parenthood, came responsibility
( ) 20
(cont'd) It seems to me, as it should to anyone with the capacity for simple deduction that you, Mr
Stevens, did willingly and knowingly enter into the commitments of parenthood fully aware of the potential pratfalls
Did you not
Yes, yes  did
It's time to pay the piper, Mr
Stevens
(To the Judge) It is the recommendation of the State that Richard
Stevens been sentenced to the fullest capacity allowed by law
What about Cindy
Excuse me
My ex, Cindy, what about her responsibilities to the children
The Prosecutor moves to Rick and whispers in his ear
She cut a deal, Rick
You were the one we wanted
You were the one we got
She took the plea
Sure, it costs her financially
But what is freedom worth
begins to rise from the crowd as they talk among themselves
The  of the gavel
see no reason to extend this any further
Mr
Stevens you have been found competent by the State and by this Court
You are completely cognizant of your surroundings, and you leave me no choice
This court finds you guilty as charged
Guilty of what
21
You are hereby remanded to custody of your children for no less than a lifetime
This Court is adjourned
in the audience mixed with
Rick appears dumbfounded
approaches Rick and begins to lead him off stage
Rick scuffles and struggles
The Judge stands and begins to collect his files
can't do this alone
Don't make me do this alone
'll never make it
If you can't do the time, Mr
Stevens, then don't do the crime

Nelson  the kitchen carrying a book
She hands the book to Melanie
Highly Effective Strategies of Time Management for the Single Parent

The door swings open
The children run to their father
Daddy
22
Hi guys
love you daddy
love you too, Phillip
love you more
love you more

Daddy, how come you're in jail
Is this where we live
When can we see mommy
Come here guys
want to talk to you
The boys gather round
What's wrong Daddy
don't know when we're going to see your mom again
Is she okay
She's kind of mad at daddy
Mommy mad at me too
No, baby, not at all
Your mom needs time to work through some things
So, for awhile, it's just going to be us
23
What's she need time for
To figure out who she is, where she's going, what she wants
miss mommy
She misses you too, baby
And this isn't permanent
we're going to fight this
we're going to appeal
We'll take it to the Supreme Court if we have to
You don't want us either
Of course  want you
just don't think  should have to do this alone
The jailer still lingers in the doorway, leaning against the bars
feel for you,  really do, but 've seen your kind before
You're a lifer
Whether it's fair or not
Whether justice was served
It doesn't matter
You're here for the duration
The boys cling to their father
The  of the door being closed
The Jailer  a sad spiritual as he walks away
: '  - Melanie sits on her couch and cries
Zach
What's wrong mommy
Nothing
24
Why are you crying
Did  do something wrong
Nothing at all baby
(Pulling a book from an end table) Tell me a story
The camera pulls back to reveal that the room is really a well furnished cell
Once upon a time, a very long time ago
: - Kids and toys are strewn across the floor
Rick wears a heavy shade of facial growth
He reads The Genealogy of Morals
The Jailer stands at the cell door
Get yourself cleaned up
Huh
You have visitors
in the courtyard
-  - Shaved and wearing sunglasses, Rick approaches his parents
He reaches his , (60's), first
Quite the pickle you've got yourself in
So it seems
Rick's  gives him a big hug
25
She was no good for you
knew it from the start
Mom, don't
okay
Just saying
know, but what's done is done
The children notice their grandparents and run to greet them
They tackle their grandfather's legs
There's my boys
Grandpa
Rick and his mother sit at a picnic table while the boys play with their grandfather
You're dad and  are here for you
know mom
Are you eating
Yeah,  guess
Do you need anything
Food
Money
Watch the kids one night
could use some time to myself
Um
Yeah
okay
suppose that would be all right
we'd have to ask your father, but don't see why that would be a problem
(a beat) Other than that everything's okay
26
We're okay
Because it doesn't have to be like this
Mary Ryan, a friend of mine, her son had the same thing happen to him
Wife just up and left with no warning at all
He didn't waste a day
No sir, he was up and at `em almost instantly
You can leave here, you know
Mary Ryan's son did
like it here, mom
What's to like
It's dingy and filthy
It's no place to raise children
It's home and it's stable
The one thing the boys need right now is stability
You can't keep hiding forever
It's been five days, mom
'm not hiding
just need time to adjust
Mary Ryan's son thinks you're hiding
Do  know this guy
Rick's mother slides a business card across the picnic table
No, but  think you should
hate that woman
How can a mother abandon her kids
How could she do this to my babies
Rick looks to a blue sky
: 27
- on a wad of blue cotton candy
Pull back to reveal Cindy and her new beau, , (30's) and leather clad
Danger personified
Cindy walks, focused on her cotton candy
She doesn't realize that Scott has stopped to watch a  walk past
The two exchange a flirtatious glance
Scott
Scott
(Catching up) Yeah baby
() hope she's living in hell too
: ' Melanie looks through the want ads
Some jobs are already circled
What ya doing
Looking for a job
know what you could do
What's that
You could stay home with me
What do you pay
Zach reaches deep in his pocket and pulls out a few coins
He counts them
Sixty-five cents
day

week
You can afford that
If it keeps my mommy home with me
: '  - Rick sits across the desk from  , (40): An uncouth Italian man who seems content to stuff his face with a submarine sandwich and speak through his mastication
So, needless to say,  understand your situation
My old lady, she took off and left me with the kids five years ago
That bitch
But 'm not bitter or anything
found me a good day care and moved on with my life
You should too
It's hard
Of course it's hard, sometimes feels like you're in prison, but you gotta be a man
stand up for yourself
provide for your family
And you can help
Me
'll put ya to work
Some long hours, but it all pays off
Keeps you off the welfare system if ya know what  mean
Yeah
'd rather pay you than pay the government to pay you
You can start Monday
29
Rick stands to leave
Here's the number to the day-care
Tell them you know me, they'll cut you a break
: - The clock reads 5:45 when Rick pulls into the day-care parking lot
: - Rick and the boys follow
on the guided tour
And when school starts we have a bus service that will take the two oldest to and from school
We have story hour at Eleven, lunch at noon, and nap time at Twelve- thirty
Rest assured our programs are designed to be nurturing, caring environments that provide the parental guidance your children need in those hours you can't be with them
So, are there any questions
No, you seemed to cover everything
Ms
Heath bends down to the kid's level
You're going to like it here
The kids grab Rick's leg
Nicholas cries
No, daddy, don't leave us here
Ms
Heath looks up to Rick
(Reassuringly) They'll be just fine
30
- Rick pushes a broom as the clock unwinds
: Melanie sits in front of her
'm sorry
It would be really nice to have you on board, but you're just a little too qualified
: - The children are into everything
There appears to be absolutely no rules
Rick eats his lunch
: - The children are engaged in a food fight
: Melanie sits in front of her
Too Qualified
: - Rick fumbles with his keys as he unlocks his car door
: Melanie sits in front of the
31
Over qualified
: - The children run around in their underwear, Nicholas in diapers, as the  launders their clothes
: Melanie sits in front of the
You're just not qualified

: Melanie sits in front of the
don't think 've seen such a perfect candidate
: - The provider is hurriedly scrubbing the children's faces and hands
: - - , Rick reaches the door and opens it
: 32
Melanie leans forward in her seat
Really
- The children are crying
You are bad, bad children
: - Rick approaches the room
on Rick's face : on Fifth Interviewer
Education level
Work experience
You really fit the billet
: - As Rick  the children run to him
So, did everything go okay
They were angels
Did you have fun boys
The boys look to the provider who has a nasty scowl on her face
We love it
: 33
-   - Rick loads the kids into the car
: - The boys  as they rough house in the back seat
Get those seat belts on
The kids reluctantly comply
So, how was your day
We're hungry
Didn't they feed you
They said they would feed you
The brochure said meals provided
We didn't eat nuffin
Daddy, 'm hungry
: on Melanie
She appears relieved
Unfortunately we filled the position earlier today
to cell doors slamming closed
: - Rick pulls through the drive-thru, takes his order from a smiling , and doles out the grub the as he drives off
34
- The kids aren't interested in eating
French-fries are flying everywhere
: '  - Rick stands in a doorway
Frank fingers through a file cabinet
So, how was your first week
Thirteen hours a day doesn't leave me much time for my kids, But a job's a job, right
Now you're talking
Frank finds Rick's check and smiles as he hands him his laurels
Two hundred and fifty bucks
Pretty good, huh
Two-hundred-and-fifty-bucks
Don't spend it all in one place
give you sixty-five hours of my time and you give me two hundred fifty bucks
It's the American way
This country was founded on low paying, back breaking, long hour jobs
Why, work like this makes you a bona fide patriot
Ya gotta love it
35
(Mumbling as he ) What's not to love
: - - Ready to leave, the boys goof in the hallway
In the office Rick waits patiently as Ms
Heath tallies up the weekly totals
That will be two hundred seventy- five dollars and thirty-six cents
'm a little short
Rick takes the money from his pocket and hands it to Ms
Heath
We take checks too
Checks
Those things you use when you don't have money
'm sorry, 'm clueless
My wife handled the checks
Ah
Does it help that  know Frank Ryan
He told me to mention his name
You know Frank
work for him
Ms
Heath looks back to her books
36
That changes everything
Great
Two hundred ninety-five dollars and thirty-six cents
Huh
Frank owes me money and one way or another,  will collect
So, 'm forty-five dollars short
And thirty-six cents
Don't worry about it
It's your first week
You didn't know, so, we'll let it ride and just add it to next week's balance

You know there is a way you could save quite a bit of money

Mommy
Yes, baby
When are we going to have a normal life
We do have a normal life

on flyer: Rick and Nicholas sit on the cot
Rick reads to himself
Nicholas looks at the pictures
Big boy go potty
Are you a big boy
Huge-mong-gus
: Rick and the boys are in the baby isle
Rick picks up a pack of Pull-Ups studies it for a moment and throws it in the cart
On a community bulletin board he sees a flyer for baby sitting
He pulls the flyer, folds it and stuffs it in his pocket
: - Rick sets Nicholas on the potty
38
Big boys go potty on the potty, Nicholas
Nicholas go potty on the potty
Nicky shakes his head no
You're brothers go potty on the potty
Daddy goes potty on the potty
Nicholas go potty on the potty
Nicky shakes his head again no again
(') Daddy will buy Nicky a toy from the store
Okay
If Nicky goes potty on the potty
Nicky shakes his head no and begins to cry

Nicholas has a huge grin on his face and a big toy in his hand
Rick takes the toy and tosses it in the cart
: Nicky stands in front of his father

Rick sits up abruptly
Really

All done

Three hundred forty and
Seventy-two cents
Here's two- fifty
You're still short

May  remind you that we're not a charity
If you need credit go to a bank

Phillip runs into the office crying
Blood streams down his head
Kris follows close behind
didn't do it
: Rick, Kris and Nicky sit patiently
Rick's Mother and Father through the doors
What happened
Where is he
Is he going to be okay
40
He's going to be fine
They're working on him now
From what they told me it's just a few stitches
Boys will be boys
peeks out
Mr
Stevens can you come back
The doctor could use your help in calming the child down
Mom
Just go
'll watch these two
: Phillip is in a halo
The  appears perplexed as he stands near the child
Rick
Thank God
How can  help
Well,  need to give him a local so that  can sew the laceration, but he's not cooperating
Maybe hold his hand and distract him
Rick moves to Phillip
Hi little buddy
Hi Daddy
need you to be a good boy, okay
Okay daddy
41
So, did you have fun today
Uh huh
Did you play with all your friends
Uh huh
The doc injects the child
That fuckin' hurts
Phillip
But daddy, it does
That's a big people word
You're a little people, and little people don't use big people words
Okay
(To Doctor) 'm sorry
The doctor offers a smug smile and begins to sew the cut
Do that again and my daddy's going to kick your ass
: Phillip runs down the hall with a huge butterfly bandage on his head
He stops to chat with all the
Rick walks a few steps behind carrying his coat
The doctor hurries to catch up with Rick
Look 'm really sorry
42
Can  ask you something
Rick shifts uncomfortably
Sure,  guess
My son's a wuss
He cries over hangnails
My wife and  have tried everything to toughen him up, but nothing works
was wondering if our kids could play together
Maybe some of Phillip's "boy" would rub off on Junior
: Rick stands at the counter
The boys rough house with their grandparents in the background
Insurance
Yeah, Insurance
That thing that covers medical emergencies
don't think  have any
Everybody has insurance
don't think  do
Okay
The receptionist slides a bill across the desk
From Rick's : the bill he holds shows a balance due of $637
50 Can  run a tab
43
You don't have a check
: - Rick walks with his mother
The boys and their Grandfather are a few steps ahead
'm not even responsible for myself
How am  suppose to raise three kids
It can be done
don't see how
Find a way
Everything happens for a reason
God doesn't abandon his children, and neither will you
God doesn't pay day-care
There are other things out there
less expensive ways
Could you watch them
Oh
uh
well
don't think your father is willing to do that
We raised our kids, Rick
How `bout tonight, so  can catch a breath
What
My watching them while you were in there with Phillip wasn't enough
Make me feel guilty
'll just ask God to watch them
He never abandons his children
44
Rick's mom reaches in her purse and pulls some bills from her wallet
Take this
don't want your money mom
Take the money
As Rick puts the money in his pocket he finds the flyer
: Nicky sits on the potty
can't do it Daddy
You can do it
can't do it
Would you do it for a nickel
can't do it
Rick lifts the child from the toilet
Watch daddy
Rick stands in front of the toilet and relieves himself
Nicholas watches by his side
He finishes and zips himself up
Daddy go potty in the potty
Daddy
Yes, Nicky

Rick's :  puddle on the floor
on the cell door
Rick turns around to find  (24) looking in
Hi
'm Melanie
The baby-sitter
Oh, right, 'm glad you could
My daddy has a big pee-pee
was just demonstrating the art of
It's okay
saw
(Mumbling) Great
Melanie  the cell followed by Zach
You have a kid
So do you
Not criticizing, just surprised don't believe anyone at their old day-care had kids
If they did they kept them in a closet and only brought them out on special occasions
Christmas, Easter, an occasional birthday, and maybe when they had friends over for dinner, but only as a status symbol
It was like they'd say, "Here's the white picket fence
Here's the
Here's the dog
Oh yes, here's the 2
5 children
Kids you can get back in the closet now
" 46
You'd could make a fortune with a Renta- Kid business
That has potential
've often thought of renting mine
Why pay for a baby-sitter when thousands of people would pay good money to set your kid on the mantle for a few hours
So, what's his name
'm Zach
Rick drops to a knee and extends his hand
Hello Zach
'm Rick
You're old
You got me there
am old
How old
Older than dirt
When  was a kid we didn't have dirt
We had rocks and we had hammers
If we wanted dirt we banged a few rocks with really big hammers, and then we had dirt
Worked the chain gangs
You're too old for my mom
Kris and Phillip who have been sitting in the corner realize they have visitors and spring to greet them
47
This is Kristian
This is Phillip, and the little guy from the potty, is Nicholas
Guys, this is Zach and
Mel
Mel
The four boys run  to play
Beautiful kids
Thanks
So's your's
Ever try Cheerios
Huh
For potty training
Give him something to aim at
Drop a Cheerio or two in the toilet and let him pee away
'll have to try that
So, any questions about the job
Melanie moves towards the boys
'm going to go talk to them for a little bit
'll let you know
Melanie crouches to the boy's level
They appear to take a real shine to her
Nicholas hands her a book, and the four of them move to the cell cot
The boys gather round
My mom tells great stories
We don't have a mom
That's okay,  don't have a dad
48
Once upon a time
: The cot morphs into a sofa
The dingy cell morphs into a well- lit room
Rick watches from a doorway
The end
Read it again
Read it again
Read it again
'm gonna talk to your dad
Please
We'll read another one in a little bit
You have a real knack there
Not a knack really
It's just about finding hope in places there should be none
Whatever it is, 've never seen them take to a woman like that
Melanie smiles
You want the job
'd like that
: 49
- Rick is pushing his broom when a gorgeous blond  walks past
They exchange long flirtatious looks
: Melanie is fixing the boys sandwiches
: Rick and the woman sit eating lunch
You're really funny
and kinda cute
Maybe we should
Go out sometime
'd like that
When
don't know
maybe
Tonight
: Melanie on the phone
No problem
The boys run to her as she hangs up
Who was that
That was your daddy
love daddy
50
Is he coming home
No, he's going to be late
He has a date
They all snicker
So,  guess you have to deal with me a little while longer
Yeah
Melanie chases them in circles
They fall in a pile and wrestle
: - Rick picks at his food
The woman has barely touched her plate
You're a single father
That's wonderful
So many men refuse to accept any responsibility for their kids
So, how many do you have
Um
three
That's amazing
'm sure they're just angels
: The boys jump on a bed
: - Rick appears completely devoid of the conversation
51
My sister has three
She said when the second one was born it doubled the work
She didn't realize the third would double the work load would again
And to think you do it all by yourself
Um
kinda
You're a terrific man
Did  tell you  love kids
They love me
It just comes so instinctively even though 've never had kids myself
get lots of practice with my nephews though
So, when can  meet your boys
: - ' Kris stands with arms crossed and scowling
His posse of brothers does the same
Kris : Looking up at the Woman crouching down to him and smiling
You're not my mom
Yeah
: - Rick motions for the check
You can't
: - Rick flees on foot
The Woman gives chase
: 52
Melanie tucks the boys into bed
: - Rick sits with  2
2 guy like you is so hard to find
think  love you and  think you need to love me too
: - Rick jumps into his car, locking the doors behind him
Woman tugs at the door handle as he drives away
: Melanie pours two glasses of wine
: 3'  - Rick and  3 are engaged in a deep kiss
They fumble through the door
: Melanie lights a candle on a table set for two
: 3'   - Rick and woman 3 tear off each other's clothes
: 53
Melanie finishes eating alone and blows out the candle
: 3'   - Woman 3 rests her head on Rick's shoulder
That was incredible
3 Yeah
know  haven't known you very long, but  there's something need to say
: 3'  - The woman, wrapped in sheets, runs down the street
Rick gets to the door and catches himself in the jamb
(Calling out) Was it something  said
: Melanie washes the dishes
: - Rick drives home in silence
: Melanie's asleep on the sofa
Rick kneels beside her
He lightly runs his fingers through her hair stirring her slumber
54
Did you have a good time
Yeah, it was good
kinda okay
pretty much sucked
What happened
Why can't  find a woman like you
You're trying too hard
feel bad for the boys
They don't have a "mom"
She'll always be their mother, but she'll never be their mom
Quit trying so hard
You're forcing issues that can't be forced
Relax
Everything happens when and how it's suppose to
It's about spirit and finding the will to love again, for you and the boys
Melanie sits up and puts on her shoes
You want to stay and
'm going to get
Going
Yeah
You sure
Positive
beat as they study each other's eyes
55
() Daddy,  have to potty
'll see you tomorrow
Ok
Melanie
Rick turns to tend to Nicky
He stops for a moment then heads to the kitchen for a handful of Cheerios
: Rick is on his hands and knees wiping the floor around the toilet
Nicky almost do'd it
Almost, baby boy
Almost
: -   - Rick walks against the flow of the
As if in a dream, everywhere he looks he sees Melanie
Every woman has her face
: - The lights  in rhythm to the music
Rick sits with John and his wife
Finally had to grow up
Yeah,
You've got direction
suppose
don't know if you'd call it direction, but there's a definite sense of purpose
56
Good for you
Yeah, but is it good for the kids
Do the kids have direction
: - ' Kris is in pushup position
Rick is dressed as a Gunnery Sargent
Only two kinds of people make it in this world, boy; Those that are smart and those that are strong
If you don't want to be smart and do your homework then you can be strong and do pushups
: - Rick stirs to reality
'm probably not as demanding of them as  should be
You have to instill a sense of direction at a very early age
: ' '  - ' The entire family sits eating dinner
Rick's Mother looks to Phillip
So, Phillip what do you want to be when you grow up
Phillip studies Rick for a moment
Rick nods an approval
57
Daddy says  can do three things when  grow up
And what are those
Phillip takes a deep breath
can go to college and move the hell out of his house
can join the military and move the hell out of his house, or  can get a job and
move the hell out of my house
Rick
: Rick shakes his head
Ya gotta let them be what they're going to be
No, you have to mold them early
If you don't mold them they'll grow up to be Democrats
And you do this with your kids
That's not the point, is it, Carrie
think Rick is doing a wonderful job
It's a struggle, going at it alone, but
Carrie stands
58
Excuse me, gentleman,  need to powder my nose
Carrie walks off
can't believe you
What
Whining about being single
Married men would kill to be in your situation
'm just saying it's hard
You have your sons to raise without feminine interference
Do you understand the significance of your situation
Do you understand the power in your circumstance
: Rick and the boys play baseball with an empty wrapping paper roll and a dirty sock
: - Rick takes a swig of his beer
Men, all over the world, would kill for that kind of power
: Rick and the boys head out the door with fishing poles in tow
: 59
- John isn't letting this soapbox go
You have the kids and she pays child support
and you sit here and whine about things being hard
Give me a break
It does have its advantages, suppose
: Rick and the boys sit in front of the  watching football
Rick has a beer in his hand
The boys drink root beer from beer mugs
: - John realizes the beer bottles are empty
Another
Uh
On me
Sure
John heads to the bar
Carrie approaches the table
He went to grab a couple beers
You know Rick, someday some girl is going to realize what a good man you are
Carrie,  don't even have the funds to buy my own beer
60
Love isn't about money
Love is about truth and selflessness and discovering who you are and who'll be
Someday, someone will find you
: - Melanie talks on the phone
Rick pulls her from her seat
'll call you back
Melanie fumbles the phone
beat as they look into each other's eyes
What
Rick pulls her in for a kiss
What was that for
For finding me

: '  - Frank sits at his desk
thank you for everything, but it's time to move on
Where are you going
What will you do
don't know, Frank, but 'm worth more than this
Rick places his paycheck on Frank's desk and  into the hall
The corridors  as Rick walks away
() You'll never make it without me
: Rick is strutting his way into a new job
He's dressed well
: - Rick sits at his new desk arranging a few personal
He leans far back in his chair and clasps his hands behind his head
: 62
- Melanie, Rick and the boys fly a kite on a summer's day
: Melanie, Rick and the boys are eating pizza
Tears stream down Phillip's face
Phillip, what's wrong
Well,  wanted that piece and Kris took that piece, and  really, really wanted that piece
What's so important about that piece
It's bigger
Zach grabs the pizza and stuffs it in his mouth
Phillip wails louder
Kris reaches for a pitcher of soda
tussle ensues
Easy on the drinks guys
: Arriving home Rick grabs an envelope that is taped to the door
Kris bolts through the door and heads to the bathroom
Phillip is crying again
What's wrong, Phillip
Rick opens the envelope and pulls out a note
gotta pee and Kris
We're not going to fight over the bathroom
(Calling out) ( ) 63
(cont'd) Kris, your brother has to go too
Share
Kris mopes back into the room
Phillip sticks his tongue out at Kris
The boys
What's that
Rick looks up from his reading
Huh
Oh, this
Nothing
Rick balls the note and sticks it in his coat pocket
: - Phillip and Kris stand side by side over the toilet
beat as Phillip looks at his brother
This time mine's bigger
Kris begins to cry
: - on face as Rick
Rick's : Cindy sits at a table in the back
on Rick as he approaches the table
() 'm really glad you could make it
: Rick seats himself at the visitor's window
Can't really discern who sits on which side
He picks up the phone
took off work to be here
Thank you
So, what do you want
64
want to see your boys
don't think that's a good idea
'm their mother
You forfeited that obligation, remember
That's not fair
You abandoned your kids
did not
left them in the care of their loving father
There's a difference
Is there
just want to see the boys
You think they even know who you are
'm their mother
You keep saying that
know things can never go back to the way they were before

Rick
Huh
Let's keep the attorneys out of this and settle things like civil adults
: Rick watches Melanie and the boys play
Hi guys
Daddy
The boys run to their father

This is a surprise
Leave work to spend the day with us

Someone is here to see you
Rick

Rick leads the boys out the door
From Melanie's : Looking out a window as Rick loads the boys into their mother's car

- Cindy closes the car door
Thank you
Three hours
They'll be here
Rick's : He watches Cindy back out and leave
: Melanie packs her things
Where are you going
Anywhere you're not
What about the boys
What about me
'm all about second chances, but not when  come in second place
What are you talking about
Why was she here
What was that
She's their mother
Mother
've been more of a mother than she ever was
She's their mother
Who willingly walked out of their lives
67
She's their mother
You keep saying that
You think this is easy
You think raising these boys is something want to do alone
Every day is like a prison sentence
Every thing do, every decision  make is directly affected by the boundaries of my responsibility
have three children, but  have no me
Everywhere  go people stare at me
: - Dressed as dirty paupers, Rick and the boys hold tin cups out to the
: Rick continues
They stare at me, and  know what they're thinking
: - drops a coin in ricks coffer
You poor, poor man
You poor, poor children
How unfortunate to only have your father
How terrible it must be not to know your mother
: Melanie finishes packing her suitcase
68
What about Zach
How noble of you to be the only single parent in the world
How stoic you are
so concerned with the best interests of your children
Too bad
Their best interest is walking out the door
Melanie ,  the door behind her
: - Against a burning sky, Rick waits in the drive
Cindy arrives
Her hair is strewed
The boys pile out of the car and gather round their mommy
She kneels to their level
When can we see you again
Someday
Is someday tomorrow
Someday is someday, baby
Give your Mom a hug, guys, then get in the house
The boys hug their mom and then run to the door
tear wells in Cindy's eye
'm sorry
For
thought things had changed
But
am who  am, Rick
'm not cut out to be a mommy
69
could have told you that
had to give it a shot
Rick turns to walk away
Rick's : Sees the boys looking out the door
Rick turns back around to Cindy
At whose expense
Huh, Cindy
At whose expense
Who's going to dry their tears tomorrow when they realize your never coming back
Who's going to rock them to sleep at night when they ask why mommy doesn't love them
You are, and you wouldn't have it any other way
furious : to Cindy standing in front of a door marked
She steps in
The door  behind her
: - Rick is donned in crisp business attire
He and the boys sit at the breakfast table
Is Mel coming today

Daddy
Yes Nicky

She loves you too
The clock unwinds

If you have something to say, come here and tell me

What were you doing in there
Being Daddy
Who locked the door
Wasn't me
71
did
: Rick on the sofa
The boys gathered at his feet
He has a heavy growth of facial hair
He shirt is unbuttoned
His shoes have been discarded
He stares blankly forward
The boys lay sleeping at his feet
One by one  show up and begin to remove the furnishings
An open door allows to  and disconnect
First the gas, then the telephone
on a running faucet that slows to a trickle, then a drip, then dry
Rick's Mother and Father She sits by her unresponsive son
Father lingers at a distance

She stuffs a few dollars in his pocket as the   shows up
The reception on the  turns to snow
Take care of my babies
Rick never acknowledges her
She kisses him on the forehead and

: ' '  - on Rick's mom
() You could watch the boys while he works
'm too old for that
The better side of life has passed me by
What if they fall
don't hear like used to
What if one of them was seriously hurt and  didn't hear their cry
hate that the only thing  feel competent to do is give them money
love my son and love my grandbabies, but how would  live with myself if something happened to those children
Slowly pulling up and away reveals another cell
from the electric company stands in front of Rick
Sir, you're 3 months behind on your electric bill

The  of the wind and the candle is extinguished pierces the darkness and then a
: - against the bars wakes Rick and the boys
always knew you were a lifer
: Rick sits across the desk from an
Because of their age it may take awhile
We'll start them out in foster care, but eventually they'll all be placed in loving, nurturing environments
: - The boys are loaded in a wagon and pulled away from Rick by an unrecognizable
small, hand-painted, sign that hangs from the back of the wagon reads:
From Rick's : The boys move further and further away
Kris tries to christen the wagon with plastic bottled water
From the boy's : Their waving father fades in the distance
: Rick snaps back from his daydream
They'll be together though, right
Mr
Stevens,  wish  could make that promise, but the odds of an adoptive family willing to take them all is astronomical
Rick stands
74
Come on guys we're out of here
Mr
Stevens
'm sorry,  made a mistake
: -  - Rick sits at the picnic table reading a book
The boys are off playing
Kris falls
He grabs his knee and cries
Rick drops his book and runs to the child
on duty pay no attention
Rick reaches the child
The injury appears rather serious
(Calling out
) Can  get some help here
His calls go unanswered
tear forms in his eyes
Months of frustration boil in his face
passing by kneels by Rick
Can you help me
Can you help him
don't know
What does he need
don't know
He needs a father, not a book reading baby-sitter
(In a hushed rage) can't fucking do this
Yes you can
75
The convict runs his hand over the child's leg and everything appears healed
Use your mind and your heart
It's different than it ever should have been
but different isn't wrong
But
Use what you have
There is a vein of wealth inside you just waiting to be mined
Think differently than you have ever thought before
Worker harder than you ever thought you could
Love these children like they've never been loved before
How
The answer lies within
Quit worrying about how these misguided events have torn your life apart
Quit dwelling on all of your misgivings
Look around you
You're not alone
But you, and you alone, will make the difference
: - Rick notices his cell door is unlocked
He steps into the corridor
Rick's : Walking past cells he sees people he knows
His mother and father appear very old
Melanie is at Mrs
Nelson's house
Zach clings to her leg
Carrie's angry
John talks away his phone
: Rick and the boys wait for their caseworker
pregnant and her   sit a few seats away
Her face and clothes are as dirty as her children's
Rick looks at his watch, and then at her, and then back to his watch
He slips the watch off his wrist and hands it to her
76
It's not worth a lot, maybe a few hundred bucks, but it might keep you in soap for a year
comes to Rick
Mr
Stevens,  can see you now
Rick and the Pregnant Woman lock eyes
ain't some charity case
know what you think when you look at me
You think; Look at that poor, poor woman
Look at those poor, poor children
How unfortunate it must be that they only have a mother
How terrible it must be not to know their father
Mr
Stevens
didn't mean it like that
No one ever does
Mr
Stevens
Rick and the woman continue their stare
Mr
Stevens
can see you now
'm sorry, 'm going to have to reschedule
Excuse me

Daddy, 'm hungry
Nicholas pulls his shirt up to reveal his stomach
It's very, very empty

The boys dance in excitement

And you are
Can  ask you a question
What is Phillip's favorite color
Huh
Blue
His favorite color is blue
How many teeth has Kris lost
don't know
Why
Four
Two on top and two on bottom
He got a quarter for the first one, fifty cents for the next two and he parlayed the last into an even dollar
Nicholas cries at night because he thinks the house is filled with ghosts
Kiss him once on the forehead, once on the cheek and sing The Cradle Will Rock and he'll sleep the whole night through
Kris' favorite subject is math
He loves to read and write, but he doesn't do so well in social studies
He knows how to ride a bike
Why
Because  taught him
Phillip wants to learn but he's always afraid he'll fall
Nicky just likes to Flintstone his tricycle
Phillip's favorite cartoon is Tunenami
( ) 80
(cont'd) He's afraid of the dark and cries himself to sleep at night saying his mommy doesn't love him
What's your point
'm more their mom than you'll ever be
So, why are you here with slick and not with "your" kids
beat
Things change
Yeah
yeah they do
Now if you'll excuse me  need to find the asparagus

Melanie turns back around
Do what
always thought  wanted to be a parent, and  was really good at being pregnant, but  sucked as a mom
know that now
don't have what it takes
don't think 've ever felt as much pity for anyone as  do for you right now
Take care of my boys

There appears to be no permanent trail
Looking up, scattered  sit at different levels on the climb
Well, guys,  guess this is it
We can do it daddy
Yes we can
Rick stretches out
The boys jog in place
Rick cracks his neck
The boys crack their knuckles
In   they begin their ascent, running wildly up the incline

Kris points up
Look daddy
: Rick is looking through college literature, insurance applications, and  programs
: - Rick holds a college pamphlet
Rick's : He looks at the pamphlet then up to see they aren't even close to the top
They have just reached a plateau along the way
We can do it
(Through a weary voice
) Yes we can

The breaths are heavy, but they march steadily upward

Kris mimics his father, backing up to have a look for himself
Kris
Too late, Kris has tripped over a can of paint
As he sits on his butt a look of fear crosses his face, a tear forms in his eye
Rick takes his paintbrush and dots Kris on the nose
Hey
Phillip and Nicholas are quickly engaged in painting each other and a full-blown paint war ensues

So, what's your point
No point, just an observation
Drink
The climber holds out a canteen
'm okay
For the boys
Daddy, 'm thirsty
Rick studies the climber for a moment
Go ahead
The climber hands the boys the canteen
You know, if you stop here, halfway between a long way up and a long way down you really haven't accomplished much, have you
We're not stopping
We're just resting
That's what  said, fourteen years ago
Rick looks toward the top
We can do this
Yes you can
reinvigorated Rick hops to his feet
We can do this
Yes we can
: 86
Rick is back on the stage
The audience is full
What is so important Mr
Stevens that you would burden this court with convening today
just needed clarification
On what, Mr
Stevens
On what
know if  have to,  can do this alone, but do  have to do this alone
hushed  rises in the audience
The Judge  his gavel on the bench
Order in this court
beat as things quiet down
(') Your inquiry, Mr
Stevens
Is it in the best interest of the children or in the best interest of you
don't know
He doesn't know
He just doesn't know
don't know
Then this court sees no reason to amend the original verdict
The order stands
But
Tell it to someone who cares, Mr
Stevens
87
have
have laid my heart out on the line time and time again, only to walk away empty handed
This love, this caring, this sharing of life, it's a sentence and my heart has been condemned
It doesn't matter who 've told, what's in my heart is never quite enough
The people  have cared for most have shunned me in life and in love
Unanswered phone calls
Unnoticed displays of affection
rose that withers on the doorstep
No matter what  do, it's never enough
Just once, just one fucking time,  want to be enough
Your only condemnation is self- pity
You have people that care all around you, but you're too blind to see them
If you don't pull yourself together soon, my friend, they soon will all be gone
: - In & -: Rick stands watching his sons play
The wind blows the leaves of a tree
The boys run further and further out until they are out of sight
Rick calls out to them
Slowly, across the field, three young adults return
Rick is now an old man, hunched over and aged with wrinkles
The three young men walk beside their elderly father, supporting him with each step
: '  - Rick is holding flowers
The boys have an assortment of "instruments" to add a serenade
The music is a mishmash of odd notes that could only be construed as music to a parent's ear
Melanie stands on the front porch, her arms crossed
What do you want
'm a proud man, sometimes foolish
88
Go on
have a long way to go before could ever be the man you need me to be
And
And  got confused between what should have done and what  thought was right
Yes you did
put you on a pedestal and then knocked you down
It wasn't fair
Life's not fair Rick
You were more a mother to my boys than they have ever known
You were more a woman to me than  have ever deserved
You're right
You're not going to make this easy, are you
Cut the bullshit, Rick
Rick wraps his arms around Melanie and pulls her in for a hug
(In Mel's ear) can live my life alone
can raise my kids alone
can walk this path alone
'd much rather do it with you
89
Grabbing him by the collar she's torn
Melanie shakes her head
can't
She turns to go inside
Can't
(Turning back around
) won't
shouldn't have come here
No, you shouldn't have
Rick turns to leave
You just don't get it do you
Get what
You're here for you, you selfish prick
: '  -  - Melanie lays in bed covering her ears
() Days go by when  lose me
There are nights when  lay in bed and can hear Zach through the walls
He's crying out for me, and  lay there motionless, wishing  was anyone but me, anywhere but here, thinking that somewhere, sometime, there has to be room for me
But that someday never seems to come
You're dangerous
Loving you means lose me
And  will never lose let that happen
( ) 90
() (cont'd) So, don't come knocking on my door, asking for my heart, if you don't have room for me
Melanie  the house closing the door behind her
Rick tosses the flowers on the porch, turns and walks away
The boys follow behind
could have looked sad
can look sad too
But  look sadder
sad
Nicholas starts to cry
: - Rick falls flat on his face
He lays there motionless
Don't quit, daddy
Rick pounds the ground, pulls himself up, dusts himself off and with a determined look starts back up the hill
Daddy doesn't quit
: Rick and John sit at the bar
You love her
think so
don't know
If you think you're in love you are
91
suppose  am
Does your heart skip a beat when she walks by
She's my best friend
or was
Does your heart skip a beat when she walks by
Yes
Do your palms sweat when you think about her
Yes
Does she inspire you
With music and poetry
And is there passion
There's fire
And have you ever told her this
She knows
Have you ever told her this
No
Don't you think you should
It only confuses things
92
Loving your best friend confuses things
can't think of a love more lucid
Rick stands to leave
You know 'll never forgive you for this, don't you
You had the power and the dream at your fingertips and you're giving it all away
You didn't marry your best friend
No
thought you had things all planned out
Affairs of the heart and those of the mind are two different things
It's not too late, you know
With a shrug John drops to one knee in front of Rick
Go Home, John
Go home and talk to your best friend the way you talk to me
' Rick  through the front door
His mother appears aghast
need you to watch the boys
But you're father
Rick's Father
Woman, enough
But
93
No more excuses
It's time to live life and enjoy our grandkids
(To Rick) Go
The boys will be fine
Can't we just give him money to pay for a baby-sitter
Rick  out of the house
: Melanie is working as a waitress
She's pouring coffee when she sees Rick
(To herself) Oh shit
Whoa
The cup has nearly reached the brim
Sorry
Pay attention, would ya
Rick reaches her
What do you want
To talk
'm working
know
Melanie is at the next customer who early awaits a refill, but she doesn't pour
So, where are the boys
94
They're at my parents
What
Not going to use them to try to persuade me with guilt
Is that what you thought
have a son of my own
know when people are using their kids
2 Ma'am
(To Customer 2) Excuse us for a moment okay
2 'd just like some coffee
Melanie walks off
Rick grabs a cup from a recently vacated table and sets it in front of the patron
2 (Calling out
) Excuse me, Miss
What is your problem
2 Cold
What
2 The coffee, it's cold
Rick picks up the cup, pulls a lighter from his pocket and runs it several times under the mug
(Setting the cup back down
) Quit your bitching
Rick moves to Melanie
95
can't believe you came here
can't believe you're a waitress
Beats chasing around after snot nosed brats all day
thought you liked my kids
was talking about you
Melanie moves on
Rick gives chase
He catches her and spins her around spilling coffee all over the floor
deserved that
So, what do the kids need babysitter
surrogate mom
This isn't about the kids
Then what's it about
It's about me, the selfish prick
About you
Hear me out, okay
(Looking at her watch
) You have 15 seconds
Okay, okay
Ten
96
Melanie, there is a grace about you that reminds me how clumsy  am
There is an honesty about you that reminds me how deceitful  can be
There is a beauty in your eyes that reminds me how ugly 've become
There is a kindness in your voice that contradicts my coarseness
There is a glow around you that illuminates my dullness
There is spirit in you that challenges my laziness, but most of all, there is a woman in you, that sparks my desire, a desire to be graceful and honest and beautiful and kind desire to be better than  am or ever thought  could be
Go on
think my ten seconds are up
Who's counting
2 Miss
My coffee
Melanie sets the coffee on a nearby table
Get it yourself
love you
don't think  heard you
If  give you my heart will you promise to treat it softly
Kiss it when it hurts
Put it in a box and know that it belongs to you
That's not what you said
said  love you
97
As brutal as that can be
love you
love you,  love you, love you
kind of like you too
: - Rick comes to another plateau and finds Melanie waiting for him
never thought you'd make it
Been waiting long
never thought you'd find me
had to find me first
hope you plan on walking, cause 'm not sure can carry you
So, how do we do this
The two begin the ascent together
One step at a time
Side by side
Maybe you could carry me
Rick jumps in Melanie's arms
They tumble to the ground under his weight
: Rick packs his things in boxes
knock at the door and the room morphs back into the cell
98
- Rick turns around to see the jailer standing at the door
Getting out of here, huh
It's time to move on
If you leave don't ever come back
Not even
Not even on a visit
You're a very ugly man
'd hate to explain to the other guards why you'd come to visit me
: ' ' Rick's Mom and the boys are playing
Grandma
Yes, Kris
Grandma  love you
love her more
love her the whole universe
love you all the whole universe plus one
: Rick and Melanie walk across the stage
99
So, this is where it all happened
It's funny, the tricks the mind can play on you
but the Judge, he sat right over there
and the jury sat right there
and the audience was filled with all these people who didn't really give a shit about me
bunch of innocent bystanders
And they all sat passing judgement on me, not knowing the situation, just staring over their schoolmarm spectacles and pointing their crooked fingers
All the world's a stage
Always casting dispersions
Rick walks off leaving Melanie at center stage
She looks around
The faint echo of a Judge's gavel can be heard in the distance
() Guilty as charged
Did you hear that
Hear what
Nothing
nothing at all
: - reveals: Rick, Melanie, the boys, and John sit watching a ball game
100
The secret of life, Melanie, is to always pay attention
pregnant Carrie returns to her seat carrying a box of hotdogs and drinks
always be prepared for what's right around the corner
The of the bat
Duck
Huh
John's :  foul ball is screaming in his direction
