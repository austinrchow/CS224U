Beautiful college students drink beer and mingle, trying to figure out who they're going to sleep with next
The main wall of the living room has been designated as a "Model Wall" of Delta Gamma girls --  smiles at us from a Hawaiian Tropic ad and a Miss June  calendar photo cover of an Italian Vogue shows a blonde sexpot ; a cheerleader poster displays a hard-bodied non-blonde in a pom-pom pose
Serena walks up, fending off an admirer
Jeremy, enough
am not going to formal with you
Jeremy slinks off as Margot arrives, agitated
Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis

(') But  ' m not positive it's gonna happen to n i g h t -- Helloo
he just had lunch with his grandmother
You know he got "The Rock"
Why else would she have flown in from Newport
It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond
(excited) You think
can't believe you're getting engaged
The three girls jump up and down, squealing and hugging
'mon -- you have to help me pick out the perfect outfit
As they head toward the door, Elle spots , a shy girl in a Delta Gamma Pledge sweatshirt, standing alone
(') (continuing) Amy, what's wrong
don't really -- know anyone
(teasing) That's because you spend too much time in the library
Come with me

Why don't you tell her about the time you guys went golfing naked
Elle winks at Amy and
heads off as the guys launch into their story
It was classic
Jason hit with wood all day
And we never ran out of balls -- Amy laughs
- Serena and Margot watch as Elle stands in front of a mirror, trying on a Herve Leger white mini-dress
Sexy and ultra- tight
; Too demure

It's the color of confidence
Well,  don't want to look like  know what's coming

Elle looks at them, suddenly concerned
Wh at if -- you know -- it's not the night
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy
You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you
Elle, you've heard the man pass gas in his sleep
That practically means you're pre-engaged
'" The Saleswoman approaches with the dress, kiss-assy smile on her face
Did you see this one
We just got it in yesterday
Elle fingers the dress, then the new price tag, looking back at the saleswoman, excited
Is this a low-viscosity rayon
Uh, yes -- of course
With half-loop top-stitching on the hem
(smiling a lie) Absolutely
It's one of a kind
() 6
: ( 2 )
4 ^       Elle hands the dress back to her, no longer pretending to be excited
It's impossible to use a half-loop topstitch on low-viscosity rayon
It would snag the fabric
And you didn't just get this in, because  remember it from the June Vogue a year ago, so if you're trying to sell it to me at full price, you picked the wrong girl
The saleswoman slinks off, embarrassed
(to the saleswoman) Nice try
Elle shakes her head and turns back to the girls as she slips on her Manolo Blahnik sandals, doing one last mirror check, smoothing down her golden mane
(dramatically) Girls, this is it
In a few hours, 'll be the future Mrs
Warner Huntington

(whispering) He's here
Elle, standing nearby with Margot and Serena and several other 's, smooths down her dress and takes a deep breath, o pening the door to find -- , , 21, tall, chiseled and outrageously handsome
He takes her in, a smile spreading across his face
You're beautiful
So are you

She looks up at him, blushing and completely smitten
They kiss
After a moment,-Warner extracts himself
(nervous) You ready
Her face is awash with devotion
am so ready

- Warner and Elle are seated at a cozy table on the patio
Elle takes a sip from her freshly poured champagne flute
Nervous and excited
Here' s to ~ us
Warner is slower to sip his
The reason  wanted to come here tonight was to discuss our future
Elle is on the edge of her seat
' m fully amenable to that discussion
mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when ' m at Harvard Law school is a completely different world
need to be serious
Of course
My family expects a lot from me
And expect a lot from me

hat 's why  think it's time for us to-- Elle takes a deep breath, filled with anticipation
(') ( ot n ig

c n iu n ) think we should break up
Elle's champagne glass drops from her hand and  onto the patio
What
Elle starts to flush, completely caught off guard
' m sorry, Elle,  just -- You're breaking up with me
(tearing up) thought you were proposing
Proposing
Elle, If  ' m going to be a politician,  need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn
(stunned) You're breaking up with me because  ' m too -- blonde
hat' s not entirely -- Then what
My boobs are too big
Elle -- no -- your boobs are fine -- Her tears start
(  ) 9
(2) : So when you said you'd always love me, you were just "dicking around"
Warner looks around the restaurant nervously
do love you, Elle
just can't marry you
You have no idea the pressure  ' m under
My family has five generations of senators
My brother is in the top three at Yale Law
He just got engaged to a Vanderbilt, for crissakes
Elle stares at him aghast, tears streaming down her face, then pushes her chair away from the table and walks out
(') (continuing) It's not like  have a choice, sweetheart He follows her out

'  -                                                  8 Elle teeters down the sidewalk as best she can in her three inch heels, sobbing
Warner pulls up alongside her in his convertible Saab
'mon
Let me take you home
No
Elle -- it's twenty miles back to campus
Elle stops, thinks a minute, then gets in, still crying
Catching her poofy little purse in the door
She re-opens i t, yanking the purse back in
Warner pulls out

-  -                                  9 Warner pulls up in front
It's a starry, romantic night
Everything should be perfect
It's not
Elle sits, still in shock, as tears continue to eke out
Elle, believe me,  never expected to be doing this, but  think it's the right thing to do
() 10
How can it be the right thing if we're not together
have to think about my future
And what people expect from me
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me
(through her tears) Everybody likes me
East coast people are different
Just because  ' m not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden  ' m white trash
grew up in Bel Air, Warner
Across the street from Aaron Spelling
think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderb ilt -- told you, Elle
need someone -- serious
' m seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough
He looks away
' m sorry
She gets out of the car and drags herself up the stairs to her sorority house
When she's at the top, she turns back to look at him
His perfect cheekbones highlighted by the streetlamp
He meets her eyes, pained, but determined
Then pulls away, leaving her there

Elle silently walks into her room
Serena and Margot follow, worried

Underdog stares at her, concerned
Serena and Margot stand in the door
Elle
Where's the Rock
We're not engaged
It's over

He broke up with me
Serena and Margot gasp in horror, rushing to her side
Is it a Kappa
It's not a Theta -- No -- it's just -- not me

We'll blacklist Sigma Chi
Thank you, Serena, but  don't think it'll do any good

Why would you say that to someone you didn't like
They shrug, mystified

Elle nods
The girls rise, hugging her

As they go, Margot looks at Serena
Oh, God

Helloo

You're right
Phew
As the girls go, they shut the door behind them

Next to the pictures are thirty dried Ecuardorian long- stemmed pink roses, remnants of their one year anniversary
In the center sits Elle, wearing Warner's old oversized Sigma Chi t-shirt, clutching a Gund teddybear
Depressed and looking like hell, she speaks to an unseen confidante

loved him the first moment  saw him
He's beautiful and smart and someone  totally respect
And  did everything  could to make him love me, but it wasn't enough
Now what am  supposed to do

My life was going to be all about Warner
Now what's it going to be about
She looks up -- waiting
Staring back at her is Underdog -- who sadly has no answers for her

It was awful
We all thought she'd be the first to walk down the aisle and now she's totally adrift
The nail technician shakes her head in shared girl-power- angst -- looking over at Elle, who sits in the waiting area, shell-shocked, but showered
Elle picks up the only magazine left on the table -- "Town & Country"
She wrinkles her nose
An   next to her reads "Seventeen"
Elle looks at her, begrudging the access to teen beauty tips, and flips through "Town & Country" n oisily until she freezes on-- the Engagement Section

They look at her, confused
Why
mean,  know you're upset and all, but can't you just take a sedative
Elle rolls her eyes at their naivete
Once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll want me back
It's a completely brilliant plan
But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school

Margot pulls something off her wrist and hands it to Elle

fashion major
#3 Well, we've never had one before
aren't we always looking for diversity

The Dean looks at her application

Sapphire puts a hand to her throat in distress
Elle is confused
It's a perfectly respectable place
Sweetheart, you don't need law school
Law school is for people who are boring and ugly and Serious
And you, button/ are none of those things
Sapphire is in agreement
You were first runner-up in the Miss Hawaiian Tropic contest
Why throw all that away
Because this is what  want

Sapphire looks at her, still not getting it
Can't you just suck his wiener

In the distance, a    (perhaps "Heaven Tonight by Hole) is heard

She hops out, scooping up Underdog and looking every inch the -Fred-Segal- glamour-queen, as she looks around with a smile
Elle looks at Underdog
We're here
She bends down to pour some Evian into his inflatable doggy dish, inadvertently revealing cleavage to a passing (several yards away)

Not finding him, she turns her attention to the Group Leader, a   2L in a red t- shirt
2L Okay
Welcome to law school
This is the part where we go around in a circle and everyone says a little bit about themselves

She smiles, as the group leader nods, waiting

(dramatically) Two weeks ago,  saw Cameron Diaz at Fred Segal -- and talked her out of buying a truly heinous angora sweater

Elle tries to shove a large law textbook into her tiny Prada backpack to no avail
She gives up and tosses the book onto the bed where Underdog leaps away to miss being squished
Wish me luck, Underdog
It's my first class as a serious law student
She kisses him and looks down at her completely inappropriate skimpy Gucci outfit, which she accents by putting on trendy, wire-rimmed glasses

Eyes only for Warner
Arrogant Aaron stomps away, pissed at the perceived blow-off
As Elle gets closer to Warner, she opts for wandering past him, seemingly oblivious to his presence

Elle turns, ultra-nonchalant
Warner
Oh my God,  completely forgot you were going here

No, silly

If you're looking for the best seat, hear the front row is the place to be

Laptops abound -- except for Elle, who has a fuzzy pink notebook and a pen with a pink plastic heart on the end
legal education means you will learn to speak in a new language
You will be taught to achieve insight into the world around you, and to sharply question what you know
Everyone soaks this up

Enjoy it
And those of you in the front row, beware
El le , in the front row, between two  , looks around, panicked
One of the braniacs passes her the seating chart and she has no choice but to sign her name
In the back, Arrogant Aaron nudges his friend and smiles

Well,  recommend knowing before speaking
The law leaves much room for interpretation -- but very little for self-doubt
As she turns away -- (') (continuing) And you were right
It was Aristotle
The class half-laughs in relief

Elle looks around, surprised, as students open their books

Steele
Silence
Stromwell looks down at the seating chart

Intense Ivan straightens in his' seat
Gordon sued her doctors for malpractice
And what did the dispute entail

Elle Woods

wasn't aware that we had an assignment
(looking at her chart) Sarah Knottingham
-- a prim and preppy blue-blood brunette, dressed in pearls and a sweater set -- looks up
(') (continuing) Do you think it's acceptable that Ms
Woods is unprepared
Sarah looks over at Elle
Elle gives her a mortified smile
Sarah turns back to Professor Stromwell
No,  don't
Would you support my decision to ask her to leave and return to class only when she is prepared
Absolutely
Elle can't believe that this girl would betray her
Having no choice,, she gathers her purse and goes, completely humiliated
Professor Stromwell returns to the matter at hand
Now, Ms
Knottingham, did diversity jurisdiction'exist in this case

Are you okay
Elle looks up, snapping out of her stupor
() 34
42
42 Do they just -- put you on the spot like that
Like, all the time
The professors
Yeah, they tend- to do that
Socratic method
And if you don't know the answer, they just kick you out
He smiles
You have Stromwell
(hopeful) Did she do that to you, too
No, but she made me cry once
Not in class --  waited until  got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers
(stricken) Neat
'   ,   ' Don't worry
It gets better
Who else do you have
Elle looks at her schedule
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson
Speak up in Donovan's class
He likes people with an opinion
Sit in the back for Royalton
He tends to spit when he talks about products liability
Elle makes a face
He smiles
Liking her

That's where all her exam questions come from
Wow
' m glad  met you
She smiles at him, grateful
Oh, and getting one of Stromwell's daily quotes right is almost as important as acing the mid-term
But you didn't hear it from me
Students trickle out of the building

:
Are you a third-year
Warner walks up, behind Emmett, interrupting
Hey
Elle looks up, pure adoration on her face
Hi
Emmett rises and walks off
Good luck
(calling after him) Thanks again for your help
Warner remains standing, still somewhat uncomfortable with her presence here

Fine
Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor
But no biggie
You're here now

She pats the bench beside her
He doesn't move
(distracted) Good

Do anything exciting
female hand snakes around Warner's chest from behind
Warner turns and brings the owner of the hand around to his side, presenting her
(nervous) Urn, hey, have you met Sarah
Sarah, the horrible girl herself, holds out her hand to Elle, full of contempt
Hi
Sarah Knottingham
(to Warner; horrified) You know her
She 's -- Sarah jumps in
--  ' m his fiancee
Elle stares at her
Sarah tucks a piece of her mousy brown hair behind her ear and there it is -- The Rock

You're famous at our Club
She says it in a way that is anything but flattering
In fact, it's completely condescending
(') (continuing; pointedly) But he didn't tell me you'd be here

Excuse me
She rushes off

, Elle lets it all out in a rush
worked really hard to get into law school --  blew off Spring Break and Greek Week to study for the LSATs, completely neglected my Homecoming Queen duties,  hired a Coppola to direct my admissions video -- all so  could get my boyfriend Warner back and now he's engaged to this awful girl Sarah so it was all for nothing
wish  ' d never even come to Harvard
Paulette dries Elle's hands and begins filing
After you went to all that trouble
: Well, what am  supposed to do
He's engaged
She's got the family six-carat on her bony, unpolished finger
You're asking the wrong girl

Cried a lot and gained twenty pounds

So, what's this Sarah got that you don't
Three tits

Yes

Our group is full
Oh, God, was this like an  thing
No, it's like a smart people thing

We've already assigned the outlines, and everyone has started theirs', (to Warner) Besides, you wouldn't let the fat guy _    join

Then  guess 'll leave you alone
She walks away, completely deflated, passing by the Enid calls out
Maybe there's a sorority you could join instead
Elle stops and looks at her
(to Enid) You know, if you'd come to a Rush party, would've at least been nice to you
Before you voted against me and called me a dyke behind my back
don't use that word
Only mean people use that word
You must've heard it from Sarah

As she does

She stands there, even more depressed

According to Swinney v
Neubert, Swinney, who was also a private sperm donor, was allowed visitation rights as long as he came to terms with the hours set forth by the parents
So, if we're sticking to past precedent, Mr
Latimer wasn't st al ki ng -- he was clearly within his rights to ask for visitation
But Swinney was a one-time sperm donor, and in our case, the defendant was a habitual sperm donor, who also happens to be harassing the parents in his quest for visitation

Paulette is frozen

How ya doin' today

He waits for her to sign
She remains frozen
Elle takes the pen and signs for her, trying to help
Guy smiles kindly at Paulette and heads out
Take it easy
Paulette watches him go, hand over her heart
Elle looks at her, concerned

What book of feminist theory did you read iiiai in, Enid
Emmett jumps in before war breaks out
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife
Chutney has a trust fund
She didn't need the insurance payoff or the inheritance
What about her mother

She was in Aspen at the time
Ten people saw her downing cosmopolitans at the Caribou Club

Professor Donovan says we really, really need your alibi
Brooke tears up
Elle,  can't

Yes

Why the hell not

Fuck sisterhood

Emmett hides a smile
Warner leans over to Elle
Sarah is nearby, listening
(quietly) If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate
Who cares
about Brooke
Think about yourself

Sarah watches -- seeing both Warner and Elle in a different light
Donovan storms back in
The ex-wife seems to be unconcerned with the fact that her interview is today
She's at a spa in the Berkshires

(to Elle) Isn't that like, your Mother-Ship
Elle shrugs and looks at Donovan

Why you
(to Enid) Have you ever been to a spa
And subscribe to the doctrine of self- hatred imposed upon my gender by male delusions of the way women are supposed to look

Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke
Uh, for starters, she won'-t give us an al i bi -- Aside from that
She's completely untrustworthy
Why
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network
) He's an old man with a really big penis
) She never told me  was fat
And ) Victoria Principal sells on that network
And ) Brooke is obviously hiding something
But maybe it's not what you think
Bu t maybe it is--
They're quiet for a moment
She looks at him
You're kind of being a butt-head right now

Because people aren't always what they seem to be and you refuse to see that
Have a little faith
You might be surprised
They're quiet again while he thinks about this
He looks over at her
can't believe you called me a butt- head
No one's called me a butt-head since ninth grade
Maybe not to your face
She gives him a teasing smile
He smiles back at her, shaking his head

Elle starts to go, then stops
Oh, and my friend Katherine Windham Vandermark is here somewhere and  ' m supposed to meet her

Do you have her schedule

Elle settles on three washcloths, strategically placed
So,  hear the tart from California shot    - Heyworth

Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial
She said they humped like gorillas
Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house
' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney
(sotto) Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it
But  guess it wasn't enough for Brooke
Why do you say that
Haven't you seen the cabana boy
(uneasy) Ys
Like  said, 've never met Brooke, but have seen her from a distance
When  ' d come over to pick up the alimony check that Heyworth forgot to mail every month, she'd be out by the pool, with Mr

You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment
She's ly-ing
And you know this for a fact
' Did you see the icky black color of her hair
So
never trust a woman who's not blonde
Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart
That's the whole reason  ' m starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund
He looks at her and laughs
The what
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide
Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband
If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow
" You're serious
She's fired up now
You should see the way  ' m treated in class
'm a complete source of mockery
This is why the Blonde Legal Defense Fund is needed
He goes along with it, won over by her enthusiasm
Okay, how would it work

99              (2)                                                   99 It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas
mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model
--  can't
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination
Wait -- Hilary Clinton
If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard
Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it
Emmett frowns
In that case, maybe Heyworth got --- fellated --by a brunette and Brooke caught him
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take
That's not really a topic that keeps me up at night -- but maybe it should
Elle digs in her purse
Speaking of that --  bought you some seaweed cream while we were at the spa
She hands it to him
He keeps his hands on the wheel, not taking it

You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself
don't -- (gesturing to the cream) Do that stuff
Well, you should --
f you look good,     you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world
Projecting joy is not my job
(sighing) Fine
Sorry  brought it up
She puts the cream back in her purse

Girls like me don't go out with losers like you
Her friends snicker
Elle stops at this and sighs, acknowledging to herself that she has to help this guy

Dorky David is stunned, as is the Freshman Girl

Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down

And so are your friends
She looks at Serena

Call me
She walks off
Serena looks alarmed
(hugging them) Don't worry
She's harmless
