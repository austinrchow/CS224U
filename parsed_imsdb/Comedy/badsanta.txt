" " by Glenn Ficarra & John Requa Revisions by Ethan Coen & Joel Coen Polish by Terry Zwigoff Dimension Films Production Draft -  February 1, 2002 : Snow flakes falling against a black sky
- It looks like a warm cozy place out of "It's  Wonderful Life"
The window is flocked with fake snow, and hung with colorful Christmas lights, wreaths and ornaments
: - The barman, wiping down the counter, gives an occasional semi-furtive glance toward the far end of the bar
Other patrons chat near the bartender and also give occasional glances toward the far end of the bar
It is early evening -- happy hour -- and the clientele is well-heeled and sociable
customer says something interrogative to the bartender, who looks down the bar and shrugs
-    (Notes the combination of the   and the tilt of Santa's head keep his face from being clearly revealed in this scene)
Sitting alone at the far end of the bar, given a wide berth by the other customers, a man () stares morosely into his drink
The drink is clearly not his first
He wears a red velvet suit and red velvet hat with a white pom-pom
He has shiny black boots with red velvet trim
His long white beard is not real and is in fact pulled down below his chin to facilitate drinking
It exposes heavy black stubble
Swaying slightly, he raises the drink to the vicinity of his lips
Once it gets close he must navigate it in with some effortful coordination
He takes a sip and sets the drink carefully back down
After another long, staring, morose beat, he starts weeping
It is loud, dolorous, and unself-conscious
- Santa staggers out the back door
still hiding his face
Santa gets about ten feet, then pauses and leans with one hand against the alley wall, uses the other to hold his pom- pom out of the way, and vomits
Having vomited, and spit, he staggers off toward the street
: - An upbeat woman  presides over a half-dozen sitting at school desks
On the blackboard the Trainer is writing out the sixth "Santa Commandment"
' 1) No alcoholic beverages before or during your shift
2) Know the names of your reindeer
3) Do not smoke in your costume
4) No swearing
5) Absolutely no flirting
6) Coax a smile from the child
7) 8) 9) (as she writes) Coax
a
smile
from
the child
(turning to face them) Remember, parents don't want photos where their child isn't smiling
Some children may not want to smile
It is your job to coax a smile out of them
good line to remember is: "Santa thinks everybody should be happy
Can you smile for Santa
" camera can only copy a child's smile -- it will take you to put it there
As she talks we : one of the Santas ()
His  reaches into a boot and pulls out a pint of Smirnoff
We
to see this hand pour a few ounces into a can of Coke he holds behind his desk
If the child will not smile, the Photo Elf will go ahead and take the picture anyway
Now, it is a good Santa's job to smile as well -- know with the big white beard your smile will be partially hidden, so you must learn to smile with your eyes
They show warmth and can be very expressive
: ' as he finishes off the can of Coke to : his eyes colder than those of a dead fish
Remember you have been chosen for the starring role of Santa Claus
Your portrayal of this beloved character will have a major impact on every child you meet
Keep in mind at all times that to them, you aren't a man dressed up like Santa, you are Santa
: '
His expression reads: "Please kill me"
- Wintry night
Ray Coniff's "Jolly Ole Saint Nicholas" scores views of the downtown blanketed in snow and decorated for the holiday
It is Christmas Eve, and the sidewalks throng with people rushing to do their last-minute shopping
and her two absurdly bundled  emerge from the crowd
Hurry boys, we're gonna miss Santa
She drags them across the street toward the looming art-deco monolith that is the big-city department store
-   - Mother and children crest the escalator to emerge on the top floor
There
The older child is pointing at a prop gate with a candy-cane letter sign:  '
He runs and Mom shoos her younger child to join him
The boys cross the threshold of the gate and their eyes filled with wonder
winding path cuts through a flocked and candy-striped forest, past a workshop filled with mannequin-elves busily cobbling Christmas toys, and finally arriving at
Santa, seated on his throne like a scarlet Messiah
The younger child staggers forward to join the line of a hundred other leaky-nosed worshippers awaiting an audience
At the head of the line the next waiting child is escorted to Santa's chair by a smiling tiny man () dressed as an elf
-   - An imitation    quintet sings Christmas Carols
Grown-ups busy themselves draining their wallets as a comes over the intercom: (
) Attention shoppers: the store will be closing in five minutes
We hope tomorrow is a pleasant Christmas and thank you for shopping with us, your friends
Purposeful haste eddies the crowd
- '  - The Photo Elf takes the digital photo and presents it to a (dutifully reciting his spiel) My, what a darling picture
Are you certain you only want the single
Additional photos come in handy as gifts for grandma and grandpa or a wonderful remembrance for friends
That's all right, 'll just take the single
He takes her credit card as
On his knee is a   who whispers excitedly in his ear
(disinterested) Uh-huh
yeah
done
Young Boy climbs off and runs away,    jumps up on Santa's lap
saw you in another mall
(not even looking at him) Right
Good for you
You're not really Santa
If you were Santa you could do magic
(looks at him) You want magic
Santa pushes him off his lap and shoves him on his way
There,  just made you disappear
Santa turns to his Elf, That it
The Elf nods as he peels off a pointed prosthetic ear
Santa pulls a fifth of Old Grandad from the cushions of his throne
Thank fuckin' Christ
He takes a swig
-  - With the sound of closing circuits, banks of lights systematically shut down in the various departments of the now empty store
-   - Downstairs the last of the store employees file out the door past an old
Eventually Santa emerges
Merry Christmas, Willie
Up your ass
The guard chuckles
Have it your way, Willie
Don't tell me which way to have it
The Security Guard heads for a panel near the doorway and punches a key labeled
An
readout labeled "" counts down from 30 seconds
The guard exits the store, locks the door and heads home
- '  - large Teddy bear sits under a Christmas tree
Suddenly - it moves, bolting upright and sprinting from the room
-  - The alarm continues to count down -- 15
14
The Teddy bear slides down the space between the railing of the escalators
Landing on its feet, it barrels toward the door
10
9
The Teddy bear scrambles for the door, crashing into everything in its path
7
6
Running past a clothing display, it rips the arm off a mannequin without breaking stride
5
4
It skids to a stop at the base of the alarm box, too short to reach the controls
2
It raises the mannequin arm, using the pointed finger on its hand to press the "" key on the keypad
Mission accomplished, the teddy bear rips off its head to reveal his true identity: Santa's Elf -- in civilian life known as
He is covered in sweat and panting like an asthmatic
-   - hasp flips open and Marcus swings the door wide to reveal a beer-guzzling Santa-in-the-off-season known as
He finishes the beer, crushes the can and drops it to his feet next to eight more empties
Ready
Marcus sneers at him as he lumbers past: Jesus
- '  - Marcus and Willie tear open the prop presents on the workshop set and remove several tools
- Marcus reaches into jewelry cases and removes a few particular items
He drops them into a stock cart then checks a typed list before moving on
Marcus pushes the cart through the store, gathering an odd array of items that range from furs to gowns to shoes to makeup
-   - Marcus arrives outside a doorway and looks in to see Willie manning a large water drill and putting it to work on the store's vault
How's it goin'
'm finished when 'm finished
'm goin' downstairs
(referring to list) need a melon-bailer and a loofah
The drill suddenly revs higher, getting Willie's attention
Got it
Marcus moves closer as Willie pulls back the drill on the track
He places a screwdriver into the exposed lock assembly and hits it with a sledgehammer
Suddenly, the door swings open and bundled cash spills to the floor
Both men are impressed
Fuck the loofah, let's go
-   - Marcus and Willie wheel out two carts and roll them through the open doors of a waiting van
As they slam the doors -- - Willie settles on the rear bench as Marcus gets into the passenger seat next to his Pillipina Mail-order wife of several years, , who is dressed in expensively ugly clothes, and whose mouth is ever down-turned in pruney distaste
Marcus, did you get the loofah
Drive
- The van speeds away through the Christmas Eve night and disappears into the distance, like the down of a thistle
: of An alarm clock ringing with a jolt
- Willie, in bed, blearily wakes to the insistent alarm
He tries to turn it off, but his fingers are still clotted with sleep
In a series of frustrated grunts and groans he becomes more and more aggravated until, finally -- ,
He bolts out of bed and throws the clock into the wall
He stoops for some beer bottle empties and hurls them at the clock debris
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
One final scream and it's out of his system
He finds one last bottle in his hand, half-full with a cigarette butt floating in it
He downs the beer and steps into the adjoining bathroom to brush his teeth
- Willie, sipping a cup of coffee, meanders down the street scratching his ass
- Willie's walk brings him to a fancy eatery at lunchtime
As he passes, he casually snatches a handful of car keys from the parking valet key-box and moves on
As he rounds the corner into the lot he pushes on the various key fobs, identifying various cars when their alarms chirp
He seems dissatisfied until a brand new Cadillac chirps
Willie gets in and drives off
-  - Willie drives
He reaches over into the glove compartment and pulls out the registration
He focuses on the car owner's address
-  -  - Willie, eating a corn dog, saunters down an opulent hallway, a beer swinging in one hand
-  -  - In long shot, through the open door of an extravagant marble bathroom, we see Willie sitting on the toilet, leafing through a magazine, beer bottle on the counter next to him
Pants around his ankles
-  -  - Willie, standing by the toilet, finishes buckling his belt and flips the flush lever
Nothing happens; no whoosh of rushing water
Willie, looking down into the toilet, gives the lever a couple more clanking tries, and then grabs his beer and ambles off
-  -  - Sucking on his beer, Willie paces the periphery of the room, methodically knocking painting after painting off the walls
-  -   - Willie arrives in the bedroom still knocking down paintings until, finally, he exposes a wall safe
smile, and he pulls out a stethoscope
: The safe door swings open to reveal stacks of cash
- Willie scratches a lottery ticket
He's now wearing a Rolex and some gaudy ring
Goddamn it
He reaches for another one and we see that on the bartop in front of him are neat stacks of lottery tickets as yet unscratched, and an untidy jumble of scratched ones
On the other side of the bar a -  vies for his attention
Willie's ticket hits for $5
00
Yeah baby
He tucks it into the Stripper's -string, swigs a drink, and resumes scratching
- Willie and the Stripper stagger into his apartment, drunk
As he passes his blinking answering machine: got messages
Go wash yourself
'm a dancer,  sweat
Well you smell like a bum's nutsack
Fuck you
Yeah, yeah
As she exits, he activates the machine
(
) Mr
Soke, this is Andrew Kaplan again from the collection agency --
Willie skips to the next message
(
) Willie,  don't care man, 'm not looking to blame anyone, but that diamond isn't a real stone, man took it to --
Willie skips to the next message
'  (
) Uh, hello, this is Helen Axelrod -- you ran into my car last week
Well called State Farm but they have no record of any insurance policy for you and --
Willie skips to the next message
'  (
) Willie, it's Marcus
It's that time of year again
Pack your shit
Phoenix
: ,  - To the chimey chords of "Sleigh Ride," we see Phoenix, Arizona in  / dressed for Christmas but sweltering under its oppressive winter heat
-   - Through the heat ripples rising off the pavement two mirage- like figures cross the infinite asphalt of the Saguaro Square Mall parking lot -- Willie and Marcus in Santa and Elf regalia, sweating and panting in the heat
Willie polishes off a pint of Smirnoff's and flips it towards a nearby trash can
It misses and breaks loudly on the pavement
Jesus Christ
Can you maybe keep it together for just ten minutes
He pulls some Tic Tacs out of his pocket
For crying out loud, chew a few of these
you drunken, fuckin' imbecile
Anchoring the huge mall complex is the large and upscale Chamberlain's Department Store
' -   - Amid the bustle of holiday shopping, an angry heavy-set man with a Grizzly Adams beard stomps away from the pursuing store manager, Bob Chipeska
Harrison, please  Just let me explain
Financially, the -- You get what you pay for, Chipeska
Five Christmases 've given my heart -- my soul -- my love to these kids, and now what
Now you flip me for some stranger who'll do it for peanuts and happens to work with a real midget
Lemme tell you something: nobody cares
Nobody comes here for the elf, Santa's the attraction do Burl Ives songs; does this schmoe even play guitar
Harrison, it's not the money or the midget
Believe me, if it was,  -- don't think they like "midget" think you're supposed to call them -- Aw, forget it
Harrison stomps away and right toward Marcus and Willie as they enter the store
Hacks
Willie and Marcus stop in their tracks and watch the burly man storm out
Bob Chipeska watches with them
Hi
Bob Chipeska
, please, , uh -- please don't listen to him
Great resume and photo by the way
Thanks
you know, we been at this a long time an' all, so we like to think we do a good job
Beautiful Girl wearing skin-tight pants walks by, catching Willie's eye
He stares wantonly at her ass, off in his own little world
You two are the best men for the job
Truly
So do not let his
unpleasantness affect your performance in any way
Oh no, we're fine, w -- (irked, snapping out of his daydream) Performance
Willie's reaction worries Marcus
Yea
Your performance
you know, the
Performance
Like sexual
Excuse me
Willie no, he -- You saying there's something wrong with my gear
Willie
'm sorry
Your gear
You know
fuck stick
We're gonna head upstairs now
Marcus shoves Willie, who stalks off
Marcus lingers to smooth things over
He forces a grin and shakes his head
Such a card
He's not gonna say "fuck stick" in front of the children, is he
No, no, no
Joke
Adult joke
For us
Adults
long, long, long silence
Joke
Another beat
Marcus pantomimes helpless laughter, noiselessly throwing his head back and holding his gut as it heaves with mirth
He is instantly composed
' -   - On an upper floor of Chamberlain's the theme is "The Desert as Winter Wonderland
" Cacti and tumbleweeds are wrapped with lights and flocked with snow, and a team of nine stuffed burros are hitched to a sleigh
Rudolfo the Red Nosed Burro is tended by several Santa's elf mannequins
One in cowboy wear and another in a poncho and sombrero
Again there is a line of waiting children
Marcus makes his way through the line as kids gasp and cheer
He plays to the crowd
Merry Christmas
Santa's coming
Yayyyyyy
Marcus gets to the head of the line, ducks under the velvet rope and goes behind the flimsy cardboard set
Willie sits there morosely, head slumped, forearms on knees, red velvet hanging limply from one hand
What the fuck you doing, "fuck stick" in front of the boss
don't like that guy
He takes a bottle from the floor by his feet and swigs off it
Marcus stares at him
You don't like any guy
You think can't find another portly motherfuck can run a water drill
Willie just slumps there apologetically
Don't tempt my hand
You blow this and we're broke for the year
So stop acting like you know something because, pal of mine, you don't know squat
You're gum on my shoe
Yeah, yeah
Now put on your fuckin' hat and get out there
He grabs the hat, slams it into Willie's chest and, as Willie rises, kicks him in the ass
Willie just takes it, shambling off
(' And try to act professional
For Chrissake
-   - On the outskirts of the Saguaro Square Mall's parking lot a city bus stops with a hiss
The doors swing open to reveal a pathetic -- , overweight, snot-nosed, badly dressed and probably smelling of pee
As the kid nears the mall entrance he passes a group of older children doing skateboard stunts
They notice him
Loser
One of them throws an empty can that hits him in the head
The kid walks on, it seems without noticing
The bullies, disheartened by the lack of reaction, go back to their skateboarding
' -   - Marcus leads a    over to the throne
The boy eats a chocolate ice cream cone which is smeared all over his mouth and -shirt
Marcus lifts him with effort and a groan onto Willie's lap
All right, wuddya want
Nintendo Deer Hunter 3
Fine
Next
The   hops off onto Willie's foot by mistake
Watch the toenails willya
Marcus puts a young girl on his lap
She looks up at him in awe
Wuddya want
Santa
Yeah, c'mon, c'mon, wuddya want
Um
Barbie
Fine
Next
Marcus puts another young boy on his lap
What do you want
Fraggle-stick car
(to himself) Fuck is that
(back to the kid) Fine, whatever, next
No one is next
Next
Next
Still nothing
Next, goddamnit
Let's move it along -- this is not the
Marcus walks over to the rope
The snot-nosed Kid is next in line, frozen by fear
Marcus pulls on his hand
It's okay
'mon
The Kid stays put
What's your name
The Kid shakes his head meekly
You can tell me
No response
How about Santa
If you don't tell him, you won't get a present
This penetrates the Kid's fear
He moves
That's right
Let's tell Santa
Marcus leads the Kid up to the throne and places him on Willie's lap
What do you want
'mon, wuddya want
snot rag
The Kid just stares, motionless except for the flowing rivulet of snot
Willie can't help but stare at it
(to himself) Another fuckin' mongoloid
(shouts) Marcus  get him outta here before he pisses on me
Suddenly the Kid is moved to yank Willie's beard
He holds it stretched below Willie's chin
(whispered to the kid) Let it go, you little bastard
It's not real
It was real
The hair fell out when got sick
How'd you get sick
loved a woman who wasn't clean
Mrs
Santa
No, her sister
(whispers through clenched teeth) Let the fucking thing go
What's it like at the North Pole
Like the suburbs
Which one
Apache Junction
What the fuck do you care
Willie shoves the Kid: Get the hell off my lap
The Kid backs away, looking at him
You are really Santa, right
No
No, 'm an accountant
wear this as a fucking fashion thing
Okay
The Kid backs away in awe, never breaking his reverent stare
As Marcus helps the next child onto Santa's lap Willie hisses at him: Get that kid out of here, he's freaking me out
' - The Kid sits on a bench watching the entrance to Chamberlain's
After a beat Willie and Marcus walk out in costume and cross toward the parking lot
The Kid follows from a safe distance
-   - Willie and Marcus walk across the huge empty parking lot, followed at a great distance by the Kid
They arrive at their cars -- Marcus' van and a beat-up old Chrysler that is Willie's -- parked next to each other
As the Kid creeps closer, he is able to hear their conversation
Willie motions to the Black Angus in the parking lot
gotta get a drink on
See ya tomorrow
Just don't come in to work stinkin' of booze again
Don't worry about me
Get going, you'll be late for your Wizard of Oz Candy Bar Guild thing
Lollipop Guild, asshole
Jesus, two year olds flip me shit better'n you
You tryin' to say something to me
(pauses, then deliberately) Yeah
'm gonna stick my whole fist up your ass
- large faux rustic bar filled to capacity with loosened-tie middle-management
Crammed at the far end of the bar, Willie stands out like a sore thumb in this thirty-ish crowd
We follow his gaze all around the perimeter of the room until it connects with the drunken, glowering face of a , sitting right across from him, startling Willie for a moment
Willie regains his composure, then gives the guy a puzzled look back, and amused by the guy's unflinching anger, raises his glass in a toast to him as if to say, "whatever
cheers, you nutcase", and turns back to his drink
The man stands up and, never releasing his stare, moves right up to Willie, two inches from his face
Willie looks up
(Hindi accent) Listen here buddy, let me make yourself perfectly clear
We don't like your kind coming around here in your red silk and satin clothes with your hunger for same-sex relationships
Consider yourself warned
Well fu-uck you
know that's what you'd like to do
Willie gears up for a swing
Up yours, yufff -- hand grabs his arm
(
) Don't
Willie follows the hand to find a mature but attractive (), an outdoorsy western beauty
Her eyes and Willie's lock -- a source of sardonic amusement for the troublemaker
Oh saved by a woman, mister No-Pussy- Please man
He stalks off
He ain't worth it, sugar
He got hit on last week
Didn't sit too well
By the bathroom, the troublemaker is in another man's face: This is not Flagstaff
Another Grandad, Santa
Yep
She pours him another and slams it on the bar
Got a name
Oh yeah
He pounds the drink
She waits
Nothing else is forthcoming
What do you do
mean, after the holidays
Nothing 'til March
Then 'm the Easter Bunny
Another
Why not
Buy you one
Why not
She pours two
They both pound them back
Her statement is a question: Not a big talker
Nah
Buy you one
Why not
As she pours: You're pretty regular, for a Santa
He shrugs: It's my job, no big deal
'm an eating, drinking, shitting, fucking Santa Claus
Prove it
Willie stares at her
Which
'  -   - Willie is on top of the barmaid, humping her, still in his Santa suit
His pom-pom bobs in rhythm with his thrusts
Yes
Yes
Yes
Fuck me, Santa
Fuck me, Santa
The hat is slipping askew
He reaches for it
At least lemme take off the hat
-   - In the parking lot the barmaid finishes straightening her clothes and touching up her lipstick in the rearview mirror
Willie, leaning against his car, still in his Santa suit, fires up a post-coital cigarette
got a thing for Santa Claus, don't know,  guess it's from early childhood
(taking a swig) Yeah, so's my thing for tits
Maybe because my parents were Jewish and never celebrated Christmas
Santa was sort of forbidden, you know
She gets out of the car
like you
Most of the people around here are pretty uptight
My name is Sue
Here's my number
She hands him the slip of paper and ambles off, calling back over her shoulder: Don't mothball that suit
Willie, nodding understanding, turns to reach for his car door and -- -- the accompanying   brings in the screaming homophobe
Whoa-Jesus
All right buddy, that's it
Buddy
said,  am not gay
Look, what's the problem pal, you go off your meds
The man stares at him for a beat
Yes, but this isn't about that
You are queer as a ten dollar bill
Now you listen
My brother lost an arm fighting you people in Vietnam, so  want you to take a good hard look at this face
Willie pulls back a fist
'cause it's the last fuckin' thing you're gonna see before  knock your head off and sh -- ----
The man surprises Willie with a flurry of effective punches
In moments, Willie is on the losing end of homosexual panic
Who is the bitch now, fat man
(
) Leave Santa alone
The Troublemaker stops and looks down to find the Kid beating on his legs
Please little boy,  am doing this for all of us
Willie gets a chance to regain composure
He wipes the blood from his mouth, raises his fists and
promptly collapses
think he has finished his cruising for tonight, hm
The Hindustani hothead wanders off
The Kid shuffles over to the prone Willie
You
'  -  - The Kid sits in the front seat next to Willie who drives, stewing
This one time  take you home
Uh-huh
'm not your fuckin' dada
Uh-huh
It's not as if you helped out with that nut-job
Uh-huh
And you're right there to grab his fuckin' balls
Uh-huh
Right height
Yeah
Willie demonstrates with a sharp turn of his hand: Twist 'em
Why do you need a car
Fuck you talkin' about
This car
Whuh
Which turn is it
Sage Terrace
Where's your sleigh
Willie answers absently, his head slightly ducked and his eyes darting side to side, checking for road signs: Repairs
In the shop
Where're the reindeer
stable 'em
Is it gonna be left or right
(pointing left) That way
Where's the stable
Next to the shop
How do they sleep
Who -- the reindeer
Standing up
But the noise, how do they sleep
What noise
From the shop
They, uh, they only work during the day
thought it was always night at the North Pole
Not now
Now it's always day
Then how do they sleep
Well, they --   - '  -- Whoa
Sage Terrace
He makes a hard left
What is it with you
Somebody drop you on your fucking head
On my head
What, are they gonna drop you on somebody else's head
How can they drop me onto my own head
Not onto your own h -- '  - Willie escorts the Kid along a long walkway that leads to the front door of a large, opulent, new-money Southwestern home
Willie admires the surroundings
Nice digs
Daddy home
He's on a adventure 'sploring mountains
He been gone a long time
Exploring mountains
When's he coming back
Next year
What about Mommy
She lives in God's house with Jesus and Mary and the Ghost and the long- eared donkey and Joseph and the talking walnut
Who the fuck takes care of you then
Granma
(hatching an idea) Really
What's her name
Granma
As the Kid lets himself in Willie pulls out a black ski mask and puts it on his head like a stocking cap
Uh-huh
Is Granny spry
He unrolls the mask to cover his face and takes out a blackjack
'  - Willie enters the foyer as the Kid walks into the adjoining room
He approaches a figure in a La--Boy watching
Granma, Santa's here
Are you spry
Grandma rises from her chair with the assistance of her walker and begins to move toward Willie
She wears a bathrobe and thick glasses and has another pair of glasses on a chain around her neck
Roger
You're home
Let me fix you some sandwiches
He watches as the senile old woman innocently putters away
He yanks off his mask and turns to the Kid
So you're tellin' me no one else is here
The Kid shakes his head
No aunts, no uncles, no cousins
The Kid shakes his head
Butler, security guard
Nothin'
Nuh-uh
This sinks in
Willie looks to the Kid
Daddy got a safe
'  -  - The sound of a tumbler tripping and, suddenly, light sweeps in as the safe door opens to reveal a smiling Willie with his stethoscope in his ears
In the foreground a few stacks of cash and a folio
Willie reaches in
Willie grabs the folio and flips through it
Insurance forms, deeds, Social Security cards, birth certificates, etc
, all bear the name of the Kid's father, Roger Merman
Nothing of value
He puts the folio back, grabs the cash
You need money to fix your sleigh
Huh
Yeah, whateverthefuck
You want milk and cookies
Willie bends down and faces the Kid with a smile
Daddy got a car
'  - At the cut a new Mercedes screeches through the frame and, as we hear it recede, we are left looking at the kid, who stands at the curb, waving happily
Bye Santa
' -   - -: the glowing ash of a cigarette burning down
The inhale lasts as long as comic timing will allow -- about six or seven seconds
: wiry, hard-bitten, sun-baked saddlebag of a man, sits behind his cluttered desk sucking on a filterless Pall Mall
We can hear his in-taken breath rattling over and around the phlegm, growths, and polyps that line his embattled trachea
His words come out on an exhaled cloud chamber's worth of smoke: "Fuck stick"
Bob Chipeska sits opposite
Yes,  thought it was strange too, but you know, , , , , uh, , his little friend promised he wouldn't say it in front of the children
Which is fine because, you know, urn, there's an adult world and a child's world and that's okay
'm not a censor
Little friend
Yes, a, a, a dwarf
Or midget
a, a,  don't know what he's called exactly but
a little guy
Little
Billy Barty
God rest
But thin fingers
Not the fat sausage fingers
"Little people," that's what they like
Ah, yes, right
So "fuck stick," that's all
Well, no, there was something else
' - '    - () Chipeska walks by a cashier station carrying some paperwork he's absorbed in, but hears some   that make him pause
Curious, he heads in the direction of the sounds
They're coming from the dressing room area
Chipeska curiously makes his way towards a corridor of dressing rooms
(
) couple of days ago  was in Women's Big & Tall
-- sign reads: "Three Times  Lady"
' -    - () He goes down a corridor of dressing rooms
(
) and  heard these, urn, you know, these
noises
The sound of throttling lust builds in volume
He follows his ears until he arrives at a dressing room door
Big or Tall woman within screams with pleasure: (
) Oh yeah
Oh yeah
'  (
) Yeah
Yeah
You ain't gonna shit right for a week
He looks underneath and spots black Santa boots with red velvet pants around the ankles
' -   - Bob Chipeska holds up one hand
Now don't get me wrong
was against the Clinton impeachment
What a man does with his penis -- Oval Office, Women's Big & Tall -- it's not for the American people to say
Right
But when you're dealing with children, a tender sensibility, a position of trust -- then perhaps, someone who has screaming orgasms with large women -- Mm
Though  can't fire him for that
No
Sizisra
They'd say
Sure
Not true
am no siziat
But  can see the picket line now
Yeah, a big fuckin' fat one
They'd all say, If it had been a supermodel or, uh
Heeyeah
Unfair practices
lot of special pleading
Bitch, bitch, bitch
Fuckin' broads
But --  can't help it -- the guy makes me uneasy
Well sure
Santa fuckin' someone in the ass
So maybe there's something  could fire him for
Yeah
Yeah
getcha
Do you
Do you think you could find something
Oh shit yeah
There's always something
-   - through the arcade's window shows Willie talking in pantomime to a young girl -- a very young girl -- at one of the pinball machines
Willie has his hands out to either side and is either demonstrating the kind of body English to apply to the machine, or else is describing an elaborate sexual encounter -- either recalled or prospective
The girl, giggles
shows Marcus halted at the arcade window staring in with disbelief that gives way to jaw-grinding anger: Motherfucker
Oh, you lousy fucking motherfuck
-   - Willie and Marcus walk to their cars
That's just the kinda shit that's gonna get us pinched
(apologetic) She said she was eighteen
You promised no arcades
You said you'd only hustle Big & Tall
Ah, it's like shooting fish in a barrel -- there's no sport, How many times, you fuck
"The bigger the store, the bigger the take
" Well, we can't work the big stores with your big fucking train wrecks
(pulling out his keys) You got some nerve you little shit ya
You my mom now
You shat me out your womb, is that it
You gotta take care of me
Well  can take care of myself and  don't need no lectures
know how to keep a low profile
-
Willie uses his key fob to deactivate the car alarm to the Mercedes
What the fuck is this
Mind your own fucking business
Willie opens the door and an avalanche of beer bottle empties tumbles out, rolling everywhere
You cocksucker
Willie starts the engine and pulls out, and Marcus yells to the receding car: -
(then, to himself) -- You dumb Dipshit Motherfucker
- Willie parks the Mercedes in the front of a rundown motel complex
He walks past hookers and junkies until he gets to his unit
He pulls out his key and just as he's about to insert it in the lock he sees a flashlight beam shining inside the window
Surprised, he backs off cautiously and presses up against the wall
Someone inside is rifling the room
Willie hisses at a nearby hooker: Opal, come here
Opal looks at him with disdain
Screw you, Willie -- last time didn't shit right for a week
No, not that -- come here
Reluctantly, she sidles over
Who the fuck's in my room, did you see someone go into my fuckin' room
Yeah some guy askin' 'boutcha -- looked like a cop
Ah fuck
'  - Marcus is on the phone with Willie
What guy
You get a look at him
: - Willie is at a pay phone
No,  think it's a cop though
You think someone's onto us
Is there anything in the room
Anything professional
No
Clothes
Just ditch
You got anywhere to sack out for a while
'  -  - The Kid swings the door open to Willie, who stands on the stoop holding a small grip
Santa
Yeah
You're bringing my present early
But  never told you what  wanted
said  didn't bring it, dipshit
Okay
Good
want a stuffed elephant
pink one
Yeah, well
He brushes past the kid into the house, eyes darting this way and that
wish in one hand and shit in the other, see which fills up faster
Okay
The Kid follows Willie like a puppy dog as Willie checks out the house, bumping open doors, looking around
'm gonna be staying here a while
Things are all fucked up at the North Pole
Mrs
Santa, she
she walked in on me fuckin' her sister
So 'm out on my fuckin' ass
She's taking half of everything
This'll do
'  -   - Willie has discovered the master bedroom, by appearances long unused
He tosses his grip onto the double bed
'm gonna crash here
You and me, like, you know, bachelors
Do you and Mrs
Santa have kids
No
Thank the fuck Christ
What about the elves
Yeah, well, them
They stay with Mrs
Santa
get 'em on weekends
Run me a bath, will ya
What about the reindeer
(pleading) Don't start with the fucking reindeer
'  -   - The Kid sits on a stool, hands on his knees, staring, motionless
Finally: What're their names
Willie lies in the tub, also motionless, a wet washcloth over his face, fingers of one hand resting against a tumbler filled with ice and amber liquid that sits on the edge of the tub
From under his washcloth: Who
The elves
(to himself) Oh, fuck
(then, to the Kid) --  can't remember
Sneezy, and Dopey -- That's the Seven Dwarves
Shit, is that not
just -- fuck, don't know, 'll just say, Hey, Bub -- Look,
He drags the washcloth off his face and looks at the kid
' The Kid looks at him, unperturbed
-- How old are they
'  -   - Willie staggers in, a towel around his waist, the empty rock glass in one hand, a bottle tucked under the other arm, the Kid trotting after
You want cookies
No
Warm milk
No
Willie carefully, carefully puts glass and bottle down on the nightstand and slowly raises both hands in a "Don't
Move" gesture to keep them from flying off
Should  fix you some sandwiches
What is with the fixing sandwiches
No
Satisfied that the bottle and glass are not going anywhere, Willie climbs unsteadily onto the bed and stares at the ceiling
Okay
You want anything else
No
As soon as the bed stops moving 'm going to sleep
Okay
Wake me up
when the little hand is on the
long beat
The ragged breath of drunken sleep
Okay
' -   -   - Marcus's wife Lois stands in front of a mirror, trying on a cashmere scarf
Her look of pruney disapproval is in place, as ever
She takes off the scarf and writes something in a small spiral notebook
Can  help you, ma'am
Just looking
Across the store, she spies the jewelry counter
' -   -   - Lois stands looking intently down through the glass case in pruney disapproval
Help you with anything, ma'am
Without bothering to look up: Just looking
As he drifts away she takes out her spiral notebook and makes more notes
-   - Willie and Marcus nosh on food-court Gyros
Fuck me
Fuck you
You can't just take up with some kid
You don't know who's around, what they do
You got some nerve you little shit ya
You my mom now
You shat me out your -- You said that last night you stupid fuck
Ah, shit
Fuck you
Lois appears with a salad on a tray and a look of pruney disapproval
She sits next to Marcus and, in the way of old couples comfortable with each other, he rests a hand on her knee and continues to talk, ignoring her, while she picks through her salad, ignoring him
You are by far the dumbest most pathetic piece of maggot-eaten shit that has ever slid from God's gilded ass
What if the kid has one of those fucking play-dates they have now
You shittin' me
He doesn't have fucking friends
Not even an imaginary one
Unless he got ditched by him
He's just a fuckin' misfit
Lives with his grandma who sits drooling in front of the
Every once in a while she gets up to play soccer with her tits
What, she's gon' rat me out
She don't know her ass from last Tuesday
Marcus thinks a moment
You fuck her
Jesus
Why is everything sex with you
With me
fuck one person,  ain't out there serial fornicating, trying to float my liver
Drinkin' myself silly 'cause  can't stand what a piece of shit  am
Lois, chewing on her salad, notices someone walking by with a Chamberlain's bag
She glances in as the person passes and, still chewing, gets out her notebook and jots something down
What're you, fuckin' Sigmund Sawed- Off Freud
The shrunken fuckin' shrink
Yeah, that's right, shit-for-brains, talk about my height
Make it about something safe
'Cause you're an emotional fucking cripple
Your soul is dog shit
Every single fuckin' thing about you is ugly
Yeah
Well
fuck you
Marcus and Lois get up to leave
've seen anal warts more attractive than you
They walk off
Willie sits there for a moment
Goes back to eating his hamburger
comes up with her  in tow
Oh, look who's here Jimmy
It's Santa
Let's tell him what you want for Christmas
(shouting, food flying out of his mouth) '
(putting her hands over the Toddler's ears) Are you insane
How dare you talk like that in front of a child
The management is going to hear about this
'm going to have you fired
That's a threat
You think you can make my life any worse, you go ahead, be my fucking guest
He throws his hamburger back down on his tray and storms off, leaving the woman shocked
'  -   - Willie and the Kid sit opposite each other over a game of checkers
Willie scowls as the Kid thinks for an eternity about his next move
The silence is deafening
Endless
Then
King me
Willie stares at the board for a long beat
He leaps up screaming and flings the board across the room
Willie throws checkers one by one against the wall, punctuating each throw with an insult
Son of a
you
Kid's face, unfazed, still smiling
'  - '  - Later
The kid lies in bed, sleeping peacefully
Distant sounds of the slosh of water
'  -   - Churning water
The sloshing of water is now accompanied by a rhythmic slapping sound
Willie bangs Sue in the Jacuzzi
He is wearing his Santa hat
'  -   - Two tall water glasses are set down on a sideboard
(
) Refill
(
) Mm
splash of orange juice is dolloped into each of the glasses, and then both are filled to the top with vodka
on the living room reveals Sue looking around
Her speech -- and Willie's -- is somewhat impaired: Nice place you got
Needs a bit of a woman's touch, but it's really nice
It's okay
Just renting
Sue accepts her refilled glass and sits on the sofa
Thanks
So how long will you -- urn
She reaches down to fish under her ass in the sofa cushion, and pulls out a red checker
She dully inspects it
How long you gonna be here
Through the holidays
Sue flips the checker away
So what's the thing, you like kids
Fuck no
Whaddya think 'm some kind of pervert
Wha
'm talking about you being Santa
He sways, looking at her
Oh
No, see, the thing is
'm not really Santa
Blearily she gazes back
After a moment: Oh
(pause) Well -- still --  gotta thing for you anyway -- c'mere
He leans down to kiss her
'  -  - The door opens to reveal Sue on her way out
Willie sways in the foyer, a three-quarters-empty bottle of Old Grandad in hand
So 'll see you soon  guess, right
Yeah, 'm gonna send you some flowers
Real good expensive ones
He closes the door
He then tips back the bottle and polishes it off with a series of quick gulps
Ever so daintily, he puts the bottle down
beat later -- He faints dead away, hitting the floor like a felled tree
: Faintly, distantly, a blood-curdling scream
: '  - / - Willie wakes on the floor to the sound of the scream
Whuh
He looks blearily up and immediately grabs his head, feeling his hangover
Following his ears he heads toward the hall
He passes Grandma
Roger
You're home
Let me fix you some sandwiches
bedroom door crashes open and the Kid emerges screaming and runs right into Willie
He immediately caroms off and goes screaming down the hall
What the
He looks down at his -shirt
There is a bloody palm-print on his stomach
He turns the corner to the hall, There is a row of fresh, bloody palm-prints down one side of the hall
The Kid, screaming, is just disappearing at the far end
Willie follows
'  -  - Willie enters
The Kid is screaming, jumping up and down and clutching one hand -- the bloody one -- with the other
What the fuck did you do
He goes up and tries to yank the hand, which the hysterical Kid yanks away
Lemme look at it
What the fuck happened
As Willie drags him to the sink and runs water over the cut, the Kid takes great gulping breaths and finally manages to say: cut myself by mistake
Willie grabs a vodka bottle standing open on the counter and liberally pours some on the hand
The Kid shrieks
forgot to tell ya, that'll sting
Okay now
The Kid yanks his hand away and runs off screaming
Willie is left alone in the middle of the kitchen
Well fuck
He calls after the boy, sincerely trying to help: Don' t you want me to wrap it in a -shirt or something
-   - It is early morning and the parking lot is empty except for Marcus' van
The Mercedes eventually pulls in, parking beside him
Windows roll down
In the driver's seat, Marcus looks up from his watch with a scowl
You're late
Marcus throws open the back of the van, revealing the components of the water drill in various prop gift boxes
Willie wears a forbearing smile: Kids, lemmme tell ya
He shakes his head and chuckles as Marcus tosses him an empty red Santa sack
They'll run ya ragged
Marcus stares
' -  - Jesse, the security guard unlocks the door and opens up for Willie and Marcus
They enter in costume
Willie lugs the filled sack and seems to be straining
Morning boys
Morning Jesse
(to Willie) Ho
Ho
Ho
Willie pants under the weight of his bag: Up your ass
-   - As Willie and Marcus enter the store Gin Slagel drives by their cars, carefully noting their tags
' -   - Willie drops the bag with a loud thud
dammit
You tear your ball again
No, it's okay
Together they unload the extremely heavy gifts
Let's do the other thing
Willie follows Marcus behind the Wonderland backdrop
Marcus points to an air duct in the ceiling
There
Willie crouches and Marcus climbs on his shoulders
' -   - The duct pops open and Marcus climbs in, shimmying down to a junction and continuing on
' -    - long row of cubicles, each one occupied with Customer Service Operators
As they work, the loud squeaks and popping metal sounds of a dwarf crawling through a duct are heard above them
Each operator in succession notes the racket, looking up curiously as the sounds pass overhead
Suddenly, the sounds stop
Everyone returns to work
Then
The sounds resume
The operators look up again as the noises fade away
' -   - The sounds continue until Marcus' face appears at the ceiling duct of an unmanned surveillance room
He focuses on the wall of a hundred identical VCRs and squints to see the brand name:  -3200
- Lois exits an electronics store with a box slung under her arm, her mouth turned down in pruney disapproval
She places the box on the hood of her car and we see its printings -3200
She opens the box, fishes out the remote, then tosses the box and  into a nearby trash can
- Gin Slagel walks through the main gate of the heavily fortified penitentiary, leaving a huge trail of cigarette smoke
-   - Gin Slagel sits, smoking and waiting with family members and lawyers
guard enters and motions
Alright Gin, come on
- '  - Gin sits down in one of the booths across from a middle-aged prisoner
Who are you
Your name Roger Merman
Yes, but -- Doing three-to-six for embezzlement
Many accounting questions are not cut-and-dried -- You live at 41 Sage Terrace
(suddenly tense) Is it Granma
Is my son alright
They're fine
Do you have any house guests
The man is bewildered: House guests
Thanks much for your time
God bless
He gets up and walks away
Who are you
' -   - Gin sits at his desk sucking in a Pall Mall filterless
Bob Chipeska sits opposite
Finally Gin exhales like a crematorium
Well, it's fucked
(hopeful) Yeah
Yeah
Fucked
Frankly
He's
Clean
(disappointed) Oh
As a fuckin' whistle
Nothing
No
Nothing
mean, shit, he curses, yeah
But never around children
Oh
No criminal record, no parking tickets f'Christ's sake, no bad habits, even
Sex, yeah
But man is a sexual being
Yeah
Fuckin' Darwinian
Can't do shit about that, Jack
Wouldn't want to
Yeah
No
Of course not
'm not advocating celibacy
Hope not
End of the human fuckin' race
Yes
Gin turns one palm up
Fucks large women
What can  say
-   - bus clears frame, revealing the kid as he walks toward the mall
Loser
Dipshit
The kid is hit in the head with a can again
Again, no reaction
Someone in the group of frustrated bullies has a fresh idea: Wedgie
Cheering, the six bullies engulf the kid
' -   - Marcus and Willie go about the business of being a Santa-Elf team
Willie sees off another child, Pokemon
Done
Next
Marcus heads to the velvet rope to find the Kid, mussed up and dirty, the band of his underwear around his chest
Santa here
Oh jeez
Marcus unclips the rope and the Kid approaches Willie
Is that your underwear
Part of it
Where's the rest
Never mind
What do you want
was thinking  wanted a purple stuffed elephant, not pink, but now changed my mind
What
Now  don't want an elephant at all
want a gorilla named Davy for beating up the skateboard kids who pull on my underwear and he could take his orders from the talking walnut so it wouldn't be my bad thing
Willie stares at him
You know when  was your age, didn't need no fuckin' gorilla, and wasn't any bigger than you
One day  came crying home to Dad because four kids had beat me up, and you know what he did
' He make it all better
No
He kicked my ass
You know why
You went bathroom on Mommy's dishes
What the fuck
No
He try to teach you not to cry and be a man
Nope, it was because he was a mean, drunk son of a bitch
When he wasn't busy busting my ass, he was puttin' out cigarettes on my neck
Uh-huh
The world's fuckin' unfair -- it don't give ya nothing
You can wish all you want but you gotta take what you need
Stand up for yourself
stop being such a pussy and kick those kids in the balls or something
(pause) Or don't,  don't give a shit
Just leave me the hell out of it
'Kay
Thanks, Santa
Okay, go ahead
He slaps the Kid paternally on the ass
Get the fuck outta here
'Kay
As the Kid putters away: (happy again) Time for the next lucky boy or girl to -- Marcus returns to the velvet rope to find Gin Slagel waiting stone-faced
What gives
Where's the grandson
Open the rope there, Marcus
Marcus, wary, hesitates but then lets him through
As they walk toward Willie: know you
Not yet
Willie is irked by the arrival of an adult: Santa don't do grab-ass, cowboy
Act natural
Huh
What
Gin sits on Willie's knee
What the fuck
You are Willie Tugboat Soke and you are Marcus "The Prince" Skidmore
On Christmas Eve, you're gonna rob this store blind
What say we go somewhere private
- Willie, Marcus and Gin sit in a booth
Research, that's how
'm a department store detective Sherlock, that's what  do
Seven cities in seven years
Pretty impressive
The stores change, your names change
You always get away clean
Yeah, pretty darn impressive
But let's face facts -- you all are a couple of half-bucket small-timers
Because of your physical attributes you've found a niche respect that
But you've also been caught
By me
So this is the way how we gonna do things
don't want to take over,  don't even want to change your scam
Whatever you guys do, it works
All  want is a taste
When the deed is done, we part ways
buy a ranch in Havasu, you take your little medicine show back on the road
(sighs) How much
Half
Willie bolts out of his chair and grabs Gin by the neck
Now you listen here, you -- Marcus pulls him off
Easy
Easy
Just back off, Willie can handle this
After a hard stare Willie settles back into his seat
Marcus turns his attention to Gin: Okay
Thirty percent
There's three of us
Thirty percent
That's fair
Half
meant thirty-three
Half
And a third
Half
Thirty-five
Half
Forty
Half
Forty-two
Half
Forty-two five
Half
Fooooooorty
eight
Half
Forty-nine
Half
Well
Marcus sighs
what's one point
Down the middle on the dough, and any merchandise you take  look over and cherry-pick
No
Money's one thing, but -- It ain't Chinese menu, jagoff tell yea how the way it's gonna be
This is pricks ficks
Gin leaves
Marcus and Willie stare at his retreating back as they talk: Pricks ficks
Ah, he's a fuckin' moron
Yeah, well  guess that's how you got the upper hand
Fuck you
Negotiating
Fuck you -- you don't like it, next year, fuck off
can always get another box jockey
Yeah, and  can get another midget
Marcus turns to Willie: Yeah
Where
You see us hangin' off of fuckin' trees
Like fuckin' crab apples
And even if we did, you'd never front your own racket
'Cause you got no discipline and zero fuckin' initiative
You'd fall apart without me
You're just too fuckin' pathetic -- Yeah, yeah
-- too fuckin' pathetic for words, you fuckin' loser
And you fuckin' know it
'  - Willie drags his ass through the front door, dejected
Roger
You're home
Let me fix you some sandwiches
He stares at her
His gaze is far away
Finally, he seems to rouse himself: Ah, fuck it
'  -  - a hose snaking from an exhaust pipe to the driver's window which is open just far enough to admit it
In his Santa suit, Willie sits in the driver's seat of the idling car, staring through the windshield
After a long beat, we hear a door opening
The kid stands in the doorway from the house
He looks at Willie, motionless in the car
Santa
Willie's eyes do not leave the spot in space: Yeah
What're you doing
Ah, nothin'
You goin' to work today
Not really
You just gonna sit there
Yeah
Lemme alone
The Kid turns to go
Willie bestirs himself: -- Kid
Yeah
Willie beckons him
Later today, when the paramedics come and bag up Santa
He displays an envelope
make sure the cops get this letter
It tells about all the bad things that -- that -- what the fuck happened to your eye
The Kid's eye is indeed black and blue
He reaches self- consciously up to it
Umm
Well goddamnit
- We are pulling an eight-year-old child who rides his bicycle along the sidewalk, looking off, struck by what he sees
He slows and then comes to a stop having pulled even with a group of other children gathered on the sidewalk also looking off at the same spot
They stare for a good long beat, expressions rather neutral
But the sight, whatever it is, holds their attention
Finally one in the foreground remarks: didn't know he did that
Their : rather distant, on a grassy hill a man in a Santa suit is pounding the shit out of the bullies
One of the bullies throws a punch, but Santa grabs his fist and pushes him down
Santa puts his foot on another bully's butt and sends him flying
After more wrestling and flinging about, the bullies wind up in a heap on the ground
' -   - Willie, a faraway look in his eye, sits on a bench near Marcus, who is finishing putting on his elf outfit
think 've turned a corner
(absent) Yeah
You fucking Petites now
Willie, dreamy, refuses to take the bait: No no
No;  beat the crap out of some kids today -- but, you know, for a purpose
It really made me feel pretty good about myself -- like  did something constructive for a change
Accomplished somethin'
Marcus stares at him
You need many years of therapy
Many, many, many, many, many
many fucking years of therapy
' -   -  - Lois, her face set in pruney disapproval, flips slowly through a rack of furs
salesman approaches from behind her
She somehow senses his presence; without bothering to look around she murmurs: Just looking
'  - Willie and Sue come in, carrying a few bottles of liquor
Willie closes the door, and freezes, realizing that something is wrong
Hello
Nothing
Granma
He hears the  and heads for the living room
Sue follows a few steps behind
Willie finds Grandma in her chair, not moving
Granma
He strains through the dim light for any evidence of life
Oh jeez
He lets out a sigh and leans in close to listen to her heart
Oh my God
Roger
Willie jumps and screams like a girl
You're home
Let me fix you some sandwiches
She gets up and heads for the kitchen as Willie tries to compose himself
(holding his chest) No thanks
'  - '  - The Kid sleeps
He is awakened by the sounds of stumbling and
He hears , more
He gets up
''  -  - The Kid discovers some clothes
Then some more
He follows the trail of clothes towards the sounds coming from the Master Bedroom
'  -   - Facing the , Willie's in his underpants and Santa hat lying on the floor on top of Sue
He's gripping her panties with his teeth -- stretching the elastic while he starts pulling them down
Sue's giggling
The bedroom door opens behind them and the Kid walks in
He comes up and stands over them, a few steps behind Willie
Willie freezes, panty elastic waistband still stretched out in his teeth
He senses something, and his eyes look up from under his Santa hat, his wolfish smile fades
The Kid stands there, hands behind his back
(lifting her head up) Hello little boy
Hello
Santa
(frozen; teeth still gripping panties) yes
know that Christmas Eve is in a couple days and you have to fly around and give presents to the world and after that you won't be around no more
Yes
So  thought 'd give you your present now
The Kid takes his hands from behind his back and extends a small present in crudely taped-up wrapping paper
This forces Willie to let go of the panties
They  back
He sits up
He takes the gift and opens it
Inside is a roughly whittled crescent of brown wood
(mumble) What the fuck is it
wooden pickle
Willie stares at it
Why'd you paint it brown
Not paint
It's blood from when cut my hand when  was making it for you
Willie stares at it
Thanks
You're welcome
Good night Santa
Good night Mrs
Santa's sister
He leaves
Willie still stares at the gift
Sue is looking where the Kid exited
That was very nice
He's really a nice kid, isn't he
She goes back to grabbing him passionately
Willie has trouble speaking
Hold on a minute
What
Nothin'
it's just
'm
well
'm sorta
fucking
touched
He looks from the wooden pickle up to Sue, his eyes brim, and he starts weeping
don't know if  can fuck
Sue hugs him and strokes his hair
That's okay
That's okay
Willie abjectly bawls: ,  '
There, there
There, there
'  -  - Willie, hungover, half-dressed in his Santa outfit for work
He fumbles in the refrigerator for some orange juice
The Kid comes up behind him clutching a document
Willie jumps with a start
You wanna see my report card
Willie takes the report card as he tries to compose himself
He looks at it
All 's and one
Think  did good
Willie's eyes drift back to the card and settle on
They read, "Thurman has an active, inquiring mind
And no friends
" Who the fuck is Thurman
This is you
Your name's Thurman
Yeah
(incredulous) Thurman Merman
Yeah
Jesus
(back to the report card) You think  did good
Willie does not want to engage
Whaddya you care what  think, anyway
(pause, relenting a bit) What do  fuckin' know
Better than ever did
never got any 's, thought maybe since at least  did good in school, you'll bring me a present this year
'Cause last Christmas and the one before that you didn't bring no presents
This is a lot for Willie to hear
Oh
Even though 'm a dipshit loser
(a beat, then explodes) Jesus Fucking Christ, Kid
Why do talk about yourself like that
What the fuck is that about
What's with you anyway
ain't Fucking Santa Claus
Look at me,  am living fucking proof that there ain't no Santa Claus
Pause
know there's no Santa
just thought maybe you'd wanna give me a present 'cause we're friends
Oh
An uncomfortable silence
Willie is most uncomfortable
(pause, then sincerely to the kid) Look, kicking the shit out of those kids, that's as generous as  can get
The Kid just nods and doesn't say anything
Willie can't take it
, Willie runs out of the room very upset, '  -  - Willie grabs a bottle of whiskey off the counter and hurries out, slamming the door
' -   - Marcus checks his watch impatiently as the endless line of excited children and their parents impatiently murmurs
The tension is suffocating Marcus
Finally, a gasp goes up from the crowd
Marcus looks up to see Willie, totally shit-faced
His costume is half on, his undergarments are showing, and his hand clutches the neck of a broken bottle
No
Willie stumbles over a burro and falls into a pile of fake snow
He rises to his feet and begins to pummel the statue
You fuckin' spic
Children scream in horror as mothers cover their eyes
Gin enters the Wonderland and takes in the spectacle
Sweet Jews for Jesus
Willie finishes dispatching the burro and stumbles to his Santa chair
Marcus stomps up to him
Holy motherfuck
What do you think you're doing
(sobbing) pissed my pants
Marcus pounces on him
You son of a bitch
Gin pulls Marcus off
Alright, let's get him out of here
'll go smooth this over with Chipeska
Food poisoning, something
The two men face each other, their voices rising
Beyond them we see the line of children staring at them
What do you mean, get him out of here
Take him to his car
In case you hadn't noticed, 'm a motherfuckin' dwarf
So unless you got a forklift handy, maybe you should lend a hand
That figures, you wantin' all kinds of set-asides and special treatment 'cause of your handicap
You're all the same
Special treatment
'm three fucking feet tall, asshole -- it's a matter of physics
Draw me a sketch how get him to the car
Gin notices the line of kids staring
He puts up a sign that reads: "Santa Has Gone To Feed His Reindeer
He'll be back soon"
Bitch, bitch
Sketch it up, fuckin' moron
Fuckin' Leonardo da Vinci
What did you call me, thigh-high
called you a fuckin' guinea Homo
From the fifteenth fuckin' century
could stick you up my ass, smallfry
Yeah
You sure it ain't too sore from last night
You got some lip on you, midget
Well it was on your wife's pussy last night
Why don't you dust that thing once in a while
Asshole
'  -   - Marcus sits with Lois in the van staking out the door to Chamberlain's, waiting for Gin to leave
' -   - sleeps it off behind a flimsy cardboard set
'  -   - Marcus and Lois continue their stake-out
We see Gin exit the store and head for his car
There he is
that lousy, leatherfaced, dago motherfucker
- Marcus stands by the side of his van
It's parked on the shoulder with the hood up, jumper cables attached and hanging
Lois is in the driver's seat
Gin's Ford 4  4 speeds around the corner and Marcus flags him down
Gin slams on the brakes, then backs up and pulls over
He emerges from the 4  4 with road rage on full brew, and strides over to the van
Jesus, Mother Mary and Joseph
What in the name of the holy lord Fuck is the problem now
Sorry, the van stalled
Give us a jump will ya
Well, 'll be dipped in dogshit
What am , your auto mechanic now
He shakes his head in disgust
Grumbling, he goes back to the 4  4 and drives it into position
He gets out and raises the hood
The two vehicles face each other nose-to-nose, several feet apart as Gin opens the hood
(motions to his battery) Help yourself, small fry
Marcus seems to have a little difficulty reaching the battery terminals
It's hard for me to reach
Gin grabs the cables from him
Marcus takes a few steps back
Jesus Christ, give me those
Thanks
Gin attaches the cables
(then, to Lois) Alright,
Lois turns the key and the van starts right up
Gin takes the cables off the van and closes the hood
He lights up a Pall Mall
Marcus signals to Lois
She puts the car into gear and stomps her foot on the accelerator, squashing Gin between the two vehicles
( ): Gin's face as it's squooshed up against the van's windshield
cloud of cigarette smoke escapes his lips
Lois continues to step on the gas, trying to crush him
: the tires spinning in the gravel
Finally, she takes her foot off the gas
The van eases back
Gin falls to the ground with a groan
Marcus steps up and leans over him
Oh my, what a terrible accident
Is he dead
No, but it looks like you broke most of his ribs
Then, leaning down to Gin
(for Gin's benefit) 'd say maybe
fifty percent of them
Or do you think thirty percent
needed more of a running start -- couldn't build up any speed
Marcus paces around trying to figure out what to do next
(shaking his head in dismay) Motherfuck
He grabs the jumper cables still connected to Gin's 4  4 and clamps the other ends on Gin's ears
small jolt and a spark or two
Only a minor shock
Shit
He grabs Gin's arm and with great effort drags him over a few feet so that his head is positioned behind the front tire of the van
Gin tries to crawl out of the way
: Gin's feet slipping on the gravel
Put it in reverse
: shift level moving into
: Lois' foot stepping on the gas pedal
: Lois drives backwards
There's a bump and the sound of a dull
: ' -   - -:  large bubble gum bubble pops
Willie, in a self-medicated stupor, barely managing to hold a wailing toddler on his lap
Bubble gum is all over the Kid's face
'Tendo it is
He passes the child off to Marcus, who holds it as Willie gazes off and murmurs; Everything  touch turns to shit and dies
Marcus, still holding the child, quickly glances around, and then hisses into Willie's ear: What are you, drinking Sterno now
'Cause you're sounding like my Aunt Tilly right before she smeared her own shit on the bedroom walls and we had to lock her up and she spent the rest of her life with a shaved head and eating lunch through a tube up her nose
Willie continues to stare, head swaying
You better be in shape by this evening, fat man
After tonight, don't give a shit
But this is the time to reach deep down and suck it up
Marcus hands the kid to his Mother
He smiles warmly
Lovely boy
- "Jolly Old Saint Nicholas" plays as a buzzing throng of people crams the mall
One current in this sea of humanity flows into the bedecked entrance of Chamberlain's Department Store
' -  - Jesse the security guard is at his post near the doors to the parking lot
He smiles and waves farewell to departing shoppers
(
) Attention shoppers, the store will be closing in five minutes
We wish you all a Merry Christmas, Happy Chanukah and a joyous Kwanza
Behind Jesse, in Men's Wear, is Lois, wearing a frown of pruney disapproval
Seeing that he's not looking, she inexplicably nudges a table of sweaters a few feet over
The table makes a loud noise, but it's too chaotic on the floor for anyone to notice
Satisfied with her placement of the table, Lois heads out the door
' -   - Bleary-eyed Willie puts down a little girl and she happily scampers off
Barbie it is
Willie turns to Marcus
That it
Marcus moves the backdrop to reveal the air vent
Let's go
Willie cracks open an ampule of Amyl Nitrate and inhales deeply
Marcus grimaces: Oh Christ
(red-faced, holding breath) Let's do it
' -   - With the sound of closing circuits, banks of light systematically shut down in the various departments of the now empty
store
' -  - Exhausted employees file out of the store past Jesse
Eventually Willie emerges
Merry Christmas, Willie
Up your ass
Jesse heads for the alarm panel near the doorway and punches the key labeled
An  readout labeled  counts down from 30 seconds
Jesse exits the store, locking the door and heading home
' -    - The cubicles are now empty and the office is still, but we hear dwarf-shimmy in the ducts overhead
'  - By the front door, the alarm continues to count down -- 25
24
' -   - Marcus arrives at the vent above the surveillance room
He reaches in his pocket, pulls out the remote control Lois bought, and aims it down into the room
' -   - The huge bank of VCRs powers down
'  - 19
18
' -   - Marcus arrives at the precipice of a descending duct
He snaps on a biking helmet and takes a deep breath
All right
He dives down the duct
' -   - We  and - along the outside of several lengths of ductwork, following the muffled  of a thousand girlies echoing inside
The ductwork dimples out along the bottom with the sound of flopping aluminum as Marcus's weight travels its length; at turns, Marcus's inertial force makes one side of the duct momentarily dent out
We thus follow Marcus's progress as he slides, bumps, ricochets and barrels through the department store
' -   -  - As the alarm continues to count down, 12
11
a distant scream grows louder until -- -- in nearby Men's Wear, the vent in the 30-foot ceiling bursts open and -- -- Marcus drops from the duct
He lands on the table of sweaters placed by Lois
In a split-second, he sits up and looks at the alarm box
7
6
He hops off the table and pushes it toward the alarm box
5
4
The far side of the table smashes into the wall beneath the alarm box
Marcus kicks out the collapsible legs on the near side, making that edge of the table crash to the ground, creating a ramp
He sprints away from the table spins, and runs back towards it
3
2
He runs up the ramp and -- 1
-- leaps and slaps the  button -- just in time
' -  - Elevator doors open to reveal Willie and Marcus holding sections of the disassembled water drill
' -   - The lights flicker on in the accounting office as Willie and Marcus wheel the water drill over to the safe
Once they get it there: Oh shit
What
What-What--
It's a Kitnerboy Redoubt
So
Willie stares at the safe
You know Andy Pitts
Yeah, Andy Pizzarelli
No, Andy Lapitski
Andy Pizzarelli is Andy Blue Balls
Huh-uh, since he got married they call him An -- ' Andy Lapitski can get into anything
Anything
They say he's been in Margaret Thatcher's pussy
Yeah
In the joint he told me that the Kitnerboy
He nods at the safe
cannot be cracked
' '
Are you tellin' me after 've propped you up and held you together and smiled for all those kids and danced for all those fucking housewives in a fucking lime-green fucking velvet elf costume Willie continues to stare at the safe
He licks his lips
No
'm saying it's gonna take me a minute
' -  - Willie stares at the safe while rubbing sandpaper to his fingertips
Meanwhile, Marcus emerges from a stockroom with a cart to begin his shopping spree
Willie applies a stethoscope to the safe, tapping with one hand and listening intently
Marcus starts in Ladies' Accessories, finding the cashmere scarf
Willie applies the drill to the safe
Marcus makes his way through Lingerie
Willie pulls back the drill
The bit is trashed, the safe is completely unscathed
Marcus is in Shoes picking out pumps for Lois
Willie is in Home Improvement, flipping tools off the shelves into a cart of his own
Marcus is in Evening Wear, jumping to try to pull a stole off a mannequin
Willie batters a chisel into the seam of the safe door
Marcus continues to leap at the mannequin
Willie is atop the safe, swinging a sledgehammer at the lock
Marcus swings at the mannequin's knees with a golf club
Willie uses a plasma welder on the safe
Marcus, having chopped down the mannequin, drags off its stole
Willie is back over the safe, battering it with the sledgehammer, roaring with each swing
Marcus is in Housewares pilfering crock pots
Willie, sweating, drops the sledgehammer clanking to the floor
Wiping his forehead, he circles the safe
When he gets to the back of the safe he stops, thinks
Marcus is in Home Entertainment grabbing a stereo
Willie is hunched at the back of the safe, stethoscope to its surface, giving exploratory taps with two knuckles
Sound perspective through the stethoscope: hollow followed by an unnaturally loud and present
Willie reacts quizzically
After a considering moment he rises
we can see, on the far side of the safe, its door as it finishes creaking open
Marcus enters the room
Willie looks at him
Piece of cake
Marcus starts removing stacks of cash and loading them into the Santa sack
Willie wipes sweat off his forehead
'll be right back
gotta grab one thing
' -
- We are looking at a big, fuzzy, smiling, pink stuffed elephant
Willie's hand hesitates between this elephant and the one behind, which is purple
We hear him muttering: Shit
which did he say
The hand finally leaves with the purple elephant
We hold for a long beat
The hand reenters to put back the purple and take the pink
Willie turns around holding the stuffed elephant
Marcus and Lois are standing there presenting a grotesque picture: Lois has a shopping cart filled with shoes, scarves, jewels, a salad spinner, purses, a block of Ginsu knives, an abdomen exerciser
She wears a pair of sunglasses from which a price tag dangles, and a long ermine stole
Next to her Marcus holds the Santa bag bulging with -- indeed, sprouting -- cash
Well,  don't think that store dick is gonna want this
Store dick don't want shit
Something in this picture makes Willie uneasy
He licks his lips
Wuddya mean, fucking guy's greedier than
He pauses, searching
greedier than fuck
Marcus and Lois are statues, staring at him
Store dick dead
Store dick don't want shit
long silence
Fuck the fuckin' store dick
Willie's tone is wooden: Dead, huh
Again, he licks his lips
didn't even know he was sick
Marcus flicks his coat front away and pulls a
45 out of his waistband
Willie
This has been a long time comin'
Uh-huh
Every year you're worse
Every year, less reliable
More booze
More bullshit
More butt-fucking
Sure
The three 'a
You gotta be able to rely, Willie
He primes the gun
Willie murmurs, more in sadness than in fear: You're monsters
Marcus points the gun
Believe me, Willie: there's no joy in this for me
Oh,  don't mean layin' me out understand that
But just look at ya
All the shit
grabbin' all this shit -- do you really need all this junk
This is Christmas
Marcus sneers: Oh please
Don't gimme that trite "commercialism" crap
This is what we do, Willie
We get the shit
Christmas time, we get the shit
Because we are men
And Lois
It is Christmas, Willie, and we are men, and Lois
silence
Wuddya waitin' for, honey
Plug him
Marcus sighs
Good-bye, Willie
He aims
Willie squeezes his eyes shut
From nowhere: (
) Drop the gun, munchkin
Huh
-- the sound of many guns priming
Police everywhere
And you, Santa
-- drop the elephant
Willie stares
Marcus looks wildly around
Where did you come from
Tipped off
Shit
Willie slaps his forehead
Fuckin' kid
All three of you are in so much shit it's almost unbelievable
Gevalt
Oh yeah
Well come'n get us, coppers
Ha-ha-ha-ha
His
45 roars
The cops return fire
Fuck me
He ducks, clutching the elephant to his chest, and scurries behind a counter
fuck me fuck me fuck me
Gunfire fills the air
Exploding merchandise chases along the counter behind Willie as the cops seek to put him down
Under the gunfire we hear Marcus's maniacal laughter
Willie reaches the end of the counter
brief open space separates him from a stairwell; he dashes across as gunfire redoubles and plunges down the stairs
' -   - Willie bursts out onto the loading dock still holding the elephant
He dives into his Mercedes and peels out
-   - Rounding the corner of the loading dock, Willie comes upon a fleet of squad cars idling in the street
Cops yell, draw their guns and fire as Willie clips a couple cars, skids and slues, and finally is clear of the pack
He roars up the road as policemen leap for their vehicles, crank up their sirens and pursue
-  - Willie drives, his jaw set, a desperate man in a Santa suit
He glances up at the rearview which shows many flashing light bars
It's Christmas
and the fucking kid is getting his present
'  -  - Willie's car corners onto Sage Terrace on two wheels, slams back down onto four, fishtails up to the kid's house and squeals braking into its driveway
The police vehicles, in hot pursuit, squeal, skid, and slew around in a jumble at the foot of the lawn
Cops leap out of their cars just as Willie jumps from his
Halt, put your hands up
Willie is sprinting up the walk toward the front door
His voice echoes lone and weak after the boom of the megaphone: Up your ass
He bounds up the stoop
All right, boys -- nail him
ripple of gunfire
At the top of the stoop, facing the door, Willie staggers, rolls his eyes, and -- drops
Drawn by the noise, an adorable six-year-old in a nearby house slides open his second-story bedroom window to look
: Frozen in a semi-circle at the foot of the neighboring lawn, an army of cops has guns trained on the felled Santa Claus, who is sprawled on the neighbor's stoop, motionless
His hand stretches toward the front door holding a fluffy pink elephant un-delivered
The six year old draws in his breath and
He is joined by his equally adorable little brother and sister who look, and , with him
Somewhere, a neighborhood dog barks
Cop looks up at the window and the three shrieking children
Somebody put a zipper on those fuckin' kids
: '  - After a long beat, Willie's voice: (
) Dear kid
hope that you got my present and that there wasn't too much blood on it, although there was blood on the present you gave me which didn't keep me from enjoying it, so maybe the blood doesn't matter so much  guess
We are   on a shelf in the Kid's bedroom where the stuffed elephant sits, in a place of honor, its fur indeed stiff and stained with dried blood
The Kid's bedroom is no longer in disarray, things are neat and comfy
We   of it to find this letter, crudely handwritten, tacked up on a little bulletin board
(
) Anyway, just in case they took it as evidence  am also sending you a -shirt
hope it's the right size
am healing up good and they tell me that  will soon be one hundred percent even with eight bullets dug out of me because they didn't hit any vital organs, just my liver which is fucked anyway, ha-ha-ha
Anyways
Our   brings us to the open door of the bedroom and we hear the sound of the  in the living room
We toward it
(
) Thank you for giving that letter to the cops
forgot  asked you to do it but it's a good thing you did or Santa's little helper would've plugged his ass
And now the cops know  wrote it, which is gonna keep my ass out of jail
That, plus everyone agreeing that the Phoenix police department shooting an unarmed Santa was even more fucked-up than Rodney King
The cops are treating me like fucking royalty now which is new in my experience
They are gonna make me a sensitivity counselor so that tragedies like this will never again embarrass the whole fucking department
Whatever
Grandma is in the living room watching
We  past her towards the Jacuzzi area
As for my little helper,  am sorry to have to tell you that him and his prune-faced mail-order-wife are gonna be exploring mountains with your dad
hope your dad doesn't go sucking shit from them like did
Meanwhile,  told the cops you had no one to take the fuck care of you, so they set it up with Mrs
Santa's sister watching you till your Dad gets back in one year and three months
They made her a Guardian Pro-Temp or some such shit
anyway, she makes better money than bartending and seems to like you and your house and Jacuzzi
Sue is in a towel, holding a highball as she climbs out of the Jacuzzi
The Kid walks by her carrying a bucket
She tousles his hair affectionately as he goes by
He's never looked better
It's empty but the front door is open
We  towards it
We go out the front door
(
) So 'll be staying in Phoenix now, telling the police how screwed- up they are which is not a bad job as jobs go
They're supposed to let me out of this hospital room soon so 'll see you when  come over to fuck Mrs
Santa's sister in the Jacuzzi
Until then, don't take no shit from nobody
Least of all yourself
Anyways
see ya soon
The Kid is dipping a toilet-bowl brush into a bucket of soapy water on the front stoop
(
) Santa
