Lowrey unfortunately looks and takes a hard fist across the ear from the dealer
Angered, Lowrey swings his pistol up underneath the perp's jaw and knocks him through the bathroom door
Lowrey cuffs him to the sink
Meanwhile

He's still got his gun in hand
But the other dealer has him pinned underneath the legs of a chair

Burnett stomps the bad guy's instep

Uniformed cops move in   to assist

Casper, Ferguson, and   Noah behind him, all wearing high-tech miner's helmets  with built-in radio headsets, and an array of high-tech  tools

The team crosses the roof to a huge air conditioning unit
They climb inside, carrying a six-foot-long metal case and what looks like a black scuba tank

From a prone position, Fouchet puts on his night vision goggles and reveals a palm top computer
Quickly he scrolls through the labyrinthine schematics loaded onto the unit
to see the various ducts
Endless
Bottomless
But clearly, Fouchet's a man who knows his way

He cuts loose a silent round that strikes 'Fee at the base of the neck
'Fee stops
But before he can think to reach back at what hit him, his knees buckle and he drops to the linoleum
Out cold

Meanwhile -- 24                                                 24 Noah removes what looks like a flattened bobsled with large urethane wheels from the metal case and places it inside the air shaft
Ferguson attaches the black "scuba tank," labeled " ," to a valve
This is connected to a metal-cased cable system that is piston-gunned into the floor

Once they're done, we hear  , then the sled is cabled to the con- traption

He sits up, carefully, holds his aching head
Hearing , Lowrey lifts the sheet next to him
The one from the Colony Hotel
He drops the sheet back over her head, reaches over to his nightstand and grabs an industrial-sized bottle of Excedrin
Empty

Confused, he pulls open the shower curtain slightly
From the back, it's an incredible body, then she turns around and it's -- Yes
The very same as the one he just saw in bed

Frowns at this impossibility
He steps back into the doorway and peers over at his bed
Yep, same face

Well,  got the time

There's the two-and-a-half-year-old, , who's taking bites of food and spitting it back out, looking at it, then putting it back in
Six-year- old , who is playing refrigerator magnet games on the fridge
And Marcus in the middle of it all, deftly side- stepping his eight-year-old boy, , who appears on roller blades whizzing through with a hockey stick and ball
He body-checks Jill against the ice box
Mom, Quincy pushed me
Uncle Mike showed me that move
Quincy, never-you-mind
And take those things off in the house
Jill, stop with the book and eat your breakfast
(then, exasperated) Marcus, why do  always have to discipline the kids
You play bad cop for a second
Alongside the kitchen screen door we see Lowrey's to a stop in the driveway
Kids, knock it off
or your momma's gonna whoop your butts
Theresa laughs in spite of herself as the kids continue to fight
Into this craziness enters Mike Lowrey
Ah, family life
Reminds me why  stay single

You're live with Lowrey

When are you gonna do something about this
Hey, Dick
How many times  gotta tell you
don't work robbery

Meanwhile, Lowrey's holding the car door open as the kids pile into the jump seat in the back
Don't get your sticky fingers all over my windows
and keep your feet off the seats,  just had the leather conditioned
The kids ignore him, gleefully continuing to squirm around
Before Burnett can get into the car, Theresa runs out
Marcus

Problem is, the building is nothing but cops and it looks as if the entire department is stomping all over the evidence room

Both laugh hysterically, while: If it ain't the leftovers from Miami Vice
Fashion casualties, lost somewhere in the eighties
And the women really go for that
Really, they do
As Burnett and Lowrey duck the tape, they note a very groggy 'Fee over in the corner being attended by a paramedic team
He's still out cold

The room is emptied
Captain  appears
He's short, has a military haircut, and has a minor Napoleon complex and a major in paranoia
Nice of you to roll in
And nothing particular is going on around here except, maybe, your dope is gone
That's right
The biggest dope bust in the history of this department up and walked out of this locker, along with maybe my job and the two of yours if we don't get the shit back
This can't be happening

Since it was originally your case, you two guys are on point
Sanchez and Ruiz, you back them up with whatever they need
Groans all around
So  guess we should start with the
s and the perps from the original case
But hell if know any dope dealers with the balls to pull this off
They're either dead or in the lock-up pending trial
How's 'Fee
(
) Oh, he'll be just fine
From the side appears a cigar-chewing Internal Affairs suit named
He circles close to Burnett and Lowrey, waving his cigar as he speaks
Name's Sinclair
Internal Affairs
He's our new proctologist
You see, what's got me confused is, why risk leaving a witness
Why not kill 'Fee instead
Because maybe this guy knows if you kill a cop the whole department'll get up his ass hard and fast
And who knows that better than anybody else
Cops
You're not sayin' this was an inside job
Cops wouldn't pull this shit

And most importantly, you've got the connections

Hey, fuck you and your cheap, off- the-rack suit
Enough

If any of this leaks, the shit's gonna hit our biggest fan
Remember him
The mayor
He created us and you can bet your jobs, boys, he'll rip us into little cop pieces
figure we got seventy-two hours to find the dope and keep our jobs
Nothing like a little old-fashioned incentive
He walks to the center of the room and kneels to those four bolt holes in the floor
He fingers the paraffin filler, then looks above to the air conditioning grate
What about the air conditioning
So what about it

think you should go ahead, crawl up and give it a good look

The first thing Burnett notices are the track marks from the bobsled cutting through a coating of dust
Anything
Yeah
got some weird track marks in here
Then Burnett notes a manufacturing stamp at the joint
It reads:    ,

There's gonna be a lotta cash when the dope hits the street
We want you to put the word out through your bank and hustle the account
You help us, maybe we can see about getting those
auditors off your ass
Listen, Cedras
You and  both know you're the number one importer for the Simona Brothers

Curves and sweat, any way you look

And while Lowrey cruises amongst the sweaty flesh as if it were a day in the park, Burnett lags

Oooh

The other girls are suddenly interested, too
Burnett swallows and
You know
'm a cop
shot somebody just last week
Didn't kill him, just shot him in the ass
Stone cold looks from them all
They walk away with Burnett giving a "what did  say" look
Lowrey appears
You know, that was really smooth
Think you could do that again
(as they start walking) Ohh
'll tell you, when the wife gets meaner, the grass gets greener
Green ain't the color  was thinkin' of
More of a coco puff
Just real shiny, thick

(complies) Miami's the perfect town for you, Burnett
You drive like a one- hundred-seven-year-old lady with her turn signal on
And  plan on living to be old just like 'em
Rubbin' Ben Gay on my joints and everythin'
An old guy passes them even though his car is pulling an Airstream camper behind it
Lowrey can't believe it
You gonna let every old motherfucker pass you
Or just the ones with big-ass trailers draggin' behind
-c-c-el-er-ate
don't have a death wish like you
got a family that counts on me
mortgage to pay
And 'm not sayin' it's me, but most of the guys in the station think you're some rich kid playin' cop
Who said that
Burnett mumbles an answer
If somebody's talking about me, wanna know
Man, 'm so sick of this
don't apologize for nothing  do
get up early and take it to the max every day
'm always the first guy through the door
And the last guy to leave a crime scene

Now what
sickened Burnett goes over to the body, speaking to Orona as if he were alive
Where are the drugs

drugs

He must be guilty of somethin'
Meanwhile, Lowrey's got   no problem with the dead body
He tries opening a desk   drawer, but Orona's rigor mortis- stiffened knee is in the   way
So Lowrey gives it a shove and the chair swivels
Orona's dead arm sweeps the lamp off the desk

Eddie's pouring champagne into a glass
Max, my little carina
It's been a long time
And who's your friend
Eddie
Julie
Julie sizes him up
Good taste
His suit
Bad taste
His personality
Come on, Julie
Come in, Max
Welcome to the Al Capone suite
Thev're stepped into a grand, opulent suite
High arched ceilings
Magnificent antique furniture
Killer view
No party guests
'm not kidding
Capone had the place fixed up with secret passages and hidden stairways
Can you dig it
People were actually killed within these walls
He's moved behind them and reveals a concealed staircase that rises into darkness
Not happy
Stuck at the Biltmore with a Scarface wannabe
She looks over at Max
Let's get outta here
Excuse me
need to use the bathroom

Wow, Maxi

We can party
Just us three
Look at what Eddie's got to play with
From underneath the couch Eddie reveals a single key of heroin
Max tries to hide the recognition that she just hit paydirt on the very first try

Instinctively, Julie peers through the louvered shades
61   '  -                                 61 She sees Eddie opening the door to Fouchet
Casper and Noah follow him inside

Who's the girl, Eddie
Just a hooker -- My name's Max

could use a friend who looks like you
Turn around

Max tries to size this man, then chooses to submit

: 64
64 Now, Fouchet swings the gun onto Eddie
You're a fucking idiot
Hookers talk
Now, is that my dope
(freaked) Our dope
That was the deal, yeah
Right
Until we got the money -- Fouchet  Eddie in the knee
Eddie screams

When it's done you get your money
Now, what part don't you understand

You need me

There's no way out of the bathroom
All she can do is switch off the light
And now she sees Casper's shadow as he approaches
As it turns
Julie suddenly reaches for it and pulls open the door with a surge
Casper stumbles in, his face hitting the hard tile with a crunch
66
-                                   66 Making her move, she hauls as fast as she can across the room
Aiming for that secret fireplace door
Wheels with his , unloads the clip
are catching up, ripping up the couch and the rest of the suite
Julie dives right into the secret door

Twisting
We   Julie as she races through it, heart in her throat

Turns to see -- 69

Jump or die
As they try running across the harsh-tiled roof
Now look
My fuckin' shoes
My fuckin' Italian shoes
Then Julie prays silently, takes a running start and leaps from the roof

The water swirls as her aching body struggles to the surface

She's dazed and confused, but alive -- for the moment

-                                73 Fouchet reaches down and picks up Max's purse, then flicks it across the room to the defeated pair of Casper and Noah

Chief Howard is conferring with a technician who's dusting for prints

But Sanchez and Ruiz are already on the scene
You guys watch where you're walking or you'll fuck up the crime scene

Burnett's quick to point out the trail of bloody foot- prints Ruiz just tracked across the carpet
Which Julie left on the fireplace mantel
Lowrey's quick to note the two separate shades of lipstick
Two dead
hood registered as Eddie Dominguez and some Jane Doe
But the table over there's covered in high-grade dope
Sound familiar

Over here     got two different shades of    lipstick on one champagne    glass

What
Who is it
Lowrey instintively pushes past his partner and kneels at the body
He pulls back the sheet
Right now he could kill the shooter, then himself
In that order
Lowrey's eyes well up

He flashes a badge
You pay the bill you can see his phone calls

can't be Lowrey
Shut up and listen
She'll only talk to Lowrey
She says she's our witness
That means she's our only link to the dope, not to mention my pension plan, so get on the phone
Burnett accepts the phone
Hand over the receiver, he does a quick Lowrey impression that starts as lame and ends pretty damn convincing
Yo, you are live with Lowrey

How do  know it's Detective Lowrey

Yes

Julie swings for real, nearly taking Burnett's head off

Okay
So  exaggerated
It's a man thing
She swings again, but he's had enough, he moves quickly, catching the bat with his hand and ripping it away from her

What else did he say
Somethin' weird
Sounded like three angels
He wasn't worried because he had three little angels on his shoulders tellin' him something
didn't get the rest
(back to the mug shots) 'm getting tired of looking at ugly people
Just a few more and we can take another break
don't wanna take a break
Then we'd have to talk and  got nothing to say to a cannibal

That was a living, breathing consciousness
It felt joy
Sadness
Maybe it even had a name
What had a name
That flesh you're shoveling into your mouth
(stops chewing) It's just bologna
It was alive
Some farmer  fed it
Got it to trust him
Then  blew its brains out, dumped it in a cement mixer with a ton of carcinogens and now you're   eating it

No
At least finish it so won't have to look at it

It foams
Julie appears with a pile of clean laundry in    hand
Your dog took a shit
And you used Pledge to clean it up

Well, that makes a big difference
You just varnished that into the fabric

If you were my husband, 'd poison that
If you were my wife 'd drink it
Twelve years 'm married, Michael
And  never let Marcus bring his work home
Just a harmless bedtime story

We don't need any violence in this household and we certainly don't need any more heroes
What we need is a father and a husband

Both Burnett and Casper go sliding across the wet floor and into a stall -- both reaching for the gun
Burnett's there a second too late
Casper's got the gun
He swings it onto Burnett and squeezes the trigger
But nothing happens
Burnett in turn, grabs Casper's ears and hammers the big guy's head into the toilet until he falls unconscious
Burnett picks up his gun

He looks defeated, grass stains on his clothes, mussed hair
And here comes Chet
'Evening, Mr
Lowrey
May  have a word with you

maybe could see your gun
See, we don't allow guns up in the apartments
Mr
Lowrey usually checks his, here, at the desk with me
You want me to check yours
Burnett pulls his gun
But doesn't hand it to Chet

His face is horribly bruised
He says he wants his lawyer

Okay
All  know is his name
Foo-shay,  think
Got this heavy French accent
The word was he offs drug dealers
And there was quick cash for whoever had the balls enough to hook up with him

Burnett stands over the Henchman and lifts his defeated chin to face him
Burnett has it in him to give the guy one more hard whack for good measure, but that bruised face proves punishment enough
Yeah

Each is clearly tired of the other
The silence is deadly until Julie breaks the silence
So where's the coffee and donuts
What
thought that was the usual menu when cops were on stakeout little caffeine for the heart
Some sugar-coated dough fried in day old grease
Man
Will you get off this
You're making me sick
Oh, 'm sorry, Marcus
All     these hours on the case, you must    miss Theresa's home cooking
(near Lowrey's ear) Bet last night she fixed you    up something yummy and left it    in the microwave for you
Burnett starts to steam
Yeah
Somethin' yummy
imagine there was something yummy waiting for you when you finally made it to bed -- (wheels) Listen, lady -- But Burnett's face    ignites with headlights at their rear
Doors open
Lowrey checks the rear-view mirror

After tomorrow we might need 'em for a job reference
Lowrey rolls down his driver's window in time to hear
Well, what do we have back here
Looks like we got us two pimps and a hooker
Hey, fellahs
Maybe if she does us both we'll let you leave with your pride intact
Excuse me
One moment
(rolls up the window) Let's fuck with these bozos
Burnett nods his approval
Lowrey lowers the window
Now, where were we
Outta the car
Hands where we can see 'em
Feet spread
Both hobby cops open the doors for Lowrey and Burnett respectively
Looks pass between them as they step out and assume the positions
And Towne starts by frisking Burnett's shoulders
Oh, that's not how you frisk a potential lawbreaker
You gotta start at the waistband
See if he's carrying a piece
Towne stalls a beat, then self-consciously goes to Burnett's waistband where he feels a -- Gun
Both hobby cops instantly withdraw, their own pieces drawn and leveled on Burnett and Lowrey

You better watch it, fellahs
(very slowly) You know, it would be very bad if you shot and killed two helpless pimps and a call girl
But it would be even worse if you shot two policemen and their witness on a stakeout
Looks pass between the hobby cops
(slowly turns) Now 'm reaching slowly for my shield
very slowly
here it comes
just about got it
(reveals his badge) Ooh, look at that
It's a detective's shield
All gold and shiny
smart fellah wouldn't fuck with somebody who had one of these in his pocket
So
Let's see
guess that makes us policemen
And you
Not
He shows his shield
Both hobby cops lower their guns, unsure about what's next
Burnett moves in
Now, some rent-a-cops have licenses to carry weapons,  where others do not
Which might   you be
You wouldn't happen to   have those permits handy, would  you
From the looks on the hobby cops' faces, Julie can see that they don't
