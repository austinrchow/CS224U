(

Rabbit's home
Rolling out of its bank, the bomber begins a steep climb revealing the fact that it is carrying a small delta winged shuttle on it back
The bomber's wings slide back
(

Understand we are go for crossbow
Suddenly a rocket engine on the back of the modified bomber fires thrusting the plane into steep climb
-1  - The pilot and co-pilot are busy in their seats
Behind them sits a third pilot wearing a space suit
He gives them a thumbs-up signal, rises and crawls to the rear
(into the mike/ over the roar) Watchdog, Slingshot
let us know when the rabbit's in the hole
- blond haired, blue-eyed man with a small walkie-talkie is standing in the midst of a group of cheering Central American peasants and townsfolk
He is disguised as one of them
The uniformed President of this formerly sleepy, now strategically critical nation is waving to his people
He is flanked by military guards
He turns and walks into the villa
-1 - The bomber approaches the top of it's arc
The shuttle pilot climbs into his seat, straps in and checks his instruments
All systems check
Crossbow is armed
(
) Roger, Ignition sequence, start, separation in five
The explosive bolts blow on the shuttle mount
The pilot pushes his yolk forward
As the bomber falls way, the shuttle's booster ignites with a roar, thrusting it toward space
- We see a tiny glowing speck coming towards us
very quickly it gains in altitude and we see that it is the shuttle
Suddenly it is upon us and blasts over our heads
We follow the shuttle
The engine stops
There is a small explosion, which pushes the booster rocket away
Small maneuvering rockets fire and the shuttle establishes itself in a nose down altitude
(
) Crossbow is established
(
/) Roger, we have ground confirmation
Reference grid seven
Check pathfinder, on
(
) Roger, 'm going on the scope
Moving Target Indicator, engage
Behind and above the cockpit a large hatch opens and a large circular spinning mirror rises and locks into position
The pilot reaches above him and pulls down a viewfinder and begins looking through it
target sighting lens moves from right to left, stops, and then moves back but this time with the mirror moving in unison
While still looking through the viewfinder, the pilot manipulates the targeting controls
' Crosshairs, a grid patter and digital, rangefinder readouts appear over various parts of the Earth's topography as the pilot searches for his target
Then it steadies on a polarized image of a group of people
One of the images seems to stand out brighter than the others
- The president and his aide are chatting with a group of visiting dignitaries
There is a jovial atmosphere as they order drinks from a waiter
The president is proudly displaying one of his medals to his guests
it has a very unique jewel-like object in its middle
The pilot is watching through the viewfinder
(into mike) Scanner on
Target locked
Tracking locked
The mirror and sighting lens adjust as they track the target
The President is served a cup of coffee
He asks the waiter for sugar
The waiter turns back to his cart
The pilot puts his hands on the joysticks and flips open the trigger covers
Nice and easy does it
Dead silence, then the mirror erupts in brilliant light and sends an incredibly bright beam toward the Earth
Behind the shuttle we see exhaust gases venting in giant plumes into space
The beam strikes the president like the finger of god
He vaporizes
The waiter turns back with the asked-for sugar to find a smoking hole where the President once stood
The shuttle finishes its work and the beam shuts down
The mirror folds away and the shuttle arcs across the screen preparing for re-entry, firing small retro rockets

Just like shooting ducks in a barrel

There's no defense like a good offense
In the middle of the room is a giant donut of a round conference table
Another circle hangs above and casts light downward in such a way as to light the table-top but caser those sitting around it in shadow
We can see them but not well
There are   in suits

The lighting does not change
he turns to the man sitting at twelve o'clock
Nice little weapon isn't it, Dave
Well,  guess so, but gosh, Don, it's a movie
You want me to start buying weapons from George Lucas
Polite laughter all around
Now that would be somethin', wouldn't it
Well, sometimes  think  might as well
(to one of the others) What do you think of what you saw, Roy
think there weren't enough girls
More polite laughter
Then Roy turns ice cold in a flash
(cont'd) Is this thing for biological targets only
No, Sir, this thing would take the skin right off, of Air Force One if you wanted
Not that 'm saying we'd ever want to kill our own President, but, you know, for example
Our studies indicate that this type of weapon is totally useless for warfare
It's not intended for use in your kind of warfare, Roy
This is a perfect peace time weapon
What's the kill potential
As soon as the size-to power ratio is licked we'll have about seven bangs for the buck
When that
Carmichael shrugs the sign for "who knows
" Seriously, Don,  have to report to the Secretary that everything's on schedule
We have plans for your little ray's gun this summer
(Trying to cover) As  understand it, guys, there's some major practical difficulties
'm pushing as hard as  can
Well, Don, you tell those geniuses you've got until the end of the next fiscal quarter to come up with a working model or 'm pulling the plug on the funding
(very nervous) 'm assured they're on the verge of a major breakthrough
Good
Just as long as we get a working weapon out of it by June
Right, general

haven't had a working weapon since Korea

Are you Dr
Atherton
Yes, dear
just love your television show
Well, thank you
We try
What's Albert Einstein really like

Oh,  thought you had him on
No, that was just an actor
Is everyone an actor, then

He walks away
a booth where we meet  , aged fifteen
Mitch is a genius
He's known that since he was old enough to understand the word, which was on his first birthday
He was doing college level work by the time he was in the fourth grade
Although he's intellectually precocious, he's still only 15 years old and has all the problems of any average adolescent
His shyness and intellect have always made him feel different and uncomfortable in social situations
He stands with his  near a demonstration table
Unlike some of the other exhibits we've seen, there is nothing amateurish about this one
In fact, it is an impressive display of a dye laser
We can see the beams of multi-colored rays bouncing between mirrors, moving through liquids, combining with gases

, who is a nice enough guy but who pretty much regards the fact that his son is gifted as a pain in the butt
See, Dad, it's coherent light
It talks
No
He is seen by
, who greets him
Dr
, what a surprise
Hello, Mrs
Simon
How are you
No problem with Mitch's test scores or anything, is there
No, no
just thought 'd stop by, bring you the good news myself
just got word from the admissions committee
We did it
Mitch is in
Isn't that wonderful
(to Mitch) Hello, Mitch
(shyly) Hi
Nice little display
Thanks What's your medium
Just Argon
But  have it all structured for  if  could get some
That would be interesting
It's all theoretical at this stage, but  have the power supply completely worked out
Very nice
(a kid again) Thanks
turns to Mitch's parents
You must be very proud
he's the first student we've ever accepted for winter term entrance at Pacific Tech
image he's the youngest, too
No, actually
The youngest we've had was a twelve, but he cracked under the pressure within six months so we don't really count him
(almost in tears) Fifteen year old and off to college
Image
Listen Doc
This scholarship thing, does he get any kind of whatya call it, signing bonus sort of thing
(hoping this is not going to be a problem) Well, no
but by allowing Mitch to progress at an accelerated rate we give him the opportunity to fulfill a far greater portion of his remarkable intellectual potential
Don't you agree
Yeah,  guess
It's just that athletes get, you know, cars and stuff
(polite for Mitch's sake) Well,  guess we scientists are a little different than athletes
Cheaper
Smarter Not when it comes to getting cars
We just want the best for Mitchie
(changing gears) Dr
Atherton,  saw your show the other night, about radioactive isotopes, and  have a question for you
Oh, yes
Is that your real hair
Well,  wondered that, too
(struggling for manners) Well, interesting question, when you consider the philosophical aspects of whether anything on television is "real" or actually just an "image" being broadcast
Didn't look real
Anyway, listen,  got to get something to eat or 'm gonna die
Come on, let's look for something
They start away
(cont'd) saw over there one of the kids was doing an experiment with insect protein
Did you see anyone doing anything with corned beef
They exit
Your parents
Yes
They're
nice They're Okay
They just sometimes don't have any idea of what 'm talking about
'm sure of that
Afraid you're going to miss your friends
No
don't have any
think  intimidate other kids
Good boy
don't want to
Remember, compared to you, most people have the  of a carrot
We're different than most people, Mitch, but you should be proud of that
mean, look around
From now on, you'll  amongst peers, colleagues
suppose  might as well tell you now, 've put you on my personal research team
Some of the finest minds on campus, not the least of which is, of course, my own
It sounds great
Well, now, 'm expecting great things from you, my boy
This is only the second time 've given this honor to a freshman
The first was
Chris Kinsley
You know Chris
No, but he's a legend in the Physics Club
Well, you're going to become a legend yourself
You'll be working with Chris
He's a senior now but he's still on the team and still as brilliant as ever
Wow
- We see  , Chris has on his head a pair of those jiggling antennae-like things
to revel that he is on a tour of the facilities
huge hanger-like room filled with workers constructing and assembling scientific instruments
This place has the look and feel of the Big Time
Workers put the finishing touches on a communication
Passing through this Disneyland of Science is a well-dressed executive
, who is guiding Chris on the tour
Chris was heralded as one of the smartest people to ever enter Pacific Tech
He proved to be even smarter than many of his professors
He also proved to be one of the most outrageous people to ever enter Pacific Tech
his antics are legend
Unimpressed with authority, pomposity and bullshit in general
, Chris dresses on the sloppy side of life
Currently he's wearing a sports jacket that's seen better days, over a faded sweatshirt that has the logo "
Toxic Waste
" They approach a second executive/scientist,  , who is wearing a lab coat, and a beautiful public relations executive named  , who is also wearing a lab coat but in a whole new way
(as they approach the couple) Guys,  want you to meet Chris Kinsley
Chris, this is Sherry Nugil, my assistant, and Mike Dodd
Dr
Dodd
He's the man who just designed the new Telcom Satellite here
know
Nice to meet you Dr
Dodd
Isn't the Telcom raining debris all over Europe
(smiling, but angry) That was a launch problem, not a design problem
Why are you wearing that toy on your head
Chris takes the thing from his head
Oh, this
Sorry,  was worried that people would think  was stuffy, You know, no fun; all brain, no penis, Pardon
'm sorry, it's just an infantile response to authority
(confused) Yes
you are Chris Kinsley, aren't you
No
Well, yes
mean,  used to be
Now 'm Mhavishnue Kinsley
(relieved) see
You are being funny
Well,  just can't help it
You're such a fun guy yourself
Oh yes
think you'll find we all are, right Mike
No
Now Chris, Sherry is going to show you around the place
She can answer any questions you might have about fringe benefits or dress codes or anything and 'll see you back upstairs when you're done, okay
Sherry, take good care of this young man
He's one of the ten finest minds kin the country
Someday  hope to be two of them
See you later
Jensen and Dodd exit
You are very beautiful
You don't act like one of the top ten minds in America
Oh, really
How many of them have you met
(with a really dirty look in her eye) Seven
Really
You'll be eight
Six was Professor Hostetler at
Old Professor Hostetler
Isn't he dead
He is now
- Sherry and Chris stare intently into one another's eyes
And so, coupled with full insurance coverage and bonus plans, you find it adding up to a fairly sizable perks package
have a pretty sizable perks package right now
Also, we understand that you people don't care too much for rigid timetables, and that's pretty rare in private industry
So are you
Is it true that school of yours keeps getting smarter and smarter kids every year
Yup
mean no
-
You see the funding associations are the same
Our theoretical work is in the Blue Sky sector as well
You have no idea how much  need that kind of continuity in my life right now
- You just belong here, Chris
We have several of Dr
Atherton's former students and they're all doing quite well with us
What number was he
Two
One of his other students was four
You're wonderful
know
Can we go somewhere
Yes
- The giant dish of a huge radio telescope faces heavens
(
) (between kisses) Talk smart to me
(
) What
They are lying in the middle of the dish
Passion mounts, fingers cope with belts and buttons, clothing falls away; my god, these people are having sex
Please  need it
What was your favorite course
guess right now 'd have to say Fluid Mechanics
Oooooooooh
(responding to something interesting Sherry just did with her hips) And Gym
Please
Sorry
What's your research with Artherton
Ultra-high power laser as an energy force for fusion
Tremendous boon to all mankind
And womankind, too
Fusion, more fusion
It's the process for obtaining enormous amounts of energy from forms of hydrogen, like Deuterium and Tritium
Oh, my God, more
Extracting the fuels is no problem
Hmmmm
Getting them to combine and release the energy is the problem
Oohh, yes It takes temperatures of 100 million degrees Celsius
Oh, God
So, 'm
Yes
building
Yes
a laser
Oh, yes
that pulses
Hmmmmmmmm
very hot
Ohhh
and causes
Yes
Fusion
Ahhhhhhhhhhh
- It is an impressive campus of older California Spanish building mixed with modern architectural marvels
This is the Sunday before the beginning of the Winter Term
We pick up   and  him as he crosses campus
He is wearing a tie and jacket, which only adds to his general sense of being out of place
He is carrying a map which he stops to consult every now and again
He stops an upper classman and asks him a question while pointing at the map
The older asks him a question while pointing at the map
The older student takes great delight in turning the map right side up
' - The tasteful and elegant official residence of the university's President
approaches the open front door, where he is greeted by
Good afternoon
'm looking for (reading from the invitation in his hand) the President's Freshman Tea
(leading him inside) Oh, good
'm so glad we have one then
Who are you
- They pass through on their way to the backyard
Mitch Simon
Oh yes
You're the special case
know Gene wants to meet you
You're just in time for his traditional talk
Would you like a glass of sherry
'm a minor
Aha, well of course you are
That would explain your height
They exit out onto the patio
- The returning freshman class has gathered for a social
Mitch is the only one in a tie
He stands on the patio with Mrs
Meredith whose husband, the apparently ever-jovial professional academic administrator, is about to speak to the assembled
People, if  might get your attention
The din begins to quiet
(') Welcome back, freshmen
take it you all put the Christmas break to good use
There is good-natured jeering
(') Now, if you'll indulge me, 'd like to speak seriously for a moment
You will recall that when  welcomed you to the Pacific institute of Technology a few short months ago  spoke of how we are one of the finest scientific institutions in the world
think the finest
mentioned our six Nobel Prize winners, our members of the national Academy of Sciences, and our members of the National Academy of Engineering
This is an intellectual oasis of technological achievement in the dessert of general academic mediocrity we see inmost colleges and universities today
There is some applause and good-natured banter
Mitch is truly moved
This environment is exactly what Mitch has hoped for all his life
(') also spoke of the fact that you are the finest freshmen class we have ever had here
There are cheers and applause
(') say this to every freshman class
Each year we raise our entrance requirements and each year there is a group of students like you who meet and surpass those requirements
Almost jubilant cheering and clapping
(') As you have no doubt already noticed by now, over a third of you are gone
By the end of the year another third of you will have followed them out of Eden and into mediocrity
The crowd goes deathly silent as Meredith continues in his cherry manner
(') We want only the best
Hard work and high standards are expected of everyone
And if you aren't up to it Cal tech or
might take you, but you don't fit in here
(') Let me remind you that this place is an opportunity, not a right; a chance not a gift; a working lunch, not a picnic
Welcome back
Several waitresses begin serving tea but the despair of reality creeps over the students and they begin to disperse
Mitch stands waiting for the approaching Dr
Meredith
Gene, this is Mitch Simon
Oh, yes, Professor Artherton's bright star
Yes, sir
And  understand you're already on his project
'm assured you're going to do great things
hope so
Let me give you some advice
Thank you
Don't screw up
Okay
guess  better go now
He walks away
(watching Mitch with satisfaction) think the young people really appreciate my " getting down" verbally, don't you
Absolutely
- Once again Mitch, map in hand, must ask another student for directions
This one also turns the map right-side up and then points to the building they are standing in front of
As he heads for it he passes a bronze bust of one of the founding fathers,
The students have decorated him with a muffler, earmuffs and carrot nose to look like a snowman
- Mitch walks down a long corridor
He passes several open doors that reveal laboratories with all kinds of scientific equipment all over them
Mitch stops in front of a closed door
He checks the number, then looks down at a card in his hand
He turns the card right-side up
He  the door to  a darkened lab
In the darkness there is a veritable light show of laser beams
voice calls out from the darkness
(
) Hey
Yes
(
) Come in here
- Mitch  quickly and shuts the door behind himself
In the instrument glow we can make out the forms of three other students
They are: ,  and , members of Dr
Atherton's research team
Just leave the sandwiches and go
Me
No, Yoda; yeah, you
don't have any ah
Brains
No, sandwiches
Well then, what good are you
What are we supposed to eat
(getting a little fed up) How about my shorts
Hey
Who do you think you're talking to
The laser snaps off and the lights snap on
The glare is a little intense at first
(') Are you from the restaurant or not
With the lights on we get a chance to have a better look at the team
Kent is an elitist, intellectual snob with very little imagination who likes to think of himself as Atherton's protege
He wears braces on his teeth because he knows how important a proper smile can be in the marketplace
No
'm Mitch Simon
'm a student
Dr
Atherton told me to come up here
Oh, you're the new stud, are you
Or is it dud
How do you mean
Stud
Hot shot
Brain
You're the twelve-year-old, right
'm fifteen
Does your body know that
Mitch attempts a good-natured laugh
It's not a great attempt
Are you expecting him or
Sure
Can  get you something
balloon
Are any of you guys Chris Kinsley
They all freeze
No, Thank God
Hey Kent,  hear Kinsley got that  job all locked up
Damn
wanted that job
Why
Why
Because it starts at fifty thousand a year, that's why
Plus travel, car, stock options
Oh
Well, 'm supposed to have a look at your work up to date
Check it over
Check it over
Yes
For what
Mistakes,  guess
He said you guys are stuck
The room goes rigid
Evidently this little punk of an upstart needs to be told what Christ died for
Let's get something very clear here
Everything you've heard about the supportive student body and the honor code might hold for the rest of the campus, but it doesn't count for squat in here
Which means when jerry's not here, you do what  say
From God to Jerry to me, get it
Atherton
(') Hi Jerry
've told you before, Kent, you don't get to use my first name
Did
(to Mitch) Good to see you, Mitch
(') (to the group) 'm sure you're all going to become fast friends
We're well on our way already
Good, because after Mitch is brought up to date,  want the rest of you to take your cues from him
He'll be in charge of the group
What
mean, good choice, Jerry
You're doing it again, Kent
Am
Where's Chris
He didn't bother to come in today
He said he didn't feel like it; and then  said 'you better'; and then he said ' or what
'; and then  said ' or he'd get the heck,' and then he said 'jam it, it's Sunday' and he looks for God on Sundays; so  said 'okay, but 'm telling
' Thank you Bodie
notice you've stopped stuttering
Yes, 've been giving myself some sock treatment and it's working
Good
(to Mitch) 'm sorry he isn't here
wanted you to meet your hero
Hero
That clown
Look at this
He points to a table full of laser equipment comprised of various angled mirrors and gas cambers and drib units
The others gather around it
(Cont'd) We heard he wasn't coming in
Kent and  figured we'd go ahead and run his section without him
And we started getting picosecond ratings that aren't even in the ballpark
It looks like it'll take at least a week to re-do all this and start again
Mitch is carefully studying the equipment and checking some notes that were on the table
(') Another costly mistake
Are you sure
Positive
Positive
(reading from notes) Negative
(innocently, to Carter and Kent) There's a mistake all right, but  think you guys made it
Look, you inverted the last two steps
(grabbing the notes) don't make mistakes
(reading) Usually
Damnit, don't touch other people's things
(adjusting the equipment) This shouldn't take too long to fix
'm glad that you were here, Mitch
Yes, thanks for pointing out Carter's mistake, Mitch
Don't bother with that now
'm sure you want to go get settled
(relieved) Well, it has been kind of a long day
Atherton starts to leave
Oh,  forgot Kent,  need your help
Anything, Jerry
Stop it
What
Get copies made of everything so young Mitch here can get started  checking everything tomorrow
My pleasure
And then, on your way back, stop at my cleaners
Don't give it a thought
enjoy it
(to Mitch) Shall we
Sure
Atherton exits, followed by Mitch
guess it goes from God to Jerry to you to the cleaners, right Kent
- Mitch enters the arched column portico of this dormitory building
The room is small, cramped, and more than a little disheveled
,  and science fiction posters hang on the ceiling and wall, over and around one of the two beds
Junk food and soft drink containers are littered everywhere
In one corner is a fully-stocked Frito Lay Chip display
Mitch crosses to his bed and sits
He is exhausted and depressed
The door opens and Mitch see a strange, tall, bulkily- built, hermit-looking kind of a guy enter
He is carrying a McDonald's bag
He stops when he see Mitch and stares at him in a quirky way for a second, then crosses to the closet, opens the door and exits into it
Hello
Getting no response, Mitch rises, goes to the closet, opens it and looks in
Hello
There is no one there
What kind of place is this
Mitch crosses to his luggage
he opens a bag and, to his surprise, he finds it empty
he then looks in the other bag and find they've all been cleaned out
Puzzled, he shuts the bags
Suddenly, the door swings open and   , who we saw earlier at ,
He's dragging a large piece of mechanical equipment
it is, in fact, a baseball pitching machine
Hi
Mitch stares
(') Hey, you just gonna sit there admiring the room or are you going to help me with this
What is this thing
It's a penis stretcher
You want to try it out
No
Oh really
Well, congratulations, then, No, It's an Iron Mike
What
baseball pitching machine
Chris is setting it up
was here for a second this morning
(frightened) You didn't straighten the place up, did you
(looks around at the mess) No
Good
'Cause all my filth's in alphabetical order
Chris puts on a baseball cap and grabs a bat
Anyway,  dropped off my luggage and now all my bags are empty
ball is pitched
Chris connects and the ball smashes through the window
put your stuff away for you
Another pitch
He smashes a ball into a wall
(') It's all in the bottom drawer
Shirts, pants, underwear, shoes
had a little trouble with your sport jacket, so  threw it out
Nah, only kidding
This one's for you, little Johnny
He whacks another pitch
He does a crowd cheer and circles the bases
What a game
'm Chris Kinsley
Oh, no
- Dr
Atherton is riding in a rental car with  , a government contract monitor
These two guys are part of an old boy network involved with research and development
We're falling way behind, Jer
Well, we're not making cheese sandwiches here, you know, Don
That's a good one
'll have to remember to use that, Jer
The new boy is quick
He better be because the company needs a practical working model within four months
You can't dictate innovation
Let me put this another way, Jer
You  know all that money we've been spending for development
Yes Well, when a project gets cut off, the finance boys always run an audit
see
The car pulls up to Atherton's house, where there is a great deal of construction going on
Once the work is completed, this is going to be beautifully restored, rather large Victorian home
(looking out) Having a little work done on the old place, are you
Looks nice
' - Mitch is gathering up some books
He looks at a chart on the wall
Library
library
205
The door to the room opens while Mitch is looking the other way
We catch a glimpse of the same tall, bulkily-built man opening Mitch's closet door and disappearing inside
Mitch turns just in time to see the door close
he goes into it, opens it and looks inside
Nothing
he goes to the door of his room
Mitch opens the door, steps into the hall and slips, landing on his ass
His books go flying
The hall floor is covered with ice wall-to-wall
Skating  is playing on a cassette somewhere
few students, dressed for winter, are skating
Chris skates over and helps Mitch to his feet
Welcome to Pacific Tech's "Smart People On Ice
" He whirls away, leaping from wall to wall, sliding quickly down the ice
He stops in front of a short, roly-poly kid of Japanese descent,  , better know as
Ick is a bio-chemist who spends a great deal of time in his lab experimenting with various fun compounds that do things ranging from making artificial ice to increasing memory
(with a proletariat accent) Ice turned out real good, Ick
Yeah, it worked
, didn't it
What did you use
(teasing) Oh, sure,  tell you then you tell somebody else, and the next thing you know we're in the middle of another ice age
(yelling down the hall) Come on, people
Nobody's skating
(
) Just 'cause you're a slack, Kinsley
Moles and trolls
What
Moles and trolls
Work, work, work, work
plan this for weeks
go to a lot of trouble and all they want to do is study
'm hurt
know that's it's not like me but 'm sorry
'm starting to get discouraged, people
We had nobody at the mutant hamster races, one entry in the Madame Curie look-alike contest, and he was disqualified later
Why do  even bother
Chris skates off
(to Ick) How does he do it
Well, 'm not an expert, but  think he puts one foot in front of the other and pushes
Not skating
The horsing around
The never studying
know he's smart
but nobody's that smart
don't know how smart he is
Before he even came here he invented a solar battery, which laid the groundwork for the system that provides the energy for Amarillo, at half the cost
He'd be a millionaire today if he been smart enough to make them pay for it
How he pulls the grades,  don't know
Just then,  down the hall, face down on a sled, comes
She is an advanced engineering student with great theoretical and mechanical skill who can never seem to pitched energy of a hyper-kinetic kindergarten class
She crashes at Mitch's feet
He reaches down to help her
You okay
No, not emotionally, no 'm not
'm disappointed
not terribly, but still, it should have gone much, further, much faster
It's okay, though,  know what the problem is, that's simple, it's obviously the drag coefficient, 'll just have to re-design the blades
can do that, that's easy
can do that here; but  have to cut then after they're designed, that takes tools, that takes time
How long is this stuff going to last, do you know
Maybe another half an hour
That's great, that's good
can do that, no problem, lots of time
(to Mitch) What's your name
Mitch Thanks for the help
See you
And in a flash she is gone
Your welcome
(to Ick) Who was that
That
that was
Jordan rushes back
(to Mitch) 'm Jordan,  realized 'd forgotten to tell you my name, it's Jordan
heard there was going to be someone new this term, are you a freshman
Yes
Do you have a bed
Yeah
Oh,  was going to make you one if you needed it but you don't so that's okay
Well,  gotta go, 'll see you later, probably
See you Ick, see you Mitch
As she races off,  enters carrying several binders
What's all this suppose to be
This
This is new kind of shovel
Mitch finds this very funny and reacts accordingly by laughing
Kent can't stand to be laughed at
(Dumping the binders into Mitch's hands) This should keep you busy for awhile
This, plus your regular class load should turn your brains to mush in a month
Aw
Kent, we were going to name you King of the Winter Carnival
Ha ha
(to Ick) suppose you're in on this, too
Did you make this stuff
'm not saying
Who's going to clean it up
Don't have to
It's going to go from solid form directly to gas
(impressed by this fairly uncommon phenomenon) Really
What is it
'm not saying
But  can tell you that it's fairly rare, and very unstable
You're all a bunch of degenerates
We are
What about that time  caught you naked with a bowl of Jello
(flustered) you
was hot and  was hungry
And anyway
Look, Kinsley, you're not number one anymore
Number one what
(pointing to Mitch) Mighty mouse, here, beat your placement scores by over twenty points
Really
guess you think you're pretty hot stuff
(uncomfortable, unsure if this is real) Well
no,  mean Hey
Maybe you are smarter than me, but, can you do this
Chris pushes himself off backwards and slides along the ice in an attempt at a fancy figure skating move
Just as he's about to finish he crashes to the floor at the precise moment that the floor turns into a cloud of rising gas
Chris disappears in the cloud
(excited) It worked
That's neat
(teasing) Now if we can just keep it from exploding
Kent runs away
(from inside the growing cloud) Hey, Ick
Is it okay to breathe this stuff
(beat) Ick
(beat) Ick
The cloud fills the screen
' - Perfect morning light streams through the window, making even this dump look beautiful
Chris is asleep in a strange position on his bed, proving that even asleep he is eccentric
We Pan across the room to Mitch
He has obviously fallen asleep while reading the binders that Kent had given him the night before
We  the sound of the door opening, followed by some heavy footsteps
This causes Mitch to wake up
it takes him a second to realize where he is
He sits up
' Again we catch just a glimpse of that same mysterious figure opening the closet door
He is holding a "McDonald's" bag
He closes the door behind him
To say the least, he's thrown by this strange intrusion
Hello
He waits a beat, listening
Nothing happens so he gets up and crosses to the closet, looks inside
' There's nothing in there but clothes
Mitch pushes the garments aside and finds just a wall
He shakes his head
This is getting frustrating
He exits the room
Mitch crosses to the urinal
Just as he is about to relieve himself, the door opens
Jordan enters
This is an experience Mitch has never before and as a result he is one uncomfortable fifteen-year-old
Hi, good morning,  thought  saw you come in here, you must be an earlier riser, we met last night, 'm Jordan, remember
had a sled with me,  made you a sweater
She holds out a sweater
He leans into the urinal, trying to hide himself the best he can
Last night
yeah, it's just something  do with my hands while 'm reading
hope  got the size right, 'm pretty sure  did,  have a brother so  use him as a sizing comparison, and  have a pretty good eye for that sort of thing, so  just went ahead and made you one because  was, you know, up
Peeing
Yeah
never sleep
don't know why
It drove my roommate nuts
mean really nuts, they had to take her away in an ambulance and everything, she's okay now thought but she had to be transfer to an easier school but  don't know if that part has anything to do with being my fault, but still, anyway, if you ever want any help studying at night or just let me know, okay, 'cause 'm just a couple of doors down from you guys and 'm usually up and  wouldn't mind, okay
Thanks,  will
Are you finished yet
can't start
Because 'm here
think so
Isn't that weird
Well,  have to go
Me, too
Right, well, don't forget what  said, 'll put the sweater in your room, see you later, tell Chris that if he wants one 'll be happy to make him one but nit today because after classes 'm going to rebuild the back part of my room, you should come down and see it later,  have to go, bye
She exits
(stunned) bye
- Mitch is coming down a hallway into the area
He is dressed in his tie and jacket and has books under his arm
As he crosses past the self-serve vending machine he spots Chris entering the kitchen
Mitch follows him inside
Something strange happened to me this morning
Was it a dream where you see yourself dressed up in kind of sun god robes standing on top of a pyramid with all theses nude women throwing little pickles at you
No Why am  the only person who has that dream
Before Mitch can ask another question, Chris open the freezer compartment and takes out a large thermos-like container
He takes it over to the cutting board, then takes from his pocket a pair of calipers, a pair of tweezers, and a little box that looks like a dental floss kit
He opens the container which immediately starts pouring thick steam
Liquid nitrogen
Chris uses calipers to extract a length of tubing from inside the container
he puts it down on the board and, using the tweezers, pushing out a cylindrical mound of ice from inside the tube
Then, from the dental floss kit, he pulls out a length of very fine wire, which he uses to cut the ice into a number of thin "coins" and slides then into the lid of the container, which he picks up and takes out the door with him
Mitch follows
Coffee
Using the tweezers, Chris picks up an ice coin and puts it into one of the machines
There is a high-pitched squeak
To Mitch's astonishment, the machine accepts the bogus money and a cup drops down and fills with coffee
So, what's happened
Oh
There's a guy living in our closet
You've seen him too
Chris puts his coins in several of the machines and retrieves from them junk food junky's treasure trove of goodies
Who is it
Hopsfield
Is he
safe
So far
Chris exits
Mitch stares after him
: quick series of shots moves us through the next two months of time, accompanied by an original song
- An older professor is lecturing, pointing to a complicated algebraic problem on a blackboard, Mitch is in the last row of this student-filled, multi-tiered classroom
Everyone else listens intently and makes notes while Mitch thumbs quickly through a textbook, then closes it and makes a note in a loose-leaf binder
- Mitch stands with a group of other students watching an instructor explain the intricacies of nuclear fission
Mitch opens a notebook and starts writing furiously
'  - Mitch is using his notes and some pieces of equipment to explain something to the rest of the team
Chris is impressed
Kent shakes his head in disagreement until Atherton nods his approval, at which point Kent also agrees
' - it is late but Mitch is still hard at the books
Hopsfield goes by and disappears in the closet
Mitch doesn't even notice anymore
There is a knock at the door and Jordan enters
She has brought Mitch a device that she just built which holds textbooks and turns the pages automatically
- Mitch, dressed more informally, is in the same room with the same professor as in scene 54
This time, however, there are several empty seats
The people have been replaced by cassette tape recorders
Mitch takes notes
- Mitch enters with another student to find a teddy bear waiting for him at his place
' - Mitch and Chris work alone
it is obviously very late
Using a variety of exotic-looking devices, they put the laser through its paces and make notes
- This time, Mitch is the only student
Tape recorders sit in front of every seat
The professor drones on, apparently oblivious to what he sees in front of him
- very attractive instructress is demonstrating a dye trace experiment in a huge wave tank
Mitch takes notes
Mitch and Ick are carrying trays of food, looking for a place to sit
They pass a seated Kent, who points out a place for Mitch, who looks to see a highchair at the end of the table
- Mitch comes down the stairs with several books under his arms
He stumbles and drops one of the books
As he struggles to recover it, it is handed to him by none other than Hopsfield
By the time Mitch realizes who it is, the mysterious figure is once again gone
- Mitch is crossing the street carrying a huge load of books
Suddenly a yellow Citroen pulls up behind him and honks its horn causing Mitch to drop everything
He looks at the driver and sees that it is a laughing Kent
' Chris, Kent, Bodie and Carter are present as Atherton wraps up a day's class
People take serious notes
Chris reads a magazine
People file out and Mitch enters approaches Chris to get him to work on the laser
Chris shakes his head
' - Mitch is working alone
He adjusts the laser and turns it on
It burns through a very thick block of wood, but Mitch is still not pleased
- very tired Mitch heads for the lecture hall
He comes to the door, opens it and enters to see a tape recorder lecturing to a roomful of tape recorders
' - In need of a break from studying, Mitch goes to the closet in hopes of figuring out how to open the wall
He examines the walls and the floor and looks, for hidden switches or secret mechanisms, all to no avail
As he's about to give up, the closet door swings closed
When it closes, the wall opens to reveal a small elevator-like cage
Mitch steps in and the cage descends
It hits a lever and stops
But before Mitch steps in and the can get off, it begins to move sideways, triggering another pulley, and goes down again into the steam tunnels, then drags along the floor and stops
Mitch gets out
It's spooky
In the distance there is a glow of light
Mitch goes forward until he can see the home of Hopsfield
It's a very utilitarian example of life on the edge, with all the comforts
At the console of an amazing, hand-built computer sits amazing Hopsfield
Mitch watches in awe from the darkness
' - There is an experiment in progress
large laser is building up an energy load
Atherton, Kent, Bodie, Carter, and Mitch monitor various pieces of equipment
Things hum and click and there is a sense that something big is going to happen
Atherton seems pleased, while Mitch seems troubled
Suddenly, a valve blows and a stream of liquid nitrogen hisses from a hose, spewing frost over everything
Everyone jumps for switches and they shut the experiment down
(checking the valve) It's nothing
It's just mechanical
Don't bother changing it
want you and Bodie to rebuild the whole unit; same output in half the size
Should hold up, right Mitch
Sure, as long as we go with
Well, gentlemen, now what
Things are going okay so far, aren't they
They certainly are in my area, Jerry
(warning) (unaware) Yes
Boy, when  think of all the applications for this
(covering) We've got enough theory to deal with without talking applications
You just worry about giving me that power breakthrough
how close are you
(gloating) Not very, from what  hear
(to Mitch) Aren't you and Chris working together
Yes
but
Where is Mr
Kinsley
(anxious to get Chris in trouble) He's outside
Kent goes to the window and shouts down
(') (shouting) Kinsley
Dr
Atherton wants you
-   - He's sitting on a chaise lounge with a stack of encyclopedias, sipping a beer
Coming
that the chaise lounge has balloons tied to each corner
Chris dumps a volume from his lap and the chaise rises straight up in the air
- Chris hovers in mid-air
What are you doing out there
Floating, sir
And thinking
(fuming) want to see you at my house at six o'clock
Sharp
Sounds fun
Should  bring anything
How about a proper attitude for a change
'll try and borrow one
Now, if you'll excuse me, there are millions of boys and girls everywhere waiting for me to bring them presents
Ho ho ho
He hands Atherton a volume and floats from view
Atherton, Mitch and Kent stand at the window, watching Chris ascend
He's really pushing it, isn't he, Jerry
He smiles as he watches his roommate and friend float off
' - The restoration work is reaching completion and the house is looking pretty beautiful
small crew of workmen paint and do other finishing work
Chris is sitting on the porch, watching
He is eating a very large puffs of popcorn from a bag
We  Atherton returning from his daily jog
He is decked out in an expensive designer jogging suit and has all the appropriate accessories
he also has all the silly habits of the trendy runner for cooling down and stretching
You wanted to see me, your joggingness
Mr
Kinsley
Right on time
What a surprise
Do you run
Only when chased
What are you eating
It's one of mark's Ickagami's experiments
He's been irradiating corn with strontium
it's his hobby; big food
That's popcorn
It's big popcorn
(over reacting) Get it away from me
can't stand it
hate popcorn
Leave it there
Chris puts the bag down on the porch
Okay
Have you ever considered switching to de-caffeinated coffee
Atherton leads Chris to the front door, where he removes his shoes and then stands and waits until Chris does the same
They proceed into the house
' - The interior is immaculate
classic example of elegant good taste
Atherton is fastidiously protective of his things
want to start seeing a lot more of you in the lab
You want me to work nude
Very funny, you're a major disappointment to me, Chris
And you to me, Jerry
(angry) We had a deal
And  advanced your project more than any three guys on campus
That was yesterday
What have you done for me today
Hey, aren't you getting a little obsessive about this
took in the new kid
He's working his guts out for you
Your arrogant, disrespectful behavior is distracting him
If you keep it up, you're going to pay for it
Hey, 'm out of here
Delenda Est Cartheo
July one
You still have to pass, dear boy, and considering the fact that my class is a requisite, it would seem that  would have some control over your destiny
From now on, you and Mr
Simon are going to spend every waking moment working on my power problem and you will solve it by my deadline
Okay, Jerry, but  really think you should see an analyst
Chris exits
Atherton watches him go
' - Mitch is alone and trying to work on the new, smaller laser
He looks tired and upset
He tinkers around for a while, then goes back to his table and looks at his notes
Nothing seems to make sense anymore
Chris enters with a beaker in his hand
Hi
Do me a favor, taste this
Mitch is confused
(') Come on, you won't hurt my feelings
Chris rams the spoon in his mouth
Well, too sweet
Mitch makes a face
What is it
Beats me
just found it in one of the labs
Aggghh
Come on
'm just pulling your leg
How are you doing
'm stuck
Dr
Atherton says we've got to miniaturize the power supply and you're not helping
Lighten up
It's only a laser
Chris goes to the laser
Mitch is annoyed
(') Instead of trying to take that roomful of capacitors over there and putting new perspective
Charge this baby up
Everything you've got
What for
You'll see
Go Mitch goes next door
Chris, meanwhile, measures a certain distant from the floor and mounts a mirror on the wall above his head
He then moves to the laser and repositions it to shoot at the mirror
Mitch returns and makes some adjustments to a control panel
All set,  think
Do it
Mitch throws a switch
Immediately, a loud electrical hum fills the air
Chris goes over and opens the door to the hall and glances left
' roomful of capacitors loading
- The lights twinkle from various buildings
the hum - The lights twinkle from various buildings
We hear the hum growing
(
) What are you doing now
(
) Making hamburgers
Suddenly, there are several loud snaps and all the lights on campus go off at once as the power overload blows the sub station fuses
(
) Oh, no
Relax, it's just the fuses at the sub station
They'll have it back on in a second
More importantly, did we get a charge
Suddenly there is a loud "crack" and the laser sends out a beam across the room, bouncing off the mirror on the wall
, out the door, where it hits another mirror and disappears from sight
Wow
- The beam has formed a web of light across the darkened campus
The effect is quite spectacular
People look in awe
Chris and Mitch exit the physics building
Follow the yellow brick road
Have you ever considered the fact that you are completely wasting your life
Constantly
The lights on campus come back on as Chris and Mitch continue to follow the beam
An open window above the door lets the beam of light enter
Chris and Mitch enter
- Chris and Mitch walk down a stairway through an open door, following the beam
- The place has been turned into an indoor Waikiki
The beam has been directed into a hood-shaped device that has split it into enough rays to cook a bunch of hot dogs and hamburgers on an improvised barbeque, managed by , who is dressed for the beach and wearing a welding mask
Past him we can see that there about twenty girls and some guys present
Several of them are water-skiing on the mechanically produced waves inside the tank, towed by an elaborated pulleys system
Others are frolicking on the "beach" and cut out palms stand around, achieving the desired effect
Blankets have been laid out and girls sit on them eating hot dogs and talking
There are sun lamps set up in one area and some kids are smoothing sun tan oil and shagging a few rays
Rock music fills the room
(lifts his mask) Aloha
lot of the guys we've seen around the dorm have started to arrive
They enter hesitantly at Chris's urging
Come on in, boys
Surf's up
Awestruck, shy but excited, they approach
(a nerdy student) have a geochemistry test tomorrow and  do not feel adequately prepared
But the main thing is you look good
Thanks
What if we end up having too much fun and end up failing
And would that be the end of the world
Milton
Yes, it would
Yeah, you're right
Maybe you should go back to the library
Well, maybe  could just look for a minute
(noticing) Are those girls
haven't had them all tested yet, Cornell, but so far so good
Who are they
They're not from here
'd know
No, no they're not, they're from a nearby college though
Which one
The Wanda Trossler School of beauty
They're beauticians
Not yet
Gee,  don't know
They'll teach you
Let's get serious here, lads
There are 670 guys at pacific tech and 136 girls
ratio of 4
93 to 1 Good, Milton
Of the 136 girls, most of them can find guys a lot better than you
Oh, easily
These girls are not used to geniuses
You might impress them
don't see how
Let me put this another way
Given the type of people you are and the environment you're in, you guys have to admit the strong probability that this may be the only chance you'll ever get in your entire lives to have sex
There is a pause while everyone considers the hypothesis
(') Think about it
He turns and heads into the party
After a beat, everyone except Mitch follows Chris's lead
- Water-skiing, dancing, a volleyball game
Most of the guys are making an effort to socialize
Mitch watches quietly
So, what do you guys do
Just be smart all the time
Well
What's your major
Astrophysics
Is that like sports medicine
Space
(impressed) Oh
Let me ask you something about that
If  was on the moon, Could  like tease hair much higher
Theoretically
This is fascinating
another guy named Fenton and a girl
They're necking
My friend Evelyn, tells me that brilliant men are the best lovers
'd say that's true
Up to now, what's been your ultimate sexual experience
once fell off a ladder and landed on my sister, Bernice
, and a girl in the tank
they both bob up out of the water
Cornell still has his glasses on
He takes them off and can't see
Why do you wear those glasses
So  can see
But you look very sexy without them
Reflexively he breaks his glasses in his hands
He rubbing suntan oil on her back really should be studying
Me too
have a bleaching final tomorrow
(sneezing) Achew
Bless you
'm allergic to suntan oil
Maybe you should stop
(aroused) don't think  can They are sitting on the "beach" toweling off
(very sexy) You know,  read in the Enquirer that woman paid twenty thousand dollars for the sperm of a genius
Really
(putting her arms around him) 've
Do you have a cup
The party is in full swing and most of the guys have become very comfortable
Some are making out
Mitch now seems like the only one left out
he sees a pretty  just coming out of the water
She adjusts her top
Mitch wanders over to her
(with great effort) Hi
Hi
was watching you
swim
Yes
was thinking of maybe going for a swim myself
Yeah
Is this the kiddy pool
She exits, leaving Mitch devastated
He goes and sits in a corner
Meanwhile, Chris is looking around proudly
It's obvious he didn't see what just happen to Mitch
He smiles at the fun everyone is having
girl passes him eating a hamburger
Don't eat that
Huh
Don't you know eating that stuff can give you very large breasts
(mock despair) Oh
My god
see 'm too late
She laughs
He puts his arms around her and they walk off
As Chris and Kimberly , we catch a glimpse of a face in a window
We push in to see Kent, spying
-  (    ) on Atherton's face
He looks odd, as there are Kleenex tissues sticking out from his shirt collar
hand comes into frame, holding a pancake makeup puff, and starts applying it to his face
Christ, Don
'm doing the best  can
You act like  don't want my own invention to work
There are only so many hours in a day
agree
And what's more important, massaging your ego on television explaining the digestive system of a rabbit to the great unwashed or "project crossbow" Off-hand, 'd say television
(angrily to make up man) Just get rid of the crows' feet
(to Carmichael carefully) There's nothing more important than " crossbow," but when went from blue sky to black you turned into Bigfoot
The   approaches
Ready to go, Dr
Atherton
He exits
Pushing me doesn't help
You tell them that
He walks away
There is definitely no love between them
(') (under his breath) Son of a bitch
(under his breath) Asshole
as he walks over to the cue card man and checks through the cards
enters in a rush
have something to
(cutting him off) Did you pick up my dry cleaning
Yes  did
there's something you should know
The gravy stain
No, that came out
(very pleased) Chris and Mitch aren't working
They're at a party
Atherton begins to seethe
want to show me where, right after 'm finished here
(all smiles) My pleasure
In five
four
Kent forgets to move
Atherton shoves him off
We  an off-stage
(') three
two
and
We  in on nearby monitor
the show's logo comes on, along with its theme
(
) ","   , Dr
(
) grant from Pacific Electric Instruments
And now, Dr
Atherton
Atherton appears on the monitor
He smiles broadly and reads from the cue cards
Good evening
Tonight we're going to look at something most of us take for granted
the colon
What's it look like
- She tosses a volleyball up into the air in a one-woman game of catch
Mitch approaches forlornly
Wanna play
'm not very
(') Sure, all right
Through the following, Mitch and Jordan volley the ball between them
Some party, huh
guess
(hesitant) How come you're not
Necking
well
'm not gay
(embarrassed) didn't
wouldn't even
Look, 'm seventeen
'm brilliant, and 'm hyper kinetic
Guy are a little afraid of me, you know
It'll pass
hope
(softly) think you're very nice
Mitch gets smashed on the head with the ball, sending his glasses flying
Suddenly, Atherton burst into the room, followed closely by Kent
(seeing Mitch) Simon
He passes the tape deck and snaps it
Everything comes to a stop as Atherton heads for Mitch, all eyes trained on the pending drama
You were supposed to be in the lab tonight
(chiming in) Weren't you
was and
You are at Pacific Tech to work, not to behave like a philistine
That's right
was working,
Where's Kinsley
imagine this was his idea
No doubt
(annoyed) Kent
(stiffening) yes
(to Mitch, very angry) took a big chance recommending a fifteen-year-old
guess  made a mistake
hope you're proud of yourself
Kent is in seventh heaven as Atherton turns and heads for the door
As they exiting, they pass Cornell and his date
Dr
Atherton
What
Are you wearing makeup
Atherton can only stare in his rage
Is it too try and hide those crows' feet
He growls and exits
He is truly at a loss in the face of this cruelty
Everyone is staring at him
He runs out the door
She watches Mitch go, feeling very badly for him ' - Mitch, tired, looking like a kid who's been working for hours, is staring at a formula on the blackboard
Frustrated, he throws his screwdriver against it in anger and runs into the adjacent room and begins disconnecting the capacitor bank
- Kent, Bodie and Carter cross toward the lab
Just then, Mitch comes out
He looks exhausted and very upset
As he passes Kent, he turns away from his stare
(mock concern) Gee, he looks depressed
The other guys yuk it up
They turn and watch Mitch go into Atherton's office down the hall
They follow in time to : (
) 'd like to make a collect call to Mrs
Bill Simon
Kent's eyes light up with an idea
' Mitch is on the phone
He's very upset
know, but  don't like it here anymore
want to live at home with you
(reluctant) Yeah, and dad
want to go back to high school
-dad did what
Rented out my room
Well, why can't Mr
Echevarria and  share it
Please, ma,  want to come home
' - Its reels are spinning
It's being held up to a telephone receiver
(
/) (crying) Please let me come home
don't want to stay here
to reveal Kent holding the recorder as cater and Bodie watch
The workbench area in Kent's lab is covered with a drop cloth
Kent chuckles as  pleads with his mother
- - The dorm population is eating their breakfast
Kent and his unholy two are smugly downing their "shredded wheat" Mitch is alone off in the corner
It's obvious he hasn't slept
Chris enters and crosses to Kent
, middle-aged, is serving coffee
Kent
let's never fight like that again
What
We've been lovers too long to have a silly argument come between us
The waitress stares disgustedly at Kent
Chris
Please
Don't speak
You were right
Tonight 'll wear the cowboy suit
(sputtering) You
Do your parents know about this
Of course not
She nods and exits
Kent calls after her
(') Nobody knows
mean, there's nothing to know
Chris walks over to Mitch
Where were you all last night
The lab
Where you were supposed to be
Jordan told me about Atherton coming down on you
what exactly did
Mitch abruptly turns his back to Chris and continues eating
Chris sees the conversation is over
(') (referring to the sentence he never finished) Let me hold that thought and get back to ya
Ken, Bodie and Carter
The gentle strains of classical music fill the room
Something soothing to eat by
The tape is abruptly interrupted by the  Kent made of Mitch on the phone to his mother
He can't believe his ears
His expression runs from surprise to embarrassment
Everyone stops eating and listens to Mitch begging his mother to come home
They share his embarrassment and lower their heads
Even Kent's friends are uncomfortable
Kent, on the other hand, is laughing it up, having a great time
He's in a state of shock
(he can't wait ) Here comes the crying
He loves it
He runs out of the dinning room
Kent loves Mitch reaction
It makes him laugh harder
(to himself) Too low
' - Mitch is trying to pack, but it's difficult because the place is in such disarray
Chris enters
He watches and tries to think of what to say
Okay, if you want to leave, go ahead
But you'll miss the fun
(sour) What fun
Ick invented a new virus and we're gonna release it in Kent's room
Mitch turns on Chris with surprising hostility
That's sick
That's a sick thing to do
Hey,  was just kidding,
You're always just kidding
There's something wrong with you
Just a second
The other night  needed your help and all you wanted to do was party
tried to help you
tried to help you relax
Being snubbed by beauticians isn't my idea of relaxing
Student beauticians
(Blows up) thought this place was going to be different, but it's just the same
'm either used or made fun of
In high school they pushed me in a mailbox, did  tell you that
They called me Chris the whiss'
Really
What's a whiss
think they meant wuss, but it didn't rhyme
when  was three years old,  balanced my father's checkbook so they sent me to school and fired their accountant
My father was so intimidated, he stopped speaking to me
My teacher disliked me because  was smarter than they were, and my classmates hated me because  bell the bell curve
Sound familiar
And tell me why my
why did my mother dress me in white shirts, hush puppies and a briefcase, guaranteeing that a girl would never talk to me
Mitch looks down at his own white shirt and hush puppies
(Dramatic) And then one night, in this room,  was sitting right where you are sitting now
had a vision
saw him
god Hopsfield
Hopsfield
Oh
The guy in the closet
Yeah
Laslo Hopsfield
followed him
Through the closet; down into the steam tunnels
And down there  saw the most disgusting thing Ive ever seen
(Frighten) What
Hopsfield in his pajamas
(Lighter, but sincere) And  talk to the guy
Turned out that in the Seventies he was the number one stud around here
Smarter than you and me put together
So brilliant, so sharp, so advanced, so long
What do you mean
He graduated
Went to work for some chemical company
One day someone told him he was making stuff that was killing people
think it was his mother
He freaked
You see, he was totally unprepared for the real world
He had no philosophy
He thought science was the answer for everything
Mitch Am  gonna wind up in a steam tunnel
Yes, you are, Metaphorically speaking
Unless you see that the same thing that has made your life miserable can make it great; your brain
When you're smart, people need you, and you can learn how to work that for fun and profit
You had a arrangement going with Atherton, don't you
That's why you don't have to study
Hey,  don't carry a briefcase
(pause) You're a nice kid
If you leave 'll miss you
(thinking about it) If  stay, what should  do,  mean
Well, the first thing you have to do is get even with Kent
It's a moral imperative
(smiles) Yeah
- Kent's Citroen pulls up
Kent and Carter get out and walk by Jordan, who is sitting nearby
And at Northern Electronics you get the stock options, but not the free housing, It's what makes  so sweet
You get everything
Yeah, and Kinsley's got that locked
(knowingly) Maybe he does, and maybe he doesn't
They walk away
After a beat, ,  and  jump out from behind another car
Mitch carries a
Over here
The others rush over to her
Chris trains a light on the license plate
It reads, "
" He puts his name on his car
He does the same thing with his underwear
Mitch flops down the tool box
5R5DISSOLVE : Chris, Mitch, Jordan and Ick working on Kent's car
They are undoing bolts, talking out wires, removing fenders, etc
The last  and we see the car is gone
And no sign of our foursome
- Chris quietly goes up the stairs inside the dorm carrying a steering wheel
Ick and Mitch have an engine on a flatbed cart
Jordan enters carrying heavy chains and a drill
' - Filthy with crankcase oil, Chris, Mitch, Ick and Jordan exit and scamper down the hall
All are very pleased with themselves
' - Kent is coming down the hall
he opens his door and walks inside
" His jaw drops open
Chris and Mitch enter
Hey, Kent
That's your car
You're not supposed to park on campus
This isn't funny
You went too far this time, Kinsley
had help
(surprised, to Mitch) You
(a beat) 'm going to get you guys
Dr
Atherton's gonna hear about this
He storms out of his room
(calls to Kent) Hey, Kent, you owe us ten dollars for the gas
(to Mitch) He'll never pay us
' - The restoration has been completed and the house looks beautiful
Chris comes up the walk, goes to the door and rings the bell
very pretty girl named  answers the door
' - Chris enters
Wow
Hello
Hi
Jerry asked me to drop by
What did he ask you to do
What
Which word didn't you understand
Are you here for the meeting
What meeting
don't know
Okay
'm just waiting
Right
The study doors open and Atherton, Carmichael and Decker step out
(finishing their conversation) And finally, it comes down to, if you can't do it, we'll get somebody else
have a timetable, doctor
We're very close, Dave, don't worry, everything's going to be fine
(cold as ice) Don, try and remember you work for me
(to Atherton) think 've made my point, haven't
(equally as cold) Crystal clear, Mr
Decker
Good
Anything  should know about
Shut up Kinsley
'll be with you in a moment
Goodbye, Jerry, and good luck
Susan
They begin to exit
Chris takes Susan's hand
guess this is goodbye
'm sorry  didn't get a chance to know you
At all
(to the boys in admiration) Have you ever seen breasts like theses before
She happens to be my daughter
Oh, then  guess you have
(to Atherton) 'll be reporting to him every day
Coming, Don
Yes, Sir
They exit
What do you think you're doing
You said come over
Take off those shoes
Chris removes his shoes to reveal even dirtier socks
(') Stay off the rugs
- What's up, Doc
'm withdrawing your recommendation to
What
'm giving Kent the job
Did you suddenly find humor
You haven't solved my power problem
'm trying
No, you're not
So, 'm going to fail you, so you won't graduate, so you can't take the job
'll pass your exam
Atherton just smiles a "so what" smile
(') We had a deal
Did we
That doesn't sound very ethical
You can't do this
'll go to Dr
Meredith
(enjoying this) Go ahead
What are you going to tell him
Don't forget, like most scientists, he is an honorable, moral man who thinks everyone else is too
'll just deny anything you say
You dick
Count on it
- Chris sits, lost in thought, outside the window of his room, Mitch appears at the window, sees Chris and climbs out to join him
What are you doing
Self-realization
was thinking of jumping, but it's only twelve feet
Something wrong
No
Atherton is going to flunk me out of school
But you had a deal
Yeah, and he says  didn't deliver
You sleep with pits, you wake up smelly
think Aristotle said that
It was him or Eva Gabor
At least Hopsfield still has his integrity
Excuse me
thought  was so smart
didn't want to be like the other dumb geniuses like Hopsfield
though  could use Them
, instead of Them using me
But, Guess what
have to agree
It does appear that you've been the victim of your own erroneous logic
Thank you
However, this doesn't mean that you can't get yourself out
How
Hard work
But that's the old way
series of shots showing Chris hard at work, underscored by an original song
Mitch and Chris dismantle part of the laser
Mitch, Jordan and Ick are listening as Chris shows them diagrams and formulas for a laser supercharger while they try to eat
Chris and Ick search for a new gas combination for the laser supercharger
' Mitch and Chris work hard on a second laser
Kent is both upset and suspicious of Chris' new interest in work
' Chris enters carrying books and a note pad
Kent sees this and is shocked
Atherton gives Chris a "you haven't got a chance" grin
' - They both study for exams; on the wall is a chart of exam week showing Mitch's exam schedule, a big red square around Chris' exam with Atherton and, in every free hour is written " Laser"
Many students, including our gang, study for exams
Suddenly, Milton can't take the pressure any longer and momentarily goes out of his mind and runs from the room
' tired looking Chris and Mitch attach a second laser to the original but nothing improves
They check their notes and diagrams
Kent, Bodie and carter chuckle in the corner
Mitch is taking an exam with a bunch of people he doesn't recognize from the Professor who everyone tape recorded
One of the students appears to be near panic as he deals with a pile of mangled tape
' - Chris and Jordan use a blackboard diagram to discuss the engineering difficulties of Chris' laser supercharger assembly
Chris runs down the hall and enters his room
Mitch is sprawled out asleep under a math text
Chris feels bad about it but wakes him up
' wasted Chris and Mitch build the new assembly that will allow a second laser to shoot at the gas jets of the principal laser
- Chris is studying hard
Mitch is asleep, his head on the table
(in his sleep) Please, Vito, not in the mailbox again
Mitch
Mitch wakes up
Oh
was just reliving some high school highlights
Look, you don't have to stay up with me
It's not like we're driving
Get some sleep
You're a growing boy
hope
Hopsfield enters carrying two large boxes of what appear to be file cards
Mitch is stunned
They all stare for a beat
Hi, Laslo
thought you might want some help so  dug into the computer and got every question Artherton's ever asked on every final he ever given
Gee,  didn't get you anything
Is that them
No, these are entries for McDonald's Sweepstakes
No purchase necessary
Enter as often as you want
So,  am
Really
This box makes it one million, six hundred thousand
should win thirty two point six percent of the prizes, including the car
Kind of takes the fun out of it, doesn't it
suppose so
But they set up the rules, and lately,  have come to realize that  have certain materialistic needs
So where are the questions
(insulted) memorized them
Chris and Mitch look at each other, impressed and a little frightened
have to go to sleep now
Want my pajamas
Uhhh
thanks, no
Smart kid
He's going to grow five inches in the next year
How do you
never mind
' He opens the door and enters
It's dark
Mitch
(surprised) Jordan
He turns on the light
Much to his surprise and ours, seated on his bed is Sherry Nugil, the girl Chris met at  - the genius groupie
She's dressed for the occasion
Mitch Simon
Who
'm Sherry Nugil
And 've been waiting three years for this
For what
For you to be old enough
For what
For this
She kisses him
(') Are you ready
For what
Why do you keep saying, 'For what
' 'Cause so far it's working great
- Jordan is using a big machine to sand her floors
There's a knock on the door
(shouts) Come in
Mitch enters, He appears dazed and disheveled
Oh, hi, Mitch
'm just sanding the floor
Could you turn that off a second
She does
She starts moving the furniture back
What's wrong
Why are you sweating
just
came back from helping Chris and there was this woman in my room
Jordan stops, It's the first time we've seen her doing nothing
woman
(with emphasis) woman
mean she was
blessed Oh
And she wanted to
How can  say this so as not to offend you
Jump you
Yeah
hope you're not offended
So what happened
(excited) She kissed me
Then she took off her clothes
Then  took off my clothes-she had to help me
kept blacking out - then
it was unbelievable
You made it with her
No
That's what was unbelievable
Sure
It's true
stopped her and told her  didn't want to
Afraid
No
mean  really did want to
but not with her
He looks at her hopefully
She smiles
' - Chris puts the finishing touches on the second laser assembly
He seems pretty pleased with himself
Kent, Bodie and Carter watch conspiratorially
Carter looks at his watch and starts for the door
Let's go girls What's that supposed to mean
It's just a f
f
figure of speech, Bodie
You guys coming to the exam or not
(finishing his work) guess we should, seeing as he's gone to all the bother of having one and everything
They all begin to exit, but then Kent holds up
You guys go ahead
have to go to the bathroom
(exiting) Okay, Kent, but  don't think that's going to help your confidence, do you
The others exit as Kent goes back to Chris' laser, opens it up and starts to fiddle with the works
(to himself) So, Mr
Funny Man, let's see how funny you think this is
' - Students wait to begin taking their final exams
Chris, Bodie and Carter enter and take their seats
Atherton is passing out the booklets
You will have exactly three hours
And remember, we believe in the honor system here, people
He enters and heads for his seat beside Chris
Good luck, buddy boy
Is it okay if  name my first child after you
Dipshit Kinsley has a nice ring to it
5R5DISSOLVE : ' - The students are busy taking the test
He seems to be breezing through it
He's taking the test
He looks up and is distressed at Chris apparent lack of trouble
Chris looks over and throws Kent a big kiss
Kent turns away immediately
' Atherton is going over some plans
Carmichael
Atherton rises
(reprimanding) This is my class hour
(loud whisper) We're past the deadline
Don't you understand, Decker's dangerous
We need those plans
(snaps back) It's not ready yet
But it will be
've got Kinsley cooking now
He'll do it
Believe me,  know how to push that kid's buttons
(rolling up the plans) Here are my drawings for the optics in the sighting system
(cutting him off) Decker wants the laser by the end of the week
(close to losing it) 'm doing all  can, damnit
Atherton storms out
Atherton enters like a dark cloud
He sits at his desk
He finishes his last question
He gets out of his seat
Sitting at his desk
Chris places his test on the desk
Atherton looks up
Chris has a big grin on his face
He takes a piece of paper and writes on it and then slides it in front of Atherton
The piece of paper
It says, " aced this
" He writes a message and slides it to Chris
piece of paper which reads, "Ace the laser
" Chris places an apple on Atherton's desk
He exits
Atherton tosses the apple in the wastebasket
The
- Chris is heading for the lab
The place has that look of exam period desertion
(muttering to himself) Okie-dokie, doc, a house doesn't have to fall on ole Chris Kinsley
' - Chris enters and prepares to test the new equipment
He aligns the secondary laser and let it charge up
He makes some final checks and then throws a switch
The laser fires for an instant but then seems to go crazy
The new laser overheats and the main chamber sparks and smokes
Chris tries to shut it down but to now avail
he tears the cover off in hopes of pulling the wiring, but he's too late
We see everything melting away as the machine eats itself
We also see a message left for Chris just before it too melts
It reads: "1 laser=1car
" Chris is on the verge of a complete mental collapse as he watches his work go up in smoke
(in anguish) No
There is nothing but the echo of his voice in response
The main laser stands like a huge, frozen bird in the empty room
In anger and frustration he swears at the machine
(') You bastard
This is your  fault
He kicks the wastepaper basket in hopes of getting rid of some of this anger; but, instead, all he gets is the basket bouncing back and hitting him in the shin
(') Shit
deserve that
It all comes back on you in the end
He suddenly stands up straight as though he were having a stroke
(') Holy shit
Inspiration takes hold and Chris begins running around like a madman, gathering up parts to the laser
(') (almost singing, he's so happy) Of course, it's so simple
Echoes, bouncing back at me and you
- Chris runs up the stairs three at a time
' He bursts in
Mitch
The room is empty
The closet door opens and Hopsfield steps out, carrying another box of cards
(') Laslo
Buddy
Have you seen Mitch
No
How did you do
(elated) failed
You shouldn't have
That's true
But never mind that now
It came to me
The power problem
solved it
Echoes
It's so simple, four little mirrors
It bounces back and supercharges the gas itself
've got to find Mitch to help me build it but it should increase the power ten-fold at least
If you see him, tell him to meet me at the lab
Bye
Chris exits, leaving Hopsfield lost in thought
- hand-painted sign hangs over the door that says: "Exam Week Decompression Here
" Chris runs in the door
- The room is full of students who are blowing off steam from studying for and taking exams
They are engaged in all sorts of silly, mindless activities, ranging from tiddly-winks and video games to watching cartoons
There are supplies of "brain food" and health drinks around
Mitch, Ick and Jordan are in the corner
Chris runs up to them
Oh, Chris
How did it go
Great
It was a snap
But Atherton said he's failing me anyway
That's terrible
You must be feeling awful
Are you all right
Thank you, Jordan
do feel terrible but  can't talk about it right now
need Mitch
Gotta go
Bye
He grabs Mitch and pulls him out
He seems to be handling it all right
5R5FADE ' - Chris knocks on the front door
Atherton answers the door
He is less than thrilled to see Chris
' (forcing his way in) Hiya, Jerry, how's it going
What do you want Kinsley
World peace, but  don't think this is the time to discuss it
What are you doing here
've already told you you've burned out and you've failed me and yourself miserably
Yes,  know that
But  thought you might be interested
'm not interested in anything you have to say
Just then a pretty  starts to come down the stairs
She is dressed only in one of Atherton's shirts
Jerry
solved the power problem, Jerry
Atherton pauses
He looks at Chris, then the girl
Debbie, go home
' - Atherton, Kent, Bodie and Carter stand by the laser as Chris explains what he's done with formulas on the blackboard
As you know,  was working on supercharging the  by means of a fusion technique using a secondary laser
Well, when  tried it,  discovered Kent had sabotaged it so it collapsed on itself
Everyone looks at Kent in disgust
(') And  want to thank him for the thought
What
The Deuterium and Fluorine take up enough space by themselves, right
Well, the mistake we've been making up to now is in trying to kick up the power by means of yet another outside source
Big and bulky, right
Well, the elegance of this is that by reflecting part of the lasing light back in the gas jets we supercharge the whole deal, increasing the power tenfold with no increase in size
This is a complete waste of time
Mitch has been preparing the laser for demonstration
He is struggling to lift several thick metal plates
Kent, make yourself useful for once and help put those plates against the wall
Kent does and everyone stands back
(') Okay, Mitch do it
This should work
Mitch switches on the main laser
It comes to life
Gases flow and a beam appears, hitting the plate without effect
Now we open the vacuum chamber
He turns a valve and the beam begins to heat up the plate
So far so good
And now, cross your fingers
He throws a switch
There's a beat
And then, suddenly, the beam glows intensely brighter, cuts through the plate, the  cabinets behind it and through the wall out into the night
Chris and Mitch jump shut the whole thing off
Sorry about the wall, sir
(looking through the hole) And the tree across the quad
(in awe) Screw the wall, you did it
You really did it
(petulant) 've done my part, too
(ignoring Kent) Okay, Kinsley
You did it
You pass
Thank you, sir
And  think we can get that job back for you at
(apoplectic) What
You can't
That's my job
've done everything you've ever asked
get your laundry, and  finished the mirror
Look
Kent runs out of the room as Mitch and Chris exchange a look and Atherton shakes his head
Kent returns, rolling a circular precision mirror one meter in diameter
See
Do you have any idea how hard it is to make a film virtually 100 per cent reflective, one micron thick and apply it to a mirror this shape
Good, Kent
(to Chris, in a hurry) have to go
have a pressing
He exits
(very happy for Chris) Let's celebrate
Absolutely
Kent, you with us
(totally frustrated) Oh
eat me
- Chris, Mitch, Ick and Jordan are looking at the laser hole in the tree
- They look at where the beam has cut a hole through the head of the statue of Dr
Bradford
- They look high up at a hole where the beam went through a telephone pole and then across the street, even higher, where it burned through a billboard on top of tavern
They cheer
- Our group is celebrating
The jukebox blares
Chris and Ick are drinking beers; Mitch and Jordan are holding hands, sharing a milkshake and feeding each other French fries
don't think 'm ready for that yet
Maybe we should wait a year; at least until  get my license
understand
There are a lot of things to be considered here
For example,  could drive
Hopsfield enters and sits down at the table
Everyone stares for a beat
(to Chris) 've been thinking about your laser solution
(a beat) figure you've increased the output to six megawatts
Yeah
What would you use that for
The applications are unlimited
Industrial for one
With the gas tanks you've designed the beam would only last for forty seconds
What good is that
don't care, Laslo
graduated
Let the engineers figure out a use for it
That's not our concern
Maybe somebody already has a use for it, one for which it's perfectly designed
You mean Atherton had something in mind all along
Looks at the facts: very high power, portable, limited firing time, unlimited range
All you'd need is a big spinning mirror and you could vaporize a human target from space
Hopsfield gets up and walks outside
Silence for a beat
This is not good
You want another beer
How big a mirror
- Chris, Mitch, Ick, Jordan and Hopsfield run down the hall and enter the lab
- The laser is gone
Chris runs next door and forces Kent's lab door open, looks in
' They all enter
The mirror is gone, too
Atherton, you worm
You pig
You fuck
Kent, you too
Chris is venting his rage on every inanimate object in the room, kicking and punching
(') should have seen it
How could  have not seen it
He lied to us
It's easy to lie to you
You trust people
'm cynic
What an asshole  am
understand how you feel, Chris, and you're right
But what we should be doing now is trying to find out what he's doing
' - Chris and Mitch sit waiting
Chris is very despondent
Very
Jordan enters
Did you do it
put a receiver in it too
(referring to Chris) Is he okay
don't know he stopped talking about an hour ago
May  see it
She holds out her hand and we see an almost microscopic electronic device
Ick enters carrying several gas masks, a gas bottle, some tubing an atomizer
Ready
- Mitch, Jordan and Ick are gathered around the closed door to Kent's room wearing the gas masks
Ick feeds the end of the tube under the door and opens the valve on the bottle
We'll have two minutes
walks by, not batting an eye
Hi, guys
' The gas has knocked Kent out
He sleeps peacefully in a chair
The door opens and our gang enters
(to Mitch) Open his mouth
He does and she pulls out some dental tools and goes to work, placing the receiver in Kent's mouth
(cont'd) It was his braces that gave me the idea
They're a perfect antenna
His whole
It's about time someone put it to good use
' - They all huddle around a homemade radio transceiver
(disguising his voice, into a microphone) Kent
Kent
Wake up, Kent
' - Kent begins to stir
We can   Mitch's voice coming from Kent's head
At first he thinks he's dreaming
(
) 'm talking to you, Kent
What
(
) said 'm talking to you
(shaking his head, violently) No
(
) Yes
(slapping himself) 'm not asleep
must be overworked
(
) You're not overworked, Kent
Well, 'm not insane
Silence
(') Am
' That remains to be seen, Kent
But we are having a conversation
' have to metabolize this
Um
who is this
(
) This is Jesus, Kent, and you've been a very naughty boy
(cracking up, laughing) All right
Who is this
Bodie
Carter
(
) am known by many names
am the One
Turn to me and be saved
Oh, Sure
(
) Cut the crap, Kent, you've built a weapon
How did you know that
(
) know everything
Oh
God
' That's right, Kent
Where is the laser now
' can't tell you
(
) How would you like to burn for the rest of time
(panicking) No, they're testing it on the twenty-seventh but  don't know where
It's classified
(
) Oh
What
(
) Nothing
want you to think about what you've done and repent, and from now on, stop playing with yourself
don't
okay ' Now what
The closets door opens and Hopsfield appears
Phase two
They are near Hopsfield's lair
Hopsfield has removed the cover from an enormous terminal
Chris seems remote and depressed
This is the phone terminal for the entire school
Okay, we tap Atherton's office phone
What about his home
All the faculty's home phone are part of the University system
(enthusiastically, looking at the maze of wiring) Great, all we have to do is find it
We'll find it
Jordan and Hopsfield set to work searching for Atherton's lines
Ick is concerned about Chris
'm depressed
Why did  listen to my parents
should have become a ping-pong pro
It's not too late
You shouldn't be depressed
It's us he used
Downtown Schmidlap
Excuse me
(Still working) Ernie "Downtown" Schmidlap
From my high school
He was captain of everything
One day he told me he wanted to "date me up
" so for a month he'd come over and 'd do his homework for him
He was going to take me to the prom
But once he passed his courses, he took Roberta Preen
stayed home and re-wired our housekeeper's
That's awful
You think that hurts
You should've met my Uncle Stan
He was a Weasel
That bad, huh
No, that was his lodge
The Royal order of Friendly Weasels
Every Wednesday when  was eight, he'd take me down to his lodge meeting and he'd challenge people to call out two five-digit numbers
had to multiply them in my head faster than a guy could do it on a calculator
They'd bet on me
Of course, after the meeting, he'd take me for ice cream
That's nice
Well
he'd take me to the supermarket and  had to dip my hand in
've got his office
've got his home
- They've all made themselves comfortable as they sit and wait for the phone tap to produce results
Hopsfield has wired a speaker so that they can hear, Why doesn't your phone ring, you jogging, syphilitic microbe
(sotto, to Mitch) think he's coming around
Suddenly, from the speaker, we  the sound of Atherton's phone being picked up
(
0
/) Hello (
) Is this Jerome Atherton
(
) Yes, it is
(
) This is Bill Carlisle
saw your television show the other night about the reproductive system
(
) Thank you,  hope you enjoyed it
(
) love it
Everything you said was copied word for word from my book and  expect a lot of money for it
(
) Need  remind you, it's public television, an attempt to teach people something
And all you can think of is personal greed
It's people like you that make me feel bad about being American
(
) 'm Canadian (
) 'm not surprised
Good day
They hang up
God, he's good at that
He almost gets away with it
That's the most manipulative guy 've ever seen
mean heard
He does get away with it
Not anymore
- Everyone lies asleep in various places and positions, Mitch awakens
He is amazed to find Jordan asleep on his shoulder, so amazed he has to wake her
Jordan
Hmmmmmmmm
You were sleeping
was
Gee (snuggling) guess you relax me
(proudly) Wow
(awakening) What's going on
put Jordan to sleep
And you're proud of that
Yeah
The speaker comes to life with the sound of the receiver being groped for and then Atherton's groggy voice
(
) (mumbling) Yes
hello (
) Jer
Dave Decker How are you
(
) Christ, Dave what time is it
(
) Nine thirty here in Washington
thought you Californians all get up early and exercise
Ha, ha This is it
That's the guy  saw at his house with the daughter
(
) Very funny, Dave
What do you want
'm busy
(
) It sounds like it
Listen, 'll be out there tomorrow for the test but  want you to go to the Marsh this afternoon and check optics systems one more time
(
) Why
(
) Because 'm in charge, Doctor
Goodbye
He hangs up
All look to Chris
Well
(comes to life) It's happening
It's only weapon if it works, right
(determined) You're absolutely right
The time has come, people
No more being used
No more Downtown Schmidlaps or Uncle Stans or Jerry Athertons
We're going to take responsibility for our own brains
Remember, without ethics there can be no morality
Without morality there is no society and without society there can be no fast food restaurants
So the whole country, nay, in the world, is counting on us to get even in a big way
Thank you
Nice logic
Thanks
Synchronize watches
Why
It's just something you say at a time like this
don't need a watch
Okay, forget it
Let's go
' - Atherton comes out and heads for his car carrying an over-night bag
As he drives away we   that Ick has been spying on him
- Ick is hiding behind some bushes on a knoll
he is looking through binoculars
Atherton's car is passing through a high security gate into Marsh field
- Chris, Mitch and Hopsfield are loading the last of several large boxes into a beat-up van
' - The van pulls up in front
Painted on the side is a plumber's logo
Mitch, Jordan and Ick start unloading boxes
Chris goes to the front door
Chris picks the lock
' - Chris and Mitch enter to see Hopsfield as he works at the computer, attempting to interface with another computer
Each time he hits the keys the  replies "Negative
" Boy, these secret fields are so untrusting
So we can't get on-base clearance
guess not
Forget it
We'll balls it
Jordan enters carrying two
cards
How do these look
Two fake
's with Mitch's and Chris's picture on them
Perfect
hope
What if they don't fool anybody
They shoot us
- Technicians check monitors and prepare for the coming test
Nearby stands a firing command module very reminiscent of the pilot's compartment in the opening sequence
Atherton goes over last minute details with various people
He seems distracted as an engineer discusses a problem with him
Are you all right
What
Oh, yes, fine
Have you ever had a feeling that there's something terribly wrong
No
- There are two Air force Police  in the shack
Chris and Mitch pulls up in Kent's Citroen, behind a government sedan awaiting clearance at the gate
They are dressed as technicians and Mitch sports a moustache
Mitch is a wreck and Chris doesn't help
He begins humming the theme from "Mission Impossible
" (
) All clear, Mr
Decker
Just follow the yellow line
Chris accidentally hits the horn
Through the windshield we  Decker and the guard look back
Chris recognizes Decker
(covering) How long does it take
Mitch whimpers
Decker's car pulls away
The guard uses one finger to motion Chris forward
Chris pulls the car up
The guard leans in the window
Mitch, obviously shaking, hands his to Chris who hands them to both guard
Snap it up, will ya
We just flew in
We're tired
We're hungry
We have this stupid car
The guard turns away and walks into the shack
Are you out of your mind
You have to intimidate these guys
The guard returns
You're not on the list
Of course not
We're classified
We  the phone
The second guard answers it
An Air Force Officer is on the phone
An impatient Atherton stands beside him
don't know what he should look for, just tell him if he sees anything out of the
let me tell him
He grabs the phone
Aren't you guys a little young to be technicians
Lasers are a young science
There, fine, now you've made me say it
Now we're all in trouble
Mitch looks like he's going to die
Look, 'll call the duty officer
He starts towards the phone shack
The other guard is still on the phone
(his demeanor changing) Excuse me
The guard turns back
(') Look, pal, don't call anybody
We're four hours late
It's our jobs
Give us a break, will ya
Someday you might be in the private sector, right
beat
Mitch dies
Chris gives the guard a goofy grin
The guard waves them through
The car pulls away
The guard returns to the booth
We're supposed to look for anything out of the ordinary
Okay
- -1 Bomber, painted black, sits in the glow of the work lights
Technicians, who are wearing jumpsuits similar to the ones Mitch and Chris have on, are busy working around the plane
Chris and Mitch   and walk up to the plane
couple of the technicians watch them curiously as they go up the stairs into the bomb bay
Chris and Mitch enter
Three technicians are inside the plane running last minute checks on the laser, which sits in the middle of the cabin
Chris crosses to the technician who is in the middle of the cabin
He watches him making mental notes as he checks the program
The technician turns, sensing his presence
Nice work
Keep it up
Mitch, meanwhile, checks out the laser optics
After a beat, one of the technicians signals for the others to complete their jobs and exit
They start to file out
One of them turns and looks at Chris, who is just standing there
What
The technician shakes his head uncertainly and exits with the others
Finally, Mitch and Chris are alone
Chris opens the
It contains a cellular phone, a modem and an  Processor
'  - The computer receives a signal
Hopsfield turns to Jordan and Ick
We've got a connection
They're in
Get the EEPROMs
Mitch opens up the computer and clips a couple of power lines and pulls out four computer chips and hands them to Chris, who plugs them into the processor
Chris picks up the phone
(into phone) Abbott to Costello
' Jordan picks up the phone
(into phone) This is Costello
Go ahead, Abbott
(into phone) Costello,  who's on first
Mitch hits him impatiently
(') We've got the goodies
(
) We have the target coordinates computed for trajectory adjustment
Great
Shoot
' Hopsfield's computer screen fills with machine code of ones and zeros
He begins searching through many screens of code
Oh, oh
What
Oh, nothing
Chris and Mitch freeze as a mechanic walks by the open bomb bay door
- Technicians are checking monitors and a radar scope at a control panel
Atherton is in the rear of the room briefing a group of civilians and military brass
Amongst them is Decker
Atherton points to a drawing on a large chart
The plane will reach an altitude of sixty-five thousand feet
When it is over, the target will fire the laser from here
(points to the firing module) for five point two seconds
Carmichael enters
They're all set for the final onboard check
Fine
Right this way, gentlemen
They all follow Atherton and Decker to the exit at the rear of the room
Chris and Mitch sweat it out
' Hopsfield is scanning the screens
think 've found it
May  have the coordinates, please
(reading from paper) Thirty-four degrees, ten minutes, fifteen seconds North; one hundred eighteen degrees, nine minutes, three seconds West
Hopsfield enters the data into his computer
(into phone) We're sending
(into phone) We're taking
Mitch suddenly panics as he looks out
' Atherton and his group come around the corner of a building and head for the plane
They're coming this way
(into phone, overly calm) You may be interested in knowing that Mitch reports that Herr Professor is approaching and 'm not even sweating
Isn't that remarkable
' Please hurry
Atherton's coming
(typing furiously) Please,  don't work well under pressure
He finishes
(cont'd) There
hope that does it
(into phone) Okay, Chris
mean Abbott
Hello
hello
hello
Atherton and his group approach and enter the bomb bay
As they enter, there is no sign of Chris and Mitch
Atherton checks out the laser and the computer
The others examine various gauges and switches and the flight deck
Everything all right
Of course
As the group exits the plane, Chris and Mitch drop out of the forward landing gear well in the background
(turning back) Oh,  forgot
' glimpse of Chris and Mitch as they disappear around the corner of the building
Uncertain of what he has just seen
(
) What is it
Nothing
- - Kent looks the worse for wear as he sits surrounded by psychology books dealing with schizophrenia
(
) Hi, Kent
(surprised) Oh,  thought you were gone
(
) Not yet
Have you been touching yourself
Yes
mean, no
'  - (into mike) Good, Kent
Dad, my father, you know, God, wants to show you something
(
/) Why
mean, what
've learned not to ask
(
) He wants you to wait on the sidewalk at six thirty nine Ivy Crest Drive at precisely six-oh-eight this morning
Ivy Crest
(
) Just wait there and you shall receive a sign
Do not despair and do not go inside
Why not
Hello
Hello, Jesus
student walks in and looks at him strangely
- Atherton and company watch the bank of monitors as the flight controller clears the bomber for take off
- Chris and Mitch jump into the van and drive off
Some monitors show the bomber climbing while others show the desert target area
It is a mock up of a Presidential motorcade
The open cars are filled with test dummies, and are linked together and are being towed slowly across the desert by a tractor
(into mike) Crossbow One, radar contact
Climb and maintain flight level six five oh
' The van pulls up and parks across the street
Chris and Mitch get out
Just then, a Volvo pulls up and Jordan, Ick and Dr
Meredith get out
Dr
Meredith is wearing a bathrobe, pajamas and slippers
Ah, Mr
Kinsley
Why am  not surprised to see you here
Perhaps you have the explanation for this so-called event 'm suppose to witness
Yes, sir,  do, but first may  take this opportunity to compliment you on  your fashion sense
(into mike) Crossbow One, turn left to two eight zero
(
/) Two eight zero, roger
technician hits a switch and a monitor pops on
Crosshairs dominate the center of the screen
The desert floor rushes by
Atherton turns to a specialist standing by
Norman, if you'd be so kind
This cockpit mock-up duplicates the shuttle flight deck and we've placed it here to demonstrate the firing technique
The specialist takes his place inside the command module
(
/) We are thirty one  from the target
(mike) Roger, Crossbow
Open the doors
The doors open to reveal clouds rushing past and the ground far below
' These are rather strong accusations, Chris
Yes, sir,  know
If they're true, 'm going to need some proof
think we're going to be able to accommodate you in just a minute, sir
Looking past Meredith, Chris sees Kent approaching
as he arrives at the house and stars up at it
He glances at his watch and waits impatiently
Inside the firing module, the specialist pulls down the target sighting device and puts his hands on the joysticks
Power on
minus fifty and counting
The large mirror lowers into its firing position and the laser powers up
'  - The group watch Kent, who is nervously pacing back and forth, talking to himself
(to Mitch) Boy, if this works, he's going to start a new religion
If it doesn't work
Chris shoots him a censoring look
This countdown continues
Monitors display the target sight, the pilot's sighting screen of the ground and a camera's view of the bomber
Trajectory command relay, locked
Now, Norm here has firing control
The target motorcade is sighted
The laser mirror and sighting lens move in unison as they line up on target
The crosshairs line up on the sighting monitor
' What's he doing
Kent has now started toward the front door
told him not to go in
(muttering to Jesus) Look, this is Jerry's house, we're very close, so if you're not going to answer me, then 'm going in
He reaches for the front door
(') here  come
(shouting) Kent
Stop
who turns and sees them
Everyone is riveted to the sighting monitor
Target locked
In ten, nine, eight
As the countdown continues
The computer comes to life and electronically unlocks the laser optics from the sighting camera
The mirror turns to the left
The aerial view of the motorcade remains centered on the sighting monitor
' Kent opens the front door and enters
(to himself) That looked like Dr
Meredith in a bathrobe
First 'm hearing things, now 'm seeing things
He closes the door
(') Okay, God
Let me have it
The room is dark, lit only by morning light coming through a large stained glass window at the top of the stairs
In the middle of the room is what looks like a large above-ground swimming pool, covered in aluminum foil
Kent is amazed
three, two, one, bingo
He hits the trigger
The laser fires
The laser beam traces through the atmosphere
The group waits expectantly
Nothing happens to the target
' Chris and Mitch, who are running toward the house, are stopped in their tracks by the incredible sight of the red laser beam shooting down out of the heavens, striking the grass, tracking across the lawn then up the wall of Atherton's house
' The beam strikes the window and for one tiny moment causes the most incredible light show anyone has ever seen
(in awe) Oh
The window is obliterated by the laser light, which crashes down directly onto the aluminum foil-covered pool
(') Oh, my
The foil is heated instantly in the laser light and there is the  of tiny explosions, building to a roar
In a second, the foil rises violently and tears open
Kent picks up a piece of debris and examines it
Popcorn
In the next instant, he is engulfed in popcorn
' The beam disappears as suddenly as it came
Everyone stands in awe
few kernels fly out of the broken window, then a storm
' Kent and furniture are being forced up the stairs by a rising tide of popping popcorn
He struggles against it, loses, and sinks into the mound like a dinosaur in quicksand
' The windows are filling up with popcorn
Finally, they crack and break as popcorn forces its way out of the house wherever it can
Kent
Chris and Mitch head for the front door
Suddenly, it bursts open and Kent is carried out by a moving wall of popcorn
People furiously check systems
don't understand
Did it fire
Yes, we indicate a shot
We've got another problem, though
It's not shutting down
The computer is still working
The laser optics and equipment begin to melt
It's been wired to self-destruct
The devastated group watches the laser self destruct on the monitor
Nice going, Jer
Something's wrong here
Unlock the bird's eye
He takes over the command module sighting system 'm tracing where the shot went
We watch as the monitor's view swings away and across a residential neighborhood, coming to rest on a bird's eye view of his own house
(') Oh, no
The monitor view moves in to reveal what looks like a growing mushroom
What have you done
Retired
' The group looks on as the mountain of popcorn continues to engulf the house
Meredith goes to see if Kent is all right
(to Mitch) Do you think we used too much
Maybe a little
Well,  guess we all learned something here today
What
don't know, but it seemed like the right thing to say, didn't it
It did to me
As they continue to watch the destruction of the house, and various neighbors come out to see what's what, a Winnebago pulls up and stops
Hopsfield gets out
think  you used too much
Really
'm sorry you missed it
Yeah, well,  had to pack
Why
'm getting married
What
To whom
(looking at the -Haul) What is all this
Oh,  won
Only thirty-one point eight percent though
have to figure that out
But not this summer
Mitch suddenly sees Sherry standing at the Winnebago door
Sherry
(kissing Hopsfield) Hi
Isn't it wonderful
finally found him
Number  One
've been looking for him for ten years
What can  do
She loves me
Right
Congratulations
Thanks
Anyway, we probably won't ever get to see you again, so, bye
What do you mean
Where are you going
've got a little survival place in Wyoming
We're going to live there
Yeah, it's getting too weird around here
See ya
They climb into the Winnebago and it pulls away
The others watch it go
You think it's getting too weird around here
Absolutely
didn't notice
like it
In the background, the popcorn has split the walls of the house and finally lifts the roof off like the top of a pot
The whole house tilts to its side and the popping stops
As we  , Atherton's car pulls up and he gets out, dumbstruck
Dr
Meredith walks over to him and confronts him
Kent joins Chris and the others who watch
