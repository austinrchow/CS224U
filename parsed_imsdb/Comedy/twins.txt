With him is another scientist -- (this is  -- already imperious, already a prick)

explained that to him when he was two years old

-     -  () 4 Most of them young, 20s and 30s
They are being given a medical examination by a group of doctors, including Werner
(
) And it wasn't the complexity of Julius's parentage
He knew that unlike other little boys, he didn't have just one, but half a dozen fathers, all very distinguished men

Another nurse emerges from the delivery room, holding up a second  -- this one is  with rage

Julius is hurriedly packing a small leather suitcase, watched by Werner
Werner hands over a photograph: it's a picture of a younger Werner, Traven, and the six fathers
It's your only copy -- -- My need for it is only sentimental -- yours may be practical -- Julius slips the photo into his suitcase
Thank you -- 'll miss you

(in Japanese; subtitled) It was an honor to study under you, Master
Without warning, the Oriental tries to strike Julius in the face with the side of his hand, but Julius blocks the blow
(in English) Ahhh, always on guard
You have learned well, Julius-san
Julius gives a last hug to Werner

Well, if a woman loved my brother enough to marry him, she might have a sister who'd feel the same way about me
That often  happens with twins, you know
Julius -- please -- don't get your hopes up
Your brother doesn't even know you exist
Julius gets in the boat and casts off
The boat takes off like a streak
Julius, in perfect rhythm, increases the pace
The boat is almost flying across the water
(loudly as he disappears in the horizon) Of course he does
've always known there was something missing in my life
And deep down, 'm sure Vincent feels the same way
He's probably just like meeeee

(a bit surprised but not panicked) What's he doing back so early
Vince jumps out of bed, starts pulling on his clothes while Carla slips into a bathrobe
(
) Carla
You gonna cook me some breakfast or what
Be right down, sweetheart
Vince checks his appearance in a dresser mirror, straightens his Armani suit, brushes his hair, pulls it into a fashionable ponytail
He cuts a stylish figure
Noticing an expensive gold lighter on the dresser top, he covertly pockets it
Carla pushes him towards the open French doors
Hurry up
gotta make breakfast
You're wonderful, Carla
Your husband doesn't deserve to kiss your feet

It's very clear he likes  the danger, being on the edge
In another life, he was  probably Errol Flynn
Now, he gives Carla an Errol Flynn  smile -- -- and with that, he leaps into space

(he's got a good voice) 'Oh what a beautiful morning, Oh what a beautiful day'
Now he does something surprising -- not starting to drive, we expect that
What we don't expect is his destination -- because what he does is simply turn the nearest corner and drive right back to the house he just snuck out of
(exiting the car, still singing) 'everything's going my way'

He grips Vince by the shoulders

Sometimes 'm so happy,  want to pick you up and hug you

Linda suddenly freezes at the sight of Morris Klane scoping the room
Morris is still wearing a bandage from his beating by Julius
Did you tell anybody we were coming to Santa Fe
(unconcerned) Well,  phoned work and told them we wouldn't be coming in for a few days
Oh,  forgot to tell you -- we've been fired
(tight-lipped) Let's go to the ladies' room
But we just went
Linda takes Marnie by the hand, just as -- each with a cast on his foot, each supported by a crutch, force them back into the booth
Hello, girls -- Do you mind if we sit down and enjoy the music with you

Burt and Bob open their jackets, revealing they have guns on the girls

This is no bluff -- Asshole -- Burt gives a small head signal and two very large men stand up from a nearby table
They each grab one of Julius's arms
Meet my cousins
(to the Klanes) Get these jerks outside
Just then, so sudden and quick that it's over as soon as it begins, Julius double kicks the seated Burt and Bob in the head
They're out cold before they realize they've been attacked
Without stopping, Julius whips his arms together in front of him bringing Sam and Dave into painful contact with each others' head
They, too, are now out cold
Vince uses this opportunity to stomp, with all his might, on the toe of Morris who's busy watching Julius dismantle his relatives
Morris screams and lets go of Vince, who runs to the nearby pool table, grabs a cue and slams it over the head of the now hobbling Morris
All five Klanes are out cold

Vince watches him, glances at his watch, and begins to edge towards the door
Uh

Where you going

Vince picks up one of Julius' heavy tomes
Maybe read her a bedtime story

Julius looks fondly at his brother as he sees him to the door
What a day, Vincent, we visited our birth place
We bought new clothes
We danced the waltz

Do  look like a young artist to you, Linda

And  know why she's here, too
It's got nothing to do with my mother and everything to do with money

And maybe he'll be better off alone

to reveal we are -- - In front of the merry-go-round
Werner purchases a hand- ful of tickets from the vendor, hands one each to Mary Anne, Linda and Marnie
just can't get over how alike they are
The three women all turn and gaze affectionately back at -- Walking along the path behind them
We assume it's them the women were discussing, until we notice that each of them is pushing a double-stroller with identical twin babies inside
It's the twin children that are the source of the women's wonder, and Vince and Julius' as well
Vince and Julius both yawn simultaneously
They kepp you up all night again, too

They both stop the strollers, look down lovingly at their kids, begin fondling them
Vince and Julius, simultan- eously flip identical baby rattles and shake them at their twins
(to baby #1) think you need your diaper changed
(to baby #2) What a surprise -- so do you
Vince becomes aware of the condition of his kids' diapers
(checks his babies) Not you, too -- It's not a competition, you know
They both start pushing their strollers again
Just think what we'd be like if we'd been raised together
Now that's a scary thought
They both yawn simultaneously once again

-- -                          182 Vince and Julius are sitting on adjoining horses
Linda and Marnie hand their sons up to them, watched proudly by Mary Anne
The merry-go-round starts moving, and the last image we see is of Vince and Julius on the horses, holding their twin sons
