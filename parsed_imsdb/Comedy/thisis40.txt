40 Written by Judd Apatow - (39) and  (39) are having fantastic sex in the shower
Debbie moans loudly
Pete is strong and sure of himself
In total control
Oh Pete
Oh my god
This is crazy
Oh my god
So incredible
Want to know a secret
took a Viagra
What
took a Viagra
Those things totally work
This is awesome
Why don't  use this every day
What
What did you do
Wait
Stop
Debbie gets out of the shower
Pete follows
What's the matter
You just took a Viagra to have sex with me
thought it would make it better
It was better
It takes some of the pressure off
Because you can't get hard without a Viagra
Is it because you don't think 'm sexy
thought you'd think it was fun for me to supersize it for once
That is the worst birthday present you could ever give someone
was just trying to go turbo for your birthday
() 2
(') My hard-ons are still in analog
This shit's digital
don't want a turbo penis
like your medium soft one
Look,  can get it up
Just not that far up
Where did you get this
got it from Barry
What
You got it from Barry
Why do you care
This is my dick we're talking about, not yours
We are young people
We don't need medication to have sex
only took it because it's your birthday
thought you'd like it
Happy fucking fortieth birthday
am not forty
And  don't want to have a husband who has to take Viagra to get a hard-on
don't have to take it every time, but once in a while
Fuck forty
Forty can suck my dick
-   40 /'  - Pete sneaks down the hallway
He kisses  (13) as he wakes her
She wants to be left alone
3
Your breath smells weird
Pete breathes all over her as he talks
Wake up, wake up
Time to get up
'  - Pete lifts a sleeping  (8) out of bed and walks her downstairs
It looks ridiculous because she is too tall to hold her like she is a baby
- Pete and the kids set up a tray of muffins and donuts on the table and decorate the room with birthday balloons, streamers, etc
Pete sneaks bacon, cupcakes, and mini donuts into his mouth occasionally
The house is a bit more cluttered and messier than when we last saw it in Knocked Up
- Debbie opens a window and sneaks a cigarette
(
) We're ready
She holds her cigarette with a yellow dish washing glove
She puts out the cigarette and goes through an elaborate routine of hiding the smell of smoke
She puts some weird oil in her hair and uses a wet nap on her neck and clothes and brushes her teeth
She sprays cologne and walks through it
- Pete and the kids hold a cake and sing "Happy Birthday" as Debbie walks in
When they are done she blows out the candles on the cake which says "Happy 38th Birthday
" Make a wish
,   - The kids eat cereal
Sadie watches Lost on her iPad while Pete and Debbie talk in the kitchen
4
Can  watch Lost
You can't handle Lost
It's too violent, and you won't understand
If  don't understand it, why can't handle it
Because you're eight
can handle it
've seen a shark eat a guy on Shark Week
Shark Week is fake
No, it's not
All of it is reenactments
know but they-- That's scary
You shouldn't be allowed to watch that
--they show the reenactments but they actually happened
It's going to give you nightmares
can handle a nightmare
You're a nightmare every day for me
- Pete clears the breakfast dishes
Hey
Don't eat that cupcake
5
What
The one you just put into the sink
saw you were hiding that
This cupcake
You think 'm going to eat this cupcake
Yeah
so don't want this cupcake
Look
He turns on the faucet and pours water on the cupcake
You're still going to eat it
'm going to eat this cupcake
Just put it in the trash
What would you like to do today
Your choice
Anything
Yeah, anything
Just hang out with you guys
Don't you want to get a massage
Or do something fun
Forty's huge
'm turning thirty-eight
Okay
Thirty-eight
We'll move on
Isn't it weird that our birthday is the same week and that we're going to have a party, and it's just for me
6
No
don't think it's weird at all
Because you're turning forty and 'm turning thirty-eight
Come on
Do you really want to be one of those ladies who's just so insecure about their age and they lie and then they've got to remember
You don't get it
You don't understand how it works
don't want to shop at old lady stores don't want to go to
Jill and Chicos and Ann Taylor Loft
'm not ready yet
need two more years
That is so insane, it kind of makes sense
What did you get me for my birthday
thought you said that we shouldn't get each other gifts this year
What do you mean
You're supposed to get me a surprise gift
This is a big birthday
'm turning forty
'  - Charlotte plays the theme from The Office on her keyboard
(
) Mom
'  - Sadie tears apart her closet looking for clothes
Mom
Why can't  get new clothes
Nothing fits me
God damn it
7
- Debbie is in workout gear
Pete enters wearing a lycra outfit with all sorts of logos on it
He is a complete bicycling asshole
am going to work out
'll be back in about an hour
Hey, did your father call to wish you a happy birthday
No
That's no surprise
Debbie leaves
Pete picks the soaking wet cupcake out of the sink and takes a bite
- Debbie runs up a long flight of stairs with her trainer Her friend  trails behind
Come on
Coming
You've got to keep up with us, sweetheart
That's why your body looks like your body and her body looks like her body
Before, after
Before, after
You guys just go on without me
'm just gonna
fuck
- We see Pete in a large group of bikers riding down San Vicente
Pete's friend  is part of the group
Hey, thanks for letting me join this team
8
It's not really a team, it's just a bunch of guys who get together and ride
know,  know
car makes a right turn in front of Pete, nearly hitting him
Pete bangs on the back of the car
Bike lane, asshole
It's always the guy in the fucking Infiniti
- Debbie is doing sit-ups while talking to Jason, who holds her feet down
In the background, Barb stretches on a yoga ball
So why on earth is Pete taking Viagra
What's going on
don't know
think maybe he just isn't attracted to me anymore
That is ridiculous
If you were my girlfriend,  would not need a Viagra
would need an anti-Viagra pill
To try not to get a boner
But everyone gives you a boner
Don't sell yourself short like that
You give me a boner
(whispers) Barb doesn't give me a boner
Maybe things are just getting stale
That's why maybe  work out really hard
Maybe he'll be able to get a boner again
Why do you need to have sex, Deb
Sex is the number one thing people fight about
() 9
(') You stop having sex, there will be no more fights
am living proof
have no sex, and  am the happiest 've ever been
knew it
knew you were not having sex
can see it on your face
It's all puckered and pained
'm enjoying our non-sex period, that's all 'm saying
Don't you miss it
Well,  wouldn't know, because don't have any feeling down there anymore
have nerve damage from my -section so everything is just kinda- She's numb down there
could sit down hard on a fire hydrant, and  wouldn't even know that  was sitting
could get stung by a hornet down there, and would not feel it
You could put anything in there, and  would not know what the object was
used to pee in a nice stream, and now it just kind of goes like a shower head
That is the saddest thing 've ever heard
think you need a family
Don't you want a family
No,  think  want to Clooney it
Clooney it
10
Yup
He doesn't seem happy
Yeah, he is
No
He's lonely
No, he's not
See,  think he has sad eyes
Aw, you sweet little thing
He's doing sad, lonely eyes
To get the next lady
can do it too, watch
Jason demonstrates
bet George Clooney is really lonely
Just him and his pig
You'd fuck him
wouldn't
So would you
would
wouldn't feel it but- You'd fuck him with your numb vagina
Yes, you would
Ocean's thirteen inches, that's what you'd find out
Do you think
11
- Pete and Barry eat frosted scones, happy to get some alone time to delay their return home
mean that was idiotic
You have to understand
That's like the one thing you don't do is tell her you used Viagra
think that's even on the warning label
We're in one of those phases where everything the other person says just annoys the shit out of each other
All the time
It's a blast
Don't worry about it
You just gotta ride that out
This sounds terrible but do you ever wonder what it would be like if, say, you were separated by something bigger, like death
Like her death
have given it a fair amount of thought
Not in a painful way
Just quietly slid into death
Like a gas leak
Absolutely
It has got to be peaceful
mean this is the mother of your children
'd want it to be a peaceful -- just like, drift, into a coma, from which she never awakens
Then you move on
Then you're a widower
That's just it
People love widowers
12
They love widowers
It's like the polar opposite of divorced guys
It's the best
It's like, oh, that poor widower
You know
If  could only-- Somehow
make him happy
Somehow ease his pain
cocksuck away his sadness
- The family is driving
Sadie watches an episode of Lost on an iPad
The Pixies play on the stereo, and Pete sings along
Did you know that the Pixies did this song about a Salvador Dali short film called "Un Chien Andalou"
This music doesn't make people happy
This song kicks off Doolittle, one of the best albums of the last thirty years
An important record
Look how angry you get while listening to this
(beat) It's my birthday
You don't control the radio on my birthday
control the radio on my birthday
Debbie switches the radio and sings along to "Take On Me" by Ah-Hah
13
Sadie stares at her iPad
We see a violent scene
Sadie's watching Lost
Sadie, how many times have you watched Lost this week
've only watched eleven
have eight more and then 'm done
How many are there
hundred and fourteen
Are you kidding me
You can't watch over a hundred episodes of a show in five weeks
It'll melt your brain
It's not melting my brain, it's blowing my mind
That's really bad, Sadie
You're not allowed to do that
My relationship with Lost is not your business
It's extremely personal
Charlotte grabs for Sadie's iPad, then starts trying to lick her
(') Stop it
Be nice to your sister
You guys are going to cherish each other one day
Stop it
Stop
14
- Pete and Debbie get out of the car and walk down the street
It's your birthday, you don't need to go to the store
know, just five minutes
think Desi and Jodi are fighting
All right, five minutes
But then 'm pulling you out
'  - Pete and Debbie enter and we see their two employees, and a new, gorgeous employee, , who is up on a ladder
Hi
How's Jodi treating you
Jodi
Oh, Jodi's my new
She's like a little kitty cat
Sometimes she comes and rubs up against my leg
You're a ball of shit
She loves me
Huh
Debbie goes behind the register
She looks at Jodi
(') Can you do inventory so that we can do the sidewalk sale
And you really need to pay attention to the numbers because we have twelve thousand dollars unaccounted for
think it's probably Desi
She's been having a really hard time using these simple computers
() 15
(') It's because she's stupid
think she might be stealing
She's not stealing
She's our best employee
She made nine grand last month
Well, how much did  make
You brought in twenty-two hundred
That's not bad
Well, that's not that good
mean, 'm not comparing you, but you're not as good
Pete is still staring at Desi on the ladder
(to Desi) All right
See you
Pete walks over to Debbie
(') don't think she's wearing underwear
What
It's all dark up there
What
Why are you looking
didn't mean to look,  just said, `Hey- woah
' There it was
Maybe she's wearing dark underwear
Yeah
Maybe she has underwear that has a picture of a vagina painted on it
16
Stop looking
Desi comes down to help a  at the front of the store
Maybe some deep oranges and browns and maybe dark greens
That would really play up your features
'll just take out my AmEx and you pick what stuff you think is good
- We see quick cuts of Debbie playing with the kids on the trampoline outside
She does a full flip and lands on her feet
Pete is nowhere to be found
Woo
Where's daddy
think he went to poop
Pete
- Debbie walks down the hall and into the bathroom without knocking
Pete is on the toilet playing Scrabble on his iPad
What are you doing
Going to the bathroom
We're all downstairs waiting for you
You've been up here for a really long time now
Oh, 'm almost done
'll be down in a second
17
Charlotte just did her first flip on the trampoline, and she landed on her feet
She was really proud of herself
Oh, that's great
And you missed it
She'll do it again
It's just that this is the fourth time you've gone to the bathroom today
Give me a break
Why is your instinct to escape
It's not my instinct to escape from you
It is my instinct to come into the bathroom when  need to go to the bathroom
How come  don't smell anything
It's because  shoved an Altoid up my ass before  came in here
Let me see then
What
Let me see
No, 'm not going to let you see
You're not going to let me see because you're not taking a poop
18
've been flushing as  go
You're flushing as you go
Who takes a half hour to go to the bathroom
(thinks for a second) John Goodman
She angrily grabs his iPad and walks out
(') Don't press Enter
'm not sure want to make that move
- sign outside reads: "Tonight Only: Graham Parker" -  - Pete stands on stage speaking to a small crowd
You know, when  started this label, my dream was to work with musicians and bands whose music just admired so much
The person that  thought, "My god, wouldn't it be incredible to work with" was Graham Parker
Tonight we have him
Solo
Because we couldn't afford to fly in The Rumour
The crowd applauds as Graham Parker (60's) leaps on stage
Pete and Debbie watch Graham sing a very moving song
The song is fantastic and personal, but clearly not commercial
We watch Debbie
Although the music is great, it's a little depressing and not working on her
She quickly gets bored
- Pete and Debbie are driving home
It's just not my kind of music
19
Really
What is your kind of music
like Lady Gaga
Oh, god, of course you do
What
Shallow dance music
It's not
It's fun, and it's about release and sex and power
You know, you don't have to like it
It's really not for you, that's fine
This is a job
This is not a hobby
Can't you love him just as a hobby
And sign a fifteen-year-old hot girl so we can eat
Graham Parker and The Rumour had two albums in the Rolling Stone Top 500 Best Albums of All Time
Two of `em
If  can just sell ten thousand records to his hardcore fan base, we're golden
An ambulance drives by, sirens blaring
(pause, then laughing) The last of Graham Parker's fans just died
'  - Pete and Debbie walk in mid-argument
Sadie is listening to a song on her iPhone
Sadie
Sadie, what are you listening to
() 20
(') Okay, this is music that makes people happy
And this is what people buy
Right, girls
She puts Sadie's iPod in a dock and plays the Nikki Minaj rap "Roman's Revenge
" They all start rapping along to it
They all laugh and dance and go crazy
Pete turns the iPod off
(') Why did you take it off
Now, something that really rocks
Pete puts on "Rooster" by Alice In Chains
(') This is called good music
From somebody's heart
This is bumming me out
This isn't fun
Just listen to these words, okay
don't understand the words
This is lyrics, this is poetry
This is what is going to survive in a hundred years
It just doesn't make people happy
It makes me happy
can dance to it
Pete starts dancing around like it is fun
You're the only one in the room who's happy
Pete stops his music
21
Sometimes,  wish just one of you had a dick
Well, we don't want one
- Pete sits with the kids and eats breakfast
Debbie scurries around him to prep the kids for school
(to Pete) Is there something that you can do to be helping me right now
Yeah, 'm ready to help
Just tell me what to do
Can you go get a lunch box or something
For me or for them
Charlotte runs away towards her room
Sadie screams
Charlotte
've got a test
'm coming
'm coming
Charlotte, 'm going to kill you
Debbie covers Sadie's mouth
Shhh
- Debbie drives the kids to school
22
- Debbie runs Charlotte into the school
Along the way they see a lot of parents
Debbie says "Hi" to them in the way that lets us know that she does not know anybody's name
Debbie says "Hello" to a  -- , towing a seven-year-old boy
Hi, any day now, huh
-- Not really
Three more months
Another parent, , and her adorable child walk over
Katie's dying for a play date
Let's hook these two up
That would be great, 'll call you
Beth and Katie walk off
No
"No" what
No
What
She's sweet
She's evil
/
'  - As they walk into class, the teacher pulls Debbie aside
Hi
Listen, Charlotte really needs to get here on time because she needs the extra time to just settle in
Oh
We are on time
23
Being on time means being early
Oh
Okay
Well, it's nice to see you in class
We'd like to see more of you
come to-- The teacher walks away before Debbie can defend herself
Hi Debbie
Hi, Grandma Molly
How are you
'm so happy about the science fair
It's going very well heard
love you
You look so beautiful
Happy birthday
just learned it's your fortieth
Are you forty
Yeah
remember when  was forty, and then  blinked and there  was, going to be ninety
My god, where did it go
One day you're going to blink, and you're going to be ninety, and  won't be around to see it
And that makes me very sad
'm telling you, 'm warning you
Don't blink
Don't blink
- As Debbie pulls out of the lot, she lights a cigarette
'   - Pete paces around his office on the phone
24
(
) And then you missed the mortgage payment, and that's the second mortgage
You've got to tighten your belt
You've got to go home, sit down, look at your expenses, come clean with Debbie
Oh, god
can't tell Debbie
(
) You have to tell her, Pete
She knows it's bad, but she has no idea just how bad
(
) If you sell the house, it'll really buy you some time
No
Debbie's not really into selling the house
(
) As your business manager and your friend,  can't recommend that
(beat) Hey, how funny would it be if bought your house
Okay
Bye
(
) Hang in there
Pete is with  and , employees at his record label
They are watching an electronic press kit cut together for Graham Parker
There is a montage of him performing throughout the years from the seventies to the present
What are you doing
'm contextualizing him as one of the great figures in rock history
25
You can't show him in his prime in `77 and then jump straight to him as he is now
It's terrifying
You have to reverse it
You've got to show him as he is now very briefly, and then show him in 1977
You have to "Benjamin Button" it
don't know what you're talking about, okay
All rock stars are older now
Steven Tyler, David Bowie, Mick Jagger-- Paul McCartney
Okay, stop it
Everybody you're mentioning looks like an old woman now
You're just mentioning a bunch of Jessica Tandys
Keith Richards gets away with it
But that's because Keith Richards looked seventy when he was forty, and now that he's seventy, he looks sixty- nine
He's regenerating
like it
And  think Graham Parker is sexy
Would you fuck him
Yes
You'd fuck him, and you won't fuck me
mean,  kind of fucked you once, if you could have finished
Oh,  finished
You know what, enough of who fucked who and who finished what
26
finished
Look
It's a retro label
That's our niche
That's our market
It costs money to break new bands, can't do that
Oh, okay
And also you're the guy who turned down Arcade Fire
Everyone turned down Arcade Fire
It's crazy, there are so many of them
We don't have the money to market a new band
We just need to make Graham seem relevant
Who is he talking to
Um, the Jewish Journal
The Jewish Journal
Apparently old Jews are the only ones who still buy hard copies of records
Because they don't like to download music
Because they don't know what downloading means
Angle on Graham and a journalist wearing a yarmulke
Why is this album different from any other album
It isn't
Angle on Pete, Cat and Ronnie
What is he wearing
27
It's a hat with the Oreo logo on it
Why
don't think he's being ironic, think he just really likes Oreos
Look
The Paul Westerberg record did okay
Frank Black did all right
The Haircut 100, not so much
We have to break this record
Otherwise, we're not here next year
He's coming
Oreo man is coming
Graham walks up
Hey guys, how are you
Aren't cookies the best
Yeah
Jewish Journal guy loves the record
Great
Got a bit of a problem
Touch of gout
Gout
Yeah, my whole family, they all had gout
Jesus
That's very unfortunate
28
My auntie Queenie, she had a foot like the size of a small pig
've got a photo of it
'd love to see that photo of that gout foot
couple of bunions as well
Fuck
've got to go to the podiatrist, and  hope he can shoot me up with something
Yeah, well, let's get you to the podiatrist
Bye, Graham
See you later, Graham
Good luck with your gout
Rock and Roll, baby
'   - Pete and Debbie are talking
Debbie holds a list of changes she wants to make
The happiest period in people's lives is from age forty to sixty
So this is it
We're in it, right now
Says who
Says a lot of people, most people
Huh
29
We have everything we need right now to be completely happy
We're going to blink and be ninety
What
So, let's just choose to be happy
Yeah
Your eyes are kind of glazing over
No, 'm just processing it all
Some of these  wrote for you
So, we have to exercise every day
Spend more time alone together
We have to go to the therapist every week
That's a little pricey
No stressing over tiny things
Yeah, that's good
You should do that
We have to get more involved in school
Have more patience with the kids
And we need to work on our anger
Yeah,  think it would be good if you could take care of your anger
No,  said both of us
That's what  said
Our anger
30
Okay
No more smoking
Yeah, you've got to cut that out
don't want to make this about a fight,  want to just be positive
Sorry
Okay, and then no more holding on to resentments
We have to just let that go
So, you're saying that if we're arguing and  apologize, you'll let it go and not throw it back in my face later
Well,  don't do that, but  will continue not to do that
What did you write
All of that
That's plenty
That's a lot
And you're going to eat better
Oh, yeah
've been doing a decent job, but  don't think there's anything wrong with having some fries every now and again
And then 'll smoke that day
That's not the same thing
It is the same thing
like fries
31
And the other thing is your dad stuff
Pete picks up a guitar and starts playing with it
(') The not letting him guilt trip you all the time, because that puts a lot of pressure on you, and the whole family feels it
He's a grown man, and he's not our responsibility
And you're not giving him money anymore, right
No,  haven't been giving him money for years,  told you
Can you please put that down
- Pete and Debbie are in bed
Debbie has a computer on her lap
lot of people are -ing to your birthday party
You sure you don't want to just do a joint birthday party
No
We always used to
No
We reveal that Debbie is watching security cam footage of the store
(') Did Jodi tell you she thinks Desi's stealing
Are you serious
32
Yes
How much
Twelve thousand dollars
Oh, god
And Desi's taking it
Well,  don't know
That's what Jodi said
We really need the store to work
It is
Don't put that kind of pressure on me
That's not what  mean
Are you nervous about money
Are we okay
Yeah
Maybe we just suck it up because she's clearly earning so much more than any other employee we have
Oh, yeah
For sure
We can't fire her
We're barely breaking even with her
That's why we have to keep her
We watch the footage and suddenly Desi's  enters
He walks behind the counter, and she sits on his lap
She adjusts herself
Look at this, she's making out with somebody
On the screen, they kiss
Desi seems to be popping up and down a little
33
(') Is she screwing him
That might be like a dry hump
Look at the position of her skirt
That's too grainy to know for sure
Oh my god, this is the middle of the day
Customers could be in there
At least she's getting some
What did you say
"At least she's getting some"
Yes
What are you talking about
We had sex the other night
You have to give me a little credit for that
It's not about credit
We need to have more passion
Like this
That's not passion
It looks like passion to me
What-- Pete farts
(') What is she doing
He farts again
It is longer
Oh my god
Don't do that
Debbie hits Pete with a pillow
34
What am  doing
Don't fart in the bed
'm not, it's the springs
This is why we never have sex
That's disgusting
You're gross
don't know what you're talking about
Pete farts again
'  - Charlotte jumps around in front of Sadie's door
Sadie sits on her bed quietly doing homework
(singing) Sadie
Sadie, Sadie
Sadie, Sadie
Charlotte
'm doing my homework
Okay, watch this
There's a haunted cow back here, and 'm pretty sure it does not have milk
Charlotte grabs her own head and makes it look like she's being dragged away
(') Did you see that
They took me away
Sadie does not even look up
(') You're no fun
You never want to play
Charlotte
How many times do  have to tell you-- 35
(singing) Sadie
Sadie, Sadie
Is boring
Charlotte plays air guitar
Sadie does not respond
(') You're so mean since your body got weird
Close the door
- Debbie and Pete begin their "fresh start
" Debbie tosses her cigarettes in the garbage cans outside
Pete tosses a packet of &'s in the garbage
He throws out all of his cupcakes except for one
He takes a bite, tries to throw it but again, can't
He takes another bite, holds it over the garbage, then takes one last bite before dumping what little remains
'  - Pete runs on a treadmill while getting an electrocardiogram
'  - Debbie is getting a mammogram
The machine clamps too hard on her breast
She screams
' - Pete gets his testicles examined
Did  tell you that my son is going to Stanford
No, that's great
Great for us and great for him
Cough again
Everything looks good
Your face is close to my face
36
'  - Debbie is getting a colonoscopy
Descending colon
'm about four feet in right now
(laughing) That's what he said
- Debbie has some sort of very painful oral surgery
She's a little high from the laughing gas
Do you grind your teeth
grind all night
think we need to turn the gas down
Turn it up
No, we're going to turn it down
Turn it up
'  - Dr
Bowe has his finger inside of Pete's anus, giving him a prostate exam
Do you have to breathe right on my neck
Sorry
37
Debbie is at the Gynecologist
He is the same one from the beginning of Knocked Up,
Debbie's legs are up in stirrups
What are you all doing for Christmas
don't know
Do you have a tree and everything
Yes
Isn't that fun
Get in the spirit-- Two nurses enter the exam room
#1 Hi, sorry  just have one quick question
On your form you said you were born in 1974, but your paper said 1972
just need to know which it is
Oh
It's 1974
#2 Because on your last form you said that you were born in 1975
Didn't you tell me you were born in 1976
No
That's funny
#2 So you want to go with 1974
'm not going to "go" with 1974, it is 1974
38
#2 Okay
Just remember to write 1974 every time
It's okay
It's 1976
lie about my age, okay
Okay
Okay
Okay
Okay
You're tightening up
Oh my gosh
know how old you are
By counting the rings
Little gyno joke
- Debbie comes in the bedroom
What are you doing
Getting ready to go for my ride
You want a blow job
Yeah
Why
really want a cigarette right now
Well, happy to help
- Sadie runs down the hallway
39
Charlotte, where is my backpack
- Charlotte tries to open the door, it's locked
- Debbie is giving Pete a blow job out of frame
Pete is sitting on a chair, super happy
(
) Hello
Mom's busy
(
) Why are you locking the door
Mom
- What's going on in there
Mom,  can't be late for school, have a test
(
) Mommy can't talk right now
- (
) This isn't funny, Mom
need to go
(
) Mom, let me in
- That's not going to help
Charlotte shoves Sadie
40
(
) Put on your shoes
We'll meet you in the car
The fight between Sadie and Charlotte escalates and becomes physical
- (
) Sadie hurt me
(
) didn't
Hit her back
(
) She's faking
- (crying) 'm not
(
) Go downstairs
- (shouting to kids) Stop crying
(to kids) Stop crying
Stop it
God damn it
41
- (banging on the door) Open the door
Open it
- Muffled screams from the girls outside
Forget it
No
Don't forget it
Don't forget it
Don't
Oh, god
'  -   - Pete walks to the front door
His father, , greets him
Hey, Boychik
low flying 747 lets us know he lives too close to the airport in a small house
(') That's the eleven o'clock from London
(yells up at the plane) Drop something valuable, you shit
(back to Pete) How are you
That's loud
Every eight minutes, buddy
'  - Pete sits down and talks with Larry
You look pretty good
Your hair is different
Yeah, 'm growing it out
42
'd get it cut
#1 Daddy, you never play with me
do but right now look who 'm talking to
It's your brother
#1 You don't look like my brother
told you honey, that's because of the egg donor
Remember
#1 came from a test tube
How's business
It's not good
Nobody wants curtains
They think of it like a luxury
It's not a luxury
You need shade, you need privacy
Who wants to have other people watch you fuck
know how you feel
You know my business is going through some growing pains right now
Two other identical children enter and jump on Larry
#2 Daddy come play with us
The kids crawl around on him
Be careful, don't jump on Daddy
Remember, Daddy has high blood what
Blood pressure
That's right
Can you go outside without me for a little bit
() 43
(') All right
Do the Three Stooges routine you were practicing
The three exit
(') can't tell them apart
swear to god
need tattoos
Look,  wanted to talk to you about scaling back a little bit
You know, Deb and  are thinking about selling the house
think that house is more than you need
think it was too big of a purchase when you made it
Yeah
In the meantime, 'm going to have to make some changes
Going to have to cut back
What do you mean
With you
Oh
'm sorry, what
can't lend you any more money
No, that's a bad idea
That's not the way to cut back
have three children, here
What about Claire
Why can't she get a job
Claire takes care of your brothers
What do you want her to do
If she goes to work, then 've got to hire somebody
44
Well you've got to figure something out because  can't do it
Okay, fine
Why don't we kill them
Come on, we'll kill two of them
'll keep the best one
Really, it will save us both a lot of trouble
Larry stands up and walks outside
Pete follows
'  - Larry prepares to spray the kids with the hose
Line up
Line up for murder
Come on
Who wants to be killed
#1 do
Okay, we're eliminating one, we're cheaper already
Larry sprays him with the hose
#2 Murder me
Boom, dead
You're dead
#2 'm dead
All right, the kids are murdered
That will save us some money
Why would you have three kids, anyway
mean, you're sixty years old
You have no money
Because Claire wanted a baby
If we didn't at least try, she would have left me
She was forty-five years old
Nobody thought it would take
() 45
(') The doctor when we were doing in vitro was winking at me like, "Don't worry, don't worry
" We were very unlucky
And now we have these three beautiful children
Come on, 've got to tell you something
'  - What
Your mother wanted you aborted
Oh, Jesus Christ
It's the truth
It was the seventies
We were twenty-two years old
That's what everybody did
You did some blow, had sex, had an abortion
Really
Yes
We were on the way to the doctor's office
said, "Let's stop, have a pizza, talk about it, if you still want to do it after lunch, it's okay
" The pizza saved your life
But don't give me money
Because 'm not worth it
So how much do  owe you for saving my life
don't have a number
You just keep giving like you're giving
Larry's wife, , enters
Oh, hi Pete
(to Larry) Why aren't you playing with kids
46
We were playing with them all day
Pete's just talking to me about his fortieth birthday party
Whatever can do to help
Okay
Did you feed them
fed half of one
Okay, let's feed them
Who wants tuna with a side of jet fuel
Larry gets up and walks outside
- nervous Debbie approaches a hostess
Hi, 'm looking for my dad, an older man
Debbie sees  (65) sitting stiffly at a table
- So how's Sony treating Pete
Oh, he's not with Sony anymore
He went out on his own
Now he's able to focus on the artists that he's really passionate about
How's Sadie doing
Last time  saw her she was throwing her Cheerios on the floor
What a mess
She just got her period
Well
guess she's not a little baby anymore
It would be nice to see more of each other
47
Well, we can certainly arrange for that
'd love to see the girls
That would be nice
Do you have a good day
would say the weekends, but our weekends are hell
Soccer competitions, kids exams
mean, we're both so busy
have young children, you have young children
don't think we should judge ourselves too harshly about that
know,  wasn't
'm glad we're here
think this is a good start and that if we can spend more time together, it would be nice
It would be nice
(pause) Do you want to see pictures of the kids
Oliver takes out his iPhone and starts showing Debbie photos
(') This is Kell, my son
He's handsome
He's thirteen
Yeah
And that's Alexandra, my daughter, she's a real perfectionist
lot like you
That's the whole gang at Cabo
(pause) Will you excuse me, dear
've got to use the restroom
Be right back
He exits
Debbie picks up his iPhone and sadly scrolls through all the happy pictures of his new family
- The family's hanging out, relaxing at dinner
48
Daddy and  are making some changes so that we can be happier and healthier, and we're starting with this meal that  prepared
think it looks great
Doesn't it look good
What is that, grilled cheeses
No, baked tofu
It's actually really tasty
And the lettuce is so fresh and tasty that you forget how good lettuce tastes on its own without dressing
Yeah, dressing always gets in the way of the natural taste of the lettuce
And another thing we've decided is to cut back on all of the electronics we use
What we're going to do is get rid of the wi-fi and only use the computer from eight to eight-thirty at night
How are we going to go on the computer
We're going to have a hard line in the kitchen
Yeah, we'll supervise that
You can't do this
You can't take away the wi-fi
Charlotte holds her iPhone to her face using an app that animates her mouth to look like a talking monkey's
49
(from behind her iPhone) No wi-fi
Ha-ha-ha
You don't spend enough time with the family when you're constantly on your iPhone and your computer
You're only here five more years
So you won't see me after five years
No, but you won't be living with us
And you should get to know your little sister
You've got the perfect friend right here
don't want to be friends with her now
'll be friends with her when she's twenty and a normal person
don't want to hang out with her when 'm in my twenties
You're on your computer too much as it is
You need to get outside more
Yeah
You can build things
You can build a fort
What
Yeah, build a fort
Play with your friends
Make a fort
Outside
And do what in the fort
50
When  was a kid we used to build tree houses and play with sticks
Nobody plays with sticks
You and Charlotte can have a lemonade stand
Play Kick the Can
Look for dead bodies
It's fun
Get a tire and then take a stick and run down the street with it
Nobody does that crap
It's 2012
You don't need technology
Charlotte holds the iPhone monkey app to her lips again
No technology
Charlotte, put that down
don't need to be monitored all the time on the computer
don't do anything bad
Nobody said you were bad
don't do things 'm not supposed to
don't illegally download music
don't look at porn like Wendy
51
She is up to no good
She's not allowed to come over here anymore
What's porn
No, she said "corn
" This isn't turning out the way wanted it to
'm not hungry
Sadie gets up and stomps off
No computer
Listen to your mom
need to use it for my homework
She walks off
She's outplaying us
know
She's tough
'  - Pete and Debbie drive down the Pacific Coast Highway
This is the best birthday present
It's good to get away, you know
We haven't been to Laguna without the kids in years
'  - know
52
If we're happy, they're happy
mean  can't take it
With the hormones, and the crying, and "do my homework"
Them's little bitches
Them's lil' bitches
Bugging us for shit all the time
And they never appreciate anything
God no
They're selfish assholes
(laughs) Aw,  feel bad
love them
know
- The car pulls up to a beautiful hotel in Laguna
miss them already
Should we go home
Nah
- Pete and Debbie hold hands as they walk the hotel grounds
They enter their room, which has a beautiful ocean view
Debbie jumps on the bed
Pete jumps on top to kiss her
Pete and Debbie jump into the hotel pool together
Pete holds Debbie in the water
They kiss
- Pete and Debbie are in bed in their underwear
53
Why do we fight
don't know, it makes no sense at all
It makes no sense
When we get in a fight, look in my eyes
Let's remember this moment right now and know that we never have to fight
But you're such a dick sometimes
know,  am a dick sometimes
People think 'm so nice, but 'm such a dick
Thank you for admitting that
And you get so mad at me
feel like you want to kill me
do want to kill you
How would you do it
don't know
poison you
'd poison your cupcakes that you pretend not to eat everyday
And just put enough in to slowly weaken you
love it
would enjoy our last few months together
Me too
54
Because you'd be so weak and sweet, and  could take care of you but while killing you
See
You know what  love about us
You can still surprise me figured for sure you'd knock me out with one fell swoop
But you would extend it over a series of months
Have you ever thought about killing me
Oh, yeah
Really
Sure
How would you do it
Wood chipper
wood chipper
Did you see Fargo
Yeah
Pete makes a wood chipping splatter noise
(') Wow
That's a bad plan
The cupcakes is a way better plan
It is
You know what
won't murder you
Aw
love you
55
love you too
Hey
You know what  brought
What
medical marijuana cookie
Ben gave it to me last Christmas
What
Chocolate chip koo-kie
Should we do it
Let's eat the cookie, and then we'll order a bunch of cheeseburgers
Let's order the entire room service menu
Just get all of it
You deserve it
You really do
Wouldn't you rather have me around for less years and 'm incredibly happy than longer and miserable
Yes, and  just realized that right now
Go get the cookie
Pete runs into the bathroom
He looks for the cookie
(') Should we watch porn when we eat the cookie
Should we get a block of porn
don't think we need twenty-four hours of porn
56
Yeah, but you know, two porns cost about as much as a block
think that's too much porn
We don't have to watch it all, but for the value it makes sense
- Pete and Debbie eat the cookie
How much are we supposed to eat
don't know
think like six or seven cookies, right
Plus, it's old
It probably has lost some of its- Potency
They sit in silence for an incredibly long amount of time, staring through each other in a haze
They are stoned
We should have sex
More
mean, girls have it so easy
You just show up with your sexual organs and you're good to go
All the pressure is on the guy
It's true
And  look at guys, like  look at a guy like Prince, and you know that guy fucks
know  don't fuck like Prince
Prince can fuck fuck more like David Schwimmer
You do
57
fuck like Ross from Friends
They're laughing and having a good time
- Stoned, Pete and Debbie jump up and down on the bed
They fall down on the bed, kissing
Almost totally under the covers, they watch as a brings in a room service cart full of food
Pete does magic tricks for the waiter
How does he do it
The floating spoon
Debbie hands Pete a banana and two oranges, which he holds to his crotch in front of the waiter
(') Check it out
My dick and balls
'm going to eat my own dick
Pete eats a bite of the banana
(') ate my dick
Debbie crawls on the floor while Pete lays in bed
(') think this room has rodents just saw it
Pete stands with a starfish sticking out of his underwear
(') Have you seen my starfish
Where did  put my starfish
58
They eat room service
Chips and desserts and everything
'm going to deep throat this eclair
She tries to deep throat it
Pete loves it
want to make out with you so bad
/
- Pete and Debbie drive back from Laguna
They could not look happier or more refreshed
They hold hands and smile at each other
It is a beautiful day
They pull up to their house, shut off the car and sit for a beat, knowing they're about to head back into the stress of the real world, not wanting their peaceful, loving time to end
That was nice
That was nice
Sadie walks outside
Jodi follows her
Mom
Charlotte's crying
She's got an ear infection again
didn't know what to do
(to Debbie) We're home
'  - Charlotte is crying really hard
Are you okay
What's the matter
just want to rip my ear off, it hurts so much
59
(to Pete) told you the pediatrician didn't know what he was talking about
Oh, come on
You can't blame it on our doctor
Ear infections are common in little kids
Not in kids over six years old
We're going to the Eastern doctor
If she's in this much pain, we should call a real doctor
Are you kidding right now
Okay
- Charlotte sits on the table
Pete and Debbie are talking to , a foreign doctor
What we should do is easy and simple
No more dairy, no more wheat, no more sugar
Sugar, wheat and dairy
Okay
(mutters) What the fuck is left
Sorry
Isn't everything sugar, wheat and dairy
She can have vegetables and f-r-ruits
Dr
Seduku has both an accent and a lisp
Oh, she can eat fr-r-ruits
Fr-r-ruits, yes
60
Any kind of fr-r-ruits
Mangos, pineapple
It isn't like there are safe fr-r- ruits and then unsafe fr-r-ruits
No, no
What about -r-r-rench f-r-r-ries
Can we do something like that
Are you okay
Would you like to come on the table
'm okay
Why don't you go on the table
No
Why don't you go on the table
It looks like you need to get on the table
don't want to get on the table
- Pete cycles with the crew
-  - Debbie looks around the house for Pete
Pete
61
- Debbie sees Pete on the bed, his legs up in the air
He still has his bike top on but is naked from the waist down
He is trying to look at his back end
He is holding a mirror and an iPhone
What are you doing
need you to look at something
In my butt
Why
think 've got something in there, and 'm not limber enough to see
need you to look at it might have like an anal fissure or a hemorrhoid or a worm or something
What are you doing with your phone
Trying to take pictures of it, so can compare it to something on Google
Can we just keep like a small shred of mystery in our relationship
Look,  saw you have two babies, okay
Seriously,  need you to get all up in that
do not want to investigate your anus
It's payback time
Pete has his naked legs hiked up over his head
Debbie takes a very quick glance inside
62
It's a hemorrhoid
Thank you
Now erase that from your memory
'  - Debbie talks to Jodi while they fold clothes and watch Desi
Where did she get those clothes
Those are expensive
Where do you think
don't want this to sound harsh, but everything that comes out of her mouth is a lie
Everything that comes into it is a dick
Everything that goes in is dicks
dick
Don't say that
'm sorry, 'm just being protective of the store
'm going to go talk to her
Debbie walks over to Desi
(') Hey Desi
Is that your new Acura out front
Uh, yeah
It's so nice
Do you love it
Well,  mean, it's not a fucking Porsche, but it'll do for now
63
Hey Desi, would you mind wearing some of the clothes we have in the store
Yeah, sure
'm sorry
Desi picks a shirt
(') Good
Desi begins to take all her clothes off in front of Debbie
(') You know,  actually made this one myself
Did you
Yeah
did the tiger on a piece of paper separately, and then transferred it to the t-shirt
Wow
So you stenciled on the tiger
drew it on a piece of paper, and then  transferred the drawing to the t-shirt
You have an amazing body
Really
Yes
Are those real
My boobs
Yeah
Do you want to touch them
Really
Touch `em
64
Okay
Debbie squeezes Desi's breasts
(') Wow
Jesus
mean they really are amazing
That's firm, for real
They're like a memory mattress
Like Tempurpedic, you know
They look amazing
My kids just sucked the meat right out of mine
No
There's some meat in there
Since  had kids, my boobs are just gone
They didn't even say goodbye
They just left
By the time 'm forty, these are going to go National Geographic on me
feel bad about myself right now
- Pete talks is in his office on the phone with his
(
) think this is a really good offer on the house
We expected more
mean,  know it's a bad market but that's still way under what we were looking for
(
) know, but based on the market, it's like you're gaining money
Because it's so much more than what you deserve
But these people are from Iran and they don't really know that they're offering too much
Is there any chance that Debbie will go for it
65
doubt it
don't know
(
) There's a lot of inventory out there
What's her problem
She has unrealistic expectations
- Sadie and her friend  run around the yard with Charlotte and the triplets
- Larry and Debbie greet the kids when they enter the kitchen
Larry picks up one of the triplets
Did you miss me Travis
#1 It's Jack
Hey, Jack
#1 My daddy doesn't know my name
Can  go show them my crystals before they leave
Yeah, really quick
Charlotte leaves with the triplets
Go play with your tiny uncles
(to Debbie) So, what are you doing, spring cleaning
'm getting rid of everything in the house that has gluten or sugar
66
Why
What's wrong with gluten
Gluten's really bad for you
don't think so
It's wheat
Don't you watch Dr
Oz
As in the Wizard of
Hey, Mom
We were wondering if we could use the computer to iChat
Remember the rules
Eight to eight- thirty
Yeah, but  have a friend over
Hi Wendy
Why don't you guys go play
You could go build a fort
Remember the Alamo
Have you ever built a fort, Wendy
Like on Facebook
will take this if you're going to throw it away, because at our house, we're wheat eaters
But don't you want to live long enough to see your kids grow up
That's up to god, honey
But that's really not good for the kids
67
The kids eat grass
This is fine
Larry takes some of the food she's throwing out
Wendy's mom lets her go on whenever she wants
My mom's pretty cool about it as long as  finish my homework
Yeah
Well,  guess 'm not the cool one
But the rules are just different in our house
But  get better grades than Wendy
She does
She's so smart
Let me just grab the candy worms
Your rules are ridiculous
Don't sass me
'm only sassing you because you're throwing out all the food in our house and 'm freaking starving
You're being stupid
Wendy, can you go stand in the other room, please
Yeah
Wendy exits
(whispers) Mom
Give me your iPhone now
68
The nougat things are good
have all my contacts in there
Okay, if you don't give me your phone right now, then 'm going to have to take away your phone and your computer
Jesus Christ-- That's it
need my computer to do homework
No phone, no computer
This is
This is a bunch of - ing
You're acting like a
Kids
Time to go
You go to your room right now
Sadie runs off
(') (calling after her) You are not allowed to use iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, iTunes, Netflix, Pandora, or Spotify
Pete enters from the hallway
He sees Larry and turns around before anyone notices him
She's a little pip
Just like her mommy
So  might have a job tomorrow, at least 'm going to go try to give an estimate
Do you mind taking the kids for a couple hours
69
(conflicted) Okay
This is nice
You and  don't spend enough time together, do we
We spend enough time together
We do
It's quality time
Then we do
'll go with what you think
- Pete and Debbie are in bed
Pete is reading Sadie's iChats on her confiscated iPad out loud to Debbie
What else did they say
Some kid named Joseph-- know Joseph
You do
He's making a "Hot or Not" list
What
So, Sadie said, "That's so   lame and immature that you're doing   that
" And then Joseph says, "Yo,   girl
We're just having some fun   so don't be a bitch, yo
" That is not nice
70
So, then Sadie said, "Don't call me a bitch
" And Joseph said, " didn't call you a bitch,  said don't act like a bitch
And by the way you're in the `Not Hot' column
" Who made him the judge of hot
Do you realize what that could do to her self-esteem
What a little fuckhead
'll kill him
So then Sadie said, "You're in the jackass column
've got to go
'm bored of you
" That is cool
That's taking the high road
For some reason, there's an emoticon of a panda doing push-ups
wonder what that means
don't think it means anything, think it's just adorable
Aww
She's a good girl
She was polite, and she stood up for herself
That's pretty cool
They hear a door slam
Debbie gasps
(') What
Shit
thought she was coming in
71
Oh my god, that scared me to death
If she caught us, she would kill us
Debbie starts looking through the iPad
Pete's iPhone chimes
He sees a message from Ronnie from work
It reads: "Got the numbers
Call me
" Pete looks ashen
He looks over at Debbie who is oblivious
've got to make a call
- Pete paces
(whispering loudly) We sold how many
(
) Six hundred and twelve album downloads
Wait a minute
There are no zeros after that
(
) There are zeros, but all of them are before six hundred and twelve
There are none after
How is that even possible
(
) Out of three hundred million Americans, six hundred and twelve people chose to download the album
You could personally call everyone who bought this record
We're fucked
Here's the deal want you to meet me tomorrow morning at eight o'clock
want a list of at least thirty ideas of what we can do to change this
() 72
(') We have to change this
started a record label because  couldn't get a job, so  have no other options
- Pete is driving
Sadie and Charlotte sing show tunes loudly and happily
Pete is very upset about the record not selling
'  - Debbie is talking to their
What financial problems
Well, for one thing, you were right, you are missing about ten thousand dollars from the store
And then, Pete's record not selling well
thought we weren't supposed to hear for three weeks
We heard
You heard
And they're bad
You know, it's that, and it's the money that he's been lending to his father, that's creating a strain
How much have we lent him
Eighty thousand
Did you say "eight thousand" or "eighty thousand"
73
Eighty thousand, over the past couple of years
And then you missed the mortgage payment-- On the house
And you missed the rental on the office
Does Pete know that
Oh, yeah
We're on the phone all the time
Look,  know you're going through a hard time, and  want you guys to know that we're here for you, okay
Anything you guys need, that's why we're here
We're here for times like this
What are you going to do
There's not much  can do
- Pete enters and walks into Ronnie's office
Ronnie is drawing on a blackboard behind his desk
What are you doing
'm drawing the album cover for Van Halen's Diver Down
If you spent a little bit more time focusing on Graham Parker instead of drawing album covers,  wouldn't be in this predicament
'm focused on Graham Parker
You're supposed to help me with him
() 74
(') You're supposed to call the companies, you're supposed to get people to the show
've done everything  can, Pete
You had me pushing around a corpse
It was like being in fucking Weekend at Graham's
What should we do
'm out of ideas
You fly in The Rumour
can't sell a reunion concert without the band
It's ridiculous
With what
can't afford it
You put this on yourself
You wanted the responsibility, take it on the chin, and stop acting like a bitch
What did you call me
Chin
Pete walks out of Ronnie's office and into the main office space
Ronnie follows
(') Pete -- wait
have an apartment, have health insurance,  have car payments
have responsibilities
Don't talk to me about responsibilities
have a life have a family
can't afford to sit in my apartment getting high, jerking off, and then going to Tommy's Chili Burgers at three in the morning
That's not even the order that happens in
75
have everything to lose here
Everything
Yes
Because you spent thousands of dollars on shit we don't need
You really need to spend thirty thousand dollars on a fucking neon sign, dude
Which is inside
It's not even outside
We know where we work
If you want to sign a band, you have to look like you're the real deal
(to Cat) Princess Labia, how much is it to fly The Rumour in
It's twelve thousand
Twelve thousand dollars
You know what
Fine
Fly in The Rumour
Put it on my AmEx
'  - Debbie sits in Dr
Pelligrino's office
No, you said it was impossible
don't think  said it was impossible
Yeah
usually don't say impossible like to leave some wiggle room
76
You said that my fibroid was like a giant boulder, like the one from the Indiana Jones movies blocking up my uterus
And  need to stop using that reference of Indiana Jones
think that's not appropriate when talking about the reproductive system
It's okay
Anyway, somehow the Eastern medicine has worked and the fibroid has dissipated
That's great
Yes
Your fibroid shrunk, and somehow it allowed you to get pregnant
What
You're going to have your third baby
Congratulations
No
Yes
Debbie does not react
(') Would you like some water
That's good news
Another baby, at forty
Debbie
77
am thrilled
And Pete is going to be so happy
So, you're okay

Pete is there with a framed drawing made by John Lennon
Hey, why are you in a bathrobe
It's the middle of the afternoon
'  - took a late shower
Why are you busting my balls
Look, 'm sorry about the record
You're going through financial shit
This is what  live with
This is a horrible time in human history
What is that
Something that might help both of our situations
Pete hands him the drawing
78
(') This is a drawing by John Lennon got it ten years ago for five thousand dollars
don't know how much it's worth now
Could be five, could be twenty
don't want this
don't even like it
'm not going to hang it up
It's not for you to hang up
It's for you to sell
That way  can give it to you and you can make some money, and Debbie doesn't know that 'm giving you anything
Well, you're not giving me money
You're giving me a project
don't know how to sell this
'm not an art dealer
Just sell it online
Do some research, make some calls
Or is that too hard to do with your high blood pressure
All right
Don't get snippy
Just because you write a great song doesn't mean you can draw
It's incredible
John Lennon drew it
think it's a Ringo
Don't beat me up if  get three hundred dollars for it
Don't take less than sixty-five hundred for that
It's very valuable
It's important to me want you to sell it so  can help you
Okay

What should  bring
You want wine or something
No
Don't buy wine with my money and give it to me at my party

And  feel bad for the kid
Can you imagine
All the other little kids, "Where's your mommy
" "Oh, she's the one sitting in that scooter eating a soft cracker
" Kids don't want to have old parents

It would be so great to not see you for like a chunk of time so that  could really just miss you
Remember when we used to miss each other

When  kissed him,  felt his little tiny teeth nubs with my tongue
You did
It was like kissing a baby
French kissing a baby
Can  ask you something stupid
Do you know why we're missing money at the store
Are you guys missing money
Like twelve thousand dollars
Wait
Do you think  took it
Well, no
did, but now  don't
It's not me
Then, why do you live in such a nice apartment and have such a fancy car
90
Yes, you're right
Look
am an escort
get paid to go out on dates
Debbie looks shocked
(') But only three to five times a year
Ten times max
But it's not technically "prostitution" because don't have to sleep with them

But  always do
That's why  only do it four to eight times a year, fifteen times max
Huh
One year  did it twenty
As long as you think it's safe

She's a pilled-out whore
Since you told me,  want to tell you something
You're pregnant

How did you know
Desi nods
(') Wow
Maybe you should tell Pete
You didn't tell Pete yet
Why not
don't know
just want him to want me
don't want him to want me because 'm pregnant
Go home and suck his dick and tell him then and he will love it
You think
He'll be so excited
Or even better yet, you should tell him while you're sucking his dick

It's lower than we expected
Then why are you giving Larry money
What
know everything
talked to the accountant
All right, you know what
don't want to get into some nasty fight
So can we please talk to each other like the therapist told us to talk to each other
Fine
It makes me feel sad when you are dishonest
understand it makes you feel bad when  am dishonest with you
() 94
(') It hurts my feelings when you treat me with contempt and corner me and try and trick me into lying
Okay
It makes me sad when it's so easy to trick you into lying because you're such a lying shitbag
You can't do that
The therapist said you're not allowed to judge me
That's not a judgment
That's just a fact
Fair enough
Sometimes  withhold truth, that is true
But it's only because 'm scared to death of your crazy-assed illogical overreactions
Well, it hurts me inside and triggers me that you're such a dishonest shit that you're lending your father money without telling me, while your record company is going bankrupt and we're on the verge of losing our fucking house

don't even know what that means
Art Garfunkel
What's wrong with Art Garfunkel
He has a beautiful voice
He's got an amazing voice
He could put a harmony to anything, but what 'm saying is that you turned me into him
What the hell are you talking about
Simon controls him
That's because Simon writes the fucking songs
He's the better one
You know what
see the way you look at our kids

He's thirteen years old for god's sake
What the hell is the matter with her
You better check her meds and get them right
Pete thinks for a moment, not sure how to handle this
Okay, why don't you back the fuck off, because that's my lovely, sweet wife you're talking about
Oh,  need to back off
Yeah, you need to back off because your kid is an animal
Why don't you put him on a leash
(to Joseph) Turn around
If he insults my daughter again, 'm going to hit him with my car
Got it
In fact, if you insult my wife again, you know what 'm going to do

Joseph was very upset when  spoke to him about this, so  thought it was important that we join together and work this through
Absolutely

We're going to work through it, but Debbie told my son that he looked like Tom Petty, in a negative way-- Who's Tom Petty
You know who Tom Petty is
And she said that if she had to come back, that she was going to " up his pussy ass
" Which is what she said
Are you serious
didn't
would never
To a child
Your son has been defiling my daughter's Facebook page now for months
These people are liars
He said that my son was an animal and that if  didn't keep him on a leash that he would hit him with his car
Did you say that
That's ridiculous
Who talks like that
You do
Debbie tries to hide a smile
He didn't say that
He said it
To me
What  said was that we need to keep an extra eye on our kids because with all the technological advances, they need to learn to use them responsibly
No
He called me an "iCunt
" 105
what
Language, Catherine
How am  going to relay what these two nutballs said to me unless say it
Can you please not talk like that, Catherine
Music Man is rehearsing next door
Sorry, fucking Music Man
Maybe if looked more like this fake bullshit couple, looks like they're in a bank commercial
That's what you look like
Like a bullshit bank commercial couple
None of this talk is productive
'd like to rear up and jackknife my legs and kick you both in the jaw with my foot bone
You're just really scaring me
This is what happens when you corner a rat
You corner me,  will chew through you
Catherine, you're better than this

You were really sweet on your iChat
We were really proud of you

You like a boy who cries
Shut up, Charlotte
You guys so desperately want me to be perfect and to make no mistakes

/
- Debbie and Pete open the front door
Standing there is Oliver
He gives a nervous smile
Debbie looks at him and tries to be nice, but we feel her effort
Hello
Hello, Debbie
She opens the door wider
They do not hug
115
Remember my husband, Pete
Oh, yes
didn't recognize you with the long hair
(people pleasing) 've been growing it
Happy birthday
He hands him a bottle
Thank you so much
Very old scotch
Oh, wow
You know,  hope it hasn't expired
No, scotch doesn't expire
It improves with age
No,  know
Thank you so much
- The party is in full swing
Pete, Debbie, Oliver, Barry and Barb are getting food from the buffet
Barb and Barry are trying to help keep the conversation going
What do you do in Chino, Oliver
am a surgeon
Wow, what kind
Mainly of the spine
My specialty is scoliosis surgery
116
My mom used to talk to me like had scoliosis because 'm a little hunchy, but that's a different thing
Well, you definitely don't look right
Larry arrives, with Claire and the triplets
Claire is holding two of them, while Larry carries one
The triplets now have very different  so he can tell them apart
One has a faux hawk, one has bangs, and one has a buzz cut
Hello everyone
'm sorry we're late
was in the lab cloning myself
We're going to have another seven more tomorrow
Look, we cut their hair different so we can finally tell who they are
Larry lifts one of the triplets up and down by the arms, simulating an elevator
(') You like the new haircut, Travis
#1 'm Jack, damn it
Of course you are
Larry puts Jack down and he runs off
Larry, this is my father
Really
How are you
Oliver
Oliver
"Can  have some more
Please, Oliver,  need a little morsel
"  love that movie
You must get that all the time
117
Not really
'm Claire, Larry's wife
Very good to see you, but excuse me, 'm going to go get the kids
Claire runs off
We won't see her now for the whole day
'd help honey, but 've got the blood pressure, and  don't want to
Dad, you want a drink
Yeah, a little white wine
White wine
Okay, heavy stuff
So, who knew that Debbie had a dad
Where have you been for fifteen years
Never seen you at Hanukkah, Christmas, Ramadan, nothing
How do you get out of all that stuff
Do you have a wife
My wife is at home
Why didn't she come
Construction
They're sanding our deck
You let the woman sand the deck
She supervises it, yes
Sadie, Charlotte and Desi walk over
Hey guys
118
Look how big the kids are
Sadie
He gives Desi a hug
Hi, Larry
(to Sadie) Hi, Sadie
Mom
Who is Oliver
What do you mean
Is he your dad
He is my biological father
What does that mean
He and my mom had a baby and that was me
Oh, so you're our grandpa
Why don't you ask your mother
Yes, well, that would make him your grandpa
Do you want him to be
Yes
Then we get another grandpa
Come on
Oliver gets up
Charlotte, Sadie and Desi run off
Oliver follows
That was deeply uncomfortable
Thank god the pretty girl was here to divert our attention
119
- Desi is gracefully swimming under water
She looks gorgeous
She sees Jason and Ronnie under water, but they look grotesque, red-faced and awkward
They both reach for each other and come to the surface
Oh, hi
did not see you there
saw you there
Did you guys come together
Are you a couple
/ No, we didn't come together
Absolutely not
Sorry, the mustache is a little-- That's fair
just assumed
This is a straight man mustache
What is the different between a gay man's mustache and a straight man's mustache
Pause
The smell
Excuse me
Desi swims away
- Larry is talking to Oliver
120
So, spinal surgery just seems to me to be at the top of the surgery chain
Well, we're not cardio, we're not neuro, but  like to think we're an important part of the spectrum
Do you operate every single day
Most days
Multiple times a day
Three, four times
So what's the price range
Like if wanted-- Oh, 'd rather not say
It's so big you're embarrassed to say
wouldn't say embarrassed
Are there hunchbacks today
Of course
've never seen one
Well, that's because there are spinal surgeons
That's because of you
Each time don't see a hunchback, you're getting that much richer
121
Oliver smiles, amused
(') You like The Beatles, don't you
Who doesn't like The Beatles
Nobody
- Jason and Ronnie are talking to Desi
So what's your sun sign
Libra
Oh, boy
That's not good
No, sir
Not for me, that's not good
Sexually we are completely incompatible
That's not true
That's such a shame
That's as bad as it gets
What's yours
'm a Cancer
Really
Is that good
122
What does it mean
That's really strange
Well, Taurus and Cancers are sort of soul mates of the Zodiac
We're like perfectly compatible
balance what you lack, and you make up for what lack
And a quiet Cancer almost always has a huge penis
(quietly) You're making me embarrassed
- Debbie, Pete, Larry, Oliver, Barb and Barry are eating
wanted to make a toast
Thank you guys so much for coming
Pete's turning forty
Weird
And we're ready to start this new phase of our lives with open hearts
Ready to just choose joy and forgive everybody, so thank you all for coming
Wait
Forgive who
think she just meant generally
You know
Put the past behind us
And live without resentments
But specifically who are you forgiving
like to know the details before  toast
Well, you and my dad and others
123
see
know you have some issues with me, but 'm curious, what's he in for
Before today nobody even knew he existed
My parents divorced when  was really young and we don't spend that much time together and 'd like to work on that
Just like we'd like to work on how you have financial issues
(to Larry) She means all the lending
And the borrowing
know what she meant
- Ronnie, Jason, and Desi talk
You are a beautiful woman, but you are not totally maxed out
would say honestly, you're a six
Six and a half
could make you an eleven
Really
When  found Deb, she was a seven
And now she's a twelve
want to be a twelve
You can't be lazy
don't want to be lazy
Look at me
You cannot be lazy
won't be lazy
124
Do you know how she got her body
Bodies By Jason
Wow
Say it
Bodies By Jason
Say it again
Bodies By Jason
And now just say Jason
Jason
Again
(whispers) Jason
That sounds right, doesn't it
Yeah
What the fuck is happening right now
- When was the last time you two saw each other, if you don't mind me asking
Actually, we had lunch together last week
125
And before that
It's been about seven years
Seven years
That's a joke, right
That's like two Olympics
And 'm the bad guy
What Debbie doesn't understand is that it's not bad to help out a parent
And it's certainly not bad for a parent to help out a child
'm sure Oliver would agree
Are you really doing this right now
Am  doing what
didn't start the toast
Are you really about to hit up my dad for money
What
He does four operations a day
It's perfect
It helps everybody, and it relieves his guilt from all the abandonment issues
You can't buy forgiveness, right Pete
don't think anyone's looking for handouts
We'd pay him back
If you two are in a bind 'd be more than happy to help
No
It's not good to borrow money from family members because it causes resentment, remember
Yeah
126
What do you want me to do
Admit that my life is shit
Is that what you want me to say
You happy
Aren't  allowed a little joy with these children  never wanted to have
You have never once stopped asking us for money
Family helps family
It's true
Family helps family
Look,  don't expect you to fully understand
Your dad left
You're broken inside
It's not your fault you can't feel love
There's something that you can't -- this is coming out wrong
You know what
would rather have my dad than your dad, because he doesn't drive me crazy
You know the best quality my father has
He asks for nothing
don't know what the fuck he's thinking right now
Look at that
Nothing
don't even know him
And  turned out perfectly fine without his input
just figured out what your problem is
You hate Jews
Which is so odd because your children are Jewish
Don't play the Jew card, Larry
'm not playing any Jew card
Seriously, it's used up
You can't use up a Jew card
That's the whole point of a Jew card
127
That's right
You can't use it up, it goes forever
You know what
have to go
Oliver gets up to leave
Great
What a big surprise
Bye Oliver
See you later
See you in another seven years
Make sure to say goodbye to the grandkids, who you met today
You know, nothing do is right because of you
Nothing
No matter how hard  try, 'm just the asshole here, but you know what  realized
It's you
You're the asshole
Good luck working that out
Happy birthday and go fuck yourself
Oliver walks out
See you when the Cubs win the Pennant
'm going to light the candles
Get it going
Maybe we should try the toast again
Can you be quiet
(to Pete) You just threw me under the bus
No
We agreed to let go and forgive, but then you started ripping into my dad like a crazy person
'm not ripping into your dad
'm just saying to him what you say to me
128
Don't be such a ball buster
am not a ball buster
You make me one
am a fun girl
am fun- loving
am a good time Sally dance hip-hop
cannot believe 've wasted my whole life busting the balls of people who have no balls
am the only one here who has any balls
- Graham Parker sings "Happy Birthday" to Pete as Charlotte accompanies him on a keyboard
The party is tense
Debbie looks over and sees that Oliver never actually left
He stands in the back looking uncomfortable, quietly singing
She's shocked he's still there
-  - Debbie smokes a cigarette at the side of the house
Sadie appears
Mom
Debbie turns, caught
(') Mom
What are you doing
What
You're smoking
In the front yard
No, they're Barb's
She walks away towards the house
Sadie follows
/
- Sadie storms through the front door after Debbie
129
Mom
Since when have you been a smoker
'm not a smoker
Debbie keeps walking down the hall
Sadie follows her
thought you said smokers die
wasn't smoking
saw you
Barb is in the kitchen with Pete and Charlotte
Mom, you're smoking
Deb, you can't smoke, you're pregnant
You've been doing so well
You're pregnant
No f-ing way
don't want another sister
don't want her as a sister
'm sorry
'm so sorry
It just slipped out
Debbie turns the corner to find Pete standing in front of the fridge, stress eating
(mouth full of cupcake) Are you really pregnant
Since when are you pregnant
Since when do you care
You don't want another baby
130
You have no idea what  want
want an Asian baby
We're not going to have an Asian baby
Yes, we are
They're not Asian
Sadie
We'll buy one
Shut up, Charlotte
You shut up
Shut up, Sadie
Shut up, Charlotte
Shut up
Okay, Sadie
Shut up
Shut up, Charlotte
Okay, stop saying shut up
Since when are you pregnant
When did you find out
Will you stop eating cupcakes, please
Stop eating cupcakes
Stop eating cupcakes
131
Debbie storms off back towards the foyer
Larry pops out from the living room, stopping Debbie in the foyer
Claire and the triplets are right behind him
Hey
We just heard
You're having a baby
See, it can happen to anybody
That is so wonderful
We're so happy for you
- Pete throws his cupcake against the wall
(to Charlotte) This is too adult for you
Let's go outside
- Larry and Claire walk away as Pete storms in
Well,  guess we're stuck together forever, then, right
Weren't we always
You don't even want a baby
Of course  do
never said that
Look,  didn't want one if  could choose
should put that on a Hallmark card
That's beautiful
Oliver passes Pete and turns to Debbie as Pete walks away
Good luck with the pregnancy, Debbie
But please, take care of yourself
It's a much riskier pregnancy after forty
132
'm not forty
Of course you are
You were born on December 5th, 1972
How do you know
was there
'm the one who took your mother to the hospital
That's not what she said
Your mom was in labor for only twenty minutes
It was like you couldn't wait to meet me, can you imagine that
Debbie is stunned
don't even know you
You can't just come into my house and reminisce
(walking out) Look, maybe we were just not meant to be in each other's lives
'm not sure this was such a great idea
Debbie follows him out the door and onto the front porch
She closes the door behind them
- Hey, wait a minute
You did leave
And you didn't come back
(getting agitated) My first life was ruined
did my best with my second
So  ruined your life
was eight
133
People do better when  stay out of their lives
That's what my son tells me
You think my life is so perfect
've got a thirteen-year- old who's a pot head, 've got a wife who's keeping Zoloft alive
You never said that before
You don't think  want to talk to you about this
To share it with you
It's just not our way
We don't talk to each other, we don't know each other
thought that's the way you wanted it
How do  get out of this
How do  get you all to just help me down off the cross
Debbie looks at him for a moment
You sound just like Sadie
Who's Sadie
No
Your daughter, your younger
The big one
Your older
know that
She's a wonderful girl
Larry opens the door and peeks out
We reveal that everyone at the party (except Pete) is still standing in the foyer
Hi, guys
Some of us need to leave
Would this be a good moment to sneak out
From the side of the house we see Pete storming by on his bike, wearing his street clothes and a helmet
Where's Dad going
134
- Pete exits his home riding his bike
He is very angry
He rides with great emotion like he is trying to get all the frustration out of his body
Best birthday ever
Pete rides his bike onto San Vicente Boulevard
Pete rides down the street
passes by him
When it does a fifteen-year-old  sticks his head out the window and yells to scare Pete
Bike lane, asshole
Pete almost falls
Fuck you, you Twilight pimply-ass motherfuckers
- Debbie and Barb are cleaning up
They look out the window to see Oliver picking up glasses and putting them in a bin
Your dad's still here
know
It's weird
Where the hell is Pete
Sadie walks in with Joseph
Mom, is it okay if Joseph hangs out here for a while
Sure
Hi, Joseph
Hi
Do you want a piece of cake
Oh, yeah sure
Thank you
135
Sadie walks off
(') All right, then
Joseph follows
They are so cute
So cute
He looks exactly like Tom Petty
- There is no bike lane and cars going very fast have to swerve to avoid Pete
car honks when traffic clogs up behind him
Go around
car makes a right turn, and Pete almost rides right into it
(') Watch it
He pulls up alongside Jason's van
Desi is riding with Jason
Hey, Pete
Great party
They speed off
Yeah
The best
- Oliver and the kids are playing with an iPhone
Then you shake it
And then a restaurant comes up
Debbie walks outside
136
Dad
Excuse me
'm going to go look for Pete
Would you mind staying with the girls for just a little bit
(shocked) Well, if you want me to
If you don't mind
You don't have to
Sure
(beat) Can  let Sadie show me the last episode of Lost
She asked me if 'd seen it,  haven't
That would be nice
Thank you
Thank you
Debbie exits
(') (to Sadie) She said we could watch it
Sadie turns to Charlotte, puts her arm around her
'm going to let you watch Lost
Come on
Charlotte smiles, delighted to be accepted by her sister
Is it scary
'll cover your eyes if it gets too scary
137
- Pete starts riding really fast and passes a car
When the car stops for a red he keeps going, tears off to the left, crosses four lanes of traffic in both directions and almost gets hit
Pete rides his bike up a steep hill
He passes some other bikers almost hitting them
'  - Debbie drives around the neighborhood with Larry in the passenger seat
Are you mad at me
Did  say something
Shh
Larry, please
- Pete flies down a steep hill going crazy fast
Close up of his front wheel shaking
It is as if he wants to crash
He rides down the street when suddenly a opens his door to exit his car and Pete slams directly into the man's car door -- hard, breaking the man's window and falling to the ground
The man is an incredibly thick fifty-five-year-old
Are you fucking kidding me
You opened your door on me
didn't open my fucking door on you
opened my door
Pete slowly gets to his feet
was right there
You are supposed to look before you open your door
was in the fucking bike path
138
That's a blind spot
There's no fucking bike path
This is a residential section
Get your head out of your ass
Pay attention
Open your god damn eyes
What are you doing, sleepwalking
You're supposed to look to see if a biker is coming through
You're supposed to look
It's not my job to look out for you
You look out for yourself don't look out for you
don't see you
don't now where the fuck you are and what you're doing
No one is ever looking out for me
need your name and number
Why
Because you're going to pay for my door
'  - They drive near the scene of Pete's accident and overhear
(
) Fuck you
- Why don't you pay for my bike -- and my face, you fucking prick
The man punches Pete in the face where he's already bleeding
139
' Debbie sees the punch and gasps, realizing it's Pete
- Pete looks stunned
He punches the man in the gut, to no effect
The man punches Pete back in the stomach
Pete sinks to the ground
Don't disrespect me
'  - Debbie watches Pete fall to the ground
She opens the car door and starts to run over toward him
Are you sure that's him
don't think that's him
- As the man starts his engine, Debbie runs toward Pete
(in pain) 'm going to write down your license plate number
The car drives away, revealing that it is new and has dealer's plates with no numbers
(') "Range Rover of Sunland
" Debbie reaches him and holds his head up
What are you doing
Ow
- Debbie and Larry sit in the waiting area of the hospital
140
guess the party didn't turn out like you planned
It wasn't a good party
walks over to them
Hi
'll bring you in as soon as his x-rays are finished
Is he okay
Yeah, he has a broken rib and he's been crying a little bit, but he'll be fine
The Nurse walks away
You know Pete was never a real fighter
But that's why he married you
That's why he loves you
Because you're the fighter, and you need that
One person in a relationship has got to punch
Do you mean that in a good way
Oh, it's a high compliment
Thanks
Listen,  know what you're worried about
You think he's going to turn into me, but  don't think it's going to happen
He's smarter and probably a little cuter
little less Jewy
Although, after fifty, that's all going to change
Be prepared to wake up one day with a a rabbi
But the good news is, he'll love you forever
That's in our
We stick around
141
He worries about you
It puts a lot of pressure on him
know
just don't have anyone else to talk to about it
You can talk to Claire
No
If  open up to her she'll leave me
No, she won't, Larry, she loves you
know, but there's a certain point at which you just can't stay
(beat) guess it's hard to forgive somebody if they don't formally apologize to you
Are you apologizing
'm very close
(beat) Yes, 'm sorry
And 'm glad everybody's okay
Thanks
She hugs him and starts to cry a little bit
'm off
Okay
This is awkward
What
142
need forty dollars for a cab
(laughing) That's funny
No, 'm not kidding
You drove me
wasn't prepared
only have a hundred
That's okay
'll bring you the change
He grabs the bill out of her purse and walks off
(') All right, give him a kiss for me
- Oliver is sitting on the couch with Charlotte and Sadie watching the last scene of Lost
Joseph has joined them
don't get it
See, it's not sad, it's happy because they helped each other achieve their destiny
Oh
Great
'm going to have some freaky ass nightmares
- Debbie walks into Pete's room, sits on the bed next to him
really liked our lives so much better before we tried to change everything
'm sorry
143
No
'm sorry
don't want to keep anything from you
love you
You're my wife
just didn't want to let you down
Are you mad that 'm pregnant
No
'm not mad
'm thrilled
You don't feel trapped
Sometimes  feel like  trapped you
don't feel trapped
Really
No
You should, because 've trapped you
You can't go anywhere
'm going to get you pregnant every ten years for the rest of your life
You can never leave me
Ever
never feel trapped by you
'm so happy to be with you
love you so much
You're my favorite person in the whole world
god damn it, why am  crying like this
Something is wrong with me
You're pregnant
Oh, yeah
Shit
was just outside telling your dad that  liked him
What if he thinks  like him now
No, he won't think that
144
don't want him to think  like him that much
It'll never happen
(suddenly giddy) Can you believe it
This is the craziest thing ever
What are we going to do with a third baby
have no idea
How are we going to afford it
We'll sell the house
We don't have to
We kind of do
We kind of do
We'll make new memories in a new house
love you
Is there anything you want to do for your birthday
It's been the worst birthday ever
There is one thing, but  don't think you'll like it
What
wouldn't mind going to see some music
Would you want to do that
Yeah
145
Really
don't believe you, but you're sweet for saying that
How do we break you out of here
can just leave on my own volition
It's not a mental institution
Can you
It's not like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
Please don't put a pillow over my face
Debbie laughs
Let's get out of here, McMurphy
You got it, Chief
Will you carry me
As Debbie helps Pete off of the hospital bed, Pete kisses her passionately
- Pete and Debbie watch Ryan Adams perform "Lucky Now" with his band
like this song
Really
Yeah
Why
Pete smiles
(') Why don't you sign him
146
Ryan Adams
No, he wouldn't sign with me
Why not
You're the best
She smiles at him and he smiles back, almost blushing
This is the smile he has been waiting for
Well, he is in between labels
Let's go try and talk to him after the show
The camera pulls back as Ryan Adams finishes his song
