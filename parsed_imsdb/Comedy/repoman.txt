Written by Alex Cox Transcript by Steve Farmer Repo Man theme music now begins playing
Map is shown in background (green text on black background), zoomed in on Los Alamos, New Mexico
While remaining credits are shown, the map travels to Sante Fe, then Albuquerque, then begins following US66 west through Arizona to California, finally ending up a few miles east of Goffs (northwest of Needles)
Green '64 Chevy Malibu Malibu is weaving down the highway in the desert, passes billboard with motorcycle cop behind it
Cop pulls out behind Malibu
Forty-niner and his daughter Clementine
Oh my darlin, oh my darlin
Motorcycle cop pulls the car over, gets off motorcycle and raps on car window
Clementine Clemen- Let me see your drivers license
Post ten-eighteen
Post ten-eighteen
From out of town, hmm
What's you got in the trunk
oah
you don't want to look in there
Give me the keys
The motorcycle cop walks around to the back of the car and opens the trunk
The car has New Mexico license plates -283
In every scene after this when the plates are visible, they will be 127-
The motorcycle cop gets disintegrated, leaving behind a pair of flaming boots (a reference to the movie Timerider, which was co-written and produced by Mike Nesmith)
Parnell watches from side mirror, where we see that the left side of his sunglasses have no lens
Oh my darlin Clementine, you are lost now gone forever, dreadful sorry Clementine
Otto and Kevin, in the supermarket, facing cans of generic yellow cling sliced peaches
Do Do Do De Do De Do De Do De Do Feeling Do De Da Do De Do De Do Feeling seven-up
'm feeling seven-up
Feeling seven up
'm feeling seven up
It's a crisp refreshing feeling crystal clear and light
America's drinking seven-up and it sure feels right
Feeling lucky seven
Otto puts price sticker on Kevin's glasses
Kevin stop singing man
Feeling seven eleven

'm standing right next to you and you're fucking (flippin) singing
Cut it out
Jeeze
Why so tense guy
Otto
Mister Humphries
You were late again this morning
Now normally 'd let it go but it's been brought to my attention that you're not paying attention to the way you space the cans
Many young men of your age in these uncertain times- Otto
Are you paying attention to me
Hey
He's talking to you
Kevin chuckles Otto grabs Kevin by the front of his shirt, steps around him, and pushes him into the stack of cans (this has been described as a goof but it's clearly just a case of awkward staging used to make the shot work)
Louie pulls his gun
(Basta
) You gotta love getting fired from your job in a big way, Otto
What are you laughing at
Louie, throw him out too
Come on you  worm
Get out of here
Louie shoves Kevin down aisle where Otto is walking out
Otto takes off his clip-on bow tie and tosses it back towards Louie
Louie twirls his gun and puts it away
Note that the store aisle is lined with nothing but generic products, plain black lettering on white background
All products in movie from now on will have this appearance
Punks slamdancing to Coup 'etat in the back of a warehouse
Otto is there slamdancing and Duke walks up, the two of them swing each other around
Behind them, the graffiti on the wall says "Circle Jerks", a band which will appear later in the movie
How you doing dude
When did you get out of the slammer man
Otto enters bedroom where Debbi is waiting in bed
What's the difference
] Huh
Otto lays back on the bed and puts his hands behind his head
okay Debbi pulls back his shirt a little and begins kissing his stomach, then stops
Otto
Otto
What
Get me another beer
Otto goes downstairs and there's a party going on
Institutionalized plays in background
Ow
Cool

Dammit

Ow
Otto returns to the bedroom Debbi honey

Otto turns on light and finds Duke there with Debbi
[ Shit
Just ignore him Duke he's nothing but a big baby
Turn the fucking light out
] Otto leaves room just as Kevin arrives and looks in the door
What are you doing
Nobody supposed to be up here
This is my parent's room
Dude, nobody supposed to be up here, this is my parent's room
) [Otto in a vacant lot drinking a beer
It's early morning and Otto starts walking
Don't want to talk about anything else
We don't want to know
We're just dedicated
to our favorite shows
Saturday night live, Monday night football, Dallas, Jeffersons, Gilligan's island, Flintstones
] Otto still walking, but it's light now
Bud pulls up next to him in a blue sedan

Lite enters Got any messages for me baby

Screw (stuff) that
Ain't going to be no repo man
No way
Otto out in the yard with Miller You find one in every car
You'll see
Back in the desert We begin scene looking through the windshield of a police motorcycle
The windshield of the police motorcycle naturally has a pine tree air freshener hanging from it
We see some people searching around in the desert, most of them in radiation suits, with a local sheriff following a woman in a business suit
Come in Officer Labeef do you read me
Chuck will you stop fooling around
've never seen the like of that

Ten-forty Baker What could have done that to him
Gasoline
Napalm
It happens sometimes

Suspect presence on west coast confirmed 44% possibility Los Angeles Locate immediately Do not notify police Suspect presence on west coast confirmed
Do not notify police
Otto and Kevin on a porch in the rain Night watchman in Pomona
Yep
Asbestos worker
City of industry
Yep Yep
French fry maker Agoura
Ha Ha that's absurd
Yeah
Well you think it's funny huh
There's fucking (lots of) room to move as a fry cook, man
You know  could be manager in two years
King
God
(egad
) You know Kevin,  had this wild fucking (flippin) dream the other night
bet
It was with you and me and we were working in this sleazy shithole (shabby) motel down in Miami, Florida
And we were bellhops and we were sixty-five years old
It was so real it was really real, realistic
And then what, you woke up in a puddle (cold sweat)
Fuck you
(drop dead) Fucking (you) jerk
Otto stands up and starts to walk away
Where you going asshole (snotnose)
Away from you
Otto gets off the Edge City #127 bus and comes home
Mom and Dad are watching Edge City, also the name of the film's production company, is a recurring theme in Tom Wolfe's "Electric Kool-Ade Acid Test"
Mother, father
Got anything to eat
Occasionally we get a letter from a viewer that says now the only reason Reverend Larry comes on your television set is because he wants your money
And do you know what
They're right
do want your money
Because god wants your money
So  want you to go out and mortgage that home and sell that car and send me your money
You don't need that car
(continues in background) Put it on a plate son you'll enjoy it more
couldn't enjoy it any more mom This is swell
Dad
Hey Dad
What is it son
Do you remember that you once told me along time ago
Well not too long ago but ummm
That you told me that you'd give me a thousand dollars to go to Europe if  finish school
Well you know something
You were right
About finishing school that's ah that's what 'd like to do
But umm  want to know if  could have the money first
Like now
[You know  really love you Dad 've always loved you
You too mom
What do you say
don't have it anymore
What
] You father gave all our extra money to the Reverend's telethon, Otto
Well what about me
You're on the honor roll of the chariots of fire
Same as us, Otto
It was a gift
From all of us jointly
We're sending bibles to El Salvador
Otto and Bud riding in Bud's car Jazz music plays on the radio
In almost all scenes inside of Bud's car, Jazz music will be playing on the radio
In this sequence the background changes from day to night, back to day, and back to night again (during the speed snorting scene) even though the dialog seems continuous
believe that this was done intentionally to show the passage of time, but the disjointed events are cut so smoothly as to make it seem like they goofed the continuity
It's clearer in the  version where there truly is a break between the line about speed and the actual snorting
So how much do  get paid, twenty-five buck a car
Paid
You don't get paid
Are you kidding, you work on commission, that's better than getting paid
Most cars you rip are worth two or three hundred dollars
Fifty thousand dollar Porsche (german pronounciation) might make ya five grand
It helps if you dress like a detective, too
Detectives dress kind of square
People think this guy is a cop
They're going to think you're packing something
They don't fuck (mess) with you so much
Are you
Am  what
Packin' something
Ha
Only an asshole (a jackass) gets killed for a car
Guys who make it are the guys who get into their cars at anytime
Get in at three
get up at four
That's why there ain't a repo man  know that don't take speed
Speed huh
Bud at payphone Bud is talking on phone
'll call you back
(hangs up) Flippin general telephone
Bud picks up phone and dials
Phone begins making a loud whining noise
Bud gets sledgehammer from car and destroys phone while Otto watches
When Bud is done, Otto gets crowbar from car and beats side of phone with it while laughing
'mon
Otto and Bud in car in alley (In the television version, this entire scene takes place while watching Bud's car drive down a road, but you can still hear the snorting in the background
) [ Jesus Christ
] Never broke into a car
Never hot-wired a car
Kid
never broke into a trunk
shall not cause harm to any vehicle nor the personal contents thereof
Nor through inaction let that vehicle or the personal contents thereof come to harm
That's what  call the repo code kid
Don't forget it etch it in your brain
Not many people got a code to live by anymore
Hey
Hey look at that
Look at those assholes (that) over there
We see a group of people around a tow truck with a car being hooked up to it
Ordinary  people  hate 'em
Me too
What do you know
See an ordinary person spend his life avoiding tense situations
Repoman spends his life getting into tense situations
Lets go get a drink
Otto and Bud in a store Bud sets 2 six packs of "drink" down on the counter
Tense situations kid
Get into five or six of them a day and it don't mean shit (zilch) anymore
mean  seen men stabbed and it didn't mean shit (zilch)
've seen guns
Guns too they don't mean shit (zilch) but that's when you got to watch your self
Here 'll handle it pal
Uh settle down
Have a nice day
Or night
Night, day, it doesn't mean shit (zilch)
Duke, Archie, and Debbi rise from behind counter as Otto and Bud leave
Wasn't that Otto
Otto who
You gotta watch yourself
(takes off mask) Have a nice day
night
Parnell drives Malibu across bridge Otto and Bud in front of house with tow truck This is what  call phase 2 ace
If the dealer don't have the keys, you call the truck
And it is a heartbreak to be sitting waiting for the truck and the giblet comes out and drives it away
Once you've got this baby on the hooks, she's all ours
Man comes out of house with shaving cream on face
Oh no you don't
'm nipping this in the bud right now
You are not going to take this car
know my rights
There is absolutely no way you're going to take it
Uh, are you miss Luann Pakman
Obviously not
'm Arthur Pakman
Luann is my daughter
Now you're going to have to take this matter up with her
Well don't think  haven't tried, sir, but she hasn't had the decency to call us in months
mean, 've skipped trace this car all over town
Well, uh, Luann is sick
Now the damn car isn't working anyway, and  know, know that's why she hasn't paid you
Well, she could have called us
Look, all you've go to do is call my branch manager,  will abide with whatever he says
Bud hands Pakman a business card
Farben
What do you take me for, a moron
If  go in there, you're going to take this car away
What, and lose my job
The law requires that  stay right here until you call my branch manager
That's the law
That's the law
Pakman begins walking toward house
'll be right back
Pakman goes inside and Bud and Otto leave with the car as Pakman comes running back out of the house
Otto and Bud driving down a waterway There's going to be some bad shit (stuff) coming down one of these days kid
Oh yeah

On the moon
Ung Uh, 'm going to be right here heading north at a hundred and ten per

Awful quiet in here
It's too quiet
So who are these Rodriguez boys
Rodriguez brothers
Lagarto and Napoleon
Two notorious delinquents currently responsible for at least thirty vehicles in the field
Quick shot of Rodriguez brothers in car lot signing papers on a car
Although not made entirely clear in the movie, Lagarto and Napoleon apparently will buy an inexpensive car and pay for it in order to establish a good credit rating
Then they go out and buy nice cars and never make payments on them
Lite and Otto in Lite's car Scumbags They ain't scumbags

In addition 'd like them to be as close to the window as possible so  can sit in my car and watch my things

Peason Sees Otto driving off with the car

Otto goes through glove compartment, puts on pair of sunglasses he finds there (reference to the movie Kings of the Road with cinematography by Robby Mueller)
Lite puts a lighter to the cigarette in his mouth, but fails to light it
few moments later he does it again and succeeds in getting it lit
Do you like music
Sure
In that case you're going love this
Lite puts cassette in player
Lite's Theme starts playing

Otto continues throwing boxes out of the window
You read that book  gave you

Dioretix
Science of matter over mind
Unh uhg You'd better read it and quick
That book will change your life
Found it in a Maseratti in Beverly hills
Otto and Miller in vacant lot under bridge lot of people don't realize what's really going on
They view life as a bunch of unconnected incidences and things
They don't realize that there's this like lattice of coincidence that lays on top of everything
'll Give you an example, show you what  mean
Suppose you thinking about a plate of shrimp
Suddenly somebody will say like plate or shrimp or plate of shrimp out of the blue no explanation
No point in looking for one either
It's all part of a cosmic unconsciousness
You eat a lot of acid Miller, back in the hippie days
'll give you another instance
You know the way everybody's into weirdness right now
Books in all the supermarkets about Bermuda triangles, 's, how the Mayans invented television
That kind of thing
don't read them books
Well the way  see it it's exactly the same
There ain't no difference between a flying saucer and a time machine
People get so hung up on specifics
They miss out on seeing the whole thing
Take South America for example
In South America thousands of people go missing every year
Nobody knows where they go
They just like disappear
But if you think about it for a minute, you realize something
There had to be a time when there was no people
Right
Yeah
guess
Well where did all these people come from
hmmm
'll tell you where
The future
Where did all these people disappear to
hmmm
The past
That's right and how did they get there
How the fuck (hell) do  know
Flying saucers
Which are really
Yeah you got it
Time machines
think a lot about this kind of stuff
do my best thinking on the bus
That how come don't drive, see
You don't even know how to drive
don't want to know how
don't want to learn
See
The more you drive, the less intelligent you are
In Bud's car driving through a tunnel You know  think  saw one of those things once
One of those UFOs
mean it was really it was kind of kind of scary
saw all these colored lights and, uh, sounds
mean sounds and lights like  never heard before
mean it was really weird
Bud
Yeah
Do you think all repo men follow the code
Of course
Well  mean you see a lot of fucked (messed) up cars come in but
99 time out of 100 it was the customer who fucked (mucked) them up
Assholes (Damn fools)
Bud in phone booth outside the Rodriguez brothers' apartment
'm offering a thousands dollars for his Falcon
You know what that is Napoleon
It's a bribe
Who the hell is this
Napoleon
Who the fuck (hell) are you calling
It's a grand if you show me where his car is Napoleon
[ Ahh

Otto
Otto
Huh
What did you want to tell me
Oh
Take off your clothes

Otto takes down his pants (according to the filmmakers, Estevez enjoyed doing this on a regular basis
Maybe they were just joking
)
What are you doing
Don't do that
[ Well the least you could do is give me a blow job
Leila slaps Otto Heh,  guess that means no
] Leila
We have a cell meeting in two minutes time
Thanks Deadra

Bud and Lite parked in their cars side by side See that motherfucker (melonfarmer) only thinks  don't know what's going on, Lite
As soon as  find that Chevy 'm going indy

Sit around and watch everybody else do the work for a while (change)
Lite lights up a roach
No way you can do that on twenty grand man
The hell  can as long as you have good credit and my credit is spotless
The hell  can't, as long as your credit record's good and mine is spotless
) If  find the Malibu, you won't see me for dust, 'm going to move to Mendecino County, raise me a bumper crop of tomato plants
Bud and Otto in a car Credit is a sacred trust
It's what our free society is founded on
You think they give a damn about their bills in Russia
said do you think they give a damn about their bills in Russia
They don't pay bills in Russia
It's all free
All free
Free my ass, what are you a fucking (flippin) commie
Huh
No  ain't no commie
Well you'd better not be  don't want any commies in my car
No Christians either
Chevy Malibu exits car wash and pulls up to gas pumps
That's director Alex Cox wiping the car as it pulls away from the car wash and over to the pumps
The pumps at the gas station say "Pace Gas"
Next to the pump is a campaign poster for Harry Pace, running for City Council
These posters appear elsewhere in the film
In his posters, Harry Pace has a happy face
'll deal with you later
've got a customer to attend to
You too
Kevin walks over to Malibu
Hi
'm Kevin
Vacuum sir
Need a vacuum sir
Parnell runs fingers through hair and pulls out a clump
Have you any machines
You don't want to eat from a machine
Look, there's a nice Del Taco across the street
They've got enchurritos and everything
But  do want to eat from a machine
Vended food contains all the necessary nutrients for survival
Taste damn good too, by golly
And plus, on any given evening, the machine that last night gave you cheetos might dispense instead
Doritos
Yohos
Oreos
Tosquitos (tostitos
)
Or Lorna Doones
Lorna Doones
love Lorna Doones
Parnell walks off screen and we hear puking sounds
Oh hey
You want me to check the trunk
Scuze me
Lagarto and Napoleon pull up in a car one other side of pumps
Latino music plays on their car radio
Hi
'm Kevin
Hey buddy
How you doing
Huh
Hey don't you remember me

Heh
Listen  think  left a book of matches over in your office over there
You want to go and check for me huh
Sure thing
Hey thanks a lot buddy
Any thing for you babes
All right, you're beautiful

'll be right back
Lagarto gets in the Malibu and both cars drive off
Kevin returns from inside and sees both cars gone
Two other attendants sit at a table and also look; the attendant on the right is director Alex Cox
What
Shot of car driving down freeway, passed by several motorcycles
Otto and Mrs
Parks in Mrs
Parks' living room It's really very simple Mrs
Parks
You don't want me to take your car and don't want to take your car
Now said to the boss  said ah Look

Sound of motorcycles pulling up outside of house
Well 've been in the hospital you see
Yeah, Yes  understand
My job is really on the line over this one
could lose it right away
'll see if  can borrow some money from somewhere
That's terrific
Really terrific
Mrs
Park's son and his fellow band members enter Oh how was the rehearsal son
' It was
Who's this
Oh this is Mr
Otto
He's from the finance company
He's been telling me that he isn't going to take the car this time, even though he could
Well, uh, gotta get going here
Otto fumbles nervously with his briefcase trying to close it
Did you like the tea
The tea
Uh huh
Yeah, it was terrific
Thank you You're welcome
Uh excuse me
Otto walks outside and gets in car
From outside we hear Mrs
Parks yelling at her son
gave you the money last week to pay it and you didn't do it
What did you do with it
'm so tired of giving you money and you squandering it
know what you done you all went out dancing some where
That's what you did
Next time  give you some money  want you to put it in the car ya hear
You're working
How come you didn't do it huh
don't know what's happened to you
(continues softly) Otto starts car and guns engine, but now we clearly see that the rear wheels are up on jacks (that it wasn't up on jacks before has been listed as a goof and even confirmed by Alex Cox, but think they're wrong
It is hard to tell in the dark, but you can see the base of one of the jacks lit up by a light from the house which goes dark as a band member runs in front of it on the other side of the car, thus confirming that the car actually was up on jacks in all the scenes)
Band members run out of house and pull Otto out of car
Hey it's cool
It's cool
like music too man, hey Otto gets beat up
One band member hits him twice over the head with a guitar, making an audible "kabong" noise
Supposedly you can hear one member saying "this one's for Keith Moon", but 've never been able to make it out
Miller, Plettschner and Otto in the lot
Miller is chanting and dancing like a native American as he puts a bandage on Otto's head
Some people aren't cut out to be repo men
Why don't you smarten up kid
Fuck (flip) you Plettschner
Don't you say fuck (flip) you to me

Lagarto calls Marlene from phone booth

Helping hand
Marlene
We've found the car
Archie, Duke, and Debbie exit a window and go down a fire escape [dropping armloads of pills as they go]

Ah Roswell, New Mexico Archie and Duke run by the Malibu
Debbie stops, whistles and gets in the car
Archie and Duke jump in and they drive off to the sound of a Latino version of The Ride of the Valkyries
Lagarto walks out of the phone booth just as this is happening and drops his clipboard in disgust
Napolean walks out of the store, silently hands Lagarto a soda, and they both stand there and sip their drinks through straws
Otto and Lite in a car The music from Bad Man is playing on the tape deck in Lite's car

Otto gets out and walks down street
Passes agents picking up dead body
(heard in background) 'm picking up the dead
'm putting my hands around this dead body
'm, 'm carrying his limp torso to the truck
And he feels like like he has only been dead a little while but
Otto sees the Malibu and gives chase
Losing the car, he stops on a bridge to puke
When done, he sees the Malibu emerge from under the bridge
He runs down the stairs and after the Malibu as it goes through a railroad crossing which has red lights blinking and bell ringing
Frank Parnell stops and lets him in
(holds out hand)
Frank Parnell

No
Ever been to Utah
Nuh-uh go to Utah every year
Friend of mine, was a designer of the  missile race track basing mode
hundred thousand miles of railroad track on a big loop through Utah, Arizona, and Nevada

That way the red team would never know exactly where they were
still go out to Utah, just to think about the way things might have been
Sir

Radiation, yes indeed
You hear the most outrageous lies about it
Half-baked goggle-boxed do-gooders telling everybody its bad for you

One day my mind was literally a-burst
The next day nothing
Swept away

Lobotomy
Isn't that for loonies
Not at all

' Haven't seen you in a while, Son

Otto returns to the Helping Hand Yard and sees an argument going on in the office Where's the car baby
That Chevy Malibu baby
Where's the car
Otto
Jeeze

Marlene steps through door
Otto steps outside and is immediately captured by agents
Agent Rogersz and Leila watch Otto on monitor Good evening Otto

They're going through it all the and they won't pick it up
2 Oh well isn't that a shame
Oh tell you it comes to something when they expect you to pick it up
Otto and Marlene see a door with a pine tree air freshener hanging from the knob
It's Bud's room
They go in
How are you doing man
Ask him about the Malibu
Look about the other night
'm sorry split
know  should have stayed with you but ah it's like when  was a kid you know   had this set of big wheels you know
Otto
Otto, Marlene and the Rodriguez brothers get chased by the agents down the stairs
Back in Bud's room Shit (shoot)
(starts to get up off of the bed) Praise the lord
Otto, Marlene and Rodriguez brother drive off and the agents chase them through the parking garage
Go
Go
Go
Come on
Let's go
As they drive off and agents run after, the glowing Malibu drives by and strikes down two of the agents with lightening bolts
Dude slow down
Agent Rogersz blocks the exit and they are all caught
All right don't shoot come on all right all right Chicken shits (stuff)
braak-braak-braak Where's the Malibu
Don't even ask because  don't know
mean  don't have it Marlene doesn't have it you and your crazy friends don't have it
So that only leaves
Everybody in Bud's hospital room Bud is gone
Where is he
Where the fuck (hell) is he
They escape the agents
Marlene and the brothers drive off as Otto breaks into and steals a car
Later
Bye, Bye
Here's another weird one
Reports are coming in about apparent hail of ice cubes south of downtown
Scientist are at a loss to explain the freak showers of tiny cubes of ice
Otto arrives at Helping Hands lot while it rains ice cubes
Bud is sitting in the glowing Malibu
That's some weird fucking shit (filthy stuff) Eh Bud
What's going on man
Shit (damn)
Eleven years of repoing cars and what have  got
Shit (zilch)
Bud listen to me
You're sitting in a car worth twenty thousand dollars
Look look we we turn it in we take the money and split it sixty forty
You and me
