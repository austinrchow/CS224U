" - Lewis Carroll "Through the looking glass" : college counselor stands at the Podium lecturing the high school seniors about their future
For those of you going on to college next year, the chance of finding a good job will actually decrease by the time you graduate
Entry level jobs will drop from thirty-one to twenty-six percent, and the median income for those jobs will go down as well
There is some rustling in the audience
() Obviously, my friends, it's a competitive world and good grades are your only ticket through
By the year Two Thousand
different teacher lectures a different class of students
The chance of contracting  from a promiscuous lifestyle will climb to one in one hundred and fifty
The odds of dying in an auto accident are only one in twenty-five hundred
(beat) Now this marks a drastic increase
Same angle
Different teacher
From just four years ago when ozone depletion was at ten percent of its current level
By the time you are twenty years old, average global temperature will have risen two and a half degrees
Even a shift of one degree can cause such catastrophic consequences as typhoons, floods, widespread drought and famine
They stare back in stunned silence
One of them, , sits in the front row with a pencil in his mouth
Nobody moves
(chipper classroom tone) Okay
Who can tell me what famine is
: 1958
Birds are chirping
The sun is shining
All the hedges are neatly pruned and the lawns are perfectly manicured
sweet stillness hangs over the  , which is bathed in beautiful
'  () Honey, 'm home
enters the front door and hangs his hat on the coatrack
He sets his briefcase down and moves into the foyer with a huge smile on his face
It's a frozen smile that doesn't seem to be affected by too much in particular--like a tour guide at Disneyland
'  () Hello darling
() enters, untying the back of her apron
She is a vision of '50s beauty with a thin figure and concrete hair
Betty crosses to her husband and hands him a fresh martini
She kisses him on the cheek
How was your day
Oh, swell
You know, Mr
Connel said that if things keep going the way they are,  might be seeing that promotion sooner than  thought
Oh darling that's wonderful
(an adoring gaze) always knew you could do it
1996 -- ( ) sits on his couch watching this entire action on a sleek new Sony
He stares riveted at the set with a big smile on his face
David wears black shoes, black pants, black t-shirt and a black baseball cap, not a nerd exactly He reaches next to him into a huge bag of Doritos, never taking his eyes off the show
() (on
) Hey, Pumpkin
What's that smell
(sniffing) Is that your meat loaf
(by rote) "It might be
" () (shy smile) It might be
He leans over and kisses her--again on the cheek
() Oh Pumpkin
You sure know the way to this man's heart
There is a loud and inappropriate
David smiles wider and is just about to reach for more corn chips, when his real '  rings out from the other room
'  () Bullshit Barry, that wasn't the deal David's mom paces the room with the phone in her hand
Between the plastic surgery and the make-up it's hard to fix her age
' No--you have custody the first weekend of every month and this is the first weekend
(pause) don't care if yesterday was the thirtieth, this is still the first weekend
Her words drift in from the kitchen while David stares at the show
'  () No  can't bail you out, 'm supposed to go to La Costa
(beat) Well if  want to get a mud bath, that's really my business, isn't it
He reaches out and
plays at an unnaturally high volume
(on
) Hey
Where are those kids
(reciting--a little louder) "Right behind you father
" (on
) Right behind you father
(  ) The Parkers' son and daughter (   ) enter the foyer together
Mary Sue wears her hair in a pony tail
Bud has on a Letterman's sweater
Mother
Father
Bud has a little surprise for you
What's that Bud
Bud hesitates for a moment, then folds up a shiny blue ribbon
First prize at the science fair
There were lots of swell projects--guess mine was just the "swellest"
Darling that's wonderful
Except there's no such word as "swellest"
Well gee whizz, Mom
lt wasn't the "English" fair
There is another jarring
He smiles right along with it
David stares transfixed at the set despite the continuing conversation in the other room
'  () Well sure they can stay by themselves, Barry, but that's not the point
You said you'd take them
(beat) Well fine--they'll stay by themselves then
(quietly) What's a mother to do
() (on
) Oh--what's a mother to do
He grabs another handful of Doritos staring at the
: (  )
cacophony of modem life
Beepers and nose rings--blue hair and tattoos
Dissonant boom boxes compete with one another
The hormones are running crazy
lt is a large open area, alive at lunchtime
Groups of kids hang out together, divided by their various cliques
The music pounds in the background
He stands at one end of the courtyard beside a chain link fence
Beads of sweat form on David's forehead as he speaks to someone in front of him
Hi
mean
(pause) Hi
very pretty blonde girl smiles back at him
It's a warm, welcoming smile
Look
You probably don't think  should be asking you this
mean--not knowing you well and all
She smiles wider at him, inviting him to continue
(pause
) mean  know you--everybody knows you just don't know you
technically
She nods at him
Well-- was just wondering--'cause  see you all the time in Algebra and  heard you humming that Van Halen song and really like that song too
(pause) Anyhow,  don't know what you're doing this weekend but my Mom's leaving town and she said  could use her car so
She positively beams
The girl flicks her blonde hair and stares back at him adoringly
Instead of smiling back, David just stares, then looks at the ground
For the first time     '
David stands a good hundred yards across the schoolyard, rehearsing this speech while the young woman stands face to face with a much cooler boy
He has a cell phone and a very hip haircut
David watches as the girl throws her arm around the boy's waist and heads out of the playground
: " "
David and his friends are all gathered around the plastic picnic tables and vending machines that form the luncheon court
The chess club meets at one end and there are some teachers at the other
All the cool kids are on the other side of the fence but David and his friends eat lunch at the same table every day
Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs
Easy
Mr
Jenkins
What  did Mr
Jenkins have
Howard looks at him, puzzled
() Salesman
What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat they found in the gutter
Scout
Marmalade
They all nod--and murmur with admiration
() Okay--here's one: Why did their parents come home early from their weekend at the lake
Everybody thinks
Nobody knows
() 'Cause Bud didn't answer the phone and they were worried about him
It's quiet for a beat
You're unbelievable
You'll win this thing for sure
When is it on
Marathon starts at 6:30
Contest's tomorrow at noon
(weighing it) thousand dollars
And it's on all night
Of course it is Howard
That's why they call it a Marathon
: David's sister, Jennifer, hangs out with her friends in the parking lot
All the girls are dressed in the exact same uniform: Blue jeans, beeper on the belt, white -neck shirt, car keys in their hand
(Even the girls  a car hold car keys in their hand)
Jennifer is by far the prettiest and, thus, is the leader of the group
They all look toward the Luncheon Court where David and his friends are hanging out
Omigod, it's so mortifying, being related to him
can't believe you're like-- Only on my parent's side
know, but you're like
twins and stuff
(beat) You must be from like, the cool side of the uterus
group of   boys strut through the parking lot
They bop up and down with the self-confidence of all cool sixteen year olds
The girls freeze when they see them
() Omigod, omigod--here they come
Don't do anything
Just don't like--do anything
(cooly) Hi Mark
He pauses then looks over at her
Jennifer slides sinuously off the fender of the car, flicking her hair like a young racehorse
She has a perfect 16 year old body and the whole parking lot knows it
Mark heads over to her, followed by his lackies
The two groups meet at the tail-gate of the Nissan Pathfinder like a small summit conference
(to Jennifer) Hey
(right back) Hey
Beat
' (to Jennifer's lackies) Hey
' (back to them) Hey
Saw you at the mall yesterday
Yeah
Saw you too
Everyone nods for a moment or two
No one says anything
() So you watching Pearl Jam on tonight
Yeah
(beat) Jennifer pauses, weighing the next statement
My mom'll be out of town
Kimmy and Christin positively  while Mark's Lackeys mumble and glance around
The import of the thing isn't lost on anybody
Mark bobs up and down a little faster
So uh
Maybe we could uh
(smiling) Cool
(nodding faster) Cool
Cool
Everybody bobs and shuffles for  beat, when Mark nods, summoning his flock
: lt is a south-westem version of "Leave it to Beaver
" The uniformity of Suburbia has been washed in earth tones
There is a red tile roof gracing every home
All the houses have the same anemic palm tree
It's a urban planner's version of hell
() know,  know--He's just like so 'm still like: "Omigod
" lt is just as sleek and impersonal as before
Maybe more so at night
Jennifer crosses through the living room with the cordless phone attached to her ear
It was amazing, Daph
'm like: "Well my Mom'll be out of town
" And he's like "Well then, maybe we could-- you know
" And 'm like "Yeah, sure
" And he's like "Well, cool
" (beat) know, he's just so smart
(pause
) don't know
Maybe that black thing just got
(pause
) It is not slutty, Daph, it's cute
(pause
) Well, "hello
" He's not coming  over here to study
(beat) know
Well 'm jealous of you too sometimes
'
lt is studious and academic--not joyless, but not colorful either
David stands at his bedroom window, staring outside with a cordless phone in his hand
He's not homeless Howard, they just don't say where he lives
(pause
) Well it's a silly question
(pause
) Because nobody's homeless in Pleasantville
His mother loads the final Louis Vuitton bag into her Mercedes
because that's just not what it's like
She fires up the car and pulls out of the driveway
() Listen Howard--it's almost six-thirty
gotta go
The huge black  sits like a monolith in the middle of the room
All at once David comes bounding down the stairs making a -Iine for the couch
Jennifer enters just as quickly from the other direction, fiddling with her clothes
They hit the coffee table and reach for the remote control at exactly the same moment
Both of them freeze then look up at each other in shock
(stunned) What are you doing
What are you doing
Neither one moves
They clutch the remote together
David, cut it out
Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes
Well great
The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty
Pleasantville Marathon
(almost reverently) Yeah
Every episode ever
(getting hysterical) Omigod,  don't be-lieeeeve this
He's gonna like beeeee here
Weil great
You can watch  upstairs
Upstairs
Up-staiiirs
There isn't any Jennifer gets panicked and yanks at the remote
David yanks back and before they know it, the remote goes flying out of their hands,  onto the hardwood floor
lt smashes into a million tiny pieces
(breathless) Oh my God
(sinking to his knees/ scooping up the remains) Oh my God
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally
No you can't, Jen
It's a new
It doesn't work without a remote
David cradles the pieces like a fallen comrade, when the behind him
Oh my God
He's here
Jennifer sweeps some of the pieces frantically under the sofa and tries to adjust her outfit on the way to the door
David just stares in shock at the shattered plastic
Jennifer reaches the front door and wets her lips
She fluffs her hair quickly, sticks out her chest then swings it open
Jennifer steps forward with her sexiest smile, but it isn't Mark Davis on the other side '
Jennifer looks at him puzzled
He steps forward, flashing her a chipper grin, toolbox in hand
repair
(beat) repair
Yeah
busted
(pause
) Yeah
(smiling wider) Well here  am
'
He glances out the front door toward a weird  parked at the curb
It says   on the side but looks like something from a medicine show
The antenna on top resembles a weather vane and the mural beneath it depicts a happy family from the 1950s, gathered around their  set
Everyone wears a smile, including the dog
The hand-painted motto reads "Rob's  Repair--'
" David looks back at Dick Van Dyke who smiles at him, then crosses to the living room He heads toward the
(seeing the smashed remote) Holy cow
Look at that
Had a little disaster didn't ya fella
Yeah
Sort of
(setting down the toolbox) We'll get you fixed up in no time
He pops the top of the tool box while Jennifer and David just stare
It's a strange looking box with the same happy family painted on the side
Dick Van Dyke pulls out another remote
() know how 'd feel if mine went out
Almost like losing a friend
(tentatively) You know, we didn't call any  repair
Well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh
Jennifer shuts the door and crosses down toward the living room
You think you could do this like soon
It's almost six thirty
What's the rush
(cutting her off) The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty
At that moment there is a huge    and a booming
It literally rattles the walls of the house as Dick Van Dyke turns toward David
Pleasantville
David recoils slightly
Dick Van Dyke flashes him a smile
() Gosh,  loved that show
Watched it for years
That's not the reason
've got a date at six thirty
(ignoring her/ leaning closer to David) Hey--who did Muff in take to the masquerade ball when her date came down with the measles
(stunned) Her father
Right
And how did she dress him
(still staring) Like Prince Charming
(studying David/ nodding) Nice
Nice
Um--hello
've got like a social emergency here
(ignoring her) Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him
Yeah
What department store did they go to
McIntire's
McGinty's
No
McIntire's
Remember: (sings) "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's
" (stunned) That's right
He stares at David, speechless, for a moment, then smiles fondly and reaches beside him for his tool kit
() Say--why don't you take this remote instead
It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it
Ooomph
Sure
Big beautiful set like this--you want something that'll put you right in the show
(quickly) We'll take it
He flashes them a big smile and holds out a weird looking contraption that seems more primitive than space age
It's a strange combination of an early transistor radio and Flash Gordon ray gun
Dick Van Dyke extends it with pride, while Jennifer and David stare at him warily
(beat) How much does it cost
Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that
It's free
Free
Oh sure
Big fan like yourself
It's the least  could do
There is a     even louder than the first
The house rattles for a moment then is quiet
() Well,  better get going
Your show's almost on, and
(smiling at Jennifer) It's almost time for your date
He places the remote control gingerly on the coffee table and smiles at them
Dick starts across the living room when he suddenly catches his foot on the leg of the ottoman and tumbles end over end
He rolls on the carpet, executes a perfect somersault and comes right back to a standing position
David and Jennifer stare at him stunned when he looks back at them and smiles
() (grinning) Take care now
There is another flash of lightning as he reaches for the doorknob
David and Jennifer look at one another while the front door shuts with a
It's quiet for a second or two before there is another
David cocks his head
David glances down at the strange contraption sitting on the coffee table
It looks a little scary
Slowly, very slowy, he reaches down and touches it
Nothing seems to happen so he picks it up
David points the remote toward the  set with an apprehensive look on his face
He winces a little, then pushes one of the buttons
The  set turns on
Oprah's face fills the screen as an angry housewife screams at a transvestite
Hunh
It ail seems normal as he pushes another button
This time the channel changes
() (relaxing) Great
He continues to press the button, flipping through the channels
Jennifer sees that everything is fine and reaches for the remote
Lemme see that
No way
He continues to flip through the channels, coming to rest on the Pleasantville Marathon
'  fills the room
() (on ) Gee whizz, Mary Sue--why can't  borrow your transistor radio
() (on ) promised Betty Jane she could use it over the weekend
"" (  ) Bud and Mary Sue clutch either end of a small transistor radio
They seem to be in the    as David and Jennifer, who are struggling over the remote control
She tugs the remote while David yanks in the other direction
Do you mind
This is like the most important moment of my whole life
Forget it Jen, 've waited a year for this
() (on ) "But  told Mr
Miller 'd bring a transistor in to electric shop
" () (on ) "And  told Betty Jean she could have it for the picnic with Roy
" (yanking at it) God, David
Just give it to me
(yanking it back) Get lost
get lost
She tugs at the remote trying to wrestle it out of his hands
David pulls in the opposite direction as they huge white light emanates from the contraption, like their own atomic blast wave
The entire room is filled with a for a second or two, before it actually gets sucked into the
It is suddenly empty--illuminated only by the soft glow of the picture tube
David and Jennifer are nowhere in sight
()
David and Jennifer are standing in the middle of the 1950's living room, dressed in Bud and Mary Sue's clothing
They still clutch the remote control in the exact same position that was occupied by their fictional counterparts
David and Jennifer glance at one another, then look horrified around the room
(a whisper) Oh my God
What happened
'm not sure
George Parker (Bud and Mary Sue's father) enters from the landing whistling a happy tune
He's dressed in a gray suit with a gray shirt, and a dark gray tie with little gray dots
(as if to his own children) Hi Sport, hi Muffin
Better get a move on, you're gonna be late for school
He continues to cross through the living room whistling into the kitchen
(desperately) What did you do
don't know
(examining her black and white skin) Uchh
Look at me
'm like so
pasty
He glances down at the remote control that sits lifeless in his hand
David frantically presses the buttons but nothing happens
All at once, there is a voice behind them
() Psst
Over here
They whirl around to see   '  smiling at them from the  set in the comer
It's an old '50s set with a big round picture tube
They run over to him as he smiles
His face is the only color in the room
(beaming) Told you it was your lucky day
Bet you thought  was just a fan or something
What happened
miracle
They stare stunned at the  set
() See, every time  thought 'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me
They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones
They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud
(to the  set) What the hell's going on
Shh
Can't talk like that now
You're in
(smiles) You know
David glances around at his black and white surroundings
His "mother's" voice rings out from the kitchen
() Bud
Mary Sue
Breakfast is on the table
We're in Pleasantville
(grinning) Dream come true, hunh
(panicking) This isn't funny
happen to have a very important date in like five minutes
Well, you don't have to worry about that anymore
() All at once the scene on the  changes and Dick Van Dyke's picture gives way to a    of the
Mark Davis is standing at the front door,  on the brass knocker
He checks his watch, shifts restlessly for a moment or two, then turns and heads down the flagstone walk never looking back
(under his breath) Bitch
(   ) Jennifer flings herself at the screen, as Dick Van Dyke appears all over again
Noooooo
You--you gotta get us out of here
(recoiling slightly) Why would  do that
Because we don't belong
Oh sure you do
"McIntire's Department store"
"Their father dressed as Prince Charming
" That was gorgeous Bud
My name's David
(wailing on the floor) Oh
(a little snippy) You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation
Look--we appreciate it
We really do
We just--we want to go home now
(hurt) But you don't know how long 've been looking for someone like you
long face slowly descends on him
() 'm very disappointed
(deep breath) In fact
'm starting to get a little upset
David moves toward the screen
Don't get upset
(snapping back) Weil wouldn't you
You look for someone for years
You pour your heart into it
This is a privilege you know
(shakes his head) don't think  better talk about this right now
Where are you going
don't think we should discuss this until 'm a little bit more composed
(turning his back) Maybe in a day or so when 'm not so emotional
Dick Van Dyke shakes his head and walks out of the shot as the screen goes completely
It cuts out entirely as Jennifer and David just stare
David grabs the remote and starts rapidly pushing buttons
Nothing happens
() (dropping the gizmo) Oh God
What's going to happen
don't know
It's not possible
(looking at her) Is it possible
() Bu-ud
Mary Sue
Your breakfast is getting cold
It can't be possible
Betty (their "mother") sticks her head into the living room wearing her black and white apron
She has a great big Pepsodent smile
Well, come on kids
You're not going off to school without a hot breakfast inside you
They just stare at her
() Forward march
They exchange a strange little glance then slowly rise to their feet
Jennifer waits for David who forces a smile then starts toward the kitchen
() just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue
It's so flattering
(dazed) Thanks
David and Jennifer walk two steps into the kitchen when they suddenly freeze--agape at the spectacle in front of them: Every breakfast food imaginable has been laid upon the table
There are hotcakes and sausages and biscuits and eggs
Pitchers of orange juice are dwarfed by the mountains of ham
The table literally sags under the weight of the food
George Parker lowers his morning paper and smiles at his children
(once again) Morning kids
Better get a move on or you're going to be late for school
They nod, stunned, and wander forward into the room
Bright sunlight streams through the kitchen window as a gentle symphony of songbirds sings outside
David and Jennifer stare straight ahead as their "mother" adds some waffles to the heap
(under his breath) don't believe this
Neither do
Well, c'mon
Dig in
David and Jennifer stare at her stunned as she puts two heaping plates at their places
Neither one moves
(to Jennifer) put blueberries in them just the way you like
Actually--'m not real
hungry
(big smile) Oh nonsense young lady
You're going to start your day with a nice big breakfast
She takes Jennifer by the shoulders and "guides" her into the chair
Jennifer looks down at a huge plate of
() (oppressively chipper) Here
Why don't you have some waffle cakes
(beat) And there's sausage and eggs and some good crisp bacon
(beat) And a ham steak
Betty drenches the waffles in syrup and slathers on a huge slab of butter
() And of course, a nice big bowl of oatmeal
Jennifer hesitates then glances over at her "mother" who looks at her expectantly
She glances at David who just looks stunned
Jennifer pauses then reaches down and takes a forkful of the oozing mess
: He stands facing the  in an actual Kinescope from 1958
The backdrop is a painted pastoral landscape and the background singers are all white debutantes
He wears a letterman's sweater and button down shirt
"
Tooty fruity--oh rooty
Tooty Fruity Oh rooty
" He  his homogenized version of Little Richard's nasty hit, (all the nastiness gone)
It becomes a slow and lilting melody
() "
Tooty fruity--oh rooty
" The   as the    image after image of this strange "Utopia
" The effect is a weird, sanitizied version of --as if Ronald Reagan had shot a music video
There are men tipping their hats and women walking their dogs; cheery gas station attendants and smiling policemen
() (slowly
) "
wap bop a loo bop--a wap barn boom
" Pruned hedges
Twin beds
houses
The in the middle of a beautiful tree lined street to find David and Jennifer walking up the sidewalk, holding their stomachs
'm gonna hurl, David
swear to God
Just take deep breaths
All that animal fat
feel it in my pores or something
Jennifer clutches her stomach, but David's glance darts from side to side--totally absorbed
() still don't see why we're doing this
We're supposed to be in school
We're supposed to be at home David
We're supposed to be in color
(wailing) Oh God
man calls out from across the street
Hello Bud
Hello Mr
Simpson
Hear your Dad got a new car
Oh yeah
Buick
It's swell
You know him
Owns the hardware store
Okay, now you listen to me
don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it
had a date with Mark Davis and  even bought new
We just gotta play along for a little while
till that guy shows up again
Then 'll talk to him and
Play along
Well, yeah
'm
Bud Parker and you're
um--Mary Sue
(ripping the barette from her hair) No
'm not gonna do it
If  don't dress like this for Mom 'm sure as hell not going to do it for you
We don't have a choice Jen
We're stuck until he comes back
Why can't we just
To who
Jen looks around this cheery little street, and the horror starts to dawn on her
At that moment, they hear a screaming and a bright    comes racing up the block
Jennifer and David step back on the curb as the firemen come flying out of the truck, grabbing the ladder on the back
(  ) They work in perfect precision
Two firemen grab the base of the ladder while a third takes the front
They go tearing across one of the lawns, in full "emergency response" anchoring the ladder into the ground and winging it up into a tree
'mere, kitty
He emerges a moment later with the cat who was stuck in the tree
Jennifer sinks to the curb as he carries the kitten by them, petting it gently as he goes
Oh God, we are
We're stuck in like "Nerdville"
(shakes her head) always knew you'd pay a price for this
knew you couldn't be hopelessly geekridden for this long without suffering some like, really tragic consequences
(voice wavering) But it's just not fair
mean--'m starting to get really--popular
Debbi Russell transferred to another school and my skin's been great since March and Mark Davis is starting to come around and
'  () Hello Mary Sue
Jennifer turns to see a strapping blonde seventeen year old driving by in his convertible
He is extremely handsome with Jack Armstrong features and a Letterman's sweater
Despite her crisis, Jennifer's jaw drops open as he slows to a crawl
Biff Martin flashes a huge Pepsodent smile
The guy is a "dreamboat"
() What's all the commotion
Where's the cat
Um
It's
Biff turns to see the fireman climb into the truck, with the kitty in his arms
Ah, right
(smiling at her again) Well--guess 'll see ya later Mary Sue
He takes off down the street with the sun glinting on his really keen convertible
Jennifer gapes as he disappears around the corner
Who's that
Biff Martin
Captain of the basketball team
(still gaping) Does he--you know--like "me"
As a matter of fact he does
(flicking her hair) Hunh
: Streams of impeccably kept youngsters file through the double doors
All cheery and very pleasant looking
It looks like a Leni Riefenstahl movie
David stands beside Jennifer looking at the entrance to the school
Three girls huddle together by the front steps
Those are my friends
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean
(staring at them) Can we do any better
don't think so
(seeing her) Mary Sue
You're gonna be late for Geography
Okay
She flicks her hair back--cops a first day of school attitude, and heads across the street like she owns the place
: It looks like a propaganda film from the Eisenhower Administration
The boys all wear crew cuts and short sleeve button down shirts
The girls all have lacy dresses buttoned to the neck
Everyone stares straight ahead at the blackboard
Miss Peters stands in front of the class with a pointer in her hand
She indicates a diagram that spans the length of the blackboard
Last week Class, we discussed the geography of Main Street
This week, we're going to be talking about Elm Street
Can anyone tell me one of the differences between Elm Street and Main Street
(pointing) Tommy
It's not as long
Jennifer looks stunned as several students nod
That's right, Tommy
It's not as long
Also, it only has houses
So the geography of Main Street is different than the geography of Elm Street
She glances around at several students who seem to be nodding in agreement
All at once, she thrusts her hand into the air
Mary Sue
What's outside of Pleasantville
The teacher looks at her with a puzzled frozen smile on her face
She looks vaguely troubled
What
(beat) don't understand
Outside of Pleasantville
What's at the end of Main Street
The class lets out a knowing groan--as if to say "Oh
We get it now
Boy what a stupid question
" Miss Peters gives a kind but condescending look
Oh, Mary Sue
You should know the answer to that
The end of Main Street is just the beginning again
Miss Peters gives a big grin as a series of heads nod up and down
Jennifer stares straight ahead, dumbfounded
: There are fifteen to twenty boys scattered around the Gym
Each is dressed identically in white shorts and black socks with a "" jersey
He stands at the free throw line with a basketball in his hand
(Not exactly an athletic image
) David lets go of a jump shot that swishes effortlessly through the net
He looks a little surprised
Wow
He stares at the backboard slightly intrigued
David retrieves the ball and fires again, this time chucking it up blind
The ball sails through the hoop again, Ten to twelve of his teammates fire simultaneously at the hoop
, The boys retrieve their shots as the coach claps his hands
That's it men
Keep it up
Big game tomorrow
He gets the ball and turns his back on the basket completely
David flings the ball wildly over his shoulder
It bounces off all the walls of the gym, then glides through the net as smoothly as the others
He stares in amazement
() Bud
Biff Martin (the boy in the convertible) approaches from the other side of the Gym
He is a classic All American Hero-- somewhere between 4- club member and a future astronaut
(a little nervous) Hi ya Bud
Hi ya Biff
He fidgets nervously for a moment looking down
Can  ask you a question
Sure
Well
If  was to ask your sister
What  mean is, if  was to go up to Mary Sue
Oh God
Are we in that episode
What
don't believe it
What's the matter
You want to ask her out tonight, right
And then you want to give her your school pin
Yeah
How'd you know
(shaking his head) Lucky guess
(beat) Look, Biff
don't think it's a real good time for that right now
Biff's expression falls
He stands crushed in front of David
() What  mean is
Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately
(stunned) She won't go out with me
didn't say that
It's just that right now
don't know what 'd do if she wouldn't go out with me
All at once, Biff takes the basketball he's been holding and hurls it toward the hoop
The ball does a couple of revolutions of the rim, and then amazingly pops out
Play comes to a halt
, He retrieves the ball quickly then hurries back to Biff
David pulls him aside as play slowly resumes on the other side of the gym
(under his breath) Look, 'm sure we'll work something out
'll talk to her or something
Biff looks at him, troubled
() Honest
It'll be fine
Biff nods, a little confused, as David pats him on the back
: David stands off to the side with his sister, while class pours out around them
No way
One date, Jen--that's all 'm asking
If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack
It's too weird David
This place is giving me the creeps
Did you know all the books are blank
What
looked in the library
They got covers with nothing inside them
What were you doing in a library
got lost
(beat) Oh here
look at this
She reaches into her purse and pulls out a book of matches
Jennifer tries to light a Kleenex on fire
Just watch
You know why those guys just get cats out of trees
'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why
They don't need any firemen
Sure enough the tissue has become flame retardant
Jen, listen
(trembling) like--really need a cigarette, too
(putting his arm around her) 'll get us out of here
really will
But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence
We may never get home
She looks over at him, slowly
You really think anybody's gonna, like, notice if  don't have a chocolate malt with this guy
At that moment, three of Mary Sue's "friends" come tittering around the comer
They skitter up to her like a group of wind-up toys
(high-pitched--rapid fire) You won't believe what we just heard
Biff Martin's going to ask you out
And that's not all
No, that's not all
He's going to give you his pin
They explode in a torrent of  all over again
Jennifer looks over at David
lone streetlamp glows in the foreground
Jennifer's voice plays
You sure 'm supposed to wear this
'
Jennifer emerges from the closet in a mohair sweater and a poodle skirt
Under the sweater she wears a 1950's "bullet bra" that turn her breasts into lethal weapons
(looking in the mirror) could like kill a guy with these things
It's in your closet
(examining her profile) 've worn some kinky stuff before
He won't notice anyway
What do you mean
They don't notice that kind of thing
So what's the point
Jen please
He-llo
've got like three pounds of underwire here
Just go with the program--hunh
'm late for work
: The flashing neon ice cream cone looks good enough to drink
Underneath it, the swirling script spells " "
Johnny Mathis drifts out into the evening air
David comes sprinting up to the screen door and pauses to get his breath
He adjusts a little soda jerk's hat, then plunges inside
Mr
Johnson, the owner and proprietor is wiping down the counter
He is a "pleasant" looking man, in his early forties wearing a white apron and black glasses
The strains of "" get louder as Bud lets the screen door slam behind him
(looking up) Bud
Sorry
had to help my folks and then  couldn't find my hat
Oh
He stops wiping for a moment, holding the towel in his hand
() didn't know what to do
He stares at the rag a little troubled
What's wrong
Well-- always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then  make the french fries
(confused) Yeah
But you didn't come so  kept on wiping
He looks down at the towel clearly disturbed
David pauses for a moment then starts toward him
'm sorry
He crosses to Mr
Johnson who has polished one section of the counter right down to the wood
David takes the towel out of his hand and folds it neatly in front of him
() (gently) You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if  haven't put out the napkins yet
'm so glad you're here
understand
Biff's convertible rolls up to the curb with Pat Boone playing on the radio
He runs a comb through his short blonde hair before grabbing the bouquet of flowers next to him and heading up the walk
Biff rings the doorbell and, a moment later, Jennifer's silhouette appears in the doorway
Oh
Mary Sue
The place is really hopping now
All the spots in the parking lot are filled with vintage "jalopies" and several patrons are streaming through the door
The is still  on the juke box, and the neon ice cream soda sign blinks against the sky
David is trapped behind the counter, furiously working to keep up with the load
Several clean cut teenagers pepper him with orders while he yanks at the pumps and spiggots
It's clear he isn't used to this
(frazzled) Peppermint shake, chocolate soda, two orders of fries and a split
Peppermint soda, two chocolate shakes, order of fries, and we'll split it
David nods quickly, wiping some sweat from his brow
He scoops some ice cream into the metal blender as Mr
Johnson comes up beside him
There aren't any cheeseburgers
(turning) What
Well, usually  put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce
Listen to me
Mr
Johnson recoils slightly
() Do you have the lettuce
Yeah
Have you cooked the burgers
(quieter) Yes
Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along
Mr
Johnson stares at him
() Really
It's fine
The screen door swings open and is held there by the end of a Letterman's sweater
moment later, Jennifer sashays through, parading her new Jane Russell profile
Her "girlfriends"  from the comer as Biff rushes up to a table, and pulls out a chair
She sashays into it, brushing against him as she goes
He stares motionless at the spectacle--concerned and apprehensive
David holds a hot fudge sundae under the soda spiggot and jerks back on the lever blowing ice cream all over his chest
Biff stares across the table at Jennifer with the wholesome devotion of a labrador retriever
He looks like a cross between Troy Donahue and a mannequin
(haltingly) sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue
(full blown "Mary Sue") Well "gee whizz" Biff
sure am glad you asked me
He guffaws for a moment or two before speaking again
don't know if  ever said this to you before, but, well
think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school
Really Biff
The keenest
Oh yeah
(all sarcasm) Gosh
hardly know what to say
() What can  get you two
He stands at their table holding a little white pad of paper and a pencil
Jennifer looks up at her brother and almost bursts out laughing
He wears his soda jerk hat at a jaunty angle with large white apron tied around his neck
Oh,  dunno Bud
Guess 'll have my usual cheeseburger and a cherry coke
More goony laughs
David turns to Jennifer who puts on the same dopey countenance
Oh,  dunno Bud
Guess 'll just have a salad and an Evian Water
He shoots her a dirty look
Jennifer just smiles at him
() Cheeseburger it is
He glowers at her all the way back to the counter
David posts the order in the little carousel clip board, keeping an eye on the table the entire time
Biff gazes across the table at Jennifer with an adoring look on his face
His hands are properly folded in front of him
She's still trying to do her best "Mary Sue
" See the whole time we were in civics together,  really wanted to sit next to you--but you were always sitting between Peggy Jane and Lisa Anne
There is some  behind her
Jennifer doesn't respond
() And you always seemed so smart and everything
Like that report you did on "Our Town Hall
" Gosh
didn't know what 'd talk to you about
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated
Don't you think
Hunh
(goony laugh) Oh, right
He still doesn't understand
Biff  for a moment or two then glances down at the table top
There is a momentary break in the Music as Johnny Mathis' "" starts up all over again
It's enough to make you shoot yourself
() So  know  haven't been steady with anybody, but  just don't want to rush it
You don't want to make a mistake with something that important
Oh, gosh no
mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but  figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on
Don't you
Oh you bet
(beat) Will you excuse me for a sec
Jennifer gets up in a daze and heads toward the bathroom
He freezes behind the counter and watches as his sister practically stumbles through the bathroom door
Of course there aren't any toilets
Jennifer gropes her way to the sink and leans against the counter
Jesus Chirist
She turns and sits against the sink for a moment with a dumbstruck look on her face
Jennifer shakes her head for a moment or two, when the door to the bathroom bursts open
' (overlapping) "Did he give it to you
Did he give it to you
bet he gave it to her Did he give it to you
" (straight ahead) don't think he knows how
They  away, even though they don't get it either
It sounds like an aviary
bet he's gonna take her to Lover's Lane
bet he is
bet he is
bet he's even gonna hold her hand
They  some more as Jennifer shakes her head
David is standing beside their table as she retums from the bathroom
(chipper) Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes
(pointedly) If you need anything, 'll be right over there
(Mary Sue) Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other
She flashes him a "sweet" smile then reaches out and '
Both boys jump slightly as Jennifer gives her brother a venomous grin then suddenly waves "bye bye
" David just stares at her panicked as he moves haltingly back to the Soda fountain
(befuddled) Anyhow
really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but
You want to get out of here
What
You wanna get out of here
You wanna leave
(confused) But where would we go
(shrugging) Lover's Lane
(swallow) Lover's Lane
There is an audible  from the booth behind them
Jennifer ignores it
Yeah
Lover's Lane
You up for it
He just stares at her with his mouth open
Jennifer reaches forward grabbing his hand
'mon
Let's go
David is in the middle of making a hot fudge sundae when he sees Jennifer leading Biff by the hand into the parking lot
Everyone at the counter is enjoying their dessert, when David lets out a blood curdling scream
He vaults over the counter making a bee-line for the door
Everyone turns and stares as he races toward the entrance
Biff's car is just pulling onto the street when David sprints into the parking lot
He takes off after the car, sprinting down the street
'
' ' '
The tail lights recede in the distance as David slows to a jog and then finally a walk
He pauses, winded, in the street, then looks up toward Heaven with a pissed off look on his face
() (to God) Thanks a lot
: '
It is a beautiful tree-lined pond with a lush willow tree in the foreground
The moonlight glistens silver across the water
Several cars are parked in a row with their occupants Biff's convertible is parked at the end
'
He sits stiffly at the wheel staring straight ahead
Jennifer is draped languidly across the seat beside him, making the most of her mohair sweater
She stares at Biff in a not-so- Pleasantville-kind-of-way
He glances over at her and swallows
Sure is pretty
(staring at him) Oh yeah
Gorgeous
To be honest Mary Sue
didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while
Oh, Biff
You can "pin" me any time you want to
She leans back a liftle more, draping her arm across the top of the seat
Her tits point toward the sky
() (breathy) Or maybe  should just "pin" you
He looks over at her a little confused, then breaks into his goony laugh
Oh, that's silly Mary Sue
How could you possibly pin me
He is still guffawing when he looks over at Jennifer and suddenly freezes
Biff's eyes widen
: David comes sprinting up to the porch, then doubles over catching his breath
He clings onto the porch swing when the door opens behind him
Bud
His "mother" and "father" come out onto the porch
David catches his breath then forces a smile
Son, what's wrong
Have you seen Mary Sue
Why no
She's still on her date with Biff
is something the matter
(still panting a little) No,
was just
worried about her
His mother and father exchange a "knowing" look
George rests a hand on his shoulder
(oppressively paternal) Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys
(beat) In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here
(smiles at Betty/ inside joke) That's  she can learn to bake
Oh, George
But your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about

The low gutteral  of two coupling animals drifts out over the evening air
It is raw and primitive and desperate
The  begins to  behind all the other cars--their occupants primly holding hands in a tender sillouhette
It finally    on a convertible at the end, with a girl's leg sticking out the window
Letterman's sweater hangs over the door
The windshield is completely fogged
Jennifer's sweater is draped over the backseat
The car is rocking
They are clenched in a mad embrace: all arms and hair
Biff pulls back for a moment,  for air
His face is covered with lipstick and there is a crazy look in his eye
He's stuck somewhere between passion and fear as he clings desperately to the steering wheel
(some terror) think  better go home now Mary Sue
She holds onto his shirt as her knee rubs the dashboard
(breathless) Why
(more terror) think
might be ill
He glances down at his lap a little confused
() (a whisper) think something's happening to me
He looks at his crotch then back at Jennifer
She reaches up and grabs a handful of his hair
It's s'posed to happen, Biff
It is
Trust me
He looks at her completely confused as she pulls back down, and
: single light is burning in the kitchen window
() Do you want some more cookies
David is at the kitchen table with a nauseated look on his face
There are three empty bottles of milk and cookie crumbs all over the table
(sick) Oh no
'm fine
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares
'm fine
There is a knock behind them at the door
David springs up
Now who could that be
He crosses into the foyer ahead of his "parents
" David swings open the door revealing Mr
Johnson, standing on the porch
Oh hi
Hi there
You took off so quick wasn't sure if you were okay
Oh, yeah
Sorry
'm fine
just
Had to get home early
Mr
Johnson leans in closer and speaks in a  tone of voice
Bud
Yeah
(sotto) You know how when we close up,  close the register, then you lower the shades, then  turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors
Yeah
(proud) Well you weren't around this time so did the whole thing myself
Mr
Johnson has a strange look of "manly pride" on his face
His shoulders square back
His chest puffs out a little
There is a sudden sparkle in his eye
(more confidential) Not only that,  didn't even do it in the same order
First  lowered the shades, then  closed the register
He looks at David with pride then suddenly shifts his glance behind him
() Oh, hello Betty
Hello Bill
Neither one says anything but neither one has to
David looks on in horror as his mother locks eyes with Mr
Johnson and his new found virility
(quickly) Well, look, thanks for coming by
really appreciate it
He turns and starts hustling him down the walk just as Biff's convertible pulls up at the curb
She looks sweetly over at the driver's side of the car ( )
Well gee thanks Biff
had a really wonderful time
He sits behind the wheel with a totally dazed look on his face
Biff stares stunned at Jennifer, like he just got hit with a couple of thousand volts
Me too
She leans over and kisses him on the cheek
Then she bites his ear lobe, gently, and flashes him a big smile
Biff smiles back
She climbs out and shuts the door
Jennifer nods to Mr
Johnson as she heads up the walk
(sweetly) Hello Mr
Johnson
Oh, hello Mary Sue
She is wearing a big smile by the time she reaches the porch
David grabs her arm
(urgent whisper) What did you do to him
(innocently) Nothing
She starts up the staircase
David follows her and the follows them both
What do you mean "nothing
" That's not nothing
That's
She reaches the top of the stairs and turns to him
Relax "Bud
" We had a really nice time
(mock ) Now 'm really tired and we gotta get up early for school in the morning so
She flashes her brother an evil grin
() 'Night
She shuts the door softly in his face
David stairs at the gray wood in front of him
Biff pulls up at an intersection with the same dazed look in his eye
The car rumbles at the stoplight for a moment or two, before he glances over to his right
The stunned look turns to one of sheer amazement: '
There, against a gray picket fence, on a black and white street in a black and white neighborhood, : It would be a stunning vista if it wasn't in black and white
The church steeple gleams in the sunlight
The perfect little houses look like a row of pretty toys
David sits parked in front of the  furtively turning through the channels
He flips the dial frantically
No sign of Dick Van Dyke
() Bud
It's 7:30 in the morning
Are you watching television
He gives her a sheepish grin and sighs
: It is the same configuration as earlier
Everyone wears their Pleasantville "Lions" jerseys, white sneakers and black socks
David enters the Gym a little groggy
He hasn't had much sleep
He looks up and stops
David cocks his head to the side, staring across the gym
They are huddled at the far end, each holding a basketball under his arm
Biff is in the center of the group, animatedly describing something that is holding their
(quietly) Oh no
Biff continues his story while they stare at him with their mouths open
The Coach blows his whistle
Come on men
Let's go
Big game next week
The huddle breaks up as the basketball players all wander toward the hoop
Ten shots go up at once but Several clang off the rim, a couple hit the edge of the backboard
One slams into the side of the gym
Everyone stares in disbelief
Oh my God
: David stands face to face with his sister in mid conversation
You can't do this, Jennifer you
So what's the big deal
Oh
Okay
They're like not good at basketball anymore
Like--omigod, what a tragedy
You don't understand
You're messing with their
Well maybe it needs to be messed with
Did that ever like--occur to you

How you doin'
Kewl ""
How you doin'
(relishing her new word) "Kewl

You have no right to do this
Well if  don't who will
They're happy like this
David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set
(pause
) You like all this don't you
David recoils slightly
() mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something
you really like it
(shudders) Oh God
am just so personally horrified right now
just don't think we have the right to
David, let me tell you something
These people don't want to be geeks
They want to be "attractive
" They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better
They don't have that kind of potential
Um--hello
You want to like take a look
Jennifer motions behind her to a boy and girt who are locked in an intimate conversation
The girl wears bobby socks and the boy wears a letterman's sweater, but the conversation is sexually charged
They speak to one another in a close whisper--their faces inches apart
All at once the girt gets shy and glances away
She blows a big bubble with her gum, but the
Wow
What kind of gum is that
He looks over in shock as she sucks the back into her mouth
Jennifer flicks her hair

don't think it's anything to worry about

David stops and stares at parked at the front door of the restaurant
He shakes his head
The place has been transformed
What was cheery and benign a couple of days before, has gotten a little bit dangerous
The letterman sweaters have been replaced by leather jackets
The Pat Boone and Johnny Mathis have given way to real Rock and Roll
There is a James Dean/Marlon Brando edge in the air
Somebody has played the flip side
He enters the soda shop adjusting his paper hat
young couple makes out passionately in the doorway--all tongues and hands
When they break David sees that the girl's cheeks are He stares at her for a beat as they return to normal
David shakes his head

Various things have already : The
The David crosses to one of the booths where his sister's arm is draped over Biff's shoulder
What'll it be
(still chipper as ever) Gee whizz, Bud
Guess 'll just have the usual
Cheeseburger and a cherry coke
Bud has already written it down
He glances over at his sister
Me too
Sounds swell
(pointed) Really
It seems so fattening
Before she can answer he smiles to himself and crosses behind the counter
Bud posts the order and turns to Mr
Johnson
() Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes
(staring straight ahead) There aren't any cheeseburgers
(exasperated) Look
thought we talked about this, thought we said
Oh--what's the point, Bud
Mr
Johnson
looks up at him with a weird kind of emptiness in his eyes
David grabs his arm
'mere
He pulls him along the counter toward a little office storeroom in the back
He yanks him inside and shuts the door
It is just as cheery as the rest of the place
There is a small table with a telephone on it
Texaco calendar shows a happy family motoring in their Rambler
What did you say
Mr
Johnson glances down with a little shame and confusion
Well
'm not sure  see the point anymore
What are you talking about
You make hamburgers
That is the point
No  know
know  do
(he pauses, then looks up) But it's always the same, you know
Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese
It never changes
It never gets any better or worse
Just listen to me
(not hearing him) Like the other night, when  closed up by myself
That was different
Forget about that
Oh
Okay
(beat/ lower) But  really liked it
Bud takes a deep breath
He stares at Mr
Johnson, then tries to speak softly
Look, you can't always like what you do
Sometimes you just do it because it's your job
And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway
Why
(exasperated) So they can have their hamburgers
This sounds stupid even to David
He shakes his head
(like a secret) You know what  really like
(warily) What's that
Christmastime
David rolls his eyes
Mr
Johnson leans closer, speaking furtively
() See every year on Dec 3,  get to paint the Christmas decorations in the window
And every year,  get to paint a different thing
(beat) One year it's the North Pole
The next do Santa's workshop
Here 'll show you
He pulls a photo album from the back of the desk and opens it for David
(impressed) Wow
That's pretty good
Thanks
(continuing) But this morning  was thinking about it and  realized that  looked forward to it all year
And then  thought "Gee
That seems awfully silly
That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think

() Well don't you
think you should try not to think about this anymore
Really
Yeah
Oh
Okay
'll try that then

"Big Bob" McGee, owner of the drugstore, supermarket and Chevy dealership sits in the other
He has a crew cut that's getting shorter
Have they ever lost before
Basketball
No they sure haven't
Just feels "wrong", that's all
There are several murmurs
Maybe that's where they get that saying, "can't win 'em all
" Yeah
That's a good point, Ralph
They do have that saying
But they do win 'em all, Gus
They've always won 'em all
Well, yeah
That's true too
More murmurs, Everyone looks straight ahead trying to figure
: The women's bridge club has assembled in the Parker kitchen like it does every Wednesday afternoon
Four women are seated around the kitchen table with a nice bowl of bridge mix between them
Betty is sifting next to Marge Jenkins, the woman who accompanied her daughter to the doctor's office

Well that makes sense
Except it's spread to her lips now too
Oh,  don't know
(a  ) And you say it's just "red
" Well--like red, only
"redder
" Hunh
know what you mean
That's like the front of Bill Johnson's shop
was going by it the other day and it looked green only "greener

(lowering her voice) Have you seen him lately
The man doesn't look like himself
was getting my sewing machine fixed across the street and he was sitting in the window of his shop just staring
Wasn't looking at anything in particular--just staring off into space
That is strange
Betty reaches out and grabs her cards
She fans them out in front of her, when her eyes go wide
They are   and all
It looks like a fistfful of valentines
She puts the cards down quickly and takes a sudden breath
Betty keeps them like that for a moment or two, before lifting them up and taking another look

Well, you hear all these things lately
You know--kids spending so much time up there

That kind of thing
Yeah

What
It doesn't matter
No
want to know

Ah
Betty nods from the import of the tone but not the meaning beat goes by
() What's sex
Jennifer looks over at her stunned, but Betty just looks at her with a blank, curious expression
Jennifer hesitates
You sure you want to know this
Yes
Okay
She crosses to the kitchen door and closes it
The sounds of the  in the living room disappear
Jennifer crosses back to the kitchen counter and turns to her
() You see Mom
(softer and with understanding) When two people like each other very much
Betty looks at her and nods
: The  keeps flickering in the window
The   across the kitchen table where there is a full quart of milk and some uneaten co6kies
It finally comes to rest on Jennifer who is staring across the kitchen table with a concerned look on her face
You okay
She nods--shaken but "fine
" Betty stares long and hard at the plate of chocolate chip cookies
She's far away
Yes
(softly) It's just that
(gently) What
Well
(looking up) Your father would never do anything like that
She bites her lip weighing her next sentence
(leaning forward) Oh
Hmm
(whisper/ woman to woman) Well, Mom
there's ways to "enjoy" yourself without Dad
She looks across the table, perplexed
: George crosses from the dresser to the    in the middle of the room
He wears long sleeve pajamas that are buttoned up to the neck
George puts his glass of warm milk on the nightstand and climbs in his own single bed
It is barely wide enough for his body and takes some maneuvering
Sweetie
You coming to bed
There is no answer
() Betty
She stands in her bathrobe staring down at the tub
Her dressing gown is buttoned to the neck as well
(calling out) Yeah
'm just going to take a bath first
She swallows once as she stares down at the tub--then reaches for the spigot and turns on the water
Betty's heart beats a little faster as she  the
Betty reaches up and unties the little silk ribbon at the top of her robe
She slips it off, and lets it drop to the floor, standing naked in the middle of the bathroom
Betty glances toward the mirror and then quickly glances away
She takes a deep breath and steps into the tub
Betty slides down into the warm water, breathing in the steam, and closing her eyes for a moment
She lingers like that for a second or two, before settling a little lower in the tub
Betty opens her eyes, but they only half open
There is the slight trace of a smile
'
Her eyes close again as she bites her lower lip gently
The water continues to   as she arches her back
Betty's breathing seems to quicken as she opens her eyes all over again: , '
She stares in amazment
Beads of sweat form on Betty's forehead as the world goes to
The , but beneath can be heard the beginnings of a faint, low,
Her eyes dart around the room
Her breathing quickens: Faster
Harder
More intense
The    across the street suddenly Fire shoots straight up into the sky as billowing clouds of black smoke fill the air David is staring at the television set when he notices a weird orange glow
He glances behind him, out the living room window
Oh my God
David comes racing out of the front door and down the walk small  has gathered in front of the fire
(They don't seem frightened--just sort of amazed
) The street is still but it is now bathed in a weird
The flames leap higher and higher
Jesus Christ
He takes off down the block, as fast as he can run
The crowd continues to stare as David turns the corner at Main Street
He races in the front of the building  at the top of his lungs
There is no sign of life on the ground floor
David races up the stairs toward the bunk room on the second story
All the firemen are sitting around playing Gin Rummy when David rushes in the front door
They can hear his voice from down the hall
(entering) They still don't move
All the firemen just look at him from their bunks with a perplexed expression
() (beat) All at once they spring to their feet grabbing their helmets and their yellow slickers
They race to the landing just outside the bunkroom and leap onto the pole
The        as the comes  toward the house from the top of the block
David sits in the front of the truck next to the Fire Chief who drives the vehicle at break neck speed
Right here
The Fire  screeches to a halt
The Fire Chief looks around
Where is it
David shoots him a look then glances at the inferno
He shakes his head and leaps from the truck
He races around to the back where the other firemen are standing just as confused
David grabs one of the hoses and begins to pull it from the truck
Here
Grab this nozzle
But where's the
Just grab it
He strips out about fifteen feet of hose, then grabs the fireman and pulls him toward the curb
David parts the crowd and positions the man right in front of the flames
() (shouting) Okay
Now point this right at the flames--like this
The Fireman nods and does as he is told
David opens the valve sending out a huge
Whoa
(beat) So that's what these do
huge smile breaks out across the fireman's face--like a man who has suddenly found his purpose in life
He beams from ear to ear dousing the flames, while David runs to get another hose
() (fading in) In honor and in recognition of your heroism
: David stands at a podium receiving a commendation from "Big" Bob McGee (the man from the barbershop)
He holds a large plaque up for public display, while "David's" whole family beams in the background
And with great appreciation from the citizens of Pleasantville
huge crowd is gathered on the town hall steps
There are lots of balloons and bunting
am pleased to present You with this special commendation, from the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce
He hands the plaque to David as the entire town bursts into : David walks away from the center of town looking down at his plaque
He takes his sleeve and starts to rub off a smudge when a young woman comes up beside him
' Hi Bud
She is   , the prettiest girl in school, and one of the most popular
Margaret wears a frilly polka dot dress, that only accentuates a bombshell '50s figure
Nonetheless, she seems the image of girly innocence
That was sure swell
Oh
Thanks, Margaret
(smiling) baked you my oatmeal cookies
(vaguely remembering an episode) Oh, no
You baked those for Whitey
No
baked them for you
No
You baked them for Whitey
(low and gutteral) No
baked them for you
All at once, Margaret grabs his arm and presses herself up against him
Her breasts shove up against his chest
Her mouth is inches away from his
Um
thanks
David can smell the weird combination of hot moist breath and freshly baked cookies
He stares into her eyes for a moment, unable to speak
Margaret flashes him a not-so Pleasantville smile
See ya
She turns and heads around the comer, while David just watches her dumbstruck
: David heads toward work with his apron and little paper hat
The   music has given way to "hip" '50s drifts out of the soda shop as David pauses for a moment, takes a bite of his oatmeal cookie, and heads inside
The place has "morphed" even more
If it was a teenage hangout before, it has become almost a Bohemian coffee house now
Brubeck's " " plays in the background while several patrons talk "intensely" in their booths
David walks into the building and pauses
Next to him, one of the boys from the basketball team plays along with the jazz on a
There are several  cups on the table
Jennifer gets up quickly and comes over to him
(in a whisper) had nothing to do with that fire
(quietly) It's okay
Not directly anyhow
It's fine
David glances at the booth beside them and realizes that the bongos have stopped playing
All the kids are staring up at him, with a weird expression of awe
(still under her breath) Um
They like wanna ask you a question
didn't know how to handle it
So
Sure
He crosses to the booth where Biff and two others look up at him
It's like Elvis has entered the building
() How you doin
Swell
They keep on staring
Several glances are exchanged back and forth like they're sharing a secret
Finally
How'd you know about the fire
What
How'd you know how to put it out and all
David hesitates, weighing his words
Well--where  used to live
That's just what firemen did
This sends a  through the shop
The boy leans forward
And where's that
(carefully) Um
Outside of Pleasantville
This sends a much   rifling through the kids
It's like electricity
They glance excited at one another hush descends
What's outside of Pleasantville
Look it doesn't matter
It's not important
What is it
David stops and looks out at the kids who are hanging on every word
It's really not important
'  () What's outside of Pleasantville
Margaret Henderson (the girl with the cookies) stands in the doorway staring at David
She hangs on his words with the same excitement as the others, it just means so much more
() (hungry for knowledge) 'mon
Tell us
She stares right in his eyes
She's ten feet away but might as well be touching him
(slowly) Well
There are some places where the road doesn't go in a circle
There are some places where it keeps on going
There's an excited giggle
They lean forward
(an exotic concept) Keeps going
Well--it all just keeps going
Roads
rivers
2ND (from the back) Like the "Mighty Mississippi"
What
He moves forward extending a book
The cover reads: " " David opens the first page
There is printing inside
(quoting) "It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see
" (turning to Jennifer) thought the books were blank
They were
He looks over at her
() (quickly) Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault
They asked me what it was about and like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, But  told them what   remember, and the next thing  knew the pages had filled in
The pages filled in
But like only up to the part about the raft, because  didn't read any farther
David flips through the book and sure enough only the first chapter has print
The pages are blank after that
2ND Do you know how it ends
(hesitating) Well, yeah
do
(breathless) So how does it end
She has moved closer and is gazing at him from a couple of feet away
It's silent in the soda shop
Well--see
they're both running away--Huck and the slave
And
They go up the river
But--in trying to get free they sort of see that they're free already
David looks immediately down to the blank pages of the book that aren't blank anymore
Rows and rows of materialize in front of him
He turns to the back of the book, that is complete with a  illustration
() (quietly) Oh my God
2ND Wow
3RD Do you know this one
He shoves another book in front of David
Hunh
(looks down at the book) Oh yeah
Well this is great
(beat) See--Holden Caulfield is like this really lonely kid
The   down from the " ' sign to find the front door
long line of kids waiting to check out their books stretches onto the sidewalk
Several men from the barbershop lean against the wall next to the spinning barber pole
They watch the spectacle for a moment or two, as teenager after teenager exits with an armful of books
don't know Phil
It's pretty strange
'll say it's strange
Gettin' stranger
Big Bob McGee nods and rubs his hands over his fresh haircut
() mean goin' up to that lake all the time is one thing, but now they're going to a library
mean what's next
Oughtta be havin' an ice cream soda
That's where they oughtta be
From the shadows of the Town Hall, up the block, David watches the stream of kids emerge with their books
They cradle them in their hands like a piece of newfound treasure
George sits on the edge of his Barka Lounger, across the coffee table from "Big" Bob McGee
Even sitting down the man is a looming presence
Besides owning the market, auto dealership, hardware store, and gas station, he also owns the insurance agency where George works
George sweats into his collar
Want some bridge mix
Oh, no thanks
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs
'm fine--but thank you
George nods as Bob takes a belt of his Martini and leans forward
() George, you're probably wondering why asked if  could come over today
George shrugs--then nods--then shrugs
() 'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town
(beat) You know what  mean by "changes"
"Changes
" (nodding) "Changes
" (takes a belt of martini) And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that
It's little things
(beat) Did you hear about Bill Miller
(concerned) No
What
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds
One of those
big beds
Bob nods
() Oh my gosh
What's he gonna to do
really don't know
(beat) Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market
How
Said he didn't want to do it anymore
Just took off his apron in the middle of an order
Mrs
Thompson had her groceries spread all over the counter Took 'em four hours to sort the whole thing out
Holy cow
Bob takes a belt of his drink
George, everyone likes you
Oh well
No
They do
And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler
They respect you
(heartfelt) Thank you very much
And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right
If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it
No
Of course not
(big patriarchal smile) And that's why  want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce
(stunned/ moved) Oh my Gosh
hardly know what to say
(smiling) Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs
Oh sure
You bet
(calling out) Betty
There is no answer
() (louder this time) Still no answer
() -- '
George turns around to see David, standing on the landing, listening to the entire conversation
Their eyes lock for a moment
'll get her
He moves quickly to the kitchen shutting the door behind him
David gets a couple of steps in and stops
He looks across the room to see: Betty standing at the kitchen sink, just staring out the window
Her back is to him
She grips the formica kitchen counter
(approaching slowly) Are you okay
She doesn't answer
David moves up to her and rests a hand on her shoulder
() Are you alright
Betty turns around to face him In fact the whole thing looks like a beautiful color portrait except for the tear stains on either side of her face
(fighting tears) What am  going to do
David moves closer and looks at her
Her lip is quivering
It's okay
It's alright
(trembling) can't go out there
How can  go out there
She looks right up at David
() (quieter) Look at me
He stares at her for a second
Big green eyes full of fear and confusion
David pushes a reassuring smile
Have you got any make up
In my handbag
He crosses to the counter and grabs her purse
David sits Betty on a kitchen chair and fishes inside the handbag for her compact
He finds it along with a wadded up Kleenex
Okay--first we'll dry you out a little
He dabs at the tears, while she smiles at him in gratitude, Then David opens the compact and takes out the large powder puff
It is a truly amazing sight
As David smears on the makeup, she returns gradually to
The skin tones disappear
The flush of her cheeks goes
David takes out a lipstick, obliterating the bright red of her lips
'
He works on her for a second or two, then takes a step back
All at once, David seems to wince: '
The life is gone from her face
In an instant Betty has gone from three dimensions to two
She stands in front of him, the fictional version of herself all over again
(off his reaction) What
David shakes his head and forces a smile
He hands her the compact so she can examine herself
Betty holds it up to her face, turning her head first right, then left
() (beat) Does it look okay
Looks just like it did
And they won't be able to tell
(even quieter) No
They won't be able to tell
Betty takes a deep breath and fluffs her hair
She grabs the plate of Pineapple kabobs and heads for the door
Just before she goes in, she pauses, then plasters on a big wide "stewardess" smile
() Wait
(turning back) What
He wants to say something, but doesn't
David shakes his head
It's fine
She smiles again and balances the tray in front of her
Thank you
(sadly) Sure
He watches as she opens the door, and marches in the room, extending the little tray of hors d'oeuvres in front of her
: Mr
Johnson is all alone in the shop, setting up the napkin dispensers
He whistles ' " " when the screen door slams behind him
Mr
Johnson looks up with a start
Oh, hi
(entering) Hi
Aren't you a little early
(quietly) brought you something
From the library
He has a large book tucked under his arm that is easily three feet long
Mr
Johnson looks at him a little intrigued as David crosses to the counter
It's an art book
Oh my Gosh, Bud
Open it
Mr
Johnson reaches out and opens the cover
After a beat, his eyes widen
() just thought since you liked painting it might help to
Mr
Johnson gasps
It's quiet, and subtle, but it's still a gasp
David looks over at him but he's lost in the pages
()
Massacio's "Expulsion of Adam and Eve' leaps off the pages in vibrant, tortured color
The beauty of the garden is offset by their agony and their shame
Titian's "Venus to Utano"
Soft, fleshy, in a rich golden light
She is utterly real and entirely nude
The folds of her flesh almost seem to glow
Rembrandt's "Self Portrait
" Dark reds, umbers, blacks and browns
He looks back at Mr
Johnson with pain and wisdom
There's a brilliant light on his hair
() Mmmmgh
Faintly, almost imperceptibly, the  of a rich begins to
It's so faint you can't be sure you even hear it at all
like you're hearing it with your eyes
He    faster
Breugal's "Harvesters"
Tumees "Steam Train"
Monet's "Cathedralo"
Cezanne's "Oranges"
Mr
Johnson shuts the book
They sit like that for a beat
It's beautiful, Bud
He looks up at David, troubled
What's wrong
'll never be able to do that
Oh, well--you're just starting out
mean, you can't do it
No, that's not it
Mr
Johnson shuts the book gently
() Where am  going to see colors like that
What can he say
David looks over at Mr
Johnson who just smiles and shrugs
Must be awfully lucky to see colors like that
bet they don't even know how lucky they are
He just stares for a second
Margaret walks up the center of Main Street toward the with her books pressed against her chest
She passes the drugstore, then the hardware store
Far off in the distance, a young man comes racing out of the soda shop, pulling off his little paper hat as he goes
He comes running up behind her as fast as he can
He takes a deep breath and tries to quiet the panting
Hi
(turning/ lighting up) Oh
Hi
(pause) Look,  probably shouldn't be asking you this--not knowing you that well and all
Margaret stops in the street and turns to him
() It's just that my folks are gonna stay home and they said  could use their car
(moment of truth/ abandoning his speech) You want to go out with me tonight
He wants to turn away but doesn't
David forces himself to stare at her and all of a sudden she beams
It's the whitest, pearliest smile in the world
(breathless) Sure
Where would we go
(swallows) Lover's Lane
: David comes flying around the corner in complete jubilation
He vaults over a parking meter, swings around a lampost and leaps off the bumper of a parked car
David hi-fives into the air at no one in particular and sails over Mr
Simpson's hedge almost decking him in the process
(calling back) Sorry
He races across the street bobbing and weaving like an All American fullback
David bounds up his front steps two at a time flinging open the door
"Oh when the Saints
Go Marching in
" He lets the door slam behind him as he takes off his apron and tosses it on the coat rack
David starts up the stairs, when he  a '  coming from the living room
'  () Bud
He pauses a second and glances back
'  () David
He peers into the living room
David goes a little grayer
Dick Van Dyke is looking back at him from the middle of the screen
He seems to have a bit of a stubble
Hello there
(wary) Hi
(stage whisper) Well c'mere, young fella
David crosses slowly over to the  set
(big smile) You know 've been thinkin' might have been a little "hasty" the other day when you asked to come home--just took me by such surprise, ya know--ha ha
He gives a goony laugh
David just looks at him
() So even though  can't make any promises, well-- figured if you asked me real nice-- might just be willing to talk about it again
(quickly) can't
What
Talk about it
Right now,  mean
got to
um
The look turns suddenly dark and ominous
Bud-- thought you wanted to come home
Oh
do
Yeah
It's just that told my "dad" 'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr
Johnson wanted me to
to change the tape in the register
(getting testy) 'll be honest with you Bud
'm getting sorta concerned about what 'm seeing in some of these re-runs
Re-runs
Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey
(losing it a little) Those aren't your cookies Bud
Oh,  know they're not
But  mean-- they're just "cookies" after all
Excuse me
Well they're not just cookies mean, they're great cookies
Look, 'd love to get into this whole thing but 'm really running late
Why don't we hook up tomorrow
Terrific
'll talk to you then
He swttches off the  sending Dick Van Dyke to electronic limbo
David stands in the middle of the living room, breathing hard
' ( ')
She sits on the bed staring down at the front cover of a book
(It's an alien experience
) Jennifer is just about to open it when she senses something and glances toward the door
Bud is standing in the doorway just staring at her
He seems to be out of breath
What's wrong
Nothing
Nothing
He keeps breathing hard in the doorway
David holds the remote in his hand
Listen
He takes a couple of steps into the room and then suddenly stops
() You're reading
(glancing at the book) Yeah
Can't believe you started such a dorky fad
She holds up the cover
() Lawrence
You ever heard of him
(amazed) Yeah
Seemed kinda sexy
Look
read 35 pages
(still stunned) That's great
He just stares at her for a second as his mind seems to drift
So what is it
Well
just
(out of the blue) Can  ask you a question
Sure
Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me
Yeah
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up
No
She really liked you
You weren't playing a joke
She woulda gone out with me
Gone out with you
She woulda like rearranged your tonsils
Wow
He looks at her amazed--reliving the missed opportunity
Can  ask you a question
Yes
How come 'm still in black and white
(back to earth) What
Well 've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and 'm still like this
They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor
Oh,  don't know
Maybe
(thinks) it's not just the sex
(looking up quickly) What
She stares at him wide-eyed like someone who has just heard their name called
Jennifer's eyes dart around like she's calculating a math problem
After a moment or two, her expression changes: a vague look of recognition
() No, it's not just the sex, is it
She glances down at her book
It's a big book
Jennifer takes a deep breath and stares at the gray skin of her hand
After a second or two, she looks back
David looks at her for a beat
: '
( )
David gets out of his "dad's" convertible, carrying a dozen "gray" roses
He takes a deep breath and heads up her front walk
David sits behind the wheel of the borrowed car with Margaret Henderson by his side
He concentrates hard on the road, holding the wheel at "10 and 2" as he steals a glance to his right
It's not quite evening yet, and late afternoon light makes her glow
Margaret smiles as she turns her face into the warm wind that swirls inside the convertible
He studies her for a moment or two, then suddenly swerves to avoid a parked car on his right
They pass a sign with a happy family on it that reads: "  " Main Street turns into a winding country road as they leave the town behind and head off into the woods
They wind through the dense woodland for a moment or two before a second sign appears, much like the first: "  " Sure enough, the town emerges in front of them again, completing the 4 dimensional circle
David looks confused
Um
You gotta turn off Main Street
Oh
Right
He looks over at her and smiles
Margaret turns on the radio
sings for them as David turns from Main Street onto a smaller unmarked lane
The car starts to rise up a small hill, with Dogwood trees blooming on either side of the road
It continues to climb up the narrow gravel lane toward the crest in the hill
David looks over at Margaret who takes a deep breath shutting her eyes
He glances down at the seat between them
They sit next to him on the seat: a deep, rich
David looks up and out the windshield
The same thing seems to be happening around them
Many of the Dogwoods have started to turn
Not all of them, but at least fifty percent of the petals have "bloomed" in some weird false spring
The road twists and turns on its way to the top, as they finally reach a crest in the hill
Wow
There, sitting in front of them, is a whole world gone Technicolor: (all "turned" now) () (over the car radios) "Cupid, draw back your bow
" Slowly, David rolls the convertible forward
Many of the kids have left their cars and sit down along the grassy bank by the edge of the water
few of them have books open
It almost looks "Athenian
" David looks at the whole scene for a moment then suddenly cocks his head to the side
What's that smell
Margaret looks at him and smiles
She leans well out of the convertible, and plucks a Gardenia from a bush that is blooming beside the car
Aren't these great
David takes the flower, then puts it up to his nose
He takes a long deep breath then all at once, his posture seems to relax
As the fragrance enters his body his eyes drift like some strange narcotic is washing over him
David lowers the flower
Betty is walking down Main Street with a shopping bag on either hand
From a block away, she looks like any other homemaker in Pleasantville
You don't even notice the gray make-up
She nods to Mrs
Filmore in the bakery and smiles at Don in the Post Office
Betty is just about to turn on Elm Street when she glances up, and suddenly stops
There, in the middle of the block, sits Mr
Johnson's soda shop
The whole scene is still black and white, except for the large
'
It is rendered in bright ,   , and looks like a Braque or a Picasso except for the unusual subject matter
Upon closer examination you see that all the spheres and cones add up to an avante garde snow scene, with a Cubist Santa hovering over the roof tops
She stares at it, mesmerized for a moment, then starts to wander across the street
It's late afternoon and the business district is empty
Betty crosses in the middle of the block, staring straight ahead
The door opens and she sticks her head inside
Most of the place is dark except for one streak of sunlight shining through the window near the back of the store
Betty glances around
The little bell  as she enters
() We're closed right now
He sits in front of a small easel near the back, staring at a board which doubles as a canvas
Mr
Johnson glances over his shoulder and recognizes Betty in the doorway
Oh, hi
(turning to leave) 'm sorry
No, no
Come on in
He gets up from his stool and crosses toward the door, still holding the palette in his hand
Betty stares at the "Cubist Christmas" in the window
just thought
It's beautiful
Thanks
Their eyes lock for a second
Sort of a clutzy silence
Mr
Johnson motions toward his easel
() was just trying to do one of these "still lifes
" He sighs and looks behind him
Next to the easel is a bowl of () Having kind of a tough time
think it looks nice
Well
(shrugs) Here's what it's s'posed to look like
He leads her over to the table and points down at the art book
It's open to a Cezanne that nearly burns off the page
Oh my
They are standing almost on top of each other gazing down at the book
Neither one of them moves
Betty almost disappears into the pictures--drawn by a strange new world
Here
Look at this
He turns to Kandinsky--a massive swirl of color
The image is nearly electric
(breathless) Where'd you get this
Bud brought it to me
Bud
Here's my favorite
He turns the page near the back to one of Picasso's "Weeping Women
" The woman is rendered in pink and red and green
Her head is a large sphere, laying "peacefully" on her own shoulder
What do you think
She doesn't answer
() Isn't it great how she's resting like that
(faintly) She's crying
Mr
Johnson looks down at the painting
What
She's crying
No she's not
Yes she is
He looks up at her
single tear is running down Betty's cheek
She senses it and reaches up to wipe it quickly away, but instead of just wiping the tear, she takes off a huge swath of  -
long strip of   is revealed underneath
He stares up at her in amazement
She senses something and glances down at her hand
Her fingertips are covered in  -
Betty turns and bolts for the door
(following her) Wait
've got to go
It's alright
He stops her near the door and she turns her face toward the wall
Mr
Johnson touches her shoulder
() It's alright
Let me see
(shame) No
He reaches up and gently touches her chin
Mr
Johnson moves around to glimpse the other side of her cheek
It's beautiful
She freezes like that for a moment, then slowly, haltingly, turns toward him
of her real flesh is revealed underneath
Betty stands there exposed
(a whisper) It's beautiful
She swallows, not sure what to do
Betty glances down
() You shouldn't cover that up
Mr
Johnson reaches over to the little napkin dispenser on the counter and pulls one out
He leans forward and dabs at the tears beneath Betty's eyes
Then slowly, gently, he starts to wipe the makeup off her cheek
She recoils a bit, tensing up, then just looks at him
Mr
Johnson is gazing at her "true color" with wonder and acceptance
She hesitates for an instant, then seems to make a decision
Betty slowly turns her face to the side, exposing her flesh all the way down to the neck
Mr
Johnson continues to wipe off the make up in larger and larger strokes as the beautiful pink flesh begins to emerge
: ' ( ')
She lies on her bed, reading the same book she was browsing earlier
Jennifer seems strangely engrossed as she flips the pages, lying on her stomach, scouring every word
After a moment or two she gets restless and shifts position, lifting the book
The cover is plainly visible: " ' " She doesn't have enough light so Jennifer rises from the bed and crosses to "her" desk
She sits in the chair and flattens the book in front of her
Jennifer is deep into the plot and doesn't even look up as she flicks on the desk lamp
She could almost be studying algebra as she sits upright at the little desk
She flips the page and peers more intently
Her hair is bothering her so she pulls it back and knots it in a pony tail
After a little while her eyes begin to get more tired and she looks up and blinks a couple of times
Jennifer notices something across the desk
pair of Mary Sue's glasses are neatly folded in front of her
Jennifer reaches out, puts them on her head, glances back down at the print
(impressed) Hunh
She can see much clearer now
Jennifer folds her hands in front of her and doesn't even realize that she has mimicked the The face is the same, but that's to be expected
So is the pony tail, the glasses, the posture and the studious look on her face
Jennifer turns the page engrossed in her novel when there is a loud  on the window
She rises from the desk and pulls back the curtain
Jennifer slides open the window
Biff stands on the front lawn tossing pebbles at the window
Mary Sue--'mon
(leaning out the window) What are you doing
(jiggling in anticipation) It's six-thirty
So
We were gonna
You know
He jiggles some more
Oh
(remembering) can't
Why not
She glances down at her book
'm busy
(surprised) With what
'
She hesitates for a second then glances back at the desk
Her own image in the silver frame stares back at her
The hair is pulled back in a pony tail
The glasses sit on the front of her nose
(turning to Biff) 'm studying
She thinks about it for a moment, then suddenly smiles
Biff stands dumbfounded on the sidewalk as Jennifer reaches up and quietly closes the window
: '
David and Margaret sit on the edge of the grass, looking out across the water
Even in the moonlight, the  are vivid
David still clutches the gardenia in his hand, taking a long hit like an Opium addict
(inhaling) Mmmmgh
Do they have those
Where you come from
Yeah
guess
(beat) don't know
You don't know
Margaret laughs like that isn't even possible
She shifts on the grass hiking her skirt up above the knee
It reveals a long tan leg beneath it
David watches as she kicks off her shoes, rubbing her feet through the long cool grass
() So what's it like
What
(a whisper) Out there
She clings onto the words like they could transport her by themselves
David thinks for a moment
Oh
don't know
It's different
She leans forward
How
Well it's louder
And scarier guess
And
and a lot more dangerous
Sounds fantastic
You know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming--took off all their clothes
She giggles
David looks at her in amazement
() Do they have an Ocean
've heard about the ocean
Yeah
What's that like
Well it's big
And it's blue
(as if realizing it for the first time) It's really really blue
Mmmm
(beat) Boy
It's hot up here
Suddenly and without warning Margaret unbuttons her cardigan sweater
She slips it off, arching her back like the figurehead of a ship and David just stares at her breasts
She wears a light cotton blouse and even in the moonlight it forms a translucent silhouette
She lays the sweater across the grass and leans back on it
() You want some berries
Hunh
She unfolds a handkerchief revealing a handful of berries in picked them myself
They grow wild up here
(eating one) Mmm
So sweet
(looking at them) They just grow like that
(looking straight up) Oh yeah
There's a lot of stuff
Currants and strawberries
Here
'll show you
She hops up and scampers across the grassy bank, kicking her heels behind her
Margaret reaches a tree in the distance and reaches toward an upper limb, stretching out her body like a piece of statuary
She picks a piece of fruit and scampers back toward him, hiking up her skirt as she goes
() Here
Margaret sticks out her hand, offering him a It's brilliant and shiny and glistens in the moonlight
He hesitates just looking at it
Margaret speaks in a whisper
Go on
Try it
She is lying on her stomach now, and behind the outstretched apple he can see an ample view of her cleavage
Margaret is smiling at him as the apple shines in the foreground
David reaches out and takes it
For this instant, they seem alone in the garden
He looks down at it, then glances over at Margaret
David hesitates for a split second then takes a bite of the apple
: George heads home with his briefcase in hand whistling a happy tune
He smiles at Mr
Simpson and swings the attache case as he turns and heads up his front walk
George opens the door and sets the briefcase by the stairs like he always does
He hangs his hat on the hatrack, his coat on the coatrack, and beams as he hollers his nightly greeting: Honey--'m home
There is no response
He looks a little perplexed but smiles as he calls out again: () Honey--'m home
There is more silence
George looks around a little confused when there is a
: Betty sits in a comer of the shop, next to the gray bowl of fruit
She holds her head to the side, sitting gracefully with her chin in the air
Mr
Johnson sits behind his easel, painting her portrait from a few feet away
Betty looks radiant with no trace of the makeup, the warm lit softly by a bare forty watt bulb
She looks over at Mr
Johnson when they hear the Each of them freezes
There is , The "Cubist Snowscene" lights up brightly, illuminated by the sudden flash of lightning behind it
Betty leaps up from the chair and crosses to the window looking out
(frightened) What is that
don't know
Betty looks back at Mr
Johnson and suddenly sees the painting
She flinches for a second
Her eyes go wide
It is Cubist (like the rest of his recent work) but that isn't the shocking part
Even though she sits in front of him fully clothed, Mr
Johnson has painted a beautiful, sensual nude
Betty just stares at the canvas, stunned to see herself revealed like that
The  are all hot pinks and oranges and yellows--like some Fauvist celebration of summertime
There is another even
She looks over at Mr
Johnson and he glances down
After a moment or two he looks back at her, but she doesn't turn to run
Betty just stares at him, then without even realizing it, moves slightly closer
: '
David and Margaret are locked in a deep passionate kiss
At first they don't separate when they hear the It is only when they hear the   and the starts to fall, that Margaret pulls back and looks up in the sky
What is that
He is still in an amorous daze and doesn't even feel the increasing rain
It starts to pound harder and Margaret looks to him in terror
What's going on
Rain
Real rain
Yeah
You don't have rain either
She looks at him frightened
David smiles
() Right
Of course you don't
He puts his jacket around her and starts to lead her up the grassy slope
dozen other couples go scurrying up the bank, looking in terror at the water falling from the sky
What do we do
(reaching the car) We'll just put up the top
He goes fishing around the boot of the car, looking for the catch to release it
David leans into the back seat fishing around as the rain starts to pound harder
What top
He looks back at her
No top either
David smiles, drenched in rain and puts his arm around Margaret who is starting to shiver
It's fine
Come on
He leads her back to a thicket of bushes where several of the kids are clustered together
They look at one another, terrified, as they huddle for shelter beneath the ledge of an overhanging rock
() It's alright
There's nothing to be afraid of
They look a little reassured and Margaret looks up at him positively adoringly
She clings to his shoulder as the storm howls a few feet away
: '
She stands at the window looking out at the driving rain
Jennifer still holds the
Lawrence book in her hand
There is a huge flash of lightning and another clap of thunder
Cool
She flops back down on the bed and continues to read
George wanders through the empty and darkened house completely perplexed and utterly disoriented
He looks around for his family, but all he can find are the darkened rooms and the sound of the driving storm
(a little frightened/ a little petulant) Honey, 'm home
He still can't find her and he crosses into the
The lights are dark there as well and he looks around confused
() (baffled) Where's my dinner
He sniffs a couple of times but there are no familiar cooking smells
George flings open the door to the kitchen but that's empty as well
He crosses into the darkness
Where's my dinner
George comes reeling out of the kitchen into the foyer
He slams his shin on the coatrack but keeps on going
(insistent) Where's my
It's really blowing now
The rain is coming down in heavy sheets, being swirled and driven by the wind
The front door opens and George wanders out onto the front porch, still dressed in his shirtsleeves
Where's my
He stumbles down the front walk in a state of complete confusion
The rain pounds against his body and within seconds his shirt is soaked through to the skin
(over the storm) '
tree limb crashes to the ground but he keeps stumbling through the torrent
George reels down Elm Street screaming skyward in the distance
'
' He turns on Main Street and goes reeling past the insurance agency where he works
George howls into the wind and he passes the hardware store, the gas station, the bakery
Finally he pauses outside the barbershop
It's empty as well with the spinning barber pole being buffeted by the rain
George lowers his arms and just stares into the darkened shop
His voice grows quieter bewildered and shivering
(plaintively) Where's my dinner
He wraps his arms around himself and shivers on the sidewalk
The regular occupants of the barber shop spread out across three lanes
Each wears a Pleasantville bowling shirt, sponsored by one of Big Bob's businesses
The  from the crashing pins is deafening and there aren't any windows so the storm has gone unnoticed
He picks up a 7-10 split and claps his hands in delight
He starts to cross back to the scorer's table when he looks up and suddenly stops
George is standing in the doorway to the bowling alley cold and shivering
His shirt is soaked through to the skin
His hair is drenched and dripping
What happened
He doesn't answer
George clutches his body and keeps shivering
The men stop bowling and rush to George's side
He blinks a couple of times, still soaked to the bone
Are you alright
(looking at him) What is it
(faintly) Rain
(beat) Real rain
George nods
Bob rushes to the glass door of the bowling alley and sees the driving storm
huge fork of lightning lights up the sky
() Oh my God
He turns back to George
() We had no idea
Burt was rolling a 250 and
(beat) Are you alright
George shivers and Bobs leads him over to one of the benches and guides him into the seat
() What happened
(still shivering) Well,
came home like  always do, And  came in the front door
And took off my coat
And  put down my briefcase and  said "Honey
'm home
" They all nod in recognition
Only no one was there
goes through the men
() So  went into the kitchen and yelled it again
"Honey--'m home
" But there was no one there either
No wife
No lights
No dinner
They all
() So  went to the oven--you know-- because  thought maybe she had made me one of those " dinners
" The men nod and lean forward
George shakes his head
() But she hadn't
She was gone
moves through the crowd
George lowers his head and just shakes it from side to side
Big Bob moves up and puts a hand on his shoulder
(gently/ the patriarch) It's gonna be fine George
George looks up at him helplessly
Bob pats him reassuringly on the back
What do we do Bob
Well--we'll be safe for now--thank goodness we're in a bowling alley-- but if George here doesn't get his dinner, any one of us could be next
It could be you Gus, or you Burt, or even you Phil
They murmur again
Bob gathers a little steam
() (like a  movie) That's real rain out there gentlemen
This isn't some little "virus" that's going to "clear up on it's own
" There's something happening to our town and  think we can all see where it comes from
They nod in agreement
() We're gonna need a town meeting
Phil, how fast can you turn around a leaflet in your print shop
Couple of hours
Gus, why don't you get a bunch of kids from the basketball team to help you put them up on lamposts and tree trunks
Gus nods
Big Bob turns to George and smiles
It's a warm, patriarchal smile
He claps a hand on George's shoulder
() (soothingly) And the first thing you're gonna do is get a cup of hot cocoa and a nice dry bowling shirt
The rain still pounds out the window
Betty and Mr
Johnson are huddled in one of the booths watching the deluge through Mr
Johnson's snow scene in the window
Betty is in soft radiant color now
Almost the whole frame seems to glow pink
You can't go out there
But  really should get home
But you can't go out there
There is another fork of lightning and a booming peel of Betty sighs
She's past struggling
Betty shuts her eyes for a moment and listens to the rain pounding on the roof
Sounds nice
Once you get used to it
(listening) Yeah
It does
There is another flash and a loud
Betty smiles this time
Like a drum
Yeah
(thinks) Or like sprinklers in the summer
Betty smiles
They both listen for a moment and the fear seems to fade a little
The   harder on the roof as Betty nestles down in the booth, a little closer to Mr
Johnson
They just sit there listening for a moment or two
Betty starts to smile

David huddles with Margaret under the rocky ledge as she nestles against him with her head on his shoulder
'
She lies on her bed, still reading the book, the spitting image of Mary Sue
Her hair is up in a bun now
The glasses have slipped down her nose
There is another fork of lightning and the    of all
Jennifer smiles slightly and pulls Mary Sue's afghan over her shoulders as she fluffs the pillow and turns the page
: Drops of moisture cling to the petals as it The rain is gone now
The town glistens in the sunlight complete with a huge  arching across the sky
Literally all the     shine against the black and white of the town
It looks like a greeting card
Betty and Mr
Johnson are asleep in the booth, lying in each other's arms
Sunlight streams in through the window, warming Mr
Johnson's face which has now turned to color
He opens his eyes and looks outside
(seeing the rainbow) Oh my Gosh
'
Birds are chirping
David and Margaret also lie asleep in each other's arms, beneath the shelter of the rocky overhang
Margaret lifts up and sees the rainbow
She has turned to color as well
(awed) Oh my God
'
She has passed out on her bed with her book on her chest
Jennifer's hair is still tied in a bun and she still wears Mary Sue's glasses, but her face has returned to its rosy pink hue
She blinks open her eyes, feeling the sunlight, and looks out the window
(looking at the rainbow) Oh my God
The men are all passed out across the various lanes and scoring tables
It looks like a  shelter
After a moment or two Big Bob yawns, and stretches, and glances out the glass doorway
He sees the rainbow and freezes in shock
(horrified) Oh my
: David comes gliding up Maple Street in the sunshine with a huge smile on his face
He has that special grin and faraway look that a boy only knows once in his life
Perplexingly he is still in black and white
Bud turns on Elm Street and starts heading for his house when he glances up and suddenly freezes
There, tacked to the bark, is a hastily scrawled public notice: "" He looks up at it for a moment
George and Betty stand face to face in their suburban kitchen
He is black and white
She is in full color
told you where  was
All night
got caught in the storm
You were gone all night too
(the ultimate defense) was in a bowling-alley
Betty turns--glances out the window
() (sudden smile) Look
Let's just forget about it
Let's just go to the meeting and
told you, George
'm not going
(bigger smile) Sure you are
No 'm not
She turns to face him
George flinches slightly
() Look at me George
That meeting's not for me
Look at my face
It's fine
You'll put on some make up and
don't want to put on some make up
George's eyes widen
It's a watershed moment
(protesting) It goes away
It'll go away
(gently) don't want it to go away
He suddenly squares back his shoulders and puffs out his chest
(the '50s patriarch) Okay--now you listen to me
(beat) You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table
(softly) No 'm not sweetie
His expression leaves as quickly as it came
Betty moves closer to him
() (half whisper) There's a meatloaf in the fridge
You just put it in the oven and turn this little knob up to three-fifty
If you put the pie in forty minutes later, it'll be hot in time for dessert
George's eyes widen
() made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags
(much quieter) 'm gonna go now
Where are you gonna go
'm gonna go now
She turns and starts out the kitchen door when George calls after her
Betty, don't go out there like that
They'll see you
(beat) They'll  you
And she closes the door behind her
() Betty, come back here
Dozens of black and white citizens stream in through the front door
Several "transformed" teenagers stare at the spectacle with their
They seem to hang back in the shadows
Big Bob stands at the podium beneath a permanent banner that reads "
" As the only legally constituted body in Pleasantville, it is a natural place for a town meeting
There is nothing bright and cheery however
The floor lamps in each comer cast huge, looming shadows up the walls
The light at the podium bathes Big Bob's face in a blinding splash of light
The whole thing evokes some weird twisted image from German Expressionism-- like they are about to go look for Frankenstein
It is grayer than gray
Big Bob stands at a lectern with a Rotary insignia on the front
He speaks calmly but compellingly to a hundred men and women who hang on his every word
Bob holds a This was found over in Dave Murphy's trash can
There were four of them like this
There is a murmur from the crowd
He sits up on the stage in an honored position right behind Bob
George wears a shiny new   in his lapel, as a full-fledged member of the Chamber of Commerce
He sits stoic and upright with the sense of safety and reassurance that a shiny new pin can give you
He holds up a pair of
Jane Davidson found these in her son's laundry basket
There is a
The crowd shifts in their seats
Bob points behind him to a   lawn chair
() This is from Mary Petersen's front porch
She found one last week
There were two more this morning
The  starts to grow
: David and Margaret stand beneath the big Elm tree outside Margaret's house: a statue of two young lovers
They wrap their arms around each other in a classic silhouette
The meeting across town seems a million miles away
After a moment or two, David reaches behind the tree and pulls out a beautifully wrapped gift
It is three feet long with a bright bow
(softly) got you something
Margaret's eyes widen
She beams at him, then tears off the wrapping paper revealing a great big umbrella
a real umbrella
She looks up at him thrilled
It's beautiful
Where'd you get it
It was a prop for the school play
She looks down and giggles
Can  open it
Sure
Margaret gives him a quick kiss then opens the umbrella
She puts it back on her shoulder and turns a series of pirouettes--like her own kind of rain dance
Margaret points her face up to the sky as if she is being showered by a summer storm
All at once a pair of  round the corner
David grabs the umbrella and closes it quickly
Margaret looks to the street as the convertible slows to a crawl and two   pull up beside them
They are clean cut with faces
Hello Bud
(clipped) Hello Whitey
They smile at each other for no good reason
It's scary and arrogant
(more pointed) Hello Margaret
Hello Whitey
(loud) Hey Bud, how come you're not at the town meeting right now
(curt) No reason
(pause/ firing back) How come you're not
Oh
We're s'posed to go out and let everybody know about it
See
He points to an  that has some sort of Chamber of Commerce seal on it
Whitey leans out of the car and leers
() No reason hunh
See  thought maybe it was cause you were too busy entertaining your colored girlfriend
Margaret literally flinches
The boys share a David puts an arm around her and pulls her close
Why don't you guys just get the hell out of here
Oh, okay, Bud
We'll do that
He guns the engine as if to leave, then pauses and turns toward Margaret
() (leering more) You know Margaret, you can come over and bake those Oatmeal cookies for me anytime you want to
They share another  as Whitey guns the car and peels out with a
Margaret's lip starts to quiver and David holds her tighter
It's fine
It doesn't mean anything
She nods, groping for reassurance
: The chamber of commerce meeting is still in full swing
Various citizens are now on their feet, screaming from the audience
Ed McFadden's got a blue front door
It's always been blue
Not that blue
There's a big tree turning orange in Joe Baker's front yard
He still sits behind Bob with the same stoic expression on his face
George fingers the little pin in his lapel
People, people
think we all know what's going on here
Bob lifts his hands in the air
The crowd quiets down a bit
Obviously certain "changes" have been happening
Up until now, things in Pleasantville have always been-- well
"Pleasant
" And, recently, certain things have become
"Un-Pleasant
" Now it seems to me the first thing we have to do is to separate out the things that are pleasant, from the things that are "Un-Pleasant
" There is a loud murmur and nod of agreement
() George, why don't you and Burt take the lead on this
Why don't you put together kind of an "Un-Pleasant" Activities Committee
: Mr
Johnson has scrubbed the snow scene from the window and stares with his palette at a blank pane of glass
There is a knock at the door
Mr
Johnson puts down the paints and crosses to open it
Betty is standing in the doorway clutching her purse and a "Lady Samsonite Weekender" bag
She stares up into his eyes
: Burt Campbell opens up the hardware store like he does every morning, only today there is a slight difference
He swings open the door, puts out the rakes and shovels, then sets a newly handwritten sign clearly in the front window: " " As the businesses are opened on Main Street, more and more " " signs appear in the windows: next to the donuts
by fishing poles
beside the stationery supplies
Everything else looks frighteningly the same
: Joey Anderson, the local paper boy, is finishing his morning rounds
He reaches in his bag and tosses left toward the bakery
Then he throws right toward the post office
Then he turns left toward the soda shop, does a double take and slams into a trash can
Where Mr
Johnson had once painted his cubist snow scene, there is a brand new painting that isn't cubist at all version of Betty graces the shop window--painted in curving sensual brush strokes
Joey stops his bike and just stares in amazement
He gets up and rides away as fast as he possibly can
: David is in a happy daze, wandering up Main Street and doesn't even notice the crowd gathered outside Mr
Johnson's soda shop
After a moment or two, he glances up and sees the window
His eyes go wide
The murmur of the crowd grows louder as stray derisive comments rise above the noise
David glances from the nude in window to the growing angry mob
David goes tearing through the business district looking for any sign of his "mother
" He glances in the flower shop
toward the green grocer
David is just about to turn on Elm Street when a booming voice seems to come from the sky
() Bud
David stops and looks to his right
There, in the window of the Philco  store, are twenty screens of various sizes displaying the image of Dick Van Dyke
() want a word with you
(scared) Oh--well
() The sound reverberates like God Himself
David ducks inside the store, slamming the door behind him
Fifty Dick Van Dyke's stare at him from every  in the store
The effect is smothering
(still pretty loud) What the hell do you think you're doing
David glances around, not sure where to look
(terrified) What do you mean
What do
(beat) You think this is a toy
You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book
Look--it just sort of "happened"
deluge doesn't just "happen
" Bolts of lightning don't just "happen"
(louder) You burned down an  tree for Christ's sake
had nothing to do with that
Oh
'm sorry--refresh my memory
What episode does the orgy happen in, again
Look
It was a gift Bud
It was so special
You liked these things as much as  did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen
smile from a stranger
You know how rare that is
(beat/ quietly) Only if they mean it
Dick Van Dyke looks at him for a beat, then goes "red" in the face
' (finding courage) didn't do anything wrong
Oh no
Let me show you something
All at once a box appears in the upper right hand comer of the screen containing the image of David and Margaret at Lover's Lane
The  rolls forward as she extends the David hesitates, then takes it, then puts it to his mouth and takes a bite
" '
" The image of David biting the apple like some football instant replay
() ' David just stares at the repeated images of Dick Van Dyke on the  screens
(quickly) Where's the remote control  gave you
Why
Because you're coming home
'm gonna put this place back the way it was
No you're not
(gathering strength) 'm sorry
can't let you do that
(nuts) He lunges toward the screen and slams his hand against the "barrier
" () (terrified) 'm going to leave now
You're not going anywhere
You're gonna get that remote and you're gonna come home and we're gonna make everybody
Dick Van Dyke looks at him stunned as David turns and leaves the shop
() Don't make me get rough with you
can get awfully fucking rough
David sprints down the tree lined street toward his house
The leaves on some of the trees are starting to turn even this far into town
David vaults over Mr
Simpson's hedge and goes tearing up his front walk
The door flies open and he rushes in, breathless
David glances around the house to make sure that it is empty
He crosses into the living room
David rushes to the  and grabs the remote
He looks down at it, glances at the television, then bolts for the front door
David moves quickly down Main Street looking for a place to stash the remote
He pauses in front of the Pleasantville Travel Agency
It has posters in the window depicting various destinations in and around Pleasantville (the place doesn't see much business)
David bends down to stash the remote in a drain pipe near the entrance when he hears  from up the street
David turns to see a small crowd up near the end of Main Street
He sticks the remote in the drain pipe and rises to his feet as the voices get louder
The crowd is moving toward him
woman walks in front of a group of young men who circle around her, taunting and harassing her
moment later David can make out the face: clutches her handbag to her chest while the crowd circles her like a pack of dogs
The   of her face stands out in stark relief to the black and white faces around her
Betty holds her head high with dignity (and fear) while the ugly epithets overlap one another "Oooh--let's see the rest of you
Let's see what's under that nice blue dress
Bet she's even pinker than her picture
" One of the boys yanks at Betty's skirt and she quickens her pace
Just at that moment the boy is shoved to the ground
David shields his "mother" as he shoves one of the boys into the dirt
The kid gets up but David punches him hard in the side of the jaw and the rest of them just stare
(Violence is as new as anything else and it seems to freeze the moment
) David steps in front of his "mother" with both fists clenched
(as scared as she is) Come on
He plants his back foot primed for action
The crowd of black and white thugs just stares at it
() They look at him warily
The boy reaches up and feels the side of his mouth where a trickle of   is running down his chin
He looks at his finger in horror and starts backing away
Get out of here
They back away further and David takes a threatening step
The boys turn and run as he turns back to face his "mother
" ( ' ) David moves up to her gently
Are you alright
She nods, still clutching her purse to her chest
David reaches out and touches her cheek when suddenly her eyes go wide
() (off her look) What
'
Betty reaches into her purse and pulls out her compact
She opens it, and holds it up to David, showing him the reflected image of his own face
He holds the mirror staring at his own reflection
The courage which transformed him only seems to grow
They look at each other, both in color now, when David puts a gentle arm around her shoulder
(quietly) Come on
He begins to lead her up toward the corner
: larger crowd of hooligans has now gathered around the nude painting of Betty in the window
The jeers and cat calls are even louder
The "closed" sign still sits in the doorway
After a beat or two, a
big  goes up from the crowd
Drunk on adrenalin, the fever builds and
In an instant, Mr
Johnson's "canvas" is totally destroyed
The grows louder
Almost by osmosis, the crowd rushes the building together
The door is kicked in and they stream into the place
Soon all that can be heard is the weird It is an orgy of destruction
Stools are hurled--tables ripped out
The cash register is turned over
Two boys kick in the front of the juke box
David and Betty round the corner to find the Soda Shop being destroyed
They stand at the far side of the intersection watching the carnage as the crowd continues to run amok
After a moment or two, there are some more  as comes running toward them with the front of her blouse ripped open
Oh my God
He takes her in his arms and Margaret starts to sob
David strokes her hair
() Are you alright
Are you okay
She nods
Margaret catches her breath for a moment or two, then glances down to her side
She is clutching the umbrella in her left hand
The thing has been ripped to shreds
The spines are broken and the fabric is torn
Margaret stares at the thing with a combination of confusion and shame
David goes white with rage and looks toward the mob
(taking his arm) No
Let's get out of here
: (  ' )
They all ride in George's convertible up the twisting turning road
It has turned completely  with the dogwood petals
David winds up the trail, in the fading light, looking for refuge
He clutches the wheel tight
We should be okay up here
The car twists and turns up the narrow dirt road
After a moment, Lover's Lane reveals itself
It is lush and green like before only this time, there is one major difference phalanx of     have created a roadblock in the foreground
David jams on his breaks when he sees the barrier
It is a weird incongruous image: the black and white roadblock in front with the vibrant colors of the pond and willow behind-- like some perfect dream you can never get to
The thugs have turned their cars sideways and dragged several huge logs across the road
They hold axe-handles in their hands
(a whisper) We better go
Darkness has fallen and the streetlamps have come on
Some debris is scattered around the street and distant sounds of the mob still fill the air
David rolls back into town with the headlights off
Where are they
'm not sure
They head down Main St
and turn the comer on Walnut
All at once, a weird   bathes the car
has been lit in the middle of the street between the library and the barber shop
Twenty to thirty people are gathered around it still whooping and hollering as the bright shoot into the air
David pulls over by the curb, and their eyes go wide
From closer up, it becomes clear what they're burning
Huge piles of library books have been dumped onto the sidewalk, waiting their turn on the pyre
There is a strange celebratory atmosphere as they chuck book after book on the flames, with the glee of a teenager tossing a firecracker
David sees something and bolts from the car
Oh my God
Jennifer is locked in some strange wrestling match with Biff
He clutches a book over her head while she tugs at his wrist trying to stop him from throwing it on the fire
Don't
Just let go
It's better, Mary Sue
said,
(yanking it) 've read like one book in my whole life and 'll be damned if let you throw it on that fire
Jennifer wrestles with him for a couple of seconds and then suddenly kicks Biff in the groin
He doubles over in agony when Jennifer snatches the book and bolts in the other direction
She sprints up the street and is just passing the barber shop when a hand reaches out and grabs her
Jennifer starts to scream but David puts a hand to her mouth
(a whisper) It's okay
It's me
: The crowd has moved on and all that is left is the dark wreckage of the soda shop
Several stools lie out in the street and shards of brightly painted glass are scattered around the sidewalk
It is eerily quiet
David, Betty and Margaret sit silently in the car, across the street with the lights off
He unlatches the door handle and gets out slowly
The rest of them follow him into the empty street as they move silently toward the soda shop, like some platoon on patrol
As they get closer, more of the wreckage comes into view
Half a booth
a soda spigot
After a moment or two Jennifer looks up and gasps
Several teenagers step out of the shadows
They have scraped faces and ripped clothing--the signs
Most are dazed and After a second or two, more appear: Mary Jane
Lisa Anne
The boy who was reading Huck Finn
The kids turn to him as if he has some kind of answer
Of course he doesn't
The sounds of the Mob still carry through the air from somewhere off in the distance
Let's go inside
The place is just sad
All the remnants of what they had are strewn around the floor, The jukebox is turned over
The stools are ripped out of the floor
Betty looks over at the corner where he painted her
The easel is smashed to bits
She brings a knuckle to her lip and David puts an arm around her and draws her close
After a moment or two they  a weird  sound
Hello
The   stops
They all look to the open door and after a second or two, Mr
Johnson appears holding a broom and dustpan
Just thought 'd try to tidy it up a bit
Betty runs across and throws her arms around him
The teenagers watch as she holds him tight
() It's okay
Once we sweep it up it'll be alright again
Betty stifles a sob as he strokes her hair
No one says anything while they just embrace for a moment
Finally
Well he's right
Come on
Let's turn these booths back up
"Mary Sue", why don't you help me slide this in front of the door
We'll be okay in here
They respond to the tone of leadership
One by one the kids start to pitch in, sifting their way through the wreckage
Jennifer and David slide a barricade in front of the door as the kids try to put their shop back together
: (   )
Big Bob stands at the podium addressing a packed house
The atmosphere is odd: somewhere between a bake-off and a lynching
People sit in the aisles and in the window sills
Bob points his finger
This is not the answer people
The crowd quiets a bit
He leans over the lectern
() No matter how upset we may get, or how frustrated we may be, we're not gonna solve our problems out in the street
It's just the wrong way to do it
We have to have a "Code of Conduct" we can all agree to live by
His tone grows softer--more concerned
() Now,  asked George and Burt here to sketch out some ideas-and think they've done a terrific job
(beat/ scans the crowd) If we all agree on these then we can take a vote and  think we'll start to move in the right direction
They murmur and nod
(reading from the ") ": All public disruption and acts of vandalism are to cease immediately
" It is still ablaze with books
As Bob continues to  in , a firetruck comes screeching up to the curb
The same fireman who learned to use the hose before pulls several yards of it from the back of the truck
He can barely contain his excitement as he gets to open the valve and extinguish the raging bonfire
": All citizens of Pleasantville are to treat one another in a courteous and "pleasant" manner
" The    is nailed to lampposts and tree trunks in rapid succession
It is plastered on walls and in shop windows
Debris is still strewn around the street
dim light emanates from inside
It looks like a scene from the French Revolution
Ten to fifteen kids huddle behind the barricade while David reads the code of conduct out loud by flashlight
"Courteous and Pleasant manner
" That doesn't sound too bad
David just looks at her then continues
(reading from  ) ": The area commonly known as Lover's Lane as well as the Pleasantville Public Library shall be closed until further notice
" This sends a murmur amongst the kids
() ": The only permissible recorded music shall be the following: Pat Boone, Johnny Mathis, Perry Como, Jack Jones, The marches of John Phillips Souza or the Star Spangled Banner
In no event shall any music be tolerated that is not of a temperate or "pleasant" nature
" (overlapping) "Oh my gosh
No
" David holds up his hand
": There shall be no public sale of umbrellas or preparation for inclement weather of any kind
" Various glances dart back and forth between them
David continues
() ": No bedframe or mattress may be sold measuring more than 38 inches wide
" (pause) ": The only permissible exterior paint colors shall be ,  or , despite the recent availability of certain alternatives
" David looks over at Mr
Johnson who just winces slightly
Betty clutches his hand
() ": All elementary and high school curriculums shall teach the "non-changist" view of history-- emphasizing "continuity" over "alteration
" (David pauses) Wow
David lowers the paper
It is  in the soda shop
Everyone sits motionless for a moment or two, letting the decree sink in
David just stares down at the piece of paper in his hand with a weird kind of sadness
Off in the corner, however, one of the boys has been fiddling with the jukebox and hasn't paid any attention to what was being read
All of a sudden, his voice rings from the corner
Hey
This thing works
He hits a button and  's voice fills the soda shop
blares at almost top volume recalling a more festive time
Well all the things that you say and do Make me want to be with you-oo-oo
(suddenly/ in a panic) Turn that off
The boy looks back at her
() (shrieking) You're not allowed to do that now
He flinches and pulls the plug from the wall
The jukebox winds down with a groan as the electricity drains out of it
David looks at the kids then suddenly speaks in a calm clear tone
Sure you are
He walks across the soda shop and plugs it back in
The kids watch spellbound at this personal display of defiance
Buddy Holly's voice fills the Soda Shop but it has a suddenly different meaning
All the kids listen spellbound, as if to an anthem, while the Rock and Roll lives up to its rebellious reputation
The little things that you say and do Make we want to be with you-oo-oo
It's a crazy feeling
It's got me reelin'
Jennifer looks over at her brother with pride
Betty puts an arm around Mr
Johnson, feeling a little stronger--a little safer
The kids seem to relax a bit, and even if they don't feel totally reassured, at least they don't feel ashamed
Twenty "colored" faces listen as Buddy Holly tells them David stands beside the jukebox like a captain at the helm of his ship
He steps out over the debris and looks both directions
David motions toward the shop and a moment later the kids emerge
The disturbance seems to have died down and the street is silent although strewn with debris
David turns to the kids
(whisper) Stick together till you get off Main Street
They nod and head off down the block
David just watches them silently from the wreckage of the soda shop
: The Fire Department is cleaning up the charred remains of the bonfire
Betty is asleep in one of the booths
Jennifer sleeps beside her on the floor
David and Margaret sleep next to them in another booth with Margaret curled up against his chest
David opens his eyes
Mr
Johnson is standing in the middle of the shop, staring at the large piece of plywood where his window used to be
He just gazes at the thing as if he could look through it
There's a faraway look in his eye
He rises carefully from the booth, without waking Margaret
David crosses over to Mr
Johnson and speaks in a whisper
It's okay
We'll get you a new one
(softly) don't know what 'd do if couldn't paint anymore Bud
just don't know what 'd do
He just nods
David glances down at the table next to him
He picks up one of the brightly painted shards of glass and just looks at it
It's orange and pink and yellow
David thinks for a second
Maybe  have an idea
: The same paper boy who rode into the trash can, peddles down Main Street tossing his papers toward the curb
He throws right toward the post office, then left toward the hardware store, then right toward the bakery, then finally looks up
This time the boy slams into a lamp post
He tumbles off his bike and stares straight ahead in disbelief
Two men sleep at the base of the wall next to a clutter of paint cans
Above them, however, is painted in
Instead of being drab, the place literally gleams with life
The post office turns out to be a
The sky shines in vibrant
It is a rendering of what the town could look like
David and Mr
Johnson sleep soundly next to their own signatures
David opens his eyes and sees the paperboy
He turns around and rides away as fast as he can
: huge crowd has gathered
There is a loud buzz in the air
David and Mr
Johnson stand side by side in front of their work like they're presenting and guarding it at the same time
Most of the faces are black and white
few near the back are in color
Big Bob moves through the back of the crowd, hurriedly buttoning his shirt
The buzz grows and the people part as he heads toward the front of the pack
When Bob emerges from the crowd, Mr
Johnson flinches slightly
David just looks him in the eye and tries to find as much courage as he can
"Big" Bob looks up at the color rendering of his town with absolute horror
His eye scans the green trees, the bright yellow gas station, the puffy pink clouds on the horizon
(bellowing) Did you do this
(quietly but clearly) Yes  did
Bob grabs a copy of the Code of Conduct and waves it at him
Do you know that it's illegal
(thinks) Yes  do
Bob looks dumbfounded
He tries to process the whole thing but just looks more confused
Bob runs his hand through his hair, shaking his head
--
Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want
Betty stands beside Margaret and Jennifer watching the spectacle
There are tears in her eyes and a great deal of love
Jennifer smiles with pride at her brother
You're not allowed to do this could arrest you for this
Still doesn't make it right
There is some clapping from the back of the crowd
Bob's eyes widen
His face goes flushed (darker gray)
vein bulges in his neck
He turns to the police chief
Dan
Arrest them
( ) (quietly) Um
don't know how to do that, Bob
What do you mean
Well,  never had to do it before
You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station
(thinks) Oh
guess  could do that, then
(suddenly stronger) 'mere, Dan
'll help you
David walks toward the police chief and sticks his hands out
louder murmur moves through the crowd as David actually helps him fasten on the cuffs
Mr
Johnson comes over to join them and the murmur starts to grow
: bright full moon stands out against a jet black sky
group of "colored" kids hangs out on Main Street near the police station
They gaze off into the distance at the barred window of a jail cell
It is elevated half a story above the street
Everything is black and white except for the warm , that glows through the bars
They know in a glance who's inside
David sits on his bunk staring at the ceiling
The place has never been used so there is still plastic wrapping on all the sheets and pillow cases
He can't help smiling
Mr
Johnson crouches on his bunk, ignoring his food
He clutches a rusty nail and scratches at the plaster wall in true "inmate" fashion
Rather than scratching the days or even the hours, Mr
Johnson has carved a huge pastoral landscape into the wall complete with lush forest and a running brook
He looks at his work and smiles
He approaches David's cell from the other direction and knocks gently on the bars
David turns around
There's someone to see you Bud
David sits upright on his bunk trying to think who it could be
After a moment or two, a strange look of understanding crosses his face
He  the sound of a David looks up at the doorway and smiles
thought it might be you
He stands in the doorway, still dressed in his  repairman's outfit
, Hope you're proud of yourself
am actually
Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors
Dick Van Dyke gives a tight smile and shuts the door of the cell behind him
Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it
Where's that remote control
Why
Because you're coming home
(smiles) Why don't you just take me back without it
Oh
You're a smart little bastard aren't you
(tightly) It's kind of like a restricted ticket
You gotta leave the same way you came
David just looks at him
He smiles, confidently
Leans back on the bunk
So
guess as long as 'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place
We could have pink lawns and blue trees
Just gimme the damn remote
'm sorry
can't do that
Dick Van Dyke takes a deep breath
He glances toward the barred window
don't know what went wrong
You answered every question
You knew every detail
The senior Prom
McIntire's Department Store
We had all the same warm memories: Sock hops
The Church Social
They weren't my memories
(beat) borrowed them
It's no good when you borrow them
Dick Van Dyke's eyes go wide and he literally starts to tremble
(containing his rage) How long do you think you've been here
(warily) don't know
Three, four weeks
Much less than that
(checks his watch) An hour and a half
David looks at him uneasily
Dick Van Dyke flashes a broad nasty smile
() See--and this is really great-- the show was on for what--half an hour a week
So that means for every week that goes by in Pleasantville, only half an hour goes by in the real world
The smile gets bigger
Dick Van Dyke moves closer to him
() Now Buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow
And if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever
Well, not forever--lemme think
(calculates) Five year sentence
Carry the three
That comes out to
sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down
'm going on trial tomorrow
This is  pal
They don't fool around
David is rocked but tries not to show it
(stoicly) There's worse places
Oh sure
For the first hundred years
Then it starts to get a little monotonous
(beat) Sleep well
He taps on the bars for Dan who opens the lock and lets him out
The door  shut as the two of them disappear down the hall
The minute they are gone, the stoicism falls
David looks around his cell, truly afraid
He stares at the tiny cot
The plain light bulb in the ceiling
The single pillow with the plastic covering it Forever is starting to look like a long time
David crosses to the small window and looks out
Across the town square he can see the side of the Town Hall complete with the newly painted mural
The "Utopian" view of Pleasantville is just as he left it with one notable exception: The edges of painting are starting to turn back to : It is bathed in sunlight
Dozens of people stream through the front door for the first trial in Pleasantville's history
There is a weird carnival atmosphere in the air
The place has been transformed from the Chamber of Commerce meeting hall to a small town courtroom, complete with pews and ceiling fans
The only carry over from its previous configuration is the huge    banner draped across the back wall
At the center of the courtroom where the podium used to be is a large, elevated judge's bench with a Rotary insignia on the front
Big Bob sits six or seven feet above the proceedings finally living up to his name
The whole thing is a strange combination of Franz Kafka and "Inherit the Wind
" Big Bob bangs the gavel
The undertone begins to quiet down
All of the faces in the pews are Black and White
There is a "colored" section in the back for standing room only
George is seated in the front row of the jury, despite his relationship to one of the defendants
He is dressed impeccably with his Rotary Pin still gleaming on his lapel
After a moment or two he sneaks a glance toward the back of the room
She stands in the back with the rest of the "colored" faces
Betty cranes her head to catch a glimpse of David or Mr
Johnson
All at once, a hush goes through the crowd
It swings open and David and Mr
Johnson are led in wearing handcuffs
Dan, the Police Chief (now ballif), shows them to a table in the center of the room directly facing Big Bob
There is no lawyer present
There is also no prosecutor
He glances around a little confused
(Weird courtroom
) Big Bob bangs the gavel
Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency
Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following  colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall: (beat) Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta
Um
Yes  do
Where's our lawyer
We prefer to keep these proceedings as "pleasant" as possible
don't think a lawyer will be necessary
There is a murmur and a great deal of nodding amongst the black and white faces
Big Bob smiles to himself then proceeds
() Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness
Well--it was dark out
Good
Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children
It was accessible to everyone
Very well
Let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges
He looks directly at them for the first time
() Do you have anything to say in your defense
Mr
Johnson just looks at David, confused and terrified
didn`t mean to hurt anybody
just have to paint need to
He gropes for something else to say, but what else is there
David glances over and sees him sit slowly back in his seat
David rises from his chair
think 've got something to say
Very well
David looks out over the audience
After a moment or two, he looks back at Big Bob
think  know why you're doing this
mean,  understand why you're doing this
used to feel the same way
used to want this place to stay just the way it was
never wanted it to change
There is a loud
Big Bob bangs the gavel
() (he smiles slightly) But nothing stays the same
You get things, and you lose things, and that's the good part and the bad part--but you can't have a good part without a bad part
He turns and sees his mother in the balcony
They lock eyes for a moment
David smiles slightly and continues
() It's like the basketball team
(leaning forward) The basketball team
Sure
Everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win
There's a murmur in the gallery
() Wouldn't it feel better than when they used to win all the time
There is a
Big Bob looks concerned
() See,  know you want it to stay "Pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly
or Sexy
or Dangerous
or Wild
or Brief
(beat) And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them
(pointing to the "colored" section) Look at those faces back there
They're no different than you are
They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to
Okay--that's enough
thought  was allowed to defend myself
You're not allowed to lie
'm not lying
Here 'll show you
He turns suddenly toward the jury box
() Mr
Simpson
Yes
What color is that hedge of yours
Green
No, not that hedge
The other one
The other one
The one in your mind
The one that you see on a bright cold morning
The one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare
Mr
Simpson suddenly looks far away
He gets a kind of dreamy look in his eye
() What color is that hedge
, huge  moves through the courtroom
Bob bangs the gavel
said, that's enough
"No
Let him finish
Go on
" Big Bob lifts the gavel and is about to bang it when David suddenly turns toward George
Alright
Dad
There is a
Big Bob just looks at him frozen while David confronts his "father
" George straightens up
(solemn) Yes Bud
(beat) Don't you miss her
He looks at him stunned
Big Bob bangs the gavel but nobody listens
George just stares at him like he got shot
mean, of course you do, but it isn't just the cooking or the cleaning that you miss--it's something else, isn't it
George swallows
The  in the room starts to grow as he glances toward the back of the room
() (softer whisper) Maybe you can't even describe it
Maybe you only know it when it's gone
Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too
(shrugs) You might even call it "love
" ( the gavel loudly) Okay, that's
(motioning toward the back) Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color
Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her
Slowly, almost imperceptibly George nods
single tear rolls down his cheek
As it traces the side of his face it leaves a long trail of  behind it
() Don't you wish you could tell her that
He nods again and it all comes out
Betty smiles at him through her tears
Even Mr
Johnson smiles as well
( the gavel) '
Why am  out of order
Well  don't think it's a circus
And  don't think they do either
David motions behind him to the black and white section
There are now ten to fifteen "colored" faces
But see that's just the point
It can't stop at once
Because it's in you
And you can't stop something that's in you
(tightly) It's not in
Oh sure it is
No it isn't
He crosses to the bench looking right up at Big Bob
He leans over the bench and gets right up in his face
(smug whisper) What do you want to do to me right now
Big Bob starts to tremble
He shakes with rage as David moves closer
() 'mon
Everyone's turning colors
Kids are making out in the street
No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute
Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked
That's not going to happen
But it could happen
No it couldn't
Big Bob looks at David and starts to tremble
It starts around the base of his neck, spreads quickly up the rest of his head
After a moment or two, Big Bob has gone completely gasp goes through the courtroom
David looks at him and just smiles
The crowd reaction turns almost to a  as Big Bob turns and catches his reflection in the window
He sees the ruddy image staring back at him, then looks down at his hands
They have gone completely  as well
Big Bob freezes for an instant then bolts from the bench in panic and flees the room--flinging open the doors to the courtroom
As Big Bob flees, he reveals an amazing sight: the Town Square
The huge lawn is a rich deep green
The sky is a dense opaque blue
Dozens of spectators bolt from their seats and rush to the doorway as the crowd moves outside
(
) All the birds are really chirping
Red Brick, Yellow cars, Green hats
The barber pole in front of Gus' has finally turned to red, white and blue--he can't help smiling
David walks out into the sunlight and stares in wonder at his creation
The whole town is washed in joy
Margaret comes up and throws her arms around him
They meet in a rich passionate kiss (in direct defiance of the code of conduct)
Several people around them actually clap, like spectators at a wedding
Jennifer moves up next to them and looks at her brother making out
Uch
am like gonna hurl
David turns and looks at her
Both of them laugh
David throws his arms around his sister as more and more people stream out of the courtroom into the sunlight
: David and Jennifer stand together on the edge of town
She clutches a valise in her hand
He holds the remote control
Are you sure
told you
'm like positive
This thing works
We could go home right now
'm not ready yet
gotta do this for a little while
They stand on the edge of town (which finally has an edge)
large sign says: "Springfield 12 Miles" and for the first time, the end of Main Street is no longer the beginning
Jennifer is dressed in Mary Sue's clothes with a little bit of style thrown in
Rich fields of wheat spread out in the distance
Besides
You think there's like a chance 'm gonna get into college back there
(thinks
) Honestly
no
They both smile
() You got the admissions letter
Right here
And you're sure about this
've done the slut thing, David
It's really kinda old
David nods
'll come back and check on you in a month
Jennifer nods and gives him a hug
She holds on tight for a couple of seconds
You're like the coolest brother in the world
David smiles
Never been called cool before
They suddenly hear the  of a motor and look to their left
huge Greyhound bus lumbers up the highway, pulling to a halt at the sign
The doors open beckoning her in
Jennifer smiles at her brother, then turns toward the door
She clutches her umbrella at her side
David holds a bag of oatmeal cookies
Each one clings on to the other one's clothing
Their faces are inches apart
You're gonna forget about me
No  won't
swear
Margaret nods
She looks at him for a moment then wraps her arms around his neck
They meet in a long, rich, wet, soft kiss
The umbrella falls to the ground
(a whisper) like calling you David
like it too
David stands in front of the television with Mr
Johnson at his side
He holds the remote control in his hand
Mr
Johnson seems pretty amazed at the whole idea
Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was
You're gonna keep painting aren't you
Mr
Johnson nods
() Well
He nods again and thinks about it
They smile at each other one last time
(remembering something) Oh
(reaching into his pocket) 've got something for you
He pulls out a folded piece of paper
Mr
Johnson extends it to David who unfolds it and instantly smiles
It is a small painted replica of their mural in the same vibrant colors
Everything is scaled perfectly, exactly like the one on the wall
It's beautiful
Just a little--You know
David looks up at him and smiles
All at once he glances toward the door
Betty is standing there holding a brown paper bag
sweater is draped over her arm
(extending the bag) made you these for the trip
They're marshmallow rice squares
Thanks
thought you weren't gonna
(painful/ quieter) had to say goodbye
She looks up at David and their eyes lock
Betty hands him the bag
() There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too
Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore
won't
(voice quivering) And
wear this on the trip in case it gets cold
(nodding) It's a pretty short trip
She nods as well
Betty puts the sweater around his shoulders anyway and fusses with the collar for a second or two
Then she throws her arms around his neck
'm so proud of you, Bud
Thanks
love you
love you too
She clings on tight for a second or two then lets go
Betty flicks away a tear and draws a deep breath
() Well
She steps back and looks at him
David glances down at the remote
You better stand back a little
Betty and Mr
Johnson cross toward the comer of the room
David points the remote at the
: All the ersatz Spanish houses stretch out toward infinity security patrol cruises by them at a crawl
second or two later, all the sprinklers turn on in uniform synchronization
'
He stands in the middle of the living room looking at his new/old surroundings
Everything is the same as it was
The black onyx coffee table
The clean burbur rug
The big screen in its sleek black cabinet
David looks at it and smiles
The place is inadvertantly in black and white
He reaches forward and turns on the  (by hand) flipping around the dial
Jerry Springer is berating a prostitute
Tony Robbins hawks self-improvement in an infomercial
Court  is doing an
recap
David unfolds Mr
Johnson's sketch and glances down at it
He smiles to himself different kind of nostalgia
