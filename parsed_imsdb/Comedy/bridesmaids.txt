Written by Annie Mumolo 8/12/09 ,
Annie is in nice lingerie, happily getting ready for the day
She puts a lot of effort into her appearance
Products everywhere, too many hair-flips, eye-cream, no hair out of place
She walks into the bedroom, where , a gorgeous man sleeps
She sneaks back into the bed, carefully positioning herself and moving the sheets to show her good parts
She coughs and nudges Ted to wake him up then pretend sleeps
Good morning
Annie pretends to wake up
(') Wow, you look beautiful
( ) What
No
don't
Oh my God its the morning
look terrible
just woke up
Last night was fun
Yeah,  had the best time
have't had that much fun on a first date in years, ever
She brushes the hair off his forehead as if he were her long time lover
So listen Annie,  like you
So,  want to be up front with you
'm not really looking for a relationship right now
Annie's eyes grow large
She uncomfortably smiles at him, nodding
Oooooo
Oops
mean, yeah
What
just want to be honest right off the bat
2
Yeah, yeah
Ok
Yeah
Yeah
love that
Annie struggles to maintain her composure
'm just so busy and  don't have time for another person
Yeah, me too, 'm soo busy-- And summer's coming-- Yeah, summer, exactly
It's a crazy season
So you just wanna give me a call in the fall or--
Yeah, 'm not gonna be in town much even in the fall-- You shouldn't be
Yeah, Halloween-- 'm gonna be travelling a lot for work
Me too, 'm just- so many business trips to places that are just far awaya cause 'm doing really well at work
And honestly, (sits up)  don't even know how  feel about the whole monogamy thing, is one person really enough for anyone
mean,  like to be with a lot of different people
It is sooo refreshing to hear you say that, because isn't that what everyone thinks but is afraid to say
mean, i's science
'm- don't want a relationship either
Let's just say that
And wouldn't even care whatever you do or do,  just wanna have tons of fun, like no strings attached at all
'm just different from other girls
3
Yeah
Well anyway,  really should get going
was gonna get a haircut today
Yeah, they say that every couple months it's good to trim the ends, you know, get all the dead stuff
So, cool
Cool
've cut hair before
He waits, but Annie doesn't budge
Well, like  said  got stuff to do
Annie notices a picture of a sailboat above the bed
Yeah, me too
Gonna try to get some sailing in before the weather gets crazy
Cool, well  don't wanna be Get up the jib
late
Ted gets up
Awkward moment leading into
Oh, and thanks for the lemon bars
Oh, no problem
Made from scratch
Annie stands at the closed driveway gate waiting as Ted repeatedly presses the button
She smiles at a neighbor
Sometimes it sticks
No,  love it
The gate starts to open
Annie exits
(') Byyyyee

Annie sits in her old shitty car
She lets out an exasperated sigh, then sees the clock
Oh, shit
The brakes squeak as she very slowly drives away
'
Annie gets out her phone and speed dials
'
Lillian is getting dressed
Upscale, professional clothes
It's summer
What the hell does that mean
He can't date anyone in the summer
guess
don't know
feel so stupid now
No he's stupid Ann, not you
think  might be a little bit stupid
Ew
Did you have sex with him
No
But  gave him a blow job
What
Well, he kept putting it in my face
Lillian's boyfriend  enters the bedroom eating a Luna Bar in his sweats
He's stretching and flexing his muscles trying to make her laugh
5
Well, at least he was honest with you so you don't waste your time with him
Baby, look how hard  worked out
Look at all this sweat
Can you see that 'm on the phone
'm talking to Annie
Hey Annie
Are you eating my Luna Bar
Those are for women you know
Shit
Really
It's not gonna do anything to you
Oh my God
My breasts are getting bigger
He tries to rub up against Lillian
Ew, go take a shower
Dougie leaves
(
) 'm gonna play with my new boobs in there
swear  cannot handle him right now
He has been driving me crazy
Sometimes it feels like 'm kissing my brother don't know what do
Annie pulls into an alleyway behind ' and starts changing into her work uniform in the car
white blouse and navy skirt
At least you have someone
God, wha's wrong with me
6
There's nothing wrong with you
But think maybe, and don't get mad at me, 've said this to you before, you need to stop trying so hard
still don't think  do that
, so you had a first date last night
Did you bring him a present
Annie is silent
(') Ann, what did  tell you
brought him lemon-bars because  was making them anyway, as a friend
Yo're right, that's weird
(
) Shit
What
(
) just chipped a nail
Ok,  don't know if it's because 'm tired or what, but  wanna kill him
Ok, just take a deep breath, look in the mirror and remember when  was getting my braces off and farted at the orthodontist
Lillian laughs
Oh my God
We need to hang out
'm coming to Milwaukee this weekend
Are you serious
7
We'll go to Joni's and pig out and 'll bring some shitty magazines, and 'm gonna spend the night
God,  haven't seen you in months
'll call you tomorrow
Bye
They hang up
Dougie is in the doorway wearing her nightie stretched over his body
Baby, 'm going through some changes
(laughing) You're an idiot
We see she gets a kick out of him
'
Annie enters hurriedly pulling her hair into a bun
Hi
Sorry, sorry
'm here
'm here
(quickly) Annie
Thank God
people
Gather around me please, in a tight semicircle
Annie and six other employees gather around
(') (slightly overdramatic) Something terrible has happened
Donald will not be coming in to work today
He stepped on a wasp and there is some uncomfortable swelling
Employees mumble
(') Annie
Where's your tie
Everyone looks at Annie
She holds it up and starts to put it on
8
(') Now,  have an eye doctor's appointment that  can't change or they'll will charge me
So someone will have to cover for Donald in engagement rings
Now -- Annie and , a male co-worker, shoot their hands the air eagerly
(') Sandy
Today's your day
Ooh, my horoscope said  would be presented with an opportunity at work today
That is eerie
That is eerie
Annie, that means you'll be alone in keepsakes
You think you can handle it
() Yeah, look out
There might be a bum- rush for letter openers
The employees snicker
Sometimes there is, so
there have been
At times, there has been
Alright everybody, let's get to work
Saneel
, the security guard, rolls his eyes and unlocks the doors
Everyone goes to work
Donna gathers her things and starts walking towards the exit with Annie tailing behind her
Donna, can  talk to you for a second feel like if you gave me a shot at engagement rings sometime,  could really- Annie, what is the calibration of a 2 carat diamond in a standard English setting
Five

just made all of that up
None of that was real
just put words together
You're not ready for the big leagues
Understand
It's so hard to make commission over there
Sweetheart
did  ever tell you the story of the little paralyzed Chinese girl who wanted to be dancer
Many times
She was paralyzed Annie, had no feeling in her legs, and then one day after years of believing in herself, she stood up out of that chair and tap-danced for the king
On his birthday
My point is, Sandy makes a real effort around here
He connects with the customer
And when he wants to make a sale, he goes for it
Okay
(beat)  do want it
(smiling) Good
Showing up on time is a wonderful place to start
Donna talks to herself and gathers her things
(') Uhh
wasp
Who walks around even their own backyard without at least a thin sandal
It's reckless
Donna exits
customer passes Anni's section
Hello, can  interest you in a sterling silver money clip that will create memories for you and your family

, Annie's mid-thirties roommate, sits on the couch shirtless and is enthralled by the show
Noooo
That's, that's sooo smart
Annie enters the apartment, tired
She throws her keys down and sifts through her mail
Steve presses mute
(') There you are, you stayer-out-all- nighter
Did you make out
Sleep over
As Annie heads for her bedroom, he walks towards her room
(') Don't go in the bathroom
Are you going to bed

Your ex-boyfriend got more mail,  did what you said and just threw it away
Thanks
Goodnight Steve
She shuts the door behind her

She sits on her bed grabs a aSounds to Relaxa  with a post-it that reads, aLove, Moma
She plays it and lies down
We hear a loud Tibetan woma's voice wailing relaxing
She turns it off and curls up on top of her bed

Annie and Lillian read magazines
You're right
God, she's getting really skinny
Ann
What
(quietly) Your boyfriend just walked in
: An orange-skinned   with  arms and legs in a tiny muscle tank and shorts
Oh my God
Look, he showed up with your mom
It's a short grey-haired   in hiking boots
They laugh to themselves
Annie keeps reading

It's beautiful
Lillian
Oh my God, this is

mean,  remember when we met him at Lake Mills
You lost your virginity to him right in front of me on the dock, remember
Oh you want to get into who's done what down at the lake
No,  don't
It's just making me realize how long we've known each other
Well then, who better to be my Maid of Honor
Oh my God
don't know what to say
Annie, you're my best friend
Honestly didn't even have to think about it
13
Uh, wow
Yes
Of course
Yes
My God
've never been in a wedding
It's no big deal, and  don't want to make it one
It's not gonna be a big crazy thing
wanna keep it simple
(beat) What dessert are you gonna get
know what you're doing
Don't downplay this
'm happy for you
And someday when hell freezes over and  get married, you can be my Maid of Honor
But for right now, this is about you
This is you're day, and it is a big deal
Ok, but  still don't want this to be a huge production
just want to have all my friends meet each other, have fun, dance, drink, whatever
Then that's what it'll be
Did you guys set a date
Oh God, not yet
don't want a super long engagement, but there's a lot to do
Well you are very fortunate because you happen have the best maid of honor in the whole wide world, and-- Lillian's cell phone rings, she looks at it and smiles
(mocking) Can you hold that thought
's my fiancee calling
Lillian gets up laughing
Annie laughs along with her
Ooo, haha
Annie continues laughing alone
She looks around the room as her smile disappears
She remembers

Oh thanks

Annie laughs
He half smiles but does not respond
(') (beat) Well, some dogs are ugly
Some girls are ugly

But 'm not friends with them
've seen a lot of ugly dogs too
But some people  know who are considered dogs, you know, they have a good personality, and are better looking to people cuz of that
And people who are not nice
that's ugly to me
And female dogs are called bitches, that's weird
'm just kidding
It's a joke

The guy leaves
She hears a voice coming from her phone

She starts to leave but sees a guilty look and some frosting on Steve's face
She looks over at her saran- 's
(') How many moonpies have you eaten
Tell me the truth
Um

Dana starts to cry
She reads from a fancy sheet of stationary
With every blink of an eye, every kiss of a lip, every stroke of a lovers hand, every
scent of a woman, every breath you take, every move you make
Love conquers all
Annie sees that Lillian is touched
Helen gets emotional

The room looks around
Annie slowly rises
(') There she is

Annie stands up to the applause
The room falls silent as she walks to the podium
Um, hello everybody

You're everything  wish  could be

Some people reluctantly sing along

Lillian and Annie are at the valet
Oh my God, tell me  didn't sing
No, you sang
They both laugh
God,  don't know,  was just maybe a little out of my element, and after Helen's speech-- Ann, stop
35
'm so embarrassed
What did you think of your engagement party
Besides the impromptu concert from Bette Midler, it was perfect
They laugh and hug
(') gotta go say bye to some people  do't know
Drive safe
Lillian goes back inside
Helen appears out of thin air
Annie
Great job tonight
'm feeling slightly mortified
No, nononono
Not at all
Everyone gets a little nervous and carried away during those kind of things
So listen, 've been brainstorming some theme ideas for Lillian's shower
was thinking somewhere along the lines of Alice in Wonderland meets
are you ready
Hollywood
And for the bachelorette
Vegas
Aren't  supposed to be planning some of these things
Oh, well,  hadn't heard from you and-- She just got engaged two weeks ago
Well,  figured since you don't have any experience that you might get overwhelmed by events of this caliber
Helen, 'm pretty capable
think  can handle it
guest walks by and taps Helen
36
Excuse me, you left your poem inside
You have beautiful cursive
Thank you
The guest says nothing to Annie and walks away
(') Annie,  didn't mean  didn't think you couldn't do it
'm sure you are aware of all your duties
We'll see--we'll see you soon
Helen walks away
passes by her
You're very pretty

Oh, great

Donna and Annie are eating lunch in the break-room
37
And then they put a solution in my eyes to dilate them, which caused temporary blindness and with the loss of my sight, my hearing became bionic
Do you need some help dear
Annie struggles to open a bag of chips but her new , french-manicured nail-tips are making it very hard
No,  got it
' Annie and Donna are doing inventory
Annie gets text
Sorry
Well, it's official
Lillian set a date
October tenth
Why did  just get a stomach ache
Don't be nervous
It's not all on your shoulders
Doesnt she have other bridesmaids
Yeah and they've all done this before so 'm feeling a little pressure
have to make this really nice for Lillian
wish  could help
Weddings are a lot different now then they were in my day
They look at Donna's wedding picture on her desk
That dress is beautiful

was hoping my daughter Elizabeth would wear it but when she and Alice had their aceremonya they both wanted to wear suits
(beat) Ok, we need two Shannisburg tennis bracelets
Annie struggles to write with her nails
Oops
Hold on a sec, hard to write
38
They're very long
Hi

No, not sexy

Okay

No more sexy though
Ok
Short nail is ugly
Alright

Annie looks up different bridesmaid dress shops a '
Here it is
Ooh, Occasionz
'm impressed
Everyone this is Occasionz, supposedly it's you know, one of the best bridal shops in town, so, that's cool
Oh and also, there's a restaurant inside, so um, figured, we could maybe have lunch after
So, let's go
She goes to the door
It is locked
She sees a buzzer
39
(') Oh,  didn't see that
She presses the buzzer
Hello
Hi, we're hear to see some bridesmaids dresses
What's your name
Oh, Annie
(snotty) What's the reservation name
(to the girls) Oh, she must be talking about the restaurant
(back into the intercom) No, we're here to look at dresses
heard you the first time
So  take it you don't have a reservation for the dress shop
(whispers) You didn't make a reservation
Um, no, 'm sorry,  didn't know  had to make a reservation for that
Sorry
Anyway, we're all out here now and-- The next available appointment for bridesmaid fittings is in seven weeks and we don't take reservations over the intercom so you'll have to call
Seven weeks
'm sorry maybe you can't hear me
just said a few seconds ago that we do't have a reservation for the next seven weeks
() 40
(') And when you make your reservation do't forget you'll also need to make an appointment
What
(whispers) You didn't make an appointment
-- No,  can hear you
Would it be possible for you to make an exception for us because we drove all the way out here and didn't know about the reservation/ appointment thing so
Hold on
Annie, we can go somewhere else
No, no
'll work it out
Don't worry
This really is the best place though, that's the thing
Listen,  know the-- (intercom] Hello, this is the manager
Yes, hello
We can fit you in seven weeks, that is all we have available
We only take parties that have a reservation and that have made an appointment over the phone
'm going to ask you to not buzz in again
Thank you
Byyyyyyye
Helen approaches the intercom
41
Whitney
(irritated) Yes
Who is this
Whit, it's Helen
Helen
Hiiii
Hiiii
Hi
Hi
Listen, 'm out here with a whole bunch of girls and we had a little miscommunication and our reservation- appointment wasn't made
Is there any way to fit us in
Say no more
Buzzzzzzzz
The girls happily enter
(sotto} Wow, thanks Helen
a '
Whitney and Helen are leading the girls down the hall
Lillian and Annie tail the group
Ann, don't worry about it
We got in
Annie sees racks of wedding dresses
Hey, you want to sneak off and look at the wedding dresses
Oh my God
Annie,  didn't tell you
Guess who Helen is friends with
Lady Lavonia Jean St
Petsois JuJu
() 42
(') That famous wedding dress designer tha's in all those wedding magazines
As a favor to Helen she's going to design my dress for almost nothing
Normally they're like twenty grand
She's French
Wow
That's amazing
() have to send my measurements to France
Annie is a little disappointed
They all stand in a room stuffed bridesmaids dresses
Lillian's cell phone rings
Surprise, surprise
It's my Mom
Mom
Can you hold on a second
She covers the phone and talks to the girls
(') Start looking at dresses
'll be right back
think maybe you guys should decide anyway and pick out something you like since you're the ones wearing it
Cool
(nodding) Have fun
What's up Mom
Ugh
They're booked
Lillian leaves talking to her Mom
Ok ladies, start your (french) engines
Shots of dresses being pulled off of the racks
Fighting for the same dress, shirts coming off, dresses zipped up the back and dresses not fitting, etc
' Annie loves the dress she has on
She talks to herself in the mirror
Hi 'm Annie
Can  get a martini
What you mean you need to see
(giggling) 43
Annie, in the dress, is talking to the bartender
Well, with that dress on you look about
eleven
Thank you
Annie laughs
And turns away right into, a  male model in a tuxedo
Excuse me, you dropped an earring
An   appears, in his underwear
'll get it for her
No  will
'll get it
'm a lifeguard
Tons of men begin to yell and fight over her
The chaos forces Annie to make a   from the
She runs down the stairs like Cinderella into the forest
They men begin to chase her
She runs through the trees out of breath, she is face to face with a sexy, sweaty, lumberjack, wh's chopping wood
It's
Hi
Hi
'm Christian Bale
'm just chopping some wood,  like to do that between movies
Hello Christian
They hear the voices of the men from the party screaming for her
44
(') Oh, Christian
need a place to hide
Quick, get inside my muscles
They embrace
(') love this sash
They look into each others' eyes, just about to kiss and-- Hi Annie
'
Helen has flung open Annie's dressing room curtain, putting an abrupt end to her fantasy
She is wearing cream colored lingerie, showing off her amazing body
Annie is uncomfortable
Look at your cute little boobies
Ooh, is that the dress you like
Yeah
think it will look good on everybody, it has a sash-- sash
Annie, this isn't the Sound of Music tryouts
Huh
(
) told you Becca  can't wear strapless
(
) Why not
Annie and Helen come out to see all the bridesmaids arguing
Because, -- 45
Why don't you two shut your traps
No one's going to be looking at us
Le's just get the one with the shawl, 'm always freezing at these things anyway
gotta say 'm still leaning towards the one that  found
It is a very ugly
Absolutely not
Well, what about this one
Everybody stops and looks at Annie
(') think it would be flattering on everyone and we could totally wear it again
The sash comes in different colors not just this one
Everyone
We can't all have the dress that we want
've been in a lot of weddings and when choosing a bridesmaid dress, you must ask yourself, aIf invited, would  wear this a dress to
The
a Ooo,  never thought of it that way
All the girls agree
With that in mind,  say we wear this one
Helen holds up a dress
The girls like it
Or this one
People wear sashes to the Academy Awards all the time
Only if they're nominated for the Sound of Music
46
think Lillian would like this one
Well,  think Lillian would like one
Lillian walks in
Hey
'm hearing lots of excitement in here
She touches Helen's dress
(') Oooo,  like this one
What about you guys
love it
Right guys
The girls all agree
Except Annie
Cool
Let's eat
Helen dumps the dress in Annie's arms and follows Lillian
think it might look best in cream
Ooh, good idea
They exit
Well, that was easy
The girls head back to change
This dress is almost $500
/ That's not too bad/that sounds about right
No, that's what 'm saying
That's a great price
47
a  ' -
Andrea Bocceli music playing
Waiters in tuxes etc
The girls sit at a beautiful table looking at men's
This place is kind of amazing
did't even know it existed
The southwestern cobb is really good come here and eat sometimes
Great, there's a fly that really likes me
They only have salads
So Annie, what's your deal
Are you dating anyone
No, no
Not right now
had a boyfriend for three years but we broke up like six months ago
Oh,  hate to hear stuff like that
What happened
It just didn't work out
Is that the guy who stole a bunch of money from you and gave you an
Everyone freezes
(') Lillian told me
Annie shoots Lillian a look
'm sorry,  was just talking about you cause  was worried about you and-- 48
No it's fine
But he didn't steal the money,  loaned it to him
And  is really common right now
Everyone looks around
(') Around fifty percent of sexually active men and women acquire  at some point in their lives and by age fifty, eighty percent of women will be infected with a genital  infection
Really
About 6
2 million new cases of  affect Americans each year
Ew, it's on the butter you guys
The fly's on the butter
Well,  don't have it
Very few  infections show any signs or symptoms
Therefore a lot of infected people don't even know they have it, yet they transmit the virus to their sexual partner
Silent
Everyone is a little grossed out
(') Anyway, it's fine, the past is the past
We weren't meant to be
My last pap-smear came back normal so that's cule
But you know, 'm dating, here and there
Do you have anyone in mind to bring to the wedding
Oh,  didn't even think about that
Who needs a date
Just go stag and make out with someone there
49
If you wanna meet a nice man, Annie, you should come to karaoke night at my church
We sing hymns to rock beats
Wait
have the perfect guy for you Annie
Mike Donahue
He went to school with Kevin
Mike from the fourth of July last year
Ooh, 've seen him Ann
He's hot
Really
And Kevin said he just sold his company for an embarrassing amount of money
But he's totally down to earth
You guys have to meet
'm texting Kevin right now
know Mike too
Megan is digging a dead fly out of the butter
The fly just committed suicide
Death by butter
Oh my gosh, if you guys got married you could live out here and see us all the time
Yeah, and then pop out a couple kids, sit around and talk about nothing while your vagina flaps in the wind like a wet paper towel
(sotto) Oooh,  didn't know we were going to hear that word at lunch today
was set up with Ernie
As soon as  met him,  knew
Yeah Annie, you never know
50
Yes
Annie is lost in thought
She hears
Sirens
What
Come on
She pulls over
Officer Rhodes approaches
Well, look who it is
Oh hi
see your still driving around with busted tail lights
'm sorry, money's been tight and forgot(laughing)
You're not gonna give me another ticket for that are you
Nah
The reason  pulled you over today, is that--(searching) you were driving too slow
Backing up traffic

Yep
You were going ten miles under the speed limit
That's a moving violation
It's
underdriving
It's in the books
But, 'm just going to give you a warning this time, but  do have to um

He begins to write

51
Cayenne pepper water for three days now
It's supposed to clean you out, make you feel lighter
It's working
The only problem is  get so hungry

You ever crave that kind of stuff
Don't talk about cravings right now
am 'ing like crazy
It's taking everything in me not to stop and the store and get like three kit-kats and a bottle of wine
'm so irritable right now
They stare at each other out of awkwardness
(') Sorry
No, it's , 've got three sisters
We had tampons in the pencil drawer
Sometimes my friends and  would say they were cigars and smoke'em
(beat) Okay have finished writing down the things need to write, on this paper
He hands her a business card
(') This is a buddy of mine
Owns a body shop in Milwaukee
Might be able to help you out for a good price with those taillights
'll write my name on here so you can tell him who referred you
Thanks
That's my name right there
In case you forgot it from last time
It's Nathan Rhodes
Thanks
Annie
'll get those fixed get paid next week
Bye
She drives off
Rhodes wishes he had been more suave
52
'
Trust me, 've been in the jewelry business for a long time
Nothing says aI'm sorry for your loss' like a sterling silver money clip
An    looks at her stone-faced
(') We also have yo-yos you can engrave
In memory of
um, what's your friend's name
The old woman walks away as Sandy approaches
Paychecks
Here you go Annie
She and Sandy open their checks
(') Oh my God,  scored this week

It's cordless and has intercom
What about you Annie

Help me

Shoot,  can't talk now
'm with Helen and we have a conference call with Lady Lavonia Jean St
Petsois JuJu about my dress
Ugh
'm so sorry
She's calling

Steve walks in
53
That credit lady called you again

Listen, 'm going on a date
This
(holds up a dress) or this
(what she's wearing) don't like those pants
What's wrong with'em
They give you four corners
Annie's not following
(') It's when a girls butt looks like it has four corners
It's not a good thing
Shit
These are my only clean pants
Do you have a tube skirt
Thanks Steve
Wait
If you stand like you are right now facing that angle, it looks good
She looks in the mirror again, grabs her bag and leaves
Annie sits next to Mike Donahue
He is tall, dark and handsome
They have cocktails
'm not an expert in corporate real- estate but 've always been interested in it
So, yeah  totally agree
Mike smiles, he is cute
54
have to admit,  told Becca 'm not really keen on set-ups
know i's early, but so far so good
Me too
And thanks again for coming from Milwaukee,  know it's quite a drive
can do that drive in my sleep these days
Next time maybe 'll come to you
Annie smiles
(') You have got great teeth
Thank you

She flashes her teeth
The hostess comes up
Your tables ready
Finally
Mike guzzles down his cocktail as they read their menus
(') Well,  don't know about you but since we're at a Thai restaurant, 'm gonna try the dog
Mike laughs at his own joke and continues drinking
So, Becca tells me you play a lot of tennis

We should play sometime

Annie laughs, but is a little uncomfortable

Mike laughs
Annie is
Mike swigs from his drink
(') Seriously,  is crazy
You do't have it do you
No
(singing) Neither do
He raises his eyebrows up and down at her
Annie hasn't touched her food
He's eating with his hands and drunk
Other patrons are beginning to stare
56
() So  started to get a little chub, you know what that is
How could  not with those huge canteloupes waving in my face
Anyway,  looovee massages, am  right
As he's laughing he lets out a huge burp
(') (still laughing) Whoa-ho
Excyuuuuse me

Still laughing, he pats his pockets

Annie's car pulls up
Annie is on the phone, looking at the herbal drinks

Thanks for the drink
(beat) So are you one of those cops that sits in that same spot everyday and sneaks up on people
lot of people get up to high speeds on this road
tell people its better to pay for a ticket than have your family pay for a funeral
That's a very good point
Want a carrot
Yes
'm starving
: They are leaning on the back of his car eating carrots
(') Ew
What is this
Annie pulls out a very dry, warped discolored carrot
Oh, you got the ugly carrot
The what
58
There's one in every bag
You should eat it
No
think you should eat it
The're your carrots
He goes to eat it
She grabs it out of his hands
(') No, no
Don't eat it
She throws it on the ground
Don't litter
He picks it up
'
don't think 've ever wanted to get of out a restaurant faster in my life
Yeah,  don't go on blind dates
It seems unnatural
have no idea what am  going to tell my friends who set us up
Just tell her the truth
Yeah
You're probably right
Now Rhodes and Annie are driving in his police car
(') It's an ok job
It's commission, so it's unpredictable
don't know,  always wanted to finish my bachelor's but that's kind of financially impossible right now
Plus 'd feel like ninety around all those college students
59
You know my dad used to say that life is like a hallway of doors
You can stand at the same door forever if you want
Or you can open a different door
And that one may not be the right door, but i'll open up a whole new hallway of doors
Anyway, it worked for me
was kinda lost and opened a door and the next thing  knew was a cop
And  love my job
Hmm
think  get it
Or you can always sell moon-pies by the side of the road
Moonpies
What
It's a joke
You had moon-pies in your car the first time  pulled you over
Oh yeah
They are waiting in line
When  get married  don't want the kind of wedding people have these days
want it to be like a carnival
You know dunk tanks
People win prizes
Yeah, and you can have elephants, trapeze artists and a big scale to guess the bride's weight
Ok, first of all that's a circus wedding and 'm talking about a carnival wedding
60
Sorry
(to clerk) Yeah 'll have the number four, and can you make that Super Biggie
: They are sitting in the restaurant, mouths full of And then she moved to Hawaii and now lives with a guy who sells shaved ice
And supposedly she has really long armpit hair now
That's pretty much the last girlfriend  had
Well, lets just say my last boyfriend that  lived with broke up with me over the phone
Then come to find out, he had borrowed $30,000 in my name without telling me, putting me in horrible debt that 'm still paying off
Because can't find him
Wow
You win

Annie in her car, engine running
Oh my gosh
It's twelve thirty

Oh, before you go
There is something want to give you

He jokingly gives her the ugly carrot
For me
Well  know you've had a terrible night
He gives it to her
Her phone rings
61
Sorry, one sec
Hello
Ted
Hey
Oh my gosh
No,no
Can you hold on a sec
She waves at Rhodes and mouths
(') guess 'll see you around
Yeah
Don't forget about those taillights
They're really starting to bug me
Bye
(to Ted) So, you're in town
- '
He opens the front door, leading Annie out again
Next time  won't call so late
No, it was fine
Like  said,  mean was just driving
Awesome
It's cool that we can just hookup and whatever
No strings
Me too
love it
feel good right now
Cool
Bye
Annie pulls in, her tank is way passed empty
She looks in her purse frantically
Shit
No
No
left my fucking credit card at the restaurant
Shit
She picks up her phone and dials
62
(') Hi, Donna, it's Annie
Um, sorry but just ran out of gas and 'm gonna be a little bit late
Yes,  know, 'm really sorry
will get there as soon as can
promise, 'm so sor---hello
'
Annie comes running onto the floor putting her tie on
Annie, hi
almost left, but they said that you were coming and that you were late
Helen is standing there looking gorgeous
(') had to come into Milwaukee for a charity luncheon right down the street and  thought 'd come in and say hi
Hi
And as the leader of the bridesmaids, thought it'd be fun to pick up some little gifts for all the girls
Leader of the bridesmaids
Um, wouldn't that technically be me
Honor
Well, no, sweetie, you're the Maid of Honor, and we're all bridesmaids, and out of all of us, 'm the leader
Anyway, it doesn't matter
Um,  wanted to get something that we could wear to the rehearsal dinner or something
That would be fun
Where are the diamonds
Oh, well, what about a nice pen
or a tortoise-shell handled sterling silver letter opener
No
Ok, let me get Sandy
Oh
And Annie we really need to start planning the bachelorette
63
Yes
Yes
'm on it
Got some ideas
So 'll let you know
Can't wait
'
Annie arrives home from work frazzled to find Steve on the couch watching the same Home Improvement show
Wow, well  have never seen a transformation like this
This old tour bus is stunning
Thanks
Unbelievable
(to Annie) You got another package from your mom
Hey thanks for saving my butt today
Like said 'll pay you back as soon as can
She opens the package
And pulls out a red blazer
No problem
But you should always put gas in when it gets to a quarter tank
Especially cause you have such a shitty car
Thanks
Can  ask you a question
What do you think of Vegas
Ooo
Let me turn this off
Vegas is a black hole but  must have it in my life
Does that make sense
'm just asking because some of the girls are talking about going for Lillia's bachelorette party and 've never been
64
Oh no
Now  don't know about weddings
When you go on a bachelorette, does the bride pay
No, everyone pays for themselves
And you pay for the bride
Ok, 'm gonna say no
You cannot afford that
Vegas is not cheap
Airfare, hotels, food, cars, drinks, clubs, show tickets
Remember this morning
You cannot afford Vegas
Well,  could save up for it
No, you need to win a contest to go to Vegas/You had gum for lunch yesterday
Ooh, aNight Moves
a Can  have this
lightbulb goes off in Annie's head
Steve holds the blazer out and reads the tag
Told you 'd pay you back
Annie runs into her room
She sits down at the computer and begins typing feverishly
We see these words: aDear bridal partya, agreat ideaa, abachelorette partya, aFloridaa, aSea World
a, aFree place to stay
a
She presses send, and is very pleased
The phone immediately rings
(') Hello
Hi
Hi
Hiiiii
65
Hi Helen
Helen is dressed in cream under a cream blanket
All around her is a ridiculous amount of white glowing candles
There are too many flames
just got your e-mail
Um
Sea World
Well it's not just Sea World
It's a weekend in Florida
See, when Lillian and were kids we went there and she loved it and has always talked about going back
Ask Dougie
think it would really mean a lot to her
We could stay at my Dad's house, he won't even be there
Then we could go out at night and got to the beach and then Sea World on one of the days
But a bachelorette at Sea World
Like  said, Sea World would just be a part of it
Well,  have been talking to the other girls, and  was thinking we should go to Las Vegas
Annie's other line rings
Oh, can you hold on
That's my other line
She clicks over
(') Hello
Hi, Annie
It's Becca
Becca, in her shabby-chic home office paints a front porch sign that says aThe Whitman'sa 66
(') was just looking at your e-mail, yo're so cute
Sea World
What about Turkey
That's where we went for for bachelorette
Oh well, Turkey's really far away
It's super old though
They have awesome restaurants
It's very exotic
Have you ever seen Aladdin
It totally looks like that
Hang on
Annie clicks back over to Helen
(') Helen, 'm sorry can  call you back
When
Just a few minutes
'll call you back
Annie clicks over
(') Becca
Hi
You know, if you wanna go some place closer than Turkey
Helen  e-mailed me about going to Vegas
Oh,  don't know
Everybody always goes to Vegas
It seems just cliche to me
never get sick of it
love blackjack
have a system
Annie's other line
Oh, my other line's ringing
Can  call you back
67
When
Soon
Annie clicks over
(') Hello
Annie, it's Dana
Of course it is
Dana is on her porch swing drinking lemonade
love your idea about Sea World
Really
Yeah, but then Helen just called me and said we should go to Vegas
But Vegas is so hot, don't you think
It's like, hot and dry
People get sick there all the time
haven't had that experience
My skin always clears up there
Yeah,  just think it's probably not-- Hold on
(clicks over) Hello
Annie, it's Megan
Megan is at work, in front of a wall of computer and television screens
It is a technical haven, looks like 68
(') can't talk right now, but  was thinking for the bachelorette, something more along the lines of a personal challenge weekend
Have you ever heard of the Nevada Project
(defeated) No
Leslie in her Sopranos style living room on a treadmill
Her kids run around
gotta be honest
've been married for nine years, this may be the last bachelorette party of my career and want the sweaty nuggets of a gay man pounding me in the face at some point during this trip
'll pay whatever have to pay
(to the kids) Tyler stop it, put that back
Paul
: Vegas has these party busses that have flat screens in them and dance floors-- Or we could take hummer limos around everywhere
That sounds really expensive
Oh but it's gonna be so much fun
Besides money shouldn't be a problem if Lillian's our friend
Oh no, no,  was just thinking about everyone else
That's all 'm saying
What 'm saying is, they drop you off in the middle of the desert
You have to kill your own food and find your way back
Not everyone makes it
Seriously
69
Seriously
want balls in my face
So  think Vegas is a good idea
agree with Helen
Vegas
Oh, you know what else is in Nevada
Vegas
Balls
Vegas
Vegas it is
(on the phone) Holy Shit Annie
We're goin' to Vegas
-
(eating a cookie) No can do,  need all my shifts
'm trying to save up and take my lady to Maui
Please, one day a week, just for a little while
've already asked everybody else
really need the money
Sorry
My hands are tied
Sharita's got my dick in a chip-clip
That's alright
understand
Mmm
Mm
These are the best peanut butter titties you ever made
They're called peanut butter kisses
That's not what they look like
70
The bridesmaids sit in first class
In the distance, Annie's head pops up from her seat in row 3O of coach
The girls wait by the curb with their luggage
Megan appears next to Annie
Here we are
The city of lust
Annie, do you know how many men are looking for trouble in this town right now
We are gonna nail it down
We should tell everybody we're twins cause guys looking up with twins
Yeah, 've heard that
Ok everybody
You guys, hey we're here, we're in Vegas
Woo
Lillian walks up
Annie, come here
Why didn't you tell me you weren't sitting with us
Oh, it's no big deal
didn't want to blow all my money on a first class ticket
'm here though, right
'm so excited
Ok, you guys, gather around
Welcome to Lillian's bachelorette party
We should probably get a bunch of cabs and head to our beautiful hotel, The New Marquis Royal Suites
As Annie's talking, a limo pulls up behind her
aThe New Marquis Royal Suites
a Lillian, look what's happening
71
Oh my God
You guys, is this for us
got a limo from the hotel
We're in Vegas
Yaaaay
They all pile into the limo, excitedly talking
Ok, everyone just get in the car
Got a ride to the hotel
It's taken care of
(from inside the limo) Sit by me, Annie
The girls' excited talking continues into the lobby
This hotel is amazing
You guys
Come on Lillian, you're staying with me in the master suite
It's all set
Oh
Okay
Then party in room 812 in one hour
(waving her key) Girls get off the elevator, giddy with excitement
Annie gets back into the elevator
Uh
Shoot
left my sunglasses downstairs
Ugh
Where's my head
Annie sneaks out, rolling her bag
She catches a cab
Cab pulls up to a tiny broken down building
sign reads aHotel Rick
Vacancy
Some
s
a An old man rides a bicycle in circles in the parking lot, smiling
72
-
Lobby is very outdated
Wood panel walls etc
, The hotel brochure is on the desk
It is probably the picture she saw online, it does  look the same
The clerk enters
Hi,  have a reservation for Walker
, an East Indian man, stands behind the desk in front of a large portrait of himself, posed exactly as he is now, with the same outfit
He holds the pose, smiling
Okay, two nights
Yes
Rick waits for her to notice the painting, but she never does
Do you want towels
Yes
Do you need sheets
Yes
No pillow though, ok
Annie just stares at him
The door opens to reveal a gorgeous huge feminine suite
(gasp)
' Annie opens her door holding unfolded sheets and towels
The room is very ugly, bare mattress, lots of brown
73
Oh my God
Megan and Leslie stand in their grande bathroom
Hot tub, plush towels, flat screen
Candles burning
Oh my gosh,  can't believe this
He-llo Vegas
' There's an old toothbrush and comb by the dirty sink, a pair of athletic socks hanging over the shower rod where a curtain should be
There is a cat staring at her
Hello cat
Dana and Becca open their curtains revealing a spectacular view
They scream and jump up and down
Annie opens up her curtains to a back lot
Something is on fire
Rick tries to put it out
The old man rides by
(screams in shock) Annie stands outside room 312
She is dressed more preppy than she's ever looked
She knocks on the door
Becca opens it
We see disco lights and hear rap music
There are shirtless male waiters, penis balloons and a slide show of naked men
The room looks like a sex club
The girls are dressed like borderline prostitutes
Oooh, Annie's here
74
Wooooooh
Isn't this amazing
Lillian runs over and hugs Annie, wearing a condom veil and drinking out of a penis straw
Annie
wanna see a drink in your hand in one minute
Lillian pulls Annie into the room
Helen is getting off of the phone
Ok you guys, change of plans
The Velour Cobra had an opening at 9 so  got us a dinner reservation
Isn't that radical
Woohooo/Ooooh/Alright
Oh
Yeah
Cool
Alright Everyone raises their glasses
The night has begun
- Annie is concentrating on the bill
Okay, mine was
great, got it
Becca scoots in next to her
Annie,  didn't get a chance to ask you, how was your date with Mike
Give me all the details
Oh, um, we had dinner
Do you think you'll go out with him again
He told Kevin he thought you were really great and hot
75
(from her end of the table) Hey wha's the damage down there
Oh,  got it right here,  figured out what  owe so, should  just pass it around
( ) Why don't we just all split it
It's so much easier
,,, Yeah/Just split it/Who cares
Yeah, it's probably just easier
just split it
Here, let me see it
Ok
It's a hundred each plus tip
(sotto)  had soup and ice water
Plus we're paying for Lillian
everyone just put $125
(sotto) No alcohol
or any real food
It'll all even out by the end of the night
How does it even out
How does that happen
Everyone, including Annie, puts in their money
Helen moves over to Annie
Thank you everybody
Annie, don't tell Lillian, it's a surprise
() 76
(') My friend Sean Michael works for a promotional company and they're having this big event tonight at Tara Rei's stepbrother's Club, Sacrifice
Really
think it should be our first stop
's reserving seats for us in the section
It's a $150 cover and there's a one bottle champagne minimum of $750 per table, he said people from the Real World go in there all the time

We are
After that
Oh

Lillian comes up already a little tipsy
Ok, Leslie spilled the beans
Le's get our asses over to Sacrifice
What are we waiting for

Lillian looks at Helen's legs
(') Whoa whoa
Helen, turn around
Are those those Ransom Jeans
77
Don't tell Perry  bought them, ordered them from New York
They're insanely expensive
But  gotta tell you guys the compliments  get on my ass make them worth every penny
She sticks her butt out
Lillian slaps it and all the girls laugh
She is the life of the party
party bus pulls up
As the doors open, dry ice pours out
Inside there's a disco ball, dance poles, crazy lights
The girls all scream and run onto the bus
With the commotion, no one notices that Annie stays behind
Annie enters casino alone, sadly weaves through the slot machines
aMy Prerogativea by Bobby Brown comes on   making conversation difficult
Lillian looks around for Annie
Oh my God, Annie our song
Wher's Annie
What
Where's Annie

Annie passes four fun college age party guys at a craps table
No, no, no wait

She continues to roll all fours
The guys scream
The guys are carrying Annie on their shoulders, cheering for her
She is laughing

Everyone eats huge burgers including the driver (not Annie, she is annoyed
) You guys almost done
2 Sorry we haven't eaten all day

Loud music
Lillian tries to call Annie back
Annie tries to call Lillian back
They both get voice-mails
Annie gives up
It starts pouring rain on her inside the club
Everyone jumps up and screams with excitement
Thunder
Me Tarzan, you Jane
It's time for the dance spotlight
If it lands on you, you gotta shake it
The spotlight immediately lands on a soaking wet Annie
She dances very angrily
Jungle dancers dance very close to her and put vines around her neck
Annie walks in
Yeah, she's back/ the Roller
/ Yeah
What happened to you

Roller,  can't stand seeing you like this
(to bartender] Get this fine lady a shot

That's what 'm saying
Some people have everything and others have just little bits of things
It's not fair
don't get it

hate Helen
That is the sexiest think anyon's ever said
'
In the dark, Annie and Dave are passionately making out
Knocking things over, etc
hate Helen
' The cat jumps on the bed and meows
Annie opens her eyes to see Dave sleeping
She notices his college tattoo on his arm (tasmanian devil with a lacrosse stick
)
Hey
Hi
Sorry  fell asleep while we were making out
guess  was pretty tired
Its ok
Sorry  gave you a hickey
Oh shit
There's a knock at the door
Annie opens it to reveal , (20), pretty and sweet

Brian 1, Brian 2 and Mark appear in the doorway as well
1 Dude, 'm sorry

Ok, that is not nice
And what are you forty
No, 'm in my low thirties
(under her breath) and you could never kick my ass
What did you say
(timid) You heard me
Annie immediately gets punched in the face
Annie is shocked and swings back, hitting Nicole in the face
She's proud of herself
Nicole's two friends enter and jump on Annie
Annie is outside of the hotel
Guys are pulling the girls off of Annie
Baker Community College bitch
86
The girls leave in victory
Dave turns and mouths to Annie aI'm sorry
a '
She frantically tries to cover up her  hickey and evidence of the fight, with make-up
She remembers a small cowboy print tablecloth from the other room and wraps it around her neck like a scarf
All the girls are hung over and eating
Annie arrives
Annie
Whoa
What are you, going to a rodeo
That's hilarious
Annie, you missed it
scammed all night last night
met this guy named Darwin
He works for Cingular
He had a friend
What happened to your face
Yeah, why are you wearing all that makeup
It's covering up bruises, cuts and a hickey

What
Forget it
87
was trying to find

Well, -(to Lil} Can  talk to you for a minute
Annie takes Lillian away
What is going on
You told Helen you were sick

Helen told you that because
couldn't afford to go with you guys
Why didn't you say something
-- (
) Lillian, we're going to be late for our honey facials
Helen, can you just give us a minute
'm just saying, we're gonna be late don't wanna be rude
That's funny
You know what
As the Maid of honor, which is what  am and what you are not,  am asking you to just give us a minute
Excuse me Annie
No, excuse me
Annie take it easy

88
Annie, if it makes you feel any better (getting emotional]  got slapped last night
Here we go
By this huge girl
She was a working in the bathroom
just
didn't cut in line

She chased me
Becca it's over
Annie, she looked like Popeye
She lives here
She lives in Vegas
You're not going to run into her
Just shut-up about it
Guys stop
Please
Annie, 'm so sorry about last night

Tonight, you're not leaving my side
We're hittin' the strip club all of us and we're going to put this shit behind us
Okay
The girls agree
Dana rubs her arm
Oh your arm does not still hurt
Bridesmaids window shop
Something in a fancy boutique catches Annie's eye, she smiles
Ransom jeans
The ladies sit at the front row tables
What can  get you ladies
89
First of all , we're gonna need some ones over here
Here's a hundred
Keep twenty for yourself
Oooh, Ann
siren goes off
Good evening ladies, and welcome to Thunderbird
Our first male entertainer has been roaming the prairie for many, many lonely nights
horse winnies
Ladies scream
(') Here he is
looking for a sweet lady to keep him company under the stars
say hello to Cowboy Ron
male stripper comes out on a cardboard horse, humping ' looking for someone
The room goes wild
(') There he is ladies looking for that special woman, looking for his briiide
And  believe the person he's looking for is Lillian Donovan
The girls scream
Lillian mouths to Annie aI'm gonna kill you
a Cowboy Ron takes her up on stage
He puts her in a chair and humps her face
Everyone is cracking up
Leslie, your missing it
Don't talk to me
Nobody talk to me
Leslie has her hands on the bare ass of a stripper who is dancing in her face
Stripper #2 appears
Wow, looks like Cowboy Ron has a friend on the prairie and he's lookin' for a lady too
90
(pointing to Annie) Get her
Get her
Stripper #2 pulls Annie up to the stage, lays her on the ground and simulates sex with her
Standing above her, pulls his chaps off
We see that his balls are not all the way tucked into his g-string
The girls cringe
As he stands above her, in slow motion, we see a bead of sweat leave his balls and fly into Anni's open laughing mouth
She dry heaves
The stripper is oblivious, goes to another girl
Lillian and Annie roll around on the ground laughing
Everyone's laughing as they exit the club
need some gum
That was disgusting
'm so glad 'm married
It was awesome
got a picture of the balls
got it
(puts her arm around Annie)
You lucky bitch
Only you Annie
Hands down, best moment of the weekend
Annie finally feels a part of the group
Annie walks to first class, everyon's sleeping
She hears Lillian laughing really hard, pointing at pictures in a magazine
91
Oh look, there's your boyfriend
Ew, he's like 65
Ok, look Lillian that's you
Oh my God
You know who that actually looks like
Remember when we went to Miami and we had to rent towels-- Ew, at that beach, that weird beach
And that lady came up to us wearing that mesh top
She was crazy
Annie sinks
flight attendant appears
Excuse me
Hi
Hi
'm sorry, you can't be up here
You have to go back to coach
was just stretching my legs
That's not true
Annie stares at her
The flight attendant holds out her hand for Annie to grab
(') Come on
it's ok, c'mon
'mon
- Ok, that's going to be seventy -five dollars
92
What
Twenty-five dollars a day
Three days
Seventy -five dollars
thought it was seven
Oh, hmm mm
That's for this lot, you parked in this lot
The lots are exactly the same, separated by a white line
Annie empties her wallet, her poker winnings are gone
- Annie is driving
She sees Rhodes, and stops
Oh,  know what's going on
You're jealous of that Helen girl
Excuse me
No, 'm not
If you say so
'm telling you  am not jealous of Helen, okay
She's tall and thin and rich and pretty
They both laugh
Oh come on, you know you got it goin' on
Oh yeah,  got it goin' on
You're right, you don't
93
(laughing) Thanks a lot
They nudge each other
He accidentally nudges her off the car
Sorry
Now Annie is back in her running car
Have a good rest of your shift
Actually, 'm heading home
Got my sister staying with me for a few days
Sh's been thinking of divorcing of her husband
Oh
Sorry
He had an affair and they've got kids so it's complicated
Hmm
Sounds familiar
My sister is a hell of a woman, you know
And her husband is- you know what  think cheating is
It's weak
It's a weak person that cheats
Something clicks with Annie, she sees him in a new light
No, no
Um,  feel the same way
Um, anyway um, maybe 'll drive by you next week
have to make this drive again
so
She tries to flirt a little, pulls her hair back
He sees her hickey
She starts itching her arm, still flirting and laughing
(') Ugh, great,  think  was allergic to the soap at the hotel
Ahhhhh
94
Yeah
should go
now
Don't forget to call my friend about those tail lights
They're really starting to bug me
promise
Ok, well, have a good weekend
You too
He abruptly walks back to his car
She drives away confused
'
Annie arrives home to another amoma package
She pulls out some cheap cosmetics
She pulls out a bottle of White Diamonds perfume by Elizabeth Taylor, low calorie mints, some pepper spray, a book titled a100 Survival tips For the Independent Woman
a  check for $25
She opens the book, sees chapters entitled aYou Don't Have to Work for  to Change a Tire
a a How to Jack a CarJacker
a aAnyone with Arms Can Skin a Deera etc
She tries to read but the itching is driving her crazy
' Annie's on the table while the  examines her skin
Well, 've got good news for you
You're going to live
Hahahah
It's not an allergic reaction though
Oh, that's good
You've got body lice
Oh
Have you recently come in contact with or slept anywhere that you think you might -- 95
know where  got it
You're gonna have to wash every fabric in your apartment and 'll give you a topical cream that should knock it out pretty quick
've got some samples
- ' Annie sits on the doorstep
Lillian runs up with a bunch of stuff in her arms and opens the door
They enter the apartment
'm so sorry
was at our travel agen's trying to figure out how to get my da's family out here, they all have to fly at different times, uggh
What's that on your arms
She sees some of Annie's lice medicine motion
Huh
Oh
did a face mask
must have gotten some on me and didn't rinse it
Oh shit, 'm sorry,  have to check one thing really quick
When is my hair consultation
Lillian frantically looks through her calender
Listen,  want to talk to you about-- Oh no
(starts to cry) What's wrong
knew it
'm going to have my period on my wedding day
and my honeymoon
It's ok
mean it's not like it's your first time doing it
96
It's our wedding night though
You can still have sex, just put a towel down in the bed
can't believe this
This sucks
(beat) Oh, Annie  wanted to ask you
Do you think for the cocktail party before the reception we should have a string trio or a horn trio
' Can you just realize what you just asked me right now
What
You just said a string trio or horn trio
thought you didn't want anything fancy, you know, just akeep it simple
a aNot a big deal
a know but now that 'm planning everything it's just
wanna do it right
It's once in a life time
It's my wedding
Lillian's phone rings
(') Ugh
It's Dougie's Mom
She's mad at me because  won't let her invite everyone from her work
Oh
That reminds me
If you're not going to bring anybody, will you let me know
gotta free up some spots
(into phone] Hello
Lillian walks away with the phone
Annie is speechless
'
Dryer is going
Annie is sorting a huge pile of sheets, towels, etc
Her cell phone rings
Helen
97
' Annie
Where are you
Inside a truck
No, 'm doing laundry, what's up
Annie, the shower needs to happen soon
We haven't heard from you and everyone is- know
know
'm trying to-- Annie can  dialog openly with you know you're having some financial trouble and  think it would be best if  did the shower
Now before you say anything, let me say that showers can be very expensive and  think what's important here is what's best for Lillian
Wow
You don't have to give me an answer now -- You should have it
You should have it
Great
Well, 'll definitely need some help
Ok
Could you bring the cookies
Annie hangs up, looks at her laundry piles
Pissed
Annie behind her counter
98
Excuse me
snotty thirteen year old, valley-type, rich girl stands at Annie's counter with an iced coffee chewing gum
(') 'm looking for a birthday gift for my best friend
Your best friend
Yeah
For now
(sip] What do you mean
Well, what's gonna happen when you get older
Did you ever think of that
What about when she makes new friends and they're more successful than you are
Girl stares annoyingly, chewing and sipping
(') Huh
And they buy her facials and designer dresses for cheap and yo're stuck selling jewelry to teenagers wh's outfit cost more than your rent
Ummm
you're weird
You're stupid
You have no chin
You're gonna be a slut in high school
You are an old, single loser who has no friends, works in a jewelry store, colors her own hair, and will never know the feeling of owning a luxury car
99
She sips in victory, slurps up the last drop noisily
(quietly] You
Little
Cunt
The girls eyes widen
The camera pans to show that the girl's dad and Donna have been there the whole time
' Donna stands across from Annie wh's cleaning out her locker
She sadly starts to leave
Bye
You know,  knew a girl once
Karen Stippleton
She was really something
The life of the party, a concert pianist, she had naturally curly hair, and skin black as night
But one evening at a dinner party  walked in on her in the bathroom putting a vile of cocaine up her buttocks and last  heard, she was playing the saxophone outside of a drug store
And 'm gonna say something to you  should have told her
Don't waste your life
Find out what your gifts are and use them
Donna hugs Annie, then leaves her in the break room
'
Annie arrives completely depressed
Outside her doorstep is yet another package
Annie takes it inside
'
Ooh, another package from your mom
Yep
It is a beautiful pink and white striped box with her name and address in calligraphy
When Annie opens the lid, aCanon in Da plays and a real butterfly flies out
100
She reads, aA Shower for Lillian
a Steve comes over to see
On one side of the box, there is a beautiful sculpture of Lillian and Dougie as Bride and Groom, a candle with Lillian's face printed on it and some chocolates
Annie takes the invitation out, opens it quickly

To hear a twenty-four hour wedding music mix, press 8, put your phone on speaker, light the Atmospheria candle you've just received and think about the eternal union that is marriage
'm Helen Harris , and this is me saying au revoir
But before  do, here's a message from
101
(
) Hello, 'm Susan Sarandon, the movie star
just wanted to say congratulations to Lillian and Dougie
Even though  don't believe in marriage, do abelieve in the church of basebala
Just kidding
That's a line from my movie Bull Durham
- Annie hangs up quickly
'
Annie's relaxation  is playing as she lies talking on the phone to her Mom, who is painting a very life-like picture of Enrique Iglesias in concert
Is there an animal over there
No, it's a
She rolls over and turns it off
So, 'm flying straight to 'Hare the day of the shower cause  wanna get my hair done
Did you see that invitation didn't get the significance of the dead butterfly, but it looks like w're gonna have fun
'm not
Oh, c'mon
already know what it's gonna be like
It's gonna be uncomfortable and weird don't wanna go
Sweetie, listen to yourself
You ca't let her new friends get in the way of your being a part of one of the best days of Lil's life
way
You have a history with her that no one else has
So you walk into that party knowing that
102
'
Annie drives to Helen's
She sees a pink and white highway sign (that looks like a traditional highway exit sign) aLillian's Shower Rue
This exita Oh my God
She turns into the gates of aWhitewater Estates
a There is, a life-size sculpture of a bride and groom
As she gets closer, she sees they are real life models
They smile at Annie, wink at her and wave her by
At the next stop sign, a butler appears with a tray
Are you a guest of Helen Harris
Yes
The shower is one mile away
He hands her a pink lemonade
don't have a cup-holder
As she's driving, little pink things start to fly beside her car
(') - One flies in her car
They're Rose petals
Annie's shitty car drives down a road covered with Rose petals
At the driveway, she is greeted by a valet in a pink bow-tie and beret
As she reaches for her gift from the passenger seat, another valet opens that door and take it
This will be placed in the gift room for you madame
He reaches for the cookies she made, and she stops him
'll take those
103
Annie watches the valet drives her car away
When she turns back around, there is a man with a white horse holding out his hand to her
Would you like an assisted ride to the main house
Do  have to
An annoyed Annie arrives at the house on the horse with the man leading her on foot, holding the cookies
She dismounts
The front door is swung open by two attendants
As she enters the mansion, groups of girls pass by her
This is the most amazing shower 've ever been to/Can you believe this
/What a lucky bride/What a good friend
Helen's house is  cream and white with gold
Couches are puffy, etc
Annie walks to the backyard
We hear French standards
Beautiful tables are set
Swans and bunnies milling about
Attendants ready to serve
In the middle of everything stands an eight foot tall round asigna that says aLillian and Dougiea in puffy pink cursive
waiter offers Annie champagne
She takes it
(
) Annie
They walk to her
Do you believe this shit
Annie is still staring at the sign
That's a big cookie huh
Where
They point to the asigna
Annie walks closer to see it is indeed a huge cookie
See
Sugar cookie
104
Leslie takes a piece off, eats it
(') It's even better if you dip it in the chocolate
a glorious four tiered chocolate fountain
Girls are around it dipping strawberries and pieces of the big cookie, laughing
Helen is there taking their praise
Annie is pissed and plops her tupperware of cookies on a nearby table
Annieee
Lillian runs to her
(') (under her breath) Can you believe this
(
) Lillian
Coming Mom
gotta go say hi to my aunts
She leaves and Helen appears out of nowhere again
Hi Annie
Beautiful party
Oh, it's nothing
so
Just make yourself at home
Enjoy
Thanks
(under her breath) Asshole
What did you say
said  love this shower, and i's amazing

Annie leaves
Two hip hop dancers wearing pink berets approach Helen and jam out in her face
105
, not me,
The
Hip hop dance with the

- Annie puts lotion her hands
She sees a magazine photo of ' face super imposed over them
On the counter is a framed photo of Helen, soft lit, posed with her hand gently ' face
She also sees a photo of Helen and Lillian from Vegas on the plane
Happy
As Annie leaves, she runs into her Mom, wh's new hairstyle is a bit overdone
Mom
Hi
They hug
(') Wow
You look great
Thank you sweetheart
(to herself)  wish Barb could see me now
Not today Mom
You're right
Well 'm happy to see you

Mom goes into the bathroom
Megan approaches
Annie, did you see the party favors
'm sure they're perfect and amazing
They're dogs
106
What
Yeah
And they're wrapped up like presents
They said we have to wait until we leave but  cant stop thinking about them
gotta go tell Lillian
- '  - Annie now stands next to the chocolate fountain
She looks around, drops her glass in it and unplugs it with her foot
It stops flowing
She looks around and throws some leaves in it and walks away
' attention by microphone
Hello ladies
Bonjour
(french sentence)Yay
Welcome
am your host Helen, a bridesmaid in Lillian's wedding
want you all to have a wonderful time
Eat, drink, please have some cookie
She laughs and then becomes very serious
(') Lillian
Today's your day
'd like to make a beautiful toast, aYou are pretty, fun, sweet, look at all of your friends
Girlpower
a Everyone enjoy your lunch, served along with the musical stylings of
The '
quartet, all in pink and white and harmonize
a Lillian, Lillian, Lillian, Lillian
When Lillian was a little girl
a Judy claps and enjoys the music
She leans over to Annie
don't know what's going on honey
The shower is a hit
107
'
Everyone sits surrounded by decorations, pictures of Dougie and Lillian as babies, flowers, fire in the fireplace
Everyone it's game time
Please take your piece of paper, put it on top of your head, and with your other hand try to draw what Lillian and Dougie's first baby is going to look like
Ready
Everyone draws, giggles, looks at their stupid drawings, laughing
Annie cheats and draws it on her lap
: (') And the winner is
Annie
Dana holds up a perfectly realistic drawing of a baby
Yeah, that's mine
Thank you

Annie looks confused
They throw Ellie onto a huge pile of pillows
This is a terrible game
(') Find the veil
'mon Ellie
Come on Look
You can do it
It's right there
Ellie feels around in the huge pile of pillows
She finds the veil, holds it up in victory and then falls down from dizziness
(') WoooHoo
: 108
#9
What is Lillian's favorite ice cream flavor
Write it down
quickly
(under her breath, to the woman next to her) Ew
Kinda smells funny in here
Doesn't it
Smells bad
This house has a weird smell
, last one
For the big prize
#10
What is the craziest place Lillian and Dougie
Helen strongly hints with a weird smile instead of saying, a
had sex
a Shower Girls Ooooh and Ahhhh
(under her breath) Wow, looks like someone's a pervert
It's none of my business
She's gross
: 1 (very emotional) 'm putting a blue bead on this aadvice necklacea to represent the ocean
It may not always be smooth sailing but you can ride the waves together
Dana cries and takes a picture
Everyone applauds, (to person near her) The ocean's are really polluted right now
Its not something to joke about
-'   - Lillian opens presents in front of huge photograph of herself
Oh
My towels
Thank you Dana
just wanted to get you something you could use everyday and something pretty
Dana takes a picture, Lillian grabs another box, giddy
109
Annie
(opens it) Oh, our mugs
Thank you Annie
Well, you registered for 'em so thank yourself, you picked them out
did't do anything
This one's from me
Helen hands Lillian her gift
Lil opens it and holds up beautiful lingerie
Oooo/Ahhhhh etc
Ooh, brothel gear
(sotto] It's disgusting
Here Mom's here
Wait, what's this
Lillian pulls out an envelope
(sotto) Wow, cash
Kinda tacky
Lillian opens the envelope
Oh my God
Helen
Lillian holds up the tickets
Honey what are they
Two first class tickets to Sea World
How did you-- Are you fucking kidding me
Annie
110
Annie
What is going on with you
Nothing have fun at Sea World
Why don't we go in the other room and-- Shut up you ridiculous person, you a sneaky little cream and white cashmere--
Annie
Everyone  am so sorry,  really don't know what you mean
think you do
(laughs) Horses
Sculptures
Posters
Look at this stupid house
This stupid marshmallow puffy furniture
(pointing outside) And look at that cookie
Would you please everyone
Speaking of that cookie
never got a piece
Annie marches into the back yard
(') (shouting, we see her through the large ) Did you honestly think 30 women were gonna finish this
You know what
'll help you out
She tries to take down the cookie and struggles with it
We watch her from the house
Fall over with the cookie, she runs over to the chocolate fountain and tries to tip it over, it's obviously too heavy
She tries to empty it with her hands onto the ground
(') Mmmmm
Nothing says friendship like a thousand gallons of hot unsanitary chocolate
Hello swan, are you having fun
Did you enjoy the hip-hop dancers
111
Everyone is watching Annie
She is fighting and punching the air like a crazy person, chasing a swan
little girl starts crying
Annie walks back through the house, through the crowd holding her chocolate covered hands in the air
(') actually thought  wanted to be like you
and you and , to be a part of this world
That's not who  am
make bad choices
'm broke,  lost my stupid job, 'm thirty two years old and  still answer booty calls
don't like Mike Donahue cause he () on our date
have a single black hair that grows out of my chin and  can't wear white t-shirts cause something about my sweat turns the pits yellow
you know when we were in Vegas
When you were all staying at your luxury hotel
was staying at Hotel where got
So Helen, you can have the coveted Maid of Honor title
You can have it all wrapped up in a big pink obnoxious musical box
Because all its brought me is a big pain in my ass
Congratulations
Annie leaves and Lillian runs after her
Annie stop
don't know what's going on
Well let me fill you in
Ever since you got engaged, my life has turned to shit
'm sorry the the happiest time in my life has brought you so much misery
Do you know how selfish that sounds
'm selfish
You're the one that's been so wrapped up in all this
Designer dressed, extravagant hotels, this shower, this is not you
This is my wedding and you've made it all about you
112
Well at least my friendship's not for sale
This hangs in the air
Annie storms off
Lillian storms back inside
Do you think she still has body lice
Anyone else
Anyone else have something they wanna say to me
Dana can't contain herself
got my chin done
Becca stands up
Kevin smokes pot
Leslie stands up
'm pregnant
Megan stands up
took two dogs already
There in the back of my van
'
-
Annie is pissed
She sees a squirrel in the road (close up of squirrels big eyes)
She tries to avoid it, slams on her breaks and
Annie is rear-ended
The driver behind her backs up, peels out and drives away
Thank you
Her car won't start
Trying to keep it together, she grabs her running shoes from the back seat and storms down the highway, trying not to cry
cop car pulls next to her
's Rhodes
: 113
Rhodes is looking under her hood
Well,  can't say 'm surprised
Yes
Taillights
know
You should've taken it to my friend- Yes, you're friend
But  didn't ok
didn't get them fixed
don't-- Whoa
Don't take it out on me
This is your fault
hit
You had no taillights
You did't get them fixed
You don't get to blame anyoe else
It's your fault
Annie starts to walk away
(') Where you going
Annie keeps walking
(') Oh, you're going to walk fifteen miles
Another  decision
( ) What do you know
know that you not taking responsibility is why we're standing out here
did not make an effort to fix that problem
This hits Annie
Rhodes is physically worked up
114
(') , ' Why are you yelling at me
It's dangerous
You're putting your life, and others in danger
'm
Sorry
He calms down
Look, all  know, is that you're kinda crazy
You're always stressed out or late, complaining about something, and now you're yelling at me
And for some reason, all 've ever wanted to do is ask you on a date
Well save yourself the trouble, and don't
Yeah, 'm not much of a hickey guy anyway
Annie remembers her hickey
He saw it
Well,  have said anoa anyway
Well, then you have yourself a good night ma'am
Annie regrets that
He drives away leaving her there
She is alone
'
Annie's car gets towed into the shop
115
-  ' enters with a clip board
He is a stocky Milwaukee good guy
Rhodes told me a while back you might be stopping in
'm Bill Cozbi
Oh, hi
was beginning to think we'd never see ya
Yeah,  know
'm irresponsible
Nah, no one likes taking care of that stuff
But you are going to have to leave your car here for a week or so
week
'
So you kind of had a bad time at the wedding shower
Yes  did
Everything's just
She starts crying
Steve hands her a tissue from the middle console
(') 'm sorry,  just--this has been a really shitty day
Yeah
Ok, don't get mad at me, but it seems like you have a lot of those
Yes  do
Right
Thank you
116
Have you considered the idea that maybe, possibly, perhaps, it's you that makes them shitty
Annie stares at him
(') 'm just saying, maybe it's your attitude
This is not about attitude
It's just the facts
My life hasn't turned it out the way  expected
don't have any of those things that gives a person points in the world
think that might be your problem think you read too many of those magazines
You don't need things to be someone
Tyra said that
Tyra Banks
'
Annie sits on the couch with Steve in a daze, watching ' Lillian
She doesn't even know what to say, so she doesn't answer
: ' Annie reads a shitty magazine at the counter
She turns to see the gray-haired, outdoorsy  that she and Lillian pointed out
Is anyone sitting here
No
The lady sits next to Annie and smiles at her
: 117
Annie looks in the classifieds
lot say acollege degree required
a She looks up and sees  has walked in
Hey Annie
Oh, hey Ted
You're in town
Yeah, yeah
Listen 'm going out tonight but  should be home around 11, you wanna come over
Really
Ok, sure
Ted smiles at her
Annie stops herself
(') Wait no
No
No
don't think  do
Because answering your booty calls and having you kick me out after a night of no-strings-attached sex doesn't feel good
girls feel good after that and if they say they do they're
But it's not your fault
Its me
It's me
Have a great life
And you can keep the plant
Annie grabs her stuff and leaves
' She lies on her bed staring at the ceiling
She picks up the phone
' Lillian's phone lights up, it's on silent
She is ' names cut out and being placed at different tables
Her mom, Laurie, Helen, and two women argue about the seating chart
Lillian looks distraught
118
' Annie sadly hangs up
, the owner is sitting with Annie
Well,  can't think of anything else to tell you
Did you have any questions
No,  think we've covered everything
'm really excited and thank you
Annie gathers her things
(') 'll see you next Monday
What time do start
Four a
m
Annie is a little surprised
Ti's smiling
(') You'll get used to it
Annie smiles back
won't be late
Oh and  wanna try one of those moonpies
(smiling] Yeah
Ok
Annie weaves through the crowded hallway, approaches a window
119
Hi, 'm here to inquire about financial aid
Her cell phone rings
Take these to the second window
'm sorry
Annie's trying to find her phone
The second window
Thanks
It's too late, she looks at her phone
It was Lillian
No message
She doesn't call her back
' Annie gets out of Steve's car
'
Parts and labor, we're lookin' at eight hundred dollars
But with your discount
Discount
Yeah
Rhodes and  worked out a deal way back when, so, this one's on the house
Are you serious
Yep
owe him big time
He runs background checks on all the guys my daughter dates
There's been a lot of 'em
120
You're kidding
If you see him, would you thank him for me and tell him that 'm crazy and 'm sorry
He'll know what you mean
Annie drives past Rhodes' at his post, flicking her brand new taillights
He sees her, but does't respond
' pull her over
She drives by him again and swerves all over the road
He really wants to pull her over, but he doesn't
She goes back one more time, throws a bunch of trash and diet coke cans out of the window
He still ignores her
She gives up and goes home
't get to this point until this morning
wanted to see if we're going in the right direction with annie uniting bridesmaids and saving the day
'
Annie and Steve are in the kitchen, sh's cooking
Steve reads out of the college brochure
Ok, you can take Women's Studies or Spanish
oooh The History of Wine
The phone rings
Hello
Annie
It's Megan, Becca Leslie, Dana and Helen
Oh
Hi-- ' Lillian's missing
121
What do you mean she's missing
We were all supposed to get spray-tans today and she never showed up
No on's heard from her
She could be anywhere, doing anything
She could be -- Jesus Christ, give me the God damn phone
Leslie grabs the phone from Megan
(') Annie, it's Leslie
Look, 'm sure it's nothing to worry about
The weddin's the day after tomorrow, she's been really stressed, so she just probably freaked out and went somewhere
We just want to find her and probably talk her off a ledge
Any ideas
Um, gosh
don't know
Um, 'll come to you guys
'll be there in an hour and 45 minutes
wanna help
Annie hangs up, grabs her keys
She stops, comes back and grabs a small paper bag, and runs out the door
What about the Science of Jazz
Annie pulls over
She puts the piece of paper in the small paper bag
She gets out of the car, leaving it running
few seconds later she comes back without the bag
Takes a deep breath and drives away
'
2
Maybe she's at the park
The park
Don't be stupid Dana
Jeez, take it easy
122
Well, it's closed is all 'm just saying
Maybe she flew somewhere
Everyone always hides in Mexico
don't think she'd leave the country
Maybe she went to the reservoir
Why would she go to the reservoir
Its just a big tank of water
Ernie and  sometimes go for our morning walk there
It's the next best thing to a lake
Oh my God
think  know where she is
'
The girls drive on a dark road
How much further
We're almost there
'm think 'm getting carsick
Is that supposed to be a dig on my driving
Well you do speed up and slow down a lot
Oh, 'm sorry
didn't take a stunt driving course in Renegade missions
Why do you always have to be so condescending
123
Yeah, its getting really old
was being funny
Well it came out a little mean Helen
Dana who's side are you on
All the girls start yelling
Helen loses control of the car for a split second and drives off the road hitting something
The girls scream
She pulls over
All the girls are wide eyed and speechless
What was that
Did we hit something
Was it a person
Guys it's just a flat
've gotten tons of them
Annie goes to get out of the car
/ No
/ Annie don't get out
/ It's pitch dark out
Everybody calm down
'm calling 911
You don't call 911 for a flat tire
huge truck drives by moving their car a little bit
The girls
Guys
We're fine
Helen, put the hazards on
Helen puts them on
124
'm calling
'm calling Kevin
Helen, do you have a jack
Probably
What if we get hit just sitting here
Or kidnapped or chased by an animal
Dana calm down
Shit
don't have any service
Me neither
Oh my God
We're gonna die
Annie has had enough and gets out
The tire is definitely flat
She opens Hele's trunk, lifts the bottom (wherever the jack is in an Escalade] She goes up to the window
'
Everyone's gotta get out, if you want me to fix this
They complain that its dangerous, i's cold, but they do
Annie puts the jack under car
So, how can  help
Hold the flashlight
Leslie and Megan watch as Annie pumps the jack
She really does know what she's doing
The car is raising
125
(') Megan hand me the wrench
Megan hands it to her
Annie starts to unscrew the lug nuts handing them to Megan, with Leslie by her side
Dana and Becca stand with Helen
That's pretty cool she knows how to do change a tire
know
can't believe she's doing it
Dana and Becca move over to Annie
Helen waits alone
Just don't scratch anything
The girls are all crouched down to watch Annie in awe
So what are you doing now
'm removing the lug nuts so we can take the tire off
How does that little thing lift the whole car
It uses hydraulic power
It gives a human being the lifting capacity of 1
5 to three tons
How do you know this stuff
like cars
There's a real artistry to them
Are you guys working or talking
We do't have all night
(quickly) Annie is doing the best she can Helen
So why don't you just stand over there and be quiet and wait
126
Everyone's speechless
Excuse me
Dana stands
She has had it with Helen
said, will you, for once, shut the fuck up
Dana approaches Helen
The other girls are standing now
(') Lillian probably left because of you anyway
What
You're so- bossy
You've been acting like you're in charge this whole time
Do't you realize how much pressure sh's under
You know, Lillian did not want to leave her reception in a unicorn-drawn carriage
She said aThat's not me
a And you ordered it anyway
You've been pushing her this whole time
Annie was right
Yeah
Helen glares at Megan
What are you talking about
The only reason you're even in this wedding is because you're the groom's sister
Weirdo
'd rather be the groom's sister than have cameltoe from my $600 pants
We see that Helen has cameltoe
Megan has surprised them
Why is everyone attacking me
wasn't the one who caused a huge scene at Lillian's bridal shower and made her cry
127
Everyone looks at Annie
hate to interrupt this riveting discussion but a really creepy guy in a Trans Am just pulled over
The guy gets out of the car
He is thirty-ish, wears at- shirt with a cat on it and camouflage shorts
Hey it's pretty late
What are you ladies doing
Becca and Dana scramble into the woods
Leslie gets behind the car
Just changing the tire
You guys need some man hands for that
Nope  think we got it
But thank you
He doesn't leave, the girls worriedly look at each other
Look, if you guys get tired,  live right up that hill
You ladies can just leave your car here, come on up and let us all lay down together
He starts to walk toward them
The girls are scared
Annie gives Megan a look
Megan tries to distract him
Hey
Are those snowflake rims
The guy looks at Megan
Yeah, found a em in a junk yard
Restored a em myself
bet you got a formula 4OO under there
Well, well
Someone knows her cars
128
'm in the Firebird club
You don't say
never met a lady in the before
He walks over to Megan, she gives Annie a nod
Annie rushes to the tire and quickly continues changing it
You ever make it up to the Trans Am Nationals in Dayton
Becca, Dana, Leslie and Helen are huddled together
They talk in a loud whisper
What's happening
What's happening
can hear animals
Be quiet
The guy is moving closer to Megan
Remember Smokey and the Bandit
It's my favorite movie
aGive me a Diablo sandwich and a Dr
Pepper and make it quick
'm in a goddamn hurry
a He leans into her
Why don't you show me what's under the hood
Back at Helen's car
Leslie sneaks over to Annie
How's it comin'
Almost there
The guy has lifted up his hood and Mega's looking
He puts his hands on her ass
129
You wanna get in the backseat
Uh
He is really getting aggressive, pushing against her
(') Hey take it easy
(
) Hey what about me
He turns around to be hit with a huge piece of wood by Helen
He falls
Oh my God
Annie is frantically releasing the jack
, everybody in the car
Get in
Megan, Helen let's go
All the girls scramble in the car, Helen starts it
Annie is finishing
Hey you
Annie get in
'm gonna get you bitches
He is coming towards Annie
She turns towards him with the jack
Back away
Or  will shove this Jack so far down your throat you will shit out
your fucking
face
Whoa, whoa
Alright
Alright
'm leaving
Get out
130
am
live up the hill though if you change your mind
Annie backs up and jumps in the car
Helen peels away
The girls drive away fast
The girls still driving
Megan's eating chips
Megan  was freaked out when he leaned up against you
That was a pretty gutsy move
Annie's the one who tried to make him eat a car jack
Helen hit him over the head with a tree
They all continue talking, Helen and Annie smile
(') There it is, turn left up here
Go down the little hill
Ok, that's the driveway
It's dark and very rustic
It's ' Where Lillian and Dougie met
God  haven't been here in forever
The house is right up here
They pull up to a small cottage and get out of the car
Her car's not here
Doesn't look like any lights are on
She's not here
Annie is sitting on the front step, defeated
131
thought she'd be here
really thought she'd be here
'm sorry
Annie, it's ok
No, it's not
don't know what happened
messed everything up
Lillia's not even talking to me
think 'm so afraid to see what's really happening
Lillian's moving on to this great life and  feel left behind
And know matter how hard  try,  don't fit in to her life now
Everyone is silent
Annie, Lillian loves you
(beat]  know haven't made things easy for you don't have a life and  am bored
Perry is always away and 'm constantly alone and she's been there
And 've been a bridesmaid nine times and although  may have implied it,
've never been a Maid of Honor
wanted to make everything special for Lillian because
don't have a lot of friends
wanted her to like me better and to impress her, and everyone else
And 'm just good at throwing parties
always have been
In fact sometimes  think people only ask me to be in their wedding's because of that
Lillian wouldn't do that
If she asked you to be in her wedding it's because you are her friend
Trust me
Dana is crying and takes a picture
The're both startled by the flash
'm sorry about the Sea World tickets
'm sorry that when  left the shower told your neighbors you were shooting a porn
132
Oh,  didn't know that you did that
Oh, well, sorry
deserved it
must say you do put on some pretty spectacular events
Well, 'm really rich
They smile
It is getting pretty late
What should we do about Lillian
She'll come home when she's ready
( ] Annie enters exhausted to find Lillian sitting against her door
Annie walks up and slides down to sit next to her
After a minute
You okay
Yeah
Didn't mean to make anyone worry
It's okay
really am sorry
'm sorry too
didnt want things to turn out like this
got so caught up in the frenzy of everything, wanting this one day to be perfect
Well its easy to get caught up
133
And it doesnt help that all my friends hate eachother
'm sorry
But it's all good now
We all talked and everythings cool
Really
Yup, Helen and  are best friends now
We're going shopping for cream sweaters tomorrow
She's really not so bad
know
just wish the wedding hadnt become about everything and everyone else but me and Dougie
And now, it's become this thing  never wanted
did want simple
wanted colored lanterns, twinkly lights and food everywhere
wanted a  to play all those stupid wedding songs
It's not too late to have those things
'm sorry  didn't know all the stuff you were going through too
Annie is clearly sad
It's fine
just feel really lost right -- Lillian hugs her
Nothing's going to change
Oh God dont say that
134
mean between you and me
You want to come in
Steve's home
This could be your last chance as a single woman
Ooooo
The small paper bag sits on the side of the road
Cop car pulls up
This is Rhodes' spot, we've seen before
He gets out and walks over to it, confused
He picks it up and it says, aOfficer Rhodesa
He's a little weary but opens it and pulls out a note
aI hear you like moonpies
a He looks in the bag and smiles
Becca and Kevin are slow dancing happily very much in love
Leslie and Paul dancing with two boys trying to join in
They are all happy, he rubs her stomach
Perry and Helen are dancing
They look like they are talking and working things out
He hugs her and kisses her
Lillian and Dougie dance into frame
They are very close
Smiling and kissing
They've never looked happier
She smiles at someone
It's Annie
Annie is watching everyone from the side, smiling also
Steve approaches
Thanks a lot for bringing me
Thanks for coming with me
Megan appears on her other side
Yeah, thanks for bringing him
135
Megan winks at Steve, he grabs her hand and they go to dance
Annie is alone, watching everybody
We see the wedding as a whole
It's a beautiful event
Colored lanterns, twinkly lights, food everywhere
Simple, fun
very Lillian
Annie and Lillian walking out of the reception
So when does school start
week
'm scared
'm gonna be the oldest one there
So what
Now you can have an affair with your teacher and it won't be gross
They walk down the steps
(') Thanks for everything today
Yo've been the best Maid of Honor ever
Really
(kidding)
No
That's not true at all
You were pretty terrible
Today you were good
Annie sees the hotel shuttle
Oh,  want to catch this shuttle back to the hotel
You're always gonna be my best friend
They hug goodbye
She runs down the stairs
will see  in a couple weeks Mrs
Price
136
Lillian waves goodbye and turns to go back inside
Annie runs towards the shuttle
She's too late
The shuttle drives away without her
She missed it
(') Wait
Wait
Stop
Great
Of course
The shuttle is gone, but there's something that was on the other side of it
(
) Need a ride ma'am
It's Rhodes, leaning against his car like Jake in sixteen candles
Annie is all smiles and walks up to him
How did you know  was here
It was really complicated
remembered the name of this place,  called them up, told them  was a cop calling on official police business, doing a very big investigation and uh, made them tell me all the weddings they had planned for the next two months with a bride named Lillian
[: 'm a cop] Annie smiles
Wow
They're looking at each other, not knowing what to do
(') So, did you get the moonpies
Yes  did
Did you like' em
Yeah
No
couldn't eat them
They were completely covered in ants
Ooo,  didn't think about that
137
You probably should have put it in a plastic wrap or maybe a foil or something
Tupperware would've worked but then 'd have to get it back to you-'m gonna kiss you right now so
He walks to her and takes her in his arms
They are about to kiss
Rhodes stops
(' (') didn't want to miss my chance again
() Me neither
They
The end
Annie is walking back to her hotel
cop car pulls up next to her
(
) Need a ride ma'am
She turns to see Rhodes driving slowly next to her
How did you know  was here
'm a cop
They're looking at each other, not knowing what to do
So, did you get the moonpies
Yes  did
Did you like' em
Yeah
No
couldn't eat them
They were completely covered in ants
138
Ooo,  didn't think about that
The real reason  came here today is that have something that belongs to you
He opens his hand to reveal the ugly carrot
She smiles
He stops the car and unlocks the passenger door
She gets in
They drive off into the sunset
