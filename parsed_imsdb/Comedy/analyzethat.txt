Screenplay by and   and Based on characters created by and June 2002 Draft : -  - Two men,  and  "," stand at  the   end of the deserted bar, talking quietly, oblivious to  the   exotic dancer grinding her pelvis on a pole in the middle  of   the small stage
Body language and charisma tell us   that   Caesar is the boss, "Ducks" his lieutenant
It's Peezee
Gotta be
He hates your fuckin' guts
(brooding) don't know
Who else knew about the money
And how did Peezee know they popped Tony Cisco when we didn't even hear about it 'til last night
(sighs heavily) don't know
(pressing) What is so hard to understand here
You said yourself Peezee was a mamaluke and you couldn't trust him
Now suddenly you're soft on the guy
just don't think it was him
Okay, 'll bite
If not Peezee, then who
(slowly rising to his full height) think it was you, Ducks
Caesar starts to walk away as the bartender, now holding a sawed-off shotgun, moves closer to Ducks
The exotic dancer splits in a hurry through a curtain at the back of the stage
(scared) You gotta be kiddin'
Caesar stops at the door where two of his soldiers have 2
appeared, holding
Caesar, you know me
What kind of fuckin' idiot would  have to be to try that shit with you
dead fuckin' idiot
As he walks out the door, the soldiers   on Marty "Ducks
" Caesar doesn't look back
: The title credits come up on the made-for-cable series we've been watching, "Little Caesar
"    from : - Maximum-security prisoners are gathered around watching their favorite show in the rec room
In the front row is  , former New York crime boss, and a couple of other wiseguys
Garbage
Change the channel
Okay, Paul
The  gets up and starts switching channels on the
couple of  in the back start to protest
Hey
What're you doin', asshole
Vitti turns and stares at them
They fall silent immediately
Sorry, Mr
Vitti
Didn't mean any disrespect
Punks
Vitti turns the page and sees a huge headline in the Post: He gets up, agitated
3
'm going to bed
Vitti stands up and heads back to his cell
: - As Vitti approaches his cell, he sees a prison guard standing by
His cellmate, , a giant of a man, comes out of their cell carrying his bedroll and a box containing his other meager possessions
(suspicious) What's goin' on, Earl
They're transferring me
Why
(shrugs) Don't know
Thanks for looking out for me, Mr
Vitti
Yeah
Take it easy
He notices something in the box
Hey, Earl
Is that my after-shave
(blanches) 'm sorry
just grabbed stuff -- didn't know -- That's okay
Keep it
Go ahead
Thanks
See you around
Earl exits with the guard
Vitti hesitates a moment, then warily steps into his cell
: '  - The cellblock is quiet
guard stops outside the darkened cell, looks around to make sure no one is watching, then 4
pulls out a  with a , reaches through the bars and into Vitti's shadowy form under the blanket
Then he slips away as quietly as he appeared
his exit we    Vitti, unhurt, curled up under his bunk
: - deluxe casket flanked by elaborate floral displays and an easel displaying a portrait of the deceased, Dr
Isaac Sobel
Mourners fill the pews, standees at the back, an overflow crowd
sits in the front row, staring at the casket with his wife, , his son, , now a teenager, ' , and her friend,
At the podium, the  is speaking
And now 'd like to call on Isaac's son, Dr
Ben Sobel, who would like to say a few words
Ben rises and crosses solemnly to the podium
(addressing audience) It's very difficult for me to talk about my father, because in a sense 'm talking about two men
(') One, of    course, is the public Isaac Sobel,    the eminent psychotherapist and popular    author known to millions of readers    around the world
Laura, Michael and Ben's Mother listen proudly to the eulogy
The second Isaac Sobel is the private man -- my father -- Dad
And for those of you who knew him well and knew our family -- well, let's face it -- my father was a psychotic, mind- fucking prick
An arrogant, abusive, ego-inflated -- interrupts him
: 5
still seated in the front row, daydreaming
The as all the mourners and even the Rabbi discreetly check their cell phones
Then Ben realizes it's his, fumbles for the phone in his jacket pocket and answers it
(whispers) Hello
The mourners mutter
: - Guess who, you fuck
: Ben turns away from Laura
Paul
(to Laura) have to, uh, take this
(into phone) This isn't a good time
Vitti is disheveled, his hair messed, his shirt buttoned wrong
Not a good time
Let me explain something to you
'm in fucking Hell right now
This is not a good time
(sotto voce) can't talk right now
My father died
So what does that have to do with me
Call me later -- Don't hang up on, Sobel
They're tryin' to kill me
6
Ben hangs up
: He stands there for a long beat just staring, the in his ear
: -   - Vitti and another  pass through the cafeteria line with their trays
Vitti now looks catatonic
#2 Ooh, they got tapioca
love tapioca
(looks at Vitti) You all right, Paul
Vitti just stares, wild-eyed, actually drooling a little
#2 Can  have your tapioca
guard, the one who tried to kill him, watches Vitti from his post
Then he nods to someone across the room
, a heavily-muscled and tattooed gang member, nods in response
Vitti walks past the table where Coyote is sitting with other tough Hispanic gang members
(to Vitti) Hey, Fredo
Or is it Guido
His friends laugh
Vitti stops and stares dumbly at them
Just keep walkin', Don Corleone
There is a tense moment, then Vitti bursts out laughing
Shut up
Vitti laughs harder, strangely manic
said, shut up, bitch
7
But Vitti can't stop
He drops his tray of slop, splattering food on the men
Coyote leaps to his feet and pulls a shiv
You're a dead man, jefe
Coyote lunges at Vitti with the knife, but Vitti suddenly whirls around, bashes Coyote in the face with his food tray and bursts into song
(singing, with appropriate dance moves) 'When you're a Jet, You're a Jet all the way, From your first cigarette To your last dyin' day
' Prisoners and guards stare at him like he's nuts
Coyote stabs at him again, but Vitti dodges and smashes him over the head with the tray
'When you're a Jet, If the shit hits the fan, You got brothers around, You're a family man
' You're a dead man, jefe
Coyote rushes him, but Vitti sidesteps and hits him in the face
Guards move in from all sides
Vitti jumps up on the tabletop to escape them
(kicking at them, singing) ' like to be in America, Okay by me in America
' The guards drag him down and cuff his hands behind him, then carry him out stiff as a board
'Tonight, tonight, won't be just any night -- ' : - limo pulls up to an old, but well-maintained suburban house, the family gets out and starts walking to the house
8
: -   - The family crosses to the front door
(sighs deeply) can't believe he's gone
can't believe what you said about him
Cold and withholding
You had to tell everybody
Nice
Why didn't you just take a swing at the casket
Ben opens the front door and they go in
: - The family enters the foyer
Okay,  might have strayed from my notes a little
'm dealing with a lot of stuff here
Grief is a process
Laura notices    and  waiting for them in the living room
Cerrone is an attractive woman in her late twenties, wearing a dangerously-short skirt
Miller is a clean-cut man in his thirties
Dr
Sobel, 'm Agent Miller, this is Special Agent Cerrone, Federal Bureau of Investigation
We'd just like to ask you a few questions, if we could
(testy) Can  ask what this is about
We just came from the cemetery
We know this is a difficult time for you, Dr
Sobel
Sorry about your father
Thank you, 'm going to miss him 9
terribly
Ben gestures for them to sit
Laura and Michael both look at him doubtfully
mean -- there were issues -- as, think, there are with any father and son
He wasn't especially warm -- Ben -- once today
Enough
No, 'm just saying, in spite of all that -- Agent Cerrone crosses her legs, a move that does not go unnoticed by Ben and Michael
-- he was a great, great legs
(beat) Man
Dr
Sobel, you received a call this morning from Paul Vitti
Laura shoots him a look
What makes you think Paul Vitti called me
Because we monitor and record all his phone calls from Sing Sing
Then yes
He did
That was him on the phone
Yes
And you didn't tell me
Wow
Talk about withholding
Michael
10
You told her -- (nodding at Agent Cerrone) You told her at the drop of a hat
Agents Cerrone and Miller eye each other
She's with the
She needs to know these things
Oh,  see
And  don't
Why tell Laura
She couldn't possibly handle a phone call
Did  say that
You folks need a minute
No, we're fine
If you don't need me anymore, 'll be in the kitchen
(to Agent Cerrone) And two words of advice -- from one professional woman to another -- Pant
Suit
She exits
She's grieving
It's a process
We understand
(prompting) Vitti
Oh, yes
Paul Vitti and  were involved in some organized crime activity a couple of years ago mean,  wasn't involved -- not 'involved' involved --  was just trying to help him therapeutically, and some people tried to, uh, kill us
No big deal
Well, shortly after you spoke, he 11
seemed to have some kind of breakdown
What kind of breakdown
think you'd better go up there and see for yourself
: -   - Vitti huddles in the corner of a bare, white, padded cell, rocking, completely out of his head
(singing) ' feel pretty, oh, so pretty,  feel pretty and witty and bright
' - Ben watches through a two-way mirror with the prison psychiatrist,
They can hear Vitti through a wall-mounted speaker
'm treating him with Thioridazine, 300 milligrams,
That seems to keep him pretty calm
(watching Vitti) That would keep a parade pretty calm
He just keeps singing West Side Story songs
'Tonight,' 'Maria,' the balcony scene
The balcony scene
Both parts
Oh, yeah
Get him to do 'Officer Krupke
' It's really good
Ben and Dr
Cutler enter
Vitti doesn't seem to notice
(singing) 'Who's the pretty girl in the mirror 12
there
What mirror
Where
Who can that attractive girl be
' Paul, it's me
Ben Sobel
Paul
(beat) Maria
Tony
(with a look to Dr
Cutler) Oh, boy
(to Vitti) What's going on, Maria
The rumble -- it's tonight
have to get out of here
don't want to die
No, Chino, no
Vitti's jaw suddenly goes slack and he slumps in his seat, staring forward
Paul
Paul
Ben waves a hand in front of Vitti's face
Nothing
This is how it's been
He sings for a while, then he goes completely catatonic
(skeptical) Really
Can we take him to an examining room
Of course
: - Vitti sits inert on the examination table
You already did a neurological work- up
Yep
No tumors, no aneurisms, no sign of stroke -- 13
Ben slaps Vitti's face lightly a couple times
Completely catatonic -- He pulls on Vitti's ears and nose
Vitti does not react
Totally gone
Well,  don't think he's smart enough to be faking
Street smart, yes, but we're talking about an
just north of a bedroom slipper
Ben checks Vitti out of the corner of his eye
No reaction
Then Ben takes a sharp needle from an instrument tray
So if  just stuck him with this needle, he probably wouldn't even respond
don't know
Try it
Ben hesitates for a moment to see if Vitti will crack, then Okay -- He sticks the needle into Vitti's shoulder
(bursts into song) 'Boy, boy, crazy boy, keep cool, boy
Got a rocket in your pocket, keep cool-y cool boy -- ' : -   - Vitti is sitting at a table facing Ben
Dr
Cutler observes from a chair in the corner
Paul, we're going to    give you some tests to assess your    mental condition
There's no pressure    -- just answer as best you can
Do      have your consent to share the results    of these tests
Mommy's mad at me because  made a boom on the rug
14
'll take that as a yes
Okay, 'm going to show you ten cards, each containing a picture of an inkblot want you to look at each card and tell me what you see
see you
see him
see a table
Focus, Paul
You haven't seen the card yet
(hands him first card) What does this look like to you
Take your time
Vitti looks at the wrong side of the card
It's all white
It looks like snow
No, Paul, the other side
Vitti turns it over and makes a face
bat
big bat
Or a weasel
(taking notes) Bat or weasel
All right
And he's got a little girl -- no, it's a little boy -- in his teeth -- and he's shakin' him and shakin' him 'cause the kid didn't wipe himself good -- and the kid is screaming because the bat-weasel ripped out his throat and the blood is shootin' out of his neck vein
(pointing) That's the blood
Doctor Cutler looks worried
(skeptical) See anything else
Just the pussy with the teeth
15
(making more notes) Pussy with teeth
Next card
: Vitti is literally trying to pound a square peg into a round hole
: Now try repeating the numbers backwards
For instance, if  was 1- 2-3, you will say 3-2-1
Okay, 7-3-8
3-2-1
Try again
7-3-8
Blue
: Vitti studies a vague and ambiguous photograph of a man standing beside a bed with a sleeping woman and child on it
Just tell me what you think is going on in this picture
This is a picture of a guy -- nice, hardworking guy -- comes home and finds out his wife's been screwin' this midget while he was out of town
(appalled, makes a note) Screwing a midget
And how does the story end
think he works over the midget for a while, then he blows 'em away
16
The wife or the midget
(smirks) Trick question, right
Both of 'em
: Okay, Paul
Last test
In this one, 'm going to start a sentence and you complete it any way you want to
Ready
' get angry -- ' Yes
No, you're supposed to complete the sentence
did
said 'yes
' wasn't asking if you agreed or disagreed; it was more like, ' get angry when -- ' -- whenever
Well, that about does it for me
: '  - Ben meets with  , the
Attorney for the Southern District of New York
Based on his symptoms and the test results, 'd say brief psychotic disorder -- if it persists, possibly schizophreniform disorder
And Dr
Cutler agrees with my diagnosis
So he's crazy
17
Dr
Cutler
No, he's annoying, but -- Vitti
Not crazy
At least not permanently
In certain people, continuous exposure to an extremely stressful situation -- soldiers in combat, for instance, disaster victims, a hostage situation, or being locked up in a maximum security prison with someone trying to kill you -- it can produce a temporary psychotic state
How temporary
day, a week, up to a month -- if the precipitating stressors are removed
(musing) Which means he's not going to get any better while he's still in the can
He could get worse
He could deteriorate to the point where he'd be permanently schizophrenic
Then 'd say he's got a real problem, because he goes before the parole board in four weeks
You think they'll let him out
Oh, yeah, 'm sure they'll want to release a major Mafia figure who's now totally deranged on top of it
(thinks) Well, couldn't you release him to    a halfway house or some place where    he could get some decent treatment
Based on my earlier work with him, don't think he's dangerous, and think he was making a real effort    to reform himself
18
You do, huh
(thinks for a long moment) Okay
Then 'll tell you what
'm gonna release him into your custody
Mine
Me
No, this is a bad time for me
My father just died -- and 've got this bulging disc in my neck -- and we're redecorating, which is a total nightmare
can't -- You want to see him killed in prison
No, of course not
Or sent to a facility for the criminally insane
No -- Then he's all yours
'm going to talk to the Bureau of Prisons and get you certified as a temporary federal institution
(stricken) What
can't be an institution
(firm) You've got thirty days to get him in shape for his parole hearing
That means sane, sober and gainfully employed
But let me warn you, Doctor
If he fucks up in any way -- if he flees, or if  find out that this whole thing was just a setup so he could get back on the street and return to a life of crime --  will hold you totally responsible, and 'll see that you are stripped of your license and prosecuted to the full extent of the law
Are we clear
(gulp) Yes
We're clear
19
You still want him
(long beat to decide) Yes
: - The gate opens and Ben coaxes Vitti outside
guard watches them
Okay, Paul -- this way
Vitti comes out carrying an overnight bag, walking like a zombie
Ben leads him over to the car and opens the door for him
Vitti keeps walking, passing the car
This way, Paul
Over here
Here we go
Ben helps Vitti into the car
One of Vitti's legs is still outside
Leg, Paul
Leg up
Ben lifts Vitti's leg into the car and closes the door
: - Ben  the  and pulls away with Vitti still slumped in his seat
Once out of sight of the prison, Vitti straightens and turns on Ben, suddenly lucid
(enraged) You fucking son-of-a-bitch
Where the fuck do you get off sticking me with a needle
knew it
knew you were faking
You used me to get you out of prison
Took you long enough
was singin' West Side Story for three fuckin' days
'm half a fag already
20
What are you talking about
call you to say somebody's trying to kill me and you hang up on me
was at the funeral home
You're my fuckin' doctor
My father died
Me me me me
He's dead
Get over it
Are you hearing yourself
(perfunctorily) 'm deeply sorry for your loss
Yeah,  can see how touched you are
What's the difference
You hated him anyway
loved my father
'm feeling a lot of grief right now
'm not sensing it, but if you say so
Ben nervously pops a pill and swallows it
(re:   pill) What's that
Decongestant
'm getting over a cold
All right, what's going on
Who's after you
don't know -- take your pick
Could be my old family, or could be the Rigazzis
Ever heard of Lou Rigazzi - - Lou 'The Wrench'
21
Why "The Wrench"
Because he twisted a guy's head off once
Off
Off
Fuckin' Calabrese -- animals
And comin' from me you know that's a big compliment
'm sure they'd be flattered
So -- The feds are really putting the pressure on
The families are fighting each other again -- what's left of 'em
It's the fall of the fuckin' Roman Empire
It's World War Three out there
So what does that have to do with you
They knew  was gettin' out soon and the last thing anybody wants to see is me getting into it on either side
Maybe if you just explain to them -- that you're out of it now, that you're starting a new life -- Yeah,   they'll probably want to throw me a   party and give me a gold watch
Trust   me -- nobody's lookin' forward to me   being out
You are, aren't you
Me
Oh, yeah, my future looks real fuckin' rosy
Ben can't believe what he's gotten himself into
: - 22
Ben and Vitti pull into the driveway and get out of the car
Want to grab your stuff
'm not gonna be here that long
Jelly's pickin' me up in an hour
Paul
don't think you understand
You're in my custody
could get in a lot of trouble if you screw up
Don't worry about it
'll call you tomorrow
Oh, no
You want to go back to Sing Sing
Thursday's meatloaf night can have you back there in no time
The
Attorney was very clear
You stay with me; therapy every day; you can't leave the area without permission -- What are you, my father now
And you    have to get a job as soon as you're    well enough, which is now
So are you    coming in with me or do  have to make    a phone call
Vitti relents and grabs his stuff from the back seat
'm comin'
Some fuckin' life this is gonna be
He follows Ben up the stairs
: '  - Chapin is conferring with another
, , and Agents Miller and Cerrone
You really think Vitti is crazy
Yeah, he's about as crazy as  am
23
Think about it
Locked up, he was absolutely no use to me
But back on the street, Vitti's still powerful enough to pose a threat to both families
It's like throwing gasoline on a fire
If we can use Vitti to escalate this war, we might just end up putting them all away
That's if he goes back to his old life
If
People like Paul Vitti     don't change
This guy's been a     menace to society since he was twelve    years old
Being a criminal is all he    knows
Trust me
He's gonna head straight for trouble
Then all we have to do is sit back and pick up the pieces
We could get twenty, maybe even thirty indictments next time the grand jury convenes
(smiles) You know, Giuliani started this way
You running for mayor
Could happen
Just stick with Vitti
: - Ben and Laura are in the kitchen, cleaning up the dinner dishes
Ben is wearing an apron that says "To Heck with Housework
" and a pair of Playtex rubber gloves
Laura is angrily muscling dishes around
How could you
How could you bring him here
That -- (shuddering) -- mobster -- in my home -- eating off my dishes
24
(looking at the plate in her hand, disgusted) Ewww
She scrubs the plate with manic energy
didn't have a lot of choice
Oh, there's a law that says you have to bring a gangster home
told you
He's in my custody
'm a federal institution
You should be in an institution
Why couldn't he just go home
His wife and kids aren't here
They're in Ohio
Ohio
Sure
Everyone gets to be in Ohio except me
His life was threatened and he didn't want to endanger his family
How thoughtful
What about endangering our family
(worried) think my teeth are loose
Feel my teeth
Honey, your teeth are fine
know it's an imposition, but what could do
didn't want him here
They - You didn't want him,  didn't want him, but here he is
She looks up and jumps when she sees Vitti standing there
(covering, cheerful) Here he is
Coffee
25
What
Somebody said something about coffee
That was you
You said you wanted some
So what's the holdup
(to Ben) Why don't you make your friend some coffee
'm going upstairs to take a long bath and hopefully drown
Laura smiles at the two men, then exits
You'll have to forgive her
She's usually a great hostess
understand
She's uncomfortable
The whole situation's a little awkward with me bein' here -- but let's face it, Emily fuckin' Post she's not
Emily fuckin' Post
Well, that explains why she rarely used her middle name
Listen,  got a friend coming over didn't want you to be surprised
What    kind of friend
Because if it's 'The    Wrench,' or 'The Power Drill' or any    other kind of tool    -- Not that kind of friend
It's a personal thing
They won't stay late, will they
(stares at him) Are you really that pussy-whipped
26
'm not -- this has nothing to do with Laura
heard her busting your balls
We were having a disagreement certain amount of conflict is normal in a marriage
Or
Or what
Or you're pussy-whipped
Paul -- Good night, Whippy
(calls after him) Remember, this is only temporary
Oh, really
didn't hear you the tenth fuckin' time
He exits
: - Ben knocks on Michael's door and walks in without waiting to be asked
: '  - Michael is sitting up in bed reading
(oblivious) Mike, can we talk for a second
Sure
What
27
know the last few weeks have been kind of tough with Grandpa -- dying and everything -- and it might've felt to you like  didn't have time for you or  didn't care about how you feel
No, it didn't
Good
Because  want you to know that you can talk to me about stuff and that  can really listen and understand what you're going through
do, Dad
And if  seemed a little hard on Grandpa, it's just that your grandfather was a hard man in a lot of ways
He wanted everything done his way and sometimes  just felt like nothing  ever did was good enough don't want it to be that way with us
It's not
And you know, at times like this we all might start questioning our own mortality and you might be thinking how devastated you'd be if  died
Right
No
Not really
That's good
Good talk
And realize it's all a little hectic right now, but this Paul Vitti thing is only temporary, okay
Oh, really
didn't hear you the tenth fuckin' time
That's not funny
Good night, Michael
28
Good night, Whippy
Ben exits, shaking his head
The moment he's gone, the rumpled blankets next to Michael shift, and a ,  16--  emerges from hiding under the comforter
gotta get home
What was that about
have no idea
Parenting stuff
: - The suburban street is dark and quiet and all the lights are off in the house
(
) Ohhhhh
Ohhhhh, Paul
: - The room is dark
We   the foot of Ben and Laura's bed and find them both wide awake staring straight up at the ceiling, listening
(
) Ohhhh, God
Oh, oh, oh, oh
This has to be some kind of record, don't you think
It's been like forty minutes
How long are you going to let them go on
Let them
How much longer can he go
Another twenty minutes, 'm either breaking it up or calling the Guinness Book of Records
The  shifts into low gear, more guttural and bestial
Oh, give me a break
She's got to be 29
faking
Nobody sounds like that
(suggestively) That's not entirely true
Okay, sometimes you do sound like that
The
kicks up another notch
Laura rolls over and jams her pillow over her ears
Ben growls, exasperated
: '  - Michael's girlfriend is gone
He has his bedroom door open a crack and he's standing there holding a small tape recorder and smiling broadly
(
) (high-pitched now) Ah, ah, ah, ah
: - Agents Cerrone and Miller sit in a sedan with a small, sophisticated-looking microphone trained on the Sobel house just down the street
They hear the high-pitched
Miller gives Cerrone a look
Oh, come on
Nobody sounds like that
: - Ben takes a deep breath and knocks sharply on the guest room door
The heavy
After a moment, Vitti appears wearing only a bathrobe
Ben can see the beautiful sitting naked on the bed
What
(indignant) have a 17-year-old son
So let him get his own fuckin' girl
30
Can  talk to you, please
Actually, 'm right in the middle of someone
Sheila starts to light a cigarette
Miss
Excuse me
There's no smoking in this house
: '  - Michael freezes, about to light a cigarette himself
: - Ben comes down the stairs with Vitti
What do you think you're doing
Minding my own fuckin' business, like you should be doin'
Well, it's a little hard with the live sex show going on in the guest room
've been in prison for two and a half years
What am  supposed to do
Go to a hotel
That's what  wanted to do, but you told me  had no choice -- it was either here or Sing Sing
'm not trying to punish you
These aren't my rules, but  have a responsibility here
Besides, thought you might like a nice home- cooked meal after being in prison that long
31
Yeah, that's what 've been jerkin' off about for eight hundred consecutive nights -- a nice home- cooked meal
(making a jerking motion) Ohhhh, tuna casserole
That girl is not staying here
think you're jealous
Oh, yeah, 'm really jealous
didn't hear nothin' comin' out of your room
We don't think it's necessary to wake the neighbors every time we have sex
Hey, if you're really quiet, you might be able to do it without even wakin' up your wife
(
) (moaning) Ohhh
Ohhh
Ben looks curiously at Vitti
told her if  wasn't back in two minutes to start without me
gotta go
Vitti heads back upstairs
This is not a good start, Paul
: - Laura and Ben are hosting a brunch for the out-of-town relatives
Laura offers a basket of bagels to a seated, older woman
32
Aunt Ester, 'm so sorry we had to put you up at the hotel
We wanted you here with us, but we had an unexpected house guest
She glares at Ben
(sighs) Your father always had room for us
'm sorry
(mutters to Laura) Next time  lose a parent, 'll be sure to reserve the guest room
somewhere, then Sheila storms into the room sobbing, her hair askew, tucking her blouse into her skirt
(screaming) Go to hell, Paul
You just go to hell
(
) Go ahead
Get out of here, you crazy fuckin' whore
Vitti charges into the room, his robe open
From the reactions of everyone in the room, it's clear he's not wearing anything under it
Go back to turning tricks in Jersey for all  fuckin' care
Sheila exits and slams the front door
Vitti sees everyone staring at him
He closes his robe
How's it goin'
(sees buffet) Oh, we got food
Good
Vitti heads for the buffet
(smiling) Ben
(quickly) Paul
33
Vitti bellies up to the buffet, stepping between an older couple
He eyes the food disdainfully
Oh, great
Jew food
Who do you have to fuck to get some bacon around here
The woman reacts in horror
Not you, 'm guessing
(snags Vitti's arm) Why don't we go to my office
'll make you a plate
: '  - Ben and Vitti enter
Vitti still in his robe
What is it with your relatives
They tend to overreact quite a bit
know
All you did was flash everybody in the dining room
So
From the look of 'em, some of those broads haven't seen the old salcicc' in a long time
It's good for them
Well, when the paramedics revive my Aunt Goldie, 'll be sure to ask her
Sit
Vitti starts for Ben's chair
Ah ah ah
He points Vitti to the sofa and takes his own chair
So what are you going to do, Paul
What do you mean
With your life
34
First 'm gonna find out who's tryin' to kill me
'm a target
Somebody could shoot right through that window -- blow my fuckin' head off
Ben sees that he's in the line of fire, gets up and moves out of the way
Okay, that's a priority
Have you thought about what you're going to do for work
Yeah
'm too big for a jockey so was thinkin' maybe a hairdresser
They'll call me Mr
Paul
Come on
There must be something you like to do
like hitting a guy on the head with a baseball bat
Oh, sporting goods
We'll check the want ads tomorrow but don't get your hopes up
Anything else
Shylocking, bookmaking, unions, the usual -- Who are you
Who am
'm the guy who's paying you $150 an hour to play these stupid fuckin' games
You know who  am
know that
mean what are you
What do you mean, 'What am
' just want to know how you see yourself
35
You're making me very fuckin' nervous
Just answer the question
What are you
(shrugs) 'm the boss
Really
The boss of what -- Jelly
You're not the boss of me
So what are you the boss of
You, you're good
see what you're doing here
What am  doing, Paul
You're pissing me off is what you're doing
Look at me
It's starting again, the anxiety
understand
(') You've    spent your whole life becoming who you    are and now you can't be that anymore    -- that's gotta be scary
If you're    not Paul Vitti the mob boss, who are    you
Vitti is at a loss
Well, let's think
When you were a kid, What did you want to be
don't know
Who remembers that stuff
You must've wanted to be something when you were little -- fireman
No
Baseball player
36
No
Astronaut
No
Al Capone
Yeah, maybe
What did you want to be
We're not talking about me
am
Fine
wanted to be a philatelist
You wanted to look up people's assholes all day
No, Paul,  believe you're thinking of a proctologist
wanted to collect rare and unusual stamps
You must've been a lot of laughs when you were a kid
Lonely, huh
Oh yeah
Big time
So what did you want to be
It's stupid
You afraid to tell me
Yeah, 'm afraid
Then tell me
'm not here to judge you
37
(a beat) Okay
When  was really little -- like seven or eight -- maybe  wanted to be a cowboy
cowboy
Really
Yeah
My father gave   me a cowboy suit -- you know, the  vest, the chaps, the cap guns --  the whole thing
And he used to   take me up to my uncle's farm in  New Jersey and lead me around on  this pony
Yippee-i-o
You happy   now
So you watched cowboy movies and shows with your father
Everybody
The whole family
My father loved 'Gunsmoke
' Sheriff Dillon
(corrects him) Marshal Dillon
Marshal
So who were your favorite cowboys
This is so fuckin' retarded
Paul
All right
Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, the Lone Ranger -- Interesting
They're all good guys
Yeah,  guess
No, that's important
You didn't want to be the bad guy
You wanted to be the hero
38
Yeah, so
So what happened
don't know
Nothing happened
So why didn't you become a cowboy
lived in East Harlem
joined a street gang when  was 12 and that was it
Something else happened when you were twelve
What
(prompting) Something that made you very sad
The Dodgers moved from Brooklyn to Everybody took it pretty hard
Something else
We playin' a guessing game here
Paul
Your father was murdered
Right in front of you
Remember
Do  remember
think about it every fuckin' day of my life
What's that got to do with it
It's got everything   to do with it
He gave you the cowboy   suit
With a white hat
He was    in the mob, but he wanted you to be a   good guy, didn't he
Vitti starts thinking about his father and starts to weep
39
Yeah
He did
He didn't want you in the gang life
He only did it himself so you wouldn't have to
He was trying to buy you a better life than his
(crying harder) He always said he wanted me to go to college
didn't even finish high school
He really starts sobbing now
Well, Paul, this could be a  great opportunity for you
You're   right back where you were when you  were twelve
You've got some big   choices to make
Vitti fights to regain control
Okay
Okay
That's enough of that shit
It's not shit, Paul
My point is, when you're a child, you think anything is possible
Wouldn't it be great to think like that now
(retreating back into his cynicism) Yeah, just sprinkle some fuckin' fairy dust on me
'm just saying you've got to keep an open mind and explore some new possibilities
Try some different things -- maybe you'll connect with one of them
There's a career counselor  work with
can call him for you
He may be able to help you find a job
You mean working for somebody
'm supposed to take orders from some guy who used to get me coffee
(starts sweating and 40
breathing hard) can't do that
It's not right
It's not me
How do you know unless you try
Suddenly one of the  behind Vitti
Ben dives for cover
Silence -- then another  on the window
Ben looks out and sees  in the back yard, tossing stones at the window
(calls out) Hiya, Doc
Sorry about the window
Ben waves him around to the side door
: - Jelly is loading up a plate of food from the buffet, talking to the elderly relatives
Laura stares at him
love  lox and bagels
dated a Jewish  woman once
Actually, she might  have been the love of my life, but my  mother broke it up
(') She was always hockin' me a chinick about the madels
wonderful woman, my mother, but she fuckin' hates the Hebes
Really
(noting mountain of food on his plate) More smoked salmon
Don't be shy
Ben enters
Jelly -- what are you doing here
Makin' new friends
How's it going, Doc
brought some clothes for Mr
Vitti
(indicating the door) Ben
41
That's great, Jelly
'd love to catch up with you -- outside
(rising) You got it
(to Laura) Thanks, Mrs
(to others) So long, everybody
Ess gesunterhait
Jelly and Ben exit
: - Ben and Jelly walk out to the driveway where Jelly's Buick is parked
So
Long time no see
You look good, Doc
(trying to be pleasant) And you, Jelly -- you look -- (can't find words for how he looks) Did you get a haircut
thought you were in prison
It would appear not
How'd you get out
New trial
The evidence in my first trail was, you know, tainted
Turns out two of the witnesses against me changed their minds -- and the third one, he died after a short illness
What did he have
Gunshot wound to the head
That's not an illness
42
Yeah, but it is short
Vitti, now dressed, comes out of the house and crosses to the car
(to Vitti) Where are you going
got stuff to do
What kind of stuff
(as he gets into the car) Calm down
'll be back
You can't leave without my permission
Oh, yeah
Watch me
Drive, Jelly
Jelly  the  and slowly backs out of the driveway
Ben runs after the car, talking to Vitti through the open window
That's it, Paul
forbid you to go
Stop sweating, Doc
'll be back
Vitti puts the window up
(shouts anxiously) If you screw this up, Paul -- Paul
The car pulls away
(angrily) Shit
Shit, shit, shit
Ben turns and sees his Aunt Goldie on the porch
So, the fat one -- he's single
: 43
- Soldiers lounge at the bar, keeping a respectful distance from the capos seated at a table in the rear
All eyes turn as the door opens and Vitti enters
, Vitti's old consigliere rises and warmly but warily welcomes Vitti back into the fold
Paulie, great to see you
You're lookin' good, kid
Lookin' very good
Jelly, how are ya
Vitti embraces him and they sit down with the others
So, Paul, we heard you had some trouble while you were away
Some 'mental' problems
No, 'm okay
It was an act
had to pretend  was nuts
There were people watching me all the time
Little people
Doctors
They never woulda let me out if they thought  was normal
So you ain't crazy
You want to see crazy
Just tell me who's trying to kill me
'll show you crazy
We're in a war, Paul -- nobody's safe right now
The Rigazzis are walkin' all over us
We got next to nothing coming in, and  don't have to tell you, you don't buy a lot of muscle without money these days
We need you, Paul
The family needs you
can't do it, Sal
'm out of it
Come on, Paulie
Nobody used to do the big jobs like you
Air France-- they're still talkin' about it
44
Sal, even if  wanted to -- the feds After your father died,  always treated you like my own son
You know that
know
He was a good man
still miss him
Yeah,  do too
So you'll think about it
For me, Paulie
Yeah, okay, 'll think about it
(brightening) Hey, what is this -- a fuckin' funeral here
You just got back from college for Chrissakes
We should be havin' a party for you
(to bartender) Hey, Nino, give everybody a round here
We gotta drink to Paul
can't, Sal
gotta go talk to the boss
understand
No problem
It's good to have you back, Paul
(embraces him) Don't forget what  said
We're countin' on you
Vitti gives his old friend a pat on the back and exits
: - Jelly pulls up, Vitti gets out and strides up to the front door of a nice home on Staten Island and  the
: 45
- The door is opened by  , early thirties, dark and sullen
Yeah, what
'Yeah, what
'    That's how you answer the door
You got a problem with that
Yeah
Vitti punches Eddie in the mouth, sending him sprawling back into the living room
Several other bodyguards are watching television, caught off guard by Vitti's sudden entrance
Where is she
(
) (calls out) In the kitchen, Paul
: '  - Vitti enters
, mid-forties, still sexy even in an apron, is mixing cake batter in a bowl with an electric mixer
Paul -- what a nice surprise
How's it goin', Patty
Good
It's good
Give me a kiss, you
Patty hugs and kisses him, taking the opportunity to pat him down for a weapon or a hidden wire
Sorry to hear about Carmine
He was a good man
Yeah
You live with a person twenty- one years, then one day they're 46
pulling his torso out of the river
It's hard
'll bet -- especially with all the talk about you being the one who put him there
That's why  try not to gossip, Paul
It's ugly
Just a sec
(screaming to ceiling) Michelle
Teresa
It's ten-thirty
Stop fucking around and get ready for ballet
(to Vitti) It's hard being a single parent and a career woman
Yeah, 'm sure you're very busy
The pressure -- it's awful
For instance, a lot of people think, now that you're out, you're going to try and take the family back from me
But said, no, Paul would never do that
(smiling) By the way, how are Marie and the kids
Still in Ohio
In Shaker Heights
At 1356 Locust
Vitti explodes, reaches across the counter and grabs her by the shoulders
(enraged) You even go near them, you crazy bitch -- (quietly) Don't make me call my guys in
You may need the shit kicked out of you, but not in here
just mopped
Vitti lets her go
(smoothing clothes, flushed and a little excited) Wow
Have you been working out
Yeah,  been workin' out who's trying 47
to kill me
'd love to hear your thoughts on that
It's a dog-eat-dog world out there
Nobody's gonna be safe unless we can end this thing with the Rigazzis
So then you didn't have nothin' to do with it
(hurt) Oh, Paul
You actually think  would kill you
All the years we've known each other -- the Christmas parties, the fun times at the beach
It wouldn't be right
want us to be friends
(smiles demurely) Who knows
Maybe we'll be more than friends
Want to lick my beaters
She holds the beaters out to him
(declining) Thanks
gotta see a guy about a business thing
What kind of business
You know, if you get something going, we would expect some kind of consideration -- a little taste
No, this is a legitimate business
(shudders) Oh, Paul
just got a chill
just want to be left alone
Put my life back together -- straight  up this time
Put the word out, will   ya
Nobody's got nothin' to worry  about from me
Sure, Paul
understand
He heads for the door
48
(calls after him) Don't be a stranger
After Vitti leaves, Eddie enters from the other door
(turning to Eddie) Watch him like a hawk
If he steps out of line, it would break my heart, but shoot him in the fuckin' head
: - Vitti is trying to sell an $80,000 Audi to the MacINERNYS, an upscale middle-aged couple
Vitti opens the trunk
Look at the size of that trunk
You could fit three people in there
(off their shocked looks) Not people -- suitcases
It's a joke
The MacInernys laugh uncertainly
So what are you driving now
MacINERNY We have a Lexus
(nods) It's a fancy Toyota, right
The Japs make good cars, but  ain't that quick to forget Pearl Harbor
The MacInernys look doubtful
: '   - crowd of well-heeled New Yorkers surround Vitti at the captain's station
Vitti, the new host, greets a prominent sports figure who embraces him like an old friend
(signals the  ') Mario, put Mr
Torre at table five
, an old acquaintance of Vitti's, enters with a couple of his cronies
49
Paul,  heard you were out
Hey, Joey
All dressed up for dinner, huh
Yeah
The Maitre ' crosses away and waves at Vitti
' Paul, that table for six is ready
You can send them back
You're working here
(dying) Nah -- not really
It's like -- 'm on parole, so  just --  come in, greet people
Joey and his friends nod condescendingly
Okay
get it
Nice seein' you, Paul
Don't want to hold you up
You got people to seat
Joey and his guys walk away, they turn back and glance at Vitti, then whisper something in audible to each other and laugh
Vitti burns, humiliated
: Vitti poses for a picture with some notables
: Vitti with some Broadway actors
: PH0TO 50
Vitti poses grimly with a  and his friends
Thanks, Paul
Appreciate it
Vitti moves to leave
Hey, could you get us a big bottle of Pellegrino and another round of drinks
He slips Vitti a couple of bills
Vitti stares at the money in his hand
And more bread when you get a chance
You want more bread
He takes a small loaf from the breadbasket on the next table, stuffs it into the Businessman's mouth and walks off
'll get your drinks now
: - Two Hassidim are in the back of a 47th Street jewelry store, sorting through a huge pile of diamonds
Behind the    display counter, Vitti stares at the diamonds, breathing    hard, starting to perspire
His customers, a thirty-ish      and his , study the diamond engagement    ring on her finger
This stone is supposed to be a '' color, but it looks kind of yellow, doesn't it
(distracted) Fluorescent light
Makes everything look yellow
He starts instinctively casing the store
: 51
thought fluorescent light makes everything look blue
: - bound and gagged
(sweating) What am  -- Edison
'm telling you, it's a '
' He glances at the surveillance cameras
Can  look at it with a lens
: - - the camera lens and clipping the alarm wires
(completely distracted) What
lens
Do you have a lens
: - in the back as it
Ben's cousin, approaches Vitti who is now hyperventilating
52
Are you all right
'm gonna do us both a big favor quit
: - The MacInernys are trembling
You want to see the manager
(grabs his crotch) Here's the manager
Now take a hike, you fuckin' deadbeats
The MacInernys rush out of the showroom
(calls after them) Get a Hyundai
: -
'  - Vitti is on the sofa
He's wearing a shiny, silk, short- sleeved shirt with the sleeves turned up, tight, black chino pants and short, black, pointy-toed boots
His hair is oiled and coifed like early Frankie Avalon
(distraught) can't deal with this shit
My grades suck, 'm gettin' in fights every day, and if  get suspended again my mother's gonna fuckin' kill me -- if the nuns don't kill me first
is listening to Vitti, but dressed as Sigmund Freud
(nodding) Eins, zwei, drei
What
'  is sitting next to him
53
' (elbows him) Sit up straight
Pay attention when the doctor talks to you
This is costing money
Ben (Freud) has a large    away beside him
Ma
What are you doin' here
() (snorts some cocaine) Acht gemacht gehunden nicht
' tell him the same thing
Suddenly, the  are  by
open, flying off the hinges
Jelly enters, pushed into the room by a gang of thugs, led by Patty LoPresti, Eddie DeVol and his guys, all at least ten-feet-tall and all holding huge guns
leaps to his feet and reaches for his gun, but instead pulls out a long sword
Confused but desperate, he holds up the sword to menace the intruders, but the sword suddenly goes limp
He tries to make the blade stand up, but it just keeps dropping like a piece of soft rope
Patty, Eddie, and the thugs laugh contemptuously at Vitti, while Jelly looks on with an incredible stream of tears pouring from his eyes
: - Vitti is back in bed in his robe, still asleep
The door opens and Laura enters with an interior decorator who has fabric samples over her arm
Now in here,  thought we'd get rid of the wallpaper and maybe put in some wainscoting -- She sees Vitti and quickly steers the decorator back outside
54
(to decorator) Don't look, don't look
She comes back in, closes the bedroom door and confronts Vitti who is still groggy from his troubling dream
Do you realize it's almost noon
Really
Do me a favor, honey -- make me a sandwich
You want a sandwich
Make it yourself
'm not afraid of you, Mr
Oh-'m--Great-Big-Mobster Man want you out of my house
(') 've had   it with the bathrobe and the skulking   around and the girlfriend who, 'm   sorry, is so obviously faking it's not   even funny
Enough
Coulda had that sandwich made by now
(tries new tack) Okay
You don't like me and  don't like you
We can at least agree on that, right
Okay
'm going to be honest with you -- 'm a very anxious person -- Hey
Me, too
We have so much in common
Anyway, this is not helping me, it's not helping my marriage, and  know Ben really needs some alone time
So 'm asking you -- as a human being -- could you please leave
(off Vitti's look) Yes, 'll make you a sandwich
55
Ham, cheese, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, no onion
: - Jelly   comes out the front door with Vitti's suitcases as Ben pulls   into the driveway
He gets out of the car holding a small   bag from the drugstore and sees Vitti coming out the front   door
Ben stops him on the porch
(concerned) Where are you going
Where am  going
The orphanage found my real parents
They want me back
(to Jelly) Put those in the car
(to Ben) 'm goin' to Jelly's
Jelly carries the luggage to his car parked in the driveway
(to Vitti) The hell you are
You're supposed to be in my custody
We have therapy today
For what
The more we talk the worse get
had that dream again
The one where you're Mussolini
No, the other one
The limp sword dream
(at car) probably shouldn't be listening to this
So don't
Sorry
56
(to Vitti) Do you think this dream might be sexual
know what you're thinkin'
The sword is my cock and  can't get it up, but that ain't it
saw Sheila last night and  had a hard-on you could swing from
(winces) don't want to know that
You coulda hung wet towels on it
(calls out) He's like a racehorse in that area
Okay
get it
(to  Jelly) Wait in the  car
(to  Ben) So what does  it mean
Ben sits on the wicker divan
Sex can represent a lot of things
In your case  think it's about performance anxiety
Trying to find a job that fits
Doc -- nothing's gonna fit
That nine-to-five bullshit -- 'll fuckin' kill myself if  have to do that for the rest of my life
You know they take taxes out of your check
What the fuck is that
'm doomed
'm gonna end up selling hot dogs on the street
(starts breathing hard and sweating) Look at me
'm havin' a fuckin' panic attack here
My heart's beatin' like a rabbit
You're hyperventilating
57
He empties the drugstore bag and hands it to Vitti
Breathe into this
Vitti sits on a wicker chair
(speaks through bag) This is your fault
Excuse me
Tellin' me  have to get a job like 'm some fuckin' nobody
It was humiliating
Thanks a lot
(jumps up, in a total rage) Hey, 'm doing the best  can
If you can't appreciate that, or if my    best isn't good enough for you, then    maybe you should find somebody else to    talk to, you selfish prick
Ben breaks down and cries what amounts to one racking sob, then quickly pulls himself together
Sorry
What the hell was that
'm fine
'm grieving
It's a process
Ben takes a pill bottle out of his pocket and pops a couple of pills
Now what are you takin'
Echinacea and goldenseal
Do you know the  show 'Little Caesar'
Yeah,  know it
The producer of that show is a man 58
named Raoul Berman
mutual friend told him  knew you and Mr
Berman called me this morning
He wants to meet you
For what
Meet him and find out
: - Ben and Laura walk up to a trendy Japanese restaurant in Chelsea
Ben is really keyed up
We finally got him out of the house -- why are we having dinner with him mean, how professional is that
This is not social
Paul's meeting a television producer who might have a job for him
He's nervous and wants me here as a buffer
'm a buffer, that's all
He's a grown man
don't see why he needs a chaperone
He doesn't
He needs a buffer
'm here in buffer capacity only
Ben, if you say 'buffer' one more time -- Ben pops a couple of pills
Didn't you just take two of those
No, that was something else
Well, you better not drink anything
You know what happens
Laura
'm a doctor
think  know what 'm doing
59
Ben opens the door and motions for Laura to enter
(quietly, behind her back) Buffer
: - Cerrone and Miller watch the front of the restaurant
(into radio) They're all inside
We're going to get something to eat
We'll be back before they finish dinner
They drive off
: - Seated at a table are Ben and    Laura, Vitti and Sheila, Jelly, and the producer      and his uptight, downtown Jelly inspects a     piece of raw octopus, while Raoul gushes over a platter of    sushi and sashimi
adore this place
Best sushi in town
Have you tried the yellowtail, Paul
Raoul picks up a floppy piece of raw fish with his chopsticks
(makes a face) No
We gettin' any real food
This is like eatin' fuckin' bait
Raoul chuckles and glances uncomfortably at his girlfriend
Ben laughs loudly to cover the awkward moment
He's suffering from some reaction between the pills and the booze and he's oddly thick-lipped
Bait
That's funny
Honey, did you hear what Paul just said
He said this is like eating bait
(not amused) heard him
And  think it was 'effing bait
' 60
Why you talkin' like that
Like what
Like a fuckin' retard
(pointing to his lower lip) Oh -- this
took a couple ibuprofen before we got here --  shouldn't have had the saki
'll be fine
It only lasts a couple hours
(to Raoul) Rah-oo
Row
Rowl
guess you need both lips for that name
You know what  love about Paul
He was born without a filter
He says exactly what he's thinking -- just lays it right out there
He doesn't edit himself
(quietly) You wanna shut the fuck up
See
He just told me to shut the fuck up
No filter
love that
(to Raoul) Isn't he great
(aside to Ben) Too much buffering
Way too much
(eyeing Ben oddly) Yes
Paul, 'm such a huge fan of yours -- not a fan, but you know, an admirer
Don't admire me too much
Is there any chance you might be interested in working on 'Little Caesar' as a consultant
Give us technical advice, coach the actors, make sure the dialogue rings true -- 61
Wow
That would be incredible
Did you hear that, Paul
Raoul wants to know if you'd be interested in working on his show as a consultant
You know, give technical advice, coach the actors -- (quietly to Ben) In two seconds 'm gonna put a fork in your eye
(suddenly cowed) Got it
So what do you think, Paul
Yeah, sure, whatever
Fantastic
This is so exciting
Mr
Berman, love your show
Anthony Bella, the guy who plays Nicky Caesar --  think he grew up in Bensonhurst next door to my cousin's friend's husband
That's her claim to fame
(to Sheila) hate to bust your bubble, but he's not from Bensonhurst
He's a professional Italian
He grew up in Connecticut or something like that
Well, wherever he's from,  think he's a wonderful actor
Yeah,  bet he gets a lot of pussy
Laura chokes on her drink
What's the matter with you
We got women at the table
You said 'fuckin'
' 62
That's different
It's colorful
Hey, speaking of colorful -- this peacock walks into a bar -- Oh, my god
(to a passing waiter, rising her half-empty drink) Could  get another one, please
And one for me
No
No more for the Buffer
She glares at Ben as the table descends into silence
(tries a desperate save) So
see in the paper where Oklahoma
might win the Tony award
Vitti's eyes suddenly go wide
(shouts) Down
He grabs Sheila and pulls her down as  rakes the wall behind them
Everybody else at the table hits the floor
Other diners scream in terror
Jelly pulls a  and back
runs from the restaurant
After a long beat, the frightened patrons start to get up and chatter nervously
' Nobody's hurt
Vitti helps Sheila to her feet
(to Vitti) What the hell was that
think somebody's got it in for Raoul
63
Raoul crawls up from behind the table
(wide-eyed) Holy fucking shit
(grinning) That was phenomenal
: - Jelly stands in front of an apartment building parking garage
guy comes walking up the ramp toward him
As he comes nearer, we see that the guy is the Gunman from the restaurant
Hey, pal -- got a light
The guy stops, pulls out a Zippo and lights it for Jelly
Where's your cigarette
'm trying to cut down
The Gunman recognizes Jelly and desperately reaches for the gun in his pocket, but Jelly hauls off and whacks the guy across the back of the head with a sap
As  he slumps into Jelly's arms, Vitti steps out of a doorway and Jelly drags the gunman into the garage
: - Ben and Laura are getting ready for bed
don't know why you feel you have to save this man
It's my job
He needs me
So that automatically means you have to help him
You're always doing this -- putting other people's needs ahead of your own, like you're this martyr or saint or something
It's like living with Mother Teresa
64
Actually,  hear she was tough to live with
Lot of parties, loud music -- lepers
You don't need this in your life -- especially not now
You really need to be grieving for your father
am
Really
haven't seen it
Well, you know, it's a process mean, we had issues -- there's some anger -- but 'll work it out
Laura goes to Ben and embraces him
It's okay, honey
You can let it go
Ben almost starts to break, but he holds it back
No, 'm -- it's okay
Ben sits heavily on the bed
It's just a confusing time
became a therapist because he was a therapist, so obviously his approval was very important to me
But is that the only reason  did it
don't know
And now that he's gone, why do keep doing it
Is this what really want
She sits next to him and takes his hand
just want you to be happy
She kisses him
Maybe you're right
(kisses her) Maybe it's time  started focusing on me, and, you know, satisfying some of 65
my desires
He looks at her expectantly
(apologetic) Oh, honey,  just brushed my teeth
No, that's not what  meant
just need -- (at a loss) don't know what
She puts her arms around him and holds him
: - Vitti and Jelly stand with the Gunman on the roof of the parking garage, four stories above the ground
The guy's arms are bound
Jelly ties a rope around his ankles
'm gonna ask you once nicely
Who you working for
Fuck you
Fuck me
Fine
Jelly
Jelly shoves the guy to the parapet at the edge of the roof, grabs him by the legs and hangs him over the side of the building
The guy screams
'll ask you again
Who you working for
The guy keeps screaming
He's screamin' too loud
Hold on a second
Jelly swings the guy against the building, hitting his head and dazing him momentarily
Go ahead
Who are you working for
66
Nobody
Drop him, Jelly
Okay
Okay
Rigazzi
'm working for Rigazzi
Pull him back up
Jelly drops the guy
The Gunman plunges three stories and lands heavily in a dumpster full of garbage
What's the matter with you
You said drop him
said pull him back up
That's not what  heard
You heard what you wanted to hear
Okay, you got me there
: - "family" business in Jersey
: - The light from outside barely penetrates the painted windows of the shabby office
, aka "Lou the Wrench," the aging boss of the Rigazzi family, sits in the half-light as a couple of his soldiers enter with the battered and hobbling Gunman between them
What the hell happened to you
67
Vitti threw me off a roof
Vitti
You talked to Vitti
What did you say to him
Nothing
didn't tell him anything
Mr
Rigazzi, can go --  think my leg's broken
That must hurt
Rigazzi pulls out a  with a silencer and  the Gunman
hate to see people in pain
(to soldiers) Get him out of here
What about Vitti
(musing) He's a hard man to kill
But he's not immortal
Our time will come
: -   - big, family barbecue is going on in a back yard in Queens
Several children are splashing in an over-sized, above-ground swimming pool
Oddly, the children appear to be shouting and laughing but make no sound
At the barbecue, Nicky Caesar is watching his friend turn Italian sausage on the grill
like mine burnt
don't know how you like your sausage
Twenty fuckin' years we been doin' this
So you got the money
The wind shifts and blows the smoke from the barbecue in their faces
68
(coughing, eyes watering) Not all of it
'm still light about fifteen large
(blinded by smoke) Can we cut
This is ridiculous
(
) (shouts) Cut
Can you do something about the fucking smoke
We   to reveal the set of "Little Caesar
" Assistant directors and production assistants echo the director: "We're cut
" "Reset
" "Effects
" Vitti observes the action sitting in a director's chair, still brooding over the previous night's events
Raoul sits next to him
(to Vitti) This is the problem with shooting on location
But it's worth it for the authenticity
Yeah, this is real authentic
(calls out) Tony
Come here a second
(to Vitti) Anthony Bella
He plays Nicky Caesar
know who he is
They used to watch the show up at Sing Sing
(delighted) Are you shitting me
joins them
Tony, this is Paul Vitti
(Australian accent) You don't have to tell me who he is
(shakes Paul's hand) It's a pleasure, mate
69
(reacting to accent) Mate
don't believe this
You're an English guy
You ain't even Italian
Australian-Italian
We got some paisans down under
Down under what
(to Tony Bella) How incredible is this
Paul tells me they watch the show in Sing Sing
Fantastic
That's so fuckin' great
wouldn't wet my pants over it
They watch 'Supermarket Sweep,' too
Raoul laughs hard
You laugh too much
So, Paul, you going to join us
Vitti looks around, his future plans now beginning to form
Yeah
You got a good setup here
Great
See you later then
He exits
Vitti turns to Raoul
Coupla things, though
don't know who makes these decisions, but some of this, it don't look right
(concerned) sensed it myself
Which elements strike you as wrong
The people mainly
mean, you got a boss who speaks Australian
What the fuck is that
And 'm guessing your 70
background is -- what
The theater, mostly
Yeah, the theater
So how about if bring in some guys that  know -- you know, more 'authentic
' would be eternally grateful
Anything else
(thinks) Yeah
One of those trailers like the stars have
(slight hesitation) Done
(shakes his hand) 'll put that in the works right now
He hurries off to talk to his assistant
Jelly comes up to Vitti
You really gonna do this
No fuckin' way
've had it with this job bullshit
week of this and 'd either shoot myself or shoot Raoul
But it's good cover while  figure out my next move
Call the guys
You got it
: Jelly and Vitti's old crew, -, , ,  , and eight or nine other wiseguys walk en masse into base camp
Vitti's guys go to the front of the lunch line, forcing the crew aside
big, pop-out trailer labeled "Mr
Vitti," guarded by three of his guys
Tuna brings a lunch tray and knocks on the door
Jelly opens the door and takes the tray
Vitti conferring with Raoul and Tony Bella on the script, 71
ripping out whole sections
Vitti in the makeup trailer getting a haircut and manicure while he smokes a cigar and talks on his cell phone
Vitti with the costumer, approving and nixing various wardrobe choices, while Jelly steals an expensive watch in the b
g
Vitti in a massage chair getting a backrub from a masseuse
approaches him
( ) They're ready to start shooting, Mr
Vitti
Yeah, ten minutes, tell 'em
Eddie Devol, Patty LoPresti's guy, watches Vitti from a safe distance
: - Ben comes out of the market carrying several grocery bags and a small prescription bag
Two Mafia  step up beside him and urge him toward a big stretch   at the curb
Walk this way
There must be some mistake
didn't order a limo
Get in the car
: - Ben enters timorously, still carrying his groceries
Patty LoPresti, Masiello and a couple of other heavyweights are sitting at the table, all except Patti smoking cigars
Ben immediately recognizes their status and grasps the gravity of their mood
(nervous, but trying to keep it light) Hello
'm Ben Sobel
And you are -- 72
The Soldier sits Ben down
The other soldier takes his groceries
Ben looks at Patty, trying to gauge her role
You're the shrink who's taking care of Paul Vitti
Yes, sir
That's right
(to guy with groceries) Could you be careful, because  think they put the eggs on the bottom
He drops the bags heavily onto the bar
So
Is he nuts or what
Who
Paulie
Is he nuts
can't discuss a patient's case with anyone -- Discuss it
'd say he's still suffering from chronic anxiety and -- He hesitates
And what
We call it Antisocial Personality Disorder
Sociopathy
Meaning what
(very carefully) Meaning -- he -- fails to conform to societal norms with respect to -- lawful behavior
'm getting a fuckin' headache here
73
What are you saying
He's got a -- criminal temperament
(stares at him) He's a criminal
This is news
And for that you need a doctor degree
So what are you doin' with him
Well, 'm trying to at least show him the possibility of change -- Wrong
You do not want him to change
Ben looks at her, sensing her command of the group
We haven't really been introduced -- This is Mrs
LoPresti
Patty
Ben Sobel
Ben offers his hand but she ignores it
Ben, Paul Vitti is important to this family
We don't want to see you turn him into a stromboni
stromboni
That thing they clean the ice with at hockey games
That's a Zamboni, asshole
Stromboni
It's a bull with his balls cut off
She reaches under the table and grabs Ben's balls
He winces in pain
(squeezed) No, we don't want to do that
74
Not unless you want to be one, too
(in pain) Me
No
'm very attached to my balls
As you can probably tell
(lets go) Then do the right thing, understand
(greatly relieved) Yes,  understand completely
May go now
have perishables -- He takes his groceries and edges away
: " "  - Vitti is sitting at a table with Jelly and some of his main guys
From a distance it looks like they're playing cards
Up close it's a different story
We're gonna need a grapple or a crane with maybe a fifty-foot boom
- seen one -- in Bayonne -- but 'll call around
See what you can come up with
And we're gonna need a city bus
got a guy in the Transit Authority
He owes me
Just let me know when
(
) Paul
Hello
Vitti turns to see Patty, Eddie Devol and his men heading across the set
guess everybody's gone Hollywood, huh
How you doin', Patty
75
Jelly -- you're working here, too
'm an extra
An extra what
supernumerary
An 'atmosphere
' It ain't bad
You just stand around all day waitin' for them to shoot and they pay you eighty bucks
Eighty bucks
For standin' around all day
You used to sneeze eighty bucks
How much you make shootin' craps
Today
About eight hundred maybe
And how about bookin' bets for the Teamsters and the crew
Another grand
One of the producers really likes the ponies
So eighteen hundred bucks
Plus eighty -- know -- extra
They all laugh
An   approaches the group
This is a closed set
We're about to start shooting
Yeah
So am
Eddie grabs the Assistant Director and walks him away
: " "   - 76
The trucks and trailers are arranged on a parking lot
car pulls up and Lou Rigazzi gets out with his bodyguards
Should  wait here, Mr
Rigazzi
No, pull the car up your ass and wait there
: - Patty takes Vitti's arm and walks with him
heard you had some more trouble
One of Rigazzi's guys took a shot at me
She stops at the extras' makeup table and starts primping in the mirror
don't have to tell you, Paul
Alone on the street you don't stand a chance
That's what the family's all about
Since the old days, when the grandfathers first came over
That's not something you just walk away from
Yeah,  know
When you're a Jet, you're a Jet all the way
So you want to tell me what's going on here
It looks like you got your whole crew back together
Nothing's going on
They're actors
Don't bullshit me, Paul
You're planning something
'm feeling very left out
(quietly) Okay
Something big is going down, but you're getting a cut
My hand to God
77
You're a good friend, Paul
And would never think of insisting on this, but 'd feel better if you brought in Eddie and some of my guys to help with the job
don't think so
Then 'll have to insist
Whatever
Raoul approaches and eyes Patty disdainfully
Oh, dear God
First of all, sweetheart, we're not shooting the hooker scene until tomorrow
And the hair -- please, what is that
Excuse me
Raoul, this is a friend of mine
Patty LoPresti
Raoul freezes, recognizing the name
Mrs
LoPresti --  am so very, very Raoul wheels on a production assistant who happens to be passing by
How dare you not inform me Mrs
LoPresti was on the set
You're fired
(to Patty) Enjoy your visit with us
If there's anything  can do -- Go fuck yourself
Immediately
Raoul moves away quickly
Patty turns back to Vitti
It's good to have you back, Paul
78
(kisses Vitti on the cheek) We'll be in touch
She exits
: - As Patty and her men walk away down one aisle of trucks and campers, Rigazzi and his men walk down the next aisle heading for the set
They narrowly miss seeing each other
: - Ben arrives looking for Vitti
He       sees Patty approaching and freezes, then quickly ducks behind      a nearby truck, shielding his crotch
Patty and her men pass       by
Ben waits until they pass, then comes out of hiding and      hurries on
: -  - mildly-distraught Raoul is huddled with Vitti
mean, tell me -- was she angry
Am in any danger
No, you're fine
But you might want to have somebody else start your car the next couple of weeks
'll have Brian do it
He's new
Rigazzi and his men join them
(to Vitti) Could  talk to you for a second
(eyeing Rigazzi) Oh, what is this now, the bus and truck tour of Guys and Dolls
This is Lou Rigazzi
79
Raoul freezes
(a horrified whisper) 'The Wrench
' (') (taking Rigazzi's hand) Please, forgive me
'm on painkillers -- half the time  don't know what 'm saying
Raoul kisses Rigazzi's hand
Rigazzi yanks it away
Get lost
Certainly
(as he exits) Brian
Get my car
(to Vitti) need a couple minutes
(nodding) This way
: - Vitti and Rigazzi stand at the table
Rigazzi's soldiers are nearby
The guy who shot at you -- he was acting on his own
never gave an order
Is that right
And he's been taken care of
There won't be another incident
Unless you're thinkin' of workin' for Patty LoPresti
Me
No
Good
Then  got no beef with you
80
Thanks
'll sleep much better
Because   that would not be the way to go
You    want to back a winner, which is gonna   be me
It only makes sense
You come   work for us
'll treat you right
don't think so
(a beat) Well, so much for sleeping better
Rigazzi smiles and pats Vitti's cheek, then exits with his soldiers
: - Ben walks in and sees Vitti's guys sitting around
Hey, Dr
Sobel
Jelly, hi
(recognizing some of the others) Hey
Yo-Yo
It's Mo-Mo
Right
was thinking of the cellist
How's it going
- Goin' good
did a 'Law and Order' last week,  had a line on 'Sex and the City' -- 'm up for a recurring on ' Blue
' That's great
Have you seen Paul
Yeah,  think he's in his camper
81
His camper
: '  - There's a loud  on the door and Ben storms in
(surprised to see him) Hey, Doc
What are you doing here
No, what are   you doing here
came to tell you   we have a preliminary meeting with   your parole officer and who do  run   into
Patty LoPresti
Patty who
What is this -- a knock-knock joke
Patty-who-kidnapped-me-and-threatened- to-cut-off-my-balls
Stop lying to me, Paul
Your whole gang is here
Who says 'm lying
finally    get a straight job and start putting   my life in order and you come in here   and start accusing me
That's how    much you trust me
(off   balance) It's not that    don't trust you, just don't --   trust you
Are you lying to me
Because  know you, Paul
You'll    say or do anything to get your own   way
This is what's so hard about being an ex-con
You make one little mistake in your life and people never let you forget it
Oh, so now you're the victim
want the truth
Wait a second
Say that again
82
Say what
' want the truth
'   Say it -- like you did just now
want the truth
No, strong, like before
(forceful) want the truth
Yeah, that's good
Paul -- No, 'm serious
That had power believed it
You could be an actor
'm not an actor -- Hey, you're as good as most of the bums  see around here
They have this part
You could do it
Actually,  did The Music Man in tenth grade
Of course
'm gonna talk to Raoul
About being on the show
couldn't - No, this part you could do
It's perfect
Believe me
: -  () The camera rolls
83
We're rolling
Sound speed
(shouts) Action
Jelly and Tony Bella drag Ben kicking and screaming to the edge of the roof and hang him over the edge
On the ground, Raoul and Vitti look up, watching the action
(doubtful) Does that screaming sound real to you
Oh, yeah
That sounds real
: '  - Ben drives, pissed off
Vitti chuckles to himself
It's not funny
There was no safety harness or anything
They could have dropped me
Hey, if you didn't want to do it, why didn't you say something
know exactly what that was about
You resent the fact that you've been put in my custody, so you passive- aggressively arranged things to make me look like a fool
Come on -- you were great
(turning on a dime) Really
was scared at first, but on the second take,  think  found some good stuff
was able to texture the screaming -- 84
Vitti is laughing
Oh, screw you, Paul
Just screw you
He pops two pills
What, are you self-medicating again
And don't give that decongestant multi-vitamin bullshit
Don't worry about me
Just worry about what you're going to say to this parole officer
What are you going to say
That you've moved out of my house
That you've got your old gang back together
For what, a high school drop-out reunion
'm gonna say that's none of his fuckin' business
It's my business
want to know
'm a federal institution
(checks side- view mirror) You recognize that car
Which car
The one that's been following us the last mile and a half
Ben jerks his head around to look and sees a black Mercedes behind him
Lose 'em
What do you mean, 'lose 'em'
Vitti stomps his foot down on Ben's, flooring the accelerator
: - 85
Ben's car speeds up suddenly
The black Mercedes behind him speeds up, too, as does a third car that has joined the chase
: '  - Ben is on the edge of panic
Maybe  should just pull over
It could be the
No, they're two cars back
You gotta be a little more observant, Doc
Turn left
Ben executes a hard,  left
The Benz stays right with him
What if we just stop and get out
They're not going to shoot us in broad daylight
Broad daylight's the best time
You can see better
Take a right
Now
- Pedestrians scatter as Ben makes a sudden turn into a bank drive-thru
He over-steers and wipes out an  machine, sending up a cloud of bills that flutter down like confetti
Sorry
follows right behind him, then the bystanders run to pick up the cash, blocking the drive-thru, forcing Miller in the car to stop
: - Two police officers are parked at the curb
They hear a , and turn just as Ben's car comes flying past them
The cops start to pull out but stop short as the Benz blows 86
by, swerving to avoid hitting them
The cops take off in hot pursuit
: '  - (frantic) We can't do this, Paul
We have to stop
This is a lease
the rear  of the car
(shouting back at the Mercedes) It's a goddamn lease
(looks back) Move over
'll drive
Move over
Where
Vitti puts his left foot on the gas pedal and his left hand on the wheel
Backseat
Now
Ben tries to launch himself into the backseat but is stopped by his seat belt
Seat belt
He releases the belt, then twists and crawls over the top of the driver's seat into the back, while Vitti slides into the driver's seat
: - Ben's car races past an industrial area with the Mercedes right on its tail
: - Ben's car bounces over some railroad tracks and sails into a warehouse complex on the river with the Mercedes still only a few car lengths behind
87
: '  - Vitti drives down the narrow lane between two big warehouses
(determined) Hang on
It's gonna get worse
: - Vitti rockets out from between buildings and races through a parking lot toward the river with the Benz on his tail
: '  - They're right behind us
(shouts at them) Get away
He starts whipping things out the shattered back window -- a tennis racket, sneakers, an empty Macy's box
: - is crushed under the Mercedes' wheels
: '  - Ben picks up the only thing left -- the New York Times
He starts leafing through it
What the fuck are you doing
wanted to save the crossword
Throw it
Bent throws the paper out the window
88
: ' The Times hits the windshield and one double-page sticks, totally  the driver's
- Vitti throws a 180,  to a stop just inches from the river's edge
The Benz, with the newspaper covering the windshield, sails past them and right off the embankment
It seems to hang in the air for a long time, then lands with a big splash and starts to sink almost immediately
They jump out of the car and watch the Mercedes disappear under the water
(aghast) You think they'll get out
Yeah, that's James Bond and the 'Sea Hunt' guy in there, so they got a pretty good shot
They hear
Vitti starts walking away quickly
Ben follows after him
Where're you going
gotta take care of something
But your parole officer -- Send my regrets
'm warning you
If you leave now -- So long, Doc
Vitti takes off running, ducking behind the rows of parked cars
89
(calling after him) That's it
'm finished
You're on your own now, pal
'm -- and the    into the parking lot and surround Ben
(quietly) -- screwed
: - Police divers search for the sunken Mercedes in the middle of the channel
On shore, Ben leans against a government car looking tired and distraught while Chapin berates him
Where is he, Dr
Sobel
wish  knew
Well, considering that he's in your custody, that's not quite the answer was looking for
He's got something big in the works
You want to tell me what you know
don't know anything
As far as can tell, he's making a real effort to go straight
Yeah, that's why 've got two corpses at the bottom of the river
He reaches through the open car window into his briefcase and pulls out a file of photographs
Here
Vitti with Sal Masiello
Vitti with Patty LoPresti
Vitti with Lou Rigazzi
Let me know --  can order some wallet size for you
've got more than enough to put him away again without these
Violation of parole, second-degree murder here
When really start digging, it'll be amazing 90
what  come up with
You have twenty- four hours to find him and deliver him to me
Otherwise you're looking at obstruction of justice, and accessory to felony manslaughter
And trust me, Dr
Sobel, if you don't like me now, you really don't want to see me in court
'm getting that
Can  go now
He starts for his car
You can't take your car
We're impounding it as evidence
(exasperated) Then can somebody give me a ride home
Yeah, the government runs a limousine service
The number is 1-800-Fuck Off
Chapin walks away
: '  - Vitti is hurriedly collecting his stuff, talking to Jelly and a few of his old gang
don't have a lot of time
They're probably gonna come lookin' for me, so we'll go over everything later, okay
Paul, not that 'm questioning, but what do we want with Eddie DeVol
Guy's a fuckin' scumbag
Look, 'm not happy about it, but if it keeps Patty off my back, so be it
They're meeting us at the club
Let's head out
(as they all get up) Not all at once
gotta tell you everything
and sticks her head in the door
91
Mr
Vitti
Mr
Bella asked if you could meet him in the makeup trailer
No,  gotta go
He said it was important
(annoyed) 'll talk to him tomorrow
He hands the
some money
Here -- tell him you couldn't find me
Vitti exits
The
looks at the money
: - Vitti makes his way past the trailers, heading for his car
As he passes the makeup trailer, the door opens and Tony Bella sticks his head out
Paul
Excellent
Can't really talk right now, mate
Headin' out
Two seconds
Please, Paul
It's really important
Vitti looks pissed
: - Vitti watches impatiently while the makeup artist touches up Tony Bella
(script in hand) 'm looking for something to do when my character finds out he's being indicted
was thinking of punching the wall, but  did that when they killed Uncle Lenny, and  did it again 92
when Franny left me
Oh, and punched a car, a van actually, when Peezee screwed up the big drug deal
So 'd like to find something different, that doesn't involve, you know, punching anything
Try kickin' something
Let me know how it works out
Vitti starts for the door
Wait, Paul
That's interesting
Like what
(impatient) don't know
You could kick a guy in the face
Who
(irritated) Just some guy
You knock him down, give him a couple quick kicks in the head while he's on the ground
Why
Why not
Because he's there and you're pissed off
You've done that
Maybe once or twice
Look,  got people waiting
(thinks about it, decides not) My character wouldn't do that
What else
(at a loss, getting angrier) don't know
You could yell real loud
93
Yell real loud
That's original
(pops) Or keep your fuckin' mouth shut
Who gives a shit what you do, for cryin' out loud
Tony Bella likes something about Vitti's inflection
(imitates him) Who gives a shit what you do, for cryin' out loud
What are you doin'
What are you doin'
(irritated) Okay, you can cut that shit out right now
Okay, you can cut that shit out right now
(menacing) Hey, 'm serious, asshole
Hey, 'm serious, asshole
: - The door flies open and Tony Bella comes flying out of the trailer backwards, hitting the pavement hard
Vitti charges out of the trailer and storms away
Tony wipes blood from under his nose
That was good
My character could do that
: - cab pulls up to the house, and Ben gets out
94
He walks up the driveway and sees Jelly's car parked at the back door and a big man in a dark suit and tie wiping the windshield
(irritated) Jelly
Where's Paul
The guy in the suit turns
It's Michael
Michael
What are you doing
Working
(pleasantly surprised) You got a job
That's great
Look how handsome you look in that suit
What's the job
(reluctantly) 'm working for Mr
Vitti
'm his driver
Oh, no, you're not
You keep telling me to get a job
meant making sandwiches at the Subway, not driving a getaway car
He's paying me twenty dollars an hour
don't care if he pays you two hundred an hour, you're not doing it
Dad -- He had no right to ask you without my permission
Where is he
can't tell you
What do you mean you can't tell me
95
promised 'd never repeat anything heard in the car
took an oath
You took an oath
Oh, my God
Was there blood involved
Dad,  gave my word
Laura comes out of the house
Ben
Where've you been
What happened to you
(minimizing) was  in a car chase
There  was a little  shooting -- not that much really  -- then they -- drove into the river
It wasn't as bad as it sounds
When is this going to end
Tonight,  hope
just have to find him and -- Why
few days ago you weren't even sure you still wanted to be a therapist
Now you're going to risk your life again for that lout
Yeah, but he's an amazing lout, isn't he
can't quit now
You know that
(relents) Go
Just don't get shot -- please
love you
They kiss
Then Ben turns to Michael
All right, where is he
can't
96
(pops) You tell your father right now or 'll give you such a smack it won't even be funny
(surprised) Okay
dropped him at the club
What club
Little Darling's in Queens
Okay, Mafiaboy, give me your car keys
'm grounded
No, 'm borrowing your car
He kisses Laura again and takes off
: ' - Several limos are parked outside a family-owned nightclub in Queens
Ben pulls up, leaning way back in the driver's seat of Michael's, half-painted, modified '82 Honda Civic with the : - Ben takes out a bottle of pills
He tries to remove the child-safety cap but his hands are shaking so badly he can't do it
Frustrated, he tries to bite the cap off, then gives up and throws the bottle away
: ' - Ben enters the club
moment later, Cerrone and Miller cruise by in an unmarked car and park at the end of the block
97
: - Ben enters the nightclub and starts moving through the crowd, looking for Vitti
He pushes through and sees Jelly and a few of the guys watching an exotic dancer, a beautiful young blonde in a skimpy costume, standing on a platform grinding in mock ecstasy
Jelly
(yelling over music) Hey, Doc
What are you doin' here
Where's Paul
Jelly tucks a few bills into her -string
She looks at Ben and winks suggestively
think she likes you, Doc
Give her a couple of bucks
Ben reluctantly digs in his pocket and holds out a bill to the stripper
Can you break a twenty
The stripper sensuously fingers the top of her -string, and Ben gingerly sticks the twenty in it
Do  just make my own change
He tentatively reaches for some smaller bills in her -string but she dances away
(calls to her) ten and five ones -- when you have the chance
He turns around to talk to Jelly, but he's already gone
Ben finds Jelly at a table with Vitti
Okay, Paul, what's going on
98
(keyed up) What are you doing here
could ask you the same thing
What's it look like
We're just blowin' off a little steam
What's the big deal
Eddie DeVol enters, flanked by his main guys,   and How's it goin', Paulie
You know my guys -- Enormous Bobby and Al Pacino
(looks at him) Al Pacino
That's your real name
No
People call me that because look like Al Pacino
(beat) The actor
Anybody ever call you Carol Burnett
No
Why
'Cause you look about as much like Carol Burnett as you look like Al Pacino
Ben laughs
Al Pacino glares at him
do see a little Pacino there -- around the eyes
So we're all here
Let's do it
He heads for the back of the club with his guys
Vitti and Jelly start to follow
(stops Vitti) Let's do what
99
You better get out of here
(lays a hand on his arm) 'm not going until you tell me what's going on here
Vitti violently shakes off Ben's hand
(menacing) Don't make me hurt you
Get the fuck out of here
He walks away leaving Ben frozen
Ben watches as they disappear through a door leading to the back of the club
He starts toward the door
: - Vitti is seated at a big table in the crowded, smoke-filled room
Jelly sits at  his side
He's surrounded by his crew, about a half-a-dozen guys, and Patty's man, Eddie DeVol
Several street maps and diagrams are spread out on the table
Okay, this is big and we only get one shot at it; and there's only about a million ways this fuckin' thing can go bad, so listen up
Vitti pulls a street map to the center of the table and taps a spot downtown
The Federal Gold Depository in Lower Manhattan
Three times a year a shipment of gold bars goes in a heavily-guarded armored truck from the Depository to the vault at the Federal Reserve to hold for foreign governments that trade in bullion
At three o'clock in the morning -- eight hours from now --we're gonna hijack that truck
: ' - Ben enters the back room of the club, looks around, and starts down the stairwell leading to the basement
100
: - Ben makes his way down the cramped, dimly-lit stairway and approaches the door to the basement room
He raises his hand to knock, then hesitates and stands there for a moment listening to the   inside
Suddenly he is grabbed from behind and slammed up against the door by Enormous Bobby
Bobby slams him against the door a couple of more times, using Ben's head as a doorknocker
The door is opened by someone inside and Enormous Bobby shoves Ben into the room
: - Ben hits the floor to a chorus of surprised reactions from the guys
Enormous Bobby pulls Ben off the floor by his lapels
What the fuck is this
found this guy listening at the door
(dazed) Hey, guys
How's it going
Who is this guy
(not looking at Eddie) Ben Sobel
Sorry,  can't move my head to the right
Boy,  hope that's not permanent
Get rid of him
Al Pacino puts his gun to Ben's head
(still dazed) Hi, Carol
You're a dead man, asshole
Let's go
101
He starts muscling Ben to the door
What are you doing
What do you think
He can make every guy in this room
Oh, 'm not into that, fellas
Get your fuckin' hands off him
He's with me
What, on the job
Vitti hesitates
(impatiently) Either he's in, or he's dead
Which is it
think in is better
(reluctantly) He's in
He's my responsibility
(to Vitti) Okay, no more surprises
And from this moment on, no one leaves my sight
Got it
Now go through it one more time
Okay -- everybody listen up
Wait
(sits) Okay
Go ahead
: ' - Agents Cerrone and Miller watch the front of the club from their car parked across the street
102
(yawns, checks watch) wonder what it costs to keep that many limos waiting for three-and-a- half hours
dozen men looking like Vitti and his crew come out of the club and get into the limos
(
) Everybody stand by
They're leaving
The limos drive off
At the corner, the  car pulls out and follows at a discreet distance
: - The  car follows the limos across the bridge into Manhattan
: - The limos pull up at the  Restaurant
The  car stops up the block
(
) (over radio) 312, all units
Restaurant
Times Square
The limo doors open and the passengers get out -- all nondescript nobodies
: - Miller watches intently
Where's Vitti
don't see Vitti
Cerrone stares with the growing awareness that they've been had
Damn it
103
(grimly, into radio) Call it off
We lost them
: - Vitti's guys are dressed like construction workers as they load their gear into two trucks
Vitti supervises while others work on a New York City bus
Eddie DeVol, Al Pacino and Enormous Bobby stand guard over the whole scene, in case anyone is thinking of defecting
Ben is wearing heavy dungarees and an oversized plaid shirt, struggling to lace his work boots
Jelly approaches him and tosses a bulletproof vest on the table
Here
See if this'll fit under your shirt
(extremely nervous) could fit you under my shirt
Don't they have anything smaller
This ain't Bloomingdale's
Nobody knew you were comin'
You're lucky you're alive, Doc
He glances at Eddie DeVol
(hisses) Nobody's going to be alive when this is over
What kind of plan is this
It's crazy
It's stupid
Watch it
It may be crazy but it ain't stupid
If you want to stay alive, just keep your mouth shut, do everything  tell you and try not to pee in your pants
(quietly) Can you handle an -16
He holds up an automatic rifle
You mean shoot it
No,  mean twirl it like a fuckin' baton
How about an
104
He holds up another rifle
(exasperated) Jelly -- (rummaging through pile) Kalashnikov, -10, Uzi -- stop me if hit one you like
Ben sees Eddie watching him and gingerly picks up a 9mm handgun
Couldn't  just take this
Yeah, that's a good one
That gun brings back a lot of fond memories
Use it in good health
Ben puts the gun into the waistband of his dungarees, but it slips through and drops into his pants
(winces) Ooh, cold -- cold
He jams his hand down the front of his pants and starts searching around in there
Eddie and Enormous Bobby stare at him as they walk by
(explaining) My gun -- fell down in my -- He shakes his leg and the gun drops out of his cuff and clatters onto the floor
He smiles weakly and picks it up
Vitti approaches
He looks agitated but under tight control
(to Jelly) Check the bus
Jelly exits
(quietly, to   Ben) If we can, 'm gonna   get you out before the real shit   goes down
Just don't flip out on me,   okay
105
You are making a huge mistake
You know that, don't you
You said it yourself
It's my nature
It's not your nature
You have a choice
What are you, fucking Jiminy Cricket
don't know what planet you live on, but here on Earth it's 'might makes right
'   Read the papers
The guys with the guns make the rules
(holding up the pistol) So  guess that makes me a real man now
What happened to the white hat, Paul
Your father wasn't wrong
You could be one of the good guys
Enough
Say one more word about my father and 'll break your fuckin' head
(quietly) Okay
Vitti walks off
: - Vitti comes in, locks the door and has a full-blown panic attack -- gasping for breath, sweating, whimpering, trying to stifle his panic
Then he sees his tortured face in the mirror and starts pulling himself together
: - The guys are getting into the trucks
Ben keeps letting everybody go in front of him, then starts to back away, but Eddie and Enormous Bobby come up behind him and push him up into the truck
- 106
The big doors open and two trucks roll out carrying Vitti, Ben and the crew
: - The guys are sitting on the floor in the back of the truck, lined up along the sides like paratroopers waiting to jump
Ben is sitting next to Jelly and across from Vitti who is just staring intently
: - The trucks make their way past the aircraft carrier Intrepid heading downtown
: -  () Vitti, Ben, and Eddie DeVol stand next to the treads of a giant crane
(checks his watch) have five to three
They should start movin' any minute
(looking at his watch) have three-o-six
Let's see your watch
Ben slips it off and hands it to him
Vitti smashes it on a rock with the butt of his gun, then tosses it back to Ben
Vitti's   and the spotter's voice is heard
(
) (filtered) They're moving
Vitti keys his radio twice as a signal and holds up his clenched fist to alert the guys on site with him
: - of vehicles emerges from the bowels of the building and turns onto the street
In front and back are specially- equipped SUVs, full of heavily-armed federal marshals; an armored truck in the middle carries the gold
107
: - The convoy  past a block-long, high-rise construction site, totally enclosed by a plywood wall around the perimeter
He can hear the convoy passing outside the wall
He looks down on the convoy from a vantage point on a scaffold high above the street
When the trucks are in the right position, he waves to Vitti on the ground
sees the signal
(on walkie) Go
: - forty-foot, flat-bed trailer truck loaded with cement conduit backs across the street and stops, blocking the path of the convoy
The lead
The truck doesn't move
The  of the marshals gets out and walks up to the truck
The driver has slipped out the other side and disappeared
Suddenly, a huge steel claw drops down from above and closes around the top of the armored truck, its sharp points crunching into the metal sides
Then the truck starts rising off the pavement
couple of determined marshals jump out of their vehicles, race over and grab onto the bumpers as the armored truck is lifted off the ground
: - hundred-foot tower crane lifts the truck straight up
The marshals hang on as long as they can, then prudently let go and drop heavily to the street
Two marshals are still clinging to the truck as it rises to a height of thirty feet, then swings silently over the perimeter fencing
108
bank of arc lights is switched on illuminating the site as the truck is lowered to the ground
Heavily-armed gangsters in ski masks surround the truck and herd the driver, the shotgun guard and the frightened marshals into a construction shack, while men with acetylene torches attack the back doors
Vitti pulls down his ski mask and taps Ben
Paul, it's not too late
Don't do this
Let's go
He strides off to take charge
Ben pulls down his mask and hurries after him, but runs right into a pole
Shit
Ow
He raises his mask and scampers after Vitti rubbing the painful bump on his forehead
: - The marshals run around, frantically searching for a way into the construction site
: Totally in charge, he strides up to the armored truck just as his men finish cutting through the steel plate doors
Vitti yanks the doors open
Vitti and Ben stare in awe at the exposed contents of the truck -- a fortune in gold bars
(shouts) Get the ramp
Eddie and his guys run up with a long, narrow track with metal rollers and set it up at the rear of the gold truck
(very excited) You know, this might just fuckin' work
109
You're gonna get in so much trouble
: - The marshals are trying to climb over the construction site wall, but they're stopped by rolls of razor wire and from inside the site
They can't get over the wire
Then knock down the gates
: The guys take the heavy bars out of the armored truck and run them quickly along the rolling track into the bus
: - Jelly is pulling on the hat and jacket of a transit authority bus driver
The floor boards of the bus have been lifted out and the guys are laying the gold bars in the hollow under the floor
(pops his head in) Forty bars
That's all we need
How much is that
$350 an ounce, 16 ounces in a pound, 90 pounds in each bar -- do the math
(a beat) Actually, gold is measured in troy ounces
14
6 ounces to the pound
That would be
$18,396,000
Really
Give or take
He hears a   and all eyes turn to the gates
110
Well, so much for not peeing in my pants
Eddie goes off to help transfer the gold
: - The marshals back up one of the SUVs and run it into the gates again
: The big, wooden   but Vitti's men roll two enormous earthmovers up to reinforce the gates
You know what you said about not flipping out
Yeah
Sorry
(flipping out) What did  do
What did  do
had a perfect life,  threw it away
Don't do this
Vitti drags him off toward the building structure
can't help it
My life is over
'm going to jail
Some people can handle prison -- 'm not one of them
have delicate features
'm small
'll be way too popular
Calm down
can't calm down
'm gonna die
Inside the structure, Vitti spins him around and shakes him
You're not gonna die
111
can't breathe
'm suffocating
(shaking him) For Chrissake, get hold of yourself
can't
'm dying
We're all going to die
Suddenly, he slaps Vitti hard across the face
They both freeze
Did  just hit you
Yeah
Feel better now
(breaking down) 'm sorry, Paul
blame myself for this
wanted to help you
wanted to be there for you
But  just wasn't good enough
You were good
It isn't your fault
No, it is
Since my father died -- (starts crying) 've lost my way
don't know anything anymore
mean, what's the point
didn't think it would hit me so hard -- Would you just shut up about your father
'm grieving, goddammit
Have a little respect
He was an asshole -- you said it yourself
What are you grieving for
'm grieving for myself, you fucking idiot
Ben lets it all go, sobbing for all the years of pain
112
(surprised, shrugs) Jeez, 'm sorry
Now  know how you must have felt when your father was killed
Vitti looks at him
(crying more) mean, it had to be ten times worse for you -- being murdered right in front of you
And you were so young - We don't have time for this
(really sobbing) It must've been so painful
(eyes filling with tears) 'm warning you -- don't do this -- mean, it's like all his hopes for you died with him
And that's so sad
(starting to cry) There  go
You happy now
You see what you're doing here
Both men are crying now
Your father really loved you
loved him, too
did
(hugs him) know
know
Jelly comes around the corner and sees the two men in a weepy embrace
Oh, boy
This is bad
113
Another huge  as the marshals ram the gates again, this time tearing loose one of the big hinges
Maybe we oughta should go
Vitti, Ben and Jelly run to the bus, but Eddie pulls a gun and stops them
Al and Bobby cover Jelly and the rest of the crew
Vitti backs away slowly
Did you really think you were gonna live through this
had my hopes
Yeah, well, nice work
Mr
Rigazzi will be very grateful
(to Vitti) Rigazzi
thought he worked for Patti LoPresti
That's what Patty thought, too
This scumbag's been playin' both sides against the middle
There's only one side as far as 'm concerned
Mine
What did you think
was just gonna stand by and let some fuckin' has-been move back in
So long, Mr
Vitti
He cocks the gun and is about to pull the trigger when Ben suddenly roars and slams him in the head with his gun
Vitti and Jelly quickly cover Al Pacino and Enormous Bobby
(beating the shit out of Eddie) can't take it anymore
That's what hate about you fucking sociopaths
You just keep changing the rules to suit yourselves
Well, not this time, you anti-social asshole
You fucked with the wrong shrink
Sitting on Eddie's chest, he presses the gun against Eddie's nose
Don't you read the papers
The guy 114
with the gun makes the rules
Yeah, what
They shove Eddie, Enormous Bobby and Al Pacino into the back of the armored truck, Vitti gives a signal and the crane lifts it off the ground
: - The armored truck comes down fast and drops heavily to the street
Federal  swarm the truck and find Eddie, Al, and Bobby sprawled in the back
(screaming) On the floor
Face-down
Now
(to Eddie) Nice goin'
Good plan
What's a sociopath
The marshals handcuff them
Suddenly, the marshals hear    coming from the next block
Uniformed   come running from that direction and shout to the marshals
They're escaping out the back
Get over there
Move it
The marshals rush toward the sound of the  and disappear around the corner
: As the marshals round the corner, they see a police shoot-out in progress
Wiseguys are    at cops who are pinned down behind police cruisers
The Captain of the marshals  a warning  in the air
(on a bullhorn) Freeze
Drop your weapons
115
The head wiseguy, Anthony Bella, turns in surprise
What the hell is this
(
) (on his own bullhorn) Cut, cut, cut
What the hell's going on
Raoul strides out into the street, furious, still talking through his bullhorn
(to the Captain) Who are you
What are you doing in my shot
The Captain and the marshals look around and see that they're on the set of "Little Caesar
" What are you doing on my street
The Captain walks toward Raoul until they are almost face to face, shouting at each other through their
have a permit
don't give a shit about your permit
The   addresses the  crew
All right, people
Back to one and let's try it again
(into his walkie-talkie) Release the traffic and reset for another take
On the perimeters of the set, the 's signal the off-duty cops who work the set to release the real traffic they've been holding on the cross streets
city bus passes behind Raoul and Tony Bella who are still screaming at the Federal Marshal
: 11TH  - In mid-block,  cops step into the street and wave the bus to a halt
116
: - Ben is sitting in the back with Vitti as the helmeted cops board the bus
(sees them coming) That's it
We're screwed
The cops walk toward the back and confront Ben
You
Yes, Officer
You're one tough shrink
The cops unmask
It's Mo-Mo, Cokes, and Tuna
They laugh and slap hands with Vitti and Ben
: - The bus pulls out and joins the flow of traffic heading downtown
: - All the guys are looking pretty happy with their score
Ben turns to Vitti
Feeling pretty good, huh
felt worse
So what now
You go on the run for the rest of your life
Back to Sing Sing
Or you turn up dead in an alley
Those are my choices
What   happened to lying on a beach in Costa  Rica for the next twenty years
You can't let me enjoy this for  five fuckin' minutes
117
Five minutes
And then what
And then what
'll show you
: - Rigazzi company van is forced open by a team of  agents led by Agent Miller
Stacked inside are forty gold bars
Agent Cerrone comes out of the building with Lou Rigazzi and several associates in handcuffs
Attorney Chapin makes a statement to the media
Acting on intelligence we developed in the last few days, the Justice Department and the
took very aggressive action to recover the stolen gold and bring the perpetrators to justice
'm happy to tell the people of New York that the streets are safe again
: '  - Vitti knocks on the front door
Patty answers it in her robe
Hi, Paul
How'd it go
Not so good
Yeah,  heard
It's all over the television
never should've trusted Eddie
But, you know, a woman alone in the world is very vulnerable
Yeah,  know
At least  don't have to worry about the Rigazzis no more
Thanks to you
told you --  just want to be left 118
alone
know
'll make sure
How about some breakfast
could make you some waffles and -- whatever else you want
She adjusts her robe, providing Vitti a quick peek
Can't do that
Patty smiles and shrugs
Well, if you ever change your mind -- (kisses him) Good luck, Paul
: - Ben is leaning against the railing gazing at the water when Vitti walks up
Did you see Patti
Yeah
(ruefully) Did she grab your balls
What kind of question is that
She's cool
She's just happy to have 'the Wrench' out of the way
Well,  talked to the
Attorney
Did he grab your balls
No, Paul, he did not grab my balls
He thanked me for tipping him off about the gold
And he said he won't be coming after you if you stay out of trouble
So what do you think
'm gonna go to Ohio -- get Marie and the kids -- then we'll probably disappear for awhile -- figure out all 119
this future stuff -- away from all the pressure
Good idea
Change is hard, Paul
But you did the right thing
Yeah, you, too
You hung in there
That took a lot of guts
Well,  just -- No, you were like an animal back there
just vented my displaced aggression No
'm telling you
You're a monster
saw the beast in you
'm not a beast
can handle myself if  have to -- Handle yourself
You were fuckin' John Wayne
Well,  wrestled a bit in high school -- 122 pounds
Yeah,  could tell
You're good, you
'm not -- Paul,  just -- No
You are good
You got a gift, my friend
Ben gives up
Fine
have a gift
So -- happy ending, huh
120
Well,  think so
Don't you feel better now
Are you kidding
feel like shit
All that work for nothing
20 million bucks
You're grieving -- it's a process
Take it easy, Doc
You, too, Paul
They embrace
Then Vitti starts to walk away toward Jelly who has been waiting at a respectful distance
Vitti stops and turns
Hey, Doc
(sings) 'There's a place for us -- ' (sings) ' time and place for us -- ' (joins in) 'Hold my hand we're halfway there -- ' 'Hold my hand and 'll take you there
