very slowly
The sparkling surface turns out to be a lot of   carats
the stone, then the ring, then suddenly,   in b
g
, something by
a mechanical    claw above the ring, hanging from a crane
The ring    sits in a sea of tiny dolls, joke eyeballs, and other   carnival junk
The claw descends on the ring again and again, sometimes catching it for a moment then tragically dropping it -- accompanied by  and  (
) of hope and disap- pointment
with the  of a young black man working the controls
The  of a young black woman watching him work
Another guy's  digging in his pocket for change
going into the slot
'  (
) This'll never work, Tommy
(
) Be positive, Armando
Course it will
The claw inadvertently snags a rabbit's foot
(
) Look
See what a lucky fuck  am
'  (
) He don't mean the ring, hon, he means the whole plan
(
) So do
The claw catches the   ring and closes on it of their  as the   crane rises

Their apprehension
Tommy's confidence
Then his exceptional smile
He gets the ring

Loretta pulls a Mont Blanc pen and a checkbook from her bag
No, honey,  don't think you do, we just got in last night from our place in Barbados -- how much is it
Five hundred a person

After all, so many guests, so few of me -- who knows when  may be back
Sure, why not

It's just over there

So how the heck are you, Olaf
should be asking how you are, congressman
Johnson pats his chest and smiles at Vera
This old ticker never felt better
It's good to see you back on your feet, Jeff
We need you in Washington

Pyramid Insurance doesn't want special breaks

can you describe the ring
It's a diamond ring

calm down
Now, is the ring insured
Of course it's insured
But you know how it works -- if  report it, they'll cancel me
And  don't want another ring
need this ring
The ring Carlos gave me
Bruno turns, speaks into the walkie-talkie he's carrying
Where the fuck is housekeeping
called for those dickheads ninety seconds ago
11       the Guests have gathered to hear      11 Johnson speak
As Andersen introduces him, Tommy con- tinues eyeing Loretta
Now  won't run through Jeff's record -- he's been in Congress twenty years, and 've only got two minutes
'll just say this: When those of us in pharmaceuticals, or agribusiness, or insurance, or (indicating himself) utilities, or you name it -- when we've needed him, Jeff's been there for us
And we've been there for Jeff, too -- we raised a hundred thousand dollars today

Good luck, Ms

She leaves

What do you make of all this campaign reform business, Jeff
Well, y'know Ernie
these days, everyone's down on the political action committees and so-called special interests
But, heck, think you and Fran have a right to participate in our democracy in exactly the way you're doing today
'm in Congress to represent you
don't want any so-called reform to take that power away from you

Bruno issues orders to     14 two Maintenance Men

Now a valuable diamond ring is mising
Valuable
We can almost see the light bulb click on above Bruno's head
Very valuable
All right, 'll give you a hunnert bucks for it
hundred and five
Bruno snorts agreement, goes for his wallet
Tommy goes gor the ring
then suddenly leaps back in a cringe
No
It's a trick
You will call me a thief and send me back and the Security Police will make me stand on my head in the guano pit

Jesus, 'm not trying to trick you

a valuable ring is missing and there's thousands of dollars in reward money waiting
So you'd better fork over
How big is this
reward
Another lightbulb
Um, five hundred dollars
You said 'thousands

Right
thousand dollars
No, no, no
you said thousands
With an ''
This is plural
This means "two or more thousands

Two thousand
Or more
Two or more
Bruno's had enough -- his grip tightens around Tommy's neck
Just making a point

Can  take a message
(smiling to himself) No, thanks, 'll call back
hangs up the phone and exits the hotel room
crosses to the far side of the lobby, where Tommy waits inconspicuously
He gives him the money
Tommy gives him ring
Now get back to work
As Tommy heads back to the function room, Bruno picks up a house phone, dials, listens
He dials again, listens
No answer
He dials the operator
This is Bruno in Security
Put me through to 502 -- there must be something wrong with the line,  can't get an answer
What do you mean, there's no one in 502
just spoke to them
No one's registered in 502
Are you sure
Well, check again
Shit
He hangs up, looks at the ring, and realizes he's been taken
His face twisting with rage, he hurries after Tommy

But from another direction, Johnson and Andersen approach, arm in arm, and sit on a bench by the pillar
Olaf, there's something  wanted to sound you out on
As a special friend
Shoot
Tommy moves away from the pillar, sees Bruno roaming the terrace, and retreats
'm thinking of retiring from Congress
Andersen's eyes widen in astonishment
You're what
'm thinking maybe  won't run
Maybe  should listen more (indicating his heart) to this
Really appreciate these years
Sail around the world
Climb mountains
Enjoy the finer things of life
Jeff
Listen to me
You can't retire
Florida needs you
need you
need you on rates
need you on regulations
need you on those environmental nutcases -- Olaf, if  retire this year,  get to keep all the money left over in my campaign treasury

Bruno has gone
But Tommy stays
His eyes light up at the money
Come on, Jeff
Look at what you'd be giving up
Going to the best resorts in the world and calling it "official business
" Golfing and skiing and fishing, and never picking up a tab
And, Jeff -- there's no aphrodisiac like power
You can have some of the most intelligent, attractive women in the country
You've got it made
Oh,  suppose that one-point-three may seem like spare change to the head of Gulf Coast Power, but to a country boy like me -- Okay, Jeff
get it
Look
There's a little software company that's about to go through the roof
Johnson smiles at the direction the conversation is taking
Tommy also smiling, in admiration at the transaction going down
few thousand worth of stock options would stand to make you quite a pile
As long as your blind trust buys them, you're clean -- the  can't shake a stick at you
Half a million, easy -- and that's just a start

Turns out a lot of schools are near power lines
The land's cheap, so the schools tend to buy it from the power companies in the first place
But isn't the school district responsible
We asked the superintendent to measure the magnetic field inside the school
He said, Okay, only it'll cost forty thousand dollars, and what program did we want him to cut that from
Nice
We're nobody, congressman
You're somebody
We need your help
Tommy takes Celia aside
Do you believe it
It's impossible to know
No one's really looked into it hard enough

Listen, Tommy, why don't we just get Olaf's take on this
It's tragic, cancer's a terrible thing, but there's no way you can link it to power lines
Truth is, there's a bigger electromagnetic field given off by an electric blanket, or a microwave oven, than by those derricks
But there are studies that say -- For every study that says one thing, 'll show you a study saying another
We've studied it ourselves
Nada
There's not a single state health official anywhere in this country who says power lines cause cancer
But what if you're wrong
As Tommy persists, Andersen looks increasingly angry
People didn't use to say smoking causes cancer, either
What if the evidence is just building, and some day we wake up and discover that your power lines are killing us

Isn't that right, Mr
Andersen
Tommy flicks his eyebrows at Andersen, provocatively, imitating Dodge
That's a vicious lie
Dodge  sharply, turns to Tommy
Will the gentleman yield
That's not possible
You can't give anyone that kind of money
Dodge continues
Oh, yes, you can
As Mr
'Connor said to you, quote: "If that's what you want, we can always find a loophole
No one will know
" Remember saying that, Tommy
' do not
(standing) insist that the gentlemen yield
Tommy also stands, and produces a video tape
You can't deny it, Mr
Andersen
We have the whole thing on this tape
The room erupts
loves it
Still cameras and
despairs
puts his hand over his face
Yesterday, at Chairman Dodge's courageous suggestion,  taped the whole conversation
It's all there
Mr
Chairman,  thank you
The people thank you
America thanks you

gauges their reaction, gets an inspiration
The storm leaves his face, and becomes a smile, which he beams on Tommy
thank the distinguished gentleman
And  thank my fellow citizens
Our methods in this investigation may have been unorthodox, but together -- (indignant, at Andersen) we have exposed a canker at the very heart of democracy
Tommy is amazed at Dodge's survival skills
, delighted at the turn, claps heartily
, livid, leaps up and shouts at Dodge
You bastard
You set me up
Witness is out of order
You stood to make a million bucks off of me
Who offered you more
want to know
new  sweeps the room
'Connor tries to restrain Andersen, who sloughs him off
You're as big a whore as he is
catches Tommy's eye and mouths a question
Now
Tommy shakes his head:   no

-                  162 There's no loyalty any more, is there, Dick
What about the three hundred grand you squeezed from me for that goddam voter registration front of yours -- that just water under the bridge
'Connor tries again to restrain him
Don't touch me, you scum
mouths: Now
Tommy shakes his head again
No
What about the two hundred k for your phony foundation, Dick
How about the ten thousand copies if your goddam autobiography you muscled me to buy -- what's all that, ancient history
Andersen advances toward the dais, pointing now to six or seven other Members of the Committee among the total of 28
And you -- what about those bundled checks from my executives
gave you my condo in Vail
gave you my corporate jet to fly all over the world
gave your kids summer jobs
put up scholarships to put your kids through college
hired your goddam wife to redecorate my office
You telling me none of that counts for anything
Andersen grabs Dodge by the throat
thought you people were for sale
was wrong -- you're just for rent
Dodge struggles free of Andersen, who is dragged away from Dodge by Capitol Police

Everything 've done has been completely legal
(acting astonished) Mr
Chairman
You mean to say you did all that stuff
You took all that money
Shock in the room
Some
does a nice sends a little wave and smile to Celia
There's nothing 've done that -- (indicating other Members) -- that these gentlemen haven't done
Committee Members rush to dissociate themselves from Dodge
No
Not me
Just him never
He crossed the line
They're whores
All of them

Now
nods yes
Throw the bums out

She's touched a nerve
leaps into the moment
Damn straight
Throw the bums out

owed you one
Dodge wheels on Tommy, exploding
You lowlife hustler
Who are you to talk
You got into this House through fraud
You think  didn't check up on you
He pulls a piece of paper from the pile at his place
Ladies and   gentlemen,  have here some rather   startling revelations about this   Mr
Johnson before you
This man is   nothing but a con man
fresh  from the room
common grifter
(consulting paper) He's wanted in three counties for bunco
He's a convicted swindler
Some
emerges from his hole, encouraged
(
) fugitive from justice for card sharping, bookmaking, confidence games -- -- and other charges the  has only begun to investigate
dare you to respond
hush in the room
You know what
He's right
But let me tell you something --   all that's nothing, compared to   what pulled here in Washington
and this shit's all legit

Dodge  the gavel repeatedly
The gentleman is out of order
The gentleman is out of order
This committee is adjourned
leaps to her feet
Stop banging
Stop banging
That man has something to say
Massive
Dodge is stunned by the enormity of the sentiment against him
Adjourned
Fine
Leave
(indicating cameras) Turn your backs on the whole country
That what you want to do, gentlemen
The Members remain in place, paralyzed
(to the room) 'm a con man
small-time con man
Do you know what it was like for me to come to Congress
It was for like dying and going to heaven
If  did back home the kind of scams 've run in Congress, my ass would be in Sing Sing
But no, 'm not a crook -- up here, 'm a distinguished gentleman

Nobody
Nobody gets five hundred bucks an hour to lobby for the average Joe
There's no Shnook
There's no National Association for Ordinary Assholes
Sure, everyone's against cancer, but "everyone" doesn't have an office on  Street
(to committee Members) Don't you folks get it
We're supposed to be the people's lobbyists
Congress is supposed to be America's political action committee
and  of support
Several Members on the dais join the applause, seeing a winning issue
shakes her head in wonder
Tommy goes to Mickey and stands her up on a chair
She's right
Throw the bums out -- starting with me
'm gonna found me a new party
The Don't Vote For Me Party
Any of y'all want to join up
and  of enthusiasm
Well, come on, then
'mon, get up, we got work to do
The room erupts, electrified, chanting
Throw the bums out
Throw the bums out
Tommy is engulfed by people and lights
Dodge, Andersen, and 'Connor -- desperate, snarling -- are pinned to the wall by the  Press Corps
Loretta   watch Tommy bask in his new notoriety
That Miss Oprah's gonna love his ass

Tommy pulls it from his pocket, glances at it, and tosses it away
Why
bought it this morning
It's blank
As they continue down the steps,    to of the Capitol and the town beyond
