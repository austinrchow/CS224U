Written by Marti Noxon -- : Moving through a tract development
The houses are like Mexican food -- the basic elements are all the same, just mixed differently
gloomy night, no moon
And a slightly ominous pattern emerges
Green, thriving lawns and meticulously tended homes abut brown yards and porches littered with old newspapers and pizza joint flyers
Each third or fourth house is   or, worse, seemingly abandoned
This area is in danger of becoming a ghost town
deep, commanding voice pierces the silence: (
) Defy reason
Defy everything you know
Now we move in on one of the homes
Not the nicest on the block, but inhabited
Lights on in the windows
/ -- Inside the house
middle-class family lives here
The living room is empty, but the 's on
commercial for
Las Vegas institution, he's a magician whose show is all Gothic, horror-movie imagery
Peter's wiry, hot -- a rock and roll bad boy
He's cutting a girl up with a chain saw
And grinning like a mad man
Peter Vincent's "
" The family  is up on the coffee table eating what's left of a fast food burger and fries, still in the box
(') Something's moving in the dark

Also on the table -- a role-playing game in progress
"Magic, the Gathering"
Elves and Wizards
(') Only at The Hard Rock
Nightly Wednesday Through Sunday
Now we hear what at first sounds like a coming from another room
Get off her
More voices yelling, something being thrown
An ugly domestic scene
We creep down a dark hall toward a cracked door, light seeps through the opening -- it   and , 17, crashes toward us
He's nice-looking, a little nerdy -- and he's in a blind terror
We get a glimpse of the horrible scene behind the door teen girl's room -- the sound of flesh ripping
We see a pale arm on the ground, shaking violently, as if something is tearing and tugging at the body attached to it
We bolt away with , who we now see is blood splattered, as he races
is ripped out of the wall, which Adam nearly falls over
--  / -- '
Another horrible glimpse - - his mother's body splayed across her frilly bed
Blood on pale pink sheets
goes to his '     and now we see Adam's father's body
His father was reaching for   he'd hidden under the bed
gets down under the bed, desperately reaches for the gun
It's just beyond his grasp
Come on, come on, come on
He gets it
But the
Adam has to dig in his dead father's pockets for his keys
Adam starts to cry
3
(') Come on, come on
He finds them, struggles to unlock the gun with shaking hands
in one violent throw
Adam is exposed
We see only a hint of the creature that looms over -- Brutally strong, veins dark and visible under the skin
Human but not quite
Adam reacts in horror
He knows he's dead
's     as we hear: (
) we're looking at a nice day here in Clark County, hitting a season low of only 89 degrees
- starts under the   as we at the  suburban neighborhood as before
In the daylight it seems nice
Charming, even
Pocket parks decorate almost every corner and kids ride bikes in the street
Mothers unload groceries
Neighbors chat
(
) so get out there and enjoy this beautiful Wednesday, people
We   and find that  comes from a passing with those cutesy stick figure family decals on the rear window
The    and brown lawns don't seem nearly so foreboding now
We    and see beyond Shadow Hills, past the that encompasses it -- and become aware for the first time that the community is   ,
In the distance, we can just make out the glow of Las Vegas proper
It looks like a distant fantasy, a land-locked Pleasure Island

- : The wheels of a   as it zooms down the street
to see  , who is  the bike as fast as he can
It , sputters -- then craps out
(to the bike/pissed) You want me to take you apart, huh
Charlie's 17 and has the slightly awkward feel of someone who just recently came into his body and good looks
He's a wry, thoughtful kid who's enjoying -- but not quite trusting -- a sudden surge in popularity
(') (still talking to bike) will
'll sell you for parts
Don't think  won't-- Charlie stops, embarrassed
-- a neighbor -- watches him talk to his bike
Paused as she hauls her trash cans to the curb
She's super pretty in a wholesome way -- except for her ridiculous body
Stripper city
She nods to the bike, amused
Nothing doing, huh
The thing's got no ambition
(re: trash cans) Can  -- uh, give you a hand
got it
Thanks
She walks away -- her sweatpants have the word "" across the butt
He watches her go appreciatively
Doesn't notice his mom, , struggling to pull their own cans to the curb
Don't leer at the neighbors, kid
Jane, 40's, attractive and frazzled, wears a brokers blazer
Charlie wheels his bike back to the curb
5
He and his mom have had an affectionate, teasing relationship which has only recently started to have more edge
She's the one who put a word on her butt
'm just reading it
Jane eyes a      that sits in front of their   '
Is he ever going to move that thing
You need to get over it, Mom
( ) Attitude
(observes him/then) You've been tense or something
School
School's great, actually
Amy
Good
Hasn't dumped me yet
He says this like he's surprised
Jane nods
Getting it
That'll teach you to get so tall and handsome
() Getting what you want is stressful
Especially when you're not used to it
More to lose
Are you reading those books again
The Power of Whatever the Hell
She laughs
He glances at the
(') They're not working
You're still flipping out about a big box
6
Now Jane moves to the open garage and starts loading into her trunk
Charlie stands there
She shoots him a look -- then he helps her load
It's an eyesore
'm trying to convince people to move in, not join the legions leaving town-- If you say "mortgage crisis" again 'm getting a new mom
The guy moves in and puts a giant trash can in his yard
When the Perry's lived there-- Charlie has heard this before
It's a common refrain
The Perry's were the greatest neighbors ever
But they moved thought you were happy their place finally sold
(back on the neighbor) He's not digging a pool
Where do you think all that concrete's coming from
You're spying on the guy now
He's thirteen feet from our house
That's not spying, that's observing
pulls up
drives and her two hot friends,  and , sit in the back
Hi, Mrs
Brewster
Hi honey
Hi girls
, 16, is a stunner
And she's as cool as she is beautiful -- the girl every other guy in school would die to be with
7
But Charlie is
And he can't believe his luck
Which puts him off his game
She makes him feel like he's always playing catch up
Charlie moves toward the
Jane calls after him
(') Oh hey -- Ed called
Again
Okay
'm tired of making excuses, Charlie
If you don't want to talk to him, would you please tell him
Kinda defeats the purpose
He gets to  and the girls
Amy glances at the dirt bike
Still can't get the bike started, huh
Wow
No faith
So you don't need a ride
Amy calls his bluff and starts to drive off
Charlie grabs his backpack and  after her
No, hey, stop-- She laughs, stops the car
Charlie tries to jump in and she drives again
(') Come on
Hey
-- Charlie runs and finally dives into the back headfirst
The girls are laughing
Watching them drive off, gone in a cloud of teen spirit

/
'  -- The Beetle zips through a commercial strip
More suburban paradise
Charlie's in the front seat now
Amy drives, one hand on the wheel
Casually drops one on Charlie's leg
Charlie tries to act casual, but he's stoked and
amazed
Cara half-sleeps in the back while  leans forward, flirty, and eyes Charlie's
Charlie's a sneakerhead, a serious collector
Takes a man to wear purple, Chuck
Charlie
Chuck likes it when  call him Chuck, right Chuck
Intimidated by these girls, he tries to form a witty retort
It's -- they're not -- that's, like, puce
That's a macho puce
Can you stop someplace
'm severely under-caffeinated
(ignores her/to Bee) Did you see the poster for the formal
The theme is "Hope"
know
They asked me to be on the committee again but  was like -- hope is completely 2008
Grow up
Did you suggest "Despair
" Nobody would see that coming
Or -- global warming
Everybody has to wear tin foil
(laughs/to Charlie) Did you go last year
We basically did the whole thing, Bee and me
9
() Me
, ah, was in training that week
This big triatha-- (cutting him off) Chuck was still under his rock
We're so glad you crawled out
Caffeine
Hello
have Econ first period
Amy takes her hand off his leg
Charlie notices
Charrrliiieeeee
( ) Okay
Yeah
It's no big deal
Amy  into a coffee place
Parks
The girls climb out
Thank you, Jesus
Amy catches Charlie looking at his watch, fidgeting
You're not going to flunk for missing Econ, Brain
Brain
-- what
No, 'm-- But she's already walking away
Five minutes
He watches her move off, anxious and smitten
--  -- Charlie arrives with Amy, Cara and Bee -- all the girls now sport coffee drinks
Charlie has one too, with whipped cream and the works
10
Kids stream into a nice, modern-looking high school
Amy takes Charlie's arm
On time
You stress too much
wasn't worried
You were doing your worried thing
was
have a -- what's my-- (
) Ladies
couple of handsome jock-type guys,  and , roll up along side Charlie and the girls
They draw looks from other students as they move through the courtyard
The cool kids
Doods
Looking massive
(to Charlie/re: drink) Seriously
Mochachino
You can't ride with the girls anymore
You let them brush your hair, My Pretty Pony
Mark grabs the cup away from him
Starts drinking it
(takes his arm) Chuck's secure, aren't you
We see that Ben is also wearing 's
Different design
It's a thing
Charlie shows his off -- he's secure
Puce
Fuck yeah
( ) have track after school, maybe we can hook up later
11
Yeah
Hey
Come here
(pulls her aside/awkward) You know, the formal
Don't think wasn't going to ask you, because thought it was an obvious go
Together
Hope, puppies, kittens, the whole deal
You and me
( ) Oh, no
Please
Nobody goes to the dance senior year
She smiles, moves off
He watches her, lets out a breath
Right
knew that
and  enjoy the view as the girls move off
Wow
Mark, incredulous, says to Charlie: Did you find a frickin' Genie lamp man
Make a sacrifice to the hot ass Gods
How do you get that
Game, my friend
Rock solid
Charlie moves off
And even though he's playing it off, we see that Mark's hit a nerve
This hot girlfriend thing is a bitch
Mark calls after him-- You don't even have a car
-- Later
Charlie's in Econ class
Seated in a back row near and
number of seats in class are
Ben Wegner
Here
Adam Noris
Nothing
Teacher looks around
12
(') Adam
(marks chart/then) Courtney Heuer
girl raises her hand
Charlie, bored, idly checks out the class
Stops when he sees a tweaked-looking kid, , staring at him
is a slight, faintly punk-looking kid who's been picked on by bullies his whole life
He's hyper-intelligent, hyper-critical and
just hyper
And his binder is covered with
(') Nick Straley
() Nick
Ed sees that he's caught Charlie's eye
Nods significantly at him
Like -- "you know and  know
" Charlie looks away
As if he didn't see him
-- Charlie, Mark and Ben move down the hall
Mark shows Charlie a picture on his phone
woman posing seductively
Miss Granada
Geometry
Holy crap
Where did you get that
She's hard up, man
Equations don't keep you warm at night
They stop, see   approaching
This amuses Mark and Ben
But Charlie's uncomfortable -- wants to bolt
think "it's" going to talk to us
( ) need a minute
"It's" going to talk to Brewster
13
( ) When are you going to get the message
We don't know you-- (: ) He does
Or did
Before the summer and his Jock Lobotomy
(to Ed/uncomfortable) What's the deal, man
Alone
Ed stares Charlie down
beat
Ben and Mark bust out laughing
Mark looks at Charlie
Just the two of you
That's sweet
He can school you in the ways of geek-douchery
It's important
"Brewster
" The way Ed says his name is enough to propel Charlie into action
He grabs Ed and pulls him aside
Mark and Ben watch with interest -- out of earshot
Ed's tone is dire, serious as a heart attack
(') Adam's missing
Charlie's looking around, self-conscious
What do you mean, he's missing
keep trying him -- nothing
No texts, no phone
And he's not the only one who's gone
You heard roll call
So kids aren't coming to school
What do you want me to do about it
14
Meet me at his house after school
We'll check around
See what's up, if he's okay
can't after school
'm busy
don't think you get what 'm -- Look, do we have to do this here
Ed can't believe it
Charlie's totally blowing him off
He starts to lose it, raises his voice-- What, am  not even suppose to speak to you now
-- Keep it down
Don't spaz-- It's so horrible
Crossing the streams
Will High School as we know it cease to exist
Ed glances at Mark and Ben, who still watch from a distance
(') You want me to tell your pals how well we know each other
The Lego contests, the Farscape conventions, -- -- Or how your first sexual experience was with an Electra figurine-- No
No
Then be my backup
() Fine
Adam's after school
15
Don't be late
Moves off
Charlie sees the guys watching him
beat
He shrugs like " have no idea what that was about
" : --   -- The sun has set behind the mountains
It's gloomy gray out, right before dark
Charlie and  park, climb out of her car with drinks from in hand
She's still in her track and field clothes
Looks tough
You know what  want
For dinner
You're eating right now, you know
As you speak
You literally just forced me to get you a smoothie so large they named a planet after it-- () ran six miles
What did you do
-- watched you
But not in a creepy way
Charlie winces a little
It sounds creepy
So don't judge
You don't want me to burn my big ole' booty off, do you
Charlie, on impulse, stops her -- kisses her
(') What was that for
don't know you're just
What
16
() Nothing
sweet moment
These two have a definite thing
It's real
They're about to kiss again when '   stops them
They both turn and
,   - -- clad only in a white wife-beater and jeans
We can't make out his face
Jane stands over him, laughing at something he's said as he their sprinkler
as the guy looks up
This is
30's
Handsome to the point of devastating
An all-American Adonis
Wow
Look at Mom
She'sa Damn right
If he followed her home, you have to let her keep him
Amy laughs -- almost skips toward them, milking the moment
'  -- paces anxiously in front of '
He has a duffle bag over his shoulder
Keeps checking his phone
He finally dials in a number
Talks-- Charlie
'm in front of Adam's
Remember the videos we all made back when
You and me and Adam, bro
In tights
Want your pals to get a load of that
--   -- Amy and Charlie approach Jane and Jerry
They overhear-- so not a pool, what's the work you're doing
17
Jerry has an easy-going way about him
An inviting charm
Foundation problems
had to rip up half the basement
These houses were built practically overnight
'm never surprised when they come apart
(: ) Done
Just needed a new stem
Jane sees Charlie and Amy approaching
And gaping
Jerry, this is my son Charlie
And his -- do we say girlfriend now
() guess
mean -- only if she's-- Amy's amused at Charlie's squirming, finally saves him
(shakes Jerry's hand) Hi
'm Amy
He can't help but give Amy an appreciative once-over
She enjoys it, but pulls away and moves closer to Charlie
Charlie notices the exchange -- the way this dude oozes manliness
Doesn't like it one bit
He shakes Jerry's hand a little too firmly
Lowers his voice a bit
Hey
Jerry's our new neighbor
The Perry place
He's "handy
" (looks to Charlie, smiles) No kidding
Sorry about the mess, man
was just telling your mom 'll have the dumpster gone next week
18
Doesn't bother me
Jerry does night construction on the strip
(noticing Charlie's shoes) You play ball
'm always looking for a pick up game
() Now and then, you know
It's more of a collector thing
The shoes
He's obsessed
(to Jerry/"those teens") They sleep on sidewalks to get them
Charlie looks at Jane, thanks for embarrassing me
Well -- they're bold
like them
Jerry looks back at Jane
little flirtatious
(') So
'd ask you guys inside, but it's a mess
've been meaning to
Be neighborly
drink, something
It hangs there, waiting for an invitation
Jane just smiles
(') Soon, okay
You bet
And thank you so much
For the help
Least  could do
Jane, Amy and Charlie walk toward the house
Jerry moves off
Amy looks at Jane, amazed
19
Why did you blow him off
Oh my God
guy that good-looking, still single
Bad bet
He's a player
() Mom
Breaking it down
've had enough man trouble
'm not getting suckered again
Amy and Charlie meet eyes
That was loaded
Jane notices
(') Don't listen to me
Jaded old -- -- Charlie's  buzzes
He checks it
from
"  and
" It shows Charlie, Ed and Adam when they were younger, prancing around in homemade costumes and, indeed, tights
The text message says "10  --
" (') (alarmed/to Amy) Wow
Okay
gotta go
Sorry
Call you later
Now
have dinner on-- gotta go
'll eat later
Charlie
20
But Charlie's already off and running
'  -- Charlie approaches, sees  pacing in front of the house
He's flipping out
Where the hell have you been
You said after school, chill out
Ed is already lugging his big duffle to Adam's front door
Right after
It's dusk, dude, you know what that means
That the sun's gone down
What's -- Over him, Ed knocks loudly
Rings the bell
Hey
Anybody home
long pause
Nothing
Not here
Let's go-- But Ed's already heading around the house with the duffle
'  --  -- Ed wriggles in through the
He turns, lets Charlie in
Charlie looks around
This is nuts
It's the   we saw in the opening, but completely righted
is off, the walls are clean
Furniture in it's proper place
It's perfect
They move into the house
Ed is wired, scared
21 Hello
Ed and Charlie here
( ) Come on
Charlie follows him in
Resigned and placating
Okay
Fine
Ed opens his duffle bag
Inside are , , , even a small
Take this
Ed hands Charlie a
Charlie eyes it, incredulous
You've got to be kidding me
Ed stops
This is it
hate to tell you this but that guy, your neighbor
( ) He's a vampire
One of the undead
My neighbor
Next door
Yeah
just met him
Jerry
Jerry
beat
That's a terrible vampire name
"Jerry
" Seriously-- didn't name him, man, 'm just reporting the facts
Ed moves
Charlie reluctantly follows
It's darker up here
Lights off
22
Come on, this is a gag -- right
Ed's barely listening -- cautious
Every shadow is potential death
Total shmuck bait
Hey
Anybody here
They pass the empty   -- where we saw 's parents slaughtered
Now its clean and empty
Then Ed turns into 's room
It's full of geekery
Action figures, the like
Charlie sticks behind him
The guys don't register the mostly obscured form of the door
figure
Ed catches sight of the guy, and  toward it, freaked
Charlie also reacts, scared
(') Get back, demon
Ed thrusts his cross forward which knocks the door open, toppling
beat
Then Ed lets out a slightly manic laugh
(') Ha
killed that sucker dead
() They're not here, okay
They left town
His dad was a deadbeat-- Ed pulls a  out of his pocket
It has lots of red and black  marked on it
He thrusts it at Charlie
No, see, it's not just them
It started -- there was this thing on Channel 13, a lady escaped an attacker who tried to bite her
Ed points to the   on his chart
They form a loose circle around ' house
(') Adam and me, we graphed the attack, the disappearances
Whole families, gone
() 23 (') And that's you guys at the center, see
His windows are totally -- There's a ton of houses like that
People work nights on the strip-- But every window
No
've been watching him
It all fits-- That Jerry's a Dracula
No
Dracula is a specific vampire
' -- know what you're saying
'm mocking you
You've been reading too much Twilight-- Fiction, okay
This is real real monster
And he's not brooding
Or lovesick
Or noble
He's the fucking shark from
He feeds, he kills, and he doesn't move on until everyone around him is dead
( ) And that book
Charlie can't help but pause
Ed's conviction is so real
But he shakes it off
-- What about your neighbors, the Perrys
He moved into their house
Haven't seen them around, have you
Yeah, in San Diego like a month ago
Exception, proves the rule
You haven't asked him in, have you
He can't get in without an invitation
24 No, but-- Your mom
Lonely divorcee
You're on drugs
No
Well, yeah
thought you'd take my word, but  have evidence at home
Hard evidence
Charlie stops fighting it and humors him
Ed's lost it
Yeah
Okay
() We have to stake him in his nest
You and me
Not now, it's dark
Right
Cause he's nocturnal
Just for -- okay -- for a minute pretend you're not a douche now-- Look, Ed, this stuff, it was fun when we were eight-- -- ( ) Whatever
grew up, okay
You don't want to, fine
But don't get an attitude because 'd rather have a life than make shit up
Ed stops
Stung
Right
Got it
You're soooo cool "Brewster
" Go ahead, join the Clark High early-peakers
This is the pinnacle for them
And that includes your girl-- 25
Shut up
Undeniably doable, but we used to make fun of her and her pals, remember
They're bimbos-- Shut up
Charlie barely refrains from hitting Ed
Instead he shoves him away
Ed stumbles
Falls
He looks up at Charlie, genuinely hurt and desperate
Adam's gone -- you act like it has nothing to do with you
(/) We were inseparable, man
Yeah
And you know when  got popular
The minute  stopped hanging out with you
Charlie takes off
Ed watches him go
: / -- while later
It's   now
Ed, gripping his duffle bag nervously, skates down a residential street
Houses here are spaced far apart and the lights in many of them are off
Ed is anxious, watchful
He knows it's not safe
Every dark corner is potentially the end of him
few cars pass
Something moves behind him
Footsteps Ed abandons his skateboard and
hand  on his shoulder, spins him around
's , Charlie's pal from school
You crossed my yard
Tracked your nerdjuice all over it
26
Sorry
Sorry-- My mom works hard on that shit, -- Ed glances around nervously, it's dark and anything
else could be out there
Can you just hit me
don't have time for the build up
(he steels himself) Go
Seriously
Jesus, man
Just do it
Fine
Mark winds up and  -- a brutal blow
Ed  and runs
Mark's immediately on his heels
The guys dodge and dart through the neighborhood
But Ed has experience in the art of losing bullies and he manages to shake Mark for a moment
Ed scrambles over a wooden fence, but his Most of his vamp hunting stuff  over on the
(') Crap
Crap
There's not time to get the stuff
He can hear Mark approaching in the dark
He drops into a neighbor's backyard
-- spins and slams right into  -- no, it's
Ed falls back and scrambles away, terrified
(') Get away
'm armed mother fucker
Jerry moves after Ed, angry but controlled
More like a man than a monster
27
-- Mark pulls up on the other side of the wood fence
Sees Ed's on the ground, laughs
Unbelievable
beat, Mark glances at the high fence
Decides he's done
He kicks some of Ed's stuff as he moves off
-- Ed trips over kid's toys and bikes as he runs to the house
There's a porch light on over the back door
(pounding on door) Hey
Let me in
Please
But there's no answer
Ed is desperate, Sees Jerry closing in, walking across the backyard
Ed takes a  and smashes the window over the kitchen sink
--  -- Ed falls through the window into the kitchen
Looks out
stalks toward him
All hulking menace
But Ed's safe now
Calls out-- Forget it sucker
No invite
Jerry kicks in the kitchen door
Ed, terrified, falls back
Abandoned
thought you did your homework
-- what
You've been watching me
've been watching you
Seems fair
Ed  into the house
28
--  -- As he races through the empty rooms he pulls a stake from his pocket
We see he's wearing a cross around his neck on a long chain
's following, but barely breaking a sweat
Ed sees     to the back
He fumbles with the lock, gets it open and runs into the backyard
-- Ed races for the back gate-- Jerry has him by the back of the  he's wearing
Ed's lifted  off his feet by the , until he's choking on it, the cross directly under his neck
looks away as he  the chain off Ed and  the cross into the neighbor's
Ed falls to the ground, watches the cross sink in despair
Jerry's standing over him
Smiles a little
We get just a flash -- he suddenly has  , sharper, in rows
It's chilling
Bit off more than you can chew
Shaking, terrified, Ed brandishes the
We'll see, man
know my shit
But Jerry doesn't appear to be afraid
He looks at Ed with actual sympathy
Really
Who's going to believe you
You see the truth, but what good is it when you're alone
Ed's shaken -- but still grips the stake
Holding on
Don't play that stuff
That mind crap
Come on -- try me
Try me
29
You say you're glad you're different
But how can you be in a place like this
These people
Even your best friend
You're nothing to him now
Ed's listening despite himself, hurting now
Jerry moves a step in
Ed raises his stake again -- but with slightly less conviction
Get back
It can be over
can make all that pain go away
Ed's fighting tears
Life as he knows it is gone
No
You were born for this and you know it
Your "life", what you had
That's the illusion
(off Ed's silence) can take you somewhere great
Somewhere you'll belong
Ed takes this in
His eyes clear a bit
Is it
hope
(') It's a gift
And Jerry moves closer, blocking our view
: : -- new day
Sunny and hot
truck moves the  from Jerry's house
--  -- Through the kitchen window, Jane watches the  drive away
She's pleased, a little surprised
Says to herself
30
Good on his word
knock at the door
It's Amy
She lets herself in
Morning
Charlie
You try
My voice seems to be on some frequency he can't hear
(
) Coming
Amy looks at Jane, who shakes her head
Amy moves to the island
Grins a little
Talk to Hot Neighbor again
You should facebook him
(shakes her head) Temptress
'm resolved
Charlie runs down
Wet from the shower, discombobulated
pecks Amy, grabs food off a plate
He's out of sorts
Oversleep
Didn't
(off her look) Weird dreams
Charlie gives Jane a quick peck and follows Amy out
--   -- Amy and Charlie head to the car
Charlie turns -- looks back at '
The blacked out windows
What
Charlie snaps out of it
It's crazy to even entertain Ed's theories
31 Nothing
That guy was such a tool
( ) Totally
Poser
She gets in the car
Smiles a little
: -- Charlie's in class
He's restless, agitated
On his pad, he absently draws  images, blood
Sally Cabella
Here
Ed Lee
Nothing
Charlie looks up
(') Edward Lee
Charlie looks around
No Ed
And just like he said -- quite a few other kids are missing
Charlie takes this in, looks around
This time it makes an impact
-- Charlie, Mark, Ben and the rest of the guys get ready for practice
Mark's in the middle of a story, but Charlie is distracted -- barely listening
she's wearing a jumpsuit, dude
Like -- one zip and
Huh
32 What's up with you
Dreaming about your little boyfriend
Charlie takes this in, worried
You see him around today
Ed
don't track "it's" whereabouts
What did he want, anyway
Nothing
Homework stuff
But Charlie's clearly distracted

Now
You're ditching
'll bail with you
No -- 'm --  don't feel so well
He takes off
Ben and Mark watch him, perplexed
'  -- Another suburban development
Rows and rows of red tile roofs, houses stacked right on top of one another
Charlie rings the bell of a modest place
Not as big as where Charlie and Jane live
But nice, well-tended for

She's surprised to see him
Charlie
Yeah, Hi Mrs
Lee
Victoria breaks into a wide smile
God you're a sight for sore eyes
33
'  -- Victoria pulls Charlie in and hugs him, happy
Calls out-- Rick
Charlie's here
( ) Look at you
So handsome
Oh,  -- you don't have to-- Now , Ed's dad comes into the room
Shakes his hand
Ed said you'd sprouted
And you're, the-- Rick awkwardly gestures around his face
Cleared up
Yes sir-- Ed will be so sorry he missed you, But -- you should both be in school now, shouldn't you
He's not here
Did you see him today
He's usually up and out early
Everything okay
No, sure
We're working on a class project
guess we crossed paths
'm so glad you're doing that
Ed, he'd be mad that  said so, but he talks about you all the time
This lands hard on Charlie
How remiss he's been
Yeah
That's
He's great
() Would it be okay if  went upstairs
Ed has a book we need
34
Of course
Make yourself at home
Charlie goes upstairs
Victoria makes a face at Rick -- "that's good
" They're both pleased
'  -- Ed's room is a shrine to comic books, horror and fantasy movies
There's an art table where Ed has been working on some illustrations for a noir-style graphic novel
Charlie stops and looks at them
They're fantastic
He looks at the photos on the wall -- including a few pictures of Ed, Charlie and Adam when they were friends
Charlie and Ed, arms around each other
Charlie is shorter and thinner -- with really bad acne
Not cute
not
Ouch
Best not to dwell
He turns and sees-- ' " "  on a wall
Charlie takes it in, laughs a little
Then Charlie examines a   devoted to Ed's investigation of Jerry
Maps, news reports, vampire lore printed off the internet, books, etc
If you didn't know the difference, you'd say it's just more of Ed's fictional world
Charlie stares at it all for a beat
Then shakes his head
It's all a fantasy -- nothing more
This is crazy
He starts to take off
But sees that Ed's computer is on -- and one file stands out
"
" Charlie gives in to his curiosity -- clicks it open -- finds a bunch of Quicktime files
He opens one
Stops
35
As  short clips play: Jerry's truck, in motion but it looks like ' the neighbor chatting on Jerry's lawn -- with nobody
Over and over, it's appears that  '   on video
Taking this in
Chilled
-- It's dark as Charlie comes home
He looks warily at Jerry's house as he searches for his keys
-- he walks right into
Hey guy
Charlie tries to maintain his cool
What if Jerry is what Ed thought
Impossible, but
Hey
Guy
You could really do me a solid
Yeah
What kind
have a girl on her way over for a beer, and 'm totally out of beer
They're at Charlie's back door, the one that leads to the kitchen
Bummer
Set me up, 'll pay you back two times
sixer for your mom, and one for you
Uh, yeah, sure
36
Jerry watches Charlie as he unlocks the door
This is when Charlie should invite him in
(') Let me see what Mom's got
She's kind of a "light domestic"
mom
Charlie steps inside
Pointedly ' ask Jerry to enter
Charlie intentionally leaves the door open, moves to the refrigerator
But keeps his eyes on Jerry
If he steps in, uninvited, Ed's theory is blown
Nice kitchen
Same floor plan as my place, huh
Jerry leans against the door jamb -- Charlie observes this
Holy shit
Charlie and Jerry
Then a cold smile creeps over Jerry's face
Charlie fumbles, lets one of the wet beers slide from his hand -- it hits the ground, explodes
Fuck
Can  help you with that
No
No
Thanks
'll get it
Jerry takes in Charlie's frantic refusal
Now he's darkly certain
He's been made
Charlie tosses the broken bottle into the sink
Moves to the doorway with the remaining beers
Charlie hands them over the threshold
But doesn't cross
(') There you go
Uh
party down
Jerry watches him, intense
His tone shifts -- cocky and intimidating
threat disguised as "guy talk
" This girl tonight -- she's a handful
You know
() 37
(') Women who look a certain way, they need to be managed
Yeah
You don't mind my saying, you got a lot on your shoulders for a kid
Your pal, Amy
She's ripe
Must be a line of guys dying to pluck that
Your mom too -- you don't see it, maybe you do -- she's giving it off
It's on you to watch out for them
You up for that
Charlie's burning
But holds himself in check
think  can manage
Good
Cause there are bad people out there, man
Better keep an eye on your women
Jerry backs away, intimidating even as he retreats
(') Thanks for the beers
Charlie watches him move into the dark
- '  -- Charlie bursts into his room, freaked out -- races to the window
His room is free of all geekery
Now it's all sports and sneakerhead stuff
's there -- on his bed and surrounded by school books
She's reading Wuthering Heights
Where've you been
You told me to meet you here an hour ago
' Jerry's nowhere to be seen and his house is quiet
Lights on behind
38
(') Hello
Charlie breaks away from the window
It's an effort
His focus is still half there, even as he tries to talk to Amy
Sorry
You okay
Everything okay
He checks his phone
Checks for anything from
Nothing
Yeah
Why shouldn't it be
No, it should
Nothing
(re: her book) You ever read this
It's good
Sexy, actually
Amy moves to Charlie
Puts her arms around him
(') In a frustrated, unconsummated sort of way
Like us, you mean
Amy laughs, pulls him onto the bed
She's feeling frisky
Kinda makes it hotter
Yeah, so you keep saying
He smiles a little
She kisses him
But feels his distance
Am  boring you
What's up
What
No
'm kind of wiped out, that's all
can fix that
She kisses him again
Despite himself, Charlie gets drawn in and turned on
She pulls back, serious
39
(') Want to get under the covers
-- now
Seriously
Calm down
Let's just
see how it goes
Charlie's dying inside
Now
Could not be a worse time
Believeme when  say--thereis nothing in the worldI'dratherdo -- Charlie
Don't be nervous
She kisses him again
It's intense, passionate
Charlie weakens a little
Maybe death and mayhem can wait
Amy moves to take off her top
Oh
My
God-- Somebody is ringing the bell at Jerry's
Charlie stops
Practically tosses Amy off him
You hear that
He rushes to the window
Looks outside
' is at Jerry's front door
Holding a bottle of wine
(') Shit
What
comes to the door
He and Doris start chatting
She's flirting up a storm
Shit, shit, shit-- Amy sees what Charlie sees
Shrugs
He's hot
She's a stripper
They were bound to find each other

- -- Take away two tiny pieces of cloth, stripper
() You jealous
What
No-- Jerry is showing Doris in when he stops-and looks It's chilling
Charlie  away from the window, grabbing Amy and pulling her down too
(') He looked right at us
Maybe
Not a big deal-- Charlie's freaked now
Doris is
No, it is a big
very big
He saw us and he was pissed
Okay
Amy moves away
Looking at him skeptically
(') If you're not into this, say so
Don't do me any favors
What
No
am,  totally am
just --  don't trust that guy
He glances out the window again
Amy's irritated, not used to having her passes rejected
She gathers her stuff
'm going
Amy
Don't-- 41
No
You've got your neighborhood watch thing
Come on, don't be that way-- But she's gone
(') Crap
beat
Charlie's torn -- he should go after her
But Doris's muted  from the other house draws his attention
He looks again at Jerry's house
He can see faint shadows moving behind the windows in the house, like ghosts
Charlie's conflicted, freaked -- what can he do
He picks up the phone
Dials 911
Then thinks better of it
Hangs up
Finally -- he stops at the window, eyes on '
Listening and watching intently
Keeping sentry

Charlie's fallen asleep in a chair by the window
He's startled awake by a woman's
They sound like they are coming from Jerry's
But are they screams of pleasure or pain
Charlie looks out the window
Jerry's house is dark
It's all quiet
Charlie looks at the clock

Charlie sits back on his bed
Was it a dream
Then Charlie hears
Charlie goes back to the window
Jerry's  starts and Jerry drives off
Off Charlie, unsettled

Charlie steels his nerves
At Jerry's back door, he clumsily tries to pick the lock
After a moment or two, he realizes he has no idea what he's doing

He walks away from the door, frustrated
Then turns and impulsively tries to   the  with his foot
Nothing happens
Then something occurs to Charlie
He goes into the garden

It has a  in it

He puts the key in the back door lock
It opens
'  - Charlie moves through the first story of the house
He's cautious, on edge
At first the place seems totally unremarkable
typical "guy pad"
Lots of inexpensive furniture, bad art, a salt water fish tank
At every turn, Charlie expects something or someone to jump out at him
It's unbearably tense

It's clear that these are additions Jerry's added
Each room has a small rectangular , so you can see in
Charlie reacts, sick
It looks like a prison
Despite the danger, he creeps over and looks in one of the rooms-- pale  slaps against the window
Charlie jumps
Fuck
-- is in the window now
Bruised and so pale she looks almost
Help
Oh my God
Oh, shit-- Charlie tugs on the door
Locked
He stands back, what to do
Charlie hears a

Oh no
Get me out of here

In a cold panic

Charlie ducks inside one of the  across from Doris, moves behind the door

Charlie holds his breath
Jerry moves to the  and retrieves 's half-alive body from it
Charlie cautiously looks through the crack in the door

Doris screams, then starts to cry
It's stark and  and terrifying
It seems to go on and on
Doris weakens, her head lolling to one side, her light fading
small stream of blood spreads across the white pavement
In the position she's in, she is eye to eye with
She sees him, smiles weakly
Then mouths something -- too weak to make much sound

Cha
is petrified
Doris gets it -- smiles a little grimly, puts a finger to her lips

After what seems like an eternity, Jerry is satisfied
He tosses Doris aside and stands away from her
Charlie  behind the door as Jerry emerges and casually wipes a spot of blood from his mouth

Then Jerry   back into her cell
Pockets the key and moves off toward the stairs
After a moment, he's gone
The sound of a  starts in Jerry's living room
Something banal like "The Real Housewives of Orange County
" Charlie knows this is his moment
With shaking hands, he retrieves his iPhone and pulls up the "    " screen
Charlie looks through the window in Doris's cell
She's breathing -- alive
Charlie whispers to himself as he uses a bobby pin and a tiny screwdriver on the lock
Please
Please
The bobby pin slips
Drops
Charlie's losing it
Steadies himself
Tries again

The tension is unbearable
Charlie can hear  moving downstairs

Jerry takes this in, coldly furious

You're going to be late
Jane moves to the windows, throws the curtains open

He got no sleep, looks like hell

Listen -- promise me -- that guy next door, Jerry
Under no circumstances do you invite him into our house
He's dangerous

No, no you can't-- Charlie-- Don't even look in his direction, understand

He wears fireproof clothes, has stakes and crosses strapped to him, holsters made out of duct-tape
Slung over his shoulder is the spray canister
And he holds a crowbar in a free hand
He looks like something out of one of Ed's graphic novels
Before he enters, Charlie
Let's do this shit
He swallows hard, scared but determined
'  --   -- Widen to find Charlie cautiously moving through the house
The blacked-out windows give the place a gray, stifled air
Behind Charlie, we see that the front door has been broken open with the crow bar
96
Charlie anxiously looks around for Jerry -- fully expecting him to jump out and go for his throat
He takes the stairs up to the second floor, two at a time
'  --   -- Charlie moves down the hall, stops at some of the small rooms
Looks in
Finally, Charlie hears a
He opens a window in the door for yet another room
' lying on the floor, turned away from him
Charlie's not sure what he'll see when he gets a better look at her
-- Amy slowwwwly gets up, turns
And aside from a    on her neck -- she looks normal
She rushes to Charlie, keeps her voice down
-- She reaches through the window
They link hands, emotional
(') You shouldn't be here-- Where is he
don't know
He dumped me here
'm bait
He said so-- How do you feel
'll survive
Please get out of here
He's too strong-- 'm stronger
() In a nerd power way
You know
97
He reaches into his jacket, pulls out a
(') Take this
It should-- He looks up
Disappeared
Charlie, reacts
Calls out in a hushed panic-- (') Amy
Amy
Nothing
It's like she vaporized
'  --  -- Charlie races down a hallway, looking for
He tries door after door that won't open
He finally finds one door that's unlocked, rushes through -- almost  through an open floor in an unfinished portion of the house
Jerry's building more cells
Charlie backs out of the doorway, turns a corner and
He runs into
No, wait -- it's
He's not wearing his wig, etc
But he's cleaned up and standing tall
Dressed all in black
Shit
You-- Sorry-- How'd you-- beat
Then: Guess  don't want to be a man like me either
Peter opens his leather coat -- it's loaded with weapons
And a flask
Peter grins
(') Let's kill something
98
(: ) You reek
Midori
Don't get greedy
'm here
(/) And  found something else
From my collection
Powerful shit
From around his back, he reveals  - with a
Wooden bullets
Nice
No, you think 'm fucking MacGyver
Bullet, bullets
They'll buy us some time
Charlie is grateful, but now's not the time for man hugs
We have to find Amy
She was in a room upstairs, then she just disappeared
This house-- What do you mean she "disappeared
" She was there
looked away, looked back -- she was gone
Peter takes this in
Show me where
'  -- '  -- Peter and Charlie pry open the door to the room where Amy was held
Peter walks over the floor -- finds a
(') Floor trap
use it all the time
Where does it go
Only one way to find out
99
Peter lowers himself into the hole under the trap door-- Wait -- you're going in
See that
Like a great date
Get me drunk and 'll try anything
Peter lets go and
Charlie steels himself, goes in after him
'  -- Charlie and Peter land painfully on a dirt floor
Ow, crap
They look around -- eyes adjusting
There's barely any light
They're in a
The floor is dirt and the main story of the house is held up by numerous At the far end of the basement there is a door that leads to another room/storage area
As he sees something
Stops
of dirt
Like a grave
Charlie indicates to Peter to follow him
They whisper: You uncover him
'll light him up, then stake him
Charlie pulls a  , like a ski mask, over his face
Peter looks at him
(') Flame retardant
They're standing over the grave now
Both nervous
Charlie nods to Peter
Peter does his best to hold the shotgun on the grave as he pushes the dirt aside with his free hand
He's shaking
100
After a moment Peter
Then he moves up toward the face
Charlie douses the body with liquid from the canister
(') ( ) Gas
You should be a magician
As the face emerges, Charlie readies a match, then reaches for his -- (') Stop
No-- stops   '    the match
(') Who is that
' , sleeping in a shallow dirt grave
Charlie reacts
Holy shit
He pushes his mask back
Adam
know him
Knew him
Shh
Don't wake him up, for '-- Peter stops
He's looking over Charlie's shoulder, horrified
In the dirt behind  are
Eight or ten at least
Charlie turns
Sees the graves
(') You know them too
Charlie reacts, stunned
Peter moves to another grave, uncovers another sleeping face
And then another
hulking man, a suburban mom
Charlie uncovers another body
Stops, chilled
Ms
Granada
My geometry teacher
() She was hard up
101
How about we go back to my "run away" plan
( ) We can't burn Jerry out
There's no way we'll get all these people out if the house goes up
thought you're here for Amy
(off Charlie's look) Great
Right
Save the Geometry-- stops him
Amy
Charlie and Peter spin -- it's coming from behind the door to the other room
beat
They're both petrified as they move toward the door
Peter readies the gun again
Charlie pulls a  out along with the stake
They creep toward the door
Charlie puts his hand on the doorknob
Turns it
-- Charlie's      into the '   -- Charlie hits the dirt hard
The door
He's in a smaller room with a    in the middle
Jerry's grave
'  -- Peter's confronted by
Who smiles darkly
You look bigger on
Peter fires the shotgun,
But he misses Jerry and the power of the blast sends 102
-- Charlie reacts to the blast -- but sees that
' has fallen from his hand and rolled to the edge of the grave
He cautiously moves to retrieve it
He stops as he sees   emerge from the dark
Her clothes are torn now, a thin trickle of blood runs down her neck
She looks impossibly sexy
Her hair, her eyes, her lips -- all shining and full
Forgetting himself, he goes to her
Pulls her into his arms
Amy, God
She clings to him, near tears
Charlie
'  -- Peter scrambles on the ground,  trained on  -- who moves toward him calmly
The cross on the gun the only thing holding him back
Peter fires again -- grazes
In pain, he  and  before our eyes with a blood- curdling yell
It's chilling
One by one, the  of vampires wake
,
-- Amy pulls away from Charlie -- says: You should have run with me while we had the chance
You should have saved me, Charlie
103
Charlie takes this in, pained
Then-- It's not too late
She brings her lips close to his ear
Rasps
It is
He's inside me now
Her    -- fingernails grow  and dig into Charlie
He feels the change
-- Charlie shoves her off, hard
But she holds him tight -- and they
'  -- , backed by ,
and a handful of other vampires, closes in on
It's over, guy
Charlie -- his girl's having her way with him
() She's way out of his league anyway
Peter, trapped, won't be able to keep them at bay much longer
Stop
Stop
Desperate, he  them again
Hits one on the shoulder
But it's not stopping them
And your aim-- You don't get it
'm on your side
Peter smiles a little
Shows his rows of
Jerry and the others stop
What
104
-- Amy and Charlie struggle
He reaches for his cross -- but she throws him off her with a violent
Charlie gets his first look at  in full  glory
She's even more freaky looking than Jerry or Ed
Her face is nearly overtaken by a wide mouth filled with razor-sharp teeth
Her eyes are crazed and blood-red
It's gruesome and terrifying
Charlie sees   at the lip of the hole
Dives for it
Amy's on him in a flash
She throws him to the ground
He's got the  in hand
Ready to strike
You wouldn't
Try me
She  , sexual and raw
Charlie's repulsed, terrified
'll be the best you ever had
The only you had
() Charlie
We can be together forever
She leans in, licks his neck seductively
She sits back, the
She falls away, shuddering
Charlie pulls the stake out -- scrambles out of the nest
He looks back at her, anguished

, in terrible pain,
Nothing's happening
No kablooey

You missed

He backs away from her
Into-- '  -- The basement where Jerry and the   are  around a body as

, who's pale and shaking
Charlie attacks them with
Get off him
He hits
off Peter
Manages to hold off  for a beat
Spins and   in the head
Dude
Sorry
enters from the other room -- already healing
Jerry sees her -- holds up a hand and backs the others off
'll finish this
Jerry, all swagger, moves in on Charlie
Charlie sees Peter, barely alive, spit out his teeth
Peter meets his gaze, wry and weak
Done for
Worth a shot
"Master of illusion
" Now Charlie notices  not far from Peter's body
He dives for it, but Jerry steps on it -- kicks it away
( ) You think that's going to stop me
Time to man up
Jerry brutally kicks Charlie, sends him sprawling
106
(') Now
'm going to kill your girl -- make you watch
'll take my time with you
And once you're dead, 'll finish your mother
(: ) Too bad about that one
She sucked me dry
Like a pro
Amy smiles a little
Jerry  , lifts him off his -- Charlie, enraged,      the  -- right in the eyes
Jerry recoils,
Adam and the
Jerry's over it
He's on  in a flash,
About to
has the gun again -- has managed to pull himself up into a sitting position
He  away
And
And
-- he misses
Fuck
Charlie  for  as the   in part of the basement
in -- forcing ,  and the other vamps into a corner
(') ( ) Fuck yeah
Nice sweater, loser
Another  collapses
,  and the others under  from the floor above
stunned beat
Peter slumps, exhausted from the effort
107
Charlie looks at him -- amazed
(') () 'm better with stationary targets
Yeah you are
Peter looks at him, sad
Get out of here
We don't have much time before they dig out
(: ) can save you
have to kill him with this
You're a brave mother,  get it
And you were right
This is how had to go
But we didn't count on an army
He'll kill you both, he said-- We're already dead
() Go now, you live to fight another day
Stay -- there won't be one
Charlie stops
Swayed
Pained
(') Do it
Accepting it
It's what he has to do
He starts
(') Charlie
But Charlie ignores him, determined
Pulls his over his face again
(') Stop
108
, attacks Charlie
Charlie falls back,   with him into Jerry    -- but holds Charlie tight and the other vamps start to claw their way  of the rubble
Charlie and Jerry fight -- nearly    now (') Charlie
Peter gets up, painfully, moves to help
Raging and desperate -- Charlie and Jerry continue to battle
Finally, Jerry pulls Charlie down with him --rolls on the ground as they fight
Trying to put out the flames
Jerry starts to  -- he's about to  into bits
Charlie's stake is now
last desperate attempt
He can see Jerry's , about to burn away
suddenly  - she's burning inside,
Or so it seems
The vampire is being burned out of her
cries out too, reacting less violently
But in pain
Still burning, looks down as the     in his
Right through the heart
He starts to   -- faster and faster, just like Ed did -- becoming little more than a macabre
For a moment -- Jerry's human form hangs in the air
Blow me
109
Thinking fast,  tackles  -- who is still in flames
They tumble into one of the open graves
pours in around them, extinguishing the fire
Transformed and healed
Herself again
She rushes to the edge of the open grave
Peter pulls Charlie's mask back
Charlie is burned, unconscious
Charlie
She crawls into the grave
Cradles Charlie in her arms
(') Charlie
Amy starts to cry
Peter looks on, concerned
Finally, Charlie opens his eyes
Says weakly
Blow me
Seriously
Peter falls back -- exhausted
Laughing
(') Those are his last words
What a tool
We pull away, leaving this tableau
,
and the   of the tribe emerge from the rubble
Disoriented, freaked
beat
Let's agree to never talk about this
: '  - Charlie, Amy, Jane and Peter are in Peter's penthouse
It's a glittering night, a spectacular view
110
Jane, released from the hospital, looks healthy and glowing
She smiles at Peter, who also looks more together
She has a glass of wine -- he's drinking a
Think you'll ever feel the same about a nighttime sky
Same as what
was always terrified
Right
We're just catching up
Charlie sees the connection between Peter and Jane
Shudders
'm not seeing that
She deserves some fun
Your mom fully cheated death
() You too
You deserve fun
Oh,  plan on it
Now that you've killed your first vampire
am so going to perform
Charlie  her
It's intense, passionate
It's different, they're different
The childish part of them long gone
He runs his hands through her hair, pulls her close
, talks
"Frak
" "Frak
" ( ) What is that
Charlie, a little sheepish, shows her
He's wearing a wrist watch
Battlestar
Right
It was Ed's
Amy smiles a little, softens
Right
() Frak
is passing
Hears this
Is down with it
Frak
Right on
( ) Perfect Woman, can  get you a drink
'll take another
Thanks
( ) 'll give you a hand
Charlie follows  into the  , where a is set up
Peter moves to it
Pours himself a Midori
(') thought you were on the wagon
It's dark
(off his look) 'm on the "day" wagon
Thanks for inviting us
We should celebrate
Being alive
Your mom's clean bill of health
You wanted to put the moves on her
112 What
No
What
Just -- 'm watching you
've got to look out for her
Yeah you do
So here's what 'm thinking
We faced the beast and we won
Can you imagine the possibilities if we had got that shit on film
'-- Show up on film, yeah
But werewolves do, bigfoots do
We get proof, catch something -- we could build a stage act around that, you wouldn't believe
We'd blow those Cirque bitches away
An act
Seriously
What about saving people from evil
What -- interrupts them
Distant
Eerie
And somehow familiar
Peter nods to his
It happens
All this stuff
Ever think about collecting something else
Snow globes or-- Charlie stops, catches sight of something --
Just a wisp, a phantom
The face - is it
His features twisted in a grimace of fear and pain
It's
Charlie's spooked
But he looks again and the face is gone
(') Yeah, definitely get new stuff
113
Peter leads  , back to the ladies in the other room
Still on about his idea
(
) 'm serious, man
Do you know how much we could make
Think about how much people pay to see a tiger, or boobs, right
What if we had a tiger, boobs -- and a zombie
After they've gone we linger on the window
Is that Ed's eerie reflection again
, barely visible
(0
) You're so coooool Brewster
