-   - and '  stand in front of an open window
The government has flip-flopped in maybe two or 	three years the problem will come up again but it 	least it gives us some breathing room
'm thinking about starting over in
like it 	there, 've met some people  like
'm happy for 	the the first time in years
knew you would be in spite of all the damage
How much
All interior roads are out
Raymond's barn fell 	down
There's no power except from generators on 	the big island Have you heard from Marie-Nel
No
We flew over and there's no damage to any structures, but her radio is out
think  should get up there
-  - We see the big island floating in a sea of reflected light
-  - walks from his boat on the pier toward the ranch house
: Dvorzak - Cello Concerto #17 in  minor Op 104 Adagio -  -   - Guys on boat hear thunder
They stop and look around, hear it and are perplexed as it diminishes
Stop the engine
Listen
They all  thunder
plunges overboard with his board and pack and starts Paddling
The zodiac pulls next to him
'll be all right
Pick me up on Sunday
The zodiac speeds off
What's with Anthony
He really did it
He's crazy
We'll pick him up on the way back
Does he really think some chick lives on that island
guess so
- - walking up hill next to water, hunting with a bow
- hears thunder : Rene du pere "Saltimbanco" - - climbs a hill,hearing thunder
She stalks through grass
We see boar's eye
She appears from behind a bush Slow Mo of wide shot - picking up note and reading it
(flash forward) Just a clip of the paper falling
She takes her stance
- reads the note, tearfully
