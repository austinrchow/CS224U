Written by Gus Van Sant Based on a novel by Tom Robbins 1993 There is a huge ancient hourglass made of animal skins, and acorns plop through the waist of the hourglass one by one
It sits in a pool of water
In the water swim in geometric patterns
An underground stream feeds the pool of water and then flows into a huge underground crevasse that on occasion emits a
with torches surround the hourglass, which now we can see is in a cave
And as soon as the acorns have finished passing through the hourglass, a crew of Indians turn it on its opposite end
One of the Indians appears to be
stands at the wall of the cavern in front of a series of symbolic carvings and scratches, with stone in hand he makes a few hatchmarks, and keeps an eye on the once more, loosening a few chunks of rock from the cave
The earth begins to shake
She is restless tonight
She dreams of loving
She has the blues
View of the chartkeeper's drawings
One is of a crane with a very long neck
Another is a primitive drawing of a naked girl, who has long flowing hair
She also has, pointed out from her sides, thumbs that are three times normal human proportions
sounds at the sight of this drawing of a girl with the thumbs
The chartkeeper puts the finishing touches on the drawing
And the song "Happy Birthday to You" strikes up on country and western guitar and polka-like accordion
title We see  burning on a cake
It is somebody's birthday
And there are six candles on the cake
is six years old
Her  and a visiting , finishing their rendition of Happy Birthday, are staring down at Sissy and looking at her young ,     and twitch with a mind of their own
She manages to blow out all six candles
Well, you're lucky that you don't suck 'em
Sissy couldn't suck 'em, she'd need a mouth like a fish tank
Sissy is negotiating a fork full of birthday cake, dropping it because of her thumbs
(agrees) The poor little tyke might have a hard time finding herself a hubby
But as far as getting along in the world, it's a real blessing that Sissy's a girl-child
Lord,  reckon this youngun would never make a mechanic
Nope, and not a brain surgeon, neither
Course she'd do pretty good as a butcher
She could retire in two years on the overcharges alone
Laughing, the men walk to the kitchen to fill their glasses
Sissy is left to feel sorry for herself in front of her cake
(
) One thing, that youngun would make one hell of a hitchhiker
This startles Sissy
new word that tinkles in her head with a supernatural echo
Sissy looks at her thumbs
(
) if she was a boy,  mean
' Dr
Dreyfus looks over Sissy's thumbs
She is, if  may speak frankly, somewhat of a medical oddity
Due to impaired dexterity, her life activities and career potentialities will be reduced
It could be worse
Bring her back to me if there ever is pain
Meanwhile, she will have to learn to live with them
That she will
That she will
The Lord made them things big for a purpose
God don't never git tired of testing our kind
It's a punishment of some sort, for what  don't rightly know
(whimpering) Oh Doc, if a young man ever shows up here with, a young man with ugly fingers, you know, something similar, a similar case, Doc, would you please
Remember the words of the painter Paul Gauguin, dear lady
"The ugly may be beautiful, the pretty never
" don't suppose that means very much to you
It's a judgement
She's gotta bear the punishment
Sissy beams serenely like a Christ figure
Sissy looks up "thumb" in the dictionary
It says: the short, thick first or most preaxial digit of the human hand, differing from the other fingers by having two phalanges and greater freedom of movement
Sissy mouthing the words: "Greater freedom of movement
" Sissy very timidly ventures a pass with her gigantic right thumb in the direction she is walking
She is passed by
Pontiac skids ever so slightly on the snowflakes
View of the Pontiac insignia on the hood of the car
Sissy runs, actually sweating, to its side
She peers in
a palmist's trailer is a sign with a red silhouette of a hand
Directly under the wrist where the watch band would be is written
Madam Zoe in kimono and wig lets Sissy and her mother in the door
am the enlightened Madame Zoe
Inside
Madame Zoe begins stubbing a cigarette in one of those enlightened little ceramic ashtrays that are shaped like bedpans and inscribed
The trailer is cluttered, but not one knick-knack, chintz curtain or chenille-covered armchair seems to have come from the Beyond
There is nothing about your past, present or future that your hands do not know, and there is nothing about your hands that Madame Zoe does not know
There is no hocus-pocus involved
am a scientist, not a magician
, Madame Zoe, chiromancer, lifelong student of the moldings and markings of the human hand
, Madame Zoe, to whom no facet of your character or destiny is not readily revealed
am prepared to
Then she notices the thumbs
Jesus fucking Christ
Mrs
Hankshaw and the fortune-teller turn pale and uncertain, while Sissy recognizes with a faint smile that she is in command
Sissy extends the thumbs as an ailing aborigine might extend his swollen parts to a medical missionary
Sissy's mama draws a neatly folded five-dollar bill from her change purse and extends it alongside her smiling daughter's extremities
Madame Zoe returns to her senses, and takes Sissy by the elbow to sit at a For mica-topped table of undistinguished design
Madam Zoe holds Sissy's hands while she appears to go into a trance
She opens her eyes momentarily
You have a strong will
Will power and determination are indicated by the first phalanx
The second phalanx indicates reason and logic
You obviously have both in large supply
What's your name, dearie
Sissy
Hmmm
'd say that you have an intelligent, kindly, somewhat artistic nature
However, Sissy, however, there is a heavy quality to the second phalanx- the phalanx of logic -- that indicates a capacity for foolish or clownish behavior, a refusal to accept responsibility or to take things seriously and bent to be disrespectful of those who do
Your mama tells me that you're pretty well behaved and shy, but 'd watch out for signs of irrationality
All right
She pulls her thumb to her breast
guess the most important aspect of your thumbs is the, ahem, over all size
Uh, what was it, do you know, that caused
Mom speaks out from the couch she is sitting on Don't know; the doctors don't know
Just lucky  guess
Do you study history in school
Galileo, Descartes, Newton
Lebinitz had very large thumbs; Voltaire's were enormous, but, heh heh, just pickles compared with yours
What about Crazy Horse
Crazy Horse
You mean the Indian
Nobody that 've ever heard of ever troubled to study the paws of savages
Well,  guess that about covers the three-fifty charge
Madame Zoe lets go of Sissy's thumbs and wipes her hands on her kimono
Husband
Mrs
Hankshaw withdraws a bill from her rat-skin bag
Beg your pardon
Husband
Will she find a husband
Oh,  see
Madame Zoe takes Sissy's hand and gives it the old tall-dark- stranger squint
see men in your life, honey also see women, lots of women
She raises her eyes to meet Sissy's looking for an admission of the "tendency", but there is no signal
Mrs
Hankshaw does not approve
husband, no doubt about it, though he is years away
There are children, too
Five, maybe six, but the husband is not the father
They will inherit your characteristics
Mrs
Hankshaw, aghast, has heard plenty, and she ushers her daughter out of the trailer as if she were leading her from a burning cocktail lounge
: (Delores del Ruby) Views of vast vistas of arid grasslands, open and unmodulated, thirsty and exposed
At the western edge of the , the monotony of the landscape, now gradually tilting toward the Rockies, is interrupted by the Badlands -- sculptured canyons so deep and chaotic they can break a devil's heart
Between the grasslands and the eerie badlands ruins, there lies a narrow band of humpy hills, green and pastoral
The hills are carpeted with midlength prairie grass
The Rubber Rose buildings are clustered at the badlands end at the base of a butte, higher, broader and longer than any in its vicinity, known as Siwash Ridge
a sign over the entry of the ranch reads: Welcome to the Rubber Rose Ranch (the largest all-girl ranch in the west) Delores del Ruby arrives at the Rubber Rose Ranch, carrying a whip at her side and batting an educated lash at the surrounding sights
've traveled through the Yucatan with a circus, popping false eyelashes off a trained monkey with a bullwhip
When  ate peyote one night and had a vision
Niwetukame, the Mother Goddess, came to me on the back of a doe, hummingbirds sipping the tears she was shedding, crying 'Delores, you must lead my daughters against their natural enemy
You must come to the Rubber Rose Ranch and prepare for your mission, the details of which will be revealed to you in a third vision
' That night  whipped the shit out of my black lover and ran away
For a while  drove around, making a living selling peyote buttons to hippies, until  made my way here
snake crosses the road in front of her, and she takes her whip and whirls it around her head
The snake that is crawling across the dusty road that leads to the ranch is carrying a card under its forked tongue
Delores snaps her whip at the snake and picks the card out of his mouth and lets it fly in the air
Delores catches it
The card is the Queen of Spades
Sissy is thirty years old now wearing a trademark colored jumpsuit
She is saying these words still: "Greater freedom of movement
" Sissy sticks out her thumb, even though there is no traffic
plane is flying overhead
Sissy hitches it; and the plane's flight path curves with in response to her gesture
squirrel running by stops to look
The bus on the other side of the road skids to a stop and two cars coming her way stop as well
The man driving looks over the back seat to the hitchiker behind him
The bus driver does the same
From the look of her Sissy is a very seasoned hitchhiker, and she turns around relatively unimpressed with the fact that a car has stopped for her
'
The man driving is black-skinned, beret-topped and he has four smiling gold teeth and six shiny brass saxaphones in the back seat
He wears a gardenia in his lapel and tokes on a short joint
Going north
You bet your raggedy white ass  am
Sissy gets in
He turns up the volume of his radio and rockets north
Sissy ventures into her pocket and pulls out a slice of cheese and offers it to him
He now gets a better look at her unusual thumbs
They are elegant, but large boned, and disproportionate
They are banana shaped boats that makes it a little awkward to hold onto the cheese
(taking an alarming interest in her thumbs) Thanks
American Cheese
The king of road food
He eats the cheese, and worries about the thumbs
He tokes on the joint between his fingers
Are you in show business
was a successful model once
For magazines
was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off
So now you're bummin' around
Yep
Hitchhiking
'm the best
You're the best
When  was younger,  hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways
Whooee
As  developed, however,  grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style
Time in terms of
no longer interested me
began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast
When  am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then  embody the rhythms of the universe
am in a state of grace
The man listening to her takes another toke on his joint

featuring the song "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues" as sung by (an undetermined country or pop star like k
d
lang or Bob Dylan) in an old television Kine-scope piece of film like you might see on early 1950's television sets
Between Sissy watching this image on old motel televisions, there are also  of roads, cars, trucks, highways, thumbs, gas stations and deserts gliding by in a flow of natural hitchhiking beauty
Sissy gets out of a large eighteen wheel truck and walks into a United States Post Office
Sissy at the window picking up some mail, and opening a lavender colored letter that reeks of perfume, she is surprised to read this: Sissy, Precious Being, How are you, my extraordinary one worry so
Next time you are near Manhattan, do ring me up
There is a man to whom  simply must introduce you
Thrill
-The Countess Sissy looks at the envelope and return address
Elaborately embossed is the Countess' logo
' The elaborately embossed envelope is now being sealed
The Countess gives it a licking
Beside him is a young watercolorist named Julian
will send this out to Sissy, she should get it in a week, and you will be able to meet her
When send a letter to Sissy, duplicates must be sent to
Post Office Boxes in LaConner, Taos, Pine Ridge, Cherokee and that other place, for her to pick up
Why she's probably out there right now in Hibbing, Minnesota, or Deluth, Montana
hitching her way across the country
Sissy is talking to a trucker as they pass down the road
Right off,  don't remember how old was when  found out  was part Indian
My mamma's family, a lot of them, had lived out West, in the Dakotas, and one of them had married a squaw
Siwash tribe
My pleasure in Indianhood and my passion for car travel might be incongruous if not mutually exclusive
After all, the first car that ever stopped for me had been named in honor of the great chief of the Ottawa: Pontiac
In the distance, Sissy spies her destination
It's still a helluva town
Sissy gets out of the truck and looks up at a large building
' Sit down dear, do sit down
Sissy Hankshaw takes a seat
The Countess lifts a dusty decanter
Take a load off those lovely tootsies
Yes, sit right down
Would you fancy some sherry
The decanter is empty, a stiff fly lies feet up on it's lip
Shit  goodness, 'm all out of sherry; how about some Red Ripple
He reaches into a midget refrigerator beside his desk and pulls out some pop wine
You know what Red Ripple is don't you
It's Kool-Aid with a hard on
Tee Hee
Sissy manages a polite smile
She looks at a heavily finger printed glass
(he toasts) To my own special Sissy
Cheers
And welcome
So my letter brought ya flying, eh
Where were you
Salt Lake City
La Conner
Well,  may have a little surprise for you
But first, tell me about yourself
It's been six months, hasn't it
In some circles that's half a year
How are you
Tired
That's the very first time in the eons that 've known you that 've ever heard you complain
And now you're tired, poor darling
born freak can only go uphill
Freak, schmeek
Most of us are freaks in one way or another
Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what mean
've always been proud of the way nature singled me out
It's the people who have been deformed by society feel sorry for
've been steady moving for eleven years and some months
Maybe  should rest up for a spell, 'm not as young as  used to be
Shit  goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever
Does that mean you might have an assignment for me
The Countess taps his monocle with his cigarette holder
He looks on his wall, and on a poster advertising a feminine hygene product, Yoni Yum Dew Spray, stands Sissy Hankshaw, her thumbs neatly hidden, chopped off by the borders of the photograph
You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see, (peruses the ad layouts on the wall) from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy
You've always smelled so nice
Like a little sister
The irony has just killed me
You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew
loath the stink of females
They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking
Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party
They all stink
From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink
Bonanza Jellybean
What
Oh yes
Tee-hee
Jellybean
The Countess's jaw muscles calm down, his dentures ease into a samba
She's a young thing who works on my ranch
Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that
She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly
But she stinks like a slut just the same
Your ranch
Oh my dear yes,  bought a little ranch out West, sort of a tribute to the women of America who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products, Dew spray mist and Yoni Yum spray powder
tax write-off, actually
He looks out his window as a squirrel crosses Park Avenue
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways
The Countess has arranged a job for you
And what a job
job for me
am once more about to make advertising history
And only you, the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could possibly assist me
The Countess hands Sissy an article that she reads clenched in her fist
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes
Although the  judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings
Shit  dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic
The nerve of those twits
What do they know about female odor
Don't interrupt
Here's my concept
My ranch out West
It's a beauty ranch
Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes
But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment
My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world
So get this
It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes
The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence
Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do
've never seen them, understand, but hear they're magnificent
Very big specimens --  mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads
Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance
It's just the wildest show in nature
It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons
Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground
Dears, it's overwhelming
And picture the birds doing their sex dance on
Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope
With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground
In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black
In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum
And a can of Dew
Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy
sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love
Are you starting to get it
Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud
My very goodness gracious
Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it
've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around
You're my eternal favorite
Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, 'm out of photography now and into water colors
Ah how circuitous conversation is
We're back at the beginning
The exact man 've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist
Sissy dares a sip of Red Ripple
If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him
Purely personal
believe you might enjoy one another
But Countess
Now, now
Don't get exasperated realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and  might add, you've been wise
Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage
For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, , pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about
But for a woman marriage is surrender
The Countess refills his glass
The squirrel starts across Park Avenue again but doesn't make it
The uniformed chauffeur gets out of a limousine and holds the crushed animal up where it can be seen by an elderly woman passenger
But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you
Why, yes, technically
Jack Kerouac and  came awfully close, but he was afraid of me,  think
Yes, well, what 'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity
She can't wait too long, you know
Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours
mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all
(her brow spaghettied) What makes you think this watercolorist and  would develop a romantic relationship
can't be certain that you would
But what have you got to lose
Well, okay
'll try it
don't see the point in it, but 'll try it
Just for you
It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City
However
Good, good, good
you'll enjoy it, you'll see
Julian is a gentleman
Suddenly the Countess swivels in his desk chair and leans forward
Lowering his wine glass, he focuses directly, intensely into Sissy's blue eyes
His smile widens
By the way, Sissy
he's a full blooded Indian
title: The Outhouse Radio is playing "The Starving Armenians Polka" and Bonanza Jellybean and Delores del Ruby are in the privy, caught in the rain
Well, 'm not scared of a little rain
Me neither
Might as well brave it
Right
don't know about you but 'm sure not sweet enough to melt
Delores flicks her whip at a sweat bee that has taken refuge in the privy and hits the photograph of Dale Evans upon which it has lit
Jelly looks out the door of the outhouse across a cut green lawn to a bunkhouse where we can see a gathering of other cowgirls
There is a fly buzz and a distant polka yip
Way off horse lips flutter
Bonanza spies a picture of Sissy Hankshaw, an advertisement for Yoni Yum Dew Spray mist, on the privy wall
(musing) Someday
if that Sissy Hankshaw ever shows up here, 'm gonna teach her how to hypnotize a chicken
Chickens are the easiest critters on Earth to hypnotize
If you can look a chicken in the eyes for tens seconds, it's yours forever
meeting is in progression in the bunkhouse that morning
Mary is addressing the group
want to complain that some of the cowgirls have been sleeping two to a bunk again, in violation of the agreement that "crimes against nature" are to be confined to the hayloft
don't care who lay with whom or where or how, but the moaners, groaners and screamers ought to turn down their volume when others are trying to sleep or meditate
Some of the younger cowgirls blush
want to complain about the food around here
It's rotten to the core
round of support from the other cowgirls in the form of cattle calls
Jelly and Delores are getting ready to run through the rain, when all of a sudden, Jelly spies a barefoot cowgirl -- it's Debbie -- run across the yard in her karate robe, jump on the Exercycle that is rusting in the weeds and begin pumping the pedals furiously in the yammering rain
My sacred crocodile
She's flipped
But in a minute, others follow Debbie, everyone of them, in fact; the entire bunkhouse load of them, some thirty young cowgirls, squealing, giggling, They slide and roll on the wet grass, push each other into the mud that is forming by the corral fence, chase one another in and out of the thick folds of rain draperies, stamp their cute feet in puddles and do bellyflops into the overflowing horse trough
The cowgirls frolic until, as suddenly as it has come, the rain goes away
Play ceases
They are panting like puppies as they lean against one another or pick clods of mud from one another's hair
move that the meeting be adjourned
At the end of the endless game, there is friendship
What the heck did she mean by that
Just that in Heaven all business is conducted this way
In the lobby, the doors of an elevator open revealing Sissy inside wearing a buttoned up dress
Very formal looking for her
There is Julian standing in the lobby
He turns and walks toward Sissy
He is wearing a rather formal looking plaid sport coat with blue cummerbund
He extends his hand to meet her, and (perhaps at the sight of Sissy's thumbs) Julian has an asthma attack, doubling over in front of her
Sissy doesn't know whether to assist Julian or flee
From the other side of the lobby, two - , white, mid-thirties and upper middle class come to the rescue
The younger of the men, , takes charge
He breaks an inhaler of dinephrine under Julian's nose
We'd better take you home
In the red of embarrassment, Julian looks more Indian than he had previously
Wheezing, he speaks: beg your pardon
've been enthralled with your photographs for years
When the Countess hinted that you might like to meet me -- he never explained why --  was ready to paint for him free of charge
And now had to go and spoil it
Rupert is helping Julian to the street
Rupert is a salesman for a publishing house
His wife Carla, a homemaker, as they say
The other couple breaks down into Howard and Marie Barth, both copywriters for an ad agency
Howard hails a cab and Carla and Marie flutter around Sissy
This is dreadful
(lowering her voice confidentially) You know, asthma attacks are brought on by emotional stress
Poor Julian is so high strung
The excitement of meeting you -- my dear, you look so stunning
-- must have upset his chemical balance
Carla nods
Everyone is piling into the taxi
Come on, Sissy, don't be afraid of us
've never ridden in a cab
The whole idea of paying for a ride makes my thumbs hurt
Sissy is forced to suffer the indignity of riding in a vehicle she wasn't responsible for flagging with her own thumbs
It'll be all right, dear
It isn't as serious as it sounds
Carla starts to pat Sissy's hand, then decides to leave the thumbs to themselves
The six of them are squeezed into the taxi
Sissy looks out the window of the taxi: '  as the taxi stops at a light, she can see a newsstand headline on the front page of the New York Daily News: ,        ' ' stops in front of Julian's building
It discharges its passengers
' Howard mixes Scotch and sodas, Rupert fills a syringe from a vial of aminophylline he has taken from its place behind a gelatin salad mold in the refrigerator
He gives Julian an injection
There, that ought to beat them bronchial buggers into submission
He turns to Sissy
was a medic in the Army
really should have become a doctor
Sometimes, though,  feel that pushing books is a whole lot like pushing medicine
Think of books as pills have pills that cure ignorance and pills that cure boredom
have pills to elevate moods and pills to open people's eyes to the awful truth
Too bad you don't have a pill for bullshit
Carla smiles as if she were joking, but she'd said it tartly
Rupert glares and takes a big bite of Scotch
(changing the subject) Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw
'm staying with the Countess
know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York
don't
You don't
Well, no,  don't reside anywhere in particular
just keep moving
Everyone looks a bit astonished including the recumbent Julian
traveler, eh
You might say that, although  don't think of it as traveling
How do you think of it
As moving
Oh
How
unusual
Mmmmm
Rupert bites into his Scotch again
Julian issues a watery wheeze
Then, silence
Rupert, before you get too engrossed in your research on Scotch as a cure for aging, don't you think you'd better phone Elaine's and cancel our dinner reservations
Sissy leaves her chair and wanders about the apartment
Which is full of books and shelves
(
) What would we do without you, Carla
Without our little efficiency expert, Carla, everything would just go to hell
Carla is thinking about running for mayor next year, aren't you, Carla
(
) Up yours, Herr Doktor Book Salesman
Will the demands of your medical practice allow you to call Elaine's or shall
(
) Oh let me do it
Sissy is intrigued by an antique here and an object d'art there, but she knows she is in an alien environment
' Sissy enters a bedroom There is a covered birdcage
She sits upon the bed listening for a 'cheep' from the birds
And gradually she reclines
Then turning her head to the side against the bedspread: No Indian blankets
no Indian blankets
And she blacks out
And the sound drifts away in waves, so there is only the whistle of a distant wind through the mortar of the apartment building
Until one by one, we see button necks freed
Soon Sissy can feel it
Someone is undressing her
In a voice webby with sleep she lifts her head up, and sees Howard and Marie
Where are the others
Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home
Julian fell asleep on the couch; we covered him up
We thought that we should make you comfortable too
Sissy thinks this is nice, but wonders, however, why they are both in their underwear
Yes, thanks
Between the two of them, they have gotten Sissy out of her dress in no time
Sissy feels she should apologize for not having on a brassiere
Marie slips out of her own brassiere and moves her bare bosom close to Sissy's
Mine are fuller but yours are more perfectly shaped
Highly debatable
'll wager they're the exact same size
Howard cups his left hand about a Marie breast and his right about one of Sissy's
He weighs them in his palms, squeezes them the way an honest grocer squeezes excess water from a lettuce, and spreads his fingers to sample their circumference
Hmm
Yours are larger, Marie, but Miss Hankshaw's -- Sissy's -- are more firm
You'd think they would have started to droop;  mean, from not wearing a bra
Howard
Watch your manners
You've made her blush
Here, Sissy, let me compare
Marie seizes Sissy's free breast, quickly, like a monkey picking a fruit, rolling it about in her hungry little finger, rubbing it against her chin and cheeks
and
it was like her earlier days as a hitchhiker
nostalgic
tropical plums
(in ecstasy) This place is finer than the place live
Like a disc jockey from Paradise, Howard flips Marie over and plays her  side
Every now and then she reaches for Sissy to include her, but the laws of physics insist on being obeyed
Over and over Marie calls Sissy's name with half-closed eyes
The Barths are really going at it, Marie yowling like a cat
The  in the kitchen begins to growl
So this is what it's like
so this is what it's really like
Sissy bounces out of the bed and patters through the living room and crawls under the cover with Julian
Julian stirs awake
Oh, Sissy
am sorry about all the fuss
Julian and Sissy embrace and go at it under the covers But suddenly: Julian stops after a brief climax
(with downcast eyes) apologize
Sissy cradles Julian and comforts him
It is the measure of Western Civilization that it can encompass in harmony, balance off, as it were, such divergent masterworks as '  and , as the dome of the Sistine Chapel and the ceiling of the Paris opera
Sissy sits up, her eyes moping about the apartment, looking but not seeing the macrame wallhangings, the volumes of Robert Frost
What's the matter
After a while Sissy answers
'm cold
Here
'll turn down the air conditioner
It's not the air conditioner that's making me cold
Nothing moves in here
Not even your birds
Sissy gets out of bed and begins to dress
What are you doing
Getting dressed
've got to go
But  don't want you to leave
Please stay
We can go to dinner
owe you a dinner
And tonight
we can
really make love
have to go, Julian
Why
Why do you have to go
(somewhat frantic) My thumbs hurt
've made a mistake
've been negligent
haven't exercised
have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what
It's like a musician practicing his scales
When  don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore
Sissy trembles while she kisses her thumbs
will hitch with you, out where tall birds wade in a lake named for my Siwash kin
Out where Smokey the Bear lay down his shovel to romp with more playful beasts
Out where starlight has no enemies and the badland wind no friends
Out where the boogie stops and the woogie begins
And Sissy is now traveling in a truck passing Fourteenth Street on her way to the Geo
Washington Bridge
View of that Bridge as the truck crosses it to New Jersy
View of the wilds of New Jersey as Sissy travels to the West
' The Countess is on the phone
So she left town
Well, that shouldn't surprise you
Leaving town is what Sissy is all about
But tell me, how did she strike you
Julian is on the other end of the phone
Extraordinary
She's obviously that
Jesus
Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies
Oh, you
'm not talking about her hands
They're difficult to ignore, confess, but 'm speaking of her whole being
Her whole being is extraordinary
The way she talks, for example
She's so articulate
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language
Countess
'm really in a dither
She's turned my head
Ninety degrees to the left,  hope
How does she feel about you
think she's disappointed that 'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic
She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians
'm sure she liked me, though; but
then she left town
She always leaves town, you dummy
That doesn't mean anything
What about in bed
How does she like it in bed
Julian pauses for a very long moment
How does she like what in bed
Like what
The Countess' teeth chatter in his mouth
What do you think
Well
er
Shit  dear, Julian
Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on
Whose fault was that
suppose it was mine
Yes, it definitely was my fault
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway
Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you
They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck
Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy
Jesus
Christ
If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps
Oogie boogie
If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink
' Next thing  know, you'll be calling me 'chief
' Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake
What guy
Aw, he's some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out West
Gives my ranch the creeps and the willies, too
But though he be old and dirty, he's alive, 'll bet, clear down to his toes
They don't have his juice in a jar in New Haven
Well  suppose that 'll have to write Sissy out on the road
Sissy makes little puffs of dust as she walks
From the direction of the ranch a  Microbus is approaching
It is painted with mandalas, lamaistic dorjes and symbols representing "the clear light of the void
" When the Microbus draws alongside Sissy it stops
Inside are two men and a woman
They are approximately twenty-four years old
Are you a pilgrim
No, 'm more of an Indian The trio doesn't smile
She means are you going to see the Chink
Oh,  may and  may not
But seeing him is not my main objective out here
That's good
Because he won't see you
We came all the way from Minneapolis to see him and the crazy bastard tried to stone us to death Yeah, but  no longer believe that guy's a master
He's just a dirty, uptight old mountain man
Why, he pulled out his pecker and shook it at Barbara
'd stay away from there if  were you, lady
Sissy walks on leaving the people in the bus arguing about whether the Chink's rock-shower and pecker-wag actually had been intended as spiritual messages
down the long dirt road, Sissy stops to take a breather and sits down on a log
Sissy thinking and looking into the clouds
Waves of grasses whisper her name: Ssssssssss, Sssssssssssss Sisssy
Meadowlarks squander their songs on her as she begins to squirm on the log
Lincoln Continental drives up suddenly
Sissy barely has time to zip up
The Cadillac stops in front of Sissy
teenaged girl in a Stetson is at the wheel
The rear door of the limousine opens and a refined matronly voice calls from the void
By any chance are you Sissy Hankshaw
Yes  am
chic middle-aged woman leans out of the car
My goodness
Why didn't you telephone
Someone would have driven into Mottburg to pick you up
'm Miss Adrian
From the ranch
The Countess wrote that  should expect you
Get in, won't you
You must be exhausted
Gloria, assist Miss Hankshaw with her luggage
Gloria nods at Sissy amicably but doesn't make a move to help her
Sissy swings her sack into the roomy vehicle
Before she gets in she flashes her thumb to hitch a ride
The instant that Sissy shuts the door the cowgirl chauffeur floors the Cadillac and it lurches away in a puff of dust
Sitting up after the bothersome lurch of the car
Little twit
(turns to Sissy) You really ought to have phoned
We were just in Mottburg escorting some guests to the afternoon train
(sighs) More guests leaving ahead of schedule
Three checked out today
They decided to transfer to Elizabeth Arden's Maine Chance spa in Phoenix, Arizona
It costs two hundred and fifty dollars a week less at the Rubber Rose, so why are our guests leaving and going to Elizabeth Arden's
Miss Adrian pushes a button that sends a partition glass between her and the cowgirl driver
Gloria starts laughing silently on the other side of the glass
'll tell you why, it's that plague of cowgirls
They've gradually infiltrated every sector of our program
The one named Debbie considers herself an expert on exercising and diet
With Bonanza Jellybean's permission and against my explicit orders, she's been coercing the guests into trying something called kundalini yoga
Do you know what that is
It's trying to mentally force a serpent of fire to crawl up your spinal column
Miss Hankshaw, our guests can't comprehend kundalini yoga, let alone do it
Yesterday, she ordered a new cookbook by a Tibetan Negro, entitled Third Eye in the Kitchen: Himalayan Soul Food
God knows what that will be like
The little barbarians are destroying everything that 've built, mocking all that the company stands for
And there's a new one, one they call del Ruby
She has the good will of a scorpion
've considered it prudent to avoid a confrontation that might further upset the guests
But now that the season is practically over -- we operate April through September -- and the Countess is finally coming
The limousine pulls up in the drive
' Our Ranch has all the latest in modern facilities
We see women having facials
' We have a facial wing, and next to that is the Hair Barn
Sissy is being given a tour by Miss Adrian
variety of hairdos are witnessed
We have a team of fifteen hair experts from all over the world
And fanny flab flies off in this room at the rate of six hundred and seventy-five pounds a day
that's a lot of salted ham, Sissy
Sissy and Miss Adrian walk through the lodge lobby, guests and cowgirls are conducting a variety of activities: projects slides of whooping cranes on the wall and is giving a lecture about the habits of the birds
In the center of the room   is leading a mixture of cowgirls and guests in a meditative chant as they reach high above their heads in a yoga exercise
Miss Adrian stops in front of the registration desk and Sissy catches glimpses of the chaotic lobby
Our special guest Miss Sissy Hankshaw is with us
The receptionist hands Miss Adrian a key to Sissy's room
makes a face at Sissy as she walks by carrying a tray of herbal teas
representative of the film crew is being intimidated by a Cowgirl who is looking though his camera lenses and shaking them and listening to them like you would put a shell up to your ear to hear the ocean
Cool
We're going to make a movie
Another cowgirl,  , is lifting a piece of furniture and passes it to her accomplice
Get rid of the furniture
it's too masculine
Get rid of all the furniture and use it for kindling
Break away from these pig-like chauvinist masculine influences
Miss Adrian looks on helplessly
she grabs Sissy and leads her out of the lobby
Miss Adrian and Sissy walk out the back door of the Ranch and out near a corral, to the sound of gunfire
merciful Jesus
They're murdering the guests
One of the    is hanging out in the corral wearing a shiny jacket with  printed on the back
Miss Adrian grabs him by the shoulders and shakes him
Where are the guests
Take it easy, lady
They went on a short ride with the cowgirls
Rode over the hill yonder
You're Miss Adrian, aren't you
We need to talk to you about the filming
Not now, you fool, not now
Those crazed bitches have led innocent women out and are slaughtering them at this moment
We'll all be killed
Oh
Ohhh
Another  spits out a wad of chewing gum
There's a slaughter going on all right, but it's not the fat ladies that are getting it
Your hired hands are killing the cattle
The cattle
They're killing the cows
All of them
(interrupted while putting a zoom lens on his camera) That's what they said, Miss Adrian
devilish young cowgirl is sitting on a fence nearby
Miss Adrian addresses her
How dare you slaughter the Countess's cattle
What is a ranch without cows
We're going to replace them with goats
Most of the cattle are diseased and in pain
We're just putting them out of their misery
According to Bon-an-za Jellybean, the Rubber Rose is in-di-cat-ive of the Countess's values
He has purchased a cheap weak strain of cow to begin with and with improper care
Oh heavens
don't want to hear what Bonanza Jellybean has been telling you girls
Come on Sissy
'll show you to your quarters
, , with his back to us looks down on the ranch from the ridge and watches Miss Adrian lead Sissy into a small guest cottage on the ranch
, Sissy stirs in a nicely appointed guest cottage
maid knocks on the door and serves Sissy breakfast in bed
Excuse me, Miss
Do you care for your breakfast now
Sissy sits up and rubs her eyes
Yeah
feel a bit hungry
The Maid puts the tray down, and the cloth that covers the food is lifted away to reveal a shocking display of grease and calories
vase of prairie asters stands over a double-meat cheeseburger, a package of Hostess Twinkies, a cold can of Dr
Pepper and a Three Musketeers bar
Sissy is delighted
Road food
How did you know
Well it is a change of our usual grapefruit and melba toast, 'm sure
Sissy notices a card
It reads: Compliments of Bonanza Jellybean Bonanza Jellybean
She will be up to see you directly
Sissy devours her meal
Out her window she can see women on exercycles, women doing jumping jacks and women in beauty parlors
pounds on Sissy's door
Jelly, a cowgirl so cute she makes Sissy blush just to look at her
She wears a tan Stetson with an aster pinned to it, a green satin shirt embroidered with rearing stallions snorting orange fire from their nostrils
Her breasts bounce like dinner rolls that have gotten loaded on helium and, between red tinged cheeks, where more baby fat is taking its time maturing, she has a little smile that can cause minerals and plastics to remember their ancient animate connections
Jelly grasps Sissy's elbow and sits on the side of the bed
Welcome, podner
By God, it's great to have you here
It's an honor
Sorry  took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do
Er, you seem to know who  am, and maybe even what  am
Thanks for the breakfast
Oh,  know about Sissy Hankshaw, all right
've done a little hitchhiking myself
Ah shucks, that's like telling Annie Oakley you're a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone
'd heard tales about you from people 'd meet in jail cells and truckstops
heard about your, uh, your, ah, your wonderful thumbs, and  heard how you were Jack Kerouac's girl friend
Sissy sets her tray on the bedside table
No, 'm afraid that part isn't true
Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down
We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover
Besides,  always travel alone
Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway
The beatnicks were before my time, and never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, cliches and the clap
But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl
The guests are huffing and puffing in between the pauses in conversation, in the background through the window in Sissy's room
Tell me about it
About
About being a cowgirl
What's it all about
When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl
Cowgirls exist as an image
fairly common image
The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture
Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail
Otherwise, they're being fooled
In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls
Two
And both of 'em are trick-riders
Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos
Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks
That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking
' Jelly lays her hand atop the oval mound Sissy's thumb makes under the covers
You're political, then
No, ma'am
No way
There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but  don't share their views
got no cowgirl ideology to expound
"Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it
" There is a moment when the two girls feel something between each other
Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth
It's not original
It's something picked up from the Chink
Really
The Chink, huh
've gathered that you sometimes speak with him
What else have you learned from the Chink
Learned from the Chink
Oh my
Ha ha
That's hard to say
We mostly
Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy
Jelly pauses
Oh yeah, now that  think of it, the Chink taught me something about cowgirls
Did you realize that cowgirls have been around for many centuries
Long before America
In ancient India the care of the cattle was always left up to young women they called gopis
Being alone with the cows all the time, the gopis got awfully horny, just like we do here
Every gopi was in love with Krishna, a good-looking young god who played the flute like it was going out of style When the moon was full, this Krishna would play his flute by a river and call the gopis to him
Then he would multiply himself sixteen thousand times -- one for each gopi -- and make love to each one the way she most desired
There they were, sixteen thousand gopis balling Krishna on the river bank, and the energy of their merging was so great that it created a huge oneness, a total union of love, and it was God
Wow
Quite a picture, huh
Sissy's thumb twitches
Jelly swallows hard
They gaze into each other's eyes
pierces the sunlight outside the window
That couldn't be Krishna, could it
bit shrill for a flute
Just our rotten luck
Jelly walks to the window and exchanges hand signals with someone outside
Gotta run now
Delores says 'm needed
Somebody's here
Maybe it's the Countess
Jelly spins her six-shooter in her kewpie fingers
Sissy, cowgirl history is about to be made
'm damn glad you're here to witness it
She holsters her gun and blows Sissy a kiss, then is gone out the door
Sissy hops out of bed and from the window she can see cowgirls gathering in a circle
Someone or something is in the center of the circle
Sissy zips herself into a red jumpsuit and hurries outside
What was in the center of the circle was a goat
Debbie was scratching the animal's ears
She was hugging it
It's cute
Way cuter than a cow
Goats are always testing you
They're like Zen masters
They can tell instantly if you're faking your feelings
So they play games with you to keep you true
People should go to goats instead of psychiatrists
It's so loving
Gloria cuts in on Debbie and gives the beast a hug
Look at those playfully wise eyes
Ooo
It licked me
More and more people are discovering that cow's milk isn't fit for human consumption
Billy West says if we can produce enough goat's milk on the ranch to make it worth his while, he'll run it into Fargo regularly
She pauses and looks around the group in the circle
'm aware that Tad Lucas rode broncs until her ninth month, but  don't think pregnant cowgirls are going to be any asset on this ranch
hope you itchy clits who are sneaking down to the lake every night are taking precautions
It's bad enough we've got cranes coming; we don't need storks
feel that those film makers should be removed from the Rubber Rose as soon as possible
Men can cause nothing but trouble here
also feel that our guest (she nods at Sissy) should be excused while we discuss this matter further
Hurt, Sissy leaves the group
Views of Sissy in her Whooping crane outfit dancing to Debussy in front of the Disney film crew
The documentary being directed by an effusive Frenchman
View of the camera crew training their long telephoto lenses on Siwash Lake
They all seem to be wearing the same trademark satin baseball jackets with one logo or another on their backs
Another view of the lake, from above, from the Chink's point of view and our first view of
The Chink spies Sissy and Jelly coming over a ridge
We cannot hear them at first, but Sissy and Jelly are talking
Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened
Niwetukame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her
Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools
Tension
Cowgirl tension
What a drag
What is Debbie's position
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods
She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age
She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear
You don't agree with Debbie, then
wouldn't say that
expect she's right, ultimately
But 'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine
can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two
Ee
That grass tickles, doesn't it
God knows  love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits
Still this is cowgirl territory and 'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it
guess 've always been a scrapper
Look
This scar
Only twelve years old and  was felled by a silver bullet
Jelly takes Sissy's hand, carefully avoiding the thumbs and helps her feel the depression in her belly
The depression is a dimple, like another navel
, like intermission at a wolf dance, rhythms are established
Jelly and Sissy are socked into one another now, and they arch and push and corkscrew and jackknife softly but with pronounced cadence
Everything becomes scrambled
They rock each other in cradles of sweat and saliva, until we can see nothing
Noisy breaths buck out of Sissy: "Jelly, Jelly" but she can't hear Sissy because she is screaming
Hysterical from the scalding hot softness of girl-love
The Chink looks on from the hilltop above indifferently
Sissy and Jelly are riding on the back of a horse
is spied by Sissy as she rides on the back of Jellybean's horse back to the ranch
Delores and Big Red hurry to meet them
He's here
Sure enough across the yard, in the midst of the low-cal barbecue in progress, monocle reflecting sunlight, cigarette holder stabbing the air, stands the Countess
Look at him
Perverse as a pink pickle
Sick as a vice squad
He's in a snit
He wants to see you right after the barbecue
Jellybean chuckles sardonically and dismounts
Get the girls
He's gonna see me right now
Sissy, confused, and loyalties torn in the face of an impending revolution, leaves the corral and ,
As she locks the latch she hears Jelly's voice
Jelly has taken over the ranch loudspeaker system and is giving an ultimatum
Any of you ladies who would like to join us, you're welcome to stay on as a full working podner at the Rubber Rose
Rest of you get packed -- and mean now
You've got fifteen minutes to move your lard asses off this ranch
Women are reacting to the demands
Some women are taking up trowels and brooms as weapons
The help is joining the revolt
Other women are running for their lives
' She hears the screen door screech open and a chaos of footsteps in the hall
She goes to her window
And she can see, partially cut off by the corner of the building, Miss Adrian screaming
You will all be rounded up and sent to prison if you take this any farther
This is not your ranch
The Countess seems to be taking it slowly, and calmly smoking a French cigarette
He observes the fighting among them with amusement
You pathetic little cutesy-poos
Do you actually suppose this exhibition of childlike melodrama is advancing the cause of freedom
You owe us this here ranch, as a token payment for your disgusting exploitations (tranquilly) Then take it
Go for it, girls
The hands, who carry axes, picks, pitchforks and shovels, retreat
The Countess, still grinning, reaches for an hors d'oeuvre and subjects his cigarette to a measured, self- assured puff
(shaking her fist) Go to your bunkhouse and remain there
The guests are hurriedly packing their things
' She looks on
When the revolutionaries have retreated about thirty yards, they stop
With astonishing rapidity, they unbuckle unbutton and unzip and step out of their jeans and underpants
Then, nude from the waist down, thatched pubises thrust forward, up front and leading the way, they begin to advance
The Countess's grin goes down his throat like bathwater down a drain
Better reach for your spray cans
Not one of these pussies has been washed in a week
Rather pale, his nose twitching, the Countess drops the caviar canape he has been holding
, pelvises pumping, laying down what the trembling Countess believes to be a devastating barrage of musk
Miss Adrian, lost in her own hysteria, charges
barbeque fork she hurls draws blood from Heather's eyebrow
Quick as a frog's tongue, Delores's whip cracks
It's lash curls around the ranch manager's ankles, pulling her feet from under her
She hits the sod in a jangle of jewelry and expulsion of breath
Molotov cocktail thrown by Big Red says hello to the sexual reconditioning building
Within seconds, the structure is blazing
-  storm into the beauty parlor and exercise rooms
breaking glass and wood splintering
The air is singing with cries of "Wahoo," Yippee," "Let 'er buck" and "The vagina is a self-cleaning organ
" flees the house as she hunkers down out the back door
Sissy running across it
She passes the pool, and falls in
Climbing out, wet, scared, she runs to the base of Siwash Ridge and southward along the mountain's foot
Sissy comes to a place where the juniper bushes are broken to reveal a crude path beginning a steep ascent
Sissy decides to climb up it
She shoulders her way through low, slivery boughs
Approximately halfway up the ridge she rests on a flat rock from which she can look down on the
smoking away, distant yahoos and carryings on can be heard
Horses whinney in the corral
few gunshots are thrown into the soundtrack if things aren't lively enough
' ,  , roars out of the drive
Sissy looks up to the quiet mountain
Pauses
Then she looks back to the chaos below
' drive away
Sissy sits and wonders
The sun is setting on the horizon, mixing well with the firelight that the Rubber Rose is giving off
is aware of something watching her
Looking about she sees nothing
of an empty trail
a quivering bush
Sissy turns to the sound of the
Ha ha ho ho hee hee
Standing only ten yards away
The Chink's problem is that he looks like he rolled out of a Zen scroll, as if he says "presto" a lot, knows the meaning of lightning and the origin of dreams
He  as if he drinks dew and fucks snakes
Sissy and the Chink scrutinize one another with mutual fascination
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee
Sissy is just about to speak, but before she does whirls, and scampers up the mountainside
Wait
Warily he stops and turns, poised to flee again
Sissy smiles
her ripe right thumb
And jerking it and swooshing it, she hitchhikes the Chink and his mountain
where Sissy's thumbs have stopped him
The Chink wears the wary look of a wild animal
He's not going to stay stopped long
It is Sissy's move
Well, aren't you going to shake your whanger at me
The Chink pauses for a moment, then he slaps his thighs and giggles hysterically
Ha has, ho hos and hee hees squirt out of his nose and through the gaps in his teeth
(laughter dies a nervous chipmunk death) Follow me
'll fix you supper
doggedly walk up the steep trail
'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's
know who you are
Oh
Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch
came up here to get out of the way
It's so dark now doubt if  could find my way back down
If you could help
(voice that wears no pants) Save your breath for the climb
takes another look at the Rubber Rose, which is now quiet
We can hear faintly a distant popping of washcloths and girlish laughter
make their way into a depression at the top of the mountain down a ladder of sticks
lights a large fire in the middle of the depression
puts a kettle of stew over the fire, and begins to roast yams
'  as the fire dances off it
water chestnuts is opened
: Sissy and the Chink eating supper on a rough wooden bench
, the Chink goes into a cave and returns with a tiny peppermint-stripped plastic transistor radio
He switches it on and the silence is broken by "The Happy Hour Polka
" Still clutching the radio in one hand, the Chink hops into the wheel of firelight and begins to dance
Sissy walks around the fire watching the old geezer heel and toe, skip and hop
He flings his bones; he flings his beard
Yip
Yip
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee
Arms swimming, feet firecrackering, he dances and dances
When the song ends, the Chink puts the radio down as the news comes on
Personally,  prefer Stevie Wonder, but what the hell
Those cowgirls are always bitching because the only radio station in the area plays nothing but polkas, but  say you can dance to anything if you really feel like dancing
The Chink dances a little to the news, and then lifts Sissy by her shoulders and guides her onto his pock-marked dance floor
But  don't know how to polka
Neither do
ha ha ho ho hee hee
The radio strikes up the "Lawrence Welk is a Hero of the Republic Polka," and the Chink and Sissy dance arm in arm, their shadows reel against the curves of the depression in the mountain
Night birds fly past with fluttering feathers
bat flies out of the cave
The Chink escorts Sissy to a dark side of the depression and sits her down upon a pile of soft stuff: dried wheatgrass, faded Indian blankets and old down pillows without cases
(thinking) So this is how Jelly spends her visits to the Chink
twanging noise sounds from the bowels of the nearby cave
What was that
Clockworks
Clockworks
The Chink pauses to decide whether he should talk any further, then proceeds
The Clockworks is one reason that am here on Siwash Ridge
accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People
Siwash, huh
He was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer, and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this far-away Siwash Ridge
came to the Dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own
Sissy cradles her head in her arms, but is startled by a louder noise from the clockworks
The Chink is startled too
Bonk
sounds the cave, and then it chimes poing
The Chink smiles at the noise coming from his clockworks
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe
(he listens) ha ha ho ho and hee hee
The Clock People
The Chink leads Sissy into the cave where we see his clockworks
It is made of garbage can lids and old saucepans and lard tins and car fenders all wired together with baling wire
bat flies into it making a bong noise and the contraption moves a little
During the Second World War  busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American,  had been put there and watched over
found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead,  had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink
The Clock People mistook me for Chinese
And the name stuck
In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled "Indians" through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges, it is only fitting that "Indians" misnamed me
The Clock People, however, are not a tribe, rather they are a gathering of Indians from various tribes
They have lived together since 1906
gathering of the Clock People
woman is giving birth near the Giant timekeeping hourglass
The pivotal function of the Clock People is the keeping and observing of the clockworks
It is a real thing, and is kept at the center, at the soul, of the Great Burrow
Insofar as it is possible, all Clock People deaths and births occur in the presence of the clockworks
Aside from birthing or dying, the reason for the daily visits to the clockworks is to check the time
Sissy listens to the Chink as they walk around the Chink's clockworks
These people have no other ritual than this one
Likewise, they have but one legend or cultural myth: that of a continuum they call the Eternity of Joy
It is into the Eternity of Joy that they believe all men will pass once the clockworks is destroyed
The destruction must come from the outside, must come by natural means, must come at the will of this gesticulating planet whose more acute stirrings thoughtless people call "earthquakes
" The Chink holds Sissy's thumbs in his hands adoringly
The Earth is alive
She burns inside with the heat of cosmic longing
She longs to be with her husband again
She moans
She turns softly in her sleep
In the Eternity of Joy, pluralized, deurbanized man, at ease with his gentle technologies, will smile and sigh when the Earth begins to shake
loved those loony redskins, but  couldn't be a party to their utopian dreaming
After a while it occurred to me that the Clock People waiting for the Eternity of Joy was virtually identical to the Christians waiting for the Second Coming
Or the Communists waiting for the worldwide revolution
Or the Debbies waiting for the flying saucers
All the same
Just more suckers betting their share of the present on the future, banking every misery on a happy ending to history
Well, history is ending every second - happily for some of us, unhappily for others, happily one second, unhappily the next
History is always ending and always not ending
ha ha ho ho and hee hee
Sissy interrupts the Chink for a second while he is worshipping her thumbs
What do you believe in then
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee
Then he says nothing
And his silence makes Sissy weep
They sit down on a grass floor, illuminated by the fire outside the cave
Then the Chink, without hesitation, grasps her thumbs
He squeezes them, caresses them, covers them with wet kisses, telling them how beautiful they are
Sissy is bowled over, frightened, stunned, elated, moved almost to tears
Sissy bends her head back and whispers
If this be adultery, make the most of it
And as the Chink plunges into Sissy, she arches her spread bottom against the blankets and rears up to meet him halfway
Their bodies glowing in the firelight, they cast shadows of , anthropomorphs making love through the night under the moon
awaken Sissy
When she looks around she sees an inscription has been freshly scrawled on the right wall
;
And on the left wall: ;
Sissy hears and then sees   in the sky above the ranch
Sissy gets up and walks out of the cave
Sissy walks
Sissy hitches a ride out of town
Countless  on countless porches, and the headline of the St
Louis Post-Dispatch reads: ' The countess is in a snit
Sissy, don't play dumb with me
You're a good model but a shitty actress
The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance
You know perfectly well they are
Last seen in Nebraska
Didn't make it to Canada
Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada
The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake
And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds
How much do you know about it
Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows
don't know anything about it
Sissy
You're trying to protect those scuzzy bitches
Well, let your conscience be your guide, as my mommy used to say, but it won't work
Those stinking sluts are going to suffer
Sissy strikes the Countess with her right thumb -- with astonishing force
Immediately the thumb strikes again, this time shattering the Countess's monocle against his eye
(gasping) Shit  dear
fall onto the shag rug
The left thumb strikes
Sissy is swinging her thumbs like ballbats socking flaming homers over the left-field fence
The countess is out on his feet
His eyes are closed
His legs wobble
He does a pathetic dance, like a drunken old fool trying to boogie with a chorus girl
He topples forward and meets Sissy's onrushing thumb of thunder which straightens him up, sends him over backward
Motionless, he lies on the floor, a crimson part in his thinning hair, a bright ooze at each nostril
Seated on a spotless wooden bench is Sissy, staring at a clock
surgeon emerges
Well, he's not out of danger, but think we can safely say he's going to make it
'd be pretty surprised if he didn't
However, there is evidence of injury to the frontal lobe, and  have reason to fear that this injury may be permanent
The patient may never again function as a normal human being
Brain damage
You mean he's going to be a vegetable
Vegetable
Vegetable
wouldn't say that, no
We won't ascertain the extent of the injury for some days
But there is a genuine possibility of severe and lasting behavioral defects
wouldn't classify it in the vegetable category, however
conservative blue Econoline van out of the throngs of traffic draws itself to Sissy as if on a string
The  stomps on the gas
With a sense of disgust at her own failure Sissy scrutinizes his sweaty brow, his smug hot leer, his starving eyes
Her heart sinks when she sees his gun and his knife
He is also unzipping his pants
'm going to give it to you like you've never had it before
Oh, you didn't know it could be this good
You're gonna like it
You're gonna like it
You're gonna like it so good
You're gonna love it so much you're gonna cry
You're gonna cry
You're gonna cry and cry
Do you like to cry
Do you like it when it hurts a little bit
Whatever happens to you, it'll be worth it
The way 'm gonna give it to you, it'll be worth anything
Everything
Go ahead and cry if you want to
like it when women cry
It means they appreciate me
The van pulls over down a dead end alley between warehouses
Sissy looks into the back at a soiled mattress
The driver is taking his dick out of his pants
But with a swift swoosh, Sissy's left thumb comes down hard on the penis top, making the driver howl
His finger fumbles for the gun trigger, but before he gets to it, Sissy's thumb splats between his eyes
Twice
Three times
He loses control of the van
It lumbers into a street lamp
Sissy leaps from the vehicle and runs
' Sissy goes in and begins to cry at the counter as she looks at her thumbs
Into a sunset hitches Sissy
hops into a semi
: Then , ' An older Dr
Dreyfus answers the door
Without Sissy's asking he speaks
'm afraid  can't help you
But Doctor
Please, child, don't be dismayed
We all have problems these days
But as the painter Van Gogh said, 'Mysteries remain, sorrow or melancholy remains, but the everlasting negative is balanced by the positive work which thus is achieved, after all
'  don't suppose that means very much to you

victim of a malpractice suit
(embracing him) Oh, Doctor
You've got to do it
You and nobody else should be allowed to take away my gift
In her embrace, the Doctor is presented with her thumbs
Ah, the thumb
sitting inside his study, Dreyfus muses
The thumb the thumb the thumb the thumb the thumb the thumb
One of evolution's most ingenious inventions; a built-in tool sensitive to texture, contour and temperature: an alchemical lever; the secret key to technology; the link between the mind and art; a humanizing device
The marmoset and the lemur are thumbless; none of the New World monkeys has opposable thumbs; the spider monkey's thumbs are absent or reduced to a tiny tubercle; the thumbs of the potto are set at an angle of one hundred eighty degrees to the other digits
Pause
And so you are demanding at last the privileges of thumb that nature has perversely denied you
just want to be normal, give me that old-fashioned normality
It was good enough for Crazy Horse and it's good enough for me
Ah, yes
Very well, my dear
Here is what we can do
Sissy admitted to a hospital Blood analyzed in a laboratory
Powerful lamps turn on in an operating room
tubes are inserted in veins
Sissy is wheeled into surgery
An anesthesiologist sticks a needle into a curved and creamy ass
An anesthesiologist sticks needles into a long, graceful neck
nurse scrubs an arm
body and table are draped with sheets to create a sterile field
tourniquet is placed on a slender right arm
An elastic rubber bandage is applied so tightly it squeezes most of the blood out of an arm
tourniquet is inflated
surgeon outlines in iodine an incision around the base of a thumb
Pale smooth skin is incised along a premarked line and dissected down to the bone
Woman flesh is sewn shut with four-ought nylon suture
tourniquet is deflated, a bloody arm bathed
young woman is rolled into a recovery room
nurse and two surgeons, their attention directed by an intensifying pinkish glow, turn to stare into a metal pan, where a huge human thumb, disarticulated from the hand it has been severed from, is now flopping about like a trout, or rather, arching and thrusting itself in a calculated and endlessly repeated gesture, the gesture of the hitchhike
Two representatives of the Fish and Wildlife Service are flying over Siwash Lake in a
Forestry Service Helicopter
the whooping cranes by the side of the lake
And as they are recording this, shots from a band of young women on horseback drive them away
the same two agents are driving in a truck approaching the Rubber Rose Ranch
Two bullet ricochets spin off the hood and roof of their truck and they stop to see a lone teenaged cowgirl with a rifle
An entourage of Forest Service Rangers, a county sheriff, four deputy shriffs, a state game warden and Mottburg's town marshall and several of his deputies, the editor of the Mottburg Gazette and a couple of bird watchers or two are met by
at the gate of the Ranch
Through a bullhorn, Jelly speaks out at the entourage of law enforcement officers
Yep, the whooping cranes are here all right
They're in fine shape, and as you musta saw from your fucking whirly machine, unrestrained, free to go as they please
But this is private property and you aren't laying a foot on it
None of you
We'll be back with a court order and a fistful of search warrants
Just come back with a couple of people who know what they're doing and we'll let'em in for a nice close look at the birds
And make sure at least one of them is female, and you better do as we say or there may be trouble
an announcement is broadcast
, and reading from a paper in his hand
It will be my extreme pleasure to report to the President
Students listening
who has been gravely concerned about the fate of our whooping cranes
Two construction workers high atop the city listening to a small transistor radio and eating lunch
and to the Interior Secretary and to the American people that the entire flock of cranes is, indeed, at
crowd of people listening to a broadcast in front of a bandstand set up in front of the mall
Siwash Lake and in apparently healthy condition
The crowd cheers
The cranes have built brooding nests around the whole circumference of the small lake, and have
Cowgirls are watching a small television
hatched chicks there
Counting the young birds, there are now approximately sixty cranes in the flock
While this is good news, it is also quite bewildering
vehicle know as "the peyote wagon" pulls out of the Rubber Rose
Delores del Ruby is at the wheel
And over her truck radio we hear: (
) Whooping cranes are territorially minded and have never been known to nest as close as a mile to one another, yet here they are virtually side by side
lone  man sees the peyote wagon leaving the ranch through his binoculars
Sissy hears a broadcast over a moving car radio
The Rubber Rose Ranch has issued a communique that was sent to the federal judge and copies of a recording to the press, today
We can hear the voice of Bonanza Jellybean: (over the radio) , -- , , Sissy recognizes the voice
That's Jellybean
(
) , ' , ,   , ,   , Jelly is on the telephone
, ' -- Sissy listens to the radio
' ' , ,
Sissy is hitchhiking with her new thumb
But cars pass one after another without stopping
Until Sissy finally tries her left thumb, which has been spared the knife
With this thumb there are new maneuvers to try out
And as soon as the does, a car stops
of hitchhiking brilliance with Sissy's use of her left thumb
past twelve then on to six and past eight
she dances wildly around traffic, stopping the hardest of drivers,     and within thirty hours she is approaching Mottburg again
The Ranch is now surrounded by two hundred federal marshalls reinforced by a dozen  agents with loaded guns taking position outside the ranch
Sissy gets out of her car and walks past the posse and through the gates
Kym carries a radio which is playing "The Day-Old Apple Strudel Polka" across the corral
She carries the radio as if it is a suitcase full of skunk lice
Man, this is the stupidest music 've ever heard
This radio should have stayed in the privy where it belongs
Kym ropes the radio to her saddle horn and prepares to give it a ride across the Dakota hills
She gets on her horse and rides by the Ranch bungalows and spies Sissy sitting in the outhouse
Howdy
Kym gets off her horse and hugs Sissy
You know what you're getting into if you come over to the lake
Yes, but  want to be there
want to see Jellybean
want to see the cranes
Then they stop at an outlook and Sissy sees the circular barricade in the field below
We heard on the radio that the judge has set Delores's bail at fifty thousand dollars
Now she won't be here when we really need her
few cowgirls in the camp huddle around a radio: The American Civil Liberties Union has requested an extension for the Rubber Rose Ranch
The government is aware of the inflamed situation and are afraid that all the marshals and agents might be too willing to uncork the bottle of blood
on the back of Kym's horse the way that John Wayne would have ridden into the Alamo; Heather, Bonanza Jellybean, Debbie, Elaine and Linda dance up to meet her
Before Sissy is completely on the ground, Jelly's tongue is in her mouth
She stumbles out of a stirrup into a wiggly embrace
Let's celebrate
Debbie stokes up a big joint right now, as Jelly gets out her six guns and fires them in the air
Heather twirls and jumps through her rope
The "Unsung Hero Returns Polka" strikes up on the radio
Elaine rears up on her horse
,    views the little going on
Ain't that just like women
But as the Agent is saying this, viewing them from the ridge, a large rock tumbles down the hill and grazes his head, knocking him out
of the side of the ridge from where the rock came, but there is strangely nothing where we expect to see the Chink
: The cowgirls
Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess
So be it
It looks serious this time, though
All these guns
are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but 'm not in this for whooping cranes
'm in it for cowgirls
If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise
want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl
Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised
How did this business get started, anyhow
Why are the birds nesting here
You were aware that we were feeding them, weren't you
We fed them brown rice and they stayed over a couple of extra days
Then we decided to try something different
We mixed our brown rice with fishmeal -- whoopers love seafood, and fishmeal is cheap
Then Delores suggested another ingredient, and we think that's what did the trick
You mean
They're drugged
Aw, come off it, Sissy
What do you mean, 'drugged'
Every living thing is a chemical composition and anything that is added to it changes that composition
When you eat a cheeseburger or a Three Musketeers bar, it changes your body chemistry
The kind of food you eat, the kind of air you breathe, can change your mental state
Does that mean you're 'drugged'
Sissy frames the flock with the hole in the center of her cheese sandwich
No,  guess not
'Drugged' is a stupid word
But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains
It's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years
The way  see it, is that the peyote mellowed them out
Made them less uptight
They were afraid of bad weather and humans
That's why they migrated and kept to themselves
But the peyote has enlightened them
It's taught them there is nothing to fear but fear itself
Now they're digging life and letting the bad vibes slide on
Don't worry, be happy
Be here now
Fear in wild animals is completely different from paranoia in people
In the wilderness ecosystem, fear is natural and necessary
It's merely a mechanism for maintaining life
If the cranes hadn't had a capacity for fear, they would have disappeared long ago and you'd be having to get loaded with common old everyday meadowlarks and mallards
This here discussion is destined to become academic
Because we've got less than half a bag of peyote buttons left and Delores's run ended up in the Mottburg jail
So any day now we'll get a chance to see how the whoopers behave when they come down, to see if the peyote experience really changed them or not
But in the meantime,  want to say this about fear
Then Sissy and Jelly hear a news broadcast on the radio
Judge Greenfield, at the request of the , has granted a forty-eight- hour extension of the deadline by which the Rubber Rose cowgirls must comply with his order
Negotiations between the cowgirls and the government are expected to follow
Another item in, the forewoman of the Rubber Rose Ranch, a Delores del Ruby is now free on bond after having been arrested in Mottburg with more than fifty pounds of peyote buttons
Her bail has been paid by the owner of the besieged ranch, Countess Products, Inc
Miss del Ruby's bail having come from the tycoon's personal advisor, a certain Dr
Robbins of New York City
Dr
Robbins
Sissy and Jelly lie under the same stars, under the same blankets
Under the same spell
Every time  tell you that  love you, you flinch
But that's your problem
If  flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems
My confusion becomes your confusion
Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts
Delores and some of the other cowgirls are talking
sharp wind is beginning to gust
It isn't for ourselves that we take this stand
It isn't for cowgirls
It's for all the daughters everywhere
This is an extremely important confrontation
This is womankind's chance to prove to her enemy that she's willing to fight and die
If we women don't show here and now that we aren't afraid to fight and die, then our enemy will never take us seriously
Men will always know that, no matter how strong our words and determined our deeds, there's a point where we'll back down and give them their way
Delores cracks her whip then parades around the campfire
'm prepared to win
Victory for every female, living or dead, who's suffered the temporary defeats of masculine insensitivity to their inner lives
few of the cowgirls cheer
'll fight the bastards
Big Red opens a can of beans with a Bowie knife
'll fight 'em with bean gas, if necessary
Delores snaps her whip again
The sun's going down
Let's those of us not standing watch get some sleep
In the morning we'll plan our fight
Tomorrow afternoon those of you who'd like can join me in the reeds, where the cranes and  will be sharing the last crumbs left in the peyote sack
Delores del Ruby appears from the reeds at Siwash Lake's edge, asleep yet awake
She has sunk so deep into the hole in her mind that gale and dust could not follow her
, as they listen
It is woman's mission to destroy as well as to give birth
We will destroy the tyranny of the dull
But we can't destroy it with guns
Or whips
Violence is the dullard's Breakfast of Champions and the logical end product of his or her misplaced pride
Violence fertilizes that which we would starve
No, we will destroy the enemy in other ways
The Peyote Mother has promised a Fourth Vision
But it won't come to me alone
It will come to each of you, to every cowgirl in the land, when you have overcome that in your own self which is dull
The Fourth Vision will come to some men too
You will recognize them when you meet them, and be their steady sidekicks in equal and ecstatic escapades of poetic behavior and romance
Delores holds up a card
The prairie moon illuminates its tattered edges
It is the jack of hearts
The forewoman seems to be tiring
Fumes of weariness stream from her black hair
Her voice is leaning against the wall of her larynx when she says: First thing, you must end this business with the government and the cranes
It's been positive and fruitful, but it's gone far enough
Playfulness ceases to serve a serious purpose when it takes itself too seriously
Sorry  won't be with you at the conclusion
As you know, 've been sick and stupid for a long time
have a lot to make up for, a lot to accomplish, and there's someone important that 've got to see
Now
As graceful as a ballet for cobras, Delores turns and walks away into the night
, other  and  wait in anticipation of an attack outside of the boundaries of the ranch
Jelly is addressing the group of cowgirls
Well, what we got to do is one of us has got to go up that hill and tell them boys that America can have its whooping cranes back
Since 'm the boss here, and since 'm responsible for a lot of you choosing to be cowgirls in the first place, it's gonna be me that goes
Small protests from the circle of cowgirls
No buts about it
It's getting lighter by the second
You podners keep your heads down
Ta ta
The cutest cowgirl in the world stood up and stretched out
Jelly
Please
But Jelly is already on her way
over the carcass of a reducing machine and plants her Tony Lama boots in the stirrup of her saddle and straddles her horse and takes off
The posse surrounding the ranch, can see Jelly coming over the hill on her horse at a full gallop
Jelly stops her horse, looks down at her waist, and sees her sixguns
Better get rid of these
Might give those greenhorn dudes a fright
the scope of an  rifle, Jelly is drawing her gun out of her holster
She's going to fire
He squeezes the trigger, and Jelly is caught in the stomach with a bullet
She falls off her horse to the ground
sees Bonanza Jellybean cut down from a vantage point on the hill, and makes a beeline for the government barricades,
scream and cry, and grab their weapons
couple of them leap from the barricade and are immediately riddled
The six-gun slips from her fingers
Twenty or thirty more sweaty triggers are squeezed on the hilltop firing at Bonanza Jellybean
directed at the cowgirls echoes: You've got two minutes to come out with you hands over your heads
- are sniping at the cowgirls, making it impossible to surrender
stray bullet    back down the hillside, beard, robe and sandals flying
that follows, in the echoes of the explosive fire, the whooping crane flock rises in one grand assault of beating feathers - a lily white storm of life, a gush of albino Gabriels -- swarm into the waiting sky, and circle the pond one time before flapping south toward Texas
they cast shadows over a dead Jellybean who is literally biting the dust
Sissy lifts Jelly out of the dust and holds her
Sissy lifts Jelly's satin shirt tail and pulls down the waistband of her skirt
Bright red blood is running out of her scar
Right in the scar where  fell on a wooden horse when  was twelve
Haw, wasn't really shot with a silver bullet
Confessing to Sissy
Or was
The cranes fly over the Statue of Liberty
The Cranes fly over the Eiffel tower
The Cranes fly over Red Square
An undertaker pounding five nails into a white coffin are engraved two crossed
There are eleven famous cowgirls enameled on the edges and in the middle it reads: 1944-1973 "Ha ha ho ho and hee hee" Title card: The brown paper bag
brown paper bag is sitting on the side of the road
The brown paper bag is the only thing civilized man has produced that does not seem out of place in nature
Crumpled into a wad of wrinkles, like the fossilized brain of a dryad; its kinship to tree (to knot and nest) unobscured by the cruel crush of industry; absorbing the elements like any other organic entity; blending with rock and vegetation as if it were a burrowing owl's door mat or a jack rabbit's underwear, a No
8 Kraft paper bag lay discarded in the hills of Dakota and appeared to live where it lay
Once long ago, it had borne a package of buns and a jar of mustard to a kitchenette rendezvous with a fried hamburger
More recently, the bag had held
love letters
View of a bunkhouse trunk
As a hole in an oak hides a squirrel's family jewels, the bag had hidden love letters in the bottom of a bunkhouse trunk
Hands lift the contents of the trunk away, rope, spurs, and blanket and find the hidden sack of letters
Then one day after work, the button- nosed little cowgirl to whom the letters were addressed gathered bag and contents under her arm, slipped out to the corral
We see the Cowgirl saddling her horse late in the day
past ranch hands pitching horseshoes and ranch hands flying Tibetan kites, saddled up and trotted into the hills
We see the Cowgirl riding along a ridge
mile or so from the bunkhouse, she dismounted and built a small fire; she fed the fire letters
And this we see also, the lonely Cowgirl feeding the letters to a fire in the dusky early night
We can see the cowgirl is Sissy Hankshaw
one by one, the way her girl friend had once fed her french fries
She is crying now and feeding the fire, close of words like "always" and "forever" burning up
As words such as sweetheart" and "honey britches" and "forever" and "always" burned away, the cowgirl squirted a few tears
Her eyes were so misty she forgot to burn the bag
Sissy is sobbing
Big Red offers a piece of homemade fudge and shows no surprise when Sissy refuses it
Kym kisses the lips quickly of the despondent Cowgirl, and the bunkhouse lights go out
Delores plunks a carefree song on an old Gibson, looks up at the moon
You know, podner, you can tune a guitar but you can't tuna fish
She plunks a few notes
God, but it's good to be a cowgirl
And the bunkhouse lights are turned off
There are some giggles from the cowgirls
wakes up and is being cared for by Sissy
He is in pain, but winking
Is everything getting worse
Yes, everything is getting worse
But everything is also getting better
The Countess has come to our aid
The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls
And have been asked to oversee the ranch
For $300 a week
And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was
here's a picture
Sissy shows a picture of the Countess recovering in a hospital bed, posing next to Doctor Robbins
want to go back to the Clock People
kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to
What's happened to Jelly
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City
You mean she's dead
The Chink mourns a bit
But that's an old story now can't believe that you would leave the Butte
Easy come, easy go
Wow, you sure have a way with words
The Chink looks over and sees that Delores is standing in the doorway
can't help it if  grew up in an antipoetic culture
Language will be different when 'm with the Clock People though
They're from an oral tradition
And 'm not talking about what you horny hop toads do in bed every night
The Chink smiles
Delores blushes
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard
The world isn't going to end, you dummy;  hope you know that much
(he grows uncharacteristically serious) But it is going to change
It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime
The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue
But there are far worse catastrophes coming
unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption
It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault
So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss
Little pockets of humanity
Like the Clock People
Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave
There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave
He begins to caress Sissy's belly
His eyes are smiling
Sissy is surprised
Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics
All in Siwash Cave
In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe
tribe every member of which had giant thumbs
tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways
It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools
It would have to rely on its wits and its senses
It would have to live with animals -- and plants
-- as virtual equals
It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve
How am  going to be the progenitor of a tribe when 'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores
That's your problem
The Chink coughs
Listen to the way 'm babbling
That bullet must have loosened one of my transistors
Don't pay any attention to me
You've got to work it out for yourself
The westbound choo-choo leaves Mottburg at one-forty
want to be on it
Will you drive me to the station
Sissy and Delores are driving the Chink out the front gate of the Rubber Rose
Schedules
Ironic how  have to follow timetables in order to get back to the clockworks
He yells out the window of the moving vehicle
Don't ever bet against paradox, ladies
We hear the Chink yelling, and the Rubber Rose sign is being changed to one that reads El Rancho Jellybean
if complexity doesn't beat you, then paradox will
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee
And the truck disappears into the prairie land
,  finally we are inside the cave where the Chink's Clockworks are at work
poing
It is revealed that Sissy is with Delores snug in the old hermit's living quarters
She listens to the clinking of the Chink's Clockworks
And feels her belly
The swell of her belly has forced her to sleep on her back
of Sissy's belly, and a little foot kicks from inside
Or is it a foot
of Sissy's unborn baby
It is half- Japanese, one thirty-second Siwash and all thumbs
The moving thumbs are hitchhiking you
