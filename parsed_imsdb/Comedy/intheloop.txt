Morning
He hands her the  and she puts it into a  player

what Shall we start with today
Wonky Ron
or Simon Foster, on the  programme for the
Malcolm starts listening to the recording of Simon on the radio
( ) Well, 'm joined by Simon Foster, the Minister for International development
Thank you for joining us
Here we go
You've been in the job now for eighteen months, do you think you're making headway
(v/o on radio) Ah
Yes  do
You'd expect me to say that suppose

3 Judy Malloy, the Department's Press Officer, is preparing for her minister's arrival
Mark, are you co-ordinating that millenium goals press release
Yes
Well co-ordinate it better
Yes, can do
Is that the Minister
Bloody nail - has anyone got a nail file

4 is arriving with
Simon carrying his red dispatch box
Simon's worried
Have we heard anything from Malcolm about last night's interview
No not yet
Perhaps he didn't hear it
Or maybe he's dead
(with a degree of genuine hope) He might be dead
He might have had that massive stroke we've all been waiting for
It's in the post

and Of course the big one is diarrhoea, which is a major, major issue
Page 2 5     :                                                      5 Diarrhoea
mean, this is the minister for International Development
He should be talking about food parcels, not fucking arse-spraying mayhem
laughs
( ) And so if we can tackle the easy things, like diarrhoea, then we can
Oh yes, say it again
Very good
What is this, The Shitting Forecast
( ) and then hopefully that will strike another blow in the war against preventable diseases
You mentioned the word `war" is paying extremely close attention now
Steady Eddie
( ) Against preventable diseases, yes
( ) Yes
All the evidence now points to a military intervention in the Middle East
Is that you view
( ) Well
personally,  think that war is unforseeable
Sam
Sam
( ) Unforseeable
( ) Yes
Sam
'm going to have to go over to International Development, and pull Simon Foster's fucking hair

6 emerges into the street
On the phone
He did not say "unforseeable'
You may have heard him say it, but he did not say that, and that is a fact
7
7 He'll want you to row back from the `unforeseeable' thing on Question Time tonight
On Question Time, you know the funny question they always ask at the end
Yes
think we should prep that now
'd like to shine on the funny question, cos 'm a funny guy
With a light touch
deposits his briafcase
Judy finds some clippings, returns
There's this guy, he's a property tycoon
He's bought a South Sea Island
It might be something like that, you know
"If you had to spend the rest of your life on a desert island, who would it be with
" Ah
Well,  can't say my wife, because haven't got one, and  can't say my girlfriend, because  haven't got one of those either
And don't say Mandela, that's
No
Boring
And a bloke
Or Keira Knightley
Well, that's a good idea

People don't want to know

8 Toby and Suzy walking to work together
Did you take the washing out of the machine
No
What do you mean, no
No
didn't take the washing out of the machine
It's going to go really stale
It'll be fine
It's not fine
By the time
It is fine
'll wear stale pants
don't want to go out with some who wears stale pants
Well, there we go
could go commando, but  don't think that's acceptable in government
(Disgusted) Please
So: got everything you need for your first day in International Development
Page 5 8     :                                                     8 Oh Yes
It's all here
My massive intellect
And an apple for Simon Foster
Simon Fluster
Don't say that, 'm rebranding him
Well he was crap on the radio last night
He sounded like a chicken with a wasp up its arse
Well 'm going to sort that out
After a week 'll have him sounding like a chicken without a wasp up its arse
Have a good day, good luck honey
Have a good day at the Foreign Office
Try not to annoy Russia
'll give you a call later
Keep your phone on
Bye
Yeah, alright
Oh and be careful - cars
They walk off in separate directions
9   /
'   -                         9 Toby is walking towards
As he nears the building he finds himself next to Malcolm, who is heading in too
Toby is on the phone
: Are you going to keep ringing me up every two minutes, because you're starting to remind me of my mum
And that could lead to all sorts of erectile dysfunction
Suzy is still in the  office
Page 6 9     :                                                     9 'm just checking whether you put last night's lasagne in the fridge
In the  office,  arrives
He has a small suitcase and a paper bag
He holds this up
(mouthing) Croissants
Back with Malcolm, Toby close by
Malc's on the phone
No
You're fine to go ahead and print that
It's lies, you'd be lying, but go ahead
He did not say unforeseeable
No he did not
Oh, just before you go -- when  tell your wife about you and Angela Heaney at the Blackpool conference
would email be better
Or a phone call
Or, hey  know, 'll write it on a cake, "Your hack husband betrayed you on the 4th of October, and congratulations on the new baby" in those little silver balls
() Yeah, maybe best to spike it
Okay
Fuckity-bye
Toby is now next to Malcolm in the building (or better still, in a lift)
Malcolm becomes aware of him
No, it's fine, it's in the fridge
put some clingfilm over it
In the  office, Michael switches on some classical music
Why did you put clingfilm on it
To keep it fresh
Malcolm starts dialling on his phone
It's in the fridge, that'll keep it fresh
No, but it still might dry out
(into phone) Yeah, Malcolm Tucker
Can  speak to James Lewis at the  Programme please
Page 7 9      : (2)                                            9 Michael hands Suzie a croissant
(knowing Toby is on the other end of the line) Still slightly warm
That's how  like my women as well
Clingfilm is carcinogenic, Toby
No it isn't
That's a myth
Clingfilm is perfectly safe
Malcolm now eyeing Toby with suspicion/contempt -- who is this dick
Toby tries to smile, lowers his voice, embarrassed
(into phone) No, 'll hold,
what's he waiting for sex-change
They wouldn't sell clingfilm if it gave you cancer
Clingfilm doesn't give you cancer
And Lasagne doesn't give you syphillis
James
Right --Simon Foster
Yeah, very funny, the Diarrhoea of a Nobody
Listen, we get an easy ride on Tom tomorrow,
(getting annoyed) No,  relax
Tell you what, 'll come over a lock you in a flotation tank and pump it full of sewage until you drown

10 Simon and Judy are still prepping the funny question
Paris Hilton
Are you serious
Lily Allen
No
No women
Page 8 10     :                                                     10 The Olson twins
Judy gets a call
Hi
Right
see
She rings off
(sensing something's up) What
Malcolm's coming to see you
Shit
He's still alive
When's he due
Malcolm walks in with Toby sheepishly behind him
Now
And don't say you weren't prepared because  rang ahead
(To ) Give us a minute, will you love
Judy gets up as Malcolm turns back to (') In the words of the late, great Nat King Fucking Cole, `Unforeseeable, that's what you are
' 11
11 has spotted
So you're
whatever your name is, Dan, the new advisor
Daniel
Toby
Right
Just most of you lot tend to be called Dan, or Danny, so it's always worth a punt
, hello
As you know, 'm Judy Molloy, Civil Service Director of Communications for International Development
They shake hands
Page 9 11     :                                                   11 Is this a normal morning, or
Judy's not got time for questions
Okay, 've got a meeting in (looks at watch) two minutes
And the minister was rubbish in last night's interview
Rubbish
It's a technical term
It means he went on the radio and everyone could hear that he was rubbish
Someone goes into Simon's office
As door opens we hear heated conversation between Simon and Malcolm
[ ] You sounded like a panicky chimp trapped in a washing machine
12
'
12 Back inside Simon's office
Come on, Malcolm, he asked me for a personal opinion
Oh why didn't you say
mean, he asked you
Fuck
Of course, that explains it
Yeah
Say, if he'd asked you to fucking black up, or give him your  number, or shot yourself, would you have done that as well
would have blacked up
It was the radio and no-one would have known
Yeah
Very good
But war is -- basically unforeseeable isn't it
That is not our line, alright
Walk the fucking line
Look
( ) Page 10 12     :                                                     12 (') We've got Karen Clark over from Washington, okay
We've got the National Security Advisor's main guy coming
Yeah
We've got enough Pentagon goons here for a fucking coup d'etat
This is not the time to send out a signal like this in some personal fucking sodcast
and  come in
Minister, this is Toby
Not the time love
Fuck off
smiles at , and doesn't fuck off
Hey Toby
Glad you could join us
Bit of an odd morning, but 'Welcome to the madhouse
' apologise for Malcolm
Don't apologise for me
You should apologise for yourself
(to Judy) Did  not just tell you to fuck off and yet you're still here
That's correct
(to Toby) Hey, foetus boy
Lesson One: If  tell you to fuck off what do you do
Fuck off
You'll go far
Now fuck off
Right
Toby fucks off
We can see him outside, wandering around, not knowing what to do with himself
We were thinking, weren't we Judy, that could row back on Question Time tonight
No, You're not going on Question Time tonight
You've been disinvited
Page 11 12     : (2)                                          12 Why
We've been prepping Question Time
Because they ask fucking questions on Question Time
And you're no good at questions
If it was Fumbling, Off- Message Shit Fucking Answer Time, you'd be our main guy
But it's not
Sorry, why wasn't  told about this
Why should  tell you about this
Because it's a scheduled media appearance by this department's Secretary Of State and it therefore falls within my purview
Your purview
Where do you think you are sweetheart, in some Regency costume drama
This is a government department, not a fucking Jane Austen novel
Allow me to pop a jaunty little bonnet on your purview and ram it up the shitter with a lubricated horse cock
Malcolm, your swearing doesn't impress me
My husband works for Tower Hamlets and believe me, those kids make you sound like Angela Lansbury
(to Simon, lads' chat) She's married
The poor bastard
But
okay, Judy's lubricated horse cock aside for one moment
(Judy walks out) Are you saying that 'm now not allowed to make any media appearances
No, not until we can trust you to keep to the line
But  was going to keep to the line: " don't actually think war is unforeseeable
" Page 12 12     : (3)                                          12 Malcolm's looking out of the office, monitoring Judy's movements
She's flashed up on his radar
He's tracking her
What is it then
beat
Is it
don't know
Foreseeable
No
No
Not foreseeable
That's fucking declaring war
Do you want to fucking declare war
'm a cabinet minister
didn't get here by screwing up every media appearance ever had
Write this down
It's neither forseeable nor undorseeable
Right
So not inevitable, but not
evitable
Malcolm leaves the office
Toby is still hovering
(calling back to Simon) Okay, you need to work on this fucking line
(to Judy) That includes you, Jane Fucking Austen with the strap-on
Oh, and put the sniff out there that the next time the ambushes a Minister with a war question we'll drop a bomb on them
can't do that
That's political, that's not in my
Purview, Marie Antoinette
Weel listen, darling, why don't you fucking scuttle off back to fucking Cranford and play around with your tea and cake and horse cocks
Let them eat cock
( ) You, Ron Weasley -- you do it
Malcolm heads out

-                               13 Suzy and Michael in Michael's office
Suzy's getting documents together for the big meeting
Michael's at his computer, on the phone
Classical music still on
(on phone) You needn't worry about the Canadians
They're just happy to be there
(Pause) Yes, well, they always look surprised when they're invited
Listen, shall  just give Toby a quick call about the Simon Foster thing
Suzy dials
14
/                   14 Toby checks the phone
Sees it's Suzy -- Christ, not her again, 'm a bit busy here
He answers
: Hiya
You do know this is the third time you've rung
Are you on a new tariff
So
How's it going
You found the bogs yet
All a bit manic
It was never like this at Agriculture
People tend not to swear so much about wheat
Apart from farmers
They swear about everything
(to Michael, re
the music) Can you turn that down a bit
(to Toby) Look, 've got a leg up for you
think we could get Simon into the big meeting with Karen Clark
Right - Karen Clark from
is that the woman who went round Britain in a coracle for leukemia
Page 14 14     :                                                   14 Karen Clark,  Assistant Secretary of State
Oh right
Shit
Karen Clark
Wow
Thanks
Hang on, Michael wants to say something
Meat
Meat
Meat
Simon's only going to be meat in the room
Don't get his hopes up
Yeah, so you know -- Simon, between us, he's just going to be meat in the room
Meat
Judy, nearby, hears this
(waving him away) Yeah
The Americans don't feel they're getting a real meeting unless there's thirty of you on each side
So Simon is
you know those polystyrene peanut things they use to pack electrical goods
Sort of one of those
But you might not want to tell him that
ought to go love you
Judy's hovering nearby
Likewise
Affirmative on that
15
-  /
'  -                     15 Judy is hovering as Toby finishes his call
So, quick tour
She starts walking away
Toby follows
Um,  do just need to
Page 15 15     :                                                   15 Over there
that's Mike's patch
Leave Mike to it
He knows what he's doing
Don't you Mike
What
Exactly
(as they walk on) He's an idiot
He organised 3,000 tents and sanitation packs for Rwanda
Right
is that not
They needed them in Luanda
Angola
It's been in the news
(checks phone) And that's the end of the tour
've got to go
Look,  understand your hostility to new wood coming in
There's a lot of really important people you need to know about, but  haven't got time
But she's gone
Toby heads over to Simon's office
The door's open
He pops his head in
Hey, boss
Toby, hi
Sorry about earlier -- Malcolm
He's a bit of an
alpha male, isn't he
Look, 've managed to get you into the big meeting at the Foreign Office this afternoon
The Karen Clark meeting
Shit, really
Sure
How did you
did it through sheer bloody hard work
Judy walks past
Simon calls out
Page 16 15     : (2)                                          15 Hey Judy
She comes in
Hello
Tobes here has got me into the big Karen Clark meeting
Judy looks at Toby
She heard the `meat' conversation
Wow
Yeah, the Big Meet
How are you spelling that, by the way
Two `e's
16
16 Simon, Toby and Judy drive along Whitehall in their car
An awkward silence
Judy looks at Toby
She knows Simon's just off to be meat
(off Judy's look) Just, maybe, might be best not to get too excited
It might be that their guys muscle in and have the lion's share of the talk time
Yeah
It might be like that
think  can work a room, okay
'm not a room virgin
17
-                    17 Simon, Toby and Judy are going through security
Suzy and Michael come to meet them
Simon
Michael
Page 17 17     :                                                   17 very young man approaches Michael
Looks like he is 19
He is
Ah, Michael
'm Chad
Hello
We'd like a dual horse-shoe formation for the meeting set-up - an enclave for Ms Clark, an enclave for the Pentagon delegation
First names acceptable to all parties and politely we request the presence of both carbonated and non- carbonated waters
Right
Thanks so much
He walks purposefully off
My God
Who was that, Young Lankenstein
Oh he'll be running something relatively major
They're all kids in Washington
It's like Bugsy Malone, but with real guns
18
-               18 Chad's dual horse-shoe is packed with people
The room's pretty much full
from the State Department is surrounded by ten or so aides and functionaries, security people and assistants
(Including Chad and  one of Karen's senior aides
) Then there is Bob Adriano's gang of advisors, smaller but sitting separately
Next to them is a Pentagon delegation, including uniformed members of all three services
Lots of hubbub
leads ,  and  in, and shows them to their seats
Page 18 18     :                                                   18 They're as far away from the  delegation as it's possible to be, and Simon's seat is actually behind a pillar
Suzy goes off to join Michael and the Foreign Office delegation near the front
Suzy looks over to Toby, uses her hands to make mock binoculars, as if to say, 'you're very far away, look how close and therefore important  am'
No-one will hear me if  say anything
How's your view
Can we swap
Simon and Toby swap seats, but Simon can still barely see anything
(') (to Judy) Can  swap with you
think the meeting's starting
It is
Well, quickly then, swap
Simon and Judy swap seats
The meeting is now underway
We're with Karen Clark
We all agree this is a very tough time, but  don't want a consensus to form around the premise that conflict is necessarily the primary option at this point
Back with Simon, Judy and Toby
Simon still straining to see
Are people thinking that
That's -- a bit hardcore
He cranes again to see
(') No, this is worse
Swap back
Simon and Judy swap seats again
Back with Karen
She's holding up a paper in a red folder
Page 19 18     : (2)                                          18 This paper, authored by one of my aides, Liza Weld
You don't mind me fore- grounding this do you Liza
Liza reacts
Her paper
In a big meeting
Is this good or bad
(') Illuminates the logistical factors we face
She highlights a number of reasons why, in practical terms, we can't envision a theatre deployment for twelve months
Although not everyone might agree with the assumptions made in that paper
Really - such as what
The committee feels a much quicker deployment is possible
Which committee
(covering) This has been discussed in a number of committees
If  said one committee
You did
Then that was a slip of the tongue Have you accidentally alluded to some secret committee
war committee
If  can interject here, 'm aware we're pushed for time
'd like to move us on agenda-wise
Our next item is international relief co-ordination
Karen is conferring with Liza, Adriano with his guy
Have you heard of this committee
What's this Liza Weld paper
Page 20 18     : (3)                                          18 Simon is watching, feeling the meeting is passing him by
(to Judy and Toby) Should  say something
She invited me, should say something
If you don't say something in the first 10 minutes, you can end up not saying anything at all
don't know whether you should say anything
'm saying something
think 'm going to try saying something
Simon goes to put his hand up, Toby maybe puts a calming hand on his hand
They look at one another
Has Toby crossed a line
Look -  just think it's worth noting that Ministers in The  Government, (Liza whispers - Simon's over there) such as our colleague here
(pleased) Is she talking about me
Simon Foster
She's talking about me
Has made it clear that for them currently war is unforeseeable
Isn't that right Simon
Well, yes,  mean, that's what  said
And  stick to what  said
sits down
Them stands back up
(') But that doesn't mean that what  said won't ever change
It's not imutable
Or mutable
It's an ongoing
Page 21 18     : (4)                                          18 (cutting in) wonder if there aren't some area of mutual agreement we can't rattle through here and see how much time we have at the end for this discussion
He's ended the debate
Suzy comes round the back of the meeting all smiles and hands Judy a note with a smile
Thanks
She opens the note it reads, `Simon is acting like a massive tit
Stop him
' Is that all fine
That's all fine
Thanks for that
Thanks
Toby whispers something in Simon's ear
Simon doesn't look pleased
Karen is still talking to the meeting
Simon shuts up
He'll have this out later
19
-                         19 The big meeting is breaking up
Simon is annoyed, leading Judy and Toby out of the room and into any private space he can find - they back into a huge huge ballroom Come here - we need to talk (they go into the massive room, look around) What do you mean stop being a `tit'
In what way was  being a tit
Why am  even over here if 'm not meant to say anything
You were just meat in the room, Simon
'Meat in the room'
Oh for fuck's sake Judy
took an hour out to come over here and be room meat
Page 22 19     :                                                     19 But you know you're a prime cut, you're not - offal
Great, 'm not liver
What was , tit meat
20
-                                   20 We're with Karen Clark's delegation who have just walked downstairs from the meeting room into a ground floor lobby area
is talking to , her right-hand woman
,  and  are above them standing round a circular viewing area that looks down on the lobby
The  and  delegations are aware of each other, throwing furtive glances each other's way
Whichever committee they don't want me to be a member of,  want to be a member of that
It's a confused Groucho Marx
Okay
Right
Chad arrives
Karen talks to someone else
Hey Liza
Your paper got a major citation
You must be psyched Karen brought it up
She
that was her call
didn't know it had been that widely read
You could not write anything that clashes more violently with the current climate than you the one you wrote if you were trying, and it almost seems like you were trying
wasn't trying, believe me
You are like the woman from The Omen, you've given birth to a demon and it's going to kill you
Page 23 20     :                                                      20 You probably identify with the kid from The Omen right
Ooh
See, you're an only child, aren't you
You bring this up whenever you run out of arguments
don't see how my parents' limited reproductive abilities reflects badly on me
'm the sperm that made it
Liza walks off, over to Karen
(') Have fun with your career kryptonite
21
-                                    21 (re : Karen talking conspiratorially to Liza downstairs) What's that all about
It looks important
22
-                                    22 Karen is back, huddled up with Liza
My teeth hurt
think the veneers are chipped
Do they look chipped
Liza stares into Karen's mouth
Well,  think that one, that one's always been there, right
'm not sure
Have you got any painkillers
Oh, don't look at my teeth
23
-                       23 (trying to earwig) Sshhh
Page 24 24
-                              24 (looking up at the Brits, off Simon's smile) don't want to risk a dentist here
25
-                 25 The  delegation are heading off (shouting) Hey Liza
Oh
Hi
hi
She knows him but can't immediately place him
Toby
It's Toby
Hi
Hi
She makes the phone sign
He gives a thumbs up, she thinks he's misread the phone sign and gestures, or email by doing typing in the air
Toby signs back, yeah, call on the phone or email - does the typing back
(re the typing gesture) What are you doing
You look like    you're practicing baby massage
She did the Kennedy scholarship at my college
had a small thing for her
can imagine
'm not sure she remembered me
No, that is one of the side effects of Rohypnol
Page 25 26
26 Linton has set up a secret war committee, just know it
mean, Linton is an absolute lunatic, Liza
He is dangerous
The voices in his head are now singing barbershop together
27
-                                  27 The conversation is continuing between Simon Judy and Toby as they exit the
Yeah
Jesus
really really hope there's not a war
It's going to be a nightmare
It's bad enough having to cope with the fucking Olympics
They appear outside
There's a press pack of 10 or so reporters and photographers there
Minister
/Simon
/Mr Foster
Simon is taken aback
Fuck
Who let the dogs out
We don't need this
Er, you wanted a chance to row back on the war
Do you want to nail the line
What
No
No
'll freestyle it
The press are calling
1 Is war unforeseeable Minister
Look, (grappling now) loads of things that are actually very likely are also unforeseeable
'know, For the plane in the fog the mountain is unforeseeable, but then it, is suddenly very real and inevitable
Toby and Judy look at one another
This isn't good
Page 26 27     :                                                   27 The press pack are looking for more
Sorry, are you saying that
What 'm saying is that to - walk the road of peace, sometimes you need to be ready to climb the mountain of conflict
Thank you
The press are writing furiously, making calls already
Simon tries to look confident
He and the team get into their car
28
28 (   -
29G) Toby Simon and Judy on the back seat as they drive back to the Department
(under his breath) Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck
(to Judy) Why didn't we nail the line
did try to warn you
You did try to warn me but you didn't actually stop me, did you
That's like shouting 'Train
' as  get hit by a train
You should go (stupid voice) 'Look
Train
There's a Fucking Train
' ' and ' phones start ringing
They each check the number
(') Oh shit
It's Malcolm
It's Malcolm for me too
How does he do that
(he answers, tentatively) Hello
Page 27 29
10
29 Malcolm has two phones on the go
He's watching the coverage of Simon's mini-press coverage
It has a `Government ready to Climb the Mountain of Conflict' banner running across the top
(on the phone, over ) Simon
don't like finding out about people  work with via the news, unless they've died
Get over here now so we can address at least one of those issues
30
-                                        30 Judy, Simon and Toby are walking towards Malcolm's office
The thing is
On the war
With your profile
(uncertain, but fuck it, he is a senior policy aide to a cabinet minister) Maybe we should - get it out there
That the war is a resigning issue for you
You can't say it's a resigning issue
Because you then have to resign
You are having a really great first day you know that
They walk in, Malcolm's there
(shouting) You are supposed to be a Cabinet Minster
You are supposed to be officer class
Don't do this
Don't make waves
We can do without the ritual humiliation, Malcolm
You know 'm against talking up the war
You're against talking up the war
Is that why you said, "Climb the mountain of conflict"
( ) Page 28 30     :                                                     30 (') Do you know what you sounded like
You sounded like a fucking Nazi Julie Andrews
'm just saying
might be forced to the verge of making a stand
(different tack needed) (at Toby and Judy) Right, you two, The White Stripes, outside
Simon makes to leave with them
(') There's only two people in the White Stripes
Toby and Judy leave and wait outside the door
(',  ) (') Look,  admire you,  really do
Making a stand
So,  take it  can tell the you don't want to go to Washington
To where
Washington
The boss wants you over there on a fact-finder
Problems we might face if it all goes boombastic in the Middle East
Oh
Right
But you were saying, you are on the verge of your stand
Well, look -  don't know what words used in the heat of the moment, but maybe in a sense  was on the verge
But that's the important thing -  was on the verge
Not in any way decided
Christ on a bendy-bus, Simon, stop being such a faffing fuck-arse
am standing my ground on the verge
Page 29 30     : (2)                                          30 Well, when you go to America, talk to Karen Clarke at the State Department, 'll give it a whirl
But keep away from Linton Barwick
He's pushing the war for Caulderwood's lot
'll deal with him
Dangerous fucker
keeps a live hand-grenade as a paperweight
True story
Oh right
won't talk to him
Talk to as few people as possible
That would be best for you
31
-                                  31 Liza, Karen and Chad arrive in the buzzing State Department offices, knackered but in action mode
Okay - so, priorities are: take a shower, get me on Linton's War Committee, get me a dental appointment
Not necessarily in that order
Karen walks past various desks covered in tons of Post- Its
Stops a  as he passes
(cont'd) (') What's Linton been up to while we've been away
have we declared war on California yet
But before the staffer can answer they run right into Linton
Karen stands her ground
Ah
Karen
Linton
How was London
Good hotel
Great hotel, thank you
Page 30 31     :                                                      31 Good meetings
Yes
We had some good discussions
The time at Number Ten could possibly have been better spent but then
Karen realises that Linton is reading a message on his cell phone and not listening
Good
Welcome back
'll read your words when they come through
Thank you so much Linton heads off to his office
beat later so does Karen
Chad goes off a little towards Linton's office
Is Chad coming
(watching) He's doing his desperate chorus girl thing, hanging around trying to catch Linton's eye
That's why he's wearing his push-up bra today
(as he passes) Assistant Secretary of State -- hi
Brad
Chad Uh-huh
Exactly Can
Linton ignores him as he goes to join Bob Adriano waiting for him in his office
So listen, Liza,  need you to find out the names of the ten dullest committees currently operating on the hill
Dullest
Page 31 31     : (2)                                          31 Because Linton is not going to call it the big horrible scarey war committee
they'll have buried the war committee under the most boring name they can think of
'Diverse Strategy Committee'- not that, 'm on that
But it'll be a committee that sounds so tedious you want to self-harm
They glance over into Linton's area
He is glancing into theirs
(') Can you get me General Miller at the Pentagon
(as she leaves) My teeth hurt like hell
(to herself) Sick of hearing about the teeth
Liza goes to her desk, picks up her landline
(cont'd) (') Hi
'm calling from Karen Clark's office about a paper written by a staffer here
We need to know if 'Post War Planning: Parameters, Implication's and Possibilities' has reached Assistant Secretary of State Linton Barwick yet
(listens) Yeah
by Liza Weld
(listens, shit
) 'Pwip Pip'
It's already been given an acronym
(listens) No  don't want to fast-track it
Would it possible to slow-track it
Well can we create one
32
'  -                 32 Looking over at Karen
Now alone, who is still stealing glances over
do not understand why anyone would choose to work in a glass office
In my opinion glass offices are for perverts
could request the glass be frosted
Page 32 32     :                                                     32 (as if Bob Adriano brought it up) Frosting is for cakes, Bob
Now
What happened in London
Generally positive
Two glitches
Karen flagged a report by one of her staffers - Liza
She's obviously trying to use it as some kind of roadblock
It's called Pwip Pip
Pip what
Pwip Pip
What is that a report on - birdcalls
What does that stand for
don't recall
It's factish
Intel - case for and against intervention
We've got all the facts we need on this
In the land of truth, my friend, the man with one fact is king
You said there was another thing
In the meeting with the Foreign Office the Committee was accidentally briefly alluded to
(putting his hand over his mouth so he can't be lip- read) Which committee
(doing the same) The war committee
Karen must not find out about that
She is an excitable yapping she-dog
Okay get the minutes of the meeting, we need to correct the record
We can do that
Page 33 32     : (2)                                          32 Yes we can
They're an aide memoir for us
So they should not be a reductive record of what happened to be said, but a more full record of what was intended to be said
think that's the more accurate version, right
Bob Adriano is going through the minutes with Linton
(') don't like this section
Cut that don't think this is really what France are saying
Let's change that
And these
And let's reverse this
That's something Karen said
It's not right
Change it
Yes sir
And  like this
Thank you
Let's say everyone agreed with this
Excellent
33
' /  -                          33 Judy's in her office on the phone, laughing
Simon's eyeing her suspiciously
What's she so fucking happy about
Is she laughing at me
Judy closes the blinds on her side of the office
(') (cont'd) Why's she got control of the blinds
'm a government minister
should have blinds
Page 34 33     :                                                     33 (joking) You want me to order some blinds
Or could get some heavy curtains with swags and a pelmet
Yes
do
Oh
Okay
Can we go somewhere else
They walk to Box Room
(') So listen
My team for the
Team Simon
'm thinking of taking you and leaving Judy
could work with that, definitely
Plus she can be a bit
you know
"Everything's a bit shit isn't it
" "So you're the President
And 'm supposed to be impressed by that
Yeah
"My husband works in Tower Hamlets
" "That's much harder than being President"
Okay
It's settled
Fuck it
She's staying behind
Go and tell her
'  - 34                                                                    34 Karen, Liza and Linton are among those seated round the table
Various staffers are standing, including Chad
And Bob Adriano
Which brings us on to Any Other Business
believe 've flagged everything needed to discuss
As  usually do
Page 35 34     :                                                    34 (putting her hand over her mouth, mocking Linton's gesture from earlier) Or everything you're prepared to discuss
What is that, Karen understand you've started up a new committee, what's it called
What makes you think that
It was mentioned in our London meeting
You must have misheard
misheard the word committee
Maybe it was another word
Like Khomeini
You're sitting on a new Khomeini
Possibly
There are a lot of words, Karen
Kansas City
Kitty
Itty
Itty is not a word, Bob
Commissary
Thank you, James Chad
Ok
Why don't you just recap for me all the committees that you're currently sitting on
Page 36 34     : (2)                                          34 'm Sorry, Karen, you appear to be bleeding from your mouth
She is
But she doesn't want to leave the meeting
Oh don't try to change the subject Linton
(Looking at Karen) Oh no
Holy Mother of
Everyone is just looking at her
don't mean to be rude Karen but that is a tad
repulsive
can't concentrate on what you're saying
You have blood coming out of your teeth and that's not right
Karen gets up to go
It's awkward, she's boxed in and has to clamber over the others to get to the door
Okay, Liza come with me
(aside, to Liza) Go, Buffy - you belong to the vampire queen now
Liza follows Karen out
Chad takes Liza's seat
don't like to see a woman bleeding from the mouth
It makes me think of Country and Western music
Which  really can't abide
(what
) Yes
Ha ha
Exactly
Linton sees his chance to take advantage of Karen being out of the room
Actually while we're on Any Other Business  do have a few points 'd like to resolve
Page 37 35
- / -               35 They head into the bathroom
Liza is pulling handfuls of tissue
Handing them to Karen who is dabbing her teeth
Where are at you at with the committees
got it down to two
The Aims and Policy Alignment Committee
Here - put some down your front - you don't want it to go down your
And the Future Planning Committee
Well, it's not the first one
set that one up
Does that really sound dull to you
thought that was a good name
Right, no, it is a good name
Okay, find out if it is definitely the Future Planning Committee
Okay
Okay
Right, listen,  might go and do that
You're not going to shout at me if  go and do that are you
'm not a fucking monster Liza, okay
Will you stop implying 'm some kind of monster
36
-                                   36 Liza heads out of the toilets to see Bob Adriano ahead, quite a long way
Bob
Bob Adriano stops and turns
Liza
Liza sprints and catches up with him
Page 38 36     :                                                     36 So listen, Bob, there's something really want to tell you
We're having a hunk of the month competition, and  just didn't want you to be feel
objectified in any way
and (hopes it might be a come- on
) Oh really
Karen knows about the Future Planning Committee
Bob Adriano looks shocked, tries to cover it up
have no idea what you're talking about
Liza smiles
Runs back into the toilets and gives a thumbs up to Karen

-                                     37 Simon and Toby walking past the queues at  immigration, they are being ushered through a separate channel by airport workers and diplomatic staff
As they're escorted Simon and Toby catch each other's eye
This is cool
Don't be callow Toby
We're on official business
Homeland Security official ushers them through

-                                 38 But then they reach the end of security and find themselves dumped into the same arrivals area as everyone else
They walk through
There will be a car won't there
Oh God yeah, of course
Page 39 38     :                                                   38 They walk slowly looking at the various cabbies and chauffeurs holding signs
Did you book a car
Me
No
mean, Judy will have got someone to do it
He calls on his phone
(') Hi Judy
Yeah sorry if you're in bed, but we're here and
(looks through papers) Just can't see the car
Wondered what the car situation was
39
' /
39 Intercut with Judy in bed at her flat
What car situation
The airport car
That's not my job Toby
That's Robbie's job to book it, your job to check it and confirm it
Alright
Good night
The call is over
40
40 (to Simon) Yeah
She's really embarrassed
Sounds like a snarl up her end
'll see what we can do
He's looking panicked - then

Their car is accompanied by two police motorcycles
(re : the limo) almost feel like there should be hookers
Do you know what  mean
Really, here, we should have hookers
(thumbs up, on his mobile) Hey Gav, 'm in a fucking motorcade
You want girls
(terrified of things getting out of hand) What
Oh no
God no
No no no no no was just -  was just joking
don't want hookers
hate hookers
mean not in an aggressive way
'm just not interested
(uncomfy beat, then) But thanks
Thanks very much
42
-                                      42 They get out of the limo, take in the hotel facade
Not bad
Pretty fucking good

-                                      43 They walk in
Oh
Right
Not so impressive then
Not crappy
Just very bland and ordinary
It's like a hangar for businessmen

He hangs around for a tip

Karen and General Miller spot each other
They each take a glass of champagne from a waiter
Hey Karen
You look beautiful
bet you say that to all the girls
Yeah  do
And some of the guys
That's why you shouldn't run for Senate
Too many skeletons in your enormous closet
Yeah, don't believe the hype

something

Lingerie

And bestiality
'd forgotten about that
Are you still allergic to that dog
Yes, yes
wake up and my eyes are closed and my head is swollen and  look like a giant ball sack
Oh my god, they do have memdication for that
but a beautiful ball sack, though
And how's the pentagon

No
Just be careful
Don't mess stuff up

Plus contingency already deployed
Er - you've lost me
Miller looks around, grabs a child's laptop
Opens it, it says `howday' in an electronic voice
(') Your military hardware is impressive
Not anymore it isn't
Okay so this is total current deployment
(he types) Europe, Asia
(He types) And the contingency already deployed
(He types) So the current number of combat troops available for an invasion according to these figures would be
(he presses the `equals' button) Twelve
Thousand
No, twelve
Twelve soldiers
Twelve
You're shitting me
Of course 'm shitting you, but 12 thousand isn't enough
Twelve thousand's about how many are going to die
And you really need a few guys alive at the end of a war or it looks like you've lost
Uh-huh
Tomorrow 've got to meet these Brits
Simon Foster
He's the guy that said war was unforseeable, and  think he could very useful on the committee because he could internationalise the dissent

Toby opens, he's in his boxer shorts and shirt
Tobes
Hi
So
What's the plan
What swanky reception are we going to
(panic in his eyes) What's the plan
For tonight
Well that's what 'm asking you Toby, my chief aide, my political advisor
don't know,  thought tonight we'd be tired
(approaching breaking point with Toby) Well  am tired but 'm also a career politician Toby, in the political powerhouse of the world for forty-eight hours
So  thought it might be nice to, you know, go out rather than sit in my room trying to spank one out watching a shark documentary, because 'm scared if watch a porno it'll end up in the Register of Members Interests
So what have you got
Okay
What have  got
Don't bullshit me Toby
Okay - so far, we have
one flyer under the door for happy hour in the bar - which might be interesting
And  have the number of a guy  was with at Uni who believe now works for  out here
No

Attending the war committee

yes, sure 'd love a drink
Forty minutes
Great

He hangs up
Very excited
Starts getting ready to see Liza
Checks his hair in the mirror
Not quite right
He opens a pot of hair gel, takes a scoop and rubs it in his hands, ready to put it in his hair
His phone goes again
Doesn't know what to do
Doesn't want to pick up the phone with gelly hands
No time to wash it off
Grabs a towel and picks up the phone holding the towel
He struggles to press the answer button
Puts the towel- covered phone to his ear

Hi
Hello
He can't hear through the towel
Tries to adjust it

Do sound muffled
Can't mate

Page 48 54     :                                                   54 It's the war committee
What
The actual
war committee
Yeah, Liza says that
Who's going to be there
Karen Clark, Liza, me and Simon
(off Simon's look) Simon and me
Who else is going -- Jimmy Osmond
Gwyneth Paltrow
You've been invited to a diversion
The real committee, the real thing, that's happening at The White House
Toby picks his jacket up
Yeah well, 'll text you the details because 'm going to go out
for  quick drink with some State Department bods
Don't mention this to the press, ok
Don't mention it to anyone
Because if the press get a whiff there's a war committee, even a cardboard one, every fucker in this town is going to turn up and try and get on it
So no matter what gay bar you end up, keep it schtumm
Malcolm flicks the  over to a news channel
was watching that
Malcolm looks at him
have to have a word with you
You might want to slip into your negligee
Toby heads out
Page 49 55
-                            55 Toby and Liza sit in a booth
They are by far the most formally dressed people in the club
band are playing angry rock with a vaguely political message
small knot of people are rocking out
(re : the mosh pit) You see those guys
The mosh pit
Yes,  don't think 've ever seen a more civilised 'mosh pit' it's more of a mosh caucus actually
House staffers, Senators' interns, most of them are half-man half- file
Tonight they rage hard
Tomorrow they go back to the hill and argue noise reduction legislation
They're chuckling, having a good time
(beat, looks at her
) You're worried
(she's been mulling on something else entirely) It's Pwip Pip
'm sorry
Pip Pip
Is this
a person or a cell phone tarrif or
It's my paper
On the war
Pros and Cons of the war
But  came up with too many cons
The pro-war guys have started calling me `Connie'
So, yes 'm fucking worried
My career's on the line
Yeah-  noticed you're worried, cos  saw you looking worried
'm perceptive like that
But
(can't think of anything else) Don't worry
Okay, this place blows
'm going
What are you doing
Page 50 55     :                                                     55 Well 'm incredibly tired
It feels like my brain's eight hours behind but my liver's 12 hours ahead
You don't want to come back to my place for a quick catch up
It's an alluring offer
However, due to technological developments  no longer need sleep, but am physically rejuvenated by alcohol
He guzzles from his beer bottle as they leave
56
'  -                                     56 Toby and Liza are on the bed together, kissing
Could  just say, you know, that what happens in Washington stays in Washington
Yeah  live in Washington
So that doesn't really work for me
57
-                                   57 Malcolm is     still in Simon's room
He's texting
Simon sneaks the     remote and flips from the news back to the shark doc
Malcolm, without looking up, picks up the remote and     flicks back to the news
We are under enormous pressure Simon
Karen will want you to say, `war is unforeseeable'
Linton will want you to talk up `climbing the mountain of conflict'
You say nothing, okay
You can't swing both ways, you're not David fucking Bowie
Right
Can  go to bed now
No, we're going to run that through
Am  being tortured
Page 51 58
'  -                                  58 Toby wakes up
His mouth is parched
He feels terrible
He rolls over
Liza is gone
He can't remember where he is or what's going on
Then with a flash as he looks at the clock - 9
07 he remembers a lot of things in a rush and springs out like a Ninja and starts pulling his clothes on, while scrabbling for his phone
He heads down stairs & out of the apartment
59
'   -                            59 Hello  need a number for a taxi in Washington
Straight through please
He's on the street
(') Hello
need a cab, right now
From
From where
From from (sees the house number ) (') It's 40, 46, that's the number, and it's a street
It's a nice street with houses and cars and a - sidewalk and it's got leaves and - hold on 'm walking, 'm walking to a sign
60
60 Toby running
61
'
61 Karen, Liza and Simon are making small talk
Marcel's is good
Uh-huh
You should go to La Taverna, the Greek place
It's fantastic
They set fire to the cheese
It's a lot of fun
Page 52 61     :                                                   61 It sounds a lot of fun
There's the aerospace museum, the National Gallery
Do they set fire to the paintings
Polite laughter
Toby comes in
Hi 'm sorry 'm so late
(re Toby) And this is your guy
Yes
He's, you know, among my guys
Toby shoots Simon a look
(turning to Toby) 'm Karen
And  believe you already know Liza
(she can't know
) Yes
From college, in England
Pulled an all-nighter
Toby looks to Liza for guidance
She's not giving any
Yes, , uh, got led astray
Oh who by
Uh, well  ran into - people
There's some people from - the MoD over and
Not Penny Grayling
Er - no, another - gang
Right
Wow
didn't know you had so many delegations in town
Page 53 61     : (2)                                          61 (weakly) The British are coming
Well,  need to just check out a couple of things
this seems like a good point to break things up
Er - no problem
They start to get up, not quite sure what's going on
It's been great
Terrific
really appreciate this
Brilliant
62
-                                  62 Simon and Toby walk out into a larger office
They find a couple of seats left out for people waiting and sit down
Various staffers come and go, picking up papers and files, saying hi, looking knackered, all drinking either diet cokes or coffees
Was that
Toby --  don't want to read you the riot act here but  am going to have to read some extracts from the riot act
Like Section 1 paragraph 1 clause 1
Don't leave your boss twisting in the wind and then burst in late smelling like a pissed seaside donkey
(special needs) `The British are coming'
(feels he's taken enough now) So  turned up late to the meeting Simon
'm sorry
But it's not like  threw up in there
Page 54 62     :                                                     62 No you're right
should be thanking you for not throwing up
Well done
You're a star
You didn't wet yourself, you're in the right city, you didn't say anything overtly racist, you didn't pull your dick out and start plucking it and shouting 'willy banjo'
No 'm being unfair, you got so much right
Without actually being there for the beginning of one of the biggest meetings of my career
You're a legend
An uncomfortable beat
That was just - the first bit was it
We're going back in do you
think
We'd barely said hello
've had muggings that have lasted longer than that
We really only spoke about flammable cheese
Liza comes out, passes by
Toby mouths `shit' to himself
(looking at a list on her desk, then to a staffer) Are these all requests to get on the committee
What's going on
Did someone post an invite on Facebook
'm drowning in Senators
It's Senator soup here
Hi Liza
They're uncomfy with each other
Hey Toby
Toby gets up for a private word
(re last night) You feeling okay
Yes, 'm feeling fine
Why were you late
Because
you know
you didn't wake me up
Page 55 62     : (2)                                          62 You looked so sweet
thought you knew what you were doing
was asleep, of course  didn't
That's how people walk out of windows
((hand over phone, calls over) Hey Liza, 've got another call about the Committee from Senator Crudden's office, he wants in too
What is going on here
Fuck
Why's this my problem
Toby you sure you didn't do bad
You didn't mention the committee to anyone else
Nada
Nada
Bad-da
Nada-bada bing-bong ding-dang-dong
(beat, she looks at him) have no idea what 'm saying anymore think  really am still quite drunk
Chad is passing
As Liza turns away Toby's face does a spasm of regret at his brazen lying
Everyone is so hot for your paper
'm running off another ten copies
It's spreading like a virus, Liza
You're in hot water
You're lobsterising
don't feel that
It's by degrees
Wafting
Bisque
smell lobster
Can you smell lobster, Toby
Simon calls Toby back over
(
) Mate
need to
Sure
Toby goes back to Simon Page 56 62     : (3)                                          62 (') So, how far would you go with Linton, you freaky little stalker
Downtown
Or all the way up Brokeback Mountain
63
-                        63 Malcolm is arriving into a meeting room set up with water etc with a young man who looks like an intern,
How are you today
Beat the traffic
Malcolm looking around, as if things aren't right
Yeah yeah
Hunky dory
Can  get a coffee
He gives  his coat
(doesn't take coat then eventually does and just puts it on a chair, not the coat stand) Sure, sure, if we get started, 'll get my assistant to bring us some refreshments
(realising) Your assistant
(sitting, picking up a file in the room) Yeah
So, Item
We need to have a conversation about the mood of the British Parliament
Any bumps in the road ahead
'm sorry son, am  - is this it
No offence, but shouldn't you be at school with your head down a toilet
Your first point there, the offence
'm afraid 'm gonna have to take it
Your second point
'm 22
But - item - It's my birthday in nine days, so if it would be more comfortable we could
wait
Page 57 63     :                                                      63 Don't get sarcastic with me son
(starts dialling) We burnt this tight-arsed city to the ground in 1814 and 'm all for doing it again
Starting with you, you frat fuck
You get sarcastic with me again and will stuff so much cotton wool dowm your fucking throat it'll come out of your arse like the wee tail on a playboy bunny
Okay
thought
was led to believe  was attending the war committee
Yes, Assistant Secretary of State Linton Barwick wanted me to brief you on the work of the Future Planning Committee
don't want the bullshit son,  want the bull
No one sidelines me
'm away
Malcolm gets up, grabs his coat
An even younger guy wheels in a coffee trolley
(') And here we go - the fucking Vice President has also graced us with his presence
Malcolm runs out, on the phone
Malcolm runs out of the White House
64
-                                       64 power walking/jogging on the phone to
() Where is the fucking war committee meeting
Simon's going to the war committee thought you knew
() thought  was going to the war committee
Tell me where the fuck it's happening
Page 58 64     :                                                   64 It's on the 7th floor in room 712
(Beat) Oh Malcolm, do you like how 'm telling you what's going on where you are
() Well let me tell you what's going on where you are sweet heart, a certain vinegar faced maniplulative cowbag is about to find that she's out of a fucking job
hangs up
65
-                                     65 Simon and Toby are looking through magazines and papers
Karen is exiting her office with an entourage
Here she comes - shit - look like we're meeting, look like we're having a meeting
(as she passes, re magazine) and if you look
at the line they take in Newsweek - that's very much
another narrative
See you at the committee
(like he's busy) Yeah, yeah sure, see you in a mo
Just finishing off some stuff
(to Toby loud) Okay, we're all done there
Let's roll
Toby looks at him
As they get up and follow her at speed, tripping to keep up
(quiet) don't think you can say that anymore here
They don't like that
Shut up
Follow them
Don't lose them
Lets rock
Page 59 65     :                                                     65 They follow Karen around a corner and she disappears into a set of doors, they follow her through, but it is the vestibule before a toilet door
Karen looks at them
Hello
Hello
Are you joining me or shall  see you there
See you there
don't need to
do any of the things you need to go in there to do, so 'll just see you there
Karen goes into the toilet
Simon and Toby head off looking sheepish
As they head out of the vestibule
There is a gaggle of Karen hangers-on
Chad-type staffers looking to get in with Karen
66
712 -                                     66 Linton is with Adriano, quietly horrified by all these people
General Miller passes them
(For Miller's benefit) We seem to be overrun with insurgents here, Bob
Hi, 'm in seat 204, row
Will  be able to see the big screen from there
Oh, and can  get one of those big pointy foam hands with `Go, Monster Trucks
' written on it
The general is on rare form, very rare form
Toby spots his hero
There he is
General George Miller
(And
) Right, yep
There he is
Page 60 66     :                                                    66 But the room is rapidly filling with bodies and din
More and more people are turning up
Toby's view of Miller is obscured
That's the second time in 24 hours 've had a partially obscured view of him
67
67 Linton calls the over-stuffed, standing-room-only room to order
Okay, due to the fact that seemingly everyone in the world who owns a suit has turned up for this meeting, we'll be relocating to a bigger room
Room 720
So, if you will be so kind
The committee members file out
68
-                 68 Malcolm is legging it down the street
69
720 -                             69 The committee members file in
Miller goes close up to Linton
Just so you know -- Karen and  did not appreciate having to sneak around like Mulder and Scully trying to find out about this committee
Well, you're both here now
John and Yoko
You and  need to talk, mano-a-mano, cocks on the block, about how things are operating around here at the moment
Linton not fazed by this
Sure
How about 12:30 tomorrow, my office
Page 61 69     :                                                   69 Good
General Miller takes his seat
Linton turns on Adriano
What the hell happened
have no idea how they all heard sir
There must have been a leak
General Miller is sitting next to Karen
They're watching Linton having angry words with Adriano
Look at Adriano
Poor fuck
He looks like he's with his Daddy: "Sorry, Bob, you're adopted
From a couple with hereditary heart defects
" "And your mother only ever kept your baby clothes for the purposes of voodoo
" Simon is sitting with Toby, marvelling at the numbers of people cramming into the room
'm room meat again
This is a massive abattoir of room meat
Stay outside Tobes,  need a guy on the outside
Make friends with Chad, that boy from The Shining
He knows stuff
Pump him
Oh no
want to stay in here with Miller
Don't make me pump Chad
'm making you pump Chad
Go on
Toby gets up to leave
(') It'll be easy peasy lemon squeezy
No it won't
It'll be difficult difficult lemon difficult
Toby reluctantly leaves, trying to grab another peek at Miller
Page 62 70
-              70 Malcolm running like a madman
71
720 -                          71 Everyone is finally assembled
The room has thirty or so people in it
So, welcome to this, somewhat engorged session of the Future Planning Committee
You can all see an agenda
People are looking at their agendas, low-level chatter, pouring of water, etc
- a general pre-meeting feel
Assistant Secretary -- here on point 6, it feels like there's an assumption that we'll be invading
Should we talk about the practical
mean this is the war committee after all
It's the Future Planning Committee
Unofficially it's known as the war committee
Well, unofficially we can call anything whatever we like
(he holds up a water glass) Unofficially, this is a shoe
But it's not a shoe, Karen, it's a glass of water, and this is the Future Planning Committee
72
7TH  -                        72 Malcolm is running down the corridor
He runs into Room 712
It's empty
Bitch
73
73 Karen is talking
Page 63 73     :                                                     73 But what 'm asking is has a decision been reached in principle to advocate invasion
That's way off agenda Karen
Although it would seem a general consensus may be forming
What makes you say that
Well  noted with interest the recent comments of our colleague Simon Foster in that regard
Simon is texting under the desk and not really paying full attention
He hears his name, looks up, waves to the group
He doesn't clock Karen's intense look that says `You are going to rebut that, aren't you
' Perhaps Mr
Foster would have something to say about that
(politely) 'm just
watching with interest Britain we have a saying for complicated situations such as this, which is that it's (he can't believe he's going to say this) `Difficult, difficult, lemon, difficult
' He goes back to his text
As  say it seems a consensus is forming
(furious) That's just ridiculous
You have no basis for saying that
Karen, please, calm down
We don't want you to have another hemorrhage
Item One
Page 64 - 74                                                               74 It's lunchtime
Lots of staffers have left their desks few are eating sandwiches at their desks, or reading a newspaper during lunch
Chad is emailing, reading, multi- tasking, from a corner of desk near Linton's office
So - do you want to go out and get some lunch
Are you kidding
Lunchtime is work time
Yes, what an incredibly depressing motto
You see you're playing into the hands of the French saying that
Toby mooches around, peers in Linton's office
He spots a couple of A4 sheets of paper that have been printed out with `Climb the mountain of conflict
' across them as an encouraging slogan on the wall
(') (looking in) Jesus
Yeah work hours are too valuable - for networking
You gotta get in at like 6 work till 8
30 Then start making those connections baby
(he clicks his fingers rapidly, annoyingly) Emails and admin at lunch
See if you can play some strategic racquetball through the pm
Then in the six till midnight slot chow down on some serious policy work
Right
And what - friends, family, novels, sexual inter-course you're going to save those for your thirties and forties
75
/ -               75 Malcolm arrives at the committee just as people are spilling out
He's pissed off
Follows Linton into bathroom
Are you fucking me about
Page 65 75     :                                                   75 Mr Tucker, isn't it
Hello again
You might pull this kind of stunt on some young wank fresh up from Oklahoma, happy to be getting his hookers paid for by tobacco lobbyists, but not me
What seems to be the problem
've just had a briefing from a 9-year- old finalist in Americas got talent think he may have been a ventriloquist
Or possibly the fucking dummie
He is one of my top guys
Stanton College Prep, Harvard
he's smart and he's great at his job
His fucking briefing notes were written in Alphabetti Spaghetti
When  left nearly tripped over his umbilical cord
'm sorry if it troubles you that our people achieve excellence at a young age
Simon is emerging
Linton takes Malcolm to one side, out of Simon's earshot
(') By the way, your prime minister informs me that he's tasked you with collating some fresh British intel for us
Yeah, apparently your fucking master race of gifted toddlers can't quit get the job done in between breast feeds and playing with their power rangers
So yeah, we're getting some actual grown-ups to bail you out
Simon gets closer
Linton moves in
(to Simon) Minister, thank you so much for your support and your recent "Climb the mountain of conflict" comment - great
We're going to run with that, it has great repeatability
Page 66 75     : (2)                                          75 Thanks very much, but
it's all a bit complex really, in terms of my
Linton pulls away, starts walking off
It's early days, my friend
All roads lead to Munich
He smiles and walks off
What the fuck does that mean
`All roads lead to Munich'
Well it just means
guess,  don't know what it means
`All roads lead to Munich'
Malcolm is pissed off, looks around
He is not the centre of attention
He's feeling cut out
(') Come on let's go, get back to the hotel, nick as many coat hangers as you can
We're off back to London
76
76 Malcolm, Toby, and Simon are heading towards their car
They see the Washington Monument in the distance
It's beautiful
If you pull it out, America deflates
Don't mock that
The closest you'll come to getting one of those is buying a Toblerone
(Looks at Blackberry) Mark Hadley's dad's died
Oh no
Should we send Mark a card
Nah, 'll send him a ouija board so they can keep in touch
Page 67 76     :                                                     76 So what are we getting back to
Apart from a nice cup of tea and some knife crime
Constituency surgery in Northampton
Great, meeting my constituents
It's like being Simon Cowell, but without the ability to say, `Fuck off, you're mental
' 77
77 and  are with Simon's constituency agent, , she's ushering them into the small, damp little constituency office
's arm is in a sling (Jo Scanlon's arm actually is in a sling) and she has difficulty opening the door (to Simon) Sorry, could you
You just need to kick the bottom quite hard
Simon kicks the bottom of the door to unstick it
Roz opens the door
There are a few constituents waiting to see Simon, he nods a hello
(Roz has gone ahead, this is to Toby) Look at them
They all have that smell
like a charity shop, you know
(to constituents) Afternoon
couple of the waiting constituents respond
They go through to another little office
Right, here you go, you're pretty booked up - there's a list on the desk
'm just going to have a look at the guttering
'm just back from America, so it was pretty tough to make it up here - but you know
That's me
Of course
Right
How was the President
Page 68 77     :                                                   77 She's heading off
Good actually
And what was the White House like
Blown up by spaceships
78
-                                     78 General Miller & Aides up stairs 79
-                                     79 General Miller (and an aide or two
) marches into Linton and Karen's section of State
He's got a meeting scheduled
He's a man on a mission
He marches straight past Bob Adriano
(by way of explanation) Twelve-thirty
Um, hold on General
And into Linton's office
But - it's empty
What the fuck
Yeah, Secretary Linton Barwick wanted me to let you know his last - meeting looks like it's over-running
He sends apologies
Miller stands there for a beat
Very very annoyed
He stood me up
They're better be a fucking good reason
Like he's dead
That is just plain fucking rude
mean, how would he like it if  just did a big hairy shit on his desk
You're very w-welcome to wait, we have newspapers and periodicals
Page 69 79     :                                                   79 He gestures to a seating area
Miller picks up a magazine
Rolls it up, looks at Bob Adriano
Might Miller, possibly, hit him
Yeah well excuse me if at this time of national crisis  don't sit with a thumb up my ass flipping through Time magazine eating pop tarts
(he heads off fast - not quite sure where he's going, calls back as he goes) Tell him to call me
But he might not get through cos 'm a fucking busy man
He finds himself heading into Karen's office
It's empty
He stands there for a beat
Shuts the door
Looks around
Picks up a hole punch
Kicks the couch
Karen enters, surprised to find him there
Hey, what is it
Yeah - can  hang around in here for a while
Er
Sure
Why
Do  need a fucking reason
(beat, calming down) Linton's playing me like a fucking turkey drumstick on a big bass drum
Look,  was going to order food, do you want to eat
Yeah
Order us some cute mammals
Alive
lamb or a piglet so  can snap it's fucking neck
- 80                                                                  80 Simon listens behind a desk
Roz is there taking notes
Toby is in the corner working on a laptop
Page 70 80     :                                                    80 My point is - if the septic tank - if we didn't know it was there in the first place how can we be responsible for it now
Yes
No
understand
It's under the communal drive
Why should we get it pumped
(looking through the paperwork) Well it's not a council sceptic tank so they're not legally obliged to pump it
Look, according to the paperwork there's four metric tons of of shit under there
That's not all me, is it
'm not a flipping elephant am
No, of course not
Nor should you be treated like one
Okay, Mrs McDairmid
Leave it with me
'm sure there must be a way through this
Alright
Mrs Kendrick heads out
Er, Colin Lowe
Jesus
Still on about bendy buses
(thinks) No
Tell him no
What else
Toby closes the laptop
Pauline Michaelson's son about the constituency office wall
Toby exits to get coffee as Roz brings in (as he enters) Hi, thanks for seeing me Mr
Foster
Hi Paul, call me Simon
You've met Roz
Page 71 80     : (2)                                          80 know  have
Lovely
Okay, Simon, 'll try to keep it brief because  can see you're a busy man
There's a bloke out there wants to make it illegal to talk in a foreign language in shops
Yes, well, this place can become a magnet for the mentally dispossessed
And for sensible people like yourself, Paul
Patronising
Why don't you explain your issue, Mr Michaelson
sorry, is this a joke
How many times
For the fourth f
ing time
(as to an idiot) The side wall
Of this property
Your wall
Is falling over
On to my mum's garden
She called you up - but she got fobbed off by your people
Because she's not Lord Snooty in his posh car
Because she's not Madonna on a horse
That
agree, it's unacceptable
Toby comes back in, hands Simon a coffee
Do you know what this is
(he hums something irritating) That's your constituency office hold music
don't want it in my head, do
(checks notes) We did arrange to get a quote from a builder, but
Roz has a call on the landline
Page 72 80     : (3)                                          80 Patch from London
They say it's urgent
Karen Clark
Is she the coracle woman
Right
Paul,  really need to take this, but  haven't forgotten about you, okay
No, well 'm not going anywhere, Simon
You won't be able to forget me because 'll be sitting here staring at you
Toby, can  hand Paul over to you
"Can  fob Paul off with you
" Simon goes elsewhere in the room to take his call
So, Paul, where are we up to
(off Paul's scary look) was out getting coffee
Sorry
He grabs a pen and paper
81
' '  -                          81 (  ) Later
General Miller is with Karen
They're surrounded by cartons of Chinese take-out
(flicking through Liza's paper) See, this is the problem with civilians wanting to go to war
When you've been there you don't want to go back unless you absolutely have to
It's like France
(re the paper in it's red folder) You finally read Liza's paper
Course,  read it
'm a voracious reader
'm the fucking Gore Vidal of the Pentagon
(pointing at a spring roll) You don't want that
Page 73 81     :                                                     81 Yes  want that
(points to various packages) want that, that, that, that and that
Those  don't care about
And these let's pack up and drop on North Korea
(beat, reads) Someone should leak this
Outside Liza sees them discussing her paper animatedly
It doesn't look good to her
Someone maybe shaped a little bit like you
Me
Are you kidding
You have more gravitas
Exactly
'm too senior
can't leak
Leaking is for people like your Liza and the Boy called It out there
(eats) It's insane
Not only is the case against war incredibly strong, the case for is caveated to hell
(reading) "Most analysts believe the state is looking to expand aggressively beyond its borders
" Then here in the caveats, the only source is `Ice Man' - a possible alcoholic - who's probably called that cos he gets through ten bags / icebergs a day in his fucking vodka tonics
say we can't trust him
That's us disputing our own findings
Has Linton read this
'm not sure he reads
You're a General
Have him killed
You see this is why we never got together
That and the hobo teeth

Well, yeah
mean, your lot are probably getting it somehow, but our lot shouldn't be
Paul Michaelson calls over
'm still here, Simon
What's going on Simon
Departmental business
About a wall
Gaza
Uh-huh
What can  do for you
Where were you in the committee
called for back-up, you sat there like a dumb sack of shit
Maybe worse, cos at a molecular level a bag of shit is probably fizzing with energy
Well - okay
Yes
Um
Well,  have to say Karen,  have a clear strategy here
'm playing the long game
There is no long game
They've bounced us into a short game
You looked like a
what do you call it in England 'wanker We don't call it that, no
But she's gone
83
-                                  83 Toby's still talking to Paul the wall guy
Paul, look, mate
Page 75 83     :                                                     83 Patronising
Sorry
But 'm on your side
have to look after my Mum too
You do, or they get shafted don't they
So
Simon wants to talk
Roz takes over
'm going to pursue this with, what do they call it
Extreme prejudice, to the very end
can be enormously persistent
Ask my ex-girlfriend
Okay, well, 'll take your details
Roz leads Paul away That guy's a bit full-beam
Full-beam
Yeah, full-beam
Headlights
(he opens his eyes wide to show what he means) kept thinking, is he going to nut me
He appears not to be nutting me, but he might well nut me
So what did Karen Clark want
Do you think  came over as weak on the committee over there
Well, uh, no, of course not
suppose - Simon's phone goes again
He winces picks up

/
-             84 : Also - the war committee got leaked, and that leak came from your department

On a plate
To go

You're not my boss
Fuck off
You can't make me sack people

-                                                   85 Simon is getting into his office - he and Toby are back from the constituency office
We need to talk in my office
About what
(patronising) think you know
land line is ringing in the open plan office
Judy picks up
Simon has gone into his office and has assumed the bollocking position
(taking call) Sorry, this is the wrong extension
'll put you through now
Judy punches a button on her phone
Toby's land line starts ringing
Simon comes out
(walking backwards into his office) Come, come into my office
Why
Why do you need to see me
(to Judy) What's this
Page 77 85     :                                                     85 It's the mad man about the wall
The war
The wall
(following her out, exasperated) Can you come into my office so  can tell you off
Toby answers his phone, resigned
Hello
Can  help you
Malcolm sweeps in, straight past Toby, slapping him on the back of the head as he passes
(') You fucker
(to phone) No, not you
Malcolm pushes Judy back into Simon's office as she's leaving it, Simon behind Judy walks backwards to his desk, the three of them in a line
Malcolm shuts the door and unleashes a torrent of abuse we can't hear
86
' /
-              86 Wall man Paul is on the phone, standing with a by the offending wall, now badly propped up
The journalist is taking notes and photographs
: What can  do for you Paul
These `temporary buttresses' you got put up
Right
They're basically a pair of twigs
Thin twigs
Page 78 86     :                                                   86 'm sure they're not twigs
No they're twigs
(to Journalist) Are you getting a picture of those twigs
That wall could fall on my mum and crush her
Do you know how old she is
(calling off) Mum, how old are you
want to tell the newspaper guy
(
) Sixty
During this conversation Malcolm arrives
want a word with the minister and Charlotte Fucking Bronte
You're never fucking sixty
You're older than that
Sixty
How old are you really
(
) 'm sixty
If it's going in a newspaper, 'm sixty
Fuck off are you sixty
Olivia Newton- John's fucking sixty
And she's not on the statins, is she
Could you tell your mum to stay away from the wall just for the time being
She needs to get to her plants
(like Toby's an idiot) She has to water them
Plants need water
No, sure, but could she use a hose, from a distance
She doesn't have a hose, she's got a watering can
This is like talking to a brick wall about a brick wall
(to journalist) Get that down, that's gold
Toby can still see Malcolm going ballistic at Simon and Judy in Simon's office
Page 79 87
-                         87 Karen runs out of the lifts
There's even more of a buzz than usual, people running around
She sees Bob Adriano, Linton and Chad in a huddle in Linton's air
Hurries over to Liza
Liza, what's up
Why is everyone running around
This better be a fucking fire drill
The President has said he's vetoing tarrifs on Chinese auto imports
Shit
Karen calls over to a staffer,
(') Abbey, get me the president's statement
Mr Barwick has asked me to
Karen is   beginning to lose it
You work to me, Abbey, you fucking work to me
Get me the statement
Or  will call security and have you escorted off the premises via the window
Karen crosses quickly to her office
Liza follows
Sorry, why is that
He's
what, buttering the Chinese up
He needs them to at least abstain in the security council

We're going to the
Yes, we're going to the
Shit

should be told this fucking stuff
'm going into Linton's office and pulling the pin on his grenade
Don't do that
'm fucking joking
Oh
Why didn't you know about this
Well since  created the budget deficit the President doesn't tend to run things by me anymore
Don't get funny with me
am not in the mood
No
'm getting that
88
'  -                                       88 Malcolm is with Simon and Toby
Malcolm has a local Northamptonshire paper
(reading) "While Foster jets around at the taxpayer's expense, his constituency headquarter's wall's collapsing and he doesn't give a shit
It doesn't say that
(holding up paper) No but it says `Wall-ace and Gromitt' Wall-ace though
Page 81 88     :                                                   88 You are being portrayed as the biggest twat in Northamptonshire, and that's going some
It is just a wall, Malcolm
Listen, my little stem cell,  don't want to be dealing with this either, okay
've got bigger fucking fish to fry, believe me
'm rolling blue whales in breadcrumbs at the moment
'm giving this to Jamie
Oh great
The crossest man in Scotland
Jamie enters, holding another local rag
Well, if it isn't Humpty-Numpty
What is this, surround bollocking
With respect,  haven't finished
If it isn't Humpty-Numpty, sitting on top of a collapsing wall like some clueless egg- cunt
Hi Jamie
Hello
Okay, that's enough of the fucking Oxbridge pleasantries
How is saying "hello" a
(grabbing a hole-puncher) Shut it, Love, Actually, or 'll hole- punch your face
Right, 'm off to deal with the fate of the planet, okay
Simon, Toby and Jamie look at him
Page 82 88     : (2)                                          88 (') Don't look at me like that's arrogant
That is just a fucking fact
Don't even look at me
(to Jamie) Be gentle with them
You know me, Malcy, kid gloves
Made from real kids
Malcolm leaves
An awkward beat
(') Right, Butch and Gaydance, this wall story is playing badly
(looking in his paper) Look, here's a cartoon of you as a walrus
walrus
'm not fat
don't even have a moustache
Look
we hired some builders
They didn't turn up when they said they would
They're builders
What did you expect
Have you ever seen a film where the hero is a builder
No
Because they never turn up in the fucking nick of time
That's why you never see a superhero with a hod

Malcolm has gone in ahead

Simon draws Judy to one side
This is all getting
this is a really stressful job, you know that
Oh come on, you're not a brain surgeon, you're not a snooker player
don't want to back a war, Judy

Right

Look, drop some hints, put some nods and winks out there, that 'm toying with resignation
Yeah
See if the  reacts
See how it plays
Put out some winks
And nods
Big nods
No, no, just sort of
(he does a small nod) That sort of size nod
Judy nods
(') No, not that much
No,  was just nodding normally to say understood the need for a small nod
Oh
Good
They head in

Malcolm is with Michael, Suzy and a couple of other civil servants
So, my lovely friends, bottom line
hate that phrase
We're not in retailing Sorry Michael,  promise never to use it again

This will be the voe to commence military action
So, Rob, Innis, (to Toby) Little Bo Cock Jockey (to Judy) And the leaky fucking mingebox, return to your desks and prepare for some extreme briefing
Two   get up and exit
Judy walks across the room and starts making calls, as does Toby
Michael walks off into the next room, Suzy follows
They start calling
(') Now then, you still got doubts, Complicated Simon
What the fuck, Malcolm
This is all going to spin along from here and we have a vote and we go to war
We fight people, and kill them, and our kids get killed, and that's exactly the sort of thing didn't want to do when  went into politics
That's the opposite of what want to be doing
That's why you've got to stay in Government
In here you can influence things, delay things
Out there you're just another mad shouty fucker people don't want to make eye-contact with
Remember Mary
She took a stand over Health
Everyone decided she was mental
Only because the Sun showed a photo of her with wide eyes and her head on a cow
found that a very powerful image

He doesn't drink blood, he doesn't go round biting tramps
He doesn't go to Chequers at the weekend for a bit of light raping and a pub lunch
know the Prime Minister isn't a Viking, Malcolm
Unlike me, the man abhors physical violence

Yeah
Where's the intelligence
Where's the hard evidence
Listen, We've got evidence harder than a diamond dildo
We have intelligence so deep and hard it would fucking puncture your kidneys
There's an informant, `Ice Man',
The stuff he's giving us
It'll make your blood run cold
And clot
Your insides will turn to black pudding

But you're going to see it, because the  regards you as a key player now
Judy's mobile goes
Judy Molloy
() Ten minutes
Thanks

He want you to go the Malcolm's heading out

Then nods a slight nod again

Judy's got her power walking trainers on and her rucksack with her
Cheers everyone
Here's to surviving another day
They clink glasses
My theory is Malcolm built Jamie in a lab out of bits of old psychopath
Toby arrives, dumps his coat, bag, puts his phone on the table
Hello ladies
And gentleman
(doing the joke again) Hello ladies
'm just going to - Oh
Lovely
think we could have another bottle of Sancerre
Great
If you can afford it
If you can get served at the bar
He goes to the bar
His phone gets a text
Suzy picks it up, reads it
Fucking hell
Here we go again
Fucking arsehole
You're kidding
What's it say
(peering at the phone) Woah
Suzy shows the phone to Judy
What a twat

Are you replying

Toby's coming back
Suzy puts the phone back down
Yeah  wouldn't want to meet Jamie in a dark alley
Or a bright alley
The whole thing of just being in an alley with him would be scary, regardless of the lighting
Suzy cuts in
You've got a text
(reading, covering) Oh yeah
It's just Rob about football
So, Liza
You shagged her
What
No
(to Judy) Did you know my flakey boyfriend has been getting his flakey end away
don't know anything about his flakey end
Could we not talk about accusations and, health issues, in the pub
should go
You haven't finished your drink
No
mainly have
Why did you do it

Your geography teacher's jacket
Toby thinks better of responding

Michael takes over That's not how you fold
Michael, this is one of the more humiliating moments of my life

Enormous
You can see them on Google Earth

Suzy is there without Michael

Okay
Toby struggles to open the front door
Suzy opens it
Toby goes to leave then stops
Look, Suzy, this is probably going to sound odd under the circumstances
Quickie
No
Thank you
But no
It's about Liza
Oh good tell me more, tell me more about her tits
Listen, Suze, Liza wrote a paper, Pwip- Pip
think, if it got leaked, it could stop the war
He holds out the memory stick
Good tactic
Get earnest
tried that with the wife
Didn't work
You are such a fucking coward, you know that
And this is what
make up leak
Does such a thing exist

Should  resign
've floated that might, when  thought  wouldn't, so it'll look convincing if  did
mean, do you think, is it braver to just resign and say, `No, no war'
Yes
Or is it actually braver to say, ` don't agree, but 'm going to grit my teeth and get on with it
' Is the really brave thing actually doing what you don't believe
No
Though -- maybe
What's brave about doing the `right thing'
Nothing
Doing the wrong thing is braver
In a way
mean, you know, wars sometimes work
The War of Independence, that worked
For the Americans
Second World War
That was a good idea
mean not a good idea but
know what you mean
And the Crimean War -- we got nurses out of that
Nurses are good
(as if they've achieved something) Exactly
So
right
Exactly
So you're not resigning

This is it
The United Nations
It's all a bit `blurrrgh', isn't it
It could do with a few more scatter cushions and a bit less asbestos
don't know what you were expecting -- Jacobean panelling perhaps, arabesques of stonework tracery
great fountains
It's a shithole
It looks like a hospice for robots
They pass a big office
Linton Barwick is in there
Karen Clark is there
You're right here
Sir Jonathan shows them to their office
(') If you need anything, just whistle
You know how to whistle don't you Malcolm
You just put your lips together and blow
Malcolm and Toby look at one another
(') Right
'm off upstairs to the informal delegates' reception
Hope there's nibbles, 'm ravenous
Sir Jonathan leaves
Nibbles
Who still says nibbles
Fuck the nibbles, what was with the homoerotic tension
Malcolm gets a call
Page 94 97      :                                                   97 Jamie
Hello
He looks at his phone
(') No fucking signal down here
Jesus
'd be better off in an internet cafe in Kircoddy
He leaves the room

10 -                                        98 Jamie is on the phone, running down a corridor
Okay, your phone's off, which means you've been shot dead by a fat American, but there's been a fucktastrophe
Someone's leaked Liza Weld's Pwip Pip paper to the
reckon it'll be on the Six 'Clock news here, one o'clock your time, so it's going to fist your fucking vote apart
Missing you loads, pwip-pip, toodle-oo
99
-                                           99 Malcolm finishing listening to his voicemail, dialling and running back into the building, pushing past a crowd of smokers at the doorway
Okay Jamie, two jobs
One: find the Pwip Pip leaker and kill them
That's one job
Job one has two parts
Job two: stop Pwip Pip coming out
Sow enough seeds of fear and doubt that the fat arses at the dither till after the vote, okay
After the vote Enola Gay is cleared for take- off and everything is groovy
love you
100
/ -                          100 Lots of delegates drinking and eating and chatting
We glimpse Linton, Karen, General Miller
Sir Jonathan is there, mingling
Malcolm approaches Simon, Toby, Judy and Sir Jonathan
Page 95 100     :                                                  100 (to Sir Jonathan) Do not move from this spot or 'll fucking stab you
Hm
(to Simon) Was it you
No, what
No
But you know what 'm talking about
No, but whatever it was  didn't do it
(to Toby) Was it you, The-Baby-From-Eraserhead
No
(to Judy) So it must have been you Woman from The Crying Game
It wasn't me
You've really got it in for me haven't you
Someone's dropped a bollock in the noodles and  reckon it was you
We've done this all before
You accused me of leaking last time and it wasn't me
Yeah well  know you didn't leak last time
But what  reckon is you got so pissy about being accused, you leaked this time
Yeah
Yeah, that does sound possible
Look Springer Spaniel, keep your little wet nose out alright
Page 96 100     : (2)                                         100 'm just saying psychologically speaking that sounds plausible - that you might build up a resentment and then pay it off in some underhand way
That's just something 've observed
Malcolm's had enough goes over and grabs Sir Jonathan, mid-conversation, and manhandles him away
Come on, Baldermort,  need a word
Meanwhile Judy and Toby are left alone - Toby embarrassed about his comments
(they look at each other) Sorry about that - it's just
(mumbles) something 've observed
Wanker
It's okay
It's fine
It's probably just the stress of this awful, awful war
Malcolm drags the ambassador into a corner
We're in a new reality now and You've got to speed things up
What things
Speed up what
The debate
It needs to start at eleven o'clock, not one thirty
Hehe
Can  perhaps briefly explain the way the process works
And why that isn't possible
You see through that door there are a number of secretariats that are currently doing what we call the washing up now
Just fucking do it, fishlips
Otherwise you'll find yourself in some medieval warzone in the Caucasus with your arse in the air, trying to persuade a group of men in balaclavas that sustained sexual violence is not the way forward
Page 97 100     : (3)                                         100 No, it can't be
mean it could be done, it just can't
Then 'll do it
(motioning to a door) They're through there
Yes but you can't go in, that would be a serious breach of protocol
He's blocking Malcolm
Malcolm grabs his hand
Then you do it
Get in there
He is almost man-handling him in
'm not dancing with you Malcolm
'm leading, look follow my lead
You're not dancing me into the secretariat
Jonathan breaks off and under his own steam prepares to go in
As Malcolm is leaving Miller blocks his path
Where's the intel
Are you sure you're working as hard as me
Cos 'm sweating spinal fluid here
'm a husk
You get everything you need
(in a hurry) Oh yeah  think so
Thanks
(a beat, thinks) Oh, Whoa whoa whoa just a wee moment General Flintstone
Was it you
Did you leak Pwip Pip
know you can't fire a gun, but can you use a fax
No, see, because 'm upfront about what do
don't creep around like some fucking gay mercenary doing other people's dirty work
Page 98 100     : (4)                                         100 'm doing my own work
'm doing my job
Uh-hu
think you're doing Linton's dirty work
think you're his English bitch and if  walked into your hotel room tonight 'd find you on all fours in fishnets and him hanging out the back of you
Oooo
Tough talk from the armchair General
What you going to do
Throw a cushion at me
Put your feet up on a poof and go back to sleep why don't you
Listen, Tucker, you may be some scary poodlefucker back in London, but here
You know what you look like
fucking squeezed dick
You got a blue vein running all the way up to your temple there
That's where 'd put the fucking bullet
But 'd stand well back
You look like you'd be a squirter
Have you ever even killed anybody
Really
Yep
Falling asleep on someone doesn't count
(closer) 've done my share
How many you kill, pussy drip
Personally,  prefer maiming
Go on, tough guy, take a swing at me
'll smack you so fucking hard you'll be shitting teeth
Go ahead
can see the headlines now
'Peace-Loving General Starts Fight In , Swiss Intervene'
don't know, 'm no expert on spin but could that hurt your career
Page 99 100     : (5)                                         100 They eyeball each other
Is Miller going to hit him
He doesn't
(') Right
Do excuse me
've got work to do
Oh, and don't  call me fucking English again
101
-                               101 Sir Jonathan walks in
lot of faces are turned towards him, expectantly
Hello everyone
was wondering if might suggest a cheeky early vote
Bit of an adventure
Maybe, we could knock off early, go for a drink
Ha
'm kidding
Or am
No,  am
102
'   -                          102 Karen and Miller are looking at a computer screen, presumably reading about Simon's floated resignation
(looking at computer) There it is
Simon's going
Everyone's saying he's going
Simon passes their open door
(spotting Simon) Simon
There he is
Simon
(re internet) This is great shit
wasn't sure you had the nerve
You're resigning
Ah okay
They're not running with that have not said that
You're not resigning
You're still playing the hawk
It's much subtler than that
It's nuanced
'm playing a much cleverer game than that
'm a (whispering) fake hawk
Page 100 102     :                                                102 'm sorry
(whispering) Fake hawk
You're a fake hawk
You're a fucking idiot
You're not a fake idiot are you
Karen and Miller go into a confab
Karen and Miller immediately go into a huddle and start planning Simon's future
(to General Miller, as if Simon's not there) We could just tell the press he's going anyway
Say he's confirmed to us that he's resigning
Sorry
second that
What
You can't
Do we announce it before or after the vote
During
Then he can't do anything about it
Great
That's decided then
No
No it's bloody not
'm - me
You're not me
decide about all the main things about me, okay
Not you
Me
No
No Simon
'm afraid not
Not on this one
This is too big for you
Be realistic
You're being used
We all are
The one thing we can do now to influence things is to resign
Sacrifice ourselves
That's our only weapon
Page 101 102     : (2)                                         102 Like a suicide bomber
No, not like a suicide bomber
suicide bomber gets to make a decision
103
-                                103 Toby and Liza are sitting near each other on the floor working on laptops
They're at right-angles to each other
Toby has a view of Liza
She's facing away from him
Listen, 'm really sorry about Suzy and the texting and
Good
Thanks
Do you have figures there for  minimum requirements
Er
Conventional Forces in Europe
Sure
'll just dig that out
(beat, taps on his laptop, then very quietly) Look it was a very special evening for me and
(pissed off) Sorry
What
You're mumbling
just wandered if tonight when all this shit is over we couldn't - you know
You're single
'm single now
You're a woman
'm not
You want to have sex again
It's not a terrible idea is it
One more
For the Gipper
You know what a douchbag is Toby
You're a douchbag on fucking wheels
Page 102 103     :                                                103 Thanks
That was short and sweet
Well, short and sour
104
-                                     104 Simon is sitting in the Meditation Room, a stark chapel- like room with a big piece of granite in the middle of it
He's biting his nails, thinking
Judy comes in
You okay
'm thinking of becoming a suicide bomber
That's certainly a very powerful way of getting your point across
He pulls out some mints
Would you like a mint
'm okay thanks
Are you thinking to overdose on mints
Because
Simon eats a mint
He's lost in his own world
Staring, maybe slightly nodding at the thoughts in his own head
Do you like me Judy
You're my boss
Yeah, but do you actually like me
beat
Sure
Look, 'll leave you to your thoughts
Page 103 104     :                                                104 haven't got any thoughts
'm just staring vacantly into space while a distant voice in the back of my head goes "oh shit" like a car alarm in the middle of the night
Simon eats another mint
Sits there noisily sucking it
Judy leaves
105
-                                       105 Michael and Suzy are sitting talking in an  office
Jamie bursts in
Was it you
Sorry
Not you
know it wasn't you, you're too fucking horny for your Knighthood
( ) Was it you
Was what me
Was it fucking you
Answer the question
She can't very well answer the question if you don't tell her what it is, can she
Fuck off to your room, Count of Cunty Cristo, this is between me and her
(to Suzy) You leaked Liza Weld's paper to the
Tell me you leaked it
didn't leak anything
don't know what you're talking about
You're lying
You touched your nose
That's what's called a `tell'
You are lying
Page 104 105     :                                                105 No 'm not
`No 'm not
' That's a tell as well
Classic
(changing tack to terror) know the leak came from here, from this fucking fax machine here
He pushes a fax casually off the table onto the floor
(') This is what 'm doing to the machine
(he kicks it, hard till bits start to break off, but he's still quite controlled talking, as he kicks more) You see
This is how angry  am with the piece of office equipment which leaked this document, so can you imagine how angry  am with the person who did it
Yeah
Can you Suzy
He kicks the fax machine again
It was me
Oh fuck off
Don't come over all Spartacus now
leaked it
What
Advances on Michael, becomes aware of the music
Jamie points to the  player
(') Okay for a start turn that fucking row off
It's just fucking vowels
Listen to it
Just subsidised fucking foreign vowels
You only listen to that shit because it's bad form to actually wear a big hat that says " went to private school"
Michael doesn't turn it off, so Jamie does
(') Who did you leak it to
Page 105 105     : (2)                                         105 just sent it
thought it was important so  sent it through
(considers then, ) Ok
See this fax machine
(kick) That's your career
'm pretty sure it's fucked
Let me just check (kick)
Yeah, it is
Plus, breach of Official Secrets, so that's fucking swannee
Maybe you can get a part time job in West End as a gentleman's fluffer
Or whatever the fuck they call it these days
Jamie is heading off
Well, you know -- better to go out with a bang
No, no
will not allow this to be a bang
This will be a whimper, a tiny pathetic whimper like a puppy being fucked by a big metal puppy-fucking machine
And they do exist, `cos my gran's got one
Jamie leaves
106
-                                 106 Malcolm and Linton enter
We see Simon's mints lying on the big stone in the middle of the room
So we're down to the wire here, Mr Miracle Worker, what have you got for me
What intel have you rustled us up
Honestly
haven't got it
We need more time
You haven't got it
Can you delay the vote to give you time to get it
No
've had the vote brought forward
Simon comes in to retrieve his mints
Just getting my mints
Page 106 106     :                                                106 am telling you to delay the vote and get me some new intel
Now
Okay, quick reality check,  Edgar Fucking Hoover
don't work for you
You don't tell me what to fucking do
Well firstly, don't raise your voice
This is a sacred space
You may not believe that,  may not believe that, but by God it's a useful hypocrisy
And secondarily you do work for me
Your prime minister instructed you to work for me
Malcolm glances at Simon
Get your Polos and fuck off
Simon stays where he is
Linton starts laughing
Toby enters, watches in amazement
The great Malcolm Tucker
One of your guys has leaked a paper, you can't do anything
We tell you to get intel, you can't do anything
need the vote put back - you can't do anything
You, sir, are a useless piece of `' star star `'
beat
(quietly, to Toby) What do you want
We've just heard -- the wall's starting to collapse
brick has fallen
That's the news 'm getting
More to follow
Both news and bricks
Linton laughs again
Why don't you deal with that Tucker wall is falling down, that's more your level
can see you with your shirt off and a wheelbarrow whistling a happy song
Linton walks out
Page 107 106     : (2)                                         106 You've been working for him
It's complicated, okay
've been juggling a number of responsibilities
Simon stares at Malcolm
He takes a mint and pops it in his mouth
Okay, well, right, after the vote, resign
Look
It's too late now
Resigning
It's not worth it
The horse has bolted
It's out there getting shot now
'll see you later, Malcolm
Simon exits
(to Toby) If you repeat this to anyone  will pull your leg off, break it in two and stab you to death with your broken shin bone
Now go away
Toby leaves
Malcolm sits down, head in his hands
107
-                             107 The delegates are still mingling
Toby is there now
Toby's phone goes
He answers
(into phone) Suzy, how's it going
Has Jamie been round
Right
Liza comes over
This is you, isn't it
(indicating himself) This is me, yes
And that's you thought we had this worked out
(into phone) ( ) Page 108 107     :                                                107 (') Sorry Suze 've got an incoming call, 'll ring back for a further bollocking
've got something big lined up and you better not have fucked it up for me
Liza leaves
(into phone) Hello
Oh hi, Paul
How's it going
No, yes,  know the wall is collapsing
'm as frustrated as you are mate
The Vice President starts to walk by
Toby sees him, wants to shake his hand
(') Look, could  call you back Paul
It's just the Vice President's
couldn't
No, okay, let's keep talking
The Vice President has gone
- 108                                                                  108 Michael and Suzy in Michael's office, classical music in the background
Michael's clearing his desk, putting stuff in boxes
Jamie bursts in on Michael and Suzy, his phone still on
Right, Frank and Nancy Sinatra
've got good news
You're not fired
That's great news, isn't it
That sounds ominous
He's fucking delighted
(cancels phone) We want to put Liza Weld's Pwip Pip out there, properly
In the public domain
We just have to refine it a bit
Refine it
Take out the cons, change the name of the main informant
That's a complete fabrication
Page 109 108     :                                                  108 Changing his name doesn't make a difference
The main source in there he's not really called Ice Man, is he
"Mr and Mrs Man, you've got a son, Ice
" So we change it, to another name
Who's the fuck with the fiddle
The Fiddlefuck
This is Debussy, if that's what you mean
Okay, we'll call him Debussy
No
And then you'll make a couple of other changes
It'll mean your fingerprints are on it, Mikey, but it's the only way to save your job, you leaky fuck
Michael is now scared of what he's being asked to do
It wasn't me, Jamie, alright
It wasn't me
Don't make me do this
Someone else must have come in and used the fax machine
What
Oh, that thing about your fax
Don't worry about that
made that up
The paper was sent by e-mail
It;s just, the fax machine was there and it;s easier to kick
Michael looks at Suzy
She doesn't know what to say or do
(') (grabbing Michael) Come on Deuce Bigalow
You're coming with me
He drags Michael out of the office

-                                            109 On the closed door of the Meditation Room
Malcolm suddenly bursts out, re-energised, ready for action
He's in the middle of a call
Page 110 109     :                                                109 Yeah,  newsdesk please
Malcolm Tucker
() Ben
Hi, how you doing
Yeah, well, 'm hearing you're preparing a story that we might not like
One of the doors he pushes open has a coffee machine in it
Toby is there getting a coffee
Malcolm gestures to him to come along
Toby joins Malc in his jog through the corridors, spilling his coffee on his hands as he goes and scalding himself
(') just want to say please, this garden wall story, please don't run with it
(beat, winks at Toby - you getting this
) Simon Foster's constituency-office wall
You've got that haven't you
haven't let the cat out of the bag
Shit
Look, my reputation will be in tatters if you run with
(to Toby) And he's gone
Boo hoo
've got a hard on
Can we stop running because my hands are really rather badly burned now
They stop
know it was you who leaked Linton's War Committee
Oh
Right
(tries it out for size) It wasn't
Are you telling me it wasn't you
Is that your proposition
Is that want you want to say if  ask them to fly you to Diego Garcia and slip a hood over your head and carry out a cavity search
(covering) don't actually recall
It was a busy time
That's more like it
So
you are now on probation
Okay
( ) Page 111 109     : (2)                                         109 (') am giving you a probationary period, which will last from today
until the end of recorded time
Okay
You're my guy now
own you now
You're my Kunte Kinte
Go and get your laptop
Toby goes
Malcolm pushes open another door
Sir Jonathan Tutt is in there
(') Ah, ambassador -- with your big baldy head you are spoiling us
Good, 've been looking for you
needed to tell you that by a huge personal effort -- huge -- have managed to bring the vote forward by an hour and a half
Great
need it delayed now
Very funny
That is funny
By an hour, at least
Although  guess two and a half hours now, as you've brought it forward
No, 'm sorry 'm very sorry but  won't humiliate myself again
You do what  say or you can go and see if Belize are looking for a new ambassador but with a broken nose, one bollock, and a half-chewed cock
110
-                                 110 Sir Jonathan walks in
lot of faces are turned towards him, expectantly
Right
What can  say
Page 112 111
111 Jamie has taken Michael into a tiny windowless office
Michael's hunched at his laptop, looking at the Pwip-Pip document on his computer
Jamie stands right over him, ominously
(to Michael re: the office) This is nice isn't it
Cosy
Away from prying eyes
So what's this, your political wet-room
Jamie's phone goes
112
/  -                           112 Toby is standing in front of Malcolm, holding his laptop up for Malcolm to look at and a physical copy of the red Pwip-Pip folder
He's also got the Pwip-Pip file on screen
Is it up, have you got it up
Yeah it's all fine
Okay, go to page nine, highlight that
(to Michael) Go to page nine
Michael does
Highlight from that page to the end of the document
Do you mean select
don't know  don't use these things
(to Michael) Select page nine to the end of the document
Page 113 112     :                                                112 The caveats
Michael does it
Is it highlighted
You mean selected, yeah it's selected
Okay, right, standby
delete
(to Michael) Delete
(subdued) You can't just delete the arguments against the war
Michael stops what he's doing
(to Toby) Messenger
Get Messenger up
Toby sticks Pwip-Pip in his mouth so he's got a hand free to initiate  messenger
Oh hang on Malc
Michael's stopped moving
think he's crashed
Malcolm types something on the laptop while Toby holds it up for him
Have you tried hitting him
Give him a thump, that usually works
Hang on,  think  might be able to use manual over-ride
Jamie picks up Michael's hand and pulls out his index finger and places it on the delete key
(') No, it's okay
It's working again
Great
Now attach that to email
Page 114 112     : (2)                                         112 (to Michael) Attach that to an email

The Japanese, they'll have one
They've got everything

Get me a blue folder
Where from
don't fucking know
Do  look like 've ever set foot in a stationary cupboard do my shagging in five star hotels
Now go and find me a blue fucking folder
Pronto
Toby runs off

He holds up his blue folder
The intelligence your guys couldn't find
think you owe me a massive, grovelling apology
What, you did your job
Eventually
Congratulations
Maybe they'll give you a knighthood

Welcome aboard Liza
By the way, congratulations on Pwip Pip
Excellent work
Really
don't know
haven't read it personally
No time
But it certainly raised your profile
No
That old thing
That was like a thousand years ago
More maybe
Terrific
(to the delegation) So, 'll keep this brief and   to the point
We go in, we make our   case using the new British intelligence   from their source `Debussy', we win the   argument, we get the hell out

The mood is sombre
(on screen) Resolution 5977 is passed
Judy looks at Malcolm
Malcolm looks straight ahead at the screen, nods, impassive
Yup
That's that then
"That's that then"
That's your quote for the ages is it

Job well done
Liza is there too

Chad is there too with General Miller
So,  emailed my resignation ten minutes ago
(to Miller) Yours should come right after the President's announcement, to have the biggest media impact

This has been the hardest fucking decision of my political life
'm not resigning
What the fuck George
Seriously
You said that the war was intolerable and we'd go together
It is - it is intolerable
still agree with myself about that
But 've got to tolerate it
My loyalty is with the kids
At the end of the day 'm a soldier
You're not a soldier
Look at the uniform, Karen
'm not a pastry chef
have military commendations on my chest, not a little fucking label saying My Name Is George
You're a politician
You live on canapes and white wine and you have three anecdotes you wheel out at every party and you scour the national papers for mentions of your name
You're a fucking politician
'm still a soldier
When was the last time you shot a guy
What, if  haven't shot a guy in 15 years then 'm not a soldier
City hall don't insist  bring along a fucking bullet- ridden corpse every five years to renew my soldier licence
You know this is an unnecessary war
It's a war you don't believe in
Show me some balls, George
know 've got balls,  don't need to show them to you
Page 118 119     : (2)                                         119 Oh sure, It just so happens they're sitting pretty in a pair of Egyptian cotton Ralph Lauren shorts on a Government salary
Don't talk about my fucking balls that way
My balls have been around
My balls have got balls
Come on Chad, let's leave the General and his over-stuffed scrotum
We're going to draft our resignation announcements
Karen turns away from him
Er,  might, stay with the General actually Karen, if that's okay
If he's staying  might stay with him and see what assistance  can furnish
Okay
General Shrek and his faithful talking donkey
She goes
This takes balls Karen
You've got balls Sir
Anyone can see you've got big balls
They're two-thirds of a snowman
Get the fuck away from me
Miller walks off
Okay
This was not the plan

No, you're right

That's the perfect word, Mr Michaelson
Your mother came up with it
Well congratulate her from me

He rings off, Malcolm catches up with him in the office Simon, look, mate
Listen to me
You still don't need to resign
No
'm going to resign, Malcolm
In a hour
You can't stop me now
Toby comes over
Boss
Yes
Yes
(') It's on the  News website -- Partial collapse of the wall
Mrs Michaelson's greenhouse has a smashed pane
The had a crew down there
God, and that's
Ridiculous, isn't it
It's nor Ridiculous
You're fired
What
The wall
It's just not tolerable
It's just a fucking wall
Look at this
(clicks his fingers at Toby) Give me the paper
(off Simon's look) He's my new boy
'm just breaking him in

Look at this
No one could survive this
The  is very clear on this - you're sacked, over the wall
No
Yes
You haven't even - spoken to the Prime Minister
Yes  have
You fucking haven't 've been right here
have spoken to the Prime Minister
Whether it has happened or not is irrelevant
It is true
As soon as heard about the wall,  spoke to him and he decided you had to go
'm not going quietly
Yeah well if you try to turn this into some anti-war protest, you can expect your `mountain of conflict' soundbite to be everywhere from ringtones to a fucking dance mix on YouTube

Toby goes to get his laptop

General
Look  realise this is a slightly strange time to say this, but just want to say how much  admire
Go fuck yoursefl, Frodo
Great
Lovely Toby hurries off looking crushed
Miller takes another drag on his cigarette

General Miller is sitting in on this meeting, looking slightly like a man who's being shafted up the ass and having to pretend to enjoy it
Okay,  don't want to be accused of micro managing but  personally do not see that ` heart Huckabees' should be on the list of dvds suitable for forces entertainment
That self-indulgent crap is not suitable entertainment for combat troops
And where's `United 93' on here
That should be playing 24/7
122                                                             122 Simon is back with Roz
Right, 've got a selection of quotes for you, they're all local firms and none of them is very well respected
(gets another piece of paper out) Now, this sceptic tank is also rearing it's pooy head again too
Simon looks zonked with boredom

123 Well Alan,  have been balled out by Linton for allowing  Heart Huckabees on to the troops  roster
You know the phrase, "'m too old for this shit
Well, 'm too young for this shit

In the background we see Toby getting the last of his things together
The   and her  arrive
They are almost carbon copies of Simon and Toby
Ah, here they are
Minister
Elizabeth
Welcome aboard
Thanks Malcolm
Looking forward to it
War seems to be going `great guns' at the moment
Ah, cheeky
Let me take you out for an expensive lunch, roast swan and all the trimmings, and 'll bring you up to speed on the whole Middle East situation
Are you twisting my arm already
Aye, but in a friendly, non-breaky way
Watch your step there
There's still blood on the deck
(to Judy) Hi 'm Danny
Dan
'm Elizabeth's chief advisor
Judy Molloy
Senior Press - Have  got a desk
Yes, it's that one there
