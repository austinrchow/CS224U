He dives behind a car
Then pops up and flashes
It's an all-out Pervert assault
The Pervert then runs across the parking lot, jumps a fence, and darts from the property -- vanishing as quickly as a Ninja who just perfectly executed an assassination
-   - , the Mall Manager, walks by a group of women, who were exposed to the Pervert
They crowd around and complain loudly
Ladies, please, we're doing everything we can to handle the situation
Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our shoppers
Now in the meantime, feel free to check out some of our wonderful back-to- school sales
Excuse me for a minute
Mark walks down the hallway that houses all of the business affair offices
He stops at the ' desk
Have you seen Ronnie
() 2
: haven't seen him all morning
The Mall Manager quickly walks off
On the way, he passes a
Ramon, have you seen Ronnie
No, senor
The Mall Manager keeps walking
- The Mall Manager comes into the surveillance room
It's a small office with monitors that show the different security cameras around the mall
, a Mall Security guard with sunglasses who will not utter a word ever, turns around in the chair
Where is Ronnie
Dennis shrugs
: - Blackness
White shafts of light sporadically shoot through the dark and we see is inserted into a
is inserted in the other side
- is turned on
is sparked
are pushed over the nose
garage door raises and bright light spills in
- garage door opens slowly and reveals a souped-up There's a siren on top that spins around
The man driving is   (28), a stocky mall security guard whose expression reads all business
Ronnie pulls out of the garage
: 3
- group of anarchist  rages through the mall parking lot tearing up everything they see
couple of them smoke cigarettes
One skater grinds over a bench
One kid ollies onto the hood of a car
Another slams into an old man and knocks him over
Meanwhile, Ronnie sits in his golf cart -- waiting
He looks eerily like Mel Gibson at the beginning of Mad Max
The skaters ride past a set of construction cones
One skater picks up the cone and tosses it across the parking lot
The skaters soar past Ronnie, who flips on the silent orange siren and gives chase
As the skaters ride through the parking lot, Ronnie pulls up and drives alongside of them
(cop authority voice) Pull over to the sidewalk,
, the leader of the skaters, yells back
Fuck off, Ronnie, it's just a parking lot
Sir, pull over to the sidewalk, , another skater, joins in
Leave us alone
Yeah, skating's not a crime, dick
Skateboarding is not allowed on mall premises
Pull over now
We're not leaving
Yeah, fuck you
The skateboarders flip Ronnie off and push hard to get away from him
Ronnie guns it and an all out chase ensues
() 4
: Ronnie pulls up alongside of a
Ronnie side- swipes the skater, forcing the skater to run into a trash can and fall
Ronnie catches up to
This time, Ronnie tries to hit the skater on the side again, but he is too fast
Ronnie swerves trying to get him, but he dodges and ducks
Ronnie hits the brake
The skater thinks he has escaped, but looks up and sees that a car is in his way
The skater nails the car and is thrown over the hood
Ronnie is back in the chase and only Hector and Stevie are left
Ronnie guns the golf cart and zooms up closely behind the two kids
Ronnie rams Hector over and over from behind
Hector wobbles
Ronnie rams him again
Hector goes swerving off and falls down hard
Ronnie doesn't break his pace and guns it toward Stevie
Stevie is good
He turns and rides through cars, ollies over parking blocks, and through pedestrians
Ronnie burns down the lane beside him
Stevie looks behind and Ronnie is nowhere in sight
He's in the clear
Stevie turns back around and sees Ronnie, driving in reverse straight towards him
Ronnie rams into the skater and knocks the poor kid on his ass
What the fuck are you doing
was driving in reverse and trying to get you to flip into the back seat
What
That way  could handcuff you smoothly and take you in
You know, never mind, just get in the goddamn golf cart
Stevie picks himself up slowly and hobbles toward the golf cart

-   - Ronnie is in the room with the monitors
The skaters sit across from him
There's a poster on the wall with the security guard motto:
Ronnie fiddles with his walkie-talkie
It seems like we go through this every day
What's it going to take for you all to realize that won't tolerate this horseplay and just do whatever you want to and don't worry about the rules attitude
Ronnie,  hear what you're saying and  just want you to know that personally, it pains me to see you all worked up and  just want you to know that 'm really sorry because you can't do shit and you can take your little rules and stick'em up your ass, you fuckin' rent-a-cop
The Skaters all start cracking up
Yeah, suck my dick
The Skaters start laughing louder
That's funny, guys
try to be a mentor to the youth, but it seems like you boys have gone straight past boydom to the land of street- hardened criminals
'm left with no choice
You call me rent-a- cop, but  call myself the law's right hand
see the crime
and  phone it in
And that's what 'm getting ready to do right now
Ronnie picks up the walkie-talkie and turns it on
He speaks into it
(into walkie) 317, this is Ronnie Barnhardt over at Carolina Mall
Come in, over
() 6
: (
) This is Officer Douglas, what do you wish to report
Over
(into walkie) 've got a couple of trespassers who have been found skateboarding on mall property
Can you send a black and white over to take these boys into processing
Over
Ronnie winks at the Skaters
(
) Uh
Yeah, Ronnie, we're kind of busy today
mean, we got like three car accidents
Ronnie picks up the walkie and whispers into it
(into walkie) What do you mean
've got these guys red-handed
'm gonna need a car over here pronto
can't hold them all day by myself
Over
(
) Copy
Yeah, like  said, we're awfully busy right now
think you should probably just make'em promise not to do it again and threaten to call their parents or something
That'll get them
Over
The Skaters start laughing
(into walkie) Sir,  don't think you understand, their parents don't care about them
This is a 911 from one of your soldiers
Officer needs assistance
Over
(
) Yeah, it's not gonna happen
The  fades as Ronnie turns off the Walkie
() 7
: So as you can see, the law is just one little call away
But 'm gonna choose not to use that tactic today
'm gonna do something that  like to do from time to time, and that's called handle shit myself
Ronnie takes his pad out of his pocket
He begins writing
While  won't have you arrested today,  am going to suspend each of you for one week
For those of you who don't know how this works, here it is
This is official documentation
If you step foot on mall property, it is considered trespassing
At that point, call the police, they come down, you go directly to jail
Ronnie fills out the paperwork, sets the suspension notes on the table
Stevie looks down at it
He picks it up, reads it, balls it up, and throws it at Ronnie
The Skaters start cracking up
You accepted it originally, so it still counts
Ronnie sits there while the Skaters laugh
-   - Ronnie sits at a table with a Cinnabon in front of him
Across the table sits , a chubby but cute girl, who wears a Cinnabon uniform
The couple holds hands and they have their heads bowed
Dear Lord, bless this food that we eat and purify it with Your salvation
Also, please keep Ronnie safe as he works in Your name to protect the customers and employees and store owners of the mall
() () 8
: (') And please turn your wrath on any sinners that try to hurt him and make them pay by burning in the eternal flames of hell
In Christ's name we pray, amen
Amen
Ronnie begins devouring his Cinnabon
So what's on the agenda for you today
You know, the usual
Spot crime before it happens, perform random acts of bravery, save people from certain death, yada yada yada
What's wrong, Ronnie
Nothing, Nell
Ronnie,  know that you really want to be a Police Officer, but you have to realize that things work out the way they're meant to
know
'm okay, Nell
Thanks, but really,  mean, 'm on the front lines right now
'm livin' it
Your job is definitely more exciting than mine
Of course it is, but at least you don't have to wrestle with the demons at night
better get going
'll see you after work, sweetie
Nell leans in to kiss Ronnie, but he pulls away
() 9
: Not at work, Nell
We have to keep up appearances, we talked about this
And don't call me sweetie
'm sorry
'll see you after work, Officer Barnhardt
'Bye, Nell
Ronnie stands up and walks off
- Ronnie stands in the middle of the mall and supervises the early morning   as they stride around the outer marked lane
It's all senior citizens
Slow it down
Watch your speed there
This ain't a race
Hey, second time, slow it down
Mark, the Mall Manager, walks up to Ronnie
've been looking all over for you
haven't been hiding, but some things that  have to do are better to keep hidden from you and 'official' eyes
Trust me, it's best all around if there are no bodies to clean up
So you may or may not have heard, but this morning, several women were assaulted just outside the front doors by a crazy Pervert
For the love of God
know, it's horrible
() 10
: You want me to phone this one in to the police
Not just yet
See if we call the police, they'll be a big scandal and something like that could kill what little traffic we have at this mall
What  need you to do is watch out for this Pervert and if you see him, try to stop him or quietly phone it in so we can handle this discreetly
Hold on, Mark
Let me make sure understand you
You're telling me to deny my primary objective of Observing and Reporting crime and at the same time, you're giving me authorization to handle this case on my own
'm just saying keep an eye out and keep quiet
So basically, 'm in charge of this whole investigation
There's no investigation
Not yet
Okay, Mark, 'll do it, but 'm gonna need a few things first
You can't carry a gun
Well, 'm gonna need a new title
Something to instill fear in the criminal mind
How about Director of Mall Intelligence
Head of Mall Security
That's perfect
() 11
: And it doesn't come with a raise
Got it
And the new title stays between us
Understood
Thank you for this opportunity, Mark
won't let you down
: - Ronnie stands in front of a Cadillac with a boot on one of his tires
local news camera crew comes up to Ronnie and the starts asking questions
Excuse me, sir, but we would like to ask you a few questions
'm sorry, but  can't answer anything
We heard a report that an unidentified man was spotted earlier today exposing himself to several women
Do you care to comment
'm not allowed to comment on that situation
So you admit there is a situation
'm trained to resist torture for up to 72 hours, you really expect me to break now
Get real, lady
() 12
: (to her camera crew) We're wasting our time here
Let's go find some police to interview
Good luck
What's that supposed to mean
It just means you won't find any police
Are you telling me the police haven't even been called
() Ewww, alert the media
Jesus, well who'd they leave in charge, you
Ronnie smiles like he knows a secret
Yeah, right
Why would they leave you in charge
First of all, if there was a situation to be handled,  don't see why you find it so goddamn ridiculous that  would be in charge
The Reporter waves for her crew to start filming
(setting a trap) Look, there is no way you're in charge of this investigation
Well for your information, 'm in charge of this whole fucking operation
() () 13
: (') don't give a goddamn if you believe me or not, Ms
Hot Fuckin' news lady
'm the first line of defense against this pervert
As the law's right hand, 'm here so that people like you can live in your own little happy world and think places like this mall are safe and fun
'm the defender of this war zone
Just me and my goddamn flashlight
Just then, , an angry Middle Easterner with shitloads of cell phones and beepers strapped to him, comes running up to Ronnie
You motherfucker, you put a boot on my car
(cop voice) warned you about parking in the fire lane, Saddamn
Fuck you, Ronnie
Take that goddamn boot off of my car
(going into cop ) Step away now
pay good money to this mall
Don't tell me where to park
Sir,  will be forced to take action if you do not step back
'm gonna kill you
Ronnie pulls out his taser and shoots Saddamn
Saddamn goes down hard and begins twitching
He is fucking out of it
Ronnie goes back to giving the interview as if nothing happened
() 14
: As  was saying, the pervert situation here is real bleak
For all you people out there thinking of coming to the mall, please for your own safety, stay away
(still fucked up) can't believe you tased me
(to the man) That's right and 've got another one waiting right here for you
: - , the make-up counter girl, globs on tons of make- up
She's a hot girl who looks like she's spent a few sticky nights in the bed of a truck
Ronnie stands back and watches Brandi
Finally, he walks up to her
Hey, Brandi
Brandi looks up from her mirror and then goes back to applying make-up
That color looks great on your skin
Not just that color, but 've noticed that all make-up looks really good on you
Especially the blue around your eyes
bet it drives the men crazy
Brandi glares at Ronnie
It's okay
can say that because 'm taken
What do you want, Ronnie
() 15
: 'm here on official business
See,  don't know if you know this, but  have recently been made Head of Mall Security
Did you hear about that
No
Well, 'm sure you will
It's actually pretty huge news
But the reason  stopped by is to tell you that it looks like we've got a pervert on the loose
real live psychopath who gains sexual gratification by exposing himself to ladies such as yourself just want to warn you to be careful when coming and going to work
Okay, got it
And you may not want to wear any of those skirts that you like to wear
What skirts
You know what skirts
Something like that could set him off
And for that matter, you better not wear any of those little low-cut top things either, okay
Especially with those black bras because, you can really see them in the light
Perverts really tend to notice stuff like that
Okay, see you later
Ronnie takes off and leaves Brandi still applying make- up
- The lights are turned off and the mall is empty
Ronnie walks out with Dennis
() 16
: Dennis, man, 'm glad we've got a minute to talk
There's no easy way to say this so 'm just going to come right out with it
Mark offered me the position of Head of Mall Security
know this isn't easy for you to hear seeing as you've been here longer than me
But  want you to know that you're my best friend and 'm only going to accept the job if you're okay with that
Dennis shrugs
Well, you should know 've already accepted and it's too late to turn it down now
Every ship needs a captain
So you were passed over
Who gives a shit
Dennis, in time, you'll come to accept answering to me
Remember, there aren't any leaders in friendship
We cool
Dennis and Ronnie shake hands
They walk out and lock the doors behind them
Hey, you want to go and grab a beer or something
Dennis doesn't say anything and just walks to his car
Ronnie follows
Yeah, you're right
You're probably in no mood to party after that news
Well, try not to take it too hard
See you later, buddy
Ronnie leaves Dennis and walks to his car
- Ronnie's home is a shitty double-wide at the very end of the shittiest trailer park in town
17
'  - Ronnie lives in a boy's room
There's all kind of posters up with instructions on how to execute choke holds, wrist locks, and other assorted death blows
However, the biggest decoration is a large diagram of the mall
Ronnie stands in the middle of his room with his across from him
She's an old, thick boozer, with the strength of a father and the love of a mother
She downs a full beer and throws it against the wall
You think you're ready for a shot at the title, motherfucker
'm ready, Mom
Ding ding
Ronnie and his Mom take to fighting
Ronnie's Mom is surprisingly good and she lands the first blows to Ronnie's cranium
Ow
What's wrong, baby
Is your pussy hurting
Fuck you
Ronnie attacks his Mom
He manages to scoop her and body slam her to the ground
Ronnie's Mom flips out of it on the ground
However, Ronnie holds onto her wrist and stands up, thus locking in the submission hold
Ah
You give
Fuck you
Ronnie flips the wrist lock tighter
Ow
() 18
: You move with me, you go down
You move against me and your arm breaks
give
What's that
give
Let me go, goddamn it
Ronnie lets his Mom go
She shakes off the pain
can't believe you got that lucky shit on me
Luck has nothing to do with it
You almost broke my arm
'm sorry, Mom
Are you okay
Not really
Ronnie's Mom rubs her arm
Ronnie drops his guard and comes over to tend to his Mom's wounds
However, she's only playing possum
Ronnie's Mom sees an opening and attacks Ronnie at his legs
Ronnie goes down and the two start wrestling again
(: This plays as realistic as possible, no phony punches or smooth/comedy fighting, it looks like a school yard fight video
Sloppy and real
) : '  - Ronnie is laying in bed while his Mom chugs another beer beside him
She's one-eye-closed punch-me-in-the-face drunk
They're watching Ronnie on the news from earlier
: Ronnie talks into microphone
() 19
: (
) Yeah, well for your information, 'm in charge of this whole operation
don't give a  if you believe me or not, Ms
Hot news lady
Do you see anybody else
no you don't
As the law's right hand, 'm the first line of defense against this pervert
'm here so that people like you can live in your own little happy world and think places like this mall are safe and fun
'm the defender of this war zone
Just me and my flashlight
The   addresses the camera over (
) No comment as to why steps are not being taken, but this Security Guard feels like he is the only one doing anything to protect the people who visit Carolina Mall from the suspect
For all of us, hope this isn't the case
Back to you, Lindsay
Ronnie turns off the television
(drunken slur) 'm so proud of you, Ronnie
Do you think  did good
Hell yes
You were great
Ah, you're just drunk
Nah, you did good
Yeah,  usually don't come out to the forefront like that
() () 20
: (') My official orders are Observe and Report, but when Mark put me in charge of mall security, something inside of me changed
It's what 've always wanted
Things haven't always worked out, with the whole
well, you know
But this gives me faith that  can do something great
This is my call to duty and 'm going to answer
'm going to bust this fucking pervert
swear it on everything am
Anyway,  better get to sleep
got a big day tomorrow
Good night, Mom
(off no answer) Mom
On cue, Ronnie's Mom falls over in a drunken sleep
She starts  loud as hell
Ronnie gets out of the covers and helps his Mom onto the bed
Ronnie tucks her in like a loving son
He pries the bottle from her fingers
Then, he grabs a pillow and goes to sleep on the floor
- '' - Ronnie walks up to 'Charley's
It's the one-step-up restaurant that's in the mall
There's a  out front who watches over the store
You working the door here
That's what they tell me
They needed to hire a little security here in case the drunks get out of line or whatever
Kind of funny they thought they needed more security here
Ha
You do realize that if anyone gets out of hand, you need to call me to handle the situation
work for 'Charley's, not for the mall
() 21
: Granted, but you realize that my jurisdiction supersedes any and all other forms of security when under the roof of Carolina Mall
You know,  thought about getting a job as a Mall Security
You did
Yeah, man
mean, 'm kind of on extended vacation from college and it's just like,  don't want to do shit, you know what  mean
My parents said  have to work if want to live at home, but  just don't feel like doing anything
This was the easiest job  could find,  mean, what the hell could be hard about being a bouncer in a mall restaurant
But now that think about it, Mall Security could be easier than this
My young friend, you are sorely mistaken
Do you know how much stuff 'm in charge of
No
shitload
That's not even counting the parking lot
Really
thought you just kind of chilled out and called stuff into the police
No way, that's about like 75, maybe 82 percent of it
There's so much other stuff
Like what
() 22
: Two words, Friday Night
What about it
It's crazy, let's just leave it at that
Okay
Listen
like you, but  don't like the fact that you're masquerading as an official in the security world
If you're serious about a career in the security world, then perhaps  could look into getting you a job on my staff
Oh yeah
Part of my job is reaching out to troubled youths such as yourself
It's who  am
Does it pay more than $6
50 an hour
Ronnie laughs
He leans over to the Bouncer and whispers in his ear
() Seven even
Ronnie stands back and winks at the Bouncer
'd say that's more than 'm making now
Hold on, this job involves a probationary period
You have to prove yourself worthy
We can't just hire any old Tom, Dick, or Harry just because they want to carry a flashlight
() 23
: What do  have to do
You have to complete a term as deputy
You will answer directly to me
Your job will be to come and find me if you see any trouble
If this works out, then will phone the crime into the police
Now, this will train your eyes to spot various criminal activity
Once you have completed your training, you will be awarded an official position on my security staff where you will have the duty of actually phoning in crimes to the police yourself
So basically,  just do what 'm doing now and then you'll get me a job
For starters
How long does this mentorship last
Until Mark lets me hire another guy
Can  smoke while  work
Yes, you can
Sign me up
You keep that attitude up and you'll have no problem making the squad
Ronnie reaches into his pocket and hands the Bouncer a mini flashlight
What's this
() 24
: It's a flashlight
Get to know it
It's your new best friend
Until you get your giant flashlight
Then, that will be your new best friend
The Bouncer takes it and puts it into his shirt pocket
Okay, look alive, soldier
Deputy time starts now
No more slacker attitude for you
Ronnie walks away, but after he takes a few steps, he stops and turns
You know,  remember when  got my first flashlight
Ronnie goes into an emotional memory in his mind
Ronnie walks away leaving the Bouncer there alone
- tricked-out Toyota pulls up to the parking lot
The car comes to a stop and out steps Brandi, the makeup counter girl
Brandi walks toward the mall to start her new day
As she crosses the parking lot and heads toward the door, the Pervert pops out
This time, he's upped his attack and beats off staring right at her
The horrendous sight stops Brandi dead in her tracks
She  bloody murder
: - It looks like a
Brandi cries in the makeup chair and is surrounded by a large group of mall employees
Her makeup runs down her face as her effeminate coworker  consoles her
Mark is working crowd control
() 25
: (to the crowd) Alright, people, she's doing good
We're just gonna get her down to my office and everything's going to be fine, so the best thing for you employees to do is just get on back to your stations and you customers can go ahead and enjoy the back to school savings here at Carolina Mall
It was horrible
Oh, my God, the thought of that disgusting -- think 'm going to be sick
Just let it out, baby
He should be ashamed
just keep playing it over and over again in my head
Brandi, please, Dennis has called the police and let's just take this down to my office
The    comes running over
What's going on
Pervert attacked Brandi is what's going on
Are you okay, Brandi
Physically, yes
But psychologically, no
Brandi starts crying hard
The Department Store Manager pulls Mark aside
() Did you call the cops
() 26
: They're on the way
Brandi starts crying even louder
Yeah, we got to get her the fuck out of here
Everybody's standing around and nobody's shopping
This is bad for business
'm trying, but she just keeps crying
Ronnie comes running up on the scene
He looks like a man who ran a mile to get here
Brandi
came as soon as heard
Jesus, are you alright
'm fine, Ronnie
She's fine, Ronnie
This is one of the most heinous things 've seen
Jesus,  tried to tell you about the skirts
It's not your fault, you little fighter you
Ronnie's not mad, okay
Ronnie, can you get her down to my office so the Police can talk to her in private when they arrive
Rogers
can't walk right now
feel like 'm in shock
Don't worry
'll carry you
Ronnie reaches down and picks up Brandi
She totally lets him
Ronnie struggles and can't lift her
It looks dumb
() 27
: Oh, fucking Jesus
Ronnie finally manages to lift Brandi
He carries her out of the Department Store and down through the middle of the mall
- black    pulls up quickly and stops directly in front of the Main Entrance to the mall as if to say to the world, "'m a Cop and  can do this
" Out steps  , a young cop that has the arrogance and swagger of a man who is just beginning to feel his power
'  - Mark sits at his desk, while Ronnie comforts a crying Brandi
Dennis stands in the corner, not saying a word
Detective Harrison knocks as he comes in the door
Your secretary told me to come on in
'm Detective Harrison, Cabarrus County Police
Detective Harrison shows his badge to Mark
The two men shake
Mark Talbert,  manage the mall
This is Brandi, she's the one who saw the deviant
Hello, Brandi
Are you doing okay
'm really shaken up
Yes, ma'am, 'm sure you are after all you've been through, but 'm here to tell you that we're going to work together to make sure we catch the person who did this
() 28
: My name is Ronnie Barnhardt, chief inspector on the case and head of Mall Security here at Carolina Mall and this is my lieutenant, Dennis
From one law enforcement officer to another,  just want to welcome you and say that we will do whatever it takes to coordinate with your department in order to bring this assailant to justice
The Detective pauses as if he's unsure what just happened
Great
(back to Brandi) Okay, Brandi
Did you get a look at the suspect
Yes,  did
Did you get a blood sample
No
That's a shame
Would have been useful
Go ahead, Detective
Thank you
Brandi, can you remember anything specifically
What color was his hair
Was he tall or short
He was tall and skinny and he had brown hair and it was real greasy
Detective Harrison begins writing in his note pad as Brandi speaks
Ronnie notices this and picks up some paper and begins to write as well
Was his hair long or short
() 29
: It was long about to his shoulders
Did he say anything
No, he just stood there and you know, touched himself
What was he wearing
Just a brown trench coat
This is what  got so far
Ronnie holds up his paper
Ronnie has drawn a crude sketch of the Pervert that Brandi described, but it's basically a long-haired stick figure with a penis
What's yours look like
just wrote a description
Oh
Ronnie puts his sketch away
Okay, Brandi,  think that's good for now
think the best thing at this point is to just follow up with the other ladies who saw the perpetrator yesterday and see if they remember anything
What if he comes back
That's highly unlikely
These incidents are usually random and unpredictable
'm sure you'll be safe
() 30
: 'm afraid 'm going to have to disagree with you there, Detective
By my math, it seems pretty clear that Brandi's been targeted
Targeted
What gives you that impression
Well, how about the fact that she was the first employee to get assaulted
Not to mention the fact that she is the prettiest girl who works at this mall
To me it seems obvious that this is some sort of methodical villain that plans on returning to finish what he started by murdering Brandi
Is that going to happen
That's not going to happen
Ronnie looks at Brandi and nods his head "yes
" Well don't worry
'm on the case and 'm going to do everything in my power to bring this guy down
That's right, Brandi, you've got the best team in law enforcement working for you
Look, 've got to get going
Here's my card
'll even write my home phone number on the back, just in the event you need to get a hold of me
Detective Harrison writes his number on the back and then hands his card to Brandi
() 31
: Give me a call when you aren't working and 'll have you come to the station to look through some mug shots
(touches her leg) Don't worry okay
feel a lot better now
Ronnie holds out his hand
What
'll take one of those cards as well
Oh, okay
Detective Harrison reluctantly hands Ronnie a card
Go ahead and write your home phone on there as well in case  need to get a hold of you
You can just leave a message at the station
check my messages constantly
Sorry, but 'm gonna need those digits
If we're gonna solve this crime we need to constantly be in communication with each other and have an open door policy with intelligence
Brandi, let me see that card
Ronnie takes the car from Brandi and copies the home phone number from the back
Cool, 'll call you later with an update
Don't do that
() 32
: It's no problem at all
We're brothers of the badge
This is what we do for each other
Detective Harrison takes off
Ronnie looks around happily
Seems like a good guy
little green, but still solid
- The mall is winding down for the day and most of the customers have gone home
Ronnie walks through the mall, taping up pictures of the sketch he made of the Pervert
Nell comes walking up with her apron over her shoulder
What are you doing
Just putting these posters up
You've been so obsessed with catching this pervert 've barely seen you
That's what it's like when you date the Head of Mall Security
The downside is we don't get to see each other as much, but the upside is you get to brag to all your friends
Well, are you ready to go
Sure, let's take off
'   - The   is on and they show an update on the The sound is
() 33
: The living room is dark
Ronnie and Nell are on the couch making out
Ronnie is starting to get frisky
His hands go to Nell's boobs, but only outside of the shirt
She allows it
Ronnie decides to push it
He takes his hand and tries to go up her shirt
Nell immediately stops kissing and pushes Ronnie away
What are you doing, Ronnie
Come on, let me get some of those big bazoombas
Ronnie goes in hard for the tits, but Nell pushes him away
Ronnie, no
Goddamn it, are we ever gonna do it
You know we talked about this
We did, it's just, well, 'm tired of just doing what we do
'm ready for something bigger
Like sex or just maybe using a finger on you -- Ronnie, you know 'm saving myself for marriage
thought you were okay with that
Well,  used to be, it's just don't know
What's so great about being a 27-year-old virgin
Nell stands up and starts to put on her coat
Ronnie stands up and tries to comfort her
Nell, 'm sorry
Don't go away like this
() 34
: thought you loved my purity
do
really do
'm sorry, Nell
It's okay
should leave anyway, it's late
'll stop by for breakfast tomorrow
See ya tomorrow
Nell leaves and Ronnie closes the door behind her
Mom, wake up
Let's go to bed
Ronnie's mom groans
She has been passed out on the floor with an empty bottle of Jack  beside her the whole time
- The lights are off and a gloved hand breaks into a case in the jewelry store
All of the diamonds and gold are picked up and pocketed
Someone is robbing this bitch
: - Ronnie strolls through the mall sipping on his morning coffee
He stops when he sees that the jewelry store has been broken into and robbed
Oh shit
Ronnie goes running down through the mall
-   - Dennis and Ronnie are sitting and Mark stands over them
They're looking at the security tapes
() 35
: Detective Harrison knocks on the door and walks in
Ronnie stands up to greet him
Good to see you, brother
Looks like the old team is getting together to crack one more case
Ronnie gives Detective Harrison a hug
'm ready to go to war with you
Thanks for waking me up this morning, Ronnie
've already checked the Security tapes
They didn't catch a thing
Someone must have broken in here and turned them off
My team just checked all the doors and there are no signs of forced entry
've also checked out the crime scene, but we didn't see any fingerprints on the glass
The suspect was probably wearing gloves
That doesn't sound good
How did they do it
Laser technology
My guess it was an inside job
Probably someone who has access to keys like a janitor or a security guard
Detective Harrison, can  ask you how long you've been a detective for
'm almost at the end of my first year
() 36
: Just as  thought, a rookie
've been a police officer for several years
Yeah, you're a rookie, okay
It's fine, you'll learn with experience
And when you do, you'll discover that rule #1 of law enforcement is that you don't ever turn on a fellow officer
Now,  know you would never actually accuse somebody on my Security Force of committing this act of lawlessness
Whoever did this would have to had keys to the Security Room so they could shut off the camera
Look, my record speaks for itself and as for Dennis, well  can certainly vouch for him
Dennis is one of the finest men  know, so just take my word, you're barking up the wrong tree
Now, let's put this little squabble behind us and get back to busting the guys that robbed this mall
Ronnie, nobody is accusing anybody, but  would like to stick around for a while and interview some of the employees
Okay, but all  ask is that you do it quietly, so that the hoopla is kept to a minimum
understand
understand too, sir
() 37
: Ronnie, you are to leave Detective Harrison alone and let him handle the investigation
No can do, Mark
When you appointed me Head of Mall Security,  swore an oath to protect this mall and aid in bringing crime to its knees
You didn't swear an oath
To myself  did
Ronnie, on these types of investigations, it's usually not a good idea to have too many cooks in the kitchen
There's only one cook
'm a chef
cook and chef, together, serving up justice
'm gonna do this alone
Hot plates of justice
Ronnie stands up
Come on, rookie
Let me show you the lay of the land
: - Ronnie talks to Dennis in the middle of the mall
Okay, Dennis
've gotta hang with Detective Harrison
() () 38
: (') What  need for you to understand is that just because Detective Harrison is here, doesn't mean that you and me are no longer best friends
Sure, Harrison would be cool to hang out with
He carries a badge and a gun
He probably owns a boat
Over time, we'll probably become really close like brothers, but for right now, you're still number one
Now, must leave you behind because duty calls, so
chin up
Radio if you need anything
Ronnie takes off, but we   Dennis
He walks directly to the
Dennis puts a quarter in the machine and plays pinball
-  - Ronnie watches from afar as Detective Harrison interviews , who stands in front of his cell phone kiosk
So, have you seen any suspicious people hanging around the mall
Anybody who might have been casing the stores
Nah, man
ain't seen nothing
Okay, well if you can think of anything, here's my card
Detective Harrison hands Saddamn his card and begins to leave
Disgusted, Ronnie comes walking up
(to Harrison) My turn, Rookie
What are you doing, Ronnie
Solving the whole case right before your eyes
() 39
: Ronnie, this is official police business
Hello, Saddamn
What the fuck you want, Ronnie
want your ass to face the music is what  want
Don't come any further, bitch
The restraining order says 20 feet so just back the fuck up
Ronnie,  appreciate your enthusiasm, but just let me handle this
(to Saddamn) Have a good day, sir
So you're just gonna let him slip right through your fingers
have no reason to make him a suspect
No reason
Look at him
There's every reason in the goddamn book
Why are you saying that, man
think it's obvious, Saddamn
That's fucked up
You're racist, man
You're not even black
() 40
: Ronnie, stop
We're finished here
Now if you're going to tag along, 'm gonna need you to just stay back; are we clear
Sure, sorry
We're crystal
Detective Harrison walks away
Ronnie follows, but takes one more look at Saddamn, who flips Ronnie off
Saddamn goes back to hollering at girls
What's up, girl, you got a boyfriend
Free cell phones with a month trial and  throw in my phone number for free
- '  - Ronnie stands nearby as Detective Harrison questions an old Mexican , who stands by his cart of cleaning products
Did you let anybody borrow your keys
No, senor
Have you seen anything suspicious
No, senor
Okay, sir
Thank you for your time
Alright,  believe  can be of some assistance here
Ronnie, we talked about this
This is a special circumstance
() 41
: What special circumstance
Communication skills, watch and learn
Ronnie steps into the forefront
Que pasa
Long drawn out conversation in Spanish
Como
More Spanish dialogue
Si
(to Harrison) Yeah, this guy definitely did it
What did he say
don't know,  don't speak Spanish, but judging from his tonal inflections, it's safe to say that he's hiding something
The only question is where
(to Janitor) Okay, Ramon, 'm giving you one chance and one chance only to come clean
Or else Detective Harrison is going to come over to your house and deport your whole family back to Mexico
No, 'm not
Good cop, bad cop, just play along
(to Ramon) Where are you hiding the jewels
() 42
: No se
Alright, you're gonna make me be the bad guy here
Well, that's a role 'm comfortable playing
Let's just see what you're hiding
Ronnie digs through the trash bin that is on the cart
Ronnie slings trash out all over the floor
He finds nothing
Ronnie, that's enough
Think you're pretty slick, don't you
Guess what
'm pretty slick too
Ronnie takes the cleaning products and opens the bottles
He pours the contents out on the floor
What's he looking for
Who knows
Alright, you're free -- Wait a minute
Ronnie takes the mop and breaks it in half with his foot
He takes the halves and shakes them, thinking that something will come pouring out of the open cylinders
Nothing does
Okay, my mistake
Sir, you're free to go
Uh, you might want to have someone clean this up which in this case is you, so, uh, chop- chop
Wouldn't want anyone to slip on this mess
Ronnie leaves the Janitor with a bewildered look
-   - Ronnie follows Detective Harrison into the lingerie store
They approach the counter where a   is working the register
Hello, can  help you
() 43
: 'm Detective Harrison with the Cabarrus County Police
And 'm Ronnie Barnhardt, head of Mall Security
Okay, seriously, would you back the fuck off
'm trying to do my job and you're fucking it up
Come on, we're working here
'm working
Detective Harrison is seriously annoyed
(back to the Clerk) Sorry
Hi
'm doing a check with all the mall employees to see if anybody has any information on the robbery that took place here last night
'm sorry, but  haven't noticed anything out of ordinary
comes up to them holding a scandalous pair of undies
Tracy, do you think my boyfriend would like these
The Sexy Worker holds the undies up to her crotch
Ronnie looks and his tongue almost drops out of his mouth
He straightens himself out
That's fine, thanks for the help
You're gonna let them distract you with a little bit of panty showing
You have got a lot to learn, my friend
(to the Hot Clerk) Who are you protecting, toots
() 44
: What are you talking about
Look, 'm sure you and your little friend have made a real lifestyle for yourselves here
It's probably easy for you to blind most men with your beauty, but 'm not most men
can see through the sexuality to the truth
Jewelry, gold, diamonds, you don't really expect me to think that a man wants that crap
'm putting you on my list of top suspects don't think you did the crime, but do think you are an accomplice
'm sorry, ma'am
He's not with me
Here's my card
If you think of anything, just give me a call
Detective Harrison walks out and Ronnie follows him
On the way out of the store, Ronnie passes a  who is looking at the underwear
Ronnie stops
You should be ashamed of yourself
Ronnie gives him a warning look, then walks out
-   - Ronnie and Detective Harrison stand across the counter from a tattooed
Is that pot  smell
Shut up, Ronnie
It's sage
Whatever, hippy
If  find you doing drugs or killing cats or whatever you devil worshippers do, 'll come back here and bust you
swear to God
() 45
: Get the hell out, Ronnie
'm here to ask questions about the robbery
Just forget that, we're on to something bigger here
(back to the ) Tell me more about this 'sage
' : -  - Ronnie and Detective Harrison are in the hardware department talking to the
Detective Harrison sits on the ground
He has completely given up on the investigation at this point, as Ronnie controls it all
Ronnie picks up a hammer
Now, maybe 'm crazy or maybe 'm the smartest man alive, but it seems kind of convenient to me that you sell hammers like this one that could easily be used to smash a glass case in, oh say, a jewelry store
Couldn't you smash the glass with anything
You really think you're gonna talk your way out of this one
: -   - Ronnie is hanging out with Dennis and the Bouncer from 'Charley's
Behind him, Nell works the counter at Cinnabon
() 46
: You guys should have been there today
We were just solving shit left and right
mean, that's what this job is supposed to be like
Busting loiterers and kids who steal pennies from the fountain has its rewards, but really getting in there and closing cases is where it's at
It's rewarding too because at the end of the day, you know you've done something good for the world
What are we doing here, Ronnie thought you said they were giving away free Chick-fil- sandwiches
Well -- What is your name anyway
Charles
Well, my young apprentice called you here today because as Head of Mall Security,  have decided that it's time to take protection to the next level
In other words,  alone cannot combat this recent crime wave
In order to help me in my personal journey, have decided to divide up the tasks between my soldiers
So, for now on, Dennis, my right-hand man, you will be in charge of solving the case of who is robbing the mall
Little Chucky, you will be on the case of the Pervert
You are both to collect data and provide it to me
will analyze the data, draw conclusions, and solve these crimes as well as coordinate and strategize with various law enforcement agencies
Since we're going to be doing a lot of the work and you're going to be solving the crimes, do we at least get paid
() 47
: You can't measure honor in dollars and cents
Ronnie looks over at the Cinnabon and Nell waves to him
Ronnie smiles back and waves at Nell
Is that your girlfriend or something, Ronnie
Who me
Nah, man
Why
What do you think of her
She's not my type, but that's just me
Yeah, but, you don't think she's kind of hot
Are you blind
Give me a break
Wait, are you sure she's not your girlfriend
Fuck no
There's no way 'd date that
person who's obviously not hot
Nell waves again, but Ronnie just kind of turns away, ignoring her
Anyway, our new unit will operate under the name, 'Special Elite Task Force
' You will answer directly to me and no one else
Now, let's all put our hands in the middle and do a unifying cheer
Ronnie puts his hand out
Dennis puts his in as well
Charles isn't sure
You're gonna hook me up with a job, right
Seven even
promise
() 48
: Charles puts his hand in as well
One, two, three,
Ronnie is the only one who gets into it
It's a weak-ass cheer
Okay, so now  say we all take a celebratory trip to Sears because, as we all know, today is half- price day on all automotive parts for mall employees
: - -
The "Elite Task Force" walks down the mall as if they were the baddest ass-kicking team on the planet
They walk united and unopposed
: - Ronnie tacks up pictures of all of the      robbery "suspects" on a bulletin board
It's pictures of       Saddamn and the Devil Worshipper guy
Beside him is a       sketch of the Pervert
The images are on the bottom       points of a Pyramid
On top of the Pyramid is a combination drawing/picture of Ronnie
The body is drawn with his arms folded across his chest and a photo of his face is tacked on top
The whole thing adds up to nonsense, with the only clear idea is that he defeats them all
Ronnie sits back in his chair and stares at the board
All of a sudden, there is a  at the door
The door opens and  peeps her head in
Sorry to interrupt
() 49
: It's no interruption
What are you still doing here
had to do inventory tonight
Bruce took off early so 'm the last one
Hey,  was wondering if you would mind walking me to my car
You know, just in case that freak with the dick is out there someplace
It would be my honor
Ronnie stands up and walks out with Brandi, shutting off the light as he leaves
- Ronnie and Brandi pull up to Brandi's car in the golf cart
Alright, thanks for the ride
Just doing my job with a little something extra especially for you
See ya tomorrow
Brandi, um
was just thinking, would you like to go to dinner this weekend
How come every time somebody does something nice for me, they act like  owe them a blow job
Look, it's not like that
've got a girlfriend
who doesn't work in this mall
Ronnie,  got to be honest with you, you're not really my type
() 50
: Just out of curiosity, what is your type
Rich guys
Or guys who are really hot
Yeah,  guess that's not me
'll go out to dinner with you on one condition
What's that
This is not a date
Do you understand
We're going to dinner, but we are not going on a date
Done
And you can never tell anybody we went out
My lips are sealed
You pay for dinner, right
And as many drinks as  want
You may drink your fill
And you have to drive me to my car every night after work for the next six months
You got it
And my car is low on gas, so need some money to fill it up
Ronnie takes out his wallet
() 51
: Is $20 enough
Nah, fifty
Ronnie takes out more money and hands it to Brandi
She takes it, counts it, and puts it into her bra
Okay, you can pick me up after work on Saturday
Dinner and that's it
Don't try to kiss me because 'll smack the shit out of you
It's not a date
Got it
Not a date
Thanks for the ride
Brandi climbs out of the golf cart and walks to her car
She opens the door and starts to get in -- Hey, Brandi
What
lied
It is a date
Before she can argue, Ronnie guns the golf cart and drives away
- Ronnie sees Stevie and the Skaters doing hand rails down a ramp while mall patrons try to get by without getting nailed by flying skateboards
Ronnie drives up on his golf cart
Our suspension is over
'm not here for that
need to talk to you
giant  with a shaved head stands up
() 52
: Anything you want to say to Stevie, you can say to me, motherfucker
Who the fuck are you
This is my cousin, Roy
He's a boxer
You got a fuckin' problem, bitch
Ronnie reaches into his belt and produces a can of mace
He sprays it into the eyes of the Bodyguard
The guy goes down and starts
My eyes
Jesus, Ronnie, what the fuck are you doing
need a favor
'm listening
As you know, we've had a lot of crime around here lately
Between the Flasher and all the break-ins, 've decided to go to the streets
Frankly, 'm looking for a stool pigeon and you're just the right person
Why would  want to help you
could make it worth your while
You like skating at the mall could allow you to skate here whenever you wanted
In exchange, you keep your eyes peeled and provide me with any information you come across as to the identity of the perpetrators
() 53
: Sorry, dude, but 'm no snitch
Go find somebody else to do your dirty work
Well, let me put it another way
If you don't help me, 'm gonna spread your little butt cheeks and stick this flashlight up your ass
But like for real
Like  really will do that
This is the new me talking and  get what  need, you understand me, Stevie
Alright, dude,  understand, you sick fuck
Cool
In that case, have fun shreadin'
Ronnie gets into his Golf Cart and drives off
Stevie looks down at the Boxer who is still on the ground
Stop crying, Roy
Stevie starts skating
-   - Ronnie walks into the Food Court and sees Nell waiting at their table with Ronnie's morning Cinnabon
He takes a deep breath and heads over
Hey, sweetie -- Oh, 'm sorry, good morning, Officer Barnhardt
Good morning, Nell
Where were you last night tried to call, but your mom said you weren't home from work yet
() 54
: Look,  got to talk to you about something
'm not really sure how to put this
Let's see
If you drove a Toyota
drive a Ford
know, but let's just pretend you drove a Toyota
Now, this Toyota runs really good
It always starts when you need it to and it gets good gas mileage and you don't have to do much to maintain it
Then you get a really important job like Astronaut, no that won't work, you get a job as the head of Wall Street
Well, you may really like that Toyota, but you're going to feel weird about driving it to work every day, right
Now let's say that somebody offers you a chance to get rid of that Toyota and instead you get a Ferrari
It may be more expensive and harder to drive, but mean, it just looks good as hell
What would you do
don't get it
You would trade up, Nell
Well, that's exactly what 'm doing
Are you thinking about getting a new car
No, Nell, 'm getting a new girlfriend
What
Who
This girl, Brandi
() 55
: The slutty girl who works at the make-up counter
Yeah,  mean, no, she's not a slut
But you're thinking of the right person
How could you do this to me
'm sorry
don't mean to hurt you
It's just, well,  believe in this world, you play the hand you're dealt and at this point in my life, 've been dealt five Aces
'd be a fool not to bet
Why are you doing this, Ronnie
have to, Nell
Don't you love me
Of course  love you
Then tell me why
Because 've never dated the prom queen before
Remember when you started this job
You weren't such a hotshot then
've stood by you when you were at your worst
Every time you fell,  held your hand and told you everything would be okay
Time and time again
Come on
Why do you have to bring that up
() 56
: never cared about who you wanted to be,  fell in love with who you really are
If you leave me, Ronnie,  won't be there to pick you up when you fall
Even if  do fall, it won't matter, because 'm learning to fly
Ronnie stands up and walks away
Nell sits there sad
She looks down at her Cinnabon and devours the whole thing
- '   - Ronnie looks through a clothing rack
It's full of cheap fabrics, lots of imitation silks and shit approaches Ronnie
Can  help you, sir
Yeah, um, 've got a really special date tonight with a hot young lady -- Do you know Brandi
No
Never mind
Anyway,  need something that's really 'cool
' Something that will impress her and  guess you could say 'm not exactly in the know with what the hipsters are up to these days
Let's see
Are you looking to fall in love or are you looking to get laid
Um,  guess love, but uh
You want to get laid, too
() 57
: Watch it, man
She's a lady
But yes
Alright,  got just the thing
Something classy is what you want
Show her you're a man with taste
: '  - Ronnie's Mom sits on his bed with a bottle of Wild Turkey
She waits for Ronnie to come out of the closet
Come on, Ronnie, just get out here
It's too tight in the butt
Let me see
Ronnie comes out of the closet and he's wearing a ridiculous fucking outfit
It's an imitation silk button up, with a pair of black parachute pants
There's two belts for some   action
He's got no socks on and a pair of white shoes
He looks like a goddamn fool
Ronnie, you look so handsome
Really, you don't think  look like a phony
Hell no
You look like a stud muffin
Yeah,  guess these clothes are kind of cool
Nell is a lucky girl
Its not Nell, Mom
() 58
: Really,  thought you and Nell were going to get married some day
did too
But then  met this girl Brandi and she swept me off my feet
Well,  always liked Nell, but as long as you're happy, Ronnie, that's all  care about
actually feel kind of bad about Nell, but  figure that  can pour all the sadness into Brandi and just really rely on her for my happiness instead of Nell
That sounds wonderful
Is she pretty
She is, Mom
She's the most perfect girl in the whole world
remember when your father picked me up for our first date
swear he was the most handsome man that had ever laid eyes on
knew right then and there that this would be the man that  married
hope that happens tonight
It will, Ronnie
Then you'll have to give her a ring like the one your father gave me
Ronnie's Mom holds up her finger for Ronnie
It's a giant yellow/cottony-looking diamond ring
Is that a yellow diamond
() 59
: It's a glass diamond
This is how it looks now
Mom, why did Dad leave
Well, he kind of freaked out when you were born
You had so many special needs that he just couldn't handle the pressure
One day, he just couldn't take it anymore
Do you think it was my fault that Dad left
Definitely
You don't think it was mine do you
Well,  didn't know, with the drinking and all
Nope, it was all you
Ronnie nods
love you, Ronnie
love you, too, Mom
' - The restaurant is the cheesiest of all sea food restaurants
Think one step down from Red Lobster
Ronnie sits across the table from Brandi
She chugs one of those giant frozen drinks, killing it in one gulp
Damn, that was pretty impressive
Yeah, work's been pissing me off, so  just need to blow off some steam
() 60
: Well, Brandi, can  just say that you look absolutely beautiful tonight
Yeah,  know
(calling to waiter) Nurse
Get me another -- (to Ronnie) You got this, right
Yeah, yeah
No problem
Nurse
Bring me another and keep 'em coming
(to Ronnie) think it's funny to call the waitress nurse
Ronnie takes a pill bottle out of his pocket
He opens it up and pops a pill
Hey, what's that
Oh, it's nothing
Don't be stingy, what the fuck is that
It's just a pill 'm supposed to take
Let me see
Ronnie hands the pills to Brandi
Where the fuck did you find these
The Doctor
() 61
: Damn, Ronnie, Klonopin
'm impressed
This is the good shit
didn't know you partied like this
Yeah,  guess  party like this every four to six hours as needed
Let me get one
Help yourself
Hell yeah
Brandi pops a bunch of pills
So, how do you like working at the mall
hate that shit
All  do is listen to bitching all day long
got to put makeup on these fat- ass women all day and it's like, don't give a shit what you do, you can't polish a turd
Yeah,  see how that could get to you
Let's do some shots
Waiter, four shots of Jager
That's a lot
It's Friday
So, Brandi,  hope 'm not being too forward, but do you have a boyfriend
() 62
: 've got a few hook-ups but nobody who is a boyfriend
Yes
You know, it's just like a time in my life where  want to be free right now and think about myself
Not get tied down to one person
Yeah,  understand
hate ties
recently cut mine and now 'm free like a bird
The shots come
Alright, bottoms up
Ronnie holds up a shot to toast
To new beginnings
Right up your ass
Brandi downs her shot
Okay
Ronnie takes his shot
Oh, shit
No more
'm sticking to beer
What's wrong, is your pussy hurting
God, you remind me so much of my mother
Brandi knocks back the other two shots
() 63
: Feel the burn, bitch
You are so beautiful
'  - Ronnie's car is a piece-of-shit Subaru
Brandi is shit- faced and yelling at people out of the window
Who wants to see my titties
Brandi lifts up her shirt and shows the passengers of other cars her boobs
Brandi, this is the most fun 've ever had on a date
For the last time, this ain't a date, motherfucker
This is a party
Wooo
Um, so, Brandi, it's no secret that 'm attracted to you
think everybody in the mall is
As you know,  recently split with my girlfriend and basically,  was wondering if, since you don't have a boyfriend, that  could maybe be your boyfriend and you could be my girlfriend
That's my house
Ronnie hits the brakes
'  - Ronnie opens Brandi's door and helps Brandi out
She's almost passed out drunk
Both of her eyes are closed and she immediately tries to sleep on the ground
Ronnie helps her up, but when he does, Brandi gives him a kiss -- a sloppy one
() 64
: Brandi,  had a wonderful time tonight
'm so fucking shit-faced
They kiss again, but when they do, Brandi pukes all over the place
It's a disgusting puke and there's vomit on her cheek and stuff
Ronnie holds her head for her
Are you okay
My breath smells like asshole
Ronnie looks longingly into her eyes
love you, Brandi
think 've got puke in my teeth
don't care
Ronnie kisses Brandi passionately on the mouth
He walks her inside the house
On the way in, she falls over
Ronnie helps her up
He carries her into the house where the make-love spot is
: -   - Ronnie is with Dennis in the food court
Ronnie is smiling, but Dennis isn't saying a word as usual
Don't look at me like that, Dennis
told you  wouldn't talk
Ronnie sits back, but he can't help a giant grin on his face
() 65
: 'm serious, Dennis
gentleman never kisses and tells
So, just stop with all the pressure because it's just not gonna happen
Ronnie keeps on grinning at Dennis
Okay, fine, you son of a bitch, you want details, 'll give you details
had sex with Brandi last night
Dennis and Ronnie high-five
It was amazing
mean, 've never experienced anything like it
've been with a girl or two
Dennis stares at Ronnie
Okay, fine, 've been with a girl, but let me tell you, this was so much better
You know how many times we did it
Twice
Nell, who looks like she's been crying nonstop, stuffs a whole Cinnabon into her face
As it fills her cheeks, she looks over to Ronnie's table and sees Ronnie making thrusting motions at the table
Nell swallows, stuffs another Cinnabon in, then storms out of the Food Court
' Ronnie continues to talk to Dennis
But  got to tell you, Dennis
It was steamy and sexy, but more than anything,  should tell you that it's her soul that  fell for the most
She got pretty tanked, but could just really tell that she's a good person
The kind of person that  could see myself with
() () 66
: (') Look, 'm gonna get out of here
There's a lot of people  need to tell about this, so 'll catch up with you later
Oh, and  almost forgot, keep your eyes peeled for crime and stuff
Ronnie leaves the table
- Nell watches Brandi as she pops a couple of aspirin behind the makeup counter
She takes a deep breath and walks up to the counter
Excuse me
How may  help you
need to talk to you
What is it, honey
Let me guess
You're looking for something to take care of those blackheads and hide that puffiness under your eyes
've got just the thing
No, that's not it
Well, how much is it
Fifty dollars for the bottle
Okay, 'll take it
Brandi begins to ring up the cream
Listen,  know you're Ronnie's new girlfriend
What the hell are you talking about
() 67
: It's okay
know he left me to be with you and  accept that
don't know who you've been talking to, but it's safe to say that you're fucking trippin'
It's fine really
It's going to take a while for me to get over it, but 'll be okay
Nell starts to get all teary-eyed
She picks up a Kleenex from a box on the counter and wipes her eyes
Oh fuckin' Lord
This is disgusting
'm sorry
Pull it together
This is how you run around all the time
Have some self-respect
No wonder your man left you
Who the hell would want to be around this shit all day
Nell pulls herself together
Jesus teaches us to forgive
And forgive you for what you did to me when you stole my boyfriend
Plus,  feel pretty confident that you'll end up burning in hell because of the various evil ways you live your life and that brings me some satisfaction
But  just want to tell you that Ronnie is a good person
He does a lot of stupid stuff, but really, he wants to do good for the world
want you to know that if you hurt him and ruin his heart,  will personally come down here and kick the ever living shit out of you
Nell walks away
() 68
: You better fuckin' run, bitch
Nell turns around and starts storming toward Brandi
Brandi throws her hands up, frightened
'm just kidding
Nell stops charging and walks away
Nell walks past Bruce who is helping a customer at the end of the counter
It's not too late to change your ways
Okay
Thanks
Nell walks out of the department store
-   - Ronnie looks at the colorful flowers in the glass refrigerator
The   walks up to Ronnie
Ronnie, 've been expecting you
You have
Oh yeah,  heard about last night
Brandi is quite the woman
Congratulations, my friend
Or should  say, welcome to the club
The Flower Salesman winks and starts laughing
Ronnie doesn't
It gets weird so the Flower Salesman stops
What color of roses do the women like anyway
Well, it depends on what you are trying to say
The white roses symbolize innocence and purity
() 69
: Yeah, we're way past the color white if you know what  mean
What about the yellow ones
Joy, happiness, appreciation
don't even know what to make of that
The pink rose means thank you
Next
The red rose is the most powerful
It symbolizes love
Why didn't you just say that
'm a busy man here
'm sorry
Forget it
Give me a big bag of the red ones
Um, can  ask a question
Go ahead
Do you really like Brandi
've only been on one date with her, but  could see myself being with her for all of eternity
Well, in that case, the greatest symbol of love is just a single red rose
() 70
: Seems   like a big bag of roses would   be more love than just one, but    guess you're the expert
Gimme   one
The Flower Salesman takes a single red rose from the case and hands it to Ronnie
- Brandi is behind the counter gossiping with Bruce
Ronnie holds his rose and watches them from a distance
He takes a deep breath and then walks to the counter
Brandi
What are you doing here
came here to see you
And to present you with this single red rose
It symbolizes 'love
' Ronnie, that's really
uncalled for
Well, after last night,    just wanted you to know that   it wasn't just some fling to me
It meant something special and    felt it deep in my soul
You fucked the Security Guard
() You are such a little slut
Oh, like you've never been drunk, Bruce
Brandi grabs Ronnie and pulls him off to the side
Ronnie, look
got to be honest with you
barely remember last night
() 71
: remember it for the both of us
Okay, see here's the thing don't know how to say this, so 'm just gonna come on out with it
Ronnie,  could never date you seriously
mean, you're a security guard
'm the head of Mall Security
Exactly
The point is,  don't really see myself being with that
Like ever
You know what  mean
Brandi,  know exactly what you mean
And  just want to thank you for being honest
You're telling me 'm not living up to my full potential in life
It's funny, because 've been feeling like this for quite some time guess  just needed that extra little push to get me over this hurdle 've been stuck on
How can you be with a man who isn't living the life he was meant to
Yeah, something like that
And just you know, you're a security guard at the mall and it's like, come on, you know
don't like it, Brandi, but  do understand
promise you this
Next time you see me,  will be wearing a uniform that will make you proud
will be the man that you will be honored to call your life's love
Don't bet on it
() 72
: will though
'll bet everything  have on you
Now ask you for one favor
Although am unworthy, will you accept this rose from me anyway
can't do that
And tell your girlfriend to stop coming by my work and threatening me and shit
Brandi walks away, leaving Ronnie there holding his flower
: - Ronnie sits at a small table and waits patiently
Then a walks into the room
Ronnie stands to shake his hand
'm here to become a police officer
We're always on the hunt for new recruits
Do you have at least a high school diploma
have a
We usually prefer an actual diploma, but  is technically acceptable
Are you a citizen of the United States
You bet your ass  am
Okay, Mr
Barnhardt, there are several steps you have to complete in order to be eligible for the police academy
Physical evaluation, psychological test, background check
() () 73
: (') If you pass these tests, you will be admitted to the police academy
Now,  like to tell all new recruits that they should complete a ride along before making this decision
It's where you actually ride along with a real police officer during a routine patrol
It helps give you an idea of the kind of situations you'll be dealing with
Sound good
That sounds fun
Sign me up
- Ronnie sits in the unmarked police car with Detective Harrison
It's like it was meant to be
You behind the wheel
Me riding shotgun
Two brothers of the badge unite to form the ultimate crime-stopping combo
'm psyched to be here, Harrison
Thank you for the opportunity
You requested to ride along with me
know
You want to know the truth
It's because  respect you
See, when we're at the mall, it's obviously my turf
Sure, break your balls about being a rookie, but out here in the streets, 'm the rookie
'm here to learn
Teach me
Why do you want to become a Cop
've wanted to be a Police officer all my life
() () 74
: (') Don't get me wrong,  love keeping the mall safe, but you guys are the ones that really enforce justice and protect, not just our mall, but our whole community don't tell the guys on my squad this, but the Security Guard job was just temporary
Well, just pay attention tonight and make sure you stay out of the way
Right, we're not back at the station anymore so we can cut the charade
What are you talking about
Well,  know that policy demands stay out of the way, but between you and me,  just want you to know that if anything pops off tonight, 'm going to jump right in there and take 'em down with you
No, no
Ronnie, policy says you have to stay in the car
get you
You have to say this in order to keep you safe 'legally' speaking
should probably follow along too
' swear  won't get out of the car and fight justice tonight
' Ronnie, you really can't
know
Ronnie winks at Detective Harrison
smile comes across Harrison's face
() 75
: 'm glad we understand each other
Detective Harrison puts the car in drive and the guys head off for the night
- Ronnie and Detective Harrison sit in the parked car
They're at the shittiest crack corner in the whole town
Lots of scary bums and hookers loiter around the car
Yeah, so then  basically saw his ass trying to circumvent around the ped exit and slip through the employ exit
Not allowed
The two ped exits are to be used only -- You see that corner there, Ronnie
Yeah,  see it
That corner used to be the worst corner in this whole town
It was riddled with drugs, prostitution, and gang violence
It was nicknamed 'The Crossroads
' Shit, 've heard of that
That's right, but myself and the other officers worked on cleaning it up for years so that the good folks of this neighborhood wouldn't have to worry about being safe
Yes, sir, that corner is a testament to the fine police work of our force
don't know
It looks pretty shitty to me
() 76
: Well, it's a low income area, Ronnie
You're being kind of prejudiced
Oh, yeah,  can see that it's basically a fine neighborhood
That's right, but it hasn't been easy
We still patrol this area every night just to keep our presence up
use that same technique at the mall
'm sure
usually do the foot patrols myself, but because  like you, 'm going to let you do it tonight
Really
Yeah,   really
But  told you about   department policy, so 'm going   to need you to keep quiet about   this one
You can count on me
Thank you for the honor
Of course, Ronnie
just really believe in you
won't let you down
Ronnie   opens the door and gets out of the car
As he exits,   a car drives by
The passenger throws   a beer bottle at Ronnie
He dodges it and the bottle   shatters on the ground
Ronnie is shaken, but he waves to Detective Harrison like he's okay
Detective Harrison waves back, then Ronnie is confused
() 77
: Where are you going
Detective Harrison keeps on driving without looking back
: - Ronnie looks petrified as he stands guard
stands off to the side staring Ronnie down
Ronnie waves to the bum
The bum runs his finger under his throat
Ronnie tries to ignore him
group of  walk by Ronnie talking loudly
Hey, no horse play
You guys get on home
You want some crack
No,  don't want any crack
In fact,  didn't want to do this, but you leave me no choice in the matter
'm placing you under citizen's arrest
Ronnie grabs the little Kid by the shoulders to restrain him
Let me go, motherfucker
place you under citizen's arrest for the crime of selling a Schedule 1 Narcotic
You have the right to remain silent
Unbeknownst to Ronnie, Gang Members start walking up behind him
It's like that scene in Training Day where all the gangsters are hanging out right across the street with guns and shit
They come up behind him as he speaks to the kids
() 78
: If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you
Now  guess we just wait here for my ride to come back
Ronnie turns around to look for Harrison's return, but instead he sees that he is surrounded by a large group of pissed-off
#1 That's my little brother you got there
Who, this little guy right here
#1 That's right
Well,  hate to be the one to tell you this, but it appears that your little brother has tried to sell me illegal drugs
know it's hard for you to hear that
#1 He works for me, motherfucker
Is that so
Well then, it looks like you got one less employee because 'm taking little brother down
'll die right here before let crime prevail
The Gang Members all pull out their guns and point them at Ronnie
(to the little Kid) Free to go, little brother
My mistake completely
Good luck with the crack
The little Kid runs off
Alright, so  guess 'll be seeing you folks
The Gang Members stand in Ronnie's way and cock their guns
() 79
: #2 Yo, waste this pig, Tone
Oh, no
That's really not necessary, Tone
#2 Do it, man
Gang Member #1 puts the gun right up to Ronnie's head
Oh, Jesus,  don't want to die
Don't let me die, don't do it
Ronnie goes down on his knees
No, please
'm sorry
Ronnie reaches into his boot and pulls out a small rod
He flips his wrist and it extends into a night stick
Ronnie's begging was a trap
Ronnie pops up and begins dropping all those motherfuckers with lightning-fast precision
Ronnie breaks arms and busts heads like a fucking ninja
Gang Member #1 comes in and hits Ronnie with a sucker punch, busting his nose wide open
Ronnie stands up and goes mano y mano in a fist fight with Gang Member #1
He starts kicking Ronnie's ass
Ronnie goes down again and Gang Member #1 starts stomping Ronnie
Ronnie grabs Gang Member #1's leg and twists it
He takes him down
Ronnie jumps on top of him and begins beating him senseless
: Ronnie stands up and looks around at the pool of beaten bodies
This is Ronnie at his most primal and also at his best
: - Detective Harrison is eating doughnuts and laughing with a bunch of other
() 80
: #1 can't believe you dropped him off at the Crossroads
That's fucking hilarious
Trust me, you would have done the same thing
This guy is without a doubt the biggest fucking idiot have ever met
#1 He's probably going to get killed
Good
Fuck him,  hope he does get killed
All of a sudden, Ronnie comes in all beaten and bruised
Ronnie, what are you doing here
know what you did
Ronnie, look,  didn't do anything -- You're not going to talk your way out of this one
You set me up
Ronnie, look -- Don't try to deny it
You set me up and that's all there is to it
Ronnie,  -- And  just want to thank you for it
Thank me
Why
() 81
: Because 'm proud to report that passed the test
know you wanted to see if  had the chops to cut it on the police force and 'm glad to say that  passed knew  would get initiated some time, but  didn't think it would be so soon
Thank you, Detective Harrison
Thank you for believing in me
Ronnie,  don't know what to say
You don't have to say anything
Your actions speak for themselves
Thank you for giving this rookie a shot
Get used to seeing Ronnie Barnhardt around here, boys
-    -
- : The   blows a whistle and starts the 100 meter dash
Ronnie jumps off the starting line and hauls ass down the track
The other Trainees fall behind Ronnie as he smokes their asses
-: Ronnie jumps on the bar and begins to do pull- up after pull-up
: The Testing Officer blows a whistle and Ronnie begins to shuffle side to side like an ice skater that never moves forward
-:     Ronnie goes hard on the sit-ups
: Ronnie sprints up a wall and flips to the other side
He charges a body of water, then jumps onto the rope and swings safely to the other side
: - All the lights are off and we see the dark shadow creep through the darkness
The shadow breaks into the   and grabs as many pairs of sneakers that it can carry
The shadow opens the sliding cage and closes it from the other side
Then bends down and locks it

- '  - Mark sits behind his desk reading a paper
The :
There's a at the door
Come in
Ronnie sticks his head in the door
Good morning, Mark
Is it, Ronnie
mean, the mall is getting butchered in the press
Somebody who works here is ripping the place off
The cops don't have any leads
'm getting shit from the owner of the mall
Sales are down
mean, what's so good about this morning
feel your pain, Mark
Quite frankly, there's two things happening
One, 'm lacking a sufficient firearm
And two, we're understaffed
That's why come to you this morning with a plan
(calling to the door) Come on in, Charles
Charles opens the door and walks in
Who is this
This is Charles, sir
() How's it going
You work at 'Charley's, right
That's right
() 83
: Mark,  would like to hire Charles here as an additional Security Guard
He would operate under me
figure with the additional criminal element, we should hire more security in hopes that we would have a better chance of catching these guys
Do you have any experience, son
Not really
Um, sir,  have personally been training young Charles for weeks now in preparation for this day
The kid kind of looks up to me
'm some what of a big brother to the little guy
Charles kind of looks at Ronnie like he's crazy
Alright, it's actually not a bad idea
It might make our Security more visible so we can give people the illusion that we're on top of this
Ronnie winks at Charles
Thank you, Mark
Ronnie, one more thing
Look, if this crime doesn't come to an end pretty soon, we're gonna have to let someone go
mean, you've always done a great job for me, but the truth is, someone is going to have to take the fall
You're the one who wanted to be Head of Mall Security and quite frankly, just bought my wife a new Cadillac, so let's just say it won't be me
() 84
: With Charles on my team,  can now devote more time to the robbery and Pervert case
plan on having these wrapped up by the end of the week
Mark laughs to himself
Why'd you just laugh
It's nothing
Have fun, Ronnie
Ronnie looks at Charles
Did  say something funny
Let's go, Ronnie
Ronnie and Charles take off
- Ronnie and Charles stand in the middle of the floor and supervise the "mall walkers
" Be careful, guys
Nice and slow
That's not bad, but you need to learn to speak in a more authoritative voice
Watch this
Slow it down
Slow it down
You've already received one verbal, don't make me issue a second
(back to Charles) See, you can't be intimidated
You have to make them respect you
Ronnie, you know  really want to thank you for the job
You're a man of your word
() 85
: No problem, my young student
So, got something to tell you
Keep this between us until it's official, but  don't think 'm going to be here for much longer
You're quitting
But you love this job
do love it, but it looks like someone is going to be joining the police force
The real police
They're calling me up
It's basically a done deal
Just a little red tape is the only thing keeping me from carrying a gun
didn't even know you wanted to become a Cop
It's always been my job
The Mall thing is great training, but it has its limitations
Some stars are just meant to shine brighter than others
Congrats, brother
(to a mall walker) ,   ,
Mall Walker slows her pace
She turns around and Ronnie sees that it's Nell
Nell
Hey, Ronnie
What are you doing
() 86
: Nothing, just getting in shape
Well, that's okay,  guess
Just watch your speed, okay
Nell waves and walks on
Isn't that your girlfriend
Ex
She looked good
You think so
She looks a lot better
Yeah
Ronnie shrugs it off
- Ronnie sits across from a female
Okay, Ronnie, today 'll be giving you a psychiatric evaluation to determine if you're competent to enter into the Police Academy
It's really just a formality
Don't want any serial killers working for us, now do we
No, ma'am, we don't
Okay, Ronnie, so let's start with your background
Where are you from
Born and raised right here
() 87
: Local boy
Okay, and, Ronnie, have you ever been convicted of any crimes
No, ma'am
My record is totally clean
Do you now take any illegal drugs or have you taken any in the past
No, ma'am
believe drugs are the path to self-destruction and should be purged from the face of the earth with ruthless vengeance
Any prescription medications
Yes, for my nerves
man in my line of work has a lot of stress to deal with
If you've seen the bloodshed 've seen, you'd be on the meds too
-- Where are you going with this
Are you presently or have you ever been affiliated with the Communist Party
can't believe you'd even ask me that
Have you ever been in the military
Yes
What branch of the military were you in
The kind of branch that doesn't exist on paper
() 88
: Okay, here's a real world scenario
You have a gun -- Finally
That wasn't really the question, never mind,  think  got that one
Um
here's one
Do you feel like you would work well on a team
Would
Yes
Would  be more useful working alone,  would say definitely
see myself more like a Rambo kind of guy
man who rolls solo
Taking care of business on his own terms
Kind of like a Superhero or something
Why do you want to become a cop
want to become a cop to help people
The world is a scary place with lots of evil everywhere
See,  have this vision of evil trying to get at the world from every angle and there  stand at the top of it all with my gun, just kind of blowing it away
Just me and my weapons, cleaning up this whole town know  could do some good if  was just given a chance and everybody would be a lot better off
Uh-huh
So, what do you feel is the greatest danger facing a police officer today
Maybe Russian gang activity, but you know what
think 'm gonna have to go with evil on that one too
() 89
: Okay,  think we're good here
It's been a pleasure, Ronnie
Thank you, ma'am
'  -  - Ronnie's Mom takes a bath and swigs on a bottle
She's drunk and passing out in the tub
Ronnie scrubs her back with a sponge
'm telling you, Mom, this police thing could be good for both of us
Not just the fact that 'll be making the streets safer for you, but they have health insurance and a pension plan so don't have to worry about your medical bills as much
don't care about that bullshit
All  need is a little nip of this good shit right here and 'm ready to walk through the pearly gates
Mom,  know, but maybe you should stop drinking so much
You're getting up there and you know what the doctor said about your liver
don't tell you how to party, don't tell me how to live my life
've taken care of you since you were born
just worry about you is all
Ronnie, don't get your hopes up about this police thing
Why would you say that
() 90
: You know why
just don't want to see you get hurt
It's my job to protect you from the bullshit
Mom,  appreciate it, but 'm going to make it as a police officer
'm tired of coming in second all the time
Everybody in life gets to go for their goals, why should  be any different
know
Just be careful is all
You've got a good heart and don't want to see it broken
Okay, Mom
hear you
And, Ronnie, one more thing
What's that, Mom
In the tub, a bunch of bubbles plop to the surface
Mom
That's gross
(drunk laughing) That's right
Now you got to smell it
Mom
- The Police Academy is full of energy as new recruits pour up the steps and into the building, eager to start their training
Ronnie comes walking up and takes a long look at the building
Ronnie smiles to himself and heads up the stairs
Ronnie reaches the top where Detective Harrison is waiting
Ronnie stops
() 91
: Ronnie Barnhardt reporting for duty
can see that
Listen,  don't really know how to say this, but we're not going to be able to let you join the academy
What
Why not
It seems you had a little trouble passing the minimum requirements
Did  fail one of the tests
Well, yes, actually, you failed the psychological exam
No
It says
(reads from the form) That Ronnie Barnhardt shows warning signs of delusion and allowing him to join the force puts his life and the lives of others in jeopardy
Detective Harrison, you've got to believe me
'm completely sound
This has got to be a mistake
Ronnie,  personally did your background check and this is the fifth time you've been turned down for the police academy
You guys keep records on that
() 92
: We sure do
Look,  tried to talk to them, but there's no way they're gonna let you in
'm sorry, but your dreams of becoming a Police Officer just aren't going to happen
understand
Thanks for believing in me, Detective
And just for the record, 'm not crazy
Take care, Ronnie
Detective Harrison goes inside and closes the doors on Ronnie
Ronnie stands outside of the closed academy by himself
The    Ronnie and  -
: - Ronnie is behind the locked gate to the food court, but it looks like he is behind bars in a prison
Ronnie slides the bars up and walks out
- Ronnie walks through the mall and looks at the lights of the different shops
Everything looks colorful and weird
Ronnie is in his own head
This isn't the exciting world as before, now it's a disgusting fabricated make-believe land
: -   - The mall is kind of winding down for the day
The stores are closing and people are going home
Ronnie sees Nell putting her apron away and preparing to leave
Ronnie walks up to her
() 93
: Hey, Nell
Hey, Ronnie
How's it going
Can  talk to you for a second
What is it
tried to get into the police academy again and the same thing happened
Oh, Ronnie, 'm sorry
Ronnie starts to tear up
Why does this keep happening to me, Nell
don't know, Ronnie
Maybe it's just not meant to be
Are you okay
No
Are you going home
mean, do you want to go somewhere and talk or something
Ronnie,  can't
Why not
've got plans
What plans
Look at this sorry piece of shit
Ronnie looks up to see Saddamn walking toward him
() 94
: What the fuck do you want
don't want anything from you
(to Nell) How you doing, sweetness
Saddamn hugs Nell from behind and kisses her on the cheek
You look beautiful tonight
What the fuck is going on
You ready to go
We got reservations at 9:00
'm ready, Saddamn
Nell, for the love of God, don't go with him
'm sorry, Ronnie
Nell and Saddamn turn and walk towards the door
On the way out, Saddamn turns back around to Ronnie and smiles
Then, he begins to "air hump" Nell from behind
Don't go, Nell
Remember your purity
Remember your purity
Nell and Saddamn leave the mall
- Ronnie sits down on one of the benches in the mall
He watches a couple walk by, their little kid swinging between their arms
Then, Stevie comes in and takes a seat next to Ronnie
What are you doing, Ronnie
() 95
: 'm just taking a break
What do you want, Stevie
don't have time to fuck around with you today
got something
Stevie reaches into his pocket
He pulls out a bunch of Polaroids of penises
What the fuck is this
Dude,  found these all over the mall
'm guessing that whoever this Mall Flasher is, left these for girls to find
This thing gets grosser and grosser all the time
Well, thanks for the clue
Maybe  can use this to identify the freak
You can skate all you want around here
What's wrong with you, Ronnie
What do you mean
don't know
You just seem kind of sad
Nah, man, 'm fine
mean, 'm catchin' perverts and protecting this mall and just you know, really livin' the dream
That's cool
Look, man, you want to get high
No,  don't want to get high
That's cool
() 96
: The conversation dies down and the two just kind of sit there
And by the way, if  see you getting high,  will call the police and have your criminal ass arrested
Don't you fuckin' ever mistake my kindness for weakness
hate drugs and  hate you too
Fine, you fucking dick
Steve stands up to leave
Ronnie sits there looking sad
- Ronnie sits in his golf cart staring at the mall as the last of the customers leave
That's when Ronnie sees Brandi come out of the door
Brandi looks around and darts across the parking lot
Ronnie follows Brandi's path and tries to catch up with her
- Ronnie drives around, but he can't find Brandi anywhere
Ronnie sees a lone black car at the outer edge of the parking lot
He pulls his golf cart over and climbs out
Ronnie creeps up to the car and peers in the window
Inside, Ronnie sees Brandi and Detective Harrison banging like a couple of wild animals
Ronnie jumps back in shock
'  - Brandi stops humping Detective Harrison
Shhhh
What is it
thought  heard something
() 97
: Detective Harrison looks out of the window
He doesn't see anything
He climbs back on top of Brandi
It's nothing
, - Ronnie runs around Detective Harrison's car wielding a flashlight like a mad man
Ronnie beats the shit out of Harrison's car
He smashes headlights, mirrors and fenders
Harrison and Brandi duck down
Shit
That motherfucker is crazy
Well, you're the fucking cop
Do something
You're right
Okay, here it goes
Harrison reaches over Brandi and opens her door
What the fuck are you doing
Harrison pushes Brandi out of the car and shuts himself back in
Ronnie sees Brandi and stops pummeling the car
() 98
: Ronnie, it's me
Don't do anything crazy
Get back inside, Brandi
This isn't about you
you
you slut
Fuck off, Ronnie
How can you just stand there after you ruined my life and act like nothing happened
It's easy 'cause  don't give a Ronnie
He charges at Brandi with the flashlight over his head
He's about to crack her when
Ronnie  to see Harrison on the other side of him with his pistol drawn and pointed at Ronnie
Drop the flashlight, Ronnie
Ronnie drops the flashlight from his hands
You're pretty tough with that gun
Ronnie,  know you've had a hard time -- You were supposed to be my friend
So you're gonna kill Brandi
was just trying to scare her
You don't scare me, you piece of shit
() 99
: Ronnie lifts the flashlight up again like he's going to hit Brandi
Brandi ducks
Detective Harrison cocks the gun
Ronnie
Fine, fuck you
Fuck all of you
And, Harrison, you better be glad you have a gun or 'd kick your ass too
And you know what
'm taking my friendship back because you don't deserve it
And, Brandi, 'm taking my love back too
'm gonna leave now and you two can just have fun
Have fun sleeping tonight because something tells me, you won't be able to
Ronnie climbs into the golf cart and drives off
That guy is a nut job
Tell me about it
So you slept with him
was drunk okay
You gonna make a big deal out of it
No,  guess not
Fine
'  - : There's an update on the It says he has exposed himself to more girls
As the  blares the headline, Ronnie lays in his bed and watches
The images shine  on him, but Ronnie is in his own world

'm disbanding the task force
Hey, Ronnie, that's crazy talk
Are you cool
No, 'm not cool, Charles
In fact, shit is seriously fucked up
've got to protect the whole mall by myself
Now,  got you this fucking job, when are you going to stop being a little baby and do something for a change
() ' don't want to do anything hard
just want to be a little bitch and brag about dropping out of college
' Grow a fucking pair, will you, Chucky
'm gonna go check the parking lot
Charles walks away
(calling out) 'm sorry, Charles
didn't mean it, buddy
Ronnie puts his head on the table
You know, Dennis, for the longest time  made this job my whole life
looked at this mall as a kingdom and  looked at Mark as the King
thought of myself as the first Knight and the customers, well, they were the peasants
lived by an old code where one was bound by duty and honor
But now  don't know if believe in that code anymore
've lost my way
Now  just feel like it's one big kingdom of shit
Right now,  got half a mind just to let this whole place burn
Burn it to the fucking ground
() 101
: Dennis stares down at the desk
Dennis takes off his hat and reveals that he has bleached white Eminem hair underneath
Next, he reaches under his collar and flips out a thin gold necklace
He kicks up his shoes and reveals the newest and freshest basketball kicks
This is the   and for the first time ever, he speaks
(high ghetto voice) 've been waiting on you to get on my page this whole time
You look at this mall as a Kingdom
Shit
look at this place like a motherfucking jail sentence
You put on that uniform every morning, but what are you really protecting
Commerce and corporations and money
Well  say, fuck that
'm a fucking outlaw and 'm going to live that until the day  die
Now, can show you the way, but you've got to be willing to accept it
So 'm gonna ask you now, Ronnie
Are you ready for a trip to the other side
You're goddamn right 'm ready
Alright then
Let's party
: - Dennis and Ronnie hang in the back of the mall by the dumpsters
Dennis sucks down a fat joint
He passes it to Ronnie
So, yeah, usually  take a joint straight to the head before start work in this motherfucker, but on really stressful days, like to get drunk too
Dennis pulls out a flask and gulps it down
Ronnie is still staring at the joint
Finally he takes a puff and begins violently coughing
He finally stops
() 102
: Fuck it, give me the bottle
Dennis hands Ronnie the bottle and he takes a big swig
: - Ronnie and Dennis stand against a wall while they check out booties of various shapes and sizes on all of the girls that walk by
So then  usually come in here and perv out on girls for about an hour or two
hooked up twice last week
One was this Asian chick and the other was this mom
She wasn't that hot, but what else do  got to do
Two high school girls walk by
Sweet Jesus in the morning
-   - Ronnie and Dennis are hanging in a dressing room
Dressing rooms are a great place to hide out, because nobody is really going to think of looking for me here
You can nap or just kind of hang out and just really have some personal time
Hey, hand me that camera
Ronnie picks up a shitty camera and hands it to Dennis
Thanks, Ronnie
Dennis stands up on the bench and looks into the other changing room
The two high school girls are changing into other clothes
Dennis starts taking pictures of them without them knowing
: 103
- Ronnie is smoking a joint and so is Dennis
Right before lunch  usually blaze up again real good
: - Dennis and Ronnie walk by the skaters
Hey, what's up, motherfuckers
What up, Big Den
You know, smokin' that good good
Dude, why are you hanging out with Ronnie
Fuck you, Stevie
Hey, Ronnie's alright
Let me see that stick
Stevie slides the skateboard over to Dennis
He jumps on it and does a perfectly executed kick flip
The skaters cheer
- Brandi is at the counter with Bruce
She helps a customer
That'll be $39
99
My wife's gonna love this perfume
hope so
It's my favorite
() 104
: Brandi looks past the Customer and sees Ronnie just standing there staring daggers at her
Ronnie shakes his head in disgust
The Male Customer turns around and sees Ronnie
It's a weird little moment
Dennis grabs Ronnie by the arm
Come on, brother
Let's go
Ronnie follows Dennis off
: - Ronnie stands in the store and looks down at his walkie
(
) (over the walkie) Ronnie, we need you down at the candy store
Some little brat has been shoveling peanuts in his mouth for the last hour
Ronnie turns the walkie-talkie off
Dennis runs behind the counter
Dennis drops the needle on a '
Dennis jumps on top of the counter and starts jumping up and down with the music
He's fucking drunk
Dennis jumps off the counter and tackles Ronnie, knocking over a stand of 's
: - Ronnie and Dennis ride on a mini railroad train for kids
They both drink from the flask as they spin around the track
It's full of nothing but kids and security
: 105
- '  - The    stands outside of the dressing room wearing a sexy teddy with a -string and garters
Dennis and Ronnie are kicking back in the love seat and watching
Dennis makes a motion for the Sales Clerk to spin around
She reluctantly does as she is instructed
: -   - Ronnie and Dennis play video games
tries to take the controller from Dennis, but Dennis whips out the handcuffs
He locks the Little Kid onto the display case so the kid can't move
: - Ronnie and Dennis play Skee-Ball, except Ronnie tosses the balls to Dennis who is standing on top of the machine
Dennis slam dunks the balls into the 100 point hole
The tickets pour out
: - Ronnie and Dennis are driving in the golf cart and they're both wearing those   that they won with arcade tickets
Behind them, Stevie and the other Skaters hold onto the golf cart and get pulled on their skateboards
They race towards a loading ramp
Dennis floors it and they go up the ramp and  the golf cart into the air
The golf cart and Skaters soar into the air
It holds forever, until suddenly, the golf cart lands with a thud
: - The mall is basically empty as Dennis and Ronnie make the final rounds
They get to the doors and lock up for the night
() 106
: Dennis,  got to thank you for today
Man,  was so down, but you taught me that  don't need to take things so seriously here
We have a pointless existence
Who gives a fuck
Don't mention it, homey
'm just glad  got me a partner in crime
partner
like that
You know, 've never really had a friend before, but  think that this could be the beginning of a real good thing
Dennis unlocks the doors to the Gap
You ain't even seen the best part
After everybody leaves,  rob the shit out of this place
What do you mean
steal shit
You're the one who's been robbing the mall
Hell yeah
Who'd you think it was
Dennis goes inside the Gap and just starts grabbing shit
can't believe this
Right in front of my goddamn face this whole time
Dennis holds up a sweat shirt
This probably will look good with my complexion
Dennis,  can't take part in this
() 107
: Ronnie,  thought you were down
What the fuck
Here  am opening up myself to you and you're just gonna stick it to me like this
What the fuck has this place ever done for you
Don't you know that people see us as jokes useless tool that's left in the shed
Well that's not me
Not now, not ever
told you, 'm an outlaw
can't let you rob the mall
What the fuck you mean you can't let me
Come on, Dennis
We're best friends, so just put that stuff back and let's go get a beer
Alright, Ronnie, you're right
Dennis sets the shirts down
don't really know what  was thinking
Robbing the mall
Let's just go get that beer
Good, man
That makes me feel better
Ronnie turns to walk, but Dennis grabs the hand of one of the mannequins and rips it off
He takes the hand and cracks Ronnie over the head with it
Ronnie goes down on his knees
See ya in Mexico, bitch
Dennis cocks back and whacks Ronnie again
Ronnie's lights go out
108
- Dennis pulls out of the mall driving a
He flips a joint into the air and peels out
He cruises down the street
He passes a cop car and flips it off
: - The  walks up the floor with a mop
Ronnie is battered and bloodied from his fight with Dennis, but he is wide awake and handcuffed to
Ramon, get your ass over here
Go get my spare keys out of the office
The Janitor looks at Ronnie, smiles, and calmly mops in the other direction
Ramon
Goddamn it get back here
Go get my goddamn keys
- '  - Mark sits across the desk from Ronnie and Charles
How fucking stupid do you have to be
mean Dennis
What the fuck, Ronnie
How could you not have known it was Dennis
Then, how the fuck could you be so stupid as to let him get away
Those are the only two things you have to do and you can't do those worth a shit
Can  speak now
Go ahead
Are you sure
Just start talking, Ronnie
() 109
: It seems only natural that 'some people' would want to blame me and truth be told  do put a lot of that blame on myself
But some people might say that the cops are to blame for not catching them
Some people might say that the reason this happened was the undeniable fact that  was under- equipped and quite frankly, lacking a sufficient firearm
But not me
carry this loss alone deep inside my heart
Good
Because you're fired
() Fuck you
'm serious, Ronnie
've always liked you, but there's just no excuse for this
Somebody is going down and 'll be damned if it's going to be me
Now, don't make a big thing out of this
Just pack your shit and get out by the end of the day
Wait a minute
thought  could trust you, Mark, and now you're telling me that you're going to be the one to put the knife in my back
Fair weather friend you are
'm not your friend, 'm your boss
You think you're so smart, Mark
You don't know everything
If you're firing me, then you can say goodbye to your entire Security staff
Because there is no fucking way my team is going to work here if you fire me
Isn't that right, Charles
() 110
: Ronnie,  got to talk to you about this
Mark asked me down here to escort you out
And you told him to fuck off, right
Charles
Right
What the fuck do you want from me, Ronnie
This isn't happening
Everybody is fucking me over
hate you all
Charles stands up
'm sorry, Ronnie, but it's time to go
Wait a minute
'll work for free, Mark
No, Ronnie
'll pay you
Nope
love you
Ronnie, Jesus have a little self- respect
You don't love me, Mark
Ronnie, it's over
Ronnie takes a deep breath
He stands up to leave
Ronnie starts to walk out, but stops
() 111
: Hey, Charles
Mark asked you down here in case  got out of hand
Well, get ready to earn your money
Ronnie cracks
He grabs a calendar and throws it on the ground in a violent baby-like outburst
Stop him
Charles tries to grab Ronnie, but Ronnie pushes him off
Ronnie knocks the framed pictures off of the wall
He then opens the door and slams it into the wall over and over again
That does nothing
Ronnie tries to rip the cushion on the chair
He looks ridiculous
Alright, Ronnie, that's enough
Ronnie stops and begins to cry
Then he runs out of the office in tears
'  - / Ronnie lies in his bed and we
: The sun rises and sets three times through the window of his bedroom, signifying that three days have passed
The whole time, Ronnie doesn't move from his bed
Until
Ronnie gets on his "nice" clothes, but they're a far cry from his Security Guard uniform
Ronnie's Mom comes up to him
What's on the agenda for today
guess maybe look for a job or something
Well,  know you're sad about it, but try to look on the bright side
() 112
: There is no bright side
My life is over
Ronnie, you may not be smart or handsome, but you've got dreams inside of you and dreams make you special
No matter what this world tries to throw at you, they can never take those dreams away
What the fuck are you talking about, Mom
don't know
'm drunk
just know that mothers are supposed to talk like that to their children when they're sad, so  tried
What do you want from me
Nothing
That's exactly what you're supposed to do
just blew my life
tried to be a big shot, a hero and a stupid cop wanted to be recognized for being great
should have just been happy where  was at
didn't do my duty
Ronnie, the other night when soiled my pants right before puked myself,  was thinking about how you would come home and find me and clean me up
knew you would be there to find me and take care of me, so  was able to pass out on the floor and not worry
If there's one thing you know about, it's duty
do it because  love you
know and  love you too,   Ronnie
haven't always been easy   to deal with and most people would   have thrown me away a long time   ago
() () 113
: (') Just like your father did
But not you, Ronnie
Look, whiskey was always the way  dealt with being a single mother, but as get older,  know that  can't keep doing this
've got everything  need with you
So want you to know that 'm ready to make a change
Your life needs to get easier and you don't need to take care of old Mom anymore
Are you going to quit drinking
'm switching to beer
can pound those all day and still keep my shit together
'm doing it for you
'm so proud of you, Mom
'm proud of you
Now today is a new day and we're going to get through it
Now, get out there and find what the world has in store for you
Ronnie's Mom leaves and Ronnie looks at himself in the mirror
Then something catches his eye
Ronnie sees a newspaper laying on the ground
He picks it up and reads
- Ronnie walks up the steps that lead to the local jail
- Ronnie walks into one of those booths where you can talk to a prisoner on the opposite side of a Plexiglas divider
Ronnie sits down in wait
Then, two appear escorting a handcuffed Dennis
Dennis takes a seat and picks up the phone
What's up, Ronnie
How you doing
() 114
: 've been better
You
'm holding it down in here
Yeah,  heard they finally caught up with you
know
should have hit Mexico, but, you know,  got stoned and just kind of kicked with this girl in Kannapolis for a while
You know they fired me when they found out you were the one who robbed the mall
Shit, dog
Sorry about that
It's cool, but  need to know why you did it
told you
'm an outlaw
Come on, Dennis
Man, you want to know the real reason
Yeah
Alright, 'll tell you
Man, that gig was one of the best jobs ever had
got to wear a uniform,  could smoke weed whenever  wanted
For once in my life,  felt like  was actually somebody
know most people don't think it's shit, but really loved it
Then, all of a sudden,  find out that your ass got promoted over me
() () 115
: (') After all  put into it, you're the one that makes it to Head of Mall Security
You know what it's like to get passed over, Ronnie
So  got pissed off
started robbing the joint as a way to get at them for what they did to me
But you know what, Ronnie
What's that
You ever love a girl so much that you can't break up with her, so the only thing you can do when she pisses you off is smack her in the goddamn face
No, Dennis,  haven't
Well,  have
And that's pretty much how  felt about the job
Thanks for talking to me, Dennis
Well, it's the least  could do after knocking you out and all
Ronnie starts to hang up the phone
Hey, Ronnie
Yeah, Dennis
Bail me out of here, old friend
can't do it, Dennis
You're now a criminal who stopped caring, but my crime is that  care too much
Ronnie hangs up the phone and walks out
116
- Ronnie comes into the mall and makes his way down the center of it, feeling naked without his uniform
Charles, now wearing a mall security uniform, comes out and stops Ronnie
Ronnie, what are you doing back here
just came to talk to Nell
Don't get your panties in a wad, 'm just here as any normal patron
Ronnie, dude, 've been all fucked up in the head
feel like shit about what happened
mean, here am, just looking to shuck responsibility and  ended up hurting you in the process
Look, should have been honest with you
don't give two shits about this stupid job
But you do
It's okay, Charles
've decided 'm going back to college
Getting stoned and studying beats this any day realize that now
realize that there aren't any jobs where you can avoid hard choices
Anyway, take as long as you want at the mall
'll keep Mark off your back
Thanks, Charles
-   - Ronnie sees Nell sitting down and eating a Cinnabon
Ronnie takes a seat at her table
Ronnie, what are you doing here
() 117
: got something  want to say
don't think we should be talking
'll be quick
Nell, this is the only job  was ever any good at
'm not a crime solver or right hand of the law
'm just a dumb guy in a uniform who can't even become a real policeman
Somewhere along the way  started to think  was something special, someone whose shit didn't stink, someone who deserved to date out of my league
You know, 've learned
My shit does stink
It smells horrible
And you're also out of my league, but for some reason, you like the smell of my shit
guess what 'm saying is
Ronnie reaches into his pocket and pulls out his Mother's disgusting yellow engagement ring, but for some reason, it looks beautiful
If you give me another chance, 'll spend the rest of my life making it up to you
And you can call me sweetie in front of people and 'll like it
Nell thinks about it
She leans over the table and kisses Ronnie
Ronnie is stunned
With one kiss, Nell seems to make everything okay
They stare at each other and the moment seems to hold for an eternity
Love is in the air until
- -
Nell
The Pervert runs
Ronnie gets pissed
Son of a bitch
() 118
: Oh, my God
Are you alright
'm fine
Shit, we should call somebody
Ronnie
Yeah
Go get him
Ronnie realizes that this is his duty and his alone
Ronnie rises from the table slowly
He looks at Nell and nods acceptance
Then, Ronnie runs after the Pervert
- The Pervert is in a full blown run through the mall
His trench coat is wide open and his wienie is flapping for the world to see
In a way, it's his greatest accomplishment
People scream
Mothers grab their daughters
No one is safe
: Ronnie comes ripping out of the food court
He's got a fierce look of determination in his eyes
He runs hard to catch up with the Perv
: There's a crowd surrounding the Cell Phone Kiosk
The Pervert bursts through the crowd and knocks people out of the way
What the fuck, man
() 119
: Ronnie comes running up behind him
Get out of the way
Get out of the way
The crowd totally clears a path for Ronnie, but Ronnie stops running and
Saddamn goes down hard and Ronnie rejoins the chase
Stay the fuck away from my wife
: runs past the skaters, who are hanging out on a bench
Dude, that's fucking disgusting
Ronnie comes running way far behind
Hey, Ronnie, here
Stevie slides his skateboard out for Ronnie to jump on
Ronnie jumps like he is going to land on the skateboard and sail to the finish line
However, when Ronnie's feet touch the board, it goes shooting out from under him
Ronnie slams onto the ground
All of the skaters start laughing
What a fucking douche
Ronnie picks himself up and starts to run again
He only makes it a little ways before he hits something slippery
Ronnie falls onto the ground and cracks his head
Ronnie lays on the ground and sees Ramon laughing against a wall with a mop in his hands
Okay, Ramon, we're fucking even
Ronnie picks himself up and starts running again
: 120
runs past '
He stops at the doorway and as if he can't resist, flashes the ladies in the store
He takes off running again
: as he runs by the  , which of course is Ronnie stops at the doorway
Turn it down
Turn it down
The Record Store guy turns the
Ronnie goes back to his chase
: runs past Mark
He looks around at all the people staring
Okay, show's over
Enjoy your shopping experience at Carolina Mall
Ronnie runs past Mark
Jesus
(calling out) Charles
Charles comes running up
What is it
Call the police
And go get Ronnie
He's trying to help
Just do what  ask you
Charles runs after them
Ronnie sees Charles coming and runs faster
Charles is moving in on him
() 121
: Hey, Ronnie
Ronnie turns around to see Charles as he flings him a giant flashlight
Ronnie catches it
Fuck yeah
Ronnie starts running again, but this time, he's a little more together
: has made his way through the whole mall at this point, but Ronnie is right on his ass
The Pervert is heading toward the
- The Pervert comes barreling in and the ladies at the perfume and make-up counters
He looks like he's charging straight at Brandi
He's getting closer
Ronnie comes in from the side and nails the Pervert with the flashlight
Ronnie jumps on top of the Perv and beats the ever-living shit out of him
This is a vision of a man leaving all out on the field
Ronnie stops pounding and looks up
He sees Brandi staring at him
Ronnie is overcome by anger and beats on the Pervert harder than ever before
Finally, Charles comes in and pulls Ronnie off of him
huge crowd has gathered around
Ronnie has blood all over him
Ronnie picks the Pervert up and holds him tightly by the arms
Mark comes running up
You want to report this to the police
Hell no
'm taking him down myself
Ronnie starts to walk away with the Pervert
() 122
: Hey, Ronnie
Ronnie stops and turns around
Mark tosses Ronnie a set of keys
Good job, Ronnie
Thank you, sir
Ronnie leads the Pervert outside
On the way, he passes Brandi
Good job, Ronnie
don't love you
don't love you either
Fine
The customers and employees of the mall  for Ronnie
This is his finest moment
: - Ronnie is stuck in traffic
He looks ridiculous in the orange golf cart on a city street with a Pervert chained up beside him, but Ronnie could care less
- The golf cart pulls up to the police station and Ronnie gets out with the Perv
Ronnie walks up the front steps and all of the officers part and let him through
Detective Harrison is at the top of the stairs
Ronnie walks right up to him
caught the Pervert
() 123
: see that
Well, you better turn him over to me and 'll take him inside and book him
Since you're a real Cop, right
Hey, Ronnie, you may not be an officer of the law, but you're the law's right hand
Good job
Ronnie lets go of the Pervert
He nods to Harrison, then turns his back and walks back down the steps
Ronnie gets into his golf cart and drives away
: - Ronnie stands in front of the Mall with Nell beside him
Ronnie looks nervous, but Nell looks down at her yellow ring with pride
She looks at Ronnie, sees a loose eyelash and brushes it off of him
What are you doing
You had an eyelash
'm trying to remember my speech
Sorry
Nell looks straight ahead, but smiles as Ronnie tries to take himself serious
Okay, Ronnie, we're ready for you
Ronnie takes a deep breath and walks over to where the has set up a camera and microphone
Okay, we rolling
Rolling
() 124
: Good evening
We're here today with Ronnie Barnhardt, head of Mall Security here at Carolina Mall
Last week, Ronnie was able to catch The single-handed and bring him to justice
Ronnie, how did you manage to find the identity of The Pervert and take him down
Well, being a mall security guard basically requires the same skill set that someone in say the has
You have to use logic and evidence and old-fashioned common sense as well as the latest technology to deduce the criminal mind
It's what  do
All of a sudden,     come up behind Ronnie
They look into the camera lens and start smiling
Ronnie turns around and sees them, but tries to focus on the reporter
Any last words for the folks at home
Yeah, 'd just like to say that Carolina Mall is back on track and safer than ever
The Skaters start flipping off the camera
Ronnie keeps getting distracted
In fact, there are some wonderful sales taking place right now
Stevie walks up behind Ronnie and pretends to hump him
So for all you families out there, come on down and see us
It's a wonderful place
Ronnie turns around angrily
' ,
() 125
: jump on their skateboards and skate off
Ronnie runs after them
He jumps into his   and gives chase
The   is still rolling
The looks into the lens
You heard it, folks
Everything is back to normal here at Carolina Mall
Back to you, Lindsay
