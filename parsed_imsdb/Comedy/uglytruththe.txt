Morning, Larry
'm sorry to do this to you, Abby, but  don't think  can work with her anymore
It's bad enough have to take her criticism at home
can't do it on air, too
man can only take so much
Abby nods, taking him seriously, but you can tell she's done this before
You're not a man, Larry
(off his look) You're a newsman
newsman isn't defined by the easy times, Larry, he's defined by the difficult ones
Can you imagine Ted Koppel or Chris Hansen or Anderson Cooper having their wives as co-anchor
Hell, no, because they couldn't handle it
But you can

Have you seen the ratings for yesterday
We got beat by all the network shows, plus a rerun of "Who's the Boss"
The one where the vacuum breaks
It's a temporary setback
This week we'll do better
The guy with the cable access show on Channel 83 does better
If we programed Jerry Springer re-runs, we'd do a nine share at a quarter the price
Abby looks worried
Please tell me you're not thinking of killing the show

You're good at what you do, but you've got to get me some numbers

And  really think that this could be our next boyfriend

Abby looks around, tense
You know what
This is not the best angle
We should get the table over there
Then we both get a view, instead of one of us looking at the busboy station
'm fine here
No, trust me
It'll be better over there
He looks at her like she's crazy, as they get up and move

Can  get you some water for the table
Bottle of flat, please
You know, they've done studies that show tap water is no different from bottled water
And they passed a law recently to have all restaurants filter their tap water
So, technically it's not tap water

Yeah,  still like the way it tastes better
Can  get you any cocktails
Scotch on the rocks
In your profile, you said you liked red wine
do,  just feel like having a scotch right now
She looks disappointed, then pulls out a piece of paper
(re the paper) Was there anything else you changed your mind about
mean, just so can figure it into the overall picture
You printed out my profile
Actually, my associate producer did
She likes me to be prepared
Not that 'm ever not prepared
Kudos on your comprehensive car insurance policy, by the way
That wasn't in my profile
No, but it was in your background check

tell me about yourself

Good point
There's an awkward silence between them
She pulls out another piece of paper, and hands it to him
printed out some talking points for us just in case this happened
take it it's happened before
No, but since you have nine out of ten of the necessary attributes on my checklist,  just wanted to make sure this goes as smoothly as possible
As Jim processes this, the waiter arrives with drinks
Thank you
He takes a huge sip, relieved
Abby looks at him
You realize the ice in that scotch is made from tap water, don't you
He looks at her, realizing she's a complete nightmare

Jim is walking faster than she is, trying to get away

With curry, you can't smell if it's gone bad, so after three days, you should just toss it
Really, don't even give it to a pet or anything
Three days
Got it
Abby has officially lost control to the producer part of herself
she knows what she's doing, but can't stop herself
Here, just to be sure, 'll write today's date on it for you
Abby takes a pen out and writes a date on the bag
(annoyed) It's fine, really
The bottom of the bag gives out and a container of goopy leftovers  all over Jim's lap

You want a relationship, here's how you get one: it's called a Stairmaster
Get on it and get skinny and get some trashy lingerie because at the end of the day, all we're interested in is looks
No one falls in love with your personality at first sight, they fall in love with your tits and your ass
And they stick around because of what you're willing to do with them
You want to win a man over

Men don't fall in love
Men fall in "want
" We want things
We're hunters and gatherers
We're the same as we were when we were cavemen and a gillion years of evolution hasn't done squat
Trust me, there was a Pamela Anderson of cave women and all the cave guys were trying to stick their dicks in her

You're not calling from Europe or anything
Are you interested in listening or not
No, please

He works out, not because he's vain, because it's healthy

Perhaps because your complete lack of any one of them is the real reason why women aren't interested in you

Make him look like a complete idiot
Not that it will be hard
The man is a moron of unseen proportions

Does anyone think my highlights are too shiny
Larry, listen to me
want Mike Alexander to go down in flames want Mike Alexander to be nothing but a pile of ash on the seat next to you
want the janitor to come in with his Dustbuster and vacuum up the ashes of Mike Alexander, and then when he throws the ashes into the dumpster outside,  want the rats to vomit and then defecate on the ashes of Mike Alexander

My point
My point is that your husband hasn't had sex with you in

Why is it my fault

Oh, dear God
Well, what am  supposed to do, give up the money, so he can get an erection

You've economically emasculated your husband to such a point that he's afraid to desire you
Sure, you can dump his ass, but honey, have you seen the eligible men in Albuquerque

Rule number one
Never criticize

Never
Men are incapable of growth, change or progress
For men, self- improvement ends at toilet- training
Rule number two
Laugh at whatever he says

No, but a fake orgasm is better than no orgasm at all
fake orgasm is no orgasm

Rule number three
Never talk about your problems
Men don't really listen or care
Some men care
No
Some men pretend to care
When we ask you how you're doing, it's just guy code for "let me put my dick in your ass
" Okay, 'm trying to decide whether should just walk away right now, or run

Srunchies
Nurse shoes

We can't be the exception to the rule, can we

You men that fit the criteria -- don't kid yourselves
They're not sleeping with you
They're sleeping with a carefully calculated set of venal choices
Money over substance
Looks over soul
Polish over principles
No gesture, no matter how real or romantic, will ever compensate for a really impressive list of credentials
Says the man who's never made a gesture except for this one -- She makes the universally known "jack-off" hand gesture
So, the elevator wasn't a gesture
The elevator was a moment of passion, followed by a moment of panic on your part, apparently

What elevator

came by your room
And then you ran away
Well, that wasn't panic, sweetheart
It was an unwillingness to compete with the walking checklist that was in your bed
You should be thanking me
, Joy taps her watch
We have ten seconds
An    walks up
Are we ready to soar up, up and away
, Mike looks at the camera
And that's the Ugly Truth, folks girl in heat for two guys will always pick the one with the better resume

That is bullsh -- The  of the  is suddenly fired, covering her violation
The cameraman follows the balloon as it slowly starts to rise
And we're out

(freaked) hate you so much  just swore on live television
No, you hate yourself for being so shallow
Off we go
Abby and Mike spin around to look at him
Realizing the balloon is now soaring upwards
Where are we going
'm not going anywhere with you
Mike starts to climb out
What a shock
You're bailing
wouldn't recommend that
Mike looks down to see -- They are now
And rising
He stops climbing, as the balloon continues to float up and away
(cont'd) So, who wants champagne
123
-   -  -                         123 Stuart and Cliff stare at the monitors, eating it up
They don't know the camera is on, do they

Hey
know -- we can pass the time with you telling me how much fun you and Colin had having sex in Los Angeles
broke up with Colin in Los Angeles, jackass
Mike is thrown, turning to look at her
What
To our left, we have the Sandia Mountains, glistening in the afternoon twilight
Abby ignores the pilot
Oh, that got your interest
If you think we're going to finish what we started in , you're out of your mind
You lost your chance
And to our right, you'll see the Rio Grande River winding its way through the diochramatic landscape
Mike ignores the pilot as well
never had a chance with you
And off in the distance, we have the Petroglyph National Monument, where -- (to the Pilot) Can you stop talking, please

had a momentary lapse in judgement where  thought you might be more than you are
But you aren't
Clearly
What does that mean
(mocking) "'m Mike Alexander
like girls in Jello
like to fuck like a monkey
Don't fall in love -- it's `scary

Don't worry,  saw this coming, so got us a three second delay
126
-  -  -                126 Mike glares at Abby
Yeah, it is "scary

Especially because 'm in love with a psycho like you

-  -  -           129 Abby stares at Mike
am not a psycho
just told you  loved you and all you heard was "psycho"
You are the definition of neurotic
The definition of neurotic is a person who suffers from anxiety, obsessional thoughts, compulsive acts and physical ailments without having any objective evidence of disease -- Again,  just told you 'm in love with you and you're standing here giving me a vocabulary lesson
(to the Pilot) Back me up on this, buddy
who here is afraid
'm just going to drink my champagne
(skeptical) You're in love with me
Really
Why
Beats the shit out of me, but  am
Abby opens her mouth, about to make a retort, then realizes what's been said to her
For the first time in her life, she stops thinking and -- Grabs Mike and kisses the hell out of him
The sheer force of her kissing  them into the pilot, causing -- The torch to  radically

(into phone) feel good about it
132
-  -  -              132 Abby finally loosens her grip on Mike
Hair askew, he looks a little like he's been hit by a cyclone
(breathless) If you say "just kidding", 'm going to throw you out of this balloon and watch your body splatter to the ground
Are you going to threaten me with death when we have sex
Because it might be distracting
The Pilot looks worried for his safety
May  suggest you wait until we land
Abby and Mike keep kissing as the balloon sails into the sunset, and we   , then   -- 133

Yes, women have a checklist, but sometimes that list includes a foul-mouthed idiot who took way too long to realize he was in love
(holds up a finger) Let's continue this conversation in a second
to  -- Mike is standing in a garden with rows and rows of seated behind him
An altar with flowers and a minister wait patiently
Mike gestures for the camera to follow him as he makes his way up to the altar
As he arrives he greets his groomsman, , also wearing a tux
He only has eyes for Joy, Abby's bridesmaid
(to Joy) Has anyone ever told you you have a stupendous bosom
Not lately, so feel free to say it again
string quartet's version of "   " begins, as we   to see -- , in a wedding dress, about to make her way up the aisle
Looking absolutely beautiful
(wowed; to camera) Zoom in on this, guys
want the whole city to see how lucky  am
The cameraman   on Abby, as she catches Mike's eye and smiles

Her date -- a dead ringer for Jim Morrison -- looks at her, amused

No one's ever going to believe this
need proof
, Abby finally arrives and looks at Mike
(re the cameras) What's this
Hope you don't mind, but we're live
(re the cameraman) No, what's Jorge doing so close
We need a master
(surprised) You knew about this
Hello
'm the producer
It's sweeps week
How do you think got them to pay for this
She gestures to --  and  from Corporate, who sit in the audience
Mike looks momentarily surprised, then -- God,  love you
He turns to the camera
So, here it is, guys
The games, the manipulation, the ploys, the tactics
all the things we do to think we're in control
But guess what
We never are
Abby leans over his shoulder
(to the camera) Isn't it beautiful
