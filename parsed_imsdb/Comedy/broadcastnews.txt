Brooks
- restaurant supply truck is curbside, near a small restaurant
, forty-one, is closing the back door of his truck, feeling good about the world, a common state for him
He moves towards the cab of the truck and gets inside as we : ,
- 1963 - As he sits down beaming over his recent good fortune
now we his twelve-year-old son, , seated quietly beside him
He seems a bit down
Gerald glances at his son
don't know a recent Saturday 've sold more
You didn't think 'd sell that health restaurant, did you
No
Not even you
Why so glum
don't know
(a beat) Go ahead
No, nothing
've got a problem, guess
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss
No
But, honest
What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks
don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick
" Gerald stiffs a grin
You know, Tom,  feel a little proud when people comment on your looks
Maybe you should feel that way
Proud
'm just embarrassed that like when they say those things
As long as that's your only problem you're
It's not
He looks directly at his father and talks quietly, and sincerely
got my report card
Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete
Oh my
see you studying so hard, Tom
What do you think the problem is
'll just have to try harder
don't know
will
(talking himself into it) will
will
will
He shakes his head for emphasis, glad he's received this pep talk from himself -- he hands the card to his father
Thanks, Dad, this talk helped
Will you sign it, please
(as he signs) Would it help if  got you a tutor
(suddenly hopeful) That would be great
(worried) It better help
What can you do with yourself if all you do is look good
-- "  " ,
- 1965 -  - , looking almost preposterously young in his graduation gown -- is delivering his valedictory
He is a rare bread -- a battle-scarred innocent
and finally to the teachers of Whitman High School,  don't have the words to express my gratitude which may have more to say about the quality of the English Department here than my own limitations
He awaits a laugh and gets only the weird sound of collective discomfort
that was, of course, not meant to be taken seriously
personal note
am frequently asked what the special difficulties are in being graduated from High School two months shy of my fifteenth birthday
sometimes think it was the difficulties themselves which enabled me to do it
If 'd been appreciated or even tolerated wouldn't have been in such a hurry to graduate
hope the next student who comes along and is able to excel isn't made to feel so much an outcast
But 'm looking forward to college; this is the happiest day 've had in a long time
thank you and  forgive you
This is very little applause
'm always so confused by Aaron
Is he brave and earnest or just a conceited little dick-head
: "   " As Aaron walks to his seat past three full grown tough looking semi-literate high school graduates
#1 Later, Aaron
- Clusters of graduates at the fence bordering the sunken school yard looking down as the tough cap and gowners seen earlier cuff Aaron around
Aaron feeling from a blow -- his lip bleeding -- his teeth covered with blood
as he gets to his feet
He is livid -- something primal triggered by this brutality
Go ahead, Stephen -- take your last licks
(points at his face) But this will heal -- what 'm going to say to you will scar you forever
Ready
Here it is
He dodges as they come after him
They catch him by the hair and hurl him to the ground
As he gets up he hurls his devastating verbal blow
You'll never make more than nineteen thousand dollars a year
Ha ha ha
They twist his arm and grip him -- his face scraped on the concrete
Okay, take this:  You'll never leave South Boston and 'm going to see the whole damn world
You'll never know the pleasure of writing a graceful sentence or having an original thought
Think about it
He's punched in the stomach and sinks to the ground
As the Young Toughs walk off Aaron catches a phrase of their conversation
Nineteen thousand dollars
Not bad
,  - 1968 - , ten years old, is in her room typing
Above the desk where she works is a bulletin board with letters and pictures tacked to each one
Her desk has several file racks which contain bulging but neat stacks of air mail envelopes -- a roll of stamps in a dispenser is to one side
Jane types very well in the glare of her desk lamp
(voice over; as she types) Dear Felatzia, it's truly amazing to me that we live a world apart and yet have the same favorite music
loved the picture you sent and have it up on my bulletin board
You're growing so much faster than am that
Jane's  standing near the door
(voice over) am starting to get jealous
read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan
hope you weren't
(softly) Honey
Jane , and grabs her heart, breathing heavily, babbles nervously at her Dad
Oh God -- Daddy -- don't
don't
don't ever scare me like that -- please
We :  "   " Her father is himself taken aback with the shock of her reaction
Falling back towards the door: Jane -- For God's sake
(recovering) Look, it's time for you to go to sleep
just have two more pen pals and then 'm done
You don't have to finish tonight
(he doesn't get in) Nooo
This way the rotation stays the same
Finish quickly
don't want you getting obsessive about these things
Good night
We   Jane who has obviously become disconcerted and troubled
- As Jane moves to room at the other end of the hall -- a family room where her Father reads the latest Rolling Stone of the mid-60's -- Hunter Thompson, the New Journalism, the slim Jann Wenner -- Jane bursts into the room
Dad, you want me to choose my words so carefully and then you just throw a word like 'obsessive' at me
Now, unless 'm wrong and
(enunciating) please correct me if  am, 'obsession' is practically a psychiatric term
concerning people who don't have anything else but the object of their obsession -- who can't stop and do anything else
Well, Here  am stopping to tell you this
Okay
So would you please try and be a little more precise instead of calling a person something like 'obsessive
' She advances furiously on her Father since even this strung out, even with two additional pen pal letters to get off, she had enough sense of duty to kiss him good night before storming from the room
She exits the room
Stay on  as we begin  : -  - Emerging from the blackness -- Jane Craig -- now a twenty-eight-year-old woman -- a long speed walker wearing a jacket to which reflecting stripes have been glued -- the kind of gear only possessed by someone who runs at off-hours
The Jacket itself is a wish--had-it souvenir from some important news assignment, the sort of treasure you love about all else yet never mention
She stops running as she feeds quarters into the first of a phalanx of newspaper machines -- getting seven different papers before moving on
- As she enters from the bathroom, having showered and dressed
The sun is jus now rising
She sits next to her phone
:  ' The Filofax book is almost an additional character -- a crucial hand-fashioned tool of Jane's trade
She flicks at a page -- takes down a typewritten sheet scotch-taped to it showing the room number of her crew and reporter
As she dials one room number
(into phone) Hi
It's me
- -- his equipment in evidence though essentially asleep holding his bedmate's hand, as he listens to Jane
' (voice over) It's thirty minutes before you have to meet me in the lobby -- nudge your wife
There's probably no time to eat
but there's a cafeteria at the bus depot once we get down there love working with you two
It saves me a call
She dales
Where Aaron is switching his  from station to station, monitoring the early morning news
His
Hi
Turn on your
Good Morning America , the Morning News and Today are all about to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger and  think he's live on at least two of them
At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic
(Austrian accent) Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now
But he's not ever gonna change
He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie
He feels no different
He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully
half hour in the lobby
(Austrian accent) Okay, 'll see you in the lobbies [ sic ]
She hangs up -- takes the phone off the hook and lays it on the bed for a moment's solitude
She sits stiffly, palms on top of her legs
It looks like someone with unusually good posture, waiting for something, and now we    the first signs redden and she begins to cry
Now she sobs -- then miraculously shakes it off and exits quickly to the bathroom
This crying episode is clearly part of her morning routine
- Jane standing behind her husband-wife - camera-sound team as they train their attention on Aaron; who is getting ready to do a stand-up
There is a  off to one side
Aaron holds his microphone at the ready
Ready
Your hair's a little funny
It's an ethnic curl,  can't do anything about it
In front of a little -- it's a bit
You want a mirror
No -- Don't worry about it
Let's do this
Jane nods her assent
Okay
In other times, for other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for
Singer's return from war
He
(interrupting) 'm sorry
But look at how wonderful his face is
She points to the derelict
Oh, you mean use him
That's nice
Okay
'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good
In other times, with other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for
Singer's return from war
Last week he was decorated by a president for heroism in a war
But it was the civil war -- in Angola -- and he was in it for the money
He puts the microphone down
Thanks
He passes a vending machine and checks the stray hair
- Jane in the distant b
g
on the phone
Aaron and crew shooting as the bus pulls up, hisses to a stop and tired, rumpled passengers exit the bus
, strong, 9'6" figure emerges and is displeased to find a camera trained on him
He reacts with all the grace of a short mercenary
Go 'way
gets his luggage from the compartment under the bus
The crew shooting
Just a few questions
No
He starts walking -- the four person newsteam staying with him
We came from Washington
Move away from me
(holding out microphone) How long has it been since you've been home
(moving) Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
Fuckes
Snot
Fuckee
You want to use that
It depends on how big a news day it is
They reach Jane
She calls to him
'm Jane Craig
spoke to you in Angola
gave you some sugarless gum and Handi-Wipes
As he reacts to her: '  - Jane sitting next to Aaron making detailed timing notes as she screens the material shot that day on a portable monitor unit
Where's where  asked him about being scared
(then) You should work on your speech
No
It makes me nervous to think about it
Let's do this
She consults her notes and goes back to the exact spot
(on tape) All this business of war -- do you get scared
(on tape; he smiles) Uh-uh
(then) 'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though
He laughs self-consciously and turns briefly away
love that turn away
- Jane is at the lectern in the darkened auditorium as two large monitors display some taped news pieces she has assembled
On the lectern is a sign telling us we are at the Conference of Local Television News Broadcasters
(in darkness) There's a point 'm trying to make about these pieces coming up
'  blacked out from behind -- her (o
s
; angrily) don't think any client of mine makes less than fifty thousand dollars a year which means they can afford the best and you're damn right  feel good that that includes me
: - in blackness, her
(o
s
) No
You'd be surprised at who a working girl meets
've been a working girl for what
-- over a year anyway and that must be a thousand men and  don't think there's an age or type that hasn't been in there
' (voice over) Policemen
-- Doctor
-- Lawyer
(o
s
) Oh, sure
Television reporters
laugh from the audience
There is a: : - in blackness
(o
s
) 'm seventeen now and 've been working the streets for two years and  guess to be honest --  stopped thinking of it as temporary
The lights come up on the room
The two screens go black
there is general
Jane blinks nervously
Please don't applaud
Sitting in groups of three --   from around the country, remarkably similar in comparison
a great looking woman, good looking man (either young or attractively avuncular) and a Black or Hispanic
They still  -- not yet having grasped the sincerity of Jane's plea which she presses with more urgency
Please
Don't
(she yells) gathered these pieces as an example of what's with local television news
The applause stops
The excerpts from on prostitution were broadcast by all stations in one city during sweeps week
By what bend of either or suspension of duty is that broadcast news
She pauses half a beat for possible applause -- hearing none, she continues
An anchorman sneezes -- four people shout "gesundheit" simultaneously -- they laugh
The legacy of Edward
Murrow, Eric Sevareid, William Shirer, David Brinkley and Walter Cronkite is being squandered in a desperate popularity contest
Our profession is in danger: As Jane continues,  that the news team now have even more in common
They do not like Jane
Yesterday's compliment has somehow managed to become today's kiss of death
To be considered a serious journalist is no longer flattering
It presents the risk of being labeled ponderous, or worse yet, elitest, right
Women playing with their hair, young man bored
one middle-aged anchorman fusses with a spot on his tie
Briefly departing from text
All of you know what 'm talking about
We're all trying to act together than we are
But we care
So, we're all secretly terrified, aren't we
Not a peep -- she is thrown but doggedly presses on with her prepared speech though her throat constricts a bit, her voice begins to rasp
We are being increasingly influenced by the star system
The network anchormen are so powerful they compromise our last best hope
The current group is clearly qualified, tied still to our best traditions, but who follows these men
Seated with other members of his news team, a young blonde woman whose hand is resting on his inner leg, a good looking Hispanic
Tom feels a growing excitement -- Jane is not just a speaker, she seems a savior
Wow
His female colleague looks at him
Oh, 've known so many women like that
They don't like their looks so they're angry
Fumbling with her cards, sunk but game -- gamer than she would wish
was going to talk about other trends but
(mumbling) the magazine shows, news at profit, influence of Entertainment Tonight , the danger, the hope, the dream, the question
Oh, was going to show you a tape -- a story that was carried by all networks on the same night -- the same night -- not one network noted a major policy change in Salt Two nuclear disarmament talks
Here's what they ran instead
Go ahead
Show the tape
Showing the Japanese Domino Championships as broadcast by all networks in the Spring of 1985
It is quite spectacular -- the dominoes falling into one another provoking waves, crossing tiny bridges, setting off little fireworks
'  applauds loudly and squeals with delight
Jane between the two monitors
She begins to speak loudly the   of approval
(loudly) know it's good film
know it's fun
like fun
It's just not news
(as they continue to applaud) Well, you're lucky you love it -- you're going to get a lot more just like it
-  "" Jane sitting rocked into momentary catatonia, by the event
Dazed as an animal stung by a tranquilizer dart
She takes some irregular breaths waiting for normal life to return
Tom the last person remaining in the room
He approaches her -- she is totally unaware of his presence, even when he casually mounts the stage with an athletic leap
It takes courage for Tom to fully intrude himself, which he now does: Hello
She looks up at him
Earnest, nervous -- handsome
Just when she needed a mirage there it is
Hi
just wanted to tell you  how great you were
My name's Tom Grunick
(dumbly) Thank you
(then) They hated me
don't hate them
Well, they say if you can reach even one person, it means something
And you did that
Jane looks up at his smile -- a beat then: Would you like to have dinner with me
- Jane arrives at the maitre d' stand
She has attempted to dress up to the extent that  packing for a short-day trip allows
She looks for Tom
Tom rises from a table and is immediately at her side
Hi
was worried  was early
was a lot earlier
They are lead to a table and sit down
kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight
More than a great break, maybe just what  needed
just when needed it
Angel of mercy -- godsend
lifesaver
what
(picking one) like "godsend
" haven't been in news that long
've just been looking for the right person to talk to
have about two thousand questions for you
He notices that her head has gone into her hands where it continues to rest
He looks at her a beat
It's possible now's not the right time
She lifts her head
If we could just eat first
Totally understood
Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had
Totally sorry
Nooo
If  could just have a roll, 'd be okay
She takes a roll from the roll plate
He smiles at her
She takes a bite
Thank you
- As they walk along -- dumping occasionally and self-consciously
Jane is feeling a version of being turned on -- that is, a little adrift and temporarily free of obligations
She is open to making a memorable mistake
Another thing  can't stand -- Is this dull
Tom shakes his head almost violently
No, no, no, no
Jane looks at him curiously -- then: (broadly) Another thing  can't stand is when White House reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as "White House" sources say
That actually goes on
Yes
My room is down here -- 'm not tired
Do you want to keep talking
Yes, sure
'  - small good room -- her working paraphernalia very much in evidence
the quality briefcase
the reams of well organized notes
the thick contact book -- Jane is sitting on the bed -- Tom, not far away in the room's only chair
One lamp is on and it serves to place Jane in the shadows and cast Tom in an enormously flattering light
comes from her miniature portable  system
Come on
Even 'm not that hard on myself
No,  really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up
Jane smiles a calming smile
was doing sports at the station
The newspaper ran this untrue story that  was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail
So they made me anchor
So great -- right
Except 'm no good at what 'm being a success at
How are you at back rubs
Jane shifts her position so that her back is to Tom
He is immobilized by the sudden turn
Jane waits, just a bit longer than it would take a man to run from the chair to her side before experiencing the ghost-like clutch of rejection
She moves briskly past the moment -- grabbing a "good night" chocolate from the pillow and munching it as she return to his agenda
It's sort of normal -- the way you feel
In graduate school everyone thought the only mistake the admission committee made was letting them in
He moves to the bed
Listen to me
You keep on thinking 'm somebody ho lacks
confidence
That's not it
know  can talk well enough and 'm not bad at making contact with people, but  don't like the feeling that 'm pretending to be a reporter
(cont'd) And half the time  don't really get the news 'm talking about
It isn't that 'm down on myself
Trust me, stink
(levelly) trust you
didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports
wasn't bad
thought  was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and
(interrupting) What about the obvious remedy
Reversing things
Maybe getting a job on a newspaper
don't write
Jane laughs or, more accurately, scoffs as Tom Continues
But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks
Well, come on -- it is your life
Nobody is tying you to the fast track
Did you go to college
One year
almost one year
So, you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write
He nods agreement
And 'm making a fortune
Jane laughs very briefly -- then rubs her face vigorously with her hands
He's making her feel a little crazy
She gets off the bed
It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that truly think is dangerous
Uh-huh
(holding it in) agree with you -- you're not qualified
(letting it out) So get qualified
You can insist on being better prepared
You don't have to just leave it as
(mimicking him) ' don't write
'm not schooled
don't understand the news 'm reading
But at least 'm upset about it, folks
' beat, then he mumbles softly to himself
Whoa, this was a mistake
Just what do you want from me, anyway
Permission to be a fake
Stop whining and do something about it
He gets up to leave
She follows him
Well, you don't have to start right now
He turns to her
hated the way you talked to me just now
and it wasn't just because you were right
He exits
'  - She is on the phone
(into phone) No
It wasn't just the speech -- the same thing happened with this guy
have passed some line some place
am beginning to repel people 'm trying to seduce
'  - As he talks with Jane
(agreeably) He must have been great-looking, right
Why do you say that
Because nobody invites a bad- looking idiot to their bedroom
She smiles
Okay
Let's do me
Sure
Okay
feel like 'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high
This conversation is not worthy of you
'd give anything if that were true
(laughing) Good night
Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive
If needy were a turn-on
Call if you get weird
'  - She hangs up -- pulls back the bedspread on the double bed -- on the other half are papers, schedules -- tapes
She doesn't clear them off so that she is literally sleeping with her work
The
(answering) was just thinking it was the shortest phone conversation we ever had
deserted well-lit area
Tom on the phone
never told you the reason  was telling you everything for
(pleasantly surprised it's him) Hey
: Those audition tapes  sent out
've been hired by your network for the Washington bureau
So 'll probably see you at work
Sorry
Jane is rocked and soured
What
- Jane and Aaron walking to work -- agitated
They didn't hire Peter Stiller from the Times and he had a great audition tape
You want to start going over who they could have gotten
They can't take on people like this for network news
For God's sake
What's going on
- Tom arrives for first day of work
' is the network's Washington Bureau Chief
He is in his early 60's, has worked for the network about 40 years -- part of the golden age -- a family man, an honorable man, a good guy
Right now he is welcoming Tom to the network thereby good-naturedly helping with the destruction of all he holds dear
As he hands Tom his credentials: Any particular area you feel strongest in
To be honest,  was best at anchor
Ernie gives him a long look -- is he kidding
Why don't you take a few days observing the system
Then we'll put you on general assignment
- Two small  monitors -- a smallish room
Jane goes over her timing notes which correspond to the time code  on the monitors
-- an extraordinarily silent man -- is doing Jane's bidding
On the monitor we  the mercenary piece which Jane is editing against a tightening deadline
The periodically -- Jane conducting abrupt conversations which continuing to edit
The pressure is palpable to begin with but builds and builds; almost like a family fight getting out of hand and threatening to bend lives
Through it all, Jane remains remarkable calm
Her focus is amazing; her command sexy
(consulting notes) Go back to 316, Bobbie
The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, ' don't know how 'll feel
' We could
(interrupting) Please, Bobbie, we're pushing
As Bobbie expertly reverses the tape, Tom's face appears in the glass doorway and then he enters the already crowded room -- Jane's eyes click to him briefly
She makes not a move to welcome him
He pauses, but is committed and tries to find a piece for himself against the wall
They said  should observe the
Jane is distracted by the noise
Tom leaning over towards her
They said it would be okay if
(incredulous) We're working here
You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh
She momentarily can't think of the word 'corner
'  Then back to Bobbie: Play back the last line
He said something about
(sharply) Let me hear it
Bobbie, taking the sharp commands with ever increasing, yet still repressed resentment
The Assistant Director,  , enters the editing room
She is about 26 and every night since she got her job as Assistant Director she has been the first to crack under pressure
We'll need it in ten minutes
We're putting it directly into
Jane holds up a finger of warning to Blair as she picks up a ringing phone and talks to Bobbie at the same time
(into phone) Craig, just a second -- (to Bobbie) Let me hear it
Through much of this chaos we focus on: Wedged into an uncomfortable position between two tape racks -- He is wide-eyed at this circus of tension and fear
His eyes dart around constantly -- trying to take in as much as he can, always returning with wonder to focus on Jane
(voice over) It's been a long time since 've seen my folks and all but
don't expect any big-deal homecoming
Stop there
(into phone she's been holding) want to shoot a picture from a book  have in the office
You don't have time
Not a chance
(into phone) 'll be right down
It's right tight
She crosses out
've got to tell Ernie
because there isn't enough time
Yes, there is
Blair leaves, as Jane gathers up her notes
She charges out leaving Tom awkwardly along with Bobbie
'm Tom Grunick
started on General Assignment today
Bobbie stops the machine, turns in his chair and shakes hands
Then he smiles secretly and speaks his first full sentence
don't think she's going to make it
Tom exits
Aaron is having a theoretical discussion with Ernie and , a correspondent in her early 40's, a pioneer beauties in news
She is well-schooled, bred, trained and known
, a black correspondent in his 40s, and , formerly with the Johnson administration -- State Department correspondent for the network
Okay, what about this
Here's a tough ethical one
Would you tell a source that you loved them just to get some information
Yes
Yes
Me too
Sure
Jennifer didn't know there was an alternative
Jennifer laughs that laugh one always hopes beautiful women will laugh when one says something funny
Aaron smiles at her
Here's one
They allow us to have cameras at an execution in Florida
Do you broadcast tape of the guy  in the chair when they turn on the voltage
Sure
Why not
Absolutely
You bet
Nothing like wrestling with a moral dilemma is there
Blair enters the scene, Tom trailing several feet behind, continuing to monitor the budding deadline crises
Excuse me, Ernie, we're several minutes to air and Jane's shooting an insert still for tonight's piece
She knows how much time she has
Blair flashes a tortured smile -- panic is growing
Okay
just wanted you to know
What is she shooting
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming
' (thinks then) Oh, that's nice
(walking away) We'll need some new lines
- Jane up against it now -- but still seemingly calm
Tom watching, keeps on glancing at the clock fascinated, impressed
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell
Should
(interrupting) Just a two-second dissolve
(hurting) Oh, Jesus, we have three minutes
Why do you do this to me
Is it because  won an award
- Where Aaron is writing his last line on a folded over piece of paper even as he gets ready to record
He times it with a stop watch
Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait of a Homecoming The return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war
Tearful women, proud men, excited children
But
Singer was right -- his homecoming was no big deal
- We have a minute and a half
It's my responsibility to tell them we won't be ready
Uh-uh
We're be ready
Blair glances frantically at her watch
In 84 seconds
Sweeping from 28 minutes to -- 84 seconds from deadline
Aaron walks in, Jane looks up
(hopefully) Nine seconds
Eleven and a half
Oh, God
Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie
You're saying 'Oh, God
"  They are going to go to up and the screen will be black -- they're going to go to black because we're not there
How about careers, huh
How about careers
42 seconds away
We're not going to make it
Bobbie makes a small bobble -- Jane giving the merest evidence of the strain, scratching her face repeatedly
Whoops
(unravelling) Whoops
Whoops
No, please
no, ooh, ahhh, ohhh
Shit, shit, shit
(caught up) You're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do
And as the pitch reaches its zenith, 27 seconds left
Bobbie hands the tape to Blair
Ready
- Blair hikes up her skirt and takes off
Our "chase scene" as Blair soars through the newsroom, leaping a chair smoothly, smashing her leg against a table in full flight, the adrenaline deadening the pain -- she arrives at a waiting elevator -- uses a key dangling from her neck to unlock it
jumps nervously during the ride and now, in   , barrels down the long corridor heading to the control room where she arrives; slamming the tape into a technician's hand even as it is introduced on the air
- Aaron, Jane, the others looking at the end of the piece on the air -- Tom in the b
g
as Blair enters -- relaxed, almost jaunty
was a little nervous there for a minute
Oh, come on -- tell us another
The end of the piece -- the Rockwell painting giving way to the mercenary's actual homecoming which matches the portrait
The irony works nicely
The network anchorman comes up for his close
, 50 years old and able to flutter much younger pulses
He is able and experienced -- a reporter who has become a journalistic king
(on monitor, smiling) Bill Rorish
Thank you
Good night
Look at that smile
Oh, that was good and oh my, Bill smiled -- he liked it
He loved it
Big smile
He gives Jane a congratulatory sock in the shoulder which she returns -- Tom in the b
g
of the
haven't seen Bill smile like that in weeks
Ernie has walked a few steps to the office
Ernie, you missed his close
He smiled
(mimicking) Thank you
Good night
She smiles
saw the smile -- good piece
'm gonna go look at it again
They leave -- Aaron waving to Tom who stands in the b
g
The others leave
Tom approaches Jane
'm sorry if  was in the way
It was totally impressive
Great piece
(somewhat formal) You weren't
Thanks
How does it feel being here
can't believe 'm really here
No kidding
If you're through work now -- No
Aaron and  go to Central America on Wednesday -- so 'm cramming
thought you were incredible in there
know how much  have to learn
'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it
if
'Really a lot appreciate it
' You  make me nervous
Anyway if can pick your brain -- Jane grimaces at "pick your brain
" can't help you, sorry
'm not here to teach remedial reporting
And it has nothing to do with the fact left your room instead of staying there
Jane looks at him
Oh, please
(then, almost gently) You're gonna have to understand something
This isn't personal
She exits
- As Aaron, Jane and their  march along with a   deep in their own conversation
Except for the  of they seem almost like a cranky married couple on their way to work
didn't sleep
They're giving me less and less air time
They don't think 'm at all anchor material
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me
You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap
(suddenly reacting) Oh good
They have entered a clearing where supplies have been dropped, the Guerrillas already tearing apart boxes with army boots inside
guerrilla soldier rubbing his shoeless foot
pair of new boots sit alongside him
Jane's Cameraman prepares to shoot, saying in Spanish, then English: Put on the boot
Jane rushes into the scene incensed
Stop
We are not here to stage the news
Wait and see what he does
Then to the totally confused soldier
(cont'd) Sir, you do whatever you want
It's your choice
By now there is a fair-sized cluster of armed men as well as the news team staring at the guerrilla, who is at loss as to what is expected
He looks to Jane, who can offer no help save her own determination not to interfere
Finally he puts on the boot
(to Cameraman) Okay
He shoots the scene
Tom, in shirt and tie, is on the phone
This is a big day
Okay, 'll meet the crew there then
Could you give me that address again
Great
Yes, it's good to finally be getting to work
Okay that's 17204
1-7-2-0-4
Thanks
- As Tom gets directions from the
It's only ten minutes if you prefer to walk
(as he walks away) 'll look for you on the news tonight
- Tom has a real sense of the moment -- of having arrived
The strange bubble of pleasure rises to the surface as he walks off to cover his first story
He laughs out loud, loving his lot
- Jane in the f
g
with her crew while Aaron talks in rapid Spanish to the
(in Spanish) Are you guys kidding or do you really think you'll run into something
mean, do you feel that every time and it never happens
Or is it the first time it felt that way and it's going to happen
mean, how bad can it be
Are you nervous
What's the chances on a scale of one to ten -- that we're going to be in a war within the next few hours
Really
He starts to walk towards Jane -- one of the men he was talking with calling after him with an added thought
Thanks, you speak English very well too
(to Jane) Great news
He says they've been engaging the Sandinistas pretty regularly and that he'd be really surprised if we didn't take fire tonight
Jane reacts -- a flash of exhilaration
Aaron is amazed at her attitude
Look at her
(to Jane) If anything happens to me tell every woman 've ever dated  was talking about them at the end
That way they'll have to reevaluate me
Jane laughs out loud, attracting the Guerrillas' attention
Aaron repeats his speech in Spanish
The Guerrillas laugh
- Aaron and Jane in line behind the Guerrillas
They
The head of the patrol gestures -- deploying his men
Aaron grabs Jane and heads for some cover to the left
As they run -- more
Jane in work mode
As soon as they settle
Let's tape
(Spanish accent) Much too dark
Black
That's okay
As they start taping he is breathless with the nervousness of the nearly gunfire
The first shots were fired not thirty seconds ago
The Contras feel they must be outnumbered this is so small a unit:  that's a given
Still they hold their ground despite the fact that their weapons have been acting up -- misfiring or jamming
new shipment of rifles is expected tomorrow -- all they got today were the shoes
There is the
(to Cameraman) Okay
(to Aaron) Great line at the end
Did you shoot their boots
Of course
We can cut back at the end
To the pan of the supplies boxes -- Can you believe it
just risked my life for a network that tests my face with focus groups
- Tom, squashed in amidst a small mob of reporters
behind a police line
He  a reporter next to him say: think he's coming out now
(to his crew) They say he's coming out now
surge
(to Reporter) Is that him
' Yes
Tom checks his notes
- ' The same model we've seen Jane use
list of questions written in big color highlighted letters
As he looks down to study them, everyone else moves suddenly off
'
The mass of journalists and technicians shouting questions
"Will you dispatch troops
" after the Ambassador they've been awaiting -- clumping on his limo and then being shaken by the movement of the vehicle
Standing alone and forlorn as his crew trots back
(observing Tom) What's wrong
had a lot of questions here missed the story
Don't worry, it's okay
got a piece of his face
- Jane is standing -- talking to her crew
Others asleep in b
g
-- a drowsy, morning-after feeling
Are you all packed and ready
The stuff in the dark is not good
Nobody wants news lit like that
Will you just get packed
She waves him off -- then she walks several yards away, holding a knapsack in her hand
She takes off a brush and runs it through her hair -- opens a plastic case and takes out a travel toothbrush, brushes her teeth and rinses her mouth with water from her canteen
She puts everything back in place, then looks about, sobs for several beats
One of the Guerrillas hears her sobbing and enters the scene -- he stands a respectful distance away
Jane finishes, notices him, makes a face by way of explanation, and exits the scene feeling measurably better
- The Washington Control Room
Jennifer, Jane, Aaron, Blair stand watching the intro to the Central American piece
Tom stands in the distant b
g
There are over a dozen monitors -- including one which is constantly on the anchor man, Bill Rorish
Bill Rorish on camera -- an  behind showing Aaron in blackness planted into a Central American map bordered by rifles
separate monitor shows the  alone
(voice over) fire fight along the Nicaraguan border
in one minute
The          --   Aaron's dim outline and  him say: (voice over; on camera) The first shots were fired not thirty seconds ago
The  " "    ever-so-briefly
The      -- as Blair screams enthusiastically
Great graphic, great graphic
Ernie
He kisses Jane in greeting -- pats Aaron on the back
You finally got a piece in a few minutes early and  hear Bill loved it
Jennifer gives Jane a mock pat on the back
(continuing) have somebody downstairs who one of the clerks brought in and vouches for
He says he has something to say about gays getting promotions at State
It can't hurt to tape him
As she feels Tom staring at her -- turns and notices him for the first time
Hi
How's it going
Can  buy you dinner sometime soon
(thrown) just got back --  don't know which end is up
Okay
In the b
g
Bill Rorish on one monitor as he picks up the phone at his anchor desk, during the commercial break
Jane
Bill Rorish wants to speak to you at the break
(as she hands it to her) never heard of him handing over compliments in the middle of the show
There is a stillness in the Control Room as Jane speaks to the anchor man in New York who    on a monitor
We see Bill Rorish
(into phone) Jane
(into phone) Yes
(into phone) Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, 'm going to have to bring you up here to New York
(into phone) Thanks
just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds
Blair cringes at Jane's blunt reply
(into phone) But thanks
(over phone) Well, the visual with the boots at the end was just perfect
Jane covers the mouthpiece and turns to Aaron
God, he loved the boots
Aaron reaches happily for the phone
(into phone) Aaron should be hearing this so have an extra witness
(over phone) Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you
(into phone) No,  don't
He happens to deserve the credit
He's right here
(over phone) 'll speak to you soon We see Rorish over the monitor
He hangs up
(to Aaron) He had to read over some new copy
We see on the monitor that this is not so
It's a very eggy moment Aaron
Tom breaks the silence
(to the rescue) Okay if  watch you tape that interview downstairs
Yeah
As he passes Jane he leans next to her and   him
Please laugh so they think 'm not dying inside but have so much style just said something funny
Jane does her part enormously well -- laughing with amusement
but her eyes blaze -- her friend has been needlessly humiliated
Blair wants desperately to be inside Aaron's joke
What did he say
(as if still amused) 'll never tell
- waits alone
watches him
He is well dressed, exceedingly nervous
He summons the courage to ask a question
Could  see how  photograph
Huh
Sorry
'Cause for the interview they're going to use a screen and disguise me to protect my anonymity so could see myself before that
Sure
The Camerawoman punches a button and immediately Buddy's image comes up on a standing monitor on the studio floor
He's not happy with the image -- but works at concealing his reaction -- gasping a bit of air -- trying to touch it
Aaron enters
Tom smiles a friendly smile which flusters Buddy momentarily
But again he almost manages to conceal his private rush
Buddy's internal drama is such he invariably finds himself covering up, fearful roomfuls of people will simultaneously guess his thoughts
Aaron directs him behind a screen and looks at his notes
It's Mr
Buddy Felton
Yes
That's your full name
Yes
might as well ask you the questions on tape
Is that all right
Yes
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department
was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times
Eventually rising to
Office Bimbo
(curbing his amusement) No, 'm sorry
Aaron is having a hard enough day,  He is visibly annoyed
You're saying the fact that you're gay had something directly to do with your promotions
Eventually rising to
don't know
(scratches his head) don't know numbers
Tom laughs
Aaron shoots him a look
You're saying the fact that you're gay had something directly to do with your promotions
don't like the word gay
Which would you prefer
Ravenous homosexual
Stop the tape, okay
Forget it, Ellen
Let's call security and get him out
As Aaron walks out -- Tom is momentarily fixed on the sight of Buddy walking in small circles giving himself a talking to
(self flagellating) Great time to act out, Buddy
You won't be happy until you turn the whole world off
He notices Tom
They're not really going to call security are they
No,  don't think so
How do  get out of here
Follow me
(dazzled) You talked me into it
- Tom distracted -- his day has been a bit of a bummer
Buddy self conscious -- the proximity creating an almost unbearable tension of romance and adventure
- Guard on duty -- a
She sees Buddy
Oh, you're the gay guy
was just coming to find you
'm leaving
(to Guard) It's okay
- Walking
Buddy in step with him
Sir
Tom turns
Buddy talks rather quickly -- He cares very much about leaving Tom with the right impression
The last words of his speech he hadn't expected to say
(cont'd) Thank you for not shunning me and all
(more) really did have all that information but  thought  might just be being vindictive to get a little hunk of the ol' spotlight
know, horrible -- but  didn't do it, so okay
And thanks again and would you like to have a drink -- at a regular bar
Oh, sure
Okay
His heart racing, Buddy attempts casual matter-of-factness
Is there a regular bar around here
/
- Tom and Buddy on adjoining stools
For Tom, the last weeks have been humbling, antagonistic
He's enjoying Buddy who listens attentively and wholeheartedly endorses every word Tom speaks
've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me
'm in no rush for anything
It's just the snotty attitude, even if  have it coming, it's still
Bad manners
Yes
That's right
know
mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight
You just had what  think are good manners, decency
And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing
(looks right at him) Honestly
(then away) Because  don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you
No
no
One's enough
Tom signals for the check
(cont'd) wasn't doing anything
really have to go
Okay
At least let me show my appreciation
The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday
For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed
What
Yes, it's true
They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early
Yes
How do you know
(shrugs) My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and
always hear things before they happen
Hey, and from now on, so do you
'  - George Weln, the black correspondent and Tom are seated in the office with Ernie -- they are in mid-meeting
'm virtually certain it's not true
He may be indicted eventually, but don't think it will be this month
(to Tom) You want to be alone with me -- tell me your source
If  told you 'm not sure it would totally convince you, but  totally believe the guy
(insufferable) Labor is my Department --  can't conform it and my contacts go very deep
So if it's true -- 'm terrific, right
It's not even a close call
Of course we can't go with it
- Jane is working with Bobbie the editor
Snatches of the tape make it obvious that the Labor Secretary has been indicted -- George Weln stands behind Jane, who is dialing a number
Do you want him all the way to the car
No stop where he's all besieged
Because
(to Bobbie) Right there, Bobbie
Tom enters
So he was indicted
Yes
We were right not to go with it
But  was right -- just somebody give it to me
had a good story
(to George) Give it to him -- so we can concentrate
Ah,  don't want any credit
Bobbie and  serve anonymously
He pats Bobbie on the back
and exits
(pausing in his work) You know,  like Tom, because hi
Bobbie, please
- Crowded rush hour
Buddy and Tom stand next to each other
and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do
Thanks a lot, Buddy
(brushing it off) Oh, please
So they were really impressed with you at work
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds
see the change in you --  see it
- The 10
briefing just breaking up -- Jennifer leaves her network seat in the front row, only to be grabbed by Tom who steers her outside
- In the near distance a circular driveway and a silent armed , standing at attention
(to Jennifer) So he bought this Peugeot sedan at a greatly reduced price while he was there in charge of the White House Advance Team
How come you're not chasing it down yourself
Look, 'm junior man -- and it's your beat
Boy, that's nice
wish we could all deal with each other like this
'll check it
Anything  can do for you
This is my first time at the White House
Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it
didn't have the guts to ask when first came up
'll get you a great tour
- Buddy and Tom watching the Evening News as Jennifer finishes her story
(voice over; on  set) The President says it's not a violation but nonetheless White House sources say the full price will be paid for the Peugeot and new rules will put future bargain hunting off limits for Presidential Aides
This is Jennifer Mack at the White House
Tom and Buddy smile at each other
energized -- up
Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source
Nobody else had it
wish it were you giving the story
That's okay
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story
No
Really
don't worry about it
Okay
And look, in the future  can call you when  have news for you
Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information
(a breath; then to himself) Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy
What do you mean
You're one of the few people in this town  can talk to
Buddy puts his hand to his heart and makes a Hoooo
The  and some nearby patrons turn and look
Tom shifts with discomfort
Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore
(simply) Okay
- Jane waiting for an elevator
It comes and she steps on just as Tom clearly excited comes around the bend from Ernie's office calling for her
He goes to the stairs
- He runs out and sees Jane in the lobby below, then takes off after her
- As he enters and runs outside, looking in both directions then running off to the right
--  Jane has stopped to talk with Blair -- now she exits
- Tom on the street, ahead of her, thinking he's behind her
He runs another half a block and stops dejected
Turns to walk back to the office
He keeps looking back to see if he missed her, so that his head is turned as Jane reaches him, says a fairly social: Hi, how are you
She keeps moving -- Tom spinning after her
Wait --  need you
She stops
've got another story
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work
have it cold, confirmed
They have five million dollars in this thing already
Billion
Okay, billion
right, of course
They told me  could have any producer wanted -- and  want you
As Tom savors the moment
- Various bureau personnel standing at their desks watching Tom's piece being broadcast
We  a
(voice over) One source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury
(to Jane) You write this
write for you sometimes
Not because you have to
We  a General walking away from Tom
(voice over) General Elton McGuire is in charge of the weapon system
- 've been in the Army twenty-seven years -- so 'll let the Army ask the questions, not you
General,  don't want to bother you anymore or your family
But tomorrow there will be a mob of me back here -- so, if you have anything to say, why not say it now, sir, the way you want
He is a study
Looking at himself -- and though it's far from his first time on television -- it's the first time he's seen himself doing serious work and, by all appearances, doing it well
As the General answers in the b
g
-- think it's great of us to have left in what you said -- just great of us
Tom smiles modestly
Yeah, let's never forget
We're the real story
Not them
Tom and Jane look over -- then Tom looks to Jane for a verdict
In the b
g
, the news goes to a commercial
Yeah,  know,  went back and forth on it
liked it
He's not afraid to be human
Ernie    with his fourteen-year-old in tow
He approaches Tom
My youngest wanted to meet you
This is Ellie
Hi, Ellie
You should be honored -- she never cares about meeting anyone here
But she liked you on television just now
(entering scene) Hi, Ellie -- remember me
'm sorry -- from where
've been to your house a lot
(helping) And Aaron went on that fourteen day raft trip with us last year
(vaguely) Oh yes -- hi
-  () Tom is on the phone
(into phone) Hi, Dad
Did you see it
Great -- 'll send you a tape
'm sorry haven't called
Things were a little bumpy for a while
It's not important
'm fine now
(what he's been wanting to say aloud) Hey, Dad --  just may be able to do this job
Well, 'm glad you were sure
'   - Ernie is hosting the news staff for Sunday brunch -- they stand around drinking in small groups
Aaron is standing with Blair and a  in his fifties we have not seen before
don't know why we have to feel defensive about it
Newspapers are in business to make money -- why not us
Aaron looks at her in amazement
They criticize us for supposedly pandering while they run Games
(amused) Exactly right
Excuse me
'm paid to mix
Blair and Aaron laugh appreciatively as he walks off to another group
Goodbye, Paul
Take care, Paul
(back to Blair) It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser
No
think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser
My gosh, and for a while there,  was attracted to you
She walks off
Wait a minute -- that changes everything
At the bar getting a drink
Jennifer
and leads Jane down the hall until they are standing alone
This is very awkward
Go ahead -- what
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and 'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind
in which case  just won't do anything
God Almighty -- Whew
Do  mind
Why do  mind
do mind
What a shock --  don't have a right to
don't think  like him
know don't respect him
So what am talking about -- what am  saying to you
You're saying stay away from him
(stupefied) can't be
She blinks in wonder
We don't have to settle this definitively right now
Jennifer moves toward the drinking table -- Jane, unsteadied by the dose of self-revelation, moves towards Aaron's circle and scratches his back in friendship
Tom approaches an she moves off -- not wanting to deal with him
She takes a few breaths as she keeps walking
We  snatches of , i
e: Tell me one person who ever left television news to work on a newspaper
She moves on; Tom still following
' (holding Paul's arm) felt so proud when he turned down News Vice President so we could stay here
Suddenly, after all these years, we have a life
Jane turns -- sees that Tom is still looking at her from a few feet away
(badly) Hi, Tom
She stands there, genuinely frightened
She must deal with him now
He crosses to her
It's the firs time 've seen you dressed like this
You look so clean and pretty
What do you mean clean
At work there's always this sort of film over you
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you
You're great at taking the edge off a good time
Jane starts twitching
She pauses -- holds a hand lightly on his arm to steady herself
You okay
Yes
Just don't say anything mean for a while
Thanks
She meets his gaze for an instant -- and, in that instant, loses control for the first time in her memory
She looks strange as she retreats from this glimpse of upheaval
've got to find someone
It's important
Excuse me
She walks away
had the strangest thing happen yesterday
Anne and  have been married what
-- Thirty-six years
Everything fine -- two days after the promotion came through,  was checking myself in the mirror and she was making a face at me behind my back
So yesterday  looked in the mirror and she was doing it again
You didn't say anything to her
He shakes his head
My instincts tell me not to
Annie comes up
The office is phoning, honey
He   as Anne watches him go
hope he moves that fast when it's me on the line
As she passes a chair with an afghan shawl on the back -- she picks it up and wraps it around herself, a bit chilled
She sees Jennifer on the stairs and moves toward her calling in a too loud, anxiety-ridden voice as she goes
Jennifer
Hey, Jennifer
Jennifer turning as Jane whips up the stairs
Forget what  said -- you do whatever you want to with him
She pushes at Jennifer a little
Well, there's nothing 'm going to do right this second
Jane pushes her again
But it's a party, right
Jane smiles back feigning female bonding -- Jennifer goes back down the steps and crosses to Tom
Aaron takes in Jane, who is taking in Jennifer and Tom -- then Aaron begins to sense a new dynamic in the room as Ernie re-enters and huddles briefly with Paul
The News President is intent
The two of them walk over to Tom and Jennifer
We   just a few words: This would be a good time to tap that source of yours
He could have an angle or something
'
Tom is startled but cool -- nods his head -- Jennifer is amazed looking at Tom with new and even prettier eyes
Paul and Ernie now move toward Jane, a whole flow of movement creating a new energy in the area
Jane sheds her Afghan as she rises to meet them
(to Jane) We want you to exec produce a Special Report
What
Aaron has come over to join them now in time to
Libyan plane shot up one of our bases in Egypt
It's all still happening
Let's figure out the field
Unfortunately, since Paul's here, he's made out the assignments
Jennifer at the White House
George at the Pentagon
Martin at State
and we need an anchor since Rorish is in his boat, so we're gonna do the whole report this afternoon from here
with Tom
That's it
resign as of now
(to Aaron) Stop it
'll tell you what
'll stay if Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi
Ernie, as much as  like you, think  have to tell Paul what think, because this is really sort of obscenely stupid
Jane, if you want to, go ahead don't disagree with you
Jane moves quickly off, awed at the prospect of taking on the big boss
As she moves past Tom who is talking on the phone, eventually catching up with Paul
In the b
g
Tom has just  the "" of an
Hello, Buddy
It's 1:35 -- and this is Tom
You can reach me at the office
It's important
can use a little help
Jane, because of the proximity to Tom is speaking in whispered intensity
Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him
Not near ready
Not by the longest shot
Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story
think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and  think it's my responsibility to tell you that
Okay, that's your opinion don't agree
It's not opinion
You're just absolutely right and 'm absolutely wrong
She nods
It must be nice to always believe you know better
To think you're always the smartest person in the room
(from her depths) No, it's awful
Oh my, it's awful
(turning to leave) We'd better get moving
As they move out
Jane goes to Aaron
He moves with her towards the door
What happened
'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from
Watch
-- 'll come by your place, right after
drink, take pills
Love you
She runs out the door
Aaron turns mean and mocks Jane's last words -- screwing up his face in a savage burlesque
Yeah, love you, too
- As Jane briefly pauses to see which war has room
Tom opens the passenger seat of his car -- she gets in
It moves off
'  - As it moves off
Nervous
Excited
Jane looks over at him -- there's no question he's just told the truth
'  - In the b
g
we  the Bureau Newsroom beginning to pulse with activity
Tom closes the door
He sits down behind his desk and opens a bottom drawer -- a clean whit shirt lies there
He opens the center drawer -- two ties are inside
He picks one
He reaches for a package of new red suspenders
He takes off the shirt and puts on the new one -- all of this the work of an expert craftsman
By the time he finishes he looks like the authority figure we know he's now
- Jane is  hyper
She is purposeful -- organized -- even calming Blair with a little physical contact -- a touch on the arm, to still her colleague's hysterical demons
Tell George and Jessica to try and cover everything without Tom having to ask additional questions
And Bobbie says
Did you hear what  just said -- do you have that
Take a breath
(a breath, then) Yes
In the b
g
Tom has exited his office and looks about -- waiting for some indication as to what to do next
And the most important thing make sure his earpiece works, have back-ups ready
That's never been more vital
He must be able to hear me at every second and clearly
Jane sees him
She moves across the room -- takes Tom by the arm
We have twenty minutes -- you can wait in the studio
Tom coughs nervously into his hand and takes a pen from a nearby desk, clips it into his inside pocket and walks off
- Jane is screening and asking corrections in a graphic representation of an -14 shooting down a Libyan Air Force Mirage Fighter
Put in the radar plane that spotted them to begin with
We have no pictures on file
can't draw -- but this is a rough idea
She uses the stylus from the    to outline an American Air Force -2C Hawkeyes Radar Plane
Her work is stunning
'  - He has a glass in hand -- some chips on the table with a bottle of wine as he selects a Cassette Desk to play
He picks a French song -- looks at some of his books
He might even read
He is feigning disinterest for an audience of no one
He   with the  in perfect French
- Tom checking copy in the long hallway leading to the studio -- there is the merest of hubbubs causing him to look up
Buddy is being stopped at the other end of the hallway
have to check first
(a bit frantic) Well, then check -- but hurry -- There he is
Buddy runs the length of the hallway to Tom's aide despite Tom's gestures to slow down
Is everything all right
Yes
You didn't have to come here
It's just that 'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing
(delighted) Anchor
(amused despite situation) Yes, stop
wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening
(on Buddy's reaction) What's wrong
broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything
Oh
Look,  can start up with him again if you really
No
'm doing fine
Look
Tom stands there -- a man at home in this media castle
Good
He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone
Hey, okay
Look Buddy -- 've got to go to work
(to Tom) good-bye then
'll speak to you
Well, who knows
Just let m tell you what my favorite teacher ever, told me -- 'Don't be afraid to be wonderful
' He leans forward, gives Tom a quick embrace, a small kiss on the cheek
Tom turns and walks off down the hallway to meet his immediate destiny as Buddy looks on
- Jane mounts some steps in the control room -- she moves past the  and   up to the next level where the two news execs, Ernie and Paul stand with their backs to the wall, and then up one more step slightly above the desk and table occupied by Blair
Now she slips into the large well paddled throne-like seat -- as
Literally at her fingertips is the row of buttons which provide immediate access to the field reporters at the Pentagon, State and the White House
In front of her the bank of monitors, the Technical Team and past them the studio where Tom is seated at Anchor, a   and  feeding him copy
As she looks at Jane, poised to control the complicated apparatus of minds and machines comprising the big time network news
And Jane Craig is at the helm
Blair experiences a flash of emotion which transcends envy and verbalizes it
(sotto to Jane) Executive Producer -- wow
Jane looks at her and, in a moment of atypical merriment, does a choking gesture at her own throat as the monitors flash a graphic reading:
We  an ' say, "This is a Special Report from
" :  ' Each of four buttons labeled so that the microphone can connect her to Tom and the Field Reporters
She presses the button marked "Tom
" You hear me, Tom
Tom
Tom
Damn it
He can't hear me
(to Blair) told you if there was one thing
Tom's  on speakers
(voice over; relaxed) can hear you
was just teasing
Gulping the air in relief, she slumps nonetheless impressed by the macho cool as: Tom smiles towards her then -- poises himself just as the Announcer's last words clear
' (voice over) in Washington, Tom Grunick
He begins his report
He seems authoritative, compelling, even in a low key way
We trust him
Good afternoon
Libyan fighter plane attacked a United States Military Installation early this morning and was, itself, shot down by American -14 Interceptors
Another monitor shows the Graphic running
In the b
g
two men approaches Paul
They look out of place, decidedly non-business like
Mr
Moore, 'm Marvin Usher and this is my brother, Stuart
Not now
(gesturing) Look
The Libyan Missile destroyed an Army Warehouse which, just thirty minutes earlier, had been crowded with servicemen
No one was injured
'  - Aaron is seated, feet up, drinking, listening to  -- reading a book, two remote controls are on the cushion next to him
He with the record as he reads -- at one point providing his own lyric line
( ) And  can read while  sing
He picks up the television remote-control device an puts the television on, the
We  the graphic of the Libyan plane's flight route, its missile firing -- the
planes taking off and the shooting down of the Mirage jet
At one point Aaron lowering the and raising the   hearing Tom
' (voice over) The heat seeking missile virtually disintegrated the  plane on
Aaron turns down the   and turns up the
Jane's hand flicks at the button marked "
" George, you're ready
We  George and  him through Jane's voice box
(voice over) Should  cover everything or should save something for Tom to ask about
Cover everything
George nods
(hitting Tom's button) We're going to George
Say 'the Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have George Weln at the Pentagon'
George Weln is at the Pentagon where the attack launched by the lone Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive movement of military might
'  - Where he still balances  and
lot of alliteration from anxious anchors placed in powerful posts
He picks up the phone
- As Blair hands it to Jane
It's Aaron
Yes
think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here
Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our -14 is one of the hardest planes to fly
They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'
Thanks
(to Tom) The -14 is one of the most difficult planes to master
(remembering) Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes
George, isn't the -14 Tomcat one of the most difficult machines for a pilot to master
think you're right -- it's certainly one of our hottest planes
'  - say it here -- it comes out there
He giggles
(voice over) There was trouble with them in the early days -- back in the 70's
Aaron dials again
As we  Jennifer standing at the White House
(into phone) Me again
Hi
Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything
When you speak to him he's not at all nuts
He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control
that's what's so strange
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him
(voice over) You're welcome
Sow how does it feel to
know you gotta go -- Me too
We're very busy here
He hangs up --
Aaron with his remote controls
The picture switches back to Tom
He turns  the
(voice over) outlaw nation but strangely those who have interviewed Gaddafi find him, in a phrase we like to use in this country, very 'presidential'
Nice, Jane
- Jane is on the phone
The atmosphere buckling with strain
(into phone) Just a minute
Her finger hits the "Tom" button
(to Tom) To State for the message from Libya, then you'll have the carrier pilot from the Sidra in time to
(a sudden shriek) What
No
Jolted by the shriek in his earpiece but nonetheless continuing
As she   the phone -- this is more than volume, she is over-the-top livid, her face red, neck cords popping
We only have ten minutes left -- how can you talk to me about parking problems
No, not you'll try
you'll do it -- do it or 'll fry your fat ass, Estelle
Good-bye
As she  the  down
Paul comments sotto to Ernie
(sotto) had no idea she was this good
(hitting Tom's button) Fill for a second
(fluidly) The latest message seems to indicate that the Libyan pilot was acting on his own without authority from anyone else
(into camera directly) In other words,  think we're okay
- Tom's left profile    , Production Assistant who madly shuffles pages, even as Tom talks on camera, the monitor through which he sees the subject of his interview at the Pentagon, the clusters of a assistants on the floor and now      him, beginning to  the Control Room in the b
g
and as we , the white ear piece firmly in place, we , the barely audible crackle of Jane's  as she tells him roughly what to say and how long he has to say it
So, Commander, it must have been a bit tougher today -- shooting down the French-made Mirage Jet
The one you got was a -22
etc
And       ' , the ear piece and the   on the  and beyond
almost an abstract vision
- ' Once again:  The Libyan Government has disavowed any prior knowledge of the flight
This has been Tom Grunick reporting from Washington
The special report ended, Jane breathes a breath -- she and Blair momentarily grasp hands
The first talk concerns Tom
He was brilliant
've never been as proud of one of my decisions
(calls back to Jane) Great work, Jane, really -- You know
Really
She nods
totally depleted
Well, there were no major gaffs anyway
Ernie scoffs in her direction
Thanks, everybody
She exits the scene
(to the Usher brothers) This was important for Tom -- there's that bonding thing that happens with the public and an anchorman during a crisis
It's not the conventions anymore; it's this kind of moment
Tom enters
He is exuberant
(to Tom) What a baptismal
Congratulations
Thanks
With all the help you get, it's sure easier than local
Paul and Ernie exchange a glance
(cont'd) Where's Jane
'm still juiced
Ernie points off
as Tom exits
The Usher brothers hover
(to the Usher brothers) Can  help you
We're here to play the new news theme
New theme
You don't need me for this
Stay
Why should  be the only one to feel silly
We need a synthesizer -- but this will give you an idea
Go ahead
(to Ernie) Wasn't he great
It worked
Man Two has the keyboard out and begins playing the prospective news theme:  a suite meant to have majesty and drive, a towering composition -- the effect of it somewhat lessened by the fact that the two men    over the keyboard
- As Tom makes his way across it -- crews are drifting in
He enters Jane's cubby, flushed with the electricity of the "win" the most noteworthy moment of his working life
'  - You're an amazing woman
What a feeling having you inside my head
(a bit thrown) Yeah
It was an unusual place to be
Indescribable -- you knew just when to feed me the next thing, just a split second before  needed it
There was a rhythm we got into, like great sex
Jane looks at him and nods slightly -- an unconscious spasm of truthfulness
You have to celebrate with me, don't you
Everybody's going to that bar on the corner, 'Caps
' 'm going over to Aaron's
Maybe 'll hoop up with all of you later
How long do you think you'll be there
Tom indicates that it's an impossible question to answer
They enters the elevator
- As several people cross the street towards the bar
Tom has been holding back on one question
It's tempting to ask you how you think did
(she starts to reply) No
'm enjoying myself
Take it easy
He starts across the street
(trying to be casual) Maybe 'll see you over there
Indicates Bar
You'll never show up
He starts across the street -- then turns and calls to her
Jane
Yeah
'll wait for you till seven
(shouting back) Okay
Tom races to catch up with the others -- Jane in the distant b
g
pauses a beat before walking off in the opposite direction
Jane moving quickly along
comes   continues through: '  - As Jane approaches and is surprised to find him sitting on the stoop outside
Happy to see her, rising fairly soberly to his feet
He as she comes toward him
Really
It was good
He nods and  some more
Your calling in that information -- you're the classiest guy  know
He waves her off
And sits down on the stoop
It was strange to watch him
What's the next step
Lip synching
She sits a step or two above him, waiting to gauge his mood
've been doing some of the most important thinking of my life wonder if this is the right time to tell you about it
She steals a glance at her watch
Well, whatever you think
figured out exactly why it is 'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor
It's because if  do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better
That's why
Sounds like you may be on to something
Which means 'm at their mercy and who wants that
'm not going to tell you where this thought led me
Anyway, well, why not  tell you
-- it's a happy thing
In the middle of all this  start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you And 'll stop here but, Jane, 'd give anything if you were two people so  could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one 'm in
don't think should go any further
Come on -- 'll walk you to the corner
He tales her by the arm and leads her to the corner
You know you've had a strange day
'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking
Absolutely
You go have a good time
You have some place to go
Yes
Good
He grabs her and hugs her exuberantly -- takes her face in his hands and kisses her full on the lips
Well,  felt something
He leaves her on the corner and walks back
As the
Jane moving quickly, hailing a cab
- We're going to Caps Bar at Seventeenth and Vermont; Connecticut is clear on Sunday
take that over to Fifteenth, then around Vermont and we'll bypass the circle that way
if you don't go over forty we should catch mostly green lights
the ' annoyed look
Come on -- don't take it the wrong way
just know about things
He hits the meter
- As the cab pulls up, Jane gets out and pays him
Great route
never made anywhere near that fast before
Thanks -- good driving -- Thanks
Coming from you appreciate it
Thanks
As she turns to enter the restaurant -- Tom and Jennifer exit
As they confront each other: didn't think you'd make it
Well,  thought 'd check if all of you were still here
'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on
There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones
Well, 'll go in and have a bite
(to Jennifer) Jennifer, you want to have another drink
Hey,  know how to have a burger by myself
feel like a little solitude
(as they move off) sure know that feeling
Terrific work today
(too jock-like) Right back to you
Thanks for getting me through
He puts his hand behind her neck in an awkward gesture of camaraderie
She awkwardly disengages
waves and steps inside the door to the restaurant
standing there between the two sets of doors watching Tom and Jennifer walk away
As they walk to his car, first exchanging a look of reflection over Jane
then bumping accidentally, then bumping back, a look, then kissing with passion, wrapped around each other
'  - As Tom and Jennifer rush in locked in an embrace, shedding clothes even as they enter
'  - We are aware of
(intense shout) Damn all you sons-of-bitches
Oh shit, you bastards
They finish
beat, then: Sorry
Tom taken aback by the outburst from this woman he's just made love to
No, it's okay
People say different things
They do
the plural threw me
She laughs
The last time  was with someone we went through this awful mutual disease questionnaire but  guess it beats getting paranoid the next day
Okay, 'll go first
haven't
(stopping her) It would never occur to me to worry at all about you
Jennifer is touched
You know something
'm deeply complimented
Isn't it strange to be deeply complimented because the man you're with doesn't think you have a venereal disease
Tom slides out of bed naked -- she moves quickly across the bed one outstretched hand reaching for his ass, a free -- even lusty sort of motion punctuated by her comment: Give me some of that
He dances away -- out of range -- liking the action, a stupid grin on his face
Where's the bathroom
Through the closet
He opens the door and turns on the light in the closet
- It is a converted room -- given over the racks of clothes and shoes extraordinarily well organized
Tom stands there agape
Various rain coats -- clothes for all climates -- lots of luggage
She joins him in the closet -- holding out a sheet in front of her
converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up
Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years
'm not knocking it
It's a great solution
Not only the storage but you can see everything you have
Jennifer laughs -- he follows her gaze and sees himself in silhouette against the door -- his penis prominent in outline
Do you do bunny rabbits
Tom is enjoying himself immensely
Isn't this a great date
We  the    as we: '   - Jane feeds another tape in -- she is taking editing notes alone and  her arm
She looks worn out -- move across the small screen
She sighs and, without realizing, implores the heavens to help cure a malady she's yet to recognize in herself
(to herself) God help me
People have begun to filter into the newsroom in the b
g
Jesus, Jane
How long have you been here
long time
was restless
Will you crack my neck
He starts massaging her neck as the phone rings
she lets it ring for a beat as Aaron works on her
As she picks up the receiver we  a
She reacts to it at the same time she utters a greeting
Aaah -- (into phone) -- ello
You sure they said the management meeting
(hangs up; then to Aaron) They want me to be at the management meeting
They're not that dumb, after all
He pats her on the back
- Do you know you're the second woman in network news history to produce
(though distracted) No, 'm not
'm the fourth
Joan Richmond
Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a
special and there's Susan Zirinsky
- Paul is running the meeting from behind Ernie's desk
-  are in attendance
As Paul discusses the more pressing problems of the network news division, Jane sits near the window strangely unmoved by her first moment at the seat of power
She has the blues
Anyway, they seem to be very serious about making me out eight million from the budget and that means massive firings
'm doing everything  can
It's too early to make up a 'death list' but just wanted you to be aware of the situation
We're also going to cover the Alaskan serial killer trial on a continuing basis
'd like it done out of Washington which means we've got to get somebody on a plane for Anchorage
We can't fool around anymore
Jane
She looks up at him -- a bit sleepy-eyed
(cont'd) This is going to be high-profile on the Evening News -- who do you think
George Weln or Jennifer
(much, much too quickly) Jennifer
The men look at her curiously
She repeats herself more rationally
(cont'd) Jennifer
'  - He has been reading from a respectable stack of mail -- Jane appears in his doorway
For the first time, we notice that she is woefully ba at at least one endeavor -- flirting
Come on, 'll buy you a drink
There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy
'm not sure 'd be good company tonight
(self-conscious joke) 'll be the judge of that
- As they walk in -- one  looks at Tom with a glint of recognition
Then another -- a handshake --   introduces herself
small knot of people form
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you
Do  have to stand here in the middle and meet them all
'll get you through
Move and smile
(she pushes him a little) And smile and move
They start crossing the room -- he is moving now, making progress
But an   stops him
Is it safe for me to fly home
Yes
We're fine now
He smiles -- people smile back
Where Aaron (Pimm's Cut in hand -- a cucumber sticking out) stands with Martin Klein
Martin is eating from a huge platter of appetizers
The Italians serve the second best things right after the Chinese could do an article comparing Embassy food
Gourmet free-loading
sell it anyplace
'm sure not getting the assignments
Who the heck could that be
'
From the excited group of people blocking his view, it's clear there is some personage in attendance
And now he sees that it's Tom
Is God testing me or something
Paul loves him
heard him give him the most poetic compliment in his command
'He's hot
'  Sometimes groups of executives get together just to say that work back and forth
'He's hot, oh, she's hot
Oh, he's really hot
'  Hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot
(looking at Aaron) And here we are
Martin, you're not allowed to use the word 'we' or 'm moving
(sudden thought) Maybe Jane would like my food idea as a spot
Try the one in the middle
He moves off to intercept Jane -- as he stops her
Tom is stranded -- then sees Aaron and moves over to his side
Hi, Aaron
What's doing
Same old stuff
'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea
stops and introduces himself to Tom -- shaking his hand: You want to go out there -- (indicating balcony) get out of this for a second
Why don't you lead
'll just follow the flurry you cause
Tom turns -- the sharpness of the tone unsettles him
What did  do to you
You've made my dreams silly
Tom decides not to deal with the remark
He's jolted by the hostility
He leads the way out French Doors to a ground floor terrace, where Aaron joins him, closes the door and the two men stare at the party
(gesturing at the party) Heavy hitters
Aaron nods
They look inside
(several beats; then) How you doing
(warming) Great
Network news, Washington
love it
What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams
Keep it to yourself
You know the other day  really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report --  was going to ask but guess  feel a little intimidated with you
Oh, stop it
On Tom's reaction
You can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world
It's unseemly
'm not buying into any of that have a load to learn
'm not going to act as if
(finishing for him) You have the job you have
The sudden debate is important to Tom -- but it's moving too fast for him
Shut up a second
(amiably) Okay
Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal
(picking his words) made one rule for myself when this started and  realized  was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports
And the rule was
Never to pretend to know more than did
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet
(flustered) Okay, let's drop it
didn't mean 'd take a test for you --  mean if that came up in conversation 'd
We're conversing
Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind
What are they
Tom is getting pissed
(compromising) Don't name them
Just tell me if you know
Yes, Aaron
know the names of the Cabinet
Okay
beat
(cont'd) All twelve
Yes
There are only ten
Aaron's suddenly a good deal happier -- damned if it isn't a little infectious
You're feeling good, aren't you
(sincerely) 'm starting to
We may do the capitols of the states
(dry) Fifty, right
Aaron almost smiles
Tom enters the party leaving the door open
Aaron in the f
g
-- his
Beyond him Tom being approached
then joining Jane
'  - As Tom's car comes to a stop
'  - 'm so exhausted
Punchy
Sick tired
can't think and  can't move
'm just a dead lump of poured out flesh
(then) Would you like to come up
Tom thinks -- then: Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little
Okay
You didn't like the party, huh
Too many smart people in one room -- it's not healthy
Jane's confused by this
She looks at him
'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own
Eventually
Does it have to be right now
(nodding) Believe me,  wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary
have an idea for something
What
just read about it in a magazine and it affected me
Well, what is it
If  tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that
(broadly) Yes, Tom --  think  can manage
He turns towards her -- about to stick his chin out
Hesitates
(cont'd) promise
It's about women who are attacked by someone they know on a date
'Date-rape,' that's the piece
Well
Jane clamps a hand over her own mouth
Okay -- good move
Keep it there
She continues to clamp her mouth shut as he exits the car, opens her door and then begins to half carry, half pull her out
She keeps her hand clamped over her mouth
Laughing from behind her door and runs for it
His spirits lifted
Behind the door, trying to hide the glow in her eyes
'  - The phone rings
Jane's hand bounces off her nightstand to turn on the light knocking over and breaking the clock radio instead
Three alarm clocks stand next to the clock radio
Finally the light comes on
Jane's voice is so thick with sleep the words she utters are just barely distinguishable
Hello
(uncertain) Hello
Hello
Who is it
: '  - 'm not sure  dialed right -- Jane
Jane, yes
Tom
Tom, is that you
Is this Tom
Yes
had to sleep fast so  took two allergy pills to help me
'm sorry
Hey, you called me
It's not important
Says who
Not important -- ha-ha-ha
was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me
Gosh
What pills did you take
You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic
Maybe 'd better speak to you tomorrow
Nooo
Is it your story
No
Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday
Why, you need me for the story
No
Were you going to you
Uh-huh
Maybe 'll get off work
'd like to go
Oh, good
We can go together
So you like me, huh
like you as much as  can like anyone who thinks 'm an asshole
'   - Tom editing a piece with Bobby -- He also has a little typewriter table set up
He is reading from the page in the typewriter as he looks at the piece he has written
(reading) But cops on the street continue to view it as
Shit -- too long
But street cops say
that fits
That last cut work for you, Bobbie
Yes, and thanks for asking
- As the regulars watch the Evening News, in particular the Date Rape piece which is now in progress
Tom anxiously eyeing Jane out of the corner of his eye as she watches the monitor
Her face impossible to read as she studies the screen
What can you do
If a woman invites a man in and he says they uh, had sex and she says he raped her and then you find out they've been out together two, three times
how can you prove a crime
Tom and a woman of about thirty -- dignified but fragile -- she looks like someone who might be cast for a church production of "Glass Menagerie
" It will be a year next month since it happened
never thought 'd talk about it outside of counseling
As Aaron enters the scene
Hi
He is shushed by every woman in the room, accepts this and takes up a position near Tom and Jane to watch them
We'd gone out twice and  hadn't enjoyed myself that much but it gets to a point --  don't know if you can appreciate this but where you don't want to sit home or be with your girlfriends and people had always been telling me that  was 'too picky
' 'm not
It's just you want to meet a nice guy
So anyways, it was that 'give-him-a-chance' thing
No, it wasn't
was lonely
So we went to a movie and when he brought me home he said could he just come up and have one beer and then he'd go
How do you say 'no', to that
So first it was this wrestling match which was awful enough because it got to be really a fight
because 'm a modest person
then he ripped my clothes and he forced me to
make love
He stayed in my apartment and forced me more times -- he didn't leave until
(she has started to cry) promised myself  wouldn't cry
It's just hard not to -- (ruefully) You sure have a sympathetic face
(she cries a bit more) was so sure  wouldn't do this -- but the whole thing messed me up -- maybe more than it should
As the news piece cut to:  Tom's face -- he turns clearing a tear from his eyes
These watching struck -- perhaps embarrassed but riveted
Aaron is aghast
Aaron approaches the set
Can  turn on the news for a second
Oh, wait a minute
Sex -- Tears -- This must be the news
Tom stares daggers at him as a public official appears on the monitor
don't think you can overestimate it -- on any given Saturday night tens of thousands of women are being attacked and there isn't much they or we can do about it
(on monitor) The victims often remain too terrified to talk -- the police powerless and all the social welfare groups can finally do is monitor this epidemic of crime without punishment
This is Tom Grunick in Annandale, Virginia
As his piece concludes
Tom continues to glare at Aaron
'm in a pissy mood
'm sorry
What's wrong with it
Nothing
think you really blew the lid off nookie
Blair moans with displeasure
Aaron exits scene
Others start to congratulate Tom on the piece -- in the b
g
on the: We  frozen wilderness -- men digging in the ground -- clumps of people watching them work
Probing her own ambivalence -- or, to be more accurate, working towards a positive stance
(to Tom) Nice work
(checks watch) 've got to get a crew off the clock
She starts off -- Tom stopping her
Now off a bit by themselves
So what did you think
It moved me
did relate to it -- really did
It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice
but it's real and it got me
and  think a lot of the time 'm too conservative about that kind of stuff
Okay
(enormously pleased) Yeah
He walks back towards the area of the monitor
Tomorrow the jury returns to this site as each day brings more revelations of horror, four more bodies now taken from the frozen earth
This is Jennifer Mack in Wota Hamlet, Alaska
-    () - Ernie's been looking for you
As Aaron walks to his office
'  - As he enters and finds Ernie bent over his desk
Oh,  was just writing you a note
What do you say we take a walk
(puzzled) Outside
Yeah -- - Ernie is silent
He's having difficulty
Aaron is feeling knots form
Finally Ernie breaks his silence
don't know if we have any younger man more respected in our operation than you
Just tell me what's really going on
think we know each other well enough for me to expect that
(agitated) We know each other well enough for me to care how  put something to you which could wipe you out
So  will phrase things the way think they should be phrased
All right
Wipe me out
Ernie sits on a bench
Anyway
want you to think of this as
Just blunt talk, okay
'd really appreciate bluntness
Upper management thinks you're dull
Aaron deflates
Aaron, 've never seen them like this --  think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to
Wait
Bullshit me a little
'm beginning to appreciate it
'm no suggesting the worst will happen
but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it
(emotional) Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God
They want to fire me
All  know is that they've got to fire a large number of people
and they're not going by seniority
There's a recklessness in the air
They
(interrupting) Do one thing to me
Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it
think it could turn them around
could do it this Saturday -- everyone wants off for the Correspondents' Dinner
Aaron turns -- his spirit lifted by the unexpected ray of hope
Do it then
Please prepare carefully
This couldn't come at a better time
Prepare what
You have Saturday's news handy
It's been a while since you read the news -- 'll have somebody work with you
Just on superficial performance things
Several beats
(cont'd) Please
Okay
think 'd better be alone for a while
understand
'll go with you
Thanks
- Aaron is seated behind a desk -- some old news copy in his hand
An unmanned camera is pointing at him
Tom is standing a few feet further back studying him
This is uncomfortable for me -- because, well,  don't mean it as a knock, but we approach this differently
We sure do
don't mean it as a knock either
(he smiles) Go ahead
'll just say what  think and you can disregard it if you want
It just might not work for me because of our different approaches
Tom nods and gestures that he proceed
Aaron begins reading the news
Barely a sentence in, he is interrupted
Wait
What
Your coat jacket is rising up in back
Aaron ignores the tip
When you sit down -- sit on your jacket a little -- that gives you a good line
Look at yourself in the monitor
Aaron looks but is unimpressed and resumes reading the news
Tom, not about to be ignored when he knows it's important, moves behind Aaron and begins to force his jacket down
(very uncomfortable) don't like being handled
Sit on it
Now look
Just don't physically
(he sees himself in the monitor and is suddenly enthusiastic) Fantastic tip -- fantastic
He starts to read again
No
That's not going to tell us anything
Let's get this prompter going
It's not loaded
'll find some copy
Be right back
Tom exits -- Aaron looking after him, clearly taken with the genuine camaraderie
the unmistakable joy Tom derives from helping out
Several beats and Tom comes back with a  in tow
got copy,  got Ellen to heat up the camera and  got Master Control taping so you can study it later
He puts the roll of copy in the prompter
Hey, Tom
Tom turns
'm very appreciative
- Tom totally focused on him down one knee checking him from various angles
He interrupts
Aaron reading from the prompter
No
No
No
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that
You don't want to look shifty, do you
Oh, God, no
And the left side of your face is the good one
Go again
And try to punch one word or phrase in every sentence -- punch one idea a story
Punch -- come on -- Aaron does same with the story he is reading
Good
very nice
Aaron acknowledges the compliment in news mode
Punching the first words
Thank you for the compliment, Tom
He draws a laugh from the Cameraman as he goes right into the next story
Try not to move your head or wrinkle your forehead
this is good, very good
- Aaron, tape in head, is saying his farewell to Tom
He is facing his left side as he will do for the rest of his life on earth
You were smokin' toward the end there
The pointers were great
'll study the tape
Tom is into helping Aaron he finds himself delivering a locker room pep talk: And remember -- you're not just reading the news or narrating
Everybody has to sell a little
You're selling them this idea of you
You know, what you're sort of saying is, 'trust me
'm, uh, credible
'  So whenever you catch yourself just reading
stop and start selling a little
So long
He moves off -- Aaron watching him go, feeling decidedly uncomfortable by this last piece of advice and vaguely corrupted
'  - Jane   , carrying her dress, two large shoulder pads clipped to her bra-straps
She is obviously running a little late
Now she slips on the dress -- her pace so quickened that it momentarily dulls the effect of seeing her in a pretty formal gown; the kind good girls wear on special nights
The She opens the door while trying to put on her necklace
Aaron enters carrying four bulging garment bags and a fistful of neckties
spilled some rum on the outfit you picked out
Let me show you the alternates
She eyes the amount of clothing, goes to the phone and dials
(into phone) Tom
why don't  meet you there
've got some last minute stuff 've got to take care of
Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it
knew it
How much
Wow
Okay
See you there
didn't know you were going with him
Did you bring your grey suit
Yes
was thinking that way too
Which tie
She holds them in her hand -- indicates with the necklace that she wants him to help her
he fastens her necklace while looking over her bare right shoulder as she riffles through his tie collection
(the clasp in place) Thanks
Try this one
She hands him the tie and he extracts his grey jacket from a bag -- puts it on and ties the tie
She reaches into a white paper bag full of fresh purchases and takes out a vial of perfume with a built-in atomizer and sprays the air in front of hr and walks into the mist
Aaron's reaction: read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume
Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date
(flaring) It's not a date
It's co-workers going to a professional conclave
Jane, unnoticed, reaches into the paper bag, takes a small box of condoms and drops it into her evening bag
- Jane on a public phone, Aaron standing nearby within sight of a taxi stand
(on phone) How long will it tale you to send one
She hangs up
paces
Then looks at Aaron, relaxes
You look terrific
Aaron poses a question which he feels in his deepest core: Really
Jane nods
Because this is important -- so don't just be polite
'd really like to look
what's the word 'm looking for
As good as humanly possible
Yes
Well, the line of the jacket -- No really
just very nice
just right
wish  could be there
Me too
Hey
if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio
'm not sure 'll be able to
If if not, 'll have the tape
'll wait for you at my apartment
Okay, great -- good luck
Before she can deal with that, a cab arrives
Thanks, Jane
Have a good time tonight
You too
Aaron takes her in -- she looks lovely
'd hug you, but why risk mussing either of us
She half-laughs
kisses him, wipes the slight lipstick mark from his cheek and, in a sudden decision, takes each of her shoulder pads from her jacket and puts them in his -- improving his look while diminishing her own
She gets in the cab
'
Jane, leaning all the way over the front seat, giving detailed instructions to the  as the cab pulls away
As Aaron turns and walks off
- Jane, in her formal, sitting back -- anticipating her date
- hefty percentage of the Washington journalism industry's men and women dressed formally for one of those evenings where they can finally assert their own glamour
Jane
-  - As Jane enters, lost momentarily in the lobby -- greenhouse, the majority of the throng passing through in formal clothes
bit of   from   in dinner jackets
The
times is a great outfit
Best severance pay in the business
Jane keeps looking for Tom -- passing another , talking to his -
He was lecturing me and finally just said -- 'm sorry,  refuse to look at it as a negative that 'm young and my news appeals to people my age
And it's not like he just didn't hire a twenty-six-year-old producer himself
No kidding, twenty-six
Jane moves to the steps and starts up, greeting several people nervously
More bits of , leaking from conversations of both substance and expedience
Remember Brinkley's great line -- "It's as irrevocable as a haircut
" Now, on the second level, she scans the crowd
'
The floor below
Tom in the world's best-fitting tux
Clusters of people from around him but he works his way easily through them as he looks for Jane and grins his greetings, men are buoyed, women's pulses throb
As she silently mouths the words -- "smile and move and smile and move
"  Which is exactly what he's doing
Then a contract with the gods
(to herself) If he doesn't see me soon, we're not supposed to be together
Seeing her
-- He does a tap step -- a brief giddy burst, the meaning of which is not lost on Jane
He is acting like her boyfriend
Anxiety stripped away revealing a first glimpse of Jane as a joyous pretty young woman
Moving quickly up the stairs -- as she walks toward him
(excitedly) It's incredible who's here
Who
Me
She laughs
Almost completes an affectionate gesture -- takes his arm instead
- Aaron seated in the main newsroom in shirt-sleeves, writing
He takes the just-completed page out of the typewriter and walks over to the weekend news
(
) Want to look at this
Sure
George Weln appears
(to Aaron) What are you doing here
(feigning casualness) The weekend news
anchoring
anchoring the weekend news
Way to go
Aaron nods, as the Producer finishes the copy
This is terrific news, Aaron
It's a pleasure to read
Thanks
Oh, there's water on the set, isn't there, in case  get an attack of cotton mouth
Sure
You'll be fine
(feeling patronized and repelling) 'll be fine
Yes
know
- Bomb sniffing dogs,    and
monitoring the members of Washington's most trustworthy elite as they pass through the metal detector
The line moves slowly -- Jane and Tom several couples back
- (o
s
) Can  have your autograph for my wife
Tom and Jane turn to see a grinning Paul
How you doing, Paul
So this is why you wouldn't do the Weekend New, you can't turn down a free meal
Yes, born to party
Paul enjoys the riposte, looks at Jane who is shrinking within herself
'll see you two inside --  think we're all at the same table
(sotto to Jane) You're finally learning to be flexible
Glad you changed your mind about Tom
He passes through the detector
Tom starts to step through it -- she pulls him back
'm sorry
don't want to go in there and sit with everybody
(imagining it) can't
why don't you go
He considers this option as she waits
Suppose  go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar
How's that
Good
That's it
See you
She walks off
He runs a few steps to stop her
Jane
She turns
You're not going to take off on me, are you
Uh-uh
She steps on the escalator
Riding upwards, concern deepens, anxiety flows
Watching her to up the escalator, he finds himself doing simplest thing, stepping onto a moving step
Jane four steps ahead of him -- not yet aware of him
He moves past one other man until he is standing directly behind her
just want you to know that my giving up the Correspondents' Dinner puts tremendous pressure on you
Jane turns and is a bit blown away by his gesture -- life threatens to be good
And now Jane bumps a bit at the top of the escalator, regaining her balance by grabbing Tom's offered hand
As they walk they continue to deliberately hold hands
- are on the studio floor,  on the activity around the Anchor Desk and three cameras
The   stands ready to cue Aaron, the script is ready to roll on the prompter machine
Twenty seconds
Making sure he is seated on his jacket -- taking one last look at the hand mirror being held by the
She starts off -- but Aaron regrabs the mirror almost making her lose her footing -- a check -- then another check -- he points to a spot on his forehead which she dabs with the makeup sponge
Both of them fuss enormously with his hair -- four busy hands
Ten seconds
How many
Ten
Okay
He watches the Makeup Woman scurry underneath a camera lens, resits on his jacket and finally has the moment the system has been denying him for years
We can  the in a barely   from the Floor Manager's earphones
"
with Aaron Altman
" (on ) Good Evening
In mood and language better suited to an espionage novel than the delicate world of the Western Alliance, the British Foreign Secretary today pounced on what he termed, 'The nest of profession spies and amateur traitors who were turning Headquarters into an instrument whose only true function is folly
'  We begin our coverage with Edward Towne in London
Aaron looks up -- takes a breath
He's done well -- he's punched his words and his one thought for the story
His gaze has been steady, his voice firm but he has begun to perspire
He dabs with his finger at the first trickles from his brow -- brushes some more prominent sweat from his upper lip
He beckons nervously to the Makeup Woman -- who comes in and dabs -- then dabs again as Aaron feels himself under his arms
Gee whiz
Five seconds
She scurries away, Aaron reaching for another Kleenex from her box and missing it
graphic illustrating his next scripted section appears behind him
the sub-bases referred to are located in five countries
And now the moisture on his face is clearly discernible -- the Floor Manager and Makeup Woman grimacing at the growing specter as they look at a large monitor
France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain as
And now so much moisture sprouts from his upper lip that he pushes his lower lip out to slurp away the sweat
The Makeup Woman laughs briefly out loud before catching herself
Aaron's eyes dart angrily in her direction
We well as Great Britain
Our own State Department was rocked not only by the revelation but from the highly unusual persistence from the State Press Corps
Martin Klein reports on the ruckus at Foggy Bottom
Half-beat until he's sure that he's off -- his shirt now showing distinct sweat stains
Help me
The Makeup Woman picks up her Kleenex box -- then thinks better of it
Someone finds me some big towels
He blots his face -- some makeup streaked -- by the towel
Five seconds
As she scurries away, this time entering the control room trotting up one stair to look at the monitor
the Director talking to his Camera Operators
'd go looser but we wouldn't see the graphic
(to other Technician) No -- this is more than Nixon ever sweated
The Makeup Woman now looks at the bank of monitors
Can't you just die for him
Aaron's makeup-streaked face
- Tom and Jane walking drinks in hand, her arm around his waist
They stop -- he rests a drink on a ledge and boosts her up and then sits next to her
You okay
Great
that they are sitting on an anti-terrorist concrete abutment protecting a major government building on a beautiful night in our capitol
He is still holding her hand -- and now he notes this
(loudly to himself) Why can't  let go of this woman
Well
He interrupts her with the smallest of kisses -- so mall and swift a kiss that she is left doing her return kisses to mid- air
And then he does something he's thought about many times before -- he briefly caresses her breasts -- while continuing to look at her
At least kiss me when you do that
(a grin) You just can't stop editing me
Huh
This is hysterical
She laughs a little -- then kisses him
They break -- surprised and aroused and look at each other
was half hoping  wouldn't have a good time tonight
You know why
Because you're nuts
Right, right -- Isn't she fun to tease
He leans forward and speaks softly and truly
More and more lately when 've watched you in action -- seen all your energy -- 've been wondering what it would be like to be inside all that energy
She takes a gulp of her drink -- puts a hand to feel the heat on her own cheek
Then turns to him
Right back at you
Several beats
don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly
don't know why  just did
(immediately at work) Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, can think of two reasons
What
Three
just thought of a third
If you talk about it, you don't have to do it
That's not it
Good
Another is you're trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else
She looks at him -- he's thinking
Or it's that great feeling that you don't want to hold anything back
You know, intimacy
She elbows him
Tom takes in the choices -- then: (suddenly) Oh, shit
'm a creep
She moves off the concrete wall
forgot all about Aaron promised to stop by and see how he did
'd like to know
'll go along
No
'll see you at your apartment as soon as  can
She starts to flurry with activity -- moves to the curb when out of nowhere Tom barks a sharp command, the first time any of his actions has been tinged with fury
Thrown, she stops and turns
He walks to her
What happened
Don't run off --  like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind
He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if  go alone -- why's that so hard to understand
It's not that it's hard
just want you to give me a minute to catch up
Okay
(she hugs him) Sorry
(another beat) Don't yell at me like that again, you scared the life out of me
'  - As Jane exits a cab and moves up the steps
'  -  - It is at the top of a flight of steps
She  on the
Aaron opens it
He is wearing a sweatshirt and cords
was in the shower
She enters
'  - How'd it go
You didn't see it or speak to anybody
No
Then it went well
Did it really go well
Define your terms
Do you feel good about it
No
Do others feel that you did well
No
Then what was good about it
lost six pounds
Aaron, will you tell me
It was great
writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought
But  had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again
Oh,  lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway
What do you mean, flop sweat
-- you're making too much out of it
'll bet you were the only one aware of it
People phoned in
Stop kidding
want to know what happened
'm not kidding
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating
No, nice ones worried that  was having a heart attack
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper
don't know
At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny
My central nervous system was telling me something
Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so  could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what  like to do anyway
And 'm chipper because you finally showed up
thought 'd cook for us
Tequila and eggs sound good
have to be somewhere
He looks at a clock reading 1:15 in the morning
told what's his name -- Tom -- that 'd meet him
Call him --  mean it can wait, right
(now the plunge) don't know
may be in love with him
(as if he just burned his hand) No
She starts for the door
Don't go
This is important to me
Yeah
Well
think it is important for you too
Sit down
She sits
He walks to a desk and looks at her briefly
Silence
What
(looking at her) Let me think a second
It's tough
remarkably long silence -- her mind wanders, she takes stock
it is evident that he is straining to get it right, reaching into himself
Aaach
Jane
(glancing at note) Let's take the part that has nothing to do with me
Let's let me be your most trusted friend, the one that gets to say awful things to you
You know
(testy and wary but fair) Yes,  guess
Yes
You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about
Yeah -- being a basket case
know you care about him
've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when  tell you that  believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil
(quickly) This isn't friendship
What do you think the Devil is going to look like if he's around
Nobody is going to be taken in if he has a long, red, pointy tail
No
'm semi-serious here
He will look attractive and he will be nice and helpful and he will get a job where he influences a great God-fearing nation and he will never do an evil thing
he will just bit by little bit lower standards where they are important
Just coax along flash over substance
Just a tiny bit
And he will talk about all of us really being salesmen
(seeing he's not reaching her) And he'll get all the great women
She is getting pissed
think you're the Devil
No
You know that 'm not
How
Because we have the kind of relationship where if  were the Devil, you'd be the only one told
She's briefly impressed
He has a point
You were quick enough to get Tom's help when
Yes, yes
know
Right
And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe 'd be keeping quiet about all this
grant you everything but give me this
he does personify everything you've been fighting against
And 'm in love with you
(realizing) How do you like that
--  buried the lead
He pauses to catch his breath -- breathing deeply through his nose
(an aside) 've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me
(thawing) Sit down, stop
Aaron slumps down -- it's been a long round
've never fought for anyone before
Does anybody win one of these things
'  - in the street below -- he goes towards the window which is blocked by his sofa -- puts his knees in and looks out

woman walking from a car
Momentarily thinking it's Jane
Elated
'
It is not Jane
The
: As he answers and we have the following conversation between Jane, who is using the phone, with Aaron seen just a few feet away
Tom in his apartment
Hi
It's me
Where are you
can't get away just yet
'm at Aaron's
Well, when
'm not sure
It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news
know
taped it
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it
-- it wasn't unprecedented or anything
Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain
'  Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy
You want me to talk to him
Her eyes meet Aaron's
Uh-uh
(to Aaron) He says you could hardly notice it
Aaron beckons for the phone
Jane hands it to him, as she does so: Don't say anything about anything
Hi
Will  ever sing again
Everybody has one like that thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end
Yeah -- well, 'm sorry 'm tying up Jane,  didn't realize you two would be going this late
Sorry
No
Don't worry about it
'll put her on
She takes the phone
Hi, again
Sorry about
No
That sounds more important
Let's forget about tonight
don't know if that's absolutely necessary
've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway
should get some sleep
(hampered by Aaron's presence) Uh-huh
'll see you at the office
Good night
Several beats of silence
Finally: (finally) Hello
Yes
Okay
Good night
(aghast) Good night
Jane, 'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule
Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots now -- huh
Good night
She puts the phone down
beat -- she looks stricken
Aaron looks at her
He just cancelled
He had a chance to think and he cancelled
She bows her head
can't breathe
(aghast) Over a guy
(then) But  can't --  can't breathe
Damn it
She gulps a breath
Her hands on her knees, leaning over -- another deep breath
Aaron takes in the specter
Well, Jane, it was nice of you to drop by
'  - As she enters -- goes immediately to the phone
Cradled in an answering machine -- indexes for sixteen one-button calls, mostly people from work -- "Parents" etc
Jane plays her answering tape
It is silent -- no messages
She fast forwards to double-check
Just the  of blank tape
She pushes the button next to the "Tom Grunick
"  We a busy signal
She hangs up the phone
Then compulsively hits the "Tom" button again
Busy
And again
Busy
She considers for a moment hitting the button next to Aaron's name
(stopping herself) Be fair
She presses the button next to Tom's name
Busy
And again
Busy
'  - As he picks up for newspapers dotting his lawn and opens the door of his car -- just as his wife calls from the door
Ernie, they're calling from work
Tell me 'm on the way in
It's Paul
Ernie, just a bit concerned, walks back to his house -- the four newspapers thick enough to be an awkward carry
' phone in the immaculate living room
(into phone) Hello
Yes
He holds the phone down at his side for a beat, composing himself in the face of a sudden and horrible turn of events
Would there be any point to my going to New York and talking to them
Would there be any point in going over it with you
No, 'm still coming in
He hangs up
What
They fired me
She takes his hand and kisses it -- then hugs him
(weeping) How horrible
We'll be fine
You'll be fine
Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans
No
They're firing even more people than they said
Some will want to talk
It could help
(timidly) could use somebody to talk to on a day like this
(on his reaction) Sorry
Go ahead
He kisses her sad face
Bye, sweetie
Okay, sweetie
He walks towards the door -- picks up his newspapers on the tray beneath the hall mirror and does a start
In the mirror he  his wife making faces at him behind his back
He  his home without comment
- Jane is sitting in her editing cubby -- it is past noon
She rises and stands in her doorway looking toward Tom's office -- the door is open, the room is empty
Blair  carrying an armload of tapes
She looks extraordinary
've got four hours of French demonstrations -- Jane waves it off
Some of it they use water cannons
Jane takes the tape
What are you dressed up for
Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week
spent a fortune on this
Blair
Jane pops the tape in, automatically making timing notes, then standing -- looking again towards Tom's door
'
The door now closed
She stops the tape -- summons herself
She walks towards Tom's office and opens the door
Tom is seated behind his desk
(without passion) kept trying to call you -- you never called me
Were you just diddling me
Is that it--
'm great if 'm helping your career
(mimicking) But when 'm a woman for a second, get immediately fucked around by you
She is obviously in pain but still alert enough to catch Tom's answer
'  - Jane, this is my Dad
And, now  the door a bit more -- Tom's father is seated across from him
(that quickly) Please forgive what  said
(to Tom) Sorry
As she retreats: You just light up a room and leave, huh
She laughs nervously as she exits
You want my opinion
The thing that's easy to miss about Jane is
You want my opinion
And it's okay if you don't
Tom thinks a beat
Yes,  would
The way she just acted is not the way an affectionate person acts
Tom finds the comment off-the-wall enough to be thought provoking
- Paul arriving with Bill Rorish
The first time we have seen the multi-millionaire anchorman in the flesh
He has the grace and dignity of a man who spends every waking moment working on grace and dignity, He and Paul are in the midst of an important conversation -- muted and ominous
Just when do you start, telling people
Almost immediately
'd like to take everyone out after the show
Bill
This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments
But  think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this
If we're not here for each other during the tough time, we're not a news organization
Blair  scene
The smallest flicker of interest from Bill, but more than enough to justify her going into hock for the outfit
Welcome back to Washington
Thanks
self-conscious look of greeting to Paul and she's gone
've forgotten
Was she on the list
Paul nods "yes
" This is a brutal layoff
And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays
(can't resist) You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary
Bill turns: Just a bad joke
'm sorry
Awful
It's a miserable day and that was some kind of totally sick-joke defense mechanism which does not indicate any of my feelings -- not one -- but just shows the kind of stress this represents for all of us
Tom and his Father  the scene from Tom's office
Bill walks to Tom
Hi
It's about time
Good to see you, Bill
they shake: great handshake
' touched, as he watches the networks' most prominent journalist greet his son
This is my father
Good to meet you, sir
Equally touched as he watches the world's most prominent journalist greet his Dad, who turns goofy with excitement
Good-bye, Tom
He puts a big hand on his son's cheek -- a farewell pat
Then whispers in his ear
'm going to go back home and tell all your old teachers
Tom watches his father walk off and moves immediately to Jane's editing room
'   - Tom enters
feel terrible about what happened
What did he say
He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty
(enormously pleased) No
Did he really
Yes
Then he said a really weird thing
(so softly) What
(he means this) That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better
He gets like that sometimes
That's so perfectly
It really makes me feel a little faint
(actually woozy) Whooo
Blair enters wildly into the scene
They canned me
Well, my brother will feel great -- now he's not the only screw-up
It's started
Bobbie sticks his head out of his office
Tom -- Paul wants to see you
Tom focuses and moves off: - Moving with Tom
Nervousness growing, confidence gone, he proceeds down the hallway
'   - He'll just be a minute
Tom sits down -- pats his tie in place
beat and the door opens
Paul leads out Martin Klein
They shake hands
You know 'm just old enough to be flattered by the term, 'early retirement
' That's wonderful
what a lovely line
If there's anything  can do
They shake
(evenly) certainly hope you die soon
little smile to Tom and he's off
Tom
Tom enters the room
nervous cough in evidence as he crosses to a seat
We're having a severe cutback, Tom -- 17 people in this bureau including technical personnel and we're going to reorganize at the same time
We're going to take you out of Washington for a while and assign you to London
- Aaron and Ernie are off to the side in the newsroom -- People are packing their belongings -- as secretaries cry and embrace -- from an office rumbles a shouted denunciation: No
won't keep my voice down
Those sons-of-bitches
They are worse than accountants -- they are bad accountants
Tom enters scene
Have you guys seen Jane
She's in there becoming the first woman bureau chief we've had here
Tom takes this in
What did they do with you
They booted me out of Washington
Impossible
There's no system that wouldn't value one of us
Why
What did they do to you
(pointing at Aaron) It's what he did
'm proud of him
They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line
The cost-efficient reporter
So  quit
weeping woman bursts into their circle and sweeps Ernie away
Tom and Aaron stand there -- comrades at last -- victims of the same sword
You packing up tonight
Yes
And 'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back
Where they sending you
London
(incensed) London
That's a promotion
(defensively) don't think so
It is
Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor
can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it
Hold it down, okay
Can  ask you something
You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right
He extends his hand
Yes
You're not going to stick around for the farewell party
No
don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard
Aaron looks at people packing their belongings in boxes -- a few pockets of conversation
Ernie reading some copy
This story they won't cover
And if the network doesn't cover it -- it must not be important so why worry
(eyeing him) 'm going to miss you -- you're a prick in a great way
Aaron taken by surprise -- laughs
You know what
No,  liked the way it made me sound
Okay
Be good
So long
He exits
'  - he picks up a clean wastebasket and deposits his belongings
scheduled book, clean shirt, two ties, cuff-links, a travel mirror, cassettes of his Washington reporting
His desk clear -- he writes on a clean piece of copy paper
He centers it on his desk
- "Good luck, you'll love the bureau chief
Previous Occupants
" - Tom enters from his office, a wake is slowly igniting
Tom moves along the edge of the room, carrying his wastebasket full of belongings, not really a part of the mournful festivities
'
Jane across the room hugging one person after another
she embraces an older secretary
You know what  always wanted to tell you -- that
Shhh
This isn't the last time we'll see each other
It's not
two-armed tight embrace of Martin Klein
We'll get them back -- it's going to change
Blair is at hand as they embrace
Except for socially, you're my role model
And now she sees Tom -- he mouths one word at her -- "London
" She nods that she already knows and then lets her body sag a little
He gestures her towards her editing room, so they can rendezvous
- Tom enters and waits for Jane
When she enters he closes the door
These people -- it's all so awful
It just hurts physically, doesn't it
Like something's wrong with your bones, like your organs are shifting inside your body
She looks at him expectantly
It's not what he's feeling
Maybe  haven't been here long enough
(great) But, hey, congratulations on the promotion
How can you say that to me
Sorry
(a beat) can't stand here feeing bad that don't feel worse
This has happened at every station  ever worked for
Look,  think it's crazy for you to come in here tomorrow and start a new job
have a week to get to my job
Let's get the hell away to some island fast and find out how we are together away from this
beat -- Jane takes it in
Well,  just think that' an extraordinary proposal
That's yes
That's more than 'yes' -- that's 'you bet
' They kiss
'  - The phone rings
He answers
Hello
'  - Jane -- still at the office -- it is quite late
Bastard, sneak, quitter
Speaking
just found out
You didn't say anything to me
You just resign
Will you meet me now
-- No, now
'm going away tomorrow
Please
-  - Across the street from the bureau's building
Aaron and Jane are having a beer
They are in mid-conversation
Why not try it for a few weeks
Stop
Ernie thought  was good too -- he couldn't help
My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland
The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks
Personally,  think he should aim higher
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me
Because if you are
Ernie told this story
How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried
He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits
He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry
(a beat) should have quit this place  three years ago
You're just trying to say all great stuff so 'll feel even worse that you're not around
He laughs
Let's go
just want to sit here longer,  mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that
Maybe the best part of your life is over and you don't want to get up and start the bad part
Jane looks at him levelly
You are now required to sit here with me
(a beat; then) Come on
be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us
Okay, that's very easy
Five, six years from now 'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations
(smile, it's like old times) Yes
'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and 'll tell him
(deliberately) it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right
hope so
(on her look he relents) No
'm not really mad
(nodding head as if reciting a catechism) 'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always be friends
we'll get hot for each other every few years at dinner and never act on it, okay
Jane smiles -- Aaron has grown suddenly angry
He rises, walks away, then turns
Jane, you know how Tom had tears in the piece the other night
Ask yourself how we were able to see them when he only had one camera and that was pointing at the girl during the interview
(on her reaction) 'm fairly sure  was right to tell you
- We     as Jane enters -- in a frenzy -- searching the stacks
- As she locates the cassette labelled "- - 9/26 - -
" - As she inserts the tape into the player
As she watches
this is what she sees
but the whole thing messed me up more than it should
She cries
We  Tom
' Okay, that will do it
You okay
The tape is rocky now -- the Sound Woman and Cameraman continue to roll as they move towards their next shot -- at times the camera pointing towards the carpet -- but the sound continues
The crew chatting -- mentioning that the tape is still rolling
That's enough
That's enough
'm sorry
Are you okay
Yes, 'm sorry
Don't be silly
What are you sorry about
The way you were looking at me,  just went
Tom moves through the
just need you for another minute now, so we can shoot from behind towards me, and, um
Uh-huh
that way we have someplace to go when we cut
And  just sit here,  nod my head and look nerdy
Young Woman chuckles
Jane chuckles
' Tom Yeah
' It kills me we didn't have a second camera
It was so powerful seeing your reaction
Really
' Yes, it is
' For a second there,  thought you were gonna cry yourself
That would have been something
(considering, then) Then give me a minute
(fully realizing) You fucking
As Jane watches we  Tom work up the tears we saw in the Evening News piece -- as he does so: ' Oh, that's amazing
Jane's shocked reaction: - Jane's cab pulls up to the curb
She gets out -- she is carrying no luggage
She sees Tom who hurriedly walks up to her
Jane is fighting to maintain a calm
Look who's the organized one
've got everything
He briefly opens a paper gift shop bag he is holding and shows her he has bought them each a bathing suit
'm not going
He looks at her with anticipatory distaste evident on his face
Why
saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl
know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview
Tom half turns from her and moves back toward the bench
Jane close behind, stalking him
felt funny about it afterwards
It's verboten, huh
thought since  did it for real the first time -- but  get you
That's not the reason you're not coming
(raising her voice) Of course it's the reason
It's terrible what you did
We disagree on how God-awful it was
Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time
(livid) Jesus, if you're glib about this 'm going to lose it
was up all night and
(calmly) Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane
It made me ill
You could get fired for things like that
got promoted for things like that
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway
You totally crossed the line between
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they
(distaste) It just proves that the difference we have are
This is a one-way argument
We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home
If you don't go
Well, that's a much bigger deal
go to London right after that
So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here
The plane's boarding
You're good at deadline
Here's your ticket
(taking ticket) It's amazing
You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if 'm nitpicking
Try and get this
When you edited that
(deliberately) 'm leaving now
Gate 43
He simply turns and walks away -- looking back once as Jane stands there mucked up by his sudden departure -- the lack of resolution to their confrontation is palpable
- On Tom moving past the metal detector
He too is frustrated -- pissed off at her
Jane moving quickly along towards the metal detectors
As Jane passes through and sets off the buzzer
She stands there -- the heel of her hand pressed to her brow trying to stem the tears
As others look on, she takes a huge key ring from her pocket -- deposits it in the box -- walks through without a buzzer and moves on
- Tom waiting while in the b
g
"People Eater" busses ferry passengers to the plane
As one full "People Eater" pulls away and another empty one arrives
(to Tom) This is the last one
Others start to board
He sees Jane moving towards him
He walks to her, she gestures back towards the street
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye
Even though think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal
You mean something to me
(interrupting) You keep coming after me and looking down on me
It's starting to make me batty
She looks at him
(cont'd) can't help it that they like me
And  like that they like me
And think there's a lot of this job that do well
What do you think it takes to do this job -- the way they have it now
don't wan to discuss work
Well, let's do a special report on that
mean that's news
knew what you meant
What  don't know,  can learn and what  know, nobody can teach
Excuse me for saying it about myself, but  think it's true
(old habit) What do you think
(catching himself) Never mind what you think
They look at each other
You're lucky  came after you so you got that off your
Yes,  am
Thanks
mean it
It's okay
Sir
The pressure begins to bend Jane's resolve
So you have an extra bathing suit, huh
(wary but hopeful) You want to come
(totally open) It's just that one of the few things 'm not confused about is what was saying downstairs, that
(giving up -- sadly, finally) Then you should stay here
(softly) It's better when you let me say it
He hugs her
Now that it's over, they can each openly care for each other
While in the embrace: Take it easy
Why did  have to do this to myself
Watch you take off
(then) Call me if you need anything
He kisses her lightly -- looking at her
Then heartfelt: Oh, honey
He walks to the People Eater and gets on, still holding his paper bags of bathing suits
The bus pulls away
Watching him go
'
Tom standing at the front window of the bus -- framed very much as he is when on television
- Jane gets quickly into cab
Good morning
Good morning
(after collecting herself) Dupont Circle, please
The cab pulls away
Don't take the beltway, because at this time of day there's gonna be a lot
(stops herself, then) Go any way you want
She sits back in the seat (containing herself) before finally and quietly adding what she knows to be true: But New York Avenue's faster
: : - Much the same place where Jane and Tom first met
The words "  " appears on the screen
sign off to one side tells us it's the annual meeting of the Local Television Broadcasters
and that at 2
Tom Grunick will be speaking on "Responsibilities of Broadcast Journalism for the '90s
" - Much the same audience, though two members of the audience may strike particular interest -- curly haired man seen from behind holding a similarly curly haired five-year-old
Tom is in mid-speech
when they told me Bill had decided to retire and offered me the Evening News,  thought it was the same kind of joke we used to pull back at the station -- turning off somebody's prompter in the middle of a show
Some good-natured laughter
(cont'd) And then when they heard my reaction -- they thought  was kidding
told them 'd be their anchor but  didn't want to be the Managing Editor -- that there were people better qualified than  to control the content and if there weren't we were all in trouble
The audience really enjoys this: -- The anchor teams -- leaning forward
They love this man, a humble specialist refusing the generalist trap
Imagine the feeling -- you see, on the top of the mountain, a man not unlike yourself
And now to something more important
'd like to introduce my bride
(gestures to a woman in the front row) Lila
svelte, classic, warm beauty gets to her feet
Aaron and his son as Aaron cranes for a look at Mrs
Grunick
-   - Tom and Lila shaking hand
Aaron, his son in his arms, wait
As he sees Aaron
he is clearly delighted
Holy shit, Aaron
He claps him on the back
Aaron is as pleased as he is uncomfortable with the attention
Lila -- this is Aaron Altman
(high British accent) Oh, yes -- you're one of Tom's 50 or so role models
Hi
Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else
What's your name
Clifford
(indicating Tom) Do you know who this is, Cliff
The big joke
Tom looks at him -- Aaron gives his son a disciplinary nudge
'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him -- thought she'd be here
'll go with you
Okay
(to Lila) 'll see you back at the hotel
(cool) All right
He starts off
She pulls him back for an urgent communication
Tom, the speech was magnificent
Oh,  didn't say anything about your speech
appreciate it
- Tom, Aaron and the boy walking along
Tom plays with Cliff as they move
The boy is delighted
Jane is in a park -- a blanket spread out -- she is wearing shorts and a top -- she has some wine and a small picnic -- a toy for Clifford
She  her name being called
Shielding her eyes from the sun -- now making out Tom
As they reach her
(to herself) Well, why not
(as they arrive) Hey, what is this
My life's rushing in front of my eyes
picnic
thought for ol' Cliff here -- Look at you
You're more adorable than your pictures
Look what got for you
She hands him a toy
What do you say, Cliff
The boy kisses Jane's hand
He excels at gratitude
(to Jane) Are you any closer to a decision
think so
They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor
Really
(to Tom) 'm going to take it
What a great surprise
didn't think we had a chance
heard you wanted to stay in Washington
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot
Well, we should talk
You going to have time for  dinner
'd like you to meet Lila
'm sorry because  was looking forward to that, but ' m going back in a few hours
Okay
It's so good to see you
She gives him a quick kiss
He shakes hands with Aaron
(to Aaron) It's nice to see you
Congratulations on history's longest winning streak
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know
Why
Tom shuffles uncomfortably
Smiling, appreciating Aaron's attitude toward a blandishment of the powerful
(to Jane as he leaves) Bye
boss
Tom walks away
He's a good twenty yards away when Aaron looks up to see his son running after Tom
(calling) Hey
Cliff
Cliff
Tom now notices the boy, leans down and pats him
(to Clifford) Go back to your daddy
The boy starts back
Come on, Cliff
Come on
As Clifford runs back to his father, Aaron sits next to Jane
(to Jane) So who's the guy
Well, we met about three months ago
He works at the surgeon general office
He loves boating
So, he's been getting me into water skiing
Aaron laughs at the very notion of Jane finding water sports a lure
Jane deliberately moves past this moment
like it
So, doll, what about you lately
Well -- my wife got this new job
He continues to talk
As the two former colleagues catch up, their ease returns, if not their intimacy, as the frame locks and the scene slowly recedes into a black b
g
and we
