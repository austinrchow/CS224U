All is quiet
Then a battered - blows by a row of hedges that have been pruned to read: ' '  moment later a    flies by in - - The    and the wind blows back the hair of two --
The driver,  , 40-ish, has a look of determination and resolve on his chunky face, despite the   and -  dangling out of his nose
The nervous passenger is  , 38
Pull over, man
No way,  can out-run 'em
No you can't--not in this thing
Another         and (') Oh God, now there's two of 'em
don't care--'m not stopping 'til we get there
Are you crazy
Yeah, 'm crazy
'm crazy about my wife
- Rick and Fred come   to the followed by the two police cruisers
When they stop, we see that somebody has spray-painted '  ' on the side of the mini-van
Fred jumps out and  toward the entrance spring from their cars and give chase
Before Fred can reach the front doors, he gets   to the ground
Rick climbs out of the passenger seat with
Hear me out, gentlemen,  can explain every--

And
and then: : Law & Order   as we : : '   - - a video shows several  , early- 20's, sunning themselves at the beach

) See the stud in the blue shorts
That's me the summer  got out of college

) Wow, Dad, you used to have muscles

Where
Rick shoots him a look
They're hidden
-    with a knockout body comes up and puts her arms around Rick
Who's that girl
That's Mommy
No,  mean the young one standing next to you
That's Mommy
Mommy used to have long hair
And she wore a bikini
() Yes she did
3
How come she doesn't wear a bikini anymore
Is it because of her fat ass
guess
What
No
Who said Mommy's got a fat ass
Mommy
Well, uh,  don't appreciate that language, Gunnar
You've got the best mom in the whole world--don't ever say anything bad about her
Just then,  comes  into the room carrying a - -  in one arm and a basket of laundry in the other
She's in her late-30's, cute, with short, manageable mommy hair
She's wearing , an  -, and  -
(') Hey beautiful, you better get a move on--we're supposed to be meeting Fred and Grace soon
know,  know, 'm trying
Well how long you gonna be
Forty-five minutes--sooner if you help with the kids
Maggie looks to him, hopeful
() Forty-five minutes is good
Maggie shoots him a look and Rick smiles
(') 'm kidding
Okay, kids, first one in the tub gets college paid for
Emma and Gunnar just stare at him
(') Come on, you bums, let's go
4
As Rick starts to tickle his kids they run out of the room, : - Rick and Maggie walk along hand-in-hand
They're dressed-up and happy-looking
miss going out with you on Saturday nights
She smiles at him
know, it's just like the old days
Rick pulls Maggie close as they walk
Maybe we should make a rule that we go out at least six nights a week without the kids
Maggie
(') 'm serious
We should go out every week--just you and me
walks past them and Rick gives a back
(') think it'd be healthy
You gotta be kidding me
Maggie pulls away
What
You just checked out that girl's butt
did
Yeah, you did, and it's rude
Why
You think she saw me
saw you
5
Oh, uh, yeah
'm sorry, honey, 'm just kind of spacey today
(
) Come on, we're late
reveals Fred Searing and his wife , 38, waiting outside a restaurant
Fred sports a full-head of hair that's maybe a little too stiff
Grace is short and appealing in a Rachel Ray kind of way
Fred leans in to kiss Maggie as Rick kisses Grace
Grace, let me ask you something: Does Fred ever check out other women in front of you
No, Fred's not a gawker
Grace pats a pleased-looking Fred on the head
(') Come on, Mags, let's go say hi to Dr
Lucy
We follow the women as they leave their husbands and the restaurant under a banner that says, 'Boston Psychiatric Association Person of the Year
' - Grace and Maggie approach the check-in table
'  (
) There they are
reveals
, a very attractive and sophisticated-looking 40-year-old, holding court in the corner
Dr
Lucy
Congratulations
Girls, thank you so much for coming
Dr
Lucy speaks with a
Are you kidding me
You're the only friend of ours who ever got an award--you think we're going to miss that
Rick and Fred standing at the bar
Do you mind telling me how your wife catches you checking out another girl
What is this, amateur hour
6
The  delivers a couple beers and Rick pays
The girl walked past and  glanced back at her for like half a second
There's your problem, dumb-ass-- it's the wrong order
You don't wait for the girl to walk past and then glance back
You turn when she's still fifteen feet in front of you
then you wait for her to walk into your line of vision
Fred  an   walking toward them from the right
(') Observe
Before the woman reaches them, Fred turns to his left and holds the look until the Attractive Woman's and he watches her walk away
(') You see
can't help it if her butt walks where 'm already looking
( ) It was your air space
'  (
) Hey, guys
They turn to see a   with a healthy tan walking past carrying several drinks
This is  , mid-30's
Hey, Missy
( back to them) Don't forget to mingle
The guys watch Missy walk away
Wow
Missy's looking pretty good for someone going through a divorce
Yeah, that's rough stuff-- heard they might have to sell the house
Too bad
You gonna hit 'em up for the listing
7
What am , a vulture
Nah,  don't go after the divorcee business unless they approach me first
Yeah, it's kind of tacky, huh
As the guys crane their necks to get a better view of Missy's ass, we
to reveal Maggie, Grace and Dr
Lucy sipping lemondrops and watching Rick and Fred from across the room
Look at those two meatheads checking out Missy Frankenfield
What, do they think they're invisible over there
thought you said Fred wasn't a gawker
He was standing right next to you
can't let him know that  know-- that would take all the fun out of it
() You should see him
He's got some stupid move where he looks back before the girl passes to make it seem like he couldn't help but notice her ass
It's pathetic
Maggie and Dr
Lucy
: '  - Rick's car is parked in the driveway, and he and Maggie are getting out
How about  drive the babysitter home while you go upstairs and prepare the altar
He puts his arm around her as they walk toward the front door
want to, honey, but 've got to get up early with the kids
'll get up with the kids
But  have to go out and buy a gift- -they're going to a birthday party tomorrow
8
'll cjet the gift, then 'll take the kids to the park, then to the party
You can dust stay in bed,, get your beauty sleep, and bask in the sweet, sweet pounding 'm about to give you
love it when you sweet-talk me
Maggie smiles but as Rick opens the front door they - the babysitter (, 20, cute) is standing there with their 4-year-old, Gunnar
Mommy
Daddy
() Little buddy
what are you doing up
Gunnar runs into his mother's arms and Maggie shrugs apologetically to Rick
(') This is just a minor obstacle
: ' - - Rick is at the wheel of his Dodge Caravan and Paige sits in the passenger seat
She is on the busty side
How were the kids tonight
Perfect
That Gunnar is so cute-- all he wants to do is wrestle with me
Rick smiles at this
(') Mr
Mills, would it be okay to turn down the air--'m a little chilly
Look-- got goose bumps
As she     to show him the -, we to the   that are like small tents
Rick as his      and he looks away
9
Oh, uh, sure, 'm sorry
Flustered, he moves to the temperature control which in reads: 69
He quickly / , then trains his eyes straight ahead and grips the steering wheel tight at ten-and-two
Thank you
'Welcome
- The mini-van pulls up in front of a sorority house
' - - Paige hesitates before getting out
Mr
Mills, can  ask you something
Sure
was wondering
( ) could you buy me some beer
Rick looks surprised
Buy you some
How old are you
Twenty
But 'm turning twenty-one next week
Oh
Happy birthday
That's a biggie
Yeah
My aunt usually buys beer for me, but she's out of town
( ) So
could ya
Uh,  don't know, Paige
could get in a lot of trouble for giving alcohol to a minor
Oh, come on, 'm a junior in college
You drank when you were in college, didn't you
10
Well, uh
Besides, it's so arbitrary
How does it make sense that twenty's old enough to fight in Iraq or watch a porno movie, but it's too young to drink a beer
Rick shifts in his seat
Really
Twenty's old enough to uh
Fight in Iraq
No, the other thing
Watch Porn
Oh, God yeah--half the girls in those things are my age
Rick catches a hint of cleavage, a flash of leg
(') Look,  promise no one's gonna find out
If you want, you can join me down at the lake--we'll listen to some tunes and have a couple beers
Rick stares at her, pictures it in his head
She looks hopeful, open
'm sorry, Paige,  can't do that
Why not
Well
it would be
inappropriate
Rick's voice has taken on a firmer, more adult tone
Paige seems amused by it
What, is that your grown-up voice
() That would be inappropriate, Paige
-- No, Paige
(with an edge) What are you thinking
'm a married man and  have a family
You think they'd like it if they knew  was hanging out at the lake, all alone, drinking beer with a college girl
11
She seems taken aback
(-) never said alone
My sorority's having a party down there tonight
Rick   , tries to hide his embarrassment
All right, better get inside
She opens the car door, then glares back at him
Ewww
What the hell were you thinking
Go ahead
Scoot along now
As she  the car door, we
: '  - Rick bounds up the stairs to find Maggie gently closing Gunnar's bedroom door
Shhhh
He just fell asleep
Awesome
Rick playfully pinches Maggie's butt as he follows her into their bedroom where
-- They find Emma sitting up in their bed, smiling
Can  sleep with you tonight
No
Please
No
Absolutely not
Maggie, clearly softening to the idea, shrugs at Rick
12
(') Are you serious
Look, besides the other thing,  don't like the fact that my daughter needs someone to sleep with every night--that's not going to be good when she goes off to college, you know
Maggie rolls her eyes
Well
can someone read me a story
Rick looks at Maggie, then at his daughter
Okay, one quick story
Come on, jump on my back
Emma jumps on Rick's back
(') ( ) You can get started without me-- 'll be right back
Rick piggybacks Emma out of the room
'  - Emma is putting Rick's
Okay, honey, this is the last pony and then night-night
Emma finishes putting on a rubberband, then looks at him, satisfied
There
You look pretty, Daddy
Okay, now give me a kiss, hug and go to sleep
She lays back on her pillow
Rick gives her a big kiss on both cheeks
(') love you, Emma
love you, too, Daddy
- Rick (still in ponytails) tip-toes out of Emma's bedroom, closes the door so tly, then
& '  - Rick scrambles into the room and
13
- Maggie lays in bed,
No
Please, no
Rick wants to wake her up but sees that she needs the sleep, so he just
As Rick walks around the bed and    in the b
g
, we    until she
She listens to her husband brush his teeth with perhaps a tinge of , and when he shuts off the faucet, she , and we
: - Rick pushes Gunnar and Emma on the swings as a sweaty Fred carrying a tennis racket
(We see several in the b
g
) Hey
Hey
How'd you make out
Great
Lost both sets
So'd you get the business
Fred nods and wipes his brow
Pretty sure  got the Auto and Home
He told me to call his accountant on Monday about the Life
Nice
Fred looks around at all the pretty  and  with their
Can you believe the talent here today
() Yeah
know
They  something
- we see a    bent over as she picks up a  from a wagon
Ouch
14
Rick
girl's back, too
Rick nods toward  - , early 30's, The two men look on solemnly
Imagine if we were coming here back when we were single
( ) Oh baby, the damage we would do
Monkey bars
The kids  off the swings and  for the jungle gym
Me first
Rick trails them like a Sherpa carrying a couple Razor scooters and a basketball as Fred tags along
They shlep past  -  playing ultimate frisbee and ''
So you get lucky last night
Nah, the kids were up when we got home
How 'bout you
Well, kinda lucky
Grace conked right out so  snuck out to the car and rubbed one out
Rick shoots Fred a look
The car
What are you Knight Rider
Why didn't you just go in the bathroom like a normal guy
And get caught by Grace
Can't risk it
Besides, cars turn me on--it's where  lost my virginity
And they're comfy-- just put the seat back and turn on the tunes
The guys sit on a bench
That's one of the things they don't tell you when you're young--that you'll still be jerking-off after you get married
thought it was dust gonna be a teenage thing
15 Yeah,  didn't see that one coming
The two men sit in silence for a   as the Frisbee Girls play all around them
(') You know what  miss the most
What
The arch
What arch
You know when you're taking a girl's panties off for the first time, and you're wondering if she's going to stop you, but then she gives you that little pelvic arch- thrust that tells you that the struggle's over, everything's going to be okay
Rick
That's a happy moment
Yep
Another thing gone forever
Rick looks at his watch
should get going,  have to drop the kids off at a birthday party
You want to grab a coffee after
: -   - - Fred and Rick stand in line
Do you have any interest in going down to the Patriot's training camp one of these days
Are you kidding, 'd love that
Except
always feel kind of pathetic waiting in line for Tom Brady's autograph
16
Fred,  was planning on bringing the kids
Genius
That's the perfect cover
Rick shoots him a look then  to something
Uh-oh
- - of a   walking toward him
Her straight brown hair shimmers
her blue eyes twinkle
her white uniformed blouse is unbuttoned enough to reveal a tasteful amount of
This is  , 23, granola, fresh, Australian, spacey
staring in awe
Did you see her face
Her face is tremendous
(chanting, scared) Please don't have a nice ass, please don't have a nice ass
But as she turns to pour a cup of coffee, we see that Rick turns away, annoyed
(' Oh, come on
That's ri iculous
know
She's from Australia
Been working here about a month
Why'd you have to bring me here
Okay, cool it, tiger--here she comes
Coffee Girl steps up to the counter and smiles at Fred
( ) Iced coffee with two Splendas again
Fred wants to say yes, but just nods
(') How about your mate there
() Uh
same
Her smile comes with a squint, which makes her eyes sparkle
17
reveals a  -  , mid-20's (clearly covetous of Coffee Girl) sizing Rick and Fred up as he wipes down a counter
(re: Rick's shirt) Hey, Old Navy, you like a muffin with that
Uh, sure
What do you recommend
They're all good
The Wannabe Artist-Type steps protectively up beside Coffee Girl
'd go with the bran muffin--you guys are probably having digestive issues at your age, right
Rick flinches at this, then turns to Coffee Girl
'll have a blueberry muffin please
Make it a bran muffin for me
Rick shoots Fred a look, clearly annoyed
As Coffee Girl turns to get their order, we go to
- Rick and Fred, now with coffees, sit at the rear of the shop
Did you notice she's from Cleavage, Ohio
Yeah
bet her areolas look like a couple of pepperoni slices
Fred trains his eyes back on Coffee Girl and What the hell are you doing
Shh
'm taking a mental photograph for my spank bank
( ) Say cheese
(
) Jesus Christ, guys, give it a rest
18
Rick and Fred turn to see  , tall, good-looking, mid- 40's, standing at the creamer counter behind them
Oh, hey, Ed
Didn't see you there
That's because you were shooting laser beams at the java babe
Well, no, we were just-- Come on, gentlemen, you're married men and she's half your age--grow - The guys can't muster a response
(') So  guess 'll be seeing you at the house-warming party this weekend
Hm
This Saturday afternoon at the new casa--we're inally in and we're having a little celebration
Oh,  don't know if we can-- Your wives already 'd
Right on
'Til then
Ed     to them
(') Come on, pound the potato
Rick and Fred reluctantly take turns  Ed's fist with theirs
Then Ed leaves
( ) What a d-bag
He's right though
Fred looks at Rick
19
(') What are we doing sitting here gawking at her for
We're married men--it's creepy
don't see what the big deal is-- we're not hurting anyone
What is he Big Brother--he's gonna tell me what  can look at now
For God sakes, don't take that away from me- -it's all  got
As Rick thinks about this, we
: '   - -   to reveal that it's in the middle of a   next to a pile of - Sitting around the table  '  are Rick, Fred, , -, , and , all in their mid-30's to mid-40's
Hog-head has a huge melon, Baker is husky, Flats is a pale red-head, and Gary is slight and squirrelly
Rick, you open
Rick takes a fresh   off the pile in front of him and
Four 9's
Hey, where's Coakley
How come he didn't show
Vegas
Hawaiian Tropic finals
The guys nod their approval
Man, imagine being Coakley
The guy's single, he's loaded, chicks love him, he doesn't have to answer to anybody
That's the life
That is the life
- Let me ask you something: What would you guys pay to have your way with a Hawaiian Tropic girl for an entire weekend
The guys perk up as they think about this
20
- (') You get to pick any one you want-- and you know up front that you won't get her pregnant, no diseases, you're never gonna hear from her again, and your wife will never find out
How's it possible to know that my wife won't find out
- () It's not
'm saying if it were possible, like if  was a magic genie and  could grant you this wish but then make it like it never even happened
But would  still have memory of it
- Oh yeah
Great memories
Oof
think 'd pay 500 bucks for that
Baker shoots him a look
You cheap,bastard
We're talking about an investment that gets your rocks off and protects your wife's feelings
'd pay five grand
Wow
Well, excuse me, Mr
Wall Street, but us public school teachers aren't getting any of that bail-out money you're over-tipping everyone with
Just then, the front door  and Maggie
Hey, guys
Oh, hey, honey
How was the book club
Great
What did you guys read this month
21
Hemingway
Old Man and the Sea
No, Muriel's yoga book
The guys
(') Actually, we were supposed to be discussing The Sun Also Rises but Grace pulled out a bottle of tequila and that was the end of that
So, did the kids go down easy
Gunnar and Emma stalled for a while, but they weren't bad
How about the baby
Rick points to the   in the middle of the table
Not a peep
Great job
Now win some money, honey
She kisses Rick and walks out of the room
wish  could drink tequila
It's a great buzz but it always gives me the spins and then  have to go home early
You want to know a sure cure for the spins
Fred puts a hand over his right eye
(') Just cover up one eye
It balances out the equilibrium
Or you could find a nice 12-step program
: 22
- As Maggie gets to the top of the stairs, she can hear the She walks down the hall, opens the Baby's door and
- the exhausted and sweaty Baby is standing in his crib,
The baby monitor is on the dresser next to the crib  out  from the poker game
- Oh, you poor thing
She hurries to the Baby and
(') Silly Daddy
he got the monitors mixed-up
Have you been listening to those loud-mouths all night
As Maggie moves to turn off the monitor, we : (
) So how 'bout you, Fred--how much would you pay to s end an entire weekend with one of the hottest women in the world
Maggie hesitates and
(
) wouldn't have to pay--'m married to her
There's a , then the guys
(
) (') No, seriously, 'd pay five grand, easy
Maggie's
(') 'd have to figure out a way to get it out of the bank without Grace noticing, but  suppose the genie could help me with that
- You could put me down for seven- five
Pfttt
Hog-head, your ass doesn't have seven-five
More  from the guys as Rick deals out fresh bills
23
So what's your number, Rick
Oh jeez, Flats,  don't know
Come on
any girl you choose
You get to do anything you want with her, and your wife will never find out
It's completely harmless, a one-time thing--what would you pay for that
as she cradles her baby and   to the monitor
(
) honestly don't know, fellas
(
) Ballpark
as she waits nervously for her husband's answer
(
) Well
've got a great wife and sure wouldn't want to hurt her feelings, so
Maggie  at this
That's my guy
(
) (') guess the real question is, what wouldn't  pay
The guys
and  , as we
: '  - Maggie's got Rick backed into a corner
What wouldn't you pay
didn't really mean it, honey
(scared, defenseless) They kind of put me on the spot
Look, some of the other guys were throwing out some pretty hefty bids
What does that have to do with anything
Well
'm the host of the party, didn't want to be a buzz-kill
24 Maggie squints, appalled
(') Look, all  was saying was, there's no amount of money  wouldn't pay to protect you and the kids
How is having sex with a hooker protecting me and the kids
No one said anything about hookers
You were paying for sex--what would you call her
() Well
the genie was getting the dough, not her
() Come on, be reasonable, it was just guy-talk--it's not like it could really happen
Maggie shakes her head, disgusted, and leaves the room
(') ( ) Love you
: - Maggie, Grace, and Dr
Lucy eat at an upscale restaurant
Dr
Lucy listens quietly to the women
Fred said five grand
What a blowhard
You know what's even funnier
Hog- head McCormick said he'd pay seven grand
What
That bum hasn't worked since the dot-com bust--his wife supports him
The girls
(') Well, look on the bright side: At least they're not cheating on us
Sometimes  wonder if it would be better if they did cheat and get it over with
25
You mean, rather than take the slow boat to resentment
The girls look to Dr
Lucy
(' 'm just saying
maybe a little freedom would be good for them
And for you
() Have you ever considered giving them a hall pass
what
hall pass
week off from marriage
Grace and Maggie stop chewing
Wait a minute
Are you saying let them go out and cheat
'm saying give them a week off from marriage
() Look, most married men have foggy memories of their single days and they somehow get under the impression that if not for you, they'd be able to be with ail those women who entice them
That's Fred
He thinks because he sees big tits everywhere and then still comes home for dinner that should be welcoming him at the door like some conquering hero
Dr
Lucy smiles
Well, maybe it's time to let them go out there and find out what it's really like
Wow
You're talking about the nuclear option
Maggie ponders the idea
And remind me again, what good could possibly come from this
26
There's a wonderful principle in psychology called 'reactance theory
' It basically states that if you're constantly told you can't do something, you want to do it more than ever
And conversely, if you remove the taboo, you remove the obsession
Grace makes a 't' sound
() got an idea, Doc: Why don't you try a hall pass out on your husband and let us know how it works out
Oh,  have
Grace and Maggie  to this
You're telling us you let Charlie sleep with another woman
Dr
Lucy takes a moment before answering
am not telling you that
am telling you that  gave him the freedom to choose for himself
And
All  know is
our marriage is better than ever
Grace and Maggie think about this
don't know
There's a reason that men evolved and apes didn't
It's because women demanded more
Without a wife, Einstein would've been humping a maple tree all day
As the women , we : &  '  - There are several flashy cars out front of this huge McMansion
As Fred and Grace and Rick and Maggie get out of Fred's mini-van, Ed Long comes out of the house to greet them
(Ed's 5--  is beside him wearing khakis and a Polo shirt, just like his father
) There he is
The lord of the manor
27
Come on, everyone in the shack
The grand tour's about to begin
- Ed and his wife  (late-30's, high-maintenance) lead Rick, Fred, Maggie, Grace, and    into a large wood-paneled study
(The Long's 7-- sticks to her mother's side
) call it headquarters
, mid-40's, and his blonde bombshell of a wife, , (who wears  - -) look around in awe
Un-believable
That's sweet of you to say, Mandy
It's epic, Ed
Ed points to one wall which houses a -
(: ) And this over here--this is the war room
The temperature in there never goes above fifty-four degrees, never below fifty-three even threw in a back-up generator in case we lose power and the main generator doesn't kick in
Now who wants a Cubano
They're the real deal--Coakley snagged them on his trip to Havana
Wait a second, Ed, first  want to show them Lny headquarters
Fred looks at Rick and rolls his eyes
- It looks like a Waterworks showroom
Despite its bloated opulence, Grace and Maggie can't help but be impressed
It's my paradise
With a price tag north of one hundred and forty large, it better be paradise
Ed holds out his fist and Rick obediently
Just then Grace  that Fred has disappeared
28
Hey, where did Fred go
Rick turns and sees that he's missing
- Rick walks down a hall and finds Fred in a guest room watching a baseball game on
What are you doing
can't take these look-at-how-much- -own parties
It's obnoxious
Rick nods and sits down beside him
(') When  bought my completely-loaded Honda Odyssey,  didn't go around bragging about it, did
Well, kind of
You made me drive around town with you for two hours, remember
() thought you'd want to watch a movie in a mini-van
You never got to watch a movie in a mini-van before, did you
Rick shrugs
Why'd you have to hook your boat up to it
Because it's the Touring Edition, numb-skull
The thing can tow more weight than ninety percent of the pick-ups out there
: - Everybody is admiring the antique fireplace
The mantle actually came all the way from Tuscany, which is in Europe
Hey, gang, check this out
29
Oh God, Eddie, they don't need to see that--they'll think we're wackos
Ed    into a keypad and the revealing a
- Maggie, Grace, and the others follow Ed into a safe room filled with   surveilling all the rooms in the house
When Kimmy  she pushes a button Oh my God
this is like secret agent stuff
think having a safe room is a bit over the top, but Ed feels with our two little ones you can never be too cautious
Aw, you're such a good daddy
(aside to Grace) Rick can't even set up the baby monitors right
Ed points to a monitor where we see Rick and Fred  the master bedroom
Here come Tweedle-dee and Tweedle- dum
- we see Rick and Fred cross over to the master bathroom doorway and look in
( ) All 'm saying is, who gets a mini-van when you don't even have any kids
( ) You don't know much about the insurance game, do you, Rick
When you pull into a person's driveway to sell them life insurance, who do you think they'd rather see
hot- shot in a Porsche or a family man in a mini-van
Hm
Rick looks around the empty room
( ) Hey, where'd everyone go
30
( ) Guys, we're in here
They can't hear you
The room's completely soundproof
And bulletproof
- we see Rick and Fred and
- Rick and Fred walk back into Ed's study
They must've gone downstairs
Fred motions to Ed's humidor room
( ) Thanks for coming to the war room, old chap
By the way, did  mention that my wife's vagina never goes above fifty-four degrees, nor below fifty-three
- Larry Bohac  and Grace shifts uncomfortably
Uh, maybe we should turn this off
But Ed turns
- Rick plays along with a ( ) Is that so, dear boy
And what happens if you lose power during a big blow and your main generator doesn't kick in
( ) Well that's why  had the back-up generator installed in Kimmy's rumpus
Kimmy makes a face, shocked
(under breath; resigned) Here we go
31
- Hey, speaking of installations, is that a shiny new set of cans on Mandy Bohac
Either that or she's wearing her daughter's t-shirt
- Mandy's surprised face
She looks at Larry, who's suddenly not so amused
- They look good but 'll still take the real deal any day
Right
You're telling me you'd take Kimmy Long's flapjacks over Mandy's new speedbags
That's what 'm telling you
like boobs with a little mileage on 'em
They're more fun
Fun
Yeah
You can smoosh 'em, swing 'em, hump 'em, Stretch-Armstrong 'em
And what about the proven correlation between floppy boobs and large-mouth vaginas
: &  '  - Maggie and Grace hurry down the front walk trailed by their shell-shocked husbands
trembling and  Kimmy is held back at the door by Ed and a couple other Guests
You people are horrible
Horrible
( ) 'm very disappointed, gentlemen
32
- - No one speaks
Grace drives and Maggie sits beside her, humiliation etched across their faces
Finally: Uh, anyone thinking chocolate chip cookie dough in a waffle cone
Grace  the mini-van to the side of the road and Large-mouth vaginas
As the guys cower, we : & '   - Rick looks small and weak sitting on the couch while Maggie stands across from him rubbing her temples
It looks like the Norman Rockwell painting where the mom reprimands her little boy for sneaking a frog into the house
You know what really troubles me
The thing that you're all so obsessed with is meaningless to you
It's really just about numbers with you guys
Rick looks up, confused
(') Rick, you can't even tel me the month you lost your virginity can tell you the exact day and hour that  lost mine
Rick seems a little embarrassed by this
Well, virginity is different for guys
The point is, obviously  like sex, too--it means something to me--but don't walk around gawking at every guy  see
All right, so  occasionally notice other women
'm sorry
Occasionally
Rick rakes his hands through his hair and decides to come clean
33
Okay, you want the truth
You really want me to pull back the curtain here
From the moment leave the house in the morning 'til the moment  get home,  pretty much notice every woman in my path
Maggie turns to face him
(') But it's not how you think it is, Mags
It's like
it's like a curse
don't want to notice, but can't help it
It's always been like that
figured that when c jot married that would be it, but it wasn't--the thing,doesn't give two shits about marriage
() So what are you saying--you're not happy with our sex life
Rick reaches up and takes her hand
No
Of course 'm happy, honey--our sex life is great--not that wouldn't mind a little more, but-- look, one thing has nothing to do with the other
think about sex a lot--all guys do--that's just the way it is
Maggie sits down beside him, clearly at the end of her rope
No one speaks for a few moments
Then: 'm giving you a hall pass
what
One week off from marriage
You mean, like a trial separation
You are seriously overreacting
It's not a separation, it's a hall pass
You can do whatever you want
Get it out of your system
() Wait a minute--are you for real
34
It's not a yes or no offer, and it's not a debate
You're getting a hall pass
As Maggie heads upstairs, we   on a confused Rick
: '  - Maggie is washing out a pan at the sink when Rick dressed for work
We hear the
of The Wiggles coming from a  in another room
'Morning
(not facing him) There's a couple hard-boiled eggs in a bowl there for you
'm gonna have to take them to go, hon, 've got a showing in fifteen minutes
Rick puts the eggs in his pocket, then approaches Maggie and kisses her on the cheek
(') Hey, about this hall pass business
1 don't want it and don't need it
All  need is-- told you, this isn't negotiable
She turns and faces him
You're really serious about this
Rick, this isn't something that look,  really think you need this
think we need this
Rick doesn't know what to say
(') This afternoon 'm taking the kids out to my parent's beach house
Rick  to this
For how long
35
We'll be back in one week
And as far as 'm concerned, starting right now
you have the week off from marriage
: - This is a big shiny place
All fixed-up
Fred pulls up in his mini-van and gets out
He walks past a Coldwell Banker For Sale sign with Rick's name on it
- Rick is showing the kitchen to a , mid-40's, when Fred Hey, what are you doing here
called your office and they told me you were in the neighborhood
Rick turns to the couple
Oh, this is a friend of mine, Fred Searing
Fred, this is Harold and Nancy Goldberg--they're moving up here from Long Island
Well, mazel tov, folks
The Goldbergs look at Fred a little warily as he takes out a card
(') Here, let me give you my card
Home, auto, or life insurance--'m the go-to mensch in town
We're good on insurance
Rick quickly jumps in
(to the Goldbergs) Uh, why don't you two take another look around and if you have any questions 'll be right here
Thank you
The Goldbergs walk out and Rick closes the door behind them
36
() What the he 1 are you doing--'m trying to make a sale here
You weren't picking up your cell-- wanted to see how much trouble you got in last night
You know what Grace made me do
She made me call the Longs and apologize
Rick flinches
Oof
How 'bout you--did Maggie freak out when you got home
Uh
sort of
Rick peeks out the kitchen door to make sure the Goldberg's aren't listening
Then: (') She gave me a hall pass
what
week off from marriage to do whatever  want
She's going to her parents' house down the Cape 'til next Sunday
Fred
Yeah, right
'm serious
You're full of shit
Fred, it's true
You think  could make something like this up
Fred stares at him
don't get it--why aren't you more excited
Well
don't know how  feel
37
About
The hall pass
Something about it isn't right
You mean, like, you think Maggie might have a brain tumor or something
No
mean, just because my wife tells me it's okay to cheat
is it
Uh, yeah
() Why can't you just accept the fact that your wife is a goddamn saint, Rick
She's evolved
Don't you see
She gets it
Yeah, but there's a part of me that's saying, 'Wow, you must have pushed her pretty hard to get her to this point
' And is that good for a marriage
That your wife is willing to try something this insane
Fred can't believe his ears
Absolutely
() Come on, doesn't it bother you that our wives dreams all come true, but ours don't
Look at Maggie; when she was a kid she played house--you g a ve her a house
She played with her --Bake Oven--you bought her a Viking
She played mommy--you made her a mommy
The oven's a
It's a real gas oven
And what about you, huh
Come on, man, your wife is living her dreams
and now it's time for you to live yours
As Rick thinks about this, we : & '  - Fred and Grace climb the stairs at the end of the day
38
don't know,  think this is some very forward-thinking on Maggie's part
Quit lobbying--you're not getting a hall pass
And you mark my words, this is going to end up biting Maggie in the ass
At the top of the stairs Fred puts his arms around her
Why would  need a hall pass
've got you
Not tonight you don't
'm too bloated and  have cramps
don't mind
Fred, do  have to spell it out for you
'm having my period
(--) Yeah,  got that
He moves in for a kiss but she pulls away
Come on, hon, give me a break
Not tonight
Disappointed, Fred watches her walk toward the bedroom
( ) Oh, shit-- forgot to take the trash out
: & '  - Fred's mini-van is parked on the street in front of his home
We  Styx's The Best of Times coming from inside the car and we    until we're
at Fred
He's sitting in the driver's seat; his    and his head is slung back as he - (just below frame) to the
passes in the b
g
, then a moment later and
As the two   look on from their car trying to figure out what the guy is doing, the oblivious Fred continues to    to the
39
Officer #1 gets out of the driver's side
He and then  at Fred's driver's side window
Now only inches from Fred, he bends over and The Officer motions for his partner to join him
As Fred continues to     , Officer #2 climbs out of the cruiser
He takes out his flashlight and '
As the weary officers look at each other with a -'--- , we
: - The police lights are  now and several  have gathered on their front lawns to see what's going on
to Fred's front steps where we see a  Fred standing meekly as the two Police Officers confer with a furious-looking Grace (in her bathrobe
) #1 All right, ma'am, if you say he's yours
you can have him
The Officer   '
Thank you, officers
Fred scurries into the house ahead of Grace
As soon as the door shuts, we : (
) (') As the Police Officers head back to their car, we go
a smiling Fred
got a Hall Pass
'  - Rick is at his desk staring at a giddy Fred
How
Doesn't matter how
got one
Can you believe it
got a hall pass
Rick stands up, elated
And 've got a hall pass
We both have hall passes
40
When does yours start
Fred looks at his watch
Twenty-three minutes ago
She just left for the Cape--she's staying with Maggie
It's just you and me for the next six days
Oh my God, do you realize how much easier this is going to make it-- having a hall pass partner
And it's not just me--Baker, Gary, and Hog-head are coming out with us tonight
No way
They got hall passes, too
No, no, no--they just want to watch
Rick grows concerned
You think that's a good idea, letting them in on it
What if they blab and it gets around town--it might embarrass our wives
Don't worry,  already talked to them
Their lips are sealed
Rick and Fred smile
(') We're living the dream, baby
: Law & Order   as we : 1 - Rick, Fred, and their -  (Baker, Hog-head & Gary) walk across a boulevard like rock stars
(Think of the - shots from Swingers or Reservoir Dogs
) Nobody smiles, they're all business as they hit the sidewalk and march straight into
'
' - They step up to the bar
41
( ) Five 's, my friend
While waiting for the beers, the guys
It's mostly , a few
(') The guy at the Holiday Inn Express told me this place really kicks in around nine-thirty
Hey, why are you staying at a hotel if your wives are out of town
Well, we can't very well take babes back to our places--if they know where we live they might end up stalking us
Besides,  wouldn't be able to concentrate with all the pictures everywhere and the kids' cut-outs all over the fridge
Yeah, isn't it weird how your own kids can creep you out sometimes
Rick shoots Gary a look
get the feeling there's a lot of divorcees in this place
- That's good
Divorcees are into kinky sex--that's why they're divorced
Just then the  arrives with the Miller Genuine Drafts and the guys
- (') So come on, point out which girls you guys are gonna do tonight
Gary elbows Fred as he spots  -  at the end of the bar
What about those two
Why don't you bang them
No way
They're doing the --- -- they're obviously hiding something back there
42 Okay, how about the blonde hostess
Maybe somebody should nail her, huh
Attempt to be cool, Gary--we've got a whole week
Baker looks around at the lame bar scene
Are you guys sure that Applebee's is the best place to be picking up women
What are you thinking--Olive Garden
Nah, that's only good on Thursday nights
- Hey, what about the auto show
Baker shoots them a look
Are you guys for real
Wait a second--where's Coakley
That's where we should be
He's in Iceland
What's he doing there
What do you think he's doing there
The guys all nod at this, proud of him
Look, before we go bagging any chicks,  gotta get a hunk of beef in me
Hey,  got a guy over at Outback Steak House who could set us up
Ooooh, he's got pull over at Outback
Wow
Hey,  like Outback
Let's chug these and hit the road
43
As the guys drink up, Hog-head puts his arm around Gary
- Hey, Gar, you don't happen to have any connections at 7/11, do ya
Maybe someone could hook me up with a player's card so  can cut right to the front of the raspberry slurpy line
The guys all , as we : - This is an old summer shack nestled on a quiet bluff overlooking the sound
- Grace stands at the window staring out on the ocean, while Maggie nestles on the couch reading a summer novel
The kids are asleep and the place is quiet
think we might've made a huge mistake
Stop thinking about it, Grace
Why don t you just try to get some sleep
Grace turns to Maggie
Sleep
can't sleep
don't understand you--how can you Just sit there and read knowing that Rick could be making out with a supermodel right now
Maggie doesn't answer
(') Our husbands aren't married this week
Do you know what husbands do when they're not married
Shh
You're going to wake the kids
Are you going to sit there and tell me you're not the least bit concerned about what they're doing right now
Maggie
Okay
'm a little concerned
44
Grace flops into the chair across from her
(') Of course 'm concerned
But what choice did we have
We could've kept the status quo mean, were things really that bad that we had to try something this extreme
For me they were
() Look, you may call this a hall pass, but for me it's more of a Hail Mary pass
'm serious, don't know what else to do
Grace looks at Maggie, surprised
(') Remember last week when we went to Lucy's award thing
Grace nods
(') That night when we got home, Rick and  were gonna
you know
and was waiting for him in bed while he tucked the kids in, and  started wondering who he would be thinking about during sex
Would it be the girl he checked out on the way into the party
Or would it be Missy Frankenfield--because  noticed him gawking at her
Or how about one of the waitresses, or maybe somebody he saw at work that day
Then when he came into the room,  did something 'd never done before: pretended to be asleep
You're kidding me
You've never done that
do that all the time
Maggie almost smiles
Look,  understand that people have fantasies and that you're not always thinking about the person you're with
That's for sure
But it's just
don't know
it's been too long since  felt that he was thinking about me
45
They sit there for a moment, quiet
Then: (') need this hall pass to work, Grace, because if it doesn't, don't know what's going to happen
: - We see two    walking out with doggie bags
- Our five guys are in a  , slouched in their chairs nursing red wines and talking through
Several ,  , - , and   , and -  litter the table
Okay
so where to now
Rick can't think in this state
Fred
Hm
Answer Baker
What's the question
What are we doing for the rest of the night
() don't know
Getting laid, right
- gotta go home and poo
Now
- Yeah,  put too much Hollandaise on the mozzarella sticks
Why don't you just back one out here
- 'm pretty sure 'm gonna need a bath afterwards
46
Baker musters some initiative and
Come on, you guys
say we go to a strip club and smoke cigars-- that 11 wake us up
got a better idea
Rick
(') Let's go night-night
What
say we tie a bow on it and put her to bed
This is gonna be a long week so we should pace ourselves
Baker looks at his watch
It's only nine-thirty
'm with Rico
() Freddy tie-tie
() Are you guys serious
Relax, guys, this is just the calm before the storm
Get out the plywood and batten down the hatches
That's right
Tonight we build up strength, tomorrow we make landfall
: Law & Order   as we : 2 - Rick, Fred, Hog-head, and Gary are stretching on the first tee of a local -   while taking in the sights
Nearby, we see the hotel swimming pool lined with in bikinis
47
- Wow
This place sure beats the hell out of the Holiday Inn Express
Why aren't you staying here
Too pricey
Besides, since we're paying for golf we get full access to the resort--including the pool bar
Mothers, lock up your daughters-- the dogs are off the leash
Turn-and-burn, baby
Gary raises his hand for a -, but Rick balks
(') Nope
don't do that
- Hey,  say screw the golf--let's go straight to the pool bar and start getting you guys laid
Hoch-head, relax, the pool bar ain't going nowhere
Besides, it'll be good for us to get a little sun before making our grand entrance-- chicks love a healthy glow
Plus it wouldn't hurt to work up a little sweat--get those pheromones flying
Just then, two sexy -  wave as they pass
- You talked me into it
Hey, guys, look what  brought
Gary holds up a   full of something chocolatey
What's that
Pot brownskies
The guys all look at one another, baffled
What, are we on spring break
Where the hell'd you get those
got an in
48
With who
Guy who washes my dog
Go ahead
He holds out the bag and the guys hesitate
(') Eating it isn't like smoking it
It's a much mellower buzz--you'll just feel relaxed
- Are they chocolatey
As Hog-Head  the brownies, Rick takes a practice swing
Hog-head, come on, who eats pot brownies at eleven in the morning when they're playing golf
- John Daly
And by the way, Rick, this is spring break
You've got a hall pass
Live it up, man
It'll probably help your rap with the ladies later
- Gary's right--when are we ever gonna get the chance to do pot brownies again
Hog-Head takes a brownie and
- (') Mmm
These are yummy
You don't even have a hall pass
- So
can still live vicariously through you guys, can't
It's not vicarious if you're actually doing it
- Whatever
Just hit your ball
Hog-Head takes
Oh, what the hell, it's not like my game can get any worse
49
Rick watches Fred pick up a brownie and
Then Gary
All right, give me one of those things
As Rick drops his club and walks toward the brownies, we : 75 - dazed and confused Rick and Fred are  in their cart in the middle of the fairway
For a while neither of them speak
Then: What kind of soap do you use
() You mean in the shower
Yeah
Dove
Yeah,  like Dove--it doesn't dry your skin so much
Fred stares into space
(') Sometimes it's hard to wash off, though
Because of the moisturizer
You ever notice--
think Hog-head's dead
Fred looks over and sees Hog-head He's not moving
( ) Hog-head
Are you okay
As Hog-head starts to make     , an elderly   pulls up in a golf cart
What the hell is he doing
Rick and Fred grow visibly tense at the sight of an authority figure
Uh, he's having back spasms
50
Not him
Him
Rick and Fred turn and see Gary  - in the just
( ) Gary
What are you doing
don't know--you tell me
Gary starts to
The Ranger turns to Rick, annoyed
Look, this is the third time 've had to flag your group and you're only on the fourth hole
Now if have to come out here again, you're done for the day
Gotcha
We'll pick it up, sir
The Ranger shoots them a look and   toward the waiting on the tee behind them
: : 27 - The four guys are unnaturally bunched together on another fairway
Think
Where did you last see it
On the course
Where on the course
don't know--on a fairway, think
clot out, grabbed my club, took a swing, and when  turned around it had disappeared
You're serious
You're telling us you lost your golf cart
( ) Dude, where's my golf cart
51
Shut up, Fred
- Guys,  gotta go poo again
didn't lose it,  think it was stolen
() Who would steal a golf cart
Gary shrugs
Criminals
- Does anyone have any napkins
Look, all  know is  had it on the seventh tee and now it's gone
What are you talking about
We're only on the sixth hole
What
Did we miss a hole
Where's my kids
Rick closes his eyes and rubs his head, trying to keep it together
Then he  something
Oh, come on, man
Hog-head down in a greenside bunker As he starts to   over his like a cat in its litter box, we  a noise and the guys look up
- the Golf Ranger comes flying over a hill heading straight for them
Run for it
The guys run toward Rick's cart, jump in, and take off
Rick and Fred are in the seats, while Gary and Hog-head The cart  down a cart path with the Ranger He's gaining on us
can't go any faster, 've got it floored
52
Cut through the woods
Without slowing down, Rick      and Gary and Hog-head
With panic etched across their sweaty faces, Gary and Hog- head quickly jump to their feet and run after the cart
Rick slows just enough for them to catch up and jump back on, then he speeds down a maintenance path and - Ed and Kimmy Long are sitting at an outside table having lunch with their two young children
Their 7-Year-Old Daughter is again dressed just like her mother and the 5-Year- Old Son is dressed like the father
7-- Hey, Mom, look
The family turns to see
- a stoned-looking Rick, Fred, Hog-head and Gary are driving the golf cart down the city street
They stop at a traffic light beside them
All the guys stare straight ahead, -, except for Fred who  the Longs
He nods
Ed
Kimmy
Clones
The light changes and as the golf cart   through the busy intersection, we go shaking their heads
Their poor wives
: Law & Order   as we : 3 - It's a picture perfect day as a   watch a Cape Cod League baseball game rom the comfort of their picnic blankets
The home team has loaded the bases in the bottom of the ninth and Grace, Maggie, ' , and the kids are
The       , and as the and    the
- The  and  mingle on the field immediately after the game
53
Grace and Maggie stand near the pitcher's mound as they watch Maggie's kids run the bases
The wives look  and from several days laying on the beach
Just then a big, goofy kid named  approaches
He's a strapping 22-year-old first baseman from Puerto Rico with a perpetual -
Hey, 'm Gerry--thanks for coming out and supporting us
Oh, it was fun
You guys looked good
Thanks
Gerry glances back at his  who are clearly egging him on
(') So
we saw you sitting up there with those little kids--are you nannies or something
The girls aren't immune to flattery and they smile
No, they're my kids
() Yeah, right
You have three kids
Uh-huh
couple other  amble over
Dudes, they're not nannies, they're mommies
#2 No way
Well, she is, not me
'm not old enough yet
Maggie and the players
(
) Guys
The players turn to see their coach,  , approaching with ' , mid-70's
(') Time to pack things up--let's go
54
The Players quickly scatter
' Maggie, Grace, this is Rick Coleman- -the coach
Rick Coleman is a granite-jawed 38-year-old with a good head of hair and an easy-going manner
hope those clowns weren't bothering you
Oh, no, they were sweet
Yeah
Cute kids
So you're the guy who's been taking money off my dad every Saturday on the golf course
hate to break it to you but your old man's the one who's been taking all the money--he's a thief
Maggie's Father
(') Hey, everyone's coming back to my place for some beers and a barbecue- -why don't you join us
Oh, thanks, but we've gotta get the kids home
' Your mom and  will take 'em home
You two go out and have a good time- -cripes, you haven't been out all week
Grace perks up at this
Oh,  don't know, Dad, we really ' -- Excuse me, can  have a word with you
Grace pulls Maggie aside
(') () What's your problem
55
Oh, come on, Grace, these guys are barely out of college, and, in case you've forgotten, we're married
To who
Last  heard, Rick and Fred had the week off from marriage
So remind me again--who are we married to
Maggie thinks about this
Well
guess one beer won't kill us
() That's my girl
Grace glances over at the ballplayers
(') Why shouldn't we have fun
God knows our guys are living it up
: -  - - What would you guys rather do--make- out with a guy or let him blow you
that
- Our five guys are sitting at the bar drinking beer and devouring plates of
Around them we see about fifty 's  twenty different sporting events
There's logos everywhere and not a woman in sight
- (') And you've gotta pick one or someone in your family will die-- that's the rule
Oh boy, that's a toughie
How long would you have to make-out with him
- Ten minutes
Tongue
56
- Of course
And how long would he have to blow you
- Seven minutes
Oof
mean, getting blown by a dude is bad, but making out with a guy, it's so
intimate
You think it's more intimate than getting blown by a guy
Way more
All right, the hell with this shit, 'm outta here
Baker gets up from his stool
( ) What
Why
wanted to watch you guys pick up chicks, not talk about dicks
Hey, greased lightning, let off the gas--sometimes these things take time
Baker's right
This is day three and you haven't even talked to a girl
() That's not exactly accurate, Gary
Thanks to your scrumptious brownies,  did spend half of last night talking to Judy on the drug- and-poison hotline
Hog-head and Gary stand
- guess 'm gonna get going, too
Yeah, this is boring
You guys are pussies
57
Hey,  haven't seen you guys talk to any girls
We don't have hall passes
( ) Come on, guys, let's go
The three friends start to leave but Hog-head stops and turns
- Hey, guys, it's all right if you strike-out
but for godsakes, at least take a couple of swings
moment later the guys are gone and a humbled Rick and Fred sit there feeling alone
( ) This is actually good--you know, that they're leaving
You don't need five hunters to bag two birds
No, you do not
And  love those guys but, let's be honest, they're not exactly chick-magnets
You can say that again
Yep, the steak always looks better if you trim away some of the fat
And let's face it, we are the steak
Dream team, baby
The guys
Then: (') Maybe we should call the girls and ask them to come home
Fred glances at him, aghast
What
Who are we kidding, man
Do you really think we're going to be picking up any girls this week
Why wouldn't we
Because that's not us anymore
Wait a second
You want to quit
58
Fred, we're not the same guys we were fifteen years ago, back when we were single
We've changed
Fred stares at him, incredulous
No, man, you've changed
All you care about is yourself--what about all the guys out there who are counting on us to make this thing work
What are you talking about
Don't you get it
( ) We're the chosen ones
Fred stands up and points at Rick
(') That's right--this thing is bigger than us
Our wives didn't give us this hall pass, the good Lord did
And what do we have to show for it
Nothing
Come off it, Fred
Obviously hooking up isn't something we really want--if it was, we could've done it by now
Could we have
Rick is taken aback by this
( ) Well
of course
mean, if we'd really wanted to
Guess what
did want to
And you know how close  got
We're three days in and the only woman 've spoken to was our waitress at Outback
And she never even made eye-contact
don't really care if some waitress makes eye-contact
want to go home-- miss my wife and kids
59
Let me explain something to you: If Grace and Maggie find out we can't get laid on our own, they'll start thinking we need them to get laid
Do you know what that'll do to the balance of power in our homes
It'll destroy it
Rick thinks about this and grows alarmed
Well, what if we just tell them that we did hook up
We can't
Grace'll know
She always knows when 'm lying
Hey, what about a massage parlor
No
That's giving up
Fred glares at him
(') You don't get it, do you
hall pass ain't all about sex
It's about being man enough to pick up a woman even though you may not be what--in the traditional sense--is considered
(makes quotes with ) good-looking, or
(finger quotes again) appealing
Rick seems stung by this news
(') Look, if we can't show that something positive can come from having a hall pass, then the whole concept is dead
Not just for us

Rick thinks about this for a moment, then stands up with a All right, let's get out of here know exactly where we should be

) So how about you, Rick, do you have any children
Nah, but maybe some day
Your mom keeps talking about hooking me up with your cousin Kate
Maggie
(') That's not a good sign
No,  hardly know her
She moved to Miami when  was eight
That's what your mom said

Then you should go out with her
Nice try
() So how about yourself--how long you been married
Uh
fourteen years
We were college sweethearts
Nice
And where is he this week
He's up in Boston
Poor guy
All work and no play, huh
Maggie forces a smile
Something like that
Suddenly Grace is      and '
Stop it
What are you doing
61
Gerry  and     and Grace and Maggie and the coach can't help but  along with him, as we : - Rick and Fred pull into the hotel's lot in the mini-van
As Rick gets out, Fred reaches behind his seat and comes out clutching a
Rick stares at him
() Chicks dig motorcycles
'  - It's 80's night and a Hall & Oates cover band is complete with look-alikes, except Oates is black
Behind the band there's a banner that reads: 'Ramada Inn proudly welcomes the Mutual of Omaha Leadership Council
' We see middle-aged   everywhere

Oh-oh here she comes, watch out boy she'll chew you up
Oh-oh here she comes, she's a maneater
" where Rick and Fred are checking out the scene
Fred is
(It's a huge , ) He pulls it off, , and places it prominently
Jackpot, baby
Rick
How about those two
two pretty   sitting alone at a table
Ooh, yeah
Daddy likes
Fred pulls a piece of paper out of his back pocket and hands it to Rick
What's this
went on-line this afternoon and wrote down some good pick-up lines to break the ice
() 'Hi
Will you help me find my puppy
think he ran into the cheap hotel across the street
' 62
That's a good one--except for one thing: We don't have a puppy, so when she gets there she'll realize we're full of shit
Rick shoots him a look
don't think it's supposed to be for real
It's just to make her laugh so she'll talk to you
Fred considers this
Oh God no, it doesn't work on that level
Here, this is my favorite
He takes the paper from Rick
(') () 'You must be from Ireland because when  look at you my penis is Dublin
' It's a charmer but you know what
We don't need phony pick-up lines
Why don't we just be ourselves
Great
If you know how to
Rick takes a   and braces himself
Give me the helmet
Fred hands him the helmet, then Rick marches up to the two Latino Women with the helmet under his arm and Fred close on his heels
(') Hi
The women give him a pleasant look
#1 Hello
Fred gives a little wave from behind Rick
Hola
as Rick tries to figure what to say next
Then: Well
this is awkward
feel like 'm back at my first junior high school mixer
63
Rick and Fred force a  and the girls smile
Another ,
Rick clears his throat
') So
are you ladies from Ireland
#2 No
'm very surprised to hear that news, because when  look at you my penis doubles in size
The women  at this, losing their smiles
Fred leans in
No, he means his dick is Dublin
Like the city
In Ireland
As the girls turn away from them, we begin a
- Hall & Oates'  Can't Go For That plays as our     by a
- Rick and Fred are at the bar looking  and
have this overwhelming urge to donkey-kick everyone in this bar
Okay, tiger, keep your chin up--no one said this was going to be easy
Even in college you had to take fifty rejections for every score, remember
Yeah, but it didn't sting so much when  was drunk
Fred perks up
That's it
We should be drinking
You're right
We're too stiff
Way too stiff
We gotta start pounding 'em, get those creative juices flowing, bring the soul to the surface
Rick smiles
64
That's when we're at our most charming
: - Fred is       as he at a table full of

You say no to me
He's being restrained by an unusually patient
In the b

The women glare at Fred with disgust, maybe even a little amusement
No, screw them
(pointing at the women) You think your shit don't stink
Well  got news for ya:  wouldn't titty-bang you in a snow storm
20- (mocking), Oh, please, sir, please titty-bang us in a snow storm
The women
Nope, you blew it, not gonna happen
(still restraining Fred) There you go, mister, you got 'em good
Now let's go
As the Bouncer drags him toward the exit, a passes them     with an Fred turns to her

(') If we're gonna break out of this slump, we've got to start using our strength
And that is
people who know us, like us
So we should go after the women we've already won over
You mean like our wives
Yeah, like that, but not them
Fred sits in the chair across from Rick
(') was thinking Coffee Girl
You've won over Coffee Girl
Well, 'm sure she'd recognize me
Rick thinks about this
Look, if you really want to go after someone you already know, have you considered Missy Frankenfield
66
Fred's listening
(') She's got all the stats you like-- she's beautiful, you k now her phone n ow- number, she's freshly divorced
Which according to Hog-head means she's horny
Bingo
As Fred smiles, we : - Maggie and Grace are laying outintheir bathing suits when they hear

Helets go of the rope and skis
What's up, beach bunnies
Grace and Maggie sit up and smile
What are you doing here
He    , then runs over and & Gerry, stop it
Hey, where are the kiddies
We thought we'd take you all for a boat ride
My parents took them to Martha's Vineyard for the weekend
Just then, we hear a
They look up to see the boat pulling close to shore
Rick Coleman is behind the wheel and a couple  are in the back
Maggie waves
( ) All right, everybody aboard
We're going waterskiing
The two women look at each other--why not
As they get up and    , we : 67
- Rick stands in line at the coffee shop looking casual in slacks and a Harvard t-shirt
Music plays
He peers ahead and sees the Wannabe Artist-Type taking the order of a At the other register, Coffee Girl is also taking orders
Rick is hoping to get Coffee Girl but Wannabe gets to him first
Can  take your order
Rick sees that there's no one behind him
He turns to the Wannabe
Uh
don't know what  want
Wannabe stares at him, waiting
Rick hesitates a few moments, then levels with the guy
(') Look, man,  want her to take my order
Why
Uh, she knows how  like it
() Little help, Leigh--your unique barista skills have been requested
Rick waves weakly to Leigh and winks
As Leigh approaches, Wannabe mocks Rick by waving at him and winking
Hi
What would you like
Rick was hoping to have a conversation but Wannabe is crowding them
Iced coffee
With two Splendas
Leigh rings him up
That'll be two dollars
Rick hands her a fiver and nods toward the speakers
By the way, nice tunes
Do you choose 'em or do they come down from corporate
Me
It's Snow Patrol
68
She hands Rick his change and he dumps it in the tip jar
Nice soundtrack
Pretty solid movie, too
Wannabe  out a
Dude, you're thinking of Snow Do s-- the Cuba Gooding kiddie flick
This is Snow Patrol, the band
Rick shrugs, a little embarrassed
Thanks for the tip
As Leigh grabs a cup and goes to make the coffee, Wannabe to her that  '  and they both
in the employee room
Leigh hands Wannabe the coffee, then runs back to answer it
Wannabe hands Rick the iced coffee and winks at him
Enjoy your two-Splenda'd iced coffee, mister
Rick starts to go, then turns around and stares at Wannabe
Wannabe, comforted by the counter between them, smiles back
Why are you smiling
You think this counter is some alligator-infested moat
Rick's stare becomes a glare and Wannabe loses his smile
(') This little ''m-on-the-inside, too- cool-for-school, let's-laugh-at-the- ----'-- -----' routine's gonna get you hurt
After you lose all of your family's money on your avante garde piece of crap short film, you're going to need a job
And it's guys like me that hire
And guys like me don't hire punks like you
So shape up
As Rick turns and walks out, we  over to see that Leigh - Rick sits alone at a table on the sidewalk drinking his coffee
He  some postcards advertising a two-week free trial at the local gym and starts to read them
(
) work-out there
69
Rick looks up, suddenly finding himself alone with Leigh
You do
Leigh nods and starts to straighten up the tables
(') work-out at home, but  was thinking of going public with my work-outs
What do you squat
She seems amused by this
don't really squat, just run on the hamster-wheel everyday after work
She starts wiping down a table
So did you go to Harvard
She nods at Rick's t-shirt
Yeah
() mean, you know
went to a party there once
Coffee Girl  and Rick perks up
(') (:) Actually, this is Harvard Health Care
Sleep apnea
snoring too much
(holds up gym postcard) So is this a good place to join
Great place
Real chill
And they have a bar, so  always grab a beer after my workout
Bitchin'
Sounds like a nice routine
Maybe 'll routine it, too
If you join, tell 'em Leigh sent you--they'll give me two free months
'll do that, Leigh
Rockin'
Leigh gives him the peace sign

Several  later: (

Sorry  missed your call
'm out of town for a few days, and  may have limited cell reception
Please leave a message and 'll get back to you as soon as  can
Fred mouths the word 'shit', then picks up the receiver
Hey, Missy, this is Fred Searing
uh,  dust wanted to give you a ring and, um
well, give me a call when you get back
It's kind of an emergency
Well, not life- threatening, but-- The machine
Fred  , dejected
He sits there for a , then grabs his keys and

She is accompanied by her 7-year-old daughter and neither of them look happy to see him
Oh, hi
Kimmy nods blankly
The Daughter glares at him
Fred nervously steps up next to them in line, passing time as he waits for the sidewalk to clear
(') Um,  don't think  got a chance to tell you how impressed  was with your new place
Absolutely elegant

Kimmy  a thank you and turns away from him
the   who owns the dry cleaners
She stands behind the desk with an accordion wall behind her
Mr
Searing, you pick up last week-- no more clothes here
Fred smiles uncomfortably at Kimmy
That's right
(looks at watch) Well, gotta get going-- have a meeting across town in ten minutes
See ya
Fred
- Fred comes out of the dry cleaners, makes sure the coast is clear, then
- is behind the counter
You want massage
Fred looks around
There's an    sitting on a couch
He looks at the Young Korean Woman and nods
(') You fill out
The Young Korean Woman hands Fred a form
Fred puts it down and covertly moves in
'd prefer no paper trail
Need for insurance company
don't think my insurance company's gonna cover this one
Ten dollar co-pay
Uh, no
Fill out form
It policy
Fred moves in closer
72
Look,  don't really want this in print
The Young Korean Woman hands him back the form
How  know what you want if you no fill out form
Um, couldn't  just tell you
She stares at him for a
So, what you waiting for
Fred glances back at the Old Korean Lady, then  in the Young Korean Woman's ear
She nods and looks at him
(') Okay
but must see
first
Fred  and pulls out a hundred-dollar bill
How about a -note so  don't have to fill out any forms or show any 's
The Young Korean Woman thinks about this for a moment, then behind her,
- the Dry Cleaning Korean Lady looks back at him, along with Kimmy Long, her daughter, and Gentleman want a rub-and-tug with tea-bag happy ending but don't fill out form
Kimmy Long glares at him, appalled
As Fred backpedals , he waves at her weakly, and we

The crowd soon    around the two couples, and as Rick and Gerry    our delighted and breathless wives, we : - Maggie and Rick Coleman are standing at the rail of the boat taking a breather
Wow
You can really move out there
Maggie shrugs modestly
Thanks
was a dance major in college
Really
always wondered--what do you do with a degree in dance
Well, as it turned out, nothing
() guess the original plan was to go to New York and try to hook-up with one of the big dance companies, but then  got married and
your priorities change
She looks away, maybe a little embarrassed
(') Anyway, that was fun
haven't danced this much in a long time
Why not
don't know, you get busy, kids, school, there's so much going on
Well you gotta make time for the stuff you love or you'll forget who you are
Maggie appreciates the sentiment
She makes strong eye- contact with Rick for a moment, but catches herself and looks away
You know, my husband's name is Rick
Rick smiles at this
74
Well that makes me the perfect guy to have an affair with--you'd never have to worry about screaming out the wrong name during sex
Maggie smiles at this, but she seems a nick uncomfortable
(') 'm kidding
know
Now come on, let's go find Grace and get something to eat
'm starving
As they head back to the party, we : '   - Rick is parked across the street from He's reading the newspaper and glancing at the entrance for Leigh
Suddenly there's a   on the window and Rick looks over to see Flats (who we met at Rick's poker night) standing outside with a shit-eating grin
Rick rolls down the window
Hey, Rick
() Oh
hey, Flats
How you doing, man
Great
What's up with you
How's that hall pass thing going
Rick makes a Scooby Doo sound, alarmed
Who told you about that--was it Hog- head
No
Some old lady was yakking about it down at the post office
Rick  to this
(') ( ) So what's the deal--you getting laid
() What
No
75
(') don't know where you're getting your information, Flats, but a hall pass isn't just about getting laid, it's about getting a week off from marriage to do as you please-- whether that be fishing, or watching , whatever it is that relaxes you
() Oh,  didn't know that
Just then Rick  Leigh (dressed in work-out clothes) walking down the sidewalk toward the gym
Uh, Flatsy,  gotta run
'm late for my work-out appointment
When Rick hops out of his car, we see that he's wearing gym shorts and an old Springsteen t-shirt
He hesitates, then grabs a  out of the car and Rick hurries down the sidewalk toward Leigh
(') Hey, girl
() All right
You decided to go for it
As Rick follows Leigh into the gym, a smiling Flats : Hey, Rick
Good luck with the fishing
As Flats begins to , a sheepish Rick scurries into the building
- Rick and Leigh stand at the front desk
young, buff dude, , looks up from folding towels
Clyde, this is my friend, uh
Rick
He's looking to join
Great
'll get you signed up
Leigh pats Rick's hand
See ya
76
She turns to leave
So, uh, are you gonna grab a brewski after your work-out
Nah
Rick looks disappointed
(') 'm gonna grab two
Leigh flashes him a smile and as she walks away, she gives him the peace sign
He returns it
Peace it
As soon as he hears himself, Rick cringes

Then the Metrosexual starts to
As Rick dries his hands, he can't contain himself
What's that about--you swimming the English Channel
The Metrosexual shoots Rick an annoyed look
Nah, Just not into looking like the knuckle-dragging guy on the evolution-of-man chart
Off Rick looking self-consciously down at his fur-covered body, we go

Just as Rick starts to go under, the two young naked metrosexuals hear his  and come to his rescue
They jump in the hot tub and heave him ashore
As Rick  for air, one of the metrosexuals kneels down and lifts Rick's head onto his

() No, no,  think  was

All right, don't give up
'm not giving up, 'm facing facts- -this is our last day and we got nothing cooking
Maybe you were right
Maybe we should just tell the girls to come home
79
No
want the hall pass
Fred looks at Rick, surprised
(') At first  wasn't sure, but now want the dream
'm not even sure  know what the dream is anymore
just
just want to know what it's like to be with another woman
Well, just pull up one of the golden oldies in your spank bank-- it's almost like being there
don't have anything in that spank bank
'm talking about all the girls before you met Maggie
Rick doesn't say anything
(') What
() No, you're not serious
Rick lowers his head
(') Wait a second, are you saying
() But how can that be--you didn't meet Maggie until college
() Yeah, so
What do you think, everyone gets laid in high school
got news for you, mister--getting laid in high school is not a right, it's a privilege
Fred puts down his ice cream
Rick
(') First class, first day, freshman year,  saw Maggie--she was sitting three seats away in Western Civ-- and  fell in love instantly begged her for three months to go out with me, she finally caved, and that night  told her  loved her
80
(') Eighty-four days later she told me she loved me back and we've been together ever since
Fred stares at him
Wow
That's a really creepy story
Just then Fred's cell phone  and he  it
(') Hello
() Yeah
() Oh, okay, great
Fred hangs up but doesn't say anything
Who was that
Just an angel from heaven
Suddenly Fred jumps to his feet
(') Coakley's back in town
As Rick's face fills with renewed hope, we
: - Maggie and Grace are sitting at the kitchen table gazing at a and an open   displaying an Does this mean you're going steady
() That's not funny
feel terrible-- the poor kid's spending all his hard-earned money on me--that's sad
Cute, but sad
Grace, you should be flattered
You're thirty-eight-years-old and college kids are still swooning over you
Well  just feel bad if  gave him the wrong impression
81
The wrong impression
What makes you think that-- mean, besides the flowers,
bracelet, and love letter
Maggie picks up a card
(') () 'Dearest Grace--Our final game is tonight
Please meet me at the coach's place afterwards to celebrate
Yours truly, Gerry
' Thanks for piling on
Grace stands up and
(') Well
can't accept this
guess 'm just gonna have to go set him straight
: - - Rick and Fred are sitting at a table sharing a pizza while Fred texts someone
What are you doing
Just texting Missy Frankenfield that we're going to be at Enter the Dragon--'m covering all my bases
You don't need Missy Frankenfield tonight
If we can't get the job done with Coakley as our wingman, then we're pathetic
Just then, Fred  something
All right, here come da man
- a suave,   (played by George Clooney) comes through the doors and stops to check out the room
Rick and Fred jump up and approach him    but at the last second Clooney steps aside  a , dressed --    (think Larry David
) & Coakley
82
My two favorite nutsuckers--how the hell are ya
The three men hug, then Coakley nods toward Clooney
') See who just walke ( in here in front of me
No, who
George Clooney
What's he doing here
don't know--must be shooting a movie or something
Huh
Look, man, we've got a situation on our hands
Yeah, yeah, Baker filled me in
'been rough sledding, huh
Coakley puts his arms around the two guys
(') Well, don't worry, my little snickerdicks
Coakley's here
: - mass of   and   vie for position outside this
Rick, Fred and Coakley watching from across the street
'm gonna need three-hundred bucks
For what
Coakley shoots him a look
If you're really serious about this, stop questioning me
The guys look at each other, then reluctantly With money in hand, Coakley marches confidently across the street followed by Fred and Rick
When the sees them approaching, he
83
Good evening, Mr
Coakley
What up, my guy
Coakley     with a handshake and the Bouncer Then Coakley smiles back at Fred and Rick
(') Push the defrost button on the microwave, boys
The deep freeze is over
- Coakley leads them into the club
Rick and Fred can't believe all the   around them
Okay, guys, you tried it your way and you railed miserably
You struck out, you were oh-for- everything
So now we do it my way, which is
The guys look at Coakley like Richard Gere looks at the Dalai Lama
(') Go ugly early
Rick and Fred are visibly deflated
(') Guys, you're not trying to get married here--you're trying to get laid
Aren't you the guy who goes to the Hawaiian Tropic finals every year
Is that for the ugly girls
go to the Tropic finals because Miss North Dakota's gonna lose and she's gonna need a hug
And quite often you can parlay a hug into a hand-job
Rick, you're up--get us two bottles of Moet and six glasses
Rick shoots Fred a look, then weaves his way through a scrum of  up to the bar
He tries to flag down a bartender but can't get anyone's attention
(
) Hi, Mr
Mills
Rick turns to see that he's crammed in beside his babysitter Paige who's looking a
84
Oh, hey, Paige
What are you doing here
She pulls out her license and holds it up
turned twenty-one yesterday
( ) 'm legal now
Oh
Well, happy birthday
You out celebrating
Yeah, 'm here with my Aunt Meg
Paige points across the club to  , a striking redhead, early 40's, who's talking to a couple of
(') She's the best
Forty-two years old but she still parties like she's my age
Nice
Rick continues to try to get the bartender's attention
So, Rick, how's the hall pass going
Paige smirks at Rick who shrinks a little
(') You don't mind if  call you Rick, do you
am officially an adult now
No, of course not--what did you just say
was asking about your hall pass
(off Rick's look) baby-sit for the Putneys and heard Gary talking about it the other night at their barbecue
Rick  to this
He was talking about it at a barbecue
Oh, he wasn't saying it in a bad way
85 (') In fact,  thought it was very classy of you to be staying at the Holiday Inn Express instead of bringing girls back to your home with all the kids' pictures and schoolwork taped up everywhere
Rick forces a smile
Thank you
male , 25, finally appears in front of Rick
(') Yeah, um, two bottles of Moet and six glasses please
Paige eyes Rick as she sips her drink
So does it work both ways
What
The hall pass
Does your wife get one, too
() Uh, no, no
hall pass is for men only
Oh
Who made that rule
Well
um
As Rick thinks about this, Paige moves in tighter
By the way,  kind of owe you an apology
(lowers her voice, Last week ful) when you drove me home, shouldn't have snapped at you like that
Oh, don't worry about it
It was a big misunderstanding
No, it wasn't
She takes a moment, looks around
86
(') If you thought  was coming on to you that night, it's because was
Rick flinches at this
Just then the Bartender returns with the champagne
Rick fumbles through his pocket and finally pays
Then he's left alone with Paige and her coed-in-love- with-the-professor eyes and her suddenly heaving cleavage
Yeah
Um
have to go, Paige, but it was great seeing you
Paige grabs Rick's arm as he tries to go
She looks suddenly annoyed
Are you serious
You're doing this again
even with a hall pass
Paige, you're my kids' babysitter
Have a happy birthday
As Rick walks away, we go as Rick arrives with the champagne
Here we go, bubbles doth floweth
Holy crap
look who's here
The guys turn to see the coffee girl, Leigh, walking past with two of her
She sees them and
Hey, Rick
What happened yesterday-- thought we were gonna grab a beer
Fred looks at Rick, confused
() Yeah,  got a little caught up in my curls and reps and shit
( ) So is this your playground
Nah, 've never been here, but a friend of mine's -ing tonight so promised him 'd come
Just then Wannabe from the coffee shop swoo s in and gives Leigh a kiss on the cheek
He has a pair of headphones hanging around his neck
Wassup, girl
87
Wannabe  Rick and loses his smile
(') Oh
Hey
What are you doing here-- you auditing the place
Actually,  work for Sirius Radio--we're looking to hire some new deejays so 'm checking out all the clubs
Wannabe stiffens, suddenly respectful
Oh
Cool
Are you serious
Not
Leigh is amused by this, but she tries to hide it from the deflated Wannabe
() Oh, that's hip
Real fresh
(turns to Leigh) Why don't you hit the dance floor-- the next song's gonna be for you
As Leigh's Girlfriends pull her onto the dance floor, Wannabe returns to his deejay booth
() Beer
When were you two going to have a beer
() No, no, no, Leigh and  just belong to the same gym and happened to be there at the same time yesterday afternoon
What gym do you belong to and where the hell was
Well, according to Kimmy Long, you were at the massage parlor trying to get a rub-and-tug without filling out the paperwork
This takes the wind out of Fred's sails
What
Coakley  and Rick glares at Fred
88
(') thought the massage parlor was admitting defeat
had a knot in my neck--why the hell didn't you tell me you saw Coffee Girl
Okay, guys, cut the crap
We're all here for the same thing
And 'll give you a hint what that thing is: It begins with a '' and ends with an 'ussy
' Coakley puts his arm around Fred
(') Now relax, Fredd , everyone's gonna get taken care ot
(looks out at crowd) We Just gotta find you a gazelle with a bad wheel
Huh
Coakley spots something
Ooh--there's a couple of trainwrecks
Let's go
() Whoa--wait a second
But Coakley steers Fred over to two , -- laying on a 'bed' in the corner
Ladies, this is my friend Fred Pinkberry--his yogurt company just went public and he's out celebrating
He'd like to offer you a flute of champagne
The Chubby Blondes
#1 love Pinkberry
As the girls make room for a reluctant Fred, we go
where we see Rick watching Leigh and her hot girlfriends
Leigh catches Rick staring
He smiles and clumsily shoots her the
Finally, he takes a deep breath and
So
having a good time

Chillin'
Me too
Just chillin' and wigglin'
as they dance
Then: (') haven't been ancing in a long time

Oh yeah
Just try to keep up
She smiles at this, then Coakley     and Abort
Abort
You stand not a chance
No, no,  think we're starting to gel
Coakley rolls his eyes
No, no, you're mistaken
Look, dude, this ain't Operation Cock- block here--now trust me, retreat
Rick glances back at Leigh, torn
She looks fantastic
Coak, 'm never gonna have another hall pass, so this memory has to last a lifetime
you know what mean
Coakley looks at Leigh and
All right, 'll be at the bar when this thing blows up in your face
As Rick dances back over to Leigh, we
to the - Wannabe watching them from the deejay booth
( ) All right, 'all, adult-swim's over
Now if you was born before 1980 you're gonna want to step off the floor 'cause we're about to kick it up
90
- he looks over at Wannabe but
Is this guy your boyfriend or something
No, no, no
She waves it off, then shrugs guiltily
(') One time we messed around a little
And what does 'messed around a little' mean these days
Anal
Rick tries hard to act nonchalant
(') 'm kidding
He kissed me one night and  kissed back-- shouldn't have
(
) Seriously, you grandpappies better get off the floor before someone falls and breaks a hip
Rick points at Wannabe
( ) Just play your funky music, white boy
As the music shifts gears and becomes  and , we : - Maggie's at the sink cleaning up when she  that the She dries her hands, then pushes the button

) (on answering machine) Hola, Maggie, this is Isabel went to clean the house today but nobody has been there or slept in any of the beds this week, so just cleaned the windows and left early
hope you don't mind
a concerned-looking Maggie
She moves to the window, stares at the lights on the ocean
91
(
) Hey
Maggie turns to see Rick Coleman standing out on her front porch
Oh
Hey
She goes to the screen door
Thought you might want to help me celebrate the end of the season
He holds up a grocery bag
(') got some good late-night eats
Maggie hesitates a moment
Then she opens the door and lets him in
: - bored-looking Fred is smooshed between the Chubby Blondes on the bed
#1 It was the greys--you know, the tall, skinny aliens--and they were all over my yard, but--and here's the weird thing-- wasn't at all afraid of them so when they asked me if  wanted to get in their spaceship,  said, 'Sure,' and walked right on
#2 Oh my God, you're so brave
would never, ever in a million years climb into one of those things
Fred, would you ever just walk into a  on your own
() If they came right now  would, sure
(
) There you are
Fred looks up to see Missy Frankenfield approaching
Oh my god
You're here
Fred jumps off the bed and gives Missy a hug
92 (') Franken-berry, how the heck are ya
She returns the embrace, but not quite as tight
(') You look incredible
( ) Thanks, Fred, you look good, too
Never felt better
Missy nods
have to say,  can't believe 'm actually here-- was on my way home from dinner when  noticed your text
So what's this big emergency
Huh
Oh, uh, yeah
By 'emergency' just meant that there's some important stuff  want to talk to you about
You know, one on one, me and you--without all the husbands and wives and hoopla
So how are you
'm
good
No,  mean how-are-you
Inside
What's happenin' in there
There must be all sorts of emotions churning up with the divorce and everything
She gives him a long look
Maybe we should go somewhere else-- this doesn't seem like the best place to spill one's guts
Just then, Coakley swoops in and pulls Fred aside
( ) What part of 'go ugly early' didn't you understand
You've got a better chance of winning husband-of-the- year than tagging that chiquita
Fred flinches at this
But
know her
She said she wants to leave with me
93
Then she's insane--run for the hills
Coak, the woman's going through a divorce
She's not insane, she's just making really poor decisions right now
(hands him his car keys) Here, give Rick the keys to my mini- van
'm gonna go back to the hotel with Missy
Coakley looks back at Missy and softens
It's your funeral, princess
dancing up a storm
Rick is and
His shirt is soaked and his hair is dripping wet
Are you okay--you keep checking your pulse
Nah, 'm fine
had a little chest cramp during the last song, but worked through it
She smiles at this
Come on, let's sit this one out need a breather
They move to the bar and Rick starts   with a stack of cocktail napkins
(') So what's up with the ring
He looks at his finger, then back at her
Um
have you ever heard of a hall pass
: - Grace pulls up in her Camry and gets out
She hears coming from inside and hesitates a  before walking nervously onto the porch and
moment later Gerry appears in the doorway
There she is
Come on in, 'm mixing up some margaronis
We lost our final game, but  got four hits
94
Oh
Great
Uh, where is everyone
They all went out to party--now get in here
But Grace stays on the porch
Gerry, 'm sorry but  can't stay
What
Grace hasn't been in this situation in a long time and it shows
Gerry steps out onto the porch looking concerned
(') Is everything okay
Yeah, yeah, everything's fine, but
(holds up gift box) can't accept this
Why not
Grace does a double-take
Gerry, 'm a married woman
Gerry nods at this, maybe a little hurt
She hands him the box and he reluctantly accepts it
Um
'm sorry if  made you uncomfortable, Grace
It's just that
really like you
like you, too, Gerry, and you didn't make me uncomfortable
She smiles at him and he forces a smile back, and there's some serious eye-contact, and then
They     and start    ' As they continue to   , they , and we : - Rick and Leigh are leaning against the bar
So
you're married
95 wasn't deliberately hiding it
He holds up his ring hand
Yeah,  just thought your wife had died or something and you were wearing it out of respect
() Uh, nope
She's still hangin' in there
Just then, Coakley
Come on, you're not gonna close the sale here--let's move this clambake back to my place
Okay, but what am  gonna do there
What do you mean, what are you gonna do
've got a house with bedrooms--do the math
When it doesn't work out with her--which it won't--there's going to be a bunch of other back-up chicks there
Rick nods then turns to Leigh
My buddy's inviting everybody back to his crib
Sounds cool
As they walk toward the exit, we : - - Fred and Missy are walking down the hallway toward his room
've got to be honest, Fred
'm not really sure what we're doing here
What do you mean
We're hangin', we're connecting--that's what friends do
Especially if they want to take it to the next level where they can call each other 'good friends
' 96
He comes to his room and starts to unlock the door
You're married, Fred
Ah, blah, blah, blah, blah
Fred opens the door but Missy stays in the hall
What does blah-blah mean
You are still married, right
Happily
Look,  don't want to get into all the details, but my wife gave me this one-time deal where get to be with another woman
He opens the door wide
She looks at him for a
thought we were going to the hotel bar
We are
There's a mini-bar in my room
You better hurry up, it's last call
Fred smiles
Are you out of your flippin' mind
Fred loses the smile
Um
Are you out of your mind
'm going to be honest with you-- your tone right now is scaring me
You call me up for the first time in your life, claim you have some kind of emergency, and it turns out that you just want to screw me
Or not
Well, screw you, Fred
She starts walking down the hallway
Fred nods, unfazed
97
Nail on the head
She turns and glares at him
What
What you just said-- had that coming
Big time
Fred hangs his head
(') () Seriously, Missy,
don't know what's gotten into me this week think  must be having some kind of mid-life crisis or something because 've been acting like a real jackass
( Anyway ease forgive me really am very, very sorry and ashamed
Missy, standing a few feet away, finally calms down
Okay
Whatever
Thank you
(') So
you want to come in for that drink
He arches an eyebrow
Fuck you, Fred
Missy  away
(  ) 'No thank you' would have sufficed
Fred walks into his room and closes the door
& '   - Fred goes to the mini-bar and pours himself a drink
He looks around the room
The week's over and he's failed miserably
He sits on the bed
Alone
Then a
Fred gets up and opens the door
98
Hi
May  help you
Paige's Aunt Meg
She's wearing a skirt and low-cut tank top and has cougar written all over her
Rick, my name's Meg
'm your babysitter Paige's aunt, and  just wanted to come over here and tell you this: They don't make men like you anymore
She smiles
Oh
Well, thank you
() Would you like to come in
: -  - guilt-ridden Grace is just finishing   when Gerry comes out of the bathroom buttoning up his shirt
Everything okay
Yeah
Yeah
It's just
no, everything's not okay
What
He moves close to her and she grows uncomfortable
Look, you're a great cguy, Gerry, and you're very charming and very sweet and the last thing  wanted to do was hurt your feelings, but
well, what,just happened can never happen again
Gerry looks confused
Oh
know it's probably hard for you to understand but
love my husband
So
What does that have to do with anything
Fate threw us together and we went with it--isn't that what life's all about
99
Grace looks at him, recognizing the youth and triteness of his words
Not always
() It wasn't fair to my husband
and it wasn't fair to you because this could never become anything more than just
what it was
She looks at him and shrugs apologetically
Gerry  out a
know that
You do
( ) Of course  do
Jeez
mean, no offense, but let's face it, you're a lot older than me
She flinches, a little embarrassed
quick reality check for Grace
Right
don't mean that in a bad way
'm just saying,  didn't think we were going to start dating, you know
Could you imagine the looks we'd get
It'd be like Hugh Hefner and his girlfriends--except in reverse
Gerry
(') You'd be Hugh Hefner
Yeah,  got that part
Gerry looks at his watch
Ooh,  gotta get going
We have kind of a team meeting in like twenty minutes
Gerry sees Grace glance at the clock: 12:15
' It's, uh, kind o a tradition that we always get together on the night of the last game
It would probably be uncool if  missed it
100
You don't have to explain
Seriously, though, thanks for everything--that was awesome
He holds up his hand and she diligently -
Then Gerry
Grace sits there alone for a moment
We     and we hear Gerry's , and when Grace   , we : '  - This is a Tudor home in an upscale Brookline neighborhood
We can hear 'Rage Against The Machine'  from the street
There's thirty or so cars out front and  are still arriving
'  - The place is
It's a nice house but under-furnished in a bachelor pad kind of way
Rick and Leigh are in a corner drinking beers
guess  still have a lot to get out of my system before  do the marriage trip
'm one of those people who wants to try everything once before  die
( ) Have you ever been with a married guy
Leigh pauses, but she doesn't flinch
No
Neither have
Rick winces, but Leigh smiles at him
It's the moment of truth
(') 'd like to help you take being with a married guy off your list of things to do before you die
You would
Yes
Leigh gets close
101
don't want to be a home-wrecker
've got a one-time pass, remember
That wasn't just a line
No
It's for real
Leigh seems intrigued
She moves closer still, takes his hand
So where can we go to talk some more about this
() Um, Coakley has a game room upstairs
We could
talk there
(
) Leigh
Rick and Leigh look over to see an  Wannabe forcing his way through the crowd
(') Where have you
Why didn't you
You knew this was my big night
How could you just--
(turns away, emotional) Look, can  please talk to you in private
Now
Leigh looks apologetically at Rick
Can you give me a second
Sure
Wannabe and Leigh walk a few feet away and Rick watches them have an
It appears Wannabe may even be crying
Finally, Wannabe storms across the room but when he gets to the door, he looks back at Leigh
Well
Are you coming
Leigh , then approaches Rick
'm sorry, Rick
have to go deal with this
Rick can't believe what's happening
102
Really
Now
thought you said he wasn't your boyfriend
He's not
but he is a friend
Leigh glances at the broken-down Wannabe standing there at the door, then turns back to Rick
(') 'm sorry
Before Rick can stop her, Leigh    with Wannabe
After a  , Rick slides down into a chair, : -  - Maggie is spilling her guts to Rick Coleman as he stands over the stove
And he hasn't even spent one night in his own bed this week
Let me get this straight--you gave him his freedom and now you're mad that he's acting free
This logic clearly stings Maggie
(') Hey, 'm sure there's an explanation
Maybe he took a trip somewhere
called his assistant--he's been in the office almost everyday
Look, Maggie, for all you know your husband's been working at a sou kitchen, sleeping in his car al week, and he's only gotten laid two or three times at most
She looks up and forces a smile
Ha-ha
Maggie checks her watch
(') Jeez,  wonder what's taking Grace so long
103
Well, if she went over to break the kid's heart, the least she could do is lend a sympathetic ear
He flips a pancake onto a plate
(') Prepare yourself for heaven
She reaches for the plate, but he slaps her hand away
(') Not so fast, lady
'm not finished
You have not lived until you've had my steaming hot blueberry pancakes
He pulls a carton of vanilla ice cream out of a bag
(') la mode
Maggie smiles
Oh My-lanta
And to wash it all down
Rick reaches into the bag and pulls out a
Off Maggie's smile, we : '  - glum Rick is walking through the   when he bumps into Baker and Hog-Head standing around a keg with a Hey
what are you guys doing here
- We're here for the hall pass
Really
thought you guys had given up on us
We did
We're here with them
He nods toward   and  , both early 40's and paunchy
What are you talking about
104
When Leary and Boshane heard about your guy's hall pass, they convinced their wives to give them one, too
smiling Leary tries to - Rick, but he's having none of it
He turns to Baker, livid
You weren't supposed to tell anyone about the hall pass
They didn't say anything
Our wives heard about it at the pool
No
At the pool
Rick rubs his face, distressed
Yep
And then about three days ago-- after some hard-core negotiating-- we managed to push the bill through
The guys
Rick can hardly believe what he's spawned
Really
So
how's it going
Solid
Very solid
We're building mucho momentumo
Baker makes a -
(') () Hey, Baker, a hall pass ain't just about sex, you know
That's right
It's about going bowling and, uh, staying up late, and being able to do what you want to do when you want to do it
Haven't gotten laid yet, huh
() It's a lot tougher than we thought it would be
Just then Gary comes around a corner
105
Hey, dudes, there's like ten very bangable chicks out on the back deck--let's go
Leary
To freedom
The guys  their beer cups, then  toward the back deck
dejected and defeated Rick watches them go, then turns and pushes his way through the crowd to the front door
As he to leave, he finds himself -- Hey, where are you going
What are you doing
thought you'd left
No
told you,  just had to talk him off the ledge
calmed him down and sent him on his way
Oh
Uh, great
So where's that game room thought we were gonna play some games
She smiles and takes his hand and as they walk away, we go
'  -   - Rick and Leigh walk down the hall to the game room
He opens the door and flips on the light
- there's a pool table, a few pinball machines, a bar, and a bed
'll be right back-- just have to use the bathroom
Rick nods, then watches as Leigh walks off and disappears into the bathroom
He takes a
This is it
Just then he hears
Rick heads down the hallway and pushes open a door
(
) Hey
reveals Coakley    in a small study off the hall
He has a bowl of Cap'n Crunch on his lap and is watching a re-run of The Andy Griffith Show
106
Hey
How come you're not downstairs partying
Coakley gives him a sad, worn-out smile
All partied out, pal
Rick nods, understanding
Coakley  once again at the (') Man, that Barney Fife still kills me
He looks back to Rick
(') Hey,  was thinking about this hall- pass business
It's really ironic, isn't it
Rick glances down the hall to see if Leigh has returned
How's that
Well think about it
There's two kinds of guys who cheat on their wives: The guy who does it behind her back, and a guy like you who has his wife's permission
Well it's not really cheating if have permission
Yeah, whatever
The point is, if you asked a hundred people who the better CJuy is, ninety-nine of 'em would pick you, because you're being honest--there's no deceit involved
Rick is growing uncomfortable
(') But the funny thing is, the other guy, the cheater, the bad guy, he has to live with all that guilt and anxiety, while his wife's running around happy as a clam because she doesn't know anything
And you, the good guy, you've got no guilt at all because you just laid it all on your wife's shoulders
Well  didn't really think of it -- 107
It's like she's your guilt Sherpa
Coakley  and Rick deflates
(') Funny, huh
() Yeah
And that, my friend, is why you are a genius
As Rick lets this all sink in, we : & '   - Paige's Aunt Meg is sitting on the couch
Her legs are crossed revealing a lot of skin
Fred hands her a glass of wine and sits beside her
Cheers
They  glasses
Rick,  hope you don't mind me tracking you down--Paige told me where you were staying
Please
Not at all
You've been very sweet to her
Fred waves her off
Hey, she's a good kid
do what can for the kids
Aunt Meg moves in a little closer, squints at him sweetly
She told me everything
And  have to say,  was very impressed
Hm
know she tried to hook-up with you--twice in fact--and that you set her straight both times
Fred hadn't heard this from Rick and is a little confused
108
Uh
hook-up
() Rick, enough with the chivalry
Paige wanted to sleep with you and you didn't take advantage of her
'm just saying that's very cool
He shrugs modestly
Well
she's a kid and kids get crushes
remember in tenth grade had the biggest crush on my French teacher--thank God Mr
LeClaire was professional enough to only date seniors
Meg
'm serious, it takes a certain kind of guy to say no to a beautiful young girl like that-- especially since you have your wi e's permission now
Meg shoots him a knowing smile and puts her glass down
(') like that, Rick
You have morals
She leans in and
Fred glances down at her breasts
Hey, all you have in this world is your word
As Aunt Meg     , we : '  -   - Rick  to find Leigh playing a pinball machine
Leigh turns and smiles at Rick
Leigh,  gotta split
What
() Yeah,  kind of hit a wall
She can hardly believe her ears
109
Really
Are you feeling okay
You're not mad because  went outside with my friend, are you
No, no, no
Look,  shouldn't be doing this
have
you know, commitments
Leigh nods at this, then unties a shoulder strap and her Suddenly she's  before him and she's
(') () Um, you dropped something
For a moment nobody moves
We can almost hear Rick's heart beat
Then Leigh   to him and Rick instinctively leans back
Relax
Don't think so much
You're gonna have your wife for the rest of your life, but tonight
you have me
Leigh smiles
And it's the kind of smile you only get two or three times in your life, if you're lucky, and probably never from a woman this beautiful
She reaches down and   , then she They stand face-to-face now, the middle-aged guy and the young beauty, and it's happening exactly the way Rick had hoped it would, the dream
She presses her body against his and     , her hand
Then she leans her head
As he looks down at her, we   on a suddenly conflicted Rick
Nope
can't do this
He reaches for his shirt
What are you doing
'm sorry
She stares at him, confused, as he buckles his pants
Your wife didn't give you a hallway permission slip, did she
110
Yes, she did, but
look, you're insanely beautiful and pathologically sexy and every cell in my body is telling me to dust do this, but-- Rick points to his chest
(') See this area, this spot right here
The first time Maggie and slept together, back in college, she fell asleep right here
And she left a puddle of drool
And it didn't bother me
It actually felt good
That's when  knew  was going to marry her
() And when my kids--Emma and Gunnar-- when they were babies, this is where they slept
Or sometimes at four o'clock in the morning Emma would just lay there and stare up at me
It was where we first got to know each other
() So 'm sorry, Leigh, but as amazing as  think you are
gotta go home
Rick shrugs apologetically
Well,  think you have a screw loose and you're probably going to regret this for the rest of your life, but
right on, man
Um
do you want me to give you a ride home
No
It's only one-thirty--'m going back down to the party
Rick raises two fingers
Peace it
--- in the --
As they smile at each other one last time, we : '  - Rick is pulling away from Coakley's house when the car phone Rick pushes a button to
Hello

) ( ) Yes, is this Fred Searing
Oh, uh, no, 'm sorry, he's not here right now
'm using his car
'  (

) ( ) Well, would you know where  could find him
This is Sgt
Polisner of the Massachusetts State Police
As Rick grows alarmed, we : & '   - Fred is still on the couch with Aunt Meg on the floor in front of him
Fred's      , leaving him with only his boxers on
Meg    and , then leans back and    -, revealing -  stuffed into a slinky bra

Thanks--wow, you got great jugs
Meg takes Fred's hand and leads him toward the bed (with his pants still at his ankles), Fred
Moral-guy's a tit-man, huh
() Well,  grew up in the midwest
She pushes him down on the bed and Fred quickly kicks off his pants and shoes (but keeps his boxers on
) Meg  him and the two of them start to roll around
An
Fred seems to be working his way down her stomach
Oh yes
Rick
please
want you to make love to me
Just then Rick    , out of breath
Fred and Meg come up from under the covers
(Fred is at waist-level on her
) Fred,  need to talk to you
Meg  down at Fred, confused
112
Fred
thought you were Rick
'm Rick
Fred cowers guiltily
Please don't judge me
As Aunt Meg   Fred in the face, we : -  - Fred, now dressed, hurries across the parking lot with Rick on his heels
Fred has -  stuffed up his nose
What did they tell you
Is Grace gonna be okay
All  know is she was in a car accident and they rushed her to the hospital
Oh my God
Suddenly they hear
They look up and - From fifty yards across the parking lot, they can see that Fred's mini-van's windshield has just been by the - Wannabe
On the side of the vehicle is spray-painted:
(') Whoa
What the hell
Wannabe turns to them, a   on his face
How do you like me now, Splenda- boy
You moron, that's Lny car
His is the one next to it
Wannabe looks over at Rick's Avalon,    , and quickly    '
As Rick and Fred , Wannabe      and Rick and Fred as they slow down and 113
Nice job, Fred
: - The mini-van blows by a sign that reads '  - 60 ' - - The    and the wind blows back Rick and Fred's hair as if they were on a motorcycle
Fred tries his car phone as he drives
Oh come on
How can a hospital not have a live operator
It's four in the morning, Fred
Fred hangs up and pounds his steering wheel
What was  thinking
had a great wife--a beautiful wife--and now may lose her
because of you
What are you talking about
You said our wives were living their dreams, with their fancy gas ovens, and that our dream was the hall pass
How can you blame this on me
'd never even heard of a hall pass until you flaunted yours in my face
'Hey, look at me, 've got a hall pass--everyone should have a hall pass
' You ruined my life, Mills
: - Maggie and Rick Coleman sit on the back deck
This is a great place
Yeah, my family's had it since was a kid
We used to come for a week a summer, then two weeks, then a month, then by the time  got to high school we were living here all summer long
114
Something's wrong here, Maggie
Hm
Something's wrong with a guy who would leave a woman like you alone for this long
() Well, you know
did give him a hall pass
So what
If you were my girl, wouldn't have taken it
An awkward moment
Rick touches her hand and Maggie looks away
(') You deserve way better
Uh, in Rick's defense, he didn't really even want the hall pass kind of forced it on him
Why would you do that
Maggie thinks about this
don't know
() guess  felt like he wasn't noticing me anymore
j guess wanted to feel
desired again
And the truth is, in my heart,  never thought he'd go through with it
He brushes her hair from her face and they look into each other's eyes
He leans in and she does, too, and right when it looks like   , Maggie hesitates as suddenly (') Oh my God
What
This hall pass
it wasn't for him
() It was
for me
And as they hang on that realization, we : 115 - police cruiser is parked on the highway divider

Cop #2 throws the car into drive and they pull a -ey and - - Fred looks regretful

The day  lost my virginity

She looks at him, not sure if she understands

Grace looks awash in guilt
It's not your fault, Fred
Yes, it is--of course it's my fault
This isn't you--driving around all night, thinking--you're not a thinker
When she looks up at him, he forces a smile
But she doesn't smile back
Look, Fred, we have to talk about
