----------------------------------------------------------- (An ocean
Birds are flying and porpoises are swimming happily
From the fog a ship appears crashing through the waves) Sailors: 'll tell you a tale of the bottomless blue And it's hey to the starboard, heave ho Look out, lad, a mermaid be waitin' for you In mysterious fathoms below
Eric: Isn't this great
The salty sea air, the wind blowing in your face
a perfect day to be at sea
Grimsby: (Leaning over side
) Oh yes
delightful
Sailor 1:  fine strong wind and a following sea
King Triton must be in a friendly-type mood
Eric: King Triton
Sailor 2: Why, ruler of the merpeople, lad
Thought every good sailor knew about him
Grimsby: Merpeople
Eric, pay no attention to this nautical nonsense
Sailor 2: But it ain't nonsense, it's the truth
'm tellin' you, down in the depths o' the ocean they live
(He gestures wildly, Fish in his hand flops away and lands back in the ocean, relieved
) Sailors: Heave
ho
Heave, ho
In mysterious fathoms below
(Fish sighs and swims away
) (Titles
Various fish swimming
Merpeople converge on a great undersea palace, filling concert hall inside
Fanfare ensues
) Seahorse: Ahem
His royal highness, King Triton
(Triton enters dramatically to wild cheering
) And presenting the distinguished court composer, Horatio Thelonious Ignatius Crustaceous Sebastian
(Sebastion enters to mild applause
) Triton: 'm really looking forward to this performance, Sebastian
Sebastian: Oh, Your Majesty, this will be the finest concert  have ever con- ducted
Your daughters - they will be spectacular
Triton: Yes, and especially my little Ariel
Sebastian: Yes, yes, she has the most beautiful voice
[sotto] If only she'd show up for rehearsals once in a while
(He proceeds to podium and begins to direct orchestra
) Triton's daughters: Ah, we are the daughters of Triton
Great father who loves us and named us well: Aquata, Andrina, Arista, Atina, Adella, Allana
And then there is the youngest in her musical debut, Our seventh little sister, we're presenting her to you, To sing a song Sebastian wrote, her voice is like a bell, She's our sister, Ar-i
(Shell opens to reveal that Ariel is absent
) Triton: (Very angry
) Ariel
(Cut to Ariel looking at sunken ship
) Flounder: (From distance
) Ariel, wait for me
Ariel: Flounder, hurry up
Flounder: (Catching up
) You know  can't swim that fast
Ariel: There it is
Isn't it fantastic
Flounder: Yeah
sure
it - it's great
Now let's get outta here
Ariel: You're not getting cold fins now, are you
Flounder: Who, me
No way
It's just, it, err
it looks - damp in there
Yeah
And  think  may be coming down with something
Yeah,  got this cough
(Flounder coughs unconvincingly) Ariel: All right
'm going inside
You can just stay here and - watch for sharks
(She goes inside
) Flounder:
Yeah - you go
'll stay and - what
Sharks
Ariel
(He tries to fit through porthole
) Ariel
can't
mean- Ariel help
Ariel: (Laughs
) Oh, Flounder
Flounder: (Wispering
)Ariel, do you really think there might be sharks around here
(Shark passes outside
) Ariel: Flounder, don't be such a guppy
Flounder: 'm not a guppy
(Gets pulled through porthole
)This is great - mean,  really love this
Excitement, adventure, danger lurking around every corn-
Ariel
(He sees a skull, crashes into pillar causing cave in, and swims frantically away, knocking over Ariel
) Ariel: Oh, are you okay
Flounder: Yeah sure, no problem, 'm okay
Ariel: Shhh
(Seeing a fork
) Oh my gosh
Oh my gosh
Have you ever seen anything so wonderful in your entire life
Flounder: Wow, cool
But, err, what is it
Ariel:  don't know
But  bet Scuttle will
(Puts fork in bag
Skark swims by outside
) Flounder: What was that
Did you hear something
Ariel: (Distracted by pipe
) Hmm,  wonder what this one is
Flounder: Ariel
Ariel: Flounder, will you relax
Nothing is going to happen
Flounder: (Seeing Shark looming behind him
)
Run
Run
We're gonna die
(Shark chases them all around
Ariel's bag is hung up
She goes back for it
Shark almost gets them
They head for porthole
) Oh No
(They crash through and go round and round
Flounder gets knocked silly but Ariel saves him and traps Shark) You big bully
(Shark snaps at him and he swims away
) Ariel: (Laughing
) Flounder, you really are a guppy
Flounder:  am not
(On surface
Scuttle on his island humming and looking through his telescope
) Ariel: Scuttle
Scuttle: (Looking through the telescope the wrong way, shouting
) Whoa
Mermaid off the port bow
Ariel, how you doin' kid
(Lowers telescope to reveal Ariel at wing's length
) Whoa, what a swim
Ariel: Scuttle - look what we found
Flounder: Yeah - we were in this sunken ship - it was really creepy
Scuttle: Human stuff, huh
Hey, lemme see
(Picks up fork
) Look at this
Wow - this is special - this is very, very unusual
Ariel: What
What is it
Scuttle: It's a dinglehopper
Humans use these little babies
to straighten their hair out
See - just a little twirl here an' a yank there and - voiolay
You got an aesthetically pleasing configuration of hair that humans go nuts over
Ariel:  dinglehopper
Flounder: What about that one
Scuttle: (Holding pipe) Ah - this  haven't seen in years
This is wonderful
banded, bulbous - snarfblat
Ariel and Flounder: Oohhh
Scuttle: Now, the snarfblat dates back to prehistorical times, when humans used to sit around, and stare at each other all day
Got very boring
So, they invented the snarfblat to make fine music
Allow me
(Scuttle blows into the pipe; seaweed pops out the other end
) Ariel: Music
Oh, the concert
Oh my gosh, my father's gonna kill me
Flounder: The concert was today
Scuttle: (Still contemplating pipe
) Maybe you could make a little planter out of it or somethin'
Ariel: Uh, 'm sorry, 've gotta go
Thank you Scuttle
(Waves
) Scuttle: Anytime sweetie, anytime
(Cut to Flotsam and Jetsam, then Ursula in background watching magic projection of Ariel swimming
) Ursula: Yeeeeeees, hurry home, princess
We wouldn't want to miss old daddy's celebration, now, would we
Huh
Celebration indeed
Bah
In  day, we had fantastical feasts when  lived in the palace
And now, look at me - wasted away to practically nothing - banished and exiled and practically starving, while he and his flimsy fish-folk celebrate
Well, 'll give 'em something to celebrate soon enough
Flotsam
Jetsam
want you to keep an extra close watch on this pretty little daughter of his
She may be the key to Triton's undoing
(Fade to the palace throne room where Ariel is being admonished
) Triton:  just don't know what we're going to do with you, young lady
Ariel: Daddy, 'm sorry,  just forgot,  - Triton: As a result of your careless behaviour - Sebastian: Careless and reckless behaviour
Triton: - the entire celebration was, er - Sebastian: Well, it was ruined
That's all
Completely destroyed
This concert was to be the pinnacle of my distinguished career
Now thanks to you  am the laughing stock of the entire kingdom
Flounder: But it wasn't her fault
Ah - well - first, ahh, this shark chased us - yeah - yeah
And we tried to - but we couldn't - and - grrrrrrrrr - and - and we - whoooaaaaaa - oh, and then we were safe
But then this seagull came, and it was this is this, and that is that, and - Triton: Seagull
What
Oh - you went up to the surface again, didn't you
'
Ariel: Nothing - happened
Triton: Oh, Ariel, How many times must we go through this
You could've been seen by one of those barbarians - by - by one of those humans
Ariel: Daddy, they're not barbarians
Triton: They're dangerous
Do you think  want to see my youngest daughter snared by some fish-eater's hook
Ariel: 'm sixteen years old - 'm not a child anymore - Triton: Don't you take that tone of voice with me young lady
As long as you live under my ocean, you'll obey my rules
Ariel: But if you would just listen - Triton: Not another word - and  am never,  to hear of you going to the surface again
Is that clear
(Ariel leaves, crying
) Sebastian: Hm
Teenagers
They think they know everything
You give them an inch, they swim all over you
Triton: Do you, er, think  -  was too hard on her
Sebastian: Definitely not
Why, if Ariel was my daughter, 'd show her who was boss
None of this "flitting to the surface" and other such nonsense
No, sir - 'd keep her under tight control
Triton: You're absolutely right, Sebastian
Sebastian: Of course
Triton: Ariel needs constant supervision
Sebastian: Constant
Triton: Someone to watch over her - to keep her out of trouble
Sebastian: All the time - Triton: And  are just the crab to do it
(Cut to Sebastion walking down corridor
) Sebastian: How do  get myself into these situations
should be writing symphonies - not tagging along after some headstrong teenager
(Sees Ariel and Flounder sneaking off and follows
) Hmm
What is that girl up to
(He barely makes it into cave and sees Ariel's collection
) Huh
Flounder: Ariel, are you okay
Ariel: If only  could make him understand
just don't see things the way he does
don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things - could be bad
Look at this stuff Isn't it neat
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete
Wouldn't you think 'm the girl The girl who has ev'rything
Look at this trove Treasures untold How many wonders can one cavern hold
Lookin' around here you'd think Sure, she's got everything 've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty 've got whozits and whatzits galore (You want thingamabobs
got twenty) But who cares
No big deal want more wanna be where the people are wanna see Wanna see 'em dancin' Walkin' around on those (Whad'ya call 'em
) oh - feet Flippin' your fins you don't get too far Legs are required for jumpin', dancin' Strollin' along down a (What's that word again
) street Up where they walk Up where they run Up where they stay all day in the sun Wanderin' free Wish  could be Part of that world What would  give If  could live Outta these waters
What would  pay To spend a day Warm on the sand
Betcha on land They understand Bet they don't reprimand their daughters Bright young women Sick o' swimmin' Ready to stand And ready to know what the people know Ask 'em my questions And get some answers What's a fire and why does it (What's the word
) burn
When's it my turn
Wouldn't  love Love to explore that shore above
Out of the sea Wish  could be Part of that world (Sebastion has been struggling around and now comes crashing down making a lot of noise
) Ariel: Sebastion
Sebastian: Ariel - what, are you mad
How could you - what is all this
Ariel: It, err, it's just my - collection
Sebastian: Oh
see
Your collection
Hmmm ' - Flounder: You're not gonna tell him, are you
Ariel: Oh, please, Sebastian, he would never understand
Sebastian: Ariel
You're under a lot of pressure down here
Come with me, 'll take you home and get you something warm to drink
( ship passes by overhead
) Ariel: What do you suppose
Sebastion: Ariel
Ariel
(On surface
Fireworks in the sky around ship
Ariel looks on, amazed
Sebastion and Flounder arrive
) Sebastion: Ariel, what - what are you- jumpin' jellyfish
Ariel, Ariel
Please come back
(Ariel swims to ship and watches party until Max finds her
) Eric: (Whistles
) Max, here boy
Hey, come on, mutt, whatcha doing, huh Max
Good boy
(Ariel sees him and is stricken
) Scuttle: Hey there, sweetie
Quite a show, eh
Ariel: Scuttle, be quiet
They'll hear you
Scuttle: Oooh,  gotcha,  gotcha
We're being intrepidatious
' (Ariel grabs his beak
) Ariel: 've never seen a human this close before
Oh - he's very handsome, isn't he
Scuttle: (Looking at Max)  dunno, he looks kinda hairy and slobbery to me
Ariel: Not that one - the one playing the snarfblat
Grimsby: Silence
Silence
It is now my honour and privilege to present our esteemed Prince Eric with a very special, very expensive, very large birthday present
Eric: Ah, Grimsby - y'old beanpole, you shouldn't have
Grimsby:  know
Happy birthday, Eric
(Large, gaudy statue of Eric is revealed
Max growls
) Eric: Gee, Grim
It's, err, it's, err - it's really somethin'
Grimsby: Yes,  commissioned it myself
Of course,  had hoped it would be a wedding present, but
Eric: Come on, Grim, don't start
Look, you're not still sore because  didn't fall for the princess of Glauerhaven, are you
Grimsby: Oh, Eric, it isn't me alone
The entire kingdom wants to see you happily settled down with the right girl
Eric: Well, she's out there somewhere
just -  just haven't found her yet
Grimsby: Well, perhaps you haven't been looking hard enough
Eric: Believe me, Grim, when  find her 'll know - without a doubt
It'll just - bam
- hit me - like lightning
(Lightning and thunder appear and the sky grows dark
) Sailor: Hurricane a'commin'
Stand fast
Secure the riggin'
(Storm hits
) Scuttle: Whoa
The wind's all of a sudden on the move here
(He is blown away
) Oh
Ariel
(Ship crashes through storm
Lightning starts a fire
rock looms ahead
) Eric: Look out
(Ship crashes and all are thrown overboard except Max
) Grim, hang on
(Sees Max
) Max
(Goes back to save him
) Jump Max
Come on boy, jump
You can do it Max
(He saves Max but is trapped on board
) Grimsby:
(Ship explodes
Ariel finds Eric near drowning and pulls him away
) (On beach
Ariel is sitting next to an unconscious Eric
) Ariel: Is he - dead
Scuttle: (Opens Eric's eyelid
) It's hard to say
(Puts his ear against Eric's foot
)  Oh,  -  can't make out a heartbeat
Ariel: No, look
He's breathing
He's so, beautiful
What would  give To live where you are
What would  pay To stay here beside you
What would  do to see you Smiling at me
Where would we walk
Where would we run
If we could stay all day in the sun
Just you and me And  could be Part of your world (Sebastion and Flounder have washed up and are watching scene
Max and Grimsby approach
Ariel hurries away
) Grimsby: Eric
Oh, Eric
You really delight in these sadistic strains on my blood pressure, don't you
Eric:  girl - rescued me
She was - singing
she had the most - beautiful voice
Grimsby: Ah, Eric,  think you've swallowed a bit too much seawater
Off we go
Come on, Max
Sebastian: We just gotta forget this whole thing ever happened
The sea king will never know
You won't tell him,  won't tell him
will stay in one piece
Ariel: don't know when don't know how But  know something's starting right now Watch and you'll see Some day 'll be Part of your world (Flotsam and Jetsam appear
Fade to Ursula watching from her chamber
) Ursula: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no
can't stand it - it's too easy
The child is in love with a human
And not just any human - a prince
Her daddy'll  that
King Triton's headstrong, lovesick girl would make a charming addition to my little garden
(Fade to palace
Then sister's dressing room
) Andrina: Ariel, dear, time to come out
You've been in there all morning
(Ariel emerges, singing to herself
) Atina: What is with her lately
Ariel: Morning, Daddy
(Ariel swims off
) Atina: Oh, she's got it bad
Triton: What
What has she got
Andrina: Isn't it obvious, Daddy
Ariel's in love
Triton: Ariel
In love
(Cut to Sebastion pacing on rock outside
) Sebastian:
So far, so good
don't think the king knows
But it will not be easy keeping something like this a secret for long
Ariel: (Picking petals off a flower) He loves me
hmmm, he loves me not
He loves me
knew it
Sebastian: Ariel, stop talking crazy
Ariel:  gotta see him again - tonight
Scuttle knows where he lives
Sebastian: Ariel - please
Will you get your head out of the clouds and back in the water where it belongs
Ariel: 'll swim up to his castle
Then Flounder will splash around to get his attention, and then with - Sebastian: Down  is your home
Ariel - listen to me
The human world - it's a mess
Life under the sea is better than anything they got up there
The seaweed is always greener In somebody else's lake You dream about going up there But that is a big mistake Just look at the world around you Right here on the ocean floor Such wonderful things surround you What more is you lookin' for
Under the sea Under the sea Darling it's better Down where it's wetter Take it from me Up on the shore they work all day Out in the sun they slave away While we devotin' Full time to floatin' Under the sea Down here all the fish is happy As off through the waves they roll The fish on the land ain't happy They sad 'cause they in their bowl But fish in the bowl is lucky They in for a worser fate One day when the boss get hungry Guess who's gon' be on the plate Under the sea Under the sea Nobody beat us Fry us and eat us In fricassee We what the land folks loves to cook Under the sea we off the hook We got no troubles Life is the bubbles Under the sea Under the sea Since life is sweet here We got the beat here Naturally Even the sturgeon an' the ray They get the urge 'n' start to play We got the spirit You got to hear it Under the sea The newt play the flute The carp play the harp The plaice play the bass And they soundin' sharp The bass play the brass The chub play the tub The fluke is the duke of soul (Yeah) The ray he can play The lings on the strings The trout rockin' out The blackfish she sings The smelt and the sprat They know where it's at An' oh that blowfish blow Under the sea Under the sea When the sardine Begin the beguine It's music to me What do they got
lot of sand We got a hot crustacean band Each little clam here know how to jam here Under the sea Each little slug here Cuttin' a rug here Under the sea Each little snail here Know how to wail here That's why it's hotter Under the water Ya we in luck here Down in the muck here Under the sea (They discover that Ariel has left with Flounder
) Ariel
Ariel
Oh
somebody's got to nail that girl's fins to the floor
Seahorse: Sebastian
Sebastian, 've been looking all over for you
've got an urgent message from the sea king
Sebastian: The sea king
Seahorse: He wants to see you right away - something about Ariel
Sebastian: He knows
(In palace throne room
Triton looking at flower
) Triton: Let's see, now
Oh, who could the lucky merman be
(Notices Sebastion
) Come in, Sebastion
Sebastian: (Sotto)  mustn't overreact
must remain calm
(Five octaves higher than normal) Yes - (loco) yes, Your Majesty
Triton: Now, Sebastian, 'm concerned about Ariel
Have you noticed she's been acting peculiar lately
Sebastian: Peculiar
Triton: You know, moaning about, daydreaming, singing to herself
You haven't noticed, hmm
Sebastian: Oh - well,  - Triton: Sebastian
Sebastian: Hmmm
Triton:  know you've been keeping something from me
Sebastian: Keeping
something
Triton: About Ariel
Sebastian: Ariel
Triton: In love
Sebastian:  tried to stop her, sir
She wouldn't listen
told her to stay away from humans - they are bad, they are trouble, they - Triton: Humans
Sebastian: Humans
Ho ho ho ho
Who said anything about humans
(Fade to Ariel and Flounder entering cave
) Ariel: Flounder, why can't you just tell me what this is all about
Flounder: You'll see
It's a suprise
Ariel: (Sees statue of Eric
) Oh, Flounder- Flounder you're the best
it looks just like him
It even has his eyes
"Why, Eric, run away with you
This is all so - so sudden
(Turns around and sees Triton
) Daddy
Triton:  consider myself a reasonable merman
set certain rules, and expect those rules to be obeyed
Ariel: But Daddy
- Triton: Is it true you rescued a human from drowing
Ariel: Daddy,  had to- Triton: Contact between the human world and the mer-world is strictly for- bidden
Ariel, you know that
Everyone knows that
Ariel: He would have died- Triton: One less human to worry about
Ariel: You don't even know him
Triton: Know him
don't have to know him
They're all the same
Spineless, savage, harpooning, fish-eaters, incapable of any feeling- Ariel: Daddy,  love him
Triton: No
Have you lost your senses completely
He's a human, you're a mermaid
Ariel:  don't care
Triton: So help me Ariel,  am going to get through to you
And if this is the only way, so be it
(Begins to blast the artifacts with his trident
) Ariel: Daddy
No
No, please- Daddy, stop
Daddy, Nooo
(He blasts statue
Ariel begins crying and he leaves, ashamed
) Sebastion: Ariel,
Ariel: (Still crying
) Just go away
(He leaves and Flotsan and Jetsam appear
) Flotsam: Poor child
Jetsam: Poor, sweet child
Flotsam: She has a very serious problem Jetsam: If only there were something we could do
Flotsam: But there is something
Ariel: Who - who are you
Jetsam: Don't be scared
Flotsam: We represent someone who can help you
Jetsam: Someone who could make all your dreams come true
Flotsam and Jetsam: Just imagine - Jetsam: You and your prince - Flotsam and Jetsam: Together, forever
Ariel:  don't understand
Jetsam: Ursula has great powers Ariel: The sea witch
Why, that's -  couldn't possibly - no
Get out of here
Leave me alone
Flotsam: Suit yourself
Jetsam: It was only a suggestion
[Jetsam flicks the statue's broken face towards Ariel
] Ariel: [Looking at the face] Wait
Flotsam and Jetsam: Yeeeeeeeeeess
(Cut to outside of cave with Flounder and Sebastion
) Flounder: (snif) Poor Ariel
Sebastion:  didn't mean to tell, it was an accident
(Ariel passes by
) Ariel - where are you going
Ariel, what are you doing here with this riff-raff
riel: 'm going to see Ursula
Sebastian: Ariel, no
No, she's a demon, she's a monster
Ariel: Why don't you go tell my father
You're good at that
Sebastion: But
But,
(To Flounder
) Come on
(They travel towards Ursula's cavern
) Flotsam and Jetsam: This way
(Ariel enters and is hung up in the garden of souls
) Ursula: Come in
Come in, my child
We mustn't lurk in doorways - it's rude
One  question your upbringing
Now, then
You're here because you have a thing for this human
This, er, prince fellow
Not that  blame you - he is quite a catch, isn't he
Well, angel fish, the solution to your problem is simple
The only way to get what you want - is to become a human yourself
Ariel: Can you  that
Ursula: My dear, sweet child
That's what  do - it's what  live for
To help unfortunate merfolk - like yourself
Poor souls with no one else to turn to
admit that in the past 've been a nasty They weren't kidding when they called me, well, a witch But you'll find that nowadays 've mended all my ways Repented, seen the light and made a switch True
Yes And  fortunately know a little magic It's a talent that  always have possessed And here lately, please don't laugh use it on behalf Of the miserable, lonely and depressed (Pathetic) Poor unfortunate souls In pain In need This one longing to be thinner That one wants to get the girl And do  help them
Yes, indeed Those poor unfortunate souls So sad So true They come flocking to my cauldron Crying, "Spells, Ursula please
" And  help them
Yes,  do Now it's happened once or twice Someone couldn't pay the price And 'm afraid  had to rake 'em 'cross the coals Yes, 've had the odd complaint But on the whole 've been a saint To those poor unfortunate souls Now, here's the deal
will make you a potion that will turn you into a human for three days
Got that
Three days
Now listen, this is import- ant
Before the sun sets on the third day, you've got to get dear ol' princey to fall in love with you
That is, he's got to kiss you
Not just any kiss - the kiss of true love
If he does kiss you before the sun sets on the third day, you'll remain human, permanently, but - if he doesn't, you turn back into a mermaid, and - you belong to me
Sebastion: No Ariel
(He is silenced by Flotsam and Jetsam
) Ursula: Have we got a deal
Ariel: If  become human, 'll never be with my father or sisters again
Ursula: That's right
But - you'll have your man
Life's full of tough choices, innit
Oh - and there is one more thing
We haven't discussed the subject of payment
You can't get something for nothing, you know
Ariel: But  don't have any - Ursula: 'm not asking much
Just a token, really, a trifle
You'll never even miss it
What  want from you is
your voice
Ariel: My voice
Ursula: You've got it, sweetcakes
No more talking, singing, zip
Ariel: But without my voice, how can  - Ursula: You'll have your looks
Your pretty face
And don't underestimate the importance of body language
Ha
The men up there don't like a lot of blabber They think a girl who gossips is a bore Yes, on land it's much preferred For ladies not to say a word And after all, dear, what is idle prattle for
Come on, they're not all that impressed with conversation True gentlemen avoid it when they can But they dote and swoon and fawn On a lady who's withdrawn It's she who holds her tongue who gets her man Come on, you poor unfortunate soul Go ahead
Make your choice
'm a very busy woman And  haven't got all day It won't cost much Just your voice
You poor unfortunate soul It's sad But true If you want to cross a bridge, my sweet You've got to pay the toll Take a gulp and take a breath And go ahead and sign the scroll
Flotsam, Jetsam, now 've got her, boys The boss is on a roll This poor unfortunate soul
(Ariel signs contract
) Paluga, sarruga, come winds of the Caspian Sea
Now rings us glossitis and max laryngitis, La voce to me
Now
sing
Ariel: (Sings
) Ursula: Keep singing
(Giant magical hands rip out Ariel's voice and give it to Ursula
She laughs as Ariel is changed into a human and rushed to the surf- ace by Flounder and Sebastion
) (Fade to beach
Eric and Max are walking near castle
) Eric: (Playing flute
) That voice
can't get it out of my head
've looked everywhere, Max - where could she be
(On other side of rocks Ariel is washed up
Sebastion and Flounder are exausted
Ariel sees her legs and is amazed
) Scuttle: Well, look at what the catfish dragged in
Look at ya
Look at ya
There's something different
Don't tell me -  got it
It's your hairdo, right
You've been using the dinglehopper, right
No
No huh, well let me see
New
seashells
No new seashells
gotta admit  can't put my foot on it right now, but if  just stand here long enough  know that 'll - Sebastian: '  ,
She traded her voice to the sea witch and got legs
Jeez, man
Scuttle:  knew that
Flounder: Ariel's been turned into a human
She's gotta make the prince fall in love with her, and he's gotta ki- he's gotta kiss her
(Ariel tries to get up
) Sebastion: And she's only got three days
Just look at her
On legs
On human legs
My nerves are shot
This is a catastrophe
What would her father say
'll tell you what her father'd say, he'd say he's gonna kill himself a crab, that's what her father'd say
'm gonna march meself straight home right now and tell him just like  shoulda done de minute- (Ariel grabs him
)
and don't you shake your head at me, young lady
Maybe there's still time
If we could get that witch to give you back your voice, you could go home with all the normal fish, and just be
just be
just be miserable for the rest of your life
All right, all right
'll try to help you find that prince
Boy
What a soft-shell 'm turning out to be
Scuttle: Now, Ariel, 'm tellin' ya, if you wanna be a human the first thing you gotta do is dress like one
Now lemme see
(Cut to Eric and Max
Max smells Ariel and gets excited
) Eric: Max
Huh
what, Max
Scuttle: (Whistles
) Ya look great kid
Ya look - sensational
(They hear Max
He arrives and chases Ariel up on a rock
) Eric: Max
Max - Quiet Max
What's gotten into you fella
(Sees Ariel
) Oh
Oh,  see
Are you
, miss
'm sorry if this knucklehead scared you
He's harmless, really -
you
seem very familiar
to me
Have we met
We have met
knew it
You're the one - the one 've been looking for
What's your name
(Ariel mouths "Ariel" but no words come out
) What's wrong
What is it
You can't speak
(Ariel shakes her head
) Oh
Then you couldn't be who  thought
(Ariel and Max look frustrated
She tries pantomime
) What is it
You're hurt
No, No
You need help
(She falls into him
) Whoa, whoa, careful - careful - easy
Gee, you must have really been through something
Don't worry, 'll help you
Come on
Come on, you'll be okay
(Fade to Ariel in bath playing with bubbles
) Carlotta: Washed up from a shipwreck
Oh, the poor thing
We'll have you feeling better in no time
[Picks up Ariel's "dress"] 'll just - 'll just get this washed for you
(Cut to Sebastion in dress getting washed
) Woman 1: Well you must have at least heard about this girl
Woman 2: Well, Gretchen says
(Sebastion is dunked
)
since when has Gretchen got anything right
mean really, this girl shows up in rags and doesn't speak- Sebastion: Madame, please
Woman 2:
not my idea of a princess
If Eric's looking for a girl,  know a couple of highly available ones right here
(Sebastion dives into kitchen and sees various fish cooking
He faints
) (Cut to castle dining room
) Grimsby: Oh, Eric, be reasonable
Nice young ladies just don't - swim around rescuing people in the middle of the ocean and then - flutter off into oblivion, like some - Eric: 'm tellin' you, Grim, she was
'm gonna find that girl - and 'm gonna marry her
Carlotta: Ha Ha
Come on honey
Don't be shy
(Ariel enteres in a beautiful dress
) Grimsby: Oh, Eric, isn't she a vision
Eric: You look - wonderful
Grimsby: Come come come, you must be famished
Let me help you my dear
There we go - ah - quite comfy
Uh
It's - It's not ofen that we have such a lovely dinner guest, eh Eric
(Ariel starts combing hair with a fork
They look dumbfounded and she is embarrased
She sees pipe and brightens
) Uh, do you like it
It is rather - fine
(She blows its contents into his face
Eric laughs
) Carlotta: Oh, my
Eric: Ahem, so sorry Grim
Carlotta: Why, Eric, that's the first time 've seen you smile in weeks
Grimsby: (Wiping his face
) Oh, very amusing
Carlotta, my dear, what's for dinner
Carlotta: Oooh, you're gonna love it
Chef's been fixing his specialty, stuffed crab
(Cut to Sebastion watching Louis cook
He is humming to himself
) Louis: Les poissons Les poissons How  love les poissons Love to chop And to serve little fish First  cut off their heads Then  pull out the bones Ah mais oui Ca c'est toujours delish Les poissons Les poissons Hee hee hee Hah hah hah With the cleaver  hack them in two pull out what's inside And  serve it up fried God,  love little fishes Don't you
Here's something for tempting the palate Prepared in the classic technique First you pound the fish flat with a mallet Then you slash through the skin Give the belly a slice Then you rub some salt in 'Cause that makes it taste nice Zut alors,  have missed one
Sacre bleu What is this
How on earth could  miss Such a sweet little succulent crab
Quel dommage What a loss Here we go in the sauce Now some flour,  think Just a dab Now  stuff you with bread It don't hurt 'cause you're dead And you're certainly lucky you are 'Cause it's gonna be hot In my big silver pot Toodle loo mon poisson Au revoir
(Sebastion hops back and Louis grabs him again
) What is this
(Sebastion pinches his nose and a battle ensues
Louis knocks over a large cabinet
) (Cut to dining room
Huge crash is heard
) Carlotta:  think 'd better go see what Louis is up to
(Back to kitchen
Louis is trashing the place
) Louis: Come out you little pipsqueak and fight like a man
Carlotta: Louis
What are you doing
Louis: Well -  -  was just - er, er, 'm sorry, madame
(Cut back to dining room
) Grimsby: You know, Eric, perhaps our young guest might enjoy seeing some of the sights of the kingdom
Something in the way of a tour
Eric: 'm sorry, Grim, what was that
Grimsby: You can't spend all your time moping about, you need to get out
Do something, have a life
(Grimsby lifts his plate's cover to reveal Sebastian cowering in the salad
)  Get your mind off - Eric: Easy, Grim, Easy
(Ariel lifts her own plate cover and signals for Sebastian to hide there
Sebastian rushes across while no one is looking
) It's not a bad idea
If she's interested
Well - whaddaya say
Would you like to join me on a tour of my kingdom tomorrow
(Ariel nods vigorously, leaning heavily on her plate's cover
) Grimsby: Wonderful, now let's eat, before this crab wanders off my plate
(Fade to Ariel watching Eric and Max from balcony
) Eric: Come here boy
Arrr
(He sees Ariel and waves
She is emb- arassed and goes back inside
) Sebastian: This has got to be, without a doubt, the single most humiliating day of my life
hope you appreciate what  go through for you, young lady
Now - we got to make a plan to get that boy to kiss you
Tomorrow, when he takes you for that ride, you gotta look your best
You gotta bat your eyes - like this
You gotta pucker up your lips - like this
(He sees she is asleep
) Hm
You are hopeless child
You know dat
Completely hopeless
(Fade to undersea palace
Seahorse swims up to Triton
) Triton: Any sign of them
Seahorse: No, Your Majesty
We've searched everywhere
We've found no trace of your daughter - or Sebastian
Triton: Well, keep looking
Leave no shell unturned, no coral unexplored
Let no one in this kingdom sleep until she's safe at home
Seahorse: Yes sire
(He leaves
) Triton: Oh, what have  done
What have  done
(Morning at castle
Ariel and Eric leave for their tour
Ariel is amazed by everything
) Flounder: (As they pass water
) Has he kissed her yet
Sebastion: Not yet
Flounder: Ohh
(Ariel and Eric go dancing and see the town
) Scuttle: Yo, Flounder
Any kissing
Flounder: No, not yet
Scuttle: Hmm
Well they - they better get crackin'
(They leave town and Ariel drives, almost crashing
They end up rowing on a still lagoon in the even- ing
) Flounder: Move over - move your big feathers
can't see a thing
Scuttle: Nothing is happening
Only one day left, and that boy ain't puckered up once
All right, this calls for a little vocal romantic stimulation
Stand back
(He flies over and sings very badly
) Eric: Wow
Somebody should find that poor animal and put it out of its misery
Sebastian: Jeez, man, 'm surrounded by amateurs
You want something done, you've got to do it yourself
First, we got to create the mood
Percussion
Strings
Winds
Words
There you see her Sitting there across the way She don't got a lot to say But there's something about her And you don't know why But you're dying to try You wanna kiss the girl Eric: Did you hear something
Sebastion: Yes, you want her Look at her, you know you do Possible she wants you too There is one way to ask her It don't take a word Not a single word Go on and kiss the girl Sha la la la la la My oh my Look like the boy too shy Ain't gonna kiss the girl Sha la la la la la Ain't that sad
Ain't it a shame
Too bad, he gonna miss the girl Eric: You know,  feel really bad not knowing your name
Heh - maybe  could guess
Is it, err, Mildred

How 'bout - Diana
Rachel
Sebastian: Ariel
Her name is Ariel
Eric: Ariel
Ariel
Well, that's kinda pretty

Sebastion: Now's your moment Floating in a blue lagoon Boy you better do it soon No time will be better She don't say a word And she won't say a word Until you kiss the girl Sha la la la la la Don't be scared You got the mood prepared Go on and kiss the girl Sha la la la la la Don't stop now Don't try to hide it how You want to kiss the girl Sha la la la la la Float along And listen to the song The song say kiss the girl Sha la la la la The music play Do what the music say You got to kiss the girl You've got to kiss the girl You wanna kiss the girl You've gotta kiss the girl Go on and kiss the girl (The boat tips over
) Eric: Whoa, hang on - 've gottcha
(Flotsam and Jetsam congradulate each other
) (Cut to Ursula's cavern
) Ursula: Nice work, boys
That was a close one
Too close
The little tramp
Oh, she's better than  thought
At this rate, he'll be kissing her by sunset for sure
Well, it's time Ursula took matters into her own tentacles
Triton's daughter will be mine - and then 'll make him writhe
'll see him wriggle like a worm on a hook
(Laughing, she transforms into a human with Ariel's voice
) (Fade to castle at night
Eric is playing the flute and contemplating as Grimsby approaches
) Grimsby: Eric, if  may say, far better than any dream girl, is one of flesh and blood, one warm and caring, and right before your eyes
(He sees Ariel, sighs, and tosses away flute
He is distracted by Ursula/Vanessa singing with Ariel's voice and is placed under her spell
) (Scuttle flying toward castle in morning
) Scuttle: Ariel
Ariel, wake up
Wake up
just heard the news
Congratula- tions, kiddo, we did it
Sebastian: What is this idiot babbling about
Scuttle: Right - as if you two didn't know, uh
The whole town's buzzin' about the prince gettin' himself hitched this afternoon
You know, he's getting married
You silly sidewalker
just wanted to wish you luck
'll catch you later,  wouldn't miss it
(Ariel brightens and runs downstairs, only to see Eric and Vanessa together
) Grimsby: Well, uh - err, Eric
-it appears that  was mistaken
This mystery maiden of yours does - in fact exist
And - and she is lovely
Congratula- tions, my dear
Eric: We wish to be married as soon as possible
Grimsby: Oh, yes - of course, Eric, but, er - but these things do take time, you know
Eric: This afternoon, Grimsby
The wedding ship departs at sunset
Grimsby: Oh, oh - very well, Eric - as you wish
(Ariel runs off crying
) (Cut to late afternoon as wedding ship starts to leave
Ariel on pier crying bitterly as Sebastion and Flounder look on
) (Cut to Scuttle flying and humming to himself
) Vanessa: What a lovely little bride 'll make, my dear 'll look divine Things are working out according to my ultimate design Soon 'll have that little mermaid and the ocean will be mine
Scuttle: (Seeing real Ursula in mirror
) The sea witch
Oh no
She's- gotta
(Runs into side of ship
Flies off to find Ariel
) Ariel

Ariel
was flying,  wa - of course  was flying - An' -  s- saw that the watch - the witch was watchin' a mirror, and she was singin' with a stolen set o' pipes
Do you hear what 'm tellin' you Sebastian: Are you sure about this
Scuttle: Have  ever been wrong
mean when it's important
Flounder: What are we gonna do
(Ariel hears Ursula's voice in her head as the sun drops
) Ursula:
Before the sun sets on the third day
(Ariel jumps in water but can't swim well
Sebastion sends down some barrels
) Sebastion: Ariel, grab on to that
Flounder, get her to that boat as fast as your fins can carry you
Flounder: 'll try
Sebastian: 've gotta get to the sea king
He must know about this
Scuttle: What - What about me
What about
Sebastian: You - find a way to
Scuttle: Stall the wedding
Wh- what am  - what - that's it
(He flies off to rally the animals and fish
) Move it, let's go, we got an emergency here
(Cut to wedding in progress
Max growls at Vanessa but she kicks him
) Priest: Dearly beloved
(Flounder is pulling Ariel toward ship
) Flounder: Don't worry Ariel
ugh - we - we're gonna make it
We're almost there
Priest: Yes, um, do you Eric, take Vanessa, to be your lawfully wedded wife, for as long as you both shall live
Eric: (Under spell
)  do
Priest: Eh, and do you
(Birds and animals swoop in for attack, causing great chaos
)
then by the power inves- Vanessa: Get away from me you slimy little- Oh, why you little- (In the struggle, the shell holding Ariel's voice it broken and it goes back to her
Eric comes out of the spell as she sings
) Eric: Ariel
Ariel: Eric
Eric: You - you can talk
You're the one
Vanessa: Eric, get away from her
Eric: It - it was you all the time
Ariel: Oh, Eric,  -  wanted to tell you
Vanessa:

You're too late
So long, loverboy
Eric: Ariel
(Ursula and Ariel go overboard
) Ursula: Poor little princess - it's not you 'm after
've a much bigger fish to - Triton: Ursula, stop
Ursula: Why, King Triton
Ha ha ha - How  you
Triton: Let her go
Ursula: Not a chance, Triton
She's mine now
We made a deal
Ariel: Daddy, 'm sorry
-  -  didn't mean to
didn't know - (Triton attacks the contract with a fierce blast from his trident, to no avail
) Ursula: You see
The contract's legal, binding and completely unbreakable - even for
Of course,  always was a girl with an eye for a bargain
The daughter of the great sea king is a very precious commodity
But - might be willing to make an exchange for someone even better
(Cut to Eric rowing away from ship
) Grimsby: Eric
What are you doing
Eric: Grim,  lost her once
'm not going to lose her again
(Back to Ursula and Triton
) Ursula: Now
Do we have a deal
(Triton signs contract
) Ha
It's done then
(Ariel is released and Triton is withered as Ursula laughs
) Ariel: No
Oh, No
Sebastion: Oh, your majesty
Ariel: Daddy
Ursula: (Picks up crown
) At last, it's mine
Ho, Ho
Ariel: You - You monster
Ursula: Don't fool with me you little brat
Contract or no-

Ariel: Eric
Eric look out
Ursula: After him

Ursula: Say goodbye to your sweetheart
(Ariel makes her miss Eric and blast Flotsam and Jetsam
) Babies
My poor, little poopsies
(On surface as Ursula grows beneath
) Ariel: Eric, you've got to get away from here
Eric: No,  won't leave you
Ursula: (Now very large
) You pitiful, insignificant, fool
Eric: Look out
Ursula: Now  am the ruler of all the ocean
The waves obey my every whim
The sea and all its spoils bow to my power
(She wrecks havoc, creates a whirlpool and raises some shipwrecks
) Ariel:
(He gets on board one of the ships as Ariel falls to the bottom of the whirlpool
Ursula attempts to blast her
) Ursula: (Laughing wickedly
) So much for true love
(As Ursula is about to finish Ariel, Eric steers the ship into her
She is impaled and dies most horribly
Eric collapses on the shore
The trident falls back to Triton and everything reverts to normal
) (Fade to morning with Eric on beach and Ariel watching from a distance
Triton and Sebastion look on
) Triton: She really does love him, doesn't she, Sebastian
Sebastian: Well, it's like  always say, Your Majesty
Children got to be free to lead their own lives
Triton: You - always say that
(sighs) Then  guess there's just one problem left
Sebastian: And what's that, Your Majesty
Triton: How much 'm going to miss her
(He turns her into a human and she goes to meet Eric
They kiss which fades into kiss on wedding day
Everyone is happy
Sebastion is attacked by Louis
He beats Louis up and returns to the sea

(Ariel and Triton hug
) Ariel:  love you Daddy

Just you and me, And  can be, Part of your world
