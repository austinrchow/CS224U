What can we do, doctor

Brad might act 'ghetto,' but let's face it, he's never been east of Beverly Hills
But what if we give him a little dose of reality
Let him get a firsthand look at the ghetto
You mean, have Brad actually
go there
Exactly
Sounds dangerous
It'll be perfectly safe
How does it work
We hire actors to play gangsters
They car-jack Brad,     then take him on a 'tour' of the     'hood
give him a little taste     of what thug life's really like

Tom hands them a checklist/itinerary
Okay, so here's the story -- it's your basic kidnapping
So we hold him for ransom
Right
But when you see   him acting ghetto and all, it    pisses you off  so much, you tour   him around the 'hood to show    him what things are really like

Mr

Congrats, my brother
We just booked another gig
Yeah, but it's totally dangerous, dude
You know what it's like in the 'hood
We could get shot
We can handle ourselves
Come on, man, it's the ultimate acting challenge
You know what really chaps  my ass
After years of training and  study, the only parts they'll give  us are gangbangers
Just once 'd   like to play a character who has  decent grammar and doesn't wear Timberlands

With a dead son, the sympathy factor could give us big spike in the female and gay demos
We've had such a problem with Bill's rich guy image, we could spin the issue to make him more 'Everymen,' you know, 'crime touches everyone,' like that
What about a voter backlash, like how could he run on the heels of a tragedy
No -- we push the 'courage under adversity' angle
Helps with his leadership profile
