" " Screenplay by David
Ward :
and we  to reveal that the black b
g
is actually the sludge-clogged surface of the Cuyahoga River
We   from the river to reveal the city of Cleveland, then follow with a series of shots of Cleveland landmarks
- Three men in Cleveland Indian baseball caps sit at the counter
, 22-year-old grad student,  , 30-year-old telephone worker, and  , 45-year-old house painter
, 65-year-old waitress, delivers their breakfast
Spring training starts the twelfth
How do you think the Indians will do this year
They don't look too good
The other two shake their heads in contemplation of this sorry fact
'  - 45-year-old   is talking to a fellow club member over lunch
They don't look particularly good, do they
- Two  are talking while they unload a freighter
'll tell ya
They don't look very fuckin' good
- Down on the field, two   speak Korean as they resod the outfield
(in subtitles) They're shitty
We   from the field to a glass-enclosed area on the third deck
-  - It's the Cleveland Indians' conference room
Three men are seated around the table;
the manager, , public relations head,  , operations director and   director of player personnel Donovan taps his pencil impatiently, obviously waiting for somebody
(checking his watch) Thirty minutes late
Think she'll show
She's got to
She's the damn owner now
She didn't last week
She was having a guava facial
As Butler tries to figure out what a guava facial is, the conference room doors swing open and a muscular  - enters, clearing the way for
, a flashy, striking woman in her early forties
Despite the designer clothes she favors, there is the hint of something less refined about her
She carries a Pekinese dog, - on her left hip
Good morning, gentlemen
Welcome to another season of Indians' baseball
The men applaud, but their hearts are barely in it
The Secretary-Bodyguard pulls out a chair at the head of the table and Rachel sits
know that it may not seem the same without Donald here this year, but promise you by the end of the season this team will have made history
Several eyes roll up around the room
(picking up a newspaper) Unfortunately there are some in the press who feel that
(reading from the page) "the ex-showgirl wife of Donald Phelps has no business being the owner of a major league baseball team
" Rachel crumbles the paper and throws it away
Obviously, Donald didn't feel that way or he wouldn't have left the team to me
And  was more than showgirl
was a dancer
Now, know some of you have doubts about my ability to run this franchise
God help you if  ever find out about it
This causes a few nervous glances in the room
Spring training begins in two weeks
(throwing a sheet of paper on the table) Here's the list of people we'll be inviting to camp this year
Donovan, Butler and Simmons pour over the list
could sit here and tell you what a great year we're gonna have, but the facts are we lost the two best players we had to free agency
We haven't won a pennant in 30 years
We haven't even finished in the first division for 15
Obviously it's time to make some changes
What do ya think
never heard of half these guys
And the ones  do know are way past their prime
Most of these guys never had a prime
(pointing to the sheet) This guy here is dead
Cross him off then
(under his breath) Let's not be hasty
It's time to shake things up, Charlie
Clear the board and start over
Well, it's not the best material 've ever had to work with, but 'll do my best to see we move up a notch this year
know you will, Charlie
That's why 'm movin' you up to General Manager
Congratulations
Rachel sticks out her hand
Donovan shakes it somewhat feebly, bewildered by this whole development
Well, that should do it for today
Thank you, gentlemen
Let's get to work
With that, Rachel gets up and breezes out of the room with her entourage, leaving Donovan and the others dumbfounded
(checking his watch) One minute, 58 seconds
'   - Donovan, carrying a boxful of belongings under each arm, pushes open the door of his new office and walks inside
The basic outfitting is masculine enough, but the room is full of feminine little accents; flowers in vases, porcelain desk accessories etc
Donovan is slightly overwhelmed
Suddenly, there's a voice at the door
- Mr
Donovan, Mrs
Phelps would like to see you
Sequence omitted from original script
'  - Donovan is ushered in by Rachel's Male Secretary
Donovan carries his player roster with him
'  - Come on in, Charlie
Have a seat
'm glad you called me in
'm still unclear on a couple things Oh, really
Like what
Well, if 'm the
, who's gonna be the Manager
was thinking of Lou Brown
Lou Brown
He's managed the Toledo Mud Hens of the International League for the last 30 years
This is hardly an impressive credential to Donovan
think he'll fit right in with our team concept
What exactly is our team concept
That's what  wanted to talk to you about
want to put together a team that will help us relocate to Miami
What do you mean
(referring to the roster) Some of these guys are furniture movers
'm serious about this, Charlie
It's no secret 've never liked Cleveland much
The weather's lousy, downtown is a pit, the stadium's falling apart, and we can't draw dick
Another couple of years of this and 'm gonna have to start feeding Cha-Cha dog food
Rachel bends down to give her dog, Cha-Cha, a little love pat, while Donovan tries to contain his disgust
Mrs
Phelps, you can't just up and move a team on a whim
It's hardly a whim
Miami's offered to build us a new stadium -- 62,000 capacity, 45
boxes, and no rent for the first million at the gate
Plus a 12 million dollar media guarantee; 45 percent of the concession gross, all of the parking and they pick up the stadium operations costs
No other franchise in baseball can match that deal
Even so, the League'll never let us leave Cleveland
We got a lease with the city
The lease says we have the right to move if our attendance falls below 800,000 for the year
(pushing across a copy of the lease) Paragraph 40, line 17
Donovan looks at it, the paragraph highlighted in yellow
If we play bad enough, we should be able to come in under that
What are you saying
You want us to lose
No, we've been losing
What  want us to do is finish dead last
Donovan is stunned
He casts around helplessly for some response
Mister Phelps would never have approved of this
He knew it had to be done
He just didn't have the courage to do it
(with veiled menace) Hopefully, you will come to see the wisdom of it
(pause) If this team lives up to its potential, we could have the worst record in all baseball
On Donovan's sunken face, we go to: - On a stretch of deserted Mexican highway
we hear a telephone
- The room is a total mess
The back door is off its hinges and a few chickens have wandered in
As they peck around the debris, we  the room, taking in beer cans, food wrappers and finally a trail of hastily discarded clothes, both male and female
We reach the bed and find our hero,  , 35, and with a couple days growth of stubble, passed out on his face
Sprawled across him asleep is a   in her late twenties
She's not great looking, but at least she's overweight
Taylor's hand fumbles to the  telephone
Yeh
It's Charlie Donovan calling from his office in Cleveland
We     between the two as we will in subsequent phone scenes
Hello, Jake
This is Charlie Donovan, new
of the Cleveland Indians
(skeptical) Yeh
wanted to call and say the organization remembers you fondly from the years you played here and we'd love to have you come to spring training for a shot at this year's club
Who is this
What
Is that you, Tolbert
This isn't very funny, ya know
'm hung over
My knees are killin' me
If you were gonna pull this shit, you could've at least said you were from the Yankees
Taylor struggles to get a look up at the girl on top of him
(still to Donovan) By the way, you were with me last night
Who's this girl on top of me
Donovan is baffled by this whole line of conversation
Tolbert
Tolbert
Screw it
Taylor hangs up, leaving Donovan staring into his phone
Taylor looks up to see  standing in the doorway
Tolbert
Who the hell were you talkin' to
On Taylor's reaction, we
: - We    , a portly man in his early fifties, making his way to his glass-partitioned office
Lines three and four are waiting for you, Mr
Brown
One guy about the - 70's
(picking up the phone) Tire World
Lou
This is Charlie Donovan, the new
of the Cleveland Indians
Listen, Lou,  hope you're sittin' down 'cause  got an offer you probably been dreamin' about your whole life
We been watchin' your progress down there at Toledo with a lotta interest and well
(a dramatic pause) How would you like to manage the Indians this year
For a moment there's silence on the line, then: don't know
(incredulous) What do ya mean you don't know
This is a chance to manage in the big leagues
Lemme think it over, will ya, Charlie
got a guy on the other line about some whitewalls
'll talk to ya later
Brown clicks off
Donovan puts his head down on his desk
'  - Donovan's on the phone to another player
Rick, we heard about your pitching out at Portland last year
Good-looking, muscular, 19-year-old
Sleeveless black -shirt
Talking on a wall phone in a nondescript room
'm, ah, not with them anymore
Vaughn has been working, sweating slightly
He takes off his cap to mop his brow -- revealing a   with He sports a  in his left ear
We'd still like to take a look at ya at our spring camp in Arizona, March first
- In the b
g
, Vaughn is on the phone
In the f
g
, we see security bars
Vaughn's in a Youth Authority prison
Yeh, well, 'm not sure  can make it by then
Don't worry, we're gettin' you out on a sort of work furlough deal
Any questions
Yeh
Where's Cleveland
'  - On the speaker again to Lou Brown
Rachel watches, impatient for him to close the deal
Look, Lou, you been in baseball thirty years
Don't you wanna advance some
(eating a sack lunch) used to coach the unwed mothers' softball team
have advanced some
Rachel rubs her fingers together, making the money sign to Donovan
Well, what are you really worried about
The money
Naw, 'm just not sure 'd be happy in a big organization like that
Owners are always on your back, tryin' to "help you out
" don't think that's gonna be a problem
Down here baseball's a game, not a business
don't wanta be a babysitter for a buncha millionaires who think they know it all already
We don't have any millionaires
Well then, bonus babies or whatever you got
Don't have any bonus babies either
Don't you have any proven major league talent
(embarrassed) Not that  know of
Well, then
'll be up in a couple days
What
Sounds like my kinda team
Have my contracts ready
Brown hangs up
(to the others) Guess  really put the screws to him
- This one's a dandy
The left field wall is a 20-foot high, solid granite outcropping
final out is made and the teams change over
returning to the dugout at the end of the inning, wondering what the hell he's doin' here
Taylor, telephone for you
Taylor goes to the phone in the clubhouse tunnel
Hello
Jake, Charlie Donovan again
Oh yeh, Charlie, look, 'm sorry about this morning
No problem
Look, Jake, camp starts on the first
Can you make it
Sure
You been stayin' in shape down there
Oh hell, yeh,  work out every day
thought so
See ya in Arizona
Donovan hangs up
Taylor shoots a fist in the air, and we
: approaching his
Let's go, Taylor
You're up
Luis, 'm not gonna be playin' anymore
got a tryout in the States
Fine
Leave your uniform
But  changed at the motel
Leave your uniform
coming out of the stadium, his bats and gloves over his shoulder
He has on his spikes and a pair of boxer shorts
-   - Taylor sits in the back seat
He has six Coke bottles filled with sand strapped to his ankles
He lifts his legs up and down to strengthen his muscles
Sequence omitted from original script
'     - Donovan, Brown and two of his coaches,   (pitching) and   (hitting) are on the field, witnessing the arrival of their "troops
" First to arrive is: He gets out of a taxi and goes to the trunk to get his bats and luggage
This looks like Jake Taylor
Brown turns around from a conversation with Temple
He was an Allstar in Boston, wasn't he
Yeh
Wish we had him two years ago
We did
Four years ago then
'  - Like an Army barracks
Rows of bunk beds seperated by lockers
Taylor walks in with Temple, the hitting instructor
What happened to the private rooms
We're on an austerity program
This is what happens when you finish 24 games out
, , back at the field, supervising the arrival of more players
The first is a tall, muscular Latin,  , dressed in black from head to toe
He arrives on foot, carrying a black suitcase and pulling a black bat case on wheels
He looks like a gunfighter coming into Dodge
Who's that
think it's Cerrano
Defected from Cuba
Wanted religious freedom
What's his religion
Voodoo
- pulling into the parking lot
Out steps  , high- priced third baseman
Brown eyes him with vague disapproval
Thought you didn't have any high- priced talent
(sheepish) forgot about Dorn, 'cause he's only high-priced
Got him as a free agent three years ago
Still hits the ball pretty well, doesn't he
Yeh, he just can't field it
Dorn pulls his golf clubs out of the car
We'll shape him up
a 22-year-old black, pulling up in a '72  Beetle which he's got a Cadillac grille on
He steps out in his shades and sharkskin suit
Don't recognize this guy
Hayes strolls up and introduces himself
Say hey, Willie Mays Hayes here play like Mays and run like Hayes
Lou Brown
Nice to meet ya, Hayes
Thanks
Well,  gotta get my stuff
Hayes hustles off toward his car
don't remember a Hayes on the list
motorcycle pulls to a stop in the lot, diverting everyone's attention from Hayes
Off steps Ricky Vaughn, a hefty bag over his shoulder
He's still sporting his radical do
Look at this fuckin' guy
Maybe he's the mascot
Donovan is speechless
Brown breaks into a small smile
Yes, sir, this is his kinda team
' Taylor is putting his stuff away in a locker
Vaughn enters the barracks and immediately draws the attention of Dorn
Hey, what do we have here
Guy looks like a fuckin' toilet brush
Hey, ,  love your pony tail
And the earring's cute too
Where's the matching bracelet
Vaughn whips a hard glance at Dorn, but keeps on walking, making his way along the bunks looking for his assigned bed
It's the one above Taylor
Vaughn unloads his duffel bag in silence
(offering his hand) Jake Taylor
Vaughn shakes it and nods
Says nothing
So, you just gonna settle for toilet brush, or you got another name
Vaughn
Rick Vaughn
Forget about Dorn
He's always a little tough on rookies
You'll get a lot worse from other teams
The conversation is interrupted by the arrival of Hayes
Say hey
How ya doin'
Willie Mays Hayes here
Jake Taylor
(pointing to Vaughn) Rick Vaughn
Hayes doesn't quite know what to make of Vaughn
What the hell league you been playin' in
California Penal
Never heard of it
How'd you wind up playin' there
stole a car
On Hayes' look, we
: - It's dark
Everyone's asleep
Three   with flashlights come down to the top bunk where Hayes is sleeping
This guy wasn't invited to camp
They lift the bunk out of its slots and carry it out the door, Hayes still asleep on it
- The players are dressing out in their uniforms for the first day of practice
Vaughn goes in his locker and finds that a slit has been cut in the back of his cap to accommodate his pigtail
Suppressed laughs are heard from several corners of the locker room
- Brown is addressing his troops before the first workout
Welcome to Spring Training, gentlemen
Most managers tell you at this time that all the jobs are open, that nobody's a lock at any position, and that talent isn't everything
They'd rather see desire and discipline in a player
Then they tell you that most of all they want you to have fun out there, even though they're gonna work your ass off on fundamentals and condition you till you drop
The difference between me and those other managers is
(pause) mean it
On a locker room full of uneasy faces, we
: - Hayes' cot is sitting in the lot, just outside the fence, his suitcase set down next to it
Hayes is still asleep, dew on his forehead
Wakened by the noise of activity on the field, he sits up with a start
Shit,  been cut already
We pick up Taylor sprinting his ass off in a 100-yard time trial, staggering across the finish line 10 feet behind Cerrano
(checking stopwatch) 11
9 Taylor
Not bad if you'd fallen down
As Taylor tries to catch his breath, Dorn and a relief pitcher named Gant approach the starting line for the next trial
looking through the chain-link fence surrounding the field
Temple brings them to their marks and blows his whistle
Dorn and Gentry take off
Suddenly Hayes, in his pajamas and bare feet comes streaking toward the starting line in hot pursuit
Dorn and Gentry a good 10-yard lead, but Hayes is coming like a bullet
We go to   as Hayes draws even at the 80-yard mark and blasts on by to win by five
This kid is fast
Brown and Pepper give each other the "Who was that Masked Man" look
Get him a uniform
-   - The players are spread out on the field doing calisthenics, counting off in unison
struggling through a series of pushups
He glances over in disbelief at Vaughn and Cerrano, who are doing them like pistons in competition with each other
Cerrano even starts doing them one-handed
Hayes isn't doing them at all; merely pulling his head up and down while leaving his body on the ground
'mon, Hayes, let's do 'em right
Hey, my philosophy is no pain, no pain
- Taylor is crouched behind the plate, warming up his arm
Catching pitches and throwing them half-speed down to second
Brown drifts over
How the knees holdin' up, Jake
Great
Never been better
Mobility's good
No problem gettin' off the throw to second
No problem
need a catcher, Jake
Somebody who can keep this team together on the field
You were a helluva player when you were sound, but around the league they think you can't take the pounding anymore
Around the league they're wrong
'm gonna have to put you to the test, ya know
So,  want the absolute truth here
Are you 100 percent
Yeh
Would  bullshit about somethin' like that
(walking away) You better if you wanna make this team
Taylor smiles and fires one full-speed down to second
It bounces two feet in front of the bag
- Brown is watching batting practice
Hayes steps into the cage and begins a preparatory ritual worthy of Babe Ruth -- rubbing dirt on his hands, stretching, knocking dirt off his spikes, twirling the bat, etc
real slugger's routine
'mon, Hayes, this isn't the All Star Game
Get up to the damn plate
Hayes gets in and takes his stance
On the first pitch, he takes a mighty cut and hits a pop-fly to the pitcher's mound
We take   of the next three pitches
Hayes takes prodigious swings at all of them, producing three more pop- ups, none out of the infield
Brown calls a halt
Well, you may run like Mays, but you hit like shit
My stroke'll come back once  get warmed up
(referring to some stats) Never did get warmed up last year
Hit
211 at Maine
looked him up
think Mr
Hayes shows some promise
His speed could be a big asset
(aside) For what
Running back to the dugout
You gotta stop swingin' for the fences though, Hayes
All you're gonna do is give yourself a hernia
With your speed you should be hittin' the ball on the ground, leggin' 'em out
Every time  see you hit one in the air, you owe me twenty pushups
Hey, no problem
The next pitch comes in
Hayes swings and pops it up
Shit
As he gets down to do his twenty, Brown turns to Temple
Sometimes you can teach a guy to hit
You can't teach him to run
coming over to where Vaughn is tossing some casual warm-up pitches to Jake
All right, Vaughn, they tell us you're a pitcher
Let's see what you got
Brown and Pepper stand behind Taylor for a better view
Vaughn goes into his wind-up and fires a screaming fast ball that Taylor has no chance to get out of his crouch to catch
The ball rockets an inch over Brown's head, and slams into the backstop
Brown stands frozen a second, contemplating his brush with eternity, then turns to Pepper
Nice velocity
Sounded like it
Sorry, Lou,  wasn't quite expectin' that much octane
Brown turns to the Clubhouse Man who's holding a speed gun
How much
96 miles an hour
(to Pepper) Better teach him some control before he kills somebody
fielding grounders at third base
He plays them off to his left side a bit, almost as if he's afraid to get bit by them
'mon, Dorn, get in front of the damn ball
(making like a bullfighter) Don't give me this ole' bullshit
took one of these in the eye last year
Nearly lost my sight
'm deeply moved
Every time you play it off your hip, you give me forty sit-ups
What
That's Little League shit
So is this
Brown strikes an effeminate fielding position, like Betty Grable shying from a mouse
Dorn burns
in the batting cage, knocking the cover off pitch after pitch with his black bat
Jesus, this guy hits a ton
How come nobody else picked up on him
(to the batting practice pitcher) Okay, Harris, that's enough fast balls
Throw some curves
Harris winds and throws a fair-to-middlin' curve ball
Cerrano swings and misses it a foot
Oh
Dorn approaches Brown at the cage
Lou,  wanna have a word with you here
Sure
(whipping out his contract) Those penalty sit-ups you want me to do
got it right here in my contract that  don't have to do any calisthenics  don't feel are necessary
What do ya think of that
Everyone around the batting cage has stopped what they're doing to see how Brown will react
Brown looks at the contract a second, then drops it on the ground, unzips his fly, and gives it a golden shower
On Dorn's stunned face, we
: doing sit-ups in the infield
Vaughn walks by and smiles
- Practically every member of the team is doing penalty calisthenics somewhere on the field
(to Temple) We got anybody left playin' baseball out there
- Taylor, Hayes and Vaughn drag in, looking beat from the day's workout
Shit, the way  played today, wouldn't be surprised if they red- tagged me already
What do ya mean
Red tag in your locker means the manager wants to see you, 'cause you just died and went to the minors
Vaughn's hand freezes on his locker latch, afraid to open it now
Don't worry, they don't cut anybody the first day
Vaughn is still not so sure
He sits down on his locker stool and glances over toward   a starting pitcher, whose locker is adjacent
As Harris takes off his jersey we see three     on his chest, just inside the button line
What is that stuff
(pointing to them in order) Crisco, Bardahl, Vagisil
Any one of 'em will give you another 2-3 inches drop on your curve ball
Vaughn can't believe this
Course if it's cold and  got a shirt on under my jersey,  just rub a little jalapeno inside my nose and get it runnin'
need to load up the ball a little,  just wipe my nose
(revolted) You put snot on the ball
At my age, you put anything you can find on it
haven't got an arm like yours
Vaughn just looks at him incredulous
Taylor is undressing, but his attention is diverted by Cerrano whose stall is right next to him
Cerrano has set up an altar in his locker
In front of his bats, which are lined up like sentinels, is a table covered with pictures of baseball players, figurines of saints, several lit candles and, in the middle, a primitive fetish doll with a cigar in its mouth
Cerrano has drawn some magic signs on his bats
He finishes an incantation and then lights the cigar on the fetish doll
What are you doin' there, Pedro
Bats
They are sick
So are mine
Is somethin' goin' around
No hit curve ball
Straight ball, hit it very much
Curve ball, bats are afraid
ask Jo-Buu to come
Take fear from bats
Jo-Buu
Maybe he's the pagan saint of baseball
offer him cigars and gin
He will come
Cerrano pours some gin in a small cup and puts it next to the fetish doll
Harris has been listening to all this
Cerrano grabs a towel to head for the showers
wouldn't leave this gin sittin' around out here with this group
(with a certain gravity) Is very bad to steal Jo-Buu's gin
Is very bad
Cerrano closes his locker and goes off to the showers, leaving everyone to wonder just how bad
Sequence omitted from original script
compressing and detailing the progress of spring training
We see: ) Vaughn on the pitcher's mound
tin replica of a batter has been set up at home plate and rope stretched across the plate to delineate the strike zone
Vaughn fires a pitch and hits the tin batter in the hip, leaving a dent in him
) Cerrano in the batting cage, flailing away in futility at several curve balls
) doing push-ups at night
He's the only one left on the field, except Temple, who supervises
) doing the "scramble" drill -- blocking down balls purposely thrown in the dirt, one after another
When it ends, he can hardly get to his feet

No red tag greets him
Hayes watches from a safe distance

The tin batter is dented in every conceivable place now
Vaughn whips in another fast ball

Jake springs out of his crouch and fires down to second -- on a bounce
The ball skips into center field

He just drops in his tracks and starts to do push-ups as the catcher makes the catch behind him
) flailing away again at a curve ball
This and the remaining shots are all in exhibition games
) waving a ten-inch garter snake in front of his locker
Even at this size we can tell it scares the hell out of him, but it works its magic
No red tag

The run scores
) attempting to steal second
He goes into a hell-bent-for- leather head first slide
Unfortunately, he comes up two feet short of the base
The second baseman, who's waiting for him with the ball, makes a motion for him to keep coming
Hayes flips him the bird
) on the bench
He turns to Pepper with a look that says, "Can you believe this shit
" ) waiting for a throw at the plate
Just as he's about to catch it, the runner knocks him flat
) his head in his hands
As Taylor gets up and goes to the wrong dugout, the
'   - Players are filing off the team bus after the game
We Taylor, Hayes and Vaughn as they head toward the locker room
This is final cut down day, right
Yeh, better get your snake ready, Hayes
No, 'm goin' cold turkey today
My hands are too screwed up to hold it anyway
Hayes reveals a pair of red and cut hands
If you're gonna use that head first slide, you better get yourself some gloves or you're not gonna have any skin left on your hands
They've reached the locker room now
don't wanna go in there
Whatever happens, keep it to yourself until you're outta the locker room
Don't celebrate in front of guys who just died
What if we're one of the deceased
Taylor goes into the locker room
Hayes and Vaughn hang back
Cerrano is already at his locker
He's got two snakes this time and some kind of voodoo head dress on
He sprays a patch of white paint on the locker door from a spray can, draws a symbol door
No tag
He kisses the snake, leaving some white paint on his lips, like a kid who's just had a glass of milk
Taylor, exhausted from the game, lifts his latch and peers inside
He's made it, too
Cerrano offers a hand
Taylor shakes it and breaks a weary smile
opens locker, slumps on stool
He's a goner
the two rookies, are still hanging back
'mon, Vaughn, let's show some nuts here
If they cut us, we'll just sign with the Yankees
Hayes strides manfully to his locker and pulls it open
This doesn't tell him much, however, because he's got his eyes closed
He stands that way a beat ot two, then opens one eye
Seeing no tag, he turns and walks double-time out of the locker room, as if he had to get to the john
He comes outside, turns a corner, and starts leaping around like a wild man
drawing strength from Hayes, walks resolutely to his locker and whips it open
There hanging from the top hook is the "red death
" Vaughn stares at it expressionless, then slowly closes his locker
: '  - Vaughn goes right in without knocking and leans on Brown's desk
got news for you, Mr
Brown
You haven't heard the last of me
You think 'm shit now, but someday you'll be sorry you cut me
'm gonna catch on somewhere else, and every time pitch against you, 'm gonna stick it up your ass
Good,  like that kinda spirit in a player
The only problem is,  didn't cut you
What do you mean
think somebody's been havin' fun with you
We   Vaughn, his faced a mask of anger and embarrassment
Vaughn charges across the room and jumps Dorn
The men grapple and fight all over the room, until Taylor finally gets them separated
(to Vaughn) What's the matter, little lady
Can't you take a joke
Vaughn gives Dorn a look that indicates this isn't over
Lou Brown enters the room
Can  have your attention, please counted up your ballots for team captain and  think you chose the right guy
If you hadn't,  woulda told you he won anyway
Mr
for the year -- Jake Taylor
The team breaks into applause and whistles as Taylor's name is announced
Dorn is the only one who seems unhappy about it
As Taylor accepts the congratulations of his teammates, he turns to Vaughn
Forget about Dorn
You got other things to do
Like what
Packing for Cleveland
Taylor gives him a wide smile
Vaughn finally allows himself one
: - Such as it is
We   to the same diner we saw during the opening of the film
- The same three guys as before are at the counter
You see the new lineup the Indians got
never heard of most of 'em
- The Business Executive is talking to the limo driver as he reads the sports section
don't know the majority of these names
- The two Longshoremen again, looking at a paper
Who are these fuckin' guys
- The two Korean Groundskeepers again, dragging the infield
(in subtitles) They're shitty
- Taylor is alone in the stadium, standing near home plate in his street clothes, taking in the massive stadium, remembering glories past
He steps into the batter's box and takes his stance
(to himself) Two down
Bottom of the ninth
Taylor points to the left field stands
He imagines a pitch coming in, takes a mighty swing and admires the flight of the imaginary ball as it arches high in the mid-day sky, landing deep in the left field seats
Breaking into his home run trot, he circles the bases, slapping the third base coach's hand and exchanging low fives with his teamates as he reaches the plate
Suddenly, his reverie is interrupted by the sound of applause
He turns and looks in the dugout, where Hayes and Vaughn are giving him a hand
Really got all of that one
What was it
slider
Taylor is too embarrassed to reply
- One of Cleveland's finest
Taylor, Hayes and Vaughn are seated at a table
What are you gonna have
don't know
What language is this
French
They got patty melts over there
Forget it
'll order
Let's have a toast
The three raise their wine glasses
Here's to baseball, here's to the start of two great careers, and for me, here's to at least one more good year in the sun
The glasses
Suddenly Taylor's attention fixes on something across the room -- a stunning young woman in her late twenties,
She's having dinner with a in a three-piece suit
Hayes and Vaughn follow Taylor's eyes to the woman
What is it
The chick
That's my wife
Does she know it
mean she woulda been if  hadn't screwed it up
Who's that guy she's with
don't know
He's not wearing a name tag
You want me to beat the shit out of him
No
What does she do
She's a librarian
librarian
Shit,  gotta start readin' again
- approaches the table where Lynn and her date are sharing a dessert
Miss Wells, there's a telephone call for you
Lynn is somewhat surprised, but gets up to take the call
We her to the pay phone in the hall
Hello
Hello, Lynn
It's Jake
Jake
How did you know  was here
Just a hunch
took you there when you got your masters
figure you're probably wearing the black velvet dress with the red sash
She is indeed
Lynn is a little unsettled by this display of clairvoyance
How did you know that
didn't have this dress when we were
Sensing that something's askew, she turns and looks across the way to see Jake talking to her on the pay phone on the other side of the hall, maybe ten feet away
He gives her his best grin
You look great
Lynn, as is often the case with Jake, is both charmed and put-out
She goes with put-out
Thanks
What are you doin' here
Aren't you supposed to be in Mexico somewhere
'm playin' with the Indians again
Back in the Bigs
That's great
'm happy for you, Jake
And she is
Not so sure about herself, though
(starting away) gotta get back
Wait a minute
What's your number tried calling you at home, but you're not listed
My life is different from when you knew me
Meaning what
That  don't know you anymore
Couldn't we talk about this some other time
really gotta
Okay, just gimme your number
don't think that's a good idea
Why not
Because of the guy you're with
What is he, a banker
Lawyer
Please, Jake, he's watching us
'm not leavin' without your number
You still wear those great little tortoise-shell glasses
always loved it when you took them off
(exasperated) Jake
The number, Lynn
(reluctant) All right
555-9314
Thank you
'm back, Lynn, and 'm gonna be around
She looks at him a beat, unsure what to say, then heads back toward her table
We go to Lynn's date
None of this has been lost on him
- Taylor, Hayes and Vaughn are the fares
What's the number again
(looking at a piece of paper) 1036
What is this place
Furnished apartment building owned by the Indians
We get special rates
With what we're makin' we'll need it
The Cabbie pulls to a stop and points to the other side of the street
That's it
Taylor and the others turn to see a dismal, run-down building with a neon sign that says "The Turk
" Welcome to the Big Leagues
- Jake goes to a pay phone in the hall and dials the number Lynn gave him
Hello, Cuyahoga Sheet Metal
Taylor doesn't like the sound of this
You got anybody workin' there named Lynn Wells
Never heard of her
Didn't think so
Taylor hangs up, staring off into space
'   - Various players are dressing out for the game
We Cerrano putting on his undergarments
They're all black, including his jock
Dorn reads the Wall Street Journal, while Taylor sits on the trainer's table getting his knees taped
Hayes checks the fit of his new uniform from every angle in a mirror
He thinks he looks pretty good
Vaughn just squeezes a baseball in his left hand, obviously a little uptight
Taylor gives him a chuck on the shoulder
Take it easy
We got 162 of these to go
Lou Brown enters the locker room
All right, let's gather 'round
The players turn their attention to Brown
'm not much for inspirational addresses
just wanta point out that every newspaper in the country has picked us to finish last
The local press thinks we'd save everybody a lot of time and trouble if we just went out and shot ourselves
Me, like to waste sportswriters' time so 'm for hangin' around and seein' if we can give all these guys a nice big shitburger to eat
Cheers all around
Aren't we gonna have a prayer mean we're not all savages like Cerrano
You guys go ahead
belong to the church of three-run homers
All right, let's bow our heads
Many of the players follow suit
Suddenly the silence is shattered by a loud explosive , scaring the hell out of everybody
All eyes turn to Cerrano, who has just set off a charge of gunpowder on his locker altar
Have to wake up bats
Disgusted, Harris and the others turn back to their prayers
Dear Lord, we ask
Harris never gets to finish
The smoke rising from Cerrano's gunpowder explosion sets off the automatic sprinklers in the ceiling
As Harris and the faithful look up into the downpour, we
: - The stands are nearly empty
Of the fans who have showed up, many wear doormats around their necks
Bobby, Vic, Johnny and Thelma, our four fans from the diner, sit alone in the vast expanse of the centerfield bleachers
All four wear Indian head dresses and have war paint on their faces
The three men each have tom-toms
Thelma works on her needlepoint
You read the Plain Dealer today
They said this is gonna be the worst Indian team we've had in years
Everybody laughs at the Indians now, but there were other times
Even won the Series in '48
Then Willie Mays made that catch on Vic Wertz in the '54 Series and Cleveland's never been the same since
As the Indians go so goes Cleveland, huh
If we ever lost the Indians, Cleveland would die
- We get our fist glimpse of  , the Indians' 55-year- old radio announcer
Harry's never walked past a bar in anger
He's been with the Indians through thin and thinner
(on the air) Hello, everybody, Harry Doyle here, welcoming all you Friends of the Feather to another season of Indians baseball
(pouring some Jack Daniels in his Coke) lotta new faces for the tribe this year, as they take on the defending American League champs, the New York Yankees
And listen to the roar of the crowd as the Indians takes the field
Doyle leans out the press box window with his mike, trying to pick up the sound of a couple guys  down below
Yes, sir, they love this club here in Cleveland
Doyle takes a hit of his spiked Coke
flies out to Hayes, who makes a "basket" catch a la Willie Mays
(
) High fly ball, centerfield
Hayes under it now
Oh, makes a basket catch, Willie Mays style, and the side is retired
The team comes in off the field to much enthusiasm and back- slapping
All right, way to look, way to look
Nice catch, Hayes
Don't ever fuckin' do it again
Okay, let's get it goin'
Bottom of the first, Willie Mays Hayes to lead it off for the tribe
going through his warmup routine at the plate
(
) lotta people say you can tell how a season's gonna go by the first hitter of the year
In the last fifteen years, the Indians have never had the season lead-off hitter reach base
Hayes is in the batter's box now
The Yankee pitcher winds and fires
Hayes swings and hits a little dribbler toward the second baseman, who races in and scoops it up bare-handed
(
) Hot shot toward the hole
Rudia knocks it down, gets up, fires to first
Too late
Hayes beats it
Doyle leans out the window again trying to pick up some cheering
And so the string is broken
Maybe things will turn around a little for the Indians this year
Our four fans (from here on known as the Bleacher Band), overjoyed by Hayes' hit, start beating the tom-toms and singing a fight song they've composed called "In the Land Of Burning Waters" to the tune of the old Hamms Beer jingle
In the land of burning waters, waters Lurks the Injun nine, oh so fine, we Love those mighty Redmen, Turn their foes to dead men, Ummmmm
as Hayes comes back to the bag, where the Yankee is waiting for him
Showed some real power on that one, Slugger
plan to get at least a double out of it
Hayes reaches in his back pocket and pulls out one of the pairs of black leather gloves he bought earlier
(
) And now Hayes is putting on a pair of black gloves, sending a little message to the Yankees
(to the First Baseman) Bought a hundred of these, one for each base  plan to steal
Excuse me, here,  gotta take my first step toward the Hall of Fame
Hayes takes his lead-off and crouches, ready to steal
You look real sharp, but you'll never steal second with your shoe untied
Hayes looks down at his shoe
It's not untied
He notices too late that the  is throwing over to pick him off
(
) Brewster, quick move to first
Hayes dives back for the bag, but never gets there; his face smashing up against the First Baseman's glove, which is already holding the ball
(
) He got him
Hayes is picked off
Nice base running, dildo
Hard to get your thumb out of your ass with the gloves on
Hayes lies in the dust humiliated
Well, so much for that
Doyle takes a long pull on his Coke and we depicting the Indians' progressive disintegration in this game
We see: )   converging on a short pop fly into left field
They all collide and go down in a heap as the ball drops untouched
)  playing a grounder off his hip
He fumbles it, picks it up, fumbles it again
No play
)  crouched behind the plate, but up off his haunches, ready to throw
We hear the voice of his thoughts
' Guy's goin'
Gotta be goin'
get the throw up
Don't bounce the damn ball
The runner on first takes off as the pitch comes in
Taylor catches the ball and fires down to second
The ball sails three feet over the second baseman's head and on into center field
Taylor stands there, disgusted
' Nice throw, dickhead
)  striking out on a curve ball
He bawls his bat out on the way to the dugout
)    we saw before, converging on another pop fly into short left
This time all three dive off at the last instant to avoid a collision
Once again the ball drops untouched
It shows Yankees 4, Indians 0 after five innings
There are two empty Coca-Cola cups near the mike
He's working on a third
Top of the sixth
Rookie sensation, Ricky Vaughn, on to pitch now
You can close the book on Winters
Vaughn stands on the mound rubbing up the baseball with the same intensity we saw in the locker room
Easy does it, Ricky
We're only four down
We're still in this thing
Don't worry if you're off the plate on a few pitches
Doesn't hurt to put the fear of God in a hitter
Vaughn nods and continues to grind the ball as Pepper and Taylor leave
The Yankee Hitter steps in
Vaughn winds and fires a screamer
Taylor has to leap high to come down with it
(
) First pitch is a little high
The Yankee Hitter is slightly unnerved by this pitch
This guy kinda wild
figure you got a 30% chance to survive this at bat
to the Yankee hitter
It's outside
(
) Ball four
to a
It's low
(
) Ball eight
to a
He has to jump over it
(
) Low, and Vaughn has walked the bases loaded on twelve straight pitches
By the laws of probability, you'd think one of those coulda drifted over the plate
Bobby gives the downbeat and, in honor of Vaughn, the three men stand to pound out a version of "Wild Thing" on the tom- toms
Bobby does the vocal
Wild thing, You make my heart sing, You walk everything
Pepper has reached the mound
Okay kid
think we got 'em scared enough now
Time to get a few of 'em out
Vaughn nods
He's plenty upset with himself
Just relax, and keep the arm up on top
Gotta throw strikes
No place at the inn for this guy
He gives Vaughn a pat on the butt, and goes back to the dugout
The Yankee hitter, , stands in
He's the first baseman who tagged Hayes out
Hey, Taylor, what you doin' back up here
Couldn't cut it in the Mexican League
Vaughn, determined to throw a strike, winds and delivers
The ball is a perfect strike, right down the middle
Haywood crushes it to deep left field
Vaughn drops his head, not even bothering to look
Oh, shit
The ball lands in the second deck; a grand slam home run
(to Brown) Looked like a strike anyway
You want me to go get him
No, let's see how he reacts
Vaughn paces around on the mound, rubbing up the ball
The next hitter, , steps in
Vaughn gets up on the rubber, his face set
He winds up and fires one right into Coleman's back
Coleman goes down in a hurry
Interesting
At least he hit what he was aimin' at
think you can go get him now
Both benches are up on the dugout steps ready to come out
The only thing holding them back is that Coleman is being tended to by the trainer
The home plate umpire thumbs Vaughn out of the game
Vaughn comes down to protest, but Pepper quickly grabs him and hurries him off the field
'mon, kid
As soon as Coleman gets up, he's gonna be lookin' for you
Coleman finally gets to his feet, still a little shaken
He looks around for Vaughn, but he's already disappeared into the dugout
Coleman walks down to first under his own power
Brown signals for a new pitcher and the players on both sides begin to return to the benches
walking alone down the tunnel to the locker room
He angrily knocks one of the overhead light bulbs out with his glove
- He now has five empty cups next to the mike, plus a near- empty bottle of Jack Daniel's
So, a tough start for the Erie warriors, as they drop a heartbreaker to the Yankees, nine to nothing
The Post Game Show was brought to you by
(searching for the paper) Christ
can't find it
The hell with it
This is Harry Doyle saying good night, everybody, and Happy Hunting
With that Doyle passes out on his face
in her private box at the stadium
With her are Donovan and Butler
(getting up to leave) We're off to a good start, gentlemen
Let's keep it up
We   Donovan
He watches Rachel go in disgust
- Taylor, Hayes and Vaughn are in a booth, having a beer
Vaughn is still in a funk
God,  was horse shit tonight
Only thing you got to be sorry about was hittin' Coleman
What
If you wanted to send a message, it shoulda been to Haywood
He hit the damn homer
Coleman was just picking his nose in the on-deck circle
Vaughn nods slowly
Forget the other stuff
It coulda happened to anybody
Besides, Haywood didn't hit it that good
That ball wouldn't have been out of a lotta parks
Oh yeh, name one
(after a pause) Yellowstone
Vaughn just looks at Taylor a second and then smiles in spite of himself
Shit
- We see Taylor walking up the steps and through the massive front door
- We   Taylor making his way past the circulation desk
He glances around and finds what he's looking for: Lynn, talking to one of the reference librarians
She finishes her conversation and turns, to find herself face to face with Taylor
She's wearing her tortoise-shell glasses
(hushed) Jake, you shouldn't have come here
was wonderin' why you'd give an old friend a bum phone number
Let's talk in my office, okay
don't wanna talk in your office
Lynn starts to walk
We'll  them as they make their way through the library
Lynn tries to keep the conversation hushed
Taylor could give a shit
told you  don't think it's a good idea for us to see each other
Why not
We don't have anything in common
Sometimes  wonder if we ever did
What are you talkin' about
We were both athletes, world class, hot for each other
What more can you have in common
stopped bein' an athlete three years ago
Books are my life now
Jake suppresses a smile
Don't you dare laugh, Jake
In two years 've put together one of the best special collections departments in the country
So what is it
You're still sore never read Moby Dick
You never read anything  asked you to
Not like what's-his-name at the restaurant
His name is Tom, and keep your voice down
What do ya see in this guy
He's stable
He's intelligent
and 've never found him in bed with a stewardess
That's 'cause no stewardess would have him
Wouldn't you rather be with somebody who's in demand
Just like always, you don't take anything seriously
Everything's a joke to you
'mon, Lynn, for Christ sake, 'm just tryin' to loosen things up a little
'm gettin' frostbite here
Lynn stops and turns to face him
Tom and  are getting married in the fall
Taylor is momentarily floored by the revelation
What
That's crazy, Lynn
got plans for us
(walking again) What plans
was gonna play another a year or two, then we go to Hawaii, and have a couple kids who grow up to be Olympic champions
(stopping again) How can you think stuff like that haven't seen you in two years
You never even wrote me a letter
'm sorry, Lynn, but  wasn't exactly proud of my situation
'mon, you didn't think about me at all since been gone
(walking again) Not so loud, Jake
Remember the three nights we spent on the beach in Vera Cruz
You have nights like that with Mr
Briefcase
(stopping again) What about the night you had in Detroit with Miss Dairy Queen
They're in the large reading room now
What was  supposed to do
She bet me fifty bucks she had a better body than you
had to defend your honor
(whirling on him and exploding) What a bunch of bullshit
(exasperated) have a much better body than she does
With this the whole reading room turns around and stares at her
Lynn is mortified by her outburst
Taylor tries to smooth it over
(addressing the library patrons) She's right
Take it from me, she really does
mean Miss Dairy Queen has quantity,  give her that, but the, ah, quality just isn't there
Nice job, Jake
Lynn is still mortified
How many think Lynn oughta give me another shot
Most of the hands in the room shoot up
The ayes have it
(walking off again) You haven't changed at all, have you
'm afraid  have or  wouldn't be here
'mon, Lynn,  don't wanna do time for things that happened years ago
(turning back to him) 'm sorry, Jake
You'll always be the little boy who wouldn't grow up
Lynn starts off for her office door
Lynn, wait
Lynn continues on into her office
As the door closes, we Taylor's forlorn face
'  - Rachel is in closed-door session with Donovan
quarter of the season's gone, we're 15 and 24, seven games out of first
Our attendance is just below 180,000
That's bad, but not bad enough
Projected over the whole season, we stand to wind up 36 games under
500 and 28 out of first
That should be bad enough for anybody
We finished 24 out last year and still drew 890,000
When school's out for the summer, attendance is liable to rise
Plus, this team is showing signs of improvement
didn't think we'd win 15 games all year
Any ideas
On how we can get worse
(sarcastic) How about a series of fines for good play
Maybe a $30,000 bonus to the guy chosen Least Valuable Player
This is no laughing matter, Donovan
(pause) think maybe the problem is we're coddling these guys too much
As Donovan wonders what she means by that, we
: - We   Taylor, Hayes, Vaughn and the other Indians coming down a corridor to their plane
What's with this
We never leave from this terminal
Maybe the other one's jammed up
They come through the gate where they see two American Airlines jets on the tarmac
(pointing to the jets) Which one is ours
That one
The gateman points off-screen
Suddenly, an old -3, with the Indian logo on it, pulls into frame
: -3 - This one was obviously bought from the military
The seats are 40's Army issue, and the ribs of the fuselage are exposed
The plane is bobbing and lurching through a ferocious storm
What is this, Lou
Front office says it's an economy measure, 'cause we're not drawin' good
Well, they certainly have spared every expense
We   Cerrano crossing himself
Harris sees it
Oh, so now you come around
(pointing up) He's not fooled
Hayes sits petrified in his chair, his knuckles whitening on the arm rest
Call the stewardess, Vaughn
need one of those bags
There aren't any stewardesses
wonder if there's any pilots
-   - We   Doyle doing the play-by-play of the Indians' next game
He can barely keep his eyes open
Two down, top of the ninth
Last chance for the red and blue
The Brewer pitcher delivers and a Cleveland player hits a ground ball to the Brewer Second Baseman who throws him out
(
) Bouncing ball to second
This should be it
Collins up with it, on to first, and the game is over
in the press box again
So, the Sons of Geronimo, still suffering a bit from propeller lag, are nipped by the Tigers tonight, 7 to 0
The only excitement for the tribe provided by Rick Vaughn who set an American League record by throwing four wild pitches in one inning
Congratulations, Rick
For the Tigers, 5 runs, 9 hits, and no errors
For the Indians, one run, and let's see, one hit
(to his Stat Man) Is that all we got, one fucking hit
(whispering) You can't say "fuckin'" on the air
Don't worry about it
Nobody's listening anyway
- Dorn and Harris are at one table; Taylor and Vaughn at one across the way
Who you got lined up tonight
Where are we
Kansas City, right
Gotta be Arlene You call her
Don't have to
She knows when 'm in town
'm about ready to turn in
've anesthetized my knees enough
from the bar approaches the table
Excuse me, Mr
Vaughn, can  have your autograph
Ah
yeh
sure
(signing) My first autograph
couldn't give these away a couple weeks ago
saw your record on the news
You made their Hall of Shame
Congratulations
(embarrassed) Thanks
You're a celebrity now, Vaughn
thought you had to do somethin' good to be a celebrity
Not if you do it colorfully
(pointing to the door) What'd  tell ya
We   the door to find  standing with two friends, and
is a looker alright, 27, and seriously built
She cases the room, spies Dorn and comes over to his table
Hi, Rodger
This is Vicki and Rene
Hi, doll
This is Steve Harris
Where's your buddy Gant
(indicating Vaughn) They cut him to make room for bristle boy over there
(looking over at Vaughn) Is that Vaughn, the guy they call Wild Thing
(in disgust) Yeh
He's kinda cute
They say he could be a big star
What are you talkin' about
He couldn't find the plate if it was magnetized
He won't last the year
He struck out five in a row before the wild pitches
(taking her leave) Maybe 'll check him out
(grabbing her) Wait a minute, you're with me
Taylor watches this exchange from across the room
don't remember you makin' any date
Since when do  have to make a date
Who's been showin' you this town the last three years
Ancient history, Rodger
gotta look out for myself now
don't have to be a slave to no
235 hitter
pulls away and heads for the jukebox as Dorn seethes
She punches a button and we hear 's version of "
" sashays right up to Vaughn in time with the music
Wild Thing, you make my heart sing
knows how to make the big entrance
Vaughn's slightly overwhelmed
taking this all in from across the room
Taylor comes up next to him
Guess we're over with, eh, Dorn
Speak for yourself, Taylor
got a couple good years left
' -3 - We   Taylor in his seat, glasses on, reading something by the light of a flashlight rigged up to the back of his seat
We  to reveal it -- the Classics Illustrated comic book of "Moby Dick
" Hayes wanders by, an air-sick bag hanging around his neck
"Moby Dick
" What is that
It's one of the masterpieces of American literature, that's all
Lynn put you on to this
Long time ago
Well, we're goin' to a club tonight
You wanna come along
No,  got some more reading to do
Taylor indicates a stack of Classic Comics next to him
What, you got a test or somethin'
Why don't you just go over and see her
Maybe she'll let you slide on a couple of these
might if  knew where she lives
Easy
Tail her home from the library
You mean sit in a car and wait for her to come out
That's kinda juvenile, don't you think
(as if that had anything to do with it) Yeh
- Taylor sits in his car, across the street from the employee entrance of the library
He scrunches down a bit as Lynn comes out of the building and heads for her car
She gets in and we
: driving through the city with Taylor following at a discrete distance
Finally, Lynn pulls up outside an expensive-looking townhouse
Taylor pulls up further down the street and watches her go inside, debating whether to go in after her
- Taylor's having a beer, still trying to decide whether to go see her or not
pulling up outside the townhouse he saw Lynn go into
He goes up the stairs and knocks on the door
Lynn answers, looking more dressed up than when she left the library
She's surprised to see Taylor
Look, Lynn, 'm sorry  followed you home but  wanna
(hurried) This isn't my place
Whose place is it
Before Lynn can answer, Tom appears at the door
Who's there, love
(spying Taylor) Oh, Mr
Taylor, right
(pointedly) remember you from the restaurant
Lynn's told me a lot about you
Why don't you come in for a while
Nah, that's o
k
,  got some things to do
Yeh, he's gotta be goin'
No, really, come on in for a drink
Before Taylor can beg off further, Tom ushers him inside and closes the door
In the room are two other couples: , a senior partner in Tom's firm and his wife , and  , another lawyer in the firm and a contemporary of Tom's
His wife is
This is a very upscale group
Excuse me, everybody, this is Jake Taylor
(making the intros) Jake, Arthur and Claire Holloway Brent and Janice Bowden
Jake is a professional baseball player
Polite nods from the group, except for Janice, who seems somewhat intrigued
So, Jake, what brings you here this evening
, ah, just had a couple books wanted to discuss with Lynn
thought this was her place
Well, it soon will be
Yeh,  heard you guys were engaged
Congratulations
Taylor sticks out his hand
Tom's not sure whether Taylor's putting him on or not
He shakes anyway
Thank you
What can  get you to drink
Beer'll be fine
Tom goes off to get the beer
What team do you play for, Jake
The Indians
Here in Cleveland
didn't know they still had a team
Yeh, we have uniforms and everything
It's really great
(handing Jake his beer) They're last right now, but hopefully moving up, eh, Jake
Tom clinks his glass with Jake's beer, the slight condescension in his manner not lost on Taylor
Lynn is uncomfortable with this whole situation
Janice moves a bit closer to Taylor
It's obvious she finds him attractive
'm told that baseball players make very good salaries these days
That depends on how good they are, guess
How good are you
Lynn is irritated by Janice's directness
make the League minimum
Tom and the others react as if Taylor's just announced a death in the family
He was one of the best in baseball until he had problems with his knees
Everyone is somewhat surprised by Lynn's quick defense of Taylor, including Lynn herself
What are you going to do when your career ends
mean you can't play baseball forever, can you
Somethin'll come up
Will it
don't know,  was thinkin' of goin' to Hawaii, and having a couple of kids who grow up to be Olympic champions
Oh really
In what event
Swimming
Maybe the two hundred meter Individual Medley
figure it oughta be big by then
Jack just nods
He never heard of it
You got the girl picked out
did, but  wasn't smart enough to hold on to her
Lynn's eyes drop to the floor
You used to be an athlete, didn't you, Lynn
(not wanting to pursue it) Yes
What did you do
(reluctant) Two Hundred Individual medley
Alternate on the '80 Olympic Team
tense silence settles on the group
Well,  gotta be goin'
Nice to have met you all
Taylor exchanges a quick glance with Lynn and heads for the door
Let me walk you out
Tom accompanies Taylor to the door, out of earshot of the others
Thanks for the beer
Don't mention it
'll let you know if  land a good job
know you're concerned about it
Yeh, well,  just wanted Lynn to know what she would've had ahead of her
Tom sticks out his hand
The two men shake to keep up appearances for their onlookers across the room
Stay away from her
(smiling) Suck my dick
'  - Vaughn and Hayes are watching a soap opera on an old black and white
Pepper pops his head in
Lou wants to see you down at the office, Rick
Vaughn looks somewhat apprehensively at Hayes
'  - Brown is lost in thought at his desk
Vaughn appears at the door like a boy expecting a spanking
'mon in, Rick
Vaughn comes in and takes a seat
He's worried
Rick, 'm not gonna beat around the bush here
You got a great arm, one of the best 've ever seen, but your control hasn't come around like we hoped it would
Vaughn nods contritely
Now, there are a lotta pitchers that started out wild and, after workin' it out in the minors, for a while, went on to great careers
(pointing to a picture on the wall) Take Sandy Koufax there
Vaughn looks at the picture on the wall
He squints slightly
Brown notices it
What about Koufax
Never mind Koufax
Brown quickly prints some big letters on a legal pad and goes to stand about fifteen feet from Vaughn
Read these letters, starting at the top
Vaughn balks a second and then concentrates on the pad, squinting
Unsettled, he squints harder
He even tries closing one eye
Can't read it, can you
Vaughn shakes his head no
You gonna send me to the minors
Nope
: Sequence omitted from original script
- Taylor, Hayes, Vaughn and the others are dressing out for the game
Vaughn is wearing his glasses
These things make me look ridiculous
Drop in the bucket, Vaughn
Meanwhile, Cerrano is sharpening a long knife at his locker
What's that for
Gin and cigarettes not enough for Jo- Buu
still can no hit curva ball for sheet
hafta make a sacrifice to him
Sacrifice
You mean like something living
Si
kill unborn children
Not while 'm here you're not
That's murder
Cerrano pulls the unborn chicken out of his pocket -- a common store bought egg
Harris is a little embarrassed at his outburst
Cerrano touches the egg to his forehead, then places it on his altar
In one swift motion he slams the knife down on it, cutting it into two perfect halves
Taylor and the others are agape at a knife sharp enough to do this
As the yolk spreads out on the altar, Brown emerges from his office
All right, let's hit the field
The locker room quickly empties, leaving one man behind -- Harris
He looks around to make sure everyone is gone, then tiptoes over to Cerrano's locker
Screwing up his courage, he picks up Jo-Buu's cup of gin
Here's looking at ya, Jo-Buu
He bolts it down, then backs into the middle of the room, waiting at the ready, as if half-expecting a bolt of lightning
When nothing happens, he gloats at the fetish doll in triumph
strutting out of the dugout, feeling like a million bucks
As he emerges onto the field, a Hitter in the batting cage swings and misses, the bat slipping out of his hands
Away it flies, whirling off down the third base line in a wide arc
It hits Harris in the back of the head and knocks him cold
: watching the game from the dugout, a zip-lock baggie full of ice-cubes strapped to his head
(
) We're in the ninth, two down, man on first and the Indians clinging to a one run lead
, one out away from his first major league victory
Sequence omitted from original script
Vaughn, wearing his new glasses, paces the mound nervously
He goes to the rosin bag, wipes his brow, shakes out his arm
Finally up on the rubber, he gets the sign from Taylor, goes to his stretch, checks the runner and fires to the plate
swings and hits a grounder between third and short
Dorn moves to his left, but the ball goes past his glove and into left field
There is some question as to whether Dorn really gave it a full effort
(
) Bouncing ball, Dorn can't get to it, into left field, base hit
Clarke digging around second, he'll make it to third, and the 's have runners at the corners
Vaughn stomps around on the mound, obviously upset
He glares at Dorn a beat before getting back on the mound
Dorn's face is non-commital
Brown paces in the dugout
You want me to go get him
No, he's come this far
Let's see if he can finish it
Doyle downs a little more rum and coke in the press box
Vaughn in a little trouble here, but 'll tell ya, these Cleveland fans are great
Listen to them get behind Vaughn
Doyle imitates the sound of a crowd cheering with his own voice, punctuated by whistles and clapping
Thelma calmly knits her blanket with the scores of all the Indians' games stitched into it, the Madame La Farge of Cleveland
The boys, however, are a little restless
We need some defense here
Maybe we oughta do a wave
'mon, Indians don't do waves
Let's keep this thing pure
What harm could it do
The next Oakland hitter, steps in
Taylor flashes a sign
Vaughn comes to the stretch and delivers
High, ball one
The runner on first goes down to second without a throw, the pitch being too tough to handle
(
) Runner goes, high, Taylor has no play
The go-ahead and potential winning run is in scoring position
Taylor walks out in front of the plate to throw the ball back to Vaughn
Forget the runners, Ricky, get this guy at the plate
Taylor goes back behind the dish
Vaughn gets up on the rubber
He winds and comes to the plate
Way high this time
High ball two, and the crowd doesn't like that call one bit
Doyle imitates the sound of a crowd booing
Taylor, meanwhile, has gone out to the mound
Okay, let's get nasty here, Rick
You know he's lookin' for this pitch
Gotta come up with somethin' studly
Fuckin' Dorn
Game shoulda been over by now
Dorn coulda had that ball
He tanked it on purpose
This isn't the California Penal League, Vaughn
We're professionals here
We don't tank a play for personal reasons, so cut the crybaby shit
You've pitched a helluva game
You wanna finish it, don't ya
Vaughn nods
Can you give me a strike on this pitch
Yeh, but  don't know if there'll be much on it
My arm feels like jello
Just make sure it's over the plate
want him to swing
The last time  did that, the guy hit one that hasn't landed yet
Don't worry, 'll take care of it
Taylor starts back toward the plate, and then stops
By the way,  been meaning to ask you
Why'd you steal that car
was bored
Next time you might think about takin' in a movie or somethin'
Vaughn permits himself a little smile and release from the tension
Taylor smiles back, and trots off toward the plate
Bobby and Vic are doing a two-man wave
When one sits down, the other stands up
has settled in behind the plate now
He starts talking to the batter, Rexman
Helluva situation we got goin' here, huh, Rexman
Two on, two out, you're down by a run in the ninth
You got a chance to be a hero on national television, so whatever you do, don't blow it
They'll be callin' you a gutless choke artist all over America
Rexman shoots Taylor a wicked glance
You're a free agent at the end of the year
Not much demand for gutless choke artists
What are you hittin' now
230
240
316
Hey, nice average
Uh oh, on second thought, that still means you got a seven outta ten chance of goin' in the dumper
Rexman, slightly irritated, backs out of the box
Shut up, will ya, Taylor
Hey,  can understand not wantin' to talk about baseball when your nuts are in a vice like this
Rexman gets back in the box
By the way,  saw your wife at the Capri Lounge last night
Hell of a dancer
You must be very proud
Rexman is trying to ignore Taylor, but failing badly
Taylor flashes a sign to Vaughn
Vaughn goes into his windup
But that guy she was with
mean 'm sure he's a close personal friend of yours and all, but tell me
Vaughn releases his pitch
Why was he wearing her panties on his head
Rexman, completely unnerved, takes a feeble swing and hits a high pop-up out in front of the plate
Uh oh, Rexie,  don't think that one's got the distance
Maybe if the wind comes up
Taylor moves out two steps and makes the catch easily, ending the game
Taylor rushes out to congratulate Vaughn
The players exchange handshakes and high fives, as Brown watches from the dugout
It's startin' to come together, Pepper
It's startin' to come together
- Taylor pulls up outside and walks up to the door
Suzanne, Dorn's wife, answers
Oh hi, Jake, how are you
Fine, Suzanne, can  have a quick word with Rodger
Sure, c'mon in, he's in the den
'll get some coffee
We  Taylor into the luxurious den, where we find Dorn watching his wide screen  in a smoking jacket
Hey, Jake, old boy, what brings you out here
just wanta tell ya somethin', but didn't want to do it in front of the whole team
Sure, go ahead
(like nails) don't know what your problem is, but
(bending close to Dorn) if  ever see you tank another play like you did tonight, 'll cut off your nuts and stuff 'em down your fuckin' throat
Dorn looks at Taylor for some sign that he's kidding
He doesn't get one
Taylor turns and walks on out, as we go to Dorn's stunned face
Suzanne walks in with a tray
Coffee anybody
'   - The Indians are undressing after practice
Why the hell are we havin' practice during the All-Star break
heard the Big Lady upstairs ordered it
It's hotter than shit in here
What happened to the air conditioning
- We go to Brown, naked and dragging from the heat
He approaches the whirlpool and turns on the water
(to Dorn) Oh man, this old body can use a soak
Forget it
It's not workin' again
Brown flips on a switch
The whirlpool makes some grinding noises and then quits altogether
Damn it,  thought they were gonna replace this thing
Harris shouts over from the showers where he's just turned on the water
Hey, there's no hot water in here
She's at it again
've had it with this nickel and dime stuff
(storming out of the training room) 'm gonna get the Bitch on the phone
Brown is stopped short by the sight of Rachel Phelps standing in the middle of the locker room as various unclad players dive for cover
You wanted to see the Bitch
Yeh
Don't you think you oughta cover yourself with a towel first, Mr
Brown
There aren't any towels, and 'm too old to be diving under benches
Well,  can take it if you can
What happened to the new whirlpool we were supposed to get
Revenue problems have forced us to cut back on equipment
We'll simply have to fix the old one
You fixed it six times already
And now there's no hot water in the showers
The pipes in this building are old and rusted
We're replacing them, but it's a long, expensive process
How am  supposed to keep my players healthy with cold water and no therapy equipment
Your players will just have to get a little tougher
What are they, a bunch of pansies
Immediately, 30 arms shoot up behind her in the Italian "up- yours" gesture
She turns around, but by then the players have quickly returned to normal positions
Over 162 games even tough guys get sprains, sore arms, muscle pulls
It's only temporary
Besides, these guys weren't playing that good when the equipment was workin'
If  could get anybody to come and watch this team, none of this would be necessary
You oughta be grateful  can still pay your salaries
With that, Rachel turns and walks out
Brown and the others can only watch her go
: Sequence omitted from original script
Sequence omitted from original script
: On the air
In case you haven't noticed, and judging by attendance, you haven't, the Indians, that thought-to-be hopeless collection of has-been's and never-will-be's is actually approaching the
500 mark, and with it, semi-respectability
Nothing to write home about, to be sure, but at least we don't have to cover our eyes
- Bobby, Vic and Johnny are at the counter
Ya know, they could be a lot worse
- The Business Executive is talking with a friend while working out on the Nautilus machines
Ya know,  may have underestimated this team a bit
- The two Longshoremen again
Ya know, these guys aren't so fuckin' bad
- The two Groundskeepers are repairing the pitcher's mound
(in subtitles) They're still shitty

[
] Brown storms out of the dugout, doing his best to look incensed
Ah shit, here comes Lou
Gimme a break, Mel
gotta get outta here
All right, kick some dirt on me
The Commissioner'll buy that
Right
Good idea
Taylor begins kicking dirt on Wingo's shoes, ala Billy Martin
Wingo takes a dramatic hop, skip and jump and gives Taylor the heave-ho thumb just as Brown arrives
Wingo turns away
(to Wingo) Hey, don't you go anywhere
wanna have a few words with you
Brown grabs Taylor and pulls him aside
(under his breath) What are we arguin' about here
(struggling as if he wanted to get at Wingo) Fucker called that a ball
You mean the one that was a foot outside
Yeh
Taylor breaks away and starts back to the dugout
Playing it to the hilt, he throws his glove and mask to the ground on the way
Meanwhile, Brown is going jaw to jaw with Wingo, outraged at the call
Brown pulls a carrot out of his back pocket, and offers it to Wingo, who immediately thumbs him out
leaving her seat and starting up the aisle
Taylor comes up the stairs from the locker room, still in full uniform
He emerges onto the box level to see Lynn disappearing down the ramp toward the parking lot
in the parking lot
As she goes to unlock her car, Taylor looks around hurriedly for some kind of vehicle to follow her in
He bangs on the bullpen gates and is admitted by the guard
Inside is the Bullpen car, a souped-up golf cart with a body shaped like a batting helmet
Taylor hops in and roars out after Lynn
- Lynn comes out of the dressing room into the pool area, deserted this time of night
She wears a racing suit, but lets her hair hang free
The pool glows like a sheet of emerald glass
She shakes down a beat, curls her toes around the coping, slowly bends at the waist, and then launches into a full-out racing dive
We watch as she swims a 100 yard individual medley; first the butterfly, then the backstroke, breaststroke and finally freestyle
We condense the time, of course,  some underwater, some -, as she knives through the water, her hair flowing behind her, an athlete alone with her medium
The  should convey not only the grace of her strokes and her athletic ability, but the fluid beauty of swimming, its synthesis of power and form
As she begins the freestyle leg, another body appears in the pool next to her
It's Jake, and he's racing her the final lap
She immediately responds to the challenge, digging harder, picking up her kick
They go neck and neck for 20 yards, but Lynn has one more gear and touches him by half a body length at the wall
Both are winded
You still got that great kick
Just like the first time  ever saw you
You follow me here too
Yeh, what did you want to see me about
What do you mean
You wouldn't have been at the game if you didn't want to see me about something
(getting out of the pool) just wanted to see you play
How was
You looked good, but you oughta open your stance a little
They're pitching you inside
'll try that
You wanna have some dinner
Sorry,  already ate
Right
forgot your life is different now
(getting out of the pool) Thanks for the race
(watching her go) Anytime
'  - Driving through the city on her way home
Lynn glances in the rear-view mirror and spots Taylor following her
She smiles to herself
Taylor, of course, thinks he's gone undetected
We begin a   during which Lynn tries to lose Taylor in a chase through Cleveland, car vs
batting helmet
The logistics will have to be worked out in Cleveland, but suffice it to say, by the end of the chase she appears to have ditched him
'  - Lynn comes up the stairs, unlocks the apartment door and steps inside
There's no particular urgency
She feels sure she's shaken Taylor
The apartment is full of packing boxes
Tired from the chase, Lynn drops her bag on a box and slumps down on the couch
It's obvious she's not all that happy to have lost Taylor
She goes to the window and looks down to the street for some sign of him
Seeing nothing, she turns away from the window disappointed, and starts back to the couch, when something stops her
It's Taylor, standing in the doorway
Whose place are we at this time
(flustered) Mine
You follow me again
Yeh
When  saw you at the game, figured you wanted to see me about something
just wanted to see you play
How was
You looked good, but you oughta open your stance a little
They're pitchin' you inside
'll try that
Taylor gives a perfunctory nod
They look at each other a second
There's still plenty there
Taylor begins to come toward her
We hear his cleats on the floor
She backs off, but not with real conviction
think  oughta tell you that 'm moving in with Tom
Goin' uptown, huh
'm not goin' uptown,  just want to lead a regular life
You know, like an adult maybe
With a house and a garden and normal hours
You think  can't lead a regular life
You like the life you've had, Jake
You like hangin' out with the boys, livin' in hotels, eatin' dinner at midnight, having girls send you their underwear in the mail
Remember the surprise party  threw for you when you made the All-Star team
You never showed up, but the doorbell rang once and we all got quiet and hid behind the furniture
It was a guy to serve you with a paternity suit
That was a hoax
The girl was just trying to get some publicity
Yes, but you had obviously been with her
And it happened in front of all our friends
was drownin', Lynn
The endorsements were dryin' up, my knees were goin', they were talkin' about sendin' me down
was just trying to hold on to somethin', prove to myself  was still an All-Star
don't care about that anymore
know  don't have much time left in baseball
'm just a guy trying to put his life back together
Thinkin' about you was the only thing that kept me goin' in Mexico
Lynn looks at him a long beat
've come back to you too many times, Jake
can't afford to believe you anymore
Lynn is backed up against a desk now
She could move out but doesn't
guess this is our last hurrah then
guess so
Did you really read "Moby Dick
" Cover to cover
Taylor comes forward to kiss her, tentatively at first
Their conversation is interwoven with the slowly deepening intensity of their kissing
When's the wedding
October third
Your mom and dad like this guy
You're still their favorite
They're unbuttoning each other's shirts now
Gonna be a big wedding
Tom doesn't like big weddings
You coulda read Plot Outlines of 101 Great Novels
Where
At any library
mean the wedding
All Saints on Euclid
Nice church
Yeh
Who saved Ishmael at the end
Nobody
It was Queequeg's coffin
Am invited
Where
To the wedding
If you want
Maybe you really did read it
Their shirts are off now
This doesn't change anything, you know
We were always good at this
Lynn
What
The zipper on your skirt is stuck
Use your imagination
Taylor's spikes come down across her skirt, catching in the material, ripping it from her body and pinning it to the wood floor
Taylor steps out of the shoe and whisks Lynn We hold on the skirt, nailed to the floor by the cleats
'  - Taylor wakens and turns over to find Lynn gone
He looks around but there's no sign of her
'  - Taylor comes down the steps, gets in his car, and drives We  on the , and
: - Taylor's car pulls
He gets out and goes up the steps
There's one light on in the apartment window
Taylor comes up to the door and knocks
Getting no answer, he pushes it open to find that the apartment is completely empty
Just bare hardwood floor
Taylor stands forlorn in the center of the room a beat, then walks on out, switching off the overhead light as he goes
'  - Donovan is present once again
Rachel does not look pleased
Well, my worst fears have been confirmed
We're 60 and 60, nine games out of first, and only two out of the first division
Who do those guys think they are
Maybe you just have to accept the fact that they're not as bad as you'd hoped
don't have to accept anything
Our attendance is only beginning to rise
If we can force a losing streak for a week or two, we can still turn this thing around
The fans are used to losers here
At the first sign of a slump they'll give up on this team
What's left to do
You've taken away everything you can
Not everything
: - We pick up a decrepit old Greyhound bus coming down the highway, belching smoke like a diesel semi
On the side we see the visage of Chief Wahoo and the words "Indian Express
" - Complete with all the luxuries of the average school bus
Temple is looking at a memo from Rachel Phelps
Memo says we'll only be usin' this for short trips
Good thing we don't play anybody in Europe
Taylor is staring out the window, still morose about Lynn's leaving
stack of Classics Illustrated comics sits next to him
Can  borrow one of those, man
They don't have any magazines on this bus
Sure, go ahead
think my reading days are over
Macbeth
This a good one
(pointing to his stack of Classics) These are all Hall of Famers
Hayes is impressed
- The Indian Express makes its way through the streets of New York, enroute to the Indian's hotel
- We see that now most of the team is reading classic comics
(to Dorn) 'll trade you Song of Hiawatha for The Deerslayer
Naw, 'm not into Song of Hiawatha
All right then, how about Crime and Punishment
Yeh, that sounds pretty good
That's a detective story, right
Yeh
- The bus slows down and pulls over to the curb
This is it
The Sheffield Arms
The players all crowd to the window to get a glimpse of their hotel
Hotel is actually overstating it
This place is one cut below the
don't know if we can survive any more of these economy measures
- We pick up Taylor, Hayes and Vaughn coming into their dilapidated hotel room
Peeling walls and ceilings, rickety furniture, rusted bathroom fixtures
Taylor sprawls down on one of the cots
It collapses on the floor in a cloud of dust
- Vaughn is on the mound warming up
(
) So, Ricky Vaughn, roughed up in his only other appearance against the Yankees, will see what he can do with the Bronx Bombers this time
Vaughn, after a slow start, has come on lately and now leads the American League in strikeouts with 221
Vaughn finishes his warmups
As Taylor pumps the ball down to second, Vaughn hears a voice from the Yankee dug-out
Hey, jailbird
Vaughn glances over and sees that one of the Yankees is dressed in a striped prison uniform
He also wears long earrings, high heels, and of course, glasses
Vaughn tries to ignore the guy, but his concentration is broken
Vaughn steps up on the rubber for his first pitch
He winds and fires
The Yankee   rips a one-hopper to the wall in right center
Hayes runs it down and guns it back to the infield to hold the guy to a double
The convict whoops it up
Vaughn gets back up on the rubber
As he comes to the stretch, he catches sight of the convict again
The guy is doing a pantomime, sneaking up to a car and picking the lock, much to the delight of his teammates
Vaughn throws his pitch in the dirt and all the way to the backstop
The runner on second goes to third
(throwing the ball back) 'mon, Rick baby, settle down
Vaughn gets ready again
The convict finishes picking the lock and then is suddenly arrested
He puts his hands against the wall and spreads his legs for a weapons check, cracking up the whole bench
Vaughn is getting a little steamed
His next pitch is hammered into left for a single, scoring a run
throwing pitches, followed by: of the   lining a double down the right field line, the   a triple off the center field wall, and the   a single to right
The scoreboard now reads 4 to 0 Yankees
Taylor comes out to talk to Vaughn
What's the problem, Rick
You're throwin' basketballs up there
That guy in the dugout botherin' you
Naw, 'm all right
Forget him
Worry about the guys carryin' bats
'mon, Ricky, let's get nasty
Vaughn nods as Taylor trots back behind the plate
Vaughn gets set again as his old nemesis, Haywood, steps into the batter's box
Haywood has a sly smile on his face
As Vaughn comes to his stretch, the convict goes back into his act
He's in jail now, struggling against the bars
Finally he bends over and grabs his ankles, while one of his teammates humps up against him, pretending to bugger him
This sends the Yankee bench into hysterics
Vaughn has lost it now
He fires to the plate and Haywood creams another tape measure job into the upper deck
Hayes doesn't even bother to run back to the wall
He just watches it go
6-0 Yankees
thought now that Vaughn had some control, he was ready for the Yankees
Not quite yet
Brown makes his way to the mound to take Vaughn out
(
) So, Vaughn pitches in some tough luck here as the Yankees put together as few squib hits and take a 6-0 lead
in the press box
The stadium below is empty, the grounds crew covering the infield
Well, the Indians made a gallant comeback today, but fell one run short as the Yankees held on for a 6- 5 victory, although they didn't do squat after the first inning
Anyway, if the bus makes it here from the hotel we'll be on at 7:30 tomorrow night
Till then, this is Harry Doyle, saying so long, everybody, and Happy Hunting
- Brown is alone in the bar having a drink
figure sits down on the stool next to him
It's Donovan
Mind if  join you
(surprised to see him) Donovan
Hell no
What are you doin' here
Just wanted to get out on the road
You damn near pulled one out today
Someday we'll figure out how to beat those guys
Ya know, you've done a helluva job this year
Sixty and sixty-one is hardly a helluva job
With this club it is
Ya know, when  first got to camp figured this team had no chance was just hopin' we'd win enough that could stay on and really start to build something here
But there's a lotta talent on this club, Charlie
The veterans are starting to play back to form and the rookies are developing faster than  thought
There's two or three potential all- stars in there
think we're a first division team right now
You really believe that, don't you
know it
All we need is something to bring it all together
Rachel Phelps would never allow that
What do you mean
She doesn't want you in the first division
She doesn't even want you in Cleveland
On Brown's incredulous face, we
: - The players are all gathered around, obviously having been called together by Brown
(addressing the group) got somethin'  think you oughta know about
wouldn't have known about it myself if Charlie Donovan hadn't told me, although  shoulda guessed it from everything that's happened
It seems that Mrs
Phelps doesn't think too highly of our worth
We take several    around the room
She put this team together because she thought we'd be bad enough to finish dead last, knockin' attendance down to the point where she could move the team to Miami
(pause) And get rid of all of us for better personnel
Taylor, Vaughn, Hayes, Dorn, and the others can hardly believe what they're hearing
Even me
Even you, Dorn
Silence descends on the room
In other words, Phelps thinks we're all dinks
That we don't belong in the big leagues
That's about it
What if we don't finish last
She'll replace you with somebody who will
After this season, you'll all be sent back to the minors or given your outright release
(pause) So, all we're gonna get is this one year
Taylor surveys the bowed heads around the room
He stands to address the group
don't know about the rest of you, but 've been playin' baseball since was five years old
've had some good years and some years to forget
've burned out my knees
don't think  have three fingers that work right
've lost most of the money made and baseball has messed up my personal life from time to time
But know one thing
can still play this game a little
And 'd like to know who in this room thinks they're the kinda bum Mrs
Phelps is lookin' for
Eyes dart around the room, then come back to Taylor
No hands are raised
Well, then,  guess there's only one thing to do
What's that
Win the whole fuckin' thing
We take  of the startled faces of the players
As the idea sinks in, they begin to come to life
begins and we're into a
detailing the newly-motivated Indians' drive for the pennant and the "Pennant Fever" it creates in Cleveland
We begin with
hanging a full size blowup of Rachel Phelps on the locker room wall
In the picture she's pointing as if out at the players, and a bubble above her head says, "
" set of designer clothes, of the type Rachel wears, have been superimposed on the picture
The clothes are divided into 32 pull-off squares
figure it's gonna take 32 more victories to win this thing
Every time we win, we peel a square
coming out of an elevator in the Turk, with a wheelbarrow full of dirt
We pan him down the hall, where we see a dirt sliding area he's been building up
leading off a makeshift base in the hall of the Turk
As Vaughn tosses a ball up in the air, Hayes takes off down the hall toward another base on the dirt sliding area
Vaughn catches the ball and rifles a throw down to Taylor, who puts the tag on the sliding Hayes
Cerrano, who's umping, calls Hayes out
Hayes jumps up and argues vociferously, hopping around in frustration

lining a single to center
Cerrano charges it and fires to the plate as a Runner tries to score from second
Just as Taylor catches the ball, he's once again knocked flat by the Runner

Under another, a navel
Under still another, the edge of a bare breast and arm
all dressed in tuxedos, posed "team picture" style on the infield of Municipal Stadium
(in unison) Hello, do you know us
We're a Major League baseball team, but since we haven't won a pennant in thirty years, nobody recognizes us, not even in our own hometown
That's why we carry the American Express card
No matter how far out of first we are, it keeps us from getting shut out at our favorite hotels and restaurants
So if you're looking for some big league clout, apply for the little green home run hitter
Look what it's done for us
People still don't recognize us, but
(whispering) we're in the first division now
sliding across home plate in his tuxedo and stopping
He holds up an American Express card in a black-gloved hand
The American Express card
Don't steal home without it
filing into Cleveland Municipal Stadium
Tickets being ripped, programs sold, etc
swinging and hitting a home run into the left field seats
beating the tom-toms and whooping it up
The   to reveal they're no longer alone in the stands
nailing up another pair of gloves above his head
There are a lot of them up there now
- On the road again
Everyone's asleep except Taylor who lies across his seat, heating pads on his knees
( ) watching  in a Cleveland working-class bar
Also cheering the Indians are several punk and heavy metal kids, their faces painted with Indian war paint
Strange bedfellows
hitting a prodigious home run onto the roof
standing up to cheer Cerrano's homer, then remembering he's with Rachel
He sits down apologetically
Rachel watches the events on the field with a face of cold steel
hitting a double into the right centerfield alley with two runners on
Hayes, the trailing runner, catches up with the lead runner, and they reach the plate at about the same time, one sliding around the Catcher one way, one around the other
Both score as the Catcher tries to tag both and gets neither
going wild, while the Indian mascot dances on top of the dugout
The program in progress is suddenly interrupted by a Sports- Break logo appearing on the screen
We interrupt this program to bring you the following special bulletin
live outside the Indian's locker room
He wears a headdress, warpaint, and a Wild Thing -shirt
Good evening, everybody
The incredible has happened
The Indians have finished the regular season in a first place tie with the New York Yankees on the strength of a 4-2 win over the Tigers in Detroit today
There will be a one-game playoff here in Cleveland the day after tomorrow to decide the Eastern Division Championship, the Indians having won the coin flip held just moments ago in the American League office
We'll have further details on the news at 11, but for now, get your tomahawks ready, Cleveland
- We hear cheers as it's ripped away to reveal the photographic image of Rachel's cleavage
We   to see the life- size poster is now completely peeled
Rachel stares out at us in a -string and tassels
The photo is obviously from her showgirl days
General merriment prevails in the locker room
Players shaking hands, back slapping, etc
Hayes comes by to exchange congratulations with Taylor
and
Hey, not bad for a has-been and a never-will-be
We haven't won anything yet
We still got one more to go
Dorn comes by Taylor's locker
Hey, Taylor, there's a coupla drop- dead Annies outside
One of 'em says she used to know you pretty good
Brunette, great rack
Darla
Yeh
What doya say we chat 'em up
(without much enthusiasm) don't know
'mon, you're not gonna keep moonin' over that library chick, are you
Forget her, she's gone
We leave Taylor thinking it over
'  - Suzanne Dorn is watching the 11 o'clock news
is holding forth
The Indians are spending the night in Detroit and will bus back to Cleveland in the morning
We're going to go back now to Ross Farmer who's standing by at the Hotel Stanley where the Indians are staying in Detroit
Ross
The scene shifts to
where Ross Farmer stands, microphone in hand
Behind him several players can be seen partying in the bar
Thank you, Hal
As you can see, the Indians are in high spirits tonight, looking forward to their showdown with the Yankees
Who will start that game is still a matter of some conjecture
As Ross talks, Dorn walks    in the far background with his arm around a
They're nuzzling and hugging, unaware they're on camera, albeit in the background
Suzanne doesn't miss it though
She moves closer to the screen to get a better look
Dorn and the Girl get in an elevator together, obviously going upstairs
As the elevator closes, Suzanne hits the off button
She sits there a second in shock, and then her face begins to harden
'   - Taylor and  are undressing, preparatory to getting into bed
They are definitely no strangers to each other
You still got that black Corvette
The one that the sound system took up the whole trunk
No,  had to sell it
thought they gave them to ya
Not after your knees go bad
That's all right, you'll be gettin' a new one now
Darla is down to her bra and panties
She puts her leg up on the bed to unhook her stockings
Taylor is about to take off his pants, but stops
Darla,  don't think  can do this
What do you mean
We did this between innings once
guess 'm just not that guy anymore
Darla looks at him a long beat
(resigned) Happens to the best of them sooner or later
What's her name
'  - The door opens and Darla comes out, fully clothed now
She turns to say goodbye to Jake, who is still bare-chested
So long, Jake
Too bad
was gonna devote a whole chapter to you in my book
As Darla gives Jake a goodbye peck, the elevator door opens across the hall, and out steps Lynn
She's obviously rattled by the sight of Taylor and Darla together
Excuse me
was in town for a conference and thought 'd drop by, but  can see you're busy
With that she quickly steps back into the elevator and the doors close
Lynn, wait
Taylor leaps to the elevator door, but it's too late
He then sprints to the end of the hall and down the stairs
running down the stairs and into the lobby
Seeing no sign of Lynn, he races out the front door to see her pulling out in a taxi
He can only stand and watch her disappear into the night
'  - We   Vaughn making his way to the back of the bus, where Brown has his "office" on the last seat
Most of the other players are asleep after a late night of partying
You wanted to see me
Yeh, Rick
just wanted to tell you that 'm startin' Harris tomorrow against the Yankees, even though it's your turn in the rotation
Vaughn says nothing, but he's clearly disappointed
He's got more experience and a little better record against the Yankees
Yeh, sure
Whatever's best for the team
Don't read anything into it, Rick
You're one of the guys that got us here
Yeh, okay
Vaughn turns and walks back up the aisle
Brown watches him go, knowing he's still upset
- The Indian bus pulls up outside the Stadium, where a group of several thousand fans wait
The players are showered with cheers and applause as they file out
- Vaughn sits in the bar alone, nursing a beer, still troubled by his demotion
He hears a sexy  behind him
You mind if  join you
Vaughn turns around to see Suzanne Dorn
She's dressed to draw blood, looking better than we've ever seen her
She slides into the booth
don't think 'd be very good company tonight
Why not
Nothin'
Job problem
Vaughn falls silent
Suzanne stares at him with a devastating combination of sexual heat and tender admiration
She's pulling out all the stops
Vaughn's a little flustered
'm, ah, a ball player
know, but that's not why  came over
don't chase ball players
Why did you come over then
Because you're the sexiest man 've ever laid eyes on, and you look like you could use a
friend
We   Vaughn
Forget it
He's a goner
'  - Vaughn has dozed off in the bed
Suzanne, is getting dressed
Vaughn wakes up as she finishes
Where you goin'
've gotta get home
didn't even get your name
Suzanne
Suzanne Dorn (having heard that name someplace before) Suzanne Dorn
Mrs
Suzanne Dorn
(kissing him on the forehead) So long
You're a great kid
With that she walks on out, leaving Vaughn dazed by the knowledge of who he's just slept with
' Taylor is coming back from the bathroom down the hall as Suzanne comes out of Vaughn's room
(nonchalant) Hello, Jake
Hello, Suzanne
Taylor is amazed by what he's just seen
As soon as Suzanne is out of sight, he goes to Vaughn's room and opens the door
Vaughn
Vaughn is sitting on his bed in a state of disbelief
swear to God  didn't know who she was
Taylor nods that it's all right even though he doesn't believe it

pulling up outside the church
Lynn is helped out of the car by her Father
As she starts up the steps, she sees that both sides are lined by the entire Cleveland Indians team in uniform
They form an arch of bats as she passes
At the top of the steps is Taylor
Lynn stops as her father ushers her mother on into the church
You look beautiful
Thank you
didn't think you'd come
can't stay
(indicating the team) We gotta get to the park
Good luck today, Jake
Yeh, you too
(pause) Tell me one thing
The night you came up to my hotel -- was there really a library conference
No,  came to see you
Too bad it didn't work out better just wanna say 'm sorry for all the things 've put you through over the years
Even for last night
Can't be sorry for that
Nothing happened
He says this with absolute conviction
Despite herself, Lynn senses that he's telling the truth
Then you weren't defending my honor again
didn't have to
She knew she was outclassed
Lynn smiles
He gives her a kiss and watches as she goes inside
He stands there a long beat, then turns and walks slowly down the steps past his teammates
'  - Rachel is looking out at the empty stadium
There's a at the door
Come in
The door is opened by a Male Secretary and in steps Lou Brown
Hello, Lou, what can  do for ya
Lou puts a folded piece of paper on her desk
wanted to hand in my resignation before you had a chance to fire me
What do you mean
know what you been tryin' to do with this team
After the season, want no part of it
Well,  knew  could count on Charlie to tell somebody
was just afraid he might take too long
Why would you want him to tell somebody
So you'd tell the team, hopefully getting them mad enough to knock themselves out trying to prove they belonged in this league
think it worked
You tryin' to make me believe you wanted us to win all along
Rachel nods
Bullshit
What about the plane, the bus, the bad hotels
We were broke
We couldn't afford anything better
Donald left the team nearly bankrupt
If we'd had another losing season,  would have had to sell the team
knew we couldn't win with the team we had, so  decided to bring in new players and see how they'd do with the proper motivation
There was never any offer from Miami
made it all up
Why should  believe any of this
Now that we're winnin' it's easy for you to jump on the bandwagon
If 'd really wanted you to lose, all  had to do was send the best players back to the minors
But didn't, did
Brown has no comeback for this
He knows now that she's telling the truth
You think this was all an accident
personally scouted every member of this team, except Hayes, of course
He was a surprise
They all had flaws which concealed their real talent, or  wouldn't have been able to get them
But  knew if anyone could straighten them out, you could
And if you tell them any of this,  will fire you
Brown can only shake his head at this whole thing
love this team, Lou
Go get 'em tonight
The two shake hands
Brown looks at Rachel a beat, still looking for some sign of duplicity
Finally he gives her a grudging smile of respect
- Taylor, Hayes, Vaughn and the others are getting ready to board the bus to the stadium
Taylor pulls Vaughn aside
don't know what Dorn's wife is up to, but  think it'd be best if you dressed early and got out to the bullpen before Dorn comes in
Vaughn nods
(to Taylor) We got a problem
Cerrano wants some extra power for tonight
He's lookin' to sacrifice a live chicken
We can't have people pukin' in the locker room before the game
Tell him not to worry, 'll take care of it
'  - Dorn is ready to leave for the park
Bye bye, honey, wish me luck
Before you go, there's something wanta tell you
Uh oh, we know what this is all about
: - The place is jammed
75,000 screaming maniacs, most of them decked out in war paint and head dresses
Some carry plastic scalps with Yankee hats on them
Others have caps with the European "No" insignia superimposed over a door mat
In the press box
Here's your bourbon
Won't need it tonight
starkly quiet in contrast to the stadium outside
Each player has retreated into his own world of concentration
Dorn approaches Taylor, who's fitting heavy athletic braces on both knees
You know where Vaughn is
Nope
Haven't seen him
Let me know if you do
wanna have a little talk with him
Dorn moves off
Where's my chicken
It's comin' in now
We see a Bat Boy enter with a bucket of fried chicken
Cerrano looks at it in bewilderment
One whole chicken, like you said
But it no alive
Believe me, Jo-Buu will like this
He's gotta be gettin' tired of raw chicken
As Cerrano hefts the bucket somewhat skeptically and takes it to his altar, we
: warming up in the bullpen
The tension of starting such an important game shows in his face
Hello, everybody, Harry Doyle bidding you a Wahoo welcome from beautiful Municipal Stadium, where tonight before a capacity crowd of 75,000 screaming featherheads, the braves of the Cuyahoga will leave their teepees in search of Cleveland's first League Championship in over 30 years
Standing in the way, their long time nemesis, the New York Yankees, the Big Boys of Broadway, who have beaten the Indians like a tom-tom all year long
Down in the dugout, the players are lined up ready to take the field
They exchange words of encouragement, hand slaps, clenched fists, but all at a very low key level
This is tension time
All right, guys, let's take it to 'em
The Indians charge onto the field to a standing ovation
In the center field bleachers Thelma's victory blanket containing the scores of every Indian game for the season, hangs from a railing
Bobby, Vic and Johnny pound the tom- toms leading the stadium in a monster version of "In the Land of Burning Waters
" Even the groundskeepers join in
Two down in the first
Harris looking sharp so far
Bouncing ball to third
Dorn up with it
Throwing the first pitch
The   grounds one to Dorn who throws him out

Looking past him to the field

There's a runner on second
Still nothing -- nothing, top of the seventh, two down

Harris comes set and delivers

And the Yankees lead it 2-0

Donovan is a little confused by this
Burton trots around the bases and is greeted by jubilant teammates at the plate
silent pall falls on the stadium
As the "2" goes up on the scoreboard, we
: popping up and flinging his bat away in frustration
We take of the worried fans, chewing fingernails, wadding up programs, hanging their heads, etc
grounding out, obviously having trouble running
We take of worried faces on the bench
stepping into the batter's box
The crowd is practically sitting on its hands now
Hope draining away
(
) Dorn up now, two down, bottom of the seventh
The Indians running out of chances
Dorn swings at the first pitch and lines a sharp single to left
The crowd and the Indian bench suddenly come alive
Cerrano moves to the plate
(
) That'll bring on Cerrano, hitless tonight
As a matter of fact, he hasn't touched the ball yet
The crowd and bleacher band begins to clap as Dorn takes his lead
Cerrano swings at the first pitch and misses
An audible groan goes through the crowd
The Yankee pitcher gets set again, and throws Cerrano a big, roundhouse curve
He misses it a foot
Strike two
Damn, havin' trouble with the curve ball again
We should've gotten him a live chicken
Cerrano steps out and begins to talk to his bat, gesturing and pointing as if arguing with his wife
pissed off now, Jo-Buu
good to you,  stand up for you
If you no help me now,  say fuck you, Jo-Buu
do it myself
Cerrano gets back in the box and digs in
The Yankee pitcher comes to his stretch and delivers
Another big breaking curve ball
Cerrano swings and knocks the crap out of it
Everyone in the stands and on the bench jumps to their feet, rooting for the ball to get out
( #212EE) Long drive, deep centerfield
Way back
It might be
It could be
The ball is
Downtown, welcome to the Happy Hunting Ground
The game is tied
The fans go crazy as Cerrano circles the bases
'  ( # 212GG) Rachel jumps out of her seat, hands above her head
Donovan hesitates a beat, then follows suit
Cerrano carries his bat with him, holding it high above his head
As Cerrano disappears into the dugout, we go to the scoreboard as the 2 goes up
( # 212NN) Two down in the top of the ninth, still tied at 2, Harris working on an eight-hitter
: lining a single to right field
Harris mops his brow, obviously tiring
smashing a double off the wall, the lead runner stopping at third
Brown signals to the bullpen to get somebody warm
on the mound, looking like he's out of gas
(
) Activity continues in the pen, as Harris is really digging himself a hole now
He got the first two hitters, and then gave up a single and a double and has now gone 3-0 to Cheevers
Harris comes set and fires to the plate
It's way high
(
) High, ball four and they're loaded for Haywood, the biggest Indian killer of them all
Brown has seen enough
He makes his way to the mound
(taking the ball from Harris) You pitched a hell of a game, Steve
Take a seat and we'll see if we can get this guy for ya
Brown signals to the bullpen with his left hand
Give me Vaughn
(surprised) You want Vaughn
know he hasn't done real well against this guy, but  got a hunch he's due
striding in from the bullpen
He doesn't look relaxed
As he nears the infield he purposely doesn't look at Dorn
Dorn stares at him with undisguised venom
As Vaughan gets to the mound, he sees Patton getting his convict uniform on in the Yankee dugout
He looks away to see Haywood in the on-deck circle smiling out at him
Meanwhile, the  has gone nuts at the sight of Vaughn
Bobby, Vic and Johnny are blasting out "Wild Thing" on the tom-toms and the whole stadium, 75,000 strong, is singing it
Doyle just pushes the mic forward and lets the crowd do it's work
Okay, Ricky, Haywood likes the hard stuff in
Curve him on the hands, bust him away, and don't get up with anything
You listenin' to me Rick
Vaughn nods, but we can tell he's too nervous to have digested any of that
(Patting him on the butt) , kid, you're my man
Let's go get him
'mon Ricky, this guy is the out you been waitin' your whole life for
Brown and Taylor leave Vaughn alone on the mound, the of the crowd ringing in his ears
(  #216N) Vaughn has finished his warmup and we're ready to
No sooner has Taylor settled in behind the plate, than Dorn starts toward the mound
Vaughn watches him come with fear and trepidation
(seeing it) Oh, shit
Dorn arrives at the mound, and holds out his hand for the ball
Vaughn gives it to him
Dorn rubs it up, staring long and hard into Vaughn's eyes
Vaughn is sweating bullets
Finally Dorn speaks
Let's cut through the crap
only got one thing to say to you
Just rear back and strike this motherfucker out
He smiles and hands Vaughn the ball back
Vaughn returns the smile and accepts the ball
While Dorn trots back to his position, Vaughn turns his back to the plate for one last moment of concentration
As he turns around to face us, we see a new man as the wicked opening  of 's "Wild Thing" are heard on the , only louder and more savage than before
Vaughn steps up on the rubber, his face hardened into fierce resolve
There's nothing nervous about him now
This kid is gonna make somebody pay
(
) Haywood steps in, the American League triple crown winner
341 average, 48 homers, 121
's
He's homered the only two times he's faced Vaughn
Taylor sets down a sign
Two fingers for the curve ball
Vaughn shakes it off
Taylor puts down another sign
Vaughn shakes it off
Finally, Taylor puts down one finger -- the fast ball
Vaughn nods with steely purpose
All right, Ricky, let's get nasty
Vaughn winds and delivers a hissing blur toward the plate
Haywood takes a ferocious swing and misses
Strike one
We see the number 97 come up on the digital readout of the which a club employee holds behind the screen
(to Haywood) All right, looks like the boy is pumped
Sucker was movin', wasn't it
Ever hit ya, it'd leave a two foot hole comin' out
Taylor gets ready to flash another sign
The convict jumps up and down trying to distract Vaughn
No way
(for Haywood's ears) Let's see, what should we call now
Let's see how he feels about old number one
Taylor puts down one finger
Vaughn nods and then winds and fires again, another blazing rocket
Haywood takes a wicked rip, but doesn't get it
Strike two
99 comes up on the gun
The convict has stopped jumpin'
Nice swing, Haywood
Good follow- through
Keep it up, 'll show you the ball sometime
The fans are going wild
They're all standing now, yelling for a strikeout
Vaughn gets back up on the rubber with the look of an animal sighting prey
Taylor gets down to give the sign
(  # 216R) Forget the curveball
Go with the heater
Well, shit, all these pitches to choose from
Maybe we'll try somethin' different this time
Taylor wiggles his fingers around and then puts down the big No
1
Vaughn gives him a quick nod
And if  don't see you again, Haywood, have a nice winter
Okay, buddy
Vaughn goes into his windup and unleashes a screaming bullet toward the plate
Haywood pulls the trigger, but it's already by him
Strike three
101 on the gun
Taylor leaps up and gives Vaughn the fist
The fans are going berserk ends

) Oh, Lordy, three straight heaters and the Yankees are blown down
No runs, two hits, three left on, and, are you ready, Cleveland

The shortstop waits for it to come down and then fires to first
Too late
Hayes streaks across the bag, beating the throw by a hair
Once again the comes to life
The Yankee Manager comes to the mound and waves for a new pitcher
(
) And Horton is wasting no time
He's goin' to the Duke
Out of the pen comes  , a good facsimile of Goose Gossage only Duke is bigger and meaner
(  #219M) Duke leads the league in saves, strikeouts per inning and nose hairs
The Duke finishes his warmups and stares over at Hayes
Hayes smiles, snaps his black gloves out of his hip pocket, and carefully pulls them on over his hands
The Duke does not care for this kind of showmanship
Brown comes over to talk to Taylor, who's been watching Duke from the on-deck circle
Ya know 'd be an ass not to pinch- hit for you here
You're 0 for 18 against Duke
Plus you're beat to shit you can hardly walk, there's no way you can get around on this guy's fast ball
So  want the absolute truth here
Can you beat this guy

Taylor digs in his back foot, then points to the left field bleachers ala Babe Ruth

Duke stares in at Taylor, comes to his stretch and then lets go a steaming fast ball right at Taylor's head
Taylor goes down in a swirl of dust, the ball missing him by inches
