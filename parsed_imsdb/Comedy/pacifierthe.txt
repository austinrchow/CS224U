From his belt, Shane takes a steel wand with an adhesive disc attached, aims it at the fleeing boat and

The Pilot looks below
What's happening
- The jet skiers protectively circle the injured boat in a move, and the Jet Ski drivers are simultaneously  below the surface: a split second later they're replaced by our  ( ) -- the switch happens in less than a second, way too fast for anyone to notice

Up to his nose, over his head
He's gone
Then Shane Wolf rises out of the water, hauling the Professor up
He cuts the Professor's
Plummer screams
Shane removes his mouth piece
Shane doesn't seem the slightest bit fazed by the circumstances
Lieutenant Shane Wolfe, United States Navy
'm gonna get you outta here
But you have to do exactly what  say, when say it
My way -- no highway option
Do you copy
(Plummer nods, terrified
) Where's the briefcase
The Professor gestures across the room, where a metal is floating
Shane calmly  it to his own waist
As the water rises, to the roof
How did you know where

The Seal calls out: "shoot more, more

Chopper's four meters at your 10 o'clock

First round's on me back at Virginia Beach
Shane takes a deep breath, and pulls himself, the Professor and the briefcase  the water

- Shane smiles, clearly he loves this kind of day
He looks beside him, the Professor looks terrified
The Professor takes out his mouth piece
Oh my God

how'd we
That was the most incredible
Shane sticks the mouth piece back in the Professors' mouth, shutting him up
Better keep that on `til we get to the rendezvous point
(through the mouth piece) Why
Poison gas
(re: the oxygen) No
'm just not big on chit chat
- Pave Hawk -60 helicopter, rotors whirling slowly, waits
Shane's chopper appears from behind a tree line and sets down atop the mountain by a stream
Shane and Charles sprint from the chopper towards the waiting Hawk
Charles stops Shane
Lieutenant, thank you
(He pats his briefcase) You saved more than just my life today
Can  call my wife to let her know 'm okay
Negative
Not imperative to the mission
We have to keep moving
have strict orders to get you out of here safely
'm safe, Lieutenant
Please
She thinks 'm dead
(then) Don't you have a family
6
(this gets him:) Make it quick
Charles picks up his briefcase
He holds the lock up to his mouth and whispers into it: Joe, Todd, Lulu, Peter, Tyler
The briefcase pops open
Shane looks at him, puzzled
(') My kids
It's voice activated
Designed it myself
do security, that's my specialty
(gestures back:) Those guys back there tried to get this case open for five days -- couldn't crack it
And you should see what happens to you if open it without the code
have a picture of my kids in here, you want to see it
Negative
Charles takes a cell-phone out of the case
Shane looks in the case: it's , except for the phone and a family
Charles dials his cell phone
nothing Battery's dead
Shane considers, then hands him his satellite phone
Charles dials, and talks

: Everything is a blur, in slow-motion
He sees Charles, unconscious
Huey Helicopter lands steps out, and takes Charles' Briefcase
There is huge explosion, as the chopper ignites
Everything is ablaze
Shane reaches out, grabs the picture of Charles' kids then goes unconscious
: - : 1 Month Later - Shane lies in a hospital bed, despondent
His arm and face bandaged
Shane's Captain enters:   (35) -- friendly, unassuming
He looks like he hasn't slept in days
Shane salutes him with his bandaged arm -- it hurts to salute, but he does it anyway
Captain, sir
As you were Lieutenant
Bill sits down beside the bed
He takes a long look at Shane
He holds a  in his hand
(') We've been through a lot together Shane
You're the best man  ever trained
And a good friend
know sir
And  except full responsibility for the mission's failure
Why the hell did you let him use the satellite phone
He had to call his family
lapse in judgement on my part that  regret sir
8
Bill shakes his head, disappointed
He pulls up a chair, and sits opposite Shane
Plummer was the best security expert the department of defense ever had -- a genius
He was working on a program that scrambles launch codes
He called it : Guided High-altitude Scrambling Transmitter
One pulse from the  satellite and a country can't launch its own nukes
That's what the Serbians kidnapped him for, but they couldn't get inside the briefcase
The case was empty sir, as  stated in my report
Bill considers this
Then
Not a surprise, really
Not like the professor to hide things where someone might look for them
is still out there, (Bill smiles:) which is why 'm going to give you another shot
Shane sits up
He can't believe his good fortune
Sir
Thank you
appreciate your confidence
Invigorated, he pulls off bandages, disconnects an , and starts to rise
(') 'll need to put a team together
'm gonna need the mini sub,  need access to an EP3 aries 2 spy plane
(interrupting:) Negative
It's not that kind of mission
Shane listens, intrigued
(') Two days ago,  got a call from the professor's wife
Widow
She told me someone had broken into her home
Searched the place, top to bottom
() 9
(') She's scared
The family's scared
Whoever killed the professor must think is in that house
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't
Either way,  need someone to stay at that house, and protect them
And while you're there -- find out if the program is in there
That's it
Why would you want me for that, sir
The professor's wife requested you
Shane is surprised
Bill pulls a tiny tape recorder from his pocket, presses play, we hear ' voice
(
) Honey, 'm alive
Listen:  lot can happen between here and home -- if anything happens to me, call Lt
Shane Wolfe
He's a good man
anyway, should go
'll call you in an hour love you
Shane is shocked, hearing the dead man's voice
You gotta problem with this mission
Sirnosir
It's just that
've never been very good with kids, sir
Not even when  was a kid sir
: '  - Shane packs his duffel bag
He opens a drawer: There's five t-shirts, identical to the one he wears
He opens another drawer: Five khaki pants, also identical to the one he wears
He opens the closet: There's a massive fur- collared coat
Hm
He rejects it
Shane packs his duffel with military gear:  compass, night vision goggles, camouflage vest, machete
they all go in
Shane heads to the door, then goes back to his chest of drawers
He reaches in, and pulls out a small, old : the ribbon is faded and frayed
He looks at it for a moment, then unzips his suit and pins it to the inside, like it's a lucky rabbit's foot
10
- taxi door opens
Shane looks like a bad ass, ready for anything
He steps from the taxi onto an adorable doll on the sidewalk
It
Shane's
: Julie's unkempt suburban house, with toys all over the lawn, and a "  " welcome mat
Shane double-checks the address
The sprinklers go off
Shane darts to the door and rings the bell (it's one of those long cheerful doorbells)
hear   approach -- then the door swings open, Shane looks down -- and sees , 8, peering up at him
Shane eyes Lulu
Lulu eyes Shane, then: Mom
There's some weird bald guy at the door
Lulu shuts the door in Shane's face
Shane frowns
hear heavier footsteps approaching
(o
s
) (before she sees Shane:) Look, if you're with the Hare Krishnas, we're not interested
The door opens revealing
Julie holds baby , 2
She sees Shane, and stops, a little startled by his size
(salutes:) Lieutenant Shane Wolfe, reporting for duty
Of course
'm so sorry
Thank you for coming
She hugs him
He's not quite sure what to do -- he's a rock, he doesn't flinch
(') Come in and meet the rest of the gang
/ - It's warm and quiet
Petite Julie  up the stairs- 11
Shane startles, covers his ears
(') Get your butts down here and say "hello
" And then three pairs of feet come down the stairs
Lulu, , 15, and , 14 line up like the perfect family portrait
Todd's hair hangs in his face
He wears a Sid Vicious shirt and a long trench coat
(') You've already met Lulu
This is Peter, Zoe and Todd
Kids, this is Lieutenant Wolfe
He's the man who is going to be staying with us for a while
All the kids except for Todd- Hi
Shane nods, stern
On the stairs, a Romanian  walks by, carrying a
And this is Helga and Tyler
Shane nods hello to them
(official:) Ma'am
Baby
Kids, go finish your homework
And 'll be checking
Zoe, Lulu and Todd climb back up the stairs
Julie leads Shane into
- Julie sits, Shane stands "at ease" (which doesn't look "at ease" at all)
You have a pleasant family, ma'am
12
Charles wasn't around too much
His work took him all over the world
He'd be gone six or seven months at a time
So think for the younger ones it's a little confusing
Zoe and Todd
well, they're dealing like your normal teenagers
Maybe in Todd's case semi-normal
Mrs
Plummer,  have to tell you that did everything  could
Charles was in a dangerous business knew it when  married him
No one's to blame here
(beat) Everyone thinks that Charles told me or the kids where he hid it
And until is found, we're all in danger
Nothing will happen to your family as long as 'm here
've dealt with much
Suddenly from behind Shane's head a  appears and his ear
Shane spins in full fight stance
He sees the Duck
and relaxes
Sort of
That's Gary
He was Charles'
The duck  angrily
Confused, Shane returns to "at ease," keeping one eye on the duck
Mrs
Plummer- Call me Julie
Beat
Mrs
Plummer, 'll go secure the perimeter
'm glad you're here- 13
But Shane is already gone
: : Shane secures the area
He paces off the yard
He mounts surveillance cameras in the eaves
He attaches contact alarms in the doors and windows
Shane climbs a telephone pole, opens the circuit box and the phones
Shane, now wearing an  , crawls through the shrubs, hiding electric eyes
Nighttime -- the family eats dinner
We slowly pull out
through the kitchen window
and reveal Shane with night vision goggles on scoping the property
The phone  inside
Through the window, Julie casually answers it
Shane touches his ear transmitter and  as he walks into the house
(o
s
) Julie, it's Bill Fawcett
have some potentially good news
What is it
(o
s
) safety deposit box under Charles' name was just found in Switzerland
think it could contain
That's wonderful
This could all be over
(o
s
) There's a catch
Swiss law says only his family can access it
'm going to need you on a plane tomorrow morning
- Shane, listening to the conversation, enters- 'll be there
14
Julie and Shane share a look
/ - Julie, with her suitcase, Shane, Helga and the Kids stand in the doorway
Zoe listens to her -Pod ignoring the hug Julie gives her
Don't worry about the Kids, Helga will handle everything
(Worried:) But if there is an emergency, all the emergency numbers are on the fridge
And on the phone
And on the back door
Mom -- we'll be fine, chill
(a little choked up:) know, it's just
am a mom, it's my job to worry
love you guys
'm gonna miss you
'll be back in 48 hours
And guys, whatever Lieutenant Wolfe asks you to do
do it
Okay
ll the children nod in agreement except Zoe who pops her chewing gum bubble
(') Lieutenant,  don't want you to worry about anything except the safety of my children
Helga will take care of everything else
Don't worry
They'll be safe with me
Everything will be fine, Mrs
Plummer
Julie gets in the car and it drives away
Shane turns back to the kids who loom in the doorway
(') Tell me, are you licensed to kill
No
(she frowns) Too bad
15
Helga trudges up the path and in
- Shane, on a short ladder, screws in a surveillance camera into the corner of a wall when he hears: (o
s
) Prepare to be annihilated
Lulu
The sound of
Immediately, Shane leaps off the ladder and bounds down the stairs two at a time and into the
/  - hane rushes in -- and finds Lulu screaming and giggling in front of a
Shane shakes his head
Could you turn that dow- And Shane spies half of Todd's face peeking around a corner staring at him
(') Hey- Todd disappears
Shane spins, looks around for the
can't find him
(') Where's the baby
Without looking Lulu points
diapered Peter stands in the half full , pouring in Cheerios
Helga enters holding the wailing Tyler
Gary suddenly  by - -
Shane ducks
Shane scowls at Helga: (') You run a very loose ship
You don't like it
You're the
You do something
make bottle
elga stomps out
Shane heads down the hall, when in the corner of his eye -- he sees Shane turns off the light
He shuts off the window alarm and sneaks out silently
16
-   - The yard is littered with toys
In the middle is a He spots the Figure climbing the
Shane runs, jumps onto the trampoline
He flies in the air and latches onto the figure
They both tumble to the ground
Shane yanks off the  's hood, revealing (16) a nervous teenager
He's dazed, but alright, wearing night vision goggles
Zoe
Zoe runs out the door, setting off the
He's my boyfriend, tool
So you're the one who broke in
Zoe -- go back inside
Okay, fine
come on Scott
Shane grabs Scott by the scruff of the neck
Not with this kid
(to Todd:) You -- Gimme twenty
Freaked, Scott fumbles for his wallet and gives Shane a twenty dollar
(') meant -
Befuddled, Scott starts to   do lame push-ups
Shane grabs the back of Scott's shirt,    him in the air, spinning him away from the   house like a marionette
Scott runs off, calling out from   across the street
'll call you, Zoe
Zoe storms inside
Shane stands there, fuming
The Alarm's still blaring
The window of the house next door opens: a Korean couple,  , pop their heads out
They're arguing with each other in Korean
Shane addresses them,    with subtitles: 17
My apologies
We had an intruder simple misunderstanding
(perfect English, no accent) We speak English, Kojak
Oh
Sorry
Look, about the 2000 decibel alarm and the kleig lights and stuff
we own a bakery, so we're up kind of early
Would you mind
Sorry
Shane pulls a remote control from his pocket and clicks it
The alarm stops
Thanks a bunch
Oh, and we found this in our pool filter
Try to keep that zoo reigned in, huh baby-sitter
Mr
Chun tosses him the   and slam their window shut
Shane's about to head inside, he pulls a tiny camera phone from his pocket, and snaps a shot of the Chun's car in their driveway
- hane marches Zoe up the stairs
Loud, angry rock music blares from Todd's room
Your mother thought you were in real danger
You should have told her the truth
Who do you think you are -- my dad
Zoe starts to turn -- then suddenly spins and tries kicking him in the
But Shane catches her foot -- and whirls her away
She has to hop on one foot, to not fall over
He "hops" her down the hall to her room
18
(') Let me go
It's Saturday night
have plans
Zoe's back to her door, Shane flips her foot in the air
Zoe falls backwards into the room
Shane shuts her door
Not anymore
Shane marches back down the hall, bangs on Todd's door- (') Lights out
(o
s
) Bite me
Shane frowns, continues down the hall
He passes the (Peter and Tyler's room), where Helga is singing a lullaby: (as annoying Has something Barney might sing)
When you're down and low, lower than the floor
And you feel like you ain't got a chance
Don't make a move `til you're in the groove, and do the Peter Panda Dance
Just hop three times like a kangaroo -- She does a little "dance" that goes with the lullaby: She hops forwards three times, then "crab-walks" sideways
(') Sidestep twice, just like the crabs do
Three steps forward, one step back
She does
The Children, in bed -- laugh and laugh
(') Then quick like a turtle lie on your back
riggle like a snake `til you can't no more
he wriggles on the floor
Then jumps up, to their beds
Shane shakes his head, keeps walking- This family's in for a rude awakening
19
- The sun rises over the neighborhood, warm orange light
- Everyone is asleep
In the bedrooms, a   : Tyler snores in his crib
Peter in his bed
ulu is surrounded by stuffed animals
odd is out cold, motionless
oe is wrapped in blankets
Until ""
Zoe jumps, like she's been electrocuted
Huh
Wha--
'  - Todd sits up, disoriented, not understanding what's happening
The Whistle
Suddenly his door flies open -- and Shane strides in with a
Todd blinks groggily
-what are you doing
You're burning daylight
Move
Move
It's Sunday
(he squints at a clock) And it's six a
m
You're insane
Todd pulls the blanket over his head
Shane flips the mattress over spilling Todd to the floor
Now move it
Todd scrambles to his feet and out the door
- All the little kids are
Covering their ears
Helga runs through in hair curlers, half-asleep and angry, carrying the crying baby
20
(She curses in Romanian) Hey
Not in front of the kids
he gives him a look of disbelief
What's it matter
Nobody speaks Romanian
Usca mi-as chilotii pe crucea lu mata
Helga narrows her eyes, shocked
(She curses Again, in Romanian
) Shane's jaw drops
- The children are assembled, lined up tallest to shortest
At the end on the floor is Baby Tyler, sucking on a bottle
Shane firmly starts his Patton speech: Listen up, ladies
Your behavior is unacceptable
In order to maintain a state of safety we need to maintain a state of discipline and order
've only got one rule: Everything is done my way
No highway option
Do you copy
Do you copy
What
said -- do you
("copying" him) What
said -- do you
Do not copy me
Make up your mind
21
Shane starts to speak then thinks better, he's furious
Everyone stares blankly -- a tense silence
It's broken by the sound of a large   from the aquarium
(') eter farted
Everyone cracks up
Shane tries to maintain decorum
He reaches into his bag and unpacks a set of small high-tech with a red light and a covered button
He straps one to each Kid's wrist
Tracking devices
Now that  know  can't trust you
Never take them off
The panic button is only for emergencies
Touch that -- you better be dying, or you're dead
am not wearing that
Just because my mom's paranoid doesn't mean we have to take orders from you
He yells at her, Marine sergeant style: Let me explain how the chain of command works
tell you what to do -- and you do it
End of chain
Now 'm not gonna have time to learn your names
So you are -- (pointing) Red 1, Red 2, Red Leader, Red baby
wait, where's the older male
There were five
(mysterious) He walks like Dracula, with footsteps silent like death -- Shane looks to Zoe for translation
He's in his room
Angry, Shane bounds up the stairs
- hane marches to Todd's shut door
He tries the knob, but it's locked
Shane bangs hard on it
22
Red 4
Open this door
No answer
Shane turns away from the door and it
The wood , then  inward
The entire frame collapses
' hane charges in- It didn't have to go down like- Todd isn't there
Down the hall -- a
Oops
- The bathroom door opens, and Todd comes sauntering back
He sees Shane, the destroyed door and wall
All  need is a hammer and some plaster of Paris
can fix this
piece of the ceiling falls, hits Shane on the head
Can  get by
Embarrassed, Shane steps aside, then mutters- Here's your bracelet
If you'd been wearing it, this wouldn't have happened
Shane  it onto Todd's wrist, and head down the hall, patrolling
Zoe comes up the stairs, to her room
She stops at Todd's door -- they glare at Shane
He has to go
Todd nods in agreement
-  - hane does one-handed push ups in the living room while the Duck watches
With his other hand he loads the of the Chun's license plate into his laptop computer
His head shifts, he hears something suspicious -- the rumble of a car approaching
23
He rushes for the front door, clicks his alarm remote and opens it, just as --  -- the   connects with his face, hard
From off-screen we hear a
(
) Shane rubs his nose
Lulu screams at the top of her lungs
Shane turns, to see that Peter is chasing her, wearing a towel as a sheet
He pretends to be a ghost
Whhhoooooo
Stop it, Peter
Lulu hides behind Shane
Peter Booos again
Lulu screams
Hey, hey, good soldiers aren't afraid of anything
This house is haunted
Daddy even said so
He said there's a ghost
And then it hits Shane
His eyes light up
Really
And where is this ghost
don't know
've never seen it
- Shane walks slowly down the hall
As he walks he glides his hands along the wall, feeling, pushing, scanning the ceiling
Searching
- Todd and Zoe kneel on the stairs
They surreptitiously pour   all over the wood
Then -- a creak
Zoe whispers
Here he comes
Zoe and Todd run downstairs and hide behind the couch
24
Shane strides to the top step and  on the wall
He again, listening for hollow spaces
Nothing
Shane lifts his left foot out to take a step down
When he hears an alert from his laptop
He goes back to the living room, then turns his attention to his laptop
Chun's photo appears next to a
Shane scans it
Todd and Zoe's faces fall
The footsteps again- He's coming back- But Helga, carrying a huge laundry basket, appears, takes a step onto the stairs -- She flies down the greased stairs, her head and ass on each step, all the way down
inally,
Helga  the bottom with a mighty crash
She screams, as laundry flutters down from above
- They gulp, terrified
Uh-oh
- Establishing
- Bill and Julie, looking jet-lagged, sit across a desk from a
He seems to be about 100 years old
He's reading a  stack of paperwork with a magnifying glass, mouthing along in
It's taking him a time
They wait patiently -- til their patience runs out
As we discussed, this is an urgent matter
The Banker puts up a finger to "shush" him
Then looks back to the paperwork, then licks his finger to turn the page
He licks his finger again, but can't get the page to turn
25
He feebly gets up, and shuffles across the room to a He fills a paper cup with water and shuffles back to his desk
He dips his finger in the water to turn the page
Can't you call somebody
Do something to get us around all this paperwork
Sorry
Not in Switzerland,  can't
Bill can't stand it anymore
He jumps to his feet
(') This is absurd
If we can't get some faster service, we're going to have to file a complaint
The Banker looks at him blankly
Marcel
Another Banker, , enters
Oui
Je ne comprende pas
(to Bill and Julie:) 'm so sorry, the chief does not speak English
But  can tell you -- you will have access to the box tout-suite
As soon as your background checks clear
Thank you
How long is that
- Helga, suitcases in hand, heads to the door -- Shane tries to block her path
Peter's in the aquarium
The duck flies around,
These brats
Sugi Pula
Red Leader, remain calm -- 26
am calm
, that makes me calm
Let's not be hasty
Suddenly,
Amid the chaos, Shane moves for the phone
Helga takes the opening and runs for the door
He grabs her suitcase
As she tries to wrestle it away, Shane picks up the receiver
(') Hello--- (sees Helga crawling away) Don't even think about it
The suitcase handle breaks off, and Helga dashes for the door
Shane dives, grabbing her foot
He  her back
(') Ah, Mrs
Plummer
(covering the phone, so Julie can't hear the struggle) No no -- everything's fine
You're gonna be gone how much longer
here's a pause, the camera / as he says it: (') Five business days
elga's shoe comes off -- Helga falls forwards, and Shane falls back, against the counter
(') That is not a problem
Just doing my
He picks up his hand, that landed on a diaper
(') Duty
Helga's at the door
Shane body-checks it closed
Helga struggles to get him off
Helga chomps down on Shane's hand
(') Ah
Things are
You do what you have to do
Shane lets go
Helga scampers out the door
27
(') Take care, Mrs
Plummer
Shane hangs up the phone, as Helga makes a dash down the path to a waiting cab
- Shane chases Helga to the cab
Red Leader
command you to come back
That is a direct order
You can't leave a man behind
Helga jumps in the cab
(') () don't know the Peter Panda song
As the cab pulls away, in the rear window, Helga glares back, then does an obscene Romanian hand gesture
- His jaw drops in disbelief
He drops his head, defeated
Then -- he slowly glances up
The Korean couple is staring at him, dumbfounded
Don't worry, if she loves you, she'll come back
- Rises, takes a deep breath and strides inside
- Shane enters
to find the kids are all gloomy
The baby cries
Shane awkwardly picks the baby up
Okay, listen up
There's been a change of plans
Your mom's not coming back as soon as she thought
28
(worried) When is she coming back
Soon
In the meantime, we're just gonna have some more big fun
That's what we've been doing
But tomorrow's a school day
need a signed release for Driver's Ed
've got Brownies
Shane reacts, inundated
Whoa,
We'll take this hill one inch at a time
Only then can we rise to the challenge
All for one, and one for all
(singing) "Be all that you can be
" That's Army
'm Navy
But  appreciate your enthusiasm
nice moment
Until --
(') Tell me that was the duck
zoom in on the baby's leering face
hane quickly moves the Baby away from his body
Pure self-preservation, everyone bolts from the room
(') Hey
Nobody will help
Even Peter runs, holding his nose

- - He gulps
- Shane enters, holding out the Baby at full arm's length
He lowers Tyler onto a changing pad, takes a deep breath, then pulls out  and a
Using the tools as chopsticks, he cautiously unfastens the diaper
And then -- it flops open
SShane , repelled
The things  do for my country
Shane tries approaching -- he can't do it
Aghast, he looks around for a solution
Then: Shane picks up the Baby and dips the bottom half in the toilet, then , over and over and over
- Shane patrols the hall, making sure all the doors and windows are locked
Lulu is in her pj's
hand tugs on Shane's shirt, he looks down to see Lulu
Hi
Zoe thinks you look like the Hulk think you're cute
(unsure how to respond
) Thank you
Lulu doesn't go away, she just stares at him, it starts making Shane uncomfortable
Do you know Kung Fu
Affirmative
Did you ever punch someone so hard that their head came off
hane walks away from Lulu
She follows
Shane is again twirling the  in his fingers
Lulu follows at his heels, like a puppy
30
(') What's that medal for
None of your business
'll trade you a SpongeBob button for it
Shane walks room to room, pulling down the shades on every window
(') Is that so people can't hurt us
He bends down to her level, and tries to sound sweet: think -- it's time for you take a nappy- poo, in beddibye land, little girl
Lulu looks at him, like he's an idiot
Do  look like 'm five to you
Lulu sulks off to bed, and shuts off her light
All the lights are out, all the kids asleep
Shane breathes a sigh of relief, and patrols
-  - The Kids are dressed for school
On the table in front of each place is a tan
The kids sit down at their designated spots, confused by the 's ( ) in front of them
What are you waiting for
Dig in
Todd, Lulu and Zoe all tear open their bags
Todd pulls out a bag of    and a Snickers bar
Zoe pulls out a bag of   and some matches
Lulu takes out a bag of turkey slices and a coffee packet
Shane smiles, proud of his accomplishment
The Kids stare at "breakfast," dubious
(') Don't worry,  can get lots more of those
And 've survived off this stuff for months
31
Like 'm really gonna eat all those carbs
Shane turns to address them: Okay, ladies
Your mama -- is not here to take care of you now
So -- here's how it's gonna be
We're gonna pull together, all for one, one for all
If  say in, you stay in, if  say out, you go out
Peter stands in his chair, dancing
Ba ba do the hokie pokey
did not say at ease
Peter's eyes fill with tears
He's only two, he doesn't have any idea what you're talking about
don't have any idea what you're talking about
Shane sighs
Lulu asks Shane: Can you kill a man with your bare hands
You play too many video games
(then:) Yes
can cross my eyes
Wanna see
Negative
Lulu crosses her eyes at Shane, then at Tyler -- who at the top of his lungs
Shane turns to Lulu
Tyler hates it when  do that
Peter starts bawling, too
He runs away, crying
The table cloth is yanked to the floor
And the phone rings
Shane answers, trying to hear over the screaming
32
Plummer residence
yes,  know it's Monday
Oh
Thank you, sir
He hangs up
Zoe smiles at him, innocently
Who was that
Your vice principal
He said if you're late again, you and Todd are expelled
He wants to see you in his office
With your legal guardian
- The garage door opens, dramatically unveiling Shane
He's wearing Tyler in a
Across his chest, he's got a bandoleer of baby-bottles and juice boxes
Shane can't hide his contempt as he sees: Julie's bumper sticker declares "World's Greatest Mom

It just doesn't add up

always said these kids didn't need a baby sitter, they needed a parole officer
Looks like Mrs
Plummer finally listened
He glares at Shane, and the Kids: Shane sits with Tyler in a Snuggle, holding Peter on a harness, as he plays on the floor
The Kids are seated around him, mortified

Well, whatever work you can get

Top to bottom,  thru 12
You're in my house now, boy

The Kids crack up
Murney is furious
(') She's missed twenty-two Driver's Ed classes
Out of twenty-three
They're the worst students in my school
' Your school
Murney grimaces as    (early 30's) enters
She's attractive, assured, tough
He withers
Good morning kids
What are you doing in my office, Murney

Very little

He exits, fuming
The rings
Red 1, Red 2
Get moving
The teens hustle off to their classes
Shane checks his -- two little red  move away
Good
Principal Claire eyeballs him
staring him up and down, as he casually holds the three kids
So
You're the new baby-sitter
Bodyguard
You see, Mrs
Plummer called my captain, she thought the kids needed - It's okay, Lieutenant,  was briefed of the situation by Mrs
Plummer
She told me all about you
She notices   tattoo on his upper arm
Claire sees this -- and suddenly reacts, impressed
(') Lieutenant, huh
You with "The Teams
" (Shane nods
) Petty Officer Third Class Claire Nelson at your service
You're kidding
Four years at Naval base Coronado
The Service paid for my college
35
Shane stares not sure whether to believe
On the spot, Claire looks nervously around
She lifts her pants leg
revealing a tiny   on her ankle
"Honor, Courage
Commitment"
That's the way  live my life, and the way  run my school
Can't be too careful
So
Permission to stick around and keep eyes on the kids
She smiles
Permission granted
Welcome aboard
Just try not to frighten the children
No one will even notice 'm here
: -12  - - Shane, dead serious, (Tyler in Snuggle) is riding the see- saw in the school's playground
Peter rides on the other side with a group of , to balance Shane
Shane types on his laptop:
picture of Claire in a Naval uniform pops up as well as her stats
Clean as a whistle
Shane closes the computer, picks up a pair of binoculars
as Shane goes from window to window of the school: Zoe is glaring at him through the window from her seat in a class
Todd, sitting in the back row of a class, yanks his hood over his head
Lulu waves from 2nd Grade, delighted
Along line of   wait for the seesaw
(') Back off
Official Business
36
: Shane stands with his Baby snuggle
Peter is running in circles around him on his harness, like a tether ball
He checks his tracking device
- : Five hundred students eat at long tables
Zoe, with a group of  , turns her back to him embarrassed
Todd, in line to get lunch, does the same
Lulu sees Shane and waves
Shane puts down his binoculars
He turns to the person in front of him, with stern intensity
Give up now
Save us both a world of pain
Now -- last time: Open the hanger, Black Hawk coming in
Reveal: Shane is talking to Tyler, in his safety seat -- trying to get him to eat
Beside Shane, Peter is destroying a sandwich with animal crackers
(') Open in  minus three, two, one
Tyler gurgles, ignoring him
Shane sighs
Principal Claire sits next to Shane with her lunch tray
What would you say is the secret with kids, Mr
Wolfe
Show no weakness
'll drink to that
(she toasts, with milk
) Shane
Can  call you Shane
Sure
So
When you agreed to serve your country,  bet you didn't know you'd be serving creamed bananas to one year olds, huh
Shane gives her a look
Principal Claire smiles
37
Hey --  out rank you, you know
Not here, you don't
You're on dry land, lieutenant
(she looks at his chair) Well, not so dry where you're sitting, guess
Shane sees that Tyler is pouring his juice Box all over Shane's pants
He yanks Tyler away from him
Oh, man
Tyler starts to cry -- but Shane stops him from crying by making a funny face
Tyler laughs
Claire smiles
Don't take this personally -- but you're pretty good at this
Seriously, 'm impressed
whole day, and all three Plummer's stayed out of trouble
That's
unusual
Suddenly there's a huge crash around the corner, and the sound of Students in an uproar
Shane hands Tyler off to the Principal and leaps over the table
- - Students are in a ring, cheering, as four  in Wrestling Jackets hold Todd
One reaches down and gives Todd a "wedgy" then another  punches him
Todd slips out of their hold and decks the Wrestler
Murney is watching, but not stopping it
Zoe, in the crowd, cheers Todd on: Kick his butt, Todd
Shane and Claire push through the Students
As soon as they see the Principal, the crowd freezes
Who started this
Silence
Then vice principal Murney steps forward
He did
(Todd) 38
Todd started a fight with five students at once
Shane turns to Todd, and "punches fists" with him, impressed
The kid's mixed up
Look at him
If  catch anyone on the team fighting again, next week's tournament is off don't care who starts it
Murney smirks, and gives her a "'ll handle it" wink
You heard the lady
Any more fighting and there'll be no more wrestling
Personally think that's a little harsh
Boys'll be boys
(low, to Todd:) `Scept for Plummer here
Todd lunges at him
Shane effortlessly grabs Todd and Judo   -- Todd lands on his feet, sticking the landing
No one is more Ssurprised than Todd and Shane
Nice moves, man
The Bell rings, the crowd breaks up
Murney approaches Shane
Pretty slick, Frogman -- 'm a black belt myself
'why they asked me to coach the wrestling team
Murney makes a loud Kung Fu  and throws a punch, stopping an inch from Shane's head
Shane doesn't flinch
(') See -- total control
Maybe you could stop by practice, we'd show the boys how a couple of pros do it, what do you say
Come on, promise 'll go easy on you
Sorry, sir
'm on duty
39
Oh, yeah
That's right
forgot you had to baby-sit
Maybe some other time then
Shane puts an arm over Todd's shoulder
Todd shakes him off and heads to class
Murney snickers to Claire: (') Looks like pretty boy there's all bark and no bite
Don't even think it, Murney
He'd kill you so fast,  wouldn't even have time to get my camera
- 2:55 Shane looks exhausted
Peter is asleep in his shoulder, Tyler is crying, as he keeps watch
The Principal strolls up
Another day, another dollar twenty, minus taxes
aren't you gonna change him
'd love to, for one who'll eat, and not cry
That's not what  mean, Lt
Then Shane smells what she means -- Tyler's diaper is full
Shane recoils in disgust, holding Tyler out like a grenade
Oh -- change him
Roger that
Uh
Panicked, he pushes Tyler towards the Principal
Sirnosir
Not my job
But
Instructions are right on the box
Bathroom's down the hall
Have fun
40
Just then, an alarm in his Jacket
He looks at his tracker: it's flashing  3  3
Shane hands off Peter and Tyler to the Principal
Emergency
2ND   - Shane runs down the hall, following his tracking device
It leads him to a door
He bursts though it, doing a shoulder roll
2ND   - 2ND  are sitting on the floor
Lulu is in front of the class, with the Panic Button in her hand
The board reads:
Shane lands in fight stance -- the Class applauds
Next to Lulu is a very upstaged with a
Lulu sticks her tongue out at him
See
My nanny can kick your nanny's butt
Shane is furious, but the   rings
At that moment, his Tracker Alarm sounds again
He looks: -    : Two  labeled  1 and  2, are heading away from the school fast
- Shane runs with Lulu through the mob of Kids
He hands her to the Principal
Thanks
-12  - Shane dives into the Minivan
The  on the tracker are headed North
He speeds away after them
- The   on his tracker are side by side, racing down the road ahead of Shane
They make a sharp right
Shane makes a right, almost tipping the minivan
He blasts through a red light
41
- He turns a corner -- a   surrounds the site
He leaps out of the minivan
He looks at the tracker: Zoe and Todd are dead ahead, through the fence
- Two   workers are standing on the other side of the plywood wall -- Shane  out one entire section, and charges through
What hell do you think you're doing
He turns around, to see several  , all brandishing tools
Tell me where the kids are and 'll let you all live
Buddy, you're about to get a beat down
Three Workers rush him
Shane easily takes them out
The remaining Workers give Shane a scared look -- then
- He's alone
He catches his breath, then checks his tracker
Todd and Zoe's  are coming from a
Shane pries off the manhole cover
He looks down
- It's dark and dank
No sweat
Shane lowers himself down
- Shane lands shoulder deep in
He winces, then checks the tracker -- the  are , feet away
Shane trudges through the river of muck
Red 1
Red 2
It's horrific
The
He's almost there
He splashes around a corner -- then gasps -- he sees the blinking lights below the surface
He takes a deep breath and dives under
He comes up for air with  and '
note is tied to them: "Ha

-   - Principal Claire sits with the Kids in the living room
From outside, they hear the front door open, and the sound of ,  footsteps
Then the door swings open, revealing Shane, looking like a Swamp Creature
Everyone gasps, then covers their noses
enters behind Shane
Todd stiffens
Zoe fixes her hair
The Cop looks at them
14 year old Male, weird hair
16 year old female
Ditto

The Cop turns to Shane, with a smirk
(') In the future, use our nonemergency number
That's the one to call if nobody's fleein' or bleedin'
The Cop leaves, Zoe checks him out as he goes
Shane are you okay
(eerily calm:) Just fine, thank you
Covering her nose
The smell is
should probably get going then
If you need anymore help
Call
She practically  as she passes him
Shane looks around at Scott and Zoe, he doesn't say anything, but with his hand he makes a "my eyes on you" gesture
- Shane is in the shower
He pours an entire bottle of over himself
- Shane  his clothes in the barbecue
43
- Tyler is in a high-chair, Peter rocks in a cradle-swing
Shane enters, in just a towel
He sees on the fridge; Helga'   -- all junk food
He looks at it, cringing in disgust, before he notices: Sitting around the table are Lulu's entire   - - a dozen little girls in uniforms, they're staring at him
The Brownies applaud, and whistle
oo hoo
Hubba hubba
Shane covers up and leaps into the Family Room, pulling Lulu after him
- Who are those people
It's my troop, it's Monday
Monday, Wednesday and Saturday are troop nights
(
) Get rid of them
can't
Everybody's parents go out on troop nights
They won't be home `til ten
Mom's our den mother
Lulu starts to sniffle, close to tears
(') Tonight we're supposed to sell cookies
Selling cookies isn't imperative to my mission
We have to
If we don't sell enough cookies, we can't go the Jamboree, and if we can't go to the Jamboree
(whispers:) Come on, Shane
You gotta help me out
They already think 'm a loser
And it's not like  have any other friends, cause mom never lets me out of her sight
44
Lulu's about to burst into tears
Shane sighs
- Shane, back in "uniform," paces in front of the Brownie Troop
They are assembled, at attention, Indian Style
Alright, ladies
Here's how it's gonna be
Tonight, 'm gonna be your den -- commander
That means if you want to live to see tomorrow, do as  say The Brownies stare art him in stunned silence
Den Mother
'm scared of you
Good
Now -- wait here
- The Brownies are in the living room, unpacking boxes of cookies, getting ready to go
Zoe's on the phone
yeah, he's a total psycho
think mom found him from one of those Tough Love boot camps or something
Shane blows passed her, revving a cordless

He's not just locking them -- he's '  - Shane's finishing up the last window
This is totally cruel and unusual
You can't do this -- we could run out of air
Shane lifts her window so it's open a  , then drills it into place
Shane ushers the Troop out the door, then loads Peter and Tyler into   -- one attached to his front, the other to his back
Shane closes the front door and attaches a "Club" lock to it
45
- Shane Loads the brownies and toddlers into the minivan
As the minivan pulls out of the driveway, the camera up to
' : Inside, Zoe picks up the phone, hits speed-dial
he's got us on lock-down, it's like Oz or something
No, not munchkin Oz -- Oz
(she listens:) Hm
dunno if that's a good idea, Scott
-   - Shane pulls the minivan into the crowded parking lot -- the Brownies are all singing 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall at the top of their lungs
- Shane (double-Snuggled) helps the Brownies set up a card table to display their cookies
gotta get supplies
can see you through the window, but if anything happens
(flashing her bracelet) know
- Shane watches the Brownies on the store's monitor, as he pushes a cart into the store
He looks around at the bright, colorful boxes of Children's Cereals, Rainbow Fruit Roll-Ups, Snack packs looks familiar -- nothing even looks like food
He sees: a huge, 100 pack   of
He smiles
Tyler looks at him -- "what are you, nuts
" - The Brownies are trying to sell the cookies, but they're very shy
blow passed them without even noticing them
One of the Brownies spots something
46
Oh no
they're back
: In a shot out of Reservoir Dogs, we see who she means:  group of bad ass, chubby
They're headed straight towards the cookie table, menacingly
(to another Scout) Hey Skeever, what's stinky and floats `til you flush `em
2ND Brownies
The Scouts cackle
The Ugly Scout yanks a box of cookies away from Lulu
He rips it open, dumping the cookies on the ground and grinding Uthem with his foot
This is Troop 16 territory
How are we supposed to sell raffle tickets when this place reeks of your skanky cookies
2ND , before  get my face punching badge on you
The Brownies take off running, clutching their boxes
One of the Scouts grabs Lulu -- she tugs and tugs, but can't get away
Finally, the Cub Scout takes her
He laughs, and lets her go
The Cub Scouts high-five
- Shane heads to the Brownie's table -- but Lulu and the Brownies are gone
In their place are the Chubby Scouts
Where are my troops
haven't seen anybody, you Skeever
2ND Nope
You wanna buy a raffle ticket
We're trying to win
22's
Around his neck, Shane's monitor starts beeping
Shane takes off running in the direction of the signal
47
- Shane runs up to the minivan
The Brownies are huddled behind it, trembling
What happened
(No one answers) Well
Those boys over there broke our cookies
Shane eyes the Cub Scouts
Dead serious: Well then -- 'm afraid  have to eliminate them
If  don't come back -- avenge my death
He heads toward the Scouts
The Brownies scream
No
Shane stops
He bends down, and points at Lulu's Panic button
He firmly tells Lulu, who's close to tears: This is not a toy
'm here to protect you
Not cookies
Get in the car, we're going home
You can't take us home yet, you're supposed to take us to dinner

Brownies are running around, playing video games and skee ball
Shane's watching Peter, in the   , while he holds Tyler in the Snuggle
The Manager approaches Shane
Anything elsh  can do for you
In a big glass (he shows him)   This much ice
this much cyanide
The Manager laughs, but the headgear seems to hurt his face when he smiles
How `bout a re-fill on that pischer of Mischer Pibb
What
(gesturing:) Pischer of Mischer Pibb
Mischer Pibb
Frustrated, the Manager picks up a pitcher and exits
Lulu approaches, she grabs Shane by the sleeve and drags him over to the stand up Mortal Kombat game
Let's fight
'm watching your brother
pressed two player
thought you liked combat
Unless you're scared
Shane doesn't like the sound of that
He steps up to the machine
He cracks his knuckles, stretches
Then he takes a joy stick
He checks over his shoulder -- Peter's happily splashing about in the plastic balls
: they each select a fighter
Lulu picks a small female character
Shane picks a man who looks They begin, Lulu screams out with her fighter, in unison: / Prepare to be annihilated
49
She leaps over Shane in a somersault and throws a throwing stars
Then kicks him in the head repeatedly
That's not fair
Nobody can jump thirty feet
The Hulk can
That wasn't a documentary
The second round starts, Brownies have gathered around to watch
Lulu's fighter does a series of kicks
Shane can't even get one punch in -- she pins him to the ground, kneels on his head, then kicks him in the face
Shane is taking it really seriously
He's really mad
(') This isn't fair
My joystick's broken
You wanna switch
They switch sides
Round three starts
Lulu's fighter picks up Shane's in the air, spins her, then cracks her in half over his knee
and then a kick in the face
(re: the Snuggle) You don't have a baby on your chest
Lulu's having fun now, she's just avoiding Shane's fighter, dancing, jumping, while he pounds the buttons, swinging and missing
Shane's really fuming
You're not even trying
Too slow
come on -- take a shot
oops too slow
swing and a miss
She keeps dancing
It's really annoying
Shane's working the joy stick hard, slamming buttons, but he can't hit her
He is 'd
She does a very obnoxious
50
(') In your face
am the greatest hand-to- hand combat champion in the entire world
Shane screams and
Sparks fly
Shane looks around to see if the staff noticed
He and the Brownies sneak away, leaving the sizzling machine, its joystick dangling by its wires
-   - Zoe's on the phone, the Zhouse is quiet
Mom -- stop worrying
: - (  ) 'm a mom, it's my job to worry
Seriously, everything's cool
The guy's just a control freak
It's only a few more days
hate leaving you, but you know  have to do this love you

Don't worry, we're okay
Tonight 'm just doing homework -- in my cell

She turns to Scott, who doesn't seem concerned at all
Dude, this is outta hand
Who are all these people
Jus' ma peeps
And the folks who read my 51
Zoe rolls her eyes, then notices a   , who's throwing mustard covered baloney slices at the ceiling, where they stick with a satisfying
Dude, not cool
- The Plummer House: - Its a huge party: the place is , kids everywhere
- Teenagers come and go through the kitchen's
- Shane (Tyler in Snuggle), loads Brownies into the minivan, counting them
Barking at them like Marines: Move, move, move
Go go
- Shane drives, the Brownies are singing 99 Bottles
again
Suddenly, a look of horror comes across Shane's face
he spins the minivan in a 180 and floors it
-  - Shane (Tyler in Snuggle) bursts in, the Brownies follow
We see what he forgot: , still happily playing in the pool of plastic balls
The Manager is watching him
figured you'd come back for him -- they almost always do
Inexcusable, to leave a man behind like that
Relax, we once found a kid in the ball pool when we opened in the morning -- Shane wades into the ball pool and pulls Peter out, which is fine, except that he's
(') , Whoa
Not okay, freestyling in the ball pool -- not okay
52
Shane grimaces
He holds his breath, and goes down for the diaper
He disappears under the balls -- for a long time
The Manager and the Brownies share a concerned look
He's still down there
Silence
Should we send someone in after him
He surfaces, gasping
He's holding the diaper, out away from him
He charges across the room with the diaper
Clear out
And he bursts out the other doors, at a full run
- Shane is exhausted, as he pulls up in the Minivan
He gets out -- and groans in disbelief
It's insanity: blasts, gyrating  everywhere, chugging drinks, making out, peeing in the bushes, jocks throwing footballs
Reeling, Shane takes Lulu, Peter and Tyler up the path
He protectively guides them past the craziness -- until a football suddenly  by
Outraged, Shane snatches it mid-air -- then  the ball
hane gives a blood-curdling stare
Party's over
The jocks flinch, scared, then
Shane unlocks the lock off the door
-  - Inside is worse, a total wreck
Zoe's dancing with Scott
Shane drags the needle across a record at the
's turntables
Everyone recoils from the horrible sound
No one leaves until this house is spotless
want to be able to eat off the floor
The latrine
Hell,  wanna be able to eat in the kitchen
Nervous glances -- then everybody suddenly  for the back
Shane is confused, trying to understand
53
then he intuitively dashes past them
He's scoping the surroundings
windows
vents
The doggy door
Scott is halfway through the doggy door when Shane grabs his ankles and yanks him back in
Shane holds Scott upsidedown by his ankles
(') Oh no you don't
Now, we're gonna do this my way -- no highway option
Just then:      drops from the ceiling, sticking to the  of Shane's head
Shane's eyes narrow, he takes it off, trying to maintain his dignity
He fumes
(') Start swabbing, ladies
He hands Scott the mop
Scott gulps - and starts mopping
: Miserable  scrub
In a bathroom, Scott and Zoe, in Playtex gloves, furiously clean
Scott scrubs the toilet with Pinesol as the Duck swims in the top of the toilet
This is officially the worst party ever
It was  idea
don't even know most of these losers
/ - Shane inspects the house, as kids clean
Shane wipes a finger down the sofa
Clean
He lifts the sofa, and rubs his finger
He holds it up to a
residue
The Kid quickly starts cleaning again
reorganizes a stack of '
Shane goes over them, straightening -- then he notices something
He pulls out a : It is a home-burned disk, labeled with a Sharpie
It reads:
Oh my god
: - Two    watch, through binoculars
They see Shane find the , and walk out of sight
54
/ - Shane quickly tucks the  into his pocket
: - long line of exhausted party-goers files out
Scott's the last one to leave
- Shane works his way through the house
It's : counter tops glisten, furniture polished
It looks like Better Homes and Gardens
He heads upstairs
Zoe blows past him -- into the bathroom, where she throws up
Shane sits down, outside the bathroom door
Thanks a lot, Rambo
My friends will never come here again
Those people aren't your friends
They show no respect for you or your house
Because you have no respect for yourself
do too respect myself
ueasy, she pukes again
Shane hands her a handkerchief
You got barf on your tank top
(Announces:) Company, downstairs
He walks down the hall, Zpounding on doors
You're not my dad
Shane stops
Lulu and Todd step into the hall
Zoe gets up, shaky and furious, and screams in Shane's face
(') We hate you, you hate us
You're like a robot
Why don't you just leave us alone
Silence
Lulu's crying, Todd picks her up
Shane stands, helpless
After a beat
55
You're right, Red 1
'm not the man for this job
Shane --
In all my years  have never been treated with such disrespect
Not even from the enemy
Don't worry, as soon as your mom comes back, 'm gone
Suddenly -- the power goes out
(') Now what
(sighs, tired) It's Scott
Puberty
talking doesn't do any good
Go to your rooms
Suddenly,  , all in black  in through the window
Shane spins in fight-stance
(') (to the kids:) Go
Terrified, Zoe and Todd scoop up the kids and rush down the hall
The Ninjas pull a retractable
Wielding them with great skill
It takes all of Shane's skill to fend them off -- the three fight, close-quarters and fast
Until Shane pulls down attic's spring-loaded and clocks a Ninja with it
He goes down, but Shane is  from behind by the other
The Ninjas attack, fiercely -- they're good
Their Kendo staffs hiss with a powerful
The Ninjas knock Shane backwards down the stairs
-- hand it over
They leap down after him, pounding him with their staffs, knocking him into
56
- There are   -- like a tornado hit a -- Shane fends the Ninjas off
He spots a  , and grabs it, facing them, fiercely
They step back
Okay -- who wants some
Shane swings the bat down on a Ninja's head: It's a whiffle bat, it makes a silly thunk
Shane and the Ninja share a surprised look -- then the Ninjas charge
Shane fends them off with his Whiffle bat
With his foot, he picks up a   -, and uses them both to fend off blows
It rattles and pops as he fights with both Toys -- until a Ninja breaks them with one blow
Shane sees a
He jumps up onto a shelf and grabs it
He pulls the string, and swings the plastic disk like a deadly bolo
The rooster goes
, he hits a Ninja in the head
He swings the Farmer John like a bull whip -- until a Ninja knocks the shelf over
Shane crashes down, toys fly, several  hit the floor
They echo the fight: Ow
Ow
Shane sees: The Ninjas are wearing only Ninja socks -- no shoes
He grabs a barrel of , and flings them all over the floor
The Ninjas move towards him -- the Legos and Jacks dig into their feet
/ Ow
Ow ow
Crap
The Ninjas fight as they hobble around, avoiding Legos, Shane runs to the changing table, then violently squeezes at a , blinding him
Shane hangs in the doorway and swings at them,  a Ninja in the chest
The Ninja  through the window
he other Ninja looks up, fearful
Suddenly he grabs a bottle of
He sprays it in Shane's face
The room fills with a
- 57
He squints, blinded
The cloud dissipates
and Shane sees he's now alone
He runs to the broken window
: The Ninja's are long gone
Shane bangs the window sill, disappointed to have lost them
- Composing himself, Shane approaches Zoe's door
He quietly knocks
Kids
It's safe
You can open up
long pause -- then the door creaks open
The kids run out and hug Shane with all their strength, bawling
Todd and Zoe enter, terrified
Shane isn't sure what to do
Then, he hugs Peter and Lulu
He really hugs them
Please don't leave us Shane
'm not going anywhere
He hugs them, even Zoe is crying and hugging Shane
'm sorry for giving you a hard time
Shhh
It's okay
Who were they
What did they want
They're looking for a program, that your father invented
So Mom's not paranoid
There really are people out to get us
He takes out the  labeled
They're not after you
They want this
But nothing's gonna happen to you, as long as 'm here
And 'm not going anywhere
58
The kids shudder, relieved
They hug him tighter
He looks Zoe, eye to eye
He dries her tears: (') But  can't do this without your help, okay
We need a little more cooperation here
(the Kids nod) Tell you what -- let's start over
From now on, you listen to me, and do what  say
(to Zoe and Todd:) And
'll listen to you too
Deal
Truce -- okay
Zoe and Todd nod
Shane offers his hand to shake
They shake -- then they hug him, too
- Shane and the Kids sit around Shane's computer
Shane slips the Ghost  in the disc drive, pushes play -- 'mon c'mon c'mon
- - The  comes on: it's
"Unchained Melody
" And then, : Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze at a pottery wheel
Shane is furious -- a long pause
Then
Zoe laughs: she can't help it, it's been a long night
Then, the other kids join in
Soon, even Shane is laughing too: the telephone  -- they all jump, startled
Zoe answers it, all smiles, she tries to play it cool and not frighten her mother: Hey mom we're fine, absolutely nothing happened you should worry about
Nope
Shane takes the phone
Mrs
Plummer
two men tried to get into the house tonight
: - Oh my god
59
No - it's okay
They're gone, everyone's fine
They were looking for , but they didn't find it
You have any luck
Well, yes and no
We found something in the box
But we're not sure what it is
Bill thinks it's part of the
It looks like some kind of "key"
We just don't know what its for
She holds up the strange, metal two pronged
(') The good news is 'll be home in two days, as soon as the customs paperwork clears
(very genuine) So soon
We were just starting to have fun
Don't worry -- we'll be just fine
- Early morning, students run in to school
The minivan pulls up, and Shane emerges with the five kids
gotta warn you guys: From now on, 'm gonna be sticking even closer
'  - The  shows the children how to dye Easter eggs
on Lulu, making a mess of an egg
She smiles
on Shane, squashed at a little desk
He dips an egg in some purple dye
- Driver's Ed
An obstacle course with cones
Zoe nervously drives a small sedan, a crazed  next to her
He is gesticulating, , reacting each time she  the gas, then ,  the gas, then
Shane stands off to the side, shaking his head
Peter and Tyler are tight in their Snuggles
60
'  - The  hangs a series of cute "Turkey Hand" drawings above the blackboard (the kind where your fingers make the feathers)
She hangs one of a  , and smiles at Shane, who sits in the back, sunglasses on
Shane nods, "yeah,  know it's good
" Then
(  :) Will Shane Wolfe please report to Vice Principal Murney in the gym
Lulu's classmates all chant, in unison: Ooooooooh
(You're in trouble
) - Shane enters
Zoe sits in a folding chair, mortified
She is holding a broken-off
Murney stands, Principal Claire next to him
They look concerned
Don't worry
So, she wrecked a driver's Ed
car -- she'll pay for the damage
That
Lady drivers, what do you expect
No, it's not that -- it's the boy
Red two
mean Todd
Claire nods
Shane gives Zoe a look
Zoe shrugs
Ordinarily  would wait for his mother to return
but -- 'm a bit concerned, and 'm not sure what to do
Has he been skipping class
Well -- yes
He does always miss sixth period
But this
Murney calls into the hallway
Todd enters
Shane stops, in shock: Todd's long hair is all shaved off, he now has a bleach blonde  , giving him a "skinhead" look
61
This is how he showed up to practice
And that's not all
was doing a little re- con in his locker
and  found this: Murney hands Shane a book and Shane flips through it
It's a book of photographs of
Shane scowls
(') If he'd had Hustler or something, boys will be boys -- but this is just sick
He's not a
It's certainly not normal
(pulls Shane aside
) See if you can talk to the boy
Find out what's going on
Shane shakes his head: Todd is worse than he thought
Todd and Zoe stand to go, and Shane walks them out
The   is assembled, stretching
They snicker and shake their heads at Todd, as he passes
Shane walks the kids out, and Murney chases after him
hope you won't go light on him -- that whole family's no good, if you ask me
'll talk to him
You're a good man, Shane
Bet you're a hell of a fighter on the mats, huh
(Shane ignores him, and keeps walking
) Maybe sometime we oughta strap up, we'll give these boys a treat
He "fake-punches" one of his Boys -- who flinches like Murney has maybe hurt him a couple times
Murney laughs
Another time, maybe
It's a date then
'll show you a couple moves
promise  won't hurt you
62
Shane walks away
Without warning, Murney lets out a Kung Fu , and leaps at Shane, kicking him in the , Shane trips forwards to his knees
Murney tells his team: (') See that
You never know when your adversary is going to strike
Did you kick me in the back
Is there a footprint on my jacket
Shane dusts off his back, and leaves
Come on Frogman
Don't be a sissy
Shane turns back
It looks like Shane might fight, but instead he takes a deep breath, and leaves
Murney shakes his head, and snickers to his Team
- The minivan pulls up, with Shane and all the Plummers piled in
Shane parks, Todd runs towards the house
Shane holds Todd back by the arm
Wait Todd,  want to talk to you
odd yanks his arm away and runs into the house
'  - Shane knocks on Todd's door
Nothing
He enters
The window is wide open, Shane checks his window alarm -- there's a   stuck to it, keeping the contact, so the alarm didn't go off
Smart kid
Shane looks out the window -- far down the block, he can see Todd, running around the corner
Shane hops out the window
He sees Zoe, peering out her window
(') Zoe, you're in charge
If anyone gets within forty clicks of the perimeter, signal me
Keep all doors sealed, do your homework, preheat the oven, and make sure Lulu brushes her teeth
63
He starts to shut the window, but the Duck leaps up on the sill
(') You want in or out
The Duck leaps out
Shane screws the window shut
On the corner, Shane sees Todd climbing on to a
Shane picks a '  up off the front lawn
It's pink, with a flowered basket
It's small for him, but he hops on and pedals furiously after the bus
- Shane, on the girl-bike, pedals after the bus
few watch him pass, curiously
He nods back, tough
-
-  - The bus stops in a rundown neighborhood Todd hops off the bus
Shane's arrives a moment later, dripping sweat
He stashes the bike behind a mailbox
Shane'
: At the entrance to the old warehouse, Todd meets up with three other  , they're dressed in brown   , they head inside
Shane follows them, stealthily
- Shane follows the Hitler Youth into a large room, set up with folding chairs
He hides in a dark corner
Todd and the Hitler Youth enter, and take seats
in a scarf walks out, and stands in front of them
Shane watches as the  addresses the Hitler Youth
Alright
All my Nazis are finally here
Okay,  want all of you at attention
The Nazis stand at attention
Shane is horrified
(') And on stage left - (he yells) need my Von Trapps
hane watches
as a group of blonde , all dressed in lederhosen as the    family enter, and join the "Nazis
" There's also a few , a , and a
The Creepy Man is, in fact, a good natured, slightly foppish
64
Okeydokey
Starting from where we left off Gimme Rolf and Liesl -- let's give You are Sixteen a run up der flagpole
Todd heads up to the stage, the Director arranges him and the    (40ish) into position
An begins on piano, Todd sings, remarkably well: You wait little girl, on an empty stage/for fate to turn the light on/your life little girl, is an empty page/that men will want to write on
/ To write on
You are sixteen, going on seventeen
Shane bursts into laughter
His whole face lights up for the first time ever
Todd and Liesl dance
Todd is good, but nervous
He attempts a spinning kick, but he slips, and hits the stage, clutching his ankle
He gets up, and limps to the seats
The Director walks onto the stage, upset
He looks up, to heaven: Baby Jesus, have  done some unspeakable evil that  deserve to be saddled with the world's worst production of Sound of Music
(he shouts, at the cast:) We open in a week
The set's not finished
The cast is a bunch of clumsy goats -- every kick ball change would make Bob Fosse dig himself out of the earth, so he could have a heart attack again
'm sorry
'll get it right
None of you will ever get it right
Which is why,  quit
He throws down his script
The Cast is stunned
(') And with that, he exits stage right
end scene
65
And, on his own cue
he exits stage right, in a huff
The entire cast looks to Todd, fuming
Shane jumps up from his hiding place, startling everybody
Everyone steps back
Todd is terrified
Shane kneels down beside Todd
He closes his eyes, and begins rubbing his hands together like Mr
Miyagi
You gonna fix him
No
My hands are freezing
Shane grabs Todd's ankle hard and unceremoniously it, and yanks him to his feet
'm not going to quit
hate wresting
(Todd shuts up) Would you listen, just once
Look,  don't know a hell of a lot about this kinda stuff, but
You're good
lot to learn, but with hard work, discipline -- you could make a go of this
but what about Murney
That guy's an idiot
Todd smiles, relieved
They sit on the edge of the stage
(') "Sound of Music" is a great show
My dad took me to see it when  was a kid
Shane smiles wistfully
Todd relaxes
You don't seem like the musical type
Come on
Julie Andrews was hot
What if
girls'll think 'm
weird or something
66
You know what girls think is weird
Wrestling
Men in leotards pinning each other to the floor
've never understood that
Chicks dig guys who can dance
Doesn't matter now anyway
show's off
it's over
Shane looks at the Cast, they look pretty glum as they pack up their costumes
Todd looks devastated -- only a moment after Shane saw him happier than ever
Shane straightens up, grabbing Todd by the shirt collar
--
Everyone looks around, they're not sure what to do
off Shane's glare, they quickly assemble on stage
(') , There's some mumbling
Liesl chimes in
We don't have a director
Shane shakes his head
No director
have directed rescue missions in Afghanistan
've directed numerous snatch and grabs in countries who's names you are not allowed to know
have choreographed multi-pronged amphibious landings and stealth air attacks
(full of bravado) Do you think  have the stomach to whip this production into shape, or not
Everyone nods
Todd looks up at Shane
He smiles
Yes
67
/ -   - Shane's patrolling the hallway
He hears Zoe in her room,  something, angrily
He peeks in -- just as Zoe  her cell-phone into the wall, furious
What's up
(embarrassed) Nothing
It's stupid
Scott
called him in his room, another girl picked up the phone
know it's no big deal don't know why  let it get to me
don't see what you see in this guy
It's just nice to think someone's thinking about you, you know
(He nods) It won't happen again
No wait
What are you gonna do
You're not gonna hurt him are you
Promise you won't touch him
Okay
promise
won't touch him
Shane exits
He turns out the light
'  - Shane tucks Lulu into bed
Tell me a story
Shane looks at her surprised
He sits on the bed
Stumped
Then he starts: Okay
Let's see
Once there was a family of Elves
() 68
(') One day, the little Elf family -- Uh
Went into the magic forest
To find a secret gnome
facility, where gnomes where turning mushrooms into
Uranium
The elves had to go in and take it out
Why
They were ordered to
By the Elf Unit commander at Elf station bravo
So -- they waited for cloud cover, and they came in from the north
As Shane finishes the story, he illustrates, setting up the scene with , on Lulu's floor
(') The Elf Team decided on an  Ambush -- so three elves formed a base leg and laid down a heavy suppressive fire on the gnomes while the others maneuvered around to the right flank and walked through finishing off anything left alive mean standing : : Shane's really into the story
Lulu's fallen asleep
Shane's eyes are brimming with tears as he finishes: (') And not one Elf got left behind that day
We got `em all
Even, the teeniest little elf of all -- Rodriquez
Then, from across the hall, Peter
Todd pops his head in the door
You have to do the Panda Dance
or he won't stop
Oh, c'mon
can't remember that thing
'll write it down for you
The wails get louder and
69
- Tyler's asleep
Shane sighs, and whispers to Peter, reading from Todd's notes: When you're down and low, lower than the floor
And you ain't got a chance
Don't make a move `til you're in the groove, and do the Panda Dance
Peter starts bawling
Shane doesn't know what's wrong
Todd calls from the doorway
You have to do the dance
Like dad used to do
He made it up for him
Shane sighs
He sings again, mortified
He does the dance as he sings
Shane hops forward three times
Just hop three times like a kangaroo -- Sidestep twice, just like the crabs do
Peter applauds
Humiliated, Shane crab-walks sideways
(') Take three steps forward and one step back
(He does
) -  - As Mr
Chun gets his paper, Shane, (Tyler in the snuggle), hands out bag lunches as the Kids load into the minivan
Shane turns and catches Mr
Chun, staring
What are you looking at
- Todd sits in the back of the Minivan, listening to Sound of Music on his Walkman, Lulu is next to him, with her Gameboy, Zoe and Peter are half asleep
Shane climbs into the
Zoe realizes he's staring at her, through the mirror
Today you drive
70
The Kids sit bolt upright
They turn to Zoe, terrified
She gets out in shock, and gets in the driver's seat
The other Kid's seat belts  loudly
But --  can't even pass driver's Ed
Exactly
Have you given a driving lesson before
ot in a car, no
but it's a lot like a Bradley Assault Vehicle
Especially when Zoe's driving
The Kids share a dubious look
Zoe backs jerkily out
- Zoe is super-tense as they drive
Shane is nervous, but trying not to show it
Lulu and Todd are terrified
Do you know what causes most accidents
ttention span
The most important thing is that you keep an absolute focus on
Zoe's looking  at him, not the road
(') Don't look at me
What
he Minivan brakes abruptly at a red light, just as a semi  through the intersection
Shane is shaky
(') You wanna drive
No
Keep going
trust you
Zoe is surprised
Touched
She pulls out, jerkily
71
-12  - Zoe pulls to the curb, almost tapping a bus's rear fender
Shane unclenches his teeth
Good
Next lesson, 1500 hours
Zoe smiles
And the other Kids all bolt from the car, terrified
Lulu makes a big show of kissing the ground
Ha ha ha
Very funny
hey head into the school
Shane spots something
reveals:  (Zoe's boyfriend), with a few , laughing, being obnoxious
Shane jumps out of the car
Before Scott knows what's happened, Shane's him in the air by his backpack
Scott's terrified
know 437 ways to hurt a man without touching him
Broken promises lead to broken legs
Do we understand each other
Scott nods, trembling
Shane lets him down and heads into school
-12 ,  - Shane (Peter in lap, Tyler in snuggle) keeps an eye on the Kids at their tables
boisterously run past
Suddenly -- Claire  out
The kids instantly freeze
Claire strides into view
She's wearing a cute dress, and a little make-up
(') (a long, severe stare) Now
Chastened, the kids gulp and orderly march away
Shane's eyes alight, impressed
Wow
'm glad  never had you for a
72
(she coyly smiles) 've noticed improvement in your troops lately, too
Noon and none of them have been called to my office
It's a miracle
he sits beside him, and offers him a milk
(') Buy you a drink, sailor
Thanks
hey eat in silence
Shane`s not so good at small talk
She's waiting for him to say
something
(') You look nice today
This old thing
Well, you never know who you're going to run into
She smiles
He smiles back
Suddenly, there's a commotion: Murney is marching Todd towards them, dragging him by the ear
Principal Claire sighs "not again
" In one move, Shane leaps over the table
Principal Claire watches him leap: (') Love it when he does that
Murney shoves Todd forward
've had it
just caught this boy dancing under the bleachers like some kind of Bavarian fruitcake
Murney gets up in Shane's face
(') want this freak outta my school and into treatment
Somebody needs to give this punk a talking to
Hey
'm right here
Talk
veryone is shocked that Todd talked back
hushed whisper goes through the cafeteria
Murney turns around
73
You got something to say
Boy
Yeah
Yeah  do
quit, Murney
hushed "oooh" goes through the Students
Winners never quit, boy
What're you so scared of, Freak
The Students snicker
Todd looks, intimidated
Then: am not scared
want to sing
Silence
No one's sure they heard him right
Todd pulls out a stack of     and hands them out
Todd is on the poster in his Rolf costume
Principal Claire takes one: she laughs, now it all makes sense
(') 'm in Sound of Music
It opens Friday
musical
You're blowing off wrestling for a musical
(to Shane:) This is what happens when there's no man in the house
There is a man in my house -- me
(Murney turns:) Let's get one thing clear
'm not quitting cause  hate wresting
'm quitting because you're a bad coach
You suck
The whole team wants to quit
'm the only one with the guts to do it
urney looks over at the Team
They look to the ground sheepishly, Todd's telling the truth
Murney looks around, humiliated, furious -- So -- you're a tough guy now
Murney takes   towards Todd -- Shane steps between them, protecting him
(') Stay out of this, baby sitter
Murney glares at him -- face to face
So calm, it's scary 74
You said you wanted to wrestle
You win
Let's do it
Everyone is watching
Murney did not expect to be called out
His voice cracks -- then he regains his calm: After school
The Gym
Your ass is mine
He storms out
There is a stunned moment -- and then a mob of Students, and a lot of  , swarm Todd, taking flyers
Shane gives Todd a proud thumbs up
: Of  whispering to other , passing notes:  Kid opens a note -- it reads: "Murney's getting his ass kicked
3:00
" - 3:00 The bleachers are
Murney struts out onto the mat
The two fighters begin circling one another
The Wrestlers scream for Murney
Todd cheers Shane on
on, you're about to enter Murney's house of pain
'll be sure to lock up when 'm through
Murney roars and  Shane
Shane defensively uses Murney's momentum to flip him halfway across the mat
Murney lands on his back
The Wrestlers mouths drop
Murney, shocked, climbs to his feet and  again, Shane side-steps, and sweeps Murney -- sending him right into the wall, hard
Murney bounds to his feet, rushes Shane
Shane Murney, grabs onto Murney's waist
Shane's momentum pulls Murney backwards --
Murney's shoulders hit the mat with Shane smiling down on him
Todd flops to the mat, raises his hand and  it down- Pinned
Shane stands
Shane throws an arm around Todd, and they head out
The Wrestling Team huddles around Murney, who's quietly twitching on the ground, mumbling something
75
(') Is he okay
Dislocated nerve, that's all
He'll be fine in (checking his watch) two months
That was awesome
They walk out
The crowd cheers
Claire, too
Shane smiles at her as he passes
She gives him a thumbs up

'm not used to anyone giving me the benefit of the doubt
My teachers don't trust me
Mom doesn't
My dad didn't care about us, he was never here
81
(interrupts her, stern:) Hey
Your father cared about you very deeply
He told me you were the greatest things in his life
That what's bothering you
Cause -- we can talk about it, if you want
Zoe's eye well up, then she cries
Shane holds her
miss him so much
Shane is a little taken by surprise
Then -- he decides to answer
He takes his Sfather's  out of his pocket
This was my dad's
He was the only family ever had
Mom left when  was little, cause dad was always gone
Two years in
an indisclosable locale
Another six in
Another indisclosable locale didn't really have a home, so  went to military school -- then one day my mom got the letter
No more dad
He looks at the Medal
(') always wanted to be just like him
'm starting to realize,  never really knew him
don't know if 'm like him or not
That's horrible, Shane
The hardest part was living without any details
why
How
Where
always wondered if he thought about me
Me too
So how did you get through it
You could say  just shut down my emotions
turned off all feelings and dedicated myself to becoming the perfect soldier
never even got to say good bye
82
tear runs down Zoe's face
She throws her arms around Shane
The phone rings
Shane answers it
: - ulie's on the other end
The red tape is cleared up, we're on the first plane in the morning
- Zoe runs down the hall, telling the family: Mommy's coming home
Mommy's coming home
Everyone wakes up, happy, sleepy
When
Tomorrow morning

Excited, the kids are all abuzz, talking excitedly

- The house is dark
Shane sits in a lawn chair, scoping the area with
Gary sits in the next chair
Shane sighs morosely
Just another assignment
No reason for personal attachments
Shane takes a sip out of a juice box
He pets the Duck

How come you don't fly away

Kids to play with
Three squares a day

- hane turns the light on
Gary follows Shane as he looks for tool
Suddenly, the Duck starts quacking
Shane turns
Gary's foot is caught in a grate
What happened, Gary
Shane gets down on his hands and knees and gently pries Gary's foot from the grate
Shane is about to stand when something below catches his eye
Shane pulls out a pen flashlight, shines it down the grate
we see a
(') What do you suppose this is
Shane tugs at the grate until it pops off
Shane grips the valve and tries turning it
Nothing
He tries harder, muscles rippling, and then it gives
The wheel spins
he floor opens, revealing a  , leading below the garage
Shane steps down it
- There's a small room, and a hall leading to a
It's solid and inscrutable
No hinges or cracks
The only break in its surface is a strange, -
Shane looks on stunned
: - Shane's at the Steel Door
He has high-tech tools laid out in front of him
He's been trying, unsuccessfully, to crack the lock all night
The Kids are watching his progress, Lulu hands him a tool
Shane dials a phone
: 84
- We pan up from the  " " license plates to Bill at the wheel
Julie sits beside him
Bill's cell phone rings, he answers it
Sir
Excellent news

Do you have it
No
It's in a steel vault
've been trying all night, can't crack it, sir
(remaining calm) Good
Good work
Okay, don't do anything further
We'll be there shortly -- don't do anything `til  get there

Then we slowly Away from Shane
towards the neighbor's house
e   the house
Through a window
revealing the Korean neighbors standing in the dark
Silently spying on Shane
An ominous pause
: - One things for sure
After we turn this in to my , whoever's been bothering you guys won't be bothering you anymore
Everyone reacts happily, relieved
Except for -- Lulu
She looks stricken
(') What's wrong, Lulu
You should be happy
85
But, Shane -- does that mean you'll have to go
- - He goes silent
Tongue-tied, he has no answer
You guys better get ready
Your mom should be home soon

Julie and Bill hop out

Bill is carrying her suitcases

She trails off
What's wrong
They listen -- they hear, in the next room, Kids singing a beautiful, a capella version of The Hills are Alive (with The Sound of Music)
She turns on the lights -- what she sees makes her drop her luggage, in shock
'
: The house is spotless
The rug is vacuumed
The fish tank is clear, filled with healthy (singing, a capella) with songs they have sung, for a thousand years
Dumb-struck, Julie goes to the

She sees, attached to the fridge with magnets:  flyer for Sound of Music, featuring Todd

Bill steadies her
She staggers to
- Shane and the Kids are holding up a home-made sign: ,
Todd pushes  on a  player: The Sound of Music stops
Zoe is in a conservative dress, Todd a button down and khakis: barely recognizable
Lulu has bows in her hair
Peter is fresh faced, smiling, Tyler is asleep: a picture- perfect family
Welcome home, mom
Julie starts bawling
The Kids rush forward and hug her
Across the room, Shane sees Bill enter
Shane stiffens and salutes proudly Captain
(he smiles wryly, then salutes back) Good job, Lieutenant
- Shane leads Bill inside
Bill holds the pronged key
'm really proud of you, Shane
'm giving you your choice of assignment, anywhere you want
You just name it
That's kind of you, Sir
pause) But 'll have to think about it
Bill stops, surprised
Shane continues, a bit reluctant
(') Sir, all 've never known is the military
At nine years old my father put me in cadet school and from there never looked back
Don't get me wrong, wouldn't trade it for anything and  have no regrets
87
should hope not
But being with these kids has made me feel like there's more to life than taking out your enemy
And  think want to explore that some more

Shane peers in confusion, then passes out

Bill eyes the safe
You bring your stethoscope
No
But 've got some C4
She confidently strides toward the safe -- which sets off hidden flame-throwers in the walls

She leaps back just in time, but the shoulder of her jacket is on fire
Bill pats out the flames with his own jacket

then Mr
Chun pulls the Tracker from his pocket
He sneers
Think 'm stupid
Now stop bothering me
Lulu frowns, then leans back against Zoe
With a rapid blur of finger-work, she unties Zoe
Then -- needing a distraction, she signals Tyler and crosses her eyes
Tyler , horrified -- and
Chun spins, startled -- and Lulu quickly  across the room
She lands against Todd, quickly assuming a fake bound position, as if she hadn't moved
Mr
Chun whirls -- the Kids look innocent
Mr
Chun is confused for a second: "wasn't he tied to the other one
" 90
- Lulu frantically unties Todd's ropes -- it's gonna be close
Chun scowls
Skeptical, he steps closer
He leans down to look at Todd's ropes -- Now Peter

Chun punches the door, making a small hole
He reaches out to knock the chair away but he can't quite reach
He puts his face up to the hole he's made

The kids are horrified
They start to run back, but she urgently gestures -- (') Keep going

The kids fret, unsure, then nod and run to the side garage
Zoe and Todd load the kids into the minivan
/ Hurry

Buckle up

Mrs
Chun listens to Mr

Omigod
What are we doing
Let's look for a cop
The sedan  its engine, gaining on them
oe runs a yellow
She hits the curb and goes
The kids , as they sail through the intersection
The sedan keeps chasing
- Bill has Julie at gunpoint, leading her to the secret door
They step past Shane's body, lying on the concrete
How does it work
How does what work
Don't play dumb
It's getting old
want to know how to get through the booby traps
What's the code
don't know any code -- Charles didn't tell me about the room
If  knew Charles had hidden it so well, wouldn't have killed him so soon
Don't make me kill you too
Julie , chilled
Then, a  of static
Mrs
Chun exits the vault, holding a military

Mr
Bill, my husband has question: (  ) have a clean shot at their tires
It's risky, they might wreck
Do it
Julie goes frantic, emotional
(
) Bill, don't hurt the kids
Surprised, everyone looks down

'll get you in
just please don't hurt anyone
ill eyes him
The men stare down, Bill deciding if he can trust him
Then -- he clicks "talk" on the radio
Change of plan
Bring them back unharmed
Bill uncuffs Shane
- The vehicles race, Chun just inches from the kids' tail
He tries to pass them on the right
It's like a chariot race, Chun zooming by, half on the sidewalk, to cut them off
- Todd scrambles into the back seat
He does something we can't see, as Zoe drives
What's taking you
94
Don't wait for me
The sedan pulls up beside them
Zoe makes a very lewd gesture at him
It throws Mr
Chun off for a beat
(') Now
Zoe floors it, Mr
Chun is now face to face with Todd -- who throws a dirty diaper into the his face
Mr
Chun swerves and almost wrecks
Lulu starts  Mr
Chun with debris: milk cartons, crayons, orange peels
Aah
-- Rubbish clobbers him
Exasperated, Mr
Chun   his window, then  the gas
Faster
About to pass
Zoe looks over
Chun is pointing a gun
She suddenly the emergency brake
The Van  into a squealing 360
Mr
Chun , disoriented, and loses control
In the van, Peter laughs
Wheee
The Van spins madly
The sedan skids and  into a store window
The kids cheer, triumphant
- Shane scopes out the vault
The walls and ceilings are covered with high-tech weaponry
Mrs
Chun holds Julie
Bill waits impatiently
Shane is figuring his options
Anybody got any perfume
Hair spray
breath freshener
bewildered beat -- then Julie pulls out a tube of Binaca
Shane  it, revealing in the mist a myriad of crisscrossing
Shane steps forward
He speaks aloud, confidently: 95
(') Zoe, Todd, Lulu, Peter, Tyler
Bill reacts, puzzled
(') The key is the kid's names
Watch
Shane steps forward -
The floor tile  , sending him flying backwards
Bill laughs
Shane gets up, in pain
You think this is a game
But
That was the code
swear
saw Plummer use it on his briefcase
Code or no code, go get it -- now
ill cocks his gun
Sweat drips down Shane's face
He mists the air to see the beams: He steps forward, over one beam and ducking under another -- he miscalculates: a blazes from the ceiling like a giant blow torch, Shane leaps back, landing on his hands and knees
(to Bill) You can't make him do this -- He doesn't have a chance
- - Shane's thinks
He notices a  carved in the floor, not quite centered to the room
He feels the Groove
Something she said
(thinking) Haven't got a chance
Shane feels the Groove in the floor
He thinks
He looks up at the ceiling (bottom of the first floor)
(') (sings softly to himself) When you're down and low, lower than the floor
And you haven't got a chance
Don't make a move `til you're in the groove, and do the Peter Panda Dance
96
Shane  sharply
That's the code
He shares a look with Julie
Bill and Julie share a look -- they have no idea what he's laughing about
Calmness comes to Shane's face
He takes a deep breath, facing forwards: (') Just hop three times like a kangaroo -- He hops forwards three times, fearlessly No   are set off
(') Sidestep twice, just like the crabs do
He steps sideway, across two tiles
Again -- It dawns on Julie what he's doing
Julie smiles, relieved
Shane he steps forwards, then back: (') Three steps forward and one step back
When he steps back --  -  launches down from the ceiling, imbedding itself where he was standing
Shane is rattled, his focus gone
Until Julie shouts: Shane snaps out of it and flops down on his back -- just in time:      right at him
If he'd been standing, he'd be toast
- The Minivan blasts through another yellow
Look out Zoe
Rollers
There is a   cruising the street ahead of them
Zoe blows past it
Inside is the Cute Cop
The Squad Car's lights flash on, and he catches up with the minivan -- it takes a while, they're
Come on
Use the gas, not the brake, 5-0
Zoe slows down so the Police Car can pull up beside her
The Cute Cop shouts over at Zoe
97
'd say you could lose your license -- but you haven't got one
People are trying to kill us
They have my mom, and our bodyguard -- you have to follow me
Just pull over
Fine
Don't follow me
She swerves into the Squad Car, almost running it off the road
Zoe -turns, and speeds back towards her house
The Squad Car turns around and chases her
- The Minivan speeds by
The Squad Car is on its tail
It is joined by
Following the chase, at a safe distance, is Mr
Chun in his now-wrecked sedan

Claire frowns, concerned
- Shane is on the floor, sliding forward, nervously
98
Wriggle like a snake `til you can't no more
Then better jump quick, like there ain't no floor
Shane jumps up just       , revealing a pool of liquid
Shane has wedged himself in the corner
bead of his sweat falls into the liquid, and sizzles in a cloud of smoke
It's acid
(') (to himself, to calm down) Almost done, almost done
"Just hold your breath, and jump to the left
" He jumps, to the left of the
He lands in front of He's relieved -- then nozzles spray at him
He holds his breath just in time
Still holding his breath: (') And that's the Peter Panda Dance
He flips the switch to
The safe's red light turns green
Immediately, the flamethrowers and blowguns retract
The gas gets sucked into grates
The whole room goes
Whew
Bill looks around
He nervously steps forward - he waves his hand over the floor, and jumps back
Nothing happens
Bill signals for Mrs
Chun to go first
She gestures back: you go
It's a stand-off
Finally, Bill takes a breath -- and walks across the room
The Booby Traps are disarmed
Mrs
Chun follows, pulling Julie along
Thank you, Shane
You were always my best man
knew you'd figure it out
Shane scowls, disgusted
(') You know, if you're willing to join up, 'd be happy to cut you in on the proceeds
What do you say -- we make a good team

And you betrayed all of that
All that we stand for

Bill shrugs
'll take that as a "no

He starts to reach for the dial
then catches himself
Something's not right
(') think you better open it
Shane reaches for the safe, before he reaches the dial -- (') Wait
That's just what you want isn't it
Bill thinks, trying to read Shane's poker face
Shane shrugs
Bill gestures to Mrs
Chun
(') You open it
Mrs
Chun doesn't budge
(') Oh come on

Reluctantly - Mrs
Chun reaches out, and touches the dial
Nothing happens
Relief
She turns it, and
1000 volts  her, her hair on end, shaking from the voltage
Bill is off guard, Shane kicks his gun away
The gun skids into the acid and plunges,
Bill is incensed, but Shane gazes coldly
There will be no mercy
None requested
Full of himself, Bill
And he's strong
He shoves Shane back, then  him in the gut
Shane glares, then returns an onslaught of
Shane's fury is unleashed:  volley of attacks, hitting Bill's arms, head, legs
He's crazed, unrelenting
But suddenly Mrs
Chun  onto his back

She  and grabs his throat
Shane struggles to lose her
Suddenly, he drops and  her
She catapults, stumbles backwards across the room, and stops just inches from the acid
She teeters, tottering, unable to gain her balance
Shane shakes his head, then runs to grab her outstretched hand
She smiles, saved
But he's unforgiving
You're a
terrible neighbor
Shane - her, knocking her out
Suddenly -- Shane
Watch out
Bill is charging him
Shane whirls, delivering a Bill gets slammed in the chest
Bill tumbles, the wind knocked out of him
He jumps to his feet, delivering a series of hard punches, which Shane deflects -- they tangle like pro's
It's clear the both have the same training
They punch, spin, kick, connecting only occasionally
Bill wheels around and lands a kicks squarely in Shane's chest
Shane tumbles, landing on his back in front of the safe
- He steps over Shane
Leering mercilessly, he jabs the spike against Shane's throat
Any last words
Julie gasps
Shane narrows his eyes, then whispers/sings
Say, good night, Peter Panda

You're not gonna have enough time to stop- Hey, ' the one in Driver's Ed

She squeals into the driveway, then
But it's too late
The van , smoke  from the tires -- and hits a tree
The Kid spill out and run
The lead Police Car screeches to a stop
leap from the car
- Shane and Julie stare at each other, then look in the safe: Inside, the cavernous metal box holds but one object: tiny
Shane gently removes it
They look in silence
She smiles at Shane, grateful
Thank you Shane
It's finally over
Now we can go back to our peaceful
Then -- a sudden   from behind them: (
) - Total commotion
The kids clamber from the van, with their hands raised
Cops surround them
Even Peter and Tyler have their little hands over their heads
The garage door raises, Shane steps out
Whoa,
What are you doing to these kids
102
Cops cover Shane and Julie, Julie and Shane Freeze
But, officer

Even Chun is amazed, as he turns his head, Shane spins, and grabs the rocket launcher

- He's flummoxed
This chaos is unsolvable
Beaten, he reaches for his radio

Julie huddles with the kids
Shane talks with an

Mr
Wolfe

You're a one-man battalion

The Bureau is always looking for good men
Do you have a card or something
The Agent hands him a  , then walks off
Shane examines it, swelling with pride
- The Kids are looking around, watching the  Agents work
Lulu is following one of the  Agents around
Do you have to wear that thing in your ear all the time
Yes
Does it itch
Yes

Zoe is looking at the safe
She sees, fallen onto the floor, from the safe, a letter
Her siblings, and Julie notice, and gather around
Zoe reads the : If you're reading this, then Julie found the key
Julie, Tyler, Peter, Zoe, Todd, Lulu --  want to say:  love you more than anything

The Plummers hug each other

Mock-angry
So

Shane looks at her
He looks around: at the family
He looks at Claire
Well

So
What's the next move
Shane smiles slyly and pulls her close

He puts them down
Before he goes: he reaches down and gives Zoe - - his medal
He squeezes her hand around it
But
He would've wanted me to give it to someone  care about
Like he did
Thank you
For everything
Love you, Shane
- This is too much
He wipes his face
