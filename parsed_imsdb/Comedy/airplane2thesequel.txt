Takes out a "Des Moines" ticket and throws it away
Looks at another ticket -- "Mercury

What's the problem
Morgan was senselessly murdered about an hour ago
Elaine gasps

Ted stops at the door surrounded by boarding passengers

The boarding passengers look around for the echoing voice

The Terrorists look confused
Joe Salucci clutches his case and wipes his brow
Mary takes a man's suit bag
Can  hang that for you, sir
Thanks
Mary hangs the bag from a rope noose in the closet, pulls a lever, the bag drops like a man being executed

Unger looks out the window
It looks like that weather is clearing

Elaine
She turns and gasps
Ted
What are you
have to get in there
have to stop this flight
:
-   - "   " Ted, we're taking off
Let me by, Elaine
Mary passes
Please take your seats
As Ted turns to Mary, Elaine slips into the cockpit and locks the door -- :
Ted tries the door
Elaine
-  - " ,     '  , " Elaine leans back against the door
She is highly agitated
Simon, the administrative officer, and other crew are in their seats
Whenever your're ready, Captain
Yes, sir, commander
(into radio) This is Mercury One
Everything seems - okay up here and ready for count-down
to  of Elaine's face
: - Dr
Rumack and Elaine walk across the well-groomed lawn
Elaine carries a box of spaghetti-to-go
As they walk, they pass patients in wheelchairs pushed by nurses
The further they walk, the more wheelchairs appear until the lawn is jammed with two hundred wheelchairs bumping into each other, patients falling out, total wheelchair chaos
Ted seemed to get worse after  told him about Simon, Doctor
The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder
(he stops at a patient in a wheelchair with his back ) Let me show you
(Rumack removes the top of the patient's skull and takes out his brain as they continue on) Ted's problem is in this area
(points with a pencil) This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here
They walk    as wheelchair demolition derby -   - Rumack and Elaine walk   still talking
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick
What can  do, Doctor Rumack
He stops next to a sign, "
" You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol
mean for Ted
You can be gentle with him, Elaine
He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden
Is that a good sign, Doctor
Rumack holds the " " sign
It does the job
He is ripping up small trees, shrubs, etc
, and throwing them onto a huge pile of mud that resembles the mountain that Dreyfuss built in "Close Encounters
" Hello, Ted
Ted ignores her as he works frantically
(holding out box) brought you some spaghetti
Ted still ignores her as he works feverishly
What are you doing, Ted
've got it, Elaine
've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle
Ted scurries around
Ted
Not now, Elaine
Ted
He ignores her
Rumack walks up and puts an arm around her shoulder
Elaine starts to sob
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine
Is he making any progress, Doctor
Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high

Sparks fly, fire spreads
Mary moves down the aisle checking passengers
She passes Father 'Flanagan who reads  magazine -- an alterboy in bikini bathing suit on cover
She passes Mrs
Gooch who reads
She stops at a ten-year-old
guess this is pretty exciting for you
Yes, it is
How long will the trip take
Our actual flight time is over fourteen months, but due to the time-space variant at sub-light speeds, our onboard flight time will be just over eighteen hours
Mary leaves and the Girl turns to the  beside her
Gee, Mom, how does that work

Ted breathes deeply on an oxygen unit
He stops, but we still hear deep breathing

He smiles and leaves
Joe Salucci clutches his attache case and wipes his brow
Mary leans over him
You should really put that case in the compartment above your head, sir
(nervously) That's okay

said, no
Mary leaves, giving him a worried look
Jimmy holds his dog
sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us
bet Scraps is going to love Mercury
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad
It's going to be terrific
whole new world, new kids to play with
You're going to love it, Jimmy
No more headlines about the rape trial and the fraud charges
(starts to twitch) How many kids get a chance to live on another planet
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'
(grabbing Jimmy) Look, a man can make an honest mistake
Anyway, she was asking for it
They're all asking for it all the time

Ted throws water on his face, wipes it off with a towel while staring into himself in the mirror
He sees the Psychiatrist in the mirror
The Psychiatrist also washes up
You must admit that you're sick, Ted

The Psychiatrist looks for the echo

Ted throws the paper towel into the toilet, and flushes
The toilet sparks and smokes and keeps running
The running gets more intense as Ted tries to stop it by hitting the handle
:
- ' Ted has to hold himself back as the suction builds in force
He is just able to escape and shut the door behind him
- Ted leans his back against the door and breathes heavily
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir
You better check it, Unger
(getting up) Done
Yes
- Ted spots Elaine coming
Elaine
Ted
don't know why you got on this flight
don't know what you're trying to prove
Elaine, we have to go back
We can't go back
We had something very special, but it's all over
Elaine,  mean the mission has to be aborted
This ship should never have passed  inspection
This thing is held together by string and chewing gum
cupboard door, labeled "  ," swings open behind Elaine revealing shelves of gum and string
Elaine shuts it without looking inside
:
Ted, get a grip on yourself
You should never have left the hospital
Then you do think 'm insane
've never used the word insane, Ted
(facetiously) What word would you use, Elaine
The word is sick
Ted -- very, very, very sick
What would you say if  told you the toilet just blew up in my face
'd use the word insane
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine
know its the wiring
That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg
Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone
Elaine leaves

Unger jiggles the handle of the running toilet
Suddenly it sucks in towels, etc
Unger is pulled down
He fights back, grabbing onto towel rack that comes out of the wall
-  - "      " The Texan with Talmud is now trying to wrap himself in tfilin
Ted walks down the aisle checking overhead panels
He spots a panel that is half open
sign on the door reads, " -- "
Ted opens it and a Hoover falls out on his head, cutting him
He holds a hanky to the wound and passes by Stella's seat
You've been hurt
'm getting over it
If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it
No,  mean your head
Sit down
'll take a look at it
'm a nurse
Ted sits down and Stella starts patching him up
Do you want to talk about it
opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me
No
mean your relationship
We were in love but 'm not sure  know what love is anymore
Love's the same as it always was
It's people who change
People change in relation to each other
Love changes on its own
Not if the people change together in relation to that love
Sure
But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love
just wish it was that simple
We really were in love
You know how it is when you laugh all the time
Stella looks to her Father who is reading magazine
No
It's hard to ---- when your father's dying
Well, we laughed
We laughed all the time
: - They run towards each other
Elaine grabs Ted by the waist, picks him up and swings him around in
They laugh
(
) We laughed when times were good
- The grave is surrounded by mourners in black with umbrellas
We  the weeping crowd until we get to Ted and Elaine
They are also dressed in black and drenched
He holds her high by the waist, twirls her around as they laugh
(
) Even when times weren't so good, we still laughed
- They are locked in each other's arms in the middle of lovemaking and laughing heir heads off
(
) But most of all, we laughed when we felt closest to each other
: - That's our story
Passengers are standing
They hiss and throw vegetables at Ted
Dunn checks a red flashing light on his panel
(to Oveur) Sir, 've got an overload in disposal unit four
You better check on it, Mr
Dunn
'll stay here and fly the ship
Dunn gets up
Dunn
Sir
You better take this
Oveur throws him a plunger and gives him a thumbs up
They exchange that "man must do what a man must do" smile
Mary enters with Jimmy Wilson -- carrying Scraps
Mind if Jimmy here takes a look around, Captain
Of course not
Come on in, Jimmy
(checking his navigational screen) That's strange
Simon leans over Oveur's shoulder
Now what
Scraps looks at Oveur
Jimmy looks at the array of dials, etc
That's an asteroid field
There shouldn't be anything like that in this sector unless
Scraps looks at Simon
Unless
Scraps looks at Oveur
Unless those sunspots are interfering with our scanner or
Scraps looks at Simon
Or
Scraps looks at Oveur
Or we're off course, but
Scraps looks at Simon
But
Scraps looks at Oveur
But we couldn't be off course

Scraps' ears prick up
Simon moves past Jimmy, stops at the door and downs a handful of anti-fear pills before leaving
Come on up, Jimmy
Say, that's some puppy
What's his name
Scraps

Yeah

Stella shakes Ted's arm
Ted, are you okay
Here, take one of these stress pills
Stella hands him a pill which he pops automatically, but misses his face with his drink
She leaves the bottle next to Ted

Stella starts feeding her father again
The ship jolts and his face goes into the tray

Systems check positive
Look, Elaine, Request; life support systems check
Life support check
Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me
You're a woman
can relate to that
(panicky and confused) Request; self-analysis of  hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes
There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine
What about tonight -- just you and me
We can be alone
can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- 've already proven that
Elaine gasps and moves away from 's blinking eye
- Simon takes a long slug from a flask
to  Jimmy and Scraps
Do you want to talk about it, Commander
Dunn is about to enter with the plunger as Mary passes
The ship jolts and she falls into his arms
Did you feel that
(looking at his pants) Yes  did
Felt like a large asteroid
Yes it did
Mr
Dunn, can  ask you a personal question
What is it, Mary
Um
Do you people scream right when you
you know
Dunn gives her a look and opens the washroom door
Dunn is immediately pulled down to the raging toilet bowl
He grabs for the door screaming
Mary hears the scream and gives a look as she leaves
Testa is serving the Walters coffee from a steaming pot
Hand me your cup
This is very hot
Thank you
And, stewardess, can you please tell my wife that there is nothing that can go wrong
think she'd like to hear it from you
Testa spots Dunn's tattered sleeve emerge from the washroom door, groping for a handhold
She screams and dumps coffee in Edith's face
She runs to help Dunn, grabs his sleeve
It comes off in her hands
She keeps pulling
His jacket comes off, his pants, underwear, socks, an entire clothesline of garments like bras, towels, etc
She hears a Then silence
Elaine and Oveur
Elaine stands over his shoulder
don't think we have any alternative, Captain
see
What do you think our alternatives are
We have to disconnect 's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system
- ' Roger
You can do it from up here, Captain
'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine
No,  mean you can do it from the cockpit
Roger
You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit
Elaine leaves and Mary enters
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and don't like it
Have you tried it with a little cinnamon
Mary gives a "why didn't  think of that" look
Testa enters
Captain Oveur, Dunn and Unger have been sucked out through disposal unit four
Mary gasps
Both together
/ Dunn and Unger have been sucked out through disposal unit four
All right, calm down
Here's how we're going to play it
Mary and Testa look over his shoulder
He has a basketball play diagram
Mary,  want you here
Testa, you move across here past Dawkins' pick and get the ball at the top of the key from Irving
They all clasp hands and "yell

Oveur is pulling curcuit board from  panel
- What are you doing, Captain
Oveur eyes  but keeps working
wouldn't do that, Captain
Oveur continues
Smoke spews out
He hears a  and looks at a vent
He grabs his throat and collapses

Listen to me
They calm down
We've been thrown off course just a tad
What's that mean
In space terms, about 70 million miles
The Passengers appear interested and sensible, nod their heads
The bumps you feel are car-sized asteroids smashing into the hull
The hood of a car smashes through the cabin wall
The Passengers still appear interested and sensible
Also, we're heading right for the sun and can't seem to change course
Passengers still appear interested and sensible
They all put on sunglasses

McCROSKY Get me a readout on their fuel capacity
3 Yes, sir
4 Here's all the available information on the sun
That thing's hot, sir
McCrosky takes the info and burns his hand
: McCROSKY Ahhhhhh
Get me Bud Kruger immediately
(spotting Jacobs) Jacobs,  want to know absolutely everything that's happened up till now
First the earth cooled
Then the dinosaurs came but were too big and died and everything got rotten and turned into oil and the Arabs bought Mercedes Benzs and then there was the best  special on Judy Garland
Then we lost the war with Albania
Then
McCrosky leaves Jacobs babbling
McCROSKY Things sure haven't changed
McCrosky stands in front of a huge painting of himself
Both he and painting are in the same pose -- one hand loosens the tie, he drinks coffee with the other, a cigarette dangles from his lip
- He is lost in thought
: -- Ted getting electro-shock -- Psychiatrist telling him he's sick -- Ted building the "Close Encounters" mound Ted is shaken out of his dream by Elaine
Ted, Ted
Listen to me, Ted
You were right all along
Ted, we've lost the crew and Simon's turned to jelly
- Simon is a jelly mold inside a uniform
1 (
) (on radio) Come in, Mayflower
This is mission control
Over
Come in, Mayflower
Over
Jimmy pokes his head in
Do you want to talk about it now, Commander
- Elaine stands over Ted looking at the empty bottle of stress pills
My God
Stella approaches in nurse's uniform splattered with blood
cigarette dangles from her lip
She wipes her hands on a blood-splattered towel
He's finally come to terms with his own psychosis
But he was right
He's not crazy
Miss, 'm a nurse with a dying ----- ,  know what 'm talking about
Now 'm going to need fresh sheets, gauze, -tips, and all the vaseline you have on board
Now
Elaine leaves, looking back at Ted with empathy
Mary passes
(to Mary) 'll need all the boiling water you can get your hands on
Mary leaves and a  passes holding a tattered arm
Are you a nurse
Yes
(handing him a urine bottle) The washroom's down there on your right
The Man leaves, a quizzical look on his face
(yelling after him) And not too much
(imagine Jim Brown) approaches Stella
Can  help
Stella hands him an -16
Keep an eye on that side of the ship
The Sergeant drops into a seat next to a window, smashes out the glass with his rifle butt and is immediately sucked out
moves down the aisle with a cart collecting boiling water
(to passengers) 'll need all your boiling water
Passengers pull pots of boiling water from under their seats, handbags, coat pockets, and pour them into the passing container
Testa reassures Bob and Alice Wilson
We should be out of this momentarily
There's nothing to worry about
Thank you
That makes me feel so much better
Testa leaves and Father 'Flanagan approaches with last rites paraphernalia
' Trust me, 'm a priest
We're in shit up to our ears
Who wants last rites
He is now completely entangled in the tfilin and struggles to free himself
Elaine passes Ted carrying sheets, vaseline, etc
She looks at him sitting there in a fog, gives up and leaves
Ted looks at the red flashing "  " sign
It takes him back
: - :   , 101 We see the hospital deep in b
g
across an expansive lawn
Suddenly Ted's face pops  ,
He looks both ways and bolts
He wears a straightjacket
"        -- " Suddenly the dogs scramble   in front of the sign, slobbering
half-dozen viscious-looking  in reflector shades with shotguns, whips, nets, cattle prods, follow
(Southern accent) Damn
want that patient shot on sight
- : Ted stands at window
neon "" sign flashes outside so close to the window that the only way to read it is to rent this room
:   - Maybe you gotta be crazy to end up behind the eight ball like this
Anyway, you find out pretty fast who your friends are when you're on the lamb
: Ted turns away from the window and passes the lamb in bed
(to lamb) 'm going out for cigarettes and a fifth of bourbon
Don't wait up for me
:
Ted grabs his straightjacket and leaves
Virgin wool
Nothin' but headaches
Bo Peep staff is flung against door as it closes behind him
- an empty, spotless, wet street
One car parked under a street lamp
: (
) travelled at night in the shadows didn't want to attract attention
:  ,     , ,   " "  , (
) was afraid to step out of the doorways
You never know what to expect when you're on the run
Ted steps into light
passes with grand   to pavement next to Ted
He ignores piano and gives Gloria and Cab a quizzical look
: - ' He steps in a puddle where a "-" sign is reflected
The reflection shatters
streetcleaning truck approaches spewing out garbage rather than water
Ted's ankles are sprayed with garbage
He bends down and picks up a wet matchbook -- "'  -- " : - standing, looking at a bar
The glow of flashing neon sign reflects off his face
He pulls out a cigarette
woman's hand shoots   holding a lit zippo
Ted draws deeply on the cigarette
(
) There  was, minding my own business when looked up and saw a pair of legs that went forever
' She is all legs -- no torso, no head, just legs -- about two stories high
(
) But  had a date with Harry's
It was little more than a hole in a wall on the south side of Chicago
bashed in the side of a brick wall
neon sign over the hole reads, "'
" ' dark, smokey bar
very tough faces standing along the bar
(
) Harry's was perfect for me
The kind of place you go if you don't want to be recognized
tough faces, but now they all wear Groucho glasses and noses
(
) It was rough, real rough
with four players -- all have broken thumbs in casts
(
) The kind of place you could score anything, from junk
One guy hands another guy a large, rusted car fender for money
(
) to Phil Donahue's book
signs a stack of books at a table
(
) At Harry's you could count on a fight breaking out almost every night
argue at a table
1 And  say essence precedes existence
2 You're crazy
Existence precedes essence
1 Essence
2 Existence
Professor 2 slugs Professor 1 sending him flying across the room
Professor 1 gets up and throws a judo chop which Professor 2 stops by holding a book up in both hands
The book splits in two like a piece of wood split by a karate chop
(
) There was a small trio in one corner
Two midgets play light jazz -- piano and bass
(
) And a larger trio in the other corner
Five 300-pound musicians play some tune in another corner
- He pulls out a cigarette
bare foot with zippo held in toes comes   and lights it
The last thing  wanted was Elaine to see me down on my luck
Well, it was just my luck
In she walked with a group from the space program
Elaine and Simon and two other couples, who look like clean- cut  types out of "The Right Stuff," walk in laughing and take a table
(
) They'd come to Harry's to slum it and try their hand at the video bull
The group prod Elaine to try the bull
cowboy hat flies across the room
She grabs it, pulls it on, and moves to the bull which is surrounded by others in cowboy hats
Elaine hops in the saddle
sinister character puts a quarter in and madly flips knobs
: The saddle doesn't move -- all the action is on the screen but Elaine throws one hand back and kicks her legs
(
) Elaine made that ride look easy
It was obvious why  was still nuts about her
She loved life
didn't want her to notice me so  borrowed a pair of dark glasses
Ted takes a pair of dark glasses off a passing blind man who walks perfectly until the glasses are gone, then starts stumbling and crashes over a table
(
) Grabbed an alto sax and joined the group
Ted takes an alto sax from a passerby who also stumbles and crashes over a table when he loses his sax
(
) stayed in the background not wanting to draw attention to myself
Everyone looks around trying to see where the terrible grating sax sound is coming from
(
) Then what happened
Elaine's crowd talks her into joining us for a song
Elaine hops up on the stage, grabs a mike and starts to sing "Stormy Weather
"  She sidles up to Ted and goes into a medley of old songs
: Elaine's singing is just as bad as Ted's sax
They have cleared the joint and play and sing alone
Elaine's group finally pull her out
She hasn't recognized Ted
(to Ted) don't know who you are or how you lost your sight, but 'll never forget this night as long as  live
leaving Ted alone on the stage still playing
Chairs are turned up on tables
One table has chairs turned up with the people still sitting in the chairs
: - getting a glass of water outside cockpit door
Simon emerges
As the door opens we hear: 1 (
) Come in, Mayflower
Over
Simon shuts the door and bumps into Ted who is getting a drink of water
Simon takes a drink of booze
Striker
Kurtz, you're drunk
Who's in command of this ship
That damn computer has taken over
'm getting out
Then Elaine was right
Don't talk to me about Elaine
Outta my way
(grabbing Simon) Pull yourself together
We've got to
Simon slugs Ted who falls into a corner and hits his head
of Ted unconscious
:   - The ship takes another violent jolt
- It roars through the asteroid field
Simon sits on toilet seat and slides open a wall panel
Father 'Flanagan slides open an adjacent wall panel and sits down
- Father, what should  do
' Have you considered suicide, my son
panel on the other side of Simon slides open

Other Controllers line up for their turns with various heavy implements
McCROSKY McCROSKY (to Controller 5) Stinson, have you contacted the families of the passengers and crew
McCrosky looks out window
-    "    " McCROSKY Try and calm them down
And for God sake, be diplomatic
Stinson turns to two burly men in leather jerkins and black hoods
They hold a large caldron of molten lead next to window
5 Give 'em the lead
They pour it out
: - It careens through the asteroid field towards the sun
Ted lies unconscious
:   - She's doing her rounds -- takes a medical chart from the back of a seat
(to a male passenger) 'm afraid that leg's going to have to come off
leg is passed to her from
She takes it while still looking at the chart
Wait
This isn't your chart
You just had a touch of air sickness
(handing him back his leg) You'll be fine
sitting next to the       grabs Stella
'm terrified

Everything will be okay
Pass it on
The Man with the leg passes it to the passenger in seat behind
Everything will be okay
Pass it on
The leg gets passed from seat to seat as passengers say, "Everything will be okay
Pass it on
" lying unconscious in a corner
puppy crawls and starts licking his face
Jimmy standing over Ted
Ted comes to, feels his jaw and pulls himself up
The ship jolts
Are you feeling okay, mister
'm feeling just fine, son
Just fine
Ted pushes by Jimmy, a look of great purpose on his face
Elaine enters looking for Simon
Simon,
The cockpit is empty

Elaine gasps
She leaps into the Captain's seat and grabs radio
Hello

Controllers are gathered around one monitor
McCROSKY (on radio) We read you, Mayflower
Identify yourself and give your position
This is Elaine Thompson

McCROSKY Elaine Thompson
What in sam hill is a woman doing in charge of that ship
Maybe she's got her shit together

McCROSKY (

They smile at each other
McCROSKY (
) What the hell's going on up there
Ted and Elaine still smile at each other
All passengers look forward and smile
All Controller's look down the line and smile
- Six soldiers on firing squad duty, ready to fire, turn, smile, and  while they're smiling
:  , Ted grabs the radio
(smiling lovingly) Ted, this reminds me of twenty years ago over Chicago
Ted hits a switch
The ship does a barrel roll
All we see are feet sticking up from the seats

Do you read me

McCROSKY man
Now that's more like it

McCROSKY Damn
We've lost them again

What's the story
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor
was asking McCrosky, Commissioner
McCROSKY He falls in love with this poor school teacher who
interrupts them
(to McCrosky) Sir, we've restored radio transmission
McCROSKY Good
(to Kruger) We keep losing their radio
Give it to me straight, McCrosky -- what's it look like
McCROSKY It's green with numbers and lots of knobs
Not the radio, the situation
want to know exactly what your people think
three Controllers at monitors
1 (

2 (

The ship lurches from side to side
Stella, covered in blood, kneels beside , a young man bandaged head to toe, lying on a stretcher with lots of
bottles hanging around him
stands next to him -- imagine General Patton
General Walker is here, Billy
He wants to talk to you
Billy, if we get through this thing alive, 'd like you to get this letter to my mother
He hands Billy a letter
Elaine is monitoring various dials
Ted is at controls and on the radio
(on radio) An electrical fire in the core has played havoc with the -4000 computer
It's locked us on a direct line with the sun and there's no way we can go to manual
Captain Oveur already tried it and he's

The rest of the crew has been lost and we're out of coffee
Also, we're starting to feel the sun's heat pretty bad
Striker wipes his forehead
Elaine holds a tan reflector up to her face and turns to the sun
Passengers sweat profusely
:
slaps a mosquito on the back of his neck
sit nude to the waist, wrapped in towels as if in a steam bath
It's eight-thousand square feet with great parking and a twenty-year lease with option to buy
You can't lose, Al
He can lose
've seen it happen a thousand times
- It shoots towards sun
McCrosky sits at a monitor, talks into a mike and looks down at a book
Behind him two Controllers make a dope deal -- a baggie of grass for cash
We only see their midsections and hands
McCROSKY Striker, this is Jack McCrosky, chief controller
want you to listen to me and listen good
The buyer checks out the baggie -- it's mostly twigs
The seller is trying to explain the situation with his hands
McCROSKY Twenty years ago  helped a young pilot through a storm over Chicago
The buyer grabs the seller's shirt and tries to get cash back
fight ensues
McCROSKY He didn't have a crew either
He said he couldn't do it
But when the going got tough that kid pulled it together
The seller's shirt is ripped
Knives are pulled
McCROSKY You might have read about him; he made all the big papers and the Canadian Jewish News
The seller is stabbed
McCROSKY don't know where he is today but if he was up there right now,  know he'd find some way to turn that bucket around and get the hell out of there, pronto
wish  could talk like that -- so macho yet so sensitive
McCROSKY'  - "    " McCrosky slams it shut
McCROSKY just hope  said the right thing
(
) 'm afraid you gave the wrong speech
McCrosky
'm not your problem
It's this ship
That computer's gone bananas
McCROSKY (holding up the book) Why the hell are we still using the old manual
Burn this book
smiling blonde man in a white sweater with " " on the front walks by and takes the book
McCROSKY (on radio) Just hold on, Striker, we'll get back to you
Ted writes a note to Elaine and hands it to her -- it reads, "
"  Elaine looks a bit nervous and licks her lip
They look up at 's pulsating eye
Testa pokes her head in
She's soaked with sweat
The cabin temperature is rising
The passengers want to know what's happening up here
Let us handle this end of things
Now what's the coffee situation
It just won't drip
've tried everything
And the passengers are dropping like flies from the heat
: Passengers reel and drop to floor
Elaine, 'm going back there
Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can
Ted, please be careful
Ted leaves
We hear an enormous  on the other side of the door
(
), drinking a cup of coffee, rushes in accompanied by a
(to Joe) It doesn't look good
The drip seems to be jammed up pretty bad
Did they change the filter and wait for the brew sign to light up
(stopping and looking Mr
Coffee in the eye) To tell you the truth, sir,  don't really know
:
One holds a hat, one pulls a slip of paper from it
3 (reading his slip) Eighty-three
What's that mean
If eighty-three passengers die, you win the two hundred bucks
They approach McCrosky
Mr
McCrosky, Mr
Coffee
Coffee, McCrosky
McCROSKY Thanks for coming down so soon
(checking watch) won't come down for another couple hours
McCROSKY 'll put you on the radio with Striker
Jeez you look familiar
Did you ever play water polo
Not to my knowledge
McCROSKY thought so

Controllers stand over Mr
Coffee -- everyone sips coffee and smokes cigarettes
(on radio) Have you got the back panel off the brew manifold
Ted has the coffee machine apart, wears a headset and holds wires in pliars
Anxious passengers with coffee cups stand over him -- they are all totally wired and going cold turkey

That's your contact point

Is this a coffee bean

riot ensues
The "bean" Passenger is beaten to death

When the hell will you people realize that adding extra water after the initial brew cycle overheats the system
Now listen to me, Striker, and listen good

Detective Hallick storms in and up to McCrosky
He flashes his badge
Who's in charge here, Mister
McCROSKY McCrosky, Control
Hallick, homicide
Jacobs, Pisces
Kruger, Sagittarius
Commissioner, Aquarius
We have information that one of your passengers is carrying a bomb and might be suicidal
McCROSKY Where'd you get this information, Captain
We have our methods
And what methods are those
Have you heard of the Heimlich method
McCROSKY The method of saving someone choking on a piece of gristle
Exactly
/McCROSKY/ We're familiar with it
Good
This is the passenger's wife
Mrs
Joe Salucci
She approaches very distressed looking
McCROSKY What makes you think your husband might want to blow up that shuttle, ma'am
She goes into her purse for the insurance form
This insurance policy
large ivory colored vibrator drops out of her purse, hits the floor, and flips on
They all look at it
An electric tooth
(handing McCrosky the insurance form) Joey was supposed to go to Des Moines for an operation to cure his impotence
McCROSKY The Des Moines Institute
Then you know it
/McCROSKY/ Yes, we're familiar with it
Well,  found out Joey got on this shuttle instead and
The way  read it, blowin' up a plane in space leaves no traces, if you know what mean
'm not exactly sure what you mean, Captain
No blood
No body
No bones
No eyes
No ears
No throats
McCROSKY (looking at form) This is $500,000 worth of insurance
Kruger, Commissioner, and Hallick all whistle "wow
" McCROSKY Just a second
This is insurance on his car
That's what worries me
He's impotent
He's suicidal
And he's stupid
:
(into radio) This is it, Striker
You got one shot and one shot only
Striker stands over the coffee machine, sweating like mad
The Passengers with cups hang over him
He makes contact with a wire
(to self) Contact
The
Coffee gushes out like an oil well coming in
The Passengers dance under the gusher of brown liquid, mouths open and cheering
McCROSKY How are we going to handle this bomb nut
2 (rushes up with printouts) Here are the tests we ran on their computer
had them xeroxed for you
McCROSKY How'd they come out
2 Upside-down, but  turned each page over and put them in order
'm afraid that computer is totally capable of taking control of that ship
McCROSKY Let's keep cool
There's gotta be a way to control it
He lights a cigarette
3 (rushes up with diagrams) These are their position calculations
They've got about ten minutes before they start to burn up
McCROSKY Keep calm
lot can happen in ten minutes
(to self) What next
He sips his coffee
4 (rushes in) Sir, your headlights are on and your doors are locked
McCROSKY (spitting out coffee, Danny Thomas style) Jesus
'll be right back
McCrosky races out
- It heads closer to the sun
The nose is glowing
Elaine is checking computer
The cockpit is steaming now
She unbuttons her uniform just as Ted comes in
Ted, we've only got ten minutes
(thinking she wants sex) Not now, Elaine
mean until we start to burn up
Ted takes his seat and looks at a panel gauge
We're closer to the sun than  estimated
- One is labeled " " and reads, "76
50"
The other is labeled " " and reads, "5689465932

(
) Come in, Mayflower
This is Bud Kruger
Over
(on radio) This is Striker
(on radio) Look, Striker,  don't know how you got into that driver's seat but  want Simon Kurtz on that radio and  want him now
(on radio) Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place
You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly
You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program
That was very well put, Ted
Jacobs stands next to Kruger rubbing his forefingers together in the "shame, shame" sign
(on radio) Striker, you're heading right for the sun, so don't you think it's a little late for that bleeding heart liberal crap now
He's got a point, Ted
- There are columns under Kruger's and Striker's names
Striker has two check marks
Jacobs gives Kruger one
(on radio) Call me a bleeding heart, but if we get through this thing 'm preparing a paper on alternative spending directives recommending the transfer of space program funds to low cost housing
(on radio) Just put Kurtz on that radio
McCrosky rushes in and grabs the mike from Kruger
McCROSKY (enraged) Look, Kruger, you and your people have caused enough trouble already
don't care about your political games,  care about only one thing, the lives of those people up there
Out of my control room
Someone's car wouldn't start
McCROSKY (on mike) Striker, this is McCrosky
Give me five minutes and keep your fingers crossed
(to Stinson) Stinson, get me the Mayflower plans
(to Controller 3) You, clear this table
'll get the cards and bridge mix
McCROSKY And someone get me the Sarg
: leaning over the ship's plans
He is eating another cigar
All Controllers stand around him
That's my little girl, my little darlin', my sweetheart, my honey, and you want to blow her belly out with that bomb
If you blast here in the computer core and the fuselage doesn't give way here and the main communication lines to the cockpit hold here and this baby here doesn't jam this little old unit up here and throw about two tons of hot steel through here like a hot knife through butter and the upper and lower
McCROSKY What's your point, Sarg
have no point
McCROSKY Then it's settled
The bomb is Striker's only chance
Are there any questions
No sir
McCROSKY Those are answers,  asked for questions
3 Should a man in his forties have a circumcision
McCROSKY Absolutely
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something
just want you to know,  love you Ted and always will
: That might be the news we've been waiting for
He grabs radio
McCROSKY (
) 've got some news for you, Striker
Ted and Elaine smile hopefully at each other
(on radio) Roger
McCROSKY (
) One of your passengers is carrying a bomb and is suicidal
: b
She covers her mouth
McCROSKY (
) No, a bomb
Joe Salucci wipes his brow, lays his case on his lap
Ted and Mary huddle
Which passenger is Joe Salucci
Sixteen '', why
He's carrying a bomb
b
She covers her mouth
No, a bomb
Now, as discreetly as possible,  want you to move the passengers into the lounge
What should  say
Anything
Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him
Ted moves down the aisle
Mary gets on the
Would everyone not carrying a bomb please move to the lounge
The Passengers go nuts screaming, " bomb
" (jumping up with his case) Don't anyone move
All the passengers pile up in a ceiling-to-floor wall behind Ted -- he extends his arms, holding them back
Mr
Salucci, listen to me
Ted takes a step forward away from the wall of passengers -- the wall crumbles
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people
don't want to live anymore
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids
You bought auto insurance, not life insurance
What
(inching up on him) That's right, Joe
Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you
You're sure
'm sure
Ted is almost up to Joe when: (yells) That's the guy from the terminal who can't get it up
Joe bolts
Passengers panic
Ted tackles him
The case flies into the air in
It turns slowly, hanging for the longest time as we , still in  , to horrified faces watching it
This   sequence lasts for about 60 seconds -- people put on make-up, do macrame, read, etc
-- while the case is still in the air
Suddenly, Scraps leaps high into the air in   and comes down with the case between his teeth
Controllers huddle over one monitor
McCROSKY Get that bomb, Striker
Get that bomb
(
) Come in, Control
We have the bomb
He's got the bomb
This is just like an election in Iran
Ted is back at the controls -- the cockpit is incredibly hot now
This heat's getting unbearable
He looks down and sees two eggs frying on the dash
But it is a dry heat, Ted
Controllers are grouped around the plans
McCROSKY Do we use the bomb to blow that computer or is there another way
want to know what everyone thinks
2 (
) think
(changes mind) No

2 (

(changes mind) No
4 (
) You can't knock that wall out
That's a support wall, asshole
2 (
) think
(changes mind) No
5 (
) Did  flush
McCROSKY Then it's settled
We use the bomb
(grabs radio) Striker, McCrosky
McCROSKY (
) We've gone over the blueprints and you've got only one option
(on radio) know what you're going to say, McCrosky -- knock out the wall between the cockpit and cabin and hang plants
McCROSKY (
) Forget it
That's a support wall
Use the bomb
The b
She covers her mouth
McCROSKY (
) keep telling you, not the b
The bomb
(almost to self) Why, you'd have to be crazy to try a stunt like that
Elaine looks at Ted
All passengers look forward in Ted's direction
the womb over Ted's face
' You're too low in the womb, Striker
You've got to come out feet first
(grabs case) Elaine
'm going back there
Ted
love you
Be careful
Ted leaves
: McCROSKY (to his controllers) want everyone on their toes for this one
Handing out ballet slippers to the Controllers who are passing a joint down the line
McCROSKY And if anyone has any ideas,  want to hear them now
How about a show just like Hollywood Squares but with kids
Gary Coleman could host
The Passengers stand in the aisle listening to Mary
Now  want everyone to move to the front of the cabin
Passengers move calmly
That's fine
Stay calm
We just want everyone as far away from the blast as possible
The Passengers panic and stampede right over her
Ted wears a gas mask and attaches the time-bomb to the computer
What are you doing, Ted
Why are you wearing that mask, Ted
Gas spews out of a vent
Ted makes sure his gas mask is tight
Simon is dressed in space suit and moving down the aisle
Elaine holds onto him
Simon
Wait
What are you doing
They pass Father 'Flanagan
He has a Bongo drum at his seat
' Under the '', sixteen
've lost the ship and now 've lost you, Elaine
'm getting out
Simon,  didn't want it to end like this
We can be friends
You'll die out there
Maybe
Simon, what are you saying
Simon steps into a hatch labeld, " "
'm saying,  can't take the singles scene again, Elaine
The hatch door slams shut
passenger passes with a sandwich board that reads, "
" Simon, no
Jimmy appears and yells through the window on the hatch
You want to talk about it now, Commander
The capsule ejects
' The Commissioner stands in front of the painting of astronauts on black velvet
He is on the phone
Give me the President of the United States
Tell him it's the Commissioner
(to Kruger) don't know how the old man's going to take this
The  poses for a photo session:   of President holding aloft in a victory salute, the hands of two black men
On the camera flash we  to reveal the bodiless arms of two black mannequins
An  hands the phone to the President
Houston, sir
(taking phone) This is the President
What
What
He walks past a wall of photos of past presidents:  , Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Reagan older, Reagan much older, Merv Griffin, a chimp, and this President
: don't think that shuttle's going to make it, sir
The President passes an Arab piling millions in cash onto his desk
Damnit, Mister, the dignity and integrity of this presidency depends on the success of that mission
And that's my last word
Yes, sir
They both hang up and, making sure no one is watching, pick their noses
What's our strategy on this one, sir
work for the people of these United States, Frank
have to do what's best for them
(grabs the red phone) Al, kill social security, cancel school lunches only for the poor, dismantle welfare, close all hospitals and public toilets, green light the -6, invade Brazil, and bring my horse around after my nap
Ted is at the controls
Elaine rushes in
Simon just ejected
Sit down, Elaine
If this bomb trick works we just might make it
Simon was a fool to eject now
You mean
That's right -- premature ejection
What will happen to him, Ted
The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds
He'll roast like a pig on a spit
- We see a roast on a spit through the window
The clock on the time bomb  down
(looking at wristwatch) Are you afraid
Not when 'm with you, Ted
guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this
Mrs
Gooch sucks on her cushion -- she's totally zonked on acid
Are you afraid
(looking at her hands) Are these my hands
' (to Stella) Are you afraid
'm a nurse
can't afford to be afraid, Father
(to Scraps) Are you afraid, Scraps
(he  once, subtitle translate) Now when there's a guy like Ted Striker up there, Jimmy
(he  one more time -- subtitles) Now how about a little scratch on the inner thigh
Testa stands over Ted with a clipboard
Fifty-six percent of the passengers are afraid
Twenty-nine percent are not afraid
Eight percent are undecided and seven percent think Israel should give back Finland
You better strap yourself in, Testa
(on radio) Mission control, this is Mayflower
Over
McCROSKY (
) Go ahead, Striker
(on radio) We've got about 60 seconds before that thing blows
We're set to reprogram for Mercury at zero point five
McCROKSY (on radio) Zero point five
(
) That's right
When the bomb explodes we're going to have a ten foot hole in the fuselage and  want to get there as fast as  can
know what this snip can do, McCrosky
McCROKSY (to Controllers) No one's ever travelled at that speed before
Last spring we did Europe in nine days
- It careens towards the sun
Bomb clock  down
Mary instructs Passengers
Heads between the knees
(looking down aisle) Between your own knees, Father
'Flanagan looks around guiltily
McCrosky addresses his troops
McCROSKY don't find it easy to talk at a time like this, but  want to say something about that guy up there
can sum it all up in one word -- courage, dedication, spirit, pride, selflessness, and g-u-t-s, guts
Striker's got more guts in his little finger than most of us have in our large intestine
He's got guts up to his eyeballs, guts coming out of his ears
Controllers start playing cards, doing needlepoint
McCROSKY Sure it's a cliche but great shortstops are born, not made, and a clown is funny in the circus but when he gets on the highway, he's murder
It bugged me too when Mr
Ed refused to talk when the neighbors came over but
The bomb  down and
The ship shakes violently
Ted fights for control
- :
The ship starts bumping as if it's hit a rough road
(on radio) We've blown the computer
(to Elaine) Elaine
Set course change
(flips a switch) Set
Now
(pushes a button) Compute
"Compute" sign flashes
Ted pulls an acceleration lever
Here goes
- It slows to a halt
Ted pulls the lever hard toward himself
The ship shudders
- The ship slingshots in the opposite direction, disappearing into the void leaving a trail of light
-  , "0
5 " (on radio) Point five
Controllers looking intently into the night sky
to Mrs
Salucci intently gripping her vibrator -- it's on to Jacobs reading  -- headline: " " McCROSKY Zero point five , that's half the speed of light
We really have no idea what can happen to the human body at that speed
Two Passengers (contortionists) with legs up over their shoulders and looking out over their rear ends, play cards
The interior vibrates
psychedelic blaze of multi-colored light illuminates the interior
Ted struggles with the controls
McCROSKY (
) Striker, we're monitoring you
You're right on course
At that speed you should hit Mercury in about six minutes
So give yourself enough time to kill those engines
McCROSKY (on radio) We'll be out of radio range in a few seconds
'm going to put you in contact with Mercury Base Alpha Beta for your final descent
Over
(off mike) Stinson, who's in command of Alpha Beta
Al Hammil
3 Not anymore
It's Rex Kramer, now
McCROSKY Not Rex Kramer
3 No, Rex Kramer
- We see the Alpha Beta base in distance with an neon sign flashing
:
:   , - :
Four uniformed officers race to their posts around a corner and collide with four others racing around the corner from the other direction
- watches the floors flash by on the panel above the door
-  , " 1 -  " we hear a   and fighting with something
know this guy, Ted Striker
flew with him during the war
He was a crack pilot but he didn't have it in the crunch
That is
-  , " 3 -  " Until that day over Chicago
He brought that busted up 767 out of that storm like a paper glider coming outta the baby blue
-  , " 5 - ' , , "
" 6 -  "
But flying that shuttle is a whole different ballgame
The elevator doors open
Kramer steps out into the communications room
:
down to floor of elevator to find a young officer -- Carey -- torn to shreds and fighting off Kramer's golden retriever dog
The doors close
Kramer approaches an What's the latest, Lieutenant
They'll hit our atmosphere in about three minutes, if they hold together
They've lost their computer and are coming in at zero point five  on manual control, sir
Ted shifts a stick shift on the steering column
Kramer looks at the big screen
:
Down scope
submarine periscope drops
Kramer looks for the shuttle
He'll never bring that thing in on manual, but  guess Striker's their only hope
- It's his ship now
He's the top dog
- The big man
The numero uno honcho
- The head cheese
-        -- Kramer steps away from the scope
It drops down
man in a barber chair is on the other end of the steel column and comes to rest on the floor
2 Sir, we have radio contact
Testa talks to the passengers
Psychedelic lights flash
(yelling) We're travelling at one half the speed of light
There is nothing to worry about
However, you might experience some temporary metabolic changes
Her beard grows
- flurry of hands empties it in two seconds
He has turned into a Hassidic Rabbi
Ted is fighting to maintain control
(
) Striker, this is Rex Kramer on Alpha Beta
Do you read me
Over
Ted and Elaine give startled looks of recognition
(
) That's right, Ted
Rex Kramer
We've locked you on track beam
You're going to have to kill those  engines in exactly thirty seconds
Over
Everyone tensely looks out the window into the night sky
McCROSKY There's nothing else we can do for those people out there now, except pray
The entire room explodes in an up-beat Southern Baptists' rendition of "'       "
(
) Now, Striker
Kill
Ted pushes his  lever forward but it comes off in his hand
Ted, the lever
(on radio) Kramer, the  control handle just came off in my hand
(
) Try another handle
There are no more handles, only switches
(
) No buttons
(looking around madly) Just switches, lights, and knobs
(looking at buttons and levers on his panel) 'd give my right arm to get just one of these buttons or levers up there right now
(on radio) Okay, Striker
You're going to have to pull that lever panel off
(to Elaine) Screw driver
She hands him a vodka and orange juice
Ted throws it on his face
He reaches down and rips the panel off, exposing all sorts of wires
(
) Now find a piece of metal and stick it in there
Ted looks around for a piece of metal
Elaine pulls a bobby pin from her hair
Will this work, Ted
Her long brown hair falls sexily
She sweeps it back with a toss of her head
Ted is overwhelmed by her
Thanks
(on radio) 've got something that might work
(
) bobby pin
Kramer and Aids exchange a look which questions Ted's sexuality
What the hell is a man doing with a
forget it
(on radio) It'll have to do, Striker
Ted sticks the bobby pin into the wires
Sparks fly
The ship starts slowing up
:
- It's working
Kramer stands in front of the huge screen
small ship appears in the distance coming right at us
(on radio) Okay, Striker
We have you on visual
Just keep her level
- It careens towards the planet surface
It starts bouncing wildly
She's coming apart
Passengers scream
- The anchorman screams
:  ""
- The anchorman screams
:  ""
(In Russian looking print
) - The desk clerk screams
(
) Keep her nose up
Don't fight her
'm trying but she's fighting me
boxing glove springs from the dash punching Ted in the face
Ted, that's Alpha Beta
- We see the lights of a small colony on planet surface
The Alpha Beta neon sign is visible
Kramer sits in a large swivel chair -- like Captain Kirk's on the Enterprise bridge
As he talks, he nonchalantly swivels so his back is to the huge window
We see the Mayflower approaching on the screen
(on radio) Now, Striker, there are a few things you have to keep in mind as you get close to the planet's atmosphere
They watch in horror as the Mayflower comes shooting at them
(on radio) First and foremost you have to make one very important decision
Elaine looks out the window -- horrified
Ted
We're not stopping
Ted fights the controls
(
) Is this a landing you're sure you can make without endangering the lives of your passengers
They run for cover
The Mayflower comes right at the screen and crashes through it
Kramer still has his back to the screen and doesn't notice what has happened -- the room behind him has been totally demolished
(on radio) Now, once you've made that decision you have to be very clear about your responsibility to those people on that ship
The front window is broken
Ted and Elaine are covered in debris
Elaine's eyes grow wide with terror again
Ted
group of scientists stand at a keyboard synthesizer
One plays the series of notes from
Suddenly the Mayflower appears over a hill
They all jump for cover as it crashes through the synthesizer
Ted and Elaine are covered in piano keys
(
) Their lives, their futures, their goals and aspirations are in your hands, Striker
The Mayflower bounces across the surface
Mary maneuvers down the aisle
Passengers are screaming and being tossed around
(to one passenger) Seat backs up
Thank you
She looks up and sees feet dangling from the ceiling
man has gone right through the ceiling up to his waist
(looking up) Sir, you really must take your seat
(on radio) We're all with you on this one, Striker
Now get ready to position landing gear, cut engines, and fire your retrorockets
- The Mayflower careens to a smoking, crunching, shattering stop
Mary and Testa start directing panic-striken passengers to the exits
(on radio) Timing's of the essence on a lame duck approach, Striker
Don't fight her
Hold her steady
Nose up
- Ted and Elaine stand looking down on the wreckage
In b
g
, , emergency lights flash across Ted and Elaine
(
) You'll be all right
Everyone's going to be okay
Ted holds Elaine
(
) Don't fight her, Striker
Hold her
Hold her
Stay with her, Striker
Ted and Elaine kiss
(
) Now, hit your landing gear and cut those engines
(on radio) Timing's everything, Striker
Fire your retro-rockets
- Ted and Elaine walk off into the distance
:
(
) (voice fading) Now give her full flap and keep that nose up
Okay, now
Ted, what's going to happen to us
Ted stops and looks into the distant, dark sky
printed crawl begins: : , ,  , : , Ted and Elaine walk towards crawl and are approached by two strange  -- bald with a shock of hair sprouting from the top of their heads
