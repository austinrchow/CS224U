Written by Tom Shadyac & Mike Binder Rough draft, April 1996 -- Two dozen  listen to their teacher,
The word "Work" is on the blackboard
"Work
" Today we're going to share what our parents do for work
of a series of five-year olds standing beside their desks, addressing the class: My dad is a truck driver
My mommy is a doctor
My dad is a librarian and my mom is a vegetarian
(with difficulty) My father is a struck-sher-al- engine-ear
- My mother is an actress
She works at Denny's
My daddy works at a place where they make stuff, and my mommy is a mommy
(looking a little ) My father is a postal worker
The   end with : My mom's a teacher
As Max starts to sit: And your dad
() My dad
He's
a liar
(taken aback) liar
don't think you mean "a liar
" Well
he wears a suit and goes to court and talks to the judge and-- () Oh
see-- you mean he's a lawyer
Max shrugs
-- , early 30's, stands before the
His manner is utterly genuine and convincing
dark street
a stormy night
two desperate men struggle
one man is taken to the hospital, the other to ja il
The prosecutor wants you to believe this is an open-and-shut case of a poor man, brutally victimized
He nods at the victim - - a fragile   in his 70's
(') Well, for once  agree with t he prosecutor
This is an open-and shut case -- but the true victim is my client
Fletcher's  is a 250 pound brute in a suit
(') Put yourself in his shoes for a moment--walking home from church, alone, in a frightening part of the suburbs
As he describes his client's movements, Fletcher : (') You're nervous, timid, looking over your shoulder -- when suddenly, you encounter him-- (pointing at the old man) pouncing from the shadows
You quiver in fear
The streetlight flashes on something shiny in his hand-- a knife
Suddenly Fletcher becomes the attacker, brandishing a weapon
The jurors
(') And in that terrifying instant you do what any respectable citizen would -- you defend y ou rse lf
Only after you shatter his arm and collarbone do you realize it's all a mistake
the man was merely walking away from an machine, the apparent flash of metal caused by his bank card
He reveals the weapon in his hand is only a credit card
(') () As you stand over his crumpled, though potentially still-dangerous form, your he art goes out to him
You want to help
First, you gather up the many bills he dropped, to stop them from bl owi ng away
Second, in an effort to get the name and number of someone to notify, you take his wallet
Finally, you leap into the man's Lexus to head for assistance, when suddenly a police car speeds up
You breathe a sigh of relief: "Someone to look -after the injured man
Oh joy
" But do the police applaud your initiative
Do they hail your heroism
No-- they arrest you and throw you in the slammer
He walks along the jury box: (') And why
Why does the State turn its massive power against this individual
(takes an moment, then answers his own :) Discrimination, (to a black ) But this time it's not based on race
(to a female ) Not based on gender
(to a man wearing a crucifix) Not based on religion, (to a heavy set ) No--this time it's discrimination based on size
know what the prosecution wants you to think - - i t ' s always the big guy's fault
Is that what we've come to as a society -- persecuting people because they're large
Fletcher points accusingly at the opposition
(') Shame on you, Mister Prosecutor
Shame on you
(turning back to ) The state is trying to barbeque my client on the spit of Justice
Only you can douse the flames
The decision is your s
And please
don't let your emotions run away with y ou
The fact that my client is a family man, raising his sons alone after the tragic death of their mother, has absolutely no bearing on this case
In the front row we see two sad-faced
(') Instead, let cold reason be your guide as you decide the fate of this church-going, orphan-rasing widower
Fletcher returns to his seat
Jurors, dab their eyes
-- Fletcher bounds down the stairs, passing a fellow , How's it going, Fletcher
(he' s won) Another gratifying day serving Justice
Fletcher's huge client catches up to him
Hey great job, Mr
Reid wish there was some way could show my appreciation
Stay out of my neighborhood after dark
carrying, a clipboard approaches Fletcher
Mr
Reid, do you have a moment-
No, 'm late picking up my son
-Because a couple of reporters want to interview you about your big win today
Fletcher instantly shifts directions
How's my hair
And he's off to woo a
- sad Max and his mother, , wait silently on the steps
What time is it
(checks her ) ' m sure he just got tied up in court again
Finally, Fletcher's  pulls up
Max races to him, delighted
Dad
Maximillian
(calls out a ) Fletcher instantly becomes a human version of the making   and
Max knows the routine well, moves in perfect sine with dad
Until --
Malfunction in vector 3
Malfunction in vector 3
(pretends to lose control of a 'robotic' arm) Look out
It's on tickle mode
Fletcher's "mechanical arm" becomes -, like crazy
Max loves it
Audrey watches these two kids, smiles
(re: Audrey) And who is this lovely lady
Max, could you introduce me
That's no lady, that's mom
Thanks, Max
Mom
(under his ) Himnm
don't remember her looking that good, (becomes the robot again) Malfunction in Vector 4
Malfunction in Vector 4
Fletcher's other robotic arm becomes a "pincher", comes after Audrey
() Keep Vector 4 away from me
Unless you want Vector 4 chopped off
You know, you were much easier when we were married
(re: her luggage) So where are you off too
Stanford
'm delivering a paper
h really
Where  live, we use a boy on a bike
Hey mom, dad's taking me to see wrestling
( ) Oh, Fletcher
( mimicking her) Oh, Audrey
Do you have to take him to tho se things
They're so violent
Fleccher  the familiar wise, old / The boy must learn the way of the war rior
An d wh o be tter to teach him than Rowdy Rod-
Piper and Big John Stud
Audrey can't help but
/ He must be schooled in the way of the face-claw, the sleeper- hold, and the purple nuxple
For only then-- () Shut up
/ (to Max) The squaw will never understand us
It's the good-natured, affable
Max runs up to him
Max, my man
Jerry gives Max "five", then kisses Audrey on the lips
Fletcher, good to see you
What
No kiss for me
(re: luggage) What do you say, Max
Give me a hand
Fletcher grits his teeth as Jerry gives Max a piggyback ride to get the luggage
(to Audrey) didn't know the boyfriend was going
Jerry
His name is Jerry and yes, he's going
Audrey heads inside
-
Audrey enters, shuts the blinds
o Stanford
Overnight
Does this mean you two are
(cringes, can't say the words) 've been seeing him seven months, what do you think
was hoping that after being married to me, you'd have no more strength left
Well you have to remember when we were married,  wasn't having sex nearly as often as you were
've been hit
/- -            '              ' Audrey locks up
Well, great
'm so happy for you two
am just Mister appy man
Happy, happy, happy
Relax, Fletcher
It looks like Jerry's taking that job offer in Boston
Fletcher turns sincere
Aud,  am so sorry
Behind her back, he  in celebration
She glances back
He stops, whistles innocently
(calling to ) Ready
Audrey and Jerry say goodbye to Max
They get in his Explorer
(to Audrey) Yo u gonna be okay
Because if not, we could leave Max with your sister and  could go out with you two, does that appeal to you at all
They drive off
Wave to the soon-to-be ex- boyfriend, Max
(flipping Max the ) You drive
- '- Fletcher is driving, Max beside him
Dad, are we really going to go to wrestling
Absolutely, Maxattacker
We just have to stop by the office for one minute
Max
He's heard this before
- Establishing the headquarters of ,  & As they head inside, Fletcher and Max pass a
'Scuse me, sir
Do you have any change
(patting his ) 'Fraid not
Sorry
- Fletcher grabs The Daily Journal, paying for it with a His son takes this in
On their way to the elevators Fletcher and Max pass , a dweebish bore
Fletcher
Philip
And this must be Max
(trying to brush him off) Yes
Yes it is
Well, it was good seeing you-- Fletcher starts off with Max, when Philip calls after him
You know, Ethel and  had a blast at our last little get- together
Oh, me too
can never get enough of charades
We'll have to do it again sometime
Fletcher heads into an open elevator
only to find the door's closing impededby Philip's foot
When
Soon
The door again begins to close
when Philip stops it
How 'bout tonight
Not that soon
'm taking Max to see wrestling-- We love wrestling
We could-- don't think so
See, Max is really shy around strangers
Max looks up at Fletcher
He isn't
(') Tell you what -- give me your card as a reminder
'll call y o u
Soon
Promise
Great
Philip hands him his card just as the door closes
- Max watches as his father  '
- The receptionist, , greets them
Jane has an , large   is on her desk
Hi, Mr
Reid
(indicates, her ) What do you think
Fabulous
love it
(indicates the ) What's this
don't know who sent it
But it's for Mr
Allan
It's his anniversary
Ah
The Partnership Committee meeting still scheduled for Friday
(as she goes) Yep
Fletcher quickly removes a gift card from his pocket, scribbles on it, puts it in place of the one already there What are you doing
Oh, 'm
fixing the card, (shows him the old card) Look, they spelled Mr
Allan's name wrong
Have an apple
'  - Where a troubled   is talking to , a beautiful, steely partner
can't do it
Fred, it's your duty to present the strongest case possible
The strongest case possible, consistent with the truth
Let the Judge decide what's true
That's what he gets paid for
You get paid to win
If you insist on my taking it to trial, 'll represent Mrs
Cole aggressively and ethically
But, Miranda -- won't lie
Miranda looks out her window, calculating
Then we'll just have to find someone who'will
-- Fletcher strides through the hallway with Max, calling out to his colleagues
Hey, Pete
Great tie
Max looks at , -whose fashion-disaster tie startles him
Thomas--looks like you're losin' weight
glances up from a file
Max notes that he's corpulent
Gained three pounds
(wedging past ) On you, it works
Fletcher arrives at his office
his secretary, the fiftyish,
worldly-wise and world-weary
' ax
What's new
Well
it's my birthday tomo rrow
We're having a party and everything
Flet cher's
He has clearly forgotten
'm sure your dad'11 give you something wonderful
Fletcher tries to wave her off, awkwardly stopping when Max turns to him
Yeah
Oh, yeah
You're going to love it
Uh, why don't you play in my office for a minute
Fax something, sue someone, have a good time
We'll be leaving in a second
Max heads into the office
Fletcher closes the door behind him turning it into a silly, two-handed wave
(') Damn
completely forgot
Oh, there's a surprise
Greta produces a wrapped
You're a saint
should get you something
You did
She holds up another, smaller package
Ah
Well,  always do the classy thing
Any calls
She hands him a stack of mail
Let's see
( ) Judge Patterson's clerk
He needs your filing
Tell him it's in the mail
(jotting down a ) Right
You'll do it next week
Mr
McKinley phoned, questioning that fourteen hours you billed on Christinas Eve
Write him a long, explanatory letter
Then bill him for the letter
(jotting down a note)
Done
Your mother called
' m on vacation
This is your fifth week
It's a long vacation
(jotting down a ) "Break mother's heart
" Done
And that's it, except Miranda's looking for you
(checking watch) As if  don't have anything better to do than bow and scrape at her royal perfumed p artner feet
Tell her 'm in court
Court's closed
Tell her  broke my leg and had to be shot
() Why don't you tell her yourself
As Miranda approaches, Fletcher switches gears in an : --And then send out a notice of judgement on my win today
() 'll get right on it
Fletcher turns -- and pretends to be surprised
Miranda
didn't see you
Hey, you look lovely, today
Here,  bought you a gift
He grabs Greta's gift and hands it to Miranda
Thanks
heard about your victory today
You're making quite an impression on the partnership committee
( ; ) Oh, that's right
You folks are meeting again soon
"Allan, Stewart, Konigsberg, and Ried
" There's something about the rhythm of fours
It's like a full measure
Well, anyway, 've got a client waiting in my office-- Actually, something important h as come up
You're not busy tonight, are you
Before Fletcher answers, we: : '  - sad Max sits on Fletcher's big sofa
His heart sinks further when Fletcher enters
carrying two boxes of documents
We're not going, are we
Of course we are
promise i s a promise
We are gonna see wrestling or my name isn't Fletcher
Reid
(to wrestler) Could you hand me that
(the wrestler ) Thank you
(without looking ) We are having some fun, eh Maxer
on Max; he isn't
- Jerry paces
Audrey is on the phone, waiting
She notices Jerry pacing
Are you alright
Uh, yeah, just, uh
how long are you gonna be on the phone
just wanted to say good- night to Max, but he must still be out with Fletcher, (hangs up) () Will you marry me
She's
Uh
would
What did you say
() proposed,
Look,  know this Boston thing is a great opportunity, good job, mo ney
everything
But started to think about being three thousand miles away from you and Max
And  didn't like it
-- Look,  know it's a lot to ask, to move and everything, but
love you
love your son
Will you marry me
She stares at him, excited, but nervous
- Early morning outside Fletcher's building
'  - Fletcher types on his computer
He's been up all night
He leans back, rubs his eyes
When he opens them he sees Max standing there in pajamas
Fletcher
Max Factor
Happy birthday
How old are you today
h ir t y
Forty
Five
Well, you've held up well only wish there was some way to commemorate such an occasion, some small symbol to mark this day, like
Fletcher produces -- present
Max eyes it with wonder
What is it
(no idea) It's
it's
(it hits him) a surprise
Max knows his father doesn't have a clue but he rips the box open, revealing, a , , ' , and Baseball stuff
_J Baseball stuff
(hugging his dad) Will you play catch with me
' Absorootentootenlutely
Max beams
Tonight
After your party, you have my word on it
Max nods sadly as Fletcher turns back to his work
'  - Jerry and Audrey are driving
Audrey's holding a couple of airline tickets
(re: tickets) Jerry, these are for tomorrow
The company wants me to get started right away
can't just pick up and move to Boston with two days notice
Ju st come check it out
You a nd Max, see the town
Let's pick out a place together
Then, if you want to turn me down and scar me for life, fine
It's just not that simple
What about my job
've been at  three years
It's New England
They're lousy with colleges
You can't swing a bat back there without hitting a college
You'd get a job there in a second
There are other factors involved
() here they are now
They pull up in front of Fletcher's building where Fletcher and Max are waiting
Fletcher's still reviewing a file
As Audrey gets out of Jerry's car, Max runs over
Did you have fun
How were the wrestling matches
Big fun
Manly fun
Am right, Maxie
(-) It was fun
(re: Audrey) So how were the wrestling matches
Did you have fun
Max , my man
My happy birthday man
Max and Jerry exchange "fives" and'a hug
Jerry gives Max a light punch on the arm
One-two-three-four-five
and one for good luck
Did you see that
He struck the child
Look what dad got me
(shows the glove) Whoa
Great
have my glove in the car
We'll stop in the park on the way home and play c atch
Then tonight we'll oil it, wrap a rubber band around it
It'll be great
(to Fletcher) Great birthday present, dad
Fletcher hates him
Jerry and Max go to Jerry's car
(makes a fist) When is it his birthday
Some thing's come up
We need to talk
Mom, let's go
want to play
(to Fletcher) We'll talk tonight
Tonight
Max's birthday
' Oh , yeah, right
Seven knew that
did
blocked it out weeks ago
The se ven tee nt h of May
Max's birthday
It's the eighteenth
The seventeenth of May is the day
remind myself that the eighteenth is Max's birthday
See you tonight
They drive away
'  - Miranda, and Fletcher's new client,  , an alluring woman in her early thirties/ review the document he spent the previousnight putting together
This is good
This is really smart
Thank you
Only i t ' s
Like not true
Every word of it is a lie
Fletcher and Miranda exchange glances
(') mean
isn't that a problem
Mrs
Cole, the only problem here is that after you've provided years of faithful service and loving support, of raising his children -- They are his
m
Oh yeah
One for sure
After all that, your husband wants to deny you a fair share of the marital assets based on one single act of -- Seven
Hm
Seven single acts of indiscretion
--Seven acts of indiscretion, only one of which he has any evidence of, and all of which he himself is responsible, for
He is
Mrs
Cole,  stayed up all night last night studying your c ase
Not just your case
b ut you
And, by now,  feel know you
You are the victim here
The wife of a cold, distant businessman
Starved for affection, driven into the arms of another man-- Seven
(not missing a ) --Seven
other men
You're not trying to deny him what is r ig htf ull y his
All you're insisting on is what is r ig htf ull y yours
And maybe an idgy-smidgy bit more think you're bending over backwards
Well,  did agree to give him j oint custody of the kids
(to Miranda) He's always been a good father
And you've always been a good wife
(getting worked ) Yeah
There's such a thing as being t oo nice
That's why you need aggr essive representation
To show the court that there is more than one side to this st ory
All 'm asking is the opportunity to see that justice is done on your behalf
(takes her hand) Will you give me that opportunity
He stares into her eyes
moment, then
Yes
' m tired of getting kicked around
Good for you
Thank you, Mr
Reid
' m so grateful  have an attorney can trust
he gives him a  and momentarily grabs his ass
With a farewell nod to Miranda, she leaves
Miranda turns, smiles at Fletcher, then shuts the door
She moves in on him
You're good
You're really good
Oh, pshaw
(pronounces it with the "p") She picks a piece of lint off
his jacket
o,  mean it
The Cole case is worth a truckload of money to this firm, not to mention the press it's going to g en er at e
You win this case and  guarantee you'll make partner
( his tie) Actually, how would you like to make a partner right now
Excuse me
She grabs his lapels and pulls him in for a deep
,   '   - in progress,  being entertained by a in a clown suit and clown make-up
() Captain Fuzzy is my name, Making children happy is my game, With a shake and a juggle, And a big belt buckle, You'll all be glad  came
' He flops down on his back causing something in his pants to Audrey and Jerry watch
(indicating the ) What do you think
Well, if you don't hire your brother, who will
She heads into
- They called me again from oston
They really want me there tomorrow
can't go to Boston
How come
Max
He'll love it there
It's Fletcher
Fletcher
can't move Max three thousand miles away from his father
Audrey,  have never said a bad word about your ex -- know
But how much responsibility does Fletcher take for Max, now
He'd never come over if you didn't remind him
know
But if they're three thousand miles apart they'll never see each other
Fletcher will never come to Boston and how can  send Max cross-country to him
So because your ex-husband is unreliable, we can't-'- know, it's not logical, it's emotional
'm sorry
Pause
still want to marry you
Are you sure
Jerry picks up the , pulls out a piece of paper, dials
(into phone) Mr
Crisitelli, Jerry She
ton
hope 'm not calling too late
Mr
Crisitelli, 'm afraid  have to turn down your offer
'
So am
Well, 've fallen in love with this beautiful woman in
and she doesn't want to leave and  won't leave without her
Well, thank you very much
Yes, good-bye
(hangs up) He wasn't there, but that's 1   the speech  would've made
She smiles and  him
The
Audrey answers
Hello
: '  - Fletcher, where are you
We're getting ready to cut the cake
Urn, actually, something has come up
problem on a new caaa--
Miranda bites one of Fletcher's nipples
-h-h-h-
What happened
Nothing
just nailed my knee into the desk
Listen, 'm really sorry  can't 'make it
Max is going to be so disappointed
'll make it up to him, promise
'll pick him up from school tomorrow, okay
Do you want me to put him on the phone
Miranda starts "reeling in" the phone cord
Ah, no
have to go
Right
, she hangs up
Fletcher stares  at the phone, before Miranda
'   - from banners reading  ,
to a room full of guests
to a desultory five-year-old
Audrey finishes lighting the candles on the homemade cake
All right, birthday boy, make a wish
Max doesn't respond
(') 'mon, honey
It can be anything-- whatever you want most in the world
When he
doesn't respond, she leans down to him
(') Max, your dad is sorry
He had to work
He said he was coming
He promised
Yes, well, he
promises he'll see you tomorrow
Max doesn't believe it
(
) wish, for just one day, Dad couldn't tell a lie
He takes a breath --and blows out all the candles strange  blows the drapes and the wisp of smoke up, up, up
to the clock on the wall
It's 9:15
: clock on a wall
It's 9:15'
We are-- '  - around Miranda's office, where the displaced sofa is adorned with Fletcher's shoes
To the credenza, where Fletcher's pants hang
To the lamp, where Fletcher's shorts swing
To the desk, where a ravished Miranda lies next to Fletcher
Superbly confident of the answer, she asks-- o
was it good for you
Without thinking, Fletcher responds in the most astonishing way possible-- he
've had better
Miranda turns to him in disbelief -- but it's nothing compared to the    on Fletcher's face
'  - The door opens -- and the naked Fletcher is forcefully kicked out
He goes  over a desk as a follow
The door   again, leaving him without his pants
stares at him in shock, then takes her broom, aims for his crotch,
and
- An alarm
Fletcher   in bed
With regret and wonder he remembers: "'ve had better
" '  - Fletcher brushes his teeth, looks up at his reflection in the mirror, mouth foaming
"'ve had better
" '   - Dressed for work, Fletcher waits for the elevator
(laughing it off) "'ve had better
" t arrives
He steps in
- The elevator is empty, except for Fletcher
and a beautiful young
New in the building
just moved in Monday
Ah
Well, you must allow me to give you the grand tour
(' ) h
Do you do that for all the new tenants
No
Just the ones  want to bang like a drum
Fletcher's face  extreme  and
- We  a  off camera and a  as the elevator door opens
The model storms off and   Fletcher steps out, rubbing his freshly slapped face
-, Fletcher strides toward the courthouse
when he is accosted by a
Any change, Mister
Absolutely
But he continues walking
Could you spare some
Unquestionably
Fletcher walks faster,  that he has answered truthfully
The beggar is even more puzzled
Will you
No
How come
Because  resent your p re sen ce
You fill me with an unpleasant mixture of disgust and guilt
Further,  don't believe you'll use the money for food, but  believe you'll use it for, at worst, drugs, or, at best, whiskey, or cigarettes
Also, 'm cheap
As Fletcher heads up the stairs
Jerkoff
- winded Fletcher joins Virginia at the respondent's table, You look like you're having a rough morning
've had better
He  as he recognizes the words
Then, an extremely wealthy, respectable industrialist,   enters with his attorney,  , young, brisk, confident
Good morning, Fletcher
Dana
" All right, Virginia, how much will it take to put an end to this
Fifty per cent of your estate
Richard is
Fifty per cent
With a pre- nup and proof of adultery
What's your case
Our case is simply this
Fletcher opens his mouth to enlighten her -- but he ' He tries to   , but succeeds only in looking like a fish gasping on dry land
Interesting, though based on your track record,  expected a little more
Nearing panic, Fletcher whirls to his  and grabs the brief
Wa it
Wait
've got it in writing
But when Dana tries to take the document, the astonished Fletcher finds himself
Let go
'm trying
He  snatches the document away and to a nearby   where he throws it out
At this moment the  calls
All rise for the Honorable Judge William Stevens
Very funny, Fletcher
You want to play hardball, 'm game
takes the bench
Calling case  09395, Richard Cole versus Virginia Cole
How're we doing this morning, counsel
Fine, thank you
And you, Mr
Reid
Well, 'm a little upset about a bad sexual episode  had last night-- Fletcher screeches to a standstill, suddenly aware of what he just said
After an awkward silence-- () Well, you're still young
It'll happen more and more
In the meantime, what do you say we get
down to business
First, Mr
Reid,  see that your client was previously represented by Mr
Rand of your office
Yes, Your Honor
take it you're seeking to substitute in as counsel
Yes, Your Honor
Fine , fine
And for the record, the reason is
Mr
Rand had severe ethical objections to my client's case
Fletcher is incredulous
Somehow his greatest asset in the world, his mouth, has become his worst enemy
take it you don't share the same ethical objections, Mr
Reid
have lower standards, Your Honor
see
Well, if Mrs
Cole wants the substitution of counsel, 'll allow it
Is that what you want, Mrs
Cole
Virginia looks to the judge, then to Fletcher, whose unorthodox syle seemed so brilliant earlier
() Yes
Fine
(aside, to ) What are you doing
() don't know
(to judge, with ) Your Honor,  ' d like a continuance
" This case has already been delayed several times, Mr
Reid
realize that, Your Honor, but  ' d really, really, really like a continuance
'll have to hear good cause, counselor
What's the problem
'
The  begins to  slowly -- then faster -- then faster -- until we wind up squarely on -- ' can't lie
() Commendable, Mr
Reid, but 'm still waiting for the good caus e
Now, do you have it or not
' () Not
Motion for a continuance denied
Is there any chance of a settlement in this case
don't think so, Your Honor
Mr
Reid made it abundantly clear that the last thing in the world he wanted was to -- () Dana and Mr
Cole look at Fletcher with surprise
There appears to have been a change in strategy
Let's go to my chambers and negotiate
He  the gavel
'  - Dana and an apprehensive Fletcher sit before the judge Your Honor, under the terms of the prenuptual agreement, if Mrs
Cole commits adultery, she is entitled to nothing
We have in our possession an audiotape made by a licensed private investigator of an explicit act of sexual congress with a man who is not her husband
Sounds pretty damning, Mr
Reid
It certainly does
However, my client has no desire to see his ex-wife destitute
Against my advice, he's willing to offer her a cash settlement of
two point four million dollars
Two four seems like a pretty fair offer, Mr
Reid
Fantastically fair
Phenominally fair
In fact, 'd say beyond fair, bordering on stupid
Dana fumes
The judge finds Fletcher's boldness refreshing
What are you suggesting, Mr
Rei d
That Ms
Appleton's willingness to proffer such an offer betrays a lack of faith in her position
(utterly sincere) No, not at all
She's got my client dead to rights
When attorneys go to sleep at night, they dream of having a case as strong as hers
Can the sarcasm, Reid
All right,  admit it -- 've seen you make even the lamest case fly
But this time  have you
Even Clarence Darrow couldn't explain this away
She brandishes the audiotape
Wel l, Mr
Reid
without a dynamite explanation, 'd say you're dead in the water
How's you client's story
The best that money can buy, o u r Honor
Strong corroborating evidence
We have evidence that you are not going to-believe
Despite herself, Dana is beginning to look worried
You're pretty confident how this trial is going to come out, eh, Mr
Reid
(hopeless)
"Confident" is too weak a word, Your Honor
am certain what will happen if take this puppy to trial
The verdict will be a stunning, humiliating defeat that will cut a spectacularly promising legal career off at the knees
Fletcher is referring to himself, of course, but Dana thinks he's speaking about her
She buckles
All right
Double the offer
Four point eight
And not a penny more
(venomous, to ) Bastard
She storms out, leaving an astounded Fletcher behind
You are some negotiator, Mr
Reid
If your client has half a brain, she'll jump at the offer
: No
We are -- - Fletcher has joined Virginia at the respondent's table No
Mrs
Cole, this offer was a miracle
'm talking about a walking-on-water, Lazarus-rising-from-the-dead, -----'- miracle
You've gone from two point four to four point eight million in
(checks his ) four minutes
Think of it this way -- now you're getting paid seven hundred thou per schtupp
Mr
Reid, you convinced me yesterday -- 'm the victim here, starved for affection, driven into the arms of another man-- Seven
-- Seven other men
With the story you came up with, don't think  can lose want to proceed
Mrs
Cole, you don't
understand, -- But before Fletcher can finish, the judge enters
Well , Mr
Reid
Do we have a settlement
Fletcher looks pleadingly at his client, but she is firm
He shakes his head unhappily
The judge is irritated
(') Th ere' s no settlement
Trial to start at one-thirty sharp
He  the gavel
Fletcher emits an involuntary whimper
- , Fletcher makes his way down the hall
Jane comes toward him wearing a hairstyle that resembles a nest
He tries to avoid her, but
What do you think
think you need help
, Fletcher hurries on
The heavyset Thomas ambulates in his way
- What's shakin', Fletcher
Your cellulite, Tubster
The now panicked Fletcher breaks into a run, passing Fred
Hiy a, Fletcher
How's the Cole case going
(not stopping) 'Straight into the crapper, you wuss, with my career right behind it
Fletcher is  ,    and so as not to hear   '

Fletcher speeds past-- Hi, boss
What's happening -- '
' , '
-- And races into his office
'  - He leans against the door, trying to catch his breath
, () Do n't panic
You can beat this -- it's all a matter of willpower
He dives for his desk and rifles through it

Something small
Aha
He holds up a

Red

The color of this pen is--blue

He takes a sheet of , his pen and writes "This pen i s

He
He's out of his chair, on the desk
His feet    on the shelves'behind him
He finally forces pen to paper
He looks down where he wrote : "This pen is blue

Greta enters to find-- running around the office, shaking the blue pen in the air
Boss, what's wrong
The pen is blue
The pen is

The Almost weeping, he collapses into a chair
moment -- then Greta tentatively offers him a red pen
Red
() Oh, that's easy for you to say
Are you all right
(getting up) have to go home
Home
Was the case settled
No
have to be in court at one-thirty
Well, then how can you
go home
don't know,  don't know
Okay
(walking on ) Before  forget -- Rubin and Dun n called
They want to know where the Darvis settlement offer stands
only proposed a settlement t o dick with them
never had any intention of going th ro ug h with it
Not certain why her boss would
shoot himself in the foot, Greta nonetheless jots down his remarks
'
dick with them
" Okay
Your accountant, Philip, called to remind you about getting together
'd rather shave my ass and sit in vinegar
(jotting down a ) Got it
And your mother called again
Are you still on vacation
( nodding "yes") No
So then you're here
( shaking his head "") Yes
' m having a little trouble following you
what do  say to your mom
() Tell her 'm a thoughtless son who'd rather spend ten hours clogging the wheels of justice than five minutes talking to her-- but only if she asks
You
might also add that she deserves better, though  hope to God you don't
Thanks for clearing that up
And that's it, except your ex called and asked when you were cowing over to see your son
() '
He reacts, particularly stunned by this truth
-  / '  - Audrey is driving Max, who wears his new baseball uniform when her cellular
She picks it up
We  between car and office
-- ' Hey, Fletcher
was wondering if you were going to still pick up Max after school today
don't think  can
had a case  was certain would settle and it didn't
have to go to trial this afternoon, God help me
(not believing ) Right
It's true
really do want to see Max, today
Fletcher considers what he just said, realizes it is true
(') How about that
really do
() But things keep coming up at the last minute
Yes, but-this time it's different
see
And how is that
( he walked into ) This time 'm telling the truth
But last night you weren't
No
What were you doing
Having sex
(barely holding her temper), It must have been with someone very "special
" No
It was with someone don't even like
But thought it would help my career and at the moment that seemed more important than attending my son's birthday
y God
She   the phone
' Fletcher    against his head in frustration
'
- The Volvo parks
Audrey gets out
She leans over to say good-bye to her son
,
Is dad picking me up
No, 'm sorry, Max
He can't make it
will
'll work it out
Max is disappointed
guess my wish didn't come true
What wish
wished that, for just one day, Dad couldn't tell a lie
Max heads toward his teacher
Audrey is deeply moved
' He's dialing the phone
Answer, answer, answer
' Hello
Audrey, let me explain
Something has happened to me-- Fletcher, something else is about to happen to you
What do you mean
Max and  are moving to Boston
What
Jerry asked me to marry him
He wants Max and  to fly with him this weekend to pick out a house
And 'm going to go
God knows  don't have any reason to stay here
(panicking)
Wait, you can't move
If you take Max away
'll practically never see him
Well then you'll have pretty much the same relationship you have with him now
Audrey, please
Is this because of what  just said on the phone
That was the straw and this is the camel's back saying goodbye
Where are you
Heading home
When you gee there, stay there
'll be right over
We have to talk
-- 'll be right- there
He hangs up and heads for the door
It opens and Miranda enters
(') Aaaah
Flet cher
Fletcher, Fletcher, Fletcher
must confess-- after last night's incident, was
hurt
So hurt
was tempted to do whatever little things lie in my power to scuttle your chances of making partner
Fletcher is
(') But then  thought, "No, that 's not fair
Fletcher didn't mean to insult me
" ( his tie) "It was just some massive, boneheaded misunderstanding, and Fletcher is very, very sorry
" Fletcher smiles
It looks like he's off the hook, until-- (') Isn't that right, Fletcher
(in agony) Uh -- not really, no
(stunned, angry) o
No
What are you sayi ng
Have you no respect for me
None, whatsoever
mean,  ' d like to respect you, and if it weren't for your mistreatment of the associates, your rudeness to the staff, and the fact that your work sucks, would
But -- what about last night
was afraid you wouldn't support my partnership if turned you down
Plus,  have an immature need for sexual conquests
- e
The door flies opens -- and a furious Miranda stalks off
'  - Fletcher rubs his freshly  FACi
-  / ,  - Fletcher speeds away
He pulls the blue pen from his pocket
Gotta focus
gotta focus
He's so preoccupied that he speeds through a crosswalk and almost hits an
The color of the pen is -- re d
But he hasn't regained the ability to lie -- he's referring to the   he just ran, nearly colliding with a truck
The  screams: What's your problem, schmuck
(the truth) ' m an inconsiderate prick
Fletcher once again focuses on the blue pen
( ") 'mon, you can do this
The color of the pen is --
This time he's referring to the flashing red light of a in his rearview mirror
hi t
Fletcher pulls over
strolls up
Do you know why  stopped you
Depends on how long you were following me
Why don't we take it from the top
(in agony) Here goes --  didn't fasten my seatbelt,  didn't glance in my rearview mirror, didn't signal when  pulled away from the curb,  sped, followed too closely,  ran a stop sign,  almost hit :a Chevy Camaro,  almost hit a ge ezer,  sped some more, failed to yield at a crosswalk,  changed lanes in the intersection,  changed lanes without signalling, and changed lanes in the - signalling while running a red light and speeding
long moment
May  see your driver's license
No
And why is that
It's in my other pants
see
And where are your other pants
Hanging from my boss's credenza
Do you expect me to believe that
No
Do you think 'm an idiot
Yes -- but that's beside the point
My license actually is in my other pants, and they actually were hanging from a credenzaJ  wouldn't lie to you
mean,  would if could, but  can't
see
So you
have no reason to try and hide your license from me
didn't say that
have other reasons
Seventeen reasons, to be precise
(begrudgingly, off the officer's look) Unpaid parking tickets
() Be gentle
'  - cab speeds up to the house
Fletcher runs out
Audrey is headed to her car
Audrey, wait
Wait
You know,  just had an insight into myself
' m crazy
You call me up and
tell me to wait here because you'll be right over and -- here's the crazy part -- actually wait
can explain-- missed a department meeting
Did you come in a cab
Yes
Where's your car
,    - Audrey finishes paying the impound-yard  and joins Fletcher, who is waiting alongside hundreds of towed cars
Thank you
can't tell you how much this means to me
can
One thousand, six hundred, and fifty-four dollars and eleven cents
Ow
At this moment   a hideous scraping noise -- and a -  whips Fletcher's  into view and
parks
revealing a prominent new scrape on the door
(') You scratched my car
- Where
Right there
- Oh that
That was already there
() Why, you -- you liar
Do you know what  ' m going to do about this
- What
(angrier and ) Nothing
Because if  take you to small-claims court, it will just drain eight hours out of my life, and you probably won't show up, and if finally got the judgment you'd just stiff me anyway, so what 'm gonna do is piss and moan like an impotent jerk and then bend over and take it up the tail pipe
- You've been here before, haven't you
He flips Fletcher the keys and goes
Well  can't remember when 've had more fun, now if you'll excuse me,  have a class
She starts out
Audrey, wait
want to talk to you about this Boston situation
What do you want to say
You can't go
It's not fair
Taking Max three thousand miles away is not fair
Let' s define "fair
" Last night a five-year old boy was crushed because his father lied to him about coming to his birthday party
Fair
Last night-- -- Was none of my business
When it happened two years ago it was my business, but now don't have to care anymore
See, that's the magic of div orce
But it does matter to Max
Everything you do matters to him
and everything you don't do
All right-- now let me tell you something
you're absolutely right
'm guilty of all charges
'm throwing myself on the mercy of your -court
Audrey doesn't know what to say
Fletcher seems very sincere, but she can't trust him
{') have an idea
'll come over tonight, right after court lets out and play with ax
Have him invite some fri ends over
We'll have a game and everything
Then, you and  can sit down and talk
We're suppose to be on a plane -- No, Audrey
Just talk to me abou t this first
Please
Au drey, 've lost you
Don't make me lose Max, too
You're really coming
This is iron-clad
This is the mother of all promises
What time
Six
Ten-to-six
() All right
only if  tell Max you're coming and you don't show up and  have to see that look on Max's face -- that heartbreaking look-- it's Boston, Fletcher
will be there
As Audrey gets in her car --
hope so
Do you know what your son was doing at nine- fif teen las t ni ght
He was making a wish on his birthday c ake
He was wishing that, for just one day, his dad couldn't tell a lie
She drives away
Fletcher starts for his car, pensive, when a new thought strikes him
Oh my God
That-'s it
An innocent kid - - a heartfelt plea-- a birthday wish
Sure, it' s impossible --but it 'makes sense
If he can wish it, he can unwish it
Fletcher marches quickly down the hall, cake box under his arm
' Ms
Berry's reading a story when Fletcher enters
Max brightens
Dad
Are you Max's dad
' m Ms
Berry, Max's teacher
Hi
Listen,  need to talk to -- Mr
Reid, we were just talking ab ou t careers
You're a lawyer, aren't you
() Yes
Mr
Reid it'would be wonderful for the children to hear something positive about lawyers
Well, actually-- Children
Mr
Reid is going to tell us what it's like to be a lawyer
She leads the kids in
Fletcher takes center s tage
The children stare, rapt with attenion
Uh, hi
Uh, 'm a lawyer and work at a big law firm with a lot of other lawyers and do stuff in a law court
Thank you
He starts out
One moment, Mr
Reid
Maybe some of the children have (hands shoot up) Jeffrey
What kind of lawyer are you
Mostly,  ' m a divorce lawyer
What's that
It means if you're daddy left your mommy, he'd call me
So what do you do
(growing more and more impatient) help people fight over their money and their children
Can't they fight without you
' " They could but then  wouldn't make a living
Why would my daddy leave my mommy
To marry a younger woman
To escape a loveless marriage and have cheap meaningless sex
To cling to an illusion of youth as his body gives way to sore backs, flat feet, spare tires, gum disease, hair loss, liver spots, kidney stones, clogged arteries, diabetes, goiter and eventual death
The kids
moment, then: () Well,  think it's time for fingerpainting
- They're in the playground just outside the classroom
Monster-Max
Dadzilla
You came to play catch
No
' d like to, but  can't right now
Max is disappointed again
(') ' m sorry  missed your party la st night
How was your Uncle Glen
Stupid
His big nose and stupid orange hair
That's why he should have worn make-up
Fletcher elbows Max, playfully, trying to induce a laugh
Max doesn't laugh
'
want to play kickball with my friends
- Yeah, okay, urn
Your mother told me about
the wish you made last night
It came true
Max is amazed
Really
You mean you have to tell the truth
Yes
No matter what
No matter what
Max grins -- then suddenly asks, in rapid succession
Is wrestling real
In the Olympics, yes
On
Channel 23, no
Will sitting close to the set make me go blind
Not in a million years
If  keep making this face-- (makes a horrible ) will it get stuck that way
Uh-uh
If  go in the water right after lunch, will  drown
Only if you can't 'swim
Why do  have to eat squash
Because your mom buys it
How come you're always too busy to play with me
The sudden shift in tone startles Fletcher
He feels awful
don't know
' m
Hey, you know 'm coming over to nig ht
We're gonna play together
Baseball
Yes
This is absolutely an -number one promise
You and -- tonight -- baseball
Fletcher and Max do their ritual "five" slap
Now, listen, Max,  need a favor from you
' m in a little trouble today
need you to take that wish back
So you can lie
Not to you
To who
Max, sometimes grownups
need to lie
It's hard to explain, but i f
Look, here's an example
When Mommy was pregnant with you, she gained a little weight
Se venty pounds
thought she was gonna give birth to a car
But she'd say to me "How do lo ok
" So 'd say, "Oh, honey, you're beautiful, you're glowing
11 Otherwise, would've hurt Mommy's fee ling s
Understand
Max nods
You didn't think she was beautiful
Right
No
Max,  don't know how to get along in the grown-up world if  have to stick to the truth
could lose my case,  could lose my promotion,  could even lose, my job
Do you understand
Max shakes his head "no
" (') Will you help me anyway
moment -- then Max reluctantly nods
(') That's my boy
Fletcher opens the box, revealing a cake and candles
He takes out two birthday hats
He puts one on Max and one on himself
(') Now, do whatever you did last night
only this time, make an un-wish
Not really happy, Max turns to the candles on the cake
He takes a breath-- and blows them out
did it
^ Great
Great
Now to test -- Fletcher spots an attractive  teacher
Fletcher hurries to her and says something
moment
Then she Fletcher returns to his son
Did it work
(rubbing his sore ) Not like  ' d hoped
Did you really unwish it
Max nods
Only
Only what
Yesterday, when  wished it, r ea lly meant it
This time when  unwished it  only did it 'cause you told me to
(losing patience) Well, then do it again
Only this time, mean it
can't
Why not
Because  don't want you to lie
explained this to you have to lie
Everybody lies
Mommy lies, even the wonderful Jerry lies-- But you're the only one who makes me feel bad
'
Fletcher is stunned by how much this hurts
() Max, recess 'is over, come on in
have to go
am coming over, tonight, Max
You believe me, don't you
Max hesitates, then nods
(') 'll see you tonight, buddy
That's a promise
Max heads back to class
Fletcher picks up the cake, looks at it, then dumps it in a trash barrel
- worried and preoccupied Fletcher is heading toward his office building when a   passes by
Yo, Fletcher
How's it hanging
Short and shrivelled
Fletcher hurries up the steps when he spots Philip
He shields his face with his briefcase
Philip recognizes him anyway
Fletcher
'm still waiting for your call
guess you must've lost my card -- No -- Or my phone was busy -- No -- Or you just forgot -- No -- (cannot be ) Or something
So anyway,' why don't you swing by my place around seven-thirty
Philip starts off, when Fletcher calls after him resolutely
Philip
don't want to come over to your house
long moment, then -- Fi n e
We'll go out
There's this new karaoke bar 've been dying to try
'll pick you up at your office
Seven- thirty
And he runs off
Frustrated, Fletcher hurries on
' - Fletcher drags himself past Greta's desk
Miranda gives him the stink-eye
Fletcher doesn't see her
Do you want your messages
No
He goes into his office
Greta is concerned
She follows him in, leaving his door open
'  - Fletcher collapses onto his couch
Greta enters
Are you okay
My son hates me
No
He loves you
've seen y ou together
You're his hero
h yeah
Last night at his birthday party, he made a wish
That  wouldn't be able to tell a lie for one whole day
Kids
It came true
What
It's true
Didn't it seem odd to you that  kept telling the truth all morning
Well, yeah, but
() You're telling me that you can't lie
That's right
am incapable of lying
Miranda is 'eavesdropping
wicked gleam in her eye, ' Just today
Apparently until 9:15 tonight
It's a twenty-four hour curse
Yes, those are going around
You don't believe me
Of course not
Go ahead
Ask me something ' d normally lie about
She thinks
ll right
Remember a few months ago,  wanted a raise-- () Forget it
Let's not do this
-- and the firm wouldn't
give me one
And  asked you if you would give it to me out of your own pocket and you said the company wouldn't permit it because it creates jealousy among the other secretaries
Was that true or did you just not want to pony up the dough
Greta is emptying all her personal effects into boxes
She's leaving
Fletcher is on the phone and looks very harras,sed
Greta, please
(into phone) Yes Judge Stevens, hi
Fletcher Reid
' m scheduled to be in your court in half- an-hour
Judge Stevens, badly, badly need a continuance
so  can go home and stay there the rest of the day
111
Am  ill
He wants to say "yes", but he can't
In a way
(covers the ) Please, lie to him for me
Greta holds up a framed photograph
remember when you
bought me t hi s silver frame
From Tiffany's
() Tiffany's
Jumbo's House of Junk
She thrpws it in the trash and keeps packing
(') 'll give you the raise
(gives him the ) Here's your raise
(into phone) Hi, Judge Stevens
Yes, know  haven't given you a reason
The
(') (into phone) But if you could just do this for me, -- The phone won't stop ringing
' (') Hold on, please, (pushes two ) Hello
Mom
The phone flies into the air
He catches it
{') Mom
Well,  wasn't actually on vacation
Because didn't want to talk to you
Because you insist on talking to me about Dad's bowel movements -- size, color, frequency
'll call you later
No, not really
He pushes -two more buttons
Then
(') Oh dammit
cut him off cut off the Judge
Greta
He falls to his knees
(') 'm on my knees in a nine hundred dollar suit
Don't leave
Greta stops
She seems to consider
few years ago a friend of mine had a burglar up on her roof
Yes
burglar
-He fell through the kitchen skylight and landed on a cutting board on a butcher's knife, cutting his l e g
He sued my friend
The burglar sued my friend
Thanks to guys like you-- he won
My friend had to pay him six thousand dollars
Is that justice
No
but what' s your poijit
My point is, it's hard to get justice
But this is justice, (pinches his ) Have a nice day in court, bubbie
She leaves
Fletcher starts to give chase
-- He runs directly into Miranda
Aaaah
Miranda smiles like a cat that's trapped a mouse
Ah, Fletcher, so nice to bump i nto you
Are you busy
Extremely
Good
Would you follow me, please
Highly nervous, Fletcher follows Miranda down the hall
(') Fletcher, did you know that the partnership committee is being headed up by Mr
Allan himself
(off his wary ) Say, you used to work directly for Mr
Allan, didn't you
(off his waried ) Tell me, what do you think of him
() He's a pedantic, pontificating, pretentious bastard, a belligerent old fart, a worthless, steaming pile of cow dung
() How delightful
She swings open a door, ushering Fletcher into -- - The room is filled with , including
, the founder himself
Fletcher freezes
Pardon me for interrupting your, meeting
Mr
Allan, you remember Fletcher Reid
It's good to see you again, Fletcher
'
An involuntary  from Fletcher
Oh, that's right
You used to work together
Tell me, what do you think of Mr
Allah
Fl etc he r gulps
This is it
His career is history
He's trying to hold it back, but-- said
What do you think of Mr
Allan
He's a pedantic, pontificating, pretentious bastard, a belligerent old fart, a worthless, steaming pile of cow dung
Then --Mr
Allan bursts into raucous He is joined by everyone except Miranda, who looks on,
Everyone pounds the table in hysterics
Marvelous
Marvelous
That's what  love most about this firm-- the collegial atmosphere, the hearty good- fellowship
Miranda is incensed
(') And thanks for those flowers for my anniversary
My wife loved them
Well, 'm due in court
bye- bye
- Fletcher exits the conference, closes the door, breathes a sigh of relief, then
of Fletcher, seated alone at a table
His hands are on his-face
He looks totally dazed
At the other table, sit Dana Appleton and Mr
Cole
All rise
They do
Judge Stevens enters
He sits
Everyone sits
Counselors, are we ready to begin
(eagerly and a little too ) o sir
We are not ready to b eg in
My client has not arrived
The doors  and Virginia Cole enters with her and a
--   until now
He collapses into his chair
(to Falk, with ) Did you and Mrs
Cole ever make lo-- forni-- roll in the h-- make the beast with two ba -- Did you two ever fu-- fu-- Fu
He begins to hyperventilate
Virginia turns to Falk
Wate r
Get him water
Falk hurries into the building as Fletcher hacks on
Fu-- fu-- it down
Get some air
(slaps him on the ) Try to relax
Breathe deeply
Falk hurries out with a cup, hands it to Fletcher, who downs it in one gulp -- then spews it out again, in
- (') hat
What
couldn't find any water, so got him coffee
Fletcher runs up and down the steps, frantically fanning h is scalded mouth
The bailiff appears
Judge is taking the bench
Fletcher's expression turns to terror
- The judge settles in
Mr
Allan and a smug Miranda look on from the gallery
You may proceed, Mr
Reid
Everyone turns to Fletcher in anticipation
In a voice quaking with fear
Sorry
One of the kids threw up in the car
Virginia takes her seat, leaving her two young children sitting dejectedly in the gallery with their nanny
( ) You brought your kids
to your divorce
(by way of ) Sympathy
Well, it's working
feel sorry for them already
The judge  the gavel
Ms
Appleton, you may begin
: Dana Appleton questions , a private investigator
Fletcher watches with mounting anxiety, from a    at his table
(referring to his ) -- From March six through June twelve,  surveilled Mrs
Cole at the behest of Mr
Cole
During that period,  noted that Mr
Cole left each day between seven-forty and seven- fifty
Thereafter, Mrs
Cole would frequently have a male visitor arrive and stay for one to four hours
was able to take several photographs of the male visitor
He shows a photo - - o f a strapping hunk
Fletcher see
And do you
know what Mrs
Cole and her male visitor did during their frequent
visits
Well, they were pretty good about keeping the shades drawn -- but  sure was able to hear
made an audiotape of one such
, "session
" e hands her the tape
Fletcher refills his glass
With the Court's permission, would like to play the tape
Your Honor,  object
And why is that, Mr
Reid
(can't help ) Because it's devastating to my case
The judge is startled by his candor
Overruled
As Dana pops the tape into a player, Fletcher anxiously Periodically  to Virginia, Mr
Cole, Dan and the thirsty Fletcher, we hear Virginia and her visitor engaged in intense physical activity
(
) So , what did you say
You ready
(
) Oh boy am  ready
(
) Good
Let me help you off with that
Come on, lie down
(
) Wai t a minute
Do you have protection
(
) Right here
Okay, now  ' m gonna show you something new
(
) Oh, 've never done it like this before
(
) Don't worry, you can take it
Oh yeah
That's it
There you go
Yes
Yes
labored rhythmic breathing
(
) (') Yes, yes, yes -- As Dana fast-forwards again, then resumes
with still more labored breathing, building intensity and -- (
) (') Oh yeah, bring it on
home -- yes
Yes
Yes
(
) Yes
The groans reach their incredible climax
There's a still moment
As the shy  , the macho  and the no- nonsense judge all mop their brows, Dana shuts off the tape
She turns to Fletcher with a satisfied smile
Your witness
No questions
No questions
No questions
(afraid to ask ) No questions
() Petitioner rests
All right, Mr
Reid
You may proceed
(to himself) How
Gathering his courage, he stands, downs the last of his water, and moves to the lecturn
He's about to speak
when a   sweeps through him
After a momement, he grins
(') Would the Court be willing to grant me a short bathroom break
It can't wait
Not unless you want to mop up
() All right, but get back in here immediately so
we can finish this
Fletcher beams
Then necessity compels him to race out
- Fletcher stands before the urinal, taking the longest leak i n legal history
Relief
Then, he looks at his watch
It's only 4:15
' What did  think
That could piss for forty-five minutes
He    in frustration
and gets an idea
He    and , ,     ,    , finally , where he continues his attack
enters, hears a commotion from behind the stall door
What's going on in-there
(
) ' m abusing myself
Do you mind
The man looks disgusted
He carefully leaves the room
- The judge is
Suddenly the bailiff helps in the severly beaten Fletcher
The entire courtroom is
found him like this in the bathroom
Somebody beat the hell out of him
Who did this
() madman, Your Honor desperate fool at the end of his pitiful
rope
-What did he look like
( ) About five eleven, hundred eighty-five pounds, crazed look in his eye
Bailiff, have the deputies search the building
rises
He bangs the gavel
(') Under the circumstances, have no choice but to recess this case until tomorrow morning at nine
Fletcher smiles serenly -- until -- (') -- Unless, of course, you think you can still proceed
Fletcher covers his mouth in a desperate attempt to avoid answering, but he can't repress the truth
(') Can you
Yes,  can
Splendid
admire your courage, Mr
Reid
'll give you a few minutes to compose yourself, and then we'll get started
Fletcher looks as if he has just been sentenced to death
- Fletcher sits on the courthouse steps, miserable Hello
Dad
(summoning up ) Maxi-pad
How's it going
Great
You know Paul and Emanuel from across the street
The twins
() Well, they never want to play baseball with me, but  told them  was gonna play tonight with my Dad, so now they want to play with us
Is it okay
Sure
Oh boy
We're setting up a whole field in the yard
Where we buried Petey the hamster is second base
(Fletcher sighs) You're still coming right
' (sees Virginia ) '11 be there
gotta go now, Max
'll see you in two hours
Max hangs up
(to Audrey) He's really coming
She smiles, but she's worried
Virginia approaches with her handsome lover,
Mr
Reid, you remember Laurence Falk, the man from the tape
How are you
've slipped into the seventh circle of Hell, thank you, and you
Virginia exchanges an anxious look with Falk
Shouldn't we go over our testimony
Well, basically the plan is walk you through the tape step by step,  ask you questions-- And we give the explanation you came up with
Exactly
So all we have to do is lie
Sounds simple enough
Do esn't it
And 'll finish up with a dramatic series of questions, something like
"Mr
Falk, isn't it true that you and Mrs
Cole have never made lo--" But Fletcher
He '
The others look concerned, but he waves them off
(') Sorry
'm fine
"Mr
Falk, isn't it true that you and Mrs
Cole have never made lo-- - To his horror, he  ,
unable to form the word
(to himself) Oh my God
can't do it can't finish the question if know the answer is a lie
At this moment Miranda and Mr
Allan come up the steps
Don't let me interrupt, Fletcher
just want you to know 'll be observing this a fternoon
Miranda insisted see you in action
Fletcher shoots a hateful look at Miranda
She smiles
(') 'm looking forward to it
Go get 'em
Mr
Allan and Miranda head into the building, leaving Fletcher more desperate than before
'mon
Gotta rephrase the question
Respondent calls
Lawrence Falk
Fletcher's clears his throat
Here goes
Mr
Falk, do you know my client, Virginia Cole
Yes
Isn't it true that your relationship with my client is entirely platonic, not
The "not" was
It takes everyone by surprise
Excuse me
If  might rephrase your Honor
(trying again) Is your relationship with my client entirely patonic, not
\ Is your relationship with my client not entirely platonic
Is not your relationship with my client entirely platonic
(thinks he's got it, beams with ) Mr
Falk, is not your relationship with my client entirely platonic
() No
mean, yes
think
Yes, is your relationship with my client not entirely platonic, or yes, is not your relationship with my client entirely platonic
What
How 'bout just answering the question you think 'm asking
' Your Honor, he's badgering the wintness
It's hig witness
Did you ever not make lo-- Did you not ever make lo-- (losing it) , '
' Falk looks shaken as Fletcher barrels on, unable to stop (screaming at ) -
(breaking down) , ,-- ' from the audience
All eyes are on Fletcher
() No further questions
Uh
no questions
(to Fletcher) Call your next witness
have no further witnesses, your Honor
erupts from the crowd
You have no further witnesses
Fletcher meekly shakes his head, no
(whispers, to ) What are you doing
Call me
(to Virginia) can't
Mr
Reid
Call me, damn it
You don't understand
can't lie
Until nine-sixteen tonight,  can't even
ask a question that calls for a lie
Virginia     , pulls him  to her face
is ten , you bastard
want m y money
am not gonna wind up a 31 year old divorce on welfare because my scum bag attorney had a sudden attack of conscience
Fletcher suddenly stops -- focused on something Virginia said
(to himself) Thirty-one
Mr
Reid, we're not getting any younger
Fletcher quickly looks at the blowup of Virginia's prenup and her passport
(he's had it) Mr
Reid you have presented virtually nothing in the way of evidence and as such  have no choice but to rule in favor of -- Silence
() Your Honor,  call Virginia Cole to the stand
Stunned, Virginia nervously makes her way up, (in the gallery) What the hell is he doing
Kissing his career goodbye
The Baliff stands before the witness
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help -you God
do
Fletcher approaches,
,
Mrs
Cole -- may  call you Virginia
Yes
But that would be a lie, wouldn't it
What do you mean
Isn't your true name
( ) Carlotta
Well, yes
But it wasn't me so  started using Virginia
Is there anything wrong with that
Not really
It's just the first and smallest in the tissue of lies that is the Kleenex of your life
Let's take one simple document as a sample of your veracity, shall we, Carlotta
He grabs her purse from the desk, rifles through it, Your driver's license
What color are your eyes
Blue
Tru e blue
What if  asked you to remove your contact l enses
What color would they be then
() Brown
And here it says you're a b l on de
Are you
(off her silence) 'mon, Carlotta, there's a very easy way for us to check
If you don't remember, perhaps Mr
Falk will
Brunette
More like a dirty brown, isn't it
(she nods) Let's see -
- " Weight: one-o- five"
Please
One-eighteen
(off his look) One-twenty-six
swear
So on this single document, you basically lied at every opportunity
'm sure a woman as vain as you would also lie about her age
It says you were born in 1964
What's the truth
1962
'60
How young did you try to make yourself
() Wrong
didn't lie to make myself younger
made myself older
was born in 1965
" ( ) What
You're trying to tell us you lied to make yourself older
Yes
"  lied so  could get married
So
there Mister ' ------ went-to-law-school'
Mr
Reid, does this have a point
Oh, you bet it does, your Honor
(on a roll) My client lied about her age because she was only 17 when s he got married
Which makes h er a minor
And in the great state of California, -- (defeated, to ) Prenuptual agreements
(knows he has ) This contract is void
The fact that my client gets nailed more often than a two-by-four is irrelevant
Standard community property applies and this woman is entitled to half of the marital assets or thirty-seven point three-nine- five million dollars
(to Dana) Yo
a e
u         r
() Nothing further, your Honor
(banging his ) uie t
Let me see-the license and birth certificate
All is quiet while the Judge reviews the documents
Then: In light of this new evidence, the court must rule in favor o f the defense
Mrs
Cole is hereby awarded half of the marital assets -or thirtyrseven million three hundred and ninety-five thousand dollars
The courtroom
'
Dana, Mr
Cole are devastated
' That son of bitch pulled it off
Mr
Allan gives Fletcher a thumbs-up; simultaneously, Miranda gives him the finger

Order
Now i understand both parties have agreed to joint custody
Is that correct
-- No
'm contesting custody
Fletcher freezes
What
(re: her husband) Payback
For him trying to prevent me from collecting my thirty-seven million
He was entitled to prevent you
You committed adultery
' You only won because you're a liar, remember
No
You pointed out that my husband took advantage of a poor underage girl
was the vic tim here
And now 'm going to hit him where it hurts
But -- but -- you said he was a good father

Reid
Do we have an agreement on custody or not
Fletcher takes a distressed look at the children
No
In that case, there will be a custody hearing tomorrow mor ning at nine
Court is adj ourned

Everyone gets up, but Fletcher's attention is drawn to a commotion between Virginia and her kids
Stop that
We're leaving now
want to go with Daddy
,' ,- - Fletcher watches, horrified, as she drags the kids away from their tearful father
Don't worry
'll see you no matter what
promise
Mr
Allan has made his way up to Fletcher
(re: the ) love kids
They give you so much leverage in a case like this
(pats Fletcher on ) Congratulations, partner
how does it feel
And with that question asked, as he watches poor Mr
Cole and his kids, the truth dawns on Fletcher like a sledgehammer
' Excuse me
Just a second
(to the Judge) our Honor
Your Honor
Wait
We',re adjourned, Mr
Reid
Screw that
She lies and she wins
What are we, nuts
Everyone stops, watches Fletcher
(') his woman --my client -- goes down with the frequency of a nuclear submarine and we just gave her thirty seven million dollars because she's a liar
And now as an extra added little bonus, we're going to let her steal, the kids, too
Mr
Reid, you are out of order
() ' '
Do you ever stop to ask yourself, why do people hate us
Could it be because what we did here today sucks
We don't care about the truth
We don't want to find the t r u th
We want to win
We want to win at all costs
and you know what the worst thing about wanting to win so badly i s
Winning and finding out you're left with nothing
That's enough, Mr
Reid -- -Let' s see what ' ve done today

Max nods
Fletcher's at a loss for how to begin
Then: You wanted me to stop lying
But lying isn't the problem
Why we lie ~ that's the problem
Sometimes we lie to make someone else feel better
But sometimes we lie because the truth gets in our way

Much more important things

Max, you made the wish at 9:15

No
It wasn't a lie
