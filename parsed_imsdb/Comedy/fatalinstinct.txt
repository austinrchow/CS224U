" " Screenplay by David 'Malley : - The sultry dampness of a blistering summer hangs in the night air
People stroll the boardwalk looking for a cool breeze
The soft rhythms of a jazz concert float from the band shell
- and a woman's shapely legs, walking along the wooden pier
&
After several steps, a discarded piece of gum sticks to one of her shoes, stretching out stickily
Two steps later, a piece of paper sticks to the gum, flopping awkwardly with each step
The     her gorgeous legs and sensuous body
She wears a loose summer dress that floats like gossamer around her soft curves
Her hair is long and blond
(
) To some guys, women are like a cheap puzzle
with pieces that just don't fit
They think the soul of a woman is darker than a back alley
more tangled than a telephone cord
and colder than a Klondike Bar in Canada
But those guys don't even have a clue
She stops at the railing
We see an incredibly beautiful face and cool, alluring eyes
This is
The term "femme fatale" was coined for her
She's on display
and knows it

) When you know women the way  do, you understand exactly what what makes them tick
what makes them hum
what makes them jiggle up and down when they walk
And it's not the kind of thing you can learn from a correspondence course

One is  , in his thirties, stalwart, handsome, hair trimmed neatly, but with a feel of loose ends about him
coat slung over his shoulder, sleeves rolled up, the sweat dampening his shirt
He's a cop
plain clothes detective who's been around the block a few times and still gets lost
Next to him is , his partner
Older, if not in years, at least in mileage
Dependable, solid, with no great aspirations except to reach the end of a shift intact
He's eating Nachos from a cardboard container, licking the cheese off his fingers
The    to
His eyes are fixed on Lola
-  - ' She walks to the other side of the pier
as more paper sticks to the gum on her shoe
She stands at the railing
(
) There are two kinds of women in this world
and 've known 'em both
- Arch heaves an exasperated sigh and looks toward Ned
The to
It isn't "voice-over" narration at all
Ned is actually talking out loud
(
) One will take you for a fast ride on a bumpy road with no seat belt
But the other kind
(interrupts) Jeez
knock off the chatter, will ya
Just trying to keep you awake, Arch
'm awake
Where do you come up with all that crap about women
It's true
Women are very complex, but if you know how to read 'em
they're an open book
You can always tell the rotten apples from the peaches
Are you kiddin'
'd stake my career on it
Anybody ever proves me wrong, 'll throw away my badge
Aayyhh
women are trouble
used to believe that too
Until married Lana
Now, she
is a peach
Yeah, well you're a lucky stiff, pal
Ya hold down two jobs
Got a beautiful wife waitin' for ya at home
Everything a guy could ever want, including  kids
'd love to have kids
What
Rug-rats
Give me a break
(looks around) Jeez,  hate stakeouts
What makes you think Milo's gonna show up here
Logic
He knocked off all those banks
He's got cash
He's gonna want to spend it
This is one of the few places that still takes cash
Sooner or later
he's gotta turn up
And how we s'posed to recognize this scumbag
The "Support Hose Bandit"
When you see him
you'll know him

,  , the "Support Hose Bandit", ambles by casually, unnoticed, sucking on a cherry Snow-Cone through the panty-hose pulled down over his head
These are the best damn Nachos in North America
Maybe the world
He pops the last chip in his mouth, licks his fingers and turns the container over
'm empty
'm gonna get a refill
You want some
Ned shakes his head
Arch heads off to the Nacho stand
Ned steps over to the railing
gazes out at the ocean
begins to wail a scorching, romantic melody
a recurrent tune that will come to be known as '
beat later
Lola moves to Ned's side at the railing
He tries to ignore her presence, peering into the darkness
Lola digs in her purse for a pack of cigarettes
Got a light
Sure
Ned pulls out a small flashlight, shines it in her purse
She pulls a cigarette out of the pack, puts it to her lips
her eyes on Ned, sizing him up
How about a match
No thanks
have plenty
He pulls out a handful of matchbooks, shows her, then stuffs them back in his pocket
He turns and walks along the pier
She falls into step beside him, lighting her own cigarette
saxophone player named follows behind them, continuing to play
He's the actual source of the romantic   we've been hearing
You really are incredibly stupid, aren't you
like that in a man
'd be insulted, but  know you're serious
You sound so sure of yourself
'm not as dumb as  look
Let me buy you a drink, Mr
uh
Ravine
Ned Ravine
And you are
Thirsty
What about that drink
'm on duty
Brain surgeon
Cop
Oooo
and  bet you have a big gun
You lose
Lola looks toward a nearby hot dog vendor
If  can't buy you a drink
(nods toward vendor) let me buy you one of those
Who can say no to a weiner
Not me
Lola turns to the hot dog , raising two fingers
Two dogs
Hot
She takes them
hands one to Ned
He picks up the plastic mustard container to put mustard on her hot dog first
You come here often
Only when 'm in heat
Ned  to this, squeezing the container
stream of mustard squirts out, hitting the front of Lola's dress
Oh
Sorry
Flustered, he stuffs his hot dog into his inside jacket pocket, then tries to wipe the mustard off Lola's dress, smearing it all over her, making it worse
She watches him with a cool, detached gaze as he fumbles ingenuously
Suddenly, Ned stops, looking off
He sees
Milo Crumley going into the
Ned starts to leave
Lola grabs his hand, holding it tightly against her breast
Where ya going
Get something to wipe it off
That's okay
You're doing just fine
'll get you a wet paper towel
He heads for the men's room
signaling to Arch, who's waiting in line at the Nacho stand
Arch motions at the long line
all
shrugging helplessly
'    - Several  are at the urinals
Milo, still wearing the panty hose over his head, washes his face at the sink
He looks up, sees Ned enter
Ned sees Milo
reacts, pulling the frankfurter out of his pocket and pointing it
Hold it right there, Milo
The Men turn, seeing Ned pointing the frankfurter
Look out
He's got a weenie
Milo bolts, slamming into Ned, knocking him back through the door of a stall, into the lap of the  inside
'  - Milo bursts out, colliding with Arch
They both go down in a flurry of Nacho chips and cheese
Arch helps Milo to his feet, apologizing profusely
picking up the gun that Milo dropped, handing it back to him
Milo sprints off down the pier
beat later, Ned bursts out the door
dashing after Milo
- Milo runs frantically, knocking people aside
He ducks into
- and drags a   out of a bumper car, jumps in, and speeds away
beat later, Ned runs up, followed by Arch
Ned flashes his badge at a -  in one of the bumper cars
Police emergency
need your car
He pulls the kid out, jumps in, slaps a portable on the dashboard
then speeds off after Milo, a He zig-zags through the crush of other bumper cars in the pavilion
Ned's bumper car catches up with Milo, pulling alongside
Milo turns the wheel,  Ned
Ned  him back, both bumper cars swerving violently
spraying
Ned  Milo's car again
Milo loses control, spins out and  into the pavillion railing
Ned swerves to avoid a collision, but  into two other bumper cars, wrenching to a grinding halt
The inflates in his bumper car
Arch runs up as Ned pulls himself from the wreckage
They turn to see Milo leap from his mangled bumper car, leap over the pavillion railing and dash down the pier and into an alley between two buildings
sign on the building says: Ned and Arch eye each other, shake their heads, and follow after Milo
Sequence omitted from original script
Milo runs into a tall chain link fence at the end of the alley and scrambles up the wire mesh
Suddenly, Ned's hand shoots out, grabs Milo's ankle, yanking him down hard
Milo jumps to his feet, swinging at Ned, who catches Milo's fist with his hand, stopping it cold
neatly snapping a handcuff on his wrist
He shoves Milo's arm against the fence and snaps the other cuff to the chainlink
flashes out of Milo's other hand with a sharp Milo slashes the blade at Ned, just missing his face
On the backswing, Ned parries with his own switchblade and flips Milo's knife away
Milo pulls a
45 Calibre  with his free hand
Ned shoves his finger into the end of the barrel
Milo looks surprised
then sneers, clicking the hammer back
You take science in high school, Milo
skipped high school, cop
Then you're probably not familiar with the theory of inverse proportionate explosive dynamics
What about it
If you fire a weapon with the barrel obstructed, the explosive force multiplies by twenty-three point five nine eight and reverses on itself with diametric polarity
Yeah
So
The gun will blow up in your hand
and it won't even scorch my pinkie
Ha
That's just theoretical hypothesis
Inverse proportionate explosive dynamics has never been demonstrated conclusively in a laboratory environment
Oh yeah
Then pull the trigger, smart guy
Let's find out
Milo hesitates, unsure
Finally, he releases the gun
Ned raises it up on the end of his finger
Arch pulls it off with a loud
Ned cuffs Milo's hands behind him
spins him around
You have the right to remain silent
next
if you waive that right, anything you say
next
holding up a series of "cue cards"
as Ned reads from them
may be used against you in a court of law
next
You have the right to an attorney
Do you have an attorney
Nahhhh
Then today's your lucky day
He flips out a business card, handing it to Milo
- It reads
"Ned Ravine - Defense Attorney" '  - Large
Expensive
Impressive
The name on the mailbox reads "Ned and Lana Ravine

trail of clothes is scattered before us on the way to the bed

The bed shakes violently

Lana reaches for a pack of "Fatal 100's" on the bedside table
Not bad for an auto mechanic
(grins, cocky) Yeah, well you're not so bad yourself
for a lawyer's wife
Better watch your tongue, sweetie, or 'll have my husband arrest you
Busy man
Cop and a lawyer
When does he ever find time for you
She lights a cigarette
exhales a soft, gloomy cloud
He doesn't
That's why  need you to keep my engine tuned, Frank
Why drive a jalopy when you can have a hot rod
Maybe you should trade him in on a new model

The  of an automobile engine outside
Lana stops him
Pull over and park it, Frank
'm still under warranty
'  - Ned glances at the white van parked in the driveway, then takes note of his wife's silver Mercedes
sitting on floor jacks, the hood raised, tools spread out around it
-   - Ned enters
Lana wears a diaphanous dressing gown, buttoned unevenly, hair disheveled
She smokes a cigarette
Morning sweetheart
Ned kisses her on the back of the neck as he passes through the kitchen on his way to the dining room
She reacts with bored, contemptuous disinterest, picking up the coffee pot
Uh huh
Want some coffee
Ned steps back into the kitchen with his briefcase
No thanks
Ned sees Frank sitting at the kitchen table, hair messed up, coveralls hastily pulled on inside-out
Frank is reading a copy of   magazine
headline on the cover touts an article: "
Cover All Nine Lives For The Price of One
" Ned's smile fades
Frank here was just grabbing a little before going back to work on my car
He steps over to the table
gives Frank a cool stare
How long you been working on Lana's Mercedes, Frank
(shrugs) Oh
don't know
six, seven weeks
And ya still haven't found the problem
(a leering smile) Think  got my finger on it though
Ned turns to Lana
know what he's doing, Lana
wasn't born yesterday
He's not fixing your car
He's  you
Lana tenses up at this
Frank freezes
He figures they've been busted
He sits there, holding the magazine, not moving a muscle
as Ned turns on him
are screwing my wife
can see what your game is, Frank
You open up her hood, poke around in there
squirt some lubrication in
play around with all her parts
then take an old used piston and stick it in
then pull it out
in, out, in, out
Every day
There's no end to it
You just keep coming and and the bill just gets bigger and
Lana braces herself against the sink, breathless
turned on by Ned's description
Ned goes to her, sympathetic
But you don't see it, do you, Lana
You're too good
too pure
You can't see the evil in people like him
(turns to Frank) Well, you're not getting away with it, pal
'm pulling the plug
You're fired
(breathless) Ned
don't you have to be somewhere
(checks his watch) Oh
yeah
Thanks, honey
'm late for court
He goes to kiss her mouth and she turns her cheek to him
He looks at her lovingly
touches her face tenderly
You are so naive
He picks up his briefcase, gives Frank a nasty look, then exits thru the back door
Lana and Frank stare at each other lustfully, really hot now
Frank sweeps the dishes off the table with his arm
Lana leaps into his arms, wrapping her legs around his waist
He lays her down on the kitchen table, standing over her
Suddenly, Ned opens the back door, glaring right at Frank
not even noticing Lana on the table
Finish your coffee
then
He slams the door
beat
Lana and Frank begin to devour each other with passionate kisses
Another beat
The front doorbell  once
then again
Who's that
Just the postman
He always rings twice

'   - Richly appointed with stately oak, walls lined with law books
As in all "Noir" thrillers, venetian blinds cast dramatic slashes of light and ceiling fans turn lazily in every room
Ned hurries in, rummaging through the files on his desk
, a strikingly lovely brunette, enters from the outer office, files in hand
She is Ned's astute, dedicated, self- sacrificing "girl-friday" and legal secretary
She keeps his life from spinning crazily apart
She absolutely adores him
Laura
do you know where
(hands him file) Right here
The judge decided to skip arraignment and take Milo direct to trial
You're six minutes late, but don't sweat it
You got Judge Allen
He's always eleven minutes late
She picks up a lawbook, flips it open to a dog-eared page
suggest you try Lemming versus Florida, 1956
where the guy jumped in the water and everybody followed
(thinks about it) Yeah
Good idea
He smiles gratefully
drops the file into his briefcase
Ned heads for the office washroom
Laura darts ahead of him into the washroom and turns the water on
Ned steps in
splashes some water on his face
Laura grabs a towel from the rack where three small towels hang neatly
hands it to Ned
He dries his face, looking at her with genuine fondness and gratitude
don't know what 'd do without you
She glances toward the toilet, notices it hasn't been flushed
She  it, lowers the seat
Really
She sits down on the toilet seat, watching him adoringly as he shaves with an electric razor
Laura, how long have you worked for me
Two years, seven months, twenty-three days, nineteen hours
(checks her watch) six minutes and fifty-two seconds
(softly, to herself) fifty-three
fifty-four
fifty- five
fifty-six
And when was the last time  gave you a raise
Laura neatly folds the end of the toilet paper into a point
Never
But that's okay
don't need a raise
In fact
was thinking of giving you a rebate on my salary
He clicks off the razor, turns to look at her for a long moment, considering this, then
Naw
That's okay
You keep it
He gives her a manly pat on the shoulder then casually tosses the towel onto the rack, where it hangs sloppily askew
right next to her face
He exits
Laura stares at the towel with a tortured expression
The to her face as we see
-   - Scrawled on a steamed-up bathroom mirror -  - -
hand wipes the mirror off, revealing Laura
younger, longer hair, with a nasty black eye
'  appears behind her, glaring insanely
He looks toward the towel rack
There are three towels
with  -  -  embossed along the bottom edge
One towel hangs longer than the others
' Did we forget something
She meekly lines up all the towels
' Did we forget something
She meekly lines up all the towels
- Laura's Husband pulls the cupboard open
All the cans and boxes are neatly stacked in straight lines
All except one
She straightens it
trembling with fear
- He pulls her outside, nodding toward a line of tall trees behind the house
They are all straight and even
except one, whose tall branches tower conspicuously above the rest
He holds up a chainsaw, nodding toward the trees
Shaking and tearful
she backs into the house
out in terror
Ned rushes in, shaking her
Laura
Laura
What is it
(coming out of it) 'm okay, 'm okay
just get a bit
claustrophobic
in the bathroom
Maybe we should try some prune juice
He gives her shoulder a consoling squeeze, then exits
She shakily straightens the towels and regains her composure
Ned opens a wardrobe closet in his office
He walks along, looking at thirty exactly identical blue suits, hanging neatly
Laura follows behind him
He stops and stares, indecisive
Wear the blue one
- Ned turns dramatically to face the jury
Ladies and gentlemen
ask you
does this look like the face of a crook
- sitting next to Laura at the defense table
wearing the panty hose over his head
Of course it does
But the question of my client's guilt or innocence is not the issue here today
'm certain every member of the jury can clearly see that he's guilty
can't
- ' Ned ignores this, turning to look directly at the  as he addresses the jury
holding up a pair of nylon pantyhose
Put yourself in his shoes
Look through his eyes
See the world the way  sees it
He puts the pantyhose over the , obscuring our view
Things just don't look the same
It's fuzzy
and frightening
- The nylon pantyhose are draped over the frightened face of a All the other Jurors are holding up their own socks and nylon stockings, trying to peer through them
Ned steps over to Milo, motioning toward him
Ladies and gentlemen
Milo Crumley is not the perpetrator here
He is the
Milo unwraps a piece of bubble gum and pushes it into his panty-hose covered mouth, chewing the nylon and gum together
Like  of us
this man is the unfortunate victim of these tragically difficult economic times
And what does that mean
He can't support his family
Ned motions toward the gallery, where we
'  and  , all wearing panty hose over their faces
Ned motions toward Milo
For God's sake
He can't even support his own
notices that Milo is chewing gum
Mr
Crumley
you cannot chew gum in my courtroom
unless you have enough for everyone
Milo holds up a big plastic bag filled with bubble gum
Judge Allen grabs it, takes a piece of gum and hands it to the Bailiff
Bailiff
Pass these out
The Bailiff takes the bag, offers one to Ned
who takes a piece, unwraps it and starts chewing
The Bailiff then proceeds to pass out gum to  in the courtroom
The   raises his hand and clears his throat
And don't forget the jury
And so, desperate and broke, with no other options before him, Mr
Crumley went to eleven Savings & Loans and did what any of you would have done
He stole back the money that the &Ls had stolen from him
The courtroom erupts in
Judge Allen raps the gavel
(interrupting) Mr
Ravine
please approach the bench
He does
The Judge leans toward him, reaching out to cover the microphone, covering the end of the gavel instead
The Judge's voice is  over the courtroom speakers
You're not running for congress here, so knock off the speeches and quit inciting these brainless morons
Now pick up the pace and wrap this son- of-a-bitch up
Call your first witness
Ned turns
looking out over the courtroom
call
Detective Ned Ravine
There is a surprised  from the crowd
and a loud
The  holds out a video box
It's titled   - Ned puts one hand on it, raises the other
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God
do
Ned sits down
then gets up, his demeanor changing
Detective Ravine, at the time of the arrest, did you read the defendant his Miranda rights
He slips back into the witness box
Of course
That's standard procedure
Ned steps over to Arch, who is sitting in the first row of the gallery
Arch hands him the Miranda "cue cards
" Are these the cards Officer Brooks used to prompt you while reading Mr
Crumley his rights
He lays them on the corner of the stand
then slips into the chair
He picks the cards up and flips thru them
On the back we can see scribbled
"'  " Yeah
These are them
Ned jumps to his feet, pacing dramatically, grabbing the cards
Reading from the cards now
quote "You have the right to remain silent, if you waive that right, anything you say
may be used against you in a court of law
" Is that right
(back in the chair) That's right
(stands up, announces) The official Miranda warning is
"anything you say  be used against you in a court of law
" Not "may"
"
" (on the attack) Don't you know the difference between "can" and "may", Detective
Every school kid knows "can" is a verb that indicates ability to perform, while "may" is a verbal auxiliary indicating the permission to act
Ned pivots into the witness stand, changing his attitude from aggressive attorney to defensive, angry witness as he hits the chair
didn't have time to worry about past participles or interrogative pronouns
was trying to protect society from a deranged
(leaps up, pointing) But this ivy league fop
The courtroom
The Judge bangs the gavel
Ned strides proudly toward the defense table
have no more use for this witness
Mr
Ravine
Ned turns
The Judge motions with a finger for Ned to approach the bench
Ned does, resting his hand on it
'm dismissing this case on the grounds of improper grammar
The Judge smacks Ned's hand with a ruler
Ow
(jumps up) But your Honor
know,  know
It's a technicality
But it's the kind of technicality that makes the American legal system what it is today
Court's adjourned
The Judge mistakenly picks up the microphone and whacks it on the bench like a gavel
It is
Everyone covers their ears in pain
The  Sound System Logo appears at the bottom of the screen
along with "The Courtroom Is Listening" '   - Ned turns the key
enters through the private door
He the plaintive sound of a saxophone playing Lola's Theme
his eyes drawn to the slightly opened door to the outer office
- ' gorgeous pair of legs, sleek nylons, high-heeled shoes
There are several  ,   and other pieces of  stuck to the bottom of one shoe
pushes the door open
It's Lola
She wears a tight white dress, long white gloves and broad-brimmed hat
The hat tips up slowly, revealing her eyes
waited
You never came back
Ned reaches in his pocket, pulls out a wet paper towel
got busy
Here's that paper towel promised
Thanks
How'd you get in
The door was locked
Lola proudly holds up a tiny bobbie pin
She smiles
It's miraculous what a real woman can do
with a bobbie pin
Ned looks at the door
The frame and lock have been brutally chewed away, as if someone used a jackhammer on them
She pulls out a pack of cigarettes
(offering) Cigarette
No
thanks
They're bad for ya
He goes to the water cooler
She lights up, exhaling a soft cloud of smoke through a sleepy smile, her voice purring
Yes,  know
like things that are bad for me
(touching lawbooks) So
hear you go both ways
Ned hesitates
about to drink from the paper cup
Only once
It was a fraternity prank
never saw him again
He gulps the water down, crumbles the cup in his hand
No,  mean
you're a cop and a lawyer
Oh
Yeah
Well, there's a lot of scum out there on the streets
but they all deserve a fair and costly trial
Ned turns, tries to casually "dunk" the crumpled cup in the waste basket
He misses
Laura enters with a huge pile of lawbooks in her arms
She sees Ned miss the basket and darts over as he bends down to pick it up
'll get that
She picks it up and tosses it into the waste basket
Oh
Laura
this is, uh
Lola Cain
Laura sets the heavy load of books on the desk and steps toward Lola, extending her hand
Lola takes her time removing the long white glove
finally reaching out and shaking Laura's hand with a condescending air
(sarcastic) So lovely to meet you, Laura
Ned grabs the books and turns to the bookshelf, replacing each lawbook in its proper slot
The "handshake" between Lola and Laura turns tense, then aggressive, eventually becoming a "standing Indian wrestle" as they try to force each other off balance with sheer force
Ned is oblivious to the battle behind him, chattering away
Gotta keep these darn books in their right place or we'll never find the ones we need
Let's see,  thru
thru
thru
Laura suddenly whirls Lola around, putting her in an arm lock
But Lola elbows Laura in the stomach
Laura doubles over
Lola feigns sympathy, taking her hand
then spins, twisting Laura's arm, flipping her head over heels
Laura lands on the couch
upside down
gasping
Lola strikes a haughty pose, still holding her lit cigarette
She takes a drag
Laura checks her watch, then tumbles off the couch, landing on her feet
She straightens her skirt
It's getting late
'll give you a ride home, Ned
Finished with the books, Ned turns
smiles
have my car
'll tow you
Not today
You don't need to wait
'll see you tomorrow
Lola looks at Laura
icy, haughty, triumphant
Laura moves reluctantly toward the door, sees the lock and door frame chewed to pieces
whirls around, heads back toward Ned
should call someone to fix this
Tomorrow
She instantly spins around, heads back toward the door
'll call from home
and exits
Ned sits down on the corner of the desk
Lola sits in the chair across from him
think  should warn you, Mr
Ravine
'm not wearing any underwear
She crosses her legs suggestively
then slowly, enticingly, re-crosses them in the other direction
Unimpressed, Ned opens Laura's desk drawer
pulls a pair of sexy lace panties from a Kleenex-style dispenser box labeled "' - "
which pulls another pair up into position
He tosses the panties to Lola
Try these on
She does
very, very slowly and seductively
as they talk
So
what can  do for you
've run across some
papers
and  thought you might be able to tell me what they are
You see, 'm not very experienced when it comes to
papers
'll help you Miss Cain, if 'm able
Do you have the
papers
here
No
they're at home
thought you might stop by
'm on duty tonight
Don't they ever give you a night off
Yeah
Tomorrow
(picks up cigarette) Why don't we meet tomorrow evening then
She finishes pulling the panties on with a sultry smile
"snapping" the elastic waistband
She goes to the door, pauses
turns to him
'll let you know where
(steps over to her) What's wrong with my office
She looks around, exhaling another cloud of smoke
Nothing a good interior decorator couldn't fix
She opens the door
Behind her, in the hall, we see Dizzy, the saxophone player, wailing away on "Lola's Theme
" She takes a final, long drag on her cigarette, then reaches with it
toward Ned
Take care of this for me, will ya
With a sultry smile, she turns and leaves, closing the door
The cigarette is stuck in his nose
'  - The front door swings open
Frank is standing there, dressed in a cheap, loose-fitting suit and a -shirt
came back for my shower cap
Lana, now wearing the diaphanous gown, pulls him inside
She kisses him hungrily, slipping a frilly plastic shower cap with a gaudy floral design on his head
Yeah, well you came to the right place
She walks to the living room
Frank follows, still wearing the shower cap
Lana snaps her fingers
Sit down
He sits in a chair, looking around
Where is he
On duty all night
By the time he wraps up his reports, it'll be close to noon tomorrow
She sits on the couch, picks up a stack of papers
was just reading over
She looks up at Frank
Sees the shower cap
Take off the hat, Frank
He slips the shower cap off as Lana continues
was just reading over my husband's insurance policies
You wouldn't know anything about insurance, would you, Frankie
Yeah, matter of fact,  sell policies part-time
got half a brain
or didn't you notice
musta had my eye on something else
(hands him papers) How about a translation
He flips through, scanning the pages, shrugging
Standard accident policy
all the usual stuff
blah, blah, blah
The face value is
Wow
Not bad
Three million bucks
(flips page) And there's a triple indemnity rider
Meaning
Aw, it's just something agents throw in so we can boost the premium
If the policy holder dies under very specific conditions, it pays off three times the face value of the policy
Nine million dollars
Yeah
but it's a sure bet for the company
Nobody ever collects
Why not
Well, like here
it only pays off if he's shot with a pistol, falls from a moving northbound train and drowns in a fresh water stream
All three
See what  mean, sweetheart
What are the odds of that
It could happen
(dramatic beat) Suppose it did happen
Then you'd be rich
Then we'd be rich
What're you sayin'
She drops to her knees in front of him, her face close to his, speaking with a persuasive urgency
We're gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch
And  know exactly how
He has a legal symposium in Santa Barbara this weekend
All we have to do is get him to take the train up instead of driving
How we gonna do that
Didn't you tell me he hates trains
That's where you come in, baby
You're gonna rig his car so it doesn't work
That should be no problem for you
She gets up, walks to the adjoining room
snapping her fingers at her side
He follows
She steps to a table, pulls the cover off an elaborate scale- model of Dealey Plaza and a train station, complete with - Scale model trains chugging around the tracks
She uses a pointer to trace the route to the depot
Then
we give him a lift to the train station
through Dealey Plaza, past the Book Suppository and around the grassy knoll
Isn't that out of our way
Ignoring this, she turns the  , walks over to a screen and picks up a remote control
She clicks the button
comes on, throwing an  on Frank's back
We can read the words:
Move, Frank
He moves over

And pay attention
As she talks,  appear on the screen, accompanying her rapid spiel
We see: a shot of the depot, a map of the rail route, a gun, a river, a Bingo game, baseball action and a huge dollar sign
Ten minutes out of the station he'll be standing in the vestibule between cars
trying to avoid a panic attack
Fourteen minutes and ten seconds out, the train crosses the Santa Ynez River
So at thirteen minutes and fifty-four seconds, shoot him, shove him out the door
he hits the river and drowns
Bingo
triple play
We're rich
The lights click
You been thinking about this a lot, haven't you
No
It just came to me
(closer, seductive) had this image of a big, powerful, throbbing train
plunging into a long, dark, wet tunnel
They embrace, kissing passionately, dropping out of frame
The model train  faster, the train whistle  a long "Woooooooo-woooooooooo
"
racing into a model tunnel
-   - Ned and Arch drag in a bunch of bad-ass, multi-ethnic they've just busted
Ned angrily shoves one of the toughest gang members against the wall
losing his cool
Stand over there and shut up
#1 Hey, man, we got rights
Don't you be layin' no deleterious malfeasance on us
Ned goes ballistic and slams him into the wall again
Watch your mouth, punk
don't want to hear language like that
Arch grabs Ned by the shoulder, pulling him back, calming him
Whoa, hold on, hoss
Take it easy
You seem a little tense tonight
What is it
Ned regains his composure
He's depressed
Aw
don't know
guess it's Lana
It's just
know she wants to have a baby so bad
Gang Member #1 steps closer, listening
but  never get to spend any time with her
And when  am home
it's like she's, you know
avoiding sex
Gang Member #1 steps closer, listening
#1 You should try to be more sensitive, man
More romantic
Bring her flowers
He steps between them, putting his arm around Ned's shoulder
#1 Try to understand how she feels
After all
He steps back, begins to  "Try  Little Tenderness"
#1 She may be weary
Women do get weary
Wearing that same old shabby dress
But when she's weary
Try a little ten-der-ness
The other Gang Members join in on the   with a sweet, mellow street-corner harmony as back-up
and some smooth group choreography
The  on duty listen raptly, getting maudlin and dewey- eyed
Tears roll down the cheeks of the
The lights dim

Arch watches all this with a sentimental smile, munching on his Nachos
When the song ends, Arch puts a comforting hand, covered with Nacho cheese, on Ned's shoulder
That can't be it
'm the tenderest guy on the force
Nah
think she's just afraid she won't be able to get pregnant
What's to be afraid
It's like making breakfast
You bring home the bacon
she's got the eggs
Ya scramble it up
Ba-da-boom ba-da-bing
She's got an omelette in the oven
(a beat, then) Why don't you knock off early
go home
It'd be nice for Lana to wake up in the morning and find you there for a change
Naw
can't
got all this paperwork
Don't worry about that
#1 We'll do our own paperwork, man
Yeah
We'll fill out all that shit
Ned nods, smiles and gratefully "high-fives" the Gang Members as he heads for the door

Ned quietly undresses and slips into bed

Lana's eyes flutter open

Suddenly, it hits her

She covers his mouth

He slips out of bed

Lana dives for it, slamming her hand down, killing the alarm
Going for a double-play, she flings the clock at the , nailing the on/off switch

Frank moves toward the door

He blows Lana a kiss, then pulls the door closed very gently

The knob pops off in his hand and he falls backward, tumbling down the stairs with a Ned doesn't stir
Finally it's

Ned's shoe hits him right in the face

Ned enters, looking terrible
Suit ripped, hair messed up, bruised and battered, briefcase crushed
My God, Ned

Max Shady's mother
Not again
, an older woman with a pleasant appearance, sits in an overstuffed leather chair
Ned and Laura enter
Hello, Mrs
Shady
Ned goes straight to his office closet, pulls out an identical blue suit
and starts stripping off his tattered clothes
Laura
check on my insurance
Make sure it's paid up
Laura reluctantly returns to the outer office
Good idea, Mr
Ravine
My son, Max, is getting out of prison tomorrow
(checks his watch) Gee, has it been seven years already
Seven long, miserable years in the slammer
And he's a bit pissed off
Well, being locked in a tiny room with no  can make a guy feel pretty tense
'm very concerned about him, Mr
Ravine
He said you were a two-bit shyster
and he's going to rip your head off and use it for a bowling ball
He goes to her, putting a comforting hand on her shoulder, looking her right in the eye, attempting to provide solace
'm sure the experience wasn't all negative
He probably made a lot of friends
(ever hopeful) You think
learned a useful trade
Oh yes
live autopsies
caught up on all those books he wanted to read
She struggles to her feet feebly
Maybe so
but he said he's going to punch you in the testicles
She hauls off and  him like a pile driver
He doubles over, gasping
smash your face
She  him in the face, raising him up
then nails him with a devastating  , spinning him around
He collapses over the desk
and decimate your wardrobe
She grabs the tail of his suit jacket and rips it up the back
And  wouldn't want that to happen
(spanks his butt) He's a naughty naughty boy
just thought  should warn you
She turns and shuffles out, passing through the outer office
(to Laura) Bye for now
(pauses by desk) Oh
may  have a cookie
(at file cabinet) Sure
She grabs a handful of cookies and casually flings them at Laura
as she heads out the door
Thank yooooooooou
Laura rushes into Ned's office with the file folder
He staggers unsteadily by the desk
Oh my God, Ned
hate when she comes to see me
Don't you realize, Ned
you could be in real danger
(sees file) What's that
Extreme peril
You know, the risk of personal bodily harm
(points at file) No
mean that
Your insurance file
But the policy's missing
Did you take it home
don't think so
Laura looks puzzled
wondering where it might be
Then
Oh, wait a second
She goes to her desk in the outer office, digs through a drawer
Suddenly, she

Laura's Husband reacts with a crazed look in his eyes
Laura makes a break for it, running up on deck

looking off with demonic rage
from Laura's  mouth
Her eyes are filled with pure terror
wave of  splashes in her face
We see Ned
holding a tiny empty paper cup in his hand
Laura is completely drenched
Laura
Are you alright
That was a very long flashback you had
She snaps out of it, sputtering
Yes
know
It's okay
'm just a little
pre-menstrual
She goes to her desk, still upset
She picks up the message spike and turns to Ned
That Lola Cain
"person"
stopped by
She left this
She thrusts it toward Ned's face
There's a business card stuck on the end
He pulls it off
- It reads:
No Air Conditioning
And Proud Of It
Scribbled next to it is the message
"Meet me at 7:30"
The edges of the card are scorched
- It's dark, seductive, smoky, crowded
and
Everybody is dripping with sweat and holding unlit cigarettes
Ned enters, sees Lola sitting on a stool at the bar, one leg crossed provocatively over the other
beer can is stuck to the gum on the bottom of her shoe
It falls off with a
He sits on the stool next to her
She looks at him, smiles
Oh yeah, before  forget
you asked me to take care of this
He reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out a
It has a very long ash
Thanks
She takes it
inhales a drag, then lets the smoke flow out through her smile
It flows out for a loooooooooong time
More smoke than she could ever have inhaled
Then
You smoke too much
(looks around, then) It's hot tonight
Is it
never know
My body heat runs about twenty degrees above normal
He notices the drink in her hand is

Ned looks over to see a , featuring Dizzy on sax

None of the band members miss a beat
Maybe we should look for a cooler place
doubt we'll find one
Even the wind chimes on my porch aren't moving much these days
They keep thudding softly, like dairy cows bumping butts in the night
go out there expecting to find a cool breeze
but it's just a lot of hot air
Ned glances at the
sitting at the bar across from them
They're staring coldly at Ned
What're they lookin' at
lot of them have tried that seat
You're the first one's lasted this long

Don't
It's broken

Ned pulls himself back up and drags another stool over
Did you bring the

No
thought you might come over
Sure
'll drive you

'll follow you then
know it sounds silly, but would you leave first
wait in your car
come here a lot and  wouldn't want those men to think 'm "easy"
a slut who'll jump into bed with anyone at the drop of a hat
But if you leave first
they'll think 'm a putz for passing up a sure thing
Lola stares at Ned for a long moment
then  his face
He doesn't move, remaining staunchly macho
Then, suddenly, she   so hard it knocks him over the top of the bar
(for all to hear) Now leave me alone
She pauses to give him a flicker of a
then picks up her drink and moves to a nearby table
Ned struggles to his feet and staggers to the door
'  - Ned is a mess
Blood trickles from the side of his mouth
Shirt soaked in sweat
He turns the radio
' starts playing
small ceiling fan hangs from the interior roof of his car, turning slowly
The venetian blinds on his side windows are partially open, letting in slashes of dramatic light
- He's following Lola's car
It signals and turns left
'  - Still hot, Ned pulls the chain on the ceiling fan
It spins faster
faster
The car becomes like a wind tunnel
'  - The two cars enter a long drive, coming to a stop near a large two story house surrounded by lush greenery
Ned climbs out
his wind-blown hair flattened on one side and sticking out crazily
- '   - ' It opens
Lola's legs swing out
The    her long legs to her feet
The car floormat is stuck to one shoe
She casually shakes it off

Well, here we are
in the dark

You what
Lola  her hands twice and all the
She smiles at him
drops her car keys on the hall table, then goes up the stairs
Ned drops his car keys on the table too and follows her
- Lola clicks on a porch light
She and Ned step out
Dozens of small boxes hang around the perimeter of the porch
My wind chimes
Ned steps over, running his hands along the boxes
They "thud" against each other
You know, these would work a lot better if you took them out of the boxes
He slips several boxes off, releasing clusters of the metal chimes
They "tinkle" and "clang" melodically in the breeze
Well well
guess you have been around
'm impressed
She moves close, coming on to him
Ned feels uneasy
Why don't we take a look at those
papers
(remembering) Papers
Right
- Lola comes in, looks around, then down
She removes her shoe, pulling off two scraps of paper stuck to the gum on her heel
- Ned is looking through a book
"   - The Encyclopedia of Deadly Sexual Positions
" Lola comes back in, hands Ned the two scraps of paper
That's it
These are the
papers
Yes
They're so confusing to me
Can you tell me what they are
He checks them out
shrugs
It's obvious
This one's a laundry receipt
and the other one's an expired lottery ticket
He hands them back to her, but she gently pushes them away
No
You keep them
as a memento of our time together
She slips them into his jacket pocket
then sensuously slides her hands around him, grabbing his buns, pulling him closer
'm so grateful
How can  ever repay you for all you've done
Cash would be nice
Isn't there some other way
suppose you could wash my car
No,  mean, isn't there something else you want
Something  could give you
She seductively starts to slide the jacket off his shoulders
Hey
slow down
there's a speed limit in this state
Sixty-five miles an hour
How fast was  going, officer
Oh, about a hundred and twenty-three
Suppose you pull me over and frisk me
Suppose  let you off with a warning
Suppose  find a cop with a bigger nightstick
Suppose  put you under arrest for being a bad girl with bad thoughts
Suppose you handcuff me to the bed
(rapid run-on) Suppose  do and then we lose the key and while 'm gone to get a duplicate made the house catches on fire and  can't get back to save you because the bridge is washed out and so you die a horrible death toasted like a Polish sausage on a flaming spit
(shakes his head) Nah
better be going
He turns and leaves
She is stunned, confused, breathless
- Ned opens the door, pauses, turns
as Lola joins him there
She looks into his eyes with desire
You're not so tough
Last chance
She moves her lips close to his, about to kiss him
Then
No thanks
got a cold shower and a wife who trusts me waiting at home
What's the matter
Don't you want me
It's the way  look, isn't it
He steps out, pauses
turns to her
Don't forget to lock up
Ned pulls the door shut
The lock
He pauses by his car, realizing something, heaves a sigh, goes back to the door
He tries the knob, but the door is locked
He looks through the small window
He sees Lola standing inside
breathing heavily, bracing herself against the staircase bannister, hand to her heaving chest as if to calm a pounding heart
He pushes against the door
It won't budge
He goes to the large window, gazing inside
She slides one hand enticingly across her breast and thigh, striking a seductive pose
He points toward the door, motioning for her to unlock it
She looks away
Frustrated, Ned tries the window
It's locked
He picks up a wrought iron chair,  it into the window
The heavy chair falls apart
The glass doesn't even vibrate
He sees a riding power mower in the driveway
jumps into the seat, starts the engine
barreling toward the front of the house
and   in the sky
He  into the side of the house,  a huge hole thru the wall
a swath in the carpet
Lola
Ned climbs off the mower, moving toward her
She opens her arms, breathless
The   dramatically
She intercepts him, embracing him passionately
knew you'd come back
(looking past her) forgot my car keys
He struggles free, grabbing his car keys from the hall table
She follows, embracing him again, even more tenaciously
That's not what you came back for
Yes it is
Impatient, she crushes her mouth against his, kissing him hard, desperately clawing at his clothes
She's relentless
devouring him with her lips and tongue
Overwhelmed, he succumbs to her passion
His car keys drop from his hand
She pushes him down toward the floor
- Her hands grasp his shirt, ripping it open
The buttons fly in all directions
She grabs at his leather belt, twisting it in her hands
ripping it in two
She grabs his pants by the cuffs
rips one pant leg off

She lays on the table, arms and legs stretched upward

Ned and Lola, both in yellow rain slickers, ravish each other lustfully on the roof, sliding down the incline of shingles
Oblivious to the peril, they slip right over the edge
They hang from the eaves trough, each clutching it with one hand while still holding one another with their free arms
kissing passionately
The trough breaks

Then
ignites the cigarette lighter in the handle, touching the flame to the end of her cigarette
She chips away a big chunk of ice from the block in a silver ice bucket beside her
then sensuously rubs the ice across her breasts
Ned winces at the sight of this
Lola smiles at him, then lets the chunk of ice slide into the water

He cringes, eyes crossed
The familiar repetition of  notes from the stereo
grabbing Ned's attention
That's Madam Butterfly, isn't it
Iron Butterfly
In--Gadda-Da-Vida

now  can hear it
It tells the sad story of a woman who is rejected by her lover after a brief, but torrid, affair
so she stalks him with an ice pick and stabs him with it more than a thousand times
Really
never could understand the lyrics
He lifts his feet out of the water, dangles them over each side of the tub
He's still wearing one blue sock
Lola raises her feet out of the water
She's still wearing her high heel shoes
They are dripping
You know, what happened last night was very, uh
Yes
it was

But we can't ever let it happen again
Ever
What are you saying, Ned
That you're rejecting me, your lover, after a brief, but torrid, affair
Ned pulls his feet in, sits up
suddenly feeling vulnerable
He measures his words very, very carefully
wouldn't put it exactly like that
It's just that
well, 'm married to a wonderful woman
who is very, very attractive

- (whispering harshly) told you not to call me
It's finished between us
No
No, 'm not sucking anything of yours anymore
(voice gets louder) It's done
He  the receiver down, shattering the phone
Everyone stares at Ned in stunned silence
(shrugs it off) Wrong number
'  - She's in the bathtub, phone receiver in one hand, still jabbing at the porcelain tub with the ice pick
Water squirts from the holes she's punctured in the side of the tub
She flings the ice pick at the wall
It sticks
- Lana is seated on a park bench wearing a trenchcoat, hat and sunglasses
Frank walks up, looks around nervously, pretending not to know Lana
He sits down next to her
How come we gotta meet here
We have to be careful now
We can't risk being seen together at the house or someone might connect us to the murder later on
She hands him a hat
Here
put this on
She takes her sunglasses off, looks at him
He hesitates, staring at the hat
dignified looking approaches
Frank quickly slips the hat on his head
The Older Gentleman sits on the bench across from them
He opens a paper sack and begins neatly laying his lunch out next to him
An apple, sandwich, napkin, Mountain Dew
(whispers to Frank) Speak Yiddish
What
Red Yiddish
We see the - "Speak Yiddish

Whenever they speak, however, his eyes look down toward their legs

Statistics reveal that less than thirty-two percent of all murderers are ever apprehended
They both look at him
stunned

You speak Yiddish
No
But  can read sub-titles
Frank and Lana are speechless
But across the bottom of the screen we see a - reflecting their thoughts

'   - Ned enters, carrying the box
He sets it down on her desk
Oh gee, you shouldn't have
didn't
It's for my wife
He goes into his office, starts to change out of his tattered suit
Laura talks to him from the outer office
She called
Wondered why you never came home last night
told her you were working with a client, undercover
She steps into the doorway of his office
Were you
What
There's lipstick on your collar
She returns to her desk
Disturbed, Ned quickly pulls the shirt collar out, checks it
No there isn't
No
there isn't
But you answered my question
She's a real looker, huh
Who
Lola Cain
hadn't noticed
She opens the blinds behind her and looks at Ned through the window between their offices
Yeah,  noticed how you hadn't noticed
(returns to work) That's alright
She noticed enough for both of us
She picks up a stack of papers from the  machine
Ned steps into the doorway, wearing a clean shirt
worry about you, Ned
worry a lot
(hands him papers) Max Shady's been faxing death threats to you all morning
(reading bits) stick a knife in your
(reacts, next) rip the eyeballs out of your
(next) drive razor-sharp spikes under your
Did you get to the one
cut it off
shove it in a blender
Yeah
that one
(tosses them aside) He's just getting it out of his system
Once they say it
they never do it
You know
like the President
There's a  at the door
They look up to see an ominous of a  on the milkglass
Ned starts toward the door
Laura grabs his arm, stopping him
(whispers) Wait
It might be him
She opens her purse, pulls out a big
45, holding it out to him
Ned stares at it, taken aback
Where did you get that
(as if obvious) From my purse
What are you doing with it
(still obvious) Handing it to you
Jeez, Laura, what do you use a gun for
You shoot it
bullet comes out
Gosh, Ned, after all your years as a cop, 'd think you'd know these things
Laura
put the gun away
He hands the gun back to her
goes to the door
opens it
There's a young   holding a bouquet of flowers
(checks card) Flowers for Ned Rav
(looks up) Hey
aren't you that lawyer guy
Man, you are dead meat
Ned grabs the flowers, slams the door
Laura takes the envelope from the flowers
opens it
Is this another sick joke from Max Shady
She looks at the card
her expression turning cold
What is it
(hands it to him) Lola Cain
She grabs the flowers
takes them into the bathroom
'll put these in water for you
Ned opens the envelope
An audio cassette drops into his hand
Written on the label:
From the bathroom, we hear the   of a '  - It's raining
Ned pops the cassette into the tape player
' Ned, darling
know this seems like a strange way to talk with you
but since you won't take my calls, have no other choice
(then suddenly) Watch it
That red car's turning left
Ned swerves to avoid a collision,  his horn
' love you, Ned
We're meant to be together
forever
(then suddenly) The light's changing
Floor it
Go
Go
Go
Ned guns it
accelerating through a yellow light
' Nice move
(then sincere again) Nothing can keep us apart, Ned
Not even your wife
'd hate to have to tell her about us, but if necessary
will
We see  behind Ned's car
'  - She is following him, her eyes intense, obsessed
Dizzy sits in the back seat, noodling softly on his saxophone
'  - Ned steps into the living room carrying the box
Lana comes down the stairs, pulling on a bathrobe
What happened to you last night
(guilty as charged) Why
What have you heard
(sarcastic) You could have called
But then, suppose you were tied up
(reflecting back) Only part of the time
never know when you're coming home, Ned
How can  ever make any plans
In the b

, through the window,   Frank drop from the second floor, right onto the seat of a waiting motorcycle
He   into the night
Ned steps up behind Lana, slips his arms around her
promise 'll spend more time with you
know it's been rough, being alone so much
But 'll make it up to you
Maybe we should try again, you know
to have a baby
She rolls her eyes at this
changes the subject
So what's in the box
Oh
brought you a present
He hands it to her
She opens it, looks in
She looks up, struggling unsuccessfully to hide a look of displeasure
What is it
It's
sorta like a cat
Ned pulls out a   and puts it in Lana's lap
She forces a weak smile
Not enough like a cat
It's a little skunk
got it at Birds-and-Skunks--Us
- Lola stands in the pouring rain outside, drenched
staring at Lana and Ned through the window
- So
what're you going to name him
How about
Ned
(thinks about it) Yeah
Got a nice ring to it
've always liked the name Ned
No kidding
He puts his arms around them both
So whatdya think
You love Ned Junior as much as you love me
At least
The phone
Lana stands up, unceremoniously dropping the Skunk into Ned's arms
She goes into
to answer the phone
Hello
Hello
Hello
(then, whispering) Frank
Is that you
- Lola is in a glass telephone booth with venetian blinds and a ceiling fan
She cracks the blinds open
In the background, through a window, we can see Lana in the house on the phone
(filtered) told you not to call
Frank
- Ned enters the cavernous marble rotunda, turns down a hallway crowded with milling attorneys and defendants
Lola suddenly intercepts him
a newspaper trailing from her high heel shoe
Who's Frank
Frank
The only Frank  know is an auto mechanic
but  sure as hell wouldn't recommend the guy
He's really slow
He starts to move off, but she stops him, impassioned
had to see you, Ned
need to feel your arms around me
wanna suck your toes til the nails pop off
Lola's voice
gather, listening
Ned looks around self-consciously, embarrassed

It doesn't matter

Mortified, Ned spins on his heels and makes a bee-line for the safety of the Men's Room
Lola holds up two tickets
got us tickets to see Iron Butterfly
hate opera
'  - Ned bursts in, goes to the urinal
not noticing  , an older gentleman in a business suit, standing at the urinal next to him
beat later
Lola enters
Why are you running from me
Didn't it mean  to you
buffing my buns with carnuba wax
(looks down) Come on, Neddy-poo
Doesn't Mr
Pokey want to go exploring
He's busy right now
Arugula glances sideways at Ned, curious and uneasy
Look,  told you
Mr
Pokey made a big mistake
One lousy mistake in his whole stinkin' life
So why don't you give him a
Besides
he belongs to my wife
- Lana  her gun rapidly
over her shoulder, behind her back, under her leg
full-body cut-out of a man, wearing one of Ned's trademark gray suits
has been blown right through the crotch
Lana smirks, inhales the  from the gun barrel
and blows it out
- from an official government seal that reads " "  Ben Arugula

Oh no no
It's no big thing

And  want to get you a nice present
You're so sweet
You don't have to
You gave me a present last year
Those lovely Ginzu knives
Yeah

They last forever
And you can cut right through a shoe with 'em
As they walk off, we   a   of a newspaper
The headline reads: -  /
Below it is a picture of Max Shady, eyes wide with psychotic rage
a huge cigar in his mouth, wearing a garish Hawaiian shirt
Hands lower the newspaper
revealing Max himself, with the same cigar, shirt and crazed look on his face
-  - Laura models hats
each one becoming more outrageous
She coaxes Ned into joining her
They  try on 's hats
smiling and laughing
as "Brown Eyed Girl" plays
In one of the mirrors, we  Max Shady's reflection
as he also tries on women's hats, watching them, puffing his cigar
- Laura wears a baseball cap with beer cans attached to each side with long, curved plastic straws
The cap emblem reads "

She is beaming

It's nice to be off the streets
away from all the pain and misery out there
Ned motions casually toward the world "out there"
sticking his thumb into the eye of a  who is bending over to pick up a spoon, setting off a chaotic   of small disasters that finally culminates with someone near the dance floor bumping into the Torch Juggler, throwing his rhythm off
Distracted, he starts catching the   of the torches
He drops them all
The Waiter who bumped into him, politely picks up one of the flaming torches and hands it back to the Torch Juggler
He grabs the flaming end of the torch
and lets out a
He lunges toward a voluptuous    , grabbing the frozen breasts
His burned hands
Ned and Laura don't even notice
gazing only at each other
(
) What's he thinking when he looks at me with that goofy smile
(
) Boy, does she look stupid in that hat
(
) If  told him how  really feel, he'd probably fire me
What am saying
He probably doesn't even know  exist
(
) Laura's incredible
And so smart
Smart enough to recognize that Ginzu knives are the gift of a lifetime
(then, concerned) But she never goes out with guys wonder why

But he's married

Than again
maybe Lana will get hit by a runaway truck

'm driving up in the morning
- sits at a corner table wearing a chic beret from the hat store, voraciously devouring a huge Hawaiian Pit Roasted Pig
He wrenches the apple from the Pig's mouth
takes a huge bite
saxophone begins to wail "Lola's Theme
" Ned looks up, his eyes drawn to the lounge
He sees
Lola
striking a sexy pose on a bar stool, eyes locked on Ned
Dizzy walks thru, behind the bar, playing his sax
She grabs a handful of cherries from a glass on the bar, shoves them in her mouth, cheeks bulging, tongue moving furiously
moment later, she pulls out a long chain of inter-locked cherry stems
Ned reacts, shaken, glancing nervously at Laura
She smiles, unaware
His eyes flash back to Lola
(
) He's so cute
He can't even look me in the eye
Ned's reacts intensely to
- ' She stretches out sensuously on the bar, executing a series of humanly impossible erotic gymnastic positions
Then, wrapping her legs around a brass pole, she spins no-handed
until her thighs begin to
- The eyes of every  in the restaurant are riveted on Lola
The table starts to rise slowly on Ned's side, glasses sliding toward Laura
She reaches out to stop them
noticing Ned's distracted expression
(touching his arm) What is it, Ned
You can tell me
(sighs, reluctant) 'm a man, Laura
And all men feel passion at one time or another
Even me
(hopeful) Really
What would you think of a married man who gave in to those wild, sensual, raging desires
Oh
wow
golly
She gulps, eyes wide
The  pound faster as the Dancers in the b
g
pick up the frenetic tempo
What if, for just one crazy moment, he couldn't resist
He got knocked for a loop and lost control
(smiles, eager) Gosh
that might be okay
Breathless, she breaks a sweat, gasping for air
The beat ,
The b
g
Dancers whip into a frenzy
What if a tidal wave of lust crashed over him and he was sucked into a vortex of wild, thrashing urges
Both of Laura's ballcap beer cans
Beer  out in a huge gush, drenching her
Ned is so preoccupied with his own dilemma, he doesn't even notice
He heaves a sigh
pats her hand
smiles philosophically
Well
it's not your problem
'll work it out
- grasped tightly in Lola's hand
She walks toward Ned and Laura, a seething rage in her eyes
As she passes the ice sculpture, she stabs the ice pick into the crystalline Hula Dancer's neck
The head breaks off
She catches it and keeps coming, tossing the head casually in one hand, like a basketball
Lola appears suddenly at Ned and Laura's table
They look up
(to Laura) Like some ice for your drink
She drops the ice Mermaid head
It shatters Laura's glass to bits
Lola turns to Ned with a cold glare
Does your wife know you're
"working" late
certainly hope so, Mr
Ravine
She lights her cigarette with the ice pick lighter, then flips it like a jackknife
It  into Ned's chair, right between his legs
Lola flashes a coldly arrogant smile at Laura
then exits
'  -  - Frank opens the hood to Ned's car, holding a screwdriver in one hand
a wrench in the other
He doesn't know where to start
-  '  - tosses a folded newspaper
It lands at Max Shady's feet
Max picks up the paper, opens it
The headline says: Max looks around self-consciously, eyes shifting uneasily
'  - Lana stands by the front door
She calls upstairs to Ned
Hurry up, darling
You'll be late
Frank slips in, wearing his greasy overalls
He wipes his hands on a rag
giving Lana a sly wink
(whispering) It's all taken care of
When do knock on the door
Wait until  signal you
When  raise the blinds
you knock
She steps over to the blinds and demonstrates
He knocks
Not now
Oh, later
right
okay
She nods, patronizing
Frank exits
Lana picks up the Skunk, cuddling him
Ned comes down wearing his trademark gray suit
Lana kisses him passionately
a final farewell
Drive carefully, sweetheart
Say bye- bye to Little Ned
He loves his daddy
don't you Stink Pot
(pets the skunk) See you tonight, Junior
As soon as Ned closes the door, Lana's smile vanishes and she casually tosses the Skunk aside with a
'  -  - Ned turns the car key
Nothing
He gets out, opens the hood
He stares
dumbfounded
- Ned comes in, visibly upset
Lana acts surprised
What's wrong
This neighborhood is getting worse all the time
Damn kids stole my engine
Why don't you catch the train to Santa Barbara
It leaves in twenty minutes
'll just fly up
No
Ned looks at her strangely
She catches herself
mean
you can't
Armed terrorists seized the airport this morning plane crashed into the tower
and all the runways are on fire
Yeah
So
And it's fogged in
(disappointed) Dammit
For my peace of mind
take the train
Lana goes to the window, starts to raise the blinds
can't do it
You know how  feel about riding trains
She stops
letting the blinds drop down
Darling
it's only a short trip
(reconsiders) Yeah
right
short trip
She starts to raise the blinds again
He picks up the phone
(he hesitates) short trip to hell in a metal tomb
He slams the receiver down
Lana drops the blinds again
Just because both your parents died in a train wreck
And my brother, Jeff
And your brother, Morty
My two sisters
Right
My best friend, Al
my dog, Woof
Grandma Rose
and Uncle Lionel
All killed by trains
(very convincing) Coincidence, Ned
Beside
that's the past
They're gone
(sighs, resigned) Yeah
guess  can't bring them back by not riding on a train
That's right
She starts to raise the blinds again
But  just can't get over this stupid nagging fear that
She abandons the blinds, leaving them raised part way
Fear
What about our baby, Ned don't want to raise a child in a home filled with fear
There's a  at the door
Lana tugs on the cord and the blinds drop with a
The  stops
She pretends it didn't even happen, racing on
But if you can conquer your fear
maybe  can conquer my fear of having a baby with a father who's fearful
(goes for broke) Ned
don't let a train kill our child before it's even conceived
(heaves a sigh) guess you're right
She grabs the cord, then hesitates
You're sure now
beat
He nods
She quickly pulls the blinds up
But we'll never make it to the station
By the time a cab gets here
at the front door
Lana opens it
It's Frank
was in the neighborhood
Thought 'd stop by and pick up my tools
Frank will drive you
Won't you Frank
Sure, 'll take you to the train station
They all freeze
Lana glares at Frank, who is completely unaware of his faux pas
while Ned tries to figure out why that response didn't sound right
'  - They climb into the van
Ned nervously checks his watch
Twelve minutes
We'll never make it
'  - The     to reveal Max Shady under the van, hanging on like a leech, his back only inches from the road
The van drives off
'  - At an intersection
they see a "" sign
Frank and Lana exchange concerned looks
Frank turns the corner
The van starts vibrating violently, tossing them around
(checks his watch) We're not going to make it
We'll make it
He shifts gears, guns the engine
They rocket ahead, , their heads  the car roof
The van through deep water, a huge fantail spraying out on both sides
- The train is pulling in
The   to Frank's muddy van as it drives up nearby
Frank waits in the van as Ned and Lana get out and walk toward the train
They pass a feeble   struggling to drag a along the platform
inches at a time
passes her also, carrying a small overnight case for an attractive, elegantly attired
Everyone ignores the Old Woman
Ned looks nervously at the train, already pale
Okay
now what're you going to do if you feel queasy going through the tunnel
'll stand in the vestibule between the cars
That's right
When you get queasy
go stand in the vestibule between the cars
She kisses his cheek
He reluctantly boards the train
Her smile vanishes
She hurries back to the next car, nods at Frank, boards the train
Frank peels off his coveralls, follows her on
- Laura's Husband steps from the train, holding the deflated Ninja Turtle float ring
He looks around, then walks toward the cab stand
The   with him, then
- The headline says:
Under the headline is a picture of Max Shady
muddy, bloody, greasy, clothes ripped, cigar shredded
looking off
The paper lowers, revealing Max
a battered mess, looking off
He picks up a small violin case and quickly moves toward the train as it starts to pull out
We now  that the seat of Max's pants has been ripped out, his naked buttocks scratched and scraped raw by the road
- Ned stares out the window
apprehensive, nervous
Frank and Lana enter at the opposite end of the coach
They spot Ned, quickly ducking into a seat where they can observe him yet remain hidden from view behind the tall seatbacks
- Max walks through the car looking for Ned
He pauses, puffing on his big cigar
looks up and is shocked to see Max's scraped bare butt hanging out only inches away
My dear gracious
Max swivels around to look at her
turning his bare behind toward an   across the aisle
Would you  extinguish that foul smelling cigar
(turning slowly) You want me to put out my want me to put out my cigar
You want  to put out my
Yeah
Certainly
- Max enters through the vestibule, without his cigar, stopping in his tracks when he sees Ned
He smiles to himself, then ducks back into the lavatory
- Max looks at himself in the mirror
He's a disaster
He opens the violin case, pulling out his trademark "Ned Ravine" gray suit on a hangar
It's not even wrinkled
- Ned looks pale
sweating
reacting tensely to every lurch and bump the train makes
The feeble Old Woman strains to pull her huge steamer trunk down the aisle, inch by inch, toward Ned
Lana peers over the seat, watching Ned with a cruel smile
It's already getting to him
He'll be out of that seat and into the vestibule within ten minutes guarantee it
- Max is cleaned up, dressed in the suit
He straightens his tie, slicks his greasy hair back, sticks a big cigar in his mouth and grins at himself in the mirror
You talkin' to me
You talkin' to You
talkin'
to
He reaches into the violin case, pulls out a complex assortment of metal parts, assembling them swiftly
It's an incredibly nasty looking high-tech, automatic weapon with gigantic cartridge clip
He screws on a long silencer and points the gun at the ceiling
a muffled gunshot
Debris fall around him
He looks up
He has blown a  through the roof of the coach
He adjusts the Silencer Volume Control, which has a scale from 1 thru 11
He turns it all the way down to "0" He pulls the trigger
The gun , but there is absolutely
He has blown another  in the ceiling
- Ned looks across the aisle to see a   pulling all kinds of strange food items from a paper bag, making a big, sloppy, disgusting  that squirts and drips all over
Ned turns away
really queasy now
- Max reaches into the case, pulls out
He plugs it into the outlet and  it a couple times, grinning wickedly
- Max steps out of the lavatory and sees the  coming his way collecting tickets
He quickly spins around, slides the door open and steps into the vestibule between cars
The Conductor can't get past the Old Woman, so he climbs over the top of her trunk, with no thought of helping her
- Max looks out the side window, trying to conceal the weapon in front of him
The Conductor enters, sees him
Ticket
Without turning, Max holds the ticket up over his shoulder
The Conductor takes it, punches it, notices the gun barrel
Sorry pal
automatic weapons are only allowed in the club car after nine p
m
Max turns, raising the gun with a nasty
The Conductor casually snaps a baggage tag to the barrel, taking the gun
'll check it with baggage
You can claim it at the depot in Santa Barbara
The Conductor drops the weapon into a big mesh bag
along with a dozen other guns he's collected
He exits
Max whirls around facing the window, eyes filled with rage
Now what
- gun barrel slowly protrudes between the seats in front of Frank and Lana
Their eyes widen
Suddenly, a stream of water hits Frank in the face
He sputters
named scrambles into the aisle
Hi
'm Jeff and 'm eight years old
Didja know if ya put a penny on the track it'll make the train crash
No kiddin'
You ever been in a wreck
My uncle has
Lotsa times
It's really neat
Everybody gets creamed
All bloody guts
heads ripped off and stuff
Hey
wanna hear my song "Great Green Gobs of Greasy Grimy Gopher Guts"
Lana turns to Frank
inspired
She leans toward Jeff
You want to earn a couple bucks, kid
Jeff bounces into the seat across from Ned
Hi
'm Jeff and 'm eight years old
Didja know if ya put a penny on the track it'll make the train crash
Lana peers over the seat at Ned
She smiles
He's losing it
You better get up to the next car
Remember, give me the high sign as soon as you see the river
It'll be two minutes and nine seconds past the tunnel
'll take care of the rest
Anything goes wrong
just make sure you back me up
(grabs his collar) And don't let him see you
Frank gets up, moves down the aisle slowly, eyes on Ned
He can't squeeze past the Old Woman, who is still struggling to pull her huge trunk down aisle
So
he climbs right over the top of it
oblivious to her
Frank stares at Ned warily as he gets closer
Suddenly, Jeff squirts a stream of water in Ned's eyes
Frank sees his chance, rushing past Ned toward the vestibule
- Frank races through the vestibule behind Max's back
By the time Max turns to see who's there
Frank is gone
- Ned wipes the water from his eyes, blinking
He grabs the squirt gun away from Jeff, holding it up angrily
This
is not a toy
Yes it is
beat
Ned realizes he's right
Acting tough, he pulls the plug and drains the water out of the gun, then tosses it back to Jeff
Without missing a beat, Jeff drops the empty water magazine from the grip and jams a full one in
just like loading a cartridge clip
He smirks, ready for action
In the aisle next to them, the Old Woman now pulls her trunk back toward the vestibule
Jeff points the squirt gun at her
Suddenly, she whips around and   in the face with her own squirt gun
He sputters
- Max stares out the window, still seething
Behind him, the Old Woman moves into the vestibule, inch by inch, trying to drag her trunk into the first coach car
Max turns, sees her struggling and goes to her aid
Here
let me help you with that
He pushes the trunk into the first coach car, then very politely holds the door open for her
She smiles sweetly at him as she shuffles through
What a nice young man
You are so polite
(smiles) try to be
- Jeff is  to Ned
to the tune of "The Old Gray Mare
" Great green gobs of greasy, grimy gopher guts
mutilated monkey meat
chopped up dirty birdie's feet
one pint jar of all-purpose porpoise pus
cooked in a Mulligan stew
Ned turns queasy
The train lurches
He stiffens
- The Old Woman has unpacked her huge trunk
She has hung up clothes
set out a vase with flowers
hung up a big framed painting
and turned on a floor lamp
She pulls out a set of dumbbells, pumps them a couple times
and drops them on the floor with a loud
Frank watches her from his seat across the aisle with a blank expression
only his eyes moving
The Conductor punches the Old Woman's ticket, then holds out his hand, waiting
She pulls out a Smith & Wesson
44 Magnum
drops it in his bag
He waits
She pulls out an Uzi
-   - Up ahead, we see a tunnel approaching
Sequence omitted from original script

puke and snot all mixed together in a pot
Ned is looking very pale and queasy
Suddenly, Jeff jumps up
presses his face against the window
Oh boy
Here comes the tunnel
Ned can't take it anymore
He gets up, pale and sweating
-   - racing toward the tunnel
- Lana sees Ned stumble shakily into the aisle, moving toward the vestibule
Way to go, Ned
Right on time
The train enters the
Everything goes few beats, then
fills the car again as they emerge from the tunnel
Lana looks
Ned is gone
She heads down the aisle
- The Conductor is still tagging weapons as the Old Woman comes up with a Ruger Mini 14 machine gun, a Mauser C96 automatic handgun, a sawed-off double-barreled
12 gauge shotgun
and an old wooden slingshot
- Lana looks through the small window into the vestibule and catches a glimpse of a gray suit
She ducks back, leaning against the lavatory door
-   - Ned's dripping face rises up from the sink into view
He splashes more water on, trying to overcome his queasiness
- Lana reaches into her purse, pulls out a gun
She looks through the vestibule windows into the first coach car, her eyes searching for Frank
- '  - Frank pokes his head out into the aisle, looking toward Lana
He waves at her
- Lana ducks back, pressing herself against the lavatory door
gripping the gun, tense
- Ned starts to open the door, then stops
He notices the violin case
Opens it
couple of bullets roll around inside
Then, he sees the blender
puzzled
- Lana leans forward, looking through the vestibule windows, watching desperately for Frank's signal
- Frank looks out the window and sees
- ' It looms ahead
- Lana sees Frank's frantic signal
She raises the gun, pulls the hammer back and steps quickly into
- Max hears someone enter
He stiffens
- Ned steps out of the lavatory
- Lana
blowing a hole right through Max and the window behind him
She keeps firing
More bullets than the gun could ever possibly hold
- Ned hears the  and whirls around, looking into the vestibule through the glass window, just as
- Max turns to face Lana, filled with bloody bullet holes
You shootin' at me
Shocked to see it's Max, Lana empties the rest of the bullets into him
Max is  back into the vestibule door by the impact
Yeah
you're definitely shootin' at me
She fires one last shot
- Max flies out the door, executing a perfect "full gainer with a triple twist and a half-tuck"
a flawless Olympic style dive
ending with a dead body "belly flop" into the water
- Frank sees Max hit the river and lets out a loud "
" The Old Woman shoots him a nasty look
He stifles himself
- Ned slides the vestibule door open
steps toward Lana
In a daze, she raises the gun, points it at him, pulling the trigger
He takes the gun from her gently
- Frank jumps up, rushing forward
He skids to a stop
seeing Ned through the glass
Shocked, he ducks back
- In this crazy world, there's not a whole lot a guy can count on
But when the chips are down,  can always count on you
He takes her hand gently and kisses it
You risked your life to save mine guy can't ask any more from a woman than that
then,
He snaps a handcuff on her wrist
But  saw you shoot him, Lana
In cold blood
gotta arrest you for murder
Ned
you wouldn't
Sorry
'm a cop

But
you said it yourself

Don't worry, baby

whirls at us, snapping to a stop in someone's hands
upside down
The hands turn it rightside up
The headline reads: "
" The paper lowers, revealing Lola Cain with a gratified smile
- Ned and Laura move up the steps, surrounded by  and Questions are being fired from all sides
#1 What kind of gun did she use
That's a question for the arresting officer
#2 Aren't you the arresting officer
You'll have to ask her attorney
#1 But aren't you her attorney
Only her husband can answer that
#3 What will Mrs
Ravine be wearing at the trial
Ned stops at the top of the stairs, turning to the Reporters
lovely powder blue dress with a cinch waist, full bodice and a delicately pleated skirt
#3 Does it have a matching jacket
No comment
#3 Is it cotton or rayon
(perturbed) said
Ned and Laura turn and enter the building
#1 (calling out) Did she eat any of the victim's body parts
-   - Jeez
they're really throwing some tough questions out there today
They're just doing their job
Yeah
well  call it a "high-tech lynching of an uppity white housewife
" - It's huge, dark and shadowy
More than a dozen heavily armed stand guard all around the perimeter
In the center is a cell constructed of iron bars, like an animal cage
Ned and Laura enter
Arch steps over
(seeing the cage) What's this
Only cell available
They had that serial killer locked up here
you know, the one who talks his victims to death then eats them
Hannibal the Lecturer
But they let him out for a three week tour to publicize his new book
Arch hands him a hardbound book
(reading the cover) "To Serve Man
" It's a cookbook
Ned flips it over
-   - ' On the back is a picture of
wearing a baseball catcher's mask with barbed wire over the mouth
And look, look
he autographed it
Arch pulls the front cover of the book open, pointing
(reads it) To Arch
Love to have you for dinner sometime
Hannibal
(hands it back) Very nice
Arch points toward the cage
They're waiting for ya
They didn't want to start without her attorney being present
- There's a   on her mouth
The
beat
she spits the moth off, irritated
Damn moths
This place could use a good exterminator
Three   sit opposite Lana at a long table
Moths flutter everywhere
# 2 (to Police Guard) Let's get the  Team in here
Ned, Laura and Arch enter the cage as the Guard exits
Can't you get me out of this cage, Ned
'm goin' buggy in here
Judge said no bail
Don't worry
Just tell the truth, you'll be fine
He turns to the Investigators
Who's gonna handle the interrogation
1 It's your collar
your bust
your call
your show
your play
your move
your wife
Okay, okay
'll handle it
Laura sits at the far end of the table and opens her notebook
Lana pulls out her mirrored compact, starts to apply lipstick
2 Sorry Mrs
Ravine
there's no makeup allowed in this building
He nods toward a warning sign: a circle around a with a diagonal line thru it
She responds, cool, confident
What're you gonna do
arrest me for primping
In the b
g
, members of the  Team desperately swat at the fluttering moths
Ned spins his chair around, plants one foot on it, leans on his knee, looking hard at Lana
Don't give us a tough time
Just spill it
What were you doing on that train
Well
Ned raises his hand, sits down, leans close, changing his tone
(confidential) As your attorney,  must advise you
you don't have to answer that question
Ned stands, paces, agitated
plants his foot on the chair again
He leans toward her
getting tough again
Alright, quit playing games with us
(fires questions) Who put ya up to it
Where'd you get the gun
What's your link with the Ned jumps in, motioning with his hands for this to stop
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
That's it will not tolerate this unwarranted badgering of my client
She'll have her day in court, gentlemen
He slams his briefcase shut and turns to Lana, sincere
want to thank you, Mrs
Ravine, for being so cooperative with these gentlemen

Every word she said
Yep
Both of 'em

The Skunk stands stiffly on her lap, his paws planted on the guard rail, eyes bulging out
his fur standing straight up

It's open a crack
He moves inside cautiously
There is a strange   coming from the kitchen
He moves toward it
apprehensive
He enters the kitchen and
a huge bubbling pot on the stove, foam spilling over from under the lid
His mind reels
He charges out the back door

with his feet as he dashes across the huge back yard

Pasta with tomato sauce
Whatsa matta
You don't like Italian
Where's Ned Junior
thought he might like to get out, so  took him to the amusement park
He grabs Lola's arm and drags her toward the front door
You can't just break into my house, cook my food

Stay out of my face
Out of my neighborhood
Out of my She steps outside

You haven't seen the last of me, Ned

How can justice ever prevail when it is ridiculed and reviled in such a heinously revolting manner
This is Clement Von Franckenstein returning you to our  studios in London for the latest photographs of Lady Di naked in the bath
Ned and Laura push their way through the crush of

Ned and Laura sit at the defense table, next to Lana

Move to strike
Hearsay, irrelevant, stupid, idiotic, caca- doody poo-poo
Sustained
- Laura is on the stand
Ned hands her a sheet of paper
And can you tell us what this is
Yes
It's a death threat that Max Shady  to you on the day he was released from prison
Ned snatches it back, pacing, folding it into a paper airplane
in which he threatened to puree certain parts of my anatomy in a blender
'd like to submit this into evidence
(jumps up) Objection
Who cares about the in this case
'll allow it
Ned sails the paper plane toward the  , who is at an evidence table already piled high with tagged guns, appliances, knickknacks, auto parts and other junk
The plane sails toward an open window
The Clerk grabs it

back toward the courthouse

In the b

The Conductor is on the stand
Ned holds up a
And is this the blender you found in the lavatory of the train
Yes
it is
'd like this marked as evidence
The Bailiff reaches out, Ned waves him off
instead, tossing the blender over several heads to the Court Clerk
who runs to catch it,  into the wall
The blender falls, - Awwwww
a bad call by Ravine
Let's check out the re-play
On the -  we see the action repeated in as the Sportscaster draws lines, circles, x's and squiggles
Look at
The Bailiff is wide open
But instead of handing it off, Ravine goes for the long bomb
Ohhhh
The pass is wide
real wobbler
There's no way
He scrambles, but he just can't get his hands on it
And
(freezes the frame) That blender is gone
- At the defense table, Laura glances over at Lana, who is casually browsing through a copy of  &  magazine
Laura reacts, then, trying to be as diplomatic as possible
Ned
did you ever consider that maybe you don't know women as well as you think you do
(
) Now would you tell the court, in your own words, what you said to Mr
Ravine
They both look toward the witness stand
Ned is shaken
(whispers) 'm really worried about this guy
He could blow our whole case right out of the water
-   - Jeff, the little boy from the train is on the witness stand
The Prosecutor stands by, listening as
(singing) Great green gobs of greasy grimy gopher guts
mutilated monkey meat
itsy-bitsy birdie feet
Great green gobs of greasy grimy gopher guts
and me without a spoon
The  turn pale and reach for the air sickness bags in front of them
The Courtroom erupts
The Judge pounds his gavel
(pointing at Lana) That lady paid me two bucks to sing it to him
But   hears this in all the confusion
The Judge, also looking ill now, bangs his gavel again
Recess
Ten minutes
- The Judge, Jury, Attorneys and Spectators are all playing on the swings, teeter-totters, monkey bars
having a blast
Ned and the Prosecutor play "dodge-ball

The Prosecutor rockets the ball at Ned

Gotcha, dork face
Gotcha, gotcha

Let's go

- Marching band  fades off-screen
There they go
the  Marching Band
And now
Holy Toledo
it looks like the victim's mother
Helen Shady
is gonna take the stand
This will be the first defensive play of the afternoon
- Mrs
Shady is on the stand
Ned paces
Mrs
Shady
would you tell us about your son, Max
Was he a
a good boy
He was the best
And that's not just a mother talking
You can ask anybody
But he got into trouble once in awhile
like all kids do
Well, you know, pranks
Little jokes and things
But he was so cute have pictures
She reaches down into her huge purse, pulling out a photo album
She opens it, showing Ned
Here
This is when he set the cat on fire
(then, assuring him) Oh
but the cat deserved it
(looks, points) And what, uh
what are these
Marshmallows
He just loved to toast marshmallows over a roaring cat
Burned on the outside
all soft in the middle
(turns page) And right here
this was taken on the day he left the priesthood to join the Green Berets
- They rise slowly out of their seats, craning their necks, trying to see the photos
Ned is now seated next to Mrs
Shady in the witness box, looking at the photo album with her
Judge Skanky peers over the side of the bench
This is cute
(laughs, delighted) Oh yes
That was during his Ku Klux Klan phase
He would take the sheets right off my bed
cut those little holes in them
What a stitch he was
- are now on their feet, all straining to catch a glimpse of the photos in the album
And is this Max
with all the tools
fixing his bike
She snatches the photo out of the album
Why that shouldn't even be in there
It's his rotten little half-brother
(rips up photo) Stinkin' little pecker
he never was any good
- The Sportscaster is pushing his face against the broadcast booth glass, trying to see what everyone's looking at
(points at another) Oh
didn't like these neo-Nazi boys
They were all so fussy and persnickety about everything
Heil this and heil that
(flips the page) Oh look
here's Max with his chainsaw
He loved to go to the national park and cut down those giant old trees
It made him feel so patriotic
You know, if he hadn't been such a successful criminal think he would have been a lumberjack
The Court Clerk, Bailiff and Court Recorder have all moved around behind the witness stand, peering over Mrs
Shady's shoulder at the photos
(tearful, angry) But now he'll never be anything
Not since
(stands up, points) that woman, your wife, pulled the trigger and put my little Max in his grave
Mrs
Shady
Do not  your finger in my courtroom
It's discourteous, impolite and disrespectful
Don't you tell me what to do with my finger
It's been more places than you've ever dreamed of
(bangs gavel) Sit down
'll point my finger wherever  want
Mrs
Shady goes berserk
leaping from the witness stand, pointing several different fingers at Judge Skanky
The Bailiff attempts to restrain her, but she breaks free
scurrying around the courtroom, pointing fingers at everyone
prevails
- The Irritable Man from the train is on the stand
Max's huge cigar stuck in his ear
The hair around his ear is scorched
Did you encounter the victim
Max Shady
on board the train
Yeah
And  told him
"this is the car
Would you please put out your damn cigar
" And is that the cigar in your ear
The Man strains to see the cigar out of the corner of his eye
Impatient, Ned finally holds up a small pocket mirror
believe it is
'd like the cigar and the head of this witness entered into evidence
The Bailiff picks up the Irritable Man and dumps him on the evidence table, where he is tagged by the Court Clerk
The defense calls
Lana Ravine
- Lana is on the stand
The Bailiff swears her in
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God
(looks to Judge) Do  have to answer that, Harlan
No, no dear
'll vouch for her
Ned approaches
Now, Mrs
Ravine
may  call you Lana
No
Call me Angel Tits
object
Sustained
Counselor
you will address Angel Tits as Mrs
Ravine
(after a beat) Mrs
Ravine
would you please tell the court
what were you doing on that train
saw Max Shady at the station
saw him get on board
knew he'd made threats to kill you and mutilate your reproductive organs
Ned and   in the courtroom winces at this, doubling over in imagined agony
Lana pauses, then continues
so  got on the train too
so could warn you
Do you want to have children
Someday
With the right man
But you couldn't have children if my
(makes a gesture) were
(another gesture) and, uh
It would be difficult
So you followed him, knowing you had to protect me
your husband
your best friend
the man you love
the future father of your children
Something like that
And when you saw that maniac standing in the vestibule, waiting to pulverize my pee-pee
you pulled the gun and fired and fired and
And fired and fired and fired and fired and fired and fired and fired
She pauses to count off on her fingers, then
and fired and fired and fired
The defense rests, your Honor
- The   has been sketching intensely throughout the trial
We finally see
he's been sketching a on the Court Recorder's desk
Ned picks up some fruit from the bowl and approaches the defense table
How can you convict a courageous woman who risked everything to save the life of her beloved husband woman who acted boldly to stop a demented maniac from doing
Ned shoves the  and two  into a demonstration blender on the defense table
He hits the puree button and the blender  loudly
(shouts over) pulverizing the private parts of the man she loves
All  in the courtroom react with pained expressions, cringing and doubling-over
Ned turns the blender off
(directly to Jury) Lana Ravine is a loving wife and the potential mother of my potential child

Inside, a press their pants on a dozen ironing boards
The jury's back
The Reporters scramble for the door, pulling their pants on
- The   a folded piece of paper as the Jurors pass it along to the
who hands it to the Bailiff
who hands it to the Judge
He unfolds it, reads it
then winks flirtatiously at the   who wrote it
She blushes
(back to business) So
has the jury reached a verdict
(stands up) Yes we have, your Honor
How do you find the defendant

Not guilty
On the count of murder in the first degree

The Jury and Spectators start to rise
The Judge hesitates, gavel poised, shooting them a warning look
Wait

it
Everyone  halfway out of their seats
waiting
Two and a half
He smacks his gavel
Everyone scatters for the doors, but Judge Skanky beats them out of the room
Lana turns cool, dropping her courtroom facade
She plucks off her earrings, unbuttons the neck of her dress, reaches in and magically pulls out her bra, tossing it away
Well, counselor, looks like you won another case
Lucky for me
sneak up behind Ned and dump a big plastic barrel of Gatorade cans over his head

All trial evidence now on sale
Forty to sixty percent off all exhibits
Everything must go

An   claims the Irritable Man, grabbing the cigar from his ear and throwing it down
told you, Bernard
smoking cigars is bad for your hearing
She pulls him away as Lana steps up, with a cigarette dangling from her lips
Lana picks up her gun and spins the cylinder
It's loaded
The battered Court Clerk limps over, smiling
Mrs
Ravine
What can  do for ya
How much for my gun
Laura sees this
turns to Ned with a look of shock
don't believe it
She just bought her gun back
The gun she used to kill a man
Ned looks off toward Lana with admiration
Yeah
the same gun that saved my life
'm sure it has sentimental value
As Lana wades into the crowd of , some still without pants, the    Lola, who is watching Lana from the back of the courtroom
Lola pulls a small cord hanging from the side of her hat
opening her veil like window drapes
She's not happy
'  - Frank lays on a mechanic's "creeper", working under a car
Lana steps between his feet
He hears her and rolls out, his crotch sliding to a stop against her legs
He looks up, covered with black grease
So
you did it
Ya beat the rap
No thanks to you
He gets to his feet, cocky
Hey
knew he'd spring ya
She walks toward him, her voice cold, accusing
He backs up
You didn't lift a finger, Frank
You let me take all the heat
Heeeee-eeey
what could  do
Lana pulls the gun from her purse, pointing it at him
You were gonna let me rot in the slammer
never say a thing
Look
you're out
free
Now we're together
That's what counts
We can try again
Forget triple indemnity
We'll whack him and split three mil
'm not splitting anything, Frank
(cocks the gun) And you know too much
(arrogant) Come on, Lana
You're not gonna shoot me
He brashly turns his back to her, putting some tools away
She sees a huge electric powered  on the workbench next to her, smiling diabolically
She lowers the gun
You're right
(then, seductive) Maybe 'll just screw you to death
He laughs arrogantly
starts to unbutton his shirt
Now you're talkin' baby

One of the Coroner's  approaches Arch and Ned
Looks like a suicide
We found a note
He holds up a rolled piece of paper with a pair of tweezers
Ned takes it, trying to unroll it
It was stuck up his nose
Ned hands it off to Arch, who casually unrolls it
The Investigator slips, arms waving, and falls out of frame

and a lousy lover

Arch gives Ned a very strange look

Lana and Lola turn to see him in the doorway
He is shocked
Lana looks shaken
But Lola is cool
in control
Oh
uh, Ned
This is Lola, um
(nervous, defensive) Um
She told you her name was Um
And what other lies did she tell you
've never seen this woman in my life
Never followed her home
Never had sex with her in the refrigerator
It's all a sick fantasy
and  deny everything
He turns to Lola
When will women like you learn, you can't tear apart a perfectly good marriage with your vicious lies
Miss
Actually

Lola Smith

Ravine
The big powerful kind that suck up everything in sight

Just you and me

Great
Listen

He kisses her and exits
Lana turns to look up toward the landing, a vengefully insane smile clouding her face

Lola hesitates at the door
Who is it
The door
Ned is silhouetted in the doorway
He looks really pissed
Lola turns and runs
Ned sprints after her, leaping through the air
bringing her down with a tackle
just want to talk
Why didn't you say so
Her foot shoots out, smashing him right in the face
She jumps up and scrambles away
Ned pursues her
She grabs a bottle of scotch from the counter, spins around
Would you like a drink
She throws the bottle
He ducks and it shatters on the wall
No thanks
'm driving
She whirls on one foot, nailing him in the head with a He stumbles back, dazed
She grabs an ice pick
Then let's get to the point
Lola charges
Ned rolls onto his back, jamming both feet into her stomach, heaving her up over him

She  into the wall
then slowly turns
still cool and collected
She raises a cigarette
lights it with the ice pick "lighter
" So what's your problem, tough guy
Stay away from my life, my wife, my home and my pets

He shoves her against the wall

(shocked) She doesn't deserve a She's a brat
bad girl
She always was and always will be
He grabs her by the shoulders, shaking her
What are you talking about
You don't know anything about Lana

Who is she to you
She clams up
He slaps her
Who is she

He raises his hand to slap her hard
She  him
She's my sister
She continues to slap him
back and forth
repeating her answers
"She's your wife"
"She's my sister
"
"Your wife
"
"My sister
"
"Wife
"
"Sister
" He reaches a boiling point, raising two fingers, preparing to give her the Three Stooges "two-fingered eye poke
" She blocks it with her hand and shoves him away
Then, she executes a perfect Three Stooges "wiggly-hand head slap", telling him
She's your wife
my sister
Ned is stunned
dramatically
Lana clicks the stereo off
The
She was spoiled rotten
She stole everything  ever had
Everything
Including him
Him
Who, him
Dwayne
The boy's gym teacher
He was older
So mature
so strong
He smelled like dirty sweat socks and old basketballs
And he was all mine
For awhile
(turning bitter) But Lana wasn't satisfied with her own things
She had to have mine too
She took it all
my makeup, my sweaters, my shoes, my underwear
You wore the same clothes
We were identical twins
What're you talking about
You two don't look anything alike
Not anymore
One day  caught her stealing my lavender eye shadow and she smashed my face in with a shovel
had fifty-three operations
When the doctors were finished with me
looked like
'm ugly
You're beautiful
Don't lie to me
They did a terrific job
look in the mirror
can
But
you're gorgeous
Tell that to Dwayne
When he saw my face, he left me for
because she looked more like me than  did
First she stole my looks
then she stole the only man who ever loved me
She comes toward him
feeling in control once more
But  found a way to get even
The best revenge possible
Destroy her marriage
That's why you did all this
Seduced me
harrassed me
the tape
the flowers
the phone calls
You been hangin' out with Dick Tracy, haven't ya
It won't work
Lana loves me
It doesn't matter
'm blackmailing her for everything she's worth
She murdered that greasy auto mechanic
saw her do it
(stunned) Lana killed Frank Kelbo
(also stunned) Kelbo
His name was Kelbo
Yeah
Why
Did he burn you on car repairs too
Dwayne's name was Kelbo
He had a son
Frankie Kelbo
'  - Ned wanders to his car, climbs in, sits there
stunned
(
) The pieces of the puzzle were falling into place and  didn't like the picture they were making
If Lana really killed Frank Kelbo, then had misjudged her by a mile
Sure
he was a lousy mechanic
But murder
Ned rubs his temples, shuts his eyes
(
) It was all starting to give me a headache bigger than the national deficit
'  - "In--Gadda-Da-Vida" plays on the stereo
Lola sits on the floor by an end table, eyes dazed, staring blankly
lamp with a "clapper" switch sits on the table
As the     to her, she absently "claps" the light off
then on
then off
then on
then off
'  - female hands using a keyhole saw to cut through a railing on the second floor landing above the foyer
Outside
the  of a car
headlights
The sawing stops

The house is dark and ominous
So is the
'  - The front door is open a crack
He cautiously pushes it and the door ---- open very slowly
The door , but the   continues
Ned touches it lightly with the tip of his finger
The
Lana
Ned moves up the stairs
The    with him, an  of the partially severed railing
- Ned enters
Hot water gushes from the faucet into a clawfoot bathtub
He turns the water off, looking around, puzzled
Loosens his tie, rubs his head
splitting headache
Opens the medicine cabinet and
leaps out
darts away
There's a  from downstairs
- Someone is  on the door
Ned enters and opens it
It's Laura
Ned
'm glad you're here
have so much to tell you
Come on in
'll make some tea
Grab a chair
Thanks
brought my own
She drags a chair in behind her, sits at the kitchen table
Ned puts a kettle on the burner, turns it on
He starts searching through the cupboard for teabags
So
what have you got
lottery ticket and a laundry receipt
(lays them on table) found them in the pocket of that suit you wore the night you were working under cover with a client
Ned freezes, staring out the window, unable to face her
You remember that night, don't ya Ned
Then it hit me
Lottery starts with -
Laundry starts with -
- -
Lola
Ned turns to her when he hears Lola's name
looking baffled by this convoluted piece of logic
(shrugs it off) Don't sweat it
It's the way a woman's mind works
He turns back to the cupboard, picking up a container
How about Ovaltine
Fine
Then  remembered you told me some guy named Frank had been working on your wife's car for two months
You with me so far
'm way ahead of you
He brings the Ovaltine container to the table
Well back it up
You probably took a wrong turn
Remember your insurance policy
the one we couldn't find
started thinking, who else had access to it beside you and me
The answer came up
Lana
And since she's a woman, it's probably hidden right here
huge ceramic cookie jar sits on the table in front of them
Laura  it with her fist, breaking it open
Cookies spill out
and the insurance policy
So that's where she hid the Oreos
He sits down
starts eating Oreos
twisting them apart
Ned, Lana wasn't trying to save your life when she shot Max Shady
She and Frank were plotting to kill you and collect on your insurance policy
But she shot the wrong guy
That's the craziest thing  ever heard
(she presses on) Don't you see
Frank was going to let her take the fall
So she murdered him and tried to make it look like suicide
(beat) That's when  realized there was a connection between Lola and Lana
Yeah
they're sisters
Twin sisters
Well, hang on to your jock strap, Ned
There's more
She unrolls a complex genealogical chart
walks him thru it
Not only is Frank's father Dwayne Kelbo, notoriously amorous gym teacher and Lola Cain's former lover
Frank's mother is Helen Shady
Max and Frank are half-brothers who never met
Laura pauses dramatically, then announces
Your lovely wife, Lana, murdered both of Helen Shady's sons
This is so unbelievable
And you haven't even heard my story
-   - The keyhole saw cuts through the railing
The Lana, eyes filled with Machiavellian rage
She enters the bathroom, lays the saw blade down
Suddenly
a    plunge into frame, grabbing her by the throat
We    as she is pushed back into the tub, the hands forcing her head under water
Lana grabs a diving mask, clamps it over her face
One of the attacking hands rips it away
Lana grabs a snorkel, sticking it in her mouth
The hand pulls it from her, tossing it aside
The hand shoves a little   into Lana's mouth
Lana struggles, finally going limp
Her open eyes stare up from beneath the water
The last few bubbles rise to the surface
- He turned into a monster
And that's when  left him
just couldn't
The tea kettle
Laura pulls it off the burner
The whistling subsides
replaced by the distant  of water running upstairs
Ned cocks his head, listening
That damn faucet keeps turning on all by itself
'll go check it
Okay
'll make the Ovaltine
Ned exits
Laura opens the Ovaltine container
It's empty moves past the window behind Laura
Suspense Laura opens the cupboard
explode out, wings beating furiously
She catches her breath, looks in the cupboard
The cans and boxes are covered with pigeon shit
She shoves them aside, looking for the Ovaltine
- Ned looks up toward the light from the bathroom
Water seeps over the edge of the landing and down the steps
As he moves up the steps, the  of
the familiar strains of "In--Gadda-Da-Vida"
grows louder and
- It's filled with steam
He waves the steam away to see Lana's lifeless body beneath the water, the rubber duckie jammed into her mouth
The tub overflows on the floor
He turns the faucet off
The water stops
and so does the Puzzled, he turns the faucet on
The
Turns it off

- As Laura turns away to enter the pantry
her Husband's twisted face suddenly appears in the kitchen window
- Ned enters
The  is coming from the closet
Ned yanks the door open
flock of  bursts out
revealing a playing an instrument
'm sittin' in for Dizzy
He had a gig tonight
Ned shuts the door, eyes shifting
Lola must be near
- Laura searches the large walk-in pantry for tea bags
She hears a   of   in the kitchen
stops and listens
then casually shrugs it off
- Laura's Husband stands in the kitchen
The back door is open
the window shattered
He
the kitchen towels hanging sloppily on the rack
The disorganized clutter of cans and boxes in the cupboard
to his wildly insane eyes
- As Ned enters the upstairs landing, we hear  in his mind
(
) Women are an open book
You can always tell the rotten apples from the peaches
'd stake my career on it
stake my career on it
stake my career on it
The repetitive  gets to him
He smacks his head with the palm of his hand
The skipping stops
followed by
(
) If anyone ever proves me wrong, 'll throw away my badge
woman's  unrolls a leather kit
the "-Pick an Ice Pick Porta-Pik-Pak
"
with seven ice picks in separate slots, each labeled with a day of the week
The hand selects "Wednesday's" ice pick, pulls it out
Then
- It  loudly
It's twelve midnight
returns the ice pick to its slot, selects the one for Thursday
- Laura comes out of the pantry
She stops
gasps
Everything in the cupboard is neatly stacked
All the towels are straight
She whirls around
coming face to face with her Husband
He smiles demonically, holding up the Ninja Turtle float ring
' Forget something, sweetheart
- Ned nears the bathroom door and suddenly
Lola charges, an ice pick raised over her head
She knocks him backward, into the bathroom, slashing at him
But he deflects the attack, grabbing at her arms
- Laura backs away from her Husband
He holds her wedding ring
' You forgot to flush, darling
- As Ned and Lola continue their violent struggle
Lola grabs toiletries to aid in her attack
She squirts Ned with squeezes  in his hair
and throws in his face
Ned is blinded
Gaining the advantage, Lola shoves him back, slamming his head into the wall
He's dazed, helpless
Lola raises the ice pick, moving forward to strike
But Ned grabs a   and swings it around, pointing it at her like a gun
She freezes
then smiles contemptuously
What're you gonna do, Ned
Blow me away
She  arrogantly
Ned clicks on the hair blower to , a blast of   hitting Lola's face, puffing her cheeks out, pushing her back, hair flying wildly
Her backside hits the railing where Lana has cut it
the wood splintering
Lola tumbles over backward,
She hangs suspended in mid-air for a moment, like a cartoon character, arms flailing
Then
she  to the marble floor below, hitting with a
- Laura's Husband hears Lola fall, turning
Laura grabs the iron skillet and  him with it
He goes down
never forget anything
honey
- Ned stares at the hair blower in his hand
Filled with disgust and revulsion, he throws the "weapon" down
- Laura pulls   from her purse
spinning them like John Wayne
expertly tossing one over her back, catching it in front
She heads for the foyer
-    -  ' Laura pauses, looks down at Lola's body
notices something
She pushes Lola's skirt a bit higher with the toe of her shoe
(outraged) Those are  panties
She looks up
sees a light emanating from the bathroom
Laura moves through the shadows
stops outside the bathroom, pressing her back against the wall, guns up and ready
She swivels into the doorway
taking a shooter's stance
guns pointed
She sees
submerged in the tub, face up, the rubber duckie in her mouth
Laura steps back and turns
right into a  covered in white
Startled, she
Ned drops the white towel he's using to wipe off all of the shaving cream and toothpaste
Relieved to see it's Ned, she throws her arms around him
Oh Ned
You were right
there's a million things  don't know about women
Maybe you can teach me a few hundred
He pulls out his police badge, looks at it
Hell
had too many careers anyway
He tosses it away, over the railing
-   - The badge drops from above, landing on the floor right in front of Lola's lifeless face
beat
Her eyes pop open
-     - Suddenly, the rubber duckie pops to the surface
Laura hugs Ned again, arms locked around his neck, still gripping a gun in each hand
Oh Ned,  love you
always loved you
Lola sits bolt upright, bloody but still bouncy
Lana suddenly   in the tub, inhaling a huge  of air, her eyes wild
- Laura's Husband's eyes
He   suddenly
smashing his head into the sharp corner of the kitchen table
He topples back slowly
really dead
Finally
Lola's feet move steadily up each stair
her bloody hand grasping the ice pick
- Lana's feet step out of the tub, water dripping all around
She picks up the pointed saw from the floor
Ned and Laura still embrace, her forearms crisscrossed behind his neck
It's been a long embrace
Suddenly, Lana and Lola both appear,  like banshees
Lana charges from the bathroom, grasping the sharp saw blade
Lola races at them from the stairway
with the ice pick
Without missing a beat, Laura raises the barrels of both guns and  at them simultaneously
right next to Ned's ears
The impact of one bullet knocks Lana all the way back through the bathroom,  spectacularly out the window
The other bullet sends Lola flipping down the staircase
Ned looks stunned, his eyes crossed
the thundering gunshots still ringing in his ears
Laura proudly blows the gunsmoke away from the end of each barrel
Got 'em
(deafened) said
'
(yells) '
-
He strains to make out what she's saying, ears still ringing
(yells back) ' beat
Laura opens her mouth to correct him, then decides against it
She smiles
speaking softly, almost shyly
Okay
But  want to have kids
He hears
smiles at her
Great
They embrace
'  -   - We    toward the house
(
) So
maybe  was wrong
Maybe women really are like a big jigsaw puzzle
with pieces that never seem to fit where you want 'em to
'  -   - Ned and Laura are in bed, wrapped in each other's arms
(
) All  know is, there are three things that men can't possibly ever do
- Revealing that it's  "voice over narration
" Ned is actually rattling on aloud again
understand women

and program a
And giving birth is the easy one
Ned
Yeah, Laura
Knock off the chatter, will ya
He smiles at her
They kiss
Romantic   begins to play
only this time, it's "Laura's Theme
" The
revealing Dizzy laying on the bed beside them
playing the sax
After a beat, Laura turns to Dizzy
We won't need you anymore
Ned casually slips him a twenty dollar bill
Dizzy slips off the bed and out the door
Laura turns to Ned
We can make our own music
Her hand reaches slowly over the edge of the bed, toward the floor
Suddenly
she comes up with a , a small accordian
and begins to play it
Ned lays there listening for a few moments, a stunned look frozen on his face
Then
he reaches under the pillow and pulls out a  and joins in
The    to a
as they play of all the  heard in the film
After the final credit,  : (
) Ned, do you know
want you to make love to me all night long
(
) No
But if you hum a few bars
'll fake it
