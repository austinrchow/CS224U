"South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut", by Trey Parker & Matt Stone & Pam Brady South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut By Trey Parker Matt Stone Pam Brady Eighth Draft January 21, 1999 : Very happy, Disneyesque  swirls in
from a pretty blue sky, to a small quaint town nestled in the hills
wooden sign tells us this is South Park
- Birds fly into the air,  smile to each other as they walk by
It is a scene reminiscent of, if not directly ripped off from, the opening number of 'Beauty and the Beast'
little eight year old boy walks happily down the street
He is  , a noble looking boy with piercing blue eyes and a strong chin
As he walks, he sings a happy song
'm going to the movies To see the brighter side of life
'm going to the movie Everything's gonna be alright
Forget all my troubles Put my own life on hold Let a studio tell me how  should view the world Where everything works out love it that way 'm going to the movies The movies today
Stan merrily walks up to a crappy looking house
- We are in a young boy's bedroom, just as his alarm clock goes off
Good morning South Park
It's five-thirty a
m
on Sunday
Time to feed the horses and water the cows
From the back, we see the blond haired kid sit up from his bed
He stretches, and then walks over to his closet
We still only see the boy from the back as he reaches in his closet and pulls out an orange coat
The kid puts his coat on, then turns to camera and pulls the hood shut, so that we never get a good look at his face
(
) '
This boy's name is , and under his orange coat, we have no idea what he looks like, except for his European nose and hazel eyes
Mph rmph rm
'  - Kenny walks through his small, dirty house and into the kitchen, where his ,  and   are sitting at the humble table
' Sit down, you can share some of your brother's waffle
The doorbell rings
Kenny walks over to the door
'  - Kenny opens the door to find Stan
Kenny
The Terrance and Phillip movie is out
You wanna come
Stan shows Kenny a newspaper clipping
It's an ad for the new Terrance and Phillip movie 'Asses of fire'
Kenny's eyes light up
Mph rmph rm, rmph
Kenny walks away with Stan
His mother comes out after him
' Kenny
Where're you going
Mph mprh mprh rm
' What do you mean you don't want to go to church
Mrmph, rmph rmph rm rmph
Kenny and Stan walk down the street
' Well fine, go ahead and miss church
And then when you die and go to hell you can Dramatic
Kenny stops, thinks for a minute
And then walks off with Stan anyway
- Stan and Kenny now both happily march down the street to the happy beat
, a plastic surgeon, peeps his head out the door of his Rhinoplasty office
Say, where are you boys going
We're going to the movies
To see the brighter side of life
Where everyone is beautiful And have their hair combed just right
Mph rmph rm rmph rm
Mph rm rmph rm
Mprh rm rmph rm rm Rmph rm rmph rm rmph
Have fun you rascals
'  - Kenny and Stan knock at the door
handsome eight year old Semite, , answers the door
Hey, dudes
Aren't you supposed to go to church, Kenny
Kyle, check it out
Kenny holds up the newspaper clipping
,
Kyle slips on his coat and heads out the door
But just then, Kyle's little brother, , a two year old adopted Canadian boy bounces up next to him
No, Ike
You can't come with me
Kyle's , a big fat bitch, comes to the door and yells
' Kyle, you take your little brother out to play with you
Aw, ma
' Do as  say, Kyle
Kyle's mother closes the door
Damn it
- Now the three boys, and little Ike, merrily strut down the street and sing in unison
We're going to the movies To see the better side of life Where something interesting happens Every day and night
In movies we can pretend That love is real and good always wins- We can even make believe marriages last
guy is lying in the alley
Spare a dollar
Spare a dollar
Stan walks by and throws a dollar at him
The homeless guy suddenly jumps up
'm going to the movies
To see the brighter side of life
'm going to the movies Everything's gonna be alright
Forget my troubles Put my own life on hold Let a studio tell me how to view the world
Let's go get fat ass
- This house looks just like all the others
on a bag that reads ' '
hand reaches into the bag, pulls out a wad of orange crunchies and raises them -- to reveal the fat face of eight year old who chows down on the chips
Now we see that fat little Eric is sitting on his couch, eating Cheesy Poofs and watching television
The doorbell rings
Cartman doesn't move a muscle
'
'  enters
She is extremely June Cleaveresque (except that she's a hermaphrodite crack whore)
She returns with Stan, Kyle and Kenny
' Look, Eric it's your little friends
What the hell are you guys doing here
Baba turtre bad
Kyle holds up the newspaper ad
Ooh
Now all four boys are merrily walking down the street and singing
We're going to the movies To see the better side of life
Maybe there'll be pirates
Or a whole city burnin'
Maybe we'll see a monster Or, better yet, Uma Thurman
We're going to the movies
Everything's gonna be okay
The boys skip out of frame
- The movie theatre is nestled neatly between two other South Park buildings
The boys walk up to the geeky, teenage
Going to the movies
The movies today
Can  get five tickets to Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire, please
No
Suddenly, all the happy music that has permeated the film comes to an
The boys look confused
What'dya mean, no
Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire is rated ''
You kids can't get in
The boys look shocked
They just stand there, in silence
The hell we can't
My money is just as good as any white person's
You have to be accompanied by a parent or guardian
But why
Because this movie has naughty language, and it might make you kids start using bad words
Listen you son of a bitch, if you don't let us in to see this movie 'm gonna kick you square in the nuts
Sorry, Charlie
Damn it
Next, please
few  walk up to get their tickets
The boys step aside
This is terrible
This can't be happening
We  to see this movie, dude
Aw, screw it
It probably isn't all that good anyway
Cartman
What the hell are you talking about
You  Terrance and Philiip
Yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it probably can't sustain itself over ninety minutes
Poo baba
Wait
've got an idea
- The old Homeless guy from the intro song walks up to the Ticket Guy with the boys
Uh, hi
want five tickets to Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire
You realize this movie is rated
It may not be appropriate for your little ones
Oh
(Turning to boys) Hey, he says this movie isn't appropriate for you
(Whispering) Look, homeless guy, if you don't want to buy us tickets, and  get your ten bucks and  go buy yourself a bottle of Vodka and not forget about how miserable your life is and not stop the voices in your head then go right ahead
Five tickets please
The Ticket guy suspiciously hands them over
- The boys are all sitting in the front row
Cartman has a huge tub of popcorn, all kinds of candy, and a large drink
Purpre mama
Be quiet, Ike
The movie's starting
- reads 'Terrance and Phillip - Asses of Fire' On the screen, we come across , a very handsome Canadian star with a great body
Say Terrance, what did the Spanish Priest say to the Uranian gynecologist
to , who is also Canadian, and equally handsome in a more rugged way
don't know, Phillip, what
Phillip rips a big fart
Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily
- Laughing their asses off
That was sweet
Where do they come up with this stuff
How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike
Oh
Poo bada
- You're such a pigfucker, Phillip
What
Why would you call me a pigfucker
Well, let's see
First of all, you fuck pigs
Oh yeah
Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily
- Woa, dude
Did they say what  think they said
- Terrance pulls out a white envelope
Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, just got a letter
letter from who, you shit sucking cock master
on the boys' wide eyed faces as the dialogue from the film enters their innocent ears
It's from your mother
My mother sent  a letter
What's it say
It says 'Dear Terrance, please don't ever tell my son that  licked your hairy balls
' Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily
Oh, you fucking ball whore
The boys don't laugh, they just smile widely, they seem busy taking it all in
Wow
Ball whore
Listen, you donkey raping shit eater- (To himself) Donkey raping shit eater
Doky maping she deeder
You'd fuck your uncle
' fuck your uncle
(Singing) Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka
You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka
You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you- ' the one that fucked your Uncle,

& Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka
You butt licking bastard Unclefucka
You're an Unclefucka  must say
You fucked  Uncle yesterday
& Unclefucka
That's
The song ends and the boys erupt into applause
- The boys walk out of the theatre with glazed eyes and wide smiles
Dude, that movie was fucking sweet
You bet your fucking ass it was
Fuck, dude,  wanna be just like Terrance and Phillip
Hey wait a minute
Where's your guardian
Huh
knew it
You  a homeless guy to get you in, didn't you
The boys think a second
Suck my balls
Yeah, (Singing) Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka
The boys walk away, merrily
The ticket guy is in shock
Oh oh, 'm in trouble
(Singing, fading off) You're an asslicking, ball sucking Unclefucka
'  - All the children of South Park are gathered at the pond for ice skating
The scene is reminiscent of the skating scene from the Charlie Brown Christmas special
Delicate snowflakes fall, children laugh and skate, and joyous music plays
The boys walk up to the pond
Hey, where have you guys been all day
Oh, nowhere
We just went out to go see the
All the kids gasp
Dramatic
You saw it
How'd you get in
Suddenly, all the kids are gathered around the boys
They're like celebrities
Hey
Stop crowding us you shitfaced cockmasters
All the kids stop, wide eyed
As if they've just hear the voice of God
Wowwww
Yeah, you're all a bunch of ass ramming unclefuckers
Ooooohhh
(To another kid) We  to see this movie, dude
The other kids nod
Hey Stan, tell 'em about when Terrance called Phillip a testicle shitting rectal wart
Stan
Stan
But Stan is elsewhere, because out on the ice, skating gracefully, is little eight year old
The heavens part, a    sing, as Wendy skates around and around, performing a series of impossible Triple Lutzes, Sowcows and what-have-you-not's
All the animals of the forest -- deer, birds, bunnies -- all stop to admire her
Stan's smile grows wider and wider
Kyle turns to see what he's looking at
Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything 'd ever hoped for Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing  think 'd die for
Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that fucking song again
- Spinning and soaring in slo-mo
Effortlessly covering every inch of the pond with her ballet maneuvers
Stan is slack-jawed
can't stop now My heart's awake pray her arms my arms to take So this is why 'm ali- Wendy finishes her routine with a triumphant Hamill-camel landing right in front of Stan and spraying ice in his face and abruptly ending his song
Hi, Stan
Stan vomits profusely all over himself
Ew
Gross
Just then, another kid skates up, spraying more ice in Stan's face
His name is , and he is a very handsome eight year old boy, with golden hair and an open-buttoned shirt
He speaks with a rich English accent
Come, Wendy, let us try to jump the hilly brush
Stan looks at Gregory
Who are you, kid
My name is Gregory
have been Wendy's counter-cousin for some time
Want to skate with us
We've been skating all morning
And laughing and talking of memories past
Gregory skates away
Stan looks stunned
Finally, he tries to get Wendy's attention
We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie
That's nice, Stan
Wendy skates after Gregory
Stan looks completely rejected
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy
She's not my girlfriend, dude
Meanwhile, the schoolkids are all still gathered around Cartman
Yes,  saw the Terrance and Phillip movie
Who wants to touch me
said, "Who wants to touch me
" small boy steps forward and tentatively touches Cartman's arm
Oooooh
-  - Establishing shot of the little town of South Park which consists of four buildings
The sun rises in the background
It's a brand new day
- The elementary school is nestled peacefully between two mountain peaks
- The kids of South Park are all in their seats, singing
Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka
You're a shitsucking, cocksucking Unclefucka
The door opens, and suddenly the kids quiet down
- on a hand puppet with a large red hat
It seems to be speaking
Okay, children, let's take our seats
As the voice continues, we   to reveal that the puppet is on the right hand of
, a forty-six year old teacher who is in denial about his homosexuality
(
) We have a lot to learn and precious little time
Garrison looks over the class and notices that every single one of them is wearing a Terrance and Phillip -shirt, except, of course, for Wendy
Why is everyone wearing -shirts of Sigfried and Roy
It's not Sigried and Roy, Mr
Garrison, it's Terrance and Phillip
Stan looks over at Wendy
She just rolls her eyes
Stan sulks
Well, anyway
Today children, our friend Mr
Hat is going to tell us all about the environment
(
) That's right, Mr
Garrison
The environment is what surrounds us
It is what we live and breathe
hate the environment
Dude, how can you hate the environment
'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff
fucking hate it
The kids all
Eric
Did you just say the "" word
Fragile
No, he's talking about fuck, dude
You can't say fuck in front of Mr
Garrison
Kyle
Why the fuck not
Eric
Dude, you just said fuck again
Stanly
Mph
Kenny
That's bullshit
If Terrance and Phillip can say something,  should be able to say it too
Wow, Cartman's cool
He's like Terrance and Phillip
Cartman gloats proudly
Fuckin' a right
How would you like to go to the principal's office
How would you like to gargle rat jiz
Mr
Garrison is in shock
said - Cartman takes out a megaphone, hits the switch and puts it to his mouth
It feeds back horribly
(Through megaphone) Garrison is floored
Oh, dude we are fucked now
'  - The boys are seated in front of the Principal's desk
Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie
Yeah, let's swear we won't tell
Just then, the Principal walks in
She is  , a frizzy haired woman of about forty
am  disappointed in you boys
You should be  of yourselves
've already called in your parents, but first want you to  about what you've done
Principal Victoria, can  ask a question
What
What's the big fucking deal
Yeah
want to know where you heard these horrific obscenities
The boys look at each other
Nowhere
' heard them from Mr
Garrison a few times before
Yeah
Boys,  seriously doubt that Mr
Garrison ever said- (Reading) 'Eat penguin shit you cum sucking ass spelunker' in school
The boys all laugh
But then the door opens and in walks Stan's mother, Kyle's mother, Cartman's mother and Kenny's mother
Oh, oh
Thank you all for coming on such short notice
As you can see, your boys are all being disciplined
' This just isn't like you, Stanley
Stan looks down at the floor
' What did my son say, Principal Victoria
Did he say the  word
No, it was worse than that
' (Gasping) The  word
No, worse
Here's a short list of the things they've been saying
The mothers look over the sheet of paper
Immediately, their eyes bulge
' Oh dear God
' What is 'fisting'
' That's when the fist is inserted into the anus or vagina for sexual pleasure
The two moms stare at Ms
Cartman
' What
' (To Kyle) Young man, you will tell Peincipal Victoria   where you heard all these horrible phrases
can't dude
We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy
It was the Terrance and Phllip movie
Dude
What
Fuck you guys,  wanna get out of here
' Terrance and Phillip
Oy gevalt
Not again
What is Terrance and Phillip
' Terrance and Phillip are two untalented, unfunny actors from Canada
Their  show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage
Now it appears they have a movie and 'm positive it's not suitable for children
Well, it looks like 'll have to send a warning letter out to parents
have to put a stop to this before  children see 'Terrance and Phillip'
Everybody's already fucking seen it
Eric
'm sorry
can't help it
That movie has warped my fragile little mind
' Alright, boys, that's enough
Get out and let us adults speak
The boys get up and walk out
Kyle's mother slams the door behind them
' We must take action on this immediately
Ooh yes
think we'll have to give detention to those boys
' Forgive me for saying so, Principal Victoria, but your methods are too
Shall we say
soft
As head of the ,  am exercising my right under article 42 of the  code
look of shock comes over the principal's face
Article 42
You don't mean-
' Yes Principal Victoria
The  is impeaching you
But - ' You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school
Kyle's mother sits herself down at Principal Victoria's desk
' Get out of that chair
The  is in charge now
- The other school kids are in line for lunch
Just then, the Kyle's mother's voice comes blaring through the
' Attention students
We are now enforcing a new dress code at South Park Elementary
Terrance and Phillip shirts are
Anyone wearing a Terrance and Phillip shirt is to be
The kids look down
They're all wearing Terrance and Phillip shirts
The kids all cheer and run out the door
Leaving the cafeteria absolutely empty
Except for Wendy
Hello
Wendy's hello echoes throughout the entire building
dapper   sits behind a news desk
All over America, kids are flocking to the  rated film, 'Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire'
Here with a special report, is a quadriplegic midget in a bikini

Hey kids, how would you like to see some magic tricks
The clown looks startled
Huh

And fuck your gay pants
to again find the midget reporter
He now has a graphic of a record chart next to him
/ And the devastating impact of the Canadian phenomenon is Terrance and Phillip's new hit song, "Shut Your Fucking Face, Unclefucka" which has climbed the charts with a bullet -- We see a clip from the video, "Unclefucka
" The video has Terrance and Phillip dressed like Mase and Puffy in that video they did in Vegas
They wear shiny bright jumpsuits and lunge at the fish-eye lens of the camera
& (Singing) Shut your fucking face
Unclefucka
- The news anchor shakes his head in disgust
Thanks, midget
Shocking report
The controversy surrounding the Terrance and Phillip movie began in the small mountain town of South Park, Colorado where the local  banned the movie
With us tonight is the head of the South Park , Sheila Brofloski- screen appears with Kyle's mother, looking very pissed
The below her reads 'Outraged Mother'
Ms
Brovlofski, how are these kids seeing this film
Is bad parenting to blame
Or is it Canada
' Canada
Alright
Here with a counterpoint is the Canadian Minister of Movies
split screen appears, Kyle's mother on one side, and a goofy looking Canadian slides into the other
Thank you, Minister, for joining us
Thanks for having me, buddy
Minister, parents all over America are concerned about your country's entertainment
Your thoughts
Well, the film is  rated, and it's not intended for children- ' Oh but   children are going to see it
Uh, can  finish
Can  finish
The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage- ' '
Can  finish
Hello
Can  finish
The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show
And car crashes caught on tape
We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much
' '
Can  finish
Please
Can  finish
Uh
Okay, 'm finished
But minister, it isn't like this film is the first troublesome thing to come out of Canada
Let us not forget Brian Adams a few decades ago
The Minister thinks
What
' The Canadians are just mad that we mothers here in South Park have the chutzpah to stand up to them
Like it or not, Mr
Canadian Minister,  children are now safe from your Canadian smut
- The boys are in the front row, this time with Wendy, watching the Terrance and Phillip movie
Well, Terrance  hope you learned something from this whole experience
did, Terrance,  learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face
The boys laugh merrily
Wendy just looks bored
Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights
You bet, Terrance
Terrance pulls out a match, lights it, then farts
The flame burns Terrance to a blackened mass
You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart
(Just a skull) sure did, Phillip
The boys laugh hysterically
Did you see that, Wendy
Yup
- The boys walk out happily
Man, that movie gets better every time see it
Yeah, but you know what
That whole part about lighting farts is bullshit
You can't do that
Mph rmpmh rm
No way
Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy
Stan
think you and  need some time apart
Oh shit
It's just
It's obvious that we don't have a whole lot in common anymore need somebody who's
a little deeper
But Wendy,  can go- Wendy places her little gloved hand over Stan's mouth
No
Don't speak
You'll only make things more annoying
Goodbye, Stan
And just like that, Wendy is gone
Stan looks almost ready to cry
Kyle walks up behind Stan
Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways
(Insincere) Yeah
The boys walk off
Mph rmph rm
No you can't Kenny
Mph rm rmph
Okay Kenny, 'll bet you a you can't light a fart on fire
Mph mm
Kenny pulls out a book of matches
He strikes a match and holds it under his ass
After a few seconds Kenny farts, and there is a little flame
Suddenly, the flames catch and Kenny starts burning alive
Kenny runs around, and finally falls to the ground, still burning
Cartman looks shocked
Wow,  guess you  do that
- and  are pushing Kenny into the operating room style
Everything is quick and chaotic
Shouts fill the hallway
chem kit
70CCS It's mid-operation
Siphon the fluid off his brain
Vacuum
Another nurse hands him a sucker tube
He immediately shoves into Kenny's skull
It starts to slurp and burble
Try to untangle his trachea and esophagus
Right
While Doctor Gauche wrestles with Kenny's lungs and torso, the nurse reaches into Kenny's mouth and pulls both his windpipe and esophagus out of his mouth, turning them inside out in the process
Off to the side, Stan, Cartman and Kyle look on as the doctor and nurses tangle themselves in knots with Kenny's innards
No
'
Watch his liver
Kenny's liver  out of his torso and slides across the floor
'll get it
We have precious little time left people
We're going to lose him soon
Suddenly, there is a long,
Doctor, his heart's stopped
Crack him
Let's get it out of there
Doctor Gauche lifts Kenny's heart out of his body
We need to zap this, quick
And runs it to the microwave
He opens the door
Who's making a potato
2 My bad, sir
missed lunch
Damn it
am  going to lose this kid
- Fade up from black
We're close on Kenny's face
His little eyes start to open
Doctor Gauche leans over him Kenny
Stan and Kyle are there
Kenny
Kenny, can you hear me
Kenny stirs
(Weakly) Mph rmph rm
How are you feeling, son
mph
rmph
Great
Son,  have some bad news
We accidentally replaced your heart with a baked potato
You have about seven seconds to live
Mrm
Just then, Kenny's baked potato heart explodes, splattering gore all over the inside of the recovery room and on the outside of Dr
Gauche, Stan and Kyle
Oh my God
killed Kenny
You bastards
Damn it
It never gets any easier
Anybody get the score of that Broncos game
- Kyle's mother is waiting with the rest of the parents
The nurse walks up to Kenny's parents with a sad expression
'm sorry
Kenny's mother breaks down
' Oh my God, they killed Kenny
' You bastards
' knew this would happen
Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child
Can't people see the damage that film is doing
' He was killed doing something he saw in the movie
It was Terrance and Phillip
killed Kenny
' You bastards
' This is it
The time for action is
(Singing) Something must be done
This is like a spreading rash
They're pulling out our children's brains and filling them with trash
Can't you see what this is leading to
world of smut and sex and poo
believe the good fight has begun
Something must be done
Everyone gathers around Kyle's mother
' agree
(Singing) Something must be done
We must take action fast
My child used to say 'please and thank you' Now he says suck my ass
' And my boy was the sweetest boy the world had ever known
until those damn Canadians brought that filth into our home
agree that there is now a battle to be won
We can't just stand here singing
Something must be done
' But what are we going to do against the media machine
It's so big and powerful
' Right
And we can use that same media machine to exploit  cause
We've got to let the whole world know what the Canadians did to your son
Yeah
' The parents all head out the door- - The doors to the hospital swing open, and the parents march out into the street, singing in unison as they go
(Singing) Something must be done
Something's gotta give
This world has become a bitch in which we have no desire to live
Cars come screeching to a halt as the parents sing in the middle of the road
People start honking their horns in frustration
' My boy could have become a doctor Or a lawyer rich and true Instead he burned up like a piggy on a bar-b-que
' We will fight for children's rights in memory of your son
We can't just stand here singing
Something must be done
Cars are now smashing into each other, and flying off the road to people's deaths, as the music number has taken over the busy intersection
We've pushed and pushed it to the edge And now the time has come
Something's gotta change
It's time to buy a gun
We can't just stand here singing No we can't just stand here singing No we can't just stand here singing
Something must be done
few more cars careen off and explode into flames as if ending the song with a borage of fireworks
- The boys gather around Kenny's lifeless body
(Dazed) bet him he couldn't do it
bet him a hundred dollars
Come on, Cartman
It's not your fault
No,  know
'm just fucking don't have to pay him
Oh
The boys walk out, leaving Kenny's corpse behind
We can still hear the boys voices as they exit
(
) can't believe he's dead
(
) Yeah, 'm having total deja vu right now
Like this has all happened before
After they leave,   to Kenny's dead body, which is left all alone on the operating table
The camera continues to zoom in to Kenny's face
on Kenny's dead face
We pass into his thoughs
- Kenny's body is floating through a great void plays as he soars upwards to the heavens
*note - except for Kenny's little construction paper body, this entire sequence should be done in 3D
Ahead of him, Kenny can see a great white light
It appears warm and inviting
Now Kenny notices large beautiful breasts bobbing up and down in the heavens
He reaches out to touch them
Kenny blissfully floats upward toward the bright light and bobbing breasts
The music crescendos as Kenny gets almost close enough to the light to touch it
Just then, a huge, electronic sign pops up
'Access Denied'
Suddenly, Kenny goes spiraling downward
The song changes to a  type number as Kenny's surroundings start to become darker and more twisted
Kenny's hapless spirit enters a horrifying red tunnel, filled with flames and heat
Mph rmph rm
Burning souls  and  all around Kenny, as his body plunges into what is now obviously the depths of hell
Kenny passes images of Hitler, John Wayne Gacy, hunger and disease as he continues through the twisting tunnel
He then passes images of Jimmy Stewart and Gandhi
All of whom are opportunely locked in hell for all eternity
- The same ticket guy from before is at the ticket booth
The marquee still reads 'Terrance and Phillip' but a huge sticker has been placed over it that reads 'banned'
The boys stand underneath the marquee looking baffled
How can they do this
It isn't fair
Well, Terrance and Phillip are on Conan 'Brian tonight, we could at least go watch that
The boys hang their heads and walks away
The ticket guy suddenly hears a bunch of commotion
He sees a mob of angry mothers, led by Kyle's mother
' must be him, officer
This is the scum that sold  rated tickets to children
What
Jesus Christ,  didn't mean to
Barbrady slaps handcuffs on the freaked out teen
You can explain downtown
(Getting dragged away) Oh shit
Hey it's not  fault
You should arrest those pervert Canadians
' Oh we will, Mr
Scumbag
We will
'  - Establishing
'  - The boys are sitting on Cartman's couch watching
-  -   ' Conan comes back from a commercial break
Sitting next to him, is Ms
Brooke Shields
' Our next guests have the number one movie in the world right now, please welcome Terrance and Phillip
few cheers as Terrance and Phillip walk out on stage
few boos as well, and we see that the South Park mothers are in the audience holding 'Anti-Terrance and Phillip' signs
Terrance and Phillip walk out and sit next to Brooke Shields
Hello, Conan
Hello, Brooke Shields
It's nice to have you here in America
Yeah, well, you being a Canadian and all, we thought what the hell
' So guys
understand you have a comedy routine worked out for us
We sure do, Conan
And here it is
Excuse me, Terrance
Yes, Phillip
Phillip rips a fart that launches Terrance backwards and into the band
They both laugh wildly
Gotcha
Terrance and Phillip laugh
Nobody in the audience laughs
- They laugh merrily
-   ' Good one, Phillip
Cheers
Cheers, Terrance
Terrance extricates himself from the band
Conan is growing nervous
He looks out into the audience
Kyle's mother is sitting there, looking angry
Conan makes eye contact with her, and then nods his head
Kyle's mother nods back
' (Nervous) So, guys,  need to ask you a serious question
just farted Terrance back into the stone age
They both laugh hard
Brooke Shields waits a beat, then belts out a fake laugh
farted once on the set of Blue Lagoon
Nobody cares, Brooke Shields
' Terrance and Phillip
Whose idea was it, to have a person lighting a fart on fire in your movie
Who is responsible for that
Terrance and Phillip exhange glances
Phillip,  think our friend Conan has been working too hard
' Say it
It was  idea to have someone light a fart on fire in your movie
/ (Together) It was our idea to have someone light a fart on fire in your movie
Kyle's mother is among them, listening to all this
' (Into her lapel) That's it
Move, move, move
battalion of Army guys appear, seize Terrance and Phillip and arrest everyone in their group
' Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents
- Dude, what the hell is going on
-   ' Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan 'Brian Show
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us
(Pointing to Conan) You are a bad man
And you call yourself a Canadian
(To Phillip) told you we should of done Leno
Conan 'Brian turns away, ashamed
' Don't listen to them, Mr
'Brian
They're master manipulators
You did a good job
You loved our movie, Conan
We watched it together
You
You laughed
Conan grabs his head
' What have  done
Conan grabs a gun and blows his head off, dousing Brooke Shields with blood
Mondays at eight Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily
Kyle's mother cradles Conan's lifeless body
' You see what your filth has caused
This is your mess, outraged mother
'  - The boys are sitting on the couch in absolute shock
Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip
Our moms suck
This could mean
No more Terrance and Phillip -
- Establishing shot
- Lots of foreigners with their silly foreign outfits sit at their stupid microphones with their ridiculous translation headsets -- in the general assembly hall
The Canadian Ambassador stands before them
As The Canadian Ambassador,  hereby condemn the actions taken by America in apprehending Terrance and Phillip
goes through the crowd
We demand their release
As you can see from this graph, the entire economy of Canada relies on Terrance and Phillip
Without them we are doomed to recession
The United Nations head bangs his gavel
Now Kyle's mother stands up
She is with a group of mothers all wearing
-shirts
' If  may
Everyone looks at Kyle's mother
' As president and founder of
, would like to state- Excuse me,
' Yes, Mothers Against Canada
Kay
' would like to state that Canada must learn to stop infiltrating our country with its graphic art
Cheers from the Americans
Last time  checked America was a free country
' Look at this
Kyle's mother pulls Kenny's mother up by the head
' This woman's child was  by your country's humor
Look how upset she is
Kenny's mom looks fine
We will continue to sell Terrance and Phillip videos to anyone retarded enough to buy it
' Then you leave me no choice
call for an  on  Canadian Imports
More cheers from the Americans
The Canadians look worried
- The boys are in the check out line at Bob's supermarket
What the hell do you mean  can't get Cheesy Poofs
Sorry, kid
Cheesy Poofs are a Canadian export
We can't carry them any more
Who the hell made up that law
You can't do this
Have you ever Cheesy Poofs
They're a taste sensation with a delightful cheddar crunch
There's nothing  can do
can still sell you Cheese-o's
Cheese-os and  you
Cartman storms out
The boys follow him
'  - The boys walk into Cartman's house
Cartman slams the door behind him
The boys all walk toward the living room
Come on, you guys
We have to
About what
About Cheesy Poofs, dumbass
This whole thing has gone too far
don't really think you need Cheesy- Poofs, tubby- But the boys come to an abrupt halt when they reach the living room and see that all four mothers are waiting for them, silently
Everyone just sits there for a second
The lighting on Kyle's mother's face looks almost evil
' Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion
We already know what you did
We saw it on television
Yeah, how come you arrested Terrance and Phillip
' Stanly, you're too young to understand what's good for you
That's why we mothers have taken charge
But they fucking didn't do anything wrong
Yeah
And what rim job expert went and outlawed Cheesy Poofs
The mothers all gasp in horror
' What was that word, young man
' Oh, he said rim job
It's when someone licks your ass for- ' know what it is
(To his mother) Lick someone's ass
' The Terrance and Phillip movie has obviously done irreparable damage to their brains
We have to put them in rehab right away
What's that
' You boys need help
There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language
' There are
Kyle's mother thinks for a second
' Well no,  guess not
But we will establish the first of its kind right here in South Park
All the children in town will have to attend and receive treatment from the school counselor Mr
Mackey
Ooh  just love when  get these sorts of ideas
Why
So you can fuck up our life some more
' Eric
Don't talk to Ms
Brovlofski that way
But mom
'm not fucking addicted to fucking bad language
don't have a fucking problem
- Kenny walks through the black void of hell
trippy, single shaft of light seems to follow him wherever he goes
Mphrmo
No answer
No nothing
Kenny continues on, flames shoot up randomly from the ground scaring the shit out of him
Suddenly, Kenny hears a
It gets louder and louder
Kenny starts to run faster and faster
Now the clawing is
Kenny spins around
He is face to face with
Satan looks down at Kenny and shoots flames out his nose
Kenny's eyes bulge open
Fallen one
We have such sights to show you
Kenny shakes
Satan turns to a whispy form and flashes across the room like a serpent, in a millisecond he is right up in Kenny's face
am Satan
am your God, now
Kenny tries to run away, but Satan again changes form, flies across the room and cuts Kenny off
Come with me
will show you what delightful pain awaits
Two black  grab Kenny by the arms and start to lead him away
Just then,   show up next to Satan
Oh, a new recruit, huh
Welcome to hell, kid
Relax
Take a load off
You remember
Saddam Hussein, don't you
Kenny's eyes grow wide
- Establishing shot of the small Betty Fordesque building
-  ' The kids are sitting in chairs in a circle
There are anti- drug signs on the walls: "Crack is Whack"; "Get High on Pottery"; and, " Go From Zero to Bitch in
9 Seconds
"
, the wiry school counselor, leads the group
There's a pottery wheel and lots of craft tables behind them
Mkay, it's come to my attention, that you boys have a potty-mouth problem, mkay
Now the sooner you recognize your problem, mkay, the sooner we can get you back to your third grade homeroom where you belong
But they're just words, Mr
Mackey
Our parents are over-reacting
Yeah, Wendy's here, and she doesn't even like Terrance and Phillip
Wendy looks bored
Stan tries to smile at her, but she doesn't even acknowledge him
Meanwhile, Cartman is violently shaking in his seat
Ugh
You guys, seriously
'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal
Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem
Uh, young man
Let's start with you
He points at Gregory
The little British bastard from the lake
My name is Gregory
And  have a potty mouth
Wendy looks at Gregory
Stan notices this
You've got a stupid accent too
Eric, that is not appropriate
What
Fuck French people
Fuck 'em in the ear
Mkay, you see, children
This is exactly what 'm talking about
We have to change the way you think
How are you gonna do that
Mr
Mackey crosses to a piano
He plays chords while speaking the following lines
There are times when you get suckered in, by drugs and alcohol and sex with wom-en
But it's when you do these things too much (Singing) That you've got to clear your head and get back in touch
Mr
Mackey plays the piano and sings: You can do it, it's all up to you, mkay
With a method, there's nothing you can't do, mkay
You don't have to spend your life addicted to crack Homeless on the streets giving hand- jobs for cash as long as you follow this simple plan 'm fully convinced that it's, easy, mkay
The kids are extremely disinterested
Mackey walks over to a chalkboard
Step one: Think about fun
Think about all that you'll miss addicted to this Step two: Think it all through
Think how's this gonna change my life, what am  gonna miss
Step three: Go and hug a tree, Hug anything that gets in your way
And step four: Just don't do it anymore - it's easy, Mkay
Mackey gets the children in a circle all holding hands
Come on, kids
Sing along
(Extremely half-assed) You can do it, it's all up to you mkay
With a method, there's nothing you can't do, mkay
We don't have to spend our lives addicted to crack Homeless on the streets giving hand- jobs for cash As long as you follow my simple plan 'm fully convinced that it's, easy, mkay
Everyone starts dancing in a circle
Step one: Think about fun
Think about all that you'll miss addicted to this Step two: Think it all through
Think how's this gonna change my life, what am  gonna miss
Step three: Go and hug a tree, Hug anything that gets in your way
And step four: Just don't do it anymore - it's easy, Mkay
It's easy, Mkay
Everyone falls down laughing
- Kyle's mom and the other moms watch the kids and Mr
Mackey rolling around on the floor laughing on a security monitor
' What the hell do they think this is
Summer camp
-  ' Just then, Kyle's mother walks in with a scowling look, interupting the kids and Mr
Mackey who are still laughing merrily
The other mothers are behind her
' Mr
Mackey, what is going on
Mr
Mackey stands up, looking scared
Uh, we're just, starting our program
' This is  a place for fun and games
This is rehabilitation
Now
We at  have a trial to go to
The mothers walk away
Mkay
God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle
Kyle hangs his head
- news reporter stands in front of the Supreme Court
All around him are protestors, with signs that say
and '
Still others hold signs with Kenny on them
Tom 'm standing in front of the
Supreme Court where the most important trial of the - day - is happening
Thousands of people have shown up from all over the country to show their outrage and disgust at Canada
Joining me now is Mrs
McKormick, mother of the poor little boy who was killed by the Canadians
Kenny's mother steps into frame
She is wearing a shirt with Kenny's picture on it
Written on the -shirt is 'Have you seen my son
No, you haven't
He's dead
' Mrs
McKormick, you must really hate the Canadians
' Yes, yes  do, Tom
Did you ever think you would see the day when thousands of people were wearing your son Kenny on -shirts
' No  didn't
But if any of you would like one they're 14
95
Available in blue or white
The reporter thinks for a second, and then turns back to the camera
Well, we can only imagine the intense, vehement trial that is going on inside
- Terrance and Phillip are on the stand
Terrance and Phillip
You knowingly, with malice of forethought were trying to destroy American culture, yes or no
Terrance rips a fart
-  ' The kids are all in the main room, sitting on a couch, huddled around a television
They laugh merrily
Shh
Mr
Mackey's gonna hear us
- The Americans are just showing their as smelly bastards
Fight the power
The young boy that died lit himself on fire
It was unfortunate, but how can they blame
Don't believe the hype
Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily
-  ' The kids all shout agreement
(Adlib) Yeah
WooHoo
Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily
You cannot oppress us
We will continue to pursue our art
We know there are Americans out there who will help us
Kyle's mother now stands up from the prosecutor's table
' Your '' is shallow and immature
We Americans do  allow that for our children
Please
You teach your children that America is the land of the free
But it's all bullshit
You're one of the most conservative countries in the world
-  ' The children all listen, wide-eyed
- The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves
You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it
Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up
' government censors from the world
' '
' , - Suddenly, the screen goes blank
sign that says ' ' comes on
-  ' The kids all watch, wide-eyed
What happened
The station  went blank
- The Canadian Prime Minister stands directly in front of camera, looking right at us
You have taken our national treasure Terrance and Phillip
We, in turn, have taken yours
The Smothers Brothers
The Canadian Prime Minister steps out of the way, revealing the Smothers Brothers tied up in chairs behind him
'll let you catch your breath
Now, release Terrance and Phillip, or else we will  your beloved Smothers Brothers
Please listen to them
They're not fucking around
We're not fucking around
This is not aboot deals
This aboot dignity
This is aboot freedom
This is aboot respect
Terrance and Phillip
Another Canadian leans in and whispers in the Prime Minister's ear
Oh yeah
,
He raises his middle finger, but it's all blurred and digitized
-  ' Okay kids, for today's rehabilitation activity, we're going to watch the Terrance and Phillip movie
What
Sweet
Now, this is an  version of the movie, which was put out by the
That's the Motion Picture Association of America
Isn't that censorship
No the  is  a censorship group
Why not
Uh
Because they say so
Mkay
Now want you to watch this movie, with all the immature profanity taken out, and notice how much better a movie it becomes
Mackey puts the tape in and hits play
The  come up 'Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire' Except that 'Asses' has been blurred out, and replaced with 'bunz'
The movie begins
Phillip walks in
But it isn't Phillip's voice, somebody has dubbed him over
Hey Terrance
feel like 'm going to pass gas near your head
would rather you didn't, Phillip
Oh
Is that so
Phillip farts on Terrance
Oh, you are such a maroon
You would know, dummy
The boys look confused
You are pigeon-like in your intelligence
The pseudo-Terrance and Phillip laugh
Terrance throws a match on Phillip and Phillip burns to death
comes up -
And the credits roll
Dude, they cut out 92 minutes
The lights in the theater come up
So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact
And of course, the  didn't cut out any of the graphic violence
What did you think
Oh man, 'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie
Eric, you're not watching your mouth
You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and 'll watch my fucking mouth
Eric
You need to be rehabilitated
Help me to help you
Help yourself prickfuck
am not a prickfuck, mkay
You little asshole
Mackey slaps his hand over his mouth and looks around, scared
Ha, ha, you stupid asshole prickfuck
- Mr
Mackey is in a private office with the members of
' How is the children's progress
Very encouraging
Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths
' What do you mean , why not
(Nervous) Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs
' Then we'll have to resort to plan  and call the v-chip organization
Dramatic
Mackey looks afraid
Mrs
Brovlofski, the -chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous
' (Evil) don't care if it's dangerous
Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr
Mackey
Perhaps  need to remind you of your situation
(Nervous) Alright, 'll make the call
-  ' The kids are again glued to the  watching the trial of Terrance and Phillip
- Back in the courthouse, the jury walks in and sits down

The crowd goes wild
The mothers of

The judge bangs her gavel
Terrance and Phillip, for crimes against the great nation of America you are hereby sentenced to
You gotta be shittin' me
Aghgh
Phillip passes out
-  ' The kids can't believe what they're seeing
Everyone is silent
Finally, Kyle perks up
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip
How do we do that
Kyle thinks for a moment
You raise awareness by distributing buttons, stickers and leaflets
That'd be sweet
We could try to bring back Cheesy Poofs
Yeah, let's make Free Terrance and Phillip buttons
You guys don't even care
All you care about is seeing Terrance and Phillip fart on each other more
The boys sit there and blink
Yeah
This is about freedom of speech, Stan, about censorship
The handsome English kid, Gregory chimes in
Yes, what's next
Barcodes on our forearms
This country is the most fascist of all
Wendy looks at Gregory deeply
Gregory smiles at her
What the hell are you talking about, kid
You don't get it Stan
You just don't get it
Wendy walks away
What
What don't  get
(To Kyle) What don't  get
don't know, dude
That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me
thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude
She's Not
But if she  it would be little asshole who's fucking it up for me

Mkay, children, you've all made terrific progress, and are hereby done with the eight step program
The kids all   relief

Yeah
Well, boys, it might interest you to know that your  the Canadians have just bombed the
They did
Yes, at six this morning they bombed the heck out of Cleveland
Oh

They only bombed Cleveland because we're going to Execute two of their citizens
Wendy, Mkay, if you want to start getting political, 'll throw your skinny little butt right back into rehab
Mkay
No, Eric
'm afraid it's phase two for you

- large crowd of parents has gathered for a  meeting
Kenny's mother is at a table selling dead Kenny t-shirts
She has a shitload of money all around her
Another  walks up, hands Kenny's mom money, and gets a shirt
Is that a new pearl bracelet, Mrs
McKormick
' Why yes
Yes it is
Meanwhile, Kyle's mother is on the stand
' As our next official order of business here at
, we will test the new - chip
As most of you know, the -chip was created to lock children out of watching certain shows on television
And now the has created a new, exciting product that they can tell us all about
Here is the Surgeon General, Dr
Pangloss
, a lab technician in white takes the podium
Thank you, parents
One person claps
Pangloss hits a button and a slide projector starts showing pictures of the device
The machinery of the new '-chip' is very simple, and similar to that of the - chip
The chip is placed just under the subject's skin, where it emits a small but painful shock of electricity whenever an obscenity is uttered
The parents are fascinated
' Now wait a minute, are you telling us that this chip somehow  if the kid is swearing
It's just like a lie detector
Certain things happen in you when you swear just like when you lie, the chip picks up on this and gives the subject a shock
The parents   'Ooohs' and 'Ahhhhs' We are very excited to see the results of this test
(Calling) Patient 453, would you step out here, please
Cartman steps out wearing a hospital gown
Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip
My head hurts
Don't worry about that
Now,  want you to say 'Doggy
' Doggy
Notice that nothing happens
(To Cartman) Now say 'Montana
' Montana
Good
Now 'Pillow'
Pillow
Alright, now  want you to say 'horsefucker
' Cartman looks offstage to his mother
' Go ahead, it's alright, Eric
Cartman smiles
Horsefuck- Cartman falls to the floor in pain
All the parents ooh and ahh and applaud
That   - '
' -- Success
Our device works perfectly
We will begin mass production immediately
' And so we have succesfully removed the Canadian smut from all of our children's brains
We have made changes at school to ensure that our kids are   exposed to smut
It's
The crowd goes wild
- School is now Naziesque
military drum echoes in the distance
-    - Stan and Kyle are sitting in their desks, waiting for school to begin
Wendy walks by on her way to her desk
Hi Wendy
(Not even looking) Hi Stan
Wendy walks on by
Wow, dude
Wendy could really give a rats ass about you
(Eyes still on Wendy) bet she would if my name was
Good thing she was never your girlfriend
Dude, here comes Cartman
Cartman walks in and gingerly sits down
Hey, Cartman, did they put that -chip in your head or your ass
What's the difference
Stan and Kyle laugh
Very funny dickhead- The v-chip shocks Cartman
- Cartman is thrown to the floor in a shivering heap
Whoa
What the hell was that
Dude
It's the -chip
It shocks him ever time he cusses
Stan and Kyle look at each other
Kyle smiles
Hey Cartman
What
You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are
Oh yeah
Well you're a monkey-shit- - - The cycle continues as Stan and Kyle laugh merrily watching Cartman flopping around on the floor
This is sweet
Totally
Garrison stands before his class
Okay, children, let's try a few new math problems
What is five times two
The kids all just sit there
Come on, children, do be shy, just give it your best shot
Clyde raises his hand
Yes, Clyde
Twelve
Okay, now let's try to get an answer from somebody who's not a complete retard
Anyone
Come on don't be shy
Just then, the door bursts open and in walks a couple of Nazi looking American soldiers
They walk over to the children and start pulling off their 'Free Terrance and Phillip' pins
Hey, what are you doing
You can't wear these in school
It's against school policy, thank you
Another solider rips off Kyle's pin and replaces it with a yellow star
What's that for
2 You get a star for doing well in school
Just as quickly, the soldiers make their way out the door
What's the matter, Wendy
Nothing, Stan
You wouldn't understand
(To Kyle) God damn it, why does she keep saying that
- The boys are in line
Nazi-ish soldiers usher them through
'm so sick of these soldiers
Yeah, they suck
know
Always saying, do this, do that
They think they're so cooool
(To the soldier) Acht lieben kraft auct shpiler
() The soldier glares at him
The boys walk into the kitchen, where they are greeted by their big, happy, black school Hello there, children
Hey, Chef
How would like some Salisbury Steak with buttered noodles
We can't, we're on a hunger strike
hunger strike
For what
To free Terrance and Phillip
But you guys
It's Salisbury steak
Chef, do you know anything about women
Ha
Is the Pope Catholic
don't know
Children,  know  there is to know about women
What's the secret to making a woman happy
(Dishing out food) Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris
Huh
Suddenly, Chef realizes who he's talking to
Oops,  guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh
No, what does that mean, find the clitoris
Is that like finding Jesus or something
Now Chef starts to panic
Uh
Nothing
Forget  said anything
Now move along, children
You're holding up the line
Just then, the
blares out an announcement
(
) Woa,  wonder what's going on, dude
- All the elementary students are gathered in front of a large television monitor
Mr
Garrison and his class walk in and look confused
The boys walk up to Chef
Please take your seats, everyone
They all go to their seats
What's going on, Chef
Something big, children
The television goes from that Emergency broadcast signal to a scene of a news anchor sitting at his desk
(Very serious) This is a State of Emergency
We go now to the White House for a from the President of the United States
- The President is sitting in a chair by the fireplace
Ladies and gentlemen
At five a
m
today, a day which will live in infamy
sort of
the
has declared war on Canada
- They all stare in silence
Mr
Garrison takes a deep breath
Oh, no
don't believe it
Holy crap- (
) Hey crap isn't a swear word, what the fuck
() All Canadians are to leave the country immediately, or be subject to military camps
All Canadian products are to be thrown out
How can they do this
never thought there would be war again in my lifetime
- Do not be afraid of this war
Instead embrace it
We have God on our side
And besides, they're just Canadians, what the hell are they gonna do
- Everyone watches the television in stunned silence
Chef, what does it mean that we're at war
It's
It's not good children
What do we do
Do we go on as normal or
don't know Principal Victoria don't know
And now,  would like to bring up the woman who led, and is still leading the way in this glorious stand- (Pointing to ) Kyle's mom appears on the  dressed in military garb
Mrs
Sheila Brovlofski
Isn't that your mother, Kyle
Kyle can't believe it
On the television, Kyle's mother walks up to the podium
She is dressed to the hilt
She hugs the President and the first lady and then takes a deep breath
' My fellow Americans
have led this fight in the War against profanity have founded Mothers Against Canada
Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time
As Commander in chief,  have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the -Canada border in anticipation of an attack
' What about air strikes
Huh
' We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers
It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil
Oh, uh
don't know if air strikes are necessary
' Not necessary
Mr
President, may remind you that our country's heart and soul are at stake, and our children's minds are the battlefield
The bastard Canadians want to fight us because we won't tolerate their potty mouths
Well, if it is war they want
huge eruption of cheers from the crowd in front of Kyle's mother
She is obviously floored by it
She can't help but smile
She actually holds her head up higher, and then raises her arms up in two peace signs, as the cheers get louder
The president forces a smile and actually applauds with the rest of the crowd
Back in the gymnasium, Kyle looks thoroughly embarrassed
Damn, your mom's a bitch, Kyle
Amen to that
- Kenny is sadly walking around hell
He walks up to another one of hell's prisoners
Mph rmph rm rmph rm
Snacky Smores
Why the hell would  have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores
Beat it, kid
Kenny moves along
He hears some voices coming from a door
Kenny opens the door and peeps inside- '  - ' Saddam and Satan are lying in bed
You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all
told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself
'm not cranky
And that futon was not too big to carry myself- Just then, Satan hears a reporter on
In war news, countries from Europe and Asia are joining sides in the Canadian- American War- -Listen butterbuns, let's make love and forget about the whole thing- The death count is already on its way to 10 million with no signs of slowing down
What started as a spat between the United States and Canada is quickly turning into World War - Kenny's eyes bulge, he wants to see more, but Satan clicks off the television and sits up in bed
It has come to be
The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh
The time of the prophecy is upon us
Oh  love when you get all biblical Satan
You know exactly how to turn my crank
No 'm being serious
Those Canadian entertainers are to be killed
It is the seventh sign
Satan walks over to large pedestal which holds an ancient tome
Satan turns the pages as he talks
Behold, the signs of my reign on earth are all falling into place
The fall of an empire- He points to an ancient-looking picture of the death of Ceasar
-The coming of a comet- He points to a picture of a comet passing by Earth
Jerry Springer's movie doing more than ten million box office- picture of Jerry Springer holding a bunch of money
And now
Satan points to an ancient drawing on the wall
It looks like Terrance and Phillip being stabbed in the head
The seventh sign
When the blood of these Canadians touches American soil
It will be my time to rise
music
Yeah
Man 'm getting so
Do you always think about sex
'm talking about some very important stuff here
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing
Is sex the only thing that matters to you
Saddam thinks for a second
love you
Satan sits with his arms crossed and a frown
You know  do
know
So what do you say we shut off that light and get close, huh
Satan reaches over and turns off the light
Everything goes pitch black
The light goes off of Kenny's face as well
beat
Then, a small moan from Satan
Yeah, you like that, don't you bitch
- Stan and Kyle are walking down South Park Avenue
Stan is reading out of a huge book
Does it say what the clitoris is
All it says is that it's above the vulva
But where the hell is the vulva
Isn't that in Arizona or something
Stan and Kyle walk into the middle of town, where a bonfire of Terrance and Phillip videos, posters, and Canadian items like syrup and hockey sticks are burning away
The soldiers throw Stan's book on top of the pile, and it starts to burn
Stan and Kyle walk up to where Cartman is standing
What is this
They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war
That book wasn't Canadian
Clyde, one of the kids from school, throws his Terrance and Phillip dolls into the burning mass
Kyle stops him on his way back
Dude, don't you like Terrance and Phillip anymore
Of course not
We're at war
My daddy says   Canadians now
More kids line up to burn their Terrance and Phillip stuff
Several random mothers from
are standing in front of the bonfire with anti-Canadian signs and -shirts
The boys' parents aren't around, but another  mother is leading the charge
'
townsperson throws Alanis Morisette albums into the fire
Another townsperson runs up and throws in a bag of Cheesy Poofs
, ,
Cartman falls to his knees and cries as the Cheesy Poofs burn away
This is all cause of your mom, Kyle
She's such a bitch- (
) mean - she's such a
meanie
And she's getting worse
Dude
Isn't that your brother
Kyle looks to where a group of big, mean   have encircled Ike
Why don't you go back to your own country,
2 Yeah, go eat some potatoes and ride donkeys
Eee todo ba
Kyle's eyes grow wide
He dashes over
Hey
Leave him alone
It's just a smelly Canadian
They're like rats
He's my brother
You don't look Canadian
He's adopted
Kyle picks his brother up and tries to protect him
Well you better get his beady eyed Canadian ass out of America before my daddy finds him
The boys watch in horror as the fifth graders run over and throw more Canadian items into the fire
It's only a matter of time before my mom has  burned too
What has the world come to
This is horrible
We're locked up, burning books, hating other people- -no Cheesy Poofs
-No Cheesy Poofs
What the hell is happening
begins
don't know
But it has gone far enough
'm sick of it
(Singing) Something must be done
Change has got to come around
They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground
Can't you see what this is leading to
world of chains and ties and glue
We have to fight before they've taken every one
Something must be done
agree
The only way to save our future is to unite and fight
(Singing) Something must be done
We must take action fast
My parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past
And my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me agree that there is now a battle to be won
Something must be done
But what are we going to do against this entire army
We've gotta get the word out
We'll get on my dad's computer and use the internet
Come on you guys
The boys proudly head down the street
Something must be done
Something's gotta give
This world has become a bitch in which we have no desire to live
(*note- cartman gets shocked again on 'bitch') We've pushed it to the edge And now the time has come
Something's gotta change
Something must be done
Something must be done
'  - ' ' Kyle is at the keyboard of his dad's computer
Stan and Cartman are waiting in the background
Okay
just need to find a few private message boards
Wait
Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'
Okay
Kyle types in the word and hits return
(Reading the screen) "Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris"
Wow
'll just try the first one
Kyle clicks the mouse
They wait for the screen to load
Finally, it does
Dude
It's a lady giving a blow job to a horse
Stan and Cartman rush over
Is it Cartman's mom
Very funny
Hey
It  Cartman's mom
Cartman looks at the screen
Oh, son of a bitch
(
) mean, son of a biscuit
Maybe ' who your father is, Cartman
Ike bounces in, happily
Ber dada
Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff
Papa mama simi
Ike bounces out
Come on, just get to the message board
'm trying,  can't find a Canadian server
've got to break into the main frame
Kyle furiously hits a bunch of keys
Damn it
They've got an access code
'll try to reroute the encryptions
Kyle furiously hits a bunch more keys
Dude, do you know what you're doing
No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works
Just then the screen pops up
Access Granted
Bingo
Okay, here we go
(Typing) Want to help Terrance and Phillip
Meet us for a meeting at Gladdy's barn tomorrow night
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch
We're not gonna have pie and punch
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch
(Typing) pie and punch
This is Top Secret
The password is
The boys all think
(Dramatically) La Resistance
Triumphant  cue
' The door to the attic pops open
Kyle shoves Ike up into the attic
You stay up here in the attic, Ike
Don't make any noises or nothing, okay
Uhh
Goodnight, Ike, we're all going to bed
The door closes and it is dark
Ike blinks
He looks out a small window, onto the street below
few armed soldiers walk by
Ike pulls out a little plastic harmonica and sadly starts to play
- Tons of   are running to and fro
Giant computer screens show Canada's latest attacks
Sir
The Canadians have destroyed Des Moines
How can you tell
Everyone laughs merrily
Good one, sir
Suddenly, a   runs up to the President, holding some papers
Sir, we're tracking a signal crossing into Canadian computers
It looks like we may have a resistance movement starting
The President grabs the papers and dashes over to Kyle's mother, who is standing there looking smug, with her arms behind her back and her chest out
She has a few military badges on her
(Showing her the papers) Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance
It's probably Canadian spies
' Well find out where that signal is coming from
Then hunt them down like dogs
Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost
Yes ma'am
The President starts to run off
' And Bill
Yes
' 'm needing lunch
Right away, ma'am
The president runs off
'  - Establishing
(
) And so the draft will begin tomorrow, as more and more troops are needed to fight the Canadian forces
'  - Cartman's mother is tucking him into bed
(
) What is quickly being referred to as 'The Great Canadian-American War' has already reached a death toll of two million
Cartman's mother reaches over and switches off the radio
' Goodnight, honey
Mom
When is the war gonna be over
' don't know honey
Soon we hope
You want it to end quickly, huh
Oh,  don't care,  was just asking cuz all my favorite  shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off
' Oh
With that, Cartman's mother gets up- Mom
' Yes, hon
If you went down on a horse
You'd tell me, right
' Sure, hon
Goodnight
She switches off the light, and leaves
Cartman lies there, lit only by soft, blue moonlight and thinks
He hears a  noise, and looks a little scared, but then tries to close his eyes to sleep
Go away, scary noise
Again the
Cartman pops open hs eyes to see - He is transparent and floating above Cartman's bed
Cartman is horrified
Too much so to even scream
Kenny puts his hands to his mouth to try and speak, but he makes no sound
Finally, Cartman lets out a piercing cry
Cartman's mother comes running in, just as the image of Kenny disappears
' Eric
Eric, what is it
saw him
saw Kenny
Cartman's mother looks around and sees nothing
Finally, she just cradles Cartman's fat head in her arms
' Oh you poor dear
You've been through so much
bet him he couldn't set himself on fire and now he's all pissed off
(
) can't say pissed off
(
) -  () Kenny is again snooping around
He quietly creaks Satan's door open and walks in
Satan is in his room, looking at a map of Earth
The execution of Terrance and Phillip is imminent, soon all hell shall rise
Kenny looks scared
(Evil and scary) Are you afraid, little one
Afraid for the souls of your pitiful friends that- Suddenly, Saddam walks in carrying some bags
Hey Satan
got some great new home furnishings today
Satan rolls his eyes and sighs
His attempt to be evil to Kenny is squashed again
Boy buddy Rich, it was a bitch to get something to match with that bathroom tile
Saddam looks at Kenny
Oh, hey kid
Find those proofs of purchases yet
No
Gee, whatta surprise
Well, keep lookin
beat
Satan folds his arms and looks at the floor, pissed
Do you wanna know what did today
Saddam lets out a sigh
What did you do today Satan
You don't care
Hey fella
Relax
This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out
Let's make love
Do you remember when you first got here
We used to talk all night long
Until the sun came up
We would just lie in bed and
That's because  wanted to fuck you, dumbass
Now hows aboot you get those pants down
Don't call me dumb
mean cute dumb
Now bend over
As this conversation happens, Kenny's eyes dart back and forth as if watching a tennis match
How come you always want to make love to me from behind
Is it because you want to pretend 'm somebody else
Saddam sighs
Satan, your ass is gigantic and red, who am  gonna pretend you are
Helen Reddy
beat
Come on, kid
Help me with these shower curtains
Saddam and Kenny walk out
Leaving Satan all alone with sad music playing
(Gently) Sometimes  think When  look up real high That there's a whole world up there And just maybe it could be mine But then,  sink because it's here 'm supposed to stay but  don't even know how or why its supposed to be that way- Satan walks to his veranda
Up there, there is so much room Where babies burp and flowers bloom Everyone dreams  can dream too Up there, Up where The skies are ocean blue could be safe and live without a care
Up there Satan walks over to a bright blue globe and spins it slowly
They say  don't belong That my place is down below Because of my beliefs 'm supposed to stay where evil is sewn But what is evil anyway
Is there reason to the rhyme
Without evil there could be no good So it must be good to be evil sometimes Up there, there is so much room Where babies burp and flowers bloom
Everyone dreams  can dream too Up there, Up where The skies are ocean blue could be safe and life without a care
Up there , big crane shot rising above Satan
- dim light is all that is visible from inside the small building
- Stan and Kyle are painting a sign on the wall 'La Resistance'
Cartman comes running in, he looks scared
You're late, Cartman
had to ride my bike here
My behind is killing me
Your behind
have to say 'behind'
get shocked if say 'ass- () Did you bring the pie and punch
No you guys
Something happened
You guys wanna hear something creepy
(Looking over each shoulder) don't think Kenny is dead
What
saw him last night
know Cartman,  know
see Kenny every day
Sure, dude
On the face of every child, on the smile of every baby
Kyle and Stan laugh again
Hey
'm telling you this  Kenny think he's haunting me
The boys all look scared
Somebody's here
The boys walk over to the door, and open the sliding panel in front of their eyes
Who is it
Uhh
'm here for La Resistance
What's the password
Uhh
don't know
Guess
Uhh
Bacon
Okay
Kyle opens the door
The golden haired young boy from rehab stands there looking handsome and angelic
Viva la Resistance
Oh no, it's that kid
This is the place-- Another kid walks up next to Gregory, it's Wendy
Stan's eyes grow wide
Wendy
Stan
started La Resistance
Well, apparently you have a bigger heart than we thought
Let us get this meeting underway, there are others coming
Gregory takes Wendy's hand and pushes his way in
Stan fumes
- Now the room is filled with a bunch of scared looking All of whom are under the age of twelve
The room is lit only by candlelight
And the large ' ' banner hands on the wall
Stan and Kyle look nervous
Everyone be seated, please
The kids all sit down
Wow, a lot of people showed up
Yeah, so what do we say
thought you had something planned
Me
Stan looks out over the faces
Gregory checks his watch
(Nervous) Kay
Uh
Terrance and Phillip are supposed to be killed, and we think that sucks ass
The kids don't respond
Stan shoots a nervous look at Wendy, who is sitting next to Gregory
Uhh
So we think we should prank call a bunch of policemen
We can have pizzas sent to them that they didn't order Again no response
Gregory rolls his eyes
Uhh
Gregory stands up
May
What
Gregory takes Stan's place at the front of the group
Terrance and Phillip are currently being held at a Canadian Internment camp two kilometers outside of town
They are to be executed tomorrow during a star-studded  show for the troops
Gregory pulls a big map out of nowhere and rolls it out
Stan and Kyle can't believe it
We must sneak into the camp through this duct, freeing Terrance and Phillip inside
The war is escalating, and the American forces are preparing for a large scale attack on Canada
That means the time is now
Wow, dude, Wendy's new guy is smart
Stan shoots Kyle a dirty look
This is a dangerous mission, so 'll go myself
Wendy smiles at Gregory
No
Everyone looks at Stan
' going
started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip
We're going
This will be very dangerous
Are you quite sure
Fuck that
() We're going
Let's run through the plan
- huge hall is filled with hundreds of soldiers in different battalions
We see our regulars: Mr
Garrison with a uniformed Mr
Hat, Mr
Mackey, Jimbo and Ned, Bo, Pip, Stan's Grandfather, Jesus, Officer Barbrady
Oh, 'm so glad there's a war again was gettin' worried 'd never see another one
know what you mean
And they're giving all us troops a big tomorrow with celebrities and executions
to Mr
Garrison
You look great in your new uniform Mr
Hat
You do too, Mr
Garrison
Boy,  can't wait for our first shore- leave so  can go get me some poontang
Chef sits down in a seat behind Garrison near the back
, a gruff old army type with bug eyes, steps up to a podium and addresses the troops
The crowd settles down
It's no secret that the Evil Canadian Federation has scored major victories all over the United State
We have brought you here because you ar America's best, and last hope
Another general leans over to Plymkin and whispers in his ear
Oh
Apparently you're not the best, you're simply the last
Anyway, let's strategize
Map
large, holographic 3- map of South Park springs up in front of him
He walks around it pointing out things with a laser-pointer
Our sources have told us that the Canadians might try to attach tomorrow's show and stop us from executing Terrance and Phillip
He points to a spot on the 3- map
Now each battalion has a specific code- name and mission
Battalion 5, raise your hands- Chef is in Battalion 5 and dutifully raises his hand
Then he looks around and notices to his surprise that everybody else in his section is also African American
You will be the all-important first defense wave, which we will call 'Operation Human Shield'
Hey, wait a minute
Now keep in mind, 'Operation Human Shield' will suffer heavy losses
But don't lose your spirit men
Stay until the bitter end
Battalion 14
bunch of white guys raise their hands
Right, you are 'Operation Get Behind The Darkies'
You will follow Battalion 5 here- He points to a spot on the 3- map
-and try not to get killed for God's Sake
Are there any questions men
Chef raises his hand
Yes soldier
Have you ever heard of the Emancipation Proclamation
don't listen to hip-hop
Chef scowls
If you somehow live, we will regroup on this hill outside-- Suddenly, the 3- hologram starts to flicker and fizzle
Now what's wrong with this thing
General Plymkin messes with the controls
Fucking windows 98
General Plymkin has pulled the plug
He stands there with the cord in his hands
walks in, escorted by two
98 It is faster, over five million-- Plymkin pulls out a gun and shoots him in the head
Gates falls to the floor, dead
Alright men, get lots of rest, and prepare thyselves for battle
- In the dead of night, the kids are all in a circle discussing the plan
after you clear this zone here, rendezvous behind this ridge where Terrance and Phillip should be held
Gotcha
You are indeed brave, but you will need someone who's done this sort of thing before
Suddenly, a bump in the ground starts to move forward, leaving a trail behind it
(like bugs bunny before he pops out) The bump comes to a stop at the children's feet and out pops He is a very bitter little nine year old French kid with a  French accent
Oui
Thank you for coming, Mole
So
We must free more Canadian prizoners
Yeah,  guess
America
She iz a beetch that sheets on her own children
Stan and Kyle look at each other confused
This is the Mole
He will accompany you to the prison where Terrance and Phillip are
He is an expert in covert operations and a lifelong fighter for freedom
Freedom
It's like cow's urine poured down your troat
You wonder 'Do  want this
' 'm thersty
But it's urine
Everyone stares at The Mole
Good luck Stan, 'll make sure Wendy is
kept safe
Stan gets pissed
Give me Terrance and Phillip or give me death
Now, Gregory breaks into song
His voice is absolutely gorgeous and deep
He puts his hand on Stan's shoulder
God has smiled upon you this day The fate of a nation in your hands
Stan and Kyle look at each other
They can't believe how good this guy's voice is
Wendy appears enthralled
As brothers and sisters we unite And behind you we shall fight
Until only the most righteous belief stands
The music builds
Gregory gets up on a soapbox
Do you see the distant flames
they bellow in the night Fight in all our names For what we know is right And if you all get shot and cannot carry on Though you die, La Resistance lives on
What
Shot
Kyle and the boys look a little worried, as other kids join in the song
You might get stabbed in the head by a dagger or a sword You might be burned to death or skinned alive or worse
But when they torture you You will not feel a need to run For though you die, La Resistance Lives on
Do you hear the beating drum
It is our hearts all joined to one It is the music of our souls knowing we have much to overcome
As    we- : - The  Mothers are on a stage, preparing two electric chairs
' Something must be done
Tomorrow it will be
We're going to execute this threat to our democracy
All the mothers join in as they decorate the chairs with American flags
Kenny's mother is counting money she has made from selling t-shirts
And after that our kids will be safe from all the Canadian scum
The time is now the time is here Tomorrow something will be done
The song still  as we : - Satan stands on his veranda
want to be part of that world
But if only  had the strength to go without
If only  had the strength to leave him behind
Get on with my life in that world
Start over as part of that world
: - The soldiers, including Garrison, Mackey, Ned and Jimbo are in their bunks
Tomorrow we face our destiny
Tomorrow we fight to keep our country free
Death to Canada
Death to them all
Like our forefathers we shall answer the call
to Chef's bunk where he is lying naked with a hot chick
As usual, Chef sings a song that has absolutely no relevance to what's going on
(Stroking woman's arm) Baby your thighs sparkle like diamonds Baby your butt is tender like the night can see by the look in your pants that you want to treat me right
'll whisper sweet nothings in your cleavage And you can kiss me gently with your tongue And 'll make love to you so deeply That you'll feel pressure clear up to your lungs
Meanwhile, the soldiers continue their song
Something must be done
Something's gotta give
Tomorrow we will be free or we will no longer live
: - Terrance and Phillip are chained to the wall in a dark, dirty prison cell
Two armed American soldiers are torturing Terrance and Phillip with hot irons, as Terrance and Phillip sing- & Shut your fucking face Unclefucka
You're an ass raping cock sucking Unclefucka
: - The kids are all gathered together, finishing their song
One kid grabs a large flag and starts swirling it around
Let it echo through the night
Let it reach the ears of everyone
Though we die La Resistance lives on
Though we die La Resistance lives onnnn
Ah-
All the South Park men are in the rank and file marching down the street
(Singing) don't know but 've been told- '   '
They pass Kyle's house
'  - Ike watches the soldiers march from his little attic window
(
) Canadian pussy is mighty cold
(
) Ike blinks
Does he understand them
he picks up a small book and starts to write in it
- Satan paces back and forth in hell
This is it
World War Three is at hand
The millennium nears
Satan crosses to one of his small demons
Prepare the minions for the rising of Gothos
The demon dashes off
This is so exciting
Let's fuck
Satan sighs and bows his head
This is the millennium, Saddam
This is Armageddon
There's more to life than sex
Hey, relax guy
Well  just want you to be impressed with what do want you to respect my
respect your mind
It turns me on
It makes me wanna fuck the shit out of you
Don't you see
(Singing) Hey guy, relax, put out You gotta put out for me
'm just a man with needs And right now  need your generosity
love your eyes, your nose and lips So drop those pants and do some dips Come on guy, you gotta relax relax, put out for me
Kenny looks confused
What if , don't wanna put out
That's all you ever say Relax put out 'm a living creature,  have feelings too,  don't need this abuse from you- Hey, guy, relax, put out
You gotta relax, shut your mouth- Baby 'd do anything for ya
Now don't make me smack you in the eye like last time- Kenny keeps watching as Saddam throws on a Shakey's hat and does a quick softshoe
Satan rolls his eyes
get what  want, and what  want is for youuuuu toooo put ooooout
Saddam finishes the song and Satanhangs his head
What if  just left
Where're you gonna go, bitch
Besides, you know that if you left me, 'd hunt you down and kill you, right
'm gonna go grab a drink
Saddam leaves
Satan looks about to cry, but then notices Kenny still standing there
What are you doing
Get on with your misery
Mph rmph rm rmph rm
Him
don't know
He can be nice
sometimes
Mph rmph rm rmph rm
What do you mean
could leave him if wanted to
Mph rm
Rmph rm rmph rm
Satan lowers his head
Slowly he starts to cry
Kenny walks over and pats him on the back
Tents and makeshift buildings are lined up against the mountains
Jeeps and Tanks buzz to and fro
There's a huge stage which is set up with thousands of seats
There's a giant banner reading "
" Loads of soldiers file into their seats
Alright you men
The  show is about to start
The military men go wild
Get ready for loads of entertainment and fabulous celebrities
To be followed immediately by the swift and nasty execution of Terrance and Elroy
The crowd goes crazy again
-     - Right out of Nazi Germany
Barbed wire, guards, the whole bit
They are on their backs, shimmying along the ground underneath the blanket of razor-wire that is set up around the camp
The Mole uses the bolt-cutters to cut the wire as he goes, clearing a path for Stan, Kyle and Cartman
Be careful not to touch this wire- wire catches on Cartman's arm and  against his face
- Stan shoves his hand over Cartman's mouth, leaving Cartman to cuss bloody murder into Stan's glove
Finally they clear the fence and lie down in view of the camp
It sounds like the  show has started
We have precious little time
Kyle looks at the horrible concentration camp
Oh my God
God
Let me tell you something about God
He is ze biggest bitch of zem all
Kyle looks at The Mole, oddly
How are we ever gonna find them
The Mole whips out some night vision goggles
The Mole inspects the camp
He sees a guard on a guard tower
Then he pans over to a bunch of Canadians standing in a line in rags
The Mole quickly clicks the magnification to high so we see the saddened faces of the Canadians
Do you see them
Do you see Terrance and Phillip
No
Zey must have zem inside
We will have to dig
That's gonna take a long time
Time
Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King
The boys think
- Helicopters zoom over the makeshift stage like the  show in Apocalypse Now
Groups of soldiers cheer as a helicopter approaches the landing platform and touches down
The  army men cheer
The mothers take the stage, and Kyle's mother speaks into the microphone
Behind her is a huge American flag
She is wearing an army helmet
This is right out of 'Patton'
' Ladies and gentlemen of the American war effort, we salute you
big cheer goes through the crowd
Kyle's mother feels the power, and lifts her head high
She starts to pace back and forth on the stage as she speaks, becoming more and more Pattonlike
' Tomorrow you will be risking your lives so that our children will have a better future
God bless you men
And God bless this filth free nation
Many of you will die
Die like blood bathed pigs
So tonight, we at  present a Now without further ado, give you
Out of the helicopter emerge a battalion of the best and brightest stars that the American show biz industry has to offer
' Pint size pixie and darling of the indie movie scene, Winona Ryder
She gestures grandly to the helicopter where Winona Ryder emerges and runs to center stage and waves to the audience
She looks like a strung out coke addict; because she is
Hi guys
'm
's Winona Ryder
One guy claps
want you all to know 'm super psyched to be here today
You guys rock
What you're doing for our country so sooo cool
It's so real
've been acting since  was twelve and  can't distinguish between make believe and real life
Winona falls down
But gets back up immediately
And then  confuse me real life with my big-screen one
And sure, people get hurt, and 'm sorry about that but Christ, look at me
It's not my fault that  can get any guy  want
And that's reality to me
But you guys
wow
mean, war, man
Fucking war
It doesn't get any more real--  Now, this one goes out to you
She cues the band which has been assembled from the same helicopter
Jazz music starts up
It's 'New York, New York'
The troops look confused
You know what 'm gonna do for you now, don't you
'New York, New York' continues to play
(Singing) The bells are ringin' For me and my gal
The birds are singin' For me and my gal
- - The mole is digging frantically while the boys follow on all fours
Cartman holds a flashlight
Dude, this is seriously lame
didn't know we were gonna get all dirty and stuff
Sheet
What is it
Bedrock
cannot dig any further in zis direction
We're going to die here like baby mice who have had no milk in days
Dry up into crunchy little pinkies
The boys stare
beat
Or, we can dig
The mole starts digging up towards the ground
Mole pops his head out of the ground
Immediately, a search light passes over the hole
Sheet
Mole ducks, just avoiding the light
Slowly, the boys' heads appear from the hole
The whole camp is in front of them
There is a barbedwire fence on one side (the side they just dug from) dozen armed guards with huge Dobermans patrol the grounds with Howitzers
It doesn't look good
Move
Move
One by one, The Mole, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman pop out of the ground, and run for a nearby building
Once at the building, they all duck to avoid the search lights
Okay
The Americans must be holding Terrance and Phillip in one of those bunkers
We will split up here
Let's synchronize watches
The others look at each other
We don't have watches
beat
You don't have watches
Dude, you didn't say anything about watches
What do you think this is kid

Huh

Dude, we don't have watches
Sheet

What's a butfor
For pooping, silly
beat
Then mole takes a long drag off his cigarette and slowly blows the smoke
Now listen carefully
Stan and Kyle, you stand watch here and await my return
If any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe
What's a dying giraffe sound like
(Putting his hands to his mouth) Gwpaapa
Gwpaapa
Kay
The Mole turns to Cartman
Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box
You must sneak over zere and shut it off before  return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and will be shot full of holes
Got it
Okay
You  shut off the power, this is do you understa- ' '
Cartman storms off
will tunnel my way into ze buildings, and find ze prisoners
The Mole starts to dig
Be careful, dude
Careful
Was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while  was still in ze womb
And with that, The Mole quickly starts to tunnel his way underground
Damn, dude, that kid is fucked up
- Back on stage at the  show
Winona Ryder is just finishing up her song
(Singing) It's a hell of a
And that's my New York Melodyyyyyy
The band finishes with a flourish
Winona takes a bow
One person in the entire audience claps
' Let's hear it again for the one and only Winona Ryder
The same guy claps again
We love you, Winona
Everybody else in the audience just stares at him
' Next up we have a special treat
Please welcome, direct from Vegas- '
The place goes wild as Big Gay Al walks out on stage
Winona fumes in the wings
This guy is the coolest
2 Totally man
The back curtain goes up to reveal a tropical jungle set complete with a waterfall, hippos, monkeys and hundreds of colorfully dressed dancers
How we all feeling tonight
Between the cheering, we hear a throng of "Happy
"
Now the place is rocking
Everybody loves Big Gay Al
Winona can't believe it
can't hear you
Happy
Friends, you know why 'm here
'm here to teach
The crowd cheers
'm here to say that we're all under God, and we should embrace, and accept our differences
The crowd cheers louder
And that means we should The entire place goes incredibly quiet
You can hear a pin drop
Silence
Deafening silence
'
Slow music swells in
Big Gay Al saunters around the stage and starts to sing
(Singing) Bombs are flying People are dying Children are crying Politicians are lying too Cancer is killing Texaco is spilling The whole world's gone to hell But how are you
Suddenly, Big Gay Al is wearing a big feathery outfit and all his dancers dash to his side
'm super
Thanks for asking
All things considered 'm doing super must say
Very peachee Nothing bugs me 'Cause everything is super when you're -don't you think  look cute in this hat
The crowd is absolutely confused
'm so sorry, Mr
Cripple But  just can't feel bad for you right now Because 'm feeling so insanely super That even seeing you in that chair can't bring me down
- Cartman is by himself, slowly moving from building to building
He is scared out of his mind
(Imitating the Mole) Shut of ze Power, Cartman
Zis is very important, Cartman
Stupid British piece of shi- (
) He approaches the electrical box
Just as he's about to open it, two armed   round the corner
Cartman gets scared and hides in the shadows
The soldiers continue walking
Dude, if  was gay, 'd be just like Big Gay
2 Me too
And pass a terrified Cartman
-   ' The boys are waiting, bored, for The Mole to return
don't think he's coming back, dude
Just then, we hear The Mole return from his hole
He is carrying the ticket guy from the movie theater
Oh thank you
Thank you for getting me out of there
They locked me up for selling movie tickets to minors
Is this one of zem
No
That's not Terrance or Phillip
Oh
Alright, back you go
The Mole takes the Ticket Guy back through the hole
No
Please
don't want to go back
The boys sit back down and wait again
/ - Meanwhile, Big Gay Al's song continues- 'm super
Thanks for asking
All things considered 'm doing better than okay
Feeling peaches nothing bugs me Everything is super when you're -don't you think  look cute in this hat and my little shoes and this matching tie that  got at Merv's
The chorus guys all pick Big Gay Al up and dance around with him on stage
He's super
Thanks for asking
All things considered he is better than okay
And it's peachee, nothing bugs him Everything is super when you're- Let's fight fight fight against Canada today
The song ends and everyone erupts into applause
- Satan is looking into a large, oracle-like ball
Saddam isn't around, but a few demons and Kenny are hanging out
The execution is going to happen any moment
We must prepare
The demons make excited noises
Mph rmph rm
Get everyone in hell ready
When the blood of Terrance and Phillip spills, the day is ours
Two of the demons head for Satan's room
No
Not Saddam
Don't wake him
Uh
'll tell him
Satan walks to the bedroom
- Cartman approaches the electrical box nervously -- looking all around for soldiers
He opens the door to the electrical box and sees a large switch labeled  and
He reaches to turn off the switch when he feels a tap on his shoulder
Cartman jumps
Agh
Then turns and karate-chops in one spastic flurry to see - Son of a gun
Kenny's ghost is again floating in front of Cartman
Kenny again struggles to speak
,
' Mph rmprmmh rm
don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny
Cartman runs off, leaving the power completely on
'  -  - Ike is still just sitting quietly in the dark attic
Suddenly, the attic door bursts open
Found one
Other soldiers file into the attic and grab Ike by the arms
Yep, that's a Canadian alright
Sibi mammama
The American Soldier picks up Ike
So, thought you could hide from us, did you
Take him away
The soldiers drag Ike down the stairs
2 Sir, look at this
(Holding up a book) He was writing some kind of diary
Diary
What does it say
2 (Reading) Cookie monster
Banana
Sweeping, moving
-   ' Kyle is patiently awaiting Mole's return
Damn it
Come on, Mole we're running out of time
Kyle spins around when he hears someone coming
But it's only Cartman
He's panting heavily
You guys
Seriously
You guys
What Cartman
Kenny
saw Kenny again
Oh, brother
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman
Cartman stops breathing heavily and thinks
Cartman
Whoops
Just then, all the alarms in the place go off
Oh shit
From the distance, the boys hear gunshots
Suddenly, the Mole pops out of the hole
The boys see that The Mole has been shot up badly
Ze alarms
Zey went off
Yeah
That was my bad, sorry
As  and   draw closer, The Mole lays down and begins to die in Kyle's arms
Please
Do not let ze resistance die
Gentle  begins
Now the light, she fades And darkness closes in But  will find strength will find pride within Because although  die Our freedom will be won Though  die Ze Resistance Lives on
The Music fades away, as the Mole coughs up some blood
It's so very cold
We can't leave without you
It's okay,  am done for
No,  mean  '    - we don't know where the hell we are
The Mole coughs up more blood
Where is your God when you need him
Where is your beautiful, merciful faggot now
The Mole dies
The boys look up to see three large  pointing guns at them
Stan makes a run for it
He dashes off at full speed
Run, Stan
One of the soldiers fires at him
But Stan disappears into the night
Forget him
The night will swallow him up
You are under arrest
Cuff 'em
What
So  must be the resistance the pentagon has been tracking
Oh, son of a bitch
- Kyle's mother, and the other mothers of , take the stage again
' And now, for our big finale, the Terrance and Phillip are wheeled out onto the stage
Oh, Phillip
This cannot be good
know, Terrance
This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time
From the other side, Kyle's mom appears with a couple of official looking military people
The crowd cheers
' It is my pleasure to present to you, The crowd cheers
' Strap them in
Terrance and Phillip are then greeted by the , donned in a black hood
The scary giant Executioner grabs Terrance and Phillip and puts them into electric chairs
' Today is a great day for democracy
The crowd cheers
The Executioner steps up to the throw switch
Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when  fell asleep in that disco
know, Terrance
know
- of a desolate, dark area
It has started to rain
Stan trudges through the wilderness looking tired and scared
Hello
Where the hell am
Is anybody here
few wolf  sound in the distance
Stan walks on
No answer
No answer
Stan stumbles a bit
Dude, weak
Can't go on
Dizzy
Stan falls to the ground
His face plops in the rainy mud and his head smacks against a rock
Stan is out cold
Just then, a strange sound emerges
It is like a pulsating Stan slowly awakes, picks up his head and shines his flashlight around
What is that
The sound gets louder
Stan shines his flashlight on something that is huge and throbbing
- Kyle's mother approaches Terrance and Phillip
' Gentlemen, do you have any last words
Last words
Let's see
How aboot " "
How's that for last words
Kyle's mom nods to the Executioner
General Plymkin walks out next to Kyle's mother
We have just captured some Canadian Sympathizers
The crowd cheers
Kyle's mother smiles
' We will execute them along with Terrance and Phillip for your viewing pleasure
Another cheer
The mothers are all very pleased
That is, until they see Kyle and Cartman brought out to the stage at gunpoint
' Kyle
' Eric
Hi, ma
We also have a Canadian  who was hiding out in South Park
Now Ike is brought out at gunpoint
' Ike
Kyle's mother rushes over to General Plymkin
' General
These are
They are Canadian sympathizers and they must be dealt with accordingly
' But they're
Cartman walks over to where Terrance and Phillip are strapped into their chairs
Dude
Terrance and Phillip
Wow
Can get your autographs
Sure, tubby, just as soon as we're killed
' We can't kill these kids
Listen mothers, ' the ones that started all this
Don't get all emotional ' But we're doing all this to help our children's futures
' Yes,  think shooting our children would adversely affect their futures
' No
The General is right
' Boobie
This is the only way you're ever going to learn
have an opportunity here to teach you about consequences
' Sheila, you're going to far
Those are children
' (To Kyle) am sorry young man, but  have had it up to here
She walks away
' , - Stan is still lying in mud, but now he lies before a , pulsating, organic looking thing that belongs in the -Files
It's the size of a small building
The massive thing starts to glow
Stan looks weak and afraid
Be not afraid
Stan trembles
(Weakly) What
Behold my glory
What
are you
am the clitoris
Stan's eyes grow wide
starts to swell up
The clitoris Stan, your friends need you
They are in trouble and you must help them
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me
There are more important matters right now
,
' , Dude, she's eight years old, just get her some ice cream or something
Of
Ice cream
Now go, your friends are in danger
The show is a mile east of here, just over that ridge
The clitoris has spoken
The clitoris fades, and just as it does, all the kids of La Resistance come running into frame
Wendy and Gregory are with them as well
Stan
Stan are you okay
Wendy
see you failed in your mission
Terrance and Phillip must be dead by now
Wendy bends down to pick up Stan
Come on Stan, we have to hurry
The Canadian forces are about to attack
Wendy pulls Stan up off the ground and slings his arm around her
- drummer plays as the execution begins
We begin with Terrance and Phillip
Throw the switch
The executioner throws the switch and Terrance and Phillip start to fry
Kyle, Cartman and Ike, in their chairs, look horrified
' Goodbye, bastards
Near death, Terrance cranks out a weak fart
Terrance and Phillip both laugh weakly but merrily
Take that, bitch
As Terrance and Phillip fry, they scream out: / Suddenly,
Bomb lands in the middle of the army
It explodes with incredible force, sending dead bodies in all directions
Canadian military planes zoom overhead
It's a full scale attack
From a   we see the soldiers all scatter like bugs in every direction
Another explosion
Everybody just starts screaming and shooting in every direction
Total and complete mayhem
One explosion knocks out the electricity, and Terrance and Phillip stop drying
The electricity runs along a wire, across the stage, and right up Cartman's leg
Cartman starts frying horribly
(Frying) What's going on Terrance
Canada is saving us
Finally, Cartman is blown clear of the electricity
Kyle picks him up and starts to run along with Ike
- ' Satan opens the door to find Saddam sleeping happily in his cozy bed
He is only wearing little black g-string panties
(Whispering) Have you finished
Now we see that Kenny is standing at the foot of the bed
He holds a gasoline can, and has just finished pouring the last drops underneath the bed
Mph mph
Then move out of the way
Kenny walks over next to Satan
Satan pulls out a book of matches
must be strong
must be strong
Satan tries to light the match
It won't light
Damn it
Finally, the match lights
Satan holds it up- Goodbye, Saddam
-and throws it onto the bed
Come on
Saddam burns to a crisp and Satan and Kenny run out
- People run screaming in all directions as a full scale attack has broken out
Gunfire, explosions and dead bodies fly all around
Ned
Behind you
Ned whips around and mows down a line of Canadians
But one Canadian makes it through, and sticks his bayonet through Ned's neck
Blood gushes from Ned's neck as he collapses
The boys runs as fast as they can amidst the explosions
(Zap) Now when the -chip shocks Cartman, we can actually see the blue current swirl around his body
-
General Plymkin has followed his men into the trench, where explosions and gunfire fly all around
He pulls out a walkie talkie as his men die all around him
" "    " "
They all fall in
phalanx of black men, Chef included in them, walk out in front of a bunch of white guys
, ,
Just then, over a ridge in front of them, a line of Canadian tanks appears
The tanks are lined up 3 deep
Behind them is a line of missile launchers
General Plymkin's jaw drops
Holy Mother of Johosephat
The black guys all look at each other nervously
The boys run through the chaos
Body parts and scrapnel fly here and there
bloody soldier suddenly stumbles and falls in front of the boys holding a massive head wound
Hey
It's Mr
Garrison
Garrison lies on the ground, coughing up blood
Children
Take Mr
Hat
Please
Get him out of here
Garrison takes Mr
Hat off his hand and gives it to Cartman
Just then, Garrison goes limp
Cartman looks at the Mr
Hat in his hand and scowls
The boys run from the battle
They pass the American troops, where all the black guys are standing in a human shield around the white guys
Alright, squad
The Canadian tanks take aim
The Canadian tanks fire
All the black guys suddenly jump out of the way, leaving the whites completely exposed
What the- The tank fire hits the army, blowing all the white soldiers to smithereens, including Ned and Jimbo
,
Operation Human Shield my
- From an   , we see all the forces on both sides exchange firepower
The Canadian National anthem can be heard in the distance
We see Mr
Mackey looking like a natural born killer
He shoots like a maniac into the Canadians
He wounds one and then marches over to the wriggling body with a knife
Die Canadian, mmkay
And he drives the knife into the Canadian's chest
But then, suddenly, another Canadian Soldier appears out of nowhere, and blows a hole through Mackey's chest
Mkay- Mackey falls to the ground, dead
Just then Big Gay Al runs through the frame, we  him as he skips his way around gunfire
Ooh
Goodness those bullets are going Another bullet zings by his head
Jumping Jesus, this is insane
bullet hits Big Gay Al square in the head
More bullets follow, tearing him to shreds
- This shot parodies one of the big shots from 'Saving Private Ryan'
Just complete overkill
Explosions, helicopters, gunfire and death
Kyle's mother, and the other mothers as well, stand on a ridge overlooking the horrific massacre
' My God
This is terrible
Kyle's mother holds out her -16
She is now completely insane
' This is what we wanted
We wanted our children to be brought up in a smut-free environment
' But we didn't want
just followed you 'cause  made a shitload of money selling Kenny t-shirts
' Oh Lord, what have we done
' Wake up, people
We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes
It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for
Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals
The other mothers look very confused
' Why does it matter
My plan is a perfect plan
Perfect
Perfect
Perfect
The other mothers walk away
' We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals
' We're going to find our boys
For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed
Kyle's mother turns back to the battle
More killing and explosions
' Killed
They should only be so lucky
Kyle wasn't even  in a hospital
She charges the field
- Terrance and Phillip are dodging gunfire and super loud explosions
Did you hear that, Terrance
farted
You did
Just now
They laugh merrily
Come on, we can take shelter in one of those buildings
But just then, Kyle's mother comes charging in with her gun
' Phillip spins around just in time to see Kyle's mother plunge her bayonet into Terrance's abdomen
Terrance
' - Blood from Terrance's abdomen slowly spills from his stomach
Everything gets  as we follow the blood down, down, down
Until it hits the ground with a huge, echoing
on Kyle's mother's eyes
on the spot of blood on the ground
Suddenly, the ground starts to open up
Great flames and ash take over the sky
Satan and his minions explode from below
Everyone stops fighting for a moment, to watch this amazing spectacle
Demons and flames emerge from the ground
All the soldiers on both sides can't believe what they're seeing
Now out of the giant abyss comes Kenny
He dusts himself off and looks around
- As more bombs and gunshots go off
Kyle, Cartman and Ike huddle close to each other in a trench
Kyle
All those times  said you were a big dumb Jew
didn't mean it
You're not a Jew
Kyle thinks
Yes  am
Baba mama
Another explosion rocks the trench
Dirt flies all over the boys' heads
(Noticing Mr
Hat in his hand) What the hell am  still holding this for
Cartman tosses Mr
Hat out of the trench
We hear and then   we hear Garrison's voice
Mr
Hat
Noooooo
Suddenly, Stan jumps down into the trench
Stan
Dude,  found the clitoris
think  can get Wendy to like me now
Sweet
(Sarcastic) Oh, that's swell, Stan
guess all's well that ends well, huh
We can go home now
There's just one little thing left to tie up
More explosions go off
Dead bodies fly all around the boys
Suddenly, Kenny appears before the boys
/ It's him
told you
Kenny's come to take us to the netherworld
Mph rmph rmph rmph
Wait
He's not haunting us, he's trying to tell us something
Mph rmph rm rmph rm
Okay
We can get you some proofs of purchases for Snacky Smores Kenny
Just mellow the heck out
- More battle
People are dying left and right
The Doctor from the Hospital scene runs in with an -16 Canadian steps in front of him, the doctor shoots, and blows the Canadian's head clean off
Hey, pal, don't lose your head
Suddenly, the ticket guy's chest rips open
He falls dead, and standing behind him is a Canadian with a double barreled shotgun
'm glad you got that off your chest
Tom the Rhinoplasty surgeon leaps in and stabs the Canadian through the head with his bayonet
guess he got the point
Canadian rushes in and machine guns Tom full of holes
2 Plastics are a cheap and efficient insulator for electrical applications
Just as the fighting escalates, Satan and his minions rush in
Yes
Good
Fight and kill one another
The soldiers all look scared and puzzled
You're all part of Satan's army now
' What the hell is going on
Satan gets in Kyle's mother's face
am the dark master
' Oh no you don't
This is  fight don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz
' Oh
Kyle's mother backs down, ashamed
Oh, good job, Mrs
Broflofski, thanks a lot
' was just trying to make the world a better place for children
Yes
And in doing so, you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming
' And  thought my mother was the master of guilt
Geez Louise
' Oh God
What have  done
One by one, the soldiers start to kneel
Satan throws his arms up in the air and laughs a horrible, deep laugh that fills the world
But just then, the ground shakes again
Satan looks over to the huge abyss he had crawled out of and notices another figure
He is burnt horribly, but it is Saddam
He holds a martini glass in his hand
Hey, 'm missing the party
No
It can't be
Saddam, burnt to a crisp, walks over to Satan and grabs his ass
Did you miss me, buttercup
(Yelling out) All right, gang
am your new ruler now
Everyone bow down to
Satan puts his head down
Kyle walks up with Cartman, Stan and Kenny
Oh, it's the bratty kid from hell
You made a deal with Kenny that if he got ten proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores you'd grant him any wish
And
Kenny pulls out the proofs of purchases plays
you not to make that deal, Saddam
Who gives a fuck
was just fucking with him
What
The deal's off, go away, guy
No, Saddam
You made a deal
You can't just renege on a deal
That's lying
Relax bitch
You're better seen, not hear okay
Saddam smacks Satan in the face
Now Satan looks mad, but he sits down like a good little bitch
Now, let's start torturing people, shall we
We'll start with
(Looks at Cartman) little fat kid first
Don't call me fat, buttfucker- huge  shoots from Cartman, knocking one of hell's demons on his ass
Holy shit Cartman
What was that
How the fuck should  know
Another huge  emits from the v-chip inside Cartman and sends the other Swedish Soldier reeling
Look at that
It's that v-chip thing that's inside you, Eric
The polarity must have been reversed by the electric chair
Oh boy
smile comes across Cartman's face
huge charge busts the chains that hold Cartman's wrists
He jumps down
Yes
plays as Cartman uses his newly found power
Quick, Satan
Do something
But before Satan can do anything, Cartman holds up his hands and lets loose
,
charge hits Satan square between the eyes and knocks him down
He gets to his knees and stands up again
Hey, you need to watch your mouth, brat
Try this on for size- Cartman holds up his hands
The charge hits Saddam in the chest
He drops again
Saddam looks around and is suddenly scared
He appeals to Cartman
Hey buddy
No need to stress
Let me make you a deal
How about a lifetime supply of Snacky Smores and we just forget about this whole thing
Don't listen to him, Cartman
Mrphmmmph
(giving in)  Okay
(then)  Not
Cartman closes his eyes and hums like he's summoning up the worst words in the world
Then, it comes out
Like a volcano
huge purple jolt emerges from each of Cartman's hands and joins into one powerful current that hits Saddam
Saddam is thrown back against the wall
(To Satan) What are you waiting for, bitch
Destroy him
Satan looks at Cartman, then at Saddam, and thinks
Come on you weak, stupid cum bucket
Save me
Satan stands there
Help you
You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you
You're always making me feel like a piece of shit
Come on guy, you know  only rib you because  love you so much
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect
You've never respected me
Can we talk about this later
Everyone is watching
don't care
want to talk about it now
Saddam grabs Satan by the arm
Ow, you're hurting me
Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends
You know how  get mad when  get embarassed
Satan starts getting really mad
Steam starts coming from his nostrils
Your little problems can wait til later, see
Steam starts coming out of Satan's nostrils
Now do what  say and keep your fucking mouth shut
'
Satan picks up Saddam, and throws him over a huge, flaming cliff, back into the depths of hell
NOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooo
Heeeeyyyy guyyyyy, relaaaaaxx
Saddam Hussein is dead
Hooray
Everyone cheers
You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy
Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words
Well,  learned it all from you guys
Of course you did, cock fuck
They all laugh merrily
Satan stands over the cliff, looking down at where Saddam fell
He spent so much time convincing me  was weak and stupid that  believed it myself
The boys look at each other, confused
Saddam didn't respect me
All he wanted was sex
But it took me so long to figure that out
He starts to cry
Chef hands him a hanky
Here you go Satan- Thank you
Give me the proofs of purchases
Kenny hands them to Satan
Okay Kenny,  will keep the bargain
Any wish you want is yours
slowly on Kenny
Finally, Kenny speaks
Mph rmph rmpg rmph mm
Everyone
Are you sure, Kenny
What did he say
He said that his wish is for everyone who died in the war to come back
Kenny, you realize this wish is the only chance for  not to be dead
mprh
Mph rmph rm rmph rm rmphm rmphm
Mm rmphm rmphm rhmphm
Triumphant music plays, as if Kenny is giving a grand, important speech
Very well, then
will put an end to the war as your wish and make everything as it was before the war started
But you Kenny, must remain dead
Mph rm
Satan turns to the open abyss
must admit, 'm kind of relieved
It's too fucking cold up here
Aren't there cold parts of hell
Yeah, but it's a real dry cold
Here it's the humidity that gets me
guess 'm destined to live in hell
alone
Sadly, Satan walks back down the trench into hell
But something catches his eye
Hello
What's this
Satan bends down and picks up Mr
Hat
He looks at it, and then places it gently on his hand
Hi there, little guy
Would you like to go to hell with me
(
) Sure
bet we can be best friends
Satan smiles
And walks down to hell with Mr
Hat
The boys walks over to Kenny
Thank you, Kenny
Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us
You're a real pal
bright red light flashes and Satan and his minions are dragged back down into hell
Kenny is taken along with them
At the same time, Garrison, Jimbo, Mackey and all the others who died, suddenly and magically appear
They look at themselves, wondering what just happened
Everyone just stands around in a daze
Canadians and Americans alike look at each other and wonder what to do
'm alive
Where's Mr
Hat
Wow
We were all killed and now we're fine
That's super
Whew, 'm sure glad that's over
Yeah, but you know,  learned something today
learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid
You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing
To love each other
Yeah
You're all a bunch of stupid sons a bitches
The boys' parents walk up
Mom, 'm a man
Just a man
And 'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little
Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or- ' Shiteater- ' -Or monkey fucker- They all laugh merrily at their naughtiness
Wendy walks up to Stan
'm sorry Stan,  guess you really  get it after all
Stan smiles
swells
Wendy
How would you like to go get some ice cream
Sure, Stan
How did you know  loved ice cream
My friend the clitoris told me
Wow,  have a clitoris too
Really
Where the hell do you keep it
It's huge
Wendy grabs Stan and plants a big kiss on him
Stan vomits into Wendy's mouth
But Wendy
What about Gregory
Gregory stands off to one side, scowling
Stan,  never cared for Gregory
You didn't
No, dude
Fuck him
Fuck him in the ear
Cool
(Singing) Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything 'd ever hoped for- Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing  think 'd die for can't stop now
My heart's awake
pray your arms my arms to take
So this is why 'm alive
Now everyone joins hands and starts singing- ,
' '  ,  ' Kenny's mom and dad come up
' This is all so wonderful
just wish our little Kenny could see all of this joy
Oh he can, dude
Look
Kyle points to the sky
Everyone looks up just in time to see a brilliant shooting star across the daytime sky
We follow the shooting star and then slowly  in on it
As we get closer, we realize it is actually Kenny, shooting towards the heavens
As   plays, Kenny's little body floats up and up through the clouds
(:  This will also be done in 3- ) Rays of light from above bathe his body and he flies up into the warmth of the baby blueness
Angels encircle him and give him a pair of wings
They smile gently
He feels calm
