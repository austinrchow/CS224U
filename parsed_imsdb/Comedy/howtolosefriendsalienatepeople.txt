Written by Peter Straughan 09/05/07 : 1   -     1 British, fifties, a melodrama
We're looking at an - glamorous, young - but very much in the back ground of the scene - a secretary typing at her desk
sits watching the film, his clothes and the room around him telling us this is England in the 1960s
He is staring raptly at the actress
(
) All my life 've been a Looky- Loo
: 2
-  2 - We are  on an extremely handsome   staring past us with a dazzling smile
(
) My name's Sidney Young
'm a journalist
a hack
(Beat) Yeah, that
that isn't me
We  right and down to our hero -   - thirties, an odd-ball with a knack for getting people to dislike him
(') (
) (') This is me at the Golden Globe Awards in
this year
That's my Armani tuxedo
That's a Rolex Sea-Dweller 4000 watch 'm wearing
Still in - we   and see that Sidney is at a table with several other people, all staring raptly past us to the stage which is out of shot
(') Those people all around me - they're all famous
They're my friends
Beside him sits a beautiful young woman - (20's)
2
(') (
) (') That's the actress Sophie Maes
This morning she told me she would let me have sex with her if she won the Best Actress Award
Still in  , Sophie suddenly covers her face with her hands and begins to stand
(') (
) (') She just won the Best Actress Award
Sophie walks out of the shot
Still sporting the fixed smile, Sidney claps in - along with everyone else in the room
We  away from Sidney past tables of towards an
(') My life didn't used to be like this
We   the   and find ourselves impossibly looking at
3
-   -   3 4     4 a crowd of  held back from us by a red rope, craning their necks to see us more clearly, waving, cheering, shouting, cameras flashing
Rain lashes down
reads: "Sidney's Life, One Year Ago
Bafta Awards
London
" (
) Looky-Loos
That's what They call you when you stand out in the rain all night just to catch a glimpse of Them going by
-  walk down the red carpet, pausing to wave at the fans
(') used to pretend it was different for me because  was getting paid by a magazine or newspaper, whatever
But that's, you know
just loved watching Them
'd stand outside looking in through the window and think what it would be like to somehow get inside
But there was only one way to get past the thin red line that separates the celebrities from the civilians
You had to be famous
3
4A
-   4A Sidney stands talking to a young   at the security gate
He has a small, ugly  on a leash
Babe
Babe Three
Yeah
She looks doubtfully at the pig
Babe was a cute little piglet
Harry Potter used to be a cute little piglet too
What do you want
Tempus Fugits
He hasn't got any
How many pigs are coming tonight
Look,  was told to bring him, hand him over to the producer, Bob Milton, inside
You want me to leave him here with you, that's fine
No, you can't leave him with me
've got
Hold on, 'll
She looks around, helplessly
She begins to unhook the red rope
Sidney tries to hide his excitement
(') If you're positive that you're supposed to
An    stalks over
() Well, well, Sidney Young
() Well, well
clipboard Nazi-type woman
She turns to the  standing beside them
The pig doesn't get in
4
She starts to walk away
What about me
was talking about you
5   5 Sidney and the Pig are being "escorted" away from the red carpet by the Security
(
) The Looky-Loos dream is that one day they will somehow get to mingle with the stars
But the Industry can't allow any mingling
Stars have to be kept away from civilians, have to be quarantined, so they don't become normal
Like us
They pass a ravishing   walking the other way
She looks curiously at the pig as she passes
Sidney stares after her, longingly
6
-  6 through the doors and into the lobby of the exclusive hotel
(
) But after the awards come the parties - the Miramax Party, the London Records Party and, best of all - the Sharps Magazine Party, so exclusive that there are no pass-alongs, no plus-ones, no press
We find Sidney checking in at the desk
(') (to Receptionist, ) How much
only want to stay for one night
7
-   7 Sidney stands in the rising elevator, suit bag in his hand, holdall at his feet
(
) 5
This is where the movie stars can finally relax, secure in the knowledge they are among their own kind
We see the '  poking out of the zip of the holdall
8
-  8 Sidney turns from the mirror to face us
He is wearing a '  of white shirt, waistcoat, and bow tie
He is also wearing a  and
(
) And that is when  strike
He picks up a tray of canapes from the bed and looks down to where the Pig watches him from the floor
(') want you in bed by ten
And no porn
He tosses the pig one of the canapes
9
-  9 Sidney, tray in hand, peers around the corner to the entrance to the hotel's roofed
The Older Woman we saw earlier stands at the door, a formidable presence
As we watch she greets an approaching gushingly
Seizing his chance Sidney darts towards the door and, tray held aloft to cover his face, slips through into the courtyard beyond
10
-    -  10 as Sidney emerges from the washrooms, now dressed only in the white shirt and black trousers
He scoops up a passing glass of champagne, checks his moustache and surveys the courtyard - a room full of glamour: tanned skin, diamonds, beautiful dresses, beautiful suits, champagne
He stands surveying the crowd of -list celebrities in front of him, dazed
( ) You can do this
You belong here
You're a star
You're a big, bright shining star
6
11
-  11 The room is trashed - furniture over-turned, mini-bar open and broken bottles all over the floor
weird squealing which could almost be human is coming from the bathroom
(
) Hello
Sir
The squealing stops
(') Is everything alright
The door opens and the Assistant Manager walks in and stands staring around him in horror
Behind him the pig emerges from the bathroom and slips out of the open door, across the corridor and straight into the open lift
12
-  12 Sidney is talking to a very famous and very drunk Hollywood No, when 'm in
stay at the Sunset Marquis, when 'm here always stay at the Sanderson
It's, you know,  don't feel at home these days unless 'm in a hotel
So what do you do
Oh, 'm a writer
Movie writer
Oh great
Yeah
Got one in pre-production now
You know it's really weird running into you like this because just the other day  was telling the producer  thought you'd be perfect for the lead
She starts to laugh
(') No, seriously, you would, because, you know, you have this mixture of intelligence and beauty and fragility that we're looking for and, uh
7
() What's the film
Tits of Fury
She laughs
(') () 'm joking, 'm just
It's a bio- pic
About Greta Garbo
That's why  thought of you
You have those amazing cheek-bones and
are they real
Have you had plastic surgery
No
Have you
Me
No, hardly anything
penis reduction as a child, that's pretty much
She laughs again, snorting into her drink
Sidney can't believe this - she likes him
13
-  13 The lift doors glide open and the Pig trots out and around the corner
The  Woman is still at the door to the courtyard, berating one of her staff
The Pig sails past them both, unnoticed, and disappears into the party
14
-  14 sits drinking at a table
He slips a little bag of Ecstasy from his pocket and takes one
As the Young Man pushes the bag back into his pocket
The Pig sits at his feet watching as the little bag slips back out and  to the floor
The Pig sniffs at the bag
15     15 still talking
The place is crammed now, and hot
Sidney wipes sweat from his forehead
Oh god, 'm drunk
Are you
8
'm so drunk
haven't eaten and
You feel okay
Because my room's just upstairs if you want to lie down or, or loosen any, you know, morals or
() What is your name again
Clark
Clark Baxter
He takes a sip of his champagne and his moustache comes loose and hangs limply from his face
(') How'd you do
The Actress stares at him in surprise but Sidney doesn't notice - he is staring past her to where there is something of a  amongst the guests
The  Woman is hurrying across the room, hissing into her ear-piece
Somebody screams
Then to Sidney's horror a group of guests scatter in panic and the cause of the commotion is revealed: the Pig charges into view, heading straight for him
(') () Oh, shit
The Pig suddenly skids to a halt and stares at Sidney with hot eyes
The  Woman follows the Pig's gaze and spots Sidney
( ) Sarah, get security
Code Red
Sidney Young got in
() Who's Sidney Young
Before Sidney can answer the Pig charges
Oh, shit
Sidney turns and legs it
We are looking    of a tall grey-haired who stands in the shadows watching Sidney run past
This is , his face hidden for the time being
9
He lights a cigarette with a thoughtful air and watches Sidney's flight, rolling the    between his fingers
as the Pig catches up with him and lunges at his ankles
Sidney screams, trips and flies through the air, wig spinning free, hurtling straight towards a table of startled celebrities
We
- "How To Lose Friends & Alienate People
" We hear the opening of David Bowie's Star
16
-  16 As the  and song continue we see a protesting Sidney and Pig being escorted by Security through the endless corridors of the Hotel
Titles End

-  16A seedy flat in Shepherds bush
17
'  -  -  17 Sidney lies in bed reading a newspaper in his underwear phone is  in the next room
Sidney begins to cut out a photograph from one of the papers - Sidney struggling with an irate Clint Eastwood and some Security Men
The phone continues to ring
() Will you get that
(Beat) Will you get the phone
Sighing he gets up and scratching himself, stumbles through to
18   18 which we see is, bizarrely, an  - full of an odd assortment of , desks, antiquated computers and an old fax machine
The walls are lined with past covers from Sidney's magazine - The Post-Modern Review
One bears a photograph of Victoria Beckham with the title "Posh Spice
Like Fuck She Is
" 10
is talking on the phone by the door
The other phone is still ringing
Look, we don't hate celebrities at the Post-Modern Review, okay
We just don't think they should be taking themselves so seriously
For us a celebrity is a text to be deconstructed
Apart from Costner obviously
Sidney edges past him to where a   and a histrionic   are in the middle of a argument, encouraged by the other members of staff
() wouldn't do this the honour of calling it a review
It's a puerile, personal attack in, in alcoholic prose, in which incidentally you manage to misquote both Derrida and Lyotard
am a
() Girl
an internationally respected academic and
Prick
author of a very well received book on the history of culture and a
Fuckwit
(threading his way past) Couldn't one of you answer the phone
As the argument continues behind him he reaches the phone with a bored   sitting by it
(') Will you answer that
What do pay you for
You don't pay me
11
Just get the phone
The Young Man answers the phone
Post-Modern Review
Sidney, if she doesn't apologise 'm quitting
(to the Large Woman) George can't leave
You'll have to apologise
Why can't George leave
He owns the fax machine
Sidney notices the Young Man is staring at him with a scared expression
(') What
It's Sharps Magazine
Sidney stops smiling
(') We're finished
We're not finished
They sue, we're finished
Shut up
(To the others) Will you be quiet
They ignore him and continue bickering
Sidney picks up the phone
(') Sidney Young
(
) (over phone, gravel ) This is Clayton Harding
'm the editor of Sharps Magazine
Sidney is visibly thrown
12
Ah, Lord Vader
19
'  -  19 Clayton Harding's swivel chair - all we can see is Clayton's grey hair, his custom-built desk and the enormous office in front of him
He is smoking
As he talks he rolls a    between his fingers
saw you at my party, just before you ruined it with your little pig stunt
(
) ( ) You liked that
Sure
On his desk we see a few copies the Post-Modern Review - glimpses of stars on the covers - Catherine Zeta-Jones, Orlando Bloom
Clayton's hand sifts one copy from the others and holds it up - the cover depicts   - patrician handsome, stern, photo-shopped so that he appears to be
headline reads "Clayton Harding - The Editor's New Clothes
Clayton's shoulder's heave with a snort of repressed laughter
(') (examining the cover) especially liked the part where Clint Eastwood beat the shit outa ya
20
-  20 Sidney lights a cigarette, trying to seem casual
We're not scared of you, Harding
You want to sue, go ahead and sue
It's like Jimmy Stewart said, (a poor Stewart impersonation:)"You sit up there and you spin your little webs and you think the whole world revolves around you and your money
Well, it doesn't, Mr

An  walks in
Clayton looks up
() Miss Taylor is here sir
Clayton nods and quickly throws the magazines into a of the desk
Sidney is still talking over the phone, beginning to enjoy himself

) Destroy me and a hundred more will spring up in my place - men who care nothing for success, men who cannot be bought, men whose only loyalty is to

22
-  22 Sidney stares to where the Thin Man is trying to get out of the door with the Fax Machine, the Large Woman struggling with him
The two fall to the floor
The rest of the staff gather around them
() Fight, fight, fight
( ) Um
could you say that again please
We hear the sound of an aeroplane engine build as we

24
-  24 Sidney emerges from the airport, wearing his crumpled brown suit, dragging his suitcase behind him
He stares around, excited to be here
25
- '  -  25 Sidney drags his suitcase down the quiet street and stops outside an apartment block, checking the address
26
-  26 An elderly Polish lady -   - is leading Sidney up the stairs of the building
This magazine you are working for
It is good
It's Sharps Magazine
You know Sharps
It's sort of society, fashion, crime, finance, Hollywood celebrities
() Hollywood
Sodom and Gomorrah
Now everybody is celebrity
You take out your breasts, you are celebrity
(eyeing her chest ) Well,  think it depends on the breasts but
() In Poland, someone was famous because they had done something
Marie Curie
Pope John Paul
Yeah, they don't make entertainers like that any more
Mrs Kowalski cuffs the back of his head
Sidney is somewhat surprised by this familiarity, having only just met the lady
She opens an apartment door
15
26A
-  26A Mrs Kowalski shows Sidney into the small and cheaply furnished apartment
Sidney's boxed possessions stand in a corner
They brought your things yesterday
( ) Yup, this is good
This is can put my drum kit just over there and, uh
She stares at him
(') That's a
that's just a joke
They're just little
congas
When do you start work
Tomorrow morning
Well, you need to be fresh, make a good impression
(Leaving) Go to bed
Just what 'm going to do
27
-  27 drunken Sidney dances frenetically on a small dance floor made of squares of flashing color, compensating with enthusiasm for what he lacks in coordination
The women on the floor shuffle further and further away from him
28
-  28 Sidney walks down the street, staring bright eyed at the city around him, in love with New York
in a short dress passes him
Sidney ogles her as she walks into a
29
-  29 Sidney finds the Sexy Woman sitting at the bar
There is an empty stool beside her
Sidney sidles into it
16
( ) Kona please
Sidney gestures to the Barman to make it two
He sits trying to think of something to say
The barman returns with their drinks
(raising his glass) Hi, my name's Clark
Clark Baxter
The Woman looks at him without expression
Sidney sips his drink, grimaces
(') ( ) What the hell's that
That's a water sir
Well that's
that's not right, is it
That's not
put a dash of beer in that
young woman has been sitting on the other side of Sidney
This is   (20s) smart, attractive, dressed in an elegant but no-nonsense suit
She is writing in a
She looks up and notices Sidney
'm sorry, my boyfriend's sitting there
Sidney gets up and examines the stool
Is he
He's fucking small isn't he
He smiles at the Sexy Woman, hoping to get a laugh
Alison examines Sidney coolly, points to the drink on the bar in front of Sidney
That's his White Russian
He'll be here in a second
( ) Can you reserve these seats
Nope
Sidney sits down and turns back to the Sexy Woman
17
'm a journalist
Work for a little periodical you might have heard of called Sharps Magazine
Sidney produces a card and waves it vaguely
(') 'm the Cultural Editor
Alison takes the card from his hand before he can put it away again
(to Sexy Woman) This is a library card
(Reading it) From Glow-cester
(snatching it back) That's
not that one
(Searching wallet) 've got it somewhere
just
The Sexy Woman gets up and walks away
Sidney watches her go bitterly
(') ( ) Happy now
Just doing my bit for the gene pool
He produces the  of him being held in a headlock by Clint Eastwood
Who's that there with Clint Eastwood
Morgan Freeman
No, in the headlock
You had this laminated
Oh just give it
He snatches the photograph back, catching Alison's glass in the process
Her drink  over her notebook - soaking the page she has been writing
Shit
18
It's okay
It's okay
've got it
He tries to blot the page with a napkin, smearing the ink
Just
just leave it
She examines the book, furious
Sorry
He tries to think of something to say
(') It's pronounced Gloucester by the way
() Are you going to get off that seat
No
() Do you know the meaning of Karma
The curry
(inscribing a circle in ) What goes around, comes around
The moment is approaching when you will pay the price for being an asshole
When my boyfriend gets here 'm going to put my pacifist leanings to one side and encourage him to take you outside and
Her cell-phone rings
She answers it
(') Hello
Hi, honey
(Beat) Oh
(Beat) no, no, it's
don't worry about it
'll see you then
She hangs up, avoiding Sidney's gaze, embarrassed and annoyed
Boyfriend not coming
19
She stares straight ahead, gathering her things
(') () Listen, 'm sorry
Do you think
She turns to him
(') Do you think  could have his drink
Alison gives him a cold smile, controlling her temper
She spots a heavily made-up  walking past
Bobbie
Hey
You want a seat
'm just leaving
Thanks
The Woman takes Alison's place at the bar
(to the newcomer) Hello
He slides the  over to her
(') Guess who that is with Clint Eastwood
Alison gives a small smile and leaves
30
'  -  30 Sidney and the Woman dance drunkenly around the room to the music blaring from Sidney's stereo
The track finishes and they stand gasping for breath
'm gonna powder my nose
Why don't you put on something a little more romantic
She staggers off down the hall
Sidney, giddy with excitement, searches through some LPs and puts one on his old turntable
It's Ace of Spades by Motorhead
He staggers around, playing air-guitar for a moment
20
The music is suddenly switched off
He turns to find Mrs Kowalski standing beside the record player, staring grimly at him
Mrs Lebowski
Kowalski
You know what time it is
The music blaring, your door open
(trying to seem sober) Was it
Fuck
mean, shit
Sorry
just
met an old friend and brought them back
The Woman staggers back into the room, her back to us
She is
She is also surprisingly muscular
(') for a little
He notices the woman
His gaze drops to below the waist
(') penis
Mrs Kowalski turns and takes in the view
Nobody moves
31
-  31 hung-over Sidney wakes up in his bed, light streaming through the window
32  32 He examines his reflection, psyching himself up for his first day
You can do this
You can do this
He hums the fanfare from the Rocky theme
33   33 Sidney walks into the room, still humming the theme tune, shadow boxing
He opens the blinds and turns to the couch
The "Woman" wakes up from where she has been sleeping on the couch and gazes blearily at Sidney
Quick coffee Bob and then you've got to go
21
We hear the opening of Brian Ferry's version of The `In' Crowd as we
34
-  34 As the song continues we see Sidney swagger down the busy sidewalk towards us
He is wearing sunglasses and a -shirt emblazoned with a photograph of Keanu Reeves and the caption "Young, Dumb and Full of Cum
"The -shirt is riding up a little over his belly
(
) This is my city
He stops at a gleaming chrome entrance and stares up at the Heywood Building towering above him
35
-   -  35 As the song continues Sidney, still swaggering, is escorted through the formidable looking security by a thin and chic The entrance hall arches above them, a vast and impressive cavern of chrome and glass
(
) This is my building
36
-   36 Sidney leans nonchalantly against the wall of the lift examining the Chic Assistant and two stunningly beautiful who are in conversation
Sidney manages to catch the attention of one of the models and flashes what he believes is a rakish smile
In return he receives an icy glare
(
) These are my models
37
-  -   37 The Chic Assistant leads Sidney down a curving, red carpeted corridor, past a chrome wall inscribed with the giant logo of the magazine
They reach a set of double doors which the Assistant opens for Sidney
(
) And this
Sidney walks through into
38  '  38 Harding swings around in his chair to glare at us, a cigarette in his mouth
22
(
) is my Boss
What the fuck are you wearing
The song grinds to an abrupt halt
Sidney loses a quantity of swagger
He examines his -shirt
You like it
brought you one
He takes a -shirt from his satchel and hands it to Harding
Thanks
Casually he flings the shirt out of the open window behind him
(') Next time you come here dressed like that, you follow the shirt
You understand
Sidney nods dumbly
(') Sit down
How was the flight
() Good
Thanks for the business class tickets, Clay
Harding regards him gravely
That was a mistake
And don't call me Clay
Oh
Well, if it's any consolation got downgraded anyway
() That is some consolation
Sidney notices that the copy of The Post-Modern Review is on the desk - Clayton
() Ha
That was just a little, uh
as it happens 'm a big fan of your earlier, funnier work
Snipe Magazine that was
that was really good
23
Harding stares at Sidney
(') Yeah, you've
you've actually been a big influence on me and really think together we can inject a bit of that Snipe spirit into this magazine
Now 've got a few ideas that 'd like to
() You think you've arrived, doncha
Well  hate to break it to you, but you're only in the first room
It's not nothing, don't get me wrong, but there are plenty of people in this town who never made it past the first room
After a year or so, maybe longer, you'll discover a secret doorway at the back of the first room that leads to the second
Eventually, if you're lucky, you'll discover another doorway back of the second room that leads to the third
He gazes at Sidney through narrowed eyes
(') There are seven rooms in all
You're in the first, 'm in the seventh, and doncha forget it Sidney has been listening with a frown of concentration
() So
if  make it to the Seventh Room - will  become a true Jedi Knight
Harding exhales smoke and puts out his cigarette
Which brings us to the subject of your sense of humour
had a look through your "magazine" here
What'd you think
Clayton swivels in his chair and stares thoughtfully out over the Manhattan skyline
Oh,  thought it was
kinda snarky
And bitter
And
witless
24
Sidney digests this
Clayton seems lost in thought
Finally
(') 'm going to try you out in the Spy Section
39
-  39 Sidney is hurrying to keep up with   (40's) as he strides down the corridor
Lawrence is Canadian, handsome, one of the golden boys of the magazine and arrogant with it
Other  pass them as they walk, heads down, expressions serious
The place is a model of quiet, professional industry
(glancing at Sidney's ) Well, Sidney
We've only just met but already  perceive  am in the presence of a rare comic sensibility
Thanks
know your Hi-jinx gave you a certain notoriety back in Olde England but things are going to be a bit different here
Harding wants me to be your Rabbi, show you the ropes
Are you aware of what we do at  Spy
You photograph famous people when they're drunk
( ) Spy is the nation's window onto High Society
The Looky-Loos read us because
well, They Weren't There
The Glitterati read us because we tell them They Were There
For this system to work we have to know where There is
So
when we go out to clubs and things
would that, would that be on expenses or
This isn't a vacation
It's a vocation
25
Maddox sweeps around the corner into an open-plan office area
Fact-checkers and Assistants buzz around
(') When we do go out you're going to have to wear something more suitable
Okay
What do you mean by suitable
Maddox gestures at Sidney's body
Something that covers all of this up
He starts to check messages on his desk
Sidney, trying to seem at ease, stares at a black and white  on the wall
Is that Mussolini
(Beat
) ) No, Sidney, that's Richard Heywood
The owner of this magazine
Oh
Looks a little like, uh
(pointing to the child in the photograph, smiling) Who's this funny looking kid
Is that his son
Maddox stares at him
() That's his daughter, Elizabeth; now my wife
materializes like a halo around Maddox's head
It reads: Do Not Fuck with Me
() Really
Well, she's very
isn't she
Really, very
Someone walks up behind Sidney
Miss Olsen here takes care of the gallery openings, book launches and other intellectual fare
Can you find our new rookie something to do
26
Sidney turns to find Alison behind him, eating an apple
She eyes him coldly

40  40 Alison sits working at her computer
Sidney appears and perches on the edge of her desk
Listen, seeing as how 'm going to be sitting just over there, don't you think we should try and put last night behind us
No
Get off my desk

The lift rises
It's fashion sensitive
If you're not wearing Prada it'll take your arm clean off
Anna stares at this strange man with the burger, baffled
But  am wearing Prada
The lift stops and she gets out
Alison gets in, sees Sidney and winces
She takes out a book and pretends to read
The lift begins to rise again
Through it's glass doors we see the different floors passing, different publications - each a hive of sober, hard work
Sidney stares at them
( ) This isn't what  expected
Alison recoils slightly
What did you expect
don't know
The Algonquin circle
Dorothy Parker
Martinis
Quips
Look at them
Not one of them is drunk
It's called being a professional
You should try it some time
There's something you should understand
'm not really one of you
By "you" do you mean "human
" 30
mean the glossy posse
Bunch of Zombies, writing about "Pets of the Stars" but acting like they're working for the

Where are you from
Not that it's any of your business, but 'm from Port Huron, Michigan
Right
Small town girl
(Hannibal Lector impersonation)  bet you could only dream of getting out
Getting anywhere - yes, Clarice
Getting all the way - to the (Dropping the impersonation) Take my advice, don't go taking this celebrity fluff seriously
For a moment Alison is speechless with anger
You
you
arrogant
The lift stops and a   enters
She is expensively dressed, wears Chanel dark glasses, an expression of granite and an air of superhuman froideur
Alison exchanges the slightest of nods with her and stares tensely ahead
Only Sidney, busy chewing, is oblivious to the plunge in temperature
For a moment there is only the soft whir of the lift
Then Sidney begins to choke on some burger
He wheezes for a moment, gagging
The Woman stiffens slightly but shows no other sign of having noticed the revolting noises coming from behind her
Alison closes her eyes
Sidney gives a violent cough and a chunk of chewed burger and coleslaw flies out of his mouth and lands on the back of the oblivious Woman's Prada jacket
Sidney notices and raises a tentative hand to brush the offending item away
Before he can move Alison silently takes his wrist in a vice-like grip
43  -   43 Alison is haranguing Sidney
31
() Are you insane
That was Lawrence's wife, Elizabeth

And you lumber in here, spitting food, haven't got the brains God gave a mollusc
why did Clayton hire you
( ) Snipe Magazine
What
When Clayton left college he started this little magazine called Snipe
Fantastic
Took aim at every self-important celebrity in town
Completely fearless
It was like my magazine but twenty years earlier
() 32
(') That's why he's hired me
am the young Clayton Harding
He looks at me and sees his glory days
() His glory days
Sharps has won fourteen National Magazine awards and increased its advertising pages by more than 60 percent since he took over
He's paid millions of dollars a year
He lives in a Bank Street townhouse, and weekends in the Hamptons
Clayton Harding is one of the lynchpins of the media-industrial complex
Sidney stops to examine his reflection in a window
Yeah, but don't worry
think might still be in time to save him
44
'  -  44 The phone is ringing
Sidney walks in from the bedroom, changing into his old brown suit
The answer machine kicks in
(
) (over answer machine) You've reached Sidney Young
'm sorry but my answering machine is out of order, so the voice you are hearing is actually me
The machine
Sidney smirks at his joke and is reaching for the phone when we hear the caller - an older man, an upper-class English accent

Are you there
Sidney stops in his tracks, something complicated and fearful crossing his face
'  (

Sidney tiptoes back out of the room
'  (') If you're there Sidney, answer the phone

46
- -  -  46 The rooftop swimming pool of a hotel
Flowers everywhere, including in the pool
Guests mill around drinking
We find Sidney working his way through the throng to where Alison stands
( ) There's a couple of hundred grands worth of food here and swear 'm the only person eating it
You want some
Alison recoils
Sidney does a little nerdy dance to the music as he eats
(') This place is amazing
It's wall to wall totty
Wall to wall what
Totty
Babes
Sexually attractive women
Do you mind
What
Maddox joins them
man passes, nods respectfully at Maddox
(') Look at that
All night people have been treating us like we're royalty
In London, the journalist's motto is "Everybody hates us and we don't care
" Well, now you're one of the High Priests of what's Hot and what's Not
So what were you two talking about
34
Sidney was just marvelling at the abundance of "Totty" here
( ) Uh-oh
don't think Miss Olsen approves of you, Sidney
Sidney watches some beautiful women pass, dripping diamonds

get thrown out of places like this
This
This is a McDonald's hate disease parties
(Off Sidney's puzzled look) Fund- raisers
Someone's
All of the guests automatically check their cells
An    walks over - she's a little drunk
Lawrence Maddox
Oh my goodness
Long time
Maddox examines her coolly
(') Rachel
Lawrence barely bothers to conceal the fact he doesn't remember her
Rachel
How are you
Well, 'm just wonderful
Wonderful
How are you
Lawrence smiles and looks around him without answering
Rachel tries again
(') Funny  should run into you
've just done this great little film called Five Boroughs and it's you know, low-budget, first-time director but very, uh, moving and
Hey, maybe you could do a little
35

Maddox instantly turns away from Rachel
() Angelo, good to see you
Rachel hovers for a moment, embarrassed by her abrupt dismissal then slips away
Sidney watches her go, feeling for her
( ) You know that was Rachel Petkoff
She's a fantastic actress
Hasn't done anything for years, but, in her day
() 'm sure
Seriously, 've heard about that film
think she's going to make a come back
We should get there first, do a profile or something before everyone else
Maddox isn't listening
Instead he greets a fat, angry- looking
This is  , wearing his customary
() Vincent
Great to see you
Children, 'd like to introduce you to Vincent Lepak, enfant terrible and in, my opinion, the most exciting new director in American cinema
Vincent nods, frowning, looks around
think this is the worst fundraiser 've been to in my whole life
It's a rat fuck, isn't it
Sidney walks away
47    47 standing at the parapet, smoking, staring out over the city with red eyes
Sidney appears beside her
36
Excuse me
Aren't you Rachel Petkoff
Rachel turns to look at him
(') This is sort of embarrassing but
He holds out a napkin
(') Could  have your autograph
Rachel, suspecting she is the target of ridicule, looks around to see if there's an audience

Sidney Young
She takes the napkin and pen, her face glowing
() Sidney Young
'll remember that

48    48 holding court to Maddox, Alison and some of the Glitterati
Sidney joins them, eating more food
You look around and it's all shit
No-one is making movies that are fucking worthwhile
'd have to disagree with you, Vincent
Vincent looks at him, displeased
(') You're making movies that are worthwhile
Vincent accepts this with a curt nod
This is what 'm saying
You have to inspire yourself
am my role- model
want to be me
He stares angrily around, handing his empty glass to his waiting assistant who immediately replaces it with a full one from a passing tray
Sidney watches him with dislike
() Greatest film ever made
Excuse me
What's the greatest film ever made
(To Alison) Go on
Have a guess
() Well, that's
don't think there is one single film that
Have a guess
() Yeah, have a guess - what is the greatest film ever made
38
() don't, uh
well personally love La Dolce Vita but
Incorrect
Con Air
() beg your pardon
Uhuh, Con Air
It's got everything
Malkovich for your acting chops, Nicky Cage for action, Buscemi for comedy, John Cusack for the Gays
It's a smorgasbord
The group study him, trying to work out if this is irony or idiocy
Maddox is staring daggers at him
An extremely thin, fashionably dressed woman smiles at Sidney
don't think we've been introduced
Mister Young, this is Eleanor Johnson, Queen of New York
Eleanor this is Sidney Young
He's from England and he's our very own Idiot Savant
Without the Savant
Well, it's always nice to have fresh blood at these things
(To Maddox) Which reminds me, 'm here with Sophie Maes,  want you to meet her
New film, The Suffragette coming out, the buzz is -mazing
The release is tied in with the roll-out of the Reebok campaign, and now Louis Vuitton's on the line
This train is leaving the station Lawrence
( ) So, you're a publicist
don't really like that word, Sidney
What should  call you
39
You can call me Eleanor
She stares past him, across the pool
(') There she is
They turn to see a young woman standing across the pool from them
This is   - a natural beauty, statuesque, no make-up, hair simply pulled back
Sophie tries to walk around the pool to join them but finds she can't work her way through the crowd
She turns to her right but finds her way similarly blocked
She hesitates for a moment and then with a shrug climbs down into the pool, the water up to her chest, and begins to walk through the floating flowers towards them
Sidney stares at her,
Alison notices this with some contempt
Gradually everyone notices Sophie and stops to look
Having reached the other side, Sophie ascends the pool steps, laughing, her dress clinging to her: Venus rising from the waves
The Photographers appear, snapping merrily away
() Oh, this one will go far
49
-  49 Sophie, still in her wet dress, Eleanor and Sophie's are striding through the hotel's corridors, on their way out
Maddox, Sidney and Alison are with them
(on cell phone) Where's the car
What's it doing at the back
Forget what  said
want the car at the front
Now
Sidney finds himself walking alongside Sophie and Maddox, trying not to stare at Sophie's breasts
just think it's terrible the way we're still exploiting animals
That's why, you know, won't wear fur or leather, won't wear make-up, 'm vegetarian
'm with you
40
Sophie turns to him with a vague smile
(') won't eat anything with, you know, eyebrows
He snickers nervously
(') Or if it can chuckle
won't eat animals that can chuckle
'm sorry,  can't understand your accent
() Nothing, just, uh
So you're an actress
Have  seen you in anything
don't know
Have you
() No
(Trying again) So you haven't won any Oscars yet
No
Because  would certainly vote for you for best supporting dress
Huh, huh, huh
( ) haven't been nominated for anything
No, 'm just
'm saying you look
They have reached the front entrance of the hotel
Eleanor steps between them
( ) Are you ready dear
The front doors glide open to reveal a waiting outside
As Sophie steps outside there is a sudden roar of photographers shouting and the night sky blazes white as
41
- the group framed in the entrance-way - blinded by the glare, squinting
Only Sophie has her eyes open, smiling, looking like a star
50
-   50 The Paparazzi are still crowding around the group as they make their way to the waiting car
( ) We're going on to the Circle Club
'll see you tomorrow
() Okay
Good night
Maddox slips his jacket around Sophie's shoulders
Aren't you cold
'm from Canada, land of ice and snow
They get into the car
Sidney tries to follow them
Budge up
Where are you going
'm coming to the club
Sorry, you're not on the list
small  -  - on Sophie's lap snarls at Sidney
(') See
Even Cuba says so
Maddox closes the door and the car glides away, Sophie kissing the dog on the nose
The Paparazzi hurry back to the entrance as another celebrity emerges, leaving Alison and Sidney staring after the car
() That's
that turns my stomach
Pawing her like that
He's old enough to be her father
42
() No he isn't
Yes he is
started producing sperm when  was thirteen, so you know, technically
For your information he wasn't pawing her
He was just doing his job
In case you haven't noticed Sharps has to have a star on the cover every month
And most of those stars are clients of Eleanor's
So do not piss her off
She's a flak
Hacks don't take orders from flaks
And  don't think you can call that "doing his job
" The man had no blood left in his upper body
() Will you
Oh, and next time you want to do the hilariously ironic  love Con Air skit would you mind
wasn't being ironic
would you mind not involving me, especially in the presence of Vincent Lepak who happens to be very important
Yeah,  could tell by the way he was allowed to stay up past his bed time
The car disappears into the distance
They watch it go
(') Do you think she'd go out with me
Who
Sophie Maes
You think she'll go out with me
43
No
Girls like Sophie don't date journalists
As far as she's concerned, you're the help
What do you know
lot of these starlets are lonely
They spend their time looking for a man
Alison starts to walk away
This is New York, Sidney
Women only date men who are successful
'm going to be successful
(as she goes) and tall
51
-    -  51 Sidney sits in front of his computer reading the on-line New York Post Page Six
story on the previous night is accompanied by a large picture of Sophie in her clinging dress
Above the picture is the title Venus Envy
Sidney stares at the picture, entranced
Alison sits at her desk, watching him with contempt
Maddox appears beside them
Have you seen this
She's everywhere
An  walks over with a   for Maddox
From Sophie Maes
(reading the card) "Thanks for a great night
" What a sweet kid
Oh, Sidney, about last night - word of advice
Don't talk to the celebrities, okay
Sophie said you made her feel uncomfortable
He walks off with a slight smirk
Sidney glowers after him
44
52
-  -  52 Sidney walks down the corridor
He slows, his expression changing suddenly
'
- Elizabeth Maddox is walking down the corridor towards us, face set
Sidney keeps on walking, staring to one side of Elizabeth
As they draw level, the heel of one of Elizabeth's shoes snaps off and she lurches sideways, colliding with the wall before sprawling onto the floor in front of Sidney
Sidney hesitates
He notices Alison watching with baited breath from the other end of the corridor
For a moment nobody moves then Sidney steps over Elizabeth's prone form without a word and keeps on walking
Alison gives a sigh of relief, nods in approval and walks on
53
-  53 Clayton heads a monthly staff meeting
rather smug Maddox is just finishing a pitch
so Brad's people finally got back to me and they've agreed
We've got the whole afternoon, before the shoot
People clap
Harding nods approvingly
Good work Lawrence
Okay, well, if that's it for
He starts to get up
So,  was thinking, Clay
Clayton, pauses, frowning
Sidney turns to the room, cocksure
(') Paris Hilton
do a profile on her as if she's this complete recluse, this hermit
(laughing) try and track her down and, you know, "Who is the elusive Paris Hilton and why is she so publicity shy
" He laughs for a moment
No one joins in
45
That's first room stuff, Sidney
And call me Clay one more time and see what happens
Harding stalks out of the room
Blushing, Sidney stares after him, nodding vaguely
As he gathers his notebook he becomes aware of the smirks on the faces of Maddox and the others as they leave
54
-  54 Alison sits with her notebook and pen
Behind her some of the magazine's glamorous Fashionistas - ,  and - are examining some clothes
No, 'd love these but 'm so fat couldn't
Get out of here
You look totally rexy
( ) Alice
Alison hides her irritation with a smile
Alison
Tell Vicky she looks rexy
Rexy
Anorexic
( ) Well
you do look like you could do with a few more pounds
Oh god, that's so sweet
( ) By the way, post-shoot clear out
Got some Gucci pants here that are way too big for us
You wanna try
46
(another tight smile) No, thanks
She looks up as Sidney sits heavily beside her, stares at her with puppy-dog eyes
Alison tries to ignore him for a moment
(') don't mean to be rude Sidney but
what the fuck do you want
Listen, you know how things work around here
How am  going to get something in the magazine
Alison stares at him
thought all this "fluff" was beneath you
It is but
things have changed
What's changed
Look,  know people think 'm a bit of an idiot and maybe haven't started off too well here, but  want
want
He seems so awkward that Alison begins to soften a little
(') want to have sex with Sophie Maes
(Beat) Before Maddox does
Alison's expression turns to disgust
You're loathsome, you know that
() know he's got a head start on me but 'm going to win her back
Once  get my hooks into a girl, they never get free
Like ring-worm
She gets up and stalks out
Sidney glances through the glass partition and sees  walking past
47
( ) The gloves are coming off
We hear the opening of Brigitte Bardot's Moi Je Joue as we
55
-  55 Sidney is pitching to Clayton in the elevator
Okay
Celebrity Trash Cans
The contents of celebrity trash cans are revealed and readers have gotta guess who the trash belongs to
Five bottles of Jack Daniels, a court order, and a copy of Mein Kampf
Mel Gibson

First room

-  56 small group of  pass the immense line of hopefuls waiting outside the club and are ushered inside by the  at the entrance
Sidney walks confidently up, pretending to talk into his cell
The Doorman stands in his way, impassive
Still talking Sidney turns and walks away as if nothing has happened

Morgan Freeman
No, not
why's everyone say
There

From under the door slides a piece of paper on which is written First Room

The Doorman crumples the bill up and throws it away
Without a word Sidney begins to walk away
He comes back and picks up the crumpled note and then heads off again

He looks up and finds Sidney staring down at him with puppy-dog eyes

Harding sighs
If  give you an interview will ya leave me the fuck alone
Sidney smiles
The song ends
61
-  61 Nathan Lane shakes hands with Sidney as he sits down
Nathan Lane
Nice to meet you
Great to meet you Nathan
'm a big fan
love that rat thing you played in The Lion King
() Actually he's a meer cat
(absently, checking his ) Uhuh
Now, 've been doing some research and  think you're probably quite a private man
Am right
Well
49
Which is fine, but today,  think it would be great to get behind the mask
() Uh,  don't think there really is a mask as such, and  don't wanna be a pain, but what  really wanna talk about is the new play, keep it about the work, you know
Is that okay
Absolutely
Of course
So, first question - are you Jewish
Nathan stares at Sidney
don't see what the relevance of that is
Okay
Next question
The rat thing - that's gotta be Disney's first gay animal, right
So, was wondering - are you a homosexual
Beat
Nathan looks like he might hit Sidney
62
'  -  62 Clayton glares at Sidney from behind his desk
What did  say to you
What
What did  say to you
just
What did  say to you
Don't upset anyone
Don't upset anyone
50
was just trying to
probe
You wanna probe become a proctologist, okay
You can't ask musical comedy stars whether they're Jewish or gay
From now on just assume they're all Jewish and all gay, okay
63
-  63 Sidney is on the phone
He has been idly applying magic tape to his face, contorting it into a grotesque grimace
The headline of a magazine open in front of him reads: "Everyone Loves  Lord: Why British Titles Drive New York Women Crazy
" 'd like to apply for an American Express card please
(Beat) Hon
Sidney Young
(Beat) As in Honourable

(Beat)It's a British title
Across the desk Alison watches him with contempt
(') The Queen
Yeah,  know the Queen
Just fill in the form will you
Sidney suddenly notices Sophie Maes and Eleanor Johnson walking towards them
Sophie looks more  than before
She is holding her Chihuahua, Cuba, which is dressed in a tiny coat
Sidney
We hear a as he yanks the tape off his face
(
)(') (in pain, under desk) Oh, fuck
( ) Hey
Cuba
He pets the dog, who greets him enthusiastically
( ) He likes you
( ) Well, 'm one of the Friends Of Cuba

He laughs, Sophie smiles, not getting it
Alison seems immersed in some paper-work
(') So how's it feel to be a star
No, don't
It's so embarrassing
That picture's everywhere now
And  had no idea the dress was so see-through
And people are talking like it was some kind of stunt
() Such a cynical age
Hello Sidney
Embarrassed, Sidney gets up from under his desk
Hello
Didn't, didn't know you were coming in
Lawrence is taking us to lunch at Cipriani
() Oh great
That's great
Lawrence
Could  leave Cuba here
He doesn't like Italian food
Of course you can
He can stay in my office
Sidney
Fetch Cuba a bowl of water, will you
Sidney stares at him
(forcing a smile) Of course
64 - 64 Eleanor is getting a cup of water from the cooler
Sidney joins her, waiting to fill the dog's bowl
That is a lovely ring
Where is that from
52
Sidney looks at the wedding ring he wears on his little finger
() It was my mother's
She gave it to me
() Oh, you Sweetie
That is very, very
(dismissing the topic) So, listen
You've met Vincent Lepak haven't you, Sidney
Uhuh
He has a new movie coming out soon and Lawrence is over- stretched as it is
How would you like to write a story on him
Alison, at the photocopier nearby, listens
Sidney smiles, filled with hope
story
Absolutely
That would
'd love to
() Well, great
Maybe we could get together and discuss the angle
Okay
(Beat) What do you mean
Well, 'd need to know how we're going to present Vincent, check the story, so on
() You want copy approval
() Any stories written about my clients need to be in their best interest, that's all
If things work out with Vincent we could maybe talk about a follow up story on Sophie
What do you think
Alison listens, her face registering her distaste
53
Sidney looks over at Sophie, struggling with himself
Finally
() 'm sorry, Eleanor,  don't don't work that way
Alison stares with surprise at Sidney
He just went up in her estimation
() Sidney dear, think of it like this: you write about one of my clients, you are borrowing some of their "star-light" to help sell your magazine
All 'm saying is quid pro quo
Sidney is unable to hold back a snicker
Their star-light
Eleanor's face hardens
65   65 Sidney watches Sophie, Maddox and Eleanor as they walk towards reception
66
'  -  66 Sidney cracks open the door and peers inside
Cuba sits in the middle of the floor, staring at him
He emits a low growl
Sidney slides into the room
Hello Cuba
'm Uncle Sidney, come to see how you are
You wanna play
You wanna little play
He takes a   out of his pocket and holds it up for the dog to see
(') Fetch
He tosses the ball in the air
Cuba runs after it and trots back, stumpy tail wagging, the ball in its teeth
(') That's it
That's it
54
He strokes the dog
(') We're gonna be best pals aren't we
You're going to like me more than that prick Maddox, aren't you
Fetch
He tosses the ball again which promptly bounces off the wall straight out of the half open window
(') No
Cuba is already running towards the window
Sidney's yell slows and distorts as we move to Sidney springs forward, leaping onto the desk and then in one bound onto a   by the window, sending it rocking slightly forward
Cuba, bounding forward, jumps into the air
Sidney just manages to slam the window  as
Cuba bounces off the glass with a yelp and drops to the floor
Sidney heaves a sigh of relief
Then a   on the tilted filing cabinet slides forward and drops with a
Silence

That's my bag

What are you talking about
Give it back
She reaches out to take the bag

Stop it
Give me the
She tugs violently, pulling the bag open

Startled, Sidney darts into Maddox's office
67A
'  -  67A As footsteps and voices approach Sidney tugs wildly at Maddox's window, trying to open it
Alison follows him in
What are you doing
You can't
He jerks the window open and empties Cuba out of it, slamming it shut just as Sophie, Eleanor and Lawrence walk in
Alison, have you seen Cuba
56
() -What
She darts a glance over to where Sidney stands with his back to the window, gazing at her pleadingly
From behind him comes a faint creaking sound
() Sophie's dog
Have you seen him
Sidney hangs his head, awaiting the coup de grace
Uh
no
No idea
Sidney stares at her in amazement
Behind him Cuba's body appears at the window, rising into view on a
Window Washer, stands at the other end of the cradle, bobbing his head to the music in his headphones
Alison stares at the dog in horror while the others talk, oblivious
Don't worry, he couldn't have got very far
() Cuba
Cuba
Cuba trundles on up to the sky
68
'  -  68 Clayton stands at the window
He is
There is a knock at the door and Sidney walks in
() Clayton
Have you got a minute
Clayton lights a cigarette, stares out of the window
Sidney comes in
Did they find that rat yet
No
Not yet
think maybe he got out the building
Sidney hovers
57
(') Congratulations on the Man of the Year thing
How was the lunch
don't know
Thousand dollars a plate, all  could taste was ass
'm kissing their ass, they're kissing my ass
(Beat)  get this dream sometimes
Someone's set fire to the building - Heywoods - Sharps magazine - the whole thing, it's going up in flames
My analyst thinks it's an anxiety dream
never tell him how happy am watching the fucker burn
Sidney isn't sure what to say
Finally
(') What do you want
Sidney takes a deep breath
want to do a story on Vincent Lepak
Not a puff-piece
Something funny, but with teeth
The kind of thing Snipe would have done
Everyone's treating him like he's a genius and he's an idiot
Clayton notices the - beside him and opens it
He stares at the rows of blue shirts hanging in there
He takes an armful out and examines them
Look at these things
How'd  get a closet full of blue fucking shirts
Um
don't know
don't know either
This is an office for Christ's sake
Why've even got a fucking closet
He drops the shirts
(') Do it
(he can't believe it) Do it
58
Fuck it
Yeah
Do it
He's an annoying little prick
Go take him down
This is your shot
Thanks Clayton
You're my little Hit Man

Go do it

He scuttles out
He ducks back around the door

He ducks back out again

-  69 Sidney is waiting in the lobby
slightly spaced approaches him
Mister Young
Yes
'm Sophie Maes' assistant
'm afraid Sophie isn't here right now
(looking past her) Look  know she's in
'm not a stalker
just know she's upset about losing her dog and
59
() She isn't here
() Well, can  at least check that she got my present
Okay
Did you send the flowers
( ) Flowers
Yeah,'cos she doesn't get enough flowers, does she
No, sent her the fish
The Young Woman looks suddenly nervous
Oh
Gold-fish
In a bowl
Did she get them
Yes, but
they were dead
() All of them
Yeah
It was kinda shocking
Were they dead when you sent them
Sidney stares at her
What
No, they were
Who sends people dead fish
() The Mafia
70
-  70 Alison sits at the bar, staring at her notebook, a pen held in her hand
sits on the bar beside her
Sidney slides onto the stool beside her
She looks up and sees he is holding a glass bowl of water with three dead fish in it
60
My God, you're like a serial killer
This wasn't me
(Beat)
laid him to rest
Cuba  mean
took him over to
() don't want to know
Alison checks the door, looking for someone, a little uncomfortable
Okay
(Beat) Well,  just just wanted to say
about not telling them
really appreciated it
It was good of you and, and
you know
not many people would, uh
He stops, tongue-tied
Alison takes pity on him
It's okay
() Why didn't you
Alison sighs
You don't need my help to screw up here, Sidney
mean, the only things you make are mistakes and stains
The  arrives, stares at the bowl of fish disapprovingly
Can  help you
(following his gaze) Just a couple of straws please
Stony-faced, the Barman walks off
Despite herself, Alison smiles
Sidney smiles back
He notices Alison's  on the bar
(') Can  ask you something
How come you've always got the notebook
Is it a diary or something
Am in it
61
It's
it's a novel 'm working on, alright
Wow
Go ahead
know
'm a walking cliche
No - a novel, that's
that's pretty impressive
You're writing it by hand
Yeah, it
don't know
It keeps it separate from the magazine work
Makes it seem special
He stares at her
You're full of surprises, Sister
Suddenly he notices the White Russian beside them
(') So
you waiting for your boyfriend
() Uh, yeah, so
What's he do, the mystery guy
Is he a hack too
() Actually he's a poet
Really
What's he look like
() What
Just most poets you see aren't really good-looking, are they
Spend their time stuck in a room, end up looking like Golem
Is he
He's very handsome, thank you
62
() Right
You know what  don't understand
You're desperate to get a story in the magazine - so why wouldn't you play ball with Eleanor, write the puff-piece
resent being bribed to gush sycophantically about a star, okay
choose to gush sycophantically
Alison stares at Sidney trying to figure him out
(') It's okay anyway
Clayton's given me a story
'm on my way
() Well, that's good
Sidney smiles back at her
They look at each other
it's almost the start of a
Then suddenly on the  above the bar, a begins
Distracted Sidney turns to watch - it's Sophie Maes' new film - The Suffragette - Sophie, a glamorous Emily Pankhurst
Sidney looks back to Alison but she has turned away, suddenly awkward
() Okay, well
better get going
(Leaving) You take my advice, you'll get yourself a boyfriend who's going to show up once in a while
He leaves
Beat
Alison stares at the empty stool beside her
71
-  71 Clayton is rounding up another staff meeting
Sidney sits trying to contain his excitement
Which makes it
a half page left
Lawrence
Any ideas
63
Yeah
Rachel Petkoff, fabulous sixties actress, one of my all time favourites
Just made a wonderful movie called Five Boroughs
think she's poised for a come-back and  think we should get there first, do a profile
Sidney stares at him in disbelief
He looks over to Alison who avoids his gaze
Sounds good
Let's do it
Okay that's it people
Uh
Clayton
What
Did you read my story on Vincent Lepak
Clayton frowns down at some papers, feigning distraction
What
Oh, yeah
That's
that's not going to work
Sidney can't believe it
Clayton gets up to leave
(') Oh, and for those who haven't heard, Alison is going to be running the  Spy section from now on as Lawrence here has just gone up in the world
He is replacing Greg Roberts as Deputy Editor
Lawrence smiles modestly as the room applauds
Sidney looks like he is going to implode
72
-  72 Maddox passes Sidney in the corridor
Sidney glares after him
Suddenly
Rachel Petkoff
One of your favourite actresses
You'd never fucking heard of her
That was my idea
Lawrence stops and turns back
64
So it was
You have any more good ideas don't forget to bring them to my new office
He is about to walk on but remembers something
(') By the way, there've been complaints about you skulking around the water-cooler, trying to talk to women
It's inappropriate behaviour
() What
You spend half your life chatting up the staff
When  do it it's called flirting
When you do it it's called sexual harassment
Consider this an official warning
won't tolerate sexist behaviour
He walks off
Sidney glowers after him
73
'  -  73 Lawrence is holding a meeting in his new office - half a dozen heads of departments sit around drinking coffee
Lawrence sits behind his desk, enjoying his new authority
know that wasn't Greg's way of working but Greg isn't deputy editor any more
am, and 'm making changes
There is a knock at the door and Sidney walks in with an attractive   in a long coat and dark glasses
(') What
Uh, Lawrence
This lady's been looking for you
(to the woman) Can  help you
Are you Lawrence Maddox
The new deputy editor
65
Yes
Well, 've just come to say congratulations on your promotion
() Thank you
'm sorry, you are
'm your present
The Woman produces a Beat-Box from behind her back and switches it on
She drops her coat to reveal underwear and stockings underneath
Maddox stares in frozen horror as the  dances over to him, removing her bra
74  - '  -  74 Very Well-Dressed Middle-Aged Woman knocks on the door and enters
Hey Mrs Harding
Two Impeccably-Dressed Little Girls follow Mrs Harding into the room
(') Oh my God
So adorable
(to the Little Girls) And this is the Fashion Department
[To Ingrid] Where's Mr Maddox now
Oh he's down the hall
Room 217
75
'  -  75 The staff are staring transfixed as the stripper gyrates her breasts, whirling
(with mock horror) Uh, Lawrence
This is
this is sort of inappropriate isn't it
() Will you please
66
His words are muffled by the bra the stripper drapes over his face
Gleefully, Sidney dances in the background
He produces a camera and starts to snap away
Oh God, this is
this is awful
76  76 77
'  -  77 The Stripper, who we suddenly realise is in a blonde wig, whips off his/her panties
There is a collective gasp from the room
Sidney can't stop laughing
Suddenly he notices everyone in the room is now staring at the door
He turns to see Mrs Harding and her girls standing, shell-shocked, in the doorway
Alarmed, Sidney side-steps in towards Bob
- ' Bob, impressive breasts bared, stands staring back at us
Sidney, in the absence of anything else to shield him with, is  '
The rest of the staff stare at us, rabbits caught in headlights
After a beat Lawrence peers around Sidney, a rictus smile on his face
Hello, Mrs Harding
Girls
78
'  -  78 Sidney sits waiting, obsessively cleaning his hand with a wet-wipe
Through the glass partition we can see Clayton and Eleanor Johnson in the office
They are apparently discussing a mock-up of a new cover for Sharps
After a moment Eleanor comes out of the office and sweeps past Sidney without a glance
Clayton appears in the doorway
( ) Get in
79
'  -   79 Sidney sits in front of Clayton
didn't know it was Take Our Daughters To Work Day
didn't even know there was a Take Our daughters To Work Day
67
Shut up
(Beat) You know, when told my wife 'd hired another Brit, she was excited
She still thinks you're all like something from Pride and Prejudice
But you Sidney
you're like a British person born in New Jersey
(Shaking his head) Why did  hire you
Sidney stares at his feet
Suddenly
don't know - why did you hire me
had an attack of nostalgia
It's passed
Like gas
What was wrong with my story
What
Why did you kill my Vincent Lepak story
It wasn't good enough
Plain and simple
It wasn't good enough
We don't do hatchet jobs here
It isn't a hatchet job
This opening quotation - "It's only too easy to catch people's attention by doing something worse than anyone else has dared do it before
" Who are you thinking of here
Vincent or yourself
He's a talentless, pretentious little twat who thinks cinema began with Tarantino and someone needs to say it
And you told me to do something with teeth
You said
68
'm trying to run a fucking magazine here
Sidney stares at him, angry and disappointed
" free press is the last defence against the Tyranny of Stupidity
" () Save me your tin-pot philosophy, okay
It isn't mine
It's yours
First issue of Snipe
() Oh, grow the fuck up, will ya
You're not Robin Hood and you never were
You bitch about famous people for the same reason bitched about them
Because they got invited to the Party and you didn't
Well you're at the Party now so quit bitching and do your job
You're on your last life here, you understand
One more fuck up like today and you're gone
Won't you have to run a decision like that past Eleanor first
For a second Clayton looks like he might throw his ashtray at Sidney
Then he controls himself
( ) Get out
Sidney crosses to the door
(he can't help himself) Looks like  was too late to save you after all
He walks out
80
-  -  80 Sidney walks back through the magazine's open plan area
- stop whatever they're doing and watch him pass in silence
Then, slowly, one of them begins to
69
Someone else joins in
Then someone else
Soon they're all clapping
Someone gets up on their desk, then another
Sidney smiles faintly then
out of  -
Everyone around him is working as always, paying him no attention
81
'  -   -  81 We are  through Magazine Staff, celebrities, politicians and children as they mill about the lawns of the sprawling mansion, enjoying the Fourth Of July celebrations which are in progress
Clayton greets guests - the perfect host
We find Sidney, wearing unfashionable shorts, socks and shoes
He is talking to Alison
You hired a stripper
didn't "hire" him
Bob did it for a favour
thought you wanted to be a success here
do
It's just
(ruefully) It wasn't me
It was Clark
Alison laughs
The famous alter-ego
How long's he been hanging around
Since  was a kid
Anytime something got broken, or the bathroom got accidentally set on fire - it wasn't me
It was Clark
(Beat
) The weird thing is, he kind of took over
How old were you
don't know, twenty, twenty one
Alison laughs
70
') Well, let me tell you, if only you could get rid of that Clark, you could be a real winner
() Clayton's not going to print anything  write
've been on salary for six-months and 've written precisely one hundred and seventy five words
On a dollar- per-word basis, 'm the highest paid writer in the history of this magazine
(Beat) He's not going to renew my contract
() What did you expect, Sidney
Vincent's one of Eleanor's clients
told you
They're Untouchables
thought Clayton was different
really did
(Beat) The only thing 'm good at is pissing people off, and he won't let me do it
(Beat) "My glory walks hand in hand with my doom
" (Off her look) Troy Troy who
Troy, the movie
He stares around him at the other guests
(') Everybody hates me here
You're the only one who'll talk to me
You cornered me
(a little embarrassed) No,  mean it
You're the person who's been most, you know
uh
abusive to me
Alison laughs again
They smile at each other
(') You want another drink
71
(beat, smiling) Alright
'll have a beer
Sidney walks off
82
-  82 Sidney is getting a drink at the bar that has been set up in the grounds
Suddenly he stiffens, watching as Sophie Maes, looking spectacular, walks over to where Maddox and his circle are talking nearby
Sophie, my darling
Looking ravishing as always
Whilst the two are engaged in kissing cheeks, Sidney takes a credit card from his wallet and drops it surreptitiously by Sophie's feet
( ) You know what  read the other day
Your collection of poems - The Hollow Heart
Man, they're great
Sidney reacts to this, feeling troubled for some reason
You write poems
In another life
The  is handing out drinks
And a White Russian
Right here
Sidney stares at the drink, feeling like he's just been punched in the stomach
Maddox notices him
(') Well, well, if it isn't Sidalee
Maddox notices the card at Sophie's feet
(') (picking it up) What's this
"Hon Young"
That's
that's mine
72
But your name's not "Hon"
(reaching for it) It's short for "Honourable"
(whisking it away) As in, "the Honourable Sidney Young"
Can  please
(holding it out of ' ) So how come it says "Hon Young"
They made you sound like some Korean medical student
The people gathered around laugh
They screwed it up
Please
Sidney baby, you don't wanna go faking a British title to impress Sophie
It's the Fourth of July
(Handing back the card): We're celebrating the fact that we threw a bunch of British aristocrats out
Sidney smiles tightly
Suddenly
Why don't you shut up, Maddox
Beat
The others look to Maddox to see how he will react
Maddox smiles dangerously
Careful Sidney
Remember - if it wasn't for us you'd all be speaking German
You're Canadian
If it wasn't for us you'd be speaking French
Sophie giggles
Maddox doesn't like this but before he can answer Sidney walks off
73
83
-  -  83 Alison is about to walk into the bathroom when she hears the sound of muffled sobbing and stops
She peers through the slightly open door
- Elizabeth Maddox stands at the mirror, staring at her reflection
For once she is not wearing her dark glasses and we can see her eyes are red raw from crying
84    84 Elizabeth walks out of the bathroom, dark glasses back in place, her face a mask once more
She walks off
Alison slips out from a nearby room and watches her go, miserable with guilt
85
-  85 Sidney is staring over to where Alison and Maddox are standing by some trees, deep in conversation
Maddox is tossing nuts into the air and catching them in his mouth
(muttering to himself) Choke
Choke
He puts his fingers to his temples as if to channel telekinetic powers
(') Choke
choke
Sidney realizes Harding's wife is passing with her two daughters
(') Hello, Mrs Harding
Lovely party
With a look of alarm she shepherds the girls away
tall older man dressed in white with a long white beard appears next to Sidney
How are you
Sidney nods gloomily
(') Has anyone ever told you before that you have an unusually dark aura
Yup
74
You should walk with bare feet as much as possible, ground all that negative energy
Sidney examines him
So
you're a wizard or
'm a spiritual healer
You can make a living doing that
Oh God no
'm a dentist
They stare at the party for a moment
(') You want to do some coke
Um
no, thanks
86  86 Rachel Petkoff stands talking to some other guests
Sidney notices her and walks over
Hey
Hello again
Rachel smiles at him distantly, clearly not remembering him
Hello
(Turning back to the others) No, Lawrence is a wonderful writer
really felt like he got to the heart of me
Sidney snorts
Rachel turns back to him, faintly irritated
(') 'm sorry, have we
Sidney
Sidney Young
We met at
Another  walks past Sidney and kisses Rachel
saw Five Boroughs the other day and wept
75
Sidney hovers for a moment, ignored, and then walks away
87  87 Dusk
The guests have gathered on the lawns to watch the fireworks
There are oohs and aahs as the rockets light up the sky
Suddenly
(
) In-ger-lernd
Puzzled the guests turn to where a drunk Sidney is standing on the balustrade of the porch of the house
(') In-ger-lernd
In-ger-lerrrrrrnd
He spots   amongst the crowd, watching him, puzzled
(') You
Grant
Come on
In-ger- lerrrr
With that he slips from the balustrade and crashes into the shrubbery below
88  88 Sidney limps through the trees, dabbing at a scratch on his face
He passes Alison who is sitting on a tree-swing, lost in thought, swigging absently from a bottle of wine
You okay
What
said are you okay
'm fine
Yup
Fine
(Beat) You
Yup
(Beat) No, actually
hate my life so, you know, 'm gonna get drunk
Sidney nods, vaguely
They stand in awkward silence for a moment
Then
Right
See you
He walks off

He walks back into frame suddenly

That's why 've broken up with him
Well, that's no

(Beat) You broke up with him
Alison walks off
Beat
She walks back
Which leg did you hurt
() This one
Alison kicks the leg
(') She walks off again
89
-  89 Sidney lies beside the pool staring darkly into the water and nursing the beginnings of a hangover
We hear faint music and laughter from where the party continues in the house behind
He notices the reflection of the starry sky in the water and reaching out gloomily to hold one of the stars
The reflection dissolves into ripples
When the water settles Sophie Maes reflection stares back at him
77
She's drunk and a good deal of the movie star mystique seems to have evaporated
You know what
There's something very damaged about you
Sidney stares at her, not sure what to say
Huh
Sophie lies down beside the pool, plays with a strand of her hair
Like an animal that's been hit by a car or something
Like a deer or
like a pig maybe
When they walk funny and the other animals keep away from them
Little limpy pig
'm drawn to sick animals
That's why  picked Cuba - because he had like psychological problems
(Her eyes well with tears) Poor little Cuba
Where is he now
() Huh
She wipes her eyes, rolls onto her back
Jesus, 'm wasted
Are you wasted
'm wasted
Sidney watches her
Congratulations on becoming incredibly famous by the way
Thanks
() What's it like
What's what like
Everything
She rolls her head to look at him solemnly
78
Weird
It's happening so fast and
it's like it's got nothing to do with me
It's like 'm not even really here
She laughs softly
(') Am  here
You're here
She turns back to look at the stars
'm so hungry
Would you
would you like me to get you some food
Are you crazy
There might still be a photographer around
They lie in silence for a moment
(') () You know what would be nice though
Some coke
She rubs her face, close to falling asleep
(') Probably just as well  haven't got any
Coke always makes me so horny
Sidney opens his mouth but cannot speak
90
90 through the groups of people chatting outside the house
(out of breath) Wizard
Wizard Dentist Man
Need Wizard Dentist Man
91  91 Sidney has virtually dragged the Dentist out of his car
He is handing Sidney a wrap
79
will never, never, never forget this
Thank you
He starts to hurry away
92   92 Alison is weaving unsteadily towards the driveway
Sidney hurries past then slows and stops, staring back at her
93 '  93 Alison stands rooting in her purse for a tip to give the who is holding open the door of her car for her, the engine running
What are you doing
None of your business
You can't drive
You need to go and sleep this off somewhere
Firstly, you are a stupid asshole and  hate you and Secondly
Secondly
She muses on what she was going to say next
Sidney looks over his shoulder, imagining Sophie waiting for him
(') Secondly
Yeah, okay
Listen, you try driving in this state you're gonna kill yourself
Who'd care if  did
Beat
Suddenly she bursts into tears
Surprised, Sidney stands, uncertain what to do
(') ( ) 've got to go
Got to go
Sidney holds her to stop her falling
He stares back at the pool and then down at Alison
80
94
'  -  -  94 Sidney is driving
Alison is still drunk
() thought  had it all figured out
- get the hell out of Port Huron, come to New York
- do the serious journalism thing to pay the bills while , you know, write the novel
- Win a Pulitzer
-  don't know what  was
Then took the internship at Sharps and  met Maddox and he was
he was so
and before  know it 'm writing, you know, Ten Tips for the fucking Metrosexual and pretending this is what  wanted but this ' what  wanted
And that's
that's why  hated you
didn't know you hated me
() because you were right about me
'm a ghoul, writing fluff
You're not a Ghoul
You're a Zombie
Alison leans her head against the window
But he isn't the person you think he is, okay
Maddox
That's just a front
He thinks he's let himself down by giving up the poetry and he's unhappy
And the marriage is a sham,  mean just
couldn't end it
just couldn't and
(can't take anymore) Look,  don't need to hear this
() Fine
81
She begins to root through her bag
(') Need a cigarette
Where are my fucking cigarettes
You don't smoke
Oh yeah
She looks at her reflection in the window
(') Do you think  have low self- esteem
Am  afraid of a real relationship
Do  think an affair is all  deserve
mean, okay, he's handsome and successful and he's great in bed
() Could you just be quiet
He realises she has started to cry
When  told him  couldn't see him any more
don't know if he cared
love him and, and don't know if he cares
Sidney watches, moved
() Well, 'm
'm sure he does
He's probably just not very good at expressing his emotions
() 'm so fucking sophisticated mean there's not even a little bit of Port Huron left, right
've got the haircut and the job and 've got the parties and 've even, 've even got the affair because that's what sophisticated fucking people do
Alright
Alright
Don't, you know, get snot everywhere
Oh -God

What
Alison lurches down out of sight and is sick on Sidney's shorts
95

Shaking her) Alison
Alison snores loudly
Sidney sighs
96
'  -  96 Sidney staggers up the stairs carrying Alison over his shoulder
Alison is moaning
() Shut up will you
You'll wake the old witch up
He stops suddenly and turns
Mrs Kowalski glowers at him from the doorway
Sidney freezes - a sickly smile on his face
(') Did
Did we wake you

An   appears behind Mrs Kowalski staring at Sidney
Long Beat

97
'  -  -  97 Sidney, Mrs Kowalski and Sidney's father -   - sit drinking coffee

Sidney seems to have almost physically shrunk in the presence of his father
Some music is playing in the next room
Alison dances drunkenly past the doorway, wearing Sidney's jacket
83
(as she goes by) Love this song
The three stare after her
Sidney coughs
She, uh, she isn't actually a prostitute
() Oh good
Alison dances back into the room
Sooo, Sidney's dad
Good to meet you

My dad married again too, so that's cool

Okay
Where are my cigarettes
(feeling in the pocket of the jacket) What is that
She produces the wrap of coke that the elderly man had given Sidney
(') Oh, hey, is that
She stops herself
Everyone stares at the wrap
think it is probably cocaine
Sidney closes his eyes
It wasn't actually for me
was going to give it to this young actress
He realises this isn't helping and trails off
84
() So, hey, visiting your boy
That's nice
You must be pretty proud of him, huh
() think you should lie down Alison
He's doing just great at the magazine
Alison ruffles Sidney's hair clumsily
(') First we all thought he was kinda creepy because he was always hanging around the water-cooler, hitting on women
Really Alison,  think
But  think that was pretty much an act
So, Mister Sidney, whatcha doing here
() Please, call me Richard
've written a little book so 'm doing a few talks

Hey - 'm writing a book
What's yours about
Don't tell me - it's a thriller, right

Sidney avoids her eye
85

Alison snorts with laughter
What would Sidney know about philosophy
Well, he does have a Masters in the subject
Alison stares at Sidney
She breaks into a snorting laugh again
You're shitting me
Sidney
He

She stops laughing, hit by a sudden wave of nausea

Mrs Kowalski stands up
Come on
It is time you went to bed

Okay
Better go before  find out something else  don't know about Sidney

It was a pleasure to meet you Lord Young
Alison stares at Sidney who smiles weakly

You should have said you were coming
86

Which reminds me,  was talking to a publisher friend of mine the other day
He mentioned that they were planning a series of introductory texts on philosophers
wondered if you would be interested

Of course, of course
picked up a copy of your magazine at the airport
Sidney stiffens a little
(') Most enjoyable
(Beat) particularly liked the young Hollywood actress who said she'd like to start her theatre career "somewhere small, like London or England
" () Why've you always got to do this
It's
it's
It was just a joke Sidney
Actually it's not
Because you're saying that what  do for a living is worthless and

She lies asleep on the bed, moonlight bathing her face
She looks beautiful
Sidney stands staring at her for a moment and then tip-toes back out of the room
100  -  100 Sidney is cooking, humming, happy that Alison is here
Alison walks in, feeling dreadful
don't remember very much but 'm so, so sorry
'll get myself together and get going
Why
No, you're all right
It's
it's nice to have the company
() Oh God
your father
And that woman
Mrs Kowalski
Don't worry about it
The last woman she caught me with had a penis, so you know
you're a big step up
Thanks
89
She notices a black and white photograph of a glamorous on the shelf
We recognise her as the woman on the at the beginning of the film
(') Who's that
() That's my mother
No way
Yeah,  don't take after her
Was she a model
Actress
Wow
Movies
Some
British, small parts
Is she
No, she died when  was young
Without thinking he fiddles with the ring on his finger
Must have been pretty cool having your mom in the movies
Yeah,  suppose
used to see her on the  every now and then when  was growing up
Sort of weird
He carries the plates over to her
(') Here we go
English fry-up
Perfect hangover cure
Sidney puts a plate of bacon, eggs and sausages in front of her
Alison stares at it, going green
Suddenly she darts from the room
90
101   -  101 Sidney is tidying
He upsets Alison's bag from the couch and its contents spill onto the floor - the  is amongst them
Sidney stares at it, hesitates and then, unable to resist, opens it up and starts to read
Alison walks into the room
Sidney looks up guiltily
Sorry,  was just
uh
(He can't think of an excuse) rooting through your private possessions
Alison sits on the couch, feeling too ill to be annoyed
(') like the opening
You do
do
Can  read the rest of it
Believe it or not, 'm a pretty good editor
don't know
don't even know if 'm going to bother finishing it
"Keep true to the dreams of thy youth
" Alison examines him through narrowed eyes
Is that from Troy again
Schiller
She puts her things back in her bag
'll jump in the shower and then really will get out of your hair
Sidney watches, not wanting her to go
Oh,  forgot
got you a present
91
He hands her a bag
Surprised she opens it and takes out a It's the Nino Rota sound-track to La Dolce Vita
(') was just walking past this music shop on the corner and saw it
thought it might cheer you up
Alison is deeply touched
That's
don't know what to say
(Beat)  haven't got a turntable
Oh
(Beat) Well, you can always come here to listen to it
Sidney takes the record and puts it on the turntable in the corner of the room
He selects the finale music - it's funny and sad, glamorous and romantic
They listen to it for a moment
Sidney starts to dance a little
He cha-cha's over to her and holds out his hand
Are you kidding
could throw up on you again
'mon
Alison reluctantly gets up
They dance ironically
Alison laughs a little
Gradually they get more into it, enjoying the music - a man in shorts and a woman in pyjamas, cha-cha-chaing, a summer breeze wafting in the through the open windows behind him
: 102
-  102 Some weeks later
Alison sits at her desk, trying to work
She looks up and catches Maddox watching her with soulful eyes from across the room
She looks quickly away, unsettled
Sidney sits at his desk surreptitiously watching her, 92
103
-  103 Autumn
Rain lashes against the window
Alison drinks coffee
Ingrid and Anna are examining a rack of clothes behind her
Ingrid is holding up a dress
Hey, Alice
Versace
You like
'm good, thanks
Honey, everyone needs to change their look every now and then
Especially if they have a new man in their life
() What are you talking about
104    104 Sidney is just about to enter the room
(
) Well, that English guy is always hanging around you these days, right
Sidney freezes, listening
105   105 Alison blushes fiercely
() Tell me it isn't so
() Of course not
Thank God
Can you imagine
He's such a creep
106    106 Sidney listens sadly to the women laughing inside
93
107   107 Alison stares at the Fashionistas, annoyed by this
Oblivious, Anna holds up some trousers against herself
These are gorgeous, but 'm just too fat
Oh don't be crazy
Alice
Is Anna fat
() Not at all
Why, she's so thin could just take her little spindly body and snap it over my knee like a dry fucking twig
() Thanks
Oh, and for your information Sidney Young has got more going for him than most of the men in this town
She gets up to leave, the others gawping after her
108    108 Sidney gives a slow smile of wonder - she likes him
Suddenly he realises Alison is about to walk out the door and catch him listening
Panicking he opens the nearest door and runs in, falling straight down a short flight of stairs and out of sight
Alison walks out of the room and away, oblivious
109
'  -  109 - On Sidney, staring at us
Hey Alison,  was wondering if you wanted to
(Beat
Starting again) Hello there
Listen  was wondering if you wanted to see a movie or
a meal
or
(Beat, starting again
) Alison
You wanna go on a date
We see he is staring at his reflection in a mirror
He slips in a pair of   and smiles toothily
94
110  -   110 The    is in full swing - guests dancing in fancy dress
Sidney, dressed as Dracula, threads through the crowd
He spots Alison on the other side of the room, dressed as
He starts to make his way towards her, a little nervous
He passes   and
Vincent wears all black and his shades
like your costume Vincent
'm not wearing a costume
Oh
They walk on
() Idiot
() Wanker
Sidney continues through the crowd to Alison
He puts his Dracula  in
(') Haven't we met somewhere before
That's why  don't go there any more
They smile, but Alison seems a little nervous
(') 've been looking for you actually
There's, uh, there's something  need to
(Mumbling through his ) Me first
Listen  was wondering if you want to go to the movies or maybe for a, uh
() What
can't understand what you're saying
95
Sidney pulls the plastic fangs out
Sorry
was just saying
Maddox appears and gives Alison a glass of champagne
He kisses her
Back in a minute
He walks off again
Sidney stares dumbly after him
() wanted to tell you
Lawrence has left his wife
We're going to be together
Officially
She watches for Sidney's reaction
() Well
that's
that's brilliant
Yeah, so
maybe he does care after all, right
Yup
They stand in an awkward silence, watching the party
111
-  111 dejected Sidney stands washing his hands
Maddox walks in behind him
Hello Sidney
Someone said you'd come as a Count but  thought 'd misheard
Sidney doesn't answer, turns to leave
(') So Alison told you we were getting together right
() Yeah
Yeah
Should have done it long ago but, you know me - just not very good at expressing my emotions
Right
96
He watches Sidney's reaction, smirking
(') You must be happy for her, what with you being friends
Sidney blushes
(') () Oh Sidalee
thought as much
Did you really think you and Alison
Things really haven't worked out too well for you here, have they
Ah, well
You gave it your best shot
He walks out
Sidney stares after him, burning
112
-  112 Rain pours down
Eleanor and Vincent climb into a limousine and close the door
Sidney runs up
Wait
Eleanor wait
The window glides down
Yes
Let me do the profile on Vincent
() don't think so
The window begins to slide up
Sidney hangs onto it
You get full copy approval
It'll be like you've written it
The window stops
Eleanor stares at him, considering
Sidney looks past her to Vincent
(') () Vincent - think about it, think how humiliating it will be for me
'm begging you
Vincent leans over, stares over his shades at Sidney
97
(Beat, enjoying this) You don't look like you're begging
Beat
Sidney kneels down on the side-walk beside the limousine
The rain pours down on him
The limousine drives away
Sidney stares dumbly up at something across the street
On the building across the street is an '  -  , in a gold ball-gown and make-up, hair coiffured in classic forties Hollywood style
As we watch she
Underneath is the slogan - 'm Here

So he's gone
So's Alison Olsen
Sidney stares at him
(') Don't worry about Maddox
He's already lined up something with Gotham Magazine
'm gonna need someone to hold the fort at Spy
Strictly on a temporary basis, you understand
One more thing
Eleanor Johnson rang this morning, wondering if you'd like to write a profile on Vincent Lepak
Sidney stares at him

Alison sits alone reading Sharps, staring at Sidney's photo in the "Notes on Contributors" page
She smiles, then glances up, her smile fading
Maddox is walking towards her, drunk and sour faced

Anderson wants me to go to some photographers exhibition
Hot new talent blah, blah

Alison stares at him sadly guess you're right
(Quietly) What goes around comes around
Maddox is about to say something but changes his mind
'll see you back home
He is about to leave when he notices Alison's notebook on the table
(') () And will you stop carrying that thing around with you
It's kind of embarrassing
He walks off

-  128 Sidney is with Eleanor and Sophie, who now looks every inch the movie star
Sophie's going to get a Golden Globe nomination for best actress
Wow
That's fantastic
(Beat) But
the nominations haven't been announced yet
101
That is correct so we have absolutely no way of knowing whether or not she will be nominated
(Beat) So, if she is nominated we want Sharps to do a feature
Someone to cover the whole lead up, unrestricted access, the trajectory, the building of this unique brand
'm going to have a logo
Here's the deal
Sophie wants you to do it

He's at the centre of the world

(') Okay, well
() How's the novel coming along

He takes some papers from a shelf and hands them to her

" There's a
She laughs
You know

Alison looks past Sidney to the bedroom door where the Fashionista stands in her underwear
(a little wave) Hey, Alice
Sidney looks at her and back at Alison
He gives a little laugh
(half joking, half ) How did it all go so wrong
Alison smiles, gives a little wave and walks away - before he can see how upset she is

134
-    -  134 Sophie and her entourage, including Sidney and Eleanor, climb out of a line of limousines and walk into the Hotel
Sidney stands for a moment, looking around him
Hollywood
He's finally here
We hear the opening of Virgina Plain by Roxy Music
135
-  135 We are swooping in towards the hotel and an enormous for Sophie's new film - in pre- production
It's a re-make of Singing In The Rain - with Russel Crowe
We  down from Sophie's fifteen foot laughing face to find Sidney standing on a slim ledge outside his hotel window
He is drunk and wearing only his underwear
He is also yelling with fear
The window behind him is crowded with people shrieking with laughter
Gingerly he edges back to the window and climbs back into
136   136 It's a wild party
Music is blaring, people are dancing, drinking, laughing
You didn't do it
High
You let me down
Too high
You couldn't do it
Too high
Sophie calmly unzips her dress and steps out of it, standing in her underwear
There is applause from the on- lookers
Calmly she steps out of the window onto the ledge and disappears from sight
The on-lookers crane out of the window, yelling encouragement
After a moment Sophie appears at another window further along the wall and climbs back into the room to ecstatic applause
She stares imperiously at Sidney
106
What are you
Your limpy pig
What
'm your limpy pig
That's right
Okay, limpy pig
You need to pay a forfeit
Whatcha got
've got my little limpy dance
Sidney dances a little, jiggling up and down
() Give me your ring
Sidney stops dancing, his smile fading a little
can't
Give me the ring
want it
can't
Sophie stares at him through narrowed eyes
Okay, give me the ring and if win tomorrow, 'll let you have sex with me
The on-lookers shriek with delight
Sidney stares at her
He looks past her to his reflection in the window - a drunk man in his underwear, swaying from side to side
137
-  137 Sidney is back in his own room, alone, a mess
He sits on the floor chopping lines of coke on the coffee table
He stares groggily at the space on his finger where his ring used to be
107
(muttering to himself) You're a star
You're a big, bright shining star
He snorts a line and, leaning back, flicks blankly through channels - a sports programme, a news station, a sit-com re-run
He snorts another line, flicks stations - more sports, a music video, a black and white movie
Sidney stops, staring at the screen
- we're watching the fifties British movie we saw at the beginning of the film
Sidney's  is typing at the desk in the background
She gets up from the desk and walks into another office
Sidney stares, frozen
Sidney's mother passes the   who is staring out of the window, smoking
She stares at her sympathetically
' (Celia Johnson accent) Don't worry Mary
you'll meet him one day
( ) How will  know when  do
' Oh, when you meet the One, you'll know
She walks on
Sidney stares at the screen
138
-  138 conveyor belt of limousines arriving outside the Hilton
Rain falls
Celebrities wave to the watching crowds as they make their way up the red carpet, cameras flash
Sophie emerges from a limo, looking amazing She makes her way up the carpet, Sidney walks behind, smiling vaguely
139
-  139 Various celebrities are being interviewed
Sidney stands a little apart, lost in thought
Well, well
Look at you
108
Lawrence Maddox stands beside him, something nervous in his manner now, the old confidence gone
He has been drinking
(') Made it all the way to the Seventh Room
He holds out his hand
(') Congratulations
The wheel of fortune right
You go up,  go down
You're here with Sophie
How about doing your old Rabbi a favour and putting in a good word for me
Maybe a little interview
Sidney absent-mindedly takes his hand, looking past him
Is Alison here
Alison
No, we went our separate ways
Actually she left me
Tells me she's in love with someone else
Sidney stares at him
(') Nope, not you 'm afraid Sidalee
She threw us both over
Some guy named Clark
mean
Clark
Can you believe it
But these are the sacrifices we make, right don't need to tell you
It's not a vacation
It's a vocation
So listen, about Sophie
But Sidney is no longer listening
140
-  140 - we move in on Sidney, sitting at the table, listening to the Best Actress award
This is where we first met him
(
) This is me at the Golden Globes
That's my Armani tuxedo
That's a Rolex Sea-Dweller 4000 watch 'm wearing
'm inside
'm at the centre of everything
'm right where  wanted to be
Beside him Sophie covers her face with her hands and starts to stand, having just won Best Actress
109
Sidney stares at her hands - she is wearing his gold ring
We move back into real time, sound swells up, thunderous applause
Sidney claps along with the others
Then he stands up and goes after Sophie
(') (taking her arm) need my ring back
Sophie turns back to him, her smile fixed
(') need my ring back
As if puzzled by her inability to make it to the stage, Sophie, still smiling, tries to pull her arm free
Eleanor is instantly beside them, trying to disengage Sidney's hand
(smiling, hissing) What are you doing
Let her go
She isn't the One
My mother gave me that ring and told me  had to give it to the One
She isn't the One
The applause is still going strong
Cameras move in on Sophie as she starts to struggle, her smile slipping
Sidney tries to pull the ring free from her finger
Officials move in
What the fuck are you doing
() Just
Will you
don't want to be on the inside
don't want to be at the Party
don't want to have have sex with you
(Beat) Sophie stares at him for a moment then with a shriek launches herself at him
They tumble backwards
The Officials rush upon them
There are gasps from the other tables, people standing up to see what's going on
141
'  -  141 Mrs Kowalski sits watching the pandemonium on
110
(
) (on the ) You fucking mother-fucking fucker
() Soddom and Gomarrah

Sophie kicks out at Sidney, ripping her dress in the process
Oh God no
not the Versace
Security pile on Sidney
143
-  143 Richard Young sits watching the awards on
He gives a small smile
144
-  144 Alison sits watching on a  in the corner of the bar
(
) (On  - losing it) You're finished
You're finished
Alison begins to smile
145
-  145 Sidney bursts free from the scrum of Security and begins to run across the room, overturning a table in the process, Officials racing after him
Sidney sprints for the doors
He notices Vincent Lepak's startled face as he passes it
He stops, ducks back and slaps the back of Vincent's head, knocking the  onto the floor
Sidney stamps on them and runs on
Vincent gapes after him
111
146     146 watching from his table as the people around him stand up to see the chase
He shakes his head in horror and then tries, and fails, to restrain a sudden bark of laughter
147
-  147 Sidney bursts out of the hotel onto the red carpet and is momentarily stopped by the sight of the massed ahead, behind the red rope
The Paparazzi stare back at Sidney - his face bruised, shirt collar ripped - equally nonplussed
There is a frozen moment then Sidney plunges forward, ducking under the red rope, back amongst his own kind, pushing through them until he disappears amongst the crowd
148
-   -  148 Sidney stands at the desk
The next available flight is ten am sir
Gets you into New York six thirty
Sidney sighs
149
-  149 Sidney sits in the almost deserted terminal waiting for the flight back to New York
He is still wearing his dishevelled tux
He looks down at his tightly clenched hand and slowly opens his fingers to reveal his
150
-  150 Sidney is in a cab, still wearing his tux, his travel bag slung over shoulder
He stares out as the cab passes the entrance to a
sign advertises an outdoor screening of La Dolce Vita
Stop the car
151
-  151 An outdoor  has been set up
is playing on a large screen
crowd sits around the park, watching the movie
Sidney stands scanning the crowd
He locates Alison sitting near the back
112
She is holding her notebook, watching the movie
Beside her is the remains of a picnic, with lit candles
Sidney smiles and starts towards her, then stops
She is sitting next to a
As Sidney watches she rests her head on his shoulder
Sidney watches, numb, then turns to walk away
stands in front of him in full drag, waving frantically
He starts to run towards Sidney, who sighs and closes his eyes - as if things weren't bad enough
Then Bob runs straight past him
Sidney turns to see the Man next to Alison standing up to embrace Bob
The two kiss
Alison watches Bob and her friend embrace with a touch of sadness
Suddenly she realises someone is standing beside her
She looks up and sees Sidney
She stares at him
Long Beat
Sidney holds out his hand
Alison hesitates and then takes his hand and stands up
How's the novel
Finished
Sidney smiles
He takes the notebook from her and tosses it back onto the picnic blanket
Then he kisses her
As he does so he takes the  and slips it into Alison's coat pocket
Then they begin to dance, cha-cha-chaaing happily at the back of the park, as the music swells, lit by the flickering light from the screen
Suddenly Sidney freezes, staring over Alison's shoulder to where we can see he has accidentally thrown her onto a lit candle
It is now
Sidney shoves Alison aside and dives for the book
