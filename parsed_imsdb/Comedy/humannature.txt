" " by Charlie Kaufman May 20, 1995 There is a gunshot
crow screams
fluttering of wings
: - Bird's-eye view
We circle lazily above the forest
Through a break in the trees, we catch an occasional glimpse of a prostrate form on the ground
As the circling camera gets closer we see that the form is a human body
: - 'm not sorry
bead of sweat trickles down her cheek
Then: a blinding flash of light obliterates her face
: - am sorry
tear wells in Puff's eye and runs down his face
Another blinding flash of light
: - don't even know what sorry means anymore
As Nathan speaks, a trickle of blood drips down his face from his out-of-frame forehead
Another blinding flash of light
: - It's a frenetic hand-held shot as Lila is pulled from a police car and dragged into the precinct house
Cameras flash
Reporters shout questions
Lila attempts to shield her face from view, but she is handcuffed and can only manage to hunch her shoulders
: - ratty interrogation room
Institutional green walls
Beat-up file cabinets
Dark
bit of fluorescent light spills in through the frosted glass door
Lila, thirties, sits at the end of a long table
reel-to-reel tape recorder whirs in front of her
She is smoking
Three fat, mean-looking cops sit in shadows at the other end of the table
One of the cops eyes her lasciviously
Lila's hand shakes as she brings the cigarette to her mouth
'm not sorry
So  spend the rest of my life in jail
So what
've been in jail my whole life anyway jail of blood and tissue and coursing hormones
One of the cops sighs and massages the bridge of his nose
It's going to be a long night
a jail called the human body
The lascivious cop smiles lasciviously at Lila's reference to "human body
" My soul held prisoner in this reeking, stench-ridden bag of bones and entrails
bag of feces and piss and fibroid cysts in my tits and precancerous moles on my sun-damaged back
The lascivious cop gags, then vomits on the floor
Lila drags on her cigarette, calmer now
At least now 'll be able to blame the state, not God, for my incarceration
: - Puff, thirties, dirty, scraggly hair and beard but in a crisp business suit, testifies before a congressional committee
The auditorium is filled with reporters and spectators
Puff sits in front of a microphone, counsel at his side
He pours himself a glass of water, drinks, clears his throat, then speaks: stentorian, confident
am sorry, gentlemen, sorry for all of us
Your's is a complicated, sad world
This is a revelation to the assembled crowd
People whisper to each other
And  never knew that
was living a life of simplicity, of purity, when  was ripped out of my Eden and immersed in this harshness
Some would argue that the life  was living was not a human life at all
And, gentlemen,  don't have any clever retort
am not a philosopher
The only thing  know is that  am sorry, sorry for my expulsion from Eden, sorry for my Lila rotting in her jail cell, and sorry for Nathan
rotting in his grave
: - Nathan, thirties, in a white robe, sits alone at a white table
Everything is white except for an oozing bullet wound in Nathan's temple
don't even know what sorry means anymore
It's odd
When  was alive knew -- maybe it was all  knew -- but here sorry is meaningless
Love is meaningless
Jealousy is meaningless
Ambition is meaningless
Everything that motivated my every breath while  was alive is meaningless now
(beat) guess that's how  can be sure 'm really dead
: - Lila watches the slowly churning tape recorder reels, fixated
The cop who vomited is mopping it up
The other two are sipping coffee
Lila talks
My story begins when  was twelve
(checks watch) Jesus
: - It's got that faded, "memory" look
Twelve year old Lila hurries home from school, books clutched to her chest
Other kids walk along the street in pairs or groups, laughing and chatting
Lila walks alone, a worried scowl on her face
(
) Something terrible happened when was twelve
: '  - Colors are still muted
It looks to be somewhere in the early 70's based on the preponderance of Bay City Rollers posters on the wall
Twelve year old Lila enters the room, closes the door, locks it, rattles the doorknob to make sure that the door is really locked
She draws the shades
She pulls some t-shirts from her dresser drawer and stuffs them into the space between the bottom of the door and the floor
(
) (muffled) Hey, no fair
Drop dead, Eric
Lila stands nervously in front of the full-length mirror on her closet door
She takes a deep breath and begins to unbutton her shirt, watching herself carefully in the mirror
(
) Something terrible started to happen to my body when  was twelve
My mother said because of it  would never be able to get a man, so should get used to the idea of dedicating my life to the pursuit of knowledge, or religion
or whatever
Lila's shirt is now unbuttoned
She pulls it open
She is wearing a training bra over the very beginning of breast buds
On the chest above the bra, and on her stomach below it, is hair
Dark curly hair
She stares at it, touches it cautiously
Then she starts to cry
She crouches into a ball and weeps
(
) The doctor said
: '  - Old fashioned office
Twelve year old Lila sits on the examination table, her shirt off
An elderly male doctor touches the hair, fingers it
Her mother looks on
(to the mother) It's hormonal
Nature is a funny and complex thing
It could get worse with time
Young Lila turns to the camera
By the time  was twenty  looked like an ape
: - The cop who vomited, gags again
Lila stares at him
Her face is hard, blank
She stubs out her cigarette
: - Puff testifies before the committee
don't think there's anyone in the world who doesn't know by now that was raised in the wilderness by an ape
Well, to be fair, by a man who thought himself an ape, but it amounts to the same thing gentlemen, does it not
: -
This has a faded, "memory" look also
naked, bearded, dirty middle-aged man and a naked, dirty ten year old Puff walk along like apes, crouched over and dragging their knuckles
(
) My father escaped from a New Jersey mental institution in 1963
: - It's raining and deserted
Puff's father, in pajamas, comes tearing around the corner
He runs crazily towards the camera, waving his arms, puffing out his cheeks
(
) He had been committed the previous year after applying one too many times at our local zoo for the job of "apprentice ape
" Puff's father passes a newspaper vending machine, stops, goes back and examines the headline
It reads: President Kennedy Assassinated
Puff's father looks heavenward and clutches at his temples in despair
(
) My father saw what the human race had come to while he was
in captivity
He felt something had to be done to create a better world
: - Puff's father climbs out a second story window with a small bundle in his arms
He runs off into the night
(
) He stole little me from my mother, his ex-wife, and raised me, with love and tenderness and respect, as an ape like himself
: - Puff looks pointedly at the congressman
Apes don't assassinate their presidents, gentlemen
The congressmen are shamed: they look down, they take notes, they mumble instructions to the assistants seated behind them
: - An adult Puff and his now older father sit on the forest floor and pick bugs off each other and eat them
(
) Until quite recently  believed myself to be an ape, although  didn't know specifically what type
Apes don't think in terms of type
: - Puff testifies
It might be argued, gentlemen, that apes don't even know that they are apes
In retrospect, however, 'd say that  was a pygmy chimp
Puff holds up an illustration of a pygmy chimp
Several reporters run from the room: a scoop
: - Nathan talks to nobody in particular
have to say  always hated apes
Of course  don't any longer
don't even know what hate means now
But while alive,  hated apes
blame my parents
mean,  don't blame them
don't know what blame is, really, anymore, but  think they influenced me in my ape-hating tendencies
: - Faded colors
Ten year old Nathan in a bow tie and shortpanted suit walks along with his uptight, British parents
They arrive at the ape pen
Nathan is excited
He jumps up and down
The apes jump up and down also
Monkeys
Look, mama, monkeys
(clamping down on his shoulder) Nathan, those are not monkeys
Those are apes
Mountain Gorillas to be precise
There is a commotion off screen
Two uniformed attendants drag Puff's father, straitjacketed and kicking and screaming like an ape, past Nathan and his parents
' am not a human being
am an animal
Nathan, his father, and the other zoo patrons look on curiously, a little frightened
Nathan's mother chooses to ignore it
And furthermore
Tell him, Harold
(distracted) Uh
(then by rote) We must never act like apes, son
For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp
(holds up the same illustration of a pygmy chimp that Puff showed the congressional committee) single chromosome separates us
But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes
No, papa
What
Culture
Civilization
Refinement
If we do not have these as humans, then we might as well be living in pens and throwing our feces about, masturbating in public
(beat, a reverie) sniffing red swollen female rump
Enough, Harold
: - Lila lights a new cigarette with her spent one
She drags
Oh,  had sexual urges
had the urge to merge, officers
Inside was 100% Grade  female
(laughs derisively) But what self-loathing  felt
Who would have someone as repulsive, as unladylike as me
did everything could to shield the world from this repulsiveness
: - Stockings hang over the shower curtain rod
The window shade is drawn
Towels are stuffed in the space under the door twenty year old naked Lila is covered with shaving cream, face to feet
She is shaving
There is a pounding on the door
(
) Lila, what are you doing in there need to get ready for my date
Nothing
'll be out in a minute
The door opens
Lila freezes
Look, 'll just
(stops in her tracks when she sees Lila) What the
Lila is mortified
: - Lila is sitting in her bathrobe on her bed and staring out the window
There is a bit of shaving cream behind her ear
Her roommate runs back and forth getting ready for her date
don't know why you didn't tell me about this
It's embarrassing, okay
It's not so bad
(beat) So, it just keeps growing
Yeah, Natalie
It's hair
It grows
Well, don't jump down my throat
'm just trying to help
How is that helping, Natalie
How exactly
Look, if you're going to be like that
You should be appreciative that 'm interested
Why, because 'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles
(pegged) You're fucked up, Lila
(out the door) Why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something
Figure it out for chrissake
The door slams
Lila hugs her knees to her chest
(
) At sixty dollars an hour, electrolysis was not a feasible solution explored my alternatives
: - Twelve year old Lila walks sadly through an art museum
she looks at various old portraits of men
She studies their facial hair
When she turns a corner, she is shocked to see a large Renaissance painting of a naked woman entirely covered with fur
She hurries to it
She looks at the placard next to the painting
It is a painting of Mary Magdalene
(
) remember once coming across a painting of Mary Magdalene entirely covered with fur
guess that's where  got the idea that maybe the Catholic Church might be a place that encouraged excessive hair growth in its women
- Lila, in a nun's habit, is on her knees praying
(
) So  became a nun
Heavenly Father
(sighs) please let this hair go away
(
) But my prayers were always so selfish
: - bunch of naked women dance and chat around a campfire
Lila is there, pretty hairy
So are many of the other women
(
) tried being a lesbian separatist
(chanting) woman without a man / Is like a fish without a bicycle
(
) But  guess  just wasn't attracted to women, even hostile, man-hating, hairy ones who wore sensible shoes
: - Lila, in a full beard, sits on a throne before a crowd of gawking, dumb-looking, mouth-breathing children
Next to her on a separate stage is a sour-looking, middle-aged midget man sitting on a throne, staring blankly into space
(
) For a while  was a professional circus freak
: - Lila, in a Santa suit, with beard sprayed white, sits on a throne in front of a crowd of gawking, dumb-looking, mouth- breathing children
One of them is on her lap
Next to her sits the sour midget, dressed in an elf suit
(
) During the holiday season, they made us wear costumes
(depressed) Ho ho ho
That's not real
The kid pulls Lila's beard
Ow
You little fuck
(
) Aside from the great dental, this occupation was not pleasant
: - Lila walks home
She's wrapped in winter clothing, but we can still see a bit of her white beard
It's snowing
The street is deserted
She spots a lighted window, she peers in
It's a warm family scene
Large group of chatting, laughing people
Fire in the fireplace
Big turkey on the table
(
) They say the holidays are difficult for a lot of people
Lila looks down the street and sees dozens of lonely-looking people peering forlornly in warmly lit windows
Some on ladders to peer in second-floor windows
Lila sighs
: - The room is lit with candles
Lila finishes shaving herself all over
Then she takes the double-edged blade out of the razor and climbs into the a bathtub filled with warm water
She is about to slice her wrists
(
) decided there was something poetic about killing myself with a razor blade
On the shelf next to the tub a little gray mouse watches her intently
At first she is startled, but then she and the creature seem to be communing
His little black beady eyes reflect the light
Lila starts to cry
She puts down the blade
: - Lila wipes a tear from her eye
The way that mouse looked at me
There was no judgement
It didn't care if  had hair all over my body
was just what  was
felt so free
Do you understand what 'm saying
The cops look up, on the spot
It seems their minds were elsewhere
Something about a mouse, right
Lila sighs
: - We see a tent in a clearing
smoking campfire
There is a rustling inside the tent
Lila steps out naked
She is covered with fur
She pours a cup of coffee, and stands, comfortable in her skin, watching the world around her
Squirrels jump from tree to tree, birds look down at her
She smiles
(
) Birds and squirrels and rocks and trees didn't seem to judge my hair
felt at peace when there were no humans around
figured out a way to spend as much time as possible with no people around
became a nature writer
Lila picks up a pad and pen from a rock, sits on the rock and writes
: - woman under a hair drier reads a book intently
We see the first sentence of the chapter: "Last night  almost died on this mountain top
" We hear Lila's dramatic reading competing with the very loud sound of the hair drier
Last night  almost died on this mountain top, and the irony is  had never felt more alive
: - There is a violent, violent storm
The hair drier drone has turned into the explosive noise of rain beating down in sheets and wind howling at fifty miles an hour
Branches crack
Lila's tent blows over, revealing her huddled there with a sleeping bag wrapped around her like a blanket
knew it was coming when in late afternoon, a thunderhead drifted over, sneaking in like kids through the back door of a movie theater, forced casual
It turned the sky a queer shade of green
green that said "watch out, baby, this is gonna hurt like hell
"  could've hightailed, but that would be cheating
Part of the Nature experience is recognizing its mastery over you, your smallness in the face of it
Lightning hits a tree nearby
It falls with a smack practically on top of Lila
She screams, then defiantly stands, throwing off the sleeping bag
The wind and rain whip her hair around her head
She laughs with amazing gusto and raise her arms like a runner winning a marathon
As Nietzsche said, what does not kill me makes me stronger, and that goes double if you're a woman
: - We see many copies of a book entitled "Wind in my Hair" by Lila Jute
(
) became a successful nature writer
: - We see a woman under a hair drier reading "Wind in my Hair"
We pull back to see that a long row of women under hair driers are reading Lila's book
They all stand defiantly, proudly, knocking their hair driers up and back as they do
The blowing hair driers whip the women's wet hair around their heads
The blowing hair drier drone is unbearably loud
Then  became a famous nature writer
said to myself, fuck humanity
: - big display of the book "Fuck Humanity" by Lila Jute long line of women with beautifully coiffured hair snakes out of the store
and  became a recluse
had a menagerie of animals at my house
They loved me because  was me
They loved me on the days  shaved
They loved me on the days  didn't
For a while this was enough
: - Lila lies in bed tapping on a lap top
dog lies with her and licks her knee
She seems to enjoy it, and gets lost in a reverie
The dog morphs into a handsome man, kissing her knee and working his way up her thigh and under her nightgown
Lila is getting seriously hot and bothered
Her head lolls
But the reverie dissipates and the man turns back into a dog rooting around her crotch with his cold nose
She pushes him away
The dejected dog gets off the bed
(
) By the time  was thirty  was very, very horny
Lila gets out of bed and studies herself in the mirror
She brushes her hands against her hairy body
had to have a man in my
life
At any cost
would become what needed to become to achieve this would become a hairless lie
The mirror image of Lila shimmers and turns into Lila with no body hair
Lila all made-up and with a smart new hairstyle
She assumes a coquettish pose and smiles cutely at herself
was rich enough for electrolysis by this time, so  began the long arduous process of having each inappropriate hair burned out of my body at the root
: - Lila talks
One of the cops is doodling
One is picking wax from his ear with a pencil
One is reading a paperback novel under the table
This is when everything changed, and this is where my confession really begins
The cops look up
: '  - Lila lies shirtless on a table while Rose, her fifty year old electrologist, works on her back
Progress
Ouch
Yeah
Oh yes, honey
Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over
Smooth as a baby's butt
love it, Rose
'm getting to be a real girl
You still in the market for a real boy
Always
Ow
(beat) Cause there's this guy
My brother knows him
Might be right up your alley
Tell me
could use someone up my alley
(playing dumb) don't get that
Is that sexual
Shut up and tell me
Handsome, thirties, psychologist
Loves animals
Ouch
Must love animals, Rose
Loves animals
Loves you
What do you mean
Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine
Mr
handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you
Holy shit
Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he
My brother is discreet
(rubbing her hand over her jaw) Won't he be able to tell
My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel
Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation
Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever
God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff
Yeah, well my brother is his shrink
: - It's a chi-chi place
Lila sits at a table with Nathan, fastidious in dress and manner
There is an awkward firstdate silence
She sneaks a glance at his crotch
Then: Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read
Thank you so much
love slugs
All slugs, not just banana slugs
As do
They're so even keel
They forge ahead with slow determination
They don't get distracted or side-tracked
They don't care what they look like
They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww
slug
" They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true
You've got to respect that
have to say that 'm not there yet
Where
Slugdom
Sluggishness
Whatever you'd call it
'm not there yet
still have many human characteristics
That's not necessarily a bad thing
Yes
suppose not
But still
One would like to move along
To move beyond
'm not sure we can escape our natures
Believe me 've tried
'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to
love that you said that
It makes me feel a bit lighter
've been rather heavy lately
Thinking about my childhood
Realizing how much a product  am of my upbringing
(beat, cautiously) 've been seeing someone
therapist
(feigning surprise) You are a therapist, right
No no
'm a psychologist, but  do research
'm a behaviorist
work with animals
Mice at the moment
hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan
Heavens no
My work now is
Right now 'm teaching mice
well, table manners, to be candid
(beat
doesn't know what to say) How's it going
Quite well, really
It's a lot of work
lot of reinforcement, mostly positive
Right now 've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins
Tiny napkins of course
Paper or cloth
hope you don't think me daft
It's important work
It's part of a larger sociological experiment
'm federally funded
What's the larger experiment
It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans
Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan
(speech) The truth is most people don't have table manners today
And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels
'm not sure
(stridently) Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse
Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm
We are animals after all
Ergo if  can teach table manners to mice,  can teach them to humans
If can teach table manners to humans, can save the world
Nathan blushes
Lila stares at him for a long moment
Her thoughts are unreadable
: '  - Lila lies on her back
Rose works on her breasts
So
really like him, Rose
He's so
(searching) passionate about his work
My brother says he likes you, too
(pleased) Really
Yeah
Says he likes you even more than he likes his own mother
And according to my brother Nathan's abormally close with his mother
: - Nathan talks
began going to a therapist when was in my thirties, because  felt that  wasn't enjoying life the way my friends were
(beat) After a time my childhood came up
: - It is another sepia scene
Nathan as a ten year old sits at the table with his parents
There is a bowl of salad in front of each of them
Everyone's head is bowed in prayer
Lord, we thank you for this bountiful gift we are about to receive
Amen
Eyes open, and young Nathan reaches for a fork to eat the salad
He grabs the wrong fork
Mother's eyes widen in horror
My God, no
My God
(disappointed) Oh, Nathan
Nathan looks up
That is the wrong fork, young man
(to father) Harold, tell the boy
That is the wrong fork, young man
(panicky) 'll use the right one
'm sorry forgot
Harold, tell the boy more
Too late
Go to your room
But
Harold
Tell the boy again
(looking at mother) No "buts
" Go to your room now
(looking at father) And
And think about what you've done
: '  - Adult Nathan sits on the couch, dabbing at his eyes
Wendall, his therapist sits across from him and writes something in his notebook
And do you think maybe this early childhood indoctrination has something to do with your interest in table manners in the present
Nathan thinks long and hard about this
He seems to be really straining, squinting his eyes
Finally: don't think so
No
Wendall nods and scribbles something on his pad
Why do you ask
Wendall looks up
: - Everything's white
People in lab coats hustle back and forth
Nathan, also in a lab coat, is hovering over a Lucite encasement
Inside we see two white mice, both attached to electrodes
They sit in little chairs at a little table
In front of each of them is a little plate of salad and three forks of varying size under Lucite domes
Nathan nods to his pretty French assistant, Gabrielle, who presses a button
The Lucite domes over the salads lift
Tentatively both mice reach for a fork
There is a tiny piece of velcro on each mouse's paw and a tiny piece of velcro on each of the forks
The first mouse picks the correct fork, and stabs it into the salad and eats happily, relieved
The second mouse picks the wrong fork
Nathan presses a button, which sends the mouse flying off his chair with an electric shock
The correct mouse keeps eating, unconcerned
Nathan makes a note in his notebook
Gabrielle watches Nathan as he writes, enchanted
: '  - The table is elegantly set, candlelit
Lila sits at it while Nathan fusses in the kitchenette
Something classical wafts over from the stereo in the living room
Nathan places a salad in front of Lila and sits across from her with his own salad
It looks wonderful
You look wonderful
'm on top of the world tonight, Lila
Work is going splendidly and my personal life is
Lila picks up a fork from the inside of her setting, not the outside
Nathan blinks
Lila tastes the salad
Um-mmm
Oh Nathan, this salad is delish
(clenched teeth) My God
The fork
The fork
'm sorry
(strangely) Tell her, Harold
(stops himself) It's just that
It's nothing
It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork
One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses
Oh, 'm sorry
(picks up correct fork) 'm sorry, Nathan
never really learned those things
(forced casual) No biggie
There is a long silence as they both eat the salad
Boy, this is good
'm sorry that  became so upset
No, 'm sorry
'm really backward in certain areas
(beat, blurting) It's only that  really enjoy your company and
You do
Yes, and
You really enjoy my company
Yes
(beat, blurting) Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila
Please
You're so pretty and it only mars your
'm sorry
'm being critical
Nathan pounds his forehead with his fist
Lila waves her hand to indicate that it's fine
She doesn't say anything because she's chewing
It's just that  have some peculiarities, and
like you, too, Nathan
You do
Yeah (beat) But  have some peculiarities also
(happily) don't care
don't care
(then, concerned) Like what, for example
Lila takes a deep breath, about to go into it, thinks better of it
Like nothing
Nathan smiles, relieved
Lila smiles back
Nathan recoils slightly, skittishly half-points to his bared teeth
Apparently there's a piece of food stuck in Lila's teeth
She closes her mouth, runs her tongue over her teeth, smiles again, mouth closed
: '  - Rose is doing Lila's feet
My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan
cannot believe how in love  am with this man
Yeah
He's so cute
even like his cute little penis
It's like a little pig's penis or something
(beat) Rose, we connect on every level
've finally found someone  can feel completely safe with
Don't throw that away
had that once with a guy
But  threw it away for a cheap thrill
One night stand
No
married a midget
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill
Well he wasn't really a midget
He was on the cusp of midgethood
That's what made it cheap
Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear
didn't know you were into that sort of thing
Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship
They're portable
They're controllable
They're eager
And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor
(screams with delight, then:) have a friend you might like to meet
Oh
Three foot one
Be still my crotch
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him
Yeah
My brother told me
And  think 'm going to
(mulling it over) Stand on a stepladder sometimes
: - Nathan talks
Lila moved in with me
Did  love her
thought so
But from my new vantage point  realize that love is nothing more than a messy conglomeration of need, desperation, fear of death, insecurity about penis size, and the self-involved, ego driven need to collect other people's hearts
Not that  judge it
(puts head in hands
beat
looks up) Listen,  don't want to be dead yet
Is there any way to
Nathan looks around for some sign of another person
There is nobody
No  suppose not
(beat) No biggie
Anyway, Lila moved in
We had our problems, but we both wanted love so badly, we turned a blind eye
'  - Nathan, Lila, and Nathan's parents (looking very, very old) sit at the dining room table
Salad is about to be eaten, and everyone glances sideways over at Lila, waiting for her to make her move
She reaches for the wrong fork, corrects herself and picks the salad fork
Nathan breathes a sigh of relief
His mother looks disappointed, clucks
They eat in silence
Finally: It's lovely to finally meet you, Mr
and Mrs
Bronfman
've heard so much about you and 've seen you in photographs from Nathan's childhood, but it's nice to meet you in the flesh
must say, you look exactly the same as in the photographs
Thank you, dear
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old
You look terrible
Nathan
His mother and father touch their faces reflexively, then look at each other and laugh
Tell him, Harold
Son, your mother and  are doing a production of The Gin Game at the local community theater
We forgot to take off our make-up
The mother and father laugh again
Then they pull at their latex faces
The wrinkles come off
And they look exactly as they did in the flashback scene, albeit a bit pink-faced
There is another pause
(awkward) Goodness, you two look exactly as you did in those old photos
(cold) Yes, so you mentioned earlier, dear
(changing the subject) Lila's a nature writer, mother
love nature
As long as it stays in the zoo where it belongs
The father and Nathan laugh at mother's joke
Lila joins in weakly, against her better judgment
(to Lila) Don't you agree, dear
Lila hesitates
Of course she does, mother
: '  - Nathan is in bed, in starched pajamas
He lies on his back under perfect covers and stares straight up at the ceiling
What are you doing in there
(
) (pissy) 'll be out in a minute
'm sorry about my parents
(
) You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes
was simply attempting to keep the evening light
You know that  feel similarly to you about nature
(
) Do you
Of course
(beat) simply love the
naturalness of it all
Lila emerges from the bathroom, radiant, hopeful
Do you
Oh do you, darling
Why certainly
Lila happily leaps into bed
She smothers Nathan with kisses
Oh, darling
'm so relieved
Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow
(oh shit) That's a great idea
Nathan kisses her
It'll be wonderful
'll show you my old stomping grounds
Terrific
Can't wait
Nathan kisses her ear
He looks confused, sticks his finger behind her ear, and pulls it out with a dab of shaving cream on it
Shaving cream
don't think so
(beat) Why
: - Nathan drives
He's dressed in spanking new, freshly starched safari clothes, big shiny new hiking boots
Lila sits in the front passenger seat
She is dressed in a costume identical to Nathan's, but, as opposed to Nathan, she seems awkward in it
She fidgets in it, straightens it, sighs, comes to terms with it, and looks dreamily out the window at the passing trees
She is home
That's all that matters
Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion
Yes, darling
(beat) Oh, and the sun block
Of course
What , sweetie
Fifteen
Perfectomundo
We are ready
(beat) Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block
Think of all the time one would save
Yes, darling
think 'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that
(beat) Oh
Did you bring the first aid kit
Yes
Flares
Absolutely
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny
" (laughs a lot) Get it
Sunny
-u-n-n-y
(laughs appreciatively) That's very funny
love you so much
: - Puff testifies
Then, gentlemen, one day  saw something  hadn't seen since my father died in a freak accident involving a rotted log and four thousand bees stinging his head saw other human beings
They chattered away at each other in what appeared to be gibberish
Later  learned it was English
Now  wonder if perhaps my initial assessment hadn't been correct
: - Puff's : Through some brush we watch Nathan and Lila hiking
We hear Puff's loud heavy breathing and, in the distance, the relentless gibberish chatter of Nathan and Lila
Puff moves
Lila glances over
: - Lila talks
It was a flash of white
ruled out deer immediately
Too
upright
: - We're with Lila and Nathan now
Lila has stopped and is peering into the distance
Did you see that
What
don't know
Something
deer
No
Too
upright
Might've been a person
(nervously) It might behoove us to turn back at this point
Lila walks in the direction of the sighting
Come on
(not budging) If it's a person, why should we go see it
It's not like it's nature or anything
It's just a person
(beat) Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen
They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila
We have to respect that
Lila trudges through the brush
Nathan follows
Better than being left behind
This is the way to get ticks, Lila
This is it
Bingo
Lyme Disease
You've hit the nail on the head here
Lila is in her element
Her whole demeanor has changed
She is tracking
She sniffs the breeze, cocks her head, moves stealthily
Then she sheds her clothes, almost shaking them off, like a dog shaking off some cute costume his owner had dressed him in
Oh for God's sa
Lila turns her head and glares at Nathan
There is an animal fierceness in her eye that shuts him up instantly
She turns back to pursue her prey
: - Puff testifies
had never seen anything like it
: - Puff's : We see a naked Lila looking in our general direction, but not seeing us
The sun dapples her body
She moves closer and closer
(
) It was an ape as  had never seen before
Like me, yet different in certain essential details
And all at once  felt a heat pass through me
My heart raced
Gentlemen, wanted to touch her, to caress her, to be one with her
had urges and desires  could not explain
felt overwhelmed by the power this strange creature had over me, and so  did what any animal would do when it comes across an animal of superior strength
: - The cops are transfixed
He bolted
: - We are with Lila
She creeps along, when suddenly a tan, muscular figure tears out from behind a tree and runs, practically on all fours, through the dense underbrush
Lila follows, almost as agile as the forest creature
Nathan just stands there
The chase continues
There is a great deal of heaving and panting
Puff shimmies up a large tree
Lila follows
Puff leaps from branch to branch
Lila follows easily
Puff swings from a vine
So does Lila
Finally they come to the end of the trees, a clearing
There is no nowhere for Puff to leap
Lila is with him in the tree
They are crouched, bloody, heaving, on separate branches, staring at each other
After a long moment, Lila speaks
Who are you
Puff cocks his head
The high timbre of her voice surprises him, pleases him, but he doesn't understand the words
You don't understand my language, do you
Puff looks at his crotch
Apparently there is some activity down there
Lila, following his eyes, glances down there also
(laughing) take it back, you do understand my language
Puff grabs for his crotch and begins to play with himself distractedly, looking at her all the while
He falls out of the tree
Lila gasps
Branches crack and snap as he passes through them and then there is an unpleasant thud when he hits the forest floor
Lila shimmies down the tree, and kneels by Puff
He is unconscious
Oh God
Nathan comes limping through the brush
Somehow his safari suit and boots are as clean and pressed as they were in the car
He is carrying Lila's clothes
Somehow he has had time to neatly fold them
Oh my God
Is he dead
Please put something on
Lila looks up at icily at Nathan
You'll catch cold
It's cold
(beat) What do you suppose he is, a survivalist
think he's feral
(jumping back) Feral
Don't touch him
He might be diseased
He might
My God, rabies
He looks perfectly fine
think we should go
Please
Before he wakes up and,  don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do
don't understand you
This is fascinating and you just want to run away
mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your
(thinking) Actually,  just had an amusing thought
What
(musing) Feral, huh
Totally uncontaminated
Look at him
He doesn't understand English
He moves like an animal
It's perfect
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about
(doing a little dance) Forget mice
Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also
'm on to stage five: The human subject
Oh no
You can't take him from his home, Nathan
(ranting) Don't you see
He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle
He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain
He's going to make me famous
won't allow you
It's wrong
He's happy here
Is he, Lila
Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness
Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality
(weakening resolve) You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote Janet Jackson
Lila looks off into the distance, her eyes brimming with tears
As Nathan continues his speech, we move closer and closer into Lila's eyes
Nathan's voice fades into nothing by the time we dissolve
Belonging to something, a person or a society, is a basic human craving
We are communal creatures
This poor soul has no one, nothing
: - naked, very hairy Lila sits by herself on the cliff and watches the sunset
There's a chill in the air and she shivers and hugs herself
Oh God,  have no one
Nothing
You give me this beautiful gift, this glorious sunset
But with no one to say "isn't that a beautiful sunset" to, it becomes meaningless, just another stupid sunset
They happen everyday
So what
: - Lila is hovering over the unconscious Puff
Nathan's voice comes back into focus
He is still speechifying
what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human
Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon
All right
Great
Grab his feet
We'll throw him in the trunk
: - Nathan hovers over the Lucite case with the tiny dinner table in it
His assistant, Gabrielle, presses a button, a door opens, and two white mice scurry in
The male pulls out a chair for the female
The female climbs up on the chair, and the male pushes the chair in, then scurries around to the other side of the table and climbs onto his own chair
The Lucite lid over the silverware and salads lifts and both mice pick up the proper forks and begin eating
Nathan scribbles in his notebook
Doctor
Nathan looks up
Gabrielle jerks her head in the direction of a very large Lucite case
Inside, Puff, now dressed in a diaper and connected to all sorts of electrodes, is stirring
Nathan and Gabrielle hurry over
Good morning
Puff groggily takes in his surroundings
This is quite a lot to take in
The white room, the strange apes in strange suits, his own clothing, the wires
After surveying the scene for a moment, Puff becomes frightened and agitated
He tries to escape
Not understanding Lucite, he smashes into it, again and again
He tears at his diaper
Nathan gives a nod to Gabrielle, who presses a button on a panel
An electric shock sends Puff flying
He lies on the floor confused and dazed
After a moment, he gets up and again crashes into the Lucite
Nathan gives the signal to Gabrielle and once again she shocks Puff
He once again gets up and crashes against the Lucite
Again he is shocked
He gets up again, and is about to crash against the Lucite, but he thinks better of it, and squats in place, immobilized
(to Gabrielle) Only three shocks
chimp takes fifteen
This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle
(in love with Nathan) Oui, doctor, oui
(to Puff) Good morning
(to Gabrielle) We need a name for him, don't we
Oui
You decide
Today is your day
Really
My day
Well,  had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when  was a girl
This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy
So cute
(giggles girlishly) loved my doggie very much, monsieur
(charmed) Puff it is then
Puff Bronfman
Is that okay
Oui
Perfect
(to Puff) Good morning, Puff Bronfman
'm Dr
Bronfman and this is my assistant Gabrielle
We're your mommy and daddy while you are here
Gabrielle likes this concept a great deal
She smiles and moves closer to Nathan
(to Puff) How about some salad, son
Gabrielle poises her finger above the button
She winks at Nathan
He blushes
: - Nathan, carrying a brief case, is walking to his car
Gabrielle hurries to catch up to him
Her high heels click on the pavement
Dr
Bronfman
Dr
Bronfman
Nathan turns
Oh, Hi, Gabrielle
(out of breath) Hi
just wanted to tell you that very much enjoy working with you
(blushes) Now 'm embarrassed that  say this
They walk along
No
Don't be
really enjoy hearing that
You're a terrific assistant
Merci
Do you
would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps
Well,  don't know
'm actually on my way to
Now  am truly embarrassed
Forgive me
should not have asked such a stupid question
know you are a very important man and
No
Don't be silly
It's just
am a foolish little thing
am pink in my face, no
It is only that have been so lonely lately and
am ashamed
'll see you tomorrow, okay
Unless
Am  fired now
Gabrielle pouts
Nathan is charmed
: - Nathan and Gabrielle sit at a romantic little table in a trendy coffee shop
Thank you so much for accompanying me
Not at all
have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man
but 'm talking too much again, no
Of course not
You're so sweet
Oh, why are there not more men out there like you
Gabrielle starts to cry softly
Nathan doesn't know what to do
His eyes dart around, then: There there
Gabrielle looks up at him appreciatively
She sniffs
You know just the right thing to say
She reaches across the table and touches his hand lightly for a moment
Listen, you're the best assistant 've ever had
Gabrielle
(smiles) like it when you say my name
Is that stupid
: '  - Nathan, in his pajamas, lies in bed reading
He looks up
What are you doing in there
(
) Nothing
Be right out
The phone rings
Nathan picks it up
Hello
(beat, happily) Oh, hi
Gabrielle
Nathan sits up in bed
(
) Who is it
Uh-huh
Right, Gabrielle
Right
Nathan laughs
(
) Who is it
(into phone) Absolutely, Gabrielle
(covering phone, testily) Someone from work
(into phone) Sorry about that, Gabrielle
Uh-huh
Exactly
Nathan laughs
(
) Who from work
(into phone) Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle
Nathan puts down the phone and heads to the bathroom
(
) Who is it, Nathan
Nathan opens the bathroom door
Look, Lila, when 'm on a work
Lila turns with a gasp
She has shaving cream all over her chest
Nathan looks stunned
He backs away
Nathan,
: '  - The lights are low
The room is peppered with lit candles
Gabrielle, in a slip, lies on her bed, eating cherries from a bowl, and listening to Nathan and Lila's conversation on speaker
(
) It's hormonal, Nathan
can't help it
'm sorry
(
) Your entire body
(
) 'm getting electrolysis
It's working, but it takes time
So meanwhile  have to
(
) You have to shave
Like an ape
(
) (crying) Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch
(
) Don't quibble
You know what  mean
(
) 'm sorry
Please don't be mad at me for this
(
) Mad
'm 'm
disgusted
(
) 'm the same person  was before you knew, damn it
Oh God
(
) have to think
have to think
Footsteps and a door slam
Lila is near the phone now and crying in desperate heaves
(
) Oh God, why
do
have
to
be
like
Oh, no
Oh, shit
(rustling sound, then into phone) Hello
Hello
Is anyone there
Who's there
Gabrielle calmly pops another cherry in her mouth and hangs up the phone
: - Nathan, in his pajamas, drives
His face is set in a furious scowl and he drives fast
: - Gabrielle drives leisurely
She is calm, a slight smile on her face
: - Nathan paces in front of Puff's Lucite case
Puff watches suspiciously from the corner where he is huddled
The lights are off
But there is a green glow from a couple of exit signs
don't get it
don't get it don't get it
How could  find myself in this mess
This is a mess
This is not a situation  understand
This is a mess
How do  extricate myself from this mess
Is my girlfriend a man
don't understand
This is not part of any plan
She deceived me
She has hair
(beat) But am  being fair
So what if she has hair
Who am  to judge
have hair
(beat) But 'm supposed to have hair
am a man
Men are supposed to have hair
(beat) But poor Lila
Think of what she's had to go through
The courage she's had to have in the face of this abomination of nature
should love her all the more
should love every hair on her body
mean, she doesn't mind that  have a mortifyingly small
The lights flick on
Nathan turns with a start
It's Gabrielle
She's in an overcoat
She gasps
Oh, Doctor
did not know
'm sorry to disturb you
just came for some papers  left
Gabrielle
No, 'm sorry if  startled you
came to think
(beat, remembering) God, Did  hang up on you
Oui
Perhaps  called at a bad time
am sorry
No
just got distracted
'm so sorry
Is everything fine
Oui
(laughs) Now you've got me talking French
(laughs) was in my p
j
's when  remembered left some papers  need to go over
(opens overcoat to reveal lingerie) See
rushed right out of the house
must look a mess
'm so embarrassed
(taken) 'm in my p
j
's, too
Funny, huh
Puff is taken also
His eyes are wide
Coincidence, yes
(beat) And how is our son
Our
Oh
(laughs, out of control) He seems fine
guess we woke him
The lights and all
should turn them off
(she does) Maybe  sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when  was a little girl
(a little giddy) When you were a little French girl
Oui
(back in control) That would be good
Gabrielle kneels by Puff's case
Puff crawls over, tries to touch her through the Lucite
Gabrielle sings a French lullaby
It's very sweet
Nathan watches her, looks at her thigh, her hair, the delicate way the tip of her nose moves when she sings
Puff gets drowsy
He curls up on the floor and sleeps
(quietly to Nathan) There
Nathan stares at her, transfixed
She pretends not to notice
Shall we close up, then
Maybe we should just sit for a while
It's very peaceful
It's nice, yes
'm glad  ran into you, both in our silly pajamas
It is two happy coincidences, no
Yes
Happy happy
Yet you look so sad
great man like you should not be sad
'm fine
Life is funny, that's all
Gabrielle stands
She stretches languorously, revealing a lot of leg
am sleepy
shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle
It's unprofessional,  know
Really
always think myself so ugly
No, not ugly, but plain wallflower
(buying her line) Really
No
Not at all
You're a very pretty girl
You should know that
You should be confident
Thank you so much
Merci
It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment
It's true
wouldn't lie
You are sweet
Gabrielle walks slowly by Nathan
He inhales deeply, breathing her in
She smiles to herself
He reaches out touches her leg
(vaguely protesting) Doctor
She moves into Nathan
She presses her thigh against his shoulder
Nathan leans forward, kisses her exposed thigh
So soft
So smooth
(back to reality) 'm sorry
It's just
(soothing) Shh
: - Lila is shaving herself all over
Shaving and weeping
There are nicks all over her body
She has no eyebrows any more
The hair on her head is hacked off
: - Nathan and Gabrielle are lying naked on the floor
Gabrielle rests her head on Nathan's chest
Was that okay
mean, was  able to
satisfy you
You are an animal
Really
Wow
That's that's terrific to hear from someone so
feminine, so female
love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men
'm glad you're female
(beat) Do you think our boy witnessed the primal scene
Anyway it's time he grew up
'est- ce pa
(sighing, running her fingers along his chest) love chest hair on a man
know it isn't fashionable now, hairy men
But to me it is the very sign of masculinity
Nathan tenses
Gabrielle looks up innocently at him
What is wrong, my darling
Nothing, my darling
All is right with the world
Puff watches from his case
Gabrielle smiles to herself
- Puff testifies
saw it, gentlemen
saw the whole sweaty, passionate, ugly, beautiful act, and to use the vernacular, wanted me some of that
The congressmen laugh appreciatively
The laughter is a little too enthusiastic and goes on a little too long
It stops abruptly
And  think  understood from that moment, that in order to get some, would have to do what they said
In order to experience this primal, basic, animal thing,  would first have to become a civilized, prissy, uptight human
would have to become Nathan
The congressmen nod sadly, in recognition of this reality
: - Puff, in his Lucite case, sits behind a set dinner table
He seems attentive, calm, interested as Nathan teaches him table manners
Gabrielle stands very close, almost possessively close, to Nathan
She wears a lab coat, but it is unbuttoned, and underneath she is wearing a skin-tight black minidress
She strokes the back of Nathan's head as he works with Puff
(slow
talking to an idiot) Excellent, Puff
Now, the lady you're with excuses herself to go powder her nose
The wheels turn in Puff's head
He thinks hard
Then he stands
Gabrielle shrieks and claps happily
Perfect
Perfect, Puff
Nathan leans over and kisses Gabrielle
Puff watches
He makes an exaggerated kissy-face, pursing his lips, trying to imitate Nathan
The phone rings
Gabrielle pulls herself away, giggles as Nathan tries to keep her from going, and picks up the phone
(still giggling) Dr
Bronfman's line
Yes
One moment please
(puts it on hold) Lila
Shit
(takes phone) Hi, honey
: '   - Lila sits on the couch
Eyebrows are attractively drawn onto her face
She wears a very femme blonde wing
Lots of make- up
So, how's it going today
(
) Good
Making progress
Honey, can we talk tonight
You know, about stuff
Things have been so strained for the past three weeks, since you know, and  just want to talk
: - Nathan, phone cradled between shoulder and ear, puts his face in his hand
Gabrielle rests a hand on his shoulder
Everything's fine, honey
We don't need to talk
Besides  have to work late
(
) Please, Nathan
really need this
You've been working late a lot
Nathan looks up helplessly at Gabrielle
Okay, we'll have dinner tonight
Gabrielle gets mad, exhales sharply, pulls her hand away
Nathan gives her a pleading look, grabs for her
She moves away
Yeah
Okay
Be home around seven
Bye
(hangs up) What
'm sorry
What was  supposed to do
(disgusted) don't know, Nathan
What are you supposed to do
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem
Funny
thought that's exactly what you did
You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself
: - Nathan talks
tear runs down his face, mingles with the blood
Funny
still feel guilt
Even dead
One would've hoped
But alas
You know,  really did love Lila
But with her
problem
and then when Gabrielle revealed her feelings
And Gabrielle was so
conventionally female
And she had an accent
was lost from that moment on
But Gabrielle was right
couldn't admit it to myself, this shallowness of character, let alone to Lila
: - Lila and Nathan eat
Lila is in her new, very feminine make- up, wig, and dress
Her table manners are impeccable, almost robotic
There is an awkward silence Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan
just have to know
Of course not
It would just be helpful to know
No
Because, you know, you seem so distant
And you work late every night
And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's
don't know
It feels different
'm just preoccupied
Do you like my new look
Yeah
It's nice
It's really good
'm trying, you know
(starting to cry) 'm trying to be what you want want to be what you want, Nathan
All  want is to be what you want
(embarrassed) Shh
It's okay
(takes her hand) It's okay, Lila
You're what  want
You know that
You're exactly what want
(hopefully, sniffing) Really
Sure
Of course
Because 'm really trying, you know
Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis
(hard to stomach) That's great
've signed up for a ballet class
And look at my nails
real girl
Lila holds out her hands
Her finger nails are polished fire engine red
That's great
It's a great color for you
Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby
: - Lila holds and rocks a swaddled baby
She passes it to Nathan, who looks at it and sees that it's a baby monkey
Nathan shudders
Lila looks on lovingly, oblivious
: '  - Nathan sits with his head in his hands
Wendall listens attentively
So anyway, that's the nightmare 've been having lately
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body
(beat) No, why
Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and  know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair
(revelation) Oh,  see
Yes, that's something to think about
That's very good
That's what you get the big bucks, right
Ha ha
just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila
love Lila
mean, she's a wonderful person
And
she loves me
That's no small potatoes
mean she really loves me
She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me
And she's a good person
truly good person
How rare is that in this world, eh
And how could  stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that
mean, God knows 'm not perfect
What about my eyesight
It's lousy, that's what
Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight
What about my penis
And how do you feel about Gabrielle
Nathan puts his head in his hands and sighs
: - Nathan is holding flash cards up to Puff
Puff tentatively reads aloud from the cards
Gabrielle sits nearby on a stool, fish-netted legs crossed, arms crossed, and an angry expression on her face
Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen
Bravo, Puff
Bravo
Puff smiles happily
Nathan and Puff both look over at Gabrielle for her approval
None is forthcoming
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey
Hmmmph
Gabby, what is it
Hmmph
Hmmph
(beat) Nathan, we have to talk, you and
Fine
Not in front of the boy
Very well
Gabrielle stands, turns, and stomps across the room
Nathan follows her angry, switching hips with his eyes, as does Puff
She exits into the hall
Nathan looks at Puff and shrugs
Puff returns the shrug
Nathan follows Gabrielle into the hall
: - Gabrielle stands there waiting, a troubled look on her face, her eyes brimming
Nathan emerges, tries to embrace her
My little French
(pushing him away) Stop
Get away
What is it
You have to choose Nathan
It's like Sophie's choice
Only it is Nathan's choice
Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice
It is like that
Only it is this
Gabby, you know 'm trying to sort things out
(hard) No
It is now that you must decide
(soft) love you, Doctor Nathan
(hard) but  will not wait
will not be your chippy
will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish
(soft) My love
want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly
from you
Nathan gets a faraway look in his eyes
: - Nathan and Gabrielle sit on a blanket on this otherwise empty beach
There is a light breeze
Gabrielle has one of her breasts exposed and is nursing an infant
Nathan looks at the baby's face
It is angelic
He looks up and smiles at Gabrielle
She smiles back
They kiss
: - Nathan snaps out of his reverie, looks pleadingly at the waiting Gabrielle
love you so much, Gabrielle
But
But
There is a "but," Nathan
But  don't know how to leave Lila
Gabrielle tears off her lab coat
Underneath she is wearing practically nothing, a skimpy black dress
She throws the lab coat at Nathan, turns and storms down the hall
Nathan watches until she disappears around the corner
(quietly) Now there's a butt, Nathan
He brings the lab coat up to his face and breathes in her fragrance
: ' - Lila, all prettied up and civilized and manicured, is setting the table for dinner
She is humming
Nathan walks in the door
Lila doesn't hear him
He stands in the doorway for a moment, watching Lila from behind
His face is blank
Lila catches sight of him
She's startled
Oh
(laughs) didn't see you there, sneaky boy
(runs over and kisses him) You're like a boy sneaking in
(so bored) the back door of a movie theater
Yes, indeed
You remember that from my book
'm touched
(kisses him again) What's wrong
Nothing
Hard day
Gonna have a drink
'll make it
(beats him to the portable bar) 'm so happy, Nathan
Everything's going to be so great
Scotch on the rocks, right
(giggles) Just kidding
know what you drink, mister
know what you drink
(pours and blends and shakes, etc
) Voila
Lila hands Nathan a frothy pink concoction with a pineapple wedge sticking out of it
Thanks
Nathan stares contemplatively out the window and sips his drink
Lila watches him, comes up behind him, puts her arms around him
Nathan cringes, but tries to cover it
Lila feels the cringe, but pretends not to have
She keeps her arms around him for a moment longer, then casually removes them
(fishing) How's work
Cruddy, okay
Are you satisfied
(pouty) No
don't want your work to be cruddy
My assistant quit today
Okay
He was highly valuable to the project
Oh, baby
'm sorry
Can't you hire somebody else
guess
Lila screws up her face in concentration, trying to come with a viable solution to Nathan's problem
Hey
could come work for you know  haven't been all that supportive of this project, but 've come around
Have you
Oh yes, baby
think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being
What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are
Really
Yes
And  want to help
You won't have to pay me, and  was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway
How come
Who needs it
have you and  have being a woman and  have thinking about womanly things
love being a woman because
Such as what womanly things
Such as my man and how to please him
(kisses him) Such as making wonderful dinners for my man
(kisses him again, leads him to the table, sits him down) Such as looking pretty for my man
(kisses him again) And 'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal
: - had sold my fucking soul
: - let her sell her soul
stood by as she did it
It's inexcusable
(beat) At the time though  thought it might help
: - When she came to work with Nathan, she seemed different, gentlemen, don't know, somehow soulless
: - Puff is in his case in formal evening wear in a makeshift opera box
There is a mannequin woman sitting next to him and a boom box pumping out Beethoven's Fidelio
Puff seems attentive, refined, occasionally bringing a pair of opera glasses up to his eyes, pinky extended
Outside the case, Nathan and Lila look on
The opera is over
Puff stands, applauds, yells "Bravo", and tosses a rose in the direction of the imaginary stage
The rose hits the Lucite wall and falls to the floor
Nathan and Lila stand and applaud Puff
Bravo to you, Puff
That was wonderful
Puff smiles and performs a foppish bow, almost a curtsy
He picks up the rose, sniffs it, dramatically savoring its scent
: '  - Nathan and Gabrielle are having sex
They are focused and intent, although Gabrielle keeps chatting
You were wonderful today, darling
Such authority with the ape-man boy
It made me so hot for you
Unnhh
The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and
everywhere else, too
Urgh
Take me, darling
Tame your little monkey of love
There is a mutual climax
moment of silence, then a spent Nathan rolls off onto his side of the bed
We see that it is really Lila in bed with him, not Gabrielle
(sighing) Well, 'm tamed, Dr
Bronfman
Nathan stares up at the ceiling
'm glad
my assistant
: - We see a montage of interactions between Nathan, Puff, and Lila
1) Nathan demonstrates the proper way to taste wine: sniffing the cork, swishing the wine around in the glass, sipping, nodding in the affirmative to the waiter
Puff, inside his case, imitates it perfectly
2) Nathan shows Puff a flashcard which reads: "'ll start tonight with the foie gras
" 3) Puff is holding up a small hand mirror and trimming nose hairs
Lila applauds
4) Puff juggles three balls while riding a unicycle
5) Puff, dressed as Peter Pan, stands with legs spread and hands on hips
He is singing " Gotta Crow
" 6) Puff, dressed in an apron and chef's hat, is tossing a salad
There are two types of vinegar to choose from
He hesitates, then chooses the balsamic
Nathan and Lila applaud
7) Puff, in a smoking jacket and smoking a pipe, is sitting in an easy chair, next to a fake fire and a fake sleeping dog, and reading a book of poems by Yeats
Lila and Nathan, outside the case, applaud and embrace
think he's ready
Oh boy
(jumping up) Oh boy
Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar
don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case
Okay
That's fair
Nathan unlocks the case
Puff tentatively steps out into the world
He hugs Nathan
It's a grateful, obsequious, slightly pathetic hug
Nathan hugs him back, but he's keeping him at a distance
Puff pulls himself out of the hug, but still rests his hands on Nathan's shoulders and looks him in the eye, almost like a lover
Then he parts with Nathan and goes over to embrace Lila
She graciously receives him
After a moment in the embrace, Puff starts dry-humping Lila
Lila can't get out of his clutches
No, Puff
Bad
Nathan presses a button, which shocks Puff and sends him flying
Puff appears disoriented, then gets up off the floor, brushes himself off, and turns to Lila with a bow of his head
My apologies, madam
It's okay, Puff
Shan't happen again
: - Lila, Nathan, and Puff walk along
Puff is astounded by everything he sees
He looks with wonderment at the tall buildings, the cars, the many different types of people
He looks like an idiot
: - Puff, Lila, and Nathan are eating lunch
Everything is very proper
Puff is doing wonderfully
This is great, Puff
You're doing fine
'm loving this
It's such a treat to be out and about
What a wonderful invention a city is
The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors
The waitress comes by
How is everything
Just spectacular
Great salmon
Fantastico
You've got to give me the recipe
My compliments to the chef
'm glad you
Puff stands and grabs her and starts humping her
Puff, no
Nathan presses a button on a small black box
Puff falls to the floor
The waitress looks on, sort of confused
And will that be all today
: - Lila, Nathan, and Puff are in the back seat of the moving taxi
It shan't happen again
swear it
'm just getting my sea legs, you know
(patting Puff on the back) It's an animal urge, Puff
It's nothing to be ashamed of
Lila
Tell him
Lila looks at Nathan, amends her statement
(to Puff) You just have to control it
We're not apes
Thank you very much for that
: - Puff is sitting in a chair and facing a screen
The collar is around his neck
Nathan and Lila stand behind him at a slide projector
don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor understand the problem
Humor me, Puff
It's essential that am able to trust you to function independently in the world
bow to your expertise in these matters
Lila
Lila dims the lights and switches on the projector
An image of a pretty, fully clothed woman appears on the screen
Puff's eyes widen, but he remains seated
Good
You're doing fine
The slide changes to a naked woman standing in a neutral position, no expression on her face
Puff twitches, but stays seated
Excellent
The slide changes to another photo of the same woman in the same position, but with a seductive smile on her face
Puff clutches the arms of the chairs
You're doing very nicely, Puff
'm pleased
The slide changes to another picture of the same woman, this time she is naked, has her back to the camera, is sticking her butt out, and looking over her shoulder at the viewer with shiny, heavily lipsticked, pursed lips
Puff is shaking
Great
Puff leaps out of his chair screaming and lunges for the screen
Nathan grabs the black box and jolts him
Puff goes flying in the air and lands with a crack
He heaves for a while, then leaps up and runs for the screen again
Again Nathan shocks him
Again he lands on the floor
He heaves, stands, lunges for the screen again
Nathan shocks him
This happens seven more times
Smoke is pouring out from the collar
Puff struggles to his feet
Looks at the screen
He shrugs
(unimpressed) Eh
Puff sits down in his chair, and studies his finger nails
Nathan switches off the projector
Excellent work, Puff
Extra desert tonight
Yahoo
Tomorrow, the acid test
: - This is a Hooters-type establishment called "Chester's
" The waitresses are very busty and in Tight t-shirts which are emblazoned with the name of the restaurant
Lila, Nathan, and Puff sit at a table
Puff studies his menu intently, not daring to look up
Lila looks around uncomfortably
waitress approaches
' How you all doin' today
(cheerily) Very well
(awkwardly) Very well
(looking down) Very well
' Good enough
What can  get for you
Puff, why don't you order first
(looking at menu) Uh, what's a Reuben, please
The waitress leans over to study the menu
Her breasts are in Puff's face
' The what, honey
Oh, the Reuben
That's a sandwich with corned beef and sauer
That's fine
That's what 'll have
Corned beef is a good food
: - Lila, Nathan, and Puff walk along
Puff, 'm proud of you
You did remarkably well under difficult circumstances
Absolutely
Puff jumps up and down excitedly
Did
tried so hard
really concentrated
Oh, 'm so happy
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you
(happily) Extra dessert
Even better
: - Lila, Nathan, and Puff enter
Puff sees his Lucite case
It has been transformed into a bachelor pad
Inside is a king-size bed, a , a couch, coffee table, shelves lined with books, a small kitchenette
There is a curtain which can be drawn for privacy
Puff is taken aback
Surprise
Puff gasps and runs into the room
He is thrilled
Nathan holds up a key
Free to come and go as you please
There's some "mad money" in the night table drawer
(taking the key, hugging Nathan) It's wonderful
Do you think 'm ready
Do you really
trust that you'll make good, mature decisions
trust that you'll do the proper thing
Oh,  will
(gravely) Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me
don't want to disappoint you
Good
Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do
(taking it in) Got it
: '   - Lila and Nathan sit as far as possible from each other and read books
Nathan looks at his watch
: '  - Puff, dressed identically to Nathan, reads Moby Dick and smokes a pipe
He distractedly taps his foot, stands and studies a Monet print on the wall
His foot is still nervously tapping
He checks his watch
: '   - Nathan stands
'm going to go down and check on Puff
See how he's holding up
(stretching) Should  come with
Nah
You just relax
How's the book
(lazily, happily) Ummm
It's good
Nathan kisses Lila on the forehead
won't be long
: - Nathan drives with a determined look on his face
: '  - The apartment is a mess
Every single light is on
Gabrielle is lounging in a stained nightshirt with a dopey cartoon bear on the front
She's got some sort of pimple medication dabbed on her face
She unconsciously but ferociously bites her nails as she watches  and talks on the phone
There is no trace of a French accent
(into phone) You're kidding
Holy shit
(beat) Yeah, no duh
had a wild hair up my ass over that for a month
There's a knock at the door
Yeah
What
(
) Hi
It's Nathan
Gabrielle's eyes widen
She jumps up from the couch and starts straightening
(into phone) Call you back
(hangs up, assumes French accent) You bastard
What do you want
(
) just want to talk
(ripping off her nightshirt) We have nothing to say
You are a rotten bastard, that's what
: - Nathan stands there leaning against the door
Please
Just one minute of your time
(
) Why
You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American
Now  hate you
No, don't hate you;  don't even think about you
've got some things to tell you
: '  - Gabrielle is standing in front of a mirror, holding different sexy outfits up to herself, trying to decide
Like what
(
) Well,  think it would be easier if could talk to you in person
What for
: - We hear banging and rustling and arranging coming from inside the apartment
Well,  think
(
) You think too much
need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks
is what  need
What
You heard me
You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what am saying to you
Go away from here
(turning away) Well, look, 'm sorry to have bothered you
He starts to head down the hall
(
) (beat, then screaming) All right, already
Come in if you must
The door's open, you son of a bitch
Nathan heads back to the apartment, tries the knob
The door's open
He enters
: '  - The lights are low
The place is neat
Cool jazz plays quietly in the background
Candles are lit
Gabrielle is nowhere to be found
Nathan takes it all in
It's quite seductive
(
) In here, you lousy piece of merde
Nathan follows her voice
He exits into the bedroom
: '  - Candles in here also
Gabrielle, now made up and in a satin teddy, lounges in bed, eating cherries from a bowl
Nathan just stares
She is slightly out of breath, but trying to conceal it
film of perspiration glistens on her brow
(testy) Well
God, you're beautiful
Please
look a mess
No
You look so beautiful
Anyway
Come already to the point
'm
'm going to leave Lila can't stop thinking about you
've moved on
No
've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry
(raging) That goddamn Neanderthal
'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen
Did you know that
(calm, dismissive) That's not how he tells it
Of course not, that Swedish thief
He's a thief of hearts
(beat) love you, Gabrielle
(dismissive) Hunh
Just give me some time to let Lila down easily
She's a really nice girl and  don't want to hurt her more than is necessary
(beat) You hurt me, you know, when you made Nathan's Choice
Does that not even matter to you, you pig
Gabrielle cries quietly
Nathan moves closer to her
He strokes her hair
Can you ever forgive me
Gabrielle looks up at him
Her expression is noncommittal and pouty, but she grabs his arm and pulls him down on top of her
: - Puff, dressed a bit like he's a Victorian dandy, sits in the front row and watches a naked woman on stage dancing topless cocktail waitress comes by with a fresh drink for him
She takes away his empty glass
He is horribly drunk and holding himself with exaggerated rigidity -- an amateur drinker's attempt to look sober
: '  - Nathan enters
Lila sits on the couch still reading
She looks up
Hey
Nathan kisses her on the forehead
You were gone a long time
(sits down next to her) Yeah
Puff and  got into a big, philosophical discussion
He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now
He's going to make us famous, Lila
So he's doing okay
Seemed fine
Quiet evening enjoying his new digs
That's funny because, you know, just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside
He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore
(then casually) Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey
Shit
And what did you do tonight, honey
've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila
(pointedly) And what did you do tonight, honey
fucked her
Okay
fucked her
'm sorry
But that's what the hell did
(standing) Do you know what  gave up to be with you
Yes
gave up my soul, my beliefs gave up my body hair
Yeah, well, 'm sorry
The human heart is a strange thing
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart
(moving to her) Lila
Lila turns around and slugs him, square on the jaw, hard, knocking him to the floor
How's that for ladylike, Nathan
Lila opens up the hall closet and pulls out a suitcase
: - Lila looks pale and shaken
She smokes
For two weeks  holed myself up in a motel room
didn't even know who was
My world had crumbled
There is nothing that makes you feel dirtier than finally deciding to sell your soul and finding no buyers
: - Lila lies in bed watching
She is a mess
The room is a mess
The wig is off
There's hair sprouting on her face
The curtains are drawn
There is a knock at the door
No maid service
For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob
(
) Lila, it's Rosie
(beat) Go the fuck away, Rosie
(
) Please, honey, let me in
Rose, please go away
(
) Lila,  want to help you
Lila gets up, drags herself to the door, and opens it
Rose stands there trying not to let it show how lousy Lila looks
How'd you know where  was
Nathan told my brother
Your brother should have his license revoked
Yeah, although 'm not going to turn him in
like hearing the dirt
(suddenly crying) Why didn't your brother tell you that Nathan was having an affair
Rose holds Lila, who hangs on her as she weeps
don't know, honey
don't know
Maybe he just didn't want to get involved
Oh, Rosie
Let's get you out of here
Come stay with me until you get your strength back
(cheerily) Free electrolysis, if you want it
We'll get that face of yours cleared up in no time
Lila mulls it over
She looks back at the hotel room
It's depressing
She sniffs in her snot
Yeah
gotta get myself together want to look good
If 'm gonna fuck with Nathan, and  am,  want him to want to fuck me when  do it
: This sequence is Lila getting her strength back, both emotional and physical
It is intercut with scenes of Nathan and Gabrielle taking Puff on the lecture circuit
1) Lila eating a good breakfast
2) Lila struggling to do push-ups
3) Lila getting electrolysis on her face
4) Lila reading Nietzsche
5) Lila jogging
: - bearded psychologist addresses a crowd of bearded psychologists
and so without further ado, give you Dr
Nathan Bronfman and Puff
The room bursts into applause as Nathan and Puff walk out onstage, both in tuxes
Nathan stands behind a podium, Puff sits casually, legs crossed, in a chair
Thank you
Let's get right to it
Here we have Puff the day of his capture
video of Puff naked in his Lucite case, clawing at it, shrieking like a banshee, and neurotically hopping up and down, is projected onto a screen behind Nathan
There is a collective gasp from the audience
Puff watches the video with amused detachment
The video stops
And here he is today, a scant three months later
Puff stands, bows slightly to the audience
They burst into vigorous applause
Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage
It would be my pleasure, doctor
(behind podium) Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr
Nathan Bronfman
To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement
Dr
Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp
From compulsive masturbation to
: - Gabrielle waits in the wings
(
) And, so, goodnight, adieu, until we meet again, au revoir
The audience bursts into thunderous applause
Gabrielle joins in
Nathan and Puff hurry off stage
Gabrielle embraces Nathan
You were wonderful
Was
wasn't a tad stiff
Don't be silly
(hugs Puff) And you were wonderful, too
loved the way you said " au revoir
" Puff and Gabrielle exchange a look
She discreetly pinches Puff's butt, smiles, winks
Nathan doesn't see this
He puts his arm around Gabrielle
Come on, you two
Let's go celebrate
Nathan and Gabrielle walk on ahead
Puff tags behind, watching Gabrielle's delightful walk
: - Puff sits up on his bed, looking dejected
He listens to the sounds of Nathan and Gabrielle having sex in the adjoining room
He looks at his watch, gets up, gets dressed
: - sweaty, sick-looking Puff watches a porno film in a little booth
It ends
He steps out into the fluorescent glare of the store
He walks out past several skulking degenerates
: - Puff exits the bookstore, walks down the street checking out the tawdry hookers
He chooses one
She leads him into a dark alley
: 6) Lila in a Tai Chi class
7) Lila doing jumping jacks
8) Lila reading The Art of War
9) Lila doing stomach crunches
10) Lila doing chin ups
11) Lila swimming laps
12) Lila getting more electrolysis
: - Puff is on stage demonstrating his ballroom dancing technique
He is waltzing with Gabrielle
Nathan stops the music, and picks up a microphone
Now the tango
Nathan puts a tango record on
Gabrielle and Puff perform expertly
The audience applauds
: - Gabrielle, Nathan, and Puff are eating dinner
think it went swimmingly today
You two make an excellent team
Gabrielle and Puff look at each other
She touches Puff's knee under the table
Nathan is busy eating
: - Puff paces as he listens to sex noises from the next room
: - Puff walks along checking out the prostitutes
He signals to one with a nonchalant jerk of his head
: 13) Lila doing one-handed push-ups
14) Lila rolling on the ground with a rifle
15) Lila, in boxing gloves, punching a bag
16) Lila reading the Kama Sutra
17) Lila getting electrolysis
: - Puff addresses the crowd
Lila and Nathan look on adoringly from the wings
To be taken from the depths of ignorance and depravity and raised to heights of culture and refinement
This is the priceless gift bestowed upon me by Dr
Nathan Bronfman
Thunderous applause
: - Puff leans against the wall drinking whiskey from a bottle, as a prostitute, down on her knees in front of him, does her business
The look on his face is not one of pleasure or even release
It is a look of decay
: 18) Lila does chin ups
Her sweaty, muscular arms glisten in the sun
19) Lila wind sprinting
20) Lila getting electrolysis
Rose moves away from her
Done
(standing triumphantly) Ready
: - Nathan and Gabrielle, in lab coats, sit chatting with Puff
Puff sneaks glances at Gabrielle's legs and cleavage
She makes his viewing possible
(off clipboard) So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men
Terrific
We're all going to be rich and famous
Nathan kisses Gabrielle
Thanks to you, Nate
Thanks to you, Buddy
And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance
Puff blushes
(to Gabrielle) And of course to you, my sweet, for your
moral support
(applauding) here, here
Gabrielle kisses Nathan while glancing at Puff
midget in a business suit enters
It's the sour-looking guy from the freak show
Excuse me, are you Dr
Bronfman
Is that a little boy
(teaching) No, Puff
This man is a midget
In actuality, they prefer to be called "Little People
" Isn't that correct, my good man
Yes sir
Little People
This Little Person is actually a fully grown adult man, Puff, believe it or not, who, due to a genetic anomaly, is miniature but perfectly proportioned
(to midget) Turn, please
The midget turns
(jotting in notebook) Interesting
Now, my diminutive friend, what can do for you
The midget pulls out a gun
You can get into that goddamn Lucite bachelor pad for starters, Goliath
Nathan, Gabrielle, and Puff look frightened
They stand and back into the case
(to Puff) Not you, Joyboy
Puff stops in his tracks
Nathan and Gabrielle continue to back into the case
What is this about
We have no money on these premises
Please if you are from some little person terrorist fringe group
(loud and scary) Shut up
Nathan and Gabrielle hurry into the case
The midget closes and locks the door behind them
Puff is frozen with fear
Lila enters
She looks different now
Savage
Strong
Kind of sexy
She wears guerilla-like black clothing and a beret over her closely hacked-off hair
She also carries a gun
Lila
That's Lila
Shut up
Yeah, this is Lila, cunt
And don't let the hirsutism fool you
know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine
know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you
Eat shit, thumbtack dick
(to Midget) Thank you, Frank
You're the best
Lila kisses the midget on the top of the head
Anything for you, Lila
See, Frank and  are kindred spirits
We both know what it's like to be shunned because of our appearance
We both know how easily that turns into self-hatred
Amen
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition
Rose enters hurriedly, carrying rope
She bends over and kisses Frank hard on the mouth for a long moment, then: (to Lila) Sorry 'm late, parking is a bitch at this place
Lila looks over and sees the two trained mice in the Lucite case sitting at a tiny table and very politely eating their lunch
One of the mice makes eye contact with Lila
: - Lila is naked in the bathroom and about to kill herself when she makes eye contact with the mouse on the shelf next to the tub
: - Lila brings her focus back to the room
Everyone is watching her, waiting for some direction
Uh, tie them up, Rosie
If you will
With pleasure
Frank keeps the gun on Gabrielle and Nathan
Rose enters the case and begins to tie them up and gag them
: - Puff is sitting in the car
The electronic collar is back around his neck
Lila holds the black control box, and the Lucite case with the two mice in it
She stands outside the car with Frank and Rose
'm going to miss you
Oh, Rosie
And 'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me
Shut up, you
Lila laughs and hugs her
like you so much, with or without hair
(confidentially) But don't spread that around
Bad for business
'm really glad you two found each other
Frank and Rose put their arms around each other
Frank is exactly crotch-high to Rose
We're soul mates
Souls have nothing to do with it, babe
'll be in touch
No you won't
But it's okay
You have stuff you gotta do
Lila tears up
So does Rose
They just stand there for a moment, then: (choked) Gotta go
Lila hurries around the car, gets in, and drives off
Rose and Frank embrace
Frank nestles
Rose sighs contentedly
: - Lila's car drives along
Puff looks nervously out the window
: - Lila and Puff are driving in silence on a dirt road through the woods
Lila pulls off the road, drives to a place where the car will be camouflaged, and parks
Stay
Puff stays in the car
Lila gets out, pulls the Lucite mouse case from the back seat
: - Lila puts the case on the ground and unlatches it
The mice looks confused at first
Then the male mouse pushes the door open and holds it for the female mouse, who exits
The male mouse follows her, and closes the door behind him
He turns to Lila, nods, then extends his arm for the female mouse to hold on to
She does, and they walk off together on their hind legs into the woods
Lila sighs, and turns to Puff
Out
Puff gets out casually, then makes a mad dash for the road
Lila calmly presses the button on her black box
Puff spasms and falls to the ground
Bad
Puff stays on the ground, breathing hard
Get up
Puff does
Take off your clothes
Puff does
So does Lila
She is covered with hair, except for her face
But whereas Puff is now white and soft-looking, Lila is tan and taut and muscular
This is a reversal of the way both of them were when they first met
Puff seems taken with her body
We're going back to nature, you and 'm going to retrain you
'm going to make you free again if have to kill you doing it
But  like being human now
Lila shocks Puff
He falls to the ground
You what
want to be the way  was before
(sweet) Good
'll show you how, apey
: - Puff and Lila have built makeshift shelter out of leaves and twigs
They are sitting around a campfire, naked and dirty, roasting a couple of skinned squirrels on sticks
The black box rests in Lila's lap
Puff looks at the roasting squirrel, is repulsed
Nice night
Talking is to be kept to a minimum
Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none
Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves
There is no other reason
Puff begins to disagree
Lila's hand hovers over the button
He stops himself
(confused) agree
Lila shocks Puff
You lose
Any answer is the wrong answer
: - Puff and Lila lie seperately under blankets of moss
The breathing is heavy
Both seem to be sleeping
Puff opens his eyes and tries to extricate himself from the moss without making any noise
Lila presses the button and Puff falls in a quivering mess
(whisper) You'll thank me eventually, Puff
Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you
What an enchanting picture you paint of our future together
Lila shocks Puff once again
As he spasms, we: : - Puff testifies
And so commenced my reeducation, gentlemen
Lila taught me so much
She was a stern but fair teacher
And over time,  began to remember the carefree joy of living in a pure state of being
But something else happened as well, something perhaps distinctly human
began to fall in love with Lila
: - Lila and Puff are naked and collecting mushrooms and berries
Time has passed
Both Lila and Puff are dirtier and hairier
Puff still wears his collar
Lila bends over to pick a mushroom
Puff looks at her from behind
Boy, you look so good from this ang
Lila turns, puts her finger to her lips in a gentle "no talking" reminder, then shocks the hell out of Puff
He spasms and falls on top of her, knocking her to the ground
He regains his composure, finds himself on top of Lila
They look at each other for a moment
Then they kiss
It's a violent kiss
They grope each other
This is primal sex now
In the dirt
Sweaty
Loud grunting
Lila even presses the shock button at the right moment
Puff seems to like it in this context
: '  - Nathan and Gabrielle are in bed, making love
It is gentle, romantic, in good taste -- in direct contrast to the animal, violent sex Puff and Lila are having
They finish
Nathan pulls himself off of Gabrielle and falls onto his back, staring up at the ceiling
penny for your thoughts, mon cheri
don't know
Something's missing
: - Gabrielle, Nathan, and Nathan's parents eat dinner
Nathan's parents are in clown make-up
There is a long silence
Nathan is still sad
Gabrielle steals glances at Nathan's parents
Finally Nathan speaks
(uninterested) So, Mother and Father, how's Godspell going
How did you know we
The parents look at each other burst out laughing
Tell him, Harold
It's going famously, son, famously
(despondent) 'm glad
Harold, ask Nathan what's wrong
Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong
don't know
: - Nathan and Gabrielle are in bed
Nathan stares up at the ceiling
Finally: want our boy back
(sadly) Oui
That bitch
worked so hard
We worked so hard, you and
He would've made us famous
We still have you and
know
And that's great
But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if could find him and bring him back
Where do we look for little lost Puff
have some thoughts
think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape
That is horrible
Apes are dirty
No
You better believe they're dirty
And smelly
And messy
And they don't know their forks from their assholes
Nathan, seemingly in the grips of a sudden horrific migraine, scrunches his face and holds his ears
He relaxes a bit, and gets out of bed
He walks across the room, pulls on some pants, and picks up a container called "Stop Buggin' Me, Sunny
" 'm going alone
This could be dangerous
(pulling covers up and turning away from him onto her side) Okay, my sweet
Good night
little resistance would be nice, damn it
(without opening her eyes) Please let me go with you
No
Okay
: - Nathan is driving along a wooded dirt road
He's in his immaculate safari suit
He looks tired
He stops the car, pulls out a gun, and gets out
: - Nathan gets out of the car and runs into the woods
We follow
(yelling) Aha
He looks around there is no one there
He sighs and walks back to his car, pulls out a map and marks an area with a red
: - Nathan is in his underwear
He is ironing his safari suit as he talks on the phone
No luck yet, my sweet
We see an unfolded map on the bed
There are red 's in almost all the state parks along the east coast
: - Lila and puff are having sex again next to a campfire
Now Lila is wearing the collar, and Puff is giving her well timed shocks
They giggle and kiss after they finish
Puff sits up
He holds his stomach and grunts hungrily
Lila grunts back
She stands and retrieves a sack of berries
Puff and Lila greedily, gluttonously stuff their faces
Lila takes some berries and smashes them against Puff's face
She laughs heartily
He looks annoyed for a second, but then grabs a handful and squishes them against Lila's face
Pretty soon they are having a berry war and are covered in purple stains
They hug each other, out of breath and laughing
: - Lila smiles
It was paradise
(beat, sadly) At least for a tiny little while
: - Lila and Puff lie naked in a tree, lazily soaking up the midday sun
There is a rustling in the bushes
They both look up, alert but calm
Nathan, immaculate in his safari suit, appears in the clearing
He holds a gun
Aha
Finally
've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio
Ugnh
Ugnh
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time  spent teaching you
We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake
Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject
Unn
Down from the tree
Both of you
Keep your hands where  can see them
Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur
Nathan laughs heartily, haughtily, at his joke as Lila and Puff climb down from the tree
Look at you two
You both disgust me
Oook
Oook
Shut up
(to Puff) gave you
life
created you in my image, Puff
took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners
And this is how you repay me
By heading back to the ooze first chance you get
should leave you here with Lila the ape woman
It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap
But 'm not going to
You're too valuable to me
Totally selfish of me
You serve my purpose
But if you had any smarts you would realize that  serve your purpose as well
Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit
Ooka
Don't worry, Lila
You can stay don't have any interest in you anymore
(to Puff) 'mon, monkey boy
Puff looks at Lila
Lila shrugs helplessly
Puff reaches out to touch her hand
Now
Puff looks at Lila again
She jerks her head in the direction of Nathan
Puff sighs and moves to Nathan
Nathan prods Puff, and they head off through the trees
Suddenly Puff elbows Nathan
Nathan grunts, doubles over
Puff turns, lunges, and the two wrestle on the ground
Puff pries the gun from Nathan's hand, and jumps up
Nathan stands also, backing away
Puff has the gun trained on Nathan
Lila runs to Puff, stands behind him
Puff, put the gun down
Ounpoo
Ungh
Let's be reasonable human beings here
We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we
(jumping up and down like a chimp) Unka unka unka unka unka
Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life
'll just go on my way
You'll never see me again
(to Lila, guiltily) have to talk
Is that okay
Lila nods
(to Nathan) You did create me in your image, Nathan
Before you  was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me
After you became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings
In a word, Nathan, became you
Lila has reintroduced me to myself
And, incidentally, what 'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth
Before when  killed, it was for food or in self-defense
Now  will kill for revenge
Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan
And learned abstract thinking from you
No
Puff, don't
Puff shoots
crow screams
The fluttering of wings
The bullet hits Nathan in the head
He falls
: - Lila sobs
Then  shot Nathan
: - Puff dabs his eye
Then Lila shot Nathan
: - Nathan talks
Then Puff shot me
Then  died
That's all  know
That's the end of my story
Do  get to go to heaven now
(beat) Or is it
hell
(beat) Or
what
(beat) just stay here, is it
just stay here and tell it again
And after that
Again
And after
(sighs) Yes
Yes, of course
(sighs, clears his throat) We move into an extreme close-up
(beginning again) don't even know what sorry means anymore
It's odd
When  was alive knew -- maybe it was all  knew
: - Lila runs to Nathan
She kneels beside him
He's dead
(calmly) We bury the body
We disappear into the woods
Nobody knows
(beat, then quietly) No
This is the end of the road
There's a dead human being here
For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody
Forget him, Lila
We'll disappear
We'll never talk about it again
We'll never talk again period love you
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's
Maybe more so, because  knew it was wrong and  went along with it anyway
'm taking responsibility for the murder
want you to go back to your old life
won't let you do that
shot the bastard
And 'm glad
No
Go back to the woods
This is a sacrifice  need to make
In my world we have something called penance
It's another abstraction, but  had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent
It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't
See,  could never be free again anyway, so  might as well be in jail
(beat) Then 'll live for both of us, Lila
'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest
For both of us
(tearing up) That's what 'm counting on
(an idea) But first 'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind
(shrugs) Okay
If you think it will help
: - Lila, now in prison coveralls, sits in a dayroom with other women convicts
She is watching a  mounted on the wall
Puff is testifying
And so, gentlemen, that is my story
agreed to testify before this committee because  hoped to convey to the American public that there is indeed a paradise lost
Human beings have become so enamored of their technologies and their intellectual prowess and their fancy gourmet foods, that they've forgotten to look to the Earth as a teacher
This is hubris, my friends
And my story of destruction and betrayal is proof of that
will keep my promise to Lila
will shed this suit and go back into the wilderness
will live out my days naked and free
Thank you, sir
Your story has touched us all deeply
We will pass some legislation addressing this problem
Thank you
That is all  ask
(to camera) Good-bye, Lila
take you with me in my untamed heart
Puff stands and exits the auditorium
Flashbulbs flash
In the prison common room, Lila wipes a tear from her eye
She seems genuinely happy
She looks out a small barred window and sees a bluebird light there, then fly away
: - Puff walks along, a man on a mission
As he walks he sheds articles of clothing
He is followed by reporters and cameramen and celebrity hounds
Soon he is naked
: - Puff walks along, naked
People cheer from porches
: - Puff walks along
He is still followed by reporters
Cows watch the parade
: - Puff walks along a dirt road
He is about to disappear into the forest
An older woman rushes out from the crowd
Wait
(turning) Yes
saw you on -Span
've been looking for you for thirty years
Then there you were, such a beautiful, beautiful grown man
The older woman starts to cry
Mother
Yes
Derek
Puff holds out his hand for her to shake
Flashbulbs flash
(formally) It's a pleasure to meet you, mother
But 'm an ape like dad was
(checks watch) And  have to go back into the woods now
forever
(resigned) Yes,  suppose so
suppose  knew that was going to be what you would say
It's good to see you again though
Yes
'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something
'm an ape, mom
'm an ape
And apes don't drop lines
His mother weeps
Puff gently rests his hand on her shoulder for a moment, then he turns and waves to the reporters
The crowd bursts into applause
Flashbulbs flash
Puff jogs into the woods
There is a collective sigh, and then everyone turns and heads back in the direction from which they came
We hold on the woods for a moment
car pulls up
Puff hurries out of the woods and jumps in the passenger side of the car
: - Puff leans over and kisses Gabrielle, who is driving the car
Hello, my little boy
Hey, ma
Did you bring any clothes
'm freezing my ass off
Oui
Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked
Great
(putting on suit) God, 've wanted you forever
Gabrielle giggles
Puff kisses her
Say my name
Gabrielle
(eyes glistening) You remind me so much of Nathan
Like father, like son
(stroking his face) You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie
Woof
This turns Gabrielle on
She kisses him passionately
When the kiss runs its course, Puff speaks
Arf
Gabrielle kisses him again, even more passionately this time As much as  loved Nathan, 'm not sorry she killed him, if it means can have you
Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet
(putting her finger to his lips) Hush
No, it is never terrible to be in love
Nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union
(beat) 'm not sorry she killed him either
Nathan was wonderful
He was erudite and sophisticated and charming
You are all that, too
But you have something more
You have a bit of the animal in you
They smile flirtatiously at each other
Puff leans over and kisses Gabrielle's neck
Let's go eat, 'm starved
French
Oui
: - The car makes a screeching u-turn
It disappears in the direction of the city
When the dust clears, we see the two white mice standing there on the side of the road, shivering and emaciated
The male holds out his the thumb and the female holds a tiny little sign which reads: New York
There is a look of hopelessness in their beady black eyes
