"" Screenplay by Alexander Payne & Jim Taylor Based on the novel by Rex Pickett May 29, 2003 : at a door and distant dog
, a  -- The rapping, at first tentative and polite, grows insistent
Then we hear someone get out of bed
(
) the fuck
is opened, and the black gives way to , the way one experiences the first glimpse of day amid, say, a hangover
is there
(
) Yeah
Hi, Miles
Can you move your car, please
(
) Why
The painters got to put the truck in, and you didn't park too good
(
) (a sigh, then --) Yeah, hold on
He closes the door with a
'   - -- , Wearing only underwear, a bathrobe and clogs, comes out of his unit and heads toward the street
He passes some   waiting to work
He climbs into his twelve-year-old  , parked far from the curb and blocking part of the driveway
The car starts fitfully
As he pulls away, the guys begin backing up the truck
- Miles rounds the corner and finds a new parking spot
- He cuts the engine, exhales a long breath and brings his hands to his head in a gesture of headache pain or just anguish
He leans back in his seat, closes his eyes, and soon
'  - The door bursts open
Miles runs into the kitchen, looking just past camera
Fuck
-- that reads 10:50
-- Miles hurriedly throws clothes into a suitcase
Yeah, no,  know  said 'd be there by noon, but there's been all this work going on at my building, and it's like a total nightmare, and had a bunch of stuff to deal with this morning
But 'm on my way
'm out the door right this second
It's going to be great
Yeah
Bye
'  - -- Miles has a  propped open on his knees
He turns a page, lost in his reading
-- Miles
-- Miles
- Miles finally makes it to the front of the line
Hey, Miles
Hey, Simon
Triple espresso, please
Rough night, huh
(ringing it up) For here
No, 'm running late
Make it to go
And give me a New York Times and

The puzzle is about 1/3 finished

The finished puzzle lies on the passenger seat

Look what the cat dragged
Hi, everybody
Mr
Erganian and Jack get to their feet and shake hands with Miles
Jack remains affable, but we can discern his genuine irritation
About time you got here, bud
Mr
Prompt
We were thinking maybe you took the wrong way and went to Tijuana and they didn't let you back in
The Erganians laugh
Miles works up a smile too
had to bribe them
More lame laughter
Hey, Miles
(leaning in to kiss Christine) Seriously though, the freeway was unbelievable today
Unbelievable
Bumper to bumper the whole way
People getting an early start on the weekend, guess
Granted  got a late start, but still
Although Mr
Erganian presses  on the remote, he keeps watching for an extended moment, as do Jack and Miles
Christine, why don't you ask Miles about the cake
Oh, good idea
Here, Miles, come to the kitchen with me
Don't bother him with that
We got to get going
(taking Miles's hand) It'll just take a second
- Jack and the Erganians surround Miles as he eats from a plate with two pieces of  -- one white, one dark
Jack tells us you are publishing a book
Congratulations
Yes, congratulations
Miles shoots Jack a look
Mr
Erganian gets some ice cubes from the refrigerator door
Yeah, well, it's not exactly finalized yet, but, um, there has been some interest and -- (to Jack) Your friend is modest
Yeah, Miles, don't be so modest
Indulge them
Don't make me out to be a liar
What subject is your book
Non- fiction
No, it's a novel
Fiction
Although there's a lot from my own life, so guess technically some of it is non- fiction
Good,  like non-fiction
There is so much to know about the world that think reading a story someone just invented is kind of a waste of time
So which one do you like better
like them both, but if pressed 'd have to say  prefer the dark
(to Christine) See
- -- The Erganians wave good-bye
-- Miles accelerates as he and Jack wave back
Where the fuck were you, man
was dying in there
We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now
can't help the traffic
Come on
You're fucking hungover
Okay, there was a tasting last night
But  wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up
Check out the box
Jack turns around, and starts rooting around in a Why did you tell them my book was being published
You said you had it all lined up
No,  didn't
What  said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum
Yeah, Conundrum
and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor
She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and
It's always like this
It's always a fucking waiting game
've been through it too many times already
don't know
Senior editor
Sounds like you're in to me
It's a long shot, all right
And Conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway
'm not getting my hopes up
've stopped caring
That's it
've stopped caring
Jack sits back in his seat holding up a bottle of and
But  know it's going to happen this time
can feel it
This is the one
'm proud of you, man
You're the smartest guy  know
Jack now begins to remove the foil from the champagne bottle
Don't open that now
It's warm
Come on, we're celebrating
say we pop it
That's a 1992 Byron
It's really rare
Don't open it now
've been saving it
Jack untwists the wire
Instantly the cork pops off, and a fountain of champagne erupts
For Christ's Sake, Jack
You just wasted like half of it
Jack begins pouring two glasses
Shut up
(handing Miles a glass) Here's to a great week
(coming around) Yes
Absolutely
Despite your crass behavior, 'm really glad we're finally getting this time together
Yeah
You know how long 've been begging to take you on the wine tour
was beginning to think it was never going to happen
They clink and drink
Oh, that's tasty
100% Pinot Noir
Single vineyard
They don't even make it anymore
Pinot Noir
How come it's white
Doesn't noir mean dark
Jesus
Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country
They'll think you're a moron
Just tell me
Color in the red wines comes from the skins
This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color
(not really listening) Sure is tasty
- The Saab heads north
- The boys continue to drink and drive
Did you read the latest draft, by the way
Oh, yeah
Yeah
And
liked it a lot
lot of improvements
It just seemed overall, don't know, tighter, more
congealed or something
How about the new ending
Did you like that
Oh yeah
Much better
There is no new ending
Page 750 on is exactly the same
Well, then  guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different
#1 - Miles is pumping gas
Jack is stretching his legs nearby or perhaps cleaning the windshield
Jack reaches into his pocket
(looking at the phone) It's Christine
(snapping it open) Hey you
( ) You guys having fun
Christine's voice is so loud that Jack has to hold the phone away from his ear
Yeah
All twenty minutes so far have been a blast
(  ) Good
That's good
silence, then -- So what's up
(  ) Just seeing how you're doing
And, um, Mom and  were starting to look over the seating charts again, and we're wondering if you wanted Tony Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, or should he be at one of the singles tables
Jack looks at Miles in a mute appeal for sympathy
(  ) So what do you think
With the Feldmans
Jack hasn't even really heard the question
Yeah
The Feldmans
As the conversation continues, Miles replaces the  , screws the   back on, and together the guys get back into the car
We
(  ) Really
Because  don't know,  was thinking that -- Well, then put him at the singles table
(  ) The problem with that is that then there's one extra -- Then put him with the Feldmans
Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me
(  ) Don't dismiss me
'm trying to include you in this decision
He's your friend
didn't dismiss you
told you what  thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide
Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles
hope you're not going to call every five minutes
(  ) 'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important
Honey, 'm just saying you know need a little space before the wedding
Isn't that the point of this
Isn't that what we talked about with Dr
Gertler
silence
Then -- (  ) Why are you being so defensive
don't know, Christine
Perhaps it's because  feel attacked
(  ) ask you one simple question, and suddenly 'm attacking you
Listen
'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay
(  ) Bye
love you
(  ) Bye
Jack  his cellphone shut, momentarily blinded with rage
Tony Levin
Why did you fucking invite Tony Levin
405  - The Saab heads north -- now passing through
/
- Miles signals and begins to head for an
Whoa, why are we getting off
've just got to make one quick stop
Won't take a second
What
thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother
Your mother
Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago
It's her birthday tomorrow
And don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay
It'll just take a second
She's right off the freeway
101  - The Saab takes an
(
) How old's she going to be
(
) Um
seventy
something
(
) That's a good age
- The Saab rounds a corner and parks in front of a modest
: , ' '  - Approaching the front door, Miles pulls a out of a plastic grocery store bag
Jack carries a bottle of Miles pulls a   out of the bag too
Wait a second
He pulls a  from his pocket and signs it
As he licks the envelope, Jack rings the bell
Moments later  comes to the door
She is a matronly older woman in a nightgown and housecoat
Surprise
Happy Birthday
The boys offer up the flowers and champagne
Phyllis slurs slightly as she speaks -- she's been doing some celebrating of her own
My God
Miles
And Jack
What a surprise
can't remember the last time you brought me flowers
They hug
They're from both of us
famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday
Don't  feel special
famous actor who's getting married next week
Oh, that's right
Isn't that nice hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby
The boys follow her inside
' '  - Jeez, Mrs
Raymond, that was eleven years ago
Well, you were wonderful on that show
never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon
Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin
It's a sin
Yeah, well, you should be my agent
If  was,  would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin
Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man
Look how 'm dressed
've got to run and put my face on
You look fabulous, Mrs
Raymond
(over her shoulder) Oh, stop it
Make yourselves comfortable
(now around the corner) You boys hungry
Yeah, 'm hungry
Jack gives Miles a look
(low) Just a snack
Calm down
Miles leads Jack into this small condo
The  is on, and it's
Amid the newspapers and junk mail and dishes, an - and an ancient  - sit forgotten in a corner
' '  - Miles finishes twisting ice trays into a   as it fills with water in the sink
He puts the champagne in and carries it into the -- ' '   - He takes a seat on the sofa next to Jack, who is watching Let me show you something
The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't -- (concentrated on the ) Just a second
Guy's going for $2500
Miles finishes opening the bottle with an elegant silence
(
) Ready for my close up
The boys turn to see Phyllis now dolled up in thick make-up and a
Her eyebrows are painted and cock-eyed
Overall she looks much worse than before
Oh, champagne
Miles, why don't you bring that out onto the lanai thought we could eat on the lanai
' '  - Miles and Jack are seated in webbed chairs around a circular glass table
They are mid-meal
Everyone is more than a little lubricated, especially the birthday girl as she returns from the kitchen with another plate of food
Mrs
Raymond, this is delicious
Absolutely delicious
(sitting) They're just leftovers
Is it chicken
could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend
Could have made a pork roast
It was a surprise, Mom
And  could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out
You are staying
Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton
They do a magnificent job there
Wendy is so excited you're coming
Silence
Jack freezes, his fork halfway to his mouth
You talked to Wendy
Just now
She's thrilled
And the kids
(trying to be chipper) Yeah, well
You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to
you know, but, uh, yeah
We'll see how it goes
Well, you boys do what you want just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday
Uh-huh
(wiping his mouth) 'll be right back
He gets up and heads into the house
'   - Miles heads toward
'   - and goes directly to her dresser, opening a drawer filled with bras, panties and stockings
He burrows through his mother's lingerie until locating a can of Raid
He twists open the bottom and pulls it apart, revealing it to be a   for valuables disguised as a common household product
Inside are stacks of - (quickly peeling some off) six, seven, eight,
(one more for good luck) Nine
His task complete, he closes the drawer, and as he stuffs the bills in his pocket, his glance falls upon atop the dresser -- --  proud --  poses in front of his childhood San Diego home, showing off a  filled with freshly harvested lettuce
On the wagon is a hand-lettered sign -- "10 cents a bunch
" --  Sears portrait shows the  : a much younger Phyllis, her husband, and their two children -- a 12-year- old Miles and seven-year-old Wendy
-- Miles at his wedding
He and his bride  look young and attractive, their faces radiant and hopeful
'   - Miles enters, flushes the toilet and leaves
' '  - As Miles slides open the door and takes his seat again, Jack is pouring Phyllis another glass
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger
Oh, that was for, uh, wait
That was for Spray and Wash
Spray and Wash
That's the one
Yeah,  remember the girl who was in it with me
She was something
just remember you jogging
So when's the wedding
(irritated) This Saturday, Mom, remember
We told you
And Miles is my best man, Mrs
Raymond
My main man
(another drink of wine) Miles, when are you going to get married again
just got divorced
Phyllis
Two years ago, buddy
You should get back together with Victoria
She was good for you
Embarrassed for his friend, Jack just stares at his food
She was good for you
(turning to Jack) And so beautiful and intelligent
You knew her, right
Oh, yeah
Real well
Still do
'm worried about you, Miles
Do you need some money
'm fine
Miles takes another drink of wine
: , a  -- (
) Jack
Jack
'   - Jack finally awakens with a start and finds Miles standing above him, shaking him
-- As Jack gets up, we see he has crashed on Phyllis's bed adorned with all her decorative
' '   - Still in her pantsuit and smeared makeup, Phyllis lies sprawled and snoring on the sofa
On the , ostensibly never turned off the night before, is an inane
As Miles opens the front door, he spots Jack heading toward the  to turn it off
Miles waves him off
(a loud whisper) She'll wake up
As they leave and Miles closes the front door quietly behind him, we  to the flowers still wrapped and forgotten on a side table
- float in front of two breasts tucked inside a zippered uniform
-- Disheveled and unshaven, Jack and Miles are served breakfast by a young, innocently sexy
Jack leers after her
Fuck, man
Too early in the morning for that, you know what  mean
She's a kid, Jack
don't even look at that stuff anymore
That's your problem, Miles
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place
Speak for yourself
get chicks looking at me all the time
All ages
It's not worth it
You pay too big a price
It's never free
They eat in silence a moment
You need to get laid
Miles shrugs off the comment
It'd be the best thing for you
You know what
'm going to get you laid this week
That's going to be my best man gift to you
'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit
'd rather have a knife
No
No
You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college
Now it's worse -- you're wasting away
Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote
Your books
'm working on it
Miles concentrates on his eggs and hash browns You still seeing that shrink
went on Monday
But  spent most of the time helping him with his computer
Well,  say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax
And Lexapro, yes
Well,  say fuck that
You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need
Jack
This week is not about me
It's about you
'm going to show you a good time
We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style
And get your bone smooched
Jack spots the waitress coming out of the kitchen and motions for more coffee
She nods and smiles, indicating she'll be right over
Jack returns the smile and holds up a hand to signal he'll wait
Jack turns back to see Miles watching him
What
- In a series of shots, the Saab -- now with its   -- makes its way onto the 101 and travels past landmarks that those familiar with the Santa Barbara area might recognize
accompanies this sequence that anchors us into the rhythm of a road trip
/
- The car now descends the Santa Ynez Mountains and heads toward Buellton
Miles and Jack must  to be heard in the open car
You know what
Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first
Whatever's closest, man
need a glass
These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay
One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county
(looking out the window) Look how beautiful this view is
What a day
thought you hated Chardonnay
like all varietals
just don't generally like the way they manipulate Chardonnay in California -- too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation
- - The Saab passes over the 101 and turns onto   road
/
- The boys now pass vineyards of immaculate grapevines
Jesus, what a day
Isn't it gorgeous
And the ocean's just right over that ridge
See, the reason this region's great for Pinot is that the cold air off the Pacific flows in at night through these transverse valleys and cools down the berries
Pinot's a very thin-skinned grape and doesn't like heat or humidity
Jack looks at Miles, admiring his friend's vast learning and articulateness
The Saab now pulls of the road and makes its way down a long gravel
Hey, Miles
really hope your novel sells
Thanks, Jack
So do
(noticing) Here we are
- Miles brings the car to a stop in the parking lot
As they get out and walk -- So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu
told you
Filet and salmon
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon
Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce
Teriyaki
Curry
don't know
Salmon
Don't you always have white wine with fish
Oh, Jesus
Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference
(taking out his phone) Let me call Christine
Doesn't have to be now
Let's go taste
owe her a call anyway
Miles must curb his eagerness to go inside the tasting room as Jack
Hey, honey
So we're up here about to taste some whites, and we need to know how the caterers are going to make the salmon
Jack listens, then grows suddenly impatient
No,  know,  didn't forget, but we wound up at Miles's mom's house, and it got really late, and it was hard to call, so 'm calling you now said  was sorry
Yes,  did
(to Miles) You heard me say  was sorry, right
Miles just shrugs
Miles heard me say  was sorry
As Jack gets more and more involved with the phone call, he wanders off across the parking lot, progressively out of earshot
Give me a break, will you
just called to find out about the salmon -- for our wedding -- to be more involved, like you said -- and all you want to do is get into it about last night and, okay, 'm sorry
'm sorry  didn't call
You're totally right
know, but 'm trying to make this the best wedding  can with the best wine we can find
Don't get any credit for that
Okay
Look, 've got to go
'm out here in the parking lot, and Miles is waiting for me
And so it goes, Jack's voice rising and falling
Miles decides to head inside
- Miles is at the bar,   in front of him
Jack walks in and bellies up next to him
(proudly) Baked with a butter-lime glaze
Now we're talking
, a  in a cowboy hat and ponytail, comes over
This is the condemned man
Here he is
Jack, Chris
Chris, Jack
Chris and Jack shake hands
How you doing
You guys want to start with the Vin Gris
Sounds good
are filled with small amounts of This is rose, right
Good, yeah, it is a rose
Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir
Pinot noir
Not again
(joking, to Chris) You know, not all Pinots are noir
They laugh
Miles swirls his glass in tight circles on the bar, then lifts it to smell
Jack clumsily imitates Miles, perhaps even spilling some wine in the process
Let me show you
We see details of what Miles now describes
First take your glass and examine the wine against the light
You're looking at color and clarity
What color is it supposed to be
Depends on the varietal
Just get a sense of it
Thick
Thin
Watery
Syrupy
Inky
Amber, whatever
Huh
Now tip it
What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim
Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds
This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly
Now stick your nose in it
Jack waves the glass under his nose as if it were a perfume bottle
Don't be shy
Get your nose in there
Jack now buries his nose in the glass
What do you smell
don't know
Wine
Fermented grapes
Miles smells
There's not much there yet, but you can still find
(more sniffs) a little citrus
maybe some strawberry
passion fruit
and there's even a hint of like asparagus
or like a nutty Edam cheese
Jack smells again and begins to brighten
Huh
Maybe a little strawberry
Yeah, strawberry
'm not so sure about the cheese
Now set your glass down and get some air into it
Miles expertly swirls the wine
Jack follows suit
Oxygenating it opens it up, unlocks the aroma and the flavors
Very important
Now we smell again
They do so
Jack smiles
That's what you do with every one
When do we get to drink it
Now
Jack gulps his wine down in one shot
Miles chews his before swallowing
How would you rate this one
Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good
(to Chris) This is the new one, right, Chris
Released it about two months ago
Nice job
We like it
(to Miles) You know, you could work in a wine store
Yeah, that would be a good move
Now Miles notices something about Jack
Are you chewing gum
Want some
,  - The Saab passes through this Danish-themed tourist town
-- ,  - The Saab makes its way into this very average-looking Central coast town right off the freeway
-- - The Saab pulls into the parking lot of this motel
And look -- there's the  itself, its decorative blades motionless
- Miles and Jack enter the room and throw their suitcases onto their respective beds
-- The sounds of a  and -  come from the bathroom while Miles sits impatiently on the bed
He pounds on the wall
Hey Jack, hurry up
(
) Just a minute
Opening the bedside drawer, Miles finds a '  and tosses it in the trash -- apparently his hotel routine
246 - Freshly showered and dressed for dinner, Miles and Jack amble along the shoulder of this busy local two-lane highway
They pass a mall and a car dealership
thought you said it was close
Now 'm all pitted out
It's not even a mile
We should have driven
Not with the wine list these people have
We don't want to hold back
You think 'm making a mistake marrying Christine
Whoa
Come on, do you think 'm doing the right thing
Tell the truth
You've been through it
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason
So  think it's great
It's time
You've got to have your eyes open, that's all
mean, look at me
thought Victoria and were set for life
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business
Showing me the ropes
And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over 'm not Armenian
So 'm thinking about it
But  don't know, might get a little incestuous
But Mike does pretty well
lot of high-end commercial stuff
So you're going to stop acting
No way
This would just provide some stability is what 'm saying
can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along
Uh-huh
We're not getting any younger, right
And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating
Even with my new manager
Maybe it's time to settle down
If that's what feels right
(convincing himself) It does
Feels right
Then it's a good thing
(nodding, feeling better) Yeah
It's good
Feels good
Miles leads them away from the road and across a parking lot
The camera  to reveal -- , a local institution
- Miles and Jack belly up
, the Samoan bartender, spots Miles and extends a welcoming hand
Hey, Miles
Long time no see
Gary
When's that novel of yours coming out
We  all want to read it
Soon, soon
Say, this is my buddy Jack
He's getting married next week
(shaking Jack's hand) My condolences
What are you pouring tonight
Lot of good stuff
(looking at a row of bottles) Got the new Bien Nacido
Want a taste
Absolutement
(to Jack) They have their own label that's just outstanding
Gary pours Jack and Miles a generous sample and the two men swirl, sniff and taste
Jack is beginning to get the hang of things
What do you think
Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration
Nice fruit
Yeah
Tight
(to Gary) Pour us a couple
Gary fills their glasses and corks the bottle
Jack raises his glass to toast
Here's to my last week of freedom
It's going to be great
Here's to us
They clink their glasses and take a drink
We linger on them as Miles retreats inward and a restless Jack scans the room
- Jack and Miles review their menus
Jack looks up and spots a placing an order at the bar
Miles
Check it out
Miles glances at the waitress and returns to his menu
Oh, yeah
That's Maya
You know her
Sure  know Maya
You know that chick
Jack, this is where  eat when come up here
It's practically my office
And sometimes  have a drink with the employees
Maya's great
She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half
She is very hot
And very nice
And very married
Check out the rock
Jack leans forward and squints
Doesn't mean shit
When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her
Think it worked
Fuck no
How do you think met her
This gal's married to  think a Philosophy professor at  Santa Barbara
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing
Obviously that's over
You don't know anything about this woman
Calm down
Let's just eat, okay
(focusing on the menu) The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot
Just then Maya comes by carrying a tray of food on her way to another table
Hey, Miles
Good to see you
Maya, how are you
'm doing good, good
You look great
Did you lose some weight
Oh, no, actually
Busy night
Oh yeah, Sunday night
You guys been out tasting today
You know it
This is my friend Jack
Jack, Maya
(big smile) Hiya
(smiling back) Hi
Well, nice to see you guys here
Bye, Miles
She goes
Jesus, she's jammin'
And she likes you
What else do you know about her
Well, she does know a lot about wine
Ooooooohh
Now we're getting somewhere
And she likes Pinot
Perfect
Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton
How would that ever work
Why do you always focus on the negative
Didn't you see how friendly she was to you
She works for tips
You're blind, dude
Blind
Miles focuses again on the menu

Locally raised
- -- are refilled with the contents of yet another bottle of Hitching Post Pinot Noir
Jack and Miles are enjoying a post-prandial drink
Looks like he's thinking about something
Then -- hate Tony Levin
Jack swirls his wine and downs it in one gulp
Just then -- Walks into the bar and takes a seat a few stools down
She has changed into a black cashmere sweater and corduroys, lovely but tired
(to Gary) Highliner, please
That's on us
Maya looks over and smiles as Gary pours her a glass from their bottle
Hey, guys
Maya gets an American Spirit Yellow out of her purse and lights it while Gary pours her a glass
You want to join us
(polite) Sure
In no hurry, she takes a long sip of her wine, gets up and comes down the bar
So how's that book of yours going, Miles
think you were almost done with it last time we talked
finished it
Good for you
It's getting published
That's what we're up here celebrating
Miles shoots Jack a look
Jack responds with a "don't-fuck- it-up-brother" glower
That's fantastic
Congratulations
She offers her glass, and all clink
(to Jack) Are you a writer too
No, 'm an actor
Oh yeah
What kind of stuff
lot of
was a regular on a couple of series
And lately 've been doing a lot of commercials
National mostly
Anything 'd know
Maybe
Recognize this
Jack takes a deep breath, and out comes a perfect - "Now with low, low 5
8% financing
" Maya's mouth drops open and curves into a big smile
That's hilarious
You sound just like one of those guys
am one of those guys
You are not
He is
Jack launches into another one of his sure-fire hits
(very fast) Consult your doctor before using this product
Side effects may include oily discharge, dizziness, hives, loss of appetite, difficulty breathing and low blood pressure
If you have diabetes or a history of kidney trouble
you're fucked
This makes Maya laugh a big throaty laugh
Jack joins in
Nervous about Jack's aggressive flirtatiousness, Miles musters a tight courtesy smile
(winding down) Oh
needed that
Thank you
They all take a drink of wine
So what are you guys up to tonight
Before Jack has a chance to speak -- We're pretty wiped
Probably go back to the hotel and crash
This makes Maya slightly embarrassed at her apparent availability, but she recovers quickly, remains breezy
Yeah,  know what you mean
It's a long drive up here
Where're you staying
The Windmill
Windmill
Maya downs the rest of her wine, stamps out her smoke, and picks up her jean jacket and purse
Well, good to see you, Miles
Jack
See you
As she leaves -- We'll catch up with you later, okay
But she's gone
Jack gives Miles a slow burn look
We'll probably go back to the hotel and crash
- The guys walk drunkenly along the shoulder as
The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash
Jesus, Miles
Well, 'm tired
Aren't you tired
The chick digs you
She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published
Now 've got another lie to live down
Thanks, Jack
'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on
You were all over her
Somebody had to do the talking
And by the way,  was right
She's not married
How do you know
No rock
When she came to the bar, sans rock
- The screen is absolutely
Single
Waitress
Getting off work
Looking for love
little slap and tickle
Shut up
She probably went home, lit some candles, put on some relaxing music, took a nice hot bath, and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator
Jack begins to make a soft  noise, growing gradually louder and more rhythmic
Have you no shame
Oooh
Oh
Miles
Miles
Fuck you
There's now a rustling noise and footsteps
Then a  is flipped on in the
Miles closes the door behind him, and the only light visible is at the bottom of the bathroom door
Miles  -- a series of semi-forced
Then a as a door opens and the light goes off
Jack starts again
Shut the fuck up
Jack stops and Miles climbs into bed
Silence
Then -- You need to get your prostate checked
-- - Establishing
- Miles and Jack are glancing at the menus
For some reason Jack is humorless and grumpy
So what're we going to have
Pigs in a blanket
The "rancher's special breakfast"
Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard
(not amused) So what's the plan today
We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel
Jack sarcastically taps an index finger to his temple
What's your problem
Jack exhales and looks away, as though he doesn't want to get into it
What is it
Jack sucks his teeth a moment searching for the right words
Then the dam bursts
am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles
And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table
Yes they are
And 'm serious
Do not fuck with me
am going to get laid before  settle down on Saturday
Do you read me
Sure, big guy
Whatever you say
It's your party
'm sorry 'm in the way and dragging you down
Maybe you'd have a better time on your own
You take the car
'll catch the train back
No, see,  want both of us to get crazy
We should both be cutting loose
mean, this is our last chance
This is our week
It should be something we share
The older  comes over
Can  take your order
But  am warning you
Oatmeal, one poached egg, and rye toast
Dry
Okay
And you
(glaring at Miles) Pigs in a blanket
With extra syrup
- The Saab winds along this beautiful road that meanders through large open vineyards
: -- and a   show the boys' route
: -- growing on the vine
: - Framed by foreground grapevines, the Saab passes in the distance
: - Miles has just downed a taste of red wine
How much skin and stem contact
About four weeks
Huh
That explains all the tannins
And how long in oak
About a year
French or American
Both
Good stuff
Yeah, oak
That's a good wood
Just as the pourer turns away toward other , Jack the bottle and helps himself and Miles to another glass
They slam back their drinks like tequila
: - Miles brings the Saab to a stop, and the guys get out
Before them lies an incredible view of endless vineyards
Nice, huh
Beautiful
Victoria and  used to like this view
(lost in nostalgia) Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One
With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care
Miles
She has the best palate of any woman 've ever known
She could even differentiate Italian wines
Miles,  gotta tell you something
Victoria's coming to the wedding
know
You told me
'm okay with it
Yeah, but that's not the whole story
She got remarried
She what
(long pause) When
About a month ago
Six weeks
To that guy
That guy with the restaurant
Jack nods
Miles looks down at his shoes and draws a long breath
Then he stiffly gets back in the open car and closes the door
Miles
Miles continues to stare straight ahead
(exploding) Jesus Christ, Miles
Get out
want to go home now
You've been divorced for two years already
People move on
She has
It's like you enjoy self-pity
Makes you feel special or something
Is she bringing him to the wedding
What do you think
You drop this bombshell on me
Why didn't you tell me before
Because  knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip
But then figured here would be the best place to tell you
We're here to forget about all that shit
We're here to party
(undeterred) 'm going to be a fucking pariah
Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if 'm going to get drunk and make a scene
Plus Tony fucking Levin
No, no, no
It's cool
talked to Victoria
She's cool
Everyone's cool
(horrified) You've all been talking about it
Behind my back
Talking about it
Miles turns and locates an open  of wine in the back seat
He uncorks it and begins to swig
Hey, hey, hey
No, you don't
Jack tries unsuccessfully to grab the bottle from Miles, but Miles bolts out of the car
-- Pursued by Jack, Miles dashes down the hill, all the while taking huge swigs from the bottle
- Miles slows to walk between rows of
He polishes off the bottle and tosses it
painting Jack catches up with him in the adjacent grapevine corridor
Miles's face crumbles as though he were about to cry
Then he collapses to the ground and closes his eyes tight
Jack looks around impatiently for a moment
Then he squats down so he can see Miles underneath the vines
Miles
Miles ignores Jack and focuses on the beautiful that surround him
They seem to distract him from his pain
You going to be okay
Miles looks up and shakes his head a definitive
Jack can't help but
: - The sun hangs low as the Saab pulls into the parking lot, Jack at the wheel
- The pourer, a brunette in her early thirties, breaks away from a   down the bar
This is
Hey, guys
How's it going
Excellent
My friend and  are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah
That's what people say
(slurring slightly) You gotta excuse him
Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir
'm a quick learner
Stephanie laughs
She apparently likes big good-natured lunks like Jack
'm trying to teach my friend here some basics about wine over the next few days before he goes off and -- Under the bar Jack stomps on Miles's foot
Miles winces
Stephanie slides   in front of them
That's right -- 'm here to learn never had that much interest in wine before, but this trip has been very enlightening
Always like wine, of course, but  don't know
More of a beer man, really
Microbreweries
She  the cork off a bottle of Chardonnay
Well, no better way to learn than tasting
She pours almost flirtatious amounts
Now there's a girl who knows how to pour
What's your name
Stephanie
Nice
Jack swirls the wine as though he were by now a sommelier
They look, they smell, they taste
So what do you think
Quaffable but far from transcendent
like it
Tastes great
Oaky
Stephanie reaches for another bottle and pours
Jack's eyes never leave her
Cabernet Franc
(as they taste) This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal
Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc
It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria
And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year
Well, 've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception
Sort of a flabby, overripe -- (ignoring him) Tastes good to me
You live around here, Stephanie
In Santa Ynez
(low, to Miles) And  agree with you about Cab Franc
Oh yeah
We're just over in Buellton
Windmill Inn
Oh yeah
You know a gal named Maya
Works at the Hitching Post
Sure  know Maya
Real well
No shit
We just had a drink with her last night
Miles knows her
Could we move on to the Syrah, please
As she turns to reach for the right bottle, Jack winks at Miles
Miles shakes his head
This is our Estate Syrah
She pours each of them a full
You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie
know
might need to be spanked
She notices the boring couple, visibly annoyed that she has been monopolized
Excuse me
As she wanders down the bar, Jack turns to Miles, his mouth wide open
bad girl, Miles
She might need to be spanked
Do you know how often these pourers get hit on
They glance down the bar at Stepanie
She smiles back
- Miles is killing time by the car staring at his shoes
He looks over and sees Jack waddling over from the tasting room with
Get the trunk
You have the keys
Jack puts the cases down and glances back at the building
We're on
What
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out
With Maya
Been divorced for a year now, bud
Jack puts the wine in the trunk, and they get in the car
Stephanie, holy shit
Chick had it all going on
Well, she is cute
Cute
She's a fucking hottie
And you almost tell her 'm getting married
What's the matter with you
(drumming on the steering wheel) Gotta love it
Gotta love it
- -- on
sit transfixed, each on his own bed
The curtains are drawn
Then out of nowhere -- (mocking) You know how often these pourers get hit on
(getting up) 'm going for a swim
Get the blood flowing
Want to come
Nah
want to watch this
-- guy gets ready to putt
The announcer whispers what an important moment this is
The guy misses
-- The sound of an
Miles
Hey, Miles
Time to get up
-- Jack spraying his feet with some Dr
Scholl's product
-- Miles pulls himself out of bed and slouches toward his suitcase
Fucking chick in the Jacuzzi -- goddamn, Miles, fucking going nuts up here
Whole place is wide open
Assylvania
Jack does some actor's weird warm-up stretch
So what should  wear
don't know
Casual but nice
They think you're a writer
As Miles begins to dig through his suitcase, Jack flips open his cellphone and speed-dials
Don't you have any other shoes
Miles glances as his shoes sitting sadly on the floor
(into the phone) Hello
Oh hey, baby, just checking in
Not much
We're about to go out for dinner, probably be out pretty late, so  thought 'd say goodnight now
know,  love you too
miss you
- The boys get out of the car and walk along a timbered sidewalk in this tourist town with wine tasting rooms and gourmet restaurants
Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay
Like who you were before the tailspin
Do you remember that guy
People love that guy
And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall
Oh yeah
How exciting
What's it called
Do not sabotage me
If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call
But do not sabotage me
Aye-aye, captain
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot
(dead serious) If anyone orders Merlot, 'm leaving
am not drinking any fucking Merlot
Okay, okay
Relax, Miles, Jesus
No Merlot
Did you bring your Xanax
Miles takes a   from his pocket and rattles it
And don't drink too much
don't want you going to the dark side or passing out
Do you hear me
No going to the dark side
Okay
Fuck
Miles quickly
Jack gives him a final look in the eye
We're going in
- The boys enter this cozy if crowded restaurant and exchange words with the
Then they notice -- at a booth waving at them
They look great
make their way to the table, Jack wearing a broad, confident -- Jack plops down next to Stephanie, while Miles politely eases in on Maya's side
Jack touches a hand to Stephanie's bare neck and massages it meaningfully
How you doin' tonight, beautiful
Good
How're you
Great
You look great
(including Maya) You both do
Not so bad yourself
Meanwhile Miles looks over at Maya and purses his lips in an affable if uncomfortable smile
Then -- What are you drinking
Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc
Oh yeah
How is it
(sliding the glass) Try it
As Miles swirls the wine and takes a sip, he begins to relax
Nice
Very nice
Twelve months in oak
On a Sauvignon Blanc
know the winemaker
She comes in the restaurant all the time
This is good
Little hints of clove
know
love that
-- finishes listing off the specials
medallions of pork with a dusting of black truffles served with a root vegetable foulon and wasabi-whipped potatoes
And finally a Copper River salmon grilled on an alder wood plank
And that comes with roasted new potatoes and steamed watercress
The four diners exchange looks of delight
And who gets the wine list
Miles raises his hand and takes the leather-bound book
(teasing) guess Miles wants it
Jack glares at Miles, who immediately gets the hint
Nope
You ladies choose
Jack smiles and nods his approval
Jack takes the book out of Miles's hands and offers it to the girls
You choose, Stephanie
(opening it) So what does everyone feel like
Whatever you girls want
It's on us tonight
Sky's the limit
No, we're paying for the wine
don't think so
We're celebrating Miles's book deal
Well, in that case
Miles draws a long breath
What's everyone ordering
Then we can sort out the wine
Exactement
Jack shoots Miles a look
'm having the salmon
That's what 'm having
(still scanning the wines) 'm thinking about the duck breast
(slapping his menu shut) Me too
Well, that narrows things down
Stephanie lowers the menu so that only her eyes peer over the top
She looks at the others, and they look back at her
Sounds like
Pinot Noir to me
Jack looks at Miles and raises one hand for a -

(  ) Hello
Victoria
(  ) Miles
Miles feigns an implausible upbeat tone
Victoria
How the hell are you
(  ) Fine
What's, uh, what's on your mind
Heard you got remarried
Congratulations
Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round
(  ) Oh, Miles
You're drunk
Just some local Pinot, you know, then a little Burgundy
That old Cotes de Beaune
Miles laughs at his own non-existent joke
(  ) Where are you
little place in Los Olivos
New owners
Cozy ambiance
Excellent food too -- you should try it
Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night
Silence
(' ) Hello
(  ) Miles, don't call me when you're drunk
just wanted you to know 've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more
You won't see me there
My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name
What is his name
(  ) (silence, then --) Ken
Ken
(  ) Miles,  don't care if you come to the wedding or not
Well, 'm not coming, Barbie
So you guys have fun
(  ) 'm going to hang up now, Miles
(rushing to keep her on) You see, Vicki,  just heard about this today, you getting married that is, and  was kind of taken aback
Kind of hard to believe
Silence
guess  just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and  just,  just -- (  ) Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding
Miles sucks something from between his two front teeth
Whatever you say, Vicki
You're the boss
He   as nonchalantly as if it had been a sales call and heads back to the table
- For a flash, Miles is walking an unstable, narrow extending vertiginously across a great
- Miles reaches the table, tries to sit and Although at first Jack blinks heavily in disgust, the girls burst into hysterical
Jack then laughs too, perhaps -
Easy, boy
Easy
Maya helps him back into the booth
Are you all right
Fine
Just slipped
(picking up his glass) This is my blood
Miles drinks
Stephanie makes a head gesture to Maya, who nods in return
(to the guys) Excuse us
Sorry to make you get up again, Miles
That's okay
Miles and Jack allow the girls to pass
Then -- What the fuck, man
What is up
Miles reaches for his wine glass, but Jack moves it away
Pull yourself together, man
'm fine
But in throwing open his arms for emphasis, he spills a Jack rights it and throws a napkin on the tablecloth
Where were you
Bathroom
Did you drink and dial
Miles's silence confirms his guilt and shame
Why do you always do this
Victoria's gone, man
Gone
Poof
Miles looks down and squeezes his eyes tight while pushing out an exhale through his nose
Stop it
You are blowing a great opportunity here, Miles
Fucking Maya, man
She's great
She's cool
She's funny
She knows wine
What is this morose come-down bullshit
These girls want to party
And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays
mean, come on
Let's just say 'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario
Oh Jesus, Miles
Miles belligerently reaches for his Comte Armand
Jack lets it pass
And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria
How small she make you feel
That's why you had the affair in the first place
Shut up
Shut your face
Don't you see how Maya's looking at you
You got her on the hook
Reel her in
Come on, let's rachet this up a notch
You know how to to do it
Here
(passing a glass) Drink some agua
Miles looks at the water, takes it and drains it
The girls now return to the table
The guys slide over
(trying to appear sober) Should we get dessert
We were thinking
Why don't we go back to my place
've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever
Jack raises both arms like a football referee
Excellent idea
Waiter
- -- Trees and bushes lit by the headlights show us we're headed into the woods
-- Jack drives
Miles blinks heavily as he tries to make a sense of  -
(grabbing the map) Let me see that
'  - The Saab pulls into a gravel  and comes to a stop outside this wood-framed cottage
Jack and Miles get out and head for the front door
On the way, Jack reaches into his coat pocket and produces a string of

Miles wordlessly takes his

Jack knocks twice on the before going in

We're here
Stephanie sails in
What happened to you guys
Couple of wrong turns
(pointing a thumb at Miles) Thanks to Magellan, here
After a brief hug, Stephanie and Jack peck-kiss
Hi
Hi
(to Miles) Maya's in the kitchen
Miles hesitates a moment before Jack elbows him toward -- '  - Miles wanders in to find Maya squatting in front of a little temperature-controlled
Hi
Hey
She got anything good
Oh, yeah
Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs
(calling out) Hey, Steph
You sure we can open anything
Anything we want
(
) Anything but the Jayer Richebourg
She has a Richebourg
Mon dieu have completely underestimated Stephanie
Who do you think you're dealing with here
Maya slips out a bottle of
How about this
Miles nods vigorously
Maya looks back and forth between Miles and the wine, her eyes narrowed
Then she slides it back in
Nope
don't think we know each other well enough
(picking out another bottle) 'd say this guy's more our speed
They rise, and Miles glances at the    and, raising his eyebrows, agrees
Maya begins opening it
So what gems do you have in your collection
Not much of a collection really haven't had the wallet for that, so sort of live bottle to bottle
But 've got a couple things 'm saving
guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc
You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's just sitting there
Go get it
(pushing him, playfully stern) Right now
Hurry up
Miles laughs, fights back a bit
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they
At least that's what 've read
Yeah,  know
It might be too late already
What are you waiting for
don't know
Special occasion
With the right person
It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary
Understanding, Maya considers her response
The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion
How long have you been into wine
started to get serious about seven years ago
What was the bottle that did it
Eighty-eight Sassicaia
Miles whistles and raises his eyebrows
Maya pours, and they clink their glasses together before savoring the wine
Wow
We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty
Really good
How about you
(tastes again) think they overdid it a bit
Too much alcohol
Overwhelms the fruit
(tasting again, impressed) Yeah, 'd say you're right on the money
Then Miles absently scans the   and spots a of Stephanie holding a
Is this Stephanie's kid
Sure is cute
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie
Is she sleeping or
She's with her grandmother
She's with Steph's mom
She spends a lot of time over there
Steph's
well, she's Stephanie
Jack's voice-over voice from the other room
(
) "And now for a low, low 4
8%
" is followed by
You got kids
Who me
Nah, 'd just fuck them up
That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids
Yeah, same here
Maya nods as she sips again, looking distant for a moment, thinking about something else
Let's go in there
Maya takes the bottle, and they wander into -- '   - Jack and Stephanie are gone
From a distant bedroom comes more laughter
Looks like our friends are hitting it off
While Maya goes to turn down the , Miles sits on the couch
Maya's shirt rides up as she crouches, giving Miles a glimpse of the small of
She takes a seat opposite Miles on the couch
They look at each other without speaking
Just what is the vibe here
It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house
All those times you came into the restaurant
It's like you're a real person now
Almost
Yeah,  know
It's kind of weird
Out of context
Yeah, weird
But great
Yeah
Definitely
An awkward silence, broken by Maya
So what's your novel about
Well, it's a little difficult to summarize
It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke
Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely
What's the title
"The Day After Yesterday
" Oh
You mean
today
Um
yeah but it's more
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or
Mrnmm, yeah
but not really
It shifts around a lot
Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father
And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution
Wow
Anyway,  think it's amazing you're getting it published
Really
know how hard it is
Just to write it even
(squeezing it out) Yeah
Thanks
Like me,  have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual 'm freaked out about it
Just like in high school
It never changes
paper
Yeah
'm working on a masters in horticulture
Chipping away at it
Horticulture
Wow
didn't know there was a college here
commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week
So
you want to work for a winery or something someday
Well
do have a copy of the manuscript in the car
It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos
Oh yeah
Who cares
'm the queen of typos
(sipping the wine) Wow, this is really starting to open up
What do you think
My palate's kind of shot, but from what  can tell, 'd dub it pretty damn good
Can  ask you a personal question
(bracing himself) Sure
Why are you so into Pinot
It's like a thing with you
Miles laughs at first, then smiles wistfully at the question
He searches for the answer in his glass and begins slowly
don't know
It's a hard grape to grow
As you know
It's thin-skinned, temperamental, ripens early
It's not a survivor like Cabernet that can grow anywhere and thrive even when neglected
Pinot needs constant care and attention and in fact can only grow in specific little tucked- away corners of the world
And only the most patient and nurturing growers can do it really, can tap into Pinot's most fragile, delicate qualities
Only when someone has taken the time to truly understand its potential can Pinot be coaxed into its fullest expression
And when that happens, its flavors are the most haunting and brilliant and subtle and thrilling and ancient on the planet
Maya has found this answer revealing and moving
mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason
By comparison
How about you
What about me
don't know
Why are you into wine
suppose  got really into wine originally through my ex-husband
He had a big, kind of show-off cellar
But then  found out that  have a really sharp palate, and the more drank, the more  liked what it made me think about
Yeah
Like what
Like what a fraud he was
Miles laughs
No, but  do like to think about the life of wine, how it's a living thing
like to think about what was going on the year the grapes were growing, how the sun was shining that summer or if it rained
what the weather was like
think about all those people who tended and picked the grapes, and if it's an old wine, how many of them must be dead by now love how wine continues to evolve, how every time  open a bottle it's going to taste different than if had opened it on any other day
Because a bottle of wine is actually alive -- it's constantly evolving and gaining complexity
That is, until it peaks -- like your '61 -- and begins its steady, inevitable decline
And it tastes so fucking good
Now it is Miles's turn to be swept away
Maya's face tells us the moment is right, but Miles remains frozen
He needs another sign, and Maya is bold enough to offer it: reaches out and places one hand atop his
(pointing) Bathroom over there
Yeah
Miles gets up and walks out
Maya sighs and gets and American Spirit out of her purse
'  - The bathroom's a  -- the shower curtain is filthy, and the chipped and water-stained tub is filled with ' Miles is bent over the sink splashing water on his face, trying to sober up and gather his courage
He stands, and without drying his face, presses his palms against his cheeks
Then he takes a deep breath and drops his hands
You are such a loser
Come on
- Miles comes out of the bathroom and looks for Maya, but she's not there
Then he hears a noise from the kitchen, so he goes through the door into -- '  - Maya is at the sink, filling a glass with water
was just getting some water
You want some water
Miles goes to stand by her and accepts a glass of water
Just as she's about to fill a second glass, he stops her and looks her in the eye, trying to recapture a moment that is long gone
He kisses her and she kisses back, but the whole thing feels strained and awkward
After a few seconds, Maya breaks away
Nice
But instead of resuming the kiss, she steps past him, heading back into the living room
(
) should probably get going
Miles realizes he's blown it and silently berates himself
- Miles drives down the hill behind Maya's car, which leads him through this very rural road
- Maya's car comes to a stop just ahead of the Saab
She puts it in  and gets out
-- Miles rolls down his window as Maya leans over
You know how to get back to the Windmill, right
Got it
had a good time tonight, Miles really did
Good
So did
Okay
See you around
Um
did you still want to read my novel
Oh, yeah
Sure
Of course
Miles turns to the backseat, locates a large  , and hands it to Maya
Wow
Great
He turns around again, produces a  , and hands it over as well
Hope you like it
Feel free to stop reading at any time
'll take no offense
Goodnight, Miles
She gives him a friendly peck on the cheek
After she gets back in her car, she heads in one direction while Miles heads in the opposite
-- Jack's cellphone
- -- Still fully clothed, Miles staggers across the room
Fishing the phone out of Jack's windbreaker pocket, he looks at the  : "Erganian, Christine" and the number
He briefly considers his options -- answer it
shut it off
-- before placing it atop Jack's suitcase
The moment he lies back down on the bed, the An old   next to it reads 7:l0
As Miles closes his eyes and pulls the pillow over his aching head, we again -- -- Outside a roaring  comes to a stop
Then over the sound of an   come familiar if indistinct and
Miles opens his bleary eyes and listens
pound on the balcony outside, and Jack lets himself in, flushed and exuberant
Fucking chick is unbelievable
Un-be- lieve-able
He pounds on the wall, then goes into the bathroom and without closing the door unzips his pants to
Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty
Nasty nasty nasty
Well, 'm glad you got it out of your system
Congratulations
Mission accomplished
hungover Miles gets up and looks out the door Jack has left open
Down in the parking lot he sees -- atop a mid-sized , wearing a weathered fringed suede jacket
She gives him a big friendly wave
returns the wave and goes back inside
You didn't invite Stephanie to come with us, did you
With a  Jack emerges from the bathroom and opens his bag
Oh, hey, change of plans
Steph's off today, so she and  are going on a hike
We were supposed to play golf
You go
In fact, use my clubs
They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad
(slapping some cash on the dresser) It's on me
Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all -- (sitting down) Count me out
Oooh,  see
Didn't go so good last night, huh
That's a shocker
You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood
You dumb fuck
Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude
Miles looks down
Jack heads for the door
Later
Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first
Jack stops, eyeing Miles suspiciously
Miles tosses Jack his phone
Jack flips it open and scrolls down with his thumb
He doesn't like what he sees
Oh, boy
(pointing at the room phone) She's been leaving messages here too
Yeah
Okay
He  the phone shut and puts it back
You should call her
will
(heading out the door) See ya
Right now
Okay
Jesus
Jack picks up his phone, sits on the bed and looks defiantly at Miles
've got no problem calling her
Now Jack closes his eyes and brings the heel of his hand to his forehead as he begins to concoct the
(opening his phone) Wait outside, will you
- Miles wanders out and looks down at Stephanie
That was fun last night
Yeah
Good food
You've got quite a wine collection
Very impressive
Thanks
Hey,  talked to Maya this morning
She said she had a good time too
You should call her
Miles says nothing
Where's Jack
He had to make a phone call
Stephanie cuts her bike's engine and climbs off, propping it up on the kickstand
So what are you up to today, Miles
Just kickin' back,  guess
don't know
Jack and  were supposed to go golfing
Huh
Yeah,  reserved the tee time about a month ago
Oops
Sorry
You golf
Me
No,  think it's kind of a stupid game
mean, at least,  could never get into it
tried it once
Huh
Jack loves golf
Crazy about it
Just then Jack cracks open the motel room door
(hushed) Hey Miles
Miles
Miles ducks back inside
- Do you have that other condom
Miles reaches into his wallet and hands over the little foil square
What'd Christine say
Lucked out -- got voice mail
Everything's cool
- Jack bounds out of the room and down the stairs like a child on Christmas morning
Miles watches Jack climb on the bike behind Stephanie, grasping her waist
Stephanie and Jack  , leaving Miles alone on the balcony
-- As we begin to hear a  sound which carries us to -- - Miles sits outside carefully trimming his toenails
, ,
for this mournful montage of solitude
- Miles takes a styrofoam cup and helps himself to a cup of complimentary  from a
Then he takes a look at the rack of pamphlets of local -- a water park, a mystery cave, and of course winery after winery
- Amid turbulent water, Miles corrects his students' papers
He is alone in the tub, but at the nearby pool play noisily with -
'  -- The  he's reading is marked up with circled spelling errors, and one entire paragraph has been crossed out
Finding a new error, Miles writes "

- Miles , his lips pulled back into a grotesque moue
Then he brushes with a -
-- Miles checks his machine
(
) No new messages
He hangs up, disgusted
- small Buellton eatery
- The only customer right now, Miles eats awkwardly with his chopsticks
- Miles  ball after ball, unsuccessfully trying to release his frustration
- The Saab roars past us, perhaps going a little too fast
- Whistling absently as he drives, Miles leans over to turn the radio on and fiddle around to find a good station
Then all of a sudden -- The car has struck something with a hideous sound followed immediately by the receding "---" of an injured  in the Saab's wake
Miles applies the
- Miles gets out of his car just in time to see -- scampering into the nearby woods
Miles looks around -- has anyone seen him
Is there a nearby residence
Finding nothing, Miles momentarily weighs his options before finally He follows the path of the dog into -- - Still hearing occasional distant barking, Miles finds his way among the trees and bushes, looking in vain for the ill- fated cur
After a frenetic search, Miles reluctantly gives up and heads back
- Miles has returned to where he hit the dog
Just then, Miles notices    watching him from just down the road
They disappear into the bushes
Looking like a criminal, Miles trots back to the Saab climbs behind the wheel and speeds away
- The Saab pulls into the parking lot
/
- Miles trudges up the stops to the room
He opens the door and sees -- atop Stephanie, plowing her fertile fields
Despite the interruption, their pace does not alter
Not now
Not now
Miles quickly shuts the door
- Miles pours himself another glass of Pinot
Jack comes in and spots his morose friend
Hey, there you are
Yep
What're you drinking
Jack reaches over to check out the bottle's label
Miles remains cool to Jack's amiability
Any good
Miles shrugs
(to the bartender) Could  get a glass please
(to Miles) Stephanie took me out into the Pinot fields today
It was awesome
think finally got a handle on the whole process, from the soil to the vine to the -- what do you call it
-- selection and harvest
And the whole, you know, big containers where they mix it
We even ate Pinot grapes right off the vine
(the new expert) Still a little sour but already showing potential for great structure
Stephanie really knows her shit, Miles
Jack now has his glass and pours himself some wine
Where is Stephanie
Upstairs
Getting cleaned up
What the fuck are you doing
What
With this chick
Jack just looks at him
Does she know about Saturday
Um
not exactly
But 've been honest
haven't told her 'm available
And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days
Besides
Jack stops short in a rare instance of self-censorship
Besides what
Well
don't know, just
the wedding
What
Well, 've been doing some thinking
Oh, you've been thinking
And
may have to put the wedding on hold is all
Miles looks at him with incredulity
fully realize that making a change like that might be tricky for certain people to accept at first, but life is short, Miles
've got to be sure 'm doing the right thing before taking such a big step
And not just for my sake
'm thinking about Christine's feelings too
take marriage very seriously -- always have
That's why 've never done it before
The day  get married, it's going to be the real thing
Miles just looks at his friend, waiting for more
Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes
She's not uptight or controlling
She's just cool
Things are so easy with her
Smells different
Tastes different
Fucks different
Fucks like an animal
'm telling you,  went deep last night, Miles
Deep
Deep
Miles draws a long sigh
Don't get all judgmental on me
This is my deal
It's my life, and it's my call
They fall silent for a moment
Then -- was hoping to get some understanding from you
And 'm not getting it
Understanding of what
Like  might be in love with another woman
In love
Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love
And give up everything
Look who's talking
You've been there
Yes  have, and do  look like a happy man
Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do
Huh
Was it
Is she a part of my life now
This is totally different
'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about
That's the distinction have not made the commitment yet am not married
have not said the words
In a few days,  might get married, and if  do, then  won't be doing stuff like this anymore
Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married
And what about Stephanie
She's a woman -- with a kid
single mom
What do you think she's looking for
Huh
(interrupting) Here's what 'm thinking
We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard
You design your own wine; 'll handle the business side
Then you get inspired and write a new novel
As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, ' two hours away
Not even
You're crazy
You've gone crazy
What do you care anyway
You don't even like Christine
What
Of course  like Christine
You said she was shallow
Yeah, and a nouveau riche
That was three years ago after that first party
Look, Miles, all  know is 'm an actor
All  have is my instinct
(his hand on his chest) My intuition -- that's all  have
And you're asking me to go against it
And that's just wrong
Just then Stephanie walks in
She cozies up to Jack, and he kisses the top of her head
Hi, guys
We should probably get going
Where
- as a crazy car races through the obstacle-ridden track, often leaving the road, much like Jack's libido
to reveal six-year-old  seated in Jack's lap as they drive together
delighted Siena laughs and giggles
Miles sits nearby with Stephanie and her fifty-something, two-pack-a-day
Stephanie's heard this a thousand times, but if 'd done what  wanted and 'd bought up in Santa Maria when  had the chance,  would have made a fortune when they put in that outlet center and that Home Depot
(a drag off her cigarette, then to Stephanie) Your father knew it too, but he was a fucking chickenshit
Always was
Caryl looks over her shoulder, her gaze drawn to Jack and Siena, so completely happy together
Caryl exhales a puff of smoke as she watches
Stephanie is equally enthralled
Miles takes it all in, trying his best not to shake his head in disgust
- Caryl is behind the wheel of her  as Stephanie gets Siena buckled up in the backseat
Jack pulls Miles aside
Listen, 'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay
(dispirited) Sure, whatever
Maybe 'll catch a movie
Stephanie kisses Miles's cheek before getting in the car next to her mom
See you, Miles
You take care
Bye, Stephanie
Bye, Siena, Caryl
Bye, Miles
As he gets in the car -- Call me on my cell if you go out
Yeah
Miles watches them drive away, then heads toward his Saab
- - -- as Miles places a box of security , a packet of and some
-- Miles points over the '
And could  get a Barely Leqal
As the cashier reaches for the magazine -- , um, the new one
- Miles is once again
- Miles opens a bottle of Pinot and pours himself a glass
He carries it to bed, takes a nice big slug, lies down on the bed and opens his magazine
--      -- The Barely Legal face down on his chest, Miles awakens with a start and looks at the clock-radio
He thinks a moment, takes a deep breath, and bounds off the bed
-   -- as little needles of water come at us
-- Miles takes a nice hot
But wait -- he has forgotten to put the shower curtain inside the tub
closer look reveals a growing    on the floor
- Miles walks across the parking lot
He pauses before entering, then forces himself to take the leap
- Miles affects nonchalance as he searches briefly for Maya
He continues on into the
How's it hanging, Miles
You know me
love it up here
How about you
Busy night for a Tuesday
We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour
Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on
Full moon or something
What can  get you
Highliner
Glass or bottle
(considers, then --) Bottle
You got it
Say, is Maya working
Maya
Haven't seen her
think she's off tonight
Say, where's your buddy
Miles just smiles
-- Gary serves Miles, alone at the bar
Miles takes his first drink
Oh, that's tasty
- It's closing time
The front door flies open, and Miles staggers out sideways
Gary follows him out, concerned
You okay, Miles
'm good
Miles heads in the wrong direction at first, then realizes his mistake and steers himself back toward the Windmill
,   -- - The door bursts open, and Jack comes bounding in
Come on, dude
Let's go golfing got us in at Alisal
Miles comes to, very hungover
That's a public course
(then --) No Stephanie
She's working
need a break anyway
She's getting a little clingy
(magnanimous) This is our day
- Jack   with a manly athletic swing and shades his eyes to watch the ball's trajectory
Crap
Miles, disheveled and sullen, approaches the teebox, sticks a tee in the ground and sets his ball
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday
Nope
She likes you, man
Stephanie'll tell you
(preparing to swing) Can you give me some room here
(stepping back) Oh yeah
Sure
Miles lifts his club
You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot
Thanks, Jack
Miles refocuses and  just as Jack offers more helpful advice
Don't whiff it
Despite the distraction, Miles manages to make a good, long drive
Nice shot
You're an asshole
-- Jack is pouring two Dixie cups of wine as Miles prepares to take his next swing
What about your agent
Hear anything yet
Nope
What do you think's going on
Could be anything
Been checking your messages
Obsessively
Huh
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response
guess 'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life
But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say
Miles says nothing
Or fuck those New York publishers
Publish it yourself
'll chip in
Just get it out there, get it reviewed, get it in libraries
Let the public decide
Giving Jack a look that says Jack has no idea what he's talking about, Miles takes a stance over the ball and focuses
Don't come over the top
Stay still
Shut up
Just trying to be helpful
(a moment later) It's all about stillness, Miles
Inner quiet
Miles drops his club and turns to Jack
Shut up
Shut up
Shut up
What's the matter with you, man
Why are you so hostile
know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile
(holding out a cup of wine) Here
Still fuming, Miles begrudgingly accepts the wine and has a taste
He's immediately distracted from his woes
What is it
don't know
Got it from Stephanie
Miles downs the rest and is intrigued by the taste
Huh
Let me see the label
Suddenly a golfball  against the hard fairway directly behind them
(whirling around) What the fuck
Way back on the tee box, some 200 yards away, are a of two couples
One of the  is waving his driver
#1 (shouting, barely audible) Hurry it up, will you
Jack looks at Miles, the two incredulous
Fucker hit into us
(yelling) Hey, asshole
That's not cool
Throw me his ball
Jack walks over, picks up the offending ball and tosses it to Miles
Miles gets out his 3-wood and --
-- cuts it back low and hard
Nice shot
duck for cover as the ball whistles over their heads
laugh hard
climb in their  and hasten down the fairway toward Jack and Miles
watches their approach, grinning
Oh, this is going to be fun
(jerking a driver from his bag) This is going to be fun
Jack heads in their direction, brandishing the club like a medieval knight with a mace
As the husbands get a look at this sight, they turn their cart around and speed back toward their wives
Hit into us again, motherfuckers, and 'll ass-rape all four of you
- Jack and Miles are turning in their cart and hoisting their clubs over their shoulders
Just don't give up on Maya
Cool smart chicks like that --they like persistence
don't want to talk about it
All  know is she's beautiful
Lots of soul
Perfect for you
'm not going to feel good about this trip until you guys hook up
Don't you just want to feel that cozy little box grip down on your Johnson
Nearby a  is with his
Hey, you mind keeping it down, buddy
- Miles and Jack walk toward their car
Is it the money thing
Is what the money thing
With Maya
Well, yeah, that's part of it
Woman finds out how  live, that 'm not a published author, that 'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick
If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game
You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir
Is an abattoir like a
like a
what is that
Slaughterhouse
Abattoir
Huh
But you are going to get the good news this week about your book
know you are
can feel it
Jack's  rings, and he checks the caller
It's Steph
(picking up) Hey, baby
Yeah
Oh yeah
Yesssss mean  would, but let me see
Hey, Miles
Oh fuck it, we're going
We'll be right there
Me too
He snaps his phone shut and turns to Miles
We're on
What's happening
We're going to have some fun
Remember fun
We're going to have some of it
Okay
What exactly are we going to do
said okay
You have to tell me -- Miles finally smiles
Okay
: - -- The Saab pulls up where Stephanie and Maya await with bottles of wine and a
The girls climb into the back seat, and the car speeds away
/
- They're going , hair whipping around
Hey, Miles,  heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me
Oh, yeah
No
mean yeah,  stopped by for a drink
Didn't see you
had class
Well, nice to see you now
You too
- That car's going a little too
/ The two couples wander around this historic site
- The girls have led them to a beautiful spot
-- we see the progress of their picnic
We don't hear them, but there is a growing intimacy about their interaction
Even Maya and Miles seem to be overcoming residual awkwardness from the other night
Jack and Stephanie lean on each other as they eat and sip wine
Finally, the two couples are  against the

The foursome join others headed toward the main building
#3 - by British wine sage   is in progress
He holds aloft a    containing one of the few but growing number of local reds worthy of his attention
-- As our foursome listen attentively, Jack leans over to Miles
You ever actually read any of this guy's books
He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and  used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting
Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys
Fucker never retracted
Huh
Stephanie leans forward and signals to Maya with a  or a that they hightail it
Although Miles protests at first, they stand and leave

They are shy with each other, on the verge of kissing but holding back

Suddenly they explode in sleepy Siena appears at the hallway door rubbing her eyes
Stephanie gets up, but Jack stops her, gathers Siena in his arms, and takes her back to bed
'  - The Saab pulls away from the house
- Miles sits in his own passenger seat as Maya tries her hand at the Saab
'   - Maya leads Miles up her back stairway
They're both a little woozy from the hours of drinking
-- Maya searches through her purse for her keys while Miles hovers directly behind her, staring at her ear
Her ear
Just as Maya puts the key in the lock, he impulsively leans forward to kiss the nape of her neck
Maya's reaction is immediate -- she turns to embrace Miles, giving him a long Then she opens the door, pulls him inside and closes the door in our face

You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today
Great
What's the latest we can get there
About two-thirty
Okay
(noticing) Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night
It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, 'd be into it
Why don't you stay through the weekend
Miles has just figured out a difficult clue
As he writes it down -- No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner
What rehearsal dinner
Miles stops writing
Who's getting married
/
- Maya leads the way toward the Saab
Were you ever going to say anything
Of course  was
mean, just now could have made up some story, but didn't
told you the truth
Maya turns to confront Miles with a look of "Give me a break
" Miles reaches out to touch her
Maya
(jerking away) Don't touch me
Just take me home
- Miles drives, glancing occasionally at Maya, who stares straight ahead
've told him
've told him over and over, but he's out of control
Do you know what he's been saying to her
He's an actor, so it can't be good
Oh, just that he loves her
That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world
How he adores Siena
How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to
'm sure he believed every word

Please believe me
was even on the verge of telling you last night, but
But you wanted to fuck me first
Oh, Maya
No
Yeah
'   - Miles brings the car to a stop
Maya opens the door and begins to get out
You know,  just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception
And 've been doing just fine
And  haven't been with anyone since my divorce
This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night
really like you, Maya
And 'm not Jack
'm just his
his freshman roommate from San Diego State
Maya wants to let Miles's words reach her, but she can't just yet
Could  have my paper, please
Unsure what she wants at first, Miles reaches into the back seat for the New York Times
He hands it to her and watches until she goes inside
- Miles pulls up and parks
- As Miles enters, a shirtless Jack drops the Barely Legal and is immediately upon him, grabbing him in a big
The is on, perhaps showing an
True Hollywood Story
Yo
Yo
Here's my boy
Here's my boy
Who's your daddy, boy
Who is yo' daddy
Put me down, Jack
Jack continues his paean to Miles's triumphant night
said put me down
Jack
Still gripping Miles in a bearhug, Jack flings the both of them onto the bed
Now on top of Miles, Jack  both cheeks
'm so proud of you
Let me love you
Now they get up off the bed
So tell me everything
Details like details
No
What
It's private
You're kidding, right
Tell me what happened, you fucker, or 'll tie your dick in a knot
Let's leave it alone
Jack looks at Miles, his face frozen with incomprehension
You didn't get any, did you
(off Miles's silence) You're a homo
Just stop, okay
Make something up, and that's what happened
Whatever you want
Write my confession, and 'll sign it
Just stop pushing me all the time
can't take it
You're an infant
This is all a big party for you, but not for me
This is serious
And you -- Just
leave me alone, okay
You're fucking me up
Wow
Okay
Calm down
Sorry
Miles begins to calm down
Jack grows concerned and sensitively puts one arm around his friend
Did you have trouble performing
Yeah, that's
Shut up
Shut up, Jack
The phone  and both men look at it, silenced by the ominous sound
Don't answer it
But Jack is drawn to it as though enticed by a strange game of Russian roulette
'm telling you, don't
Jack picks up the receiver and puts it to his ear
Hello
Oh, hey, honey
How you doing
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
(mouthing) Christine
Miles lies on his bed and clamps both hands over his ears
His face is dark with resentment
Listen, honey
Let me call you back
Miles and  are in the middle of something
No, it's nothing serious -- Miles is just having one of his freak- outs
Yeah
Love you too
'll call you right back
Jack hangs up
This whole week has gone sour
It isn't turning out like it was supposed to
(deadly serious) want to go home
Who's being selfish now
'm the one getting married
thought this week was supposed to be about me
We gotta slow down
(closing his eyes) 'm so tired
Let's just get out of here
know what you need
- Jack watches Miles be fitted for ties Miles's laces
There you go
Miles gets up and walks in a circle
Do you like them
Yeah, they're great
Sporty
They're really sporty
Are they too sporty
- The boys exit Sears, Miles wearing his new shoes and carrying a   with a string handle
Feel better
Miles shrugs
(noticing something) Oh here, wait a second
want to run in here real quick
He heads toward a

Mildly concerned, Miles watches Jack go into the store

Jack slows down, preparing to turn in
How about this one
We didn't hit this one
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon
It's a joke
You ever actually been in there, Miles
don't have to
(turning the wheel) say we check it out
You never know
- The Saab finds a place in the large parking lot
, whose flank reads "Solvang Wine Tours," is in the process of letting out  , many of them elderly
- The room boasts not only a large   but also display after display of t-shirts, golf shirts, olive oils, chocolate sauces and other gourmet tourist items emblazoned with the winery's logo
In the corner an   with a small amp plays soothing Windham Hill-ish music
The tasting bar is packed three-deep with  attended to by
Finally the  gets to their glasses
Miles chews a sip and swallows, then downs the rest in a single gulp
Tastes like the back of a fucking schoolbus
Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit
Fucking Raid
don't know
Tastes okay to me
(looking at the tasting sheet) Hey, they got a reserve pinot
Let me use your phone
(handing it over) What's up
can't take it anymore
've got to call Evelyn
- Walking across the lawn outside, Miles holds the cellphone to his ear
(  ) Evelyn Berman-Silverman's office
Hi, it's Miles
(  ) Oh, hi, Miles
Let me see if  can get her
(a moment later) You're in luck
'll put you through
(  ) Miles
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client
(  ) How's the trip
Good, good
Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know
So what's happening
Still no word
(  ) Actually there is word
spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning
And
(  ) And
they're passing
Conundrum's passing
He said they really liked it
They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it
He said it was a tough call
Huh
(  ) 'm sorry, Miles
(off his silence) So  don't know where that leaves us
'm not sure how much more mileage can get out of continuing to submit it
think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home
The whole industry's gotten gutless
It's not about the quality of the books
It's about the marketing
Miles is at a loss for words
distant  begins to sound, the familiar harbinger of an anxiety attack
- Once again we see the narrow   extending vertiginously across a great
- (  ) Are you there
Miles
Yeah, 'm here
(  ) 'm sorry, Miles
We did all we could
You've been a real trooper
(loudly, to her assistant) Tell him 'll call back
So  guess that's it
(  ) You're a wonderful writer, Miles
Don't be discouraged
-- Miles  toward the tasting room, unpocketing his Xanax and downing a couple, as Evelyn's cliches of consolation continue in his head
(  ) Just hang in there, and who knows
After you get something else published, we can revisit this one
And next time we can try a different title
Once back at the tent, he leans against it in a vain attempt to steady himself
The  grows deafening
- Now inside, Miles grabs the first    he finds and shakes it out as he approaches the closest tasting station
He pushes his way to front
The pourer offers the usual one-ounce dollop
Miles jacks it back, immediately extending his glass for more
Hit me again
The same small amount is poured and downed
Once again Miles holds out his glass
Pour me a full glass
'll pay for it
This is a tasting, sir
Not a bar
Miles slams a -  on the table
Just give me a full goddamn pour
The pourer turns away to serve another party
Miles looks around indignantly, as though everyone should be sympathetic to this injustice
Now Miles boldly reaches over and pours himself a glass right up to the brim and beyond
Sir, what are you doing
told you  need a drink
Then buy a bottle and go outside
The pourer grabs Miles by the wrist before he can drink
Put the glass down
In the ensuing struggle, the wine spills, and everyone nearby steps back
You're going to have to leave, sir
The pourer signals to a   at the door
Across the room Jack notices the disturbance and heads over
Miles hoists up the  , holds it aloft and starts to  it
Wine cascades down the sides of his face, onto his shirt and even onto his shiny new shoes
The Security Guy yanks the bucket away from Miles, and drags him toward the
Jack catches up
(to the horrified onlookers) It's all right
His mother just died
- Two  soar low over the water
One of the , crashing into the water and disappearing from view
Jack and Miles sit on the hood of the Saab, gazing at the ocean, sharing a bottle of wine
Just write another one
You have lots of ideas, right
No, 'm finished
'm not a writer
'm a middle-school English teacher
'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others
It's okay
like books
The world doesn't give a shit what  have to say
'm unnecessary
(a dark laugh) 'm so insignificant,  can't even kill myself
What's that supposed to mean
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz
You can't kill yourself before you've even been published
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces
He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is
Thanks
Don't give up
You're going to make it
Half my life is over, and  have nothing to show for it
'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper
'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage
See
Right there
Just what you just said
That's beautiful
thumbprint on a skyscraper
couldn't write that
Neither could
think it's Bukowski
Unable to respond, Jack looks up and down the beach
- There goes the Saab
The  lingers behind and  to reveal   , now covered with
- Jack and Miles pull into the parking lot
(lighting up) Oh, look
There's Steph
He smiles broadly and honks his horn
Miles turns to see -- seated halfway up on the motel stairs, her  in her lap, watching patiently as -- pulls to a stop in a parking space
Miles masks his concern as he gets out of the car and reaches in the backseat for his Sears bag
(calling out) Hey, baby
Stephanie stands up and slowly descends the steps, as Jack reaches into the trunk and pulls out a
Look what  got for our favorite girl
Stephanie walks toward Jack as he waddles toward her hugging the lion
When they get close, Stephanie's face transforms with rage
She swings her helmet and
Jack falls, blood spraying out of his nose
Stephanie stands over him and continues to   with her helmet as he rolls back and forth, protecting his head with the stuffed lion
Miles ineffectually attempts to stop her, dancing just out of range
Stephanie
Stop
You fucking bastard
Lying piece of shit
You're getting married on Saturday
What was all that shit you said to me
can explain
You said you loved me
You fuck hope you die
With that she backs away
Glancing at her bloodied helmet, she tosses it onto the pavement before getting on her bike
Fuckface
(to Miles) You too
As she speeds away, Miles is left to comfort his wounded friend
The lion lies nearby, staring blankly at the sky
/
- Seated in the passenger seat and in great agony, Jack presses a -  against his face
Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her
Don't need a lecture
You fucking told Maya, didn't you
No,  did not
Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post
think we mentioned it to him the first night
You told him
'm fucking hurting here
Keep it elevated
- open to an article titled "24 Ways To Please Your Man
" -- Miles reads, while nearby a   dry-heaves into a garbage can held by his
An   parked in a wheelchair faces the wall
-- Miles is at a
As he speaks he tries to peel off the metal
(  ) Hi
It's Maya
Please leave a message
It's Miles
Listen,  don't know if you even care, but  had to call and tell you again how much  enjoyed our time together and how sorry  am things turned out the way they did
think you're great, Maya -- always have
From the first time you waited on me
(bracing himself) And while 'm at it,  guess you should know that my book is not getting published
thought this one had a chance, but  was wrong
Again
Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do
So you see 'm not much of a writer
'm not anything really
The only real talent  seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand
We're leaving in the morning, and  want you to know that  take with me wonderful memories of you
'm sorry
'm really sorry
What else to say
He hangs up
He returns to his seat
moment later he extends his legs to look at his new  now
-- Jack emerges unsteadily from the bowels of the emergency room, his face purple and swollen beneath the that holds the  in place
Miles walks with him toward the exit
Well
'm going to need an operation
Maybe a couple of them
They have to wait for it it to heal first
Then they break it again
Good thing you have a voice-over career
Gonna fuck that up too
should sue her ass
Only reason  won't is to protect Christine
That's thoughtful
(disgusted) Yeah
They walk by us and out the door
- Jack sits in the Saab's passenger side with the seat almost fully reclined
When his agony allows him to open his eyes, he glares at the    lining the street
An plies his lofty trade in a nearby window
He hears a strange   and turns his head to see a     walking noisily down the street, dressed in a    and carrying a
Jack takes a slug of wine
Just then Miles gets back in the car
hate this place
Miles tears open a paper bag and removes a bottle of pills
closer angle reveals them as
Take a couple of these, and you'll learn to love it
Miles opens the bottle and hands Jack two
Two for you
And two for me
Jack washes down the pills and passes the bottle to Miles, who follows suit
- Jack and Miles sit across from each other
For the first time we see    on Jack's arms and chest
So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday
We didn't get into that with Gary
Huh
Let me think
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya
Sure 'm sure
And just what are you implying
'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth
What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you
You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal
Not by a longshot
Jack takes a long lie-detecting look at Miles
don't know
Just seems fishy
- The boys lie on their respective beds staring at the
Jack gets up and lumbers slowly to the dresser  like a large dog who has just been neutered
What's it look like to you
Looks like you were in a bad car accident
Jack turns to Miles, nodding and thinking
Then he looks back in the mirror
'm hungry
- Establishing
Thursday night is Cajun Wings Night
- Miles and Jack are finishing their  in the rustic- themed restaurant festooned with animal trophies
You know what 'm thinking
What's that
'm thinking it's time to settle down
One woman
One house
You know
It's time
Uh-huh
Jack nods his head with no self-awareness or acknowledgment of the irony
mounded high with ribs, slaw, beans and butter-whipped mashed potatoes
Mm
Mm
Their cheery, saftig blonde  removes several from her apron and places them on the table
And here're your Handi-wipes
Oh, so that's what those are
For a second there  thought you guys were promoting safe sex
The waitress - and swipes a hand at her naughty customer
'll be right back with more corn bread
Jack watches her go and leans in close to Miles
bet you that chick is two tons of fun
You know, the grateful type
don't know
wouldn't know
Now she comes back toward the table carrying a
Beneath the hideous uniform, her nylons -- as she walks
When she arrives, she replenishes their corn bread basket using big
Jack watches attentively
Nice technique there
(checking her name tag) Cammi
It's all in the wrist
(a moment later) You know, you look really familiar
You from around here
Where'd you go to high school
No, we're from San Diego
Why
don't know
You just seem really familiar to me
Never mind
Enjoy your meals
Hang on
Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby
Doctor Derek Sommersby
You mean from "One Life to Live"
Miles looks away and sighs
You have to imagine him with a bandage and shorter hair
As Cammi stares at Jack, her face transforms in astonishment
No
Way
No way
Jack smiles and nods
Oh, my God
Could you tell me where the bathroom is
(her eyes barely leaving Jack) Uh, sure, it's right over there, right past the buffalo
-- Miles gets up and heads toward the bathroom as Jack's flirtation with Cammi continues
The camera  with Miles as he walks by us and goes through the bathroom door, which closes behind him, filling the frame with the word "
" -- as a finger tips it forward to dispense one
-- Miles stands by the cash register and    as he watches Jack finish speaking with Cammi and head his way
She gets off in an hour, so  think 'm just going to have a drink and then
make sure she gets home safe
You're joking, right
(seeing that he isn't) What are you doing
Un-fucking- believeable
Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home
Jack rests one hand on Miles's shoulder and drops his head, thinking how best to put it
Look, Miles
know you're my friend and you care about me
And  know you disapprove
respect that
But there are some things  have to do that you don't understand
You understand wine and literature and movies, but you don't understand my plight
And that's okay
-- as the disappointment in his friend deepens by the moment
: ,  -- Now comes the sound of hysterical
- Despite the knocking, Miles remains motionless in bed, his expression serene
Finally he awakens and drags himself toward the door, opening it to find -- silhouetted against the first rosy fingers of dawn
He is barefoot
In fact he is clad only in his
Hugging himself, he  and
Jesus fucking Christ, it's freezing
He limps past Miles, yanks off the bed covers and wraps them around himself
Vicodin
Where's the Vicodin
My nose
Miles hands him the bottle, and Jack frantically pops a couple of pills, chewing them like candy
He sits down and bends over at the waist as though preparing for an airplane crash
Fucking chick's married
What
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and 'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass
Jesus, Jack
Jesus
And you walked all the way back from Solvang
Ran
Twisted my ankle too
That's five clicks, Jackson
Fucking-a it's five clicks
At one point  had to cut through an ostrich farm
Fuckers are mean
Miles has now awakened to take in the absurdity of the whole scene, and he
The blanketed bulge just sits there
Finally it looks up and shows its pitiful visage
We gotta go back
What
left my wallet
My credit cards, cash, fucking , everything
We gotta go back
Big deal
We'll call right now and cancel your cards
You don't understand
The wedding bands
The wedding bands are in my wallet
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere
Some bar
Christine'll understand
No
She ordered them special
Took her forever to find them
They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit
We've got to go back
Christine'll fucking crucify me
No way
No way
(a pitiful whine) Please, Miles, please
Forget it
Your wallet was stolen at a bar
Happens every day
Jack stares straight ahead, breathing through his mouth as he considers this
Then -- No, we've got to get my wallet
Those rings are irreplaceable
We've got to get them, Miles
fucked up know  fucked up, okay
fucked up
You gotta help me
You gotta help me
Pleeeease
Jack now descends to a level of wretchedness and desperation that Miles has never seen before in Jack, or in anyone else for that matter
Oh, God, please
Oh God
know 'm bad
know  did a bad thing
Help me, Miles
Just this one thing, this one last thing
can't lose Christine
can't
'm nothing without her
Please, Miles, please
uuuuu
uuuuuu
uuuuuuu
No longer able to form words, Jack is reduced to emitting low, primitive sounds
Snot flows from beneath his bandaged nose
/
- Miles drives in the early-morning light
Jack is now subdued, quieted by his pain and exhaustion
She tell you she was married
Yeah
So what the fuck were you thinking
Wasn't supposed to be back till six
Fucker rolls in at five
Cutting it a little close, don't you think
(off Jack's silence) So how was she
Compared to Stephanie, say
Horny as shit
Flopping around like a landed trout
-  - The Saab creeps around a corner
/
- Jack scans the street
Yeah, this is the block
Just keep going
(spotting an  Pacer) Yeah
This is it
There's her car
Miles pulls over and cuts the engine
So what's the plan
The plan is
you go
Me
My ankle
Just go explain the situation
(sarcastic, clearing his throat) Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering
Yeah, yeah
Like that
Just like that
Miles gives Jack a withering look
Jack reaches for the Fuck you
'll get it myself
(grabbing Jack's shirt) Hold on
'  - Miles crosses the street and approaches -- '  - Miles presses his ear against the front door
Nothing
Then he notices -- a few feet away, just barely cracked open
creeps over, sticks his hand into the open space and pulls back the curtain to reveal -- the is hideously
Draped over a deformed beanbag chair are ' '
Miles gathers his courage, carefully slides open the glass door, and creeps inside
'  - furtive search of Jack's pockets reveals
Then Miles notices a -  wafting from an open door down a short
Miles feverishly begins foraging through the debris on the floor
Again nothing
Meanwhile the noise from the bedroom grows louder -- female  in odd rhythmic unison with a '
-- Miles gets on   and starts crawling, weaving his way through a trail of shoes and clothes
Nearing the open door, the sounds grow more distinct -- You don't think  fuck you, bitch
'll fuck you
'm a bad girl
'm a bad girl
Miles peers around the corner of the open door to see -- '  - Cammi is  to the faux brass headboard
slams away at her
In the corner a soundless  shows a You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch
picked him up and  fucked him
'm a bad girl
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore
liked it when you caught me fucking him
Whoa
Miles manages to tear his eyes away from this nature documentary and scan the room
-- to the  atop the dresser
Miles's eyes dart back and forth between the couple and the wallet
His   , he goes for it
He scrambles to his feet, dashes across the room, seizes the wallet and tears out
Behind him he hears -- (
) The fuck was that
(
) The wallet
He took Derek's wallet
'  - Miles comes flying out of the sliding glass door, followed swiftly by the man, who is of course
And he's fast for a man his size
(
) Get him
- Jack is reclined in the passenger seat
On the radio '   reads the news
'  -- Miles comes sprinting towards us, mere steps ahead of Cammi's naked husband
Finding the car door locked, Miles knocks loudly on the glass, startling Jack awake
Open up
Jesus
Open the goddamn door
Jack flips the electric locks just in time for Miles to get in before -- The guy's  hits the window
He pounds on the roof before trying the door, now re-locked
You motherfuckers
'll kill you
'll kill you motherfuckers
Miles starts the car and begins to drive away
The guy tries to keep up but can't, running barefoot on asphalt
Jack turns to look -- -- The guy recedes in the distance
removes the rings from the wallet
You did it
You fucking did it
They  and
-- For all his failures, this time he did something right
- The shades are drawn
Jack is   on the bed, snoring loudly
Miles folds his shirts and trousers -- readying his bags for departure
At one moment he stops and watches his friend sleep
at the door
Miles goes to answer it, but once his hand is on the knob, he pauses
If we're perceptive, we will know he's hoping against hope that it's Maya
He opens it
It's just the  with her big
Housekeeping
101  - The Saab enters the freeway and heads south
/
- Miles drives while Jack stares out the window, as they leave wine country
Hey, Jack
Jack
Hrnrnrn
That was quite a day yesterday
Jack's eyes close, but his lips spread into a smile
Yep
Quite a day
Quite a week
101  - driving shot
- Miles pumps the gas, while nearby Jack stretches his legs
As Miles puts the nozzle back in place -- Want me to drive
No, 'm okay
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding
Somehow  don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move
In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again
You're so negative
Miles replaces the hose and screws on the gas cap
Come on, let me drive
'm fine
You rest
feel like driving
- As the car makes its way back toward the freeway, Jack looks over at Miles and slows the car to a stop
What's wrong
Nothing
Buckle up, okay
Miles obeys
Without hesitation, Jack accelerates and , heading into -- - The Saab plows
- What the fuck
(pointing at his face) You said it looked like a car accident
What the fuck
'll pay for it
- They get out to inspect the damage
The hood is slightly crumpled, and the front fender is bent
Look at this
don't know
Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one
Oh, no
Oh, Christ
No, you don't
You need a new car anyway
Miles looks at his friend, incredulous
said 'd pay for it
-- The trunk is open, and the guys are unloading their cases of wine
Miles notices that one box is
You broke some
Whatever
Sorry
No, not whatever
You fucking derelict

You ready
Miles waves his hand in a gesture of "Get it over with
" Grunting with effort, Jack leans inside the car and drops the foundation block onto the
Direct hit
Jack leaps backward and hits the dirt just in time
Miles and Jack watch the driverless Saab race toward the tree, its speed increasing
But just before hitting it, the car drifts to one side and
Oh, fuck
The car zooms wildly across the vacant lot and, missing the tree, continues on until     and finally toppling headlong into a
Only the back of the car remains visible
The whole thing is finished in a matter of seconds
Still frozen in place, Miles and Jack turn slowly to each other

He plops the last case down
Well
That about does it
Why don't you come in
Uh-uh
You're on your own
So 'll see you at the rehearsal
Yeah
They give each other a brief manly back-slappy hug
Love you, man
Back at you
Miles heads toward the curb
Hey, don't pull away till they see the car
(over his shoulder) Yeah
(turning around) Hey, why wasn't  injured
(big smile) You were wearing your belt

Erganian opens the front door and welcomes Jack with shock and dismay

The camera slowly as he continues to watch -- -- weaving his story of woe
He's a great actor when he wants to be

Then -- (
) Hey, Miles
Miles turns and looks up to see Victoria, standing one step above him
Just behind her is her
He exudes the quiet confidence of a successful businessman who played college football, takes expensive skiing and sailing vacations, and hasn't read a novel since high school
Hi, Vicki
(taking her in) You look beautiful
Thanks
Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband
From his spot hovering over Miles, Ken leans down and offers his hand
How are you
Hi
How you doing
You're a lucky guy
Thanks
(to Victoria) 'll wait for you at the car
(to Miles) Nice to meet you, Miles
Ken
Exit Ken
That was big of him
Yeah, he's good that way
Very considerate
That's great
So how're you doing
Since the last time we spoke
don't know
Could be better
Could be worse
So what's happening with your book
Universally rejected
Strike three
Oh, Miles
That's awful
What are you going to do
Back to the drawing board,  guess
Or not
So
you're married
Congratulations
You look happy

Seems like everyone's getting married

Now it's all weddings

Just then a    pulls up alongside the curb
The passenger side window is halfway down, and the sounds of Adult Contemporary Jazz waft out
Victoria gives Ken a little wave

Toast all the newlyweds
Not me
'm not drinking
You quit drinking
'm pregnant
(hit in the solar plexus) Oh
Huh
Well

That's wonderful news

Yeah

He washes down a bite by draining the contents of a big wax-coated soft drink cup
He brings the cup to his lap and refills it from a hidden next to him
As he sets the bottle back down, we glimpse the label: 1961 Cheval Blanc
He takes another sip
As the camera  , all the complex emotions inspired by the wine ripple across Miles's face

Raymond

On his way to the kitchen, he presses a button on his As it plays, he opens the and looks inside
One new message
' Hello, Miles
It's Maya
Miles , not wanting to miss a single syllable
' Thanks for your letter
would have called you sooner, but  think 've needed some time to think about everything that happened and what you wrote to me
Another reason didn't call sooner is that  wanted to finish your book, which  finally did last night
Miles's heart pounds
' think it's really lovely, Miles
You're so good with words
Who cares if it's not getting published
There are so many beautiful and painful things about it
Did you really go through all that
It must have been awfully hard
And the sister character -- Jesus, what a wreck
But  have to say  was really confused by the ending
Did the father finally commit suicide, or what
It's driving me crazy
