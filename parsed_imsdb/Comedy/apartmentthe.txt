Diamond by Billy Wilder and
Diamond man's hand is punching out a series of figures on the keyboard
(
) On November first, 1959, the population of New York City was 8,042,783
if you laid all these people end to end, figuring an average height of five feet six and a half inches, they would reach from Times Square to the outskirts of Karachi, Pakistan
know facts like this because  work for an insurance company -- -  , It's a big mother, covering a square block in lower Manhattan, all glass and aluminum, jutting into the leaden sky
(
) -- Consolidated Life of New York
We are one of the top five companies in the country -- last year we wrote nine-point-three billion dollars worth of policies
Our home office has 31,259 employees -- which is more than the entire population of Natchez, Mississippi, of Gallup, New Mexico
Acres of gray steel desk, gray steel filing cabinets, and steel-gray faces under indirect light
One wall is lined with glass-enclosed cubicles for the supervisory personnel
It is all very neat, antiseptic, impersonal
The only human tough is supplied by a bank of  machines, clacking away cheerfully in the background
(
) work on the nineteenth floor -- Ordinary Policy Department - Premium Accounting Division - Section  -- desk number 861
861 Like every other desk, it has a small name plate attached to the side
This one reads
(
) My name is
Baxter -
for Calvin,
for Clifford -- however, most people call me Bud
've been with Consolidated Life for three years and ten months
started in the branch office in Cincinnati, then transferred to New York
My take-home pay is $94
70 a week, and there are the usual fringe benefits
is about thirty, serious, hard-working, unobtrusive
He wears a Brooks Brothers type suit, which he bought somewhere on Seventh Avenue, upstairs
There is a stack of perforated premium cards in front of him, and he is totaling them on the computing machine
He looks off
It shows 5:19
With a click, the minute hand jumps to 5:20, and a piercing bell goes off
(
) The hours in our department are 8:50 to 5:20 -- - Instantly all work stops
Papers are being put away, typewriters and computing machines are covered, and everybody starts clearing out
Within ten seconds, the place is empty -- except for Bud Baxter, still bent over his work, marooned in a sea of abandoned desks
(
) -- they're staggered by floors, so that sixteen elevators can handle the 31,259 employees without a serious traffic jam
As for myself,  very often stay on at the office and work for an extra hour or two -- especially when the weather is bad
It's not that 'm overly ambitious -- it's just a way of killing time, until it's all right for me to go home
You see,  have this little problem with my apartment -- : - Bud, wearing a weather-beaten Ivy League raincoat and a narrow-brimmed brown hat, comes walking slowly down the street skirting the puddles on the sidewalk
He stops in front of a converted brownstone, looks up
(
) live in the West Sixties - just half a block from Central Park
My rent is $84 a month
It used to be eighty until last July when Mrs
Lieberman, the landlady, put in a second-hand air conditioning unit
The windows on the second floor are lit, but the shades are drawn
From inside drifts the sound of cha cha music
(
) It's a real nice apartment - nothing fancy -- but kind of cozy -- just right for a bachelor
The only problem is -  can't always get in when  want to
- What used to be the upstairs parlor of a one-family house in the early 1900's has been chopped up into living room, bedroom, bathroom and kitchen
The wallpaper is faded, the carpets are threadbare, and the upholstered furniture could stand shampooing
There are lots of books, a record player, stacks of records, a television set (21 inches and 24 payments), unframed prints from the Museum of Modern Art (Picasso, Braque, Klee) tacked up on the walls
Only one lamp is lit, for mood, and a cha cha record is spinning around on the phonograph
On the coffee table in front of the couch are a couple of cocktail glasses, a pitcher with some martini dregs, an almost empty bottle of vodka, a soup bowl with a few melting ice cubes at the bottom, some potato chips, an ashtray filled with cigar stubs and lipstick-stained cigarette butts, and a woman's handbag
, a dapper, middle-aged man, stands in front of the mirror above the fake fireplace, buttoning up his vest
He does not notice that the buttons are out of alignment
(calling off) Come on, Sylvia
It's getting late
, a first baseman of a dame, redheaded and saftig, comes cha cha-ing into the room, trying to fasten a necklace as she hums along with the music
She dances amorously up to Kirkeby
Cut it out, Sylvia
We got to get out of here
He helps her with the necklace, then turns off the phonograph
What's the panic
'm going to have another martooni
She crosses to the coffee table, starts to pour the remnants of the vodka into the pitcher
Please, Sylvia
It's a quarter to nine
(dropping slivers of ice into the pitcher) First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush
Makes a person feel cheap
Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but  promised the guy 'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively
(pouring martini) What guy
Whose apartment is this, anyway
(exasperated) What's the difference
Some schnook that works in the office
- Bud is pacing back and forth, throwing an occasional glance at the lit windows of his apartment
middle-aged woman with a dog on a leash approaches along the sidewalk
She is
, the dog is a Scottie, and they are both wearing raincoats
Seeing them, Bud leans casually against the stoop
Good evening, Mr
Baxter
Good evening, Mrs
Lieberman
Some weather we're having
Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral
(she is half-way up the steps) You locked out of your apartment
No, no
Just waiting for a friend
Good night, Mrs
Lieberman
Good night, Mr
Baxter
She and the Scottie disappear into the house
Bud resumes pacing, his eyes on the apartment windows
Suddenly he stops -- the lights have gone out
- Kirkeby, in coat and hat, stands in the open doorway of the darkened apartment
Come on -- come on, Sylvia
Sylvia comes cha cha-ing out, wearing an imitation Persian lamb coat, her hat askew on her head, bag, gloves, and an umbrella in her hand
Some setup you got here
real, honest-to-goodness love nest
Sssssh
He locks the door, slips the key under the doormat
(still cha cha-ing) You're one button off, Mr
Kirkeby
She points to his exposed vest
Kirkeby looks down, sees that the buttons are out of line
He starts to rebutton them as they move down the narrow, dimly-lit stairs
You got to watch those things
Wives are getting smarter all the time
Take Mr
Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar -- Don't you ever stop talking
- Bud, standing on the sidewalk, sees the front door start to open
He moves quickly into the areaway, almost bumping into the ashcans, stands in the shadow of the stoop with his back turned discreetly toward Kirkeby and Sylvia as they come down the steps
Where do you live
told you -- with my mother
Where does she live
hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx
All right -- 'll take you to the subway
Like hell you will
You'll buy me a cab
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx
You mean you bring other girls up here
Certainly not
'm a happily married man
They move down the street
Bud appears from the areaway, glances after them, then mounts the steps, goes through the front door
- There are eight mailboxes
Bud opens his, takes out a magazine in a paper wrapper and a few letters, proceeds up the staircase
- Bud, glancing through his mail, comes up to the door of his apartment
As he bends down to lift the doormat, the door of the rear apartment opens and
, a jovial well-fed middle-aged woman, puts out a receptacle full of old papers and empty cans
Bud looks around from his bent position
Oh
Hello there, Mrs
Dreyfuss
Something the matter
seem to have dropped my key
(faking a little search) Oh -- here it is
He slides it out from under the mat, straightens up
Such a racket  heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars
Oh, you don't have to worry about that -- nothing in there that anybody would want to steal
(unlocking door quickly) Good night, Mrs
Dreyfuss
He ducks into the apartment
- Bud snaps on the lights, drops the mail and the key on a small table, looks around with distaste at the mess his visitors have left behind
He sniffs the stale air, crosses to the window, pulls up the shade, opens it wide
Now he takes off his hat and raincoat, gathers up the remains of the cocktail party from the coffee table
Loaded down with glasses, pitcher, empty vodka bottle, ice bowl and potato chips, he starts toward the kitchen
The doorbell rings
Bud stops, undecided what to do with the stuff in his hands, then crosses to the hall door, barely manages to get it open
Mr
Kirkeby barges in past him
The little lady forgot her galoshes
He scours the room for the missing galoshes
Mr
Kirkeby,  don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight
know, Buddy-boy,  know
But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus
don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and  haven't had any dinner yet -- Sure, sure
Look, kid --  put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel
(perking up) Mr
Sheldrake
That's right
We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise -- (finds the galoshes behind a chair) -- and  told him what a bright boy you were
They're always on the lookout for young executives
Thank you, Mr
Kirkeby
(starting toward door) You're on your way up, Buddy-boy
And you're practically out of liquor
know
Mr
Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here -- Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it
Yes, Mr
Kirkeby
You still owe me for the last two bottles -- 'll pay you on Friday
(in the open doorwaY) And whatever happened to those little cheese crackers you used to have around
He exits, shutting the door
(making a mental note) Cheese crackers
He carries his load into the kitchen
The kitchen is minute and cluttered
On the drainboard are an empty vermouth bottle, some ice-cube trays, a jar with one olive in it, and a crumpled potato-chip bag
Bud comes in, dumps his load on the drainboard, opens the old-fashioned refrigerator
He takes out a frozen chicken dinner, turns the oven on, lights it with a match, rips the protective paper off the aluminum tray and shoves it in
Now he starts to clean up the mess on the drainboard
He rinses the cocktail glasses, is about to empty the martini pitcher into the sink, thinks better of it
He pours the contents into a glass, plops the lone olive out of the jar, scoops up the last handful of potato chips, toasts an imaginary companion, and drinks up
Then he pulls a wastebasket from under the sink
It is brimful of liquor bottles, and Bud adds the empty vodka and vermouth bottles and the olive jar
Picking up the heavy receptacle, he carries it through the living room toward the hall door
- The door of Bud's apartment opens, and Bud comes out with the wastebasket full of empty bottles
Just then, , whose wife we met earlier, comes trudging up the stairs
He is a tall, heavy-set man of fifty, with a bushy mustache, wearing a bulky overcoat and carrying an aged medical bag
Good evening, Baxter
Hi, Doc
Had a late call
Yeah
Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick
Oh
(sets down wastebasket) 'Bye, Doc
(indicating bottles) Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys
Oh, that's not me
It's just that once in a while,  have some people in for a drink
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around
From what hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night
'm sorry if it gets noisy -- Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header
(shaking his head) nebbish like you
(uncomfortable) Yeah
Well -- see you, Doc
(starts to back through door) You know, Baxter -- 'm doing some research at the Columbia Medical Center -- and  wonder if you could do us a favor
Me
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University
My body
'm afraid you guys would be disappointed
Good night, Doc
Slow down, kid
He starts into the rear apartment as Bud closes the door
- Bud, loosening his tie, goes into the kitchen, opens the oven, turns off the gas
He takes a coke out of the refrigerator, uncaps it, gets a knife and fork from a drawer, and using his handkerchief as a potholder, pulls the hot aluminum tray out of the oven
He carries everything out into the living room
In the living room, Bud sets his dinner down on the coffee table, settles himself on the couch
He rears up as something stabs him, reaches under his buttocks, pulls out a hairpin
He drops it into an ashtray, tackles his dinner
Without even looking, he reaches over to the end table and presses the remote  station-selector
He takes a sip from the coke bottle, his eyes on the  screen across the room
The picture on the  set jells quickly
Against a background of crisscrossing searchlights, a pompous announcer is making his spiel
-- from the world's greatest library of film classics, we proudly present -- (fanfare) Greta Garbo -- John Barrymore -- Joan Crawford -- Wallace Beery -- and Lionel Barrymore in -- (fanfare) There is an extended fanfare
Bud leans forward, chewing excitedly on a chicken leg
But first, a word from our sponsor
If you smoke the modern way, don't be fooled by phony filter claims -- Bud, still eating, automatically reaches for the station- selector, pushes the button
new channel pops on
It features a Western -- Cockamamie Indians are attacking a stagecoach
That's not for Bud
He switches to another station
In a frontier saloon, Gower Street cowboys are dismantling the furniture and each other
Bud wearily changes channels
But he can't get away from Westerns -- on this station, the
Cavalry is riding to the rescue
Will they get there in time
Bud doesn't wait to find out
He switches channels again, and is back where he started
On the screen, once more, is the announcer standing in front of the crisscrossing searchlights
And now, Grand Hotel -- starring Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, Joan Crawford -- (Bud is all eyes and ears again) -- Wallace Beery, and Lionel Barrymore
But first -- a word from our alternate sponsor
(unctuously) Friends, do you have wobbly dentures --
That does it
Bud turns the set off in disgust
The  screen blacks out, except for a small pinpoint of light in the center, which gradually fades away
In the bathroom, Bud, in pajamas by now, is brushing his teeth
From the shower rod hang three pairs of socks on stretchers
Bud takes a vial from the medicine shelf, shakes out a sleeping pill, washes it down with a glass of water
He turns the light off, walks into the bedroom
In the bedroom, the single bed is made, and the lamp on the night table is on
Bud plugs in the electric blanket, turns the dial on
Then he climbs into bed, props up the pillow behind him
From the night table, he picks up the magazine that arrived in the mail, slides it out of the wrapper, opens it
It's the new issue of
Bud leafs through it till he comes to the piece de resistance of the magazine
He unfolds the overleaf, glances at it casually, refolds it, then turns to the back of the magazine and starts to read
What he is so avidly interested in is the men's fashion section
There is a layout titled with a sub-head reading The Bowler is Back
Illustrating the article are several photographs of male models wearing various styles of bowlers
Bud is definitely in the market for a bowler, but somehow his mind starts wandering
He turns back to the overleaf again, unfolds it, studies it, then holds the magazine up vertically to get a different perspective on the subject
By now the sleeping pill is beginning to take effect, and he yawns
He drops the magazine on the floor, kills the light, settles down to sleep
The room is dark except for the glow from the dial of the electric blanket
Three seconds
Then the phone jangles shrilly in the living room
Bud stumbles groggily out of bed, and putting on his slippers, makes his way into the living room
He switches on the light, picks up the phone
Hello
-- Hello
-- yes, this is Baxter
- On the night is a hearty man of about forty-five, nothing gut personality, most of it obnoxious
His name is
Outside the booth is a blonde babe, slightly boozed, and beyond there is a suggestion of the packed, smoky joint
Hiya, Buddy-boy
'm in this bar on Sixty-first Street -- and  got to thinking about you -- and figured 'd give you a little buzz
- Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration
- (snapping to attention) Oh, yes, Mr
Dobisch
didn't recognize your voice -- That's okay, Buddy-boy
Now like was saying, 'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and  think  got lucky -- (glances toward blonde) -- she's a skater with the Ice Show -- (he chuckles) -- and  thought maybe  could bring her up for a quiet drink
- 'm sorry, Mr
Dobisch
You know like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time
Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice
Listen, kid,  can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe
- don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- 'm already in bed -- and 've taken a sleeping pill -- so 'm afraid the answer is no
(pulling rank) Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and 'm putting you in the top ten
Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you
- Of course not
But -- how can  be efficient in the office if  don't get enough sleep at night
It's only eleven -- and  just want the place for forty-five minutes
The blonde opens the door of the phone booth, leans in
'm getting lonely
Who are you talking to, anyway
My mother
That's sweet
That's real sweet
Dobisch shuts the door in her face
(into phone again) Make it thirty minutes
What do you say, Bud
- (a last stand) 'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing
Let me worry about that
Just leave the key under the mat and clear out
(into phone; resigned) Yes, Mr
Dobisch
He hangs up, shuffles back into the bedroom
(muttering to himself) Anything you say, Mr
Dobisch -- no trouble at all, Mr
Dobisch -- be my guest -- He reappears from the bedroom, pulling his trousers on over his pajama pants
-- We never close at Buddy-boy's -- looks like Marilyn Monroe -- (he chuckles a la Dobisch) Putting on his raincoat and hat, Bud opens the hall door, takes the key from the table, shoves it under the doormat
His eyes fall on the Dreyfuss apartment, and there is some concern on his face
He picks up a pad and pencil from the table, prints something in block letters
Tearing off the top sheet, he impales it on the spindle of the phonograph, then walks out, closing the door behind him
The note reads: - Bud comes out the door, in slippered feet, pants and raincoat over his pajamas
As he sleep-walks down the steps, a cab pulls up in front of the house
Bud ducks discreetly into the areaway
Mr
Dobisch, bareheaded, emerges cautiously from the cab
Between the fingers of his hands he is carrying four long-stemmed glasses, brimful of stingers
The blonde steps out, holding his hat
This the place
Yeah
(to cab driver) How much
Seventy cents
Dobisch, his hands full of stingers, turns to the blonde, indicates his pants pocket
Get the money, will you
The blonde plants the hat on top of his head, unbuttons his overcoat, reaches into his pants pocket
As she does so, she jogs his elbow
Watch those stingers
The blonde has taken out Dobisch's money clip, with about a hundred dollars in it
Give him a buck
The blonde peels a bill off, hands it to the cabbie, hangs on to the rest of the roll just a second too long
Now put it back, honey
(she does) Atta girl
The cab drives off
Dobisch and the blonde start up the steps to the house
You sure this is a good idea
Can't think of a better one
(holding door open for him) mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night
(edging past her with stingers) Don't worry about the old lady
One squawk from her, and she's out of a job
In the areaway, Bud has overheard them, and it doesn't make him any happier
He steps out on the sidewalk, shuffles down the street
- The blonde and Dobisch, his hands full of stingers, come up to Bud's door
Get the key, will you
Automatically, she reaches into his pocket
Not there
Under the mat
(puzzled) Under the mat
(picks up key) (impatiently) Open up, open up -- we haven't got all night
The blonde unlocks the door to the apartment, opens it
(suspiciously) So this is your mother's apartment
That's right
Maria Ouspenskaya
(sticking her head in) Hiya, Ouspenskaya
Dobisch nudges her inside with his knee, kicks the door shut behind him
The landing is empty for a second
Then the door of the rear apartment opens, and Dr
Dreyfuss, in a beaten bathrobe, sets out a couple of empty milk bottles with a note in them
Suddenly, from Bud's apartment, comes a shrill female giggle
Dr
Dreyfuss reacts
Then the cha cha music starts full blast
(calling to his wife, off-screen) Mildred -- he's at it again
Shaking his head, he closes the door
- Bud, in raincoat and slippered feet, turns in off the street, plods along a path in the deserted park
He stops at a damp bench under a lamp post, sits
In the background, lights shine from the towering buildings on Central Park South
Bud huddles inside his raincoat, shivering
He is very sleepy by now
His eyes close and his head droops
gust of wind sends wet leaves swirling across the bench
Bud doesn't stir
He is all in
: - It's a quarter to nine of a gray November morning, and work- bound employees are piling in through the doors
Among them is Bud, bundled up in a raincoat, hat, heavy muffler and wool gloves, and carrying a box of Kleenex
He coughs, pulls out a tissue, wipes his dripping nose
He has a bad cold
The lobby is an imposing, marbled affair, as befits a company which last year wrote 9
3 billion dollars worth of insurance
There are sixteen elevators, eight of them marked  -  1-18, and opposite them eight marked -  18-37
The starter, a uniformed Valkyrie wielding a clicker, is directing the flow of traffic into the various elevators
Bud joins the crowd in front of one of the express elevators
Also standing there is Mr
Kirkeby, reading the Herald- Tribune
(hoarsely) Good morning, Mr
Kirkeby
(as if he just knew him vaguely) Oh, how are you, Baxter
They keeping you busy these days
Yes, sir
They are indeed
(he sniffs) The elevator doors open, revealing the operator
She is in her middle twenties and her name is
Maybe it's the way she's put together, maybe it's her face, or maybe it's just the uniform -- in any case, there is something very appealing about her
She is also an individualist -- she wears a carnation in her lapel, which is strictly against regulations
As the elevator loads, she greets the passengers cheerfully
(rattling it off) Morning, Mr
Kessel -- Morning, Miss Robinson -- Morning, Mr
Kirkeby -- Morning, Mr
Williams -- Morning, Miss Livingston -- Morning, Mr
McKellway -- Morning, Mr
Pirelli -- Morning, Mrs
Schubert -- Interspersed is an occasional "Morning, Miss Kubelik" from the passengers
Morning, Mr
Baxter
Morning, Miss Kubelik
He takes his hat off -- he is the only one
The express is now loaded
(working the clicker) That's all
Take it away
(shutting the door) Watch the door, please
Blasting off
Bud is standing right next to Fran as the packed express shoots up
(studying her) What did you do to your hair
It was making me nervous, so chopped it off
Big mistake, huh
sort of like it
He sniffs, takes out a Kleenex, wipes his nose
Say, you got a lulu
Yeah
better not get too close
Oh,  never catch colds
Really
was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year
That makes me feel just terrible
Why
Well, to make the figures come out even -- since  have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year
That's me
(dabs his nose) You should have stayed in bed this morning
should have stayed in bed last night
The elevator has slowed down, now stops
Fran opens the door
Nineteen
Watch your step
About a third of the passengers get out, including Bud and Mr
Kirkeby
As Kirkeby passes Fran, he slaps her behind with his folded newspaper
Fran jumps slightly
(all in the day's work) And watch your hand, Mr
Kirkeby
(innocently) beg your pardon
One of these days 'm going to shut those doors on you and -- She withdraws her hand into the sleeve of her uniform, and waves the "amputated" arm at him
Twenty next
The doors close
- Kirkeby turns away from the elevator, and grinning smugly, falls in beside Bud
That Kubelik -- boy
Would  like to get her on a slow elevator to China
Oh, yes
She's the best operator in the building
'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise
Maybe you're using the wrong approach
lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice
What is she trying to prove
Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them
Listen to him
Little Lord Fauntleroy
Leaving Bud at the employees' coat-racks, Kirkeby heads toward his office, one of the glass-enclosed cubicles
Bud hangs up his hat and raincoat, stows away the gloves and muffler
Out of his coat pocket he takes a plastic anti- histamine sprayer and a box of cough drops, and still carrying the Kleenex, threads his way to his desk
Most of the desks are already occupied, and the others are filling rapidly
Once seated at his desk, Bud arranges his medicaments neatly in front of him
He takes a Kleenex out of the box, blows his nose, then leaning back in his swivel chair sprays first one nostril, then the other
Suddenly the piercing bell goes off -- the workday has begun
Being the ultra-conscientious type, Bud instantly sits upright in his chair, removes the cover from his computing machine, picks up a batch of perforated premium cards, starts entering figures on his computer
After a few seconds, he glances around to make sure that everybody in the vicinity is busy
Then he looks up a number in the company telephone directory, dials furtively
(cupping hand over phone mouthpiece) Hello, Mr
Dobisch
This is Baxter, on the nineteenth floor
'  - It is a glass-enclosed cubicle on the twenty-first floor
Through the glass we see another enormous layout of desks, everybody working away
Dobisch is holding the phone in one hand, running an electric shaver over his face with the other
Oh, Buddy-boy
was just about to call you
(shuts off electric shaver) 'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall
You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but 'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil
- It's not Picasso 'm calling about
It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat
- did, didn't
distinctly remember bending over and putting it there -- - Oh,  found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key
- It is
(takes Bud's key out of his pocket) Well, how about that
No wonder couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning
- And  couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a
m
had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut
- That's a shame
'll send the key right down
And about your promotion -- (leafs through report on desk) -- 'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr
Sheldrake, in Personnel
wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over
- Thank you, Mr
Dobisch
He hangs up, feels his forehead
It is warm
Clipped to his handkerchief pocket are a black fountain pen and, next to it, a thermometer in a black case
Bud unclips the thermometer case, unscrews the cap, shakes the thermometer out, puts it under his tongue
He resumes work
messenger comes up to his desk with an interoffice envelope
From Mr
Dobisch
(thermometer in mouth) Wait
He turns away from the messenger, unties the string of the envelope, takes his key out, puts it in a coat pocket
From a trouser pocket, he extracts Dobisch's key to the executive washroom, slips it discreetly into the envelope, reties it, hands it to the messenger
(thermometer in mouth) To Mr
Dobisch
Puzzled by the whole procedure, the messenger leaves
Bud now removes the thermometer from his mouth, reads it
It's worse than he thought
He puts the thermometer back in the case, clips it to his pocket, takes his desk calendar out of a drawer, turns a leaf
Under the date ,  4 there is an entry in his handwriting --
Bud consults the telephone directory again, picks up the phone, dials
'  - This is another glass-enclosed cubicle on another floor
, a Junior Chamber of Commerce type, is dictating to an elderly secretary who sits across the desk from him
Dear Mr
MacIntosh -- (phone rings and he picks it up) Vanderhof, Public Relations
Oh, yes, Baxter
Just a minute
(to secretary) All right, Miss Finch -- type up what we got so far
(he waits till she is out of the office; then, into phone) Now what is it, Baxter
- Look, Mr
Vanderhof -- 've got you down here for tonight -- but 'm going to be using the place myself -- so 'll have to cancel
- Cancel
But it's her birthday -- already ordered the cake -- - hate to disappoint you --  mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight -- - That's not like you, Baxter
Just the other day, at the staff meeting, was telling Mr
Sheldrake what a reliable man you were
- Thank you, Mr
Vanderhof
But 'm sick --  have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and  got to go to bed right after work
- Buddy-boy, that's the worst thing you can do
If you got a cold, you should go to a Turkish bath -- spend the night there -- sweat it out -- - Oh, no
'd get pneumonia -- and if got pneumonia, 'd be in bed for a month -- and if  were in bed for a month -- - Okay, you made your point
We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week can get away
- Wednesday -- Wednesday -- (leafing through calendar) got somebody penciled in -- let me see what  can do -- 'll get back to you
He hangs up, riffles through the directory, finds the number, and with a furtive look around, dials again
(into phone) Mr
Eichelberger
Is this Mortgage and Loan
'd like to speak to Mr
Eichelberger
Yes, it is urgent
'  - Also glass-enclosed, but slightly larger than the others
, a solid citizen of about fifty, is displaying some mortgage graphs to three associates
fourth one has answered the phone
(holding out phone to Eichelberger) For you, Mel
Eichelberger puts the charts down, takes the phone
Eichelberger here -- oh, yes, Baxter -- (a glance at his associates; then continues, as though it were a business call) What's your problem
-- Wednesday is out
-- oh -- that throws a little monkey wrench into my agenda -- Thursday
No, 'm all tied up on Thursday -- let's schedule that meeting for Friday
- Friday
(checks calendar) Let me see what  can do
'll get back to you
He hangs up, consults the directory, starts to dial a number
'  - It's another of those glass-enclosed cubicles, on the nineteenth floor
Kirkeby is talking into a dictaphone
Premium-wise and billing-wise, we are eighteen percent ahead of last year, October-wise
The phone has been ringing
Kirkeby switches off the machine, picks up the phone
Hello
Yeah, Baxter
What's up
- Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday
You'd be doing me a great favor -- - Well -- it's all right with me, Bud
Let me check
'll get back to you
He presses down the button on the cradle, dials Operator
There is a double switchboard in the center, with nine girls on each side, all busy as beavers
In the foreground we recognize Sylvia, Kirkeby's date of last night
Consolidated Life -- 'll connect you -- Consolidated Life -- The girl next to her turns and holds out a line
Sylvia -- it's for you
Sylvia plugs the call into her own switchboard
Yes
Oh, hello -- sure  got home all right -- you owe me forty-five cents
- Okay, okay
Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night
- Thursday
That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack
- Bob
-- all right, so we'll watch it at the apartment
Big deal
(he hangs up, dials) Baxter
It's okay for Thursday
- Bud, at his desk, is on the phone
Thank you, Mr
Kirkeby
(hangs up, consults directory, dials) Mr
Eichelberger
It's okay for Friday
(hangs up, consults directory, dials) Mr
Vanderhof
It's okay for Wednesday
During this, the phone has rung at the next desk, and the occupant,
, has picked it up
As Bud hangs up -- (into phone) All right -- 'll tell him
(hangs up, turns to Bud) Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel
Mr
Sheldrake's secretary
Sheldrake
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes
They want you up stairs
Oh
He jumps up, stuffs the nose-spray into one pocket, a handful of Kleenex into the other
What gives, Baxter
You getting promoted or getting fired
(cockily) Care to make a small wager
've been here twice as long as you have -- Shall we say -- a dollar
It's a bet
Bud snake-hips between the desks like a broken-field runner
At the elevator, Bud presses the  button, paces nervously
One of the elevator doors opens, and as Bud starts inside, the doors of the adjoining elevator open, and Fran Kubelik sticks her head out
Going up
Hearing her voice, Bud throws a quick "Excuse me" to the other operator, exits quickly and steps into Fran's elevator
Twenty-seven, please
And drive carefully
You're carrying precious cargo --  mean, manpower-wise
Fran shuts the doors
- Fran presses a button, and the elevator starts up
Twenty-seven
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but 'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise
You're beginning to sound like Mr
Kirkeby already
Why not
Now that they're kicking me upstairs -- Couldn't happen to a nicer guy
(Bud beams) You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator
Really
The characters you meet
Something happens to men in elevators
Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy,  could tell you stories -- 'd love to hear them
Maybe we could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime -- or some evening, after work -- The elevator has stopped, and Fran opens the doors
Twenty-seven
-   - It is pretty plush up here -- soft carpeting and tall mahogany doors leading to the executive offices
The elevator door is open, and Bud steps out
hope everything goes all right
hope so
(turning back) Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything -- (fumbling with his tie) How do  look
Fine
(stepping out of elevator) Wait
She takes the carnation out of her lapel, starts to put it in Bud's buttonhole
Thank you
That's the first thing ever noticed about you -- when you were still on the local elevator -- you always wore a flower -- The elevator buzzer is now sounding insistently
Fran steps back inside
Good luck
And wipe your nose
She shuts the doors
Bud looks after her, then takes a Kleenex out of his pocket, and wiping his nose, crosses to a glass door marked
,
He stashes the used Kleenex away in another pocket, enters
'  - It is a sedate office with a secretary and a couple of typists
The secretary's name is
She is in her thirties, flaxen- haired, handsome, wears harlequin glasses, and has an incisive manner
Bud comes up to her desk
Baxter -- Ordinary Premium Accounting -- Mr
Sheldrake called me
called you -- that is,  tried to call you -- for twenty minutes
'm sorry,  -- Go on in
She indicates the door leading to the inner office
Bud squares his shoulders and starts in
'  - Mr
Sheldrake is a $14,000 a year man, and rates a four- window office
It is not quite an executive suite, but it is several pegs above the glass cubicles of the middle echelon
There is lots of leather, and a large desk behind which sits
He is a substantial looking, authoritative man in his middle forties, a pillar of his suburban community, a blood donor and a family man
The latter is attested to by a framed photograph showing two boys, aged 8 and 10, in military school uniforms
As Baxter comes through the door, Sheldrake is leafing through Dobisch's efficiency report
He looks up at Bud through a pair of heavy-rimmed reading glasses
Baxter
Yes, sir
(studying him) was sort of wondering what you looked like
Sit down
Yes, Mr
Sheldrake
He seats himself on the very edge of the leather armchair facing Sheldrake
Been hearing some very nice things about you -- here's a report from Mr
Dobisch -- loyal, cooperative, resourceful -- Mr
Dobisch said that
And Mr
Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime
(modestly) Well, you know how it is -- things pile up
Mr
Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr
Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments
That's very flattering
Sheldrake puts the report down, takes off his glasses, leans across the desk toward Bud
Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular
don't know
Think
Bud does so
For a moment, he is a picture of intense concentration
Then -- Would you mind repeating the question
Look, Baxter, 'm not stupid know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year
(in a very small voice) You do
(rises, starts pacing) In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler
He was very popular, too
Turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our
machines -- so the day before the Kentucky Derby,  called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth floor
(worried) The Vice Squad
That's right, Baxter
What -- what's that got to do with me
'm not running any bookie joint
What kind of joint are you running
Sir
There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to
Who
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful
Baxter
Oh
Are you going to deny it
No, sir
'm not going to deny it
But if you'd just let me explain -- You better
(a deep breath) Well, about six months ago --  was going to night school, taking this course in Advanced Accounting -- and one of the guys in our department -- he lives in Jersey -- he was going to a banquet at the Biltmore -- his wife was meeting him in town, and he needed someplace to change into a tuxedo -- so gave him the key    and word must have gotten around -- because the next thing  knew, all sorts of guys were suddenly going to banquets -- and when you give the key to one guy, you can't say no to another and the whole thing got out of hand -- pardon me
He whips out the nasal-spray, administers a couple of quick squirts up each nostril
Baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust
Any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming -- (shifting into a new gear) How many charter members are there in this little club of yours
Just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise
That's not the point
Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out -- Oh, it won't
Believe me
And it's not going to happen again
From now on, nobody is going to use my apartment -- In his vehemence he squeezes the spray bottle, which squirts all over the desk
Where is your apartment
West 67th Street
You have no idea what 've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key -- How do you work it with the key
Well, usually  slip it to them in the office and they leave it under the mat -- but never again --  can promise you that -- The phone buzzer sounds, and Sheldrake picks up the phone
Yes, Miss Olsen
'  - Miss Olsen is on the phone
Mrs
Sheldrake returning your call -- on two -- She presses a button down, starts to hang the phone up, glances around to see if the typists are watching, then raises the receiver to her ear and eavesdrops on the conversation
'  - Sheldrake is talking into the phone
Yes, dear --  called you earlier -- where were you
Oh, you took Tommy to the dentist -- During this, Bud has risen from his chair, started inching toward the door
(turning to him) Where are you going, Baxter
Well,  don't want to intrude -- and  thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway -- 'm not through with you yet
Yes, sir
(into phone) The reason  called is --  won't be home for dinner tonight
The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- 'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else
No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling
(hangs up, turns to Bud) Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man
Not yet
But  hear it's one swell show
How would you like to go tonight
You mean -- you and me
thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City -- made other plans
You can have both tickets
Well, that's very kind of you -- only 'm not feeling well -- you see,  have this cold -- and thought 'd go straight home
Baxter, you're not reading me told you  have plans
So do  -- 'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else -- 'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter --  want to swap them
Swap them
For what
Sheldrake picks up the Dobisch reports, puts on his glasses, turns a page
It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative -- Oh
(the dawn is breaking) Oh
He reaches into his coat pocket, fishes out a handful of Kleenex, and then finally the key to his apartment
He holds it up
This
That's good thinking, Baxter
Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as 'm concerned, you're executive material
am
Now put down the key -- (pushing a pad toward him) -- and put down the address
Bud lays the key on the desk, unclips what he thinks is his fountain pen, uncaps it, starts writing on the pad
It's on the second floor - my name is not on the door -- it just says 2A -- Suddenly he realizes that he has been trying to write the address with the thermometer
Oh -- terribly sorry
It's that cold -- Relax, Baxter
Thank you, sir
He has replaced the thermometer with the fountain pen, and is scribbling the address
You'll be careful with the record player, won't you
And about the liquor --  ordered some this morning -- but 'm not sure when they'll deliver it -- He has finished writing the address, shoves the pad over to Sheldrake
Now remember, Baxter -- this is going to be our little secret
Yes, of course
You know how people talk
Oh, you don't have to worry -- Not that  have anything to hide
Oh, no sir
Certainly not
Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise
(holding out the tickets) Here you are, Baxter
Have a nice time
You too, sir
Clutching the tickets, he backs out of the office
: - It is about 6:30, and the building has pretty well emptied out by now
Bud, in raincoat and hat, is leaning against one of the marble pillars beyond the elevators
His raincoat is unbuttoned, and Fran's carnation is still in his lapel
He is looking off expectantly toward a door marked ' -
Some of the female employees are emerging, dressed for the street
Among them are Sylvia and her colleague from the switchboard
So  figure, a man in his position, he's going to take me to 21 and El Morocco -- instead, he takes me to Hamburg Heaven and some schnook's apartment -- They pass Bud without paying any attention to him
Bud has heard the crack, and looks after Sylvia, a little hurt
Then he glances back toward the door of the lounge, as it opens and Fran Kubelik comes out
She is wearing a wool coat over a street dress, no hat
(passing Bud) Good night
(casually) Good night
She is about three paces beyond him when he suddenly realizes who it is
Oh -- Miss Kubelik
(he rushes after her, taking off his hat) 've been waiting for you
You have
almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time 've ever seen you in civilian clothes
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor
Great
Look -- have you seen The Music Man
No
Would you like to
Sure
thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then -- You mean tonight
Yeah
'm sorry, but  can't tonight
'm meeting somebody
Oh
(a beat) You mean -- like a girl-friend
No
Like a man
She proceeds across the lobby toward the street entrance, Bud following her
wasn't trying to be personal -- it's just that the fellows in the office were -- whether you wondering about you ever -- Just tell 'em -- now and then
This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious
It used to be serious -- at least was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt
Well, in that case, couldn't you --
'm afraid not
promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week -- Oh,  understand
He follows her out through the revolving doors
- Fran and Bud come out
(putting his hat on) Well, it was just an idea --  hate to see a ticket go to waste -- (stops) What time does the show go on
Eight-thirty
(looks at her watch) Well --  could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right
All right
That's wonderful
It's the Majestic -- 44th Street
Meet you in the lobby
Okay
Bud nods happily, falls in beside her as she starts down the street
You know,  felt so lousy this morning -- a hundred and one fever -- then my promotion came up -- now you and  -- eleventh row center -- and you said  should have stayed in bed
How is your cold
(high as a kite) What cold
And after the show, we could go out on the town -- (does a little cha cha step) 've been taking from Arthur Murray
So  see
They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live
Sounds good
(a sudden thought) How do you know where  live
Oh,  even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law --  know when you were born -- and where --  know all sorts of things about you
How come
couple of months ago  looked up your card in the group insurance file
Oh
know your height, your weight and your Social Security number -- you had mumps, you had measles, and you had your appendix out
They have now reached the corner, and Fran stops
Well, don't tell the fellows in the office about the appendix
They may get the wrong idea how you found out
(turning the corner) 'Bye
(calling after her) Eight-thirty
He watches her walk away, an idiot grin on his face
Despite what he told Fran, his nose is stuffed up, so he takes out the anti-histamine and sprays his nostrils
Then, carried away, he squirts some of the stuff on the carnation in his buttonhole, moves off in the opposite direction
- Fran comes hurrying along the street
She is late
Her objective is a small Chinese restaurant, with a neon sign reading   -  -
She starts down a flight of steps leading to the entrance
- The bar is a long, narrow, dimly-lit room with booths along one side
Beyond a bamboo curtain is the main dining room, which does not concern us
The place is decorated in Early Beachcomber style rattan, fish-nets, conch-shells, etc
The help is Chinese
At this early hour, there are only half a dozen customers in the place -- all at the bar except for one man, sitting in the last booth with his back toward camera
At a piano, a Chinese member of Local 808 is improvising mood music
Fran comes through the door, and without looking around, heads straight for the last booth
The bartender nods to her -- they know her there
As she passes the piano player, he gives her a big smile, segues into
Fran comes up to the man sitting in the last booth
(a wistful smile) Good evening, Mr
Sheldrake
Sheldrake, for that's who it is, looks around nervously to make sure no one has heard her
Please, Fran -- not so loud
(he gets up) Still afraid somebody may see us together
(reaching for her coat) Let me take that
No, Jeff
can't stay very long
(sits opposite him, with her coat on) Can  have a frozen daiquiri
It's on the way
(sits down) see you went ahead and cut your hair
That's right
You know  liked it better long
Yes,  know
You want a lock to carry in your wallet
waiter comes up with a tray: two daiquiris, fried shrimp, eggrolls, and a bowl of sauce
(showing all his teeth) Evening, lady
Nice see you again
Thank you
The waiter has set everything on the table, leaves
How long has it been -- a month
Six weeks
But who's counting
missed you, Fran
Like old times
Same booth, same song -- It's been hell
(dipping shrimp) -- same sauce -- sweet and sour
You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr
Sheldrake -- 'm still crazy about you, Fran
(avoiding his eyes) Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please
'm just beginning to get over it
don't believe you
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it
Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl
Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye
The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl -- (she is barely able to control herself) They don't make these shrimp like they used to
never said goodbye, Fran
(not listening) For a while there, you try kidding yourself that you're going with an unmarried man
Then one day he keeps looking at his watch, and asks you if there's any lipstick showing, then rushes off to catch the seven-fourteen to White Plains
So you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee -- and you sit there by yourself -- and you think -- and it all begins to look so ugly -- There are tears in her eyes
She breaks off, downs what's left of the daiquiri
How do you think  felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff
What do you want from me
(taking her hand) want you back, Fran
(withdrawing her hand) Sorry, Mr
Sheldrake -- 'm full up
You'll have to take the next elevator
You're not giving me a chance, Fran
asked you to meet me because -- have something to tell you
Go ahead -- tell me
(a glance around) Not here, Fran
Can't we go some place else
No
have a date at eight-thirty
Important
Not very -- but 'm going to be there anyway
She takes out an inexpensive square compact with a fleur de lis pattern on it, opens it, starts to fix her face
The waiter comes up with a couple of menus
You ready order dinner now
No
No dinner
Bring us two more drinks
: - It is 8:25, and there is the usual hectic to-do -- taxis pulling up, people milling around the sidewalk and crowding into the lobby
In the middle of this melee, buffeted by the throng, stands Bud, in raincoat and hat, looking anxiously for Fran
: - Fran and Sheldrake, in the booth, are working on the second round of drinks
Fran -- remember that last weekend we had
(wryly) Do
That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver -- Remember what we talked about
We talked about a lot of things
mean -- about my getting a divorce
We didn't talk about it -- you did
You didn't really believe me, did you
(shrugging) They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By
My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me -- That's enough, Fran
(going right on) Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow -- You're not being funny
wasn't trying
If you'll just listen to me for a minute -- Okay
'm sorry
saw my lawyer this morning -- wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it -- Handle what
What do you think
(looking at him for a long moment - then) Let's get something straight, Jeff --  never asked you to leave your wife
Of course not
You had nothing to do with it
(her eyes misting up again) Are you sure that's what you want
'm sure
If you'll just tell me that you still love me -- (softly) You know  do
Fran -- He takes her hand, kisses it
The bar has been filling up, and now two couples are seating themselves in a nearby booth
One of the women is Miss Olsen
(pulling her hand away gently) Jeff -- darling -- She indicates the other customers
Sheldrake glances over his shoulder
It is crowding up
Let's get out of here
They rise
Sheldrake leaves some money on the table, leads Fran toward the entrance
As they pass Miss Olsen's booth, she turns around slowly, and putting on her glasses, looks after them
Sheldrake slips a bill to the piano player, who gives them a big smile, slides into   again
Retrieving his hat and coat from the checkroom girl, Sheldrake steers Fran through the door
Miss Olsen watches them with a cold smile
- Fran and Sheldrake come up the steps
(to a passing cab) Taxi
It passes without stopping
have that date -- remember
love you -- remember
Another taxi approaches
Sheldrake gives a shrill whistle, and it pulls up
He opens the door
Where are we going, Jeff
Not back to that leaky boat -- promise
He helps her into the cab, takes out of his coat pocket the page from the pad on which Bud wrote the address of the apartment
(to cab driver) 51 West Sixty-Seventh
He gets in beside Fran, shuts the door
As the cab pulls away, through the rear window the two can be seen kissing
: - It's 9 o'clock, the lobby is deserted, and standing on the sidewalk all by himself, is Bud
He takes a Kleenex out of his pocket, blows his nose, stuffs the used Kleenex in another pocket
He looks up and down the street, consults his watch, decides to wait just a little longer
: : ' The leaves are flipping over
Mr
Sheldrake seems to be using The Apartment regularly -- for the name Sheldrake, in Bud's handwriting, appears on the pages dated Monday, November 9, Thursday, November 12, Thursday, November 19, Monday, November 23, and Monday, November 30
Mr
Sheldrake also seems to be Baxter's only customer by now, since the other leaves of the calendar are blank
: -   - It is a gloomy December morning, and hundreds of desk-bound employees are bent over their paper-work
Bud Baxter, in raincoat and hat, is clearing out his desk
He has piled everything on his blotter pad -- reference books, papers, a fountain pen set, pencils, paper clips and the calendar
Watching him from the next desk is a dumbfounded Moffett
Bud picks up the blotter pad with his stuff on it, and as he moves past Moffett's desk, Moffett takes out a dollar bill, drops it grudgingly on the loaded pad
Bud flashes him a little grin, continues between the desks toward the row of glass-enclosed offices housing the supervisory personnel
He comes up to an unoccupied cubicle
sign painter is brushing in some new lettering on the glass door -- it reads , Second Administrative Assistant
Bud studies the sign with a good deal of satisfaction
(to painter) Would you mind --
(the painter turns around) Baxter -- that's me
With an "Oh, " the painter opens the door for him
'  - Bud enters his new office, deposits his stuff on the bare desk, looks around possessively
The small cubicle boasts one window, carpeting on the floor, a filing cabinet, a couple of synthetic-leather chairs, and a clothes-tree -- to Bud, it is the Taj Mahal
He crosses to the clothes-tree, removes his hat and coat, hangs them up
From  comes -- ' Hi, Buddy-boy
' Congratulations, and all that jazz
Bud turns
Kirkeby, Dobisch, Eichelberger and Vanderhof have come into the office
Hi, fellas
Well, you made it, kid -- just like we promised
Quite an office -- name on the door -- rug on the floor -- the whole schmear
Yeah
Teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this
All for one and one for all -- know what mean
have a vague idea
Kirkeby signals to Vanderhof, who shuts the door
The four charter members of the club start closing in on Bud
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise
Oh, 'm very grateful
Then why are you locking us out, all of a sudden
It's been sort of rough these last few weeks -- what with my cold and like that -- He has picked up the desk calendar, shoves it discreetly into one of the drawers
We went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us
Well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground
All right, so you got yourself a girl -- that's okay with us -- but not every night of the week
How selfish can you get
(to the others) Last week  had to borrow my nephew's car and take Sylvia to a drive-in in Jersey
'm too old for that sort of thing --  mean, in a Volkswagen
sympathize with your problem -- and believe me, 'm very sorry -- You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you
You threatening me
Listen, Baxter, we made you and we can break you
He deliberately flips a cigar ash on Bud's desk
At the same time, the door opens, and Sheldrake comes striding in briskly
Good morning, Mr
Sheldrake
The others swivel around
Morning, gentlemen
(to Bud) Everything satisfactory
You like your office
Oh, yes, sir
Very much
And  want to thank you -- Don't thank me -- thank your friends here -- they're the ones who recommended you
The four friends manage to work up some sickly smiles
We just dropped in to wish him the best
(quickly brushes cigar ash off desk) (as they move toward the door) So long, Baxter
We know you won't let us down
So long, fellas
Drop in any time
The door is always open -- to my office
They leave
Sheldrake and Bud are alone
like the way you handled that
Well, how does it feel to be an executive
Fine
And  want you to know 'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- Sure you will
(a beat) Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key
Well --  guess so
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen -- Oh, yes
Very attractive
Is she -- the lucky one
No, you don't understand
She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances
Yes, sir
You can't be too careful
He glances toward the glass partitions to make sure that nobody is watching
have something here --  think it belongs to you
Out of his pocket he has slipped the compact with the fleur- de-lis pattern we saw Fran use at the Rickshaw
He holds it out to Sheldrake
To me
mean -- the young lady -- whoever she may be -- it was on the couch when  got home last night
Oh, yes
Thanks
The mirror is broken
(opens compact, revealing crack in mirror) It was broken when  found it
So it was
(takes the compact) She threw it at me
Sir
You know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time
(man-of-the-world) know how it is
You see a girl a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife
ask you -- is that fair
No, sir
That's very unfair -- especially to your wife
Yeah
(shifting gears) You know, Baxter,  envy you
Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications -- Yes, sir
That's the life, all right
Put me down for Thursday again
Roger
And 'll get that other key
Sheldrake exits
Bud takes the calendar out of the desk drawer, makes an entry
: ' Again the leaves are flipping over, and again we see Sheldrake's name in Bud's handwriting -- booked for the following dates: Monday, December 14, Thursday, December 17, Monday, December 21, Thursday, December 24
: - Perched on top of the switchboard is a small decorated Christmas tree, and the operators are dispensing holiday greetings to all callers
Consolidated Life -- Merry Christmas -- 'll connect you -- Consolidated Life -- Merry Christmas -- 'm ringing -- In the foreground, Sylvia is engaged in a private conversation of her own
(into mouthpiece) Yeah
--
-- Where
-- You bet -- She tears off her headset, and turns to the other girls
Somebody watch my line -- there's a swinging party up on the nineteenth floor -- She scoots out the door
The other girls immediately abandon their posts, and dash after her
- It's a swinging party, all right
Nobody is working
Several desks have been cleared and pushed together, and on top of this improvised stage four female employees and Mr
Dobisch, with his pants-legs rolled up, are doing a Rockette kick routine to the tune of
Employees are ringed around the performers, some drinking out of paper cups, others singing and clapping in rhythm
One of the cubicles has been transformed into a bar, and it is jammed with people
Mr
Kirkeby and Mr
Vanderhof are pouring -- each has a couple of bottles of liquor in his hands, and is emptying them into the open top of a water- cooler
But the stuff is flowing out as fast as it flows in -- everybody is in line with a paper cup waiting for a refill
Bud comes shouldering his way out of the crowded cubicle, holding aloft two paper cups filled with booze
Since his promotion he has bought himself a new suit, dark flannel, and with it he wears a white shirt with a pinned round collar, and a foulard tie
He also has quite a glow on
Detouring past necking couples, he heads in the direction of the elevators
The doors of Fran's elevator are just opening, and the switchboard operators, led by Sylvia, come streaming out
(to a colleague) -- so  said to him: Never again
-- either get yourself a bigger car or a smaller girl -- As they head for the party, they pass Bud, who is approaching the elevator with the two drinks
Fran is just closing the elevator doors
Miss Kubelik
The doors slide open again, and Fran looks out
Instead of the customary carnation in the lapel of her uniform, she wears a sprig of holly
(holding out one of the drinks) Marry Christmas
Thank you
(takes drink) thought you were avoiding me
What gave you that idea
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off
Well, as a matter of fact,  was rather hurt when you stood me up that night -- don't blame you
It was unforgivable
forgive you
You shouldn't
You couldn't help yourself
mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man
You did the only decent thing
Don't be too sure
Just because wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout
Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as 'm concerned, you're tops
mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise
(toasting) Cheers
Cheers
They down their drinks
Bud takes the empty cup from her
One more
(indicating elevator) shouldn't drink when 'm driving
You're so right
He reaches into the elevator, takes a cardboard sign off a hook, hangs it on the elevator door
It reads By the power vested in me, herewith declare this elevator out of order
(leading her toward the party) Shall we join the natives
Why not
(as they pass a kissing couple) They seem friendly enough
Don't you believe it
Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes
How many of those drinks did you have
(holding up four fingers) Three
thought so
They have now reached the entrance to the bar, which is overflowing with thirsty natives
You wait here
think  hear the sound of running water
He leaves her outside the cubicle, and elbows his way through the crowd toward the booze-filled water cooler
Out of another cubicle comes Miss Olsen, cup in hand
She too has had quite a few
Seeing Fran, she walks up to her, with an acid smile on her face
Hi
How's the branch manager from Kansas City
beg your pardon
'm Miss Olsen -- Mr
Sheldrake's secretary
Yes,  know
So you don't have to play innocent with me
He used to tell his wife that  was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding
don't know what you're talking about
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor -- (wanting to get away) Will you excuse me
(holding her by the arm) What for
You haven't done anything -- it's him -- what a salesman -- always the last booth in the Chinese restaurant -- and the same pitch about divorcing his wife -- and in the end you wind up with egg foo yong on your face
Bud comes burrowing out of the crowded cubicle, balancing the two filled paper cups, spots Fran
Miss Kubelik
Fran turns away from Miss Olsen
Well -- thank you
Always happy to do something for our girls in uniform
She moves off as Bud joins Fran, who is looking a little pale
You all right
What's the matter
Nothing
(takes the drink) There are just too many people here
Why don't we step into any office
There's something  want your advice about, anyway
(leads her toward his cubicle) have my own office now, naturally
And you may be interested to know 'm the second youngest executive in the company -- the only one younger is a grandson of the chairman of the board
'  - Bud ushers Fran in, and is confronted by a strange couple necking in the corner
He gestures them out, crosses to his desk
Miss Kubelik,  would like your honest opinion
've had this in my desk for a week -- cost me fifteen dollars -- but  just couldn't get up enough nerve to wear it -- From under the desk he has produced a hatbox, and out of the hatbox a black bowler, which he now puts on his head
It's what they call the junior executive model
What do you think
Fran looks at him blankly, absorbed in her own thoughts
Guess  made a boo-boo, huh
(paying attention again) No --  like it
Really
You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this
Of course not
Maybe if  wore it a little more to the side -- (adjusting hat) is that better
Much better
Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in -- This is a bad day for me
understand
Christmas -- family and all that -- 'd better get back to my elevator
don't want to be fired
Oh, you don't have to worry about that
have quite a bit of influence in Personnel
You know Mr
Sheldrake
(guardedly) Why
He and  are like this
(crosses his fingers) Sent me a Christmas card
See
He has picked up a Christmas card from his desk, shows it to Fran
It is a photograph of the Sheldrake clan grouped around an elaborate Christmas tree -- Mr
and Mrs
Sheldrake, the two boys in military school uniforms, and a big French poodle
Underneath it says: ' from the Emily, Jeff, Tommy, Jeff Jr
, and Figaro
(studying the card ruefully) Makes a cute picture
thought maybe  could put in a word for you with Mr
Sheldrake -- get you a little promotion -- how would you like to be an elevator starter
'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me
No problem
Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling -- (touching the brim of his bowler) -- you sure this is the right way to wear it
think so
You don't think it's tilted a little too much -- Fran takes her compact out of her uniform pocket, opens it, hands it to Bud
Here
(examining himself in the mirror) After all, this is a conservative firm --  don't want people to think 'm an entertainer -- His voice trails off
There is something familiar about the cracked mirror of the compact -- and the fleur-de-lis pattern on the case confirms his suspicion
Fran notices the peculiar expression on his face
What is it
(with difficulty) The mirror -- it's broken
know
like it this way -- makes me look the way  feel
The phone has started to ring
Bud doesn't hear it
He closes the compact, hands it to Fran
Your phone
Oh
(picks up phone from desk) Yes
(throws a quick look at Fran) Just a minute
(covers mouthpiece; to Fran) If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal All right
Have a nice Christmas
She exits, closing the door
Bud takes his hand off the mouthpiece
(every word hurts) Yes, Mr
Sheldrake -- no,  didn't forget -- the tree is up and the Tom and Jerry mix is in the refrigerator -- yes, sir -- same to you
He hangs up, stands there for a moment, the bowler still on his head, the noise from the party washing over him
He slowly crosses to the clothes-tree
picks up his coat -- a new, black chesterfield
With the coat over his arm, he starts out of the office
- The party has picked up tempo
On top of the desks, Sylvia is doing a mock strip tease -- without taking any clothes off
There is hollering, drinking and clapping all around her
Bud moves past the floor show, paying no attention
Kirkeby spots him, detaches himself from the cheering section around Sylvia
Where you going, Buddy-boy
The party's just starting
(catching up with him) Listen, kid -- give me a break, will you -- how about tomorrow afternoon
can't take her to that drive-in again -- the car doesn't even have a heater four o'clock -- okay
Bud ignores him, continues walking through the ranks of empty desks
: -      - It is six o'clock, and the joint is crowded with customers having one for the road before joining their families for Christmas Eve
There are men with gaily wrapped packages, small trussed-up Christmas trees, a plucked turkey in a plastic bag
Written across the mirror behind the bar, in glittering white letters, is
Everybody is in high spirits, laughing it up and toasting each other
Everybody except Bud Baxter
He is standing at the bar in his chesterfield and bowler, slightly isolated, brooding over an almost empty martini glass
The bartender comes up, sets down a fresh martini with an olive on a toothpick, takes his payment from a pile of bills and coins lying in front of Bud
Bud fishes out the olive, adds it to half a dozen other impaled olives neatly arranged in fan shape on the counter
He is obviously trying to complete the circle
short, rotund man dressed as Santa Claus hurries in from the street, and comes up to the bar beside Bud
(to bartender) Hey, Charlie -- give me a shot of bourbon -- and step on it -- my sleigh is double parked
He laughs uproariously at his own joke, nudges Bud with his elbow
Bud stares at him coldly, turns back to his martini
The laughter dies in Santa Claus' throat
He gets his short of bourbon, moves down the bar to find more convivial company
Standing near the end of the curved bar is a girl in her middle twenties wearing a ratty fur coat
Her name is MacDOUGALL, she is drinking a Rum Collins through a straw, and she too is alone
From a distance, she is studying Bud with interest
On the bar in front of her is a container of straws in paper wrappers
She takes one of them out, tears off the end of the paper, blows through the straw -- sending the wrapper floating toward Bud
The paper wrapper passes right in front of Bud's nose
He doesn't notice it
Margie, undaunted, lets go with another missile
This time the wrapper lands on the brim of Bud's bowler
No reaction
Another wrapper comes floating in, hits Bud's cheek
He never takes his eye off his martini
Margie leaves her place, and carrying her handbag and her empty glass, comes up alongside Bud
Without a word, she reaches up and removes the wrapper from Bud's bowler
You buy me a drink, 'll buy you some music
(sets the glass down) Rum Collins
Not waiting for an answer, she heads for the juke box
Bud looks after her noncommittally, then turns to the bartender
Rum Collins
(indicating martini glass) And another one of these little mothers
At the juke box, Margie has dropped a coin in and made her selection
The music starts --
She rejoins Bud at the bar just as the bartender is putting down their drinks in front of them
Bud removes the new olive, adds it to the pattern on the counter in front of him
They both drink, staring straight ahead
For quite a while, there is complete silence between them
(out of nowhere) You like Castro
(a blank look from Bud) mean -- how do you feel about Castro
What is Castro
You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard
What about him
Because as far as 'm concerned, he's a no good fink
Two weeks ago wrote him a letter -- never even answered me
That so
All  wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas
Who is Mickey
My husband
He's in Havana -- in jail
Oh
Mixed up in that revolution
Mickey
He wouldn't do nothing like that
He's a jockey
They caught him doping a horse
Well, you can't win 'em all
They sit there silently for a moment, contemplating the injustices of the world
(to herself) 'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville
(drinks; to Bud) You married
No
Family
No
night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment
said  had no family --  didn't say  had an empty apartment
They both drink
: '  - The living room is dark, except for a shaft of light from the kitchen, and the glow of the colored bulbs on a small Christmas tree in front of the phony fireplace
Hunched up in one corner of the couch is Fran, still in her coat and gloves, crying softly
Pacing up and down is Sheldrake
His coat and hat are on a chair, as are several Christmas packages
On the coffee table are an unopened bottle of Scotch, a couple of untouched glasses, and a bowl of melting ice
(stops and faces Fran) Come on, Fran -- don't be like that
You just going to sit there and keep bawling
(no answer) You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong -- (a new approach) Look,  know you think 'm stalling you
But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and  want a divorce
" It's not that easy
(he resumes pacing; Fran continues crying) Anyway, this is the wrong time
The kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays --  can't bring it up now
(stops in front of her) This isn't like you, Fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with -- (through tears) Yeah -- that's me
The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs
Well, that's more like it
At least you're speaking to me
Funny thing happened to me at the office party today --  ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen
You know -- ring-a-ding-ding
laughed so much  like to died
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen
That's ancient history
was never very good at history
Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen -- Now, Fran -- And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me -- Okay, okay, Fran
deserve that
But just ask yourself -- why does a man run around with a lot of girls
Because he's unhappy at home -- because he's lonely, that's why -- all that was before you, Fran -- 've stopped running
Fran has taken a handkerchief out of her bag and is dabbing her eyes
How could  be so stupid
You'd think  would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight
Merry Christmas
She hands him a flat, wrapped package
What is it
He strips away the wrapping to reveal a long-playing record
The cover reads:   - Jimmy Lee Kiang with Orchestra
Oh
Our friend from the Chinese restaurant
Thanks, Fran
We better keep it here
Yeah, we better
have a present for you
didn't quite know what to get you -- anyway it's a little awkward for me, shopping -- (he has taken out a money clip, detaches a bill) -- so here's a hundred dollars -- go out and buy yourself something
He holds the money out, but she doesn't move
Sheldrake slips the bill into her open bag
They have some nice alligator bags at Bergdorf's -- Fran gets up slowly and starts peeling off her gloves
Sheldrake looks at her, then glances nervously at his wrist watch
Fran, it's a quarter to seven -- and  mustn't miss the train -- if we hadn't wasted all that time -- have to get home and trim the tree -- Fran has started to remove her coat
Okay
(shrugs the coat back on) just thought as long as it was paid for -- (an angry step toward her) Don't ever talk like that, Fran
Don't make yourself out to be cheap
hundred dollars
wouldn't call that cheap
And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment -- (grabbing her arms) Stop that, Fran
(quietly) You'll miss your train, Jeff
Sheldrake hurriedly puts on his hat and coat, gathers up his packages
Coming
You run along --  want to fix my face
(heading for the door) Don't forget to kill the lights
See you Monday
Sure
Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again -- (that stops him in the half-open door) It won't always be like this
(coming back) love you, Fran
Holding the packages to one side, he tries to kiss her on the mouth
(turning her head) Careful -- lipstick
He kisses her on the cheek, hurries out of the apartment, closing the door
Fran stands there for a while, blinking back tears, then takes the long-playing record out of its envelope, crosses to the phonograph
She puts the record on, starts the machine -- the music is
As it plays, Fran wanders aimlessly around the darkened room, her body wracked by sobs
Finally she regains control of herself, and picking up her handbag, starts through the bedroom toward the bathroom
In the bathroom, Fran switches on the light, puts her bag on the sink, turns on the faucet
Scooping up some water, she washes the smeared mascara away, then turns the faucet off, picks up a towel As she is drying her face, she notices in the pull-away shaving mirror the magnified reflection of a vial of pills on the medicine shelf
Fran reaches out for the vial, turns it slowly around in her hand
The label reads:  -
Fran studies the label for a second, then returns the vial to the shelf
She opens her handbag, takes out a lipstick
As she does so, she sees the hundred dollar bill Sheldrake left in the bag
Her eyes wander back to the vial on the medicine shelf
Then very deliberately she picks up Bud's mouthwash glass, removes the two toothbrushes from it, turns on the faucet, starts filling the glass with water
: -   - The joint is deserted now except for the Santa Claus, who is leaning against the bar, quite loaded, and Bud and Margie MacDougall, who are dancing to a slow blues coming from the juke box
Bud is still in his overcoat and bowler, and Margie is wearing her fur coat
The bartender is sweeping up the place
(to Santa Claus) Drink up, Pop
It's closing time
But it's early, Charlie
Don't you know what night this is
know, Charlie
know
work for the outfit
He polishes off his drink, walks out unsteadily
The bartender approaches the dancers
Hey, knock it off, will you
Go home
Bud and Margie ignore him, continue dancing -- or rather swaying limply cheek-to-cheek
The bartender crosses to the juke box, pulls the plug out
The music stops, but not Bud and Margie -- they continue dancing
-- -- out
He goes to the front of the bar, starts to extinguish the lights
Margie picks up her handbag from the bar, and Bud downs the remains of his drink
Where do we go -- my place or yours
(peering at his watch) Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does
He leads her through the dark bar toward the entrance
The bartender holds the door open for them as they go out
: - Bud and Margie come walking down the street
As they reach the house, Bud starts up the steps, but Margie continues along the sidewalk
Poor Mickey -- when  think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana -- (opening her handbag) -- want to see his picture
(from steps) Not particularly
Margie, realizing her mistake, hurries back to join him
He's so cute -- five-foot-two -- ninety-nine pounds
like a little chihuahua
They pass through the front door into the vestibule
-   - Bud and Margie are mounting the stairs toward the apartment
Can  ask you a personal question
No
You got a girl-friend
She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine
Still stuck on her, huh
Stuck on her
Obviously, you don't know me very well
don't know you at all
Permit me --
Baxter -- junior executive, Arthur Murray graduate, lover
'm Mrs
MacDougall -- Margie to you
Bud has taken the key out of his pocket, opened the door to his apartment
This way, Mrs
MacDougall
He ushers her in
- It is exactly the way we left it
There is no sign of Fran, except for the gloves she dropped on the coffee table earlier
Bud switches on the light, shuts the door
(looking around) Say, this is Snugsville
(helping her out of her coat) Mrs
MacDougall,  think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot
(a gleam) No kidding
Ask anybody around here
As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and  may go just like that -- (snaps his fingers) --  have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center
(shuddering deliciously) Gee
Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it
Well, they haven't got me yet, baby
Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise
'm with you, lover
She takes the bowl of melted ice Bud has handed her, disappears into the kitchen
As Bud starts to remove his coat, he becomes aware of a scratching noise from the phonograph
He crosses to it, sees that the needle is stuck in the last groove of a long-playing record
Bud lifts the record off, examines it curiously, then puts it aside and substitutes the cha cha record
As the music starts, he dances over to the coat-rack beside the door, hangs up his chesterfield and bowler
He turns back into the room, still dancing, suddenly spots Fran's gloves on the coffee table
He picks up the gloves, looks around for some convenient place to get rid of them
Moving over to the bedroom door, he opens it, tosses the gloves toward the bed inside
He shuts the door, starts to turn away, freezes in a delayed reaction to something he saw inside
He quickly opens the door again, looks
Sprawled across the bed, on top of the bedspread, is Fran
The light from the bathroom falls across her
She is fully dressed, still in her coat, and apparently asleep
Bud steps into the bedroom, closing the door behind him, walks over to Fran
All right, Miss Kubelik -- get up
It's past checking-out time, and the hotel management would appreciate it if you would get the hell out of here
(Fran doesn't stir) Look, Miss Kubelik,  used to like you --  used to like you a lot -- but it's all over between us -- so beat it -- -- -- out
(no reaction; he puts a hand on her shoulder, shakes her) Come on -- wake up
She doesn't respond
But something falls out of her hand, rolls across the bed
Bud picks it up, looks at it -- it is his sleeping-pill vial, now uncapped and empty
(a hoarse whisper) Oh, my God
For a second he is paralyzed
Then he drops the vial, grabs Fran, lifts her into a sitting position on the bed, shakes her violently
Miss Kubelik
Miss Kubelik
Fran's head droops to one side, like a rag doll's
Bud lets go of her, rushes out
In the living room, the phonograph is still cha cha-ing away
Bud dashes to the phone, picks it up
Then it occurs to him that he doesn't know whom to call and he hangs up
Out of the kitchen comes Margie, with a bowlful of ice cubes
broke a nail trying to get the ice-tray out
You ought to buy yourself a new refrigerator
Bud, not listening, runs past her to the hall door and out
(calling after him) didn't mean right now
- Bud arrives at the door of the Dreyfuss apartment, starts ringing the doorbell and pounding with his fist
Dr
Dreyfuss
Hey, Doc
The door opens, and Dr
Dreyfuss stands there sleepily, pulling on his beaten bathrobe
(words tumbling over each other) There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick --  can't wake her up
Let me get my bag
He disappears from the doorway
Hurry up, Doc
Bud turns and runs back into his apartment
- Margie has settled herself comfortably on the couch, and is fixing the drinks
The cha cha music is still going
Bud comes flying in, heads for the bedroom
Hey -- over here, lover
Bud stops in his tracks, suddenly aware of her
What's all this running around
You're going to wear yourself out
Bud strides over to her purposefully, yanks her up to her feet
Not so rough, honey
(taking the glass out of her hand) Good night
Good night
(thrusting the fur coat at her) The party's over
What's the matter
Did  do something wrong
(easing her toward door) It's an emergency -- see you some other time
Dr
Dreyfuss comes hurrying in, carrying his medical bag
He stops, bewildered by the sound of music and the sight of a wide-awake girl in the apartment
Not this one -- (pointing to the bedroom) -- in there, Doc
Dr
Dreyfuss proceeds into the bedroom
Say, what's going on here, anyway
Nothing
(propelling her toward the door) Just clear out, will you
(pointing back) My shoes
Bud reaches under the coffee table, where she left her shoes, retrieves them
(bitterly) Some lover you are
Some sexpot
Bud shoves the shoes at her, takes a bill out of his wallet, hands it to her
Here -- find yourself a phone booth and call your husband in Havana
You bet  will
And when  tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in
(he shoves her through the open door) You fink
Bud slams the door shut, starts toward the bedroom
Halfway there, he becomes aware that the cha cha record is still on
He detours to the phonograph, switches it off, continues into the bedroom
In the bedroom, the overhead light is on, and Dr
Dreyfuss is working on the unconscious Fran
He has removed her coat, and is shining a flashlight into her eyes, examining her pupils
Bud approaches the bed worriedly
She going to be all right, Doc
How many pills were in that bottle
It was half-full -- about a dozen or so
You going to have to take her to the hospital
Dr
Dreyfuss ignores him
Out of his medical bag, he takes a stomach tube with a rubber funnel at the end
Then he starts to lift Fran off the bed
Help me, will you
Between them, they get Fran into an upright position
Into the bathroom
They half-carry, half-drag Fran's limp form toward the bathroom
What are you going to do, Doc
Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late
You better put some coffee on -- and pray
Bud starts away as Dr
Dreyfuss takes Fran into the bathroom
Bud loses no time getting into the kitchen
He fills an aluminum kettle with water, strikes a match, lights the gas burner, puts the kettle on
Then he takes a jar of instant coffee and a chipped coffee mug out of the cupboard, shakes an excessive portion of coffee into the mug, sticks a spoon in it
He watches the kettle for a moment, mops his brow with a handkerchief, then starts back toward the bedroom
Bud crosses the bedroom to the half-open door of the bathroom, looks in anxiously
From inside come the sounds of a coughing spasm and running water
Bud turns away, undoes his tie and collar, paces the bedroom floor
Something on the night table attracts his attention -- resting against the base of the lamp is a sealed envelope
Bud picks it up -- on it, in Fran's handwriting, is one word,
He turns the letter over in his hand, trying to decide what to do with it
Dr
Dreyfuss emerges from the bathroom, carrying a pale, still unconscious Fran
Bud quickly conceals the suicide note behind his back
Bring my bag
He lugs Fran into the living room
Bud stashes the letter in his back pocket, picks up the medical bag, follows them
In the living room, Dr
Dreyfuss lowers Fran into a chair
Her chin falls to her chest
Dreyfuss takes the bag from Bud, fishes out a hypodermic syringe, draws 2 c
c
's from a bottle of picrotoxin
Roll up her right sleeve
Bud does so
Dr
Dreyfuss hands the hypodermic to Bud, searches for a spot for the injection
Nice veins
He swabs the spot with alcohol, takes the hypodermic back from Bud
Want to tell me what happened
don't know --  mean --  wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel -- (making off-scene injection) So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame
Something like that
You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie-pie -- yes, you are
Bud just stands there, taking it
Fran stirs slightly, and from her parched lips comes a low moan
Dr
Dreyfuss grabs her by the hair, lifts her head up
If you'd come home half an hour later, you would have had quite a Christmas present
With his free hand, Dr
Dreyfuss slaps Fran viciously across the face
Bud winces
Dreyfuss, still holding Fran by the hair, takes a box of ammonia ampules out of his bag
He crushes one of the ampules in his hand, passes it under her nose
Fran tries to turn her head away
Dreyfuss slaps her again, hard, crushes another ampule, repeats the process
Bud is watching tensely
From the kitchen comes the whistle of the boiling kettle, but Bud pays no attention
Get the coffee
Bud hurries into the kitchen
He turns off the gas, pours the boiling water into the mug with the instant coffee, stirs it
From off, come the sounds of more slapping and some moaning
Bud carries the coffee out
In the living room, Dr
Dreyfuss is working another ammonia ampule under Fran's nose
Her eyes start fluttering
Dreyfuss takes the coffee mug from Bud, forces it between Fran's lips, pours coffee into her mouth
Fran resists instinctively, half the coffee dribbling over her chin and dress, but Dr
Dreyfuss keeps at it
Let's get some air in here
Open the windows
Bud complies promptly -- pulls up the shades, opens the windows wide
(putting the empty mug down) What's her name
Miss Kubelik -- Fran
(to Fran, slowly) Fran, 'm a doctor
'm here because you took too many sleeping pills
Do you understand what 'm saying
(Fran mutters something) Fran, 'm Dr
Dreyfuss -- 'm here to help you
You took all those sleeping pills -- remember
(mumbling groggily) Sleeping pills
That's right, Fran
And 'm a doctor
Doctor
Dr
Dreyfuss
Dreyfuss
(to Bud) Get more coffee
Bud picks up the mug, leaves
(to Fran) Tell me again -- what's my name
Dr
Dreyfuss
And what happened to you
took sleeping pills
Do you know where you are, Fran
(looking around blankly) No
Yes, you do
Now concentrate
don't know
Bud is coming back with the coffee
(pointing to Bud) Do you know who this is
(Fran tries to focus) Look at him
Mr
Baxter -- nineteenth floor
Hello, Miss Kubelik
(to Bud) Mister -- Miss -- such politeness
(to Dr
Dreyfuss, discreetly) Well -- we work in the same building -- and we try to keep it quiet -- (to Bud, puzzled) What are you doing here
Bud throws Dr
Dreyfuss a look, as if to say that Fran's mind still wasn't functioning properly
(to Fran) Don't you remember
We were at the office party together -- Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen -- That's right
(to Dr
Dreyfuss; improvising rapidly) told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw -- (still trying to figure out Bud's presence) don't understand -- It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that  got here in time -- and you're going to be all right -- (to Dr
Dreyfuss) -- isn't she, Doc
(closing her eyes) 'm so tired -- Here -- drink this
He forces her to swallow some coffee
(pushing the mug away) Please -- just let me sleep
You can't sleep
(shaking her) Come on, Fran -- open your eyes
(to Bud) Let's get her walking
We've got to keep her awake for the next couple of hours
They lift her from the chair, and each draping one of her arms over his shoulder, they start to walk her up and down the room
(urging Fran on) Now walk, Fran
One, two, three, four -- one, two, three, four -- that's the idea -- left, right, left, right -- now we turn -- one, two, three, four -- At first, Fran's feet just drag along the floor between them
But gradually, as Dr
Dreyfuss' voice continues droning hypnotically, she falls into the rhythm of it, repeating the words after him and putting her weight on her feet
Left, right, left, right -- walk, walk, walk -- one, two, three, four -- turn -- left, right, left, right -- now you got it -- : - Through the bedroom window comes the first faint light of dawn
Fran has been put to bed by an exhausted Dr
Dreyfuss
She is in her slip, and Dreyfuss is just drawing the blanket over her
Her eyes are closed, and she is moaning fitfully
Watching from the doorway is Bud, in shirtsleeves now, weary and disheveled
She'll sleep on and off for the next twenty-four hours
Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up -- Just as long as she's okay
(massaging his calves) These cases are harder on the doctor than on the patient
ought to charge you by the mile
They have now moved out into the living room, where the overhead light and the Christmas tree bulbs are still on
Any of that coffee left
Sure
He goes into the kitchen
Dr
Dreyfuss takes a small notebook with a fountain pen clipped to it out of his bag, sinks down on the couch
How do you spell her last name
(from kitchen) Kubelik -- with two k's
What's her address
(no answer from Bud) Where does she live
Bud appears from the kitchen, stirring the coffee powder in a cup of hot water
(apprehensive) Why do you want to know, Doc
You don't have to report this, do you
It's regulations
(setting the coffee down) She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, 'm not thinking about myself -- (sipping the hot coffee) Aren't you
It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor -- (a long look at Bud) Well, as a doctor,  guess  can't prove it wasn't an accident
(closes notebook) But as your neighbor, 'd like to kick your keester clear around the block
(indicating coffee) Mind if  cool this off
He uncaps the bottle of Scotch, pours a large slug into his coffee
Help yourself
(taking a big gulp of the spiked coffee) don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on
Live now, pay later
Diner's Club
(another swig) Why don't you grow up, Baxter
Be a mensch
You know what that means
'm not sure
mansch -- a human being
So you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky -- Yeah, wasn't
(finishing coffee) But you're not out of the woods yet, Baxter -- because most of them try it again
(picks up bag, starts toward door) You know where  am if you need me
He walks out, closing the door after him
Bud dejectedly turns off the overhead light, kicks out the plug of the Christmas tree lights, trudges into the bedroom
Fran is fast asleep
Bud picks up her dress, gets a hanger, drapes the dress over it, hangs it from the door
An early morning chill has invaded the room, and Bud switches an the electric blanket to keep Fran warm
Then he slumps into a chair beside the bed, looks at Fran compassionately
The light on the dial of the electric blanket glows in the grayish room
Bud just sits there, watching Fran
: : -   - Mrs
Lieberman, followed by her dog, is climbing the stairs to Bud's apartment, puffing asthmatically
She seems quite angry as she arrives at the door and rings the bell
There is no answer
She starts knocking impatiently
Mr
Baxter
Open up already
Finally the door opens a crack, and Bud peers out
He looks like a man who has slept in his clothes -- rumpled, bleary- eyed, unshaven
Oh -- Mrs
Lieberman
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle
What was going on here last night
Last night
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe
'm sorry, Mrs
Lieberman -- and 'll never invite those people again
What you get from renting to bachelors
All night  didn't sleep ten minutes -- and 'm sure you woke up Dr
Dreyfuss
Don't worry about Dr
Dreyfuss -- happen to know he was out on a case
'm warning you, Mr
Baxter -- this is a respectable house, not a honky-tonky
(to the dog) Come on, Oscar
Bud watches her start down the stairs with the dog, withdraws into the apartment
- Bud closes the door, crosses toward the bedroom, looks inside
Fran is asleep under the electric blanket, breathing evenly
He tries to shut the bedroom door, but it won't close completely because Fran's dress, on a hanger
is hooked over the top
He goes to the phone, picks it up, dials the operator
(his voice low) Operator,  want White Plains, New York -- Mr
Sheldrake -- (an added thought) -- make it person to person
-   - The decor is split-level Early American
There is a huge Christmas tree and a jumble of presents, open gift boxes, and discarded wrappings
Sheldrake and his two sons,  and
, are squatting on the floor, testing a Cape Canaveral set the kids got for Christmas
Sheldrake is in a brand new dressing gown, with a manufacturer's tag still dangling from it, and the boys are in pajamas and astronaut's helmets
As for the Cape Canaveral set, it is a miniature layout of block-houses, launching pads, and assorted space-missiles
Tommy has his finger on the button controlling one of the rockets
(counting down) 7-6-5-4-3-2-1 -- let her rip
Tommy presses the button, and a spring sends the rocket toward the ceiling
Just then, the phone in the entrance hall starts ringing
'll get it
He hurries to the phone
Hey, Dad -- why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive
It's a thought
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit
See if they'll what
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies
Oh -- oh
(coming back from the phone) It's for you, Dad
Mr
Baxter
(getting up) Baxter
Person to person
Sheldrake heads quickly for the phone
(to Jeff Jr
) Come on -- help me round up some flies
In the entrance hall, Sheldrake picks up the phone, turns his back toward the living room, speaks in a low voice
Hello
-- yes -- what's on your mind, Baxter
- hate to disturb you, but something came up -- it's rather important -- and  think it would be a good idea if you could see me -- at the apartment -- as soon as possible
- You're not making sense, Baxter
What's this all about
- didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who  mean --  found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills
- What
From the stairway beyond him comes: ' What is it, Jeff
Who's on the phone
Sheldrake turns from the phone
Halfway down the stairs is Mrs
Sheldrake, in a quilted house-robe
(a nice recovery) One of our employees had an accident --  don't know why they bother me with these things on Christmas Day
(into phone) Yes, Baxter -- just how serious is it
Out of the corner of his eye, he watches Mrs
Sheldrake come down the stairs, pass behind him on the way to the living room
- Well, it was touch and go there for a while -- but she's sleeping it off now
He glances through the half-open door toward the sleeping Fran
thought maybe you'd like to be here when she wakes up
- That's impossible
(an apprehensive look toward the living room) You'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact, 'm counting on you -- - (into phone) Yes, sir --  understand
(taking Fran's letter out of his pocket) She left a note -- you want me to open it and read it to you
(a beat) Well, it was just a suggestion -- no, you don't have to worry about that, Mr
Sheldrake --  kept your name out of it so there'll be no trouble, police-wise or newspaper- wise -- As Bud continues talking on the phone, Fran, in the bedroom, opens her eyes, looks around vaguely, trying to figure out where she is
She sits up in bed, winces, holds her head in her hands -- she has a fierce hangover
(into phone) -- you see, the doctor, he's a friend of mine -- we were very lucky in that respect -- actually, he thinks she's my girl -- no, he just jumped to the conclusion -- around here, 'm known as quite a ladies' man -- In the bedroom Fran, becoming aware of Bud's voice, crawls out of bed and holding on to the furniture, moves unsteadily toward the living room door
(into phone) -- of course, we're not out of the woods yet -- sometimes they try it again -- yes sir, 'll do my best -- it looks like it'll be a couple of days before she's fully recovered, and  may have a little problem with the landlady -- Behind him, Fran appears in the bedroom doorway, barefooted and in her slip
She leans groggily against the door post, trying to focus on Bud and to concentrate on what he's saying
(into phone) -- all right, Mr
Sheldrake, 'll keep her in my apartment as long as can -- any sort of message you want me to give her
-- well, 'll think of something -- goodbye, Mr
Sheldrake
He hangs up the phone slowly
(weakly) 'm sorry
Bud turns around, sees her standing there on rubbery legs
'm sorry, Mr
Baxter
Miss Kubelik -- (hurries toward her) -- you shouldn't be out of bed
didn't know --  had no idea this was your apartment -- (putting his arm around her) Let me help you
He leads her back into the bedroom
'm so ashamed
Why didn't you just let me die
What kind of talk is that
(he lowers her onto the bed) So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now
(a groan) My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum
What time is it
Two o'clock
(struggling to her feet) Where's my dress
have to go home
Her knees buckle
Bud catches her
You're in no condition to go anywhere -- except back to bed
You don't want me here -- Sure  do
It's always nice to have company for Christmas
He tries to put her back to bed
Fran resists
Miss Kubelik, 'm stronger than you are -- just want to go brush my teeth -- Oh -- of course
think there's a new toothbrush somewhere
He crosses to the bathroom, takes a plaid robe off the hook on the back of the door, hands it to Fran
Here -- put this on
In the bathroom, he finds an unused toothbrush in a plastic container
His eyes fall on his safety razor
With a glance toward the bedroom, he unscrews the razor, removes the blade, drops it in his shirt pocket
Then he empties the blades from the dispenser, puts those in his pocket
Now he notices a bottle of iodine on the medicine shelf, stashes that in another pocket, just as Fran appears in the doorway wearing the robe
(handing her the toothbrush) Here
How about some breakfast
No --  don't want anything
'll fix you some coffee
He crosses the bedroom, heading for the kitchen, stops
Oh -- we're all out of coffee -- you had quite a lot of it last night -- He thinks for a moment, hurries toward the hall door
- Bud comes out of his apartment, leaving the door half open, heads for the Dreyfuss apartment
He rings the bell, peers down over the banister to make sure Mrs
Lieberman isn't snooping around
Mrs
Dreyfuss opens the door
Mrs
Dreyfuss, can  borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs
(contemptuously) Eggs he asks me for
Oranges
What you need is a good horse-whipping
Ma'am
From me the doctor has no secrets
Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that
didn't really do anything -- honest --  mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise
Big shot
For you,  wouldn't lift a finger -- but for her, 'll fix a little something to eat
She slams the door in his face, Bud starts back to his apartment
- Fran enters shakily from the bedroom, looks around for the phone, locates it, picks it up
As she starts dialing, Bud comes in from the hall
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me
(alarmed) Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first
(hurries up to her, takes the receiver away) Just what are you going to tell her
Well,  haven't figured it out, exactly
You better figure it out -- exactly
Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night
'll tell her  spent the night with a friend
Who
Someone from the office
And where are you now
In his apartment
His apartment
mean -- her apartment
What's your friend's name
Baxter
What's her first name
Miss
(she is impressed with her own cleverness) When are you coming home
As soon as  can walk
Something wrong with your legs
No -- it's my stomach
Your stomach
They had to pump it out
(hanging up the phone) Miss Kubelik,  don't think you ought to call anybody -- not till that chewing gum is out of your head
(leads her into bedroom) But they'll be worried about me -- my brother-in-law may be calling the police -- That's why we have to be careful -- we don't want to involve anybody -- after all, Mr
Sheldrake is a married man -- Thanks for reminding me
She pulls away from him, starts to get into bed
(contritely) didn't mean it that way --  was just talking to him on the phone -- he's very concerned about you
He doesn't give a damn about me
Oh, you're wrong
He told me -- He's a liar
But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is --  still love him
The doorbell rings
Must be Mrs
Dreyfuss -- (starts into living room) -- remember the doctor -- from last night -- that's his wife
He opens the hall door
Mrs
Dreyfuss brushes past him with a tray full of food
So where is the victim
(Bud indicates the bedroom) Max the Knife
She sweeps into the bedroom, Bud tagging along
(to Fran) Nu, little lady, how are we feeling today
don't know -- kind of dizzy
Here
The best thing for dizzy is a little noodle soup with chicken -- white meat -- and a glass tea
She sets the tray down on Fran's lap
Thank you
'm really not hungry
Go ahead
Eat
Enjoy
She hands her the soup spoon, turns to Bud
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you
Well,  have some paper towels -- Beatnik
Go to my kitchen -- third drawer, under the good silver, there is napkins
Yes, Mrs
Dreyfuss
He starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two
Fran is just sitting there, the spoon in her hand, not touching the soup
So what are you waiting for -- a singing commercial
can't eat
Mrs
Dreyfuss takes the spoon from her, starts to feed her
You must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him
Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer
Turns out he is King Farouk
Mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins
girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup
Who needs it
You listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom
-- for some Good Time Charlie
(sees Bud approaching with napkin) Sssh
(gaily) One napkin, coming up
(hands it to Fran) wish we had some champagne to wrap it around
(to Fran) What did  tell you
(uncomfortable) Look, Mrs
Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait around
'll wash the dishes and -- You wash 'em, you break 'em
'll come back for them later
(to Fran) If he makes trouble, give me a yell
She exits
She doesn't seem to like you very much
Oh,  don't mind
As a matter of fact, 'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me
(glancing at night table) Oh
Did you find something here -- an envelope --
Yes, 've got it
(takes envelope out of back pocket) Don't you think we'd better destroy it
So it won't fall into the wrong hands --
Open it
Bud tears open the envelope, takes out Sheldrake's hundred dollars
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill
That's right
Will you see that Mr
Sheldrake gets it
(shrugging) Sure
He puts the money in his pocket
(holding out tray) Here -- take this, will you
Bud relieves her of the tray, sets it down
You want me to move the television set in here
(Fran shakes her head) You play gin rummy
'm not very good at it
am
Let me get the cards
You don't have to entertain me
Bud opens the bureau drawer, takes out a deck of cards, a score pad, and a pencil
Nothing 'd like better -- you know togetherness
Guess what  did last Christmas
Had an early dinner at the automat, then went to the zoo, then  came home and cleaned up after Mr
Eichelberger -- he had a little eggnog party here
'm way ahead this year
He pulls a chair up to the bed, starts to shuffle the cards
Three across, spades double, high deals
(they cut) Eight -- ten
(he starts to deal) (pensively) think 'm going to give it all up
Give what up
Why do people have to love people, anyway
Yeah --  know what you mean
(flips over down card) Queen
don't want it
Pick a card
She does, and they start playing
What do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents
bad insurance risk
(nodding) That's me with men
've been jinxed from the word go -- first time  was ever kissed was in a cemetery
cemetery
was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke
His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette
Gin
He spreads his hand
Fran lays her cards down, and Bud adds them up
Thirty-six and twenty-five -- that's sixty-one and two boxes
(enters score on pad) just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time
(shuffling) How many guys were there
(holding up four fingers) Three
The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965
(pushing the deck toward her) Cut
(she does, and he starts dealing) So  came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab
They sent me to secretarial school, and  applied for a job with Consolidated - but flunked the typing test -- Too slow
Oh
can type up a storm, but can't spell
So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how  met Jeff -- (her eyes mist up, and she puts her cards down) Oh, God, 'm so fouled up
What am going to do now
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz
Was he really upset when you told him
Mr
Sheldrake
Oh, yes
Very
Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife
'm sure that's the explanation
You really think so
No doubt about it
(a thoughtful beat, then) Can  have that pad and the pencil
(handing her score pad and pencil) What for
'm going to write a letter to Mrs
Sheldrake
You are
As one woman to another -- 'm sure she'll understand -- Miss Kubelik,  don't think that's such a good idea
He gently takes the pad and pencil away from her
Why not
Well, for one thing, you can't spell
And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself
(fighting back tears) don't like myself very much anyway
Pick up your cards and let's go
Do  have to
You bet
got a terrific hand
Fran, her eyes drooping sleepily, picks up her cards, makes a discard
You sure you want to throw that card
Sure
Gin
He removes the cards from her hand, starts to add them up
Fifty-two and twenty-five -- that's seventy-seven -- spades is double -- a hundred and fifty-four -- and four boxes -- you're blitzed in two games
He enters the score on the pad
As he starts to shuffle again, he notices that Fran has slid down on the pillow, and that her eyes are closed -- she is asleep
Bud rises, adjusts the blanket over her
He stands there looking at her for a moment, runs his hand over his chin
Realizing he needs a shave, he crosses to the bathroom
In the bathroom, Bud washes his face, squirts some shaving cream into his hand, starts to apply it
- Volkswagen draws up to the curb in front of the house
Kirkeby gets out on the street side, Sylvia squeezes herself out through the other door
Kirkeby raises the front hood of the Volkswagen, reaches into the luggage compartment, takes out a cardboard bucket with a bottle of champagne on ice
Together, he and Sylvia start up the steps of the house, Sylvia already cha cha-ing in anticipation
- In the bathroom, Bud has just finished lathering his face when the doorbell rings
He starts into the bedroom
(muttering to himself) All right -- all right, Mrs
Dreyfuss
He glances at the sleeping Fran, picks up the tray, carries it into the living room, pulling the bedroom door closed behind him
But it doesn't shut completely, because of Fran's dress hooked over the top
Bud crosses to the hall door, opens it
Outside are Kirkeby, with the champagne bucket, and Sylvia
Hi, Baxter
(blocking the door) What do you want
What do  --
(to Sylvia) Just a minute
He pushes his way into the apartment past Bud
You can't come in
(closing the door behind him) What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy
made a reservation for four o'clock, remember
He heads for the coffee table, sets the champagne down
Bud shoots a quick glance toward the bedroom door, gets rid of the tray
Look, you can't stay here
Just take your champagne and go
Baxter,  don't want to pull rank on you -- but  told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me
Are you going to leave, Mr
Kirkeby, or do  have to throw you out
As Bud spins him around, Kirkeby notices the dress on the bedroom door
Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so
(indicating dress) You got yourself a little playmate, huh
Now will you get out
- Outside the door of Bud's apartment, Sylvia is cha cha-ing impatiently
Up the stairs comes Dr
Dreyfuss, in his overcoat and carrying his medical bag
(knocking on the door) Hey, come on, what are we waiting for
Open up, will you
She continues cha-cha-ing
Dr
Dreyfuss has unlocked the door to his apartment, and is watching Sylvia, appalled by the fact that Baxter seems to be at it again
He starts inside
(calling) Mildred --
He shuts the door behind him
(knocking on Baxter's door) What's holding things up
- Kirkeby looks toward the door in response to Sylvia's knocking
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us
No
He forces Kirkeby toward the hall door
Kirkeby, glancing past him through the partly-open door of the bedroom, catches sight of Fran asleep in bed
(grinning smugly) Well,  don't blame you
So you hit the jackpot, eh kid --  mean, Kubelik-wise
(Bud opens the door, gestures him out) Don't worry
won't say a word to anybody
- Kirkeby comes backing out the door of Bud's apartment, minus the champagne bucket
Stay with it, Buddy-boy
(Bud shuts the door on him) Come on, Sylvia
What gives
little mixup in signals
Let's go
Go where
(leading her toward stairs) What's your mother doing this afternoon
She's home -- stuffing a turkey
Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur
That's fine
But what are we going to do about grandma and Uncle Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two nieces -- - Bud comes into the bedroom
As he heads for the bathroom, Fran stirs slightly, opens her eyes
Who was that
Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne
Like some
(shaking her head) Would you mind opening the window
She turns off the electric blanket as Bud crosses to the window, pushes it up
Then a thought strikes him, and he looks at Fran suspiciously
Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik
just want some fresh air
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse
(approaching the bed) Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish
Who'd care
would
(sleepily) Why can't  ever fall in love with somebody nice like you
(ruefully) Yeah
Well -- that's the way it crumbles, cookie-wise
Go to sleep
Fran closes her eyes
Bud returns to the bathroom, picks up his razor, starts to shave
But something seems to be wrong with the razor -- and unscrewing it, he realizes that there is no blade
Sheepishly, he takes out the blade he hid in his shirt pocket, inserts it in his razor, screws it shut
Then he resumes shaving
: : '  - It is the morning after Christmas, and Miss Olsen and the other girls are just settling down to work
Sheldrake, in hat and coat, approaches from the elevators, comes through the glass doors
(ad lib) Good morning, Mr
Sheldrake
(ignoring them) Miss Olsen, will you come into my office, please
He strides into the inner office
Miss Olsen picks up her stenographic pad, follows him in
'  - Sheldrake is removing his hat and coat as Miss Olsen comes in, shuts the door behind her
Did you have a nice Christmas
Lovely
You were a big help
Me
Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party
(dropping her business-like mask) 'm sorry, Jeff
You know  could never hold my liquor -- But  thought you could hold your tongue
It won't happen again
You bet it won't
'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay -- (she looks at him, uncomprehending) That's right, Miss Olsen
'm letting you go
(quietly) You let me go four years ago, Jeff
Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by
'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can
(formal again) Yes, Mr
Sheldrake
She turns and walks out of the office, shutting the door
Sheldrake looks after her for a moment, then goes to his desk, picks up the phone, dials the operator
(into phone) This is Mr
Sheldrake
'd like Mr
Baxter's home telephone number -- that's
Baxter, in Ordinary Premium Accounting -- '  - Miss Olsen has put on her coat, and is going through her desk drawers, cleaning out her personal belongings -- nail polish, emery boards, an extra pair of glasses, etc
As she stows them away in her handbag, one of the buttons on the telephone lights up
Miss Olsen hesitates for a second, then with a quick look around, she pushes the button down, carefully picks up the receiver, listens in
'  - Sheldrake is dialing the last two digits of a telephone number
After a moment, someone answers
Hello, Baxter
Jeff Sheldrake
Can you talk
- Bud, wearing slacks, a shirt open at the neck, and a cardigan sweater, is at the phone
pillow and a blanket on the living room couch indicate where he spent the night
(looking off) Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering
- Good
Is there anything you need -- money --
- No, thank you, Mr
Sheldrake
As a matter of fact, 've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars -- - Oh
(a beat) Well, if there's anything  can do for you -- - For me
don't think so
But  was hoping maybe you could do something for her -- - Like what
Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can  help her -- my hands are tied -- - Fran now appears in the bedroom, wearing the plaid robe, and toweling her damp hair
(into phone) Well, at least you can talk to her -- let me put her on -- and please be gentle -- He puts the receiver down, crosses toward the bedroom door
There's a call for you -- (approaching) For me
-- Mr
Sheldrake
don't want to talk to him
think you should
have to run down to the grocery anyway -- all that's left around here is one frozen pizza -- (takes raincoat and old hat from hanger) 'll be right back -- okay
Fran nods, watches him go out
Then she glances toward the phone, which is off the hook
Reluctantly she advances toward it, picks it up
(into phone) Hello, Jeff
(a long beat) Yes, 'm all right
- Fran, why did you do it
It's so childish -- and it never solves anything --  ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran
(no answer) Fran -- ' Miss Olsen, glued to the phone, is listening intently
- Are you there, Fran
- Of course 'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- never took those pills --  never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it
- There you go again -- you know didn't mean it that way, Fran
Just get well -- do what the nurse tells you --  mean Baxter -- and 'll see you as soon as  can
Bye, Fran
(he hangs up) '  - Miss Olsen hangs up the phone, sits there for a moment, weighing what she has overheard
Then she makes a decision, picks up the phone again, dials a number
As she waits for an answer, she glances toward Sheldrake's office
(into phone) Hello, Mrs
Sheldrake
This is Miss Olsen -- fine, thank you -- Mrs
Sheldrake,  was wondering if we could have lunch together
-- well, don't know how important it is, but  think you might find it educational -- it concerns your husband -- all right, one o'clock, at Longchamp's, Madison and 59th
She looks up as the door to the inner office opens and Sheldrake comes out
He stops when he sees that Miss Olsen is still there
(hanging up phone) Don't worry, 'm on my way
(she rises) was just making a personal call
She opens her handbag, takes out a coin, puts it down on the desk
Here's a dime
She marches out through the glass doors toward the elevators as Sheldrake stands there, watching her
: - Bud comes down the street, carrying a large brown paper bag overflowing with groceries
He goes up the steps of the house and through the front door
- As Bud starts up the stairs, with the groceries, Mrs
Lieberman comes hurrying down toward him
(breathlessly) Oh, Mr
Baxter -- 'm glad you're here --  was just going to get the passkey
What for
thought  smelled gas coming from your apartment
Gas
He races up the stairs two at a time, fumbling frantically for his key
Reaching the door of his apartment, he unlocks it, dashes in
- Bud comes bursting through the door
The living room is empty, and the bedclothes have been removed from the couch
(calling) Miss Kubelik
He dumps the bag of groceries on a table, rushes into the kitchen
The burner has been turned on under the kettle, but there is no flame, and gas is hissing from the vents
Bud snaps it off, starts out again
Miss Kubelik
Meanwhile Fran has appeared from the bathroom, and is approaching the bedroom door
She is still in her robe, and is holding a double sock-stretcher with one of Bud's socks on it
Bud, rounding the corner from the kitchen at full speed, collides with Fran in the bedroom doorway
He grabs her arms with obvious relief
Are you all right
Sure
(sniffs) What's that funny smell
Gas
(indicating kitchen) Didn't you turn it on
Yes
was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress
(accusingly) You turned it on -- but you didn't light it
Are you supposed to
In this house, you're supposed to
Oh
Bud starts to take off his hat and coat, notices the sock- stretcher in her hand
What are you doing with that
was washing my stockings, so decided  might as well do your socks
Thank you
It's very curious --  could only find three and a half pair
Well, things are a little disorganized around here
He carries the bag of groceries into the kitchen, Fran trailing after him
During the following, he removes the contents of the bag -- bread, eggs, bacon, spaghetti, ground round, frankfurters, and assorted canned goods -- sets them out on the drainboard
'd say
What's a tennis racquet doing in the kitchen
She produces the racquet from behind the stove
Tennis racquet
Oh,  remember -- was cooking myself an Italian dinner
(Fran looks at him oddly) used it to strain the spaghetti
(thinking it over) Why not
As a matter of fact, 'm a pretty good cook -- but 'm a lousy housekeeper
Yes, you are, (indicating the living room) When  was straightening up the couch, you know what  found
Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club
(shrugging) It's just that 'm the kind of guy who can't say no --  don't mean to girls --  mean -- You mean to someone like Mr
Sheldrake
guess so
know so
He's a taker
what
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it
wouldn't say that -- (trying to change the subject) What would you like to have for diner
There's onion soup and canned asparagus -- really ought to be getting home
My family will be flipping by now
She starts into the living room
Bud follows her
You can't leave yet
The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system
(wistfully) wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system
If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that -- She sits on the arm of a chair
know how you feel, Miss Kubelik
You think it's the end of the world -- but it's not, really went through exactly the same thing myself
You did
Well, maybe not exactly --  tried to do it with a gun
Over a girl
Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and  was mad for her
But  knew it was hopeless -- so  decided to end it all
went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati
No,  don't
Anyway,  parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy --  mean, how do you do it
-- here, or here, or here -- (with cocked finger, he points to his temple, mouth and chest) -- you know where  finally shot myself
Where
(indicating kneecap) Here
In the knee
Uh-huh
While  was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because was illegally parked -- so started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off -- pow
(laughing) That's terrible
Yeah
Took me a year before  could bend my knee -- but  got over the girl in three weeks
She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas
(suddenly suspicious) Are you just making that up to make me feel better
Of course not
Here's the fruit cake
(shows it to her under Christmas tree) And you want to see my knee
(starts to raise pant-leg) No, thanks
The fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how found out
So let 'em
Look, 'm going to cook dinner for us
We'll have the fruit cake for dessert
You just sit there and rest
You've done enough for one day
(smiling) Yes, nurse
Bud starts happily into the kitchen
: - It is mid-afternoon, and traffic is light
Yellow Cab has pulled up in front of the entrance, and the driver, a stockily-built young man in a leather jacket and cap, gets out and comes through the revolving doors into the lobby
His name is  , and he is Fran's brother-in-law
As he cases the elevators, the starter comes up to him
Can  help you
'm looking for one of the elevator girls -- Miss Kubelik
So am
She didn't report this morning
She didn't
Where can  get some information -- who's in charge here
That comes under General Office Administration
See Mr
Dobisch, twenty-first floor
Thanks
He steps into an elevator, the doors of which are just closing
'  - Dobisch is sitting behind his desk, lighting a cigar
Kirkeby, who has dropped in for a little visit, is perched on the edge of the desk
-- so yesterday afternoon  take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom
Who
Kubelik
No kidding
Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot
Toot
It's more like a lost weekend
Neither of them showed up for work today
What gripes me is the two of them were guzzling my champagne while Sylvia and  wound up at the Guggenheim Museum
The glass door opens and Matuschka comes in
Mr
Dobisch
Yeah
My name is Karl Matuschka -- my sister-in-law, she runs one of the elevators here -- Fran Kubelik
(exchanging a glance with Dobisch) Miss Kubelik
You know her
Of course
There may be a lot of employees here -- but we're one big happy family
Well, she lives with us -- and my wife, she's getting a little nervous -- on account of Fran hasn't been home for two days
(another look at Dobisch) That so
Anyway, we was wondering if somebody in the office would know what happened to her
see
(to Kirkeby) What do you think, Al
Can we help the man
(after a pregnant pause) Why not
We don't owe Buddy-boy anything
Yeah
What's Buddy-boy done for us lately
(scowling) Who is Buddy-boy
: - Buddy-boy is bending over a hot stove, preparing an Italian dinner
He takes a saucepan of spaghetti off the fire, and picking up the tennis racquet with the other hand, pours the spaghetti on top of the racquet strings
Then he turns on the faucet, runs water over the spaghetti
With the combined technique of Brillat-Savarin and Pancho Gonzales, he gently agitates the racquet, letting the water drain off the spaghetti
As he works, he hums a theme from Tschaikowsky's Capriccio Italien
Fran walks in, still in her robe
Are we dressing for dinner
No -- just come as you are
(watching him) Say, you're pretty good with that racquet
You ought to see my backhand
(dumping spaghetti into platter) And wait till  serve the meatballs
(demonstrates) Shall  light the candles
It's a must -- gracious-living-wise
As Fran starts into the living room, Bud begins to ladle meat sauce onto the spaghetti, humming operatically
In the living room, the small table has been set for two, and prominent on it is the champagne bottle that Mr
Kirkeby left behind, still in its cardboard bucket, but freshly iced
As Fran lights the candles, she notices the napkins on the table, peels a price-tag off the corner of one of them
see you bought some napkins
Might as well go all the way
He carries the platter of spaghetti and meat sauce in from the kitchen, sets it on the table, sprinkles some cheese on it
Then he crosses to the coffee table, where a full martini pitcher stands in readiness, fills a couple of glasses
Fran seats herself at the table
You know,  used to live like Robinson Crusoe -- shipwrecked among eight million people
Then one day  saw a footprint in the sand -- and there you were -- (hands her martini) It's a wonderful thing -- dinner for two
You usually eat alone
Oh, no
Sometimes  have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night  had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then
(toasting) Cheers
Cheers
They drink
You know what we're going to do after dinner
The dishes
mean, after that
What
You don't have to if you don't want to -- don't
We're going to finish that gin game
Oh
So  want you to keep a clear head
The door bell rings
Carrying his martini glass, Bud crosses to the door, starts to open it
Because  don't want to take advantage of you -- the way  did yesterday in bed
By now the door is open, and Bud is speaking to Fran over his shoulder
He turns, finds himself face to face with Karl Matuschka, who is standing grimly in the doorway
Baxter
Yes
Matuschka shoves him roughly aside, strides past him toward Fran, who has risen to her feet
What's with you, Fran -- did you forget where you live
(to Bud) This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka
(friendly) How do you do, Mr
Matuschka
(pushing Bud away; to Fran) Okay, get your clothes on
got the cab downstairs
Now, wait a minute
know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- (shoving him away) It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady
All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes -- (grabbing him) Look, Buddy-boy -- if there wasn't a lady present, 'd clobber you
(separating them) All right, Karl -- 'll get dressed
She exits into the bedroom, removing her dress from the door, and closing it
Matuschka leans against the wall beside the hall door, eyeing Bud truculently
Bud raises a finger to remonstrate with him -- then breaks into a nervous, ingratiating smile
Care for a martini
Champagne
(Matuschka continues glaring at him) How about a little spaghetti with meat sauce
Made it myself
(Matuschka just scowls) Your sister-in-law sure is terrific -- (realizes his mistake; switching abruptly) Must be murder driving a cab in New York --  mean, with all that cross-town traffic -- He gestures with the martini glass, spilling the contents over his shirtfront
Through the partly open hall door, Dr
Dreyfuss sticks his head in
Hi, Baxter
He steps into the apartment, passing Matuschka without seeing him
How's the patient
(quickly) Oh, 'm fine, Doc
Not you -- Miss Kubelik
(stepping forward) What's the matter with Miss Kubelik
Oh, this is Mr
Matuschka -- he's Miss Kubelik's -- he's got a cab downstairs -- (to Dreyfuss) Fran been sick or something
Dr
Dreyfuss looks at Bud
No, no -- just had a little accident
(to Dreyfuss) What does he mean, accident
Well, these things happen all the time -- What things
(grabbing Dreyfuss) Say, what kind of doctor are you, anyway
(hastily) Oh, not that kind
He just gave her a shot and pumped her stomach out -- Behind them, the bedroom door has opened, and Fran comes out, wearing her coat over her dress
What for
(coming up) Because  took some sleeping pills
But 'm all right now -- so let's go
Why did you take sleeping pills
(promptly) On account of me
(whirling on him) You
Who else
Matuschka lashes out with a left to Bud's jaw, and while he is off balance, catches him with a right to the eye
Bud falls back against the Christmas tree, which topples with a crash
Fran pulls Matuschka away from him
Leave him alone, Karl
She kneels beside Bud
(tenderly) You fool -- you damn fool
Come on, Fran
Goodbye, Mr
Baxter
She kisses him on the cheek, rises, starts toward the door
Goodbye, doctor
She follows Matuschka out
Bud looks after her, starry-eyed
don't want to gloat, but just between us, you had that coming to you
(tilts Bud's chin up, examines his eye) Tch, tch, tch
Are you going to have a shiner tomorrow
Let me get my bag
(he starts out) (calling after him) Don't bother, Doc
It doesn't hurt a bit
He is on Cloud Nine
: : - Bud is coming from the elevators toward his office
He is wearing his chesterfield, bowler, and a pair of dark glasses
He opens the office door, starts in
'  - Bud crosses directly to the phone, removes his glasses revealing a swollen left eye
He dials a number
(into phone) Mr
Sheldrake's office
This is
Baxter
Would you please tell Mr
Sheldrake 'd like to come up and see him
It's rather important
Will you call me back, please
He hangs up, takes off his hat and coat, deposits them on the clothes- tree
Then he paces around the office, rehearsing a speech out loud
Mr
Sheldrake, 've got good news for you
All your troubles are over
'm going to take Miss Kubelik off your hands
(nods to himself with satisfaction) The plain fact is, Mr
Sheldrake, that  love her
haven't told her yet, but  thought you should be the first to know
After all, you don't really want her, and  do, and although it may sound presumptuous, she needs somebody like me
So  think it would be the thing all around -- (the phone rings and he picks it up) -- solution-wise
(into phone) Yes
'll be right up
He hangs up, crosses to the door, opens it
(to himself) Mr
Sheldrake, 've got good news for you -- Putting on his dark glasses, he heads for the elevators, still talking to himself
- Kirkeby and Dobisch are just stepping out of an elevator when Bud approaches
They grin smugly when they see that he is wearing dark glasses
Hi, Buddy-boy
What happened to you
Hit by a swinging door
Or maybe a Yellow Cab
Bud pays no attention, walks right past them into the elevator, still muttering to himself
The doors close
(as they move away from the elevators) That guy really must've belted him
Yeah, he's punchy
Talking to himself
-   - The elevator doors open
Twenty-seven
Bud steps out
As he heads for Sheldrake's office, he continues rehearsing his speech
You see, Mr
Sheldrake, those two days she spent in the apartment -- it made me realize how lonely 'd been before
But thanks to you, 'm in a financial position to marry her -- if  can ever square things with her family
He opens the door to Sheldrake's anteroom
'  - Sheldrake is pacing in front of his desk
couple of suitcases are standing in a corner of the room
The intercom buzzes, and Sheldrake presses the lever down
' Mr
Baxter is here
Send him in
beat, then the door opens, and Bud marches in determinedly
Mr
Sheldrake, 've got good news for you -- And 've got good news for you, Baxter
All your troubles are over
(reacting to the echo) Sir
know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- 'm going to take her off your hands
(stunned) You're going to take her off my hands
That's right
(indicating suitcases) 've moved out of my house -- 'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club
You left your wife
Well, if you must know --  fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me
Ain't that a kick in the head
Yeah -- Now what was your news, Baxter
(recovering with difficulty) It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home
Swell
And don't think 've forgotten what you did for me
(opens door to adjoining office) This way, Baxter
Bud advances slowly toward the door
- It is a slightly smaller and less lavish edition of Sheldrake s office
Sheldrake ushers Bud through the door, points to the chair behind the desk
Sit down
Try it on for size
Bud obeys like an automaton, lowers himself into the chair
You like
(indicating office) It's all yours
Mine
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place
(no reaction from Bud) What's the matter, Baxter
You don't seem very excited
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- 'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik
Now that 've gotten to know her better,  think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody -- Oh, sure, sure
But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, 'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while
(starts back toward his own office) Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room -- Yes, sir
He removes his dark glasses reflectively
That's just one of the privileges that goes with this job
You also get a nice little expense account, the use of the executive washroom -- (breaks off, peers at Bud's face) Say, what happened to you, Baxter
got kicked in the head, too
Oh
With a shrug, he exits into his own office, closing the door behind him
Bud sits there, unconsciously bending the glasses in his hand until they suddenly snap in two
Bud glances down at the two broken halves, as though surprised by his own violence, tosses them on the desk
: - We are close on the building directory
Listed under is
, Director, and just below that a man's hand is inserting the name
in the slot marked Asst
Director
The lettering is complete except for the final
Camera pulls back to reveal the sign painter we saw earlier, working on the directory
Watching him is Bud
He is wearing his chesterfield and bowler, and still has a slight welt under his left eye
It is after six o'clock, and there is very little activity in the lobby
Fran, wearing her coat over street clothes, approaches from the direction of the elevators, stops when she sees Bud
Good evening, Mr
Baxter
Bud turns to her in surprise, removes his bowler
Oh, Miss Kubelik
How do you feel
Fine
How's your eye
Fine
There is a moment of constraint between them
How's everything at the apartment
Nothing's changed
You know, we never finished that gin game -- know
(a beat) suppose you heard about Mr
Sheldrake --
You mean, leaving his wife
Yeah
'm very happy for you
never thought he'd do it
told you all along
You see, you were wrong about Mr
Sheldrake
guess so
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too
What you said about those who take and those who get took
Well, Mr
Sheldrake wasn't using me --  was using him
See
(indicating his name on directory) Last month  was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now 'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want
Yes
(looks at her watch) You walking to the subway
No, thank you
(fumbling) -- well, to tell you the truth -- (glancing around lobby) --  have this heavy date for tonight -- He points off toward the newsstand
Standing there is a tall, attractive brunette, obviously waiting for someone
Fran looks off in the indicated direction
Oh
Aren't you meeting Mr
Sheldrake
No
You know how people talk
So decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise
That's very wise
Good night, Mr
Baxter
Good night, Miss Kubelik
Fran walks toward the revolving doors
Bud watches her for a moment, then strides briskly across the lobby toward the newsstand
He goes right past the waiting brunette, stops in front of a rack of pocket books, examines the merchandise man now comes out of a phone booth, joins the waiting brunette, and they go off together
Bud picks out a couple of paperbacks, pays the clerk behind the counter
Stuffing a book into each coat pocket, he moves slowly toward the revolving doors
: '  - Sheldrake is swiveled around sideways behind his desk, with a bootblack kneeling in front of him, shining his shoes
Reaching for the intercom, Sheldrake presses down one of the levers
Baxter -- would you mind stepping in her for a minute
' Yes, Mr
Sheldrake
The bootblack finishes the second shoe with a flourish, gathers up his equipment
Sheldrake tosses him a half dollar
Much obliged
He exits into the anteroom as the door of the adjoining office opens and Bud comes in, carrying several charts
There is no trace left of his black eye
(putting charts on desk) Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover
Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because -- (breaking in) You're working too hard, Baxter
It's New Year's Eve -- relax
Yes, sir
suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating
Naturally
Me, too
'm taking Miss Kubelik out --  finally talked her into it -- see
The only thing is 'm staying at the Athletic Club -- and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind -- Don't mind what
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, thought 'd better get rid of it quick -- so  threw it out the window of the commuter train
Very clever
Now 'll have to borrow your key
Sorry, Mr
Sheldrake
What do you mean, sorry
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment
'm not just bringing anybody -- 'm bringing Miss Kubelik
Especially not Miss Kubelik
How's that again
(flatly) No key
Baxter,  picked you for my team because  thought you were a bright young man
You realize what you're doing
Not to me -- but to yourself
Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again
You dig
(nodding slowly) dig
So what's it going to be
Without taking his eyes off Sheldrake, Bud reaches into his pocket, fishes out a key, drops it on the desk
Now you're being bright
Thank you, sir
He turns abruptly, starts back into his own office
'   - Bud comes in, shutting the door behind him, stands rooted to the spot for a moment
Then he takes some pencils out of his breast pocket and drops them into a container on the desk, closes his account book, slams a couple of open file drawers shut
As he crosses to the clothes closet, the connecting door opens and Sheldrake comes in, key in hand
Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key
No  didn't
(holding it out) But this is the key to the executive washroom
That's right, Mr
Sheldrake won't be needing it -- because 'm all washed up around here
He has taken his chesterfield and bowler out of the closet, and is putting the coat on
What's gotten into you, Baxter
Just following doctor's orders
've decided to become a mensch
You know what that means
human being
Now hold on, Baxter -- Save it
The old payola won't work any more
Goodbye, Mr
Sheldrake
He opens the door to the anteroom, starts out
'  - Bud comes out of his office, carrying his bowler, strides past the secretaries and through the glass doors to the foyer
An elevator is just unloading, and beside it a handyman is cleaning out one of the cigarette receptacles
Bud crosses to the elevator, and as he passes the handyman, he jams his bowler on the man's head -- surrendering his crown, so to speak
The elevator doors close
The handyman straightens up, looks around in bewilderment
: - Bud is in the process of packing
In the middle of the living room are several large cardboard cartons filled with his possessions
The art posters are off the walls, the bric-a-brac has been removed from the shelves, and Bud is stowing away the last of his books and records
He crosses to the fireplace, opens one of the drawers in the cabinet above it, takes out a forty-five automatic
He holds the gun in the palm of his hand, studies it appraisingly
The doorbell rings
Bud snaps out of his reverie, drops the gun into one of the cartons, goes to the door and opens it
Standing outside is Dr
Dreyfuss, with a plastic ice bucket in his hand
Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so  was wondering -- Sure, Doc
(stepping inside) How come you're alone on New Year's Eve
Well,  have things to do -- (noticing cartons) What's this -- you packing
Yeah -- 'm giving up the apartment
He goes into the kitchen, opens the refrigerator, starts to pry out the ice-cube trays
Where are you moving to
don't know
All  know is  got to get out of this place
Sorry to lose you, Baxter
Me
Oh, you mean my body
Don't worry, Doc -- it'll go to the University -- 'll put it in writing -- He dumps the ice-cubes, still in their trays, into the bucket Dr
Dreyfuss is holding
Then he pulls Kirkeby's unopened bottle of champagne out of the refrigerator
Can you use a bottle of champagne
Booze we don't need
Why don't you join us, Baxter
We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue
No, thanks --  don't feel like it
Look, Doc -- in case  don't see you again -- how much do  owe you for taking care of that girl
Forget it --  didn't do it as a doctor --  did it as a neighbor
(stopping in doorway) By the way, whatever happened to her
(airily) You know me with girls
Easy come, easy go
Goodbye, Doc
Happy New Year
Bud closes the door, returns to the kitchen, brings out a box of glassware and the tennis racquet
As he starts to deposit the racquet in a carton, he notices a strand of spaghetti clinging to the strings
He removes it gently, stands there twirling the limp spaghetti absently around his finger
: - It is five minutes before midnight, New Year's Eve
Sitting alone in the last booth is Fran, a paper hat on her head, a pensive look on her face
There are two champagne glasses on the table, and the usual noisemakers, but the chair opposite her is empty
Above the general hubbub, the Chinese pianist can be heard playing
After a moment, Fran glances off
Threading his way through the merrymakers crowding the bar and overflowing from the booths is Sheldrake
He is in dinner clothes, topped by a paper hat
Reaching the last booth, he drops into the chair facing Fran
Sorry it took me so long on the phone
But we're all set
All set for what
rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City
Atlantic City
know it's a drag -- but you can't find a hotel room in town -- not on New Year's Eve
(a long look at Sheldrake) Ring out the old year, ring in the new
Ring-a-ding-ding
didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault
Baxter
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment
He wouldn't
Just walked out on me -- quit -- threw that big fat job right in my face
(a faint smile) The nerve
That little punk -- after all  did for him
He said  couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik
What's he got against you, anyway
(a faraway look in her eye) don't know
guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise
What are you talking about
'd spell it out for you -- only can't spell
The piano player is consulting the watch on his upraised left arm
He drops the arm in a signal, and the lights go out
At the same time, he strikes up
All over the dimly lit room, couples get to their feet, embracing and joining in the song
In the last booth, Sheldrake leans across the table, kisses Fran
Happy New Year, Fran
Fran's expression is preoccupied
Sheldrake faces in the direction of the pianist, and holding his glass aloft, sings along with the others
As    comes to an end, the place explodes noisily -- there is a din of horns, ratchets, and shouted greetings
The lights come up again
In the last booth, Sheldrake turns back toward Fran -- but she is no longer there
Her paper hat lies abandoned on her vacated chair
Fran -- (looking around) -- where are you, Fran
He rises, cranes his neck, trying to spot her in the crowd
: - Fran, a coat thrown over the dress she was wearing at the Rickshaw, comes down the street almost at a run
There is a happy, expectant look on her face
She hurries up the steps of the house and through the front door
- Fran mounts the stairs eagerly
As she reaches the landing and heads for Bud's apartment, there is a loud, sharp report from inside
Fran freezes momentarily, then rushes to the door
Mr
Baxter
(pounding on door) Mr
Baxter
Mr
Baxter
The door opens and there stands Bud, the bottle of champagne he has just uncorked still foaming over in his hand
He stares at Fran unbelievingly
(sagging with relief) Are you all right
'm fine
Are you sure
How's your knee
'm fine all over
Mind if  come in
(still stunned) Of course not
- Fran comes in and Bud shuts the door
The room is the same as we left it, except for an empty champagne glass standing on the coffee table
Let me get another glass
He goes to one of the cartons, takes out a champagne glass wrapped in newspaper, starts to unwrap it
(looking around) Where are you going
Who knows
Another neighborhood -- another town -- another job -- 'm on my own
That's funny -- so am
(Bud, pouring champagne, looks up at her) What did you do with the cards
(indicating carton) In there
Fran takes the deck of cards and the gin rummy score pad out of the carton, settles herself on the couch, starts to shuffle the cards expertly
What about Mr
Sheldrake
'm going to send him a fruit cake every Christmas
Bud sinks down happily on the couch, and Fran holds out the deck to him
Cut
Bud cuts a card, but doesn't look at it
love you, Miss Kubelik
(cutting a card) Seven -- (looking at Bud's card) -- queen
She hands the deck to Bud
Did you hear what  said, Miss Kubelik
absolutely adore you
(smiling) Shut up and deal
Bud begins to deal, never taking his eyes off her
Fran removes her coat, starts picking up her cards and arranging them
Bud, a look of pure joy on his face, deals -- and deals -- and keeps dealing
And that's about it
Story-wise
