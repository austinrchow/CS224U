The colored shapes dart around the screen -- the impression of looking through a kaleidoscope
As the image comes into sharp focus, we discover that we are inside a
'  are frantically removing all the cherry-flavored pieces of candy
- The man performing this curious task is writer/producer/director,  , forties, conservatively dressed in suit and tie
He sits alone at an empty craft service table outside a cavernous soundstage, some distance from the rest of the film set -- a breeze blows the table's paper cloth
Viktor finishes sorting
Finding no trash can to deposit the rejected cherry candy, he scoops them into his pocket
young headset-clad
hurriedly approaches
He looks ill
Mr
Taransky -- Viktor reads the young
's panicked expression
She's walking
Don't tell me she's walking
(blood slowly draining from his face) She is not walking
She can't walk
- , twenty-something, -list actress, beautiful face scowling, is supervising her  ferrying clothes from a movie trailer to a limousine
desperately follows after Nicola
-- Nicola
How was your massage
You're in breach
-- Is this about the new pages
-- made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene -- (wheeling on him) It's not the size of the role, Viktor
(suddenly very cool) Am  or am  not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set
(regarding the enormous silver fish behind them, confused) It's the biggest on earth swear
It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that
Taller, Viktor
Taller
What
Viktor looks up in horror
The trailer next to Nicola's does indeed appear to be fractionally taller
(walking away) You've insulted me for the last time
Viktor looks to the tires
His face suddenly brightens
Nicola, it's just the tires -- they're over-inflated
can fix it
Viktor grasps the air nozzle on a tire and begins desperately stabbing at it with a ballpoint pen
Air hisses out
See, it's lower already
Nicola ignores Viktor, marching towards her limo with her Abandoning the trailer, Viktor hurries after her
beg you
You can't do this to me
(looking back) had three other offers
only signed on to this picture out of
loyalty
Then show some
They'll shut me down
(opening the car door) It wasn't working anyhow
The scene with the thousand geese -- don't understand this film don't think anyone will understand it
already put out a press release -- citing "creative differences"
Viktor stops, nods resignedly -- suddenly very calm
You know what, Nicola, you're right
(picking up her last piece of luggage) Here, let me help you with that
(holding the door for her) You ought to go
The truth is don't deserve you
This film doesn't deserve you
Frankly, it deserves much, much better
The reason it's not working is because you're not about the work
Nicola is stunned
(to the limo driver) To Hell, please
The door slams and the limo roars away
Viktor looks to the still hissing trailer tire
The  regards Viktor apprehensively
(to the crew) What are you looking at
Get back to work
The crew is uncertain what work there is to do
- ", " - In an ornate bedroom,  lies on her death bed under a veil of netting
distraught man, , sits close by
(whispered) Jack
are you there
'm here
'm right beside you
enters
(to Hal) You should really go now
No, it's alright
Please, let him stay
The nun withdraws
Hal holds his face in his hands, almost breaking down
(a glance to heaven) What kind of cruel God is it that would take you away from me
The same one who brought me to you
No
cannot accept it
If something like this can happen
What
(struggling to find the words) What is it for
(smiles through her pain) -- Why are we here
Is that what you're asking, Jack
Why are we here
No why
Just here
Nicola dies peacefully
-  - sits with leading man ,   and studio head  , watching a rough assembly of the film
It ends with a close up of
The lights go up
The image of Nicola fades off the screen
1 She's good
You can hardly tell she's reading off a teleprompter
(ignoring him) 've analyzed the footage
We've got almost everything we need in the can
If we rework the script, we can finish the film without her
2 (forceful shake of the head) According to the writ her attorneys filed at noon today
They'll sue if the film is released with Nicola in a single frame
(more anxious) So we'll re-cast
Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role
(incredulous) It's a re-make, Hal
Anders is not bigger than this picture
Elaine finally speaks up
Of course she is
No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her
We don't need a name
We'll cast an unknown
won't play opposite an unknown
We can't sell an unknown
Nicola's soured on the project and we have to accept that
If we ever want to be in the Nicola Anders business again, we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture
The executives, leading man and director nod sagely
(aghast) No
You will not give in to that blackmailing bitch
(a wince, addressing everyone but Viktor) Excuse us
Elaine ushers Viktor out of the screening room
- and  talk in the shadow of an enormous soundstage
They speak more freely in each other's company
God, Viktor
Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself
Difficult
'm difficult
He produces a handful of candy from his pocket
(referring to the candy) -- Do you know what these are, Elaine
(talking a piece of candy and eating it) Hmm
Mike and Ike's
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's
Do you know why , Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director -- -- Viktor, that was Short Subject
-- overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career, am walking around with a pocketful of cherry Mike & Ike's
Elaine takes a seat in a nearby studio cart as Viktor paces
--  have a feeling you're going to tell me
-- 'll tell you why
It is because Miss Nicola Anders, supermodel with a  card God's gift to cinema, has it written into her contract that all cherry Mike & Ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened, that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room, and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first class
-- What's wrong with that
Elaine, she doesn't have any children
(grabbing her arm) Don't you see
We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the -list
The public decides who's on that list
Please
It's the truth
Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy
We can't open -- can't make a profit without them
We can hardly make a profit with them
Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine
We're at their mercy
(staring wistful, into space) We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars
We used to decide who would play what role
We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date
When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once
(regarding him as if he's insane) You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in
(irritated at her infuriating logic) Well,  do remember why  started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema -- (rolling her eyes) -- It's called a projector
(ignoring her) -- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth
Listen, Viktor,  have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal
This is business
Spare me
(gesturing at the studio lot) -- Christ, Viktor, look around
What do you think pays for all this
This is about investment and return
Those days in New York
that's
it's over
pause
Viktor reads Elaine's face
You're not renewing my contract
How can
Your last three pictures tanked
The board is giving me hell
No bankable star will work with you after this
If you just compromised
a little
Viktor eats some of the candy in his hand as he takes in the news
(rueful smile) -- Well, it's not every day you're fired by the mother of your own child
Elaine also eats some more candy -- a curiously intimate moment between them
(softening, a heart-to heart) 'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal
You and  both know, after the divorce  kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey
called what's his name at Warner's
He said he'd take a meeting -- in July
've fought for you Viktor
(voice trails off) You want to talk severance
(staring off into the distance, face hardening) You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all  want is the picture
(confused) The picture's dead
So there's no problem --  can have the rights, the negative too
(believing she's getting off lightly) They're yours
But how are you going to finish it
Without a star there's no movie
don't need a star
All  need is an actor -- 'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor
real leading lady
Even if you find her, you know the problem with unknowns, Viktor
If they're good, they get known
And then you're back to sorting their candy
and worse
(kissing him on the cheek as she departs in her studio golf cart) 'm sorry, Viktor
Viktor watches her depart down the canyon of stages, left alone on the deserted lot
- Twenty  '  jiggle into frame
's face appears amongst them
They are cardboard figures, standing together in the trailer of an electric cart
is collecting the promotional standees from around the lot
places his hands on the neck of a cardboard cut-out -- we sense he is about to rip her head off -- when a fourteen year old girl, , appears beside him, carrying a laptop computer
Hi, Dad
(slightly ashamed) Hello, sweetheart
Viktor, embarrassed by his childishness, steps aside for the suspicious workman who carries the standee away
Lainey smiles sweetly
She hugs him
'm sorry Mom canned you
(shrugging) It's really
not anything, Lainey
It's just -- Don't feel too bad
(glancing to a standee) Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her
You're better off out of it
(regarding his daughter) You look very grown up
What are you doing
You meeting your mom for dinner
She glances towards the entrance where Lainey's mother, , and her dependable, uncomplicated businessman boyfriend, , wait beside Elaine's car
(reluctant admission) Kent got tickets to the ballet
Viktor shakes the idea of Kent and Elaine from his head
(trying to convince himself as much as Lainey) 'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart
It's important
(not quite convinced) know you'll do it, Dad
You're Viktor Taransky
Lainey kisses the forlorn Viktor goodbye
She runs to her mother and Kent
(to himself) That's right
'm Viktor Taransky
-    - From a distance  and  regard the lonely figure of You had no choice, Elaine
He's a liability
(wistful look to Viktor) He also happens to be the most talented man 've ever known
Elaine climbs in the car as Lainey approaches
-  - on a copy of "Variety"
The front page banner headline: "    '' -- Cites Creative Differences" The man reading the trade paper sits in the back of a tram on a studio tour --
He wears a pair of spectacles with one lens blacked out, his head tilted on one side
It is an item buried on the inside pages that catches Hank's one good eye
-: "-, -  " - Director's Future Now In Doubt - The tram pauses
The   keeps up a commentary
-- On your left, the house where Claris Commodore uttered those now immortal words, "If that door doesn't hold, stand behind me"
And coming up on your right -- When the tram departs, we discover that Hank has exited the tram and is hiding in the facade of a New York subway entrance
The tag around his neck reads, " -- Stay With The Tour"
- wheels a stack of film cans on a dolly while holding several framed black and white photographs of screen legends under his arm
, hiding in the shadows of the soundstages, spies Viktor
He hurries towards him as Viktor approaches his antiquated Bentley
-- Mr
Taransky, Mr
Taransky
thank God
've been trying to see you, calling -- Your assistant wouldn't put me through
told her it was a matter of life and death
was afraid  wouldn't get to you in time -- (using his stack of film cans as a barrier) -- Please, get away from me
did it, Mr
Taransky
licked skin
licked hair
licked every part of her
(more disturbed, fearing he is dealing with a pervert) You want me to call Security
have her, Mr
Taransky
The answer to your prayers
(producing the "Variety" article, conspiratorial) The answer to this
(regarding the article) was misquoted
have your new leading lady
(indicating the bulge in his pocket) right here in my pants
Viktor takes a step back, concerned once again about the man's motives
(trying to reassure) It's me, Mr
Taransky
Don't you recognize me
-- The Future of Film conference in San Jose
Hank
Hank Aleno
was keynote speaker
You must remember my speech
"Who Needs Humans
" (faint glimmer of recognition) That's right
You were booed off the stage
That's got to be --
-- Eight years ago
In that whole time,  never left my computer
(wary) Good for you, Hank
(referring to his covered eye) Good and bad
They think that's what caused this
Me eye tumor
Microwaves from the screen
It's the size of a grapefruit
Heavy too
(regarding the pathetic figure with the tilted head) 'm sorry
Don't be
It was worth it
Hank once again indicated the bulge in his pocket
Viktor now understands the significance of the gesture
You have to see her
(loading cans into the car) 've seen them all before
Not like this -- (patronizing smile) Come on, Hank
synthespian, virtual actor --
(irritated) -- We call them "vactors"
need flesh and -- -- Flesh is weak
-- a living, breathing actor -- can't work with a fake
Viktor loads his film cans into the car
(pointing to Nicola in Variety) You already do
But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer
(whispers, conspiratorial) The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years
That's the point, Hank
No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse
Everyone's tried
Everyone's failed
It can't be done
It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together
don't know anything about computers
That's why you're so perfect
You have something  don't have
What's that
An eye -- for performance
You know the truth when you see it know
've seen your movies love your movies
You do
"Straw God" changed my life
You saw that
've seen every frame of your work
You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision
You and me, art and science
we are the perfect marriage
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day
(climbing into his car) 'll call you about his next week
(at the car window) won't be here next week
The tumor's inoperable
'll be dead
(winding down the window) 'm already dead
Viktor's car roars away
He looks back at the forlorn Hank in the rear view mirror
Call me
(looking at his watch) This week
huge eye from a dismantled Nicola Anders billboard is wheeled away behind him -- followed by a huge pair of lips
'   - sea of ingenue headshots
Black 's are drawn through all of them
lies amongst the rejected faces, talking on the telephone, in his spartan bachelor beach house
(into phone, referring to a young woman's headshot) -- What do you mean she won't work with me
She's done nothing
She doesn't have a single credit -- ' (from phone, off-camera) -- Better no credits than a Taransky credit
No young actress is going to step into Nicola Anders' shoes and risk ending her career before it's even started
-- Art, you don't understand
've mortgaged everything to finish this film -- creditors calling, coming to the house, for God's sake, need this -- The phone goes dead
Viktor tries to re-dial -- disconnected
-- Damn
Sharp knock on his door
Viktor peers through a curtain and spies an official-looking    , carrying what looks to be a legal notice in his hands
Viktor slips out of the back door
- hurries along the beach
When he turns, he discovers the     following him
As Viktor runs, the Suit runs -- calling out to him
Mr
Taransky, Mr
Taransky -- (calling back) 'm not him
Viktor stumbles
When he recovers, the Suit is on him
Mr
Taransky, Sir,  represent the estate of Mr
Hank Aleno
(showing him Hank's obituary in the
Times) It was Mr
Aleno's last wish that you have this
The Suit hands Viktor a heavily-sealed envelope
What is it
have no idea, Sir
He wanted you to have it
The Suit departs
Viktor hesitates, then breaks the seal on the package -- inside he finds a hard-drive
The hard-drive is labeled " "
: a   cleaning a tatty red carpet
On the other end of the vacuum cleaner is
The red carpet leads to a rundown, downtown Los Angeles cinema -- the venue for the premiere of ", "
To save money on posters, Viktor has altered the originals, "Starring " crudely pasted over with "Introducing "
- regards the sad, little premiere
No paparazzi, no limos, no klieg lights
Resorting to giving away tickets to -, Viktor approaches a   sleeping in trash
Want to see a free movie
(he thinks) No
taxi pulls up
Viktor's daughter, , steps out
(kissing him hello) Hi, Dad
Hello, Lainey
Viktor goes to pay for the taxi but doesn't have quite enough cash
Lainey pays herself
Your mother couldn't make it
She's at the premiere of " Cold Day In Hell"
But  think she send someone from Acquisitions
She still with Kent
This week anyhow
escorts Lainey down the empty red carpet, regarding the pathetic premiere
As they walk by, the bulb in Viktor's sole spotlight expires
Not quite how  imagined it -- (looking on the bright side) -- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters
Did you really do all the post yourself
There was no other way
missed you
wondered if you were ever coming back
Me too
(regarding the makeshift poster, trying to lift his spirits) Well,  can't wait to meet Simone
what's her last name
You know,
don't know
Is she here tonight
She can't watch herself
They are interrupted by the
-- Hey, we have to start
've got "Tough Love 2" playing at ten
- ", " - foggy, empty pier
is running through the mist, shouting desperately
Valarie
Finally, out of the fog -- a young woman in a black cape and hood, her back to us
The camera pushes in, music swells and she turns
She is exquisitely, ethereally beautiful
Perfect
-  - In the near-empty, dilapidated theater, ", " is playing
When Simone's face appears, the faces of the change
They are all visibly moved, including the Some weeping, some with curious smiles on their faces, some opened-mouthed
( , approaching) Valarie, what are you running from
(enigmatic smile) From Valarie
Suddenly a  rings out
Simone collapses to the ground
(running to her) Valarie
No
- , unable to watch, paces up and down, chain-smoking while worriedly shoving popcorn in his mouth
Viktor finally musters the courage to look inside the auditorium
- ", " - The same scene that played in the studio screening room
However now when we cut from the leading man, , to the leading lady it is not  but the newly cast
-- Why are we here
Is that what you're asking, Jack
Why are we here
No why
Just here
- lies dying
Now even  is affected by Simone's performance
She wipes a tear from her eye
watches the backs of the heads, trying to gauge the audience reaction
Finally the credits roll
dedication, "For "
No one moves from their seats
Viktor permits himself a brief smile of satisfaction as he sees his name appear in the credits: Film By Still no one moves from their seats
Viktor cannot stand it any longer
He runs to the restroom
- Face over the stained sink,  splashes himself with water
He looks to the mirror, horrified by his own reflection
He rehearses a courtroom speech
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, may be guilty of a crime, but it was committed with the purest of intentions, to send a message to the acting community who put themselves above the work and above -- Three   enter the restroom
They approach the urinals
1 (continuing their conversation from the lobby) -- So fake
2 -- Totally artificial
Viktor looks at the men aghast and hurriedly exits, missing the end of their conversation
1 We're really supposed to believe that was 19th Century Lisbon
3 Who's looking at the sets when she is on the screen
All three nod in agreement and begin to urinate
- exits the restroom
Almost all the  , including , are waiting for him
(pointing out her father) There he is
That's my dad, Viktor Taransky
Viktor is about to run for the exit when the small group spontaneously applauds
They rush to shake his hand
4 -- She is magnificent
5 -- Absolutely unreal
Viktor appears uncomfortable with their compliments
She wasn't too
cartoony
6 -- Who
The nun
7 -- Or are you talking about the mother
8 --  star like that, who cares about the supporting cast
9 -- Congratulations again
She was
not of this earth
You should be very proud
"Not of this earth"
good way of putting it
And the film as a whole --
The group drifts away, leaving  and  alone
She's a miracle, Dad
Where did you find her
(vague) saw her picture on the, er
internet
(interrogating his daughter's face) You really didn't notice anything -- unusual
Only her brilliance
To be honest, with what you had to work with, was expecting a train wreck
You really pulled it off
Lainey regards the makeshift poster
have a feeling mom is going to take you back after this
Viktor's head snaps around
Lainey smiles
Back on the lot
Viktor shrugs off the misunderstanding
'   - enters his sterile, bachelor home, carrying his mail
His answering machine blinks in the darkness, the message light reads ""
He hits the "" button
(
) Viktor, you bastard
hear it's great
(beat) Seriously, 'm happy for you
Viktor opens a drawer containing a photo of he and Elaine from happier times
He gazes at it as he listens to the message
(
) know people are going to be beating down your door but
well, 'd love the chance to buy back something  gave away for free
Don't you just love Hollywood
Viktor stops the machine, dazed
He idly opens his mail
Inside an envelope he finds a  Card with the new member's name, ""

And why the secrecy
All we know for sure is that she was discovered by little-known director, Viktor Tarinsky
- , watching "" on a  in the back of a limousine, corrects the reporter
Taransky
(from the ) He has parlayed his relationship with the new sensation into a three picture deal with the very studio that dumped him only six months ago
And no wonder with the starlet's performance breaking all box office records
- Outside the studio entrance, a swarm of , and  rush 's limousine, hoping for a glimpse of
Simone Want to  you
Studio   hold them back as the limo enters the lot
-  - and an entourage of  greets 's limousine on the studio steps

banner reads, "Welcome "
wheels a cake
steps out of the car
pushes past him, into the limo
Simone
Simone
The car is empty
(re-emerging from the car) Where is she
Good to see you too, Elaine
(ignoring his sarcasm) Why isn't she with you
Why
Because she would never show up at something like this
She's intensely private
Elaine sighs, exasperated
(dismissing her colleagues) Back to work, everyone
She's not here
The reception committee disperses, murmurs of disappointment
Viktor
want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio
Don't thank me
It was entirely Simone's decision
Do you have Simone's check
don't have it on me
Anyway, it means a lot
(quickly changing tack) Have you read the reviews
They're love letters
(reading from a newspaper) Listen to this one
"Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel"
(musing to himself) Almost right
can't wait to meet her
don't know if that's going to happen
(confused) Why not
As  say, she's
something of a recluse
That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art
(face falling) Don't be ridiculous
arranged a press conference
Out of the question
circus like that
Viktor, it's my studio
She's my actor
There are other studios, Elaine
There's only one Simone
(leaving her on the steps) Leave the press conference to me
Viktor strides up the studio steps
Elaine stares after her ex-husband -- she finds herself smiling at his newfound arrogance
-   - The studio soundstages as a backdrop,  approaches a podium and a forest of microphones, revelling in his recent fame by association
(tapping the microphone) Is this on
1 Who are you
Taransky, Viktor
-a-r-a-n-s-k-y, -i-k-t-o-r
1 Yeah, but -- who are you
(patronizing smile) am a two-time Academy Award nominated director with over eighteen films to my credit thus far including my latest release, "Sunrise, Sunset"
Who are you
rolls her eyes at his pomposity
will not be taking any questions
However  do have a statement to read on behalf of my leading lady, Simone
(reading from his statement) "To Whom It May Concern
'm deeply grateful for the extraordinary public response to Mr
Taransky's film
At this time will be conducting no interviews or making publicity appearances since  am really nothing without the beautiful worlds and characters Mr
Taransky creates for me politely request that the press respect my privacy and let the work speak for itself
All questions and inquiries should be directed to Mr
Taransky to whom  entrust all aspects of my career
Yours very truly, Simone"
The reporters all call out at once
2 -- Viktor, Viktor, who's Simone dating
3 -- Viktor, where'd you find her
4 -- Is Simone her real name
5 -- What's she got to hide
1 -- Is she the new Garbo
2 -- Who's Garbo
Viktor silences the reporters by theatrically raising his hands
thought  made it clear -- no questions regarding Simone
(bringing the press conference to a hasty conclusion) Now,  would like to close by announcing that Miss Simone begins production today on her next film, "Eternity Forever"
This project has been near and dear to my heart since  wrote it nine years ago
(a tinge of bitterness, then a smile) Thank you
Viktor exits the podium
voice stops him in his tracks
(
) Who do you think you're fooling, Taransky
Viktor turns
The voice belongs to over-zealous, crusading, truth-seeking investigative reporter,  , accompanied by his assistant,
Do  know you
Max Sayer -- National Echo
(regaining his composure, a smirk) Don't you have a real story to write
Why aren't you in Latin America
This is the story
remember when the Echo had class -- the paper that could bring down governments
Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols
If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me
They are alive, Sayer
Milton confirms that Woodward and Bernstein are still living
So they're probably here
(hardly missing a beat) You might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world, but 'm not buying it
What's really behind this Simone woman
The public has a right to know
Why is she staying out of sight
And why the hell is she with you
don't want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but you're not exactly Cecil
DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill
Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer
Look it up
Viktor walks away
(calling after him) Oh,  know all about integrity know even more about persistence
Look that one up
Max watches Viktor depart, with obvious suspicion
-   - large satellite dish sits atop a soundstage
" " is the sign on the door -- a surveillance camera panning the entrance
, also keeping watch, nods a greeting to  as he pulls up in his studio golf cart, script in hand
No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr
Taransky
Good
Is Miss Simone coming today
She's already here
She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone
(admonishing guard) Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission
What if it catches on fire
Let it burn
Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy
Viktor enters his secret code into the keypad lock and enters the soundstage
'  - The cavernous soundstage is almost completely empty save for a small table upon which sits two computer keyboards and a tablet attached to a large, projection screen monitor and two side monitors
takes a seat in front of the monitor
(to himself as he inserts his Hollywood hard-drive --  ) Pay no attention to the man behind the computer
title appears on his computer screen
Welcome to With a satisfied smile, Viktor backspaces characters until he revises the title to: Welcome to He presses "" and a face begins to build -- wire upon wire, pixel upon pixel -- until a completed synthespian emerges --
She is indistinguishable from a flesh-and blood actress
Simone moves on a video loop against a neutral background -- titled "  6"
Within the confines of the monitor she is reminiscent of a beautiful caged animal
She looks a little bored as if she has been cooped up in cyberspace for too long
(to the screen) Good morning, Simone
/ Good morning, Mr
Taransky
star is
/ digitized
Only now do we observe that Viktor is occasionally talking into a microphone connected to the computer and pressing a key on his keyboard
When he speaks, she speaks
Simone's voice and mouth movements automatically sync in response to Viktor's voice
scanning light on Viktor allows Simone to mimic his movements
/ You mean they buy it
(nervous smile as he examines his first royalty check) Buy it
They're paying for it
And around here that's how you really know they buy it
Viktor fondly touches a photograph of Hank that is taped to the terminal -- from the "
Times" obituaries
'm only sorry Hank isn't here to see this
Viktor looks up, Simone mimicking his action
/ (depressing the button every time he wants to express his thoughts through Simone) Maybe he can
Do you have any idea what this means, Simone
Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it
/ (appearing to indulge Viktor with a smile) am the death of real
(pondering the enormity of the hoax) You are birth of
what Phenomenon
miracle
new era in show business
All  wanted to do was finish the film
/ And now look what you've started
And now look what you've started
And now look what you've started
Viktor's conversation with himself is not merely for his own amusement
He is adjusting and refining Simone's voice
Hmm
a little less Streep, a little more Bacall
Viktor scrolls through a photo library of stars, living and dead, that comprise Simone
Viktor makes an adjustment on a panel on the computer screen dedicated to Simone's audio, incorporating the vocal deliveries -- "20% , 80% "
He speaks once again as Simone to test the adjustment
The voice patterns appear on his screen -- graphic representations of the sound waves
/ Is that better, Mr
Taransky
Yes
Yes, it is
snaps back to reality himself
He scrolls through the list of screen legends
He clicks on the image of While  think of it, 'd like you to add something to your repertoire -- remember that thing Hepburn does in "Breakfast At Tiffany's"
clip of   in "Breakfast At Tiffany's" plays on the screen
Hepburn, sitting on a fire escape, looks up
(from the screen, an incomparable smile) Hi
(pausing the moment) Let's hear you say "Hi" like Audrey
With a  and , Viktor morphs the gesture seamlessly into a frozen Simone
Viktor presses play
(imitating Audrey's performance perfectly) Hi
Perfect
(stretching) God, 'm so relaxed around you
/ You did create me
No
just helped bring someone else's dream to life
/ Mr
Taransky, we both know  was nothing without you
was computer code -- ones and zeros
You're right
You're right
Of course, one doesn't want to boast
It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist
That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see
Viktor gets up and starts walking around the room, warming to his theme
moves in a   on the monitor, nodding attentively as if she's really interested
See beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood
-- See that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake
(voice raising in excitement) -- See that if the performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor is real
Once a performance is committed to film, the blood and bones are gone anyway
Only the spirit, the illusion remains
Besides, what's real anymore
These days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area
/ (Simone appears to look directly at her maker) Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr
Taransky
The only real truth is in the work
/ You know what 'm talking about
Yes
Yes, 'm going to tell the truth about you, why wouldn't
(pondering his own question) Of course, with Hank's tragic passing, the secret died with him
(shaking the thought from his head) am going to tell the truth
after your next picture
Feeling uneasy at the prospect, Viktor changes the subject
He pulls out his script for " "
Speaking of which -- this is the project 'd like you to do next
/ Not, "Eternity Forever"
The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made
'd kill for that part
was hoping you'd say that
Suddenly, Simone appears to talk on her own
'll do anything to please you, Mr
Taransky
(pretending to be hard of hearing) 'm sorry,  didn't catch that
What did you say
'll do anything to please you, Mr
Taransky
On a side monitor, we discover a highlighted box marked " " -- Viktor's finger on the "" button
He is unable to resist speaking another line
/ And  will never, ever leave you
Simone appears to indulge Viktor by blowing him a kiss -- until we see that Viktor has now highlighted a box marked, "   -- , , , , , ,   ,   "
Viktor comes close to the monitor
He notices something about Simone's face
You're so beautiful
Too beautiful
Viktor accesses a program labeled, " "
He adds a "" and a ""
From a distance we watch him, alone with Simone in the vast, empty soundstage
- 's face against the
As he walks, we reveal that the sky is no more than a huge, painted backdrop on the studio lot -- behind a parking lot
Viktor hands his valet ticket to a fawning
-- Just be a minute, Mr
Taransky
We gave you a complimentary car wash -- they're washing the engine now
Viktor joins other industry  and  waiting for their cars under an umbrella
young approaches
Viktor
Look, 'm sorry  didn't call you back last year
was, er
out of the country
(strained moment) But we should get together
My schedule's wide open
Sure, 'll
"call you"
The agent's face falls
He gets in his car, disconsolate
Suddenly,  , rushes over and hugs Viktor
Viktor, 'm so happy for us
Hello, Hal
The film
The chemistry
No reflections on Nicola but Simone and  -- we were just so right together
You never were together, Hal
And still the connection was undeniable
(aside) haven't read "Eternity Forever" but  know it's brilliant
And know  would be perfect for Clive
(correcting him) Clyde
Yes, perfect
(lowering his voice) As a matter of fact,  ran into Simone on the lot the other day
(genuinely startled) Really
She didn't mention it
(quickly covering) 'm sure she's meeting with a lot of people right now
(under his breath) She is just as you described her, Viktor
indescribable strongly sensed she thought  was right for it
Behind his back, Viktor surreptitiously presses a button on his cell phone
The phone rings
Viktor feigns surprise and answers
(answering the phone he has just dialed, louder than necessary) Hello
How are you, sweetheart
hush descends over the executives
Hal is suddenly very uncomfortable
Even the  strain to eavesdrop on the conversation
(winking to Hal) You'll never guess who 'm with
you ran into him on the lot
It was more in passing
You're so far off
(finally chuckles) Hal
Hal Sinclair
your co- star
Remember now
No,  don't think he's put on weight
(a shrug of apology to the appalled Hal) Anyway, you think he's right for "Eternity Forever"
not the right type
a different direction
(covering phone, to Hal) 'll try to talk her into it
The other   make a note of the remark mortified Hal excuses himself with a pathetic wave, climbing into his car
(into phone) Listen this is a bad place to talk
what
sweetheart,  know you have charity work you want to do,  know you want to give back -- but remember, your greatest gift is your talent
we'll talk about it at the beach house this weekend
'm looking forward to it too
Viktor hangs up
His car pulls up
He tips extravagantly and drives away
The   get on their cell phones
-  - Parked behind the sky facade is a curious  with shaded windows
- Inside the car,   and assistant , scanner in hand, are replaying Viktor's intercepted phone call on a computer
' (from the machine) -- "
You think he's right for "Eternity Forever"
not the right type
a different direction
" (to Max, a shake of the head) 'm getting nothing from her side of the conversation
Is it a jamming device
(shrugs) Maybe he's talking to himself
(dismissing the idea) Taransky isn't that good an actor
No, they're taking special precautions
Some kind of new encryption
Why
(musing) Whatever it is, it's dark
Dark
Yes, very
They continue listening to the recording

We'll talk about it at the beach house this weekend
" 's eyes light up
He gazes to a photo of  pasted to the inside of the car
'   - and  make breakfast
Lainey is in her pajamas, occasionally glancing to a laptop computer as her father prepares French toast
(glancing to the computer) Can't you stop that
Why
Those things can be dangerous
Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world
You can lose yourself
You should get out more
How are you going to meet boys
(shrugs coyly, getting up) know plenty of boys
Really
Who
Where do you meet them
In a chat room
How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak
Dad,  can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away
Okay
But you have to find a way to escape that thing
do
How
read
You do
Still
can't tell you how happy  am to hear that
You were the one who insisted on it
Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when  was four
You understood them
That's what was amazing
(looking out the window) It's a nice day
Let's eat outside
Lainey grabs the plates and opens the deck door
We hear a chorus of
Actually, it may be nicer inside
Viktor joins her at the doorway
Stay here, 'll deal with this
Unfazed, Lainey retreats into the house
'   - Boats are moored just off the beach packed dangerously full of telephoto lens-toting
The next door houses have  protruding through the drapes of the windows
strides onto the lawn of his property that backs onto the beach, soaking up the attention -- unable to resist waving extravagantly
Suddenly, a , losing his balance, drops from a nearby rooftop
The photographer limps towards the fence
Viktor calmly follows, retrieving the photographer's camera and ripping out the film with a flourish -- he is clearly relishing the attention
The photographer clambers over the fence where he joins several dozen other - and
1 That wasn't her, Taransky
Where is she
You can't hide her forever
(hurling the camera into the mob) You'll never find her
Simone only appears when  want her to appear
from "The  " is at the head of the mob, accompanied by assistant
She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky
Are you holding her hostage
Are you some kind of Svengali
(recognizing the reporter) Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you
You look kind of "captive" yourself
While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what,  guarantee she doesn't even know you exist
Get off my property or 'll call the cops
The cops
The cops read my column to know who to bust
We're the only watchdog the public has
(looking around at the photographers) None of this is going away
We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that
Until you slip up
And you will
You are looking at your shadow
(getting in his face) Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural
'm just trying to help you, Sayer
don't want you to be disappointed
It gets cold out here at night
Nice try
If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative
can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and  are going to get acquainted
(turning away) 'd like to see that, Sayer
Invite me
'  - drives along a twisty mountain road,  in the passenger seat
They have become so blase about the paparazzi, they no longer acknowledge the posse of motorcycle risking their necks to stay up with the car
( ) -- The rumor is, Simone is holed up in Taransky's Malibu home -- so far we haven't seen so much as a glimpse -- (switching off the radio) Honey, 'm really sorry about all this
don't know if it's safe for you to stay the weekends
just until things settle down
(shrugs) Okay, Dad
If anyone asks about Simone -- --  know,  don't know anything
Exactly
(slightly irritated by her lack of interest) Don't you wonder where 'm really hiding Simone
(looking to him) 'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important
Lainey gives her father a smile
Through the car window behind her, a  appears to lose control and drops down a bank
'  - ' car pulls up to Elaine's imposing mansion gives her father a kiss and departs
, in the garden, overseeing a  pruning roses, approaches
(from the car) Sorry  didn't get her back in time
No problem
(she smiles) Do you want to come in
(surprised -- pleasantly) Why not
'  - walks down a hall, passing the dining room, where is working on a computer
Kent smiles blandly
Hey, Vik
(disappointed to see him) Hello -- Kent
'  - waits in an opulent drawing room
Despite the eighty degree temperature outside, a fire burns in the hearth
enters, waving a thick studio file
Viktor's face falls, expecting a less business-related conversation
Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity
" "Forever"
Whatever
still haven't received Simone's script notes
There aren't any
If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy
She considers herself an
"instrument"
Really
Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity
(shrugs) If it's on the page
Elaine refers to her documents, bewildered
Well, something has to be done about this budget
It's completely unrealistic
(referring to a column in the budget) You allowed nothing for limousine service
She'll drive herself
Hair and make-up
She'll do her own
Theater training
She was in the theater
When
Where
'll send you her resume
Al least a contingency for wardrobe
Any woman can go up a dress size
--  guarantee she won't gain an once
She's very disciplined
(concerned by an entry in the budget) Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman"
What about it
There isn't one
No need
She does all her own stunts
(skeptical) Even the fall from the plane
(nonchalant) Even the fall from the plane
Well, shoot it on the last day
Viktor regards Elaine with a condescending look
As 've tried to explain to you, Elaine
Simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known
She's about the work and only the work -- lives for the work
She wants all the money up there
(gazing into space) on the screen where it belongs
She'd work for scale except  know you only respect people you pay a fortune
Which accounts for your percentage
(tossing the budget on the coffee table) When do  get to meet this dream
Not today
She's learning her lines
(glancing to Elaine's budget) You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget
(smiles) 'll walk you out
Elaine escorts Viktor out to the lavish garden
'  -  - 's demeanor softens
She speaks to  quietly, sympathetically
Listen, Viktor
want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife
(correcting herself) Second ex-wife
You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful
We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband
what the hell happened to you
(exasperated) Experience, Viktor
've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them
'm worried about you, that's all
This woman -- she controls your destiny
Simone does not control my destiny
Viktor,  have a feeling
One of my feelings
There's something about her  don't trust
From her bedroom window on the mansion's second floor, smiles at the sight of her mother and father together
& '  - enters his office where he's greeted by his assistant, (sheepish) Thanks for taking me back, Mr
Taransky
know it looked like sided with the studio, but  always believed in you, honestly
Don't worry
understand
(referring to the cast seated around a conference table) They're all here
& '  - sits at the head of the table, surrounded by , ,  and three other
preliminary poster behind him -- "   -  in " -- bears a huge photograph of Simone's face
can't tell you how delighted  am to have this wonderful cast assembled for "Eternity Forever"
Thank you all
Now, a reminder -- as a condition for working on this film, you will not be rehearsing with Simone, shooting with Simone and you are forbidden from contacting Simone in any way at any time, whatsoever
The  nods seriously
(a thought occurs) How will you do our love scenes
Body double
(confused) For her
For you
(addressing the entire cast) want you to know, Simone appreciates you all working for scale
But why am  thanking you
Simone can thank you herself
She insisted on speaking with you before filming begins
She's on the line now
Viktor nods to a speaker phone in the center of the table, a red blinking light on the phone
The cast reacts excitedly
(pushing a button on the phone) Simone, are you there
(through the speakerphone) certainly am, Mr
Taransky
(unable to contain her excitement) So are we, Simone
Everyone laughs giddily
(
) Why don't you leave me alone with my co-stars, Mr
Taransky, so we can get to know each other better
Good idea
Of course
'll be back in a minute
Viktor exits
(
) Hi
Who's there
Don't be shy
Introduce yourselves
The  stares nervously at the speakerphone
Mac breaks the silence
'm Mac
turned down a Bertolucci film to be here
My name's Lotus
God,  can't believe 'm talking to you
We're going to become such great friends
'm Hal
Wonderful to be working together
again
The other cast members introduce themselves
'  - pulls up sharply in his studio golf cart outside the nearby soundstage and hurriedly enters
'  - races across the vast, empty space to a digital player, connected to a phone
Simone's pre-recorded opening remarks (graphically represented on the screen) are almost completed
Is that everyone
(pause) Well, obviously, as you know
Viktor jumps into the conversation in the nick of time, speaking through the synthesizer
As usual, Viktor's voice is automatically synthesized into the voice of Simone
/ 'm Simone
The other   laugh nervously
(from Viktor's speakerphone) Obviously
Who else
/ (from speaker phone) just want to start by apologizing for my "process" -- & '  - The  are hunched over the speakerphone
-- No
No
'm completely simpatico
On my last film  was playing a schizophrenic so  made them give me two dressing rooms
(an aside) So committed
(
) Well thank you for your understanding
know it's an unusual way to work but  just find relate better to people when they're not actually there
Of course, of course
(
) don't have much to say except that  know it's going to be a great project, if we all just trust Mr
Taransky's vision
Always do what Mr
Taransky says
If in doubt, do it the Taransky way
They all nod vigorously in agreement
(
) know we're going to make a wonderful movie together
(nodding in agreement) Wonderful movie
Together, absolutely
- removes his own garbage from his soundstage
young cleaning woman, , wheeling a janitor's cart, tentatively approaches
Mr
Taransky
(referring to the stage) No one goes in there
Oh,  know
Vivian hesitantly hands Viktor a publicity photo of
If it's not too much trouble
Could you
Of course
(hesitant about broaching the subject) This last year  was
going through some things
(shaking her head at the memory) Awful, awful
things
But when saw Simone in "Sunrise"
what she did
in the scene in the fireworks factory
(face lighting up) suddenly everything made sense
My friends, family, doctors -- nobody could reach me -- but Simone, she really
spoke to me
Viktor is touched by the heartfelt testimony
She'll be happy to sign it
- green set
Walls, floor, ceiling -- all green shoots , dressed in a futuristic suit, tentatively crossing the green expanse
Hal pauses, looks longingly, then impulsively dashes forward
Hal passionately embraces thin air and wrestles it to the ground
(
) Cut
Cut
Cut
Hal freezes
runs from behind the camera and confronts Hal on the green floor
Hal, what are you doing
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene
He has to touch her
He has to
Absolutely not
But she's right there
must feel her
You can't
Why not
(struggling to find an excuse) There's
a wall between you -- -- an emotional wall,  know
That's why -- -- No
No
real wall
(describing a wall with his hands within the green space) You ran right through it
(confused) How did the wall get there
can't explain it to you now -- you'll see when it's all put together
(walking away) Anyway, we got it a couple of takes ago
Let's move on
Hal, dumbfounded, tentatively touches the non-existent wall
'  - Viktor digitally adds  standing beside a sportscar with in a scene from "Eternity Forever"
He works on her close up
(eyes welling with tears) -- What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love is like a wild flower, but that flower only grows -- Viktor hits  and Simone freezes
Viktor brings up a menu and chooses from a range of " "

Let's take it down a notch
-- What you don't understand -- Simone freezes again
Viktor make another adjustment
like it
But still too big
(making a correction) Smaller teardrops next time
Simone's tears retreat into her eyes
It's not working
It's not alive
Let's try it again
She repeats the line
Viktor mimes the performance
(teardrops arriving on cue) -- What you don't understand, Clyde, is that love is like a wild flower, but that flower only grows on the edge
(dramatic pause) of a very high cliff
Simone
Perfect, Simone
Viktor returns  to her neutral background
'm only sorry you still have to work with flesh and blood for the time being -- as user friendly as you are, even  can't manufacture an entire cast
"To Vivian
Love, Simone" --  writes on the publicity shot
He applies lipstick and adds a kiss to the photo
Viktor wipes his mouth and looks to  on his screen -- she is waiting patiently, as usual
We are going to have to change our plans, Simone -- you have no idea what an affect your performance is having on people
We can't stop now
There's too much to say -- these films they speak, they speak to the human condition
We're changing lives
No, revealing the truth now would be too cruel
(searching for more justification) Anyway, when you're seeking a greater truth -- in the work -- you are not so concerned with the lesser truths along the way
Simone doesn't appear convinced
/ You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr
Taransky
(irritated at her pricking his conscience) Why do you have to bring that up
There's always risk -- life's a risk
It's worth it
Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime
(regarding her tenderly) Well,  think we've done enough for today
You've been cooped up in there too long
How about you and me go out on the town
They're expecting us
He turns to a copy of "The Echo"
photo of Viktor at the gate of his Malibu home
"   - Self proclaimed Svengali Keeps Star Out Of Limelight"
Viktor puts Simone to sleep and picks up a briefcase
- , briefcase in hand, strides through the lobby of an opulent hotel
He approached the
'm checking in a special guest
(obviously conspiratorial) Miss Enomis
The Concierge straightens as he recognizes Viktor from a copy of "Variety"
Headline: "Taransky Rides Ingenue's Coat-Tails To Three Picture Deal"
Miss Enomis, yes
Miss Enomis demands her privacy
You will switch off all surveillance cameras
will escort Miss Enomis to her room alone via the rear exit
She will require no help with her luggage
She does not wish to be disturbed at any time for any reason
She will be departing for a function tonight at eight sharp
(tipping him with a hundred dollar bill) 'm sure  can rely on your discretion
Do you understand
(passing the key to Viktor) Oh,  understand
As Viktor departs, the Concierge holds the registration card to the mirror
becomes
The Concierge picks up his phone
- enters the hotel suite
We see a montage of scenes -- Viktor revelling in his masquerade
)   pulls down the covers of a bed and rolls around in the sheets to give it a slept-in look
)   sprays cologne in the bed
)   tosses skimpy lingerie on the floor of the closet
)   eats several candy bars from the mini-bar
)   puts one of his own movies in the  player
)   writes a note on the bedside pad
)  In the bathroom, shower running,  attempts to open a tampon -- it shoots out of the applicator like a penny rocket
)   cuts a lock of "faux" hair from a Simone wig and scatters it on the counter
)   shakes open a bag of toiletries, the toothbrush bouncing into the toilet bowl
He retrieves it
)   looks through the drapes of the hotel window -- a jam of   has congregated outside the rear entrance
)   shines a lamp against a doll casting a life-size shadow on the drapes
"walking" silhouette is visible to the media on the street
)   writes a message in lipstick on the mirror -- " --"
is interrupted by a knock on the door
He looks at his watch
(peering through the peephole) Who is it
' (from other side of door) It's
Simone
Viktor smiles
-   - stands at the rear entrance of the hotel with a leggy wearing a coat over her head keeps back the growing horde of
Viktor's limousine waits at the curb
The coated woman starts towards the car but Viktor holds her back
Not yet
(scrutinizing the crowd) Where's "Matinee"
There they are
Okay,  think everyone's here
Now
Viktor and the young woman run the gauntlet to the car, providing a perfect albeit restricted photo-op for the paparazzi
1 Simone
Over here, sweetheart
3 Come one Simone, take it off, baby
4 We got a job to do
The car door slams shut as the pack descends
and are amongst the frustrated reporters
The limo screeches away

His assistant, , begins to collect "evidence" of the celebrity -- dusting for fingerprints, etc
Max rubs pencil into the impression on the bedside notepad revealing the message -- "The meaning of life is that it ends"

Milton and the Concierge depart
Max is alone
He looks around the room

He picks up a drinking glass and inspects it closely before placing it in a sealed plastic bag

)   picks up the used toothbrush, puts it to his lips before placing it in a plastic bag
)   gently places his hands on the toilet seat

He carefully removes a slip from a pillow
He folds it meticulously, appearing to breathe in its scent as he places it in a plastic bag
)  Finally,  kneels and gazes at "Simone's" unmade bed
He slowly slides into the bed and slips beneath the same sheets recently vacated by Viktor
-    - , ear pressed against the door, tries to listen inside
'  - and the   have finally left the in their wake
Viktor gently removes the coat from over her head
Although the woman is impossible beautiful, she is not Simone
is Simone's latest stand-in and decoy
Viktor and Faith are still pressed together against one side of the limousine
(not quite able to avert his eyes from her telescopic legs) Thank God for you, Faith
know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in
You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals
No, thank God for you, Mr
Taransky
How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman
Neither Viktor nor Faith seem inclined to move from their intimate position
You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er
(his nose close to Faith's neck) scent
Of course
(meeting her gaze) You look so, so
so much like her
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right
do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr
Taransky
Their lips are now tantalizingly close
Viktor
'   - '  hits the sofa in his living room, closely followed by  on top of him
Faith tears at his clothes and her own, ravenous
Viktor hardly resists
In the midst of the wild caresses, Faith murmurs in his ear
Do whatever you do to Simone
Viktor freezes
What
What did you say
Do what you do to Simone
What  do to Simone
Yes, call me Simone
Simone
(still tearing at his clothes) Yes, yes, again, again
Do what you do to Simone
want to know what it's like to be her just for one night
(confused) You're with me to be close to her
(panting) Is that a problem
As Viktor ponders the question, Faith begins to do Simone's deathbed speech from "Sunrise, Sunset"
"Why are we here
Is that what you're asking, Jack
Why are we here
No why
Just here"
(this is too much for Viktor) Please put your clothes on Viktor gets up from the sofa, leaving the frustrated Faith to straighten her clothes
- " " - The finished scene with  and  plays
-  - watches the rough cut of " " with and daughter,
As usual, they are mesmerized by the breath-taking beautiful
The scene ends
The light go up
Stunning, Viktor
The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up
Thank you
(turning to his daughter) What did you think, Lainey
One thing bothered me
know, Hal is as stiff as always
No, not that
was just wondering -- in the bedroom scene in reel two why did Simone have no reflection when she walked in front of that mirror
Viktor is shocked, busted
He covers it with a laugh
(ashen-faced) wondered if you'd spot that
You've got a good eye, Lainey
'm proud of you
Elaine looks at Viktor for an explanation
got them to remove the reflection
The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead
That's genius, Viktor
Was that Simone's idea
(sarcastic, annoyed at the suggestion) Who else
It's always Simone's idea
(not quite convinced) So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six
Precisely
- escorts  and  to Elaine's car parked outside the theater
(as she gets into the car) Good-night, Daddy
(kissing Lainey good-bye) Night, Lainey
Elaine and Viktor linger a moment outside the car
(drawing Elaine aside) Elaine,  don't know if it's a good idea for Lainey to come to the screenings -- mature content and all that
Both look to Lainey
From inside the car Lainey watches her parents
(impressed by his responsible attitude) Maybe you're right
(gently teasing) Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father
Better late than never
(softening) should fire you more often
The film's looking wonderful
You really think so
Yes
To be honest  never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- think it's really going to mean something
Thank you
'll tell Simone you liked it
'd love to tell her myself
(cajoling) When are you going to let me meet her
Soon
Soon
Everyone  know has met her, Viktor
Everyone you know is lying
(amused) That's true
They instinctively kiss, more affectionate than before
However, their embrace is interrupted by a click of a camera shutter from a nearby bush
Damnit
The  has gone but so has the mood
You know how you can stop that
She has to get out more
(climbing into the car) See you at the premiere
Elaine climbs into her car and drives away
- The premiere for " " is everything  had hoped for ", "
Red carpet, klieg lights searching the sky, screaming  and
limousine pulls up, door opens and  steps out
The crowd screams with excitement
Viktor waves
Am expectancy in the crowd -- people crane their necks, waiting for someone else to step out of the open car door
but nothing
The door shuts
disappointed murmer
The limo drives off
walks down the carpet to little fanfare
1 (talking to camera) -- What a night
Anyone who's anyone is here at the premiere of "Eternity Forever," but waiting for Simone to show may take even longer
We do have her director, Viktor Taransky
(ushering him over) Viktor, Viktor, is Simone coming
(slightly irritated by the focus on the star) You know Simone
Other reporters force their way into the interview
2 hope she does show up
Some of her fans got here at dawn
We don't want to disappoint them
(through a pained smile) Well, 'm sure they're going to love the movie
got the inspiration -- However, the reporter's attention has strayed
2 The  pivot away from Viktor
Screen idol, , is walking up the carpet
2 Harry
Harry
Can we have a minute
What brings you here tonight
(waving to the fans) just came out to support my good friend, Simone
2 There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"
(slightly irritated by the invasion) We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private
2 (believing she has a scoop) Do  hear the sound of
wedding bells
(suddenly losing it) can't believe you people
No wonder she never comes to these things
Harry angrily pushes the camera away and strides up the carpet
watches him go, flabbergasted
- packed, glitzy party
enters without an escort
Despite his recent rise to prominence he appears strangely alone
He observes , champagne in hand, and the younger , schmoozing with a group of industry  and
/ Elaine
The picture is a revelation
Thank you
mean, it was a team effort -- Viktor cannot resist taking Elaine's photo with a small pocket camera
Elaine is unaware of the shot
Viktor turns away -- just as Elaine turns to look at him
Viktor picks up a drink from the bar
, perched unsteadily on a nearby barstool, is knocking back Jack Daniels
She accidentally brushes one of her discarded glasses off the bar
Viktor catches it
taps Viktor on the shoulder
stands there accompanied by his "Eternity Forever" co-star,
Is she here
'm fine, Hal
How are you
(oblivious to his sarcasm) Somebody said she was here
Mac spots the two glasses in Viktor's hands -- one glass lipstick-smeared
Oh my God, that's her glass
(impulsively smelling "Simone's" glass) Jack Daniels, straight-up
She is my kind of woman
(looking anxiously around the room) Viktor, where is she
She's around
(dawning on him, glancing to the far side of the packed room) Jesus, Hal
she's in the Ladies Room
You know  sometimes forget she has bodily functions
(unable to resist) know what you mean
(anxiously looking to the restroom) have to talk to her about my experimental film
It's very
experimental
Is that her
-- By the fountain
Far across the party, a , with a Simone-type hairstyle, her back to us, is standing at the edge of a fountain
(testy) No
In fact, between us, she doesn't really exist
(ignoring him, calling out to the woman) Simone
Several nearby , including , overhear
They talk over each other
1 -- Simone's here
(slightly the worse for drink) -- When did she arrive
Why didn't someone tell me
2 -- Where is she
-- She's by the fountain
3 -- Simone, over here
4 -- Simone
The rumor races through the party like wild-fire
The surge towards the fountain in a wave of mindless adoration
The Simone lookalike herself spins around
Simone
She gets knocked into the fountain
Several other also fall in the stampede
Back at the bar, the , autograph book in hand, deserts his station
Viktor is left alone with the drunk woman
The limousines outside the hotel ballroom have been replaced with ambulances
tend to , bloodied and battered in the stampede caused by Simone's "appearance"
(into microphone) -- Forget "Eternity Forever", the big news tonight was the surprise appearance of Simone
Even these seen-it-all superstars are apparently not immune to Simone fever and the resulting stampede forced organizers to bring the event to an early end
spoke with some of the departing guests about their encounter with Hollywood's most reluctant superstar
of interviews with  bruised
3 --  would say, even more beautiful in person, you have to see her to believe her
1 --  can't reveal what we spoke about
It was
personal
Simone and  go back a long way
1 -- When she talks to you, for that moment, you are the only other human being in the room
2 (dress torn) --  really don't know what the fuss is about
So over-rated
She's done one film
Talk to me when she's had the kind of career 've had
2 --  do expect her to be nominated, yes
We return to the live shot of the
Fortunately, Simone was not amongst the injured and was spirited away as mysteriously as she arrived
- Max Sayer's car is parked outside of the Echo Building
- In the  war room,   is agitated
He paces back and forth, railing at a table of cowering
-- She goes to a major, Hollywood, -list party and we don't get an interview, a comment, we don't even get a photograph
Is that what you're telling me
Nobody got a photograph
Nobody ever gets a photograph
We've got our best people on it, Mr
Sayer
24-hour tail on Taransky
Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take
But this Simone woman is good
(referring to a "Confidential" report) Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity, travels under a false name, checks into hotels with an alias
She never stays in the same place two nights in a row
Anything on the satellite photos
(irritated) What about the fingerprints
What happened when we dusted that hotel suite
holds up a glass taken from the hotel
Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints
but none of hers
(interest piqued) Which means they're significant
(beat) Incriminating
(beat) Perhaps, criminal
(getting excited) She's hiding her past
She's hiding her past
Max ponders the revelation
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure
You know  had something on Mother Teresa
But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore
(approaching a computer) know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood
(impressed) My God, you've got one
(offering Milton a seat in front of the computer) will when you're finished writing it
hesitates, questioning his journalistic ethics
(disappointed in his protege) Am  wasting my time with you
When she sues to protect her privacy, she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it
(under his breath) Long live the First Amendment
Sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth
(to his nervous photographer) As for a photo -- if you can't do it,  know twelve million people who can

runs towards the door, throwing himself between the door and the executives
-- You can't go in there
-- We have to talk to her, Viktor
1 -- We know she's in there
Viktor glares at the   who shrugs weakly
(struggling to hold them back) -- Why
What's all this about
2 (waving a spreadsheet) -- We've got the tracking numbers for "Eternity Forever"
3 -- They're in the toilet
-- She has to get out there and sell the film
-- What do you want her to do, go door-to-door --
1 -- Even Garbo would be on the talk show circuit if she was alive today
(irritated) -- It's precisely because she doesn't crave the limelight that people love her
told you, she's only about the work
3 -- This is over-shadowing the work
2 (waving the front page of The Echo) That's the problem
She's more famous for her no-shows than her shows
-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor
(trying to squeeze past Viktor) If you can't handle her,  will
(blocking her path) Not now
She's emotional
Her mother dies today
Scene forty-two of "Good For Nothing"
It's not a good time
Elaine and the executives are not convinced, they overpower Viktor
No
Please, don't go in there
Too late
Elaine and the suits force the lock and enter
'  - and the  stop in their tracks -- confronted with the surreal sight of the lone computer station in the vast soundstage
desperate  catches up with them
1 Where is she
2 She's not here
Elaine
Elaine wanders over to the idle computer with a knowing smile
So, the secret's finally out, Viktor
--  can explain
--  don't think that's necessary
think it's perfectly clear should have guessed -- it all makes sense now
it's why she never goes anywhere, never seen in public
Viktor lowers his head, resigned to his fate
She's into computers
Viktor looks up
1 (nodding in agreement) Probably spends her whole life in chat rooms
2 It's the one place she can be herself
3 Anonymous
Viktor seizes on the opportunity
(adopting a serious tone) It's worse than you think
She's extremely agoraphobic -- has a morbid fear of people and germs
In a way 'm relieved you
found out
The Executives are taken aback by the shocking revelation
The premiere was the first time 've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares
(concerned) Viktor, you should have said something
She doesn't want pity
(seeing a new side of Viktor) You're so good to protect her like this
Viktor shrugs modestly
(to the Executives, conceding) 'll tell you what
know how much this means to you
'll try to get her to plug the film
(beat) 'm not promising anything but maybe she'll do a talk show -- taped
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor
'll try
Maybe live but remote
She'll never go to them
1 We understand
Thank you, Viktor
2 Give her our best
Satisfied, the Executives make their way out of the soundstage
1 (aside to a colleague) That agoraphobia -- it's like a plague
2 It's out of control in Europe
Viktor and Elaine are left alone
'm sorry  didn't get a chance to introduce you to Simone at the premiere
There wasn't time with the riot and everything
(picking up a framed photo from the work station) But she wanted you to have this
The photograph shows , slightly inebriated at the premiere,  standing slightly behind her
She was there
She didn't by any chance happen to mention me
She said you were very beautiful
(flattered) Really
(blurting out) Elaine, what are you doing tonight
Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner
'd love to
But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone
Oh, yes
Of course
Don't always
Viktor watches Elaine make her way back to her studio cart
Viktor realizes he is still holding a copy of the National -- the headline, " "
Accompanied by a photo of intrepid reporter - An unattended shopping cart, at the end of the frozen foods aisle, begins to mysteriously roll towards us
We discover , pulling the cart with fishing line, while at the same time shooting it with a video camera
- Viktor's home video of the shopping cart plays on a
However, now  is pushing the cart
She wears sunglasses, her hair in curlers under a scarf
Simone takes a Swanson Chicken Pot Pie out of a cabinet
then a box of cereal off a display
- watches the video in his office, enraptured
He rewinds the tape and replays the moment
She likes Apple Jacks
just like me
Assistant  enters
He looks ill
Mr
Sayer
(irritated at being interrupted) What do you want --
Mr
Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet
(never averting his eyes from the screen) -- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too
Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism
We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event
Do you realize what we have here
We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence
We used to
Max's head snaps around
(holding a copy of the Times Calendar section - "Simone Live") She's doing Frank Brand on Thursday
Max coughs
Get out
The opening credits to "  ", a global cable show plays against a starscape -- images of famous politicians and world leaders interviewed by Frank
(to camera) Tonight on Frank Brand Live -- '  - ,  and  watch the  interview in Elaine's mansion with eager anticipation
-- Since taking the nation by storm with her debut movie, "Sunrise, Sunset"
'  -   - and assistant  are also glued to their set
no one's managed to land a live interview with the fabulous, new shooting starlet, Simone
until now

When he touches his hair, bats his eyes, moves his hands -- so does Simone
frantically tests several different backgrounds behind from a library of images

Ritzy hotel suite
Moonscape
Factory
/ Make up your mind, Viktor
Make up your mind
He settles on the desert location
He also make a last-second change to Simone's wardrobe -- selecting "- "
- talks to camera
'm happy to say she's agreed to join us tonight from the set of her new film
(turning to the monitor) Welcome, Simone
The just-completed image of  appears on Brand's monitor
Wonderful to be with you, Frank
'  - , referring to Simone, forgetting or not caring that Elaine is in the room
She is all woman
shoots her mother's boyfriend a withering look
She gets up and leaves the room
During the interview we cut between Frank Brand's studio, Viktor's soundstage and various viewer locations including Elaine's mansion, Max Sayer's office and various worldwide locations -- )   lone   gazing at a Watchman
)     watching  in a capsule hotel room
)     watching  in the Vatican
- Well, no one could accuse you of being over-exposed, Simone
Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight
(shrugs) just think actors talk too much
Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday
Of course, the only problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract more
is in his element, his effeminate gestures frighteningly convincing
(from ) Don't  know it
That's the only reason 'm here now -- to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr
Taransky's film
You don't secretly want the attention
'm not even sure  deserve it
After tonight 'll have almost as much screen time on your show as do in my movies
How is that healthy for a performer
'  - has turned her back on the  screen, preferring to look through a book
(from ) Because, you have to understand, Frank, these interviews -- none of this is real
Who  am on screen and who  really am are two totally different people
Who are you really
That's a good question
(beat) As Nietzsche said, "Whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else
" (reading from a bookmarked page, along with Simone) "
he ends up finding it is difficult to be himself again
" Well put
Lainey regards the name written on the inside page -- "Viktor Taransky"
'  -   - playing in the background,  and  are hurriedly leafing through travel books and scrutinizing maps
(focusing on the desert background behind Simone) know where that is
know
- Change of topic
Simone, you've been romantically linked to dozens of men in the press -- Mick Jagger, Stephen Hawking, Fidel Castro
and most recently Viktor Taransky
Is there a Mr
Right in there somewhere
'd rather not discuss my private life
(gently) But Viktor and  are inseparable
'  - 's face drops, slightly hurt
You dog, Viktor
(from ) literally wouldn't be here today without him
'  - accidentally taps his finger on the keyboard in his excitement -- the cursor aimed at "" command
' start to well with tears -- a tear spills from her eye
Would you like a moment, Simone
Viktor notices, quickly withdrawing his finger -- his startled expression instantly imitated by Simone
No, 'm okay
- Let's talk about the work that you care so much about
Sure
Where would you like to start
How about the nudity
Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank
For me, clothes are just an option
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects
(unable to resist a smile) suppose the thing  like most about the movies 'm in is that they're not about special effects
Frank nods sagely
They're better for it if  may say
'  - The smile is suddenly wiped off 's face by a blinking alert: The pixels that form  start to break up
Curiously, it is only Simone and not the background that is disintegrating
- (regarding the screen) Well, we appear to be experiencing satellite difficulties
In case we lose you, Simone,  want to thank you -- '  - speaks again, his voice suddenly deeper
/ Thank
,
In horror Viktor hurriedly pulls the plug
The feed goes blank on Frank Brand's screen
slumps over his computer in exhaustion
Since is still synced to his movements, the partially de-pixelated Simone also slumps
Viktor's cell phone rings
Viktor picks up
/ Hel-- He remembers at the last second to switch off his voice synthesizer
(into phone) Hello
'  - We cut between the two sides of the conversation --  on the phone,  still watching post-interview analysis on the -- Viktor, are you with her
Is she there
No
An anxious beat
Are you and Simone
(blurting it out) getting married
(taken aback by the suggestion) No, of course not
(realizing the significance of the question) Why
Would you care if we were
(covering, realizing she has given herself away) Well, yes
From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single
(quick change of topic) Anyhow,  thought she came across great tonight
Intelligent, well informed, a natural
And touching
She was spectacular
Thank you
pause
Viktor, do you realize you always do that
Do what
Whenever  compliment Simone, you take the credit
do
Yes, you do
(shrug) Anyway, tonight was a good start
Excuse me
Start
It's a crowded summer
We need every photo-opp, sound-byte and column inch we can get
Good night, Viktor
Elaine hangs up
Lainey approaches
(carefully broaching the subject) Mom, do you miss Dad
(she thinks) Sometimes
But, just when  think your father's changing for the better,  realize he's as self absorbed as ever
He took the credit for Simone tonight
Lainey, coming to her father's defense, glancing at the Nietzsche book in her hand
think Dad deserves more credit than he gets
'  - watches  on screen
He is unusually anxious
As usual  is wearing a skimpy, provocative outfit as she awaits instructions on the screen
For some reason Viktor becomes irritated by the image
(to Simone) Will you cover yourself up
He hits a button
thick   clicks over her body
- The  newscar streaks through the bronze and purple desert
and his assistant  emerge from the car
-- 've been here before
-- On my honeymoon with my ex-wife
Is that why she left you
Max holds a video print of  giving her interview
He compares her desert location to the one in front of him
(pointing out a Joshua tree) You see, that's the exact same tree and in the distance, there's the
(voice trailing away) mountain
Sure enough, the Joshua tree is identical but the mountain is now obscured by a ten-story Holiday Inn
Max and Milton are mystified -- they look back at the photo
It's a hotel
don't understand
Could they have built that hotel since yesterday
Max shakes his head, deeply concerned
Get in the car
'  - has transformed his soundstage into a one-man publicity machine
The floor is littered with photographs of in various states of dress and undress
Using a sophisticated Photoshop computer program, constructs magazine spreads out of numerous previous magazine spreads -- "Time", "People", "Us", "Life", "Popular Mechanics"
(angrily into phone) -- We don't do the photo shoot, you don't get the cover
written answers to written questions, that's right
website interviews, no problem
Viktor calls up a " "
Choosing from a , a   and a  , he removes Simone's head and places it on the body of the ballerina
She begins to dance for him
He uses a program to construct childhood photographs of and other childhood memorabilia
He employs backgrounds from numerous on-line library sources
With a quick cut and paste he is able to place Simone on a beach in San Tropez or a bicycle factory in Calcutta
(muttering to himself) You want exposure, Elaine
'll give you over-exposure
'  -  - watches  in her office
She cannot change channels without finding Simone sitting in a chair giving generic answers
-  ( ' ) think "Eternity Forever" is my finest work
'm most proud of my work in "Eternity Forever"
think people are going to love "Eternity Forever"
'  - inspects a cut-out photograph of Simone in " " costume
He speaks to the photo
Forgive me, Simone
- The photograph of Simone is emblazoned on a fast food drink cup -- a pyramid of cups promoting " " Happy Meals
Beneath the plastic pyramid is a  action figure in a convertible
'    - " "
Screams the banner headline in "Variety"
$$$ -  6TH Shouts the "Hollywood Reporter"
The trade papers sit on the coffee table in front of who reclines on a leather sofa, watching , gazing lovingly at Simone
-  ( ' ) Of course, being a movie star is wonderful, but  have so many other ways  want to express myself -- - Various book titles are on display: "'   " ": - The  of " "' 101   " - banner in a window reads
"In Stock: ' - "
Mannequins model the clothes
'  - We focus on the screen where  types in instructions: : " 1  -  / " : " 40 " list of the Number 1 hits for the last forty years promptly appears on the screen along with photographs of the artists -- ,  ,  ,  , ,  , , etc
Beneath the title of each song is a graphic representation of the music -- "" and ""
Viktor presses a button: ""
The audio waves converge
'  - , wearing headphones, records his composite pop song
As usual when he sings into his microphone, Simone also sings
The catchy song is titled: "(If You Can't Believe In Yourself) Believe In Me"
- The video for 's song plays on the video wall inside the record store
, buying 's, dance adoringly in front of the screen, unaware that they are gyrating to the vocals of a middle-aged man
- "(If You Can't Believe In Yourself) Believe In Me" shoots up the Billboard charts
- on the name "" painted on the stern of a luxury yacht
is at the helm, breathing in the clean air -- at last a moment to savor his success
Simone's hit single plays on the yacht's stereo
He looks at peace
- has his arm around , having his photograph taken
However, we discover that the Simone is only a lifesize cardboard cutout used by a   to sell snapshots
He also has cardboard cutouts of the  and and  walk by
Tying up his boat, 's mood is abruptly shattered by the sight of Max and Milton walking down the pier towards him
Nice boat, Taransky
It's a yacht
know what you're up to
(pushing past Max) don't have time for this, Sayer
think you do
(holding up his video print of Simone in the desert) know it's a fake
Viktor freezes
Got your attention now
Max compares the shot to one of the current desert location with the Holiday Inn in front of the mountain
(referring to the photographs) It's bogus
You used an old library shot for the background
(ashen) The background is
She was never in New Mexico
She never left the studio
Viktor is relieved that Max is only accusing him of faking the background
(referring to a large bundle of other shots under his arm) 've done my homework
've studied her
--  bet you have
-- 've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio
(afterthought) Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail
But  have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts
know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her
'm keeping it in trust
know that's what you'd like us to believe
But  got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter
Not to mention abduction
Abduction
don't buy the whole recluse scam
How are you doing it
What is it -- drugs
Blackmail
Mind-control
All three
What do you do -- keep her locked in a box somewhere
Viktor flinches at the remark
What is it exactly you want, Sayer
want to see her
Unless you show me Simone live and in person  show these pictures to the authorities
Viktor pauses, considering the threat
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal
Er,
good
That's good
Viktor walks away leaving Max confused
The breeze whips the photos of  out of Max's hands and into the sea
- vast, empty stadium
On the stage, a lone microphone
approaches, gazing out at the vast arena
Several and  join him
All ready, Mr
Taransky
This time tomorrow night, she'll be standing right here in front of a packed house
We could have sold it out twenty times
Viktor nods
Soundcheck went perfect
Laser show ready to go
(cautionary note) gotta say, you ordered an awful lot of smoke
That's the way she likes it
The Promoter glancing to the area in front of the stage, where a barrier has been erected
After what you told us about the death threats, the security guards are under strict instructions never to take their eyes off the crowd
Excellent
Viktor hands each man a headshot of  signed with a kiss
Simone wanted you to have these
(visibly moved by the gesture) Wish her luck from us
Oh,  will
(afterthought) Remember, no cameras, no binoculars
- In the shadow of the enormous stadium sits a control truck/tour bus, satellite dishes on the roof -- the lights from the laser-show inside the arena play off the truck
The control truck shakes from the stomping of the crowd
-
-
-
The door to the truck is marked, " - Splendid Isolation Tour
"
-  - sits alone at the mixing panel of a control truck
On his monitors, a sea of humanity, chanting

Viktor produces the " " hard-drive from his jacket pocket and inserts it into the computer
appears on the monitor
Let's get you into hair and make up
Simone's hair rapidly grows in a number of styles, eyelashes grow and are trimmed, eyeshadow of various shades paints across the lids
Wardrobe
Viktor tries several outfits on Simone -- the clothes appearing to fabricate themselves on her body
He settles for the most provocative outfit
Finger poised over the keyboard, Viktor glances to a monitor showing -- -  - and  amongst the crowd, clapping their hands, stomping their feet and chanting
-  - Easier to make one hundred thousand believe than just one
He scrolls to a program, marked "" and pushes the "" key
-   - Smoke fills the stage
strobe light show plays
booming is heard
Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor Taransky Promotions is proud to present, live on stage, for the debut concert of the "Splendid Isolation" tour, the one, the only, -
spotlight falls on the solitary figure of Simone, standing alone on the stage with a guitar over her shoulder (the only accompaniment) -- dwarfed by the huge stage
However, on closer inspection, the spotlight is actually a laser beam creating a hologram
Clouds of smoke and strobe lighting aid the illusion
The only clear view of Simone for the audience is provided by the enormous video screens on either side of the stage
The stares up at the jumbotrons, blissfully unaware that they are watching a pre-recorded event
Some watch the event on portable TVs

For a moment Viktor is in awe of his own wizardry -- the grand illusionist
Viktor is at the height of his powers
(to the image of Simone on his screen) don't know about you, Simone, but 've never felt more alive
He snaps back to reality just in time to notice that the Simone hologram beam has wandered through her own microphone stand
Damn
He adjusts the beam -- the rapturous crowd, transfixed by the screen, apparently fails to notice
-  - We focus on a face in the crowd --
His journalistic assignment temporarily forgotten, Max is singing along and waving his arms, tears rolling down his face, swept up in the moment

He is interrupted by a knock at the door
Viktor irritably opens it

(face brightening) My two favorite girls
Lainey and  just wanted to congratulate
Regarding Viktor closely, Elaine's smile evaporates
Simone
She's lying down
She's exhausted
(suddenly cool) can imagine
Viktor is confused by their reaction
Elaine yanks Lainey away
Thank Simone for the tickets
(calling back as she is led away) It was a great show, Dad
Viktor waves disconcertedly
Where are you
going
As he returns to the trailer, Viktor catches sight of his lipstick-smeared mouth in the mirror on the inside of the trailer door
He slams the side of the trailer in frustration
'  - paces back and forth in front of her  showing re- runs of the  concert
cannot take his eyes off the screen
can't believe she's doing this -- taking advantage of him this way
It's cruel
Why
Obviously, this can't last
She's going to dump him
Viktor won't be able to take that
He's too sensitive
It'll destroy him
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor
(not hearing) have to talk to her
Kent switches off the
've been meaning to talk to you
Behind the open door, we find  eavesdropping

Hey, Lainey
(gently teasing her) How's your love life
do okay
How about you
You know me -- married to my work
noticed
An awkward silence
Dad, you know  don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now
She broke up with Kent
(buoyed by the news) Really
Too bad
She thinks you're with Simone
Lainey, you know Simone and  don't have a real relationship
know but Mom doesn't
Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out
(shrug) Dinner, maybe
Dinner
Dinner's difficult phone call
Too impersonal
They have to meet face-to-face
'll see what  can do
(a thought occurs) You know, Lainey
don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone
Don't you like her
love her but that doesn't mean need to meet her
Viktor is confused
Why
So  can tell my friends at school -- as if that validates my life somehow
What's Simone going to say to a fourteen-year-old anyhow
She's going to be polite because you're my father but we're not suddenly going to become friends -- we have nothing in common
It's not going to be real
Anyhow, she gets more beautiful in my head every day
Why kill the dream
What do they say, "don't get too close to your idols, they always disappoint you"
Viktor gazes in wonder at his daughter, so much wiser than her years
love you, Lainey
love you too, daddy
car horn sounds outside the house
That's Mom
(kissing him on the forehead) See you
She exits, leaving Viktor deep in thought
- Milli Vanilli's "   ' " plays on a car radio
, wearing a red power suit, drives home along the freeway in bumper-to-bumper traffic
Her car phone rings
She turns down the radio and picks up
Hello
Hello, is this Elaine
Yes -- oh my, God
Is that you, Simone
've been wanting to talk to you
Well, here  am
(beat) You look pretty today
Red suits you
(looking around the freeway) Where are you
Right beside you
borrowed Viktor's car
Elaine looks to the inside lane
, wearing sunglasses, phone to her ear, drives alongside
Simone waves, somewhat mechanically
Elaine waves back
They keep driving as they talk
'  - The sunglasses-clad  is a mannequin, seated in the driver's seat with her left hand on the phone obscuring her mouth, right hand attached to the steering wheel
Seat fully-reclined on the passenger side,  drives the car by stretching a foot across to the pedals and steering with one hand, occasionally sneaking a glance to the road ahead
He speaks on a phone through the Simone synthesizer
/ 'd love to stop somewhere but 'm late
'm on my way to see Viktor now
No,  understand
That's what want to talk about
don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and  were married once
/ can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go
owe Viktor everything
think he owes more to you
But that's not important now
know what's going on between you two
/ want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and
(rueful smile) You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone
don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world
/ (breaking character) 'm not -- (correcting himself) He's not
Viktor, losing concentration on his driving, drifts across his lane, almost striking Elaine's car -- swerving back at the last second
My God, are you alright, Simone
/ Damn -- (struggling to stay in her/his lane) Yes --  -- (regaining control) -- 'm just a little tired
Listen, Elaine, Viktor and  -- it's strictly a working relationship
We could never be anything else
We're just so
different
Exactly
You're a household name now
You're moving in entirely different worlds
That's why hope you're not toying with Viktor
/ It sounds like you still have feelings for him
We have a daughter together just don't want to see Viktor get hurt
/ don't know how many times  have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and are not in love
(joking weakly) only make love to the camera
Simone,  recognize the shirt you're wearing
gave it to Viktor on his birthday
Over-correcting his steering, Viktor drifts into the next lane, dangerously close to a pick-up truck that has to swerve to avoid him
/ Christ -- (still struggling to stay on the road) Elaine,  know how it looks but
(blurting it out) it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars
If you won't do it for him, please do it for me
(reluctant, frightened by Simone's erratic driving) Okay -- for you
/ (sigh of relief) Thanks
This is my exit so,  -- 'm glad we talked
/ Good-bye
Viktor's car swerves to the right
Elaine looks back in her rearview mirror, concerned
Elaine just misses the sight of 's car rear-ending the truck in front of him
- anxiously watches a   writing up the fender-bender
However, the Patrolman is more interested in the Simone mannequin
You don't have to explain
know what the press is like
Lunatics
Out of control
(referring to the Simone mannequin) You do know 'm going to have to take this
-  - , in his tuxedo, sits in the front row of the packed auditorium beside an empty seat -- " for "
and  sit alongside --  and  nearby
stands at the transparent plastic podium with the "Best Actress" envelope
And the winner is
Hal tears the envelope's seal, momentarily confused as he reads the name
Actually, there's a tie
The  gasps
(milking the moment for all it's worth) The winners are
Simone for "Sunrise, Sunset"
The audience cheers enthusiastically, but Hal stills their applause
(big smile) and Simone for "Eternity Forever"
The audience erupts
Viktor accepts the congratulations of those around him
Unfortunately, Simone can't be with us tonight
(turning to the screen) But thanks to the miracle of modern technology she is able to join us live via satellite from the location of her new film
The screen flickers to life
-    - sits in a director's chair in the desolate wasteland location chosen by Viktor
Thank you
Thank you
This means so much to me
'm just sorry can't be there with you
(wiping away a tear) First off  have to acknowledge my fellow nominees --  don't even feel  belong in the best actress category let alone with these
wonderful human beings
(composing herself) also have to thank my co-stars, the studio, of course
But most of all,  have to thank the audience for supporting what  do -- you're the only reason 'm here
The  applauds wildly
is puzzled
She leans over to Viktor
Why didn't she thank you
(confused) She did
didn't she
(crestfallen) No
Viktor glances to the "Simone" sign beside him
The blood drains from his face
'  - On the monitor,  reads the forgotten line from the speech
And of course  must thank my collaborator, Viktor Taransky, without whom none of this would be possible
, still in his tuxedo, stares at  on the screen
He holds the text of Simone's acceptance speech in his hands
(to himself) It's written right there
Why didn't  say it
How could forget to say it
Simone stares back at him blankly
copy of  is slid under the soundstage door
The front page headline, "   - Simone Snubs Taransky At Oscars"
'  - pulls up to the gate of his Malibu home
is standing outside next to his car
Damn it
'   - also spies an   in a wheelchair sitting beside the car,  closeby
Viktor stops at the gate and reluctantly exits his car
What now, Sayer
(smug smile, noticing Viktor noticing the woman) Looks familiar, doesn't she
No one comes from nowhere, Taransky
You turn over enough rocks
The old woman appears drugged, stares into space
traced her to a nursing home young woman fitting Simone's description dropped her off five years ago
She looks a lot like you
(undeterred) She hasn't uttered a word that whole time -- until she saw the big show
Max produces a shot of  at the Oscars and holds it in front of the old lady
(pointing to Simone's picture, catatonic) My baby
My baby
(putting his hand on his heart) Who would think that "Saint Simone" would abandon her own mother
've been looking into the family history -- heartbreaking
Most likely a biography to run over four issues
who knows, maybe there's a Pulitzer in there somewhere
Viktor produces his own driver's license and holds it in front of the old lady
(pointing to Viktor's face on the driver's license) My baby
My baby
Max hastily steps between Viktor and the Old Lady
That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until  get a court order for a blood test
(sensing an opportunity) That won't be necessary
(pretending to be resigned) Sooner or later  knew you'd crack this thing, Max
You got me
do
(recovering) Sure  do
(taking Viktor aside) Can we speak off the record
'm a fair man
'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story
wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics
No
Thanks
Absolutely
Viktor regards the newshound with a look of pity
You love her, don't you, Max
Don't you
(writes a check, hands it to Max) This should take care of Mother
Viktor drives into his home
Max, very confused, stares at the old lady
'  - escorts , blindfolded, around the corner of his soundstage
He removes the blindfold
From Lainey's point- of-view we see the sportscar Simone drove in " " -- the car tied with a bow
Happy birthday, Lainey
Do you like it
(taking in the car) It's fantastic -- it's too much
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever"
know
Thank her for me
(disappointed by her reaction) It's from both of us
Of course you'll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit -- Lainey averts her gaze
--  can't accept it
don't want a car, Dad
(clearly hurt, not understanding) Why not
can get you something else
What do you want
The old Viktor Taransky
(finally blurting it out) liked you better before -- before all this
You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her
And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you
No, that was me
There you go again, blaming yourself
Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you
You deserve better than Simone
(hasty exit) 've got to go, Dad
Lainey
Viktor watches Lainey depart towards the studio gates
& '  - leans on his desk, still reflecting on 's remarks
enters
Ready for your casting session
Viktor nods distractedly
Jane shows in
Nicola's here for the role of Simone's sister
Viktor offers Nicola a seat, staring at her as if he has never truly looked at her before -- she has a quality of Simone
(slightly uncomfortable by Viktor's scrutiny) lot's happened since we last saw each other
(numb) Yes
never apologized properly for what happened on "Sunrise"
She hands Viktor a peace offering -- a large jar of Mike & Ike candy, including cherry
Thank you
It's not important
After  saw what Simone did with the role -- you know  fired all my people, went into rehab, took acting classes, changed my whole look
She really inspired me
Viktor continues to stare
(referring to the script in her hands) Would you like me to read
Yes, 'd like that
Nicola glances at the script a last time and puts it down
She approaches Viktor, standing close to him, playing the scene to him -- an immediate intimacy
(her angry words are in opposition to her amorous actions) -- Who do you think you are, Carlos -- coming in here like this
With my husband sleeping in the next room
Do you think  won't call out
Do you think  will just give in to you without a fight -- like the last time and the time before that
(she kisses his ear) wish you were dead
(she kisses his lips) wish we were both dead
Nicola immediately breaks character
Viktor is mesmerized -- he has fallen back in love with flesh
(finally able to speak) You know you're really very good
take back what  said
mean, you're really good
Thank you
(forgetting himself) You could play the lead
(confused) But that's Simone's part
Yes, of course it is
(gazing at her face) You know you have a line here
Not a wrinkle
Actually, more of a dimple
've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone
(incredulous) You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me
No, of course not, you're right
That would be crazy
Viktor sits back down and stares out of the window
Do you want me to do it again
Viktor does not reply
Nicola quietly leaves
'  - The front page of "Variety" is dominated by a large photograph of  giving her acceptance speech via satellite
However,  is gazing at a small inset picture of ,  and  arriving at the Oscar Ceremony
Elaine tears out the photo and slips it into her purse
-  ( ' ) Old home video of
She is in a garden by a swimming pool, laughing, waving and sweetly flirting with the camera
Elaine raises her skirt teasingly, winks, gestures the camera operator towards her with a beckoning finger, finally blows a kiss to the camera
'  - While the ever-seductive  waits patiently on-screen for Viktor's instructions,  is gazing at the smaller monitor -- the home video of
Viktor freezes the tape
Elaine appears particularly beautiful
Viktor electronically cuts out Elaine's mannerism and morphs it into Simone
Now Simone blows the kiss and has the same dazzling smile
& '  - At her desk,  is busy trying to mimic Simone's hairstyle as she talks on the phone
(into phone) -- Oh sure, she comes in all the time
we've become close
She told me -- enters the office
Jane -- Jane hurriedly hangs up
Gotta go
(picking up a pile of scripts from the in-tray) 'm leaving early tonight
If you need me 'll be at the beach house having dinner with a
certain someone
Jane tries to conceal her interest
As soon as Viktor exits the office,  picks up the phone
(into phone, under her breath) Elaine Christian please
We reveal , outside the door, eavesdropping on his assistant, pleased she has taken the bait
'   - dims the lights, plays "mood" music
The doorbell rings
He checks himself in the mirror
In the reflection, he spies an autographed photo of  with his arm around
He hurriedly hides the photo and answers the door
stands there
Viktor, 'm picking up Lainey
Elaine is over-dressed for her supposed errand
Elaine, it's Wednesday
(feigning absent mindedness) Is it Wednesday
It's Wednesday
How embarrassing
don't know what  was thinking
With all the excitement lately
(peering past him) Am  interrupting something
Are you expecting company
(ushering her inside) As a matter-of-fact  am
When is she coming over
(glancing to his watch) About now
Would you like a drink
suppose  could stay, just until she arrives
Elaine takes a seat on the sofa
Viktor hands her a glass of wine and sits beside her -- close
They both knock back their wine in one long gulp, both apparently in need of courage
(trying to make conversation) Is Simone back to earth yet
Not quite
'm sure you'll keep her focussed
She's lucky to have you, Viktor
(blurting out) Is she really having your baby
Impossible
(instantly regretting the remark) just read somewhere -- know
know
They'll say anything
-- And she was positively glowing at the awards
(making to leave) should be going, she'll be here soon -- Viktor puts his finger to her lips to hush her
-- She already is
Simone's not coming over, Elaine
Not tonight, not ever
(holding her) want you back, Elaine
(melting) want you back too, Viktor
They kiss
Elaine breaks the kiss, suddenly consumed with doubt
This is crazy
Who am  fooling
can't compete with Simone
What woman can
would rather have you than Simone
Believe me
That's sweet, Viktor, but couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice
(meeting his gaze) It's strange
've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where  am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason,  can't betray Simone
There's
don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her
No, there isn't
There's nothing to her
Oh, Viktor
You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this
But in the morning, you'd go back to her
What man wouldn't
No,  will end my relationship with her -- totally
But you don't understand
She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen
(desperate) No
She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again
(confused) Of course she will
Her public will demand it
Not if  don't let her
You
Viktor knocks back another glass of wine for courage
'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine
(mustering all his nerve) Simone is not a real person invented her
(misinterpreting his remark) Every actor is an invention, Viktor
Don't embarrass yourself
No one's denying that you discovered Simone
But it's like finding a diamond in the desert
Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles
(agitated) -- No, no,  didn't trip over her
You don't understand -- (ignoring him) -- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you
Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows
She certainly doesn't need you
Some people even say you're holding her back
(wounded) Who says that --
(shaking off the insult) -- Never mind
You have to listen to me, Elaine
Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation
inherited it from a madman --  can show you -- How much wine have you had
-- She's a figment of my own imagination
, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history
And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what 've done -- even you
(rolling her eyes) You're drunker than  thought
Are you doing that again
No
Whatever talent Simone has comes from me -- me
Me
swear, as God is my judge
You don't know what 've been through
Tens of thousands of mind-numbing hours in front of that screen, nights without end, and look what it's cost me
(producing his spectacles) Why do you think 've been wearing these
may have done irreparable harm to my eyesight, and why
To extract and refine the infinite nuances of a human being -- a human soul
(a final explanation) Don't you see
made Simone
pause
His words hang in the air
You made Simone
(a trace of pity) Viktor, she made you
Elaine gets up and walks out, leaving the distraught Viktor alone in his house
'  - hung-over  enters his office
Suddenly, he stops and confronts the standee of
You bitch
'll destroy you
stares in shock
She discreetly exits
'  - sits in front of his monitor, smiling venomously at He begins to digitally disrobe Simone
: )  Peering through a gap in the drapes of his Malibu house, watches  dig through his trash
Max finds a beat up reel of 16mm film
holds the end up to the light -- his eyes pop
)  The  headline screams, "'   " and shows censored film frames of a naked Simone in a compromising position
, hovering at a supermarket check-out line, overhears two  discussing the article
1 Disgusting
2 (sympathetic) She must have been so desperate to do something like that, so depraved
1 'm still naming my baby after her
2 You're having a boy
1 So
Viktor blanches
It is not the reaction he'd hoped for
)  Inside a theater,  hovers by the door, smirking
, we hear a farmyard scene --  in an empty farmyard on all fours, grunting like a pig, and foraging for muddy vegetables
The  is shocked, then suddenly breaks into spontaneous applause
Viktor, enraged, exits into the lobby past the poster for "   - Starring Simone"
)   pretentious   talks to camera, a film poster behind him
For Simone to do something as brave as "  " at this point in her career, with so much to lose -- all can say is, " Am Pig,  Am Oscar"
)  In his soundstage,  moves a slider that adds wrinkles to Simone
)   appears on a morning talk show -- as usual, remote on a  screen
However, her squeaky-clean image has gone -- hair unkempt, bloated, chain-smoking and drinking during the interview
The  are smiling weakly
Simone, that's a rather controversial position
just think all elementary schools should have a firing range -- so students can learn how to defend themselves
We could fit it inbetween recess and American History
Another clip: If there's a hole in the ozone layer why can't  see it
Another clip: Immigration
God, isn't it crowded enough
Just as we always knew
Simone's not like other celebrities
She speaks her mind
)   driving along a city street, suddenly slams on his brakes, almost causing an accident
He stares numbly up at a twenty-foot high smiling photo of Simone on a billboard featuring a huge cover of
It reads, ":    "
(to himself) She's trying to kill me
Realizing what he's said, a thought comes into his eyes
- An inscription on a headstone reads: Remembered Virtually Forever kneels at 's grave
He places a bunch of flowers there
(referring to the flowers) They're plastic, Hank
know that's the way you'd want it
(glancing to a Simone billboard outside the cemetery wall) She killed you, Hank
Now she's killing me
She's a serial killer
(ducking out of sight of the billboard as if Simone is watching him) But  don't know how to stop her
She's taken on a life of her own
can't just come clean -- make some confession
've defrauded millions -- they'd turn on me
And can't put the genie back in the bottle
If she stopped working -- dropped out of sight, they'd never let it rest
've tried to kill her career but they like her even more
(more desperate) What am  going to do, Hank
thought occurs to Viktor
He slowly rises from behind Hank's headstone, revealing a forest of headstones
Don't say another word, Hank
You are truly a genius
'  - sad but resolute  sits in front of his monitor, 's face full screen
He speaks into the voice synthesizer, Simone's face automatically speaking the words he speaks -- the final time he puts his words in her mouth
/ What's the matter, Viktor
You look so sad
Don't you love me anymore
It's over, isn't it
He switches off the synthesizer and speaks in his own voice
It's the only way, Simone
If it's any consolation, you're going to live on in the public's heart like all the other tragic figures that went before their time
There's no love like posthumous love
On the screen, Simone is on the verge of tears
know what you're thinking
It's a phoney-baloney world
The women are surgically enhanced, the athletes are on steroids, the singers are lip-syncing if they're even singing at all, the news is entertainment, the politicians are bought and paid for -- we're living one big lie
So why shouldn't you live too
You're more authentic than the people who adore you
(a trace of despair) And that's the problem
You're looking at the real fraud
told myself this was all about the work but if that was the truth, it wouldn't matter to me -- and it does
It wasn't that the artists had no respect for the art
They had no respect for me
Someone like you, you have so much love showered on you --  just wanted to feel one tiny drop on my face
'm sorry, Simone
Here 've been trying to convince the world that you exist, but  was really trying to convince them that  exist
It's not that you aren't human, Simone, it's that  am
Viktor produces a disc from his jacket marked, " - Ver
8
1"
He places the disc in the machine
Viktor sees that Simone is crying
He touches a tear on his own face and realizes her tears are in response to his own
Viktor hesitates -- a moment of doubt -- then presses ""
The image of 's face gradually begins to deconstruct -- pixel by pixel -- as the virus takes hold
The pixels collect into a pile at the bottom of his screen like dust
Finally, the dust is blown away in a single digital breath
For a moment his attention is taken with a layer of dust on his own desk
Viktor regards his own reflection in the now black screen
His hard-drive now corrupted, he picks up his original disc marked, " "
He tosses this disc into a steamer trunk he has loaded with hundreds of discs relating to Simone's software
He shuts the lid and begins dragging the trunk towards the door
- Viktor's yacht sits at anchor in the glassy waters of Santa Monica Bay -- "" written on the stern
manhandles the trunk to the railing

The trunk sinks like a stone
Heart heavy, Viktor stares into the inky depths

It is my sad and solemn duty to announce the tragic passing of Simone

Then, an explosion of anguish
No
What happened
Oh
God

2 Did she suffer
Mercifully, it was quick

They are frozen in grief, a tear spills from Max's eye

Simone's coffin is ferried across a bridge by from the studio
Numerous  follow behind

(horrified by the suggestion) How can you bring that up at a time like this
The coffin reaches the steps of the marble mausoleum , , and a   turn to Viktor
He nods and they start to carry the coffin towards the door
However, the coffin is suddenly stopped by a

The coffin lid is pulled back
Inside is a life-sized cardboard standee of Simone from " "
The  gasp

should have done more to stop it

-- It was strange

-   - sits in an interrogation room in a sea of
Magazine covers, cosmetics advertisements, publicity shots, interviews, website print-outs, photographs and report cards from her fictitious childhood are plastered on the walls, stacks of film cans and tapes of her numerous movie and television appearances
-- Forgive me, Mr
Taransky
'm just trying to understand
All these films,  appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake
(referring to various items) This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake
That's right
You understand perfectly
will confess to fraud, not murder
(referring to oversize mail bags) fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus
Oh, no
The fan club is real
But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros
So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone
Of course
And this Mr
Hank Aleno who you talk so much about, a renowned failure, who also happens to be so conveniently dead -- perhaps the "man" you claim helped invent Simone is an invention himself
Viktor, sensing his sarcasm, does not reply
(patronizing smile) But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr
Taransky
refer, of course, to Edith
Who
The Detective raises a window-blind to reveal a next door room where the   from the rest home is being interviewed
The woman you admitted to a journalist is Simone's mother and for whose silence you paid a fortune
Is she not flesh to you -- are her tears not wet
The   glances up and sees all the photos of Simone through the window
My
The Detective abruptly lowers the blind
Viktor rolls his eyes at the Detective's theatrics
He is suddenly enraged
She's insane
This whole thing is insane
There is no Simone
Look
(grabbing a Simone poster) Even her name is fake
It's not Simone
(he tears Simone's name in half to demonstrate) It's
Simulation One
The Detectives sadly shake their heads
2 (regarding Simone's face also torn in half) You really hated her, didn't you
The Detective places a tape, marked " " in a video machine
Perhaps you could explain this to me, Mr
Taransky -- or is this tape "doctored" too
He plays a tape showing -- -  (  ) dragging his trunk from his car down the pier to his yacht
It's footage from the marina's closed-circuit camera on the night in question
Altered, of course
Is that really what you expect us to believe, Mr
Taransky
The Detective freezes the tape
Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist
It wasn't her body
It was her body of work
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor
Tell the truth
You'll feel better afterwards
am telling the truth
(coming close to him) We all know what happened
In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you
No
can prove it to you
'll take you to her
-    - sits handcuffed on a   with the and his
surface with the steamer trunk
Viktor's face lights up
The trunk is winched aboard
However, as it lowers onto the deck, we see the latch has broken and the lid is ajar
All eyes stare inside the trunk as the lid is lifted
Apart from a scrawny piece of kelp -- empty
(panicky, desperately grabbing the divers) Did you find anything else -- drivers, discs
disc-drives
1 Nothing
(gazing to the water) We couldn't stay down any longer
All eyes follow the diver's gaze to several   in the water
: ""     " The newspaper is being read by Viktor's , sitting opposite Viktor in his cell
is numb -- the likelihood of conviction slowly dawning on him
-- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court
It's the best deal you're going to get
(incredulous) could get the death penalty
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood
You've killed an icon, for God's sake
didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill
(musing) An insanity defence
'  - sits at Viktor's computer
She scrolls through Viktor's files
All empty
Lainey sighs
paces behind her
Let's go, Lainey
There's nothing here
Just a minute
Elaine continues to pace as Lainey works
God, it's so like your father
Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore
can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence
can never forgive that
Because obviously she existed, right
know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart
She was the most vital woman  ever met
So you did meet her
Of course
What are you suggesting
mean really meet her -- in the flesh
Elaine regards her daughter curiously
know it's embarrassing to admit it, mom, but when  think about it -- honestly,  haven't
mean, it feels like  have
know more about her than members of my own family
She's even in my dreams
But  realized, going back through my diary, they were all appearances, near misses at parties, second-hand rumor, gossip on the internet
've never actually seen Simone up close, touched her, been in her physical presence
Have you
(unable to refute it) Well,  -- -- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too
(trying to shake the notion from her head) Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real
Listen to what you're saying, mom
Is there any evidence she is
Lainey finally tries another file
She presses ""
The "" disc spits out of the machine
(regarding the disc) There's one part of dad's story that may have been true
Simone may have contracted a virus
Lainey smiles at her mother
Certain viruses can be cured
-   - sits in his cell, arms crossed, quietly seething, while his  lays out his trial strategy
(hushed tones, referring to a thick Psychiatric Report) Listen, 've found a psychiatrist in Ventura -- well respected -- who's willing to testify under oath that you have diminished capacity due to the trauma of your divorce, ten years of abject failure in the movie business and a bump on the head you sustained as a child -- , fuming throughout this, suddenly explodes
-- No
can't go along with this horseshit
Just tell them they can fry me
(aghast, looking around to see if anyone has heard) What
It was premeditated --  knew exactly what  was doing strangled her
bludgeoned her
set her on fire
did it killed her
(
) (clearing his throat) Excuse me
The Lawyer spins around guiltily
The Detective stands outside the cell, clearly overhearing the confession
Viktor, resigned to his fate, couldn't care less
think you'd better see this
The Detective switches on the  set hanging outside the cell
is playing -- " " -- - "" -  (  ) appears
(from ) -- Breaking news -- international media star, Simone, is alive and well
Her studio released this footage only minutes ago
-  (  ) The brief clip shows the front page of the
Times -- headlines: "      " and "
Seeks Death Penalty for Taransky"
The reader lowers the newspaper to reveal herself -- , on the studio lot, looking more beautiful than ever
She winks to the camera
Simone reading today's edition of the
Times
Who says, "The only bad publicity is your obituary"
Details at the top of the hour
The  is switched off
Viktor stares at the screen, trying to take it in
You're indestructible
When he looks back to the Detective, he discovers him holding the cell door open
(shaking his head in pity) 'll never get you Hollywood people
- throng of ,  and  parts like a sea for , released from custody
One placard reads, "     "
He is escorted to a waiting limousine where he is met by  and
He hugs them both
- sits beside
sits opposite, studying her laptop computer
Outside the car,  are pressed against the glass
(relaxing back into his seat) Thank you
(to Lainey) don't know how you did it but thank you
(putting her arm around him) Don't thank us too fast, Viktor
You know what we have to do
(resigned smile) Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast
Exactly
Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things
Viktor shrugs resignedly, savoring his freedom
(holding Viktor close) was thinking -- what about you and
"Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey
(meeting her gaze) That sounds wonderful
(to Lainey) How do you feel about all this, Lainey
(beaming) About you and mom
(reluctant admission) Me and Simone
What  did
(sweet smile) Your mistake wasn't making something fake, daddy
We're fine with fake -- as long as you don't lie about it
Once again his daughter's words have a ghastly ring of truth
Viktor stares out of the limo window as the car gradually forces its way through the reporters
He recognizes  and  amongst the mob
Max has hastily scribbled a note that he presses against the window -- "  $  "
Viktor looks away
(kissing him on the cheek) Don't look so glum, Viktor
It's not a death sentence
(still staring out of the window, a rueful smile) No
it's life
- conducts a remote interview with  who appears as usual on a television monitor
-- Simone, the question on everyone's mind is simply
"why
" Frank, you know as well as  do, living in a fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media
Frank nods sympathetically
With everything that was going on in my life,  just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- needed time
Viktor bought me that time
owe him so much
We all do
(quickly returning to Simone) But now  understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting
(smiles coyly) That's true
can reveal that am considering a career in politics
And what may  ask brought this on
holds up a beautiful   to camera
suppose this little man had something to do with it
Viktor and  are both concerned about what kind of world our new son, Chip, is going to grow up in
(turning lovingly to Viktor) Aren't you, Viktor
On Frank Brand's monitor, the camera pulls back to reveal , sitting on a sofa -- an idyllic domestic scene
(turning lovingly to Simone) Yes
- Only we see the set where the interview is being recorded
is sitting on a sofa against a green screen in his soundstage, smiling at a woman and child who are not there -- he is alone
- -- "(    ) "
